### National Focuses ####

## Three and a Half Year Plan ##
KIR_focus_1:0 "In the Vermilion Realm"
KIR_focus_1_desc:0 "With the ratification of the Hyacinth Accord and the departure of the Equestrian delegation, it is time for the Matriarch Superior to bring The Silence to an end in earnest and allow her realm to focus on modernization and rejoining the global community. A grand assembly of the brightest minds both within and without Kiria will serve as the basis upon which to begin our modernization efforts."
KIR_focus_2a:0 "Welcome the Delegates"
KIR_focus_2a_desc:0 "Delegates from across the Realm are arriving in Vermilion on a daily basis, bringing with them their own experiences and ideas on how to propel Kiria into the modern era in just a few short years. Many more come from beyond its borders, educated in foreign nations and exposed to their culture. All of their ideas will be useful in rewriting Kiria's future and starting a new chapter for the nation."
KIR_focus_2b:0 "Dispatch the Envoys"
KIR_focus_2b_desc:0 "While those living in Vermilion learned almost immediately that the imperial decrees that created The Silence have been repealed, there are countless thousands of kirin living in rural villages who are still unaware that their fortunes are soon to change for the better. Imperial heralds shall venture forth throughout the Realm and find every last village to share the Matriarch's good news."
KIR_focus_3a:0 "An Industrial Convocation"
KIR_focus_3a_desc:0 "If the Realm is to leapfrog over a hundred years of missed progress and modernization, then it will need kirin educated and trained abroad to make it happen. Fickle Current will use his literati ties to the kirin diaspora to bring many of the kirin species' best and brightest minds home to help modernize the nation."
KIR_focus_3b:0 "The 3½ Year Plan"
KIR_focus_3b_desc:0 "The rapid modernization of Kiria will be a chaotic process that can only be sustained for so long. The Matriarch has proclaimed 'The Grand Gallop Onward', aiming to fast-track a century's worth of lost progress in three and a half years. The Plenum will have to deftly manage the tumultuous transformation of Kirin society and culture if Kiria is to emerge intact from this rough and hasty metamorphosis."
KIR_focus_3d:0 "The Reform Bureau"
KIR_focus_3d_desc:0 "The Reform Bureau is a centralized executive body created for the All-Kiria Plenum for National Revival and granted a limited amount of imperial mandate by the Matriarch herself. It serves as the central governing body of the rapidly changing Realm, and it is here that the final drafts of bills are hammered out before being presented to the Matriarch Superior."
KIR_focus_3e:0 "Reestablish Rulership"
KIR_focus_3e_desc:0 "Throughout The Silence's century-long stranglehold on the Realm of Kiria, the absolute authority of the Dynasty waned throughout the countryside as contact with Vermilion ceased to exist. A fresh round of imperial decrees and a reassertion of Matriarch Rain Shine's divine authority will begin to reassert her authority over the Realm, though some might chafe under our resumed governance."
KIR_focus_4a:0 "Call Upon the Diaspora"
KIR_focus_4a_desc:0 "From the very beginning of The Silence, some of our most talented and educated kirin fled the Realm to look for a better life elsewhere in the world. For a century, those kirin and their descendants have flourished abroad, gaining skills, knowledge, and capital that they could not gain here at home. We must bring them back to Kiria and ask them to help contribute to the modernization of our nation."
KIR_focus_4e:0 "In the Vermilion Court"
KIR_focus_4e_desc:0 "The delegates at the Plenum have begun to coalesce into different factions with their own ideas for how the modernization of Kiria should look, far from the heterogenous mixture of ideas and experiences that our Matriarch originally hoped for. But even still, the three parties that have formed at the Plenum do not represent the voices of all of her subjects..."
KIR_focus_4f:0 "The Office of Transmission"
KIR_focus_4f_desc:0 "Understanding the impossibility of having every kirin in the Realm venture to Vermilion to share their ideas and complaints with the Matriarch Superior, Matriarch Rain Shine has decreed that the Office of Transmission be established to receive letters and appeals from her subjects and bring them to her immediate attention, so that they may be discussed during gatherings of the Plenum."
KIR_focus_6b:0 "Resettle Kirin Returnees"
KIR_focus_6b_desc:0 "As the diaspora returns home, these long-lost sons and daughters of Kiria need a place to live. Thankfully, Kiria is a vast realm full of land, and most of its towns and cities are underpopulated, meaning it will be easy to find homes for them all. This has the added benefit of boosting the average literacy rates in our population centers, even if it comes with a wide variety of potentially subversive foreign ideas."
KIR_focus_6c:0 "The Council of the Verdigris Rotunda"
KIR_focus_6c_desc:0 "The Morning Secretariat has long served as the Matriarch Superior's counciling body, offering advice and interpretations of Concord's will to the Matriarch to inform her rule. Since its conception, it has been entirely populated by priests and mystics from The Way of Fire, whose concerns are often more spiritual than temporal. A new Morning Secretariat must be appointed to guide Kiria in a new era."
KIR_focus_7b:0 "The All-Kiria Collegium"
KIR_focus_7b_desc:0 "Kiria's first modern university, the All-Kiria Collegium will train the next generation of native kirin intellectuals, with the assistance of professors and scholars educated in foreign lands such as Equestria and Yale. However, with new ideas come new dangerous thoughts. Will we let our professors teach freely, or should they be monitored by the Reform Bureau to weed out radical thought?"
KIR_focus_8a:0 "Industrialise the Breadbasket"
KIR_focus_8a_desc:0 "The farmland between the branches of the Great Mellifluve River is the most fertile in the land. With the benefits of modern farming techniques and tools, it alone could produce enough food to feed every kirin in the nation three square meals a day. Investment in the breadbasket will strengthen the nation as a whole for years to come, and ensure that no kirin goes hungry ever again."
KIR_focus_4c:0 "The Road to Vermilion"
KIR_focus_4c_desc:0 "The roads that once connected Vermilion with the rest of Concord's realm have long since been overgrown, owing to their disuse during The Silence. Using priests to recruit local laborers to the cause, clearing and reestablishing these roads will be crucial to once more unifying the realm under Matriarch Superior Rain Shine's rule."
KIR_focus_5b:0 "Scholar-Monk Travelling Syndicates"
KIR_focus_5b_desc:0 "Monks and priests have long been the preeminent backbone of Kiria's education system, traveling across the land to spread their teachings of The Way of Fire with the common kirin, and training those who enter their order to read and write. By recruiting these traveling syndicates to educate the populace, we can make bold steps in combating illiteracy throughout the Realm."
KIR_focus_5d:0 "The Laws of the Realm"
KIR_focus_5d_desc:0 "While we have moved to enact new laws and decrees to improve the standing of the realm, there are still many harsh laws that exist from The Silence. One such law makes transforming into the nirik state a capital offense punishable by death. Though loosely enforced throughout The Silence, a debate rages on the necessity of this law as the realm modernizes at a rate never seen before."
KIR_focus_7a:0 "The Role of the Way of Fire vis-à-vis the State"
KIR_focus_7a_desc:0 "Since the creation of the Vermilion Realm, the nation has been ruled as a theocracy, with The Way of Fire and Concord's teachings inextricably entwined with every facet of governance and daily life. But now a proposal is crossing the Plenum floor to extricate the inextricable. Is it possible to partially secularize this centuries-old theocracy, or is the mere suggestion of that possibility nothing but heresy?"
KIR_focus_7f:0 "The Role of the Matriarch Superior"
KIR_focus_7f_desc:0 "The position of the Matriarch Superior is one of unlimited divine authority bestowed on the Matriarch by Concord herself. Her powers are broad and poorly defined, and any decree she issues is to be considered law as soon as it is proclaimed. Such archaic methods of governance have no place in a modern nation, and so it is time to codify the powers of the Matriarch Superior and her government."
KIR_focus_8e:0 "Restoring the Bureaucracy"
KIR_focus_8e_desc:0 "Following the imposition of The Silence, the system of bureaucrats and administrators that allowed the nation to function as a cohesive whole has since collapsed. It is time to appoint new advisors, governors, and administrators to once more take control of the Realm, bringing the various local administrations back under the Matriarch's control and restarting the economy."
KIR_focus_4d:0 "Technological Imports"
KIR_focus_4d_desc:0 "If we are to advance as a nation, we cannot afford to waste time rediscovering technologies that have long since been perfected in foreign lands. By asking the returning kirin literati for help in supplying the nation with copies and examples of state-of-the-art technology, we can reverse-engineer our designs and rapidly scale up our industrial capabilities in a very short timeframe."
KIR_focus_5h:0 "Land Repossessions"
KIR_focus_5h_desc:0 "Much of the Realm's land falls into one of two categories: unpopulated bastions of nature, or sprawling subsistence farms. By concentrating our efforts on reorganizing our farmland and making in-roads into untapped nature reserves, we can greatly expand the amount of available land we have for building projects, allowing us to increase the density of our growing industrial base."
KIR_focus_5a:0 "Geological Surveys"
KIR_focus_5a_desc:0 "Kiria is full of untapped potential when it comes to our resources. What we produce today only scratches the surface of the Realm's potential. We know that our hills are full of natural resources that have yet to be properly exploited by industrial excavation operations. All we have to do is fund geological surveys to find the best deposits and encourage excavation companies to dig them up."
KIR_focus_5c:0 "The "Three Strengths" Campaign"
KIR_focus_5c_desc:0 "The modernization efforts of the Plenum have long been championed by the 'Three Strengths' campaign, which promotes Harmony, Heritage, and Homeland as its three most important values. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that each strength has been taken up by a different clique as their championing point. One of these cliques will naturally resonate more with the kirin people than the others."
KIR_focus_6h:0 "Northern Industry"
KIR_focus_6h_desc:0 "Fragrance and Rhapsody were two important bastions of modernization before The Silence, and both cities resisted its imposition to various extents, planting the seeds for future modernization efforts. Now, they will be some of the first cities to benefit from the resurgence of modernization, and are already constructing massive industrial complexes to capitalize on this change."
KIR_focus_6a:0 "Agrarian Consolidation"
KIR_focus_6a_desc:0 "As kirin moved out of the cities at the beginning of The Silence, they set up subsistence farms across the countryside wherever they could find land. Most of these farms are small and poorly managed, reliant wholly on manual labor to grow any crops. Consolidating clusters of these farms under one manager and bringing in modern farming equipment will increase their productivity and free up valuable land."
KIR_focus_7c:0 "The Riverine Economy"
KIR_focus_7c_desc:0 "The Great Mellifluve is the lifeblood of the Cradle of Kirinity. Its vast waterways connect distant towns and cities while providing fertile ground for farmland in between. Investing in the local economy that has grown around the river will make the strength of our nation that much stronger, allowing us to create a booming business growth in our heartlands that fuels growth throughout the Realm."
KIR_focus_8b:0 "Open Up the Ports"
KIR_focus_8b_desc:0 "The port of Fragrance was once the most important in all of Kiria, connecting our nation with traders from as far away as Griffonia. Fragrance's port was shut down when The Silence began, and its harbors have fallen into decay. With enough investment, however, we can return Fragrance to its former glory, and Fragrance can once again connect us to the rest of the world."
KIR_focus_9b:0 "Riches of the Mellifluve"
KIR_focus_9b_desc:0 "The far branches of the Mellifluve once carried their exports down its waters to the city of Verdant, where they were organized and recorded before being launched to the rest of the Realm as valuable products or to the world as trade goods. The towns along these branches have long since withered with the collapse of the economy, and need our help to become prosperous once more."
KIR_focus_10a:0 "Urban-Led Modernisation"
KIR_focus_10a_desc:0 "Modernisation, as has been seen time and time again, starts in the cities and trickles down to the countryside. Though our urban centers declined during The Silence, we can rebuild them with new infrastructure that can support the modernisation of the realm. This will have the side effect of allowing us to draw more kirin into our cities, bringing them to whole new levels of productivity."
KIR_focus_8g:0 "Verdant Manufactories"
KIR_focus_8g_desc:0 "The city of Verdant is proving to be a fertile ground for the growth of modernisation in the realm. With an abundance of labor and room to expand, the working class in Verdant is growing faster than perhaps anywhere else in Kiria. But with all this new labor comes the spread of new and radical ideas, and the workers that build factories today may get ideas about taking them back tomorrow..."
KIR_focus_9a:0 "The Trans-Kiria Railway"
KIR_focus_9a_desc:0 "If Kiria is to become united and modern, then a way of bringing people and goods from one side of the nation to the other is essential. While the Great Mellifluve has long served as a crucial highway for our realm, it cannot reach everywhere. The construction of modern and standardized railways throughout the realm will bring our people together like never before."
KIR_focus_9c:0 "Kiria on the World Stage"
KIR_focus_9c_desc:0 "We have come far in our reforms, and the world is beginning to take notice. It is time that we invite delegations from all across the world to Vermilion to witness not only our traditional culture but the advances we have made. This isn't all fun and games however; Kiria needs help to move into the modern era, and making a good impression on our foreign peers will make them more likely to lend us aid."
KIR_focus_11a:0 "Breakneck Industrialisation"
KIR_focus_11a_desc:0 "Rapid industrialization of our Realm, at a rate never seen anywhere else in the world, has come with its own host of challenges. One of the most critical of these is the need for skilled and unskilled labor, and we have gone to great lengths to attain workers for our modern society. But bringing so many kirin to one place to work for the gears of capitalism comes the risk of radical leftist ideas spreading around..."
KIR_focus_4b:0 "The Autumnal Premiership"
KIR_focus_4b_desc:0 "Premier Autumn Blaze is a young kirin left in charge of the greatest undertaking in kirin history, with consequences that will shape our history for decades to come. It is a lot of responsibility for one mare to shoulder, but she is determined to shoulder it, and Matriarch Superior Rain Shine has entrusted in her almost unlimited authority to choose the path of the nation's modernisation."
KIR_focus_5e:0 "The Charter of Rights"
KIR_focus_5e_desc:0 "As we move away from the society of our past to the society of a modern age, we have the opportunity to learn from the struggles of other nations. Industrialization was often brutal on the laborers that fueled it, and protections for these workers only came after they were forced to endure unimaginable suffering. Let us guarantee protections for our workers so they do not have to needlessly suffer as well."
KIR_focus_6d:0 "Repeal the Quiescence"
KIR_focus_6d_desc:0 "The Quiescence was a series of decrees that went along with The Silence that suppressed the study of science, religion, philosophy, and many other forms of education in the realm. As a result, our society has stagnated, and much of the populace is illiterate. If we wish to educate a new generation of kirin, the Quiescence must be repealed in its entirety."
KIR_focus_8f:0 "An Imperial Constitution"
KIR_focus_8f_desc:0 "It is time to draft a constitution that will lay out the powers and privileges of each branch of our new government. The authority of the Matriarch Superior will be defined, and the responsibilities of the Morning Secretariat laid out. However, the Realm lacks a modern judicial system, and it is up to the Premier to come up with a proposal for one that will best serve the interests of the Realm."
KIR_focus_3c:0 "Reassemble the Banners"
KIR_focus_3c_desc:0 "Kiria once possessed an impressive military supported by the Banner System, where each city contributed soldiers to a local Banner that could be rallied and commanded at the Matriarch's discretion. These soldiers would then be given land following their service, creating an entire class of proud soldier-citizens. It is time to rally these soldiers once more to face the threats of the modern era."
KIR_focus_4g:0 "Recommission the Rhapsody Arsenal"
KIR_focus_4g_desc:0 "The Rhapsody Arsenal was once the forefront of kirin weapons invention and gained fame across eastern Zebrica for the quality of the cannons they manufactured. But for a century now, the arsenal has been closed and abandoned. It is time to reopen the Rhapsody Arsenal and combine the inventions of the modern era with the ingenuity of the kirin that once made it so renowned."
KIR_focus_5g:0 "Recall, Rearm, Regroup"
KIR_focus_5g_desc:0 "Reassembling the Banners was a start, but there are currently too few kirin who have answered the call to form a functional modern military. We must start by organizing limited conscription and drafting peasants and commoners to create regional militias that, with proper training, may one day join the Banners and provide the backbone for our modern army."
KIR_focus_5f:0 "The New Standard Army"
KIR_focus_5f_desc:0 "It is difficult to create a modern army from scratch, but we will have to try regardless. Standardizing army doctrine and training regimens, laying out the benefits and terms of service, and acquiring foreign weapons and surplus equipment will go a long way in providing the basis to build the New Standard Army upon."
KIR_focus_6e:0 "Found the Motor Bureau"
KIR_focus_6e_desc:0 "The days of marching an army from one end of the nation to the other is over. A truly modern army can move its troops to where they need to go using motorized equipment. Fickle Current has offered to use his funds to procure Griffonian trucks and establish a motor bureau that will aid in researching and producing trucks to allow our army to motorize."
KIR_focus_7d:0 "Doctrinal Modernisation"
KIR_focus_7d_desc:0 "Modern wars are not fought with infantry formations, pitched battles, and sheer force of will. Modern wars are won by well-planned and coordinated actions defined by the military's doctrine that dictates how the army should act. Developing our land doctrines will be useful for modernising our army and giving it the ability to fight effectively in the field."
KIR_focus_6f:0 "Kirin Rifle Designs"
KIR_focus_6f_desc:0 "Our species is blessed by Concord in that every individual can use basic telekinesis to manipulate objects and hold weapons. We can use this gift that we have been blessed with to create weapons ideal for our species that only we can use, rather than relying on the designs of other nations. If we want to create a functional modern army, then we need guns made here at home, and we need a lot of them."
KIR_focus_8c:0 "The Massicot War School"
KIR_focus_8c_desc:0 "The training grounds of Massicot once were the pride of our army, where thousands of soldiers could be trained in the art of war. The War School has been closed for a century now, and no new students have passed through its doors. To rebuild our army, we must reopen the school and begin training the next generation of soldiers."
KIR_focus_7e:0 "Vanguards of a New Age"
KIR_focus_7e_desc:0 "The kirin vanguards have long been the best of our best soldiers. Lightly armed and armored, they fought as deadly skirmishers at the front of our armies, whittling the enemy down and threatening their flanks while the main host moved in to engage. But in the age of gunpowder and mechanized warfare, we need to adapt our vanguards to incorporate modern hit-and-gallop tactics into their arsenal."
KIR_focus_8d:0 "Seafarer Marines"
KIR_focus_8d_desc:0 "The Sycee Trading House has long employed seafarer marines in Griffonia to protect its ships from pirate attack when moving valuable goods along the high seas. These marines are largely members of the diaspora and would be better served protecting their homeland rather than business interests. We will negotiate the assimilation of Sycee's seafarer marines into our Banners to bolster our army's capabilities."
KIR_focus_9e:0 "Through Flame and Fury"
KIR_focus_9e_desc:0 "The Vermilion Banners were once the most feared and professional fighting force in eastern Zebrica, but The Silence has allowed it to decay into a shell of its former self. If we are to complete the rebuilding of our magnificent army, then we must encourage the bravery of our soldiers in the field and the innovation of our philosophers behind it."
KIR_focus_9d:0 "The Experimental Armored Corps"
KIR_focus_9d_desc:0 "The modern battlefield heavily features the use of bulletproof armored vehicles, which can create an unstoppable spearhead at the front of an offensive, or deliver a decisive counterattack to an enemy breakthrough. While we currently lack the industry to create state-of-the-art tanks, we can invest in light armored vehicles as a stopgap until our industrial capabilities expand further."
KIR_focus_4h:0 "A Vermilion Armada"
KIR_focus_4h_desc:0 "Our once proud navy was mothballed and later scuttled as a result of The Silence. We control a large swath of coastline in eastern Zebrica, yet we have no navy to patrol it. We must begin to build and assemble a modern navy to keep our coastlines safe and allow us to project our force over the waves that we rightfully rule."
KIR_focus_6g:0 "Develop the Eastern Seaboard"
KIR_focus_6g_desc:0 "The kirin living on our seaboards were almost entirely reliant on fishing to survive throughout The Silence; as a result, the eastern seaboard in particular is woefully underdeveloped. We can make use of these scattered fishing villages to cobble together local workforces for new dockyards and shipyards along the coast that will boost our naval production and economy."
KIR_focus_7g:0 "The Fragrant Flotilla"
KIR_focus_7g_desc:0 "Sitting at the bottom of the Fragrant harbor are three old warships, once the most modern ships in the Realm, but scuttled during a sailor mutiny in the city during The Silence. They have been underwater for decades now, but expeditions have confirmed that they are still in decent condition. Raising these three ships and retrofitting them will allow us to field three outdated but formidable ships in our new navy."
KIR_focus_9f:0 "Purchase Equestrian Naval Blueprints"
KIR_focus_9f_desc:0 "We do not have time to develop modern naval ships from scratch, but we do have friends who are already at the forefront of naval thought. We will benefit from our close ties to Equestria to acquire modern blueprints for ships, weapons, fire control systems, and more that will allow us to begin to construct a modern navy."
KIR_focus_10b:0 "Reclaim Auburn Isle"
KIR_focus_10b_desc:0 "The pirates of Nacre on Auburn Isle have long been a nuisance to the Realm. Their constant raids along our coastline have destabilized us for too long, and their punishment is overdue. We will sail forth with our new navy and our modern army and put an end to the pirate menace in Nacre!"

KIR_POST_1A_desc:0 "Under our new Constitution, the Imperial Premier will no longer govern at the Matriarch's pleasure. The new office of the Premier of Kiria will be elected by the Morning Secretariat. And after all her Imperial Premiership has endured, there is really only one mare for the job."
KIR_POST_1B:0 "Kirian Consociationalism"

KIR_ARMY_0:0 "The New Kirian Army"
KIR_ARMY_0_desc:0 "The initial reforms have been remarkably successful in bringing our old Banners from obscurity caused by The Silence, and slowly turning them into a modern army. However, there is a lot of room for improvement, if we want Kiria to truly be a respectable military power once again, able to protect its kirin from the dangers from beyond."

KIR_OFFICER_1:0 "New Army General Staff"
KIR_OFFICER_1_desc:0 "After The Silence, Kiria lacked experienced officers and general staff, with their only experience being quelling rare revolts against the matriarch's decrees. This is beginning to change but our General Staff still requires some reforms, if we are to make Kiria's army a truly modern and competent one."
KIR_OFFICER_2:0 "Bannerkirin to Cadres"
KIR_OFFICER_2_desc:0 "Banners have been the backbone of the Kirian army for centuries, but while the system has served us well so far, it is not without its flaws. We need to start reforming the bannerkirin into a proper professional army. Their experience, combined with a more modern conscription system, will allow our army to be a force to be reckoned with."
KIR_GUERILLA_1:0 "Soldiers of the Land"
KIR_GUERILLA_1_desc:0 "We cannot expect Kiria to forever be safe from other powers in the world. Sooner or later, we'll have to defend ourselves. We must ensure it is as difficult as possible for our enemies, by teaching our soldiers guerrilla tactics and using our homeland to our advantage."
KIR_GUERILLA_2:0 "The Partisan Anvil"
KIR_GUERILLA_2_desc:0 "An enemy invasion may penetrate deep into the Realm before a counteroffensive can be marshalled. Until then, our stay-behind forces will delay the invaders as much as possible. Once the tide of battle turns, the guerillas will pivot to preventing the invaders' retreat, entrapping them so that they may be smashed on the partisan anvil by the hammer of our counterattacking armies."
KIR_FORCES_1:0 "Kirian Esprit de Corps"
KIR_FORCES_1_desc:0 "Our special forces can tip the scales in our favour during the war. If we keep their morale high, they'll be able to perform to their best capability, therefore we need to ensure they are always satisfied with their work and ready to fight for Kiria."
KIR_FORCES_2:0 "Left-Behind Snipers"
KIR_FORCES_2_desc:0 "Even if our enemies manage to penetrate into our land, we can use small marksmare brigades, left behind the enemy lines on the occupied territories. They would ensure that the enemy can't hold on to the occupied land so easily, and show the conquered kirin that there is still hope."
KIR_FORCES_3:0 "Designated Marksmares"
KIR_FORCES_3_desc:0 "Trained snipers can be incredibly beneficial for our armies, able to spot enemies and attack them from great distances, giving our soldiers room to breathe. By training marksmares and incorporating them into our divisions, we will gain a significant edge in battle."

KIR_FORCES_4:0 "The Alpine Corps"
KIR_FORCES_4_desc:0 "Around Vermilion, and on our borders with the deer and llamas in the north, Kiria is covered in steep mountains. While they are already irreplaceable for defensive purposes, trained mountaineer corps could also use them to our advantage for daring attacks. Unlike our enemies, we know these mountains, and it's time to make use of it."
KIR_MELEE:0 "Traditional Swordsmareship"
KIR_MELEE_desc:0 "Though melee weaponry in most nations was mostly replaced with rifles decades ago, and even Kiria starts to embrace this change, our vanguards are one of the best swordsmares in the entire world. Instead of abandoning this tradition, we should teach the vanguards how to incorporate their weapons in the hit-and-gallop tactics."
KIR_VANGUARD:0 "The Vanguard Elite"
KIR_VANGUARD_desc:0 "The vanguards were and still are the fastest, deadliest, and most well-trained soldiers in our army. We need to make sure of their centuries of experience and tradition, in order to provide significant support for our regular army. We'll train them to be deadly units, adapted to modernity, yet still representing Kirian traditions."
KIR_PARAS:0 "The Parachute Rangers"
KIR_PARAS_desc:0 "The advent of aviation gave us access to many new tactics, that were previously not possible. One of them is using specialized banners that would drop behind enemy lines to wreak havoc. If we focus on training such divisions and creating ways to supply them better, it'll allow them to operate on enemy territory more efficiently."
KIR_BORDER:0 "The Frontiersmare Armed Service"
KIR_BORDER_desc:0 "Kiria's borders are long and behind them are many creatures who would gladly take a piece of our Realm. We cannot devote the entirety of our army to protecting them all the time. We need to establish regiments of Frontiersmare, brave kirin who would patrol our borders, warn us of an incoming invasion, and be the first to stave it off."
KIR_CONSCRIPTION:0 "Realm Conscription Ordinance"
KIR_CONSCRIPTION_desc:0 "If Kiria is attacked, we need to have enough marepower to defend it properly. We'll introduce new laws that will allow us to draft a significant chunk of our population to the army. However, forcing the kirin to constantly serve is not only not the harmonist way, but it would also be demoralizing to our citizens. Therefore, those laws can only be enacted during wartime."

Unfortunately, due to the still-lingering effects of The Silence, we do not have a lot of experience with their use for military purposes. Thankfully, our generals believe that those shortcomings should be easy to make up for if we give it enough time."
KIR_SUPPORT_2:0 "Onhooves Supply Lines"
KIR_SUPPORT_2_desc:0 "The vastness of Kiria, combined with its dense forests and steep mountains, can make properly supplying troops a logistical nightmare. However, we can mobilize small groups of onhooves porters that would be in charge of delivering supplies to our troops in difficult areas. They wouldn't be as effective as a truck or a train, but they could reach places where those would fail us."
KIR_SUPPORT_3:0 "Pacification Police"
KIR_SUPPORT_3_desc:0 "In the event of war, we might be forced to occupy portions of the enemy's territory to achieve victory. In that case, we would have to develop methods of handling the local population. We cannot be too harsh to them and make them see us as their enemies, but we must also be strict enough to ensure they would not disturb our further military operations."
KIR_MILITIA:0 "Territorial Volunteers"
KIR_MILITIA_desc:0 "During wartime, it is very likely that even the non-conscripted kirin will want to support our war effort and take up arms in the defense of Kiria. It would be a good idea to allow them to channel this fervor and form the divisions of territorial volunteers, should the need arise."
KIR_NAVY_1:0 "River Gunboats"
KIR_NAVY_1_desc:0 "The Great Mellifluve and other rivers are the lifeblood of Kiria. It is crucial that we learn how to utilize them not only for trading but also for military purposes. Through the use of gunboats, our armies will be able to navigate and attack through the rivers with unmatched efficiency."
KIR_NAVY_2:0 "The Fragrance Admiralty"
KIR_NAVY_2_desc:0 "Fragrance used to be the center of Kiria's maritime power before The Silence. Even nowadays, a kirin can find the sunken ships from the old mothballed fleet near its coast. It is only natural that we help the city return to its former glory as the Realm's main port and the seat of power of its admiralty."
KIR_NAVY_3:0 "Native Naval Designs"
KIR_NAVY_3_desc:0 "It's no secret that Kiria's navy is severely outdated, having been mothballed for over a century of The Silence. We need to focus on importing and developing more new ship blueprints as soon as possible, and adapt them to the needs of the Realm."
KIR_NAVY_4:0 "Modern Junks-of-War"
KIR_NAVY_4_desc:0 "The Fragrance Enterprise had always been the main supplier of the ships for the matriarchate. Should we subsidize it, we can use it to quickly and efficiently create a brand new fleet of modern Junk-of-Wars."

We have a lot of catching up to do, including building new air bases and studying imported plane designs and the theories of air warfare. However, the kirin in the military are optimistic that we'll manage to catch up and create proper Kirian Air Corps in no time!"
KIR_AIR_2:0 "The Wingluck Whirlwind"
KIR_AIR_2_desc:0 "The Wingluck Consortium, despite coming from beyond Kiria, has been the main force behind the development of the new Kirian air force.

If used properly, we could tip the scales in our favor significantly. Of course, due to our lack of experience with the planes in general, we need to thoroughly study the strategy first, so that we will not accidentally bomb our soldiers."
KIR_SOLDIERY_1:0 "Permanent and Professional"
KIR_SOLDIERY_1_desc:0 "The recent reforms to our army are already showing effects! The soldiers are much more effective, well-trained, and disciplined than in the past. It is time we finalize the army reforms and truly establish a permanent, professional army of the Realm."
KIR_SOLDIERY_2:0 "Onhooves Grenadiers"
KIR_SOLDIERY_2_desc:0 "Grenades are definitively one of the most useful, albeit dangerous, inventions brought by advancements in warfare. We can use qualified grenadiers who would be able to support our infantry on the battlefield. We just need time to train them to ensure there will be as efficient and safe as possible."
KIR_SOLDIERY_3:0 "Assault Barding"
KIR_SOLDIERY_3_desc:0 "The barding commonly used in our army is both highly protective and durable, but it limits its wearer's movements. However, recently our armor designers came up with a scheme for a new type of barding that would sacrifice some of its defensiveness for greater mobility. A switch to this new armor during assaults would afford our soldiers faster and more aggressive attacks on the enemy lines."

We lack not only the tanks themselves but also capable personnel able to operate them efficiently. We cannot expect that our enemies will be as far behind as us, so something needs to change in this regard."
KIR_ARMOUR_2:0 "Mechanized Fire Support"
KIR_ARMOUR_2_desc:0 "Mechanized infantry divisions, while costly in production and maintenance, can be very useful on the battlefield. Therefore, we should do whatever we can to maximize their potential. Focusing our resources on developing state-of-the-art turreted vehicles is certainly a step in the right direction."

With the Silence ripped away haphazardly, a braying cacophony of dissent and war now rings in the ears of everykirin.

KIR_civil_war_focus_2b:0 "The Emergency Decree"
KIR_civil_war_focus_2b_desc:0 "Though they may pontificate about their benevolent intentions, the Serene Tendency is a hegemon in Kirian politics. It was a common occurrence for Autumn Blaze to even reach out to the NAKP to avoid ceding influence to the Circle. Such concerns are mere memories now, and the unshakeable devotion of the Serene Tendency is precisely what we need to cool the flames which draw closer each day."
KIR_civil_war_focus_3a:0 "The Party's Resources"

It is one of many sacrifices necessary to survive, not just to prevent the disintegration of the party, but to rescue Kiria itself."

KIR_civil_war_focus_3b_desc:0 "The drums of war beat heavy in the distance as Fern Flare gives a peremptory order to Winter Frost and her Serene Tendency to mobilize fully.

Traitors tremble in fear to the beat of hooves marching under Concord's banner."

KIR_civil_war_focus_3s_desc:0 "In the lives of today's kirin, and their grandsires, and their grandsires before them, the Matriarch Superior was always apart. An untouchable, inaccessible figure, nearly divine to her devoted subjects. Such a foolish tradition in retrospect, now that a generation marches to die in her name. The people must know who they fight for, and remember what their efforts mean."
KIR_civil_war_focus_4a:0 "Invoke the Accord"
KIR_civil_war_focus_4a_desc:0 "When the Equestrians Fluttershy and Applejack stepped hoof into the shining Vermilion Realm, they came bearing one philosophy: Harmony.

If those distant ponies hold to both their word as protectors of harmony, then we expect aid in short order."

KIR_civil_war_focus_5a:0 "Form the Thunderbolts"
KIR_civil_war_focus_5a_desc:0 "Even the skies roar their resentment towards the traitors as the first Kirian air squadron in history, the Thunderbolts, arrives on the battlefield.

KIR_civil_war_focus_5b:0 "The Loyal Diaspora"
KIR_civil_war_focus_5b_desc:0 "Kiria is not just a nation; it is an idea, a hope. A dream of harmony between kirin, of prosperity, of peace. This is something that Fickle Current and his band of fickle traitors could never understand. A better Kiria cannot be bought, it cannot be produced by a factory. It is in the soul and spirit of those who remain loyal, even in the face of temptation, to the Matriarch Superior."
KIR_civil_war_focus_5c:0 "The Territorial Volunteers"
KIR_civil_war_focus_5c_desc:0 "In war, there are no easy choices. With a heavy heart Rain Shine has approved the formation of a new quasi-military detachment labeled the Territorial Volunteers. By definition composed of those unfit for standard military service, the Territorials serve as a reserve garrison force, the final, ragged line of defense when all else is lost."
KIR_civil_war_focus_5d:0 "Reforging the Banners"
KIR_civil_war_focus_5d_desc:0 "The specter of war has not haunted Kiria for centuries, permitting the once-magnificent Thousand Banners to wither away like flowers come wintertime. When compared with the unyielding unit of a modern professional army, a group of part-time soldiers qualified only by their lineage looks pathetic. Our straits are dire; nevertheless, we must at least attempt to bridge the gap."
KIR_civil_war_focus_5e:0 "Raise Rural Resistance"
KIR_civil_war_focus_5e_desc:0 "While the ideology of the secessionists is by nature confined mostly to the regions they control, devotion to the Matriarch Superior transcends regional boundaries.

KIR_civil_war_focus_5f:0 "Purge Corrupting Influences"
KIR_civil_war_focus_5f_desc:0 "Just as fire can warm a house or cook food, it can devour and destroy should it burn too bright. In such a manner, the Rising Fire has become a raging inferno, some twisting the original precepts of the Way of Fire far beyond anykirin's wildest nightmares. We are drowning in heresy, and to survive, we must jettison the most extreme weights holding us back."
KIR_civil_war_focus_6a:0 "A Grim Reunion"
KIR_civil_war_focus_6a_desc:0 "Surrounded by a swirling maelstrom of death, a spark of hope returns with Applejack, an Equestrian element of harmony and the pony perhaps most responsible for the revolutionary events in recent Kirian history.

KIR_civil_war_focus_6b_desc:0 "A relatively peripheral region of Kiria, the Maretime Range is sequestered from the areas most directly threatened by the war. Stifled by the Silence, it was a strip of fallow land devoid of industry. Now, guarded by the near-impenetrable Quartz Mountains to the west, the Range must serve as the nucleus of emergency naval production, fortified by the strongest protection on short notice."

KIR_civil_war_focus_6d:0 "Resolute Defence"
KIR_civil_war_focus_6d_desc:0 "Despite the initial shock, we maintain an advantageous position in most senses compared to the insurgents. The theory prevailing in the high command is that stalemate is a defeat for the opposition. Digging our hooves in is the most surefire way to win this war."
KIR_civil_war_focus_6e:0 "Inquisitor-Confessors"
KIR_civil_war_focus_6e_desc:0 "Today, devotion is in short supply. There yet remains one group that remains unfaltering in its faith, however. Those Way of Fire monks trained in the fundamentalist tradition are servants, body and soul, to the will of Concord and the Matriarch Superior. Though unleashing them may be dangerous, Kiria will be able to rest easy knowing that heresy and treason will soon be the faintest of memories."

KIR_civil_war_focus_6f_desc:0 "The most martially talented and supremely dedicated of Kiria's monks, known as the Serene Mystics, swear a magically-binding oath to defend Concord and Her chosen with all they are. Should they betray this oath, it is said, holy flame slowly immolates them from the inside. Whatever the case, their wrath in battle is terrible to behold, and galvanizes our forces."
KIR_civil_war_focus_7a:0 "The Student Volunteers"
KIR_civil_war_focus_7a_desc:0 "An entire generation marches to battle, propelled by the eternal, vigorous flame of youth. Thousands will die, thousands of mothers may grieve, and yet some will live.

Our Kiria cannot die, for it lives on in every youth who stands unflinchingly for what is right."

KIR_civil_war_focus_7b_desc:0 "While pressure may not turn coal into diamonds, it sure has a similar effect on the efforts of our scientists. Whereas the lethargic blanket of the Silence caused innovation to meander to a halt, under the catastrophic pressure of civil war advancements in the field of killing proceeds at breakneck speed. Against all odds, Kiria hurled haphazardly into the modern world, has landed on its hooves."

When the fires of war raged ever closer to Vermilion, devout followers of the Way of Fire were the first to give their lives in defense. All look to Winter Frost, the mare who led Kiria from its darkest hour. The hour of Concord has arrived, and Her Way is glorious indeed!"
KIR_civil_war_focus_7x:0 "Strong, Stable, Serene" ##For Rising Fire loyalist path - exclusive with 7e
KIR_civil_war_focus_7x_desc:0 "Vermilion's recognition of the Rising Fire was necessitated by the exigencies of war, but the Serene Tendency, led by Winter Frost, has maintained its firm grip on the Way of Fire, successfully protecting the kirin faith against spiritual contamination by Rising Sun's band of quasi-reformed heretics. The old ways have stood the test of time and modernity and have prevailed in Concord's name."
KIR_civil_war_focus_8a:0 "Call Up the Cadets"
KIR_civil_war_focus_8a_desc:0 "Fresh out of military academies realm-wide, regiments of young kirin will bloom upon the field against Kiria's greatest perils. Refusing to be enslaved by the material world's trapping, they shall lay their lives down for those who remain."

## Triumvirate branch
KIR_civil_war_focus_3x:0 "The Fire Rising"
KIR_civil_war_focus_3x_desc:0 "The Rising Fire has taken up arms and stands ready to throw back the NAKP's corruption. While yesterday we were enemies, today we stand together despite their iconoclasm towards the Way of Fire."
KIR_civil_war_focus_4g:0 "Unlikely Comrades"
KIR_civil_war_focus_4g_desc:0 "The leftists and heretics of the Rising Fire were warning us about the NAKP's greed and their corruption of Kiria for the entirety of the Autumnal Premiership. And much to our dismay, they were right. But despite that, they've shown up for us now, and we are now allies, or comrades in the parlance of some of their members, in the struggle for Kiria's soul."
KIR_civil_war_focus_4h:0 "The West Awakens"
KIR_civil_war_focus_4h_desc:0 "The Western Territories have always been the Rising Fire's base of power, operating out of its rural communities and urban centers, long cut off from Vermilion by the Silence. Rising Sun can call up legions of followers from these provinces and we would be fools to reject them in the fight against Fickle Current's mercenaries."
KIR_civil_war_focus_5g:0 "The Verdant Concurrence"
KIR_civil_war_focus_5g_desc:0 "As the Rising Fire has become more and more essential to our war effort, Rising Sun has placed more and more pressure on Autumn Blaze, and in turn, Rain Shine, to grant the Rising Fire more concessions. Verdant, their largest stronghold, will be given full religious independence from the Serene Tendency for the kirin of the west to continue to fight."
KIR_civil_war_focus_5h:0 "The Chrysanthemum Concession"
KIR_civil_war_focus_5h_desc:0 "As the Rising Fire continues to lend the Realm their unwavering support through thick or thin, victory or defeat, their demands become more ambitious and harder to ignore. Autumn Blaze has been forced to expand Verdant's religious autonomy to many other Rising Fire strongholds in the west, as the Serene Tendency's theocratic monopoly crumbles under wartime necessity."
KIR_civil_war_focus_6g:0 "Temporal Co-Rulership"
KIR_civil_war_focus_6g_desc:0 "By Matriarchal Decree from Rain Shine herself, the greatest fears of the Serene Tendency have come to pass. The Rising Fire, with Rising Sun at their head, have been granted co-equal status with the Serene Tendency, enjoying the same rights and powers that had long been the exclusive privilege of the Hierocracy for centuries."
KIR_civil_war_focus_6h:0 "Develop the Interior"
KIR_civil_war_focus_6h_desc:0 "Kiria's western interior, long neglected under the Silence and underdeveloped during the failed Great Gallop Onwards, has always been a comparatively less prosperous region when compared with Greater Providence or the Cradle of Kirinity. But with Providence lost and the Cradle threatened by war, the interior, with its iconoclastic kirin, are what we must make do with."
KIR_civil_war_focus_7e:0 "The Ascendant Triumvir"
KIR_civil_war_focus_7e_desc:0 "Rising Sun's influence in Vermilion has reached its peak, and the Serene Tendency is on the back hoof. Having shown their loyalty and mettle, Rising Fire has finally taken its rightful place in the halls of power. Rising Sun strides across the Secretariat floor with the same confidence and majesty she has always possessed, but when she passes, even the mystics of the Hierocracy must bend their horns to her."

# Council of North Kiria #
KIR_council_focus_1:0 "Deliverance of the North"
KIR_council_focus_1_desc:0 "Free from the misguided and foolish court of Vermilion, it is up to Chairkirin Fickle Current to steer the Emergency Council of North Kiria through the troubling times ahead. But first, we must decide how to approach Vermilion: with flowers of peace, or flowers of war?"
KIR_council_focus_2a:0 "Patriotic Obligation"
KIR_council_focus_2a_desc:0 "The Realm of Kiria is the home of all kirin, and it is our duty as a species to safeguard its prosperity. However, the corrupt clergy that controls the Matriarch Superior and the seat of power in Vermilion cannot be reasoned with. We must free the Matriarch by force and restore the Realm to peace!"
KIR_council_focus_2b:0 "Loyal to the Homeland"
KIR_council_focus_2b_desc:0 "Though we may have claimed our independence, the Matriarch Superior is and always will be the spiritual leader of the kirin people. She is Concord's avatar on earth, and to let her fall is not only an affront to the Realm, but to Her very heavens themselves. We must cooperate with Vermilion to secure the safety of the Matriarch and in turn, peacefully secure our future."
KIR_council_focus_treasury:0 "Inspect the Treasury"
KIR_council_focus_treasury_desc:0 "The NAKP is, in effect, an extension of the interests of the many corporate donors and partners that keep Fragrance solvent and our nation running. As such, we can leverage the significant financial resources of our prestigious corporate partners to achieve economic feats the rest of the Realm can only dream of. We just have to make sure we stay in the black and everything will be fine..."
KIR_council_focus_army:0 "Mobilise the Party"
KIR_council_focus_army_desc:0 "The NAKP is only as strong and financially stable as its members, and like a saturated market, they need to be encouraged from time to time to contribute to our coffers so we can continue to grow. By incentivizing the kirin of the Greater Providence region to increase their contributions to the party, we will be able to extend our reach into sectors previously closed to us."
KIR_council_focus_3a:0 "The Northern Compact"
KIR_council_focus_3a_desc:0 "If Fragrance will ever command enough might to guarantee our independence from Vermilion, we must tempt the other major population centers of the north away from Vermilion's rule. Championing the unique cultural differences that separate us from the kirin of the heartlands and fostering the notion of a Greater Providence will be key to making this dream a reality."
KIR_council_focus_3b:0 "Picking Up the Pieces"
KIR_council_focus_3b_desc:0 "The Grand Gallop Onward and its consequences have been a disaster for the kirin race. However, using money from the NAKP's treasury, we can begin to pick up the pieces and attempt to build back better and stronger. We will hire new workers, import new machines, and subsidize new industry to overcome Vermilion's failure in modernizing our society."
KIR_council_focus_4a:0 "The Verdant Glens"
KIR_council_focus_4a_desc:0 "Despite all of Fragrance's wealth and power, it is still a dense urban city, with little in the way of agriculture within its jurisdiction. However, the provinces of Apricot Glen and Vernal Glade just up the Carmine River are filled with fertile farmland. It is imperative that we win over Fragrance's backyard and bring this land into the fold."
KIR_council_focus_4b:0 "Rhapsodic Overtures"
KIR_council_focus_4b_desc:0 "Rhapsody is Kiria's largest city by a large margin, and as such, it is incredibly important that we bring it into the fold if we hope to survive against Vermilion's inevitable overtures for reunification. The city is ruled by an entrenched religious group known as the Procurate, but should we focus our efforts on appeasing them or appealing to their citizens?"
KIR_council_focus_4c:0 "Fund Northern Development"
KIR_council_focus_4c_desc:0 "We have planted the seed for a renewed industrialization effort in the north; now it is time to water it and watch it grow. We must be willing to commit even more resources and funding to our nascent industries if we want to see them grow to new heights and drag Kiria out of destitution and poverty."
KIR_council_focus_4d:0 "Aid from the Diaspora"
KIR_council_focus_4d_desc:0 "Our greatest resource is our connections to the many wealthy members of the Kirin Diaspora, descendants of those who fled the Realm at the imposition of the Silence a century ago and who only prospered with their new businesses in Griffonia and Equus. The NAKP was made by and for this wealthy diaspora—how about we remind them of this fact with a few fundraising banquets and balls?"
KIR_council_focus_5a:0 "Kiria's Radiant Coast"
KIR_council_focus_5a_desc:0 "The city of Radiance has historically been the main port for foreign dignitaries visiting Vermilion from abroad, but the Silence reduced it to a dying backwater. Nowadays, it is home to a unique blend of northern natives and the returning members of the Kirin Diaspora, giving the city a unique identity that we must find a way to exploit to encourage it to throw its lot in with Fragrance."
KIR_council_focus_5b:0 "Court the Procurate"
KIR_council_focus_5b_desc:0 "Rhapsody's Procurate is the key to making significant headway in aligning the city's desires with our own. However, Rhapsody surely sees themselves as our equals, if not our betters. Despite how foolish such a notion may be, we must be sure to keep the Procurate happy if we want their cooperation during the plebiscite."
KIR_council_focus_5c:0 "Provisional Industrial Central Planning"
KIR_council_focus_5c_desc:0 "If we want to get the most out of our economy, we must be willing to find which of our partners have been underperforming and give them a firm squeeze to make up for the difference. Our corporate partners are incredibly important to the function of the NAKP, but they can be quite stingy when it comes to spreading the wealth around. Perhaps we should nationalize some of their assets to get the most out of them?"
KIR_council_focus_5d:0 "Secure Our Power Base"
KIR_council_focus_5d_desc:0 "With all the time and money we have focused on winning over the surrounding states of Greater Providence that still profess loyalty to Vermilion, we cannot forget to pay attention to those that have already declared for us in and around Fragrance. But what is the best way to do that: a broader campaign in our cities, or diverting funding into tangible quality of life improvements?"
KIR_council_focus_5e:0 "Radio Free Kiria"
KIR_council_focus_5e_desc:0 "The radio is one of our most important tools in pushing the party message out to our citizens and securing their loyalty by ensuring that they hear what we want them to hear. But it could be used as a tool for profit as well, supposing we allow anykirin to buy time on the airwaves. But is such an investment worth the risks?"
KIR_council_focus_6a:0 "Plebiscite for Northern Self-Determination"
KIR_council_focus_6a_desc:0 "The pollsters have been hard at work, and we have invested significant capital in drumming up support for the Plebiscite for Northern Self-Determination. It is time to allow the kirin of Greater Providence to vote on their future.\n\n§RThere is no turning back now.§!"
KIR_council_focus_6b:0 "The City-State Economy"
KIR_council_focus_6b_desc:0 "The ultimate ideal in a self-sustaining and growing economy requires our urban and industrial centers to be fully independent and equipped with everything they need to turn a profit. The number one roadblock to such efforts, however, is an insufficient labor pool. We shall encourage the poor kirin of the countryside to move into the cities where they can be more useful to our economic machine."
KIR_council_focus_6c:0 "Resume Industrialisation"
KIR_council_focus_6c_desc:0 "Now that we have finally achieved momentum on reversing the disastrous failure of the Grand Gallop Onward, we are beginning to see some of the fruits of our labor. The engine of industry is now running on its own, and it will only continue to grow stronger by the day."
KIR_council_focus_7a:0 "The Northern Economic Rebound"
KIR_council_focus_7a_desc:0 "The industrial capacity of the north is unmatched, as is the tenacity of our people. We have persevered through the economic crisis and the rumblings of a market collapse, and come out the other side stronger for it. It is time to celebrate because Fragrance has achieved what Vermilion never could: the successful rejuvenation of kirin industry and our entrepreneurial spirit!"
KIR_council_focus_7b:0 "Educate the New Generation"
KIR_council_focus_7b_desc:0 "It is the duty of the old generation to educate and make way for the new. Today, the first children of the Diaspora are being foaled on kirin shores, marking the successful return of Kiria's long-lost sons and daughters. It is imperative that we provide them the best education we can afford to give them all the tools they need to succeed in this brave new world we have made for them."

KIS_reconcile_focus_1a:0 "Hold a Party Congress"
KIS_reconcile_focus_1a_desc:0 "To achieve independence while remaining supportive of Vermilion is a task that will require careful juggling of priorities, promises, and practicality. We must hold a party congress with the entirety of the NAKP's leadership to outline our plans and make sure that we maintain our cohesion in these confusing times."
KIS_reconcile_focus_1b:0 "The Twin Flowers Movement"
KIS_reconcile_focus_1b_desc:0 "Vermilion, like Fragrance, is a beautiful and vibrant flower, but it risks being cut down by the lawn mower of the Rising Fire's heresy. If all of Kiria is to one day become a beautiful garden, we must stand with Vermilion against the threat from the west and let the future bloom."
KIS_reconcile_focus_2a:0 "One Kiria Declaration"
KIS_reconcile_focus_2a_desc:0 "As there is only one goddess in the heavens and one Matriarch on earth, so too is their only one Kiria to protect. Though we may have severed our political engines from Vermilion's devices, we are still kirin living in the Realm of Kiria, and so it is our duty to return peace and prosperity to its fragrant fields and verdant valleys."
KIS_reconcile_focus_2b:0 "Democratise the Association"
KIS_reconcile_focus_2b_desc:0 "As we move to loosely entwine our people with the idea of a safe and secure Vermilion, we must be willing to democratize the NAKP in some measure. To make sure that we do not lose our way during this cooperation, the people must be allowed to express their opinions through the vote, and thus help chart the NAKP's course alongside the planning of our Chairkirin."
KIS_reconcile_focus_3a:0 "The Assembly of North Kiria"
KIS_reconcile_focus_3a_desc:0 "The Assembly, a loyal and toothless paradox of a tool — a legislature whose decrees are not binding; that proudly proclaims its independence from the Association, yet gathers only occasionally at the Chairkirin's behest; the (albeit democratically-elected) representatives of which travel to Fragrance on the Party member's dime, to discuss the Party's agenda within the Party's capitol."
KIS_reconcile_focus_3b:0 "Prune the Iron Chrysanthemum"
KIS_reconcile_focus_3b_desc:0 "The Iron Chrysanthemum is, at best, a group of enthusiastic patriots, or at worst, an armed gang of thugs willing to get their hooves dirty at the NAKP's bidding (and gold). Let us nip any potential problems in the bud by officially incorporating the Order as a paramilitary branch of the NAKP, complete with its strict chain of command and training to keep it under control."
KIS_reconcile_focus_4:0 "A Northern Constitution"
KIS_reconcile_focus_4_desc:0 "Our new constitution will be the first in the world to classify corporations as creatures and codify their rights alongside those of our citizens. Foremost among their rights is the right to pursue their interests unfettered by policy and regulation. While some might draw issue with the lack of workers' protections, people aren't as profitable as corporations are."
KIS_reconcile_focus_5a:0 "Parting Ways"
KIS_reconcile_focus_5a_desc:0 "We have accomplished what we have long sought after: the independence of Fragrance from the rule of Vermilion. But it is a muted affair, devoid of fanfare, as we separate from Vermilion peacefully in exchange for pledging our support for the Realm against the Rising Fire in the west. But at least we're free, right?"
KIS_reconcile_focus_5b:0 "The Junior Partner"
KIS_reconcile_focus_5b_desc:0 "War with Vermilion will be destructive and dangerous, and we have little hope of standing on our own. Perhaps we should arrange some limited return of Fragrance to Vermilion's rule. While guaranteeing most of our rights and independence, we will still be expected to kneel before our rivals... but isn't this preferable to the alternative?"
KIS_reconcile_focus_6a:0 "The Peony Accords"
KIS_reconcile_focus_6a_desc:0 "If we are to defeat the Rising Fire, we must formalize our cooperation with Vermilion. The Peony Accords will arrange for the creation of the Kirian United Front, and as we march together in unity, Rising Sun must know that her time as the bane of Kiria's existence is coming to an end."
KIS_reconcile_focus_6b:0 "Enshrine Our Autonomy"
KIS_reconcile_focus_6b_desc:0 "We are well on the way to codifying our autonomy, and soon we can make our bold proclamation into legal reality. But a legal code means little to the average kirin of Greater Providence. We should instead make this legal declaration something tangible that they can witness with their own eyes. Perhaps the leftover pieces of the Grand Gallop Onward are a good place to start..."
KIS_reconcile_focus_7a:0 "Promote Regionalism"
KIS_reconcile_focus_7a_desc:0 "Greater Providence is something of a patchwork of regions with different laws and traditions, and administering it as a common whole is a nightmare, to say the least. A blanket approach is impossible, so we have no choice but to let the regions grow independently, at the behest of the free market. Maybe we could speed that development up with some investment?"
KIS_reconcile_focus_7b:0 "The Viceroyalty"
KIS_reconcile_focus_7b_desc:0 "It is time to officially reconcile our relationship with Vermilion. Our diplomats have agreed upon the terms of the establishment of a Viceroyalty in the north and the guarantee of our autonomy. Chairkirin Fickle Current will serve as the first Vermilion Viceroy and will lead a parallel government to Vermilion, but at the end of the day, we still acknowledge the supremacy of the Matriarch's domain."
KIS_reconcile_focus_7c:0 "The Viceroyal Banners"
KIS_reconcile_focus_7c_desc:0 "Now that we have settled the diplomatic matters necessary to establish our Viceroyalty, it is time to focus on improving our military cooperation with Vermilion. We shall establish a system of viceroyal banners using soldiers provided by Vermilion and equip them with modern equipment produced here at home to represent the first of our joint military ventures."
KIS_reconcile_focus_8:0 "The Confederal Union"
KIS_reconcile_focus_8_desc:0 "With the matter of our independence secured and settled, we should reorganize our territory into a more efficient nation effectively led by the NAKP. Though we claim legitimacy through the deference to Matriarch Superior Rain Shine in all spiritual matters, this is in reality simply lip service, and the Matriarch does not influence affairs within our borders."
KIS_reconcile_focus_8a:0 "The Confederal Guard"
KIS_reconcile_focus_8a_desc:0 "Through the charitable donations of some of our most wealthy patrons and party members, we have organized the funds to acquire state-of-the-art Griffonian artillery pieces and motorized equipment. These arms will go a long way toward our efforts to put an end to the menace of the Rising Fire."
KIS_reconcile_focus_9:0 "The War of Containment"
KIS_reconcile_focus_9_desc:0 "The Rising Fire is a threat that we must contain before it spreads out of control like a raging wildfire. We shall fight alongside Vermilion to put it down, but we should also keep in mind that a strong Vermilion may not be to our benefit. Perhaps it may be better to contain the Rising Fire instead of extinguishing them to keep Vermilion weak..."
KIS_reconcile_focus_10:0 "The Post-War Settlement"
KIS_reconcile_focus_10_desc:0 "We must make preparations for the end of the War of the Double Secession and the inevitability of our victory by organizing the means to demobilize and settle our affairs in the post-war world. After all, business will be booming, and we best be ready to capitalize on it when the post-war boom starts."
KIS_reconcile_focus_11:0 "A Bastion of Stability"
KIS_reconcile_focus_11_desc:0 "Through our influence, we have helped put an end to the War of the Double Secession. Kiria is stable once more, and the menace of the Rising Fire has been dealt with. We can take pride in knowing that it was by our hoof that peace has returned to the Vermilion Realm, and all the kirin of the Realm will see Greater Providence as its bastion of stability."
KIS_reconcile_focus_12:0 "Reform and Opening"
KIS_reconcile_focus_12_desc:0 "With the business of war behind us, it is time to focus on the business of the future. The Chairkirin has prepared many reforms to pass through the NAKP that will help modernize the north and bring us up to parity with the developed nations of the world, and there's no better time than the present to start passing them."
KIS_reconcile_focus_13:0 "The Kirian Raj"
KIS_reconcile_focus_13_desc:0 "The deer up north are fractious and divided, engaged in internecine strife and unable to govern themselves. We should intervene to lend a strong, guiding hoof to help them rise up and above their history, as we did."

KIR_council_focus_x:0 "The Minutiae of Independence" ##Rage, Rage! 'gainst the Dying of the Light - Commune of Fragrance/Revolutionary Fragrance Focus
KIR_council_focus_x_desc:0 "Independence is more than just a bold statement and patriotic fervor; it takes the combined efforts of dozens of legislators and hundreds, if not thousands, of dedicated kirin to make it a reality. We must fill our administration with competent kirin to ensure that our fledgling nation can stand on its own hooves during this crucial time."
KIR_council_focus_x1a:0 "State-Corporate Partnership"
KIR_council_focus_x1a_desc:0 "The state relies on the corporation to provide it with taxable income and goods to trade with foreign countries, while corporations rely on the state to provide them with a support structure and the means to protect their investments. If we want to get the most out of both, we must make the two all-but inseparable entities to guarantee their effective partnership."
KIR_council_focus_x1b:0 "Office for Economic Development"
KIR_council_focus_x1b_desc:0 "To guarantee the productive independence of the state and the loyalty of our people, we must invest heavily in developing our society along lines that are beneficial to the NAKP and the party's infrastructure. The creation of social programs all championed with a pro-NAKP slant will ensure that our citizens are more firmly supportive of the party."
KIR_council_focus_x2a:0 "Joint Venture for the Port of Sycee"
KIR_council_focus_x2a_desc:0 "The port of Sycee is home to the Sycee Trading House, one of the oldest merchant banks in Kiria, and one of the strongest to survive the disastrous imposition of The Silence. We must work closely with this bank to furnish it with a new and modern home in its original city, and in return, Sycee will allow the state the use of some of its resources and infrastructure."
KIR_council_focus_x2b:0 "Northern Defence Industrial Complex"
KIR_council_focus_x2b_desc:0 "For as long as there is war or at least the prospect of war, the military-industrial complex will remain one of the most profitable business ventures known to creatures across the world. As it so happens, a war in Kiria is a very real prospect, and we are in great need of bolstering our defenses. Perhaps we can come to a mutually beneficial arrangement with the complex..."
KIR_council_focus_x2c:0 "Shelter the People"
KIR_council_focus_x2c_desc:0 "The kirin of the north, and even the weary refugees from the heartlands, need a government willing and able to look after them. By encouraging immigration to the north and spending lavishly to provide for the people, we will grow our population and begin to recoup our investment through a larger source of taxable kirin."
KIR_council_focus_x3:0 "Codify Corporatism"
KIR_council_focus_x3_desc:0 "Like a good business, society is at its most productive when cleanly delineated into its component parts and effectively managed by capable administrators. We shall take this practice one step further and officially codify corporatism into our societal laws, making each sector of our society one self-contained part of an efficient and profitable national machine."
KIR_council_focus_x4a:0 "The Brocade Mining and Resources Consortium"
KIR_council_focus_x4a_desc:0 "Raw materials have been the lifeblood of any nation since the dawn of time, and this has not changed in the modern age. North Kiria is pitifully underdeveloped and woefully unexploited, and so we must rectify this issue immediately. We shall establish a new mining consortium for the prospecting of desperately-needed resources and bring them to our markets as quickly as possible."
KIR_council_focus_x4b:0 "Acquire the Collegium"
KIR_council_focus_x4b_desc:0 "The All-Kiria Collegium was the brainchild of Cypress Snow and Chairkirin Fickle Current, and since our separation from Vermilion, it has languished in a state of decay under the hoof of those unwilling to invest in its success. Let us divert some funds to lure its scholars and staff away from Vermilion and give them a safe haven to continue their valuable work here in Fragrance."
KIR_council_focus_x5:0 "Fuel For Progress"
KIR_council_focus_x5_desc:0 "There is a reason industrialization is often referred to as an engine of societal development: not only does it power the transformation of our society, but it needs fuel of its own to properly function. With precious few resources to fuel the engines of progress in the north, we must invest in alternative means to acquire fuel to keep our economy humming along."

KIR_council_mil_focus_X:0 "Raise the Righteous Regiments"
KIR_council_mil_focus_X_desc:0 "The Righteous Regiments once served as part of Fragrance's local garrison, and their history goes back even further to the days of kirin warlords. Though they have been disbanded since the beginning of the Silence, reinstating these regiments will allow us to call upon the proud history of Fragrance in her defense once more!"
KIR_council_mil_focus_3:0 "Motorization Drive"
KIR_council_mil_focus_3_desc:0 "Trucks will be an important feature of the wars of today and tomorrow, and we are woefully undersupplied at the moment. The ability to quickly carry heavy equipment and supplies to an army extends and enhances our combat missions, all in all creating a stronger and more effective fighting force."
KIR_council_mil_focus_2:0 "Militarize the Cadres"
KIR_council_mil_focus_2_desc:0 "All aspects of our society and government need to, for the time being at least, be fully devoted to the war to come. We must make sure that the current reality is woven into everything we do, reminding our citizens that they need to be ready to fight for their country and that they should devote every day toward achieving victory!"
KIR_council_mil_focus_6:0 "The First Armor Unit"
KIR_council_mil_focus_6_desc:0 "With modern wars being fought with deadly automatic weapons and lethal shrapnel, putting an indestructible monster of steel on the field of battle can overwhelm enemy defenses while protecting our soldiers in the process. Tanks are the future, the armored tip of the spear that will drive through enemy lines, and we need to get them in our armies now!"
KIR_council_mil_focus_4:0 "Analytics Initiative"
KIR_council_mil_focus_4_desc:0 "Information is everything, especially so on the battlefield. Knowing the likely moves of our enemies while keeping our plans a secret can make or break a battle or a war. We must devote extra effort to our analytics departments to ensure that we gain as much of an intelligence advantage over our foes as we can!"
KIR_council_mil_focus_5:0 "War of Position"
KIR_council_mil_focus_5_desc:0 "Gone are the days when two large armies would smash against each other in an open field, with the loser fleeing in disarray. Modern armies are simply too large to bring to bear all at once, and so taking and holding key positions is the way that wars will be decided. Improving the ability of our forces to move to strategic locations and defend them against enemy attack will be the key to success."
KIR_council_mil_focus_1:0 "Fragrance Aerodrome"
KIR_council_mil_focus_1_desc:0 "The ability to fight in the skies and rain death down on an enemy from above was something only griffons and pegasi could do for the longest time. But with the invention of the aeroplane, that capability is now something that any species can achieve. If we control the skies, then we control our fate!"

KIR_militarist_focus_1a:0 "Northern Armament"
KIR_militarist_focus_1a_desc:0 "If we are going to fight, and more importantly, win a war against both Vermilion and the Rising Fire communists, we must embark upon a massive industrialization and conscription drive to put a capable army in the field. Through encouraging patriotic donations and a conscription lottery, we will fill both our coffers and the ranks of our armies at once!"
KIR_militarist_focus_1b:0 "Provident Destiny"
KIR_militarist_focus_1b_desc:0 "We are amazing creatures, the chosen creations of Concord, the embodiment of Her will, and the custodians of the final spark of the Primordial Flame that birthed the world.

KIR_militarist_focus_2:0 "Mobilize the Literati"
KIR_militarist_focus_2_desc:0 "Where the rest of the Realm of Kiria is filled with poor peasants and religious figures, Fragrance is a haven for the intelligentsia of the kirin race. Our enlightened and wealthy people shall pave the way for innovation and solutions to age-old problems, giving us an edge over the intellectually stagnant holds of the Matriarch and Rising Sun."
KIR_militarist_focus_3a:0 "A Firm Hoof"
KIR_militarist_focus_3a_desc:0 "Our greatest resource is the backing of the corporations that support the NAKP, but they can be incredibly stingy and selfish, loathe to part with money or machinery. We should remind them that the free market isn't exactly free, and they should be willing to donate some of their manufacturing capacity for our armament effort if they don't want to deal with new tax hikes."
KIR_militarist_focus_3b:0 "Death's Head Brigades"
KIR_militarist_focus_3b_desc:0 "The Order of the Iron Chrysanthemum is currently little more than a rag-tag band of street thugs and criminals operating on the NAKP's gold, and hardly what one would call a professional fighting force. But what if we change that? Given some actual training and competent command, we could turn the Order into a powerful fighting force to call upon in the war to come."

KIR_militarist_focus_4a_desc:0 "The free market is great and all, but in a struggle of life and death, wasting resources on producing frivolous things is hardly the solution to keeping our country safe. We should more forcefully insist that our industrial concerns dedicate their efforts toward the products we want them to make, at least until we have emerged victorious."
KIR_militarist_focus_4b:0 "Pro Patria Mori"
KIR_militarist_focus_4b_desc:0 "Is it not the greatest glory to die for one's country? Is there anything more rewarding than to give one's life in service of returning Kiria to the glory that Concord promised us? Death in battle is nothing to fear, for we shall all return to Concord's flames when we die, and become one with the fires of creation once more. Arm yourselves, and fight for your country!"
KIR_militarist_focus_5a:0 "Overseas Investors"
KIR_militarist_focus_5a_desc:0 "We have many contacts in Griffonia that would be willing to lend us money, equipment, and perhaps even military support, should we come to them with an acceptable deal. By providing land and resources as collateral, we can satisfy potential Griffonian investors in our cause. Or perhaps we could turn our attention further westward..."
KIR_militarist_focus_5b:0 "The Reliable Party"
KIR_militarist_focus_5b_desc:0 "The NAKP is primarily funded by the donations of our wealthy party members and the party dues the corporations pay to us. But with a war on the horizon, what they currently donate is not enough. These are some of the wealthiest kirin in the world, though; surely they can spare a bit more money for the party?"
KIR_militarist_focus_5c:0 "Corporate Freeholds"
KIR_militarist_focus_5c_desc:0 "We must encourage the corporations to increase their donations to the party treasury in the name of patriotism, and our propaganda efforts are already putting public pressure on them to do so. But it would not do to anger the corporations, lest they leave the nation entirely. Therefore, we need to provide some kind of incentive to get them to pay up and stay..."
KIR_militarist_focus_6a:0 "The Liaison Office for Military Commissions"
KIR_militarist_focus_6a_desc:0 "With regional conflicts erupting throughout the world, there is no shortage of mercenary companies willing to fight for the highest bidder. Though negotiating with mercenaries and brigands is beneath us, if we simply set up an official office to negotiate with "official military commissions", we could hire the expertise of these experts of war with no difficulty at all."
KIR_militarist_focus_6b:0 "The Directorate of Production"
KIR_militarist_focus_6b_desc:0 "We must continue to streamline and organize the armament effort of our company, and the best way to do that is to set up the Directorate of Production. This office will instruct our industrial base on exactly what we need to produce to win the war, and will ensure that the rigid quotas it establishes are met through any means necessary."
KIR_militarist_focus_7a:0 "Quid Pro Quo"
KIR_militarist_focus_7a_desc:0 "If there is one universal truth, it is that anything can be accomplished by throwing enough money at it. Thus, we should follow these wise words and throw enough money at our infrastructure and industrial problems to hurry these projects up."
KIR_militarist_focus_7b:0 "Crush the Fourth Column"
KIR_militarist_focus_7b_desc:0 "The enemies of Kiria are fourfold; barbarians, degenerates, and infidels without, and the red menace within. Even as we fight the Rising Fire, we must safeguard the homefront against their twisted and subversive lies. We can no longer sit back and allow communist infiltration, indoctrination, subversion, and the international communist conspiracy to sap and impurify all of our precious bodily fluids!"
KIR_militarist_focus_7c:0 "Changeling Largesse"
KIR_militarist_focus_7c_desc:0 "Now that we have agreed to terms with the Changelings, all we have to do is sign off on them with their representative, one businessbug by the name of Finicus Vesali. Though it seems that there might be some... interesting little tidbits tied up into our treaty of cooperation that warrant further examination..."
KIR_militarist_focus_8:0 "For Realm and Rights!"
KIR_militarist_focus_8_desc:0 "The NAKP represents the triumph of the kirin spirit: anykirin can accomplish anything if they set their mind to it, and the free market rewards those with ambition and drive over the lazy in our society. Through our hard work and dedication, we will claim our ultimate destiny: to become the hegemons of Eastern Zebrica that we were always destined to be!"
KIR_militarist_focus_8a:0 "Labour Reform"
KIR_militarist_focus_8a_desc:0 "To encourage the productivity of our laborers, we must offer certain incentives to them. Wonderful policies such as the quota system will tie worker wages to the amount of goods they produce, rewarding productivity, and those that enlist in the service of the military will enjoy luxuries such as 30-minute lunch breaks and weekends off."
KIR_militarist_focus_8b:0 "Wartime Necessity"
KIR_militarist_focus_8b_desc:0 "Nokirin likes taxes, least of all the corporations, but sometimes it's just what we have to do. There will probably be a lot of hurt feelings in increasing the corporate tax rate from 5% to 10%, but if we promise to lower taxes down to 2% afterward, then they'll come around to the idea eventually, right?"
KIR_militarist_focus_8c:0 "Seize Our Destiny"
KIR_militarist_focus_8c_desc:0 "The time has finally come, and we've made all the preparations we can make. With our new army and powerful industrial base backing us up, we shall unite the Realm of Kiria once more, bringing Vermilion and the Rising Sun to heel. The NAKP will reign supreme over the Realm, and under our leadership, we shall move the kirin race into a brave new world!"
KIR_council_focus_pirate:0 "A Favour Owed"
KIR_council_focus_pirate_desc:0 "Fickle Current made an ally while dealing with the pirates of Nacre. With the war in full swing, it's time to summon the pirate queen Roaring Fire to our side and bolster our forces on land and sea."

KIR_empire_focus_1:0 "Providence Dawning"
KIR_empire_focus_1_desc:0 "At last, we are in control of the whole of the nation. The false idols have been broken, and now it is time for the NAKP to enforce their vision over all of Kiria. A new dawn is rising, where wisdom and reason rule, not the superstition of the Way of Fire or the zealotry of the Rising Fire. A happy medium, where industry is king."
KIR_empire_focus_2a:0 "Restore the Matriarch"
KIR_empire_focus_2a_desc:0 "Although she has been coddled by traitors and communists for years, the Matriarch Superior still lies at the heart of Kirin culture and society. A Kirian government without her would never have the backing of the Way of Fire or the majority of Kirin. It is time to restore Rain Shine to her place of spiritual power, while she concedes temporal affairs to the NAKP."
KIR_empire_focus_2b:0 "Rebuild the Nation"
KIR_empire_focus_2b_desc:0 "While the Grand Gallop Onward was a complete and utter failure under the guardianship of the old government, the NAKP will not be so quick to rush headlong into destruction. We will succeed where others failed, for the Empire's industry and intelligentsia is behind us. By any cost needed, Fragrance and the realm at large must prosper."
KIR_empire_focus_3a:0 "The Vermilion Consignation"
KIR_empire_focus_3a_desc:0 "There are very few in Kiria who we, and by extension, the Matriarch Superior, can trust. But if there is one thing that will always ensure loyalty, it's money. That's why we know corporations have our back. By remaining loyal to the crown we both prosper, and that is why it is time to devolve further power to the corporations, legitimizing them as great feudal vassals of old."
KIR_empire_focus_roaring_fire:0 "Just Reward"
KIR_empire_focus_roaring_fire_desc:0 "It's time to pay Roaring Fire her due. She played her part in seizing control of the southern oceans for the NAKP, and so now it's time to give her what she wants: free reign in the South Kirin Sea. Her place in the new order is secure, as long as she keeps paying her taxes."

KIR_empire_focus_3b_desc:0 "Per the Indentured Service Compensation Scheme, those accused of financial crimes shall be bound to provide labor for the state until the point at which their debt is paid in full. While participating in the Compensation Scheme all living expenses shall be added to the debt of the laborer as per Subsection-9a. Complaints should be filed to the Bureau For Fair Kirin Treatment, which is located... somewhere."
KIR_empire_focus_3c:0 "The Imperial Kirian Army"
KIR_empire_focus_3c_desc:0 "Rising from the ashes of the old Banners, the new Kirin military is free from the shackles of the old order. Bankrolled by the Vassal-Corporations and with the full support of the Matriarch Superior, soon there will not be a finer fighting force in the world."
KIR_empire_focus_4a:0 "The Chairkirin's Mandate"
KIR_empire_focus_4a_desc:0 "The Chairkirin has a vision for Kiria, one that will not be bound by old notions of tradition and the agrarian idyll. Efficiency is the greatest moral guide, and anything second to capitalist perfection is a failure in the eyes of the Matriarch and the NAKP." ##you can elaborate more on the individual programs in the decision descriptions
KIR_empire_focus_4b:0 "Show Them the Way"
KIR_empire_focus_4b_desc:0 "The order of the Way of Fire is filled with seditious and treasonous elements that threaten to undermine our rule. However, the Way of Fire is too important to the kirin of the Realm to abolish entirely. We will focus our efforts on shifting legitimacy away from this institution and toward one more friendly to our goals."
KIR_empire_focus_4c:0 "Anti-Banditry Operations"
KIR_empire_focus_4c_desc:0 "Banditry continues to be a problem in the lawless and loosely policed frontiers. Let us establish a fitting doctrine to keep these lawless criminals under control and strengthen our hold on the Realm."
KIR_empire_focus_4x:0 "Civil Defence"
KIR_empire_focus_4x_desc:0 "Much of the misguided peasantry of the Realm sees us as foreign conquerors, but that is simply not so. Unfortunately, illiterate peasants cannot be reasoned with in good faith. Thankfully, martial law and the firm hoof of a strong civil defence force will be much more persuasive."
KIR_empire_focus_4y:0 "A Professional Military"
KIR_empire_focus_4y_desc:0 "Like all businesses the military must be run like a well-oiled machine. No leaks, no mistakes, no ifs, ands, or buts. Absolute discipline and absolute loyalty must be given from all our commanders and soldiers, as well as the corporations who back the defenders of Kiria. Anything less should amount to heresy, or at least be worth a fine."
KIR_empire_focus_5a:0 "The Twelfth Vassal-Corporation"
KIR_empire_focus_5a_desc:0 "So far we have codified a total of eleven vassal corporations in service to the Matriarch Superior. But we yet have the need for another. We can't let all our vassals get too wealthy without taking a slice of the pie for ourselves, and so shall be born the Corporation of Kiria, an extension of the NAKP and the Chairkirin's control over the economy; the ultimate tool to cement our influence in the Kirian sphere."
KIR_empire_focus_5b:0 "The New Realm Party" ##Suffrage Lottery or Guild Corporatocracy
KIR_empire_focus_5b_desc:0 "It is time to reinstall at least the dressings of a functional democracy; namely, the right to vote. But we would be foolish to give that right freely back to the uneducated kirin of the Realm; rather, we will focus on finding a system to make sure that the majority of votes are controlled by party loyalists."
KIR_empire_focus_5c:0 "Rural Pacification Campaigns"
KIR_empire_focus_5c_desc:0 "The small, unnamed villages scattered throughout the rural regions of the Realm are breeding grounds for rebel sentiment and partisan activities. We must decide how best to address these small hubs before they allow the rebel problem to fester and spread even further than it has."
KIR_empire_focus_5d:0 "Consolidate the West"
KIR_empire_focus_5d_desc:0 "The western reaches of the Realm are a lawless land where anything goes. We should consider pouring more money, resources, and loyal kirin into the west to consolidate our control, but this runs the risk of sucking up more resources that would be better used elsewhere."
KIR_empire_focus_6a:0 "The Imperial Code"
KIR_empire_focus_6a_desc:0 "The Realm is safely under our supervision, and it would not have been possible without the economic backing of the corporations and partners that made our victory possible. As a result, we have parceled out the land of the Realm for their use. Now, we need to convince them to reinvest the profits they'll generate using the Realm's resources back into the Realm itself."
KIR_empire_focus_6b:0 "Torchbearers of Progress"
KIR_empire_focus_6b_desc:0 "We've made great strides in consolidating our control over the Realm, and with the aid of our loyal vassal corporations, much of the Realm has been pacified one way or another. Let's put the finishing touches on our takeover of the Realm and secure Kiria for the NAKP and progress everywhere."
KIR_empire_focus_6x:0 "Modernise or Consolidate?"
KIR_empire_focus_6x_desc:0 "One of the most important things for an army is how efficiently it can move its troops both at home and abroad. Two schools of thought have emerged among our generals and theorists: should we modernize our rail capacity to move supplies and troops in bulk, or pivot toward the flexibility air transport allows us?"
KIR_empire_focus_6y:0 "Power Projection"
KIR_empire_focus_6y_desc:0 "It is not enough to hold your power close to your chest, so to speak. A true regional power, and even something more, knows it's best to project our power abroad, where our influence can be felt beyond our borders and our military can operate anywhere. While we still have some work to do on that front, modernizing our air power will allow us to project it like never before."
KIR_empire_focus_6z:0 "The Shipping Lanes"
KIR_empire_focus_6z_desc:0 "The sea is incredibly important to the strength and economic security of our nation, and so it must not be neglected. The coastline of Kiria is its source of vast power, and the watersheds of the Great Mellifluve and Carmine River allow our naval power to project even inland. It would be foolish not to double down on our strengths."
KIR_empire_focus_7x:0 "Disband the Thousand Banners"
KIR_empire_focus_7x_desc:0 "The Thousand Banners has been the main system of military recruitment and organization in the Realm since the end of the warlord era, but unfortunately, this means they harbor unrealistic nostalgia for the days of old. We should disband the old banners that may have loyalties to the previous regime and install a new military with unbreakable loyalty to the NAKP."
KIR_empire_focus_7y:0 "Expand the Merchant Navy"
KIR_empire_focus_7y_desc:0 "If we want to make the Realm a land of commerce and wealth, we need to make sure that our shipping lanes are safe and secure. Let us lean on the Sycee Trading House's extensive experience at protecting their overseas shipping and make sure our ships are safe no matter how far from friendly ports they may roam."
KIR_empire_focus_8a:0 "Carve Up the Pie"
KIR_empire_focus_8a_desc:0 "Kiria is prosperous, and business is booming. Now that we are firmly in control of the Realm, we should begin parceling out sectors of the market and industry to the highest bidder. The VasCorps will pay handsomely for lucrative government contracts, and the wild speculation over which VasCorps shall win which contracts is driving market prices up, up, up!"
KIR_empire_focus_8b:0 "The Corporate Tithes" ##1K gold per month per corporate vassal, Resolve Accounting Errors
KIR_empire_focus_8b_desc:0 "Just as we owe much of our success to the support of our loyal VasCorps, the corporations owe their newfound record profits and riches to our business-friendly policies and cooperation. The state has sacrificed much to make the corporations happy, so it is time they begin to repay the debt they owe us."
KIR_empire_focus_8c:0 "Industrial Sectorisation"
KIR_empire_focus_8c_desc:0 "The Realm of Kiria is blessed with abundant land, ease in transporting goods along its many rivers, and a vast amount of cheap peasant labor. By designating special development sectors, we can more efficiently manage our abundant resources to create more factories, faster than ever."
KIR_empire_focus_8x:0 "The New Martial Class"
KIR_empire_focus_8x_desc:0 "The kirin who fought valiantly for us to save the Realm from superstition and socialism have become an important backbone in our society. These soldiers stand a cut above the rest and are an inspiration for all. We should impress this on the population and bolster the ranks of the new martial class, through experienced veterans or wealthy party donors purchasing commission."
KIR_empire_focus_9a:0 "Renegotiate Rhapsody"
KIR_empire_focus_9a_desc:0 "There yet exists a realm within our own, where the power of the NAKP and its vassals is not yet secure. The city of Rhapsody stands defiant against us, stuck in its old ways, and shielded by the Procurate. They insist on being given special status within the Empire; a silly notion if only they didn't control the city's great Arsenal. Let us invite the Procurate to Fragrance to help resolve our differences."
KIR_empire_focus_9b:0 "Liberate the Markets" ##Factory Investment Cost
KIR_empire_focus_9b_desc:0 "To ensure that the free market is, well, free, we need to make sure that there is no restrictive red tape or anti-business clauses holding back the free-flowing exchange of money. The VasCorps, while eternally loyal and cooperative with our regime, are unfortunately all too prone to stifling a good deal on our end to make their shareholders richer. Perhaps that should change..."
KIR_empire_focus_9y:0 "The Kirian Soldiery"
KIR_empire_focus_9y_desc:0 "Given the size of the Realm, it is infeasible to expect the professional army to quickly respond to all threats, both without and within. Let us instead invest our treasury in creating MilSets, specialized, permanent settlements that are populated by soldiers and veterans who can quickly respond to any threats and contain them until the military can respond."
KIR_empire_focus_9z:0 "Results-Oriented Tactical Warfare"
KIR_empire_focus_9z_desc:0 "Bandits linger in the west, hindering our efforts to pacify the Realm. They survive by siphoning recruits and supplies off of the local towns like a parasite. Well, if they act like parasites, then we shall treat them as such. Sometimes, the host has to endure suffering to ensure the parasite dies."
KIR_empire_focus_9x:0 "Imperial Vermilion"
KIR_empire_focus_9x_desc:0 "We have secured the Realm, and now it is time to look outwards. It is Concord's will, and the will of our shareholders, that we expand the realm's control beyond its current borders. As the protectors of kirinkind, we will ensure the safety of our southern brethren by bringing them back into the fold and subjugating those that would subjugate us."
KIR_empire_focus_10a:0 "Tap Our Potential" ##Extractivist Regime
KIR_empire_focus_10a_desc:0 "Kiria is a land blessed with an abundance of resources that have long remained out of reach for one reason or another. Now that the superstitious Way of Fire mystics are out of the way and the peasantry is fully utilized by our loyal VasCorps, the time has come to claim the bounty the Realm offers us so freely."
KIR_empire_focus_10b:0 "Nurture the Salariat"
KIR_empire_focus_10b_desc:0 "In the cutthroat world of big business, we only want the best and most devoted employees in our companies. These kirin are the ones that will drive quarterly revenue ever skyward, rather than dragging it down through laziness. We should incentivize growing a loyal and diligent salariat to push productivity into levels never seen before!"
KIR_empire_focus_10x:0 "Two Protectorates and Three Commanderies"
KIR_empire_focus_10x_desc:0 "Before the Silence crippled our nation, our southern borders were protected by a network of loyal protectorates and commanderies that kept the local zebra population at bay and prevented them from raiding and pillaging the Realm. In the interest of regional stability, we should resurrect these valuable institutions once more."
KIR_empire_focus_10y:0 "A Fully Armed Business Concern" ##New Markets
KIR_empire_focus_10y_desc:0 "We push the borders of the Realm outwards not to conquer and despoil, but to expand our market's access, and the ability of the people of Zebrica to access them. Unfortunately, our backward neighbors don't seem too thrilled to participate in this opportunity. Thankfully, our business pioneers have ways of convincing them of the merits of participating in the great Kirian markets!"
KIR_empire_focus_11z:0 "The Kiria Travel and Tourism Company"
KIR_empire_focus_11z_desc:0 "As we secure our Realm and lands beyond it, it would be ideal to reward our loyal party members with safe and memorable experiences doing something outside of the office. Enter the Kiria Travel and Tourism Company, which aims to take pristine lands, sanitize them of any troublesome elements, and present them as safe and exciting travel destinations!"
KIR_empire_focus_12z:0 "Tributary Obligations"
KIR_empire_focus_12z_desc:0 "We provide safety and security for the loyal tributaries of the Empire, but the Empire is a business, not a charity. In a business, transactions flow both ways in an exchange of goods or services. We should remind our tributaries of that and make sure they hold up their end of the bargain."

Thankfully, the VasCorps are willing to offer military support, and though the cost may seem cheap on paper, nothing the VasCorps ever do comes without its proper price..."

KIR_empire_focus_coc2_desc:0 "The Children of Concord fight with the bare minimum of supplies, and everything they have has been acquired through great difficulty and cost.

Unfortunately, the loss of life and equipment will be significant, but the VasCorps are offering to pick up the slack for us."
KIR_empire_focus_coc3:0 "Do It Right"
KIR_empire_focus_coc3_desc:0 "To ensure that the Children of Concord revolution is put down for good, we need to convince the towns and settlements that provide aid to them that continuing to do so is no longer in their best interest.

It had taken her weeks to get to this point, but now, for the first time in her 36 years of rule, she had signed an Imperial decree that would be read all throughout the Realm of Kiria. With that final brushstroke, and with the copies that the scribes would make in the morning and distribute to the far reaches of the country, The Silence, her mother's legacy, would come to an end after over a century of stagnation and decay.\n\nIt did not make her happy. If anything, Rain Shine felt nervous, wondering if what she was doing was the right thing for her subjects — subjects she had never met before. But her thoughts were stolen away from that when a servant entered and announced that Autumn Blaze was waiting to see her, and the mare in question entered a few moments later at Rain Shine's behest. Autumn bowed before her Matriarch, though Rain Shine keenly noted the awe and reverence the lesser kirin offered her at witnessing her regal body, and stood up. "You wished to see me, Matriarch?" Autumn asked.\n\n"I did," Rain Shine said, and her magic lifted a separate scroll off of her desk, neatly wrapped in a vermilion ribbon, and passed it to Autumn Blaze, who took it in her own telekinetic grip. "With The Silence ending, I am bringing together kirin from all across the Realm to discuss how we can rebuild our nation and bring it into the modern age. I am calling the first All-Kirin Plenum for National Revival... and as the mare who was so instrumental in helping the Equestrian delegation reach Vermilion, I want you to be its Premier."\n\nAutumn Blaze looked shocked at the sudden responsibility, but she nevertheless nodded and bowed again. "I... I'm not sure if I'm ready for that responsibility, Matriarch, but if you think so..."\n\nRain Shine cut her off with a wave of her hoof and an assuring smile."

kirin.2.t:0 "A Letter from Autumn Blaze"
kirin.2.d:0 "Dear Applejack and Fluttershy,\n\nOh, I hope this letter reaches you two; it's not like Kiria hasn't had a functional postal system in a century, right? The hoops I had to go through just to send a piece of paper halfway across the world...\n\nI got a new job! Matriarch Superior Rain Shine (you remember her, right? The really tall kirin?) decided to call kirin from all across the realm to Vermilion to participate in the All-Kirin Plenum for National Revival, and she made ME its premier! Talk about a leap in responsibility, right? I guess the Matriarch saw something in me when I helped you two make the last leg of the journey from Massicot to Vermilion. It's a lot to take on, and I'm not sure I'm the best kirin for the job, but I'll give it my best regardless!\n\nBut you should see Vermilion now! When you left, it was like a sleepy teenager asking for five more minutes of sleep, but now the city is absolutely bustling. I've never seen anything like it before! There are so many kirin from all over the realm pouring in every day to attend the Plenum, and there's this wonderful, colorful feeling of hope and excitement just buzzing through the air. I've spent a LOT of time meeting all the delegates I'll be working with during the Plenum, and two in particular really stuck out. The first is Winter Frost, one of our Way of Fire priestesses from Rhapsody, who's a bit of a stickler for tradition and knows way more about our fire goddess, Concord, than I could ever hope to learn. She's brought a whole bunch of priests and mystics in from across the realm to participate in the Plenum, and though I never studied our religion too hard, I'm sure we'll have lots to talk about. The other kirin is a fellow called Fickle Current who's been living in Griffonia all his life. I didn't even know what Griffonia was until last month! But he's the grandson of some businesskirin who fled the realm when The Silence started, and he brought a lot of the kirin diaspora back with him to start fixing up the homeland. They even arrived at the capital in automobiles imported from Griffonia, which pretty much nokirin in the capital had ever seen before. To say he made a grand entrance would be an understatement, though I think that rubbed Winter Frost and her mystics the wrong way; the two of them don't seem like they got off on the right hoof, so to say. But I'm confident with time we'll be able to smooth those issues out at the Plenum. After all, we're all working together to better our nation, right?\n\nI hope you're doing well! Wish us the best of luck for the Plenum, because we're gonna need it!"

kirin.3.t:0 "A Letter from the Premier"
kirin.3.d:0 "Most Divine Matriarch Superior,\n\nToday marks a week since you decreed that the imperial heralds would fan out across the realm and deliver the news of the All-Kirin Plenum for National Revival to the kirin of your domain. I'm pleased to report that the decree is proceeding swimmingly, apart from a few hiccups here and there, and your subjects are finally learning that The Silence is over. I've already been receiving reports from the envoys in the field that many towns and settlements are taking to the streets with joy and excitement, and I understand their feelings perfectly. You, Matriarch, are blessed with a lifespan that lasts twice as long as the rest of us, thanks to Concord's divine favor, so time must seem to feel twice as fast. Sixty years is hardly half your strengthened lifespan, but an entire generation of kirin has been born, raised, grown old, and is now passing on in that same time, having only known The Silence their entire lives. In a century from now, The Silence will have only been a fraction of your life, while it has come to dominate the lives of all of your subjects; ending it now and starting a new chapter for the kirin species fills all of us with joy and excitement at what tomorrow brings. The hardships we all were born into and lived through will soon feel like a distant memory now that we all, together, get to shape our destiny, and for that, you have won the undying love and devotion of all your subjects. I don't think I can possibly overstate just how great of a change this will be for all of us.\n\nEven still, I know this won't be easy, nor will the future we create for Kiria be what everykirin desires. Some kirin want to rapidly modernize us to catch up to the rest of the world, while others are far more cautious, remembering the disasters of modernization under your mother's rule. There will probably be bickering and arguing and fighting, but good things don't come to those who wait. They have to be fought for, and that's what we'll all be doing at the Plenum. With your guidance, I know we can create a bright new future for all kirin, and I'm thrilled to serve by your side.\n\nLet's do this together, and let's do it right."

kirin.4.t:0 "The Grand Gallop Onward"
kirin.4.d:0 "Matriarch Superior Rain Shine momentarily hesitated as she took to the podium placed on the steps before the imperial palace. Her red eyes shifted downwards and scanned over the hundreds... no, thousands of faces staring up at her. She had to remind herself that this was the first time most of her subjects had ever seen her in person. Rarely had she ventured outside of the palace walls all her life, and even rarer still had been any occasions to speak to her subjects, or let them speak to her. Her ascension through her mother's funeral pyre had been a quiet and closed affair within the palace walls, and only imperial proclamations to the kirin of Vermilion would have let any know that a change in leadership had taken place 36 years ago. Now, she stood before them as their new Matriarch Superior, ready to lead them out of the darkness of The Silence that had stifled kirin society for so long.\n\n"My faithful and loyal subjects," Rain Shine began, glancing down at the prepared speech in front of her and then back at the crowd. "I know this is the first time most of you have ever seen your Matriarch. I know this is the first time you have ever heard my voice. But a new era for Kiria could not begin without allowing you to meet me. I am not my mother. I am not the mare who created the decrees and laws that created what we call today The Silence. I am not Noctilucent Charm, but I am her daughter. And today, I will begin the atonement for my mother's mistakes."\n\nSurprised murmuring passed through the crowd, and Rain Shine let that proclamation sink in before continuing. "I have set in motion a series of decrees and appointments that will bring about the end of The Silence," she said. "Today is the beginning of a new era for Kiria. But I alone cannot forge our future. It is time for all the kirin of the Realm to join me in this future we create together. The kirin people must join me on a Grand Gallop Onward, a leap that will see us modernize our industry, our technology, our agriculture, and our science. This realm that has been entrusted to us by Concord is blessed by her wisdom and favor. We kirin are an ingenious people, a people who are intimately familiar with the creative and destructive force of fire. We will use our gifts to make the most of Concord's blessing. Through hard work, grit, and fervent devotion to the fire goddess, the Realm of Kiria WILL emerge from The Silence to become a world power within a decade. There is nothing that we cannot accomplish together! So I ask you, kirin of the Realm... will you join me in The Grand Gallop Onward?"\n\nThunderous applause and ecstatic cheering was the crowd's response, seemingly audible across the entirety of the Realm."
kirin.4.a:0 "The Grand Gallop Onward begins today!"

kirin.5.t:0 "Émigrés Return Home"
kirin.5.d:0 "Fickle Current watched from Fragrance's harbor as another ship pulled into port. The ships had been arriving in Kiria's northernmost port city by the day, each one loaded with dozens of kirin making the return to their ancestral homelands. These were the kirin of the diaspora, descendents of kirin who had the good sense to flee the Realm when The Silence began. Many had longed for home their whole lives, to reconnect with their people and their families, but unwilling to sacrifice their livelihoods to scratch out an impoverished living in squalor that such a move would force upon them. But now, with The Silence ending and Matriarch Superior Rain Shine inviting all kirin living abroad to return home and help modernize the nation, the diaspora had found the excuse it had been looking for to finally cease living abroad like exiles and return home as heroes.\n\nThe ship in front of Current had sailed in from Griffonia, judging by the signal flags hanging between its masts, and the businesskirin pushed against the crowd surging off of the ship to find one particular face. He found it on the body of a green kirin with a white mane, and as soon as the two recognized each other, they stepped forward and embraced on the docks. "Current!" the green stallion exclaimed. "So good to see you! I feel like it's been years!"\n\n"Only a few, Cypress Snow, but years it has been." The two kirin stepped back, and then Cypress followed Current as the two began to move toward an automobile parked on the cobblestone roads by the docks. "I'm glad you came," Current continued as they trotted. "Though I imagine giving up a position at Greenback University had to have been rough."\n\n"Not as rough as trying to educate you back in the day," Cypress joked. "But my talents will be better suited here than in Yale. The kirin here are in desperate need of somebody to educate them. We have to bring the Realm's standards up to snuff with the rest of the world, or we will be left behind."\n\nThe two sat down in the back of the automobile, and the driver slowly pulled away from the harbor. "The return of the diaspora is something the Realm desperately needs," Current agreed. "The kirin living here are all poor peasants living in the mud of their farms. The Realm needs us if it's ever going to make itself great again, even if half of these farmers see us as foreigners trying to end their way of life. But I imagine the Matriarch will amply reward us for saving her nation when all is said and done.""
kirin.5.a:0 ""She will owe everything to kirin like us. That's a powerful debt to hold.""

kirin.6.t:0 "The All-Kiria Collegium"
kirin.6.d:0 "Autumn Blaze let out a sigh of relief and stretched her sore legs as the last of the bills to lay the foundation of the All-Kiria Collegium, Kiria's first modern university and heavily inspired by academics from Yale, finally passed the floor by a razor thin margin. The contentious issue that had turned what should have been a good idea everykirin could agree on into a parliamentary nightmare had been the university's stance on religion: the university was officially secular, and would not make mandatory the attendance of sermons and the observance of holy days that were crucial to The Way of Fire. Winter Frost's religious clique had fought tooth and nail to reject the proposed university's secularism, claiming that it would corrupt kirin intellectuals for generations to come and only breed heresy and disrespect for Concord, while Fickle Current and his proposed president of the new school, Cypress Snow, had claimed that removing religion from the lecture hall would allow new ideas to grow without the shackles of tradition and mysticism to hold them down. The debate had been furious and lasted for hours, and in the end, it fell on Autumn Blaze and her supporters to decide the matter in Current's favor. The university would be secular, and Cypress Snow would be its president.\n\nBut that had not been the end of it. As soon as the floor cleared from the vote, Winter Frost stood up in her booth and put her hooves on the vermilion rail separating the seats from the plenum center. "If we are going to plant the seeds of heresy in our garden, we must at least have somekirin to watch over it and pluck the weeds as necessary," she began. "I motion that the Collegium be placed under the jurisdiction of the Reform Bureau. This kind of right-wing radicalism that Current and his cronies bathe in must not be allowed to breed at our academic centers, or we will have turned our backs on Concord and the Matriarch Superior!"\n\nFickle Current was quick to respond, hopping to his hooves after only having taken his seat moments before. "You lost the fight over the university, and now you wish to cripple what you cannot control!" he spat back at her. "The traditionalists control the Reform Bureau; you would stifle our academics instead of letting them grow and blossom." Before Frost could respond, he turned to Autumn Blaze and addressed her directly. "Premier, your faction decided the last vote, so put an end to this one as well. Do not let Winter Frost and her traditionalists censor this university, or the future of the kirin literati will suffer for it.""

kirin.7.t:0 "Verdant in Bloom"
kirin.7.d:0 ""There is another issue I want to talk to you about."\n\nAutumn Blaze looked up from her tea at Fickle Current, a small frown curving her lips as she met Fickle Current's eyes. The businesskirin always wore a suit, and today was no different, even in the heat outdoors. It made him look intelligent and sharp, but also marked him as an outsider, somekirin who hadn't lived in the Realm during The Silence, instead thriving in Griffonia until the time was right to return to the home of his grandparents. Every time he said something, Autumn had to remind herself that the two of them might as well be different species; the only thing they had in common was their race, and their hopes for bringing the Realm out of the dark century of The Silence—though even in that, they differed.\n\n"These 'Rising Fire' heretics... they're growing ever more powerful in Verdant," Current continued, unaware of or simply indifferent about Autumn's frown. "Communalists who think that The Silence was a beneficial realignment of kirin society, and that our treasured Way of Fire has failed us. They've even started attracting Marksists and Stallionists to their numbers. You know what those are, correct? A violent revolutionary ideology that thrives in toppling monarchy and castrating the beneficial ventures of capitalism?"\n\n"In some opinions, yes," Autumn demurred. "But I believe in the Grand Gallop Onward. We can incorporate everykirin's ideas into rebuilding our nation. Cooperation makes us stronger."\n\n"And divisions make us weaker. They must be stopped, and they must be crushed now before it is too late," Current urged her. "Use the power of your position to officially denounce and disperse this filthy corner of our society. Do it now, before their heresy grows, and our Matriarch Superior is the next monarch to be overthrown.""

kirin.8.t:0 "The Banners of Vermilion"
kirin.8.d:0 "Rain Shine stood in the massive plaza of the open-air Verdigris Rotunda outside of the imperial palace, counting the numerous colorful feathered banners fluttering in the slight breeze of the dreary day. A small drizzle had settled over Vermilion, and two of her palace servants used their magic to keep the rain off of her regal body, but the kirin assembled in the plaza before her stood tall, stoic, and proud. Some were young, barely more than colts and fillies, while some were older, their scales weathered and cracked with the passage of time. But one thing drew them all together, and those were the colorful banners they rallied around.\n\n"You few, you proud, gallant few," Rain Shine began, addressing the crowd with a respectful dip of her head. "You are the children, grandchildren, or even great grandchildren of the last soldiers to serve in my mother's Thousand Banners. Your ancestors served well in the Thousand Banners, and were rewarded amply with land upon which to start a family when they retired. Their children, and their children's children, served after them in the Banners. Like my own family, your families became strong military dynasties that will survive the worst the world can throw at them... even something like The Silence."\n\nHer eyes shifted to look out on the plaza, noting all the empty space unoccupied by the tiny gathering of kirin in front of her. "I summoned you here through imperial decree because it is time to rebuild the Thousand Banners of Vermilion. You will be the first to serve me, should you choose to follow in the hoofsteps of your ancestors. You will be made captains and officers, and you will protect the Realm from any threats, just as your forebears did. There are not a thousand banners standing before me, true, but I look forward to the day when this rotunda is filled with a thousand colorful banners, like a rainbow fallen onto the earth. But the first banners... they will be yours, and they will be honored by Concord's blessing. So I ask of you, kirin of the Realm: who will step forward and serve their Matriarch?"\n\nShe did not have to wait long for a response. One by one, the kirin under each banner stepped forward, carrying their banners with them for Rain Shine to bless with a touch of her magic. One by one, they knelt before her and swore their oaths to the Realm, just as their ancestors once did long ago. And one by one, Kiria earned its Banners back on that day."

kirin.9.t:0 "Harmony, Heritage, Homeland"
kirin.9.d:0 "As the All-Kirin Plenum for National Revival goes on, what was originally a call for reform—Harmony, Heritage, Homeland—has become a rallying cry for the three cliques that have swiftly formed with the Plenum's maturation. Premier Autumn Blaze and her supporters advocate for Harmony, a platform of liberal reformism that seeks to align the Realm of Kiria with the ideas and tenets of the Equestrian model. Renowned priestess Winter Frost and the religious sect of the Plenum believe in the kirin heritage, seeking to remember the traditions that once made Kiria a wonderful and prosperous nation, and to remember the Way of Fire and the fire goddess Concord for bringing the oftentimes violent kirin race together into a peaceful theocracy, an ideal once thought impossible six centuries ago. Those who have made Homeland their rallying cry are led by Fickle Current, the grandson of businesskirin who fled the Realm a century ago when The Silence began, and who has now become the leading voice for the return of the kirin diaspora and literati. All three have very different ideas of how to modernize the nation and shake off the vestiges of The Silence, and in many aspects, their ideas are incompatible with each other's. As the debates and deliberations drag on, one of these factions will eventually find an edge over their competitors and win more delegates over to their side. The question now becomes the following: which faction is the one truly blessed by Concord's divine wisdom?"

kirin.10.t:0 "In the Hall of the Matriarch Superior"
kirin.10.d:0 "Matriarch Superior Rain Shine watched the delegates assemble in their seats for the day's session of the Plenum with a note of concern. What had started out as a heterogenous mixture of kirin and their ideas at the beginning of the plenum had differentiated itself into three homogenous groups as time went on, with kirin attaching themselves to cliques of like-minded individuals and all sitting grouped together. Discussion and mingling between the delegates had all but ceased, and now the delegates had firmly attached themselves to their preferred leader and ideals: Premier Autumn Blaze and her liberal reformists, Priestess Winter Frost and her traditionalist sect, and the businesskirin Fickle Current and his cabal of capitalists. Those three factions had turned the free-flowing exchange of ideas into hard-fought political debates, most of which were only resolved when two cliques ganged up on the third to enforce their compromise over the other party. Her presence as Matriarch Superior forced her delegates to take a step back and calm down when they began to get angry, lest one transform into a nirik in the presence of their Matriarch, yet even still, tempers readily flared.\n\nBut even her powerful and respected presence nearly failed in controlling the assembly when the doors opened and a large procession of priests and mystics in vibrant red and gold robes entered the hall, followed by a score of poor farmers. They had barely begun to fill out a bank of empty seats before Winter Frost jumped to her hooves and spat in their direction. "Heretic!" the priestess raged, pointing a hoof directly at the fiery mare who led the procession in. "Your twisted mockery of the Way of Fire is not welcome before the sacred presence of our Matriarch Superior! Leave now, or I will drag you down the palace steps and toss you out of Vermilion myself!"\n\nWinter Frost's fellow mystics joined their voices to hers, and even some of Fickle Current's clique and Autumn Blaze's allies began to boo and hiss as the Premier struggled for control. Yet none of that seemed to disturb the newcomers' leader, who simply turned about to face Rain Shine directly and bowed low. "Divine Matriarch, my name is Rising Sun, and my followers have traveled a long way to meet you," she said. Her voice was shrewd and sweet, and when Rain Shine looked into the mare's eyes, she saw a cunning cleverness hiding in their fiery depths. "You have called, and the kirin of the west have answered. The Path of the Rising Fire is here to participate in this renewal of our great nation... so long as you will have us.""

"The Morning Secretariat has continued to serve its function unperturbed by The Silence. The mystics have served our Matriarch Superior well, as I'm sure she can attest, and her mother before her. I move we dismiss this topic and focus on more important matters at hoof."\n\nAutumn quickly shook her head and launched into her retort.

I move that we elect a new Morning Secretariat from the members gathered here in the Plenum, to advise the Matriarch on matters of our rapidly changing state as we modernize."\n\n"I agree," Fickle Current cut in from across the room. "Our Matriarch, blessed as she is with Concord's wisdom, will not be well served by traditionalists stuck in the past, when the Realm's future is in the... well, future. I will support your plan, Premier, but in return, I ask a favor." The businesskirin made a show of clearing his throat and raised his voice to make his words clear to the rest of the Plenum. "Ever since the tragedy of 902, the merchant class has been banned from seeking audiences with the Matriarch, let alone approach her in any official capacity as an advisor. I ask that the merchant class be allowed to serve on the Secretariat, and additionally, ten of the seventy seats will be reserved for business and industry representatives.

"We cannot expect business and industry to be beholden to the teachings of The Way of Fire when our religious fundamentals were laid down before modernization of today's scale was scarcely dreamed of," Current continued, pushing on with a firm voice against the agitations of the Plenum. "Modernization relies squarely on one thing, and that is the free flowing river of currency from the hooves of the buyer into the hooves of the seller. When we are talking about the modernization of the present, thousands of tons of gold will exchange hooves in a season, and all of it has to be accounted for. Splitting off a portion of this gold in tithes will only hamper the rapid pace of modernization. What use does Concord have for our gold, I ask you?

"Premier, before you make your decision, if I may," she said, bowing her head despite the jeers of her contemporaries and rivals..."

kirin.13.t:0 "Rising Sun's New Dawn"
kirin.13.d:0 ""You have the floor," Autumn said after a moment's indecision. She tried to prepare herself for what would come next; doubtless letting Rising Sun and her heretical sect have a moment in the spotlight would lead to more headache than it was worth. But the Plenum could not be fair if all kirin didn't have a chance to speak...\n\n"Thank you." Rising Sun raised her head from her bow, stepped out into the center of the Plenum, and turned to address her peers. She took only a moment to collect her thoughts before she began. "Mountains are not forever," she began, her piercing eyes slowly sweeping across the crowd. "Expecting a mountain to stand tall and resolute for ten thousand years is a foal's folly. They change with the weather, worn down season by season. What yesterday we thought was unchangeable will be tomorrow changed. So too must our teachings and our doctrines. Five centuries ago, The Way of Fire was the tallest peak in the mountain range, but it is different today that it was then. There is no shame in changing and adapting to fit the times," she said, her eyes stopping on Winter Frost for a moment before continuing on. "We must change and adapt if we want to survive. But we do not dam a river when instead it could be rerouted," she said, and this time her gaze settled on Fickle Current with a slight frown. "Common sense guides the spirit of Kiria now just as it did back then. We do not need to pretend the problems of today are the same as they were a century ago, nor do we need to pretend that we must start over if we are to combat them. The Way of Fire will learn to adapt with the forces of modernization, to work with it as a graceful dance partner, promoting equality, justice, peace, and harmony for all kirinkind. It will not be swept away by modernization, but instead will guide it to a brighter dawn. It will not abandon our sacred traditions, but seamlessly marry them to the future we create for ourselves here today. So I ask you, kirin of the Plenum, this simple question: why choose yesterday or tomorrow, when we could live together in the new today that we make for ourselves?"\n\nSomehow, Rising Fire's stirring words had moved kirin from all across the Plenum to applaud her speech. The delegates would vote as she saw fit, Autumn Blaze concluded, but she frowned as she spent a few more moments to dissect the priestess' words. She had never used the term 'The Rising Fire' to label her beliefs, but Autumn knew that it was what she'd proposed. The heretic was slowly worming new ideas into the Plenum, but there was nothing Autumn could do except hold a slight frown as Rising Sun grinned at her and the votes were cast."

kirin.14.t:0 "An Accord with Concord"
kirin.14.d_1:0 "Priestess Winter Frost did her best to hide her scowl as she watched her Matriarch Superior surrender her absolute authority over the Realm with ink brushed on paper. The entire Plenum had been moved outside to the steps of the Vermilion Palace, where Rain Shine read her latest imperial decree to the kirin of the capital, turning its words into law with her divine voice. But those words were not hers. Instead, they were the conniving traitors' words read through the Matriarch's voice, turning blasphemy into religious creed and curtailing Concord's divine influence on the world by weakening Her avatar. It made her blood boil, but she kept it all hidden under a neutral expression. A priestess of The Way of Fire could not go against the decisions of her Matriarch, no matter how much they irked her.\n\nInstead, she directed her ire toward Fickle Current and his cronies, their pleased expressions sickening her to her stomach. Not two days had passed since Current and the rest of his Griffonia-educated ilk had proposed a charter that stripped away much of Rain Shine's power under the pretense of simplifying and codifying the Realm's governance. Her divine authority had been transformed into legal power and stolen from her court by the Morning Secretariat, which Current and his friends had a very strong hoof in. Though the charter recognized Rain Shine's divinity, reaffirming her union with Concord at her ascension when she emerged from the flames of her mother's funeral pyre, it also removed her ability to speak directly for Concord and rule by decree, instead forcing her to earn the Secretariat's consent before making a decision that would affect the Realm. While the Matriarch's court would remain open for petitioners, the matter of ruling would now be handled almost exclusively by the Morning Secretariat.\n\nWinter Frost wasted no time in separating with her clique when the decree was finished and the delegates were allowed to go their separate ways. The less time she had to spend in the traitors' presence, the better. Something would have to be done about them, she told herself, lest the Kiria she knew and loved one day ceased to be."

"To think mortals could bend a Goddess' divine will to their own uses... perhaps The Way of Fire has lost the way?"\n\n"Quiet, heretic," Winter Frost hissed at her. "I do not need you making today any more intolerable than it already is."\n\nRising Sun merely chuckled at that. "The Rising Fire supports our Matriarch," she said. "This charter is just an unfortunate stopgap for the challenges we face. Our way survived The Silence, and it will survive this too." She gave Winter a sly smile as she added, "Perhaps one day you and I will see eye to eye on these things. We need not be enemies, not when our way of life is at stake.""

kirin.15.d:0 "Fickle Current slowly marched up the stairs toward the burnt-out town hall, passing by scores of kirin quietly sitting amongst the ashes in protest, their glares turned toward the imperial guards gathered around the perimeter. It was only his third time visiting Fragrance, his family's ancestral hometown, but this time he came as an ally in the government.\n\nAs soon as the news of the unrest in Kiria's once-largest city reached Vermilion, Current had immediately volunteered his time to go and resolve the matter on the Matriarch's behalf. As the procession of automobiles navigated the dirt roads between Vermilion and Fragrance, he had taken the time to read up on any information from Fragrance he could get his hooves on. As far as the reports went, Vermilion's attempt to assert its authority over its distant urban centers had been met with resistance in Fragrance, where the city's elected council refused to cede power to the Vermilion envoys up to the moment they were forcibly removed by the envoys' guard detail. The bad blood between Fragrance and Vermilion had boiled over, and a few nirik transformations had reduced the town hall to cinders. Now, the kirin protested by peacefully sitting in the courtyard of the demolished town hall, but the conviction in their beliefs had not died down in the slightest.\n\nAfter asking around, Current shortly found himself directed to Cherry Blossom, the city's mayor and organizer behind the protests. She looked up from the papers on her table as Current approached and frowned at him. "If you're here from Vermilion, then you might as well turn around and tell the Matriarch that we won't talk until her lapdogs are gone," she growled. "Fragrance refuses to negotiate with the sons of Vermilion."\n\n"What about a son of Fragrance who will turn your rags back into riches?" Current sat down across from her and set his hat down by his side. "My grandparents lost everything when The Silence ravaged our city, just like yours. But I'm back to make it right again. My friends are powerful, and they are the driving forces behind the repeal of The Silence and the return of Fragrance's industry. You have my word as a delegate of the Plenum and a devoted son of Fragrance that I will do everything in my power to return our city to its former glory by shaping Vermilion policy from within. All I ask of you is to stand back and stand by until our moment of glory comes."\n\nCherry Blossom scowled, but after a moment she nodded in agreement. "If you can save Fragrance, then by all means, do so," she said. "But know it will take a lot from Vermilion to undo a hundred years of suffering. Fragrance will not be humiliated a second time.""
kirin.15.a:0 ""Nor will it be. You have my word.""

kirin.16.t:0 "In the Garden of Tranquil Florescence"
kirin.16.d:0 "Autumn Blaze again touched the piece of paper rolled up and hidden inside one of the pockets in her vermilion and golden robes as she observed the festivities in the Garden of Tranquil Florescence. It had been her masterpiece of her time as premier so far, a sprawling and lively festival to welcome Kiria back into the modern world by inviting delegations from all across the world to witness the resurgence of kirin culture with the end of The Silence. Delegations from Equestria, Aquileia, Wingbardy, and the Griffonian Empire were all present, along with envoys from many other nations, all bedazzled by the spectacles of kirin folk songs and dances, pyrotechnics, gymnastics, the military drilling of the elite kirin Banners, and of course, seemingly endless kirin cuisine. The past two days had all been an effort to butter up the delegates and please them before giving her speech, in which she would politely ask for assistance from foreign nations in modernizing the Realm—modernizing a nation as large and disparate as Kiria within a few years would be impossible without outside help, after all. Hopefully, the foreign envoys would be able to secure favorable terms with their governments if they left Kiria pleased and amazed with what they saw.\n\nBut as Autumn prepared to give the speech, she still found herself wrestling with how to request foreign aid. Winter Frost and the traditionalists had pressured her to take a more moderate approach, to advocate for the righteousness of The Way of Fire and its tenet of living in harmony with nature rather than conquering it. Fickle Current, however, had urged her to found her request on Kiria's abundance of natural resources, simply waiting for foreign capital to be exploited and traded around the world. It left Autumn in an uncomfortable position: should she ask for help based on good faith and favors, or exchange the resources of her home for the money of foreigners?"
kirin.16.a:0 "We will ask for foreign aid in exchange for favors and Concord's blessing."
kirin.16.b:0 "We will use our natural resources as a bargaining chip to bring them to the table."

kirin.17.t:0 "A Missive from Hyacinth"
kirin.17.d:0 "To Premier Autumn Blaze,\n\nI am sending you this urgent message requesting support for the kirin of Hyacinth in recovering from a pirate attack. According to the locals, about three days before our imperial delegation arrived in the city to reassert the Matriarch Superior's authority over the coastal town, a large pirate armada appeared on the horizon and stormed the port. The pirates swiftly blockaded the port, disembarked from their ships, and stripped the town bare of any and all valuables the townsfolk possessed, even pressing some of the villagers into service aboard their ships before embarking again. Such raids are not uncommon, the villagers tell me, and have been a somewhat regular occurrence for decades, ever since a large pirate haven was established on the Auburn Isle just off of Hyacinth's coast. The pirates do not kill or burn, I am told, as they treat the coastal villages like fruit bearing trees to be cultivated and harvested when the time is right, yet the frequent raids on these villages have stifled their growth and left them too weak to fend for themselves.\n\nEvery village I visited along the coast told similar stories. It is clear that something needs to be done, but until we can rebuild a navy of our own, it seems unlikely that anything CAN be done. How are we supposed to reassert the Matriarch's divine rule over all the Realm if we cannot protect those living on our coasts? One way or another, these pirates must be brought to heel and their armada disbanded. It is the only way to create peace and prosperity for the fishing villages and harbor towns along the coast. Until the pirate menace is dealt with, we will struggle to truly end The Silence in all of Kiria, and our efforts at modernization will never be successful.\n\nPlease bring this matter to the Matriarch Superior's attention at the first chance you get. Her subjects depend on it.\n\nOur Matriarch's loyal servant,\nFirecracker"

kirin.18.t:0 "The Letter of the Law"
kirin.18.d:0 ""The Plenum now moves onto the matter of the evaluation of laws passed as part of The Silence's decrees," Autumn Blaze said, pulling the next proposal across her desk and skimming over the brief attached to it. "Fickle Current, since this is your proposal, how about you get us started off?"\n\n"Gladly," the industrialist said and, standing up, he took the podium to address his fellow delegates. "Members of the Plenum, we have already gone so far in revoking and repealing many of the ill-advised decrees that constituted the hundred year decay that brought our nation to where it stands today," he said. "The faults in these decrees were easy to see and were dismissed accordingly; likewise, the laws that filled in the spaces between Matriarch Noctilucent Charm's decrees should also be removed. Some of these laws explicitly ban little things like singing, dancing, and loud talking in public, and I think even priestess Winter Frost will agree with me that these measures are archaic and unnecessary in today's Kiria. Other laws, such as the banning of independent hierarchical organizations and capital punishment for nirik transformations, though seldom enforced, should likewise be removed. We must allow our society to grow with our nation, and these restrictions instead stunt it. Make nirik transformation a misdemeanor like public intoxication and do away with the rest, and we will be one step closer to a functional modern society."\n\nThough most kirin nodded in agreement, Winter Frost rose to voice her counterpoints. "While I may personally agree that some of these restrictions are trivial, were they not Concord's divine intention, passed through her previous avatar, Matriarch Charm?" she began. "Removing them would be blasphemy, and it is not up to us to decide what should be done. That is Matriarch Rain Shine's decision, not ours. But I must outright reject your proposal to remove the capital punishment on nirik transformations, Current. We need a strong deterrent to prevent the transformation into the nirik state, now more than ever. Remove that and we only feed more fuel to the fire. Tempers will flare, and another bout of nirik transformations will be the calamity that sees all our progress permanently undone. It is not a risk we can afford to take, and so the only way to control it is to punish it with the harshest penalty imaginable. So, kirin of the Plenum, do we abandon the safeguards that prevented the complete destruction of our nation a century ago, or do we remember our traditions and the reasons why these safeguards were implemented in the first place?""
kirin.18.a:0 "Kirin society must modernize with the nation."
kirin.18.b:0 "These laws were passed for a reason, and that reason is still valid today."

kirin.19.t:0 "Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom"
kirin.19.d_1:0 "It was a nice change of pace, Autumn Blaze calmly noted, to be able to gather with the leaders of the other factions and enjoy dinner and drinks together after a hard day of hammering out policy and reform at the Plenum. It wasn't every day that the clique leaders could put aside their differences and enjoy a meal together—Winter Frost and Fickle Current certainly weren't inviting each other over for tea after a long day arguing—but on the rare days when the Plenum could pass its agenda nearly unanimously (or at least without heated arguments), Autumn liked to take the two out for dinner afterwards and relax. It helped to remind everykirin that they were all kirin and partners in this endeavor, not enemies to be defeated.\n\n"I think we can all agree that the ending of the Quiescence was for the betterment of our realm," Fickle Current said as they waited for their meals to be brought out to them. "One by one, we've rolled back Matriarch Noctilucent Charm's decrees that stifled our education system and banned the study of science, religion, and philosophy outside of what we already knew in 903. That's the mark of progress, right there."\n\n"The new freedom of information is helping us unravel more of Concord's mysteries," Winter Frost agreed. "Concord lives in science and philosophy as much as she does in our religion. The Way of Fire is not merely a matter of theology, it is the foundation of our society and everything that we do. Exploring how Concord's divinity influences the natural world around us is just as important as understanding how we can better strive to follow her teachings."\n\n"I recently read a report that came across my desk saying that the number of schools in the realm has multiplied a hundredfold in such a short time," Autumn added. "More kirin are gaining the gift of education than ever before, and at a higher quality than even we thought imaginable when we first started. That's cause for celebration, I think."\n\n"Agreed," Current said, and he lifted up his drink in his magic, prompting Autumn and Winter to do the same. "A toast, then, to Kiria's progress. We are making a dream that once seemed impossible into tomorrow's reality.""
kirin.19.d_2:0 "It was usually a nice change of pace, Autumn Blaze noted, to gather her fellow leaders of the Plenum together for dinner after a successful and (mostly) argument-free day. It was a good way to remind everykirin that they were all on the same team and all wanted to modernize Kiria; just because they had different ideas on how to go about it, they weren't supposed to be enemies in this process. She had hoped that today would be another one of those days, where Winter Frost and Fickle Current could stop going at each other's throats for an evening over a shared enjoyment of a good meal, but it was clear that things weren't going according to plan.\n\n"Repealing the Quiescence was supposed to be a good step forward," Winter Frost bemoaned. "Opening up the study of science, religion, and philosophy was supposed to foster a renewed vigor in the exploration of The Way of Fire. But Rising Sun and her heretics have hijacked it for their own agenda! They're using modern printing presses to print thousands of copies of Her Incandescent Will, a text that was banned for good reason before The Silence, under the guise of freedom of speech! They twist Concord's divine will to suit their own heretical interpretations of a communalistic society. Who knows how many righteous followers that harlot has corrupted with her blasphemy? She should have been run out of Vermilion the moment she showed her face in the Matriarch's holy presence!"\n\nFickle Current remained unsympathetic. "Perhaps if your fellow mystics did not shun progress, Rising Sun would not be outcompeting you," he said. "You fear printing presses and the inventions of modern society. You try to copy the teachings of The Way of Fire by hoof and horn with quill and ink, and act surprised when Rising Sun's followers print a thousand copies of her texts for every one of yours? Perhaps this is why The Way of Fire is losing influence while The Rising Fire grows ever stronger."\n\nWinter Frost slammed her hooves down on the table and abruptly stood up, glaring at Fickle Current. "If you will not support Concord's teachings and her holy will, then I will not share a meal with you," she growled, much to Autumn's dismay. "I am leaving." She turned to Autumn only to say "Good night, Premier," then stormed out of the restaurant without waiting for her meal to arrive. Fickle Current merely shrugged and watched her go, keeping his thoughts to himself."

It was one of three early dreadnoughts that had formed the backbone of the Vermilion Armada before the Silence, and when it was scuttled along with its two sister ships, it had been one of the most advanced seafaring vessels in the world. Nowadays it would have been horrifically obsolete, of course, but some salvage and retrofitting would turn it into a serviceable, if outdated, foundation for a new Vermilion Armada.\n\nThe history of the ships was something that every foal of Fragrance knew well, and Current was no exception. The ships had taken part in the Armada mutinies after The Silence was passed, where the sailors of the Armada attempted to seize their old ships, mothballed for ten years by that point, and strike into the open waters as pirates, mercenaries, and smugglers; anything to provide for Fragrance's swiftly impoverished populace. Soldiers from Vermilion had suppressed the mutiny and retook most of the mothballed ships, immediately scuttling them to prevent a second mutiny. It was just another insult in a long list from the imperial capital, and the message it sent was crystal clear: Vermilion expected Fragrance to quietly huddle up and die, and any attempts the city made to save itself were treason. That humiliation stung deep, and the hateful lessons it had taught had simmered for a hundred years.\n\nBut today was a new day. Like the ships of the line returning from the murky depths of the harbor, Fragrance was beginning to return to yesteryear's glory. These ships, raised in Fragrance and launched from its drydocks, would be the first to safeguard Kiria's post-Silence maritime interests. Fragrance, just like them, was leading the way for a post-Silence Kiria.

kirin.22.d:0 "Winter Frost tongued the inside of her cheek in contemplative thought as she watched the latest ship from Griffonia sail into port. It was a cargo freighter loaded with goods from the griffon lands, but Winter was more interested in the creatures on it. Some were griffons, a few were ponies, but most were kirin. They were all employed by the Sycee Trading House, one of Kiria's oldest trading houses, yet few of the kirin on board had ever seen their ancestral homelands. Sycee fled the Realm with its businesses when The Silence started, and had maintained its success overseas by employing members of the kirin diaspora to sail its ships and to protect them with their lives. It too was coming home, just like its employees, and Kiria had Fickle Current to thank for that.\n\nWinter herself wasn't as thankful as the rest of the Plenum about that. Sycee was brought back because it had experience fending off pirates and protecting its cargo with well-trained seafarer marines, and Kiria had a pirate problem on Auburn Isle. Kiria needed the return of Sycee's business to establish foreign trade and to use its marines as a stopgap measure until it could train its own army and navy. But this was Fickle Current's work, and everything that kirin did was done with his friends' best interests on his mind, interests that seemed to frequently overlap with making more money. While the marines might officially have been placed under the command of the Vermilion Banner Army, Winter doubted that their loyalties moved as quickly as their supposed allegiance. Were these kirin truly ready to serve their Matriarch, or were they still the Sycee Trading House's creatures? If push came to shove, Winter wasn't sure she wanted to be in the room when the Realm found out.\n\nOne thing was certain, she knew. Fickle and his cronies were strengthening their own position while addressing the Realm's problems. Winter and her fellow mystics would have to keep pace if they wanted to keep the heart and soul of Kiria firmly devoted to Concord and Her Matriarch."

kirin.23.d:0 "The picket lines had already been erected around the factory by the time Fickle Current's automobile pulled up in front of it, with dozens of kirin workers standing behind them. They held signs and chanted slogans, and one of them had gathered a sizable pile of rocks that could easily be turned into missiles at a moment's notice. Though soot and smog hung in the Fragrance air, the factory behind them was unmistakably silent, the gears of modernity ground to a halt by the striking workers.\n\nCurrent frowned and stepped out of the car, moving along behind the cordon of private detectives and security staff that had assembled to face the striking workers. He found Cypress Snow watching from a vantage point, a similarly displeased look on his face. The two nodded at each other in greeting, and then both turned their attention to the striking workers. "They don't have any Rising Fire priests with them," Fickle noted.\n\n"It's not the communalist heretics this time," Cypress said, shaking his head. "It's just some workers unionizing and sharing subversive leftist literature. There are a few rabble-rousers operating within the city who might have imported it from Stalliongrad, Prywhen, Skynavia - not that where it came from really matters. What matters is that these ideas are spreading in the city, and filling their heads with nonsense."\n\n"Then it looks like the Rising Fire has a modern competitor, and we have a nuisance to deal with." The sight of the protesting workers and the sounds of their chants took Current back to his days in Skyfall, where he had seen similar unrest play out before. "We know the playbook then. This is nothing we haven't dealt with in Skyfall."\n\n"Right. We bring in scabs from someplace rural and tell them they're getting good-paying jobs, which will let the factory get cheap replacement for the strikers. Then we kick the squatters out and crack some skulls if we have to. The company's pockets are deep enough to get some mercenaries together for a raid. Maybe Sycee will be willing to part with some of its marines for a bit." Cypress then turned to Fickle and frowned. "But we have to get control of this now and stamp the movement out at the source before it gets worse. We know how this goes, because we've seen it before. We'll have to be proactive here. Find whatever subversive is stirring the workforce up, and deal with them. The last thing we need is to lose Fragrance to the proles."

kirin.24.d:0 ""Ships spotted off the port bow! Gunners, at your stations!"\n\nFickle Current looked up from his book as sailors scrambled about the steamer, spurred on by the captain's call to arms. Setting it aside, the businesskirin climbed up to the top deck, dodging a few sailors hurriedly moving up and down the stairs leading into the ship's hull, and found a spot along the port side of the ship, where a marine squinted out over the waters with a frown. "Ships?" Current asked him, spotting three outdated junks sailing towards the steamer. "Are they pirates?"\n\n"We're close to Hyacinth, so aye, likely," the marine responded. "They aren't answering our signals, so they're likely part of the Nacre Armada. Not to worry, though. The forward gun on this ship can turn them all into splinters before we get in range of their muskets and cannons."\n\nFickle nodded, his ears flattening as the steamer's forward gun let loose a warning shot to ward off the approaching ships, the shell creating a plume of frothy white water where it landed. As he watched, the junks threw up the black flag, though one barely had a chance to raise it to the top of its mast before a kill shot from the steamer's gun crumpled the wooden hull in on itself. The marines let out a cheer, even as futile musket shot from the surviving junks began to splash the water off the steamer's port side, though that abruptly stopped when a booming clang rang out and the ship lurched to port, sending Fickle Current tumbling to the side.\n\n"Submarine!" somekirin yelled, but it was too late. The submarine had surfaced from directly underneath the steamer, and from its hatches burst forth a swarm of pirates, armed to the teeth with swords and antiquated firearms. Ropes flew up over the starboard rails, and the subsequent onslaught of the pirate boarding party overwhelmed the marines, who could only muster a token resistance before they lost the deck.\n\nFleeing from the carnage, Fickle stumbled through the steamer's narrow corridors, sighing in relief as he ran into a quartet of sailors armed with rifles and bayonets, prepared to fight on in a rearguard action belowdecks. But hurtling out of a side corridor was a mare garbed in splendid raiment with two swords held aloft in her magic, falling upon the unprepared sailors with her twirling blades and cutting them down in a flurry of steel. She grinned as Current tried to slide to a stop, and before he could gallop the other way, spun one of her swords around in her magical grip and smashed the pommel against the scales under his horn."

kirin.25.d:0 "Fickle Current sat in the corner of his dark cell, wondering how much time had passed since his last meal of stale bread and rice wine. He'd awoken in the black abyss convinced he was dead, and it wasn't until the heavy metal door opened for his first meal that he'd seen any light. But apart from when a slot in the door opened to give him his meals, it was barred shut. The walls of the cell were all brick, and the one time he had managed to work himself up into enough of a rage to try and tap into the nirik taboo to burn a way out of his cell, he couldn't find a flammable weak spot to set fire to. All he'd accomplished was burning his suit to ashes, and the experience had left him dizzy, disoriented, and sick. Another attempt was off the table.\n\nHoofsteps approached, and Current looked up, turning to where he thought the door was supposed to be. Keys turned in the lock, and the door squealed on rusty hinges as it opened outwards. Torchlight blinded the stallion, and he had to cover his face for a few moments to let his eyes adjust to the sudden light. When he could see again, he looked up to see a kirin mare standing over him, and he quickly realized it was the same one who had knocked him out during the ambush. "You," he croaked, recoiling slightly from her. "What do you want? What happened to the crew? To the ship?"\n\nHis response was a biting slap across his face, hard enough to rattle his teeth together. "Quiet, and listen," the mare said, frowning at him. "My name is Roaring Fire. The pirates of the Auburn Isle sail under my command, and the kirin of Nacre call me their matriarch and protector. I have come to bargain." Roaring Fire gestured vaguely to the outside world. "Your friends in Fragrance paid your ransom, and so I am letting you go. A ship will take you back to Hyacinth, where your navy is waiting to put its hoof to my neck and break the back of my armada. That is a fight I cannot win. But I know you are also staring down a fight you cannot win, and so I want to make a deal." She squatted down and thought her next words over carefully, the jewelry in her mane jingling faintly in the darkness of the cell. "I don't just have buccaneers, I have spies. I know what you want. I know that the NAKP is training paramilitaries and preparing for the worst. And should the worst come to pass... wouldn't it be better to have more friends on your side than enemies?"\n\nShe dug through her robes and pulled out a white candle with a jade wick. "This candle has been enchanted by dragon fire. Burn a message in it, and I will receive it. Your navy will take Auburn Isle, but they will not find my armada here. But rest assured, I will answer the call when you need me.""

But he soon realized there was no fight to be had; the pirates were already long gone, just as Roaring Fire had promised, and not a shot was fired in the capture of the island. The prancing kirin banner of the Vermilion Realm soon replaced the black flag hanging from the flagpole in the center of Nacre, and the marines let out a cheer while the townsfolk sullenly watched their home fall to the invaders, their once mighty pirate armada having abandoned them.\n\n"Guess even pirates know when a fight's lost," the junk's captain remarked to Current from his side. "Smart move on their part. The Flotilla would have broken that fleet into driftwood, even if they had a submarine hiding in it. Without their base in Nacre, the armada's going to fracture and wither away. We'll have a couple more raids I'm sure, but their glory days are done."\n\nCurrent silently nodded along, remembering the offer Roaring Fire made him, and how he'd spurned it. She'd been enraged and had nearly turned nirik on him, but had enough common sense to realize when she was beat and to cut her losses and run. He doubted he'd seen the last of her, but even if he hadn't, it wouldn't be too long before somekirin did her in. The captain was right; without Nacre to supply her armada, Roaring Fire's days were numbered, hers and the rest of her pirate brethren.\n\nIt was another victory for the NAKP and the Realm as a whole."

Roaring Fire had let them take Nacre, on the assumption that she'd one day get it back. Doubtless that would be what she would ask for in return for her services to the NAKP; she'd make a useful governor at any rate, given how the kirin of Nacre loved her. In the meanwhile, she would take her armada to some other hideaway and lay low for a while, maybe sustaining herself off of raiding the Zebrides and the Zebrican southeast until Current called for her. He absentmindedly touched the small candle tucked away in his suit. One letter and a spark of fire, and he'd have the entirety of Roaring Fire's armada at his disposal.\n\nThe board was set and the pieces were in position.

"I am a proud son of Fragrance," he proclaimed, sternly scowling at Roaring Fire. "I am a reputable businesskirin and I will not stoop so low as to consorting with criminal scum to get what I need. I do not need you, and so I will not dirty myself with your help."\n\nRoaring Fire bared her teeth, and red flames began to lick at the edges of her mane. Her eyes turned piercing white, and her teeth elongated into vicious daggers as her rage started to consume her. "Insolent fool!" she growled, her voice taking on a demonic edge as she slipped closer to the nirik state. "I should flay you alive! Hammer nails under your scales and peel them off one by one! You will know pain when I am through with you!"\n\nBut Current stood his ground. "You would not dare hurt me," he stated. "If you lay a hoof on me, your armada will be hunted to the ends of the earth. You can flee from Nacre, but my friends will make sure every single one of your ships is found and sunk, and every single one of your pirates is executed for their crimes. Face it; the age of piracy is over. You are a dying breed, a last gasp of a lawless time. But I am the face of law and order in Kiria. I am the face of progress. I am the face of the future. And the future does not need you anymore."\n\nHe stood up and looked down his muzzle at the angry pirate captain before him. "You gambled everything on this, didn't you?" he asked her. "You wanted to kidnap me, to try and convince me of my own desperation so you could make a career change and be my mercenaries? We do not need more mercenaries. We can afford trained professionals should we need it, not an undisciplined pirate rabble. No, you will not save yourself this way. The only way you save yourself is to let me go, take your ransom, and try to start again somewhere else. I know it. You know it. Now let's stop dancing around the point anymore, shall we?"\n\nEven after all that, Current still harbored a little worry at seeing the half-transformed nirik in front of him, but after a few moments, the flames went out and Roaring Fire returned to her kirin form. "Fine," she spat, turning away from him. "Have it your way then. Pray that you never see me again, Current, because you do not want to see what happens when you trap a pirate like a caged animal.""

kirin.280.d:0 "When Brown Beurré had first moved to Fragrance from abroad, just after the Silence was lifted, her heart had gone out to the poor city kirin that she found there. Destitute, gutted by the Silence, they scratched a living out wherever they could and struggled to earn their daily rice. "At least the kirin in the country could feed themselves," she mused, bitterly, as she lowered the morning's typeset into her cantankerous little printing press. She had quite a scathing pamphlet to print today – and would need to take the press apart and hide it before she hit the streets to distribute.\n\nIn the past month, the Plenum's latest decrees about agrarian consolidation had taken a hard toll on Fragrance. Every day, caravans of poor farmers whose land had been bought out by the state wandered into Fragrance, having been promised jobs, homes, and all the amenities of a modern city. What they found was an increasingly overcrowded and dirty slum still struggling to recover, the same as everywhere else. Brown Beurré had interviewed kirin across the city in the past week, and the verdict was clear. Perhaps modernizing the countryside was important – but Fragrance was buckling under the strain of its new arrivals.\n\nOutside her window, she could hear an argument about some merchant's outrageous prices. Rents were rising, and the cost of food was not far behind.\n\nHer article was an open, anonymous letter to the NAKP and to Mayor Cherry Blossom, demanding that they take immediate action to feed, clothe, and house the masses streaming into the city. If measures were not announced, her letter called for a protest blocking the city's wharves for an afternoon. With how busy the reopened port was getting, even just an afternoon's disruption would surely get the attention Fragrance's masses sorely needed.\n\nWhether anykirin would actually show up... well. She had to be hopeful that the city's unfortunates would be willing to stand up for themselves.\n\nThe shouts outside Beurré's window grew louder, and she could hear a mother pleading that she had fillies to feed.

You shoulder a great deal of responsibility as premier, yet you do not have to tackle everything alone."\n\nAutumn sighed and set her teacup down. "Kiria is about to fall into famine," she said in a dour tone. "Fragrance and Rhapsody have urbanized so rapidly with the returning diaspora that they're draining our granaries and warehouses months faster than originally planned. Our population is beginning to boom while fewer kirin work the fields now than they did in the Silence. Agricultural output isn't keeping up, and unless this year's harvest doubles last year's, kirin will starve come the winter."\n\n"We need to modernize our farming techniques alongside our society," Current swiftly concluded. "Neither you nor I are farmers, but I did learn of new techniques being developed in Griffonia before I left. One of the more interesting ones was close planting. Triple the density of seedlings in a plot, then double it once the first batch has had time to settle into the soil. The thought is that plants of the same species won't compete against each other, returning greater yields from smaller plots of land. Alongside that, we can try deep plowing the fields. The soil at the top of the earth is what crops use up year after year, draining it of fertility until it becomes barren dust. But plow deeper, and more fertile, untouched soil may be found. That would ensure healthy yields for our farmers."\n\nAutumn chewed on her lip as she tried to determine if what Current was saying was actually making sense. "Do you have any evidence that worked in Griffonia? We're not farmers, so we can't afford to act on something without proof it will work."\n\n"Correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't the first planting season start soon?" When Autumn nodded, he continued. "The Morning Secretariat is slow. Dreadfully so. I appreciate the merits in sussing out the finer details of the proposals that cross its floor, but it sounds like we don't have time to wait on them. If we're going to adopt these techniques, a decision needs to be made now before the farmers start planting. At any rate, the Sorghum Foundry owns large plots of farmland in Peace-and-Plenty.

Now, after arguing that a renewal of the Accords would give Kiria more funding and more resources to successfully finish the Plan, she found herself met with nothing short of revolt by the other two parties in the Plenum.\n\n"You would give Equestria a greater share of our resources, a greater control over our nation's wealth, a greater influence in the lives of every kirin in this country?"

"We are a nation supported by the strength of our faith in Concord and The Way of Fire. What we are lacking is not material tools, but faith! The Equestrians do not worship Concord; they do not believe in The Way of Fire. How are we supposed to create a righteous nation if we stray from the divine will of our goddess to do so?"\n\n"We are not sacrificing anything!" Autumn protested.

The Reform Bureau has already made great progress on preliminary talks! The terms the Equestrians offer us are generous and honest; they favor us more than they favor them.

Kiria is strained in a way it never has been before. There's so much social upheaval and cultural change that we're enduring that if we're not careful, the entire Realm could come crashing down around us. But I'm confident that we can do this without breaking our nation. We've come this far, and we won't trip and fall before we cross the finish line.

Faster and more efficiently, perhaps, but drawbacks like this are hardly unexpected.

Her parents had been as thrilled and ecstatic about her accomplishments as ever, but even for the ever-talkative Autumn, she needed a little bit of time to herself to relax her mind and take a break. So, spying the hill she used to sled down in the winter, Autumn turned toward it and began to canter up its grassy slopes, humming to herself as she trotted.\n\nIt had been an exhausting few weeks, but everywhere in Massicot, the decorations hung from buildings and strung between rooftops served as an easy reminder of the fruits of her labor. She had just finished a chaotic two weeks of trying to organize the mid-autumn festival as a national holiday, a task that, coupled with her usual duties, had left her mentally drained by the time the Matriarch had given her permission to return to Massicot and celebrate the festival with her family. The festival was in full swing, and the streets were filled with music and singing and laughter, but away from town, under the full moon, the world was quiet and peaceful.\n\nWhen she climbed the hill, however, she was surprised to find her friend Fern Flare sitting there, having a picnic dinner as she watched foals chase each other through the meadow with paper lanterns while their parents relaxed nearby. She didn't so much announce her presence as she did trot over to Fern's blanket and flop down onto it with a groan, and Fern only chuckled as she offered Autumn a mooncake. "Busy day, premier?"\n\n"Please, for the love of Concord, do not call me that tonight," Autumn groaned, taking the mooncake and biting into it. It was delicious, just as she remembered, and it put a little bit of energy back into her. But having Fern use her official title made her frown. "Fern? You ever feel like there's a huge weight on our shoulders that's gonna crush us flat if we take one wrong step? Because I do. All of Kiria is depending on me to hold things together. I'm the one standing between this happy night and civil war. I have nightmares about the Plenum erupting into a chaotic inferno, of riots in the streets, of our home burning to the ground. It's just... it's a lot, you know? It's almost too much for one mare to bear."\n\n"Then it's a good thing you're not just one mare, Autumn," Fern said. "We're all with you. You've got the Matriarch on your side. You can do this. If ever there was a mare for the job, it's you." Then she smiled at her. "Now come on, cheer up.

"Want me to give you the quick briefing, or would you rather read for yourself?"\n\n"I trust you'll get your point across," Autumn said, pulling the binder over towards herself.

"Well, it appears that the Incendiaries are supported by the Rising Fire, which I don't think should come as much of a surprise at any rate. The Rising Fire has been heavily involved in supporting the anti-modernism of the peasant farmers, and using their heretic priests to encourage farmers to join the Incendiaries is a logical next step. They're pushing for a full-blown revolution to punish the northern capitalists and the imperial administration of Vermilion for trying to cram the modernisation of the Grand Gallop Onward down their throats. Once they tear down Vermilion's authority, they want to create a communalist harmony over Kiria. Of course they see Matriarch Rain Shine as a hapless figure entangled in our own agendas, otherwise they couldn't claim any shred of divine legitimacy to keep their movement together, but their goals are very anti-Matriarch to say the least."\n\n"I see," Autumn said, nodding along. "In that case, I think it's best we get the Reform Bureau involved. We can have it take actions against the Rising Fire radicals in the Plenum, for a start, and start to address the grievances that are driving farmers into the Incendiaries' movement. But that'll only be treating the symptoms, which is all we can hope for. The Grand Gallop Onward itself is the root cause of all of this, and as much as I want to help everykirin, we can't abandon it for a few disgruntled farmers. Once it completes, the farmers will thank us for everything we did for them. I guarantee it.""

"I've put together everything I could find on the Incendiaries for you," she said, placing a binder down on Autumn's desk. "Want me to give you the quick briefing, or would you rather read for yourself?"\n\n"I trust you'll get your point across," Autumn said, pulling the binder over towards herself. "I mean, that's why I hired you in the first place, right?"\n\n"Right," Cinder Glow agreed, and she took a breath before starting. "The Incendiaries are, surprisingly enough, being motivated and organized by ultraorthodox Way of Fire priests and mystics. They see the entire modernisation deal as an affront to Concord's divine will, interpreted as the Silence decrees of Matriarch Noctilucent Charm, and they think that Rain Shine was pressured or tricked by the Equestrians into repealing those decrees and letting modernisation back into Kiria so they could subvert our religion. They want to cancel the Grand Gallop Onward immediately and roll back all our modernisation efforts so far, reestablishing harmony and peace with nature and Concord's teachings, no matter how bad The Silence was for the Realm over the past century. But perhaps the most disturbing thing is that they're starting to get the peasants to believe it too. The Grand Gallop Onward can't continue if the commonkirin start to believe that The Silence was better than this period of modernisation we're going through."\n\n"This is why I never made it very far in becoming a priestess," Autumn mused, shaking her head. "The mystics like to encourage kirin to let Concord do all the thinking for them and not think for themselves. And Concord's voice sometimes just happens to align with what the spiritual caste wants." She sighed and grabbed a piece of paper to write some notes on. "We can use the Reform Bureau to delegitimize those mystics who are supporting the Incendiaries and oust them from The Way of Fire, which should hopefully help fix things if they can't claim they're speaking with Concord's will. And it won't even bother Winter Frost and her faction, which is good. Winter might be traditionalist, but she's not THAT traditionalist. I'm sure she'll be happy to help get the ultraorthodox mystics out of her mane, too.""

"The most shocking thing is that it's actually the NAKP that's behind this. Or, at least, Fickle Current's cronies are funding the Incendiaries to further their own goals. It's probably not a false flag operation, but unrest and instability in the countryside would benefit them a lot, actually. If the countryside and native population is restless and angry, it further encourages the returnees to rally around the NAKP and use their wealth to help fill the party coffers, which they can use to increasingly militarize and consolidate their influence over Fragrance and Rhapsody. They've been buying a lot of modern weaponry and even bringing in tacticians from Griffonia to help train their paramilitary police forces. By all accounts, it looks like they're gearing up for a struggle, and the Incendiaries are just a pawn in their movement."\n\n"Fickle Current just keeps finding ways to turn a mare off," Autumn said, sticking out her tongue in disgust. "I knew he was sleazy, but this is just on an entirely different level. And even if he's not personally behind it, his buddies are, and he likely knows about it." She took a piece of paper and scribbled some notes down on it. "I'll have the Reform Bureau censure the NAKP and give Current and his cronies a sharp rebuke for what they're doing. Proving it in court would be an entirely different beast, but even letting them know that we're onto them and the Matriarch is displeased should put a stop to their efforts. Anykirin who's found to be responsible for this is not going to hold onto their power in the NAKP when they lose the Matriarch's favor, and power is what those kirin desire the most.""

Not that Autumn hadn't expected it—she certainly had—but she had hoped it would be a little bit less chaotic than it was now. Now, with the wheels of the Grand Gallop Onward officially set in motion, she found herself trying her hardest to stay on top of everything happening all at once. And that, to be quite honest, was an exceptionally difficult task for a mare who had never entered politics before being hoof-picked by Rain Shine to be the Imperial Premier.\n\nOne way she had tried to wrap her head around everything that was swiftly transpiring in Vermilion was by inviting local leaders from across the Realm to tea. Those meetings had been very fruitful, and Autumn felt she knew more about what she was dealing with in the Realm because of them. And not only was she getting to understand the kirin from each province and city better, she was starting to see just what problems had been festering during the stagnation of The Silence that needed to be addressed. Case in point: an old bannerkirin from Verdant, an elderly mare whose grandmother before her had served in Matriarch Noctilucent Charm's banner army, and who had seen much in her long life.\n\n"The Silence wasn't so bad in Verdant," the mare said, only partly to Autumn's surprise; the older kirin generally were familiar and comfortable with the stagnation of The Silence, and weren't keen to move out of it. "There, the priests and mystics of The Rising Fire found a way to adapt the city to the decrees of The Silence. They're nothing like the kirin you brought into Vermilion to dictate policy with wealth and pedigree; no, The Rising Fire understands the common kirin, the farmers and fisherkirin, the poor and uneducated. Some here in Vermilion call The Rising Fire a heresy, but to the kirin of Verdant and the poor kirin everywhere whom they appeal to, The Rising Fire is salvation, a helping hoof where The Way of Fire abandoned them. Remember that, Premier, as you shape the future of our Realm in the majestic buildings of Vermilion. The kirin who argue with you on the floor are not the only ones who will live in the future you create. And, if push comes to shove, they certainly aren't the most numerous. The success of this Grand Gallop Onward will be decided by the governed, not the governing. Remember the poor, or somekirin else will.""

kirin.36.d:0 "Rain Shine watched with awe as the metal monster chugged into Vermilion, though she hid it under the mask of quiet and dignified splendor she'd learned to show for her subjects over the years. The newly-built Vermilion Grand Central Terminus was packed with kirin of all trots of life, jammed so close together that the regiment of bannerkirin brought on for security struggled to keep the crowd from pushing them onto the glistening steel tracks in the station. Nokirin wanted to miss the exciting event, and though Rain Shine knew that her presence as Matriarch was a formality, a media stunt, she couldn't deny that she found it all exciting as well. After all, there would only ever be one first train from Radiance to Vermilion, reestablishing the link between the Realm's capital and its traditional gateway along the coast. This moment, mundane as it normally otherwise would have been, meant something fantastic for so many kirin, and for the prosperity of the Realm itself.\n\nWhen the train finally rolled into the station, everykirin present let out a cheer and stomped their hooves for the pony engineers at the controls. As the engineers were escorted out of the engine and feted with garlands, food, and rice wine, Rain Shine serenely smiled out over the crowd. "With the completion of the Vermilion-Radiance Line, our Realm is once again a part of the outside world," she announced, to much hooting and hollering. "This marvel is the first fruit of what I sincerely hope will be a bountiful harvest between our humble Realm and our generous partners, the ponies of Equestria. Hoof in hoof, I pray to Concord in all of Her glory that our two nations will have many more partnerships of mutual friendship and cooperation such as this one."\n\nThen, to the surprise and awe of the crowd assembled, Rain Shine stepped forward with her entourage and boarded the train as kirin engineers replaced the ponies in the train engine. The train whistled as Rain Shine waved out the window, and the crowd cheered as she made herself the first Matriarch Superior to ever travel the Realm by train."

And yet, as Matriarch Superior Rain Shine declared in Vermilion today, the Realm and its kirin have persevered. When the National Association of Kirin Patriots turned traitor, the Path of the Rising Fire remained loyal to the Realm, repaying the Premier tenfold for her decision to allow the Rising Fire into the Plenum all those years ago. United, Kiria stood firm against the Northern Secession and ultimately returned the errant north to the fold. In the end, Harmony prevailed, albeit at significant cost. Kiria and her kirin have endured the trial by fire of the civil war, and has come out stronger, more united and more resolute than before.\n\nRain Shine's address to the realm was broadcast live via radio as far away as Sorghum, and in a few years, new radio relays may allow the voice of the Matriarch to reach as far as Chrysanthemum and Verdant.

While some have already begun to criticize this new "consociationalist" government as permanently entrenching the elites of the parties already represented in the Secretariat, it cannot be denied that these complex power-sharing agreements, if held to, will be an important backstop against the kind of factional and regional rivalries that had so severely plagued the Grand Gallop Forward and the Three-and-a-half Year Plan."

The Constitutional Protection Brigade will soon complete its training and deploy to address concerns as they arise: the Office will also soon create civilian legal and investigative departments to assist in its mission, and various support services will also be created. The Office's mission should not trouble any kirin who does not intend to violently attack the principles of constitutional, consociational government."\n\nThus far, the Standard-Bearers have refused all questions regarding the conspicuous absence of any apparent loyalties to the Matriarch Superior."

Our professional firefighting brigades will partner with volunteer fire departments across the country to suppress both accidental nirik transformations and this unexcusable bout of attacks." The kirin giving this press conference was grizzled and old, and the reporters in the room had all included in their notes his prior service with the border-militias of the western provinces. Quite the stallion to place in charge of the newest of Kiria's internal security forces.\n\nA hoof shot up from the crowd. "Undersecretary Redwood," the reporter began, "what do you have to say about the new Reform Bureau Report indicating that most nirik attacks arise from social inequality? Do you think it's appropriate to send military police after downtrodden kirin?"\n\nThe Undersecretary gave an indignant huff. "'Social inequality' is not an excuse to burn down homes, businesses, schools, farms. All of which have been attacked. If kirin have complaints about how Kiria is run then they ought to petition their Matriarch or her Premier. If they want to throw a tantrum and burn this country down, they're going to have to get through me.""

Mayflower Bloom was before the imposing Central Committee of the All-Kiria Collegium, appealing the rejection of her research proposal by one of the ethics committees. The chairkirin continued "Your proposal is very well-polished, if disturbing. Setting aside the question of whether this Collegium would ever approve of what seems to be nothing short of a eugenics programme, I am troubled by your methodology. You suggest intentionally inducing nirik transformation for study."\n\nMayflower stiffened. She had honestly expected to be grilled on the eugenics first. "Yes, Chair. Proving the connection between nirik transformations and heredity, and demonstrating that greater or lesser inclinations towards our nirik halves can be inherited, is a first step in the broader project of-"\n\nShe was cut off by the chair, who, she was starting to realize, had already made up his mind. "Yes, your aspirations to breed the nirik state out of the population are more than clear. My concern, again, is with your methodology. Excluding completely that forcing a nirik transformation amounts to psychological torture, just how do you expect the Collegium to defend itself when the religious authorities get word that we are funding this? We hardly have the prestige of the Aureolin Monastery to protect us. Your proposal will get this institution shuttered."\n\nMayflower opened her mouth to reply, but the session suddenly surged forward without her. A motion to reject her appeal was introduced and passed before she could say a word, and soon she was been ushered from the hall to her waiting friend, River Lily. "Oh I heard everything, Mayflower - I'm so sorry!" River Lily tried to hug Mayflower, but the mare shrugged her off, hanging her head low. "I know that proposal was really important to you, but, it doesn't have to be the end of your research, you just need to try again. But first, you need to get some fresh air, clear your head. You and me need to get out and see the countryside before you spend another minute working on this nirik business, it's just not healthy.""

From her last name, one could have expected Miss Mayflower Bloom to run on one of the NAKP-affiliated tickets, but she shocked the nation by announcing she had the backing of the staunchly left-wing Movement for a Modern Kiria.\n\nIt was not long before reports of her controversial - some would say disqualifyingly abhorrent - prior career as a researcher of nirik biology at the All-Kiria Collegium began to surface, but Miss Bloom met the criticism head-on. "I was wrong about kirin, niriks, and Kiria," she said, when cornered by reporters following her announcement speech, "and I intend to make amends for my past as Mayor." She refused further comment.\n\nHer professed programme of MMK policies would certainly seem that way. Her platform consists of a laundry-list of popular left-wing priorities, running the gamut from increased education funding to a powerful proposed Mayoral Commission on Labor and Employment. Other candidates appear to be scrambling as Mayflower's campaign surges into the fore, particularly after both the Peasant's Union and the Worker's Party of Kiria officially endorsed her in a coordinated press conference. One thing is certain - Mayflower's sharp wit and popular campaign represent a chink in the armor of the right's otherwise solid control of Greater Providence. Should she win, it would represent a decisive victory of the left over the NAKP-affiliated parties dominant in the north.\n\nMayflower Bloom's cousin, Ardent Bloom, the Fragrance-based influential chairkirin of the Realm Development Planning Commission and now, it seems, one of his cousin's chiefest political opponents, could not be reached for comment."

Mayflower said, and Lily huffed before letting go.\n\n"Only a few more days, and I'll have you all to myself again. And on the beaches of Jubilee, no less." Mayflower could only giggle back at Lily's enthusiasm. It was true. Two long but exciting years of MMK government in Radiance were drawing to a close. Soon she would be passing the torch to the next Mayor - her time at this level of politics had certainly been enriching, but Mayflower had known for a while that the job simply left her too busy to run again. She wanted a position where she could spend more time with Lily these days.\n\nIn two busy years, she had spearheaded new social programs, opened city ministries that now helped hundreds of kirin every day, stood up against a lockout in the city's canneries... but she hadn't had time to take a vacation with Lily.\n\n"More seriously," Lily said, setting an envelope onto Mayflower's desk.

Evidently she had moved up the ranks.\n\n"At any rate. The success of your reforms as Mayor of Radiance have not gone unnoticed in the Realm and Harmony Party. While we would never ask you to renounce your own party, the Premier, on the advice of several of her aides, is interested in bringing you into her government to oversee an ambitious package of upcoming social and economic reforms. To be blunt, the Premier hopes you can help replicate your success in Radiance across the whole of the Realm, if the MMK is willing to spare you."\n\nThe letter went on to provide a number of details about the post that Mayflower knew she could review later. The important thing was that this would hardly be the step back from politics she was hoping for. But the chance to help improve the lives of literally millions of kirin...\n\n"May, you look like you've seen a ghost," Lily said, putting a hoof onto Mayflower's shoulder and snapping her out of a trance she hadn't realized she'd slipped into.

Such a sharp-tongued critic of the war coming from within the infamous Bloom family itself has not gone unnoticed, but in spite of all attempts to silence her, Mayflower penned her master-stroke against the war today. Earlier this morning, a troop transport docked in Radiance, discharging wounded soldiers from the war in the south. And no sooner had the sight of bandaged and bedridden veterans clogging the wharves reached the city government, than Mayflower Bloom called a press conference with the chaos as her backdrop. Manipulative? Perhaps. Effective? The press certainly seemed to think so.\n\n"Radiance has always welcomed the world to Vermilion. What the Realm sowed abroad, was reaped and returned to us here. Good or bad, Radiance is where our doings come home to roost. And what has come home to us today? After we were promised riches and plenty streaming in from the South Sea? Ship after ship of bloodied bannerkirin spill onto our shore! And each day we are expected to load up another hold with bullets and barbed wire. Perhaps we can be excused for being dragged into something we did not expect in Talarayi, but can we ever be forgiven for doubling, tripling down on a campaign of conquest and colonialism? How can Kiria ever last, trying to be a democracy at home and a slave-driving tyranny abroad? How many more shiploads of broken soldiers are we expected to quietly bear in the name of the NAKP's profits?"\n\nThe crowd seemed shocked by her harsh tone, but did not seem to heckle or disagree as she continued. "Let me make it clear that while I am Mayor, I will not bow to naked, shameless greed. I will not sit quietly by while a cabal of bloodthirsty generals, corrupt bureaucrats, and spinelessly greedy businesskirin drag a nation that has long loved peace deeper into their brutal war! And I trust in hope that neither will my city!" A chorus of agreement rose from the crowd, though most were paying more attention to the trickle of bandaged kirin disembarking behind her."

And not just end the war - completely, totally, unequivocally renounce everything that led us to this point.\n\nI demand the withdrawal of all Kirian troops from Talarayi and the immediate and complete disbandment of KIRFORS!\nI demand an immediate program of reparations to the zebras of Talarayi for the blood we have spilled and the treasures we have looted!\nI demand an independent commission to investigate all allegations of war crimes committed by KIRFORS in the war!\nI demand that the South Sea Venture Company be immediately dissolved, its assets nationalized, and its proprietors prosecuted for their brutality and warmongering!\nAnd I demand that the Constitution of the Realm be amended to prohibit the Secretariat from ever authorizing such a naked campaign of conquest again!"\n\nIn the hours after Mayflower's speech, talk of strike actions, of solidarity, of draft-dodging and sit-ins, rippled through Radiance and through much of Greater Providence. Popular support for the Far South Intervention was never high, and Mayflower's shocking backdrop of wounded kirin as she denounced Autumn Blaze's acquiesence to the war has certainly struck a chord with many."

"Kaolin National has always valued individualism, hard work, and the value of the free market, but perhaps most importantly, we are firm believers in Kirian patriotism. Unlike the other powerhouses of the economy, KN is a true Kirian corporation without any roots or ties to foreign investors or capital. The revival and rise of Kiria has provided wonderful opportunities to succeed, and in the economic boom that followed, KN took advantage of the tremendous demand for natural resources and raw material for the Realm's flourishing construction and manufacturing market."\n\n"A true investment in the Realm. You love to see it," Flash said, and then her tone shifted from supportive to questioning. "I do have to ask, of course, about the mass redundancy accusations, and the headlines about your lobbyists working hard to prevent the implementation of ongoing minimum wage legislation in the Morning Secretariat. How can KN claim to be a champion of Kirian interests when the company fights so hard to deny rights to its workers and punishes those who step out of line?"\n\nMoon flashed Flash a sharp glare, though it faded as she gave her answer. "Grit and hard work separate the wheat from the chaff, and KN's interests are the interests of the Realm. Our close work with the military means that success for KN is safety for the Realm. We are a meritocracy, not a charity."\n\n"Then how can you justify KN receiving subsidies from the government?"

Under the watchful eye of - and some allege the guiding hoof of - the Realm Development Planning Commission, a juggernaut of northern industrial might has emerged, with a name befitting its aspirations. The Kiria Integrated Resource-Industrial Network Holding Group, or simply KIRIN, began life as a conglomerate of the Sycee Trading House's industrial interests just a few short months ago. And while the money seems to trace back exclusively to Sycee, every NAKP businesskirin and politician is proudly promoting their role in cutting through red tape so that KIRIN could expand. No official documentation has surfaced, but Ardent Bloom and Cypress Snow are alleged to hold a majority of KIRIN's shares between them.\n\nKIRIN has described its business model as "opportunistic acquisition of troubled assets in a long-term growth strategy." KIRIN's detractors have described it as nothing less than a predatory hyper-hegemon, the kind of monopolistic entity that has come to define the aspirations of a modern KirCorpn. Increasingly buying up everything from mines to textile plants to shipyards, KIRIN's seemingly bottomless coffers have allowed it to secure almost total dominance of the economy of Greater Providence. Whether buying a new set of saddlebags or negotiating contracts for modern fighter aircraft, a kirin north of Vermilion is probably doing their business almost exclusively with companies held by KIRIN.\n\nSycee Trading House took the company public at an extremely ritzy conference and gala held in Sycee over the past few days. NAKP grandees, government officials, prominent businessmares, and every stockbroker worth their salt in Kiria could be found in attendance, sipping complimentary KIRIN-branded malt from the Holding Group's recent expansion into the brewing industry.

Instead, Kaolin National, the rising homegrown star of the Kirian economy, has been given a controversial grant of authority to ensure autarky and self-sufficiency in Kiria.\n\nThe Kaolin National Resource Allocation Division seems part public-private partnership, part state-owned corporation, and part central planning committee. The new KoNRAD Board of Directors reflects its eclectic makeup - government ministers, elected delegates, appointed technocrats, and of course, Kaolin National's own executives form a group of strange bedfellows to be leading the economic development of Kiria.\n\nIn a joint press conference between the government and KoNRAD, KN CEO Midnight Moon seemed almost giddy. "I'm proud that the government has entrusted this important duty to Kaolin National. Like we would for any client, we promise the Realm nothing less than the best. I can guarantee that over the next few years, KoNRAD will be responsible for tens of thousands of new jobs and millions of tons of affordable raw materials for our growing economy.

kirin.740.d:0 "The instructor levelled her stern gaze at the hoof being raised near the back. "Yes, Cadet Wintergreen?"\n\nWintergreen stood up and cleared her throat. "Cirrus Pansy wrote that the Proportionality Principle of ethical conduct in war can also be reversed. If military necessity can justify a degree of harm to civilians, then ongoing harm to civilians also justifies a degree of military necessity to end that harm. If a nation's government is causing substantial harm to civilians and non-combatants through some policy or campaign, a military response may be justified. Pansy made clear that this justification only extended to the gravest of offenses against harmony, such as a massive violation of the basic natural rights of an entire population of creatures. Under such circumstances pacifism becomes un-harmonic, and the only acceptable course of action is an ethical, harmonic war to end the abuses."\n\nThe instructor nodded, impressed, and beckoned for Wintergreen to sit. "Yes. You won't hear about that in an Equestrian military college, but it is central to Pansy's thinking as much as any of the other principles are. I do not need to spell it out to you that as an increasingly capable harmonic nation ourselves, and with the state of Zebrica being that which it is, the possibility is not entirely distant that you might find yourself asked to take up arms on that same justification.""

She'd heard great things about her, that she was a mare who had brought a hundred years of progress to her Realm in just three-and-a-half years. She pictured a kirin Twilight Sparkle: a genius intellectual, noticing the most minute details. Inside the grand lobby, Skystar passed by a group of gawking hippogriff tourists as a guide explained the significance of the fifteen-hoof tall portrait of Matriarch Superior Rain Shine to them. The Premier had asked Skystar to meet her over dinner after a production of a newly written play called "The Phantom of the Opera." The Incandescent Legations were as much places of cultural exchange as diplomacy, and musical theatre was very much an integral part of the post-Silence Kirian cultural revival.\n\nAs Skystar sat down at her seat, she was faced by an orange-maned kirin, probably one of the Premier's retainers. The whole time, the Premier didn't appear, and her retainer laughed and joked throughout the play, sharing insider tidbits about the production.\n\nSkystar was relieved. She had enough diplomatic meetings already, and it was nice to let loose and just enjoy a musical with a lighthearted companion before another one. She wondered if this mare was some kind of stage manager, seeing as how she knew so much about the production, or if all kirin had encyclopedic knowledge about Kirian musical theatre. As Skystar burst into tears at the tragic finale, she found her companion smiling. When the applause died down, Skystar turned to her.\n\n"I'm sorry, I never got your name."\n\nHer companion giggled.

Hungry kirin, malcontent and radicalized, pin their anger onto many things - foreigners, the upper class, the Premier - and their rage simmers and smolders until something sets them off.\n\nThe Realm's police and fire departments are beginning to buckle under the strain.

However, a third group has recently split off from the most liberal elements of the Constitution caucus, calling itself the Radical caucus.\n\nThe RaHP Radicals are headed by a group of firebrand delegates in the Secretariat and Plenum who call for expansive personal liberties, free markets, and the elevation of democracy over Kiria's remaining religious institutions. The most radical among them openly call for the abolishment of the state's role in religion altogether, and advocate a Matriarchless republic! Their growing influence in primary elections for the provincial diets and the Mayoralties speaks to an untapped wellspring of liberal-secular energy in the Kirian electorate. Their increasing success in the northern and coastal regions, especially among members of Fickle Current's diaspora has even led to the formation of an alliance between the Radical caucus and the conservative-liberal Snow Clique within the NAKP.

In cities across the country, the government had to scramble to acquire warehouses and office buildings to adminster and deliver the new promises of aid to the urban poor. In the countryside, the farmers were more than happy to oblige the desperate government kirin willing to pay top-tael to buy up grain.\n\nIn the slums, however, as the new government measures kicked in, there was mostly just peace. Cheap bread and rice, sold at a steep loss, flooded the cities and filled hungry bellies. New schools kept children off of the unsafe streets.

"I know that some of us find the Constitution stifling, but its principles are sound and offer stability. Going ahead, there is little sense in maintaining our military assets.

Dr. Ardent Bloom interjected. "Hamstringing our ability to protect our assets to make a show of enthusiastic compliance is a mistake. I am in favour of ceasing proactive expansionism, that much we can trade away, but our mandate is Kirian economic interests. If we hope to fulfil that, we have to ensure that we can protect our interests. There is nothing about recent global events that indicates that corporate pacifism will be the most efficient choice."\n\n"There is no discussion of pacifism here, we are talking about aggression, not security. If a situation has proven untenable enough that proactive military force is needed, then we should be divesting, not deploying. This is not extreme, this is standard operating procedure for companies across the world. Furthermore, the assets we free up will be available for other more peaceful ventures.

The jungle seemed to reach out for them, the cacophony of birds and insects and animals gone to leave only the weak coughing of their engine and - far behind them - the sound of horns.\n\n"Come on, come on, come on," the mechanic coaxed the engine frantically. "Come on sweetie, you can do it, don't die on me now, please!" Her voice broke as she looked out of the engine room towards the back of the ship where two guards hunched behind the boat's armored gunwale. They were both clutching their rifles with shaking hooves, occasionally peeking out from behind it. "Is it still after us!?"\n\n"I don't know, I don't know!" They had been so brave at first. Not now though. Now nokirin was brave. "I think the horns are coming closer though. Can't this thing go faster?!"\n\n"I'm doing the best I can! There's hardly anything of the engine left!"\n\n"Well if you don't-" Whatever he was going to say died in his throat, courtesy of the spear that burst through it, pinning his body down to the deck. The other guard squealed in fear, raising his rifle and firing it towards the tree from which it had come. Crack after crack ripped through the air, only to them be drowned out by the ear-splitting, roaring crash of thunder as the wind picked up from behind the boat. From breeze to gust to gale it rose as a fog poured out among the trees.\n\n"Oh Concord..." Far behind them, where the river vanished into the jungles, two burning eyes appeared in the thick fog, eyes that rapidly approached as the wind rose to a fever pitch. "No, no, no no no!" Their screams were drowned out by another roar as the fog crashed over them.\n\nThe last thing they heard was the thunder, the last thing they saw was the lightning, and two days later the charred husk that once was the boat came drifting out of the jungle."

As you know, the situation in the Far South has turned dire. Our outposts are under attack from local tribes. These are no mere raids either, but full sieges by an aggressor determined to drive us into the sea. In our efforts to bring the NAKP in line with the Kirian Constitution, we have disbanded most of our military assets. Consequently, we are as of now unable to protect these outposts, and I must request that the Kirian Army intervene to protect these outposts and bring the hostilities to an end."\n\n"As much as we sympathise with your plight, these outposts are in foreign land, are they not?" Fern Flare asked. "An intervention like what you are requesting would constitute an invasion of a land that has stated clearly it does not desire your presence. I would understand if you asked for aid in evacuating the region, but aggression of the kind you are proposing would be unprecedented."\n\n"When Kiria came out of the Silence, it was forced to advance quickly, and there is not one kirin present who cannot testify to how hard this time was." Cypress Snow looked out across the chamber. "Yet we persevered, and we stand as a great modernising power in Zebrica. For these tribes who have lived trapped in the past for centuries, who should give them the tools of modernity if not us? We know the challenges that it offers better than anykirin else, and what greater purpose can Kiria have than to take on this burden of elevating these tribes abandoned by time and craving our instruction? Should we instead abandon them to be dragged back into barbarism by their mistrustful kin? Or should we let the world know that Kiria is a tutor that does not abandon its students?""

The SSVC was in financial ruin, and the NAKP was left with a mountain of debts after this entire fiasco. The politician in her knew that at least this would at least weaken them politically, and the next time they started going on about these kinds of ventures, kirin would remember the slaughter in the south. A decent enough political gain... for how many lives?\n\nShe wondered what it all had been to the natives, what the kirin arriving on their shores had seemed like. Had they seemed like foreign demons who brought pain and death to their homeland, who trampled their sacred places and sought to subjugate them? Like the griffons a century ago, so had the kirin trespassed on their homeland, and so the natives had beaten them back. And what of that supposed guardian of the sacred city? Had there been any truth to it, or was it just an excuse for supposed 'civilised' creatures to explain away the fury with which those they deemed 'lesser' protected their homeland?\n\nShe didn't know, all she knew that this entire affair had been humiliating and disgraceful in equal measure, and that she would resign before she let Kiria embark on another venture like this."

Time is of the essence, and Autumn Blaze looked down at the two dossiers given to her. Two different plans had been put forth, the question was what should be done.\n\nGeneral Hyssop Garnet had proposed a full scale intervention. Battle lines were fluid in the jungle, and the tribes knew the latter inside out. In response, General Garnet suggested that Kiria leveraged its full force to shock the tribes into surrendering. Heavy artillery, mechanised assets and air power would all be deployed to ensure that the tribals would be faced with an overwhelming force, far beyond what they could hope to defeat. Faced with full understanding of the dragon they had awoken, the tribes would realize that their only option was surrendering. This would make the war bloody, but short.\n\nIn contrast, General Coral River argued for a more limited intervention where the goal was not to cow the tribes into submission, but to tire them out and reach accord with their local leaders. Having studied the zebra tribes of the Far South, General River posited that each tribe should be understood as a nation unto itself, and therefore the goal had to be to placate or pacify them one after one to dissolve their coalition. It would be a drawn out intervention, one that would place restrictions on our armed forces, but General River was confident it would be best way to avoid a bloodbath.\n\nAutumn Blaze stared down at the dossiers, wondering how it had gone so horribly wrong that this was Kiria's first great foreign venture. it sickened her, but she had no choice... or rather she did have a choice, one she had to make here and now, and that was what made her so queasy."

"I want to give my honoured colleagues who supported this effort in Talarayi my compliments, for we have been the foreign monsters against which they united under one common purpose." The Morning Secretariat was boiling with anger, and calls rang out for the delegates to quiet down. Autumn Blaze, meanwhile, sat in her seat staring out into the air in front of her. The enormity of what she and the rest of the chamber had caused loomed over her, and she felt sick.\n\nTens of thousands dead, military defeat and humiliation, devastation and destruction all throughout [DEL.GetName], all for what? To try to "solve" Talarayi somehow? Defeat the zebras who for all they knew were just defending their homes from foreign encroachment? And in all this stood Kiria, a foreign invader and would-be conqueror, a sleeping giant freshly awakened which had bumbled itself into a humiliating and dishonorable catastrophe. For a brief moment, she felt like she understood why the Silence had once been viewed as necessary."

The NAKP claimed they wanted prosperity and to 'give them the tools of modernity', but they are nothing a poisoned thorn of greed in the heart of Kiria. Our nation has lost its way, and it'll rot from the inside as it lets itself be marched into bloodbaths at the behest of economic interests.\n\nI was taken to the Golden City, I saw the Tiger and heard it speak to the priests. If you would see them here, learn from them, you would realize how distant 'harmony' is to Kiria right now. We've all lost our way. I will find it again, and I will do so among these zebras.\n\nDamn the NAKP for their rampant greed and damn you for letting this happen.\n\nCoral River"

kirin.332.d:0 "Autumn Blaze walked down the hallway towards the Morning Secretariat in silence, thinking about the vote yesterday. The needle that had been barely tipped in favour of the KIRFORS mandate had long since had tipped back in the other direction. This entire conflict had dragged for over a year at this point, and its justifications had been flimsy to start with. And now, after a year of pain and death and destruction across Talarayi with nothing to really show for it, what little faith most of the Morning Secretariat had had in the intervention had completely dissipated.\n\nThe Secretariat had voted to revoke the KIRFORS mandate, end the fighting, and withdraw from the Far South, and the entire government was currently going through a furious chain reaction of assigning blame. Fern Flare had assured her that impeachment was not in the cards, which honestly, was a small consolation. Kiria Awoken was blaming the RaHP and CST, who blamed the NAKP who was castigating the Morning Secretariat for lacking the will to see this conflict through.\n\nShe took a deep breath as she stepped into the Verdigris Rotunda, determined to make the best of the situation. There always was a way to make things a little better at least. Their retreat would have to happen in good order, and they'd evacuate as many of their zebras allies as possible. Hopefully, maybe, in due time things would settle down and maybe they could... she was interrupted by a wild-eyed messenger coming into the Morning Secretariat at a full sprint, panting as she stopped before Autumn Blaze."

We finally got a response back..." she showed Autumn Blaze the brief telegram that had come from KIRFORS.\n\n    'To Tartarus with all of you. I did not bury thousands of kirin here to have weak-kneed politicians and spineless bureaucrats abandon all we fought for. If you don't have the strength to finish this, I will if I so have to kill every last savage myself.'\n\nAutumn Blaze had to sit down, covering her face in despair, and the day would only get worse as more reports began to tumble in. KIRFORS had gone rogue, seizing full control of the area and planning to continue the war by any means necessary. Now unburdened by the rules of engagement and renamed into the Far South Purification Army, they were embarking on a campaign of genocide against the Talarayian zebras."

Addressing him from the other side of the desk sat General Firethorn, Generalissimo of the Vermilion and Kirian Army, flanked by Special Operations Colonel Fall Leaves. To the side sat a quiet, bespectacled mare in civilian clothing. "This your best soldier?" Firethorn continued, and Fall Leaves nodded.\n\n"Yes ma'am," Wolfsbane responded. "I was part of the Long Range Company. We tracked down and eliminated enemy chieftains." The smell of fire and death came back to him, as did the angry scream of a zebra pushing through a hail of bullets towards him, desperate to defend his homeland. "I'm an assassin," he clarified after a second. Firethorn nodded slowly.\n\n"Then this will be right up your alley," she said, pushing a dossier over to him. Wolfsbane picked it up to study it. "Former General Hyssop Garnet, self-styled warlord of the Far South Purification Army." Wolfsbane wasn't surprised. "He's slaughtering his way through the southeast, and needs to be eliminated - with extreme prejudice."\n\n"This just keeps getting worse for Vermilion, doesn't it?" Wolfsbane asked quietly.

kirin.334.d:0 "After the cataclysmic destruction of the Golden City, KIRFORS and our efforts in the Far South has come under intense scrutiny. What was meant to be an intervention to protect our local partners had completely spiralled out of control. Questions are being asked by politicians, journalists and the bereaved family members who have lost their beloved ones in a poorly defined conflict that has caused countless deaths.\n\nThough there were initially some attempts to control the narrative, the entire situation exploded when an anonymous dossier, simply entitled 'First Light', arrived at Kiria's largest newspapers. The dossier contained photographs, copies of letters and internal documentation from KIRFORS. It described how the "Safe Zones" set up for the protection of the local tribes were little more than fetid prison camps where disease and malnourishment is rampant, with their captive inhabitants often used as slave labour. Local authority figures and religious leaders were rounded up and locked away, many times under appalling conditions to expire on their own. Religious sites and villages were carelessly demolished if they were deemed in the way, and SSVC agents have orchestrated land grabs across the region. Furthermore, the dossier revealed that numerous NAKP politicians and businesskirin affiliated with the SSVC had applied pressure on KIRFORS Supreme Commander, General Hyssop Garnet, to cover up these grave atrocities when reported to him by KIRFORS personnel and civilian witnesses.\n\nAlongside a now-iconic photograph of an emaciated zebra foal cradled in her mother's forelegs, the text on the last page of the dossier now adorn the front pages of newspapers and broadsheets across the Realm:\n"THIS is Kiria's great step into the wider world: by force of arms and to take by force whatever it wishes.\nTHIS is the "guidance" Kiria offer its neighbors: by clasping them in fetters and devastating their way of life.\nTHIS is how Kiria creates the future: by creating a wasteland and calling it harmony."\n\nAt a hastily-convened press conference, Premier Autumn Blaze, who sported dark bags under her eyes, vowed to order an independent investigation to prosecute all those involved. Across the Realm and in Fragrance in particular, the MWPK and trade unions have mobilised in massive protests against their provincial and mayoral NAKP delegates, including those in the Fragrance NAKP's powerful party machine who were implicated by the dossier. With many Fragrancese declaring that will boycott the NAKP, the popularity of the Fragrance NAKP has taken a sharp nosedive from which it may never recover."

Hyssop Garnet's plan of shock and awe had proven ineffective, and the entire campaign devolved into a drawn out war of attrition and mass murder, where the solution to the mobile tribes' jungle warfare was to burn down the jungles and herd the natives into "Safe Zones". Even worse, as KIRFORS had advanced, the SSVC had been right behind, claiming the land for 'further development' in tight coordination with the military.\n\nTheir plan was clear in its purpose; break the natives and use them as a cheap labour force for resource extraction on their ancestral land, now property of the SSVC. This was no defensive war, this was a war of conquest and enslavement, and she was culpable in it. She would have been angry, enraged even, but all she could feel was overwhelming shame. She had done this. She had let these events take place...\n\n"Recall Hyssop Garnet at once. Relieve him of his command and suspend him from active duty, pending further disciplinary action." She looked up to the ministers that sat around the table with her. "Get KIRFORS under control, and start pulling it back. Deploy regular forces if we have to.

Put together a plan for how we'll get these zebras out of those damn camps and restore as much of their lives as we can."\n\n"What will we do about Talarayi?", somekirin asked.

kirin.340.d:0 ""Nocreature starts a war — or rather, nocreature in their senses ought to do so — without first being clear in their mind what they intend to achieve by that war and how they intend to conduct it." Coral River quoted the maxim they all would have heard as he looked around at the gathered officers. "The question that follows this is what we are trying to achieve here. I posit that our mission is fundamentally defensive in nature. We are here to defend our trading outposts and our local partners, not conquer territory. In order to achieve this, we must adapt our rules of engagement to better meet the realities on the ground."\n\n"Firstly, we must recognize that this region is not and has never been united. The priests have some influence, but each tribe will still see to its own welfare first. Those tribes who have not explicitly acted hostile towards us must continue to reap the benefits of our presence. Even in cases of hostility, we must not withdraw the opportunity for trade from them. Trading areas will continue to remain open to all for this reason."\n\n"Secondly, we must abandon any idea of holding terrain here. We protect the towns and trading outposts, we keep the roads open, and we ensure that we patrol the countryside to keep as much of the fighting away from said towns as possible. The way to achieve this is local cooperation and measured responses. If the locals catch even a whiff of overlordship from us, they will buck violently. We are and we remain foreign traders arguing with some of the tribes, some, not all."\n\n"Thirdly, any priests or religious sites are off limits. The priesthood is not a monolith, and seeing their holy figures and mediators roughed up by foreigners will only cause way more dissent. Ensuring that local religious customs can continue to be observed and including local priests in our peacekeeping efforts will communicate to the religious leadership that we are not here to replace or remove them.""

kirin.341.t:0 "The Far South Morass"
kirin.341.d:0 "The implementation of General Coral River's new and radical doctrine of de-escalation has been a troubled affair, to say the least. There has already been objections from several officers, some of which have asked to be transferred away from Talarayi instead of "sitting on their flanks and waiting for the enemy to surround them". General Coral River has denied these requests, and instead offered to transfer them to what can charitably be called the front lines.\n\nFurthermore, several areas of front lines have been demilitarised owing to these areas' supposed religious significance. This has produced salients which are spreading our forces thin. The movement of enemy warbands through these zones have caused even further objections among the officers, and questions are starting to be asked back in Vermilion as to what exactly the general is attempting to achieve. While there have been no attacks from these salients yet, the officers' corps insists it is only a matter of time.\n\nYet, though the military leadership has been dissatisfied with the doctrine, the local tribes are all too happy to continue trading in the safe areas. Though the trading in weapons has been suspended, other goods continue to sell much like before. As Coral River predicted, many of these goods - stamped with a mark derived from the locals' traditions for ease of tracking - appear to have been taken deeper into the jungle."

kirin.342.t:0 "Jungle Dreams"
kirin.342.d:0 "Coral River blinked as she looked up at the ceiling from her bed. It was gone, replaced with fog, and so was all other things around her. The world had faded away, and all was cold, wet fog. She shuddered as she rose up, slowly turning in a circle to try to see if she could see anything else.\n\n"You use the old writing," the voice whispered in her ear, and when she looked around she came face to face with a zebra. He stood towering above her, bedecked in gold and feathers, and in the air behind him two glowing eyes hovered. "Even as warriors die, you mark your goods with calls for peace. Clever. Did you think you would be able to use them to lure us forth?"\n\n"My only desire is an end to this fighting, holy one," Coral River told the figure. "Please, help me understand why this is happening. Your people attacked us seemingly out of nowhere. I know there is a reason, but I cannot see it. What did we do to deserve this?"\n\n"You earned as much," the priest reached out and touched her horn. Coral River's mind was flooded with images of sacred groves and burial sites destroyed, of merchants who promised wealth and tricked the tribes into surrender their lands and homes, of an expedition to find the golden city even though they had been warned and which had reached it only because the priests allowed it, and of the last chance given being rewarded with pillaging. Believing the Golden City empty, the expedition had begun stripping it of whatever loose artefacts they could find. As before, the foreigners showed themselves as nothing but thieves. As before, the guardians of the most sacred destroyed them. When the torrent of images stopped, Coral River sat up straight in bed, soaked in sweat and hyperventilating."
kirin.342.a:0 "So that was what happened..."

kirin.343.t:0 "A Gamble"
kirin.343.d:0 "Finally, Coral River knew what the natives' goals were. Firstly, they were out seeking retribution. That damn SSVC expedition had had the same effect as someone walking into the Temple of the Rising Fire and relieving themselves into the flames. Something sacred was violated, and they had to respond to it violently. Secondly, the priesthood was well aware that the Kirian presence in Talarayi was a challenge to the old order. Thus, destroying the Kirians was a matter of all that was good and right to the average zebra, and a matter of protecting their very existence to the priesthood. So how do you beat that? Well, her mandate was to ensure an end to hostilities, nothing else, and so then she might as well let the natives 'win'.\n\nSitting atop the central building of the now abandoned forward operating base, she took a drink from her canteen of water as she idly wondered if she had gotten jungle fever. It was an insane idea in so many ways, and she knew that even if this worked, she'd be court martialled at best. Yet, if that was what it took to achieve her mission, she would do it. With how Kiria had been flailing around like idiots from day one down here, she figured a leap of faith was as good as anything.\n\nMovement over by the gates drew her attention and she tensed up. The jungle around them was deathly silent, and she swallowed as the water in her stomach suddenly felt heavy. This was it, make or break. She took a slow breath, watching as she saw them finally appear. The defenders of their homes, the ones who had pledged themselves to fight against the outsiders who would despoil all they were, the ones who heeded the call when the guardians of the sacred city called. Her gaze met that of one of them, a young zebra barely old enough to have finished school if she had been kirin.\n\n"I am unarmed," she told the warriors, "and I will not fight. Your priests know me, and they will want to speak with me." It was all really stupid, but in a mad world, mad strategies might just be what was needed."

Simply put: I let myself be captured in order to reach the priesthood of Talarayi. I have been successful and managed to arrive at a tentative peace agreement.\n\nWe have all been misled about what happened before the war. In truth, the expedition that the South Sea Company sent up bumbled their way into the most sacred place in Talarayi and began looting it. Their aggression was in response to this sacrilege. I have spoken at length with them, and offered them what recompense we can offer. Economic compensation will not be enough to quell the religious wrath the expedition unleashed. They have asked that you come to them, and that you bring with you fire from the eternal flame of the Matriarchal Palace. I cannot say for what purpose, but after they were told of it, they were insistent that they get it.\n\nIt is a strange request, but with our forces retreating to the trade ports and with the previously mentioned gifts, they will have avenged the desecration of the city and won the war in their people's eyes. We started in the wrong end, as we let economics lead the way when religious understanding should have. If we can give them this way out, peace may yet come to this land again. I implore you to listen to me."\n\n- General Coral River\n\nAutumn Blaze sat heavily back in her chair, staring up at the ceiling. Coral River was actually insane.

Having quickly gotten on a ship and travelled to Talarayi with a minor fleet escorting her, she had almost been physically tossed back onto the ship by her security detail when a large group of natives had all but appeared right at the outskirts of the trading port where she had arrived. Yet in the end she had managed to talk them down. If one planned a surprise attack, one would not stand still a hundred meters from the gates with a large procession of priests. As she stood here and stared the zebras down though, she felt very small. The priests and warriors all stared directly at her, their glares cold and hostile. How many of them had lost loved ones at the hooves of her people? Kiria's first step out into the wider world, and it had turned into this kind of bloodbath...\n\n"I am Autumn Blaze, Premier of Kiria," she greeted them, nodding her head in a small bow. "I am sorry that we meet under these circumstances, and I bring gifts as a show of my people's commitment to finding a resolution to this conflict." She motioned for her guards to bring up the brazier towards the zebras. The priest at the front of the procession, a tall zebra with a feathered crown and piercing eyes, walked up to the brazier, holding up one hoof to the fire.\n\n"I am [DEL.GetLeader], and I speak for all those who walk with the Tiger. Out of all of your kind, only Coral River has proven worth listening to. She said you would prove yourself worthy of our ears. You did." Raising one hoof, he threw something into the fire and made it flare up. A pillar of smoke rose from it, and twisted in the air. Two burning eyes opened in the middle of the pillar, followed by a large maw as a giant tiger's head now towered above them. Autumn Blaze took a step back in shock, her guards almost raising their weapons, but the priest simply walked around the fire and rolled out a large carpet which he sat down on. "Be seated, and let us speak on how this war shall be ended. The Tiger will hear you." Taking a deep breath, Autumn Blaze walked up to sit down in front of him."

The Talarayian natives had checked the encroachment of the SSVC, and avenged the desecration of their sacred city. Kiria had managed to ensure that its holdings in the region did not fall, and that their partner tribes did not become victims to the revanchist tribes. The NAKP - meanwhile - was quietly dissolving the SSVC, transferring its assets to the newly created Talarayian Development and Trade Foundation, which would be tasked by the government to resume trade in the region.\n\nThough many voices had been critical towards Kiria "rolling over in the face of unwarranted aggression", a concerted public relations campaign was being carried out. Thankfully, Coral River had been only too happy to provide the newspapers with notes on her experiences, and the newspapers were happy to run full page articles on it. The entire affair was quickly being re-framed along the lines of what her RaHP and its coalition partners had branded it - a regrettable conflict stemming from ignorance and miscommunication, and which would best be followed by a period of healing. From war would rise mutual understanding and prosperity, and Kiria would learn and grow wiser from it.\n\nIt still creeped her out to approach all this in the terms of politics, but what other option did she have?

kirin.400.t:0 "Blossom Far" ## Split into a two parter. Show, don't tell. Ping me if you need some kirin character names. Fires for both owner of 1058 and Kiria.
kirin.400.d:0 "Torrid Squall had heard the news, the reported good tidings from the Vermilion Throne. Chattering priestesses by the wayside proclaimed the triumph of a resurgent, resplendent Kiria. It wouldn't be long until the Realm asked for what they believed was rightfully theirs.\n\nThe news had stirred something fierce throughout Blossom, had shoved Torrid and the rest out of their comfort zones and into the streets to figure out a future of their own. The king in Lotus was proving unable to retain his obsidian grip over the former city-state, a cherished Kirian tributary: the rule of a mortal king indeed paled against that of the avatar of the Divine, of Concord.\n\nHer followers thronged the streets and squares of the city. Less jostling, more walking in lockstep: emblems, slogans, and Kirian flags decorate the air, while suits and robes distinguish the pro-Kiria parties from... the not-so-pro-Kiria ones who answered with solidarity with the other city-states, of sticking together under Lotus and its high king.\n\nA rumbling crowd of kirin, with Torrid in the middle of it, were converging onto the city's palace of government. Sweeping through the crowd like wildfire was news of the latest development: Vermilion's delegates had already arrived and were talking with the city's Mayoral Prefect. Rumours spread of an incoming trilateral discussion where Kiria, Sen Kinh, and Blossom would come together as equals.\n\nFor the fate of Blossom."
kirin.400.a:0 "Paused for a century, a new Blossom is envisioned."
kirin.400.b:0 "A fair contest of powers, then."

kirin.401.t:0 "Blossom Wide" ## Part two
kirin.401.d:0 "An old tale relayed the fall of an ancient fortress, not by blade nor bow but by the hoofsteps of thousands of kirin walking around it for weeks on end - a circumambulatory siege.\n\nThe parallel wasn't lost on Torrid. His group, swelled now by thousands, had been rallying around the palace for days, hoping to get a look at the various delegates coming in one by one, hoping to catch some concrete information. Then, Blossom's own authorities, including its Mayoral Prefect, left the grand residence first; behind them, the Kirians and the Senkinese delegations cantered abreast. A vast array of uniforms economical and religious on one hoof, a singular troupe of matching clothes and weapons on the other.\n\nThis unity clashed with the escalation outside palace grounds. Serene had the palace stood against a rising tide of marches and demonstrations that often met and merged into each other non-violently. Other places did not fare so well: more than a few stores and teahouses burned in the flames of a heated argument gone ablaze; the authorities intervened before a potential inferno was unleashed.\n\nThe Kirian forces were not entirely peaceful: groups of young kirin in modern attire decried "Senkinese decadence," calling for a triumphant return to the Kirian motherland in boisterous street corner rallies that sometimes escalated into the rare street fight.\n\nIgnoring the noise, Torrid waited. He'd moved closer now, several metres from the gates. The headdress of [1058.Owner.GetName], the ruler from [1058.Owner.GetCapitalName], could be seen swaying above the mass of the crowd's kirin horns."
kirin.401.a:0 "The last actor before the curtains open."
kirin.401.b:0 "[1058.Owner.GetName] will see things through."

kirin.402.t:0 "A Kirian Offer for a Blossomese Referendum"
kirin.402.d:0 "In the midst of the politicking in reaction to Vermilion's recent overtures, we have received a request from the Realm's Matriarch Superior, chief of their religion and their northern ways: to hold a referendum in Blossom on whether its inhabitants will be better suited as a part of the Realm.\n\nThe terms involve the Blossomese being given special privileges as a city-state, which will only make a return to Kiria more attractive to the Way of Fire-sympathetic city.\n\nUnderstandably, just hoofing away our second-largest city is disastrous as it is an extraordinarily valuable trading hub. Still, in the long run, the instability of the Blossomese and their mixed culture will no longer bother us, and will spare us the means to further consolidate the city-states that remain in our employ.\n\nAll things considered, it is not guaranteed that Blossom will be given away should we allow a referendum since it is based on a vote. Many Blossomese may agitate for a return based on principle, but the more level-minded among them may not want to join themselves with a paper tiger. There has to be a catch to the Realm's breakneck modernisation."
kirin.402.a:0 "The Blossomese shall speak for themselves."

Standing side by side the stoic faces of Kirian and Senkinese delegates, with [1058.Owner.GetName] himself in full view, he grabbed the microphone in front of him.\n\nTorrid sat amid the hushed crowd gathered at the perimeter, undulating in a kirin wave. From this close to their faces, he saw a victorious smirk on [1058.Owner.GetName]'s face: the clue that gave the game away.\n\n"It is clear from the mood here what the city desires," the Prefect began. "We congratulate Kiria for the miraculous progress it has made in recovering from the Silence. Its reward is becoming a resurgent power, and that must be celebrated! However, it is also clear that it will not be in the best interests of us Blossomese to join their Realm at this current hour. The Kirians have seen the data for themselves, both in the numbers and in the faces that abound here. We do not need a referendum, for it is clear that Blossom desires not to rejoin with Kiria."\n\nA round of tepid whoops and stomping cut his speech short. Several arguments burst open among the assembled audience; uniformed police took away any angry agitators.\n\nAt least for now, Torrid would stay here. A sigh of relief at being undisturbed left his muzzle."
kirin.403.a:0 "...deferred."

kirin.404.t:0 "Watershed"
kirin.404.d:0 "When the Mayoral Prefect announced the upcoming referendum, Torrid couldn't have readied himself for the torrent of activity coming at him from all corners. The trade city reached a fever pitch: bets and votes, made and swapped, on the final result of said referendum. Ships bearing foreign emblems sent ashore pastel-coloured Equestrians, besuited griffons, and a few seafaring hippogriffs: observers of one of Kiria's first moves as a great power.\n\nThe attention had supercharged every rally into district-wide mass meetings. Every other conversation zeroed in on whether to move or to stay; prices of everything (from fruits to stocks) zig-zagged with each speculation on the city's future status; flags were drafted prematurely, made to mimic the triangular and flourishing style of the Realm's banners.\n\nThe assault on Torrid's senses forced him into a teahouse to cool down. Over soothing aromas and to the taste of healing waters, he could envision the excitement sweeping over all... and his hoof could partake in it, help construct that watershed moment for Blossom and maybe the world.\n\nFor these few weeks or so, amid whatever conflicts that were embroiling the world, all eyes would look here: the Realm's first dealing with the kirin of another nation..."

[1058.Owner.GetLeader] later commented that, other than being of benefit to Sen Kinh, the referendum's results ensured the Blossomese that their future "would not be overshadowed by the resounding success of others.""

kirin.99.t:0 "The Conclusion of the 3½ Year Plan"
kirin.99.d:0 "When the news reached Massicot that Premier Autumn Blaze was scheduled to give a speech on the radio that evening, word quickly spread to the small community of farmers on the city's borders that the Imperial Premier called her home. But the farmers were poor, even if the modernisation of the Grand Gallop Onward had already begun improving their lives, and many, her parents especially, feared that they would not be able to hear it. But thanks to a friend of a friend of a friend, Autumn's parents managed to find a radio, and the entire community gathered around the staticky device as it strained to pick up Autumn's voice from Vermilion, many kilometers away.\n\n"Citizens of Kiria!" Autumn proclaimed over the radio as soon as the broadcast began. "Today is a great day. A monumentous day! The Three and a Half Year Plan, the first phase of the Grand Gallop Onward, has been a resounding success! When I first began working with her Divinity, Matriarch Superior Rain Shine, as her Imperial Premier, I was admittedly intimidated by the sheer scale of the undertaking before us as a nation. But our success should not have been surprising. It took a group effort to make this work: Matriarch Rain Shine, who believed in the Grand Gallop Onward; the All-Kiria Plenum for National Revival, which put aside their differences to come together and create a new, modern future for the Realm; our friends overseas, who lent us money and their expertise to catch up on a century of missed innovations; and most importantly, you, the average kirin, the backbone and soul of our nation, who responded to our rallying cries of modernisation and helped in any and every little way you could. We could not be here tonight without you, and Concord, I am sure, is smiling upon her favored species. What we have accomplished would make her proud, and her favor will bless Kiria for generations!\n\n"Today is a day to rejoice, kirin of the Realm! Be together with your friends and family. Invite your neighbors over to drink and feast. Celebrate! And don't worry about getting a little carried away with your celebrations, as the Matriarch has declared that tomorrow shall be a national holiday in celebration! So to you, kirin of Kiria: good night, and may Concord bless you!"\n\nMusic signaled the end of the broadcast, but the farmers of Massicot had only just begun to cheer and stomp their hooves. In the center of it all, Autumn's mother cried tears of joy and pride, held close against her husband's chest.\n\nIt would be a lively night in Massicot, and all throughout the Realm as a whole."
kirin.99.a:0 "We did it! We did it! Concord bless us all!"

kirin.100.t:0 "The Center Cannot Hold"
kirin.100.d:0 ""Is it good news? Please tell me it's good news." Autumn Blaze looked across her desk at Cinder Glow and Fern Flare, two of her closest friends from Massicot turned her trusted political advisors for her job as premier. She trusted them to give her the news straight, and the looks on their faces told her that she wasn't going to like what they had to say.\n\n"The Realm is growing more unstable by the day," Fern Flare said. "Farmers are protesting against the rapid changes to society. Laborers are protesting that they aren't being treated fairly. The returning diaspora is protesting that we aren't modernizing fast enough for their liking. When those protests clash, riots start. And I think it goes without saying that where kirin are rioting, nirik soon appear. Urbanization and industrial projects are getting damaged by angry nirik setting fire to the construction zones, wasting investment money that we really need. Not to mention our bouts with famine, pollution, and pirates..."\n\n"I think she gets the point," Cinder Glow said, putting a hoof on Fern Flare's shoulder and shaking her head. Then she turned to Autumn. "In short, the realm is in turmoil. We have to do something to get cooler heads to prevail and get everykirin back on the same page. We need to remind them that we're all in this together, for the good of our country."\n\n"Yeah," Autumn said, rubbing her hoof against her nose scales as she thought. "But what could... oh, silly me, of course! The Matriarch!" She practically hopped out of her chair as a moment of brilliant inspiration struck her. "What's one thing we all share in common as kirin of the Realm? Our love for our Matriarch! The Realm wouldn't exist without her, and we owe her respect, not just because of the job she's doing, but because she's Concord's avatar in this world. I may have flunked out of mystic school, but even I know that Concord made Rain Shine one with her divinity when she ascended. So why don't we send her on tour across the Realm to visit the big cities and the little villages, and remind the kirin of Kiria that so long as Rain Shine trots among us, we still have Concord's favor!"\n\n"Do you really think it will work?" Fern Flare asked. "For all her divinity and power, Matriarch Rain Shine can't simply wave her hoof and make the Realm's problems go away."\n\n"No, but it will buy us the time we need," Autumn said. "Time enough to solve those problems in the Reform Bureau. We're in a race against time, and we need every minute we can get out of this powder keg before it explodes.""

kirin.101.d_1:0 "The first sign of bad news was the piece of paper nailed to the door of the Morning Secretariat proclaiming that Concord has abandoned the Vermilion Realm. Below it, the signatures of two dozen reputable priests and mystics put a foreboding weight to the proclamation.\n\nThe second was the imperial courier that collapsed on the steps to the Vermilion palace, beaten and bloody. In her satchel were reports of violence between the returning diaspora, who saw themselves as superior to the local commoners, and the farmers and fisherkirin of the realm, who saw the returning émigrés as foreign colonizers trying to crush their way of life. The courier had to flee Fragrance as riots started, and had been accosted by both sides for merely trying to do her job. It was a wonder she made it back alive.\n\nAfter that, bad news flowed like a monsoon, drowning the Morning Secretariat in dismay and grinding the Plenum to a halt. Rain Shine could only listen hopelessly as her premier read out the latest chaos happening across the Realm. Cultural upheaval was everywhere and clashes between tradition and modernization were commonplace. The northern coast, particularly the cities of Fragrance and Rhapsody, had practically turned into warzones between locals and the diaspora, with reports that nationalist paramilitaries had organized and orchestrated coups against the Matriarch's appointed governors, installing their leaders in their steads. But despite the chaos in the east, the populace there still paid lip service to Rain Shine as her subjects, unlike the west. There, in the rural and underdeveloped stretches of Kiria, the heretical sect of The Rising Fire had engaged in open rebellion against Rain Shine's rule. Clashes between Imperial Banners and local militias had put a dark mood over the Secretariat, and the situation only seemed to be growing more dire. And throughout it all, reports of nirik transformations and raging fires had come in from all across the nation. Kiria was dying.\n\nRain Shine excused herself from the Secretariat, having heard enough bad news for the day, and wandered the halls of her grand palace alone. She had done this to Kiria; she was the one responsible for this failure. She had tried to cram a century's worth of lost progress into three years of reform, and it had blown up in her face. She had created a dilemma worse than the one her mother faced, and now she finally understood why The Silence had been enacted at all. The kirin were simply not ready for the modern world.\n\nBut there was nothing she could do now. She had staked her authority on the success of the Plenum, and it had failed. Her decrees begging for the violence to end would fall on deaf ears. She had dug this grave for Kiria, and now it looked like she was about to lie in it with her Realm."

That spark was Rising Sun as she took the podium before her peers. "The east may have forgotten who they are, but the west stands firm," she proclaimed. "The Rising Fire supports our Matriarch, and so long as I have a seat on this Secretariat, we will support Kiria. But time is of the essence if we want to do this right. The Realm is fracturing, and nirik transformations are becoming more commonplace. If we don't right the ship now, even I won't be able to satisfy the demands for reform coming from the west. Kiria will be broken within a month if we don't do something to fix it, so we must. For the good of the realm."\n\nRain Shine silently nodded along as Rising Sun's words stirred up one last bit of resolve in the Secretariat. There was still a chance to save Kiria. They couldn't afford to waste it."

kirin.102.t:0 "The Matriarch on Tour"
kirin.102.d_1:0 "It was good to be home, Rain Shine thought to herself as her servants set her palanquin down in the courtyard inside her palace. She had just returned from a successful tour of the Realm, the first she'd undertaken in her long life of seventy-some odd years, and had seen a whole new Realm she couldn't have imagined after spending almost all of those years inside the Vermilion palace. When her premier had brought the idea of a country tour to her she had at first been skeptical, but soon warmed to the idea. Now, she was glad that she had done it; the memories of what she'd seen would stick with her for the rest of her days, and they were happy memories as well.\n\nFrom Vermilion, Rain Shine had insisted on making the trek through the mountains to Rhapsody, along the path where the Vermilion Priestess and eventual first Matriarch Superior, Iridescent Dawn, had once trotted on her journey to commune with Concord. From there, she traveled to Fragrance and up the Comely Cape until she boarded a steamer that took her to Hyacinth, allowing her to appreciate the marvels of modern artificing that Kiria had missed in its century-long stagnation. From Hyacinth she went to Massicot, then sailed down the Great Mellifluve to Sorghum and Verdant, with a detour to Chrysanthemum along the way. At every stop, she had been greeted by throngs of awed and overjoyed kirin, their emotion and faith in their Matriarch Superior overcoming the divides of status. Rich and poor, mystic and heretic, local or diaspora returnee, all gathered by along the roads, cheering their divine Matriarch and bowing before her.\n\nIt had been an overwhelming experience for the Matriarch, sure, but it had been worth it. Rain Shine had visited all the new advances happening under her watch, from new schools to modern hospitals to revitalized fire pagodas proclaiming a new dawn for The Way of Fire. She had seen firsthoof the rapid progress of modernization, the advancement of industry, and the transformation of the poor kirin countryside into a land of rich opportunities. But she had also seen cracks in the facade, where the dark tendrils of strife wound its way between the growing cracks of kirin society and politics. For as far as the Realm had come under her watch, it still had much farther to go, and injustices beyond measure to rectify.\n\nBut rectify them she would, she knew. With the tour complete, she had seen what she needed to see in her Realm. She had seen the wheels of progress turning, and the conflict that strove to grind them to a halt. And, Concord willing, she would do everything in her power to drive them onwards. Her little kirin depended on it, after all, and Rain Shine was determined to never fail her subjects in the way her mother had once failed them."
kirin.102.d_2:0 "Rain Shine waved from her palanquin at the gathered crowds in the city of Persimmon, full of kirin who had gathered along the streets just to catch a glimpse of their divine Matriarch Superior make her first journey outside of the Vermilion palace in all her life. At her premier's urging, Rain Shine and her palace staff had established an itinerary of cities to visit throughout the Realm to show the kirin of Kiria that their Matriarch still held the divine favor of Concord and looked admirably upon the work they were doing in the Grand Gallop Onward. So far, she had visited the cities of Rhapsody, Fragrance, Hyacinth, Massicot, and Sorghum, with stops at Verdant and Chrysanthemum yet to come. In a month, she would be back home in Vermilion, having seen more of her realm over the past several weeks than she had in her entire life.\n\nShe caught a commotion in the crowd out of the corner of her eye, and turned just in time to see a kirin mare shove her way to the front of the crowd and her horn light up. Before anykirin could react, she pulled a revolver from the inside of her coat and fired all six shots directly at the palanquin. Rain Shine felt something slice across her shoulder and some invisible force kick her in the back as the palanquin toppled over, her servants carrying it dropping it in shock and fear, their Matriarch falling into the dirt as screams of terror rang out throughout the crowd. Groaning, Rain Shine lifted herself up from the dirt, looking to her left just in time to see the would-be assassin end up skewered on the spear of one of her guards.\n\n"Matriarch! Concord's flames, you're hurt!" Her servants and guards swarmed around her, quickly righting the palanquin and all but dumping her into it as her procession beat a hasty retreat from the town. The awed worshippers that had lined the streets were gone, and Persimmon found itself suffocating in eerie stillness, save for the distant wails that somekirin had killed the Matriarch. One of Rain Shine's servants tore up their own robes to bandage the Matriarch, and Rain Shine realized she'd been shot. One shot had barely grazed by her shoulder, missing her head only for the angle she had held her neck at when the assassin fired, and another had smashed into the armor on her back, breaking loose two of the scales and leaving bloody sores in their place. The injuries hurt, but the symbolism was far more painful to her. She was supposed to embody Concord's divinity in the mortal realm. And some kirin had tried to kill her. While scales would grow back and cuts would heal, she had been attacked, assaulted, and wounded. Those injuries would never go away; they had shattered her reputation and legitimacy as Concord's divine avatar on earth.\n\nForlorn, Rain Shine ordered the procession to take her back to Vermilion. It was too dangerous to continue with the tour. Who knew how many other assassins were lying in wait in the west, ready to strike down the Matriarch if given the chance?"

kirin.103.d:0 "Rising Sun trotted the streets of Chrysanthemum, her birthplace and home. Fires still raged around her, the pink and blue flames of nirik fire still consuming the wooden buildings lining the street. Flakes of ash and hot cinders rained down around her, sizzling along her coat and leaving tiny scorch marks on her crimson robes. Chaos reigned, but she was serene.\n\nThe Rising Fire had made its move that morning. All throughout the west, organized militias of peasants, farmers, and oppressed workers rose up in unison to throw off the shackles of the east. Chrysanthemum's garrison had been ambushed all throughout the city and forced into a corner, and though they slaughtered countless hundreds of patriots and believers, they were overwhelmed and forced to flee or surrender. Though Verdant, the birthplace of The Rising Fire, remained under Vermilion's control, it wouldn't be held hostage for long. Soon, the growing strength of The Rising Fire would scorch its way east and seize Vermilion, and the corrupt and hedonistic mystics of The Way of Fire would be ousted from the country. Only Rising Sun could save Kiria, and save it she would.\n\nA building behind her let out a gush of fire as it collapsed, momentarily silhouetting the mare in harsh pink light. She was the leader of The Rising Fire, and she was the leader of the movement that would save the poor and oppressed kirin of Kiria from the reformers in Vermilion and the enslavers of Fragrance. She would march to Vermilion, and the imperial city would soon fall beneath the unstoppable tide of patriotism and righteous fury. And then, once she had Matriarch Rain Shine under her control, it would all be over.\n\nThe fire dance had begun."

kirin.104.d:0 "Fickle Current watched from Fragrance's docks as the government officials from Vermilion were forced onto the steamer ship in its harbor, an assembled guard of NAKP kirin keeping a watchful eye on the captured officials. The northern coup had gone off without a hitch thanks to the organisation and resources of the returnees that formed the backbone of the NAKP. Overnight, the governors of the north met in Fragrance to declare the Emergency Council for the Protection of North Kiria in response to the secession of the Fraternal Republic in the west. Once the council was called, NAKP paramilitaries moved quickly to round up and arrest all the government officials throughout the north, quickly installing their own figures loyal to the party in their places. The coordinated strike had even managed to seize all the important infrastructure in the north: arms depots, railway stations, telegraph offices, and more. A few dozen kirin had been injured in the scuffle, but the takeover had been so well planned and operated so smoothly that nokirin had died. Which was good, because then it was easier to claim self-defence to the court in Vermilion and the outside world, and move closer to officially establishing the north's independence.\n\nTruth be told, Fickle Current had been planning this move for a long time, well before the secession of the Fraternal Republic; it had just been a convenient excuse to organize the coup. And now, after issuing a radio statement the night before damning the Reform Bureau for degeneracy, corruption, and bringing the Realm to the brink of ruin, and promising that Fragrance and the NAKP would lead Kiria into a truly modern state, the north found its position slowly gaining strength and preparing to defend its independence. He would create a state for the diaspora returnees, one without the crippling decrees and hesitancy of the Vermilion court and the Reform Bureau, one that was willing to do whatever it took to bring the glories of capitalism to this long-forgotten realm. And maybe, once they were strong enough, they would be able to turn their focus to the rest of Kiria, and bring them into the future, kicking and screaming, whether they wanted to or not.\n\nFor now, though, time was his friend.

At the NAKP's urging, and offered legitimacy by the Procurate's concerns over the acceptance of the Rising Fire heretics into the Plenum, kirin and local officials all throughout the Greater Providence region of the north ousted the government officials appointed by Vermilion in their towns and cities and proclaimed loyalty to the Kirian National Front for Patriotic Salvation, stating their belief that only the guidance and protection of Fragrance and Rhapsody could save the Realm from the complete and imminent collapse of the disastrous Grand Gallop Onward campaign. The proclamation was issued in conjunction with a coordinated strike to seize the north's infrastructure: arms depots, railway stations, telegraph offices, and more, and was executed brilliantly, with no kirin killed in the scuffle. Which was good, because then it was easier to claim self-defence to the court in Vermilion and the outside world, and move one step closer to guaranteeing and protecting Greater Providence's right to rule.\n\nNow, after Current issued a radio statement the night before damning the Reform Bureau for degeneracy and corruption, bringing the Realm to the brink of ruin, and promising that Fragrance, Rhapsody, and the NAKP would lead Kiria into a truly modern state, the north found its position slowly gaining the strength it needed to defend itself.

The Rising Fire forces stationed within the city, however, claimed that Rain Shine was being held against her will by the radical reformers in Vermilion, and that it was The Rising Fire that fought in hers and Concord's names, not the banners of Vermilion, and any true believers in the banner should defect and fight to free their Matriarch. It was at that point that field guns stationed on the banks of the Great Mellifluve opened fire on the banner regiment, killing scores instantly and scattering the soldiers as they fled for cover.\n\nImmediately, both sides blamed the other for being at fault. In Vermilion, Premier Autumn Blaze declared, with tears brimming her eyelashes, that The Rising Fire and all who professed its beliefs were rebels and traitors to The Realm of Kiria and Matriarch Superior Rain Shine, and demanded their surrender and peaceful reintegration for the good of the Realm. Priestess Rising Sun, however, proclaimed that the Republic of Kiria was now at war with the Realm of Kiria to rescue the Matriarch from her corrupted and heretical captors in Vermilion, and called upon all kirin of the land to join The Rising Fire and save Concord's chosen avatar from the radical reformers who brought pain and ruin to Kiria. Kirin from both sides have now answered the call to arms, and divisions of hastily assembled troops are moving toward the west branch of the Great Mellifluve, with both sides ready to fight in the name of their Matriarch in Vermilion.\n\nBoth sides are determined to fight to the bitter end. Only time will tell how many kirin will die as The Way of Fire, which once unified the kirin species and ended the era of warlords, has failed in a way nokirin could ever have predicted."

I'm just Acting Premier while she's taking some time off for her mental health."\n\n"If I considered that mare our premier I wouldn't have addressed you by her title," Winter Frost said with a dismissive wave of her hoof. Then she brought that hoof down on Fern's desk. "The Realm is in crisis, and Autumn is incapacitated. It's up to us to fix this mess. The banners are in disarray, and the commonfolk in the far west have fallen to heresy and are rising up against us. Autumn's foolish Grand Gallop Onward left them behind, and now we've lost them to a demagogue who twists Concord's word into a whip she uses to get what she wants. They spurn Matriarch Rain Shine while claiming to fight in her name. We have to destroy them all if we want to bring peace and prosperity back to Concord's realm."\n\n"The west isn't our only problem," Fern Flare reminded her. "Fickle Current took his friends back to Fragrance and have established their own de facto state there. The kirin of Greater Providence in the north have always been more reluctant to follow Vermilion's rule, and I've heard that even Rhapsody is tempted to throw its lot in with Fragrance. Current was clever; he made sure that Greater Providence received the bulk of the Realm's industrialization efforts, and now Fragrance has an industrial base that rivals the rest of the Realm. And as time goes on, he'll only grow stronger. We can only hope that they don't push for war as well."\n\n"If they have any common sense, they won't," Winter insisted. "For now, we must focus on shoring up the loyalty of the kirin in East and Central Kiria. War is coming to their homes, and they have to be ready to defend the Way of Fire and the Matriarch Superior.""

The distant crack and pop of fireworks from the morning service punctuated the pagoda's interior, though in light of the topic on Winter's mind, she couldn't help but imagining them as the reports of distant rifles in the countryside. Concord willing, that sound would never make its way to Vermilion, but she had to be prepared for that eventuality.\n\nWhen all the mystics had taken their seats, Winter Frost slowly looked over each of them in turn. Some were young, but many, many more were old kirin, kirin who had spent decades faithfully serving the Realm under The Silence. They had done their part to keep the peace and hold the Realm together while faithfully following the Matriarch's decrees, and now she had gathered them here to explain how they would serve the Matriarch in a new way.\n\n"Concord has seen fit to test our resolve by arranging us against Her enemies," Winter Frost began. "The Realm is under assault by villains who would destroy everything the Way of Fire stands for. Everything we have struggled to achieve would be undone in an instant if we do not fight for it. So fight we will."\n\nShe took a deep breath and unfurled a scroll stamped with the Matriarch's seal before her, turning it so the other kirin assembled could see it. "The Way of Fire must lead from the front if we are to safeguard the soul of Kiria. It is not enough to be spiritual mystics and temple priests, guiding our wayward followers toward a pious life. Now we must become battlefield leaders, chaplains, and provocateurs to fight against the enemy wherever it rears its head. We will fight to restore the Way of Fire, fight for Concord's holiness, and fight to redeem our realm from treachery and heresy. We must show the Matriarch Superior our utmost loyalty and devotion, and support her in these horrid times. Some of us will fall, some of us will falter, but so too will new heroes and champions of Concord rise to the challenge. It is up to us, up to each and every one of us, to strive to become that kirin."\n\nWith one final nod, she rolled the decree back up with her magic and set it aside.

That was about to change.\n\nThe studio technician gave her the signal, and Rain Shine drew the speech she'd prepared closer to her face. "Concord's blessings be upon you, kirin of the Realm," she began, her voice trembling slightly as she tried to imagine she was speaking not into a radio, but to a kirin in her home. "I have always tried to do what is best for you. You are more than my subjects, for we are all foals of Concord, each and every one of us. We are a family. And whenever I think about the consequences of my actions, I think first about how they would affect my family.\n\n"The Grand Gallop Onward was supposed to be a new beginning for Kiria," she continued. "We would leave the stillness of the Silence and join the chorus of the modern world. Concord willing, I would be able to bring my family to a new life of peace and prosperity. We would follow the model of successful countries like Equestria, where democracy, constitutional rule, and the guiding hoof of benevolent leaders ensure equal opportunity and a safe and happy life for everykirin. I believe that these ideals hold water, and they are the ideal that all creatures should strive towards."\n\nShe took a deep breath and let that statement settle into the minds of her listeners across the Realm. "We are still reaching for that ideal, even in the trying times we now find ourselves in. There are those that would subvert our peaceful desires to suit their own ends. They would replace selflessness with selfishness, compassion with disdain, freedom with tyranny. They would twist the word of Concord to suit their own selfish desires. But we will not let them. I still believe in peace, but regretfully they leave us with no choice. In order to protect our family, we must discipline those that would tear it apart. I am now calling on you, kirin of the Realm, my brothers and sisters in Concord, to take up arms and to defend our future. Only together can we see the Realm out of these dark days.

The Realm and Harmony Party was merely a shell of what it once was, but somehow, Fern needed to find the strength to keep what was left of it together.\n\nUnfortunately, for better or for worse, the current crisis gave the party plenty of reason to stick together.

We have to stay true to our promise for the Realm: a departure from conservative superstition, and a chance to bring harmony and democracy to all kirin. Fickle Current fights to carve up Kiria for foreigners, and the Rising Fire challenges our worship of Concord, our Matriarch, and our entire way of life. This is a war of ideologies; how can we hope to survive if we don't stay true to our own?"\n\n"We cannot alienate the Way of Fire by refusing to cooperate with them in this time of crisis!" A third kirin protested. "We must first focus on defeating the threats to the safety of the Realm by working together. Once the Realm is safe once more, then we can push for our principles and beliefs!"\n\nFern Flare listened to the angry voices beginning to rise around her, and she bit on her lip as she realized she needed to represent the party's will and put a stop to it before it got worse.

Fern Flare asked in an exasperated voice. Winter Frost stood indignantly on the other side of Fern's desk as the brown mare rubbed at her nose scales and took a deep breath. "Autumn is personal friends with two of the Elements of Harmony. Their influence in Equestria is considerable. If we ask and invoke the Hyacinth Accord with our pony friends across the sea, they will be more than generous with leveraging what they can for our cause. We can negotiate a lend-lease agreement and even ask for some military advisors to help shape up our forces. Surely if we have the means to acquire equipment and expertise from our friends, we should by all means pursue it?"\n\n"The last thing Kiria needs is more foreigners on our soil," Winter Frost adamantly stated. "The more we invite in, the less control we have over our country. How long before they fill out our government, too? They already stole Fragrance and our industry. They are nothing but trouble."\n\n"Like we have much control over the Realm right now," Fern bitterly remarked. "And if we don't get help, we're not going to lose what we have."\n\n"If you want help from the Equestrians so much, then have them send us supplies and machinery so we can make our own weapons. The Realm is for Concord and her foals, not a plaything for foreigners, and we will win it back ourselves.""

But if we rely on foreigners to solve our problems for us, what does that tell Concord about her foals? That we cannot survive without the help of foreign creatures and their false gods?" She shook her head and frowned. "Winter Frost and I do not see eye to eye on most things. But this is something we can agree on."\n\nWinter nodded, similarly frowning. "The most we can afford to accept from Equestria are supplies and machinery. Kirin will win this war, not foreigners. And if you try to force this measure through without us, you can forget about our support in anything else you want to pass through for as long as you're acting in Autumn's stead.""

kirin_loyalists.7.d:0 ""Princess 2-2, you're cleared for landing. Try not to bang up the gear as much this time, over."\n\nSundown Skye smirked as she reached for her radio in her cramped cockpit. "Been a while since I flew a Gladiator, Control. Hurricanes have a little cushion to their gear. Something that'd be really nice when landing on a dirt airfield."\n\n"We take what we can get out here, Skye. Now set her down, I heard somepony say we're due for a night in town. And I know how you've been eyeing up those Vermilion mares. Talk about eye candy!"\n\n"Can you blame me?" Skye chuckled as she gently pulled on the stick, turning her biplane toward the landing strip. The airstrip had been freshly built with Equestrian engineers, and the parkway was lined with Equestrian biplanes gleaming under the Zebrican sun. All were painted in traditional air force camo, with the exception of a black and gold stripe running down the midline of the fuselage, and the same pattern painted over the Equestrian roundels on the wings. They were all Thunderbolts planes, a volunteer air force sent over from Equestria to help their harmonic kirin allies in the ongoing civil war. The chance to fly over some distant and exotic country had been too good of an opportunity to pass up, and Skye had immediately volunteered to join the Thunderbolts and fight in the name of harmony abroad. It also didn't hurt that the pay was good... real good. She was making three times as much as she did in the Equestrian air force to fly an outdated biplane and sortie against an enemy that could barely afford anti-air guns. All in all, it was like a hunting trip, except her weapon was an aeroplane and her quarry were rebellious kirin fighting against harmony. Her wingponies were all comrades, and they weren't soldiers, just employees of the Realm and Harmony party, which made it about as relaxing a war as Skye could imagine. And the pony in the control tower was right; Skye was definitely enjoying the chance to sample some of the local wildlife while on leave, to put it one way.\n\nStill, she couldn't help herself. As she approached the runway, she yanked hard on the stick, sending her aircraft into an aileron roll just before landing. After righting the plane and feeling the landing gear shudder as they hit the dirt, her radio crackled to life one more time."

kirin_loyalists.9.d:0 "Doctor Lucent Shine had worked up a lather by the time he made it back to his house and hopped off of his bicycle. He was getting better at this, he thought to himself; while never a particularly athletic kirin, Lucent had resolved to use a bicycle to make his commute to the temple where he'd taken up teaching electrical engineering ever since the All-Kiria Collegium shuttered its doors with the outbreak of civil war. The benefits were twofold; his bike didn't need gasoline unlike his automobile, which was such a precious resource for Vermilion's armed forces that any waste couldn't be spared, and it helped him stay in shape. After all, if the war took a bad turn, Vermilion would soon be putting a rifle in his hooves to defend the Matriarch, regardless of his status as an intellectual and the former professor of electrical engineering at Manehattan Polytechnic.\n\nAs he wheeled his bicycle up the driveway to his front door, he waved at his neighbors sitting on their porch drinking tea. They waved back, and one of the two mares drinking tea stood up and leaned against the railing. "Can I ask you something, Doctor?" she asked him, her local accent coloring her words in a way that Doctor Lucent was still getting used to after living his entire life in Manehattan. "Why didn't you go with the rest of them?"\n\nLucent paused and cocked his head. "Rest of them?" he asked back. "You mean the members of the diaspora that went with Fickle Current to Fragrance?"\n\n"The very same," the mare answered. "I heard that they're rich in Fragrance. That Current stallion keeps them well cared for. They even opened a new college there. So why stay in Vermilion?"\n\n"Because it's not about money." Lucent shrugged. "I was foaled in Equestria, and I grew up being taught about friendship and peace and harmony. When the Silence ended and kirin started coming back to our home, I couldn't help but join in. I wanted to show everykirin here what it was like to live in a country as wonderful as Equestria, and it's not a dream I've given up on yet. We'll get through this; there's still a chance for harmony in Kiria yet." Then he touched his hoof to his horn as if tipping his nonexistent hat and left his neighbors to think about his words."

kirin_loyalists.10.d:0 "Line after line after line of recruits filled the training field, alternating between push-ups and prancing in place with the whistle of the drill sergeant as they worked on their physical conditioning. Fern Flare watched them with the camp's commander, Scarlet Rose, as the next line of defense prepared to take the field for the future of Kiria and its Matriarch. "They seem better than the last time I was here," Fern remarked to the commander.\n\nScarlet Rose nodded. "When you were last here, the Banners were in chaos. We were fighting a war with militias and ad-hoc bannerkirin regiments. Nokirin was truly ready for a war, but there it was. Yet we survived our trial by fire, and things are improving, albeit slowly."\n\n"Mmhmm." Fern Flare watched the soldiers training for a few seconds of silence before steering the conversation towards the real reason she had decided to visit the training fields. "I heard that these bannerkirin were provided by Winter Frost," Fern Flare said. "Devouts she managed to scrape together from some of the villages in the mountains. And I also heard that she wants to expedite their training and put them under the command of some of her Valiants."\n\n"You heard right," Scarlet said. "And I would be wary of it if I were you. You should know even better than I do that that mare is always working an angle. Way I see it, she's worried that the Realm and Harmony Party is getting too much power. Most of our commanders in the field are part of Autumn's party, and I bet if you made them choose, they'd stick with her over the Way of Fire and the priests sitting in their temples. Winter doesn't like that, so she wants to have her own bannerkirin regiments serving the faith first and the Realm second."\n\n"Yet we all fight and serve the Realm, no matter who we agree with more," Fern said, a frown forming on her face. "I don't like that at all. We shouldn't be dividing the loyalties of the troops in the field. That's going to cause more problems down the line, I can already tell." She thought for a moment and tapped her hoof against her chin. "There are more ways to serve the Realm than fighting, I suppose," Fern said, feeling out her thoughts. "Not all of our Banner families are renowned warriors. Many were economic powerhouses rather than military masterminds. Why not direct some of these banners towards military production? Perhaps the ones with an extraordinary relationship with the mystics of the Way of Fire?""

kirin_loyalists.11.d:0 ""Present, ARMS!"\n\nFern Flare watched with a shiver as the entire corps of soldiers performed a rifle salute in the parade grounds before the Vermilion Palace, with row after row of steel bayonets glistening in the sun. All the assembled kirin part of the first regiment of the Volunteer Guard 1st Corps were smartly dressed in their parade uniform, and a tall vermilion and pink banner fluttered at the head of the corps. Their regiment had been proudly christened 'Realm and Harmony' by the Realm and Harmony Party, and Fern Flare knew that they represented the best of the best of the Vermilion banners. But what really struck her about the kirin assembled before her for inspection was how young and full of vigor they were.\n\nShe turned to the bannerkirin commander, who turned to face her expectantly. "Shield-General Bright Burn, was it?" she asked. "Your regiment is a model for the rest of the banners to aspire towards. But I can't help but notice that most of your soldiers barely look like they've seen twenty winters."\n\n"Many of them haven't, ma'am," Bright Burn responded, to Fern Flare's surprise. "We're all volunteers from various trots of life, but these are our prime years, as strong as we'll ever be. We've all decided to dedicate them to the Realm and to the Matriarch. Even if we die, at least we'll die in the name of Harmony."\n\n"Teenagers and young mares and stallions shouldn't be so ready to die," Fern Flare said, taken aback. "You have your entire lives ahead of you!"\n\n"And what would those lives mean if the Realm falls, ma'am?" Bright Burn asked her. "I graduated from the Royal University of Canterlot and intended to work my way into the Royal Guard someway, somehow. But when Premier Autumn ended the Silence and announced her intent to reform the Realm in the model of the adoptive country I had grown to love so much, I changed my plans to return here and help her. Now, the best way to help her is to fight for her. Every one of us knows that we might die, ma'am, but we also know that there are countless more who cannot fight for what's right. If we die so that somekirin else can live in peace and plenty, then we are willing to make that sacrifice."\n\nThe bold statement took Fern Flare's words away, and all she could do was clumsily nod her understanding. She felt her throat tighten, and she couldn't manage to look Bright Burn in the eyes."

kirin_loyalists.12.d:0 "Standard-General Firetail looked out at the recruits that had gathered in the town with a mixture of admiration and concern. Admiration because so many faces had gathered willingly in the town to pledge themselves to the Territorial Volunteers. Concern because most were too old or too young to be deemed fit to serve in the banners themselves. But Firetail had put out a summons through all the surrounding villages for willing volunteers to enroll with the Territorial Volunteers to protect their homes, and over a hundred kirin had answered that call.\n\nEven if they had all been young and fit adults, the weapons they brought with them would hardly make them more than a mob. Most carried sabres and arquebuses, and those that didn't held farming implements by their sides. Firetail had brought a crate of modern rifles with him and his entourage, but that would barely equip a third of the kirin assembled here today. But it would make do. After all, it wasn't like they were marching these kirin off to war.\n\nHe watched as his officers helped divide and organize the volunteers by village and hamlet. The Territorial Volunteers were never intended to be a professional fighting force; it was only to police the hinterlands so that the able-bodied kirin could go fight on the front lines. But they had an advantage that even the fit and valiant conscripts lacked; this land was their home, and they knew it well. Any river crossings, any mountainous passes, any hidden dens and coves, these kirin knew about, and the invaders did not. They could use the land to their advantage, multiplying their ragtag force while mitigating the strengths of their enemies. And on top of everything else, these kirin fought for their homes and their families, and nothing else. There was no greater motivator than doing whatever it took to defend one's own.\n\nThey were motivated, they were trusted by their neighbors, and they were willing to stand up when nokirin else could. For that, Firetail knew they would exceed his expectations."

She watched from the sidelines as a band played and young mares and stallions danced on a dance floor, each dressed to the nines in their dress uniforms. Tonight was the graduation ceremony for the current cohort of kirin from the Massicot War School, and these proud kirin, now finally having attained their officer's rank after months of brutal and intense study and drill, found themselves enjoying one last chance to relax and celebrate as if there wasn't a war going on.\n\n"So young and innocent," Autumn could only remark with a sigh when Fern Flare joined her at the side of the dance hall. "But happy, too. It feels like it's been forever since I felt anything like they do."\n\nThe rueful remark elicited a look of concern from Fern, but she let it slip by without challenge; she was just happy to see Autumn participating in something social for once. "We had to graduate them six months early, but plenty of them will finish their training on the battlefield," Fern said. "We'll send the best to the front lines, and the rest will go to Vermilion and other administrative hubs to help keep the wheels turning. Their job is just as important, if not moreso. But I'm confident they will succeed."\n\nAutumn nodded and took a sip of her drink, feeling the burn of alcohol crawl down her throat and humming. "Most of these kirin have RaHP pins, don't they?" she observed, pointing at a pair of stallions dancing together not too far away.\n\n"We've been able to keep a good grasp on who gets admitted to the War School," Fern admitted with a shrug. "All these kirin strongly believe in harmony, just like the last few cohorts we've graduated through the school. We're building a strong force in the field that believes in what we're fighting for."\n\n"Strong as it can be with dwindling enrollment," Autumn said, and Fern arched an eyebrow in surprise. Autumn could only laugh. "I'm still the Premier, you know, even if I've done a terrible job of acting like it. I did my best to catch up on what I missed before tonight, and I noticed that enrollment has been flagging. Fewer and fewer kirin are meeting the party's criteria for admittance, and it's starting to get concerning. If we don't slacken our standards a little, we might not have enough kirin to push through many more cohorts.""

She'd come a long way from the daughter of farmers; now she was sitting in the Matriarch's study, sharing tea with the embodiment of Concord's divinity made flesh.\n\nAfter the usual pleasantries, Rain Shine set her cup back on its platter and smiled at Fern. "I've enjoyed getting to know you better, Fern, so I hope this will not come across as rude if I ask about Autumn's health. She is a dear friend of mine. Is she doing well?"\n\n"She's getting better," Fern assured her. "Hopefully, it won't be too long before she's sitting here instead of me. Until then, I'm only doing my best to fill her place." She set her own cup down and touched the folder she'd brought with her to the meeting. "I have a proposal that I would like your thoughts on. The war..." she hesitated at the look of sadness that flashed across Rain Shine's face, if only to disappear behind divine neutrality as quickly as it arrived. "It's not wise to make premature conjectures, but it is wise to be prepared for all outcomes. This one in particular considers territory lost to the secessionists." She opened the folder with her magic, revealing the dozens of documents stuffed inside. "We've organized plans for stay-behind brigades, equipment caches, and resistance training for soldiers and operatives. Volunteers will disguise as civilians and help sabotage critical targets. Only... we've had to rely more than we'd like to on the Way of Fire."\n\n"Oh?" Rain Shine's brow furrowed. "You make that sound like a bad thing."\n\n"The devout are the backbone of our resistance efforts, and their zealotry will be helpful in fighting against impossible odds," Fern Flare admitted. "But zeal can be counter-productive, and the Way of Fire sees this war as a personal affront to Concord Herself... and you. I'm afraid that in their hooves, resistance could quickly become terrorism. Devotion is a powerful motivator, but times have changed. The Way isn't the be-all and end-all that it used to be. The kirin fight for other ideals now; a democratic future, yes, and their loyalty to you, their Matriarch, but also for their homes and families. We don't need sleeper cells of zealous terrorists, but a network of trained organisers who can sustain long-term resistance efforts with grassroots support."\n\nAt that, she closed the folder as both mares frowned at it.

kirin_loyalists.15.d:0 "The doors to the throne room opened unexpectedly, interrupting Matriarch Rain Shine's conversation with Fern Flare. All heads turned toward the open doors, where a raggedy kirin stallion stepped forward, a confused soldier worriedly following right on his tail. It took her a second, but Rain Shine soon recognized the commander of the Banner of the Covered Cage, Kiria's obscurely infamous secret police who once enforced the edicts of The Silence. "Commander Ember Wane, to what do I owe the—oh my!" Rain Shine exclaimed upon seeing the soaked red bandages on his leg and shoulder. "What happened?"\n\n"Bandits on the road. Nothing to worry about," Ember Wane replied, though the response was forced through gritted teeth. He stopped in front of Rain Shine's throne and gave her a stiff bow. "Reporting for duty, Matriarch."\n\n"You are in no position to report for duty," Fern Flare insisted, looking the stallion over with equal parts concern and wary. She'd learned more than she would have liked to have known about the Covered Cage in her time in Autumn's stead; the Covered Cage had doggedly enforced the edicts of the Silence during Matriarch Noctilucent Charm's rule, and they supposedly exacted extreme punishments on villages that refused to comply. But she also knew why Ember Wane was supposedly here. "What happened to your banner?"\n\n"Scattered. Dead. I don't know," Ember replied with a sigh. "When the Silence ended, we were at our weakest. And we were never officially recognized by the Matriarchate. Most simply left for greener pastures, or tried opposing the seditious secessionists on their own. My Banner is spent."\n\n"I'm sorry," Rain Shine apologized, bowing her head. "If I had known how much we could have used your aid, we would have reorganized the Banner sooner. As it stands, we need all the help we can get."\n\n"My Banner may be gone, but I'm still standing," Ember said, rising from his bow. "And I will help any way I can.""

kirin_loyalists.16.d:0 "Ember Wane stood on a grassy hill, looking out over the gentle slopes and curves as dozens of trucks arranged themselves in the field behind him to unload their ancient contents. There had once been a town here, but not many kirin knew it; the Banner of the Covered Cage, the organization he proudly served, had expunged its heresy from the Realm decades ago, leaving not a trace of the kirin who had once defied Matriarch Noctilucent Charm's will. But those kirin had created marvels in their heresy; perhaps it was fitting that he had brought them here to see if their memory could at last serve the Realm.\n\nThe kirin behind him hauled crate after crate out of the backs of the trucks, and when they arranged them in the field, they cracked open the boxes to reveal dusty clockwork golems fifty years old. As the laborers positioned and unpacked hundreds of crates on the hillside, Ember Wane trotted to the side where several artificers sat with all sorts of monitoring equipment, including a half dozen thin and curly metal antennae jutting out of bulky boxes. In front of the artificers, a battery of howitzers had been assembled, aimed down at the field where the test would begin. If the golems went rogue upon being activated, Ember was certain to ensure that he lost nothing other than a few dozen rounds of ordinance.\n\nSoon, the laborers' work was completed, and they withdrew to safety, leaving the chiliad of golems standing stiffly in the field. All Ember had to do was spare the artificers a nod, and the other kirin did the rest; shouting orders to each other, they ran through their procedures, and then somekirin pressed a brass button on one of the antennae boxes. The air thrummed with charged static, and everykirin held their breath as they waited for a response.\n\nAfter what felt like an eternity, the golems began to jerk, and bellows of steam erupted from their metal hides as they powered up. They stood in place, awaiting command, and at Ember Wane's raised hoof, the artificers set the golems to march 50 paces forward. In lockstep syncopation, the constructs responded to the order, their thundering hooves the only thing audible for a mile. After 50 paces, they stopped in unison, awaiting their next orders, and Ember let a pleased smile adorn his muzzle."

kirin_loyalists.17.d:0 "The peaceful stillness over the lake was broken with riotous yelling, sending a pair of cranes fleeing skyward to escape the commotion. Down by the shoreline, the locals of a nearby town followed a procession of Way of Fire priests to the water, where a cadre of soldiers hauled several bound, beaten, and broken kirin onto a small barge. Some of the prisoners fought back, some cried, and some seemed resigned to their fates.\n\nAs the congregation formed into an unruly semicircle by the shoreline, the seniormost priest turned to address the crowd. "The kirin you see before you have been tried and convicted of heresy most damning," she announced in a solemn voice. "They have acted against the interests of the Matriarch, of the Realm, and of Concord Herself in pledging themselves to the lies and deceit of the Rising Fire. For that, they have been condemned to a heretic's death, so that their heresy may serve as an example to those who would turn their back on Concord."\n\nOne by one, the soldiers on the barge roughly forced the prisoners into flame-retardant sacks, sewing the only opening shut with a heavy cord attached to leaden weights. The last prisoner kicked and screamed as she realized what was about to happen, and it took three soldiers to force the writhing and thrashing mare into her sack. "No!" she screamed at the top of her lungs. "I'm innocent, I swear! I love Concord! I love the Matriarch, no, don't do it!" But her cries fell on deaf ears, and a gag was forced into her muzzle before she herself ended up inside a sack like her fellow condemned.\n\nAs the soldiers pushed the barge out into the middle of the lake on poles, the priest only continued her sermon to the crowd. "When we die, our bodies are burned so that our flame may rejoin the Primordial Fire that Concord nurtures in heaven, but what is doused in water may never burn. Thus is the fate of all heretics; the fish shall feast on their flesh and leave little but their sodden bones behind, and so their souls shall remain bound to this world in eternal torture. Let this serve as a lesson and warning to those that would take up arms against the Matriarch and the Realm: heresy shall always be punished, and only true devotion will make Concord proud of her foals."\n\nHer final words were punctuated with the first of several splashes as the soldiers kicked the writhing sacks into the lake."

Inside, representatives of those factions still loyal to Vermilion gathered to witness a landmark historical accord to be delivered by Matriarch Superior Rain Shine herself. Within the hour, the Matriarch would take the unprecedented step of condemning persecution of the Rising Fire, who had remained steadfast allies of Vermilion in these troubling times even despite their religious differences with the Way of Fire.\n\nOf course, it would never be that simple. Before the Matriarch arrived, representatives of both sects had squared off over some of the details in the soon to be announced proclamation, their grievances championed by Rising Sun and Winter Frost as the two mares all but literally butted horns in the center of the Secretariat. "Do you think I cannot see what this is?" Winter Frost challenged, baring teeth that had started growing unsettlingly long as she did her best to control her rage. "As soon as your heresy is unshackled you and your followers will do everything you can to spread it like a pestilence upon the Realm."\n\n"If you strip the right of the Rising Fire to coexist with the Way of Fire, then my supporters and I will trot out of this room and make our peace with the North," Sun threatened. "You will be on your own to face Fickle Current's industrial fury."\n\nWinter sneered, but she recognized the fangs in Rising Sun's threat. "I will not renege my support in the eleventh hour," she finally assured Sun. "But the Way of Fire is the state religion of Kiria, and it has been our salvation for centuries. I want a clause added to the accord that expressly states that the Way of Fire holds primacy over the Rising Fire in all matters, especially in what is taught and sponsored by the state."\n\n"You accuse me of trickery for personal gain and then seek to subordinate me to your orthodoxy?" Sun challenged, bristling. "I will never allow such a clause to find its way into the accord. If you really want a sign of good faith, how about this: we will agree to let the Way of Fire be the practiced state religion if you agree to not interfere with our right to profess our beliefs. I get what I want, you get what you want. Happy? If not, I withdraw my support of this accord, and Vermilion itself.""

"Speak, Snowfall," she told the acolyte. "You would not be here if it weren't important."\n\n"It is important," Snowfall admitted, and she took a deep breath. "The Way of Fire has had overwhelming success in encouraging Vermilion to see things from our point of view, as I'm sure you're aware. We've almost entirely overpowered the dissenting voices in the Rising Fire, drowning them out in the truth of Concord's word."\n\nWinter Frost blinked and cocked her head.

kirin_loyalists.20.d:0 "Rising Sun had always enjoyed heat, enjoyed fire. Perhaps it was cliche for a mare with her name, but the hot days of summer had always been her favorite, and even if she couldn't get outside to enjoy the heat, she always liked the crackling blaze of a fire, of feeling the smoke tickle her nostrils and the back of her throat. There was an old saying among the kirin, something along the lines of 'play with fire and expect to be burned', but Rising had never been burned before. Not even when she held her hoof over the open flame of a burning brazier devoted to Concord within one of Her many temples, letting the pink and blue flames lick against her hoof.\n\nHer ears perked at the sound of the temple doors opening behind her, and she gracefully turned around to greet her visitor. She recognized Dayspring Rose, one of her most faithful acolytes and personal pupil, and a smile adorned her muzzle. "Dayspring, my child," she said, warmly, pleasantly. "Do you care to pray with me?"\n\n"I would enjoy that, Priestess," Dayspring said, momentarily bowing her head. "But before I do, I have something I'd like to discuss..."\n\n"Speak," Rising Sun said, and she turned back to the burning brazier, sitting before it as she let its heat wash over her. Dayspring did the same, sparing the fire a look before hesitantly turning toward her mentor.\n\n"We have had outstanding success illuminating the kirin of the Realm in the ways of the true faith," Dayspring began. "More kirin in the Realm believe in the ultimate truth of the Rising Fire than they do the dogmatic orthodoxy of the Way of Fire that has given them so little for so long. But I fear we may be too successful, if such a circumstance could be imagined."\n\n"I'm having difficulty imagining it," Rising said, raising an eyebrow. "Could you elaborate?"\n\n"Well, I mean... Matriarch Rain Shine is always going to support the Way of Fire," Dayspring admitted, even if it put a frown on Rising Sun's muzzle. "That is who she is. That is what the Realm is, at least for now. The Way of Fire still holds tremendous sway over the Realm if only through its history. If we crush their voice, force them out of the future of the Realm... I'm afraid they'll do something drastic."\n\nRising Sun thought on that for a moment, then nodded. "Yes, that is wise," she agreed. "Perhaps I have been pushing Winter Frost too hard. Cooperation benefits all... so long as we're the ones charting the course.""

kirin_loyalists.21.d:0 "A light rain fell over the small village as Clementine hopped out of the back of the truck, and he quickly drew the hood of his coat up over his horn to keep himself dry. He looked around, orienting himself in the small town before trotting off to the well-lit windows of the inn. All the while, thunder rumbled in the distance, though Clementine knew it wasn't from a storm. He wondered how close to this little no-name village the frontlines had drawn now.\n\nWhen he entered the inn, he scanned the room and the number of kirin gathered inside before he found the liaison he was to meet with. She was a large mare, especially for a kirin, and muscles toned from years of hard work on a farm rippled under her red coat as she moved and joked with her companions. Clementine, on the other hoof, had never worked on a farm in his life; born and raised in Equestria like much of the Diaspora, he had volunteered to return to Kiria at the behest of Autumn Blaze and the Realm and Harmony Party to spread the ideals of Harmony to his struggling homeland. To say the red mare intimidated him was an understatement.\n\nNevertheless, he had a job to fulfill, and fulfill it he would for his country and its way of life. The red mare and her comrades looked Clementine over as he approached, and a few snickered behind their hooves, but the stallion did his best to brush that aside and speak with confidence. "Red Dawn, my name is Clementine. I was sent by the RaHP to aid and assist in the defence of this town in any way possible. The RaHP hopes that by fostering cooperation with the Rising Fire along the frontlines, we can work together to create a more harmonic and peaceful Kiria when the dust settles. I've spent most of my life living in Equestria, and I believe that by following their ideas of harmony and cooperation, we can make a Kiria as great and prosperous as them."\n\nRed Dawn raised an eyebrow at the scrawny stallion in front of her and snorted in amusement. "You really think you can fix Kiria with some fancy ideas you learned in some far away place, kid?" she asked him. Before he could answer, she let out a laugh and scooped the young stallion up in a muscular foreleg, dragging him to her side in a crushing hug that left him wheezing for breath. "Don't worry, kid. Kiria isn't the same as Equestria, but we'll see you straight. After a few weeks fighting with us, you'll see how the world really works. How's that sound?""

kirin_loyalists.22.t:0 "On the Funding of Temples"
kirin_loyalists.22.d:0 "Rising Sun listened to the endless string of speeches by prominent priests and mystics of The Way of Fire with a similarly endless contempt. Two weeks ago, she had instructed one of her junior acolytes to put forward a motion in the Morning Secretariat to suspend the collection of tithes and donations to Way of Fire temples and monasteries in order to procure funds to support the ongoing war against the NAKP, and as she had predicted, the motion had ignited a spectacular firestorm in the chamber. She had carefully arranged several of her best orators and even enlisted in the aid of economists and advisors to make clear what should have been a simple choice, but that damnable priestess Winter Frost and her allies had initiated what had essentially become a filibuster campaign to kill the motion by bringing in mystic after mystic to lecture to the Secretariat about the moral virtue and religious significance of the tithes. Somehow Winter and her friends expected the rest of the Secretariat to believe that allowing the priests to continue to leech off of the poor and impoverished like parasites pleased Concord, but Rising Sun and the rest of her followers knew all too well that the Way of Fire simply wanted to maintain their hedonistic lives while the rest of Kiria burned around them.\n\nBut now it seemed like Winter had finally run out of notable kirin to bring before the Secretariat, and even the harmonists of the Realm and Harmony Party, so eager to let everykirin have their voice heard, were sick of the debate. Seizing her chance, Rising Sun once more brought up a vote to end debate on the matter, and Winter Frost's traditionalist allies were swiftly outvoted by unanimous votes from their opposition. All that was left now was to see who had made the better point: the practical arguments of the Rising Fire, or the eulogizing morality of the Way of Fire."

Many of the heretic's bills were easily shot down by Winter's coalition of traditionalists and members of the RaHP that remained suitably pious to Concord's divine teachings, but this most recent one had become a thorn in her side that she couldn't quite make go away.\n\nLast week, Rising Sun had brought forward a motion to allow the provinces to choose their own regional administrators rather than allowing the Way of Fire to appoint temporal clerics throughout the land as it had traditionally done for centuries. Such a change would normally be too radical to draw substantial support from Fern Flare's Realm and Harmony Party, but the illusion of democracy had proven an alluring temptation for too many of its members. But Winter Frost knew better. She knew the heretical sway Rising Sun and her cult had on the commoners of Kiria, and how quickly the ambitious mare would seize control of the countryside by installing her cronies in a new secular administration with the unwitting aid of the masses she led astray. Kiria needed the spiritual guidance of the Way of Fire, and only pious officials who governed with Concord's favor could keep Kiria together and free of sin and corruption. So rather than let Rising Sun try to sway more votes to her side with her honeyed words and treasonous tongue, Winter decided to take a gamble and force a vote now, even if she didn't know for sure how much of the RaHP was likely to defect to Rising's side."

kirin_loyalists.24.d:0 "Fern Flare watched in alarm as the Rising Fire planted a bomb in the Morning Secretariat and lit a match. Not a literal bomb and match, of course, but it might as well have been one. She knew Rising Sun was ambitious, but what she was proposing threatened to completely destroy the tense cooperation between the Rising Fire and the Way of Fire that Kiria needed to survive the ambitions of Fickle Current and his allies in Fragrance.\n\nIt all centered around a motion innocuously titled Motion No. 43. In it, Rising Sun issued a direct challenge to the primacy of the Circle of Serene Tendency in the Realm of Kiria by pushing to install a Rising Fire mystic as one of Matriarch Superior Rain Shine's spiritual advisors. To anycreature unfamiliar with Kiria and the Way of Fire, such a proposition would seem harmless, but the motion itself was practically blasphemy in the eyes of High Priestess Winter Frost and the hardliners who rallied around her. Historically, the Matriarch Superior always kept four spiritual advisors close at hoof, one for each part of her Realm: Greater Providence, the Vermilion Realm, the Western Mellifluve, and Zaikiria. These advisors lived with her in the Vermilion Palace and always had her ear when few other kirin in the entire Realm did, and all four had traditionally been selected from the Circle of Serene Tendency, the ultimate religious authority of the Way of Fire through which all the temples in the Realm subordinated themselves to. But the Rising Fire had displaced the Circle's primacy in the west, and Rising Sun sought to capitalize on that by replacing the advisor of the Western Mellifluve with one of her choice, and thus break the Circle's monopoly on the Matriarch's ear. It would be a recognition from the Matriarch of the legitimacy of the Rising Fire, and in a theocracy like Kiria, Fern Flare wondered whether the Realm could survive such a controversy.\n\nBut Fern Flare knew that her party would be the deciding vote in the deadlock between the Way of Fire and the Rising Fire, between Winter Frost and Rising Sun, and she decided to push for a vote before somekirin turned nirik in the Morning Secretariat. She just needed to decide on which direction she wanted to whip her party's votes: support the primacy of the Circle of the Serene Tendency and preserve its privileges at the expense of Rising Sun's support, or allow the Rising Fire to have their voice in the Matriarch's ear and keep them happy at the risk of destabilizing the realm and national unity in the long run?"

kirin_loyalists.25.d:0 "Dayspring Rose felt honored to be in attendance during the most recent round of debates in the Morning Secretariat, but she was starting to feel that politics were not her forte. The Secretariat was locked in debate over industrialization plans to combat the equipment and material advantage of Fragrance and the deep pockets of its wealthy patrons, and what Dayspring felt should have been a simple matter had dragged on for days as kirin bickered back and forth over the where and what of the matter.\n\nFrowning, she turned aside to Kindling Flash, who sat next to her in the gallery. "Why is this taking so long?" she asked him. "Priestess Sun already proposed concentrating armories and munitions factories around Chrysanthemum. It has the workforce and is far from Fragrance's reach. It makes perfect sense. So why are the rest of them so greatly opposed to it?"\n\n"Think of the big picture," Flash replied, and he gestured across the aisle to where Winter Frost and her allies sat with stern frowns on their muzzles as they listened to a young Rising Fire acolyte address the Secretariat. "Priestess Frost wants to focus instead on non-military manufacturing around Aureolin. Why is that? The answer she gives the Secretariat is that when the war is over, armories and munitions factories would be ill-suited for industrializing and modernizing the poor and rural west. Civilian jobs would suit that much better. And she's right. But there's a far more obvious reason, though of course, nokirin will say it."\n\nDayspring blinked, frowned, and then cocked her head. "She doesn't want the west to have military industry. But why? Are we not allies against the foreigners in this war?"\n\n"Allies of necessity, Rose," Flash corrected her with a small shake of his head. "We needed to join forces to repulse the NAKP and their corruption and greed. But this war has not brought the Way of Fire and the Rising Fire closer toward reconciliation. Today's ally may be tomorrow's enemy, and it is best to not arm a kirin you do not trust and then turn your back on her."\n\nDayspring nodded in sullen understanding, and on the Secretariat floor, somekirin motioned for a vote to end the debate. It passed only by the slimmest of margins, and then it came time to settle the matter decisively."

Between them sat a mound of papers and photos that made Autumn's stomach churn.\n\nThe documents spoke of severe, heavy-hoofed measures, all emitting from one source: senior RaHP delegate Effusive Extract. His overriding of locally elected leaders, though, bore little trace of personal enrichment. The villages in his jurisdiction found themselves put under lockdown and martial law. Shops, schools, and businesses were seized and converted into temporary housing for soldiers travelling to and from the front. Armed checkpoints screened every kirin coming in or out; inside the villages, price ceilings kept food cheap, and local farmers destitute.\n\nGuards monitored daily chatter among the residents for possible code words and hidden enemy comms. Public meetings were outlawed. Suspected collaborators and petty criminals alike were dealt with summarily. The Rising Sun and the NAKP, Effusive alleged, might've infiltrated the Realm so thoroughly as to justify such measures. The rear area had to be kept secure, he said, so that the efforts of the Matriarch's loyal generals at the front would not be undermined.\n\n"This has bad written all over it!" cried Autumn. "We have to stop him, like, now! He's as harsh as the Rising Fire say we are!"\n\nFern let her friend simmer down before speaking. "Us intervening might not be for the best. Some of the RaHP in the know... they think we have to fight fire with fire. Something about Rising and Fickle not playing fair—"\n\n"So what, we'll ignore all this, sweep this under the rug, stoop to their level?"\n\nA notable point, one that was hot-headed and brash, still burning with the idealism that made Fern, and so many others, believe in Autumn's vision for Kiria.

"Many of the RaHP's cadres have gone off to fight in the war, meaning that local affairs are being managed by caretaker administrations," Fern began, "but that can't be the whole picture. Lemon Balm, anything to corroborate that?"\n\nA few folders flipped opened in Balm's magic, flicking through to the relevant pages. "The Serene Tendency are doing the party's duty."\n\nFern blinked.

No one sees them around anymore, but your local priestess at the temple knows you, knows your neighbour, knows your friends, and they all know her."\n\nPlacid smiles danced on every mystic's muzzle in those images, the tip of an unnerving iceberg. "What about the elected mayors and ministers who aren't called to war?"\n\n"Good leadership isn't worth much when there's nokirin around to carry out your orders," Balm replied.

The NAKP weren't so popular with the peasants they'd forced off the land and into the sweatshops. Raids on refugee camps by the banks of the Carmine River sometimes spilled over onto Vermilion's side of the border. Way of Fire mystics routinely visited these camps to render aid unto the needy, sharing with them the light of Concord's love—and Rain Shine's benevolence. An unprovoked attack during one such routine visit would provide sufficient justification for escalation. All they'd need were some corpses dressed in northern uniforms, and a hoofful of dead peasants, give or take a few dozen.\n\nIt would be bloody, though, and costly. The war should've been enough.

kirin_loyalists.285.d:0 ""No more will we be shackled to the fate of our lesser sibling!" Fickle had once declared from magnificent Fragrance when [Root.GetNameDef] broke with Vermilion. He and his colleagues had the industrial firepower of the outside world at their hooves: the modern era seemed ripe for the taking.\n\nThat was eons ago, exemplified by the latest missive from the Realm to his office. That "lesser sibling" crushed the heretics, brought them to heel. Against his expectations, the Realm stood tall, invigorated by a renewed spiritual unity, then set their eyes northward.\n\nA short request: The Viceroyalty shall be re-integrated into the Realm, now that the emergency was over.\n\nThe heady high of independence dissipated. Saying yes would be the epitome of betrayal: the NAKP would call for his head, unable to do anything else before the Realm's surprisingly reborn might. In his emotional depths, perhaps returning to Kiria might've been his first mistake, an ambitious project sabotaged by a horde of bad-faith dealers. Griffonia, at least, had been receptive to basic business practices.\n\nAnd it was a peaceful alternative to saying no, which would put on his books the highest expense: kirin lives. The Viceroy refusing his master was to cast a great offence upon the Realm, an offence whose sole method of payment was bullets and blood. Every enterprise would be oriented towards the war: stocks would plummet, any semblance of security gone. They might win and gain a greatly multiplied return on investment, or lose and forfeit all things.\n\nA knock rang on his door. "Chairkirin, Acting Premier Fern has arrived in the city. What should we telegraph her?""
kirin_loyalists.285.a:0 ""Tell her we accept. Arrange a safe exit for me, Cypress, and the others.""

A pair of guards blocked off the door of a roaring nirik ranting about plummeting stocks.\n\nShe was swept into the Viceroy's office. Across the table, Cypress Snow stood beside a haggard Fickle and his dishevelled tie. A pile of scattered documents pretended to be orderly. "You don't look good," Fern asked.\n\n"A long night," he said. "It isn't over. We have many details to hash out." Pages floated in his magic to Fern's side, important sections underlined. "The only major concession we ask of you is that you safeguard me and my group until we're out of Kirian waters." Fern flipped through the papers. It was as Fickle's telegraph said: a peaceful hoof-over of [KIS.GetNameDef] to [Root.GetNameDef], with a list of NAKP officials paid to co-operate with the Realm as "economic consultants". The diaspora's corporations would continue operations provided they follow the Realm's business codes.\n\nThe hoof-over was easy. Dangerously easy. "I figured some resistance, Fickle, but we're having this for almost nothing. Why?"\n\nFickle stopped fixing his tie. "I know when a venture is too unstable to invest in. After you vanquished the heretics, it was only a matter of time until you came to collect. Fighting you would've been costly, and I did not come here to kill. As for negotiations, we tried, but our secession should've told you how those went. It's not worth it here. I, Cypress, and several others will leave for greener pastures. Maybe we'll both have greater fortunes to negotiate with down the line, but now..."

The Realm had already killed many of Concord's spiritually misguided; eradicating a great number of Her foreign-born sons and daughters...\n\nHer sedan sped to 88 Chrysanthemum Plaza, the nerve centre of the NAKP (the rest of her motorcade barely kept up). An audience with the Viceroy was demanded, so he stepped out the front doors, flanked by his personal guard. "Viceroy," Fern began, "your response has been rather... surprising." Formal decorum burdened her excessively, so Fern Flare—the mare herself, not the Acting Premier—dropped the pretence: "Fickle, after all the fighting down west, you've done this? I... you know what the Realm has to do just to not lose face."\n\n"As I recall," Fickle said, "we agreed upon this arrangement to maintain a level of autonomy for the north, the perfect balance between independence and submission, if you will. Vermilion's latest request disturbs that balance outrageously. By going back on its word, the Realm has lost enough of that face." He shook his head, filled with shame (feigned or not, Fern did not know). "Perhaps it was not balance you wanted but time, just enough time for the fires to cool down so we would forget why the north abandoned you."\n\nHe extended a hoof for a shake.

Had to get a map of local holy sites and all! Shouldn't be surprised to see you here! I just wanted to catch up before the Secretariat."\n\nWith care, the surprised Winter opened her eyes. "Forgive me for lacking your enthusiasm when so many of Concord's flames have been extinguished."\n\n"Oh, right." Autumn bowed halfway to respect the dead. Then, she slumped hard against a pillar, "They shouldn't have gone... no, I just want to fix this, fix what I've done.

Everykirin... the suffering! All because I misjudged... "\n\nThe grass outside swayed in a breeze. "I do not envy your position, Autumn. Your Grand Gallop Onward was imperfect, but that does not mean we should've not galloped. When Concord sees us fall, She guides us back up. We have seen Kiria fall first-hoof by the transgressions of pride and impatience, yet we are miraculously preserved." Winter half-turned from her intruding guest. "Consider the days before the Secretariat a moment of reflection. Reconsider your Gallop. Think on what kirin want after an age of death. Then, we shall meet again with blood-bought wisdom."\n\nAutumn could only nod. "Thank you for that. I mean it." When she scurried away, however, Winter's smile dissipated."

The list of topics this time evidenced discussions on reconstruction efforts and benefits for the families of fallen soldiers.\n\nThe door to her office opened with a fumble. "So, Autumn, do you still remember the morning meetings they have in the Vermilion Palace?" Fern asked, closing the door just as clumsily.\n\n"Oh, motivational stuff, exercises and rituals, the actual meeting... basically non-delegates across the parties talking about what to do next." She looked Fern straight in the eyes. With a knowing grin, "You attended one of them, didn't you? It's a super secret conspiracy group, right?" she joked.\n\n"...maybe?" Fern replied. That got Autumn standing from her chair. "Usually, it's just the party functionaries, but Winter Frost was there, and so were a few of the RaHP senior delegates." Checking Autumn's surprise, she continued, "I know it's inter-party, but this is unheard of for a housekeeping meeting."\n\n"I'm probably the last person who should say this," Autumn interrupted, "but we have to cool it. Winter Frost's been helpful even though we disagree a lot, and it's not like meeting with the Serene Tendency is a crime or anything. With the NAKP gone, we should be co-operating with Winter. Gotta hoof it to those who attended, though; they've got more initiative than me."\n\nFern sighed, just now taking the seat across the table.

"To begin the reconstruction of Kiria, we must first examine the reason for its ruin. The well-intentioned Grand Gallop Onward has seen Kiria bathed in a sea of blood, bereaving a generation of its mothers and daughters. Premier, if I may, you are a mare gifted with an incomparable passion... but through it, we've galloped with little caution. We've neglected to find peace with our neighbour, instead scorching them in our lethal hubris. Which is why, with all the respect you deserve, dear Autumn Blaze, I am compelled to raise a motion of no confidence against you. Those in favour, raise your hooves."\n\nA bevy of hooves rose, blocking Autumn's vision from the bullish crowd. The temperature in the chamber seemed to plummet to the single digits. "No, no!" she could hear Fern scream, the ends of her mane aflicker with flame. "You can't just turn on Autumn like that! She's done so much for all of us! Wh-what about harmony and democracy? N-no, Bitter Root? You, too!?"\n\nThe accused RaHP delegate stood up just as Winter demanded the assembly to behave. "Dear Autumn," he began as silence seeped back into the Secretariat, "the High Priestess is right, not to mention that our party had to be constrained from democracy to stay afloat during the war. How could we say we're for the rights and self-determination of every kirin when we forced the Realm's will upon them?"\n\nThe aghast Autumn bowed without reply, taking her leave with the retreating remnants of the party that should've cared.

Whole minutes elapsed, each a pregnant burden on Autumn's withers. "I've observed what I've observed; I've said what I've said. I cannot overturn a democratic vote—"\n\n"Why was I so blinded!?" howled an inconsolable Autumn. "Was I really so self-absorbed, so caught up in the Grand Gallop Onward, that I thought everything was sunshine and rainbows while Kiria lay dying because of me? Because of me, we burned each other's tinder, we dowsed ourselves out, we—"\n\nA hoof graced her scales, only that of the Matriarch. "It is not your fault, Autumn. Please know that burning in you is a flame that cannot, should not be quenched. Your presence and work here are indisputable proof of that. Though you must leave for political reasons, know this, too: in my heart, you'll always be the Premier that cared. It is up to me to work with Winter Frost, but you... let Concord guide you to a better path."\n\nFurther talk was pointless. Autumn escorted herself out of the throne room. The night eked its way into the open-air courtyard, barren save for stoic guards and a waiting Fern Flare. "We can still bring the fight to the Priestess," she murmured as she matched Autumn's morose pace. "We may have lost Rain Shine's trust, but a big chunk of the RaHP are still on our side. Most of the rank and file are still loyal. That's hundreds of functionaries across the Realm, at least. We even have General Bright Burn who sympathises with—"\n\n"What's the point?"\n\nAutumn's question crawled out of her muzzle. In a forced amble, she left a stunned Fern.

Make this clear in the loc.
kirin_loyalists.34.d:0 "Twelve Magistracies. Twelve chairs to helm the Radiant Hierocracy. A list before Winter ran down every qualified mystic for these twelve positions:\n\nThe bottom nine sat, in three triumvirates of equal standing, as the Mystics Militarch, Literarch, and Burearch, each imbued with sanctity. The Militarchs would lead the crackdown on enemies and traitors, both foreign devils and local heretics; the Literarchs would oversee research centres under the rigorous doctrine of both the scientific method and The Way of Fire; and the Burearchs would commit to paperwork in the shadows, serving as mediators for both government and Concord.\n\nAbove these nine hovered the two Priestesses Seneschal, responsible over the national-level housekeeping duties of The Way, such as the initiation of senior priests and dividing the budget of the Hierocracy across the Realm accordingly.\n\nReigning over them was the First Priestess herself, the undisputed head of The Way, second only to the Matriarch Superior herself in the discovery and recording of Concord's will. She would live adjacent to Rain Shine and consult her, along with chosen texts, to guide the faithful deep into this strange new millennium.\n\nWinter neared the end of her deliberations. The mystics on her list would comply with her every word as the Imperial Premier, even the new First Priestess herself. There was a certain sweet irony to how it was under Winter Frost that the Hierocracy and First Priestess were, finally, technically, subordinated to the Imperial Premier — albeit not in the way the Autumnal advocates of state supremacy over the Way had envisaged. But many kirin yet unreached were at the mercy of Autumn's misguided secularists and whoever else lay in sinister waiting. Seeding the Realm with the words of Concord through Winter's chosen would be the first move in reclaiming Kiria for Concord."

Letters from her higher-ups joined in the charade, referring to Rising Sun only as "the leader of the western heresy".

A double-digit number of Banners held together by a mishmash of blades and machine guns, missing armour pieces, and faces that outed them as conscripts just to fluff up a Banner's numbers during the very civil war that stripped the Banners of whatever scrap of dignity Autumn hadn't touched.\n\nWinter scowled (she was too far away for the soldiers below to notice) before returning to her speech, amplified by a microphone. "Of the Thousand that served before the Matriarch's reign, you are the few that have remained steadfast. See this not, however, as a sign that you are obsolete. Instead, see it as Concord weeding out those lacking in bravery and loyalty."\n\nWith a wave of her hoof, another group of soldiers stepped forward, thinly surrounding the Banners.

The privileges that have been given to your forebears for the ultimate sacrifice you can give to Concord shall remain, but the Brocade Commissaries—" she paused to gesture at the ring of non-Banner warriors, standing with neutral glares "—shall test you daily: in mind, strength, and spirit, so that even without an external foe, you can stay sharp in fighting your darker selves.

Unlike the Banner, whose modus operandi was flushing out already organised groups, the Commissaries eradicated dissidence before it could organise at all. Region-wide inspections weeded out individual kirin of interest, usually Bannerkirin with uncertain loyalties but also inclusive of civilians who talked too much.\n\nRain Shine had shown no warmth towards the Commissaries. And who could blame her? The reports implied kidnappings, interrogations — weaponizing the chilling effect upon their suspects. The Covered Cage fought for the Silence; the Commissaries silenced so it never had to fight. Usually.\n\nThe Premier looked up, seeing the two guests that had watched her read. Veiled by robes and armour in all but their faces, Wild Fire and Water Lily now served as the Commissaries' co-Commanders. Their eyes latched onto Winter and the seal she held in her magic. The last papers displayed their names and their confirmation into the Magistracy.\n\nThe Covered Cage, like all Banners, also sought to perpetuate its own legacy and lineage. The Commissaries, patrolling in the shadows, had neither: only loyalty to Concord and Realm.

She, too, would face the sun. Her body was lean, frail skin stretched over bones. She spoke little. What he could tell was... young, ardent devotee to Autumn and her promises, though that was long ago. The mystics of the mare's village said no to her "Equestrian" suggestions. Her last resort for true harmony: a personal hunger strike. The last she remembered, she'd worked up a crowd. Which must've been when the shadows noticed.\n\nHoofsteps heralded a crew of photographers, chefs, and guards. Robes and metal plates of black robed their chief, who nodded silently at the mare.

A stage had been set in the centre, slightly bloodied, along with tables set aside for strategising. As if out of the ether, Winter Frost appeared, ready to facilitate the proceedings.

For the next twelve hours, you shall spar with Concord's most gifted in their respective fields, and you shall alternate between physical and mental battles at set intervals."\n\n"Oh, so like chessboxing?" Fern quipped.\n\nWinter cringed at the mention of alleged foreign influence. She let it slide. "A close analogy, but this is no mere competition. You shall be tested to the limits Concord has given you, for as members of the Magistracy, you will answer to the needs of each and every one of Her children, and the management of the Realm is a duty that is never free from that responsibility.

On cue, Winter and Bitter were told to stand in the middle and begin their addresses about the unity that the Memorandum would exalt and uphold in law. Said Memorandum, negotiated between the Tendency and the RaHP, would put the Vermilion's civil service in submission to the Radiant Hierocracy, reaffirming the Realm as a true theocracy where faith was the true sign of government service.\n\nWhen Bitter finished his speech, it was Winter's turn. She stepped up to the podium and looked at the dear children of Concord that comprised the audience. Fancy three-piece suits mixed with priestly garments, she had expected. Only now, she saw that the venue had become standing room only, brimming with kirin of more ordinary clothes. Farmers, miners, fisherkirin... their eyes pleaded for her to finally give them rest: rest from war, from the slaughter of their families, a slaughter the world had shoved onto them by hedonism and heresy.

The Matriarchate, whose executive and legislative authority had been slowly eroded in favour of the Morning Secretariat and the All-Kiria Plenum during the Autumnal Premiership, was restored to its formal position of absolutist power over all aspects of the Kirian state and society. The democratic and secular organs established to manage the Grand Gallop Onward were superseded by the Serene Tendency's Radiant Hierocracy, which assumed responsibility for the governance of the Realm on behalf of the Matriarch Superior. The Vermilion state bureaucracy, which had underwent partial modernising reforms under Autumn Blaze, became wholly subordinated to the Hierocracy as the functionaries who carried out its orders on the provincial and local level. The Realm and Harmony Party, a former political powerhouse which lost much of its popular support after the civil war, would become a junior member of the Serene Tendency's ruling coalition. The Thousand Banners were too restored to their pre-Silence role and status as the professional military caste of the Realm, though under the strict supervision of the Hierocracy. The wealth, priviledges and power of the Kirian merchant class and mercantile interests were severely curtailed through measures hearkening back to the repressive decrees of the Silence. Finally, maintaining the integrity of the hierarchy were the Brocade Commissaries – the secret police pledged to the Matriarchate but controlled by the Hierocracy – who kept the bureaucracy, the military and the commonkirin under close and constant surveillance.§!\n— Echoes of Silence: the Rise and Fall of the Autumnal Premiership"

The method of execution for the elder matriarchs and patriarchs of the condemned lineages was crucible-drowning: each stuffed into an enclosed, air-tight iron-cast crucible atop a burning pyre, where sea water would be pumped in until the fire of life was drowned in boiling brine.\n\nHis faithful maidservant had been leading him out under smouldering arches and burning trees, her knowledge of the area vaster than her master's.

He could barely be heard across the courtyard and its attendees.\n\nPriestess Brazier Cast, the event's host, needed only to recite a list of the criminal's misdeeds: high treason through malicious compliance and lack of active obedience to the Hierocracy in ensuring harmony within his own party. The rest of the no-name's partners had not fared better, having been shunted into a dozen high-security prisons across the Realm along with the survivors of the New Standard Army. The party's juniors, scattered everywhere in Kiria, had had their names and identities posted in as many public places as possible to be caught or, failing that, to be shamed to the extreme of suicide. Conservative and liberal alike would be condemned for their complicity in Bright Burn's attempt at another war, another massacre in the name of "liberty". Another generation enlisted to kill each other at the altar of "democracy"? No more.\n\nThe mystics, soldiers, and priestesses who were watching remained quiet for the duration of his death. They weren't the bloodthirsty NSA who revelled in the shower of murders if it meant the absolute anarchy of unlimited freedom: they were exhausted. With this stallion's passing, the RaHP would be formally dissolved, and with that, the last bastion of disharmony.\n\nThe noises stopped. Only then could they relax, all relieved."

The plan was to kill her before a plane made from scraps and stolen plans firebombed the Banner's nerve centre — to be done in secret, to be then revealed to every kirin as a powerful blow against Winter Frost. The rattle of gun shots from his Massicot comrades signalled a back-up plan: stall for time then leave before the heavenly inferno fell.\n\n"Fly to position and drop, Capsaicin, and land far from here," Cayenne ordered. He crunched the device under his hooves. Any plea Capsaicin Spray, the fire plane's pilot, could've delivered... wouldn't be. Cayenne feared any chance for second thoughts.\n\nSmoke had fogged the ground floor; the flash of bullets lit the way forward. Every sordid face that worked here had done so without backing out: by brush or baton, they erased the existence of entire villages and organisations, where rumours yielded the truths of torture. Up to now, they refused to yield: the dozen bodies of Cayenne's squad lay sprawled in the foyer. A stillborn invasion.\n\nEverything grabbed him—pinned to the metal floor. Teeth grit; they bled. Calm eyes and a muzzle and a blade greeted him over the whine of rotors, of engines, of death from above.\n\nCayenne's own eyes widened. "To kill" was hastily replaced by "don't be killed". All he needed was the gift of flight to escape.\n\nThe telltale whoosh of a rocket launcher sank his heart long before the plane's descending, exploding, burning wreckage sank him dozens of metres under the ruins."

Lanterns had turned the city into an explosion of light that the grand sea reflected like floating pearls.\n\nThe papers to set the Open Coastal City up — with its own legislative assembly and constitution along with plenty of benefits for NSA and RaHP "immigrants" — had been signed fast. Suspiciously fast for Bright Burn: the "open" city was not a concession from the Tendency but containment. "Our little thing. For now."\n\nShe chuffed. Hid her agitation when passing NSA soldiers waved her and Bright by. "They've given us this. That's a start." Another war was not needed... hopefully not yet. "I still have faith in them, for compassionate reform."\n\n"So your answer's just 'sit here and wait'?"\n\nEither he was dense or he had run out of patience. "A free Hyacinth is important. The world will look to us as a haven of Kirian democracy, and they'll go here to skirt around Winter Frost's backwards rule. She'll then have no choice but to adopt some of our policies. Then... more kirin will be heard all over the Realm, and we can build on that."\n\nBright kept a smile for another squad of NSA soldiers passing by. His tone remained jaded. "We'll see.

kirin_loyalists.z1.d:0 "The fragrant flowers of the Matriarch Superior's Vermilion compound blossomed to the soundtrack of tweets and chimes, interrupted by the Hierocrats' discussion staining tea time at an open-air lunch under a pleasant noon, where Rain Shine caught sight of a stuffed barrel of letters being rolled into a shed, never to be seen again.\n\nSaid discussion had been on the topic of subject of farming implements. Agreement on what to do with them on the national level was unanimous. The specifics, however, birthed an hour-long verbal sparring; back-hoofed comments, pregnant with accimplications, allied with passive-aggressive suggestions, as if the Matriarch Herself wasn't there to bear witness to such duplicitous, maybe anti-harmonious, tendencies.\n\nThe bell rang, signalling lunch time, lunch break. A train of servants marched in perfect time with steaming hot spring rolls and tiny mountains of sweets and candies; more tea was also served. As was tradition, Rain Shine had her servings first, upon which the Hierocrats halted their subtle bickering, blessing Concord's Avatar with informal songs of praise.\n\nRain Shine kept quiet."

Chief among them is your cry against the foreign devils' mechanisms, of their spiked gears and their gas-guzzling wastes! In shackling ourselves to their inventions, we distrust the divine fire that is in us, that is more than sufficient to make fertile our fields, that spurs us into a grand Kirian voluntarism! 'How can we keep up with the rest of the world?' you may ask. The answer is by ourselves, by our participation into each other's lives. Though our most esteemed alchemists work without ceasing to enchant our soil and seeds as I speak, you are more than capable of providing them invaluable assistance by..."\n\nSo the enthusiastic messenger droned on, possessing no care for how the rest of the crowd reacted or would spin the news to their homes and towns. Even at its worst, he would be safe: the Brocades watched with bladed rifles and disarming smiles, not forgetting to remind those in attendance to acquire a copy of the final volume of Kiria's Definitive Annals, written by Rain Shine Herself who lay only a few walls away. To be within dozens of meters in her personal presence was an agonising holy ecstasy after the weeks-long tension of dirt-pathed pilgrimage. Each word from her representative's mouth was counted, weighed against the sluggish travels of the sun.\n\nGongs and flutes then whisked the messenger away. The Brocades commanded all to leave in an orderly fashion. Rain Shine would not be seen. It was not necessary: the spoken relay of her wisdom was itself a precious panacea."

Their fearful glares against the scroll, though, had her reconsider, had her lower her tone: "Alright, sleep early. We've got more to take care of tomorrow."\n\nSleep would take them quick. Not her. Just before she'd left for Vermilion, they argued over the rumours. Hiding the war's existence and all its arguing proved impossible, so despite the Matriarch's efforts, the foals still remembered, if only enough to hear about what and who festered beyond Kiria. They'd ask "Why?" until they'd grow up, grow discontented, then leave untested. They'd be brittle jars to be broken by strangers' diabolical designs. The confounded world floundered in the shadows of the uninitiated, experimenting with the foundation of the world without Concord's express permission.

So far, the questions he'd gotten from the border guards were simply enough to warrant memorised answers: his name, his rank, purpose of trip—\n\nPain spiked his head's back—down to the ground, tasted asphalt.

"And what will you do? Cause a diplomatic incident by arresting me? Detain a foreigner for no good reason and prove your point, huh!?"\n\n"Your democracy is in Hyacinth and shall spread no further!" the Bannerkirin stated as fact.\n\nRoast sized up the guard.

He'd thrown the Hierocracy off balance with the element of surprise, but that advantage would wither away when the false Premier, Winter Frost, recovered her bearings, and mobilised the Realm's vast armies against him.\n\n"How're things going?" Fern Flare, the kirin leading what was left of the true RaHP—the party of Autumn—approached Bright. "It's... bad, isn't it?"\n\n"We'll soldier on," he replied, pushing papers away with his telekinesis. "So many young volunteers signed up to defend Harmony in the war, but found themselves being ground to dust by the Hierocracy's machine afterwards. Now, we're what's left, the only voice of the denied and deprived. If only Autumn..."\n\n"She's done all she can, the poor mare." Having realised she never took a seat, she levitated the chair to Bright's side. She'd met him at least once before, standing side by side with a bushy-tailed Autumn, when the Grand Gallop Onward had just begun and a bright future for Kiria seemed just within reach. Yet today, here they were, with the burden of being Harmony's last defenders against Winter Frost and her new Silence having fallen on their withers. As leader of the mutiny, his hooves would soon be stained the loyal blood of tens of thousands of Kiria's finest on both sides of the new civil war.\n\nTheir eyes turned to a framed image of Autumn, the face of one many-times betrayed: by Winter Frost, by the RaHP, and ultimately, by the Matriarch herself.

The temple had been commandeered as a recruiting and training post, now overflowing with armaments, supplies, and fresh recruits. Above the entrance, a portrait of Autumn Blaze hung. This temple had been the fateful place where she had been educated—prepared for her historic endeavour to deliver kirinity from the Silence. Now, Autumn's followers prepared to fight to save what their leader had accomplished, from the reactionaries and mystics of Winter Frost's Hierocracy.\n\nA line of fresh, eager faces had shown up earlier this morning to enlist. Lunch came and went; the line had only grown longer. "There's just too many to process!" a clerk said to Bright Burn. "We might have to start turning kirin away."\n\n"Let them come," Bright Burn answered. They'd come after his proclamation on the radio, which he had found the time to make only after weeks of cobbling up a functioning government that wasn't just soldiers commandeering and requisitioning what they needed. Spotting a kirin beyond the line of recruiters, half-paralysed on a cot carried by her friends, he hastened to her. "Young mare, what's your name?"\n\n"She's called Gossamer, sir," cut in one of her carriers. "We told her she couldn't join because of her, er, 'condition', but—"\n\n"Ma'am, can you speak?"

After getting a nod and a simple yes from her, "Tell your friends to skip the line.

We northerners have hosted the world's ships in our harbours, even through the Silence.

Pledges of misguided loyalty to the traitors in Massicot, vitriolic denunciations of her Matriarch-ordained regime, songs and speeches filled with the vilest blasphemy imaginable...\n\n"The rot runs deep," she later told the Matriarch Superior in her quarters, illuminated by the dim glow of candles and slow-burning incense. "I had imagined that the untold scale of suffering we've borne witness to—suffering by our own hooves, no less—would've been enough divine retribution for the faithlessness of the Realm. Yet Concord has seen fit to test us once more."\n\nShe found herself pacing across the chamber, aware of the furious nirik bristling under her coat. It would be useless to try to reason with the revolting rabble, to attempt to appeal to their piety; Concord has already damned them to the immoral torture of their own seared natures. "Matriarch, there is no negotiating with a flood, no bargaining with a wildfire. You must denounce these wayward foals, paint them as traitors to Concord, the Matriarchate, and the Way. Everykirin must be made to decide who they stand with: Concord, or heresy."\n\nWinter could detect the turmoil in the Matriarch's eyes.

"If we just let Rising Sun and Fickle Current hold their own governments, they would've fallen under their heavy-hoofed regimes. Long before their authoritarian ways fell, their poor and trampled would've come back to us. It was a test of time we could've won."\n\nWinter raised a brow. "With this deal, the kirin will migrate to your lands, away from the 'overbearing' Matriarch Superior and Concord, expecting us to flounder in her trials. Thusly, you hope." After sizing up the general, "What else has stood the test of time than the Way of Fire? Concord's Way and the Matriarchs' intercessions have sustained us for as long as we've been united. By that test, should we not be wary of republics and revolutions? Turn to Griffonia to see their offspring succumb either to corruption or death. Shall you put your stake in those who fall short of Concord?"\n\n"They might've failed," he began, quelling his own anger, "but haven't you, too? The Hierocracy could not find adequate answers to the woes of the kirin, so what did they do? Sabotage the RaHP, slander Autumn and Fern, stuff the government with priestess and mystics... with such under-hoofed tactics, I'd say you cheated."\n\nFrost could only raise a brow before standing up.

From the balconies and eaves of the Palace, the Five Stripes were unfurled. The courtyards were awash with celebrating kirin from all walks of life—soldiers, workers, peasants, intellectuals, ordinary kirin enjoying their first day as citizens of the new Republic. Judging from radio reports, the scene was repeating itself in Fragrance, Massicot, Chrysanthemum...\n\n"It's done" Fern Flare murmured, wrapping her foreleg around Bright Burn's withers. Bright Burn made to respond, but suddenly, Fern Flare turned away. "Autumn?"\n\nLooking over his shoulder, Autumn trotted onto the balcony, her dark-rimmed eyes a window to the beaten soul within.

Rain Shine locked eyes with hers, only to find an ocean of agonising what-if's rumbling within. The hours of deliberation, of what to say to her, must've ground her idealism to dust. Still, she and harmony had won, if only in a roundabout way.\n\n"Dear Matriarch Superior," Fern Flare began, having memorised a prepared statement, "we love you most dearly. We've striven to love you to the same level with which you love us. Concord would not have chosen you, would not have let you thrive, had She not found you worthy. Yet, Winter Frost's master-class of a deception had tricked even you. We have failed in our duty to serve you, that we could not have stopped her from poisoning your heart...\n\n"But as much as we repent, we also realise that Winter Frost's designs could have only come about by the gross abuse of your position and influence over all Kiria. As long as you hold a spiritual-governmental role, another Winter Frost may deceive in your name, for such a role possesses too much power to not covet for. So, for the safety and sake of both you and your children, we ask that you step down as ruler... and that the Matriarch Superior shall hold sway only for the matters of The Way.""

Two foals had scampered outside, having heard the whirrs of trucks and other machines. "This is the first time they've seen these things?"\n\n"Yes," their mother replied, eating as well. "We've been waiting for help from above, from kirin like you." Her muzzle scrunched, worry staining its features. "What if it's not enough? What if we get displaced by the big groups?"\n\n"We'll help you, no matter what," Fern Flare said, "but if that fails, we've got other options open. Your kids can move into the city, worse comes to worst." After fielding a few more questions, "Don't worry. We'll be on your side. In fact... you can be a part of us."\n\n"A part of you?

kirin.110.t:0 "Her Radiance's Command"
kirin.110.d:0 ""If I did not greatly cherish and honor the loyalty that the Thousand Banners have shown to myself and my predecessors these long centuries," Matriarch Rain Shine began, "then there would be no need to reform them so that they could continue to faithfully serve the Realm in these changing times. The New Standard Army is not a replacement of the Banners, nor is it a slight against their valiance - it is simply the acknowledgement that war is changing, and even our finest warriors must change with it."\n\nTo ensure the loyalty of the bannerkirin, Matriarch Superior Rain Shine herself was delivering the proclamation of the reorganization of the armed forces into the Vermilion and Kirian Army. The Thousand Banners of Vermilion - many of whom were arrayed before her - are perhaps the most venerable institution in Kiria apart from the priesthood of the Way of Fire and the Matriarchate itself. From time immemorial, bannerkirin defended the Realm on all frontiers, from all threats, whether by land or sea. Be their enemies Zaikirian or Zeblu, raiders from Roam or colonists from furthest Feathisia - the Banners have ever held their own.\n\nBut a new Kiria in a new century needs a new army, one modern, flexible, rational, and efficient. Under this new model, the old Banners will be substantially reformed in their command structure, composition, and recruitment model, but will keep their heritage intact. These new reorganized Banners will form the core of the New Standard Army, around which more specialized and modern formations will be arranged.\n\n"To all those who have taken up arms, and lain down their lives, for Realm, Matriarch, and Constitution - know that the Vermilion and Kirian Army will honor its past as much as it looks to the future. And forever above Vermilion, your sacred Banners will fly." Rain could not help but feel that Autumn Blaze ought to have been the one delivering this speech. But when the potential for disgruntling the Realm's military was at stake, it was perhaps best to bring the most unimpeachable voice available."

kirin.111.d:0 ""Kirian artifice is not merely our catching-up with the world after the long pause of the Silence and the Quiesence," Matriarch Rain Shine said, standing on a dockside in Fragrance, "but also our chance to demonstrate the unique potential of Kiria's people and their magic." Behind her was a ship unlike any seen. Steel-hulled and armored, with powerful turrets and torpedo tubes - and sails. Painted in rich reds and midnight blacks, the vessel's three sails fluttered in the gentle breeze of the harbor, creating an enormous profile that some critics were already lambasting. But mere harbor breezes were not where this ship drew its power or its cunning.\n\n"The Atmospheric Displacement Propulsion Engine is just one of many examples of what we kirin can do when we set our talents to progress. Powered by this new technology, the Vermilion and Kirian Navy will have a ship that can sail faster and further than anything of its size, ensuring we can secure the waters of Zebrica from pirates and hostile powers alike." Rain Shine smiled as a naval cadet stepped up to the lecturn she was speaking on and offered her a bottle of fine rice wine, which she graciously accepted.\n\n"It is therefore my honor as Matriarch to hearken in a new era of Kirian progress, by christening this first ship of her class as Her Radiance's Ship Temerious Gale!" Levitated by the Matriarch's magic, the bottle of wine duly shattered and the crowd cheered."

The host affably introduced them as Sage Snoot, the Realm's premier scholar of geomancy and numerology, and Doctor Lucent Shine, an Equestrian-trained engineer of some renown.\n\n"So," began the host, "my understanding is that the newest and most innovative ship in the world is essentially the result of you two accidentally bumping into each other for coffee."\n\nSage chuckled, "I, well, that's, that's one way to put it - yes, we thought of the idea at a cafe. But really, it's the product of things we've been working on together for a while."\n\nLucent Shine spoke up next. "I mean, it's all very simple, isn't it? Wind is just air rushing to an area of lower pressure. Build a magical engine to create an area of low pressure yourself, put that engine on a sailing ship, and you can haul yourself around on your own breeze."\n\nSage's chuckle was more nervous this time. "Yes, well, actually designing that engine proved quite a trick, and we have our friends at Fragrance Enterprise to thank for their patience and their financial support, but... yes. Essentially, the ship can generate its own wind, using a magical engine mounted inside the bow."\n\nThe host gave an appreciative hum. "Well, I appreciate that you two don't want to boast, but really, this is being called one of the most impressive magitechnical breakthroughs of the century, anywhere in the world! Thousands of kirin have worked hard to make this idea a reality - it seems like it was a pretty good idea to me. And a good reminder for all those listening in at home that Kiria is only getting started on a new century of accomplishments!""

Once the pleasantries were out of the way, she got directly to business. No use wasting time with military mares.\n\n"You are probably the most famous bannermare in the Realm," Autumn began, and Firethorn immediately snorted.\n\n"Zenith Bloom is the most famous bannermare in the Realm," she said, and Autumn could only grimace.\n\n"I can't trust Zenith Bloom," she said, "but I know I can trust you. You've held the Scented Moonflower high through everything, you're everything the Banners were ever meant to stand for. Which is why I need your help making sure that their legacy never dies. A lot of kirin are worried about what the new military reforms mean for the Banners. I want you to be at the head of it, to prove that we're not throwing their legacy away, we're carrying it forward.

### Crisis Events ###

kirin_pirate.1.t:0 "Pirate Raids from the Auburn Isle"
kirin_pirate.1.d:0 "Autumn Blaze skimmed through the last report attached to the Imperial Census of the southern coastline before setting it aside. So far, she had read fifteen reports from Imperial administrators who had visited the coastal towns to take stock of the situation along Kiria's coastline, and each of them had been largely the same. Punctuating all the droll figures on population numbers, tax determination, and analysis of the local economy were reports of pirate attacks and raids. Autumn knew that there was a strong pirate presence in Auburn Isles, where an entire armada of pirates operated out of the port of Nacre, and she had been aware that they somewhat regularly raided the coastline for goods and bodies to press into service. But the caveat that bothered her in each of these reports was that they were apparently getting more frequent and destructive. What had once become an irregular occurrence for these towns was beginning to happen with a concerning amount of regularity. Pirate attacks were surely increasing and growing more organized, and the red sails of the pirate junks had even been spotted prowling off the coast of the Great Mellifluve river, searching for ships to prey on carrying goods out of the kirin heartlands. It was a bold move given the number of ships that ventured across those waters, and Autumn didn't like that one bit.\n\nFor now, the pirates were still only raiding small fishing villages and coastal towns, and staying clear of more populated and patrolled locales. But it couldn't be denied that the increasing occurrence of attacks and the wider range the pirates seemed to be patrolling was a bad omen for things to come. If the pirates were growing bolder, then it would only be a matter of time before they started attacking more lucrative targets. And with the realm still struggling to pull itself out of the stagnation and decay of The Silence, the last thing it needed right now was a series of pirate attacks destabilizing the coastal economy. Something would have to be done to stop the pirates before this problem spiraled out of control, or the consequences would be severe."

But now, pirate activity in the kirin seas has increased dramatically, and so have the attacks on foreign vessels. As the Realm of Kiria undergoes its breakneck modernisation following the ending of The Silence, the pirates of Auburn Isle have lashed out with a desperate frenzy of raids and attacks, seeming as if they seek to delay the inevitable by seizing as much loot as they possibly can. As the problem spirals out of control, it is becoming increasingly clear that the waters around the Realm of Kiria are dangerous, and any ships sailing around Eastern Zebrica should be well-prepared to fend off attacks until the situation is brought under control."

It was swiftly set upon by the pirates, and the captain of the submarine surrendered the vessel, where it was towed back to Nacre with the crew in chains. After pressuring the crew into repairing their submarine, the pirates have begun to employ it in surprise attacks on merchant ships and convoys that wander too close to Auburn Isle with terrifying effectiveness.

It was just her in her little boat today; her father was ill at home, recovering from a bout of the flu, so she had had to venture out alone that morning. Now, with the red sails of the pirate junks baring down on her, she wished she at least had the protection of the rest of the fishing fleet with her. Even if she unfurled her square sail and rowed as hard as she could, she knew there was no way she'd be able to outrun the pirates. Instead, she could only brace herself for the inevitable.\n\nAs the fleet approached, one ship broke off from the others to intercept her dinghy while the rest continued on in the direction of Teak. Jade could only gulp and look up at the hulking ship soon looming over her, its rails lined with hardened kirin grinning down at her. The pirates tossed a rope ladder over the side, and one wolf-whistled down at her. "Why don't you make this easy for us, little lady?" one of the pirates shouted down to her. "Save us the effort so we can catch up with the rest of the fleet."\n\nFrightened beyond belief, yet still harboring a spark of defiance, Jade grabbed her wooden harpoon in her magic and pointed it up at the pirates. "Leave me alone!" she shouted back. "P-Please! I-I don't have anything to give you!"\n\n"Is that so?" Before Jade could react, two pirates jumped down onto her boat, rocking it back and forth and nearly tossing her overboard. She jabbed at one with her harpoon, but the pirate deflected it with her sword while the other one clubbed Jade on the back of her head. The mare groaned and fell to the floor, her vision swimming as the two pirates loomed over her.\n\n"She's a pretty one, isn't she?" the stallion remarked to his companion. "I think I'll take her back to Nacre and make her my wife." Then he knelt down in front of Jade and lifted her chin with his hoof, blowing a little kiss at her when she managed to focus on his face. "Don't worry, you poor thing. I'll take good care of you back home. I'll shower you with treasures and we'll make sweet love under the moonlight. You won't want for anything ever again.

"Are we past Auburn Isle yet?" he asked, trying to trace the progress his navigator had plotted on the map. "There's rocky shoals and some coral around it that I'd rather we not crash into. Not to mention the pirates. If that storm hadn't turned us closer inland, I would have preferred giving that island a wide berth. Sycee doesn't pay us well enough to tangle with pirates."\n\n"We have marines to protect us, and they have modern guns," the navigator retorted. "At any rate, we should be almost around Auburn, if our instruments are correct. From there it should be smooth sailing to Verdant."\n\nCandlelight opened his mouth to reply, but the ship shook as something slammed into it from the side with a metallic clang. Shouts rang out through the fog, and Candlelight ran to the bridge windows to see kirin in salt-stained and mismatched garb jumping off of wooden vessels onto the deck from either side of his ship. Black powder weapons let out sharp reports with a flash of sparks, and as the first of the marines on deck fell in the ambush, the pirates snatched up their modern weapons and began firing on the rest. And every second, more and more jumped onto his ship...\n\nCandlelight's face paled. He knew the battle was over before it even began. The pirates must have followed his lantern through the fog, and with the wind on their side, they had glided in without making a sound. The ship and all of its goods were theirs, and he wasn't about to die to protect the Sycee Trading House's product.\n\nHe wasted no time in formally surrendering when the pirates stormed the bridge."

kirin_pirate.7.d:0 "Pond Frog looked up from the flooded rows of the rice paddie as the hulking junks sailed into the mouth of the Great Mellifluve, using the southerly winds to force themselves about two hundred meters upstream before lowering their red sails and dropping anchor. The ships arrived in three ranks, with the first and third lines turning their bows toward the shore and arranging their broadsides up and down the river, and the second rank oriented north and south with their guns trained on the shore. There they sat and there they waited, their red hulls practically glowing like fire in the morning sun as the blockade settled in.\n\nIt did not take them long to ensnare their first victim. A merchant ship sailing down the river was forced to turn to port and drop its anchor to pivot before reaching the blockade, but before it could open its sails and catch the wind to sail upriver again, longships launched from the junks rowed out to it and swarmed the ship. Within minutes, the crew was subdued and the captured ship was sailed into the protective embrace of the pirate blockade, where it was anchored until a treasure fleet could be amassed and sailed away to safety. As the hours rolled on, ship after ship fell into the same trap, with even ships sailing up the river from the South Kirin Sea to Verdant falling victim. By the end of the day, and by the time Pond Frog finally was ready to go home, the pirates had amassed seventeen ships in their protective bubble.\n\nThe farmer simply shook his head as he packed up his tools and waded out of the flooded fields. At least the pirates had more valuable prizes to keep them entertained than rice. To the merchants and their ships, the appearance of a blockade in the Great Mellifluve had likely been a horrific surprise. But to Pond Frog, it was nothing new. Kiria had been a broken and defunct country when his father was a foal, and his father's father before him. Nothing had changed, despite all that talk coming out of the capital.

"That smells horrific!" she shouted over the hiss and whistle of the steam engine behind them. "What crawled up Concord's divine rear and died?"\n\n"This is terrible," Autumn said, wincing as she made her way from the train station toward the river. Sickly kirin dotted the streets, leaning against the walls and grimacing, while others briskly trotted to where they needed to go, noses covered with cloth masks to keep out the stench as best they could. When the delegation from Vermilion arrived on the shores of the Great Mellifluve, they found them covered with dead and rotting fish, the once blue waters of Kiria's lifeblood a sickly green and black.

"Farmers are dumping fertilizer into their fields, and it's all running off with the rain. And the cities are exploding in population. They don't have anything near robust enough sewage systems to deal with all the waste. All of that is getting dumped into the river, and it all flows downstream to Verdant."\n\n"We have to step in and do something to stop this," Autumn decided. "We can't let these kirin languish like this. The pollution is killing them, and if we don't do something about it, it'll kill Verdant itself!""

kirin_crisis.2.t:0 "The End is Nigh!"
kirin_crisis.2.d:0 "Littlescale maneuvered her tiny dinghy through the many canals of Verdant, her pole clutched tightly in her magic as she pushed it against the canal floors. "River clams! River clams!" the filly yelled, rattling her bucket of clams with a hoof as she passed by countless kirin sailing up and down the canal with her. "Two for a tael! Five for two! Clams are clean and tasty, the pollution can't get in their shells!"\n\nShe finally reached the mouth of the canal and turned left, making her way toward the Coruscating Lagoon, Verdant's largest water market. Hundreds of little boats bobbed in the green and black waters filled with countless peddlers like her selling their wares to kirin that sailed past. But today, the calls and cries of peddlers were silent, and hundreds of kirin watched from their boats and the shorelines as a tall stallion in fiery red and orange robes stood on a barge in the middle of the lagoon. Curious, Littlescale pushed her dinghy closer to hear what he was saying.\n\n"Verdant has been abandoned by Vermilion!" the stallion said, and Littlescale recognized him as a priest of the Rising Fire sect that dominated Verdant. "We have been left to rot in filth and sewage. We languish in the waste that they pollute the lifeblood of Kiria with! Our children and elderly are stick and starving, and the air hangs heavy with the stench of death and disease! Our beautiful waters, once as blue as sapphires, are now black with acid! Who is to blame for this? It is the greed of the northerners and the vanity of the east! Vermilion drags us into a new age, an age of marvelous modernization, or so they say. But look at what their industrial revolution has done to our home! We suffer and die because they chase greed and power. Greed and power! The Plenum in Vermilion has abandoned Concord's teachings. They have forgotten Her tenets! And worse yet, they have poisoned the mind of our beloved Matriarch, forcing her to chase progress and growth over a harmonious relationship with nature. It must end!"\n\nThe crowd murmured its approval, but the priest was not finished yet. "If we allow the greed and corruption in Vermilion to fester, then Kiria will be ruined in a few short decades. They must be stopped, and the corrupt hedonism of the so-called priests and mystics of The Way of Fire must be put to an end. So I ask you, kirin of Verdant, will you stand with me and my brothers and sisters as we take back what is ours? Will you stand with us as we save our home from pestilence and plague? Will you stand with the Rising Fire against the depredations of fickle Vermilion?"\n\nHe was answered with applause and cheering, and even Littlescale clapped her hooves together. The Way of Fire had abandoned Verdant and all who lived in it. It was time to look for new guidance to save her home."

kirin_crisis.3.t:0 "The Great Typhoon"
kirin_crisis.3.d:0 "Rain Shine awoke that morning feeling refreshed and well-rested. Vermilion was draped in gray as the clouds above continued to rain on the city, with the occasional gust of wind rattling the foundations of her palace, but it did not bother her. She always slept better when it stormed outside, and she loved to sit in her morning room and read the teachings of Concord with a cup of ginseng and listen to the rain pitter-patter on the roof. But as she prepared to sequester herself away in the morning room, she turned first to a page for her morning briefing of the day's events.\n\n"It is bad news, your Divinity," the page said, bowing his head low. "Last night's storm was the dying gasp of the terrible typhoon that struck our east coast two days ago. We spent all day yesterday assessing the damage, there was simply so much destruction wrought along the coastline. The heavy rainfall and strong winds caused massive flooding, landslides, and widespread damage to buildings, farms, and infrastructure. We don't know how many kirin lost their lives, but we expect it to be at least five hundred. The coast needs aid immediately if we are to mitigate some of the damage."\n\nRain Shine was taken aback; even though she had made considerable effort to learn more of the affairs of the Realm she was supposed to rule since ending the Silence, sometimes she still felt like she was kept in her gilded cocoon, isolated from the world outside. "Then I shall send the aid the coast needs immediately," she declared. "I will write an official proclamation this morning. Is there anything that is already being done?"\n\n"The priests and mystics of The Way of Fire have organized donation and charity efforts to bring taels and food to the hardest hit regions, your Divinity. Fickle Current has also asked the members of the diaspora to donate funding toward rebuilding the region. If there is any silver lining to be found in this catastrophe, it is that their funding and involvement will help to modernize the coastline now that the land has been cleared by the storm."\n\n"The Way of Fire and the diaspora rarely get along," Rain Shine observed. She had at least learned enough through the Plenum to understand that much about her subjects. "If they do not learn to work together, I fear their efforts may hurt more than they help." She dismissed the page with a wave of her hoof. "See to it that Fickle Current and Winter Frost receive my direct instructions to coordinate their efforts. We cannot afford to let this crisis grow worse.""

kirin_crisis.4.t:0 "The Fire Rises where the Tide Recedes"
kirin_crisis.4.d:0 "It had been a long few weeks in Vermilion for Autumn Blaze. Ever since the Great Typhoon smashed into the eastern coast and left ruin and devastation all along the coastline, Vermilion and the Morning Secretariat had been thrown into turmoil. Securing funding and a disaster relief plan should have been an easy first step that everykirin could agree on, but when it came time to decide who should provide the money and where it should be directed, the Secretariat ground to a halt. Partisan fighting forced the bill to drag on and on, and while the Secretariat argued amongst themselves, the kirin living on the coast suffered in wait for help that was taking too long to arrive. It had taken Autumn bringing Rain Shine into the Secretariat and asking her to issue decrees to arbitrate on the relief plan that had finally started to get things moving, but it had been too little, too late. It seemed like every kirin in the capital soon started blaming the Plenum for the failure to aid with disaster relief, from the most conservative Way of Fire mystics to the most ardently nationalist diaspora returnees. Even farmers and laborers have started to speak out against the government, and it became increasingly clear to all the members of the Plenum that the kirin of the Realm blamed them for the suffering along the coast.\n\nBut that was not the end of the bad news. As Autumn looked through her day's reports, she found a report from an aide traveling the region and detailing the situation. In lieu of proper governmental support, the Rising Fire religious sect had taken it upon themselves to step in and provide aid to those hit hardest by the typhoon. While this was good for the kirin along the coast, it foretold disaster for the authority of Vermilion over the Realm, as the Rising Fire grew in strength and support in the east to bolster their stronghold over the realm in the west. The intervention by the Rising Fire has created a surge of popular grassroots support for their communalistic ideals at the expense of the Way of Fire and Matriarch Rain Shine's authority, who could soon find themselves squeezed by communalist heresy from both sides. And should the Way of Fire and the Rising Fire come to blows..."

kirin_crisis.5.t:0 "Kirian Venom"
kirin_crisis.5.d:0 "By the time Internal Affairs arrived at the scene of the crime, the constable and local militia had already started arranging the bodies by the rail tracks for identification. He frowned down at the twisted remains of the rails, warped and curled by an explosive blast. Two hundred meters away, the train that had been carrying passengers from Vermilion to Chrysanthemum lay on its side, its windows broken and its frame crumpled, the Trans-Kiria Rail insignia decorating its exterior pockmarked with bullet holes. Even this long after the attack, one of the wheels on the caboose still turned lazily beneath the afternoon sun, the momentum from the crash still whiling away on well-greased bearings.\n\nAffairs quickly located the constable and pulled him aside to get the details right from the kirin who likely knew best what was going on. "What happened here?" he asked him. "Those rails were blasted apart. Was it bandits?"\n\n"Absolutely," the constable said. "Their bodies were littered all around the train. They got enough gunpowder to blow the rails and derail the train, but they only had swords and scythes, while the guards had rifles. They paid dearly for what they stole."\n\n"And what did they steal?" Affairs asked.\n\n"Chrysanthemum was expecting Lady Zenith Bloom to arrive today," the constable said. "The NAKP had dispatched her to the city to establish a western branch of her party in Chrysanthemum, or so we had been told. She brought a lot of gold bullion with her, too. Somehow the bandits found that out and laid their ambush. Lots of kirin died here today." The constable shrugged. "There were no survivors from the train. We haven't found Lady Zenith's body yet, but we assume she's among the dead somewhere. At any rate, this seems like the last hurrah for those bandits. Not likely to be many of them left after they tried rushing riflekirin with swords."\n\nAffairs nodded and thanked the constable for his time before he left. He could only look at the carnage around the rails and shake his head. Was this one final act of glory for the bandits of the west? Kiria was changing so quickly and so drastically that even bandits had to know their time was coming soon. Perhaps it was one final statement from a dying breed of kirin, one final chapter to their story for the world to remember them by. So many things were changing these days that Kiria would need an epitaph for the old ways within a few years."

kirin_crisis.6.d:0 ""A messenger here to see you, Premier," Cinder Glow warned Autumn Blaze before the imperial messenger hurried into Autumn's office. Autumn looked up from her paperwork and opened her mouth to offer the messenger a greeting, only for the kirin in front of her to quickly toss a half-dozen scrolls down onto Autumn's desk before she could get a world out. "There is a famine in Peace-and-Plenty," the messenger said, bowing her head. "I didn't even need to read the messages to know what they were about. I saw it with my own eyes. The farms are failing and kirin are starving in the towns. Those letters almost certainly are asking for Vermilion's help in solving the famine."\n\nAutumn was taken aback, and it took her a few moments to find the words to respond. "Peace-and-Plenty is in a famine? How could that be? When Fickle Current proposed implementing new farming techniques there, he said they would be limited to the Sorghum Foundry's private farmland. How can the entire breadbasket of Kiria be starving?"\n\n"Sorghum owns more farmland in the area than you think," the messenger explained. "They officially only own 300 acres of farmland around the city limits, but they forced several thousand more acres of farmland owned by independent farmers into sharecropping after they helped to create and then bought up titles to the land in the name of the Matriarch with the help of the NAKP. The farmers own and work the land at Sorghum's leisure, and earlier this season Sorghum forced them all to adopt new planting practices if they wanted to keep the land."\n\nAutumn Blaze was shocked and taken aback. Of course, Current had neglected to mention that little detail when he proposed his new farming techniques. And now that they had all failed, they were taking down Peace-and-Plenty with them. How was Kiria supposed to feed its people if its most fertile and prosperous farmland had failed? If Peace-and-Plenty was struck by famine, Autumn could scarcely imagine how terrible things were about to become for the rest of Kiria. "I... thank you, messenger," she said, staring off into space above the mare's head. "Leave the notes and you are dismissed. I will... I'll try to find some way to deal with this all... somehow...""

kirin_crisis.7.d:0 "Coal Fire stood in the darkness of her bakery as the sounds of rioting and looting filled the streets outside. She couldn't see much past the boards she'd nailed over her windows and door, but she knew the mob was getting closer. Soon, they'd decide to turn their fury on her bakery, and all she had to defend herself with was a black powder pistol her grandfather owned. She was terrified at the thought she'd have to use it. She'd never killed anykirin before. Could she do it if her life was on the line?\n\nIt had been a scary few weeks in Fragrance, especially for bakers like herself. Grain supplies had collapsed with the famine in the countryside, and Coal didn't have enough flour to make bread for anykirin more than herself and her parents. Fragrance had started importing food to combat the growing crisis, but that had just made the prices on food staples rise dramatically. Just to make ends meet, Coal had had to raise the price on a loaf of bread from one tael to fifteen, and she'd already had to chase down a few colts who tried to steal from her when she wasn't looking. But despite all of that, Coal had hoped she'd be able to get through the tough times until Fragrance solved its food issues.\n\nThen Old Leatherscales died. Somekirin had beaten the amiable, grandfatherly bard to death on the street corner where he played the spike fiddle by day and slept by night, and looted his corpse of its valuables. A few days later, the authorities hanged a colt from a tree across the road from Old Leatherscales' corner - a street urchin from the countryside who they claimed was responsible for the murder. The response from the Fragrance's community of rural migrant workers, experiencing the brunt of the food shortage and scapegoated for the city's growing ills, had been explosive and furious. A mob quickly formed and started looting the granaries across the city, and once those were empty, turned their attention to the local bakeries. Until now, Coal's had been spared their attention, giving her time to prepare. But they were coming, and it wouldn't be long before they tried to steal what bread she had left.\n\nGlass shattered across the street, and Coal snatched the pistol in her magic, the weapon quivering in its red aura. Vermilion needed to do something to save Fragrance from itself. It had to. Only the Matriarch could stop the growing violence that was swallowing the city. And if they were fast enough, maybe they could save Coal and her family as well."

kirin_crisis.8.t:0 "Tea Time with the Divine"
kirin_crisis.8.d:0 "Autumn Blaze took another sip from her tea, watching as Rain Shine did the same across from her. It was funny how life was, sometimes. Here she was, sharing tea with the Matriarch Superior of Kiria, and making idle conversation as friends. She knew that the kirin sitting across from her was a divine being to which she should show respect and devotion, but she had grown so comfortable in the Matriarch's presence that she saw her as a friend she could speak freely with like any other kirin.\n\nOf course, given the situation of Kiria, the world of politics could not be escaped forever. "Fickle Current approached me with a request today," the Matriarch began. "He is growing concerned with a movement that calls themselves the Incendiaries. Have you heard of them? They have a substantial base among the peasant farmers, and they give them an outlet to channel their frustration against modernization into. The farmers fear losing their land for infrastructure and urban projects, and instead believe in land justice, collective ownership of the land, and a resurgence of religion in our way of life. They have even started attacking and damaging new projects that are being constructed, and the kirin building them."\n\n"I heard about the attack on the dam near Chrysanthemum and the granary fire at Cornsilk," Autumn said. "But truth be told, I have so much going on that I haven't been able to give it proper attention. I think I read that they're loosely affiliated with the Rising Fire; at the very least, they're certainly friendly enough with that sect of our religion. If they're being organized, that poses a big problem for us."\n\n"Even still... I am sympathetic to their plight," Rain Shine said. She sighed as she added, "I spent sixty years of my life isolated in Vermilion, oblivious to the suffering of my subjects. And now they are being thrust into a brave new world just as quickly as I have. They are scared and confused, and I don't want them to be hurt because they are afraid." After a moment's pause, she pursed her lips and looked away. "I want you to learn more about the situation and recommend a course of action, Premier. Find me a solution that is best for everykirin, and I will make it so.""

kirin_crisis.9.t:0 "An Incendiary Decision"
kirin_crisis.9.d:0 "Autumn Blaze bowed as a formality when Rain Shine's attendant led her into the Matriarch's reading room. Normally, such a greeting wasn't necessary between the two friends, but when other kirin were around, it wouldn't do to act disrespectfully to the country's divine Matriarch Superior. Autumn had at least learned enough about politics to realize a slip up as small as that would give her rivals an opening to try and take her down in the next gathering of the Plenum.\n\nBut when Rain Shine dismissed the attendant and the two kirin were all alone, Autumn smiled and joined Rain Shine by her side on the floor. "I've spent some time looking further into the Incendiaries matter," she said, and she placed a folder full of papers before the Matriarch. "And I mean, phew, those kirin are sure going crazy. They're not really a huge problem right now, but if we let it grow out of control, this incendiary situation is going to grow into an inferno. So the way I see it, you can either strongly condemn the Incendiaries and their movement, or express sympathy and ask them to cooperate so that we can actually get to the root of their problems and help them out."\n\n"I see," Rain Shine noted, but then she frowned. "And why would I not simply choose the sympathetic route? They still are my subjects, despite their lashing out."\n\n"Because... well frankly, Matriarch, there's a chance they won't listen to you," Autumn said, anxiously rubbing her hooves together. "You're our divine Matriarch Superior by all the rights and blessings of Concord, which means your word is Her will as well, and kirin should listen to you immediately. But the Incendiaries might be too mad at the state and the government to listen to you. And if kirin in the countryside are ignoring your divine voice, then that undermines your authority to a considerable degree." She sighed and shook her head. "As much as I hate to admit it, I think that the condemnation is a safer option. You can call upon all faithful kirin in the land to report on Incendiary activity and aid the authorities in cracking down on the movement. That way, you're appealing to kirin who already respect you, rather than those who don't. They'll listen to what you have to say, so you don't have to worry about losing face with them. But you're going to make the Incendiaries a LOT angrier if you condemn their movement." Then she bitterly chuckled and added, "Oh, forgive me if I say it, Rain Shine, but I am so glad I'm not our Matriarch Superior right now. I'm not the one who has to make the decree.""

kirin_crisis.10.d:0 ""The Plenum now gives the floor to Governor Amber Grain of the Auspicious Clouds province."\n\nAutumn Blaze watched as the governor made her way to the center of the Plenum's chamber to speak. The mare must have been in her late sixties, but she carried herself with a fire and brimstone air about her that made her seem imposing and youthful despite her age. And she wasted no time launching into the reason why she had requested this audience with the Plenum in the first place. "My province is in chaos and lawlessness!" she snapped, harsh eyes sweeping over the assembled delegates as if they were axes and the kirin were trees. "Bandits are emerging from the countryside to prey on our new flows of trade and commerce, which were dead for so long. They attack kirin on the roads in broad daylight, because they know nokirin will stop them! Where is the Vermilion Banner Army? Where are the soldiers? Things are too out of hoof for my constabulary to handle on its own. My province, as well as the rest of the western provinces, need direct action from the army, yesterday!"\n\n"The Grand Gallop Onward should be modernizing the countryside and providing kirin with better jobs and more opportunities than ever before," Fickle Current countered. "The only reason there would be a bandit problem would be because of a misuse of the funds and aid the Plenum has sent the provinces."\n\nAmber Grain scowled at him. "You were born wearing that suit, weren't you?" she snapped at him. "If you spent one single day of your life toiling in the fields or working in one of those deathtraps you call factories you'd understand why kirin are turning to banditry. All these companies buying up and reshuffling farmland is displacing farmers off of land their families have worked for generations, and half of them won't even go into the cities to work in factories when they see the maimed and mutilated begging for taels in the streets because they lost hooves or horns on the job. And the foremares there work their labor to the bone for little more than a tael an hour, with no protections and no rights. What else is a kirin without skills to do but turn to banditry? So until you fix that up, the West needs soldiers if we're going to deal with this bandit problem!""

kirin_crisis.11.d:0 "Autumn Blaze and Winter Frost watched side-by-side as five priests and priestesses of The Way of Fire led a procession of followers down to the banks of the Great Mellifluve outside of Vermilion. Singing, chanting, and simple music tapped out on a drum and chimes accompanied them down to the water's edge, where the assembled kirin waded out into the blue waters of Kiria's lifeblood. Autumn, for her part, was just happy to see the clear blue of the water return once again. The poison in the rivers was receding, and Verdant had already made great strides in recovering downstream. It was something the Plenum and the Morning Secretariat could be proud of, at least. Well, maybe not Fickle Current and his cronies, but the rest of the Kiria...\n\n"It's still not as clear as I remember it," Winter Frost solemnly noted, her eyes wandering away from the ceremony and toward the deepest blue of the river. "There's still poison in our lifeblood. Just less of it."\n\n"Completely eliminating pollution was an impossible order," Autumn explained. "We would have to cease our modernization completely. You know we can't do that. Kiria needs this modernization to rejoin the world. But we could at least limit how much factories could dump into the river, and force them to explore other means of dealing with their waste." She hesitated before adding, "Thank you for convincing the mystics of The Way of Fire to support our efforts. We wouldn't have been able to do it without them."\n\n"The sixth tenet of The Way of Fire says we must live in peace and harmony with nature," the priestess said. "This is not harmony, but perhaps it is peace. If the future children of Kiria can benefit from what we do today, then I will sleep easier for having my mystics find compromise outside of Concord's divine wisdom."\n\nAs the chanting in the water came to a close, two of the priests waded back to the shoreline and set fire to the fuses protruding from a rack of fireworks. One after the other, the fireworks shot into the air with colorful sparks and briefly dazzling displays of light. Winter Frost bowed her head at the display of thanks to Concord, and Autumn did the same after a moment. It was the perfect end to a peaceful day, and Autumn was thankful that she and Winter could share it in friendly company instead of as bitter rivals on the Plenum floor."

Where the town had almost been completely destroyed by the Great Typhoon slamming into Kiria's east coast, all of the nation had come together to help rebuild the coastline. Where there was once destruction and desolation, peace and prosperity had taken its place. And now, with the reconstruction efforts complete, the townsfolk of Radiance had taken it upon themselves to thank those who had saved them with a feast for the scores of volunteers who rebuilt their town.\n\nIt was the same throughout much of the east coast, Rain Shine noted as she strode into the town as the surprise guest of honor. Kirin were happy to see her, and the glee and relief in their faces led her to softly smile back at them. Recovering from the typhoon had been a group effort, with kirin from all trots of life working together. Soldiers, bureaucrats, returnees, mystics, peasants, and even NAKP cadres and local Rising Fire leaders had all contributed to rebuilding the coastline. It was what Rain Shine had wanted to see from her subjects as Kiria embarked on the Grand Gallop Onward, and what she saw here today instilled confidence that her efforts were not for naught. If the cooperation and prosperity in Radiance was a barometer for the Realm as a whole, then obviously the kirin people were doing something right.\n\nThat pleased Rain Shine more than any amount of respect or devotion her subjects gave her."

kirin_crisis.13.d:0 "It had started with a single cart rumbling down the dirt road to Fragrance. That cart, pulled by an elder kirin who had seen dozens of seasons come and go, had been loaded to the brim with as much wheat as it could hold. And when he arrived in famine-stricken Fragrance, he merely unhitched himself from the cart and wandered off, only returning to the cart once it was empty to take it back to his farm. Day in and day out, the elder kirin would make the trip to the city, giving away his one cartful of wheat to anykirin who needed it. He became a hero to the local kirin, and when his cart broke a wheel on the journey into town, the smith made him a new one for free as a sign of thanks.\n\nIt wasn't long before the story of this humble farmer spread throughout the countryside. Shortly after, where before there was one cart, soon there were two, then five, then ten. More and more farmers gathered up everything they could spare and began making the journey to Fragrance, delivering it to kirin in need for free. Within a month, the same started happening in other hungry cities in the realm. The poor peasant farmers with barely enough land to feed their families started to solve a crisis that the NAKP and the large consortium farms could not, and in doing so, began to knit their communities together. With food filling bellies once again, the tempers began to cool and kirin started seeing each other as friends once more, not as rival hungry mouths that would take their next meal away. Even Matriarch Superior Rain Shine herself spoke to the nation of the movement, and issuing an imperial decree to establish a national Farmers' Day as a holiday in thanks to the peasant farmers for saving the nation from famine by sharing what little they had.\n\nAs for the farmer who started the movement? He simply returned to his farm without giving anykirin his name, unwilling to be put in the national spotlight as a hero. In his own words to one reporter that managed to track down his homestead: "I just did what I thought was right. Kirin were hungry, and I had something I could spare. Simple as that.""

The local constabulary, supported by a company of Vermilion banners, had surrounded the bandit hideout and demanded the surrender of everykirin inside. When the bandit leader insisted on fighting to the death, a single shot from a markskirin ended her rule far quicker than it began, and her followers shortly thereafter surrendered to the banners.\n\nMidnight Candle watched with a small frown on her face as the bandits were led away from their encampment one by one, with banner soldiers guarding the column on either side. The bandits certainly didn't look like the vicious marauders they were in the stories parents told their foals; rather, they were poor and broken kirin, many well into their middle ages, many more barely old enough to be considered adults. Some had foals clinging to their legs or backs, crying in fear as their parents were dragged away to await their fate. All of it hurt Candle's soul, and she couldn't help but mention it when the company commander trotted by.\n\n"They may be poor farmers just trying to feed their families, but they're bandits, Candle," the officer said, shaking his head. "Desperation doesn't forgive the killing and stealing they've done."\n\n"We should be helping them, not imprisoning them," Candle countered, and she touched her red and orange robes for emphasis. "The Rising Fire wants to help all the kirin of the land. If we work together to support one another, then farmers wouldn't have to turn to banditry to support their families. The Way of Fire only imposes order and treats the symptoms of unrest, but it does nothing to weed out the root cause."\n\nThe officer just shook his head. "I don't disagree with you," he began, "but how far should we let an individual push their interests when it hurts so many more? If we are ever to move forward as a nation, we need to unify and deal with the problems at hoof. Maybe one day we'll be able to stop kirin from turning to a life of banditry, but all we can do now is play catch up and stop the ones who already have." He patted Candle on the shoulder and gave her a small nod. "Go back to camp and ready a service for the troops, chaplain.

Now, petition your case, honored guests."\n\nThough that answer hardly seemed pleasing to the priests, one stepped forward regardless. "This modernisation project is going too far!" he exclaimed, angrily stomping his hoof. "The mountains surrounding Vermilion are Concord's sacred domain. Every single peak and every last valley were blessed by Her hooves. It was those mountains which She first crafted to shield Vermilion's fertile valley from the primordial fire that gave birth to the world! And it is these mountains that miners and prospectors defile every day, digging through the earth for material wealth, and trampling over the foundations of our theocracy and our society! They must be stopped!"\n\nAt this, Fickle Current stood up and scowled at the three. "The mining companies are doing important work that is critical to the Grand Gallop Onward. Not only that, but they are doing so in a respectful manner. No prospecting occurs within fifty kilometers of a temple or shrine, and all named mountains in the range are free from mining activity. But I feel I must reiterate, Premier, that the resources they extract are important for our modernisation efforts. It cannot progress smoothly were they to be interfered with."\n\n"All of the mountains must be declared sacred property!" the other stallion priest exclaimed. "They are Concord's by right. Is nothing sacred? This modernisation drive is self-destructive. Cities are consuming the countryside in a cannibalistic fervor that destroys nature. They must be stopped before it is too late!""
kirin_crisis.15.d_2:0 "The three priests standing before the assembled Plenum made for an odd sight. Autumn Blaze could tell at a glance that the three, two stallions and a mare, were part of The Way of Fire's more ultraorthodox followers. Their clothes and coats were smeared with black ash from countless sacred fires, and one had even tied gunpowder-coated string into their mane, though he hadn't lit the sparkling fuses before making his appeal to Rain Shine. "Where is our Matriarch?" the mare among them asked. "We seek an audience with her Divinity, not with mortal kirin who claim to be acting in her name."\n\n"The Plenum is blessed with Matriarch Rain Shine's divine authority," Autumn quickly countered.

"Modernity and The Way of Fire are not mutually exclusive. Is it not true that Concord bestowed the world on us kirin to rule after She created it and us? We would be doing Her a disservice by refusing to partake of the gifts She has given us. Wisely utilizing the resources that Concord Herself placed for us would show Her as much devotion as maintaining Her pristine creation, if not moreso.""

kirin_crisis.16.d:0 "Coin Counter paced back and forth outside of Matriarch Superior Rain Shine's study, trying her best not to show her anxiety or break out in a nervous sweat at her impending meeting with Kiria's absolute theocratic leader. She had never met the Matriarch before, nor so much as seen her in person outside of anything resembling an official function of the state, and here she was about to spend ten, fifteen, maybe even twenty minutes in conversation with her, one on one, about a matter of absolute economic priority. She was terrified that she'd completely forget what she needed to say and then stare at the Matriarch, dumbfounded, like a deer after the invention of artificial lights.\n\nTaking a deep breath, she set her folder down on a nearby table and began to leaf through its pages to remind herself on what she needed to say. In Fragrance and Rhapsody, the returnee population had become so entrenched in their ways that they had established a de facto parallel authority to the imperial administration that consisted entirely of their most respected (and wealthy) businesskirin, intellectuals, artists, and other high-profile figures. That was a political problem all in its own, but the economic problem at the route of it came from these figures' desire to use their own paper money over the Kirin tael, the gold coin that had been around since the creation of the Realm. The diaspora's paper money was based on the Sycee Trading House's bank notes, which they called 'scrips', and were backed up by the massive stocks of silver and gold Sycee possessed in Griffonia, which they were slowly but surely moving back to Kiria. The scrips were far more popular (and stronger) than the Kirin tael in the northern cities, and were undoubtedly responsible for strong economic growth and investment among the returning diaspora, but it undermined and devalued the tael the more it circulated. And now, Coin Counter had to explain the situation to the Matriarch and ask for her opinion on what should be the official currency of Kiria. The money was, after all, minted and circulated under her divine authority.\n\nThat left Coin Counter with a tough pitch to sell. Should she try to convince Rain Shine to disallow the use of the diaspora scrip, strengthening the Kirin tael and reasserting Vermilion's dominance over the north but slowing its economic growth? Or should she convince the Matriarch to accept the scrip as acceptable currency alongside the tael, even at the risk of devaluing the official currency further, to encourage the growth of the north even more?"
kirin_crisis.16.a:0 "One nation, one currency. The tael will be the only coin accepted in Kiria."

She never imagined that the military would partially answer to her, yet she also never imagined she'd be in this position when she was a foal...\n\n"The majority of the Realm is quiet, save for a few scuffles with bandits in the west, but the big issue is Fragrance," Coral River said, tapping a map of Kiria for emphasis.

kirin_crisis.18.t:0 "Order in the Court"
kirin_crisis.18.d:0 "With the imperial constitution finally written and delivered to every town in Kiria, no matter how big or small, Autumn Blaze had hoped that the worst of the challenges that document would face were behind it. But while the rest of the Realm read and ratified the constitution, the city of Rhapsody quickly rejected a part of the constitution relating to the implementation of the new judicial system. After a quick talk with her advisor, Fern Flare, she soon figured out why.\n\n"Rhapsody has always had this important judicial institution that they're fiercely proud of," Fern Flare explained. "The Procurate of Rhapsody is this entire system where the priests with the greatest seniority in the city can serve as absolute arbiters and judges in any cases or complaints they take an interest in. It's a system where right and wrong is decided solely by whoever is highest in the pecking order, and it's been entrenched in the city for a long time, even during the peak of Vermilion's power. I can understand why they don't want to let it go."\n\n"They have to, though," Autumn protested, frowning at the letter of Rhapsody's rejection. "They can't just accept part of the constitution and keep their own judicial system. The constitution is needed to standardize our laws and practices across the entire Realm so it's easier to govern. They can't even claim that they're doing it for The Way of Fire; even Winter Frost agreed to it, and she's THE voice of our religion in Vermilion."\n\n"In Vermilion, but not in Rhapsody," Fern Flare quickly countered. "Pushing this issue could create tensions between Vermilion and Rhapsody down the line. It might be better to let them have this exception. Just this once.""
kirin_crisis.18.a:0 "Once we give one city an exception, the others will want their own."
kirin_crisis.18.b:0 "Rhapsody's friendship is important enough to allow an exception."

kirin_crisis.19.t:0 "A New Standard or an Old Banner?"
kirin_crisis.19.d:0 "Autumn Blaze would be the first kirin to admit she had no experience with the art of war, and so she had long tried to put matters of warfare into the hooves of experienced and studied kirin she could trust. But the newest dilemma on her desk was one that she had to attend to personally as the imperial premier. With the modernisation of the country, and the dawning reality that the world the Realm had returned to was even more dangerous than the one it had cut ties with a century ago, Kiria was in desperate need of a modern, functional, and supplied army to protect its borders. That left Autumn, as its premier and effective head of government, in dire need of a solution to bolster the banners and provide for Kiria's security throughout the process.\n\nAutumn tapped her pen to her lips as she tried to recall what she'd learned at her last meeting with the officers of the Vermilion Banner Army, and that was when an idea came to her. On the western border with the zebra natives and griffon colonizers existed many regional militias that had maintained their military traditions throughout the Silence to protect their lands from raids across the river. They were antiquated and fought with swords and outdated battle tactics, but they were organized, well-trained, and had a strong identity as warrior-kirin. Better yet, when the news of the Grand Gallop Onward reached the western border, they had immediately reaffirmed their oaths of loyalty to Vermilion and Matriarch Rain Shine. There was a possibility in here to do something with them and bolster the army as a whole.\n\nAutumn snatched a sheet of paper off her desk and prepared to write down a proposal for the Reform Bureau, but she hesitated before putting ink to paper. These units were hardly top of the line; what they possessed in discipline they lacked in equipment and modern doctrine. Would it be better to let them keep their organization as autonomous military units and adopt them into the Banner Army, or dissolve and disperse them to integrate them into the growing banners as a whole? Keeping them together would please the martial families of the west, but it would also hurt the spread of new ideas. But dispersing them into the army would allow them to be better trained and more effectively used, and the mixture of ideas from throughout the Realm would help dilute any biases of the western soldiers; The Rising Fire was very popular in the west, after all, and it could be a risky endeavor to let those beliefs grow unchecked..."
kirin_crisis.19.a:0 "The Banner Army needs to be bolstered with existing units."
kirin_crisis.19.b:0 "We should dissolve these militias and train them in the ways of modern warfare."

kirin_crisis.20.t:0 "Dialectic Dialects"
kirin_crisis.20.d:0 "Sometimes, it was days like this that reminded Autumn Blaze just how little she understood about Kiria, despite being its imperial premier. She had always known that the Realm was a large nation home to many diverse kirin culture groups, but never before had she faced the problem of having to use a translator to speak to kirin who lived under her jurisdiction. But as a group of kirin from Verdant brought a petition all the way up to the Morning Secretariat for them to resolve, Autumn felt like she was beginning to grasp just how monumental a challenge keeping the nation together during the Grand Gallop Onward would be.\n\nAfter sorting out some confusion with the translator, and with the assistance of members of the Secretariat who hailed from Verdant, the issue at hoof became much clearer. Verdant, diverse as it was, had its own dialect of the kirin language, to the point where it was difficult for Autumn, who was from Massicot, to understand what they were saying. While the language the majority of the Realm spoke and the dialect Verdant spoke used the same script, their pronunciation, grammar, and vernacular were extremely different. But the crux of the issue rested on what Fickle Current and his NAKP party had been attempting to do in the city. The NAKP had begun to offer language classes in Verdant to help the local populace learn how to speak the Vermilion dialect of kirish, which had angered the local leaders in Verdant, especially the mystics of The Rising Fire, who felt they were being scolded for supposed 'backwardness' by the bourgeoisie colonizers from the north. Their demands were quite simple: that the NAKP leave the city and cease attempting to teach Vermilion kirish in Verdant's schools and teahouses, and let Verdant proudly embrace its cultural heritage instead of letting it be erased by the influence of the north. When their demands triggered outrage from the NAKP members seated in the Morning Secretariat, who claimed that it was the right of the NAKP to conduct these educational ventures to promote patriotism for the Realm as a whole, Autumn quickly realized that it would come down to her and her supporters to decide whether to accept the petitioners' plea or not."

kirin_crisis.21.t:0 "Kiria's Covered Cage"
kirin_crisis.21.d:0 "The kirin sitting across from Autumn Blaze unsettled her. There was something about him that wormed its way under her scales and made them itch. Maybe it was the way his eyes seemed to pick her apart whenever she spoke, or the slight crookedness of his muzzle, a memory from some traumatic injury long in his history. More likely it was the way he spoke, and what he spoke about, that made her feel ill at ease. Not even Matriarch Rain Shine sitting by her side made her feel any better.\n\n"Thank you for that... lengthy history on the Banner of the Covered Cage, Ember Wane," Autumn said, picking her notes up and jogging the pages together. "I never knew that Matriarch Noctilucent Charm had created an organization so... loyal and dedicated to enforcing the policies of The Silence. Coming from a small farm in Massicot, I never would have imagined that one of the Matriarch's banners was dedicated to rooting out any attempts to turn back the clock and go back to what life was like before The Silence. That's, uh... quite a doozy."\n\n"It was necessary," Ember Wane grunted in a gruff voice. "Kiria's survival depended on making sure The Silence was followed. We worked in the shadows to make sure that it was. My family, and the families of all my bannerkin and comrades, have spent generations enforcing it, without thanks or recognition for our hard work. We have always been loyal to the Matriarchs, first to Noctilucent Charm, and now to you, Matriarch Rain Shine. And now, with Kiria changing and The Silence ended, I come to you on behalf of the Banner of the Covered Cage to ask for official recognition of who we are and what we did in the century since 903. It is time that we are no longer forced to live in secrecy, but be rewarded for our faithful work. Do this, Matriarch, and we shall serve you however you see fit, with no more reason to hide in the shadows."\n\nBefore Rain Shine could respond, Autumn nervously cleared her throat. "Y-Yes, well, we're all thankful for your work. I know I'd want recognition too if I had to do what you guys did. But Matriarch... we can't be too hasty here." When Rain Shine raised an eyebrow, Autumn sucked in a deep breath. "The Banner of the Covered Cage... well, from what Ember Wane has told us, they check out with stories we've heard from peasants and farming villages about organized groups of bandits that would sack towns that tried to reorganize their own societies during The Silence. I don't think Ember is going to try to deny that his group was involved in that. So we have to be careful here; do we really give official recognition to the Covered Cage given how the public would feel about that? Or do we just... keep this under the rug, for the time being?""
kirin_crisis.21.a:0 "The Banner of the Covered Cage will be recognized for their hard work."
kirin_crisis.21.b:0 "It is too soon to officially acknowledge the Banner's existence."

kirin_crisis.22.t:0 "The Last Sunrise of Sunrise"
kirin_crisis.22.d:0 "Matriarch Superior Rain Shine retreated to her study after her lunch, a worrying thought pricking at the back of her mind. Ever since Ember Wane had come to her seeking recognition for the Banner of the Covered Cage, her thoughts were troubled by what her Premier had said and what that meant for her realm. Had this paramilitary group really been operating without limits and without check for this long? It bothered her that she knew so little about them. They were apparently organized by her mother, and had been operating under her command for decades. Now they claimed to be loyal to her as Kiria's ruling Matriarch. They could be useful, there was no doubt, but Autumn Blaze had made it clear that working with them was a double-edged sword, and would come with its own host of problems.\n\nChief among them was a record she found in a tattered scroll that reported on their progress to her mother. Though it was short and laced with jargon, Rain Shine was able to suss out the real story inside of the banner's report. It detailed an "intervention" in the town of Sunrise, and how "quick and decisive action" by the banner had "dismantled the heretical society" inside of Sunrise. It sounded so clean on paper, but when Rain Shine brought up other reports and letters that had been sent around the time of the banner's actions, it painted a far bloodier story.\n\nSunrise had once been home to a millenarian sect of The Way of Fire, who believed that the Vermilion Dynasty had failed Kiria, and that Concord could never be so cruel as to punish the entire Realm with something as harsh as The Silence. Instead, they believed that the Vermilion Dynasty had acted out of corruption and greed, and had smothered Kiria with The Silence in its lust for absolute power. But at the turn of the millennium, Concord would bestow a new avatar on Kiria to overthrow the Vermilion Dynasty and return Kiria to greatness, and so the town and its inhabitants refused to follow the decrees of The Silence and prepared for the new avatar's arrival. By all accounts of the time (what few there were), the city of Sunrise was peaceful and prosperous, open to sharing its wealth with its neighbors, and had modernised in its own way—at least until the Banner of the Covered Cage descended on the town. The inhabitants were slaughtered to the last for charges of heresy and defiance of The Silence, and the entire town put to the torch. All this the Banner had done in the name of the Matriarch and Concord, and though the story had become something of a folk tale in kirin society, the reemergence of the Covered Cage would surely reignite those stories and fill the peasants and farmers of Kiria with outrage.\n\nIt left Rain Shine at a terrible impasse. She didn't know what she should do about the story of Sunrise and the Banner of the Covered Cage. Should she come clean to her subjects, apologize for the decades-old massacre, and condemn the actions of the Covered Cage? Or should she suppress the incident as best as she could, in the hope of maintaining peace and calm?"
kirin_crisis.22.a:0 "The Realm must come clean about its past if it wants to move forward."
kirin_crisis.22.b:0 "The knowledge of what happened in Sunrise would do more harm than good."

While Current has not officially been declared a traitor in Vermilion, it is undeniable that he is the de facto head of state of a breakaway nation that has repudiated Vermilion's authority, and there is some risk in setting hoof in lands still administered by the Realm of Kiria.

Though no cabinet or ministerial-level RaHP delegates have joined the revolt, the party's upper echelons have not condemned it either. Premier Autumn Blaze has refused RA demands to enforce party discipline and has opened negotiations with the rebelling backbenchers."

kirin_council.1.t:0 "Fragrance Rises" ##unused, replaced with WS
kirin_council.1.d:0 "Today, Fickle Current felt like the most powerful kirin in the world. As he stood behind the podium placed before Fragrance's city hall, he let his eyes wander over the hundreds, if not thousands of kirin that had gathered to hear him speak. They ran the gamut from NAKP higher-ups to its supporters and soldiers to just the commoners of Fragrance, a city wronged by Vermilion, a city that had finally found its moment for vengeance. As he stood there, Current could only imagine that this was what it felt like to command the kind of power and devotion that Matriarch Rain Shine owned in the imperial city. But unlike her, he would not let it go to waste.\n\n"Kirin of Fragrance," he began, microphones booming his voice throughout the plaza and down several city blocks. "Yesterday, our great city stood at a crossroads. Vermilion was failing, its modernization efforts collapsing into wreck and ruin. They were unable to do what they needed to do in crushing the lawless heretics to the west, and in their undoing, they sought to drag us down with them. But Fragrance shall bow to Vermilion no more. We are the bastion of modernization and industrialization; we are the shining beacon that brought hope to our Matriarch's realm when all else had failed it. And now, as her realm reaches the our of darkness, the kirin of Fragrance and the north, under the trusted guidance of the NAKP, shall mobilize our incredible resources and belief in our own righteousness to save it. We shall save Kiria from the death throes of the Silence! We shall save Kiria from the superstition that has plagued it for too long! And we shall save our Matriarch from the forces of communalism and the poisoned lies of the Way of Fire's self-serving mystics! For with Fragrance leading the way, Kiria will finally know peace and prosperity the likes of which it has never known before!\n\n"So stand with me, kirin of the north. Stand with the NAKP, and let us all save Kiria!""

kirin_council.2.t:0 "The Vote of the Century"
kirin_council.2.d:0 "Fickle Current and Cypress Snow sat on the balcony of a restaurant overlooking the Chrysanthemum Plaza in front of Fragrance's city hall. As the sun set on the city, scores of kirin bustled too and fro, setting up polling stations, lines, and ballot boxes. It was much the same throughout the rest of Fragrance, and the north as a whole. For tomorrow, the most important vote Fragrance had ever held would take place: the decision of whether to commit the formerly unthinkable and take up arms against Vermilion.\n\n"We stand on the precipice," Cypress mused, setting his chopsticks down. "A decision that could either bring ruin to the Realm or heal it. And the worst part is, we do not know which choice leads to which outcome."\n\n"If we could see the future, then we wouldn't need a vote," Current agreed. "Both options are valid. Half of the NAKP wants to focus on industrialization while the Matriarch fights the Rising Fire in the west. I can see where they're coming from; if we industrialize while the imperial realm burns, then we can come to the negotiating table with the Matriarch after the war as equals, not lessers. After all, they will be desperate and hungry; we won't be."\n\n"And yet there are those who seek the more direct path. They want war." Cypress sighed and rubbed his nose scales. "I've seen war and death in my time in Griffonia. You saw it too, when Kemerskai and his supporters marched into Griffenheim in 978. The Matriarch is the heart and soul of Kiria; we may not agree with her, but she is the one thing that holds our species together, even despite the civil war. The more militant heads in the NAKP wish to march south and free her from the clutches of Autumn Blaze's harmonists and Winter Frost's mystics. But should our armies conquer Vermilion, what happens to the Matriarch then? Does she end up like Grover V, driven into exile only to return and crush us, delegitimizing our fight and our cause? Will she stay in Vermilion and support us? Or do we succeed where Kemerskai failed and commit the unthinkable?"\n\n"I wish I could know," Current said, shaking his head. "But that is something for us to worry about tomorrow. The people of Fragrance will decide for us. Let it never be said that we are undemocratic. Tonight, let us enjoy one last night of calm before the storm.""

kirin_council.3.t:0 "The Moment of Truth"
kirin_council.3.d:0 "The polling places were filled the moment the sun rose that morning. Countless kirin from all trots of life flocked to the polling centers, each and every one eager to let their voice play a part in shaping Fragrance's future. Throughout the city, and throughout the north as a whole, an entire cross-section of the NAKP's ranks could be assembled just by looking at the kirin gathered there. The old members of the bourgeoisie crossed paths with their militant and youthful compatriots, who in turn mingled with urban intellectuals and wealthy investors. Kirin who clearly served in the NAKP's paramilitary arm smiled for pictures with the foals of middle class families, while capitalist magnates freely campaigned for the votes of the kirin present with free food and fanfare. To Fickle Current, who watched from afar throughout the day, it looked like a carnival, although this carnival threatened bloody business at the end of the day. How many kirin would still be smiling and cheering when their husbands and wives, sons and daughters, brothers and sisters took up arms and went off to fight should the vote demand war?\n\nIt took until sundown for the voting to finally taper off. By that point, Current had retired to get some sleep. As the counting went on throughout the night, he knew for a fact that tomorrow would be a busy day. But he didn't even get that much; at three o'clock in the morning, his phone rang, and when he answered it, an NAKP lieutenant informed him that the counting had finished.\n\nFragrance's new chapter had begun."

kirin_council.4.d:0 "Fickle Current had, thankfully, taken the time to write two speeches before the NAKP held its vote on whether to march off to war or not. In the time between receiving the phone call in the middle of the night and now, he had gotten precious little time to prepare a speech, much less rest. There was too much that needed to be done, missives to be drafted, orders to be sent out. The prospect of war on the horizon left little room for error in Fragrance.\n\nBut of course, as leader of the NAKP, he had to address the kirin of Fragrance and the north about this historic day. So, speaking from within Fragrance's city hall, his voice broadcast on radio so kirin all throughout the Realm could hear it, Current finally let the world know just what had transpired in the north. "My brothers and sisters in Fragrance, my compatriots in the north, and all kirin who struggle under the superstitions of the wicked in our Realm," he began, all the while arranging his speech on the table in front of him so he wouldn't have to turn any pages. "Today is a historic day for our Realm. For today, we have embarked on a long and difficult journey to save the Realm. Matriarch Superior Rain Shine is beset on all sides by villains and scoundrels, hypocrites and hedonists. While The Rising Fire and The Way of Fire bicker and fight in the far western reaches of the Realm, our Matriarch remains in Vermilion, a prisoner to the priests and mystics our religion has surrounded her with. They control her every move, her every action, her every word. She is their captive, their puppet, who dances on the strings of failed ideals and backwards religious dogma. Kiria cannot be saved so long as she remains in the clutches of those who hold Vermilion on this day.\n\n"But she will not be held there forever," Current continued, firming his voice with passion and patriotism. "Fragrance is militarizing, and with the help of the returning diaspora, our brothers and sisters abroad, we shall march south to save the Matriarch. With righteous patriotic fervor, we shall cut our way through the degenerates and incompetents who this very moment keep the Matriarch locked in her palace in Vermilion. We shall offer them no quarter, no negotiations. We shall only offer them this one chance: turn aside from the mystics and Equestrian sympathizers who keep the Realm in their clutches. Turn aside from the dangerous heretics and revolutionaries that want to burn our Realm to the ground. Only Fragrance and the NAKP can save Kiria. Lend us your voices, lend us your support, lend us your arms. And together, we shall save Kiria, and we shall save the Matriarch. Concord bless us all!""

Our Realm was fashioned under the guidance of our great Matriarch Superior to put an end to our primal rages. But now, heretics under the leadership of the traitor known as Rising Sun have taken up arms against our Matriarch and seek to topple our way of life. That cannot stand.\n\n"I would be lying if I said that Fragrance and Vermilion have never felt ill will toward each other," he continued, frowning at the microphone in front of him. "But never have we dreamt of taking up arms against our Matriarch. We are loyal subjects of Matriarch Rain Shine, and as such, we owe her our support and respect. That is why I am calling on my brothers and sisters in the north to prepare to fight for our Realm. The north shall embark on a campaign of industrialization that will make the Grand Gallop Onward look like but a small step. We shall mobilize into an army of the people and march south to join our fellow countrykirin in stomping out this heretic menace. Our Realm cannot profit from a civil war; it will only render us weak and crippled, right at the hour when we need to be our strongest. So we shall endeavor to end it, and when the dust is settled and the Rising Fire is destroyed, then, Fragrance, can we approach Vermilion as equals, and ask with civility that old wrongs be righted. But for now, we prepare to fight for our Matriarch. We shall get through this dark night, and with Concord's blessing, we shall see brighter days once more!""

kirin_council.6.d:0 "Fickle Current tapped his hooves together as the intelligence briefing wound to a close. "The Banner of the Covered Cage then slaughtered the inhabitants of the town down to the last, justifying their actions as mandated by the decrees of the Silence, and in line with the wishes of Concord and Matriarch Noctilucent Charm," the intelligence officer concluded, sitting back down in his chair. "It's been covered up ever since, at least to the best of Vermilion's ability. Of course, we quickly figured out the truth once The Silence ended and we could establish a functioning intelligence network in Fragrance, and now Rising Sun has made the rest of the country aware of it too. The question now is: what do we do about it?"\n\n"The anger of the common masses is a potent tool," Cypress Snow said, scratching at his beard. "Used right, it could be a great boon to our cause. But it could also backfire dramatically. I doubt many of the farmers in the north see us as any better than the kirin who massacred Sunrise decades ago. Perhaps there is merit in issuing no statement about this whole affair, and letting the anger of the commoners dissipate with time. After all, we'd just be playing into Rising Sun's hooves to rile us all up."\n\nHe turned to Current, who still sat deep in thought. "Well, Current? You're the chairkirin of the NAKP. Your stance is the Council's stance.""

kirin_council.7.d:0 ""Our coffers are hardly what you would call 'full', but as you can see, neither are they particularly empty."\n\nFickle Current and Cypress Snow whistled in awe as Dr. Ardent Bloom gestured through the open vault door beneath the NAKP's central headquarters in 88 Chrysanthemum Plaza. Behind that two meter-thick vault door were countless ingots and bars of gold, neatly stacked on reinforced shelves and lining the walls of the massive vault. The vault itself was close to full, but it was just one of many doors filling the basement of the party's headquarters, and as Dr. Bloom had described it, it was the only one that was often used. "All of our financial, commercial, and industrial interests around the globe, from all across Griffonia, Zebrica, and even Equus, direct a portion of their profits back here to fund the growth and operations of the NAKP," the economist explained. "We're the best for their business, after all. That is further supplemented by our wealthy donors who frequently grant us lavish gifts to nudge the needle of progress in the direction they feel is favorable. The party maintains complete control over the entirety of the industry in the north of our fair realm; that means that our coffers and our business dealings with the companies aligned with us are the de-facto economy of the Emergency Council. And when you hold complete control over the economy, you hold complete control over the state."\n\nFickle Current scratched his chin. "Impressive," he concluded. "The North is like a massive corporation, then, and its employees are its citizens. This would make it the most powerful corporation in the world."\n\n"And with that power comes great opportunity," Cypress added. He pointed to the gold stacked high in the vault. "Grease the right hooves with some money, write up a few tax liens for our largest partnering companies, grant a few gifts to a few kirin in the right places, and we could gain a material advantage in the ruins of the Grand Gallop Onward. This could greatly further the interests of the NAKP."\n\n"Money exists to be invested," Current agreed. "And it takes a shrewd businesskirin to make the best investments." He nodded at Dr. Bloom. "Thank you for the tour, doctor. This has proven most enlightening.""
kirin_council.7.a:0 ""You want it? It's yours, my friend, so long as you have enough gold.""

kirin_council.8.t:0 "Winning Over Friends"
kirin_council.8.d:0 "Fickle Current looked around at the team of pollsters, party loyalists, and local governors and mayors that he had assembled in Fragrance to help chart the path forward. They had all traveled to the city to assemble an important effort that could make or break Fragrance's fortunes: the Northern Compact for Self-Determination, and the canvassing and polling operation that would attempt to turn it into a reality. If it failed, Fragrance's dreams of total independence from Vermilion might never be realized.\n\n"Our preliminary survey and polling suggests that Rhapsody and Radiance might be receptive to the idea of unifying with Fragrance, but at the moment, they're held in place by inertia and devotion to Vermilion," the team's top pollster, Simple Survey, explained. "They're afraid to separate themselves from Vermilion and the Matriarch, even despite the instability throughout the Realm. But, with enough effort and enough funding, we may be able to change minds and garner popular support for a plebiscite on whether or not to join the Northern Compact. As it stands, we're too weak to survive against aggression from Vermilion, but if we can win over some more friends and all the land and factories that come with them, we might just have a chance."\n\n"Then it needs to be done," Fickle Current agreed. "If we can get more of the north to fall in line behind us without firing a shot, then that's one more bullet we can save for Vermilion when the time comes. It helps us that the north is used to its autonomy compared to the rest of the Realm, even from the days dating back before The Silence. The Great Mellifluve ties the center of the Realm together and homogenizes its culture, but Fragrance, Rhapsody, and Radiance are not part of its watershed. The culture and identity of the north is uniquely our own. We can push that message to help encourage the formation of the Compact, and finally secure that clean break from Vermilion that the north has been looking for for so long."\n\nWithin minutes, everykirin present voted unanimously to proceed forward with the daunting canvassing operation. The Northern Compact would be made a reality."
kirin_council.8.a:0 "The kirin of the north deserve their independence from Vermilion!"

kirin_council.9.t:0 "Harmonizing with Rhapsody's Rhapsody"
kirin_council.9.d:0 "Sifting through one saved letter after another, Fickle Current again reviewed the correspondence between the NAKP and Rhapsody that had been assembled for his review. The matter was an important one, and it regularly kept him up late these past few days as he attempted to slowly convince the leadership of Rhapsody that its interests and the NAKP's interests were one in the same.\n\nThe short version of the matter was that Fragrance needed Rhapsody's cooperation to survive. Rhapsody was, to Fragrance's chagrin, Kiria's most prosperous city, and the addition of its population and industrial base to Fragrance's own would nearly double the might of the nascent Northern Compact. That was why it was so important that the plebiscite succeed in the city, but to guarantee its success, the NAKP would have to navigate around Rhapsody's political establishment. Despite how much the city had claimed to support The Way of Fire in its past and throughout The Silence, the kirin of Rhapsody had been fairly lax with their enforcement of the doctrines and edicts of The Silence, disagreeing with former Matriarch Noctilucent Charm's interpretation of Concord's will. This was largely due to its ruling system of religious courts and prosecutors, collectively known as its Procurate, which managed to appease Vermilion with its rulings and subsequently avoid enacting the harshest measures of The Silence. That same Procurate had only grown in strength since 903, and if the NAKP ever wanted to bring Rhapsody into its fold, it had to find some way to appease the Procurate.\n\nBut Fickle Current frowned as he read through the correspondence again. Was the Procurate really necessary? Rhapsody's citizenry was enlightened and very independent, and while they respected the Procurate, they frequently challenged it in court, unafraid to settle disputes over law and legal matters using its own courts against them. It left Current with an interesting dilemma, and two angles of attack that could possibly bring Rhapsody into the fold: did the NAKP attempt to appease the establishment and win over the Procurate's support, or appeal to the citizens of Rhapsody and put pressure on the Procurate to accept Fragrance's offer of unity from the bottom up?"
kirin_council.9.a:0 "Appealing to Rhapsody's Procurate is the most direct approach."

kirin_council.10.t:0 "A Gateway to the Gateway"
kirin_council.10.d:0 "Simple Survey scratched his chin as he reviewed the information the Working Group for Statistics and Analysis had gathered for the NAKP. The subject at hoof was the matter of pressuring Radiance and the Viridian Coast into joining the Northern Compact through the plebiscite. The scenario was an interesting one, as the two locales were quite different from each other. While the Viridian Coast featured a growing petit bourgeoisie fueled by the mingling of diaspora returnees, influential kirin from Rhapsody, and the local northerners that lived on its farms and fished off its coasts, Radiance was a hotspot for the returning diaspora, and the city that once served as the international Gateway to Vermilion was home to a rapidly growing middle class of traders, merchants, craftskirin, and other professionals. Given the NAKP's resources, it made sense to try and tailor its campaigning and canvassing efforts to either one group or the other. Simple Survey just had to decide which one to recommend to Chairkirin Current.\n\nSnatching a pad of paper and a pencil, Survey started to sketch out a potential strategy for each locale. If the NAKP supported canvassing efforts targeted to the kirin of the Viridian Coast, they could champion the diverse background of the proud northerners that had turned the backwater into an important hub of wealth and productivity in the north, and have an easier time in garnering their support for the Northern Compact. Conversely, if the NAKP focused on Radiance, they could appeal directly to the moneyed, intelligent, and sensible diaspora settling throughout the city, and build a strong connection with the kirin living there based on their Equestrian and Griffonian sensibilities from their time spent abroad. Those kirin were the bread and butter of the NAKP: highly educated and wealthy kirin resistant to the superstitions of the peasants throughout the Realm. It only made sense to continue to appeal to the base, after all, but winning over Radiance at the expense of the common kirin of the north could lead to problems down the line.\n\nBut in the end, Simple Survey could only recommend one approach to the chairkirin. And that approach was..."

kirin_council.11.t:0 "Investing Capital"
kirin_council.11.d:0 "Budgeting meetings were hardly glorious when Kiria existed in a state of chaos and fire, but they had to be done nevertheless. Fickle Current, who presided over the meeting as the NAKP's Chairkirin, reflected to himself how similar running a country and running a business were. Even when the nation was on fire and teetering on the brink of collapse, meetings and strategies still needed to be organized, just like in a company on the verge of bankruptcy.\n\nBut thankfully, the Northern Compact was on the ascendancy, not the decline, and these budgeting meetings had their focus on investing in the future rather than staving off immediate danger. Here in the meeting with him were three kirin: Simple Survey, the chief strategist from the Working Group for Statistics and Analysis; Cherry Blossom, Fragrance's mayor and the mare who had taken it upon herself to represent the interests of the other states in the north to the NAKP; and Dr. Ardent Bloom, the NAKP's chief economist who had one of the most influential voices in deciding how the party should spend its money. Each of the kirin was there to pitch their ideas for investing the NAKP's treasury, and Fickle Current heard them all in turn.\n\n"A factory-dockyard complex in the Comely Cape will provide the Compact with long-term industrial output and economic growth," the strategist said. "If we're to survive tomorrow's challenges, we need to be adequately prepared."\n\n"Infrastructure projects in the Comely Cape and Fragrance itself will be much more valuable, not only to our industry, but also to our citizens," Cherry Blossom countered. "Facilitating the ease of movement of goods and kirin from place to place is an investment we cannot look over."\n\n"Why not take some of our development capital and invest it in the Griffonian and Equestrian markets?" Dr. Bloom asked. "There's plenty of gains to be made from investing in them, given the world situation. We just need to make sure we're investing in the victors of today's wars and not the losers."\n\nThey were all valid points, and Current knew none of the other kirin present would side with another's proposal over their own. He would have to make the final decision."
kirin_council.11.a:0 "Simple Survey is right; we need to invest in our industry."

kirin_council.12.d:0 "Mayor Cherry Blossom blew a breath of air out of the corner of her muzzle as she waited for Fickle Current's secretary to admit her to his office. It annoyed her deep down inside that this foreigner had taken such complete control of her city, even if she was still the mayor. She had been elected in the waning years of The Silence and had served Fragrance faithfully since then, but Fickle Current and his moneyed buddies quickly bought out any and all political power and influence in and around the city, leaving her playing second (or third, or fourth) fiddle to the returning diaspora. But he was making good on his promise to return Fragrance to its glory days, at the least; so long as he did that, she could tolerate the NAKP's stranglehold over her city for as long as she needed to.\n\nThe secretary finally announced Current was ready to see her, and Cherry Blossom opened the door to his office and stepped inside. The foreign-born kirin looked up from his desk at her, pushed some papers to the side, and held his forehooves together. "Mayor Blossom. To what do I owe the visit?"\n\n"I'm here to give you some advice on your Plebiscite," she said, pulling over a seat and sitting down across the desk from him. "I know you and the NAKP have been campaigning very hard throughout the north to turn your dream of the Northern Compact into a reality, and I very much hope you succeed. But I fear that you're ignoring the kirin that support you here at home while you focus all your efforts abroad."\n\nFickle Current cocked his head at that. "And what do you mean by that? That the NAKP should invest in canvassing efforts in our home territory? The pollsters already show that they support the Northern Compact whole-heartedly, or at least well enough that we don't have to worry about losing their support."\n\n"You might lose OUR support by ignoring this city and the surrounding countryside," Cherry Blossom retorted. "The kirin of Fragrance and throughout the Council of North Kiria could use some reminder of the NAKP's dedication to them. Campaigning funds could instead be spent on improving the quality of life of everykirin living in our little corner of the north, improving the health of the Council in the long term. Why waste money politicking when it could be used to help kirin instead?""

kirin_council.13.d:0 "Though Fickle Current had arrived in Rhapsody on business, he indulged his inner tourist for a moment after stepping off of the train to take in the mountainous city's beautiful architecture. Colorful buildings and pagodas had been nestled among the mountain's slopes on terraced blocks, with carefully maintained cobblestone roads winding this way and that as the procession of NAKP kirin ascended from the train station to the massive temple sitting on the crown of the city. Perched high atop a massive terrace overlooking the rest of the city, the holiest of the Way of Fire temples in Kiria, and the home of Rhapsody's Procurate, looked every bit like a castle or palace watching over its citizens. That was fitting, Current felt; despite their religious pretense, Rhapsody's Procurate was a council dominated by priests just as politically and judicially shrewd as they were religiously devout.\n\nHis delegation was welcomed to the temple by young acolytes, and soon they found themselves standing in the middle of the chamber, where the priests and mystics of the Procurate sat in tall, high-backed chairs ringing the floor. They were all wizened kirin, and one old mare seated in the center looked old enough to have seen the beginning of The Silence with her own eyes. It was to this mare, Heavenly Fire, that the NAKP presented their gift of a priceless porcelain vase made to commemorate the first Matriarch Superior's ascension in the sixth century, and to whom Current laid out the NAKP's offer to admit Rhapsody into the Northern Compact.\n\nAfter several minutes to talk and deliberate with her peers, Heavenly Fire fixed Current with coal-black eyes set in her wrinkled face. "Rhapsody holds no love for Vermilion after the debacle of the Grand Gallop Onward," she said, her voice wavering with age and effort. "The young Matriarch misunderstands Concord's will, like her mother before her. We believe that Fragrance offers a better path forward, and the Procurate is willing to join with the NAKP on one condition: that the criminals and thugs that call themselves the Order of the Iron Chrysanthemum never be allowed to step hoof in this city."\n\nIt was an odd request, but not an unexpected one. "The Order provides important services for our top members and most charitable donors," Current countered. "Sure, they may act in manners that the Procurate might deem unscrupulous, but those services are nevertheless invaluable."\n\n"They are thugs and miscreants who operate outside of Concord's holy law," Heavenly Fire retorted, but Current could see he had piqued the interest of some of her peers. "I will not have them in this city.""

kirin_council.14.d:0 "If there was one thing that helped smooth over the exhausting and often frustrating work of drafting directives for the NAKP, it was doing that work over a meal with a friend. Fickle Current found himself doing just that with Ardent Bloom, the two kirin enjoying an afternoon ginseng oolong tea with a side of spring rolls and steamed dumplings as they pored over the Provisional Industrial Central Planning scheme that Current planned to introduce to the NAKP's next legislative session. But there was a sticking point, one that had driven the two kirin back and forth for the better part of an hour as they tried to reach an acceptable compromise.\n\n"No, there is no way you can spin it that will make the trading houses happy," Ardent said with a resolute shake of his head. "Anything related to nationalization will only incense them. It violates the free market principles the NAKP is founded on. Don't forget that the trading houses and corporations have creaturehood status in the Council, and they have voices in its decision-making as well."\n\n"As much as I support the rights of the corporations, they have to be willing to give back when asked. They can't take and take and take, and never expect to have to give every once in a while," Current said with a heavy sigh. "Our position is tenuous, and this is a matter of national wellbeing. The corporations need to direct their resources toward efforts that will forward our national security above all else if they even want to have a Kiria to invest in when all is said and done."\n\n"Then if you want to get them onboard, you need to compromise," Ardent suggested. "Assure the corporations that any such nationalization measures are merely temporary, and allow them to exempt a portion of their assets if they are willing to purchase that exemption with a donation to the party. It's better than trying to chain them to the Council against their will and refuse to listen to their complaints. Don't forget that you need to respect their business interests; I wouldn't expect to stay on very long as Chairkirin of the NAKP if you incur their wrath.""

kirin_council.15.d:0 "Fern Flare rarely got the opportunity to decide policy directly with Matriarch Superior Rain Shine, but unfortunately, the current situation demanded it. She found herself in Rain Shine's palace in Autumn's stead, and between Rain Shine's frazzled and decidedly less-than-divine appearance, and Winter Frost's frustrated, borderline furious expression, she felt like a fish out of water. But Autumn needed some time to rest and recover; the stress from trying and failing to hold Kiria together throughout the Grand Gallop Onward had taken a considerable toll on her, and crippling migraines left her barely able to stand up straight for more than an hour at a time. She only hoped her friend would get better in time; Premier material, Fern Flare knew she was not.\n\nBut the world stopped turning for nokirin, and there were still countless crises that needed to be resolved, with or without Autumn. The current one involved the plebiscite in Greater Providence orchestrated by that traitor, Fickle Current, and his cronies. It was an issue that had filled Winter Frost with a tempestuous rage, and today's meeting was no different. "That godless creature is trying to lure the faithful away from us," Winter spat. "This plebiscite of his is just an attempt to illegally and unlawfully steal our land and people from us. They try to weaken us further when we are already so fractured and weak. It can't be allowed to proceed."\n\n"But it's democratic, isn't it?" Fern Flare countered. "The kirin of the north are still going to vote, and even if the kirin of Greater Providence don't share all our traditions and beliefs, I doubt we'll see them vote en masse to separate from Vermilion. Still, the NAKP wants to do this without bloodshed, and that gives us negotiating power to make it hard for the Plebiscite to succeed."\n\n"How so?" Rain Shine asked. "I don't want any of Concord's subjects to die over this matter. If it can be done peacefully, then we should do it."\n\n"We've had some contact with the NAKP over this issue," Fern Flare explained. "If we offer to accept a treaty with them making the Plebiscite legally binding, then we can pressure them to set the bar for secession at 75% of the vote in every state in Greater Providence. Once that's done, we can begin our own campaign to make sure they don't get the votes to reach that threshold."\n\n"We do not negotiate with traitors," Winter said, frowning at Fern. Then she turned to Rain Shine. "Declare it illegal, and put an end to their subterfuge right here and now. Proclaim that we will never accept its results. It's the only way to keep the realm together.""

kirin_council.16.d:0 "The news had been about as good as Fickle Current could have expected. After tentatively reaching out to Vermilion, the diplomatic arm of the NAKP had managed to secure the Matriarch's guarantee that Vermilion would recognize the legality of the Plebiscite and, if the NAKP could garner the votes, would allow the north to secede into the cultural union of Greater Providence. Current was less pleased about the threshold they had to meet: Vermilion would not recognize the Plebiscite as successful unless each and every state in Greater Providence voted to secede with 75% of the votes. It would be a tall task to reach that benchmark, but it was a goal they would strive for regardless.\n\nCypress Snow shared many of the same thoughts when Current informed him of Vermilion's decision. "They may think they've stolen a base on us, but the game's not over yet," he said as the two lounged in Current's office. "But it's nothing money can't fix, and money is something we know how to scrape together like nokirin's business. I think it's doable; we just have to put our backs into it, is all."\n\n"My thoughts exactly," Current said, and his magic pulled out a bottle of vintage rice wine he'd ordered to celebrate. Pouring two glasses, he passed one to Cypress, who took it in his own magic. "But we might as well celebrate our successes before we get back to work, no matter how small, right?""

Though the NAKP had tried to dispatch kirin to Vermilion to pressure the Matriarch into recognizing the Plebiscite as a legally-binding vote, Rain Shine had issued a response condemning the Plebiscite and refusing to acknowledge the results of any vote to secede from the Realm. That put the NAKP in a bind; how could they claim to be offering the kirin of Greater Providence a chance to join Fragrance in their own nation without shedding blood if Vermilion refused to recognize the vote?\n\nWhen he shared his concerns with Cypress Snow, the elder kirin and his former mentor merely shook his head. "Vermilion may not recognize the vote on paper, but they will have to recognize the will of their people should we make it clear to them," he said. "If there is an overwhelmingly large margin of votes to join Fragrance, Vermilion will have no choice but to respect the vote or else risk having a revolt on their hooves."\n\nCurrent raised an eyebrow. "Overwhelmingly? What vote do you imagine by that?"\n\n"Nothing short of 80% I feel," Cypress answered. "That much popular support would trigger the secession of those states, regardless of what Vermilion or their local leaders feel. But the level of support has to be the same, or higher, everywhere; no state is likely to be bold enough to make the first move if they're uncertain the rest of the north will follow them to Fragrance."\n\n"And if we don't hit that mark?" Fickle Current asked. "If we're short of it by about 10 or 15%, say 65%, then the referendum is disputed. Both sides will feel vindicated by the outcome. It might come to blows anyway."\n\n"Which Vermilion doesn't realize," Cypress said, disgustedly shaking his head. "They've created a powder keg in the north, and nokirin can back down. We tried to give them the easy way out, but they refused. Well, you know what they say; you reap what you sow.""

Hour by hour, overwhelming votes in favor of secession tallied up throughout the north, slowly assuaging the fears of the NAKP staff that had gathered around the radios to listen to the results being broadcast through Fragrance. It took three days for the last of the votes to come out of the tiniest villages throughout the north, and in some places the final vote rested on a knife's edge in favor of secession, but it was soon official. Four out of every five kirin in Greater Providence voted to turn their backs on Vermilion and join Fragrance, and perhaps to the surprise of many, Vermilion relented without a fight. All the Matriarch asked for was thirty days to finalize the cessation of government activities in Greater Providence and to withdraw local authorities, and then the north would be squarely under Fragrance's jurisdiction.\n\nWhen the news broke the following morning, jubilant kirin took to the streets in celebration, hanging banners, flying flags, and singing songs. Finally separated from the misguided and selfish kirin in Vermilion that had ruined their city a century ago, the kirin of Fragrance were finally free, and finally able to share that freedom with the rest of Greater Providence. All throughout the north, kirin organized impromptu parades and celebrated the final outcome, while the NAKP declared a week of celebration and marked the day as the day of Greater Providence's official independence from Vermilion. For Fickle Current, it was the culmination of a hard-fought struggle, but only the latest high point in his short time as Chairkirin of the NAKP. And when he entered the dining hall to thunderous applause at the feast he organized in 88 Chrysanthemum Plaza, he knew that his tenure as Chairkirin would be one history would remember forever."

Though success of the Plebiscite balanced on a knife's edge for three days, soon the overwhelming support for secession coming out of Greater Providence proved that Vermilion held no sway over the north, and there was little they could do to cling onto it.\n\nThen the speeches and declarations of secession began to roll in across the radio. Local authorities pledged their allegiance to Fragrance, and those that didn't were chased out of town by the local populations determined to split with Vermilion. Even Rhapsody's Chief Magistrate of the Procurate, Priestess Heavenly Fire, made a brief statement on the radio announcing that the kirin of Rhapsody have spoken, and the city would lead the rest of Greater Providence in joining with Fragrance in the interests of protecting their unique cultural identity, an identity not shared by the kirin along the many branches and tributaries of the Great Mellifluve. Though Vermilion protested, and Matriarch Rain Shine read a statement saying that she and Concord did not recognize the results of the vote, Vermilion made no move to suppress the movement by force.

But hour by hour, the situation in the NAKP's war room grew more grim and desperate. Sure, it looked like they were likely to score majorities for secession in several states throughout Greater Providence, but not by the margins they had hoped. It seemed that the kirin of the north were hesitant to break with Vermilion, and when all the votes were finished, it became clear that the dreams of the Northern Compact were dead on arrival. Without an overwhelming majority, no states would break with Vermilion and join with Fragrance in its march to the future.\n\nWhile Vermilion crowed in victory, angry hooves were pointed in 88 Chrysanthemum Plaza as the NAKP tried to come to terms with the defeat and find somekirin to blame. Unfortunately for Fickle Current, his position as Chairkirin of the NAKP meant most hooves pointed at him. By the time he angrily stormed out of the NAKP's war room, he was infuriated and embittered, and beginning to feel vulnerable. All the speeches, all the crowds, his visits to Rhapsody and Radiance... how could they have been so impressive in person and come to so little at the polls?\n\nIt would likely take time to find the answer, but that was hardly a comforting thought. Fragrance's dreams of a unified Greater Providence to stand up to Vermilion were over. It was all he could do now to stave off the entropy and hold the city together for as long as he could in the hopes that another opportunity would come Fragrance's way.

But as they trickled in, it became clear that the Plebiscite was far from over. Though the NAKP had secured large margins throughout the north, with many states voting for secession by 65%, 70%, or even 75% in some places, they failed to achieve the overwhelming margins they had hoped for. But those margins didn't mean defeat; the dream of a free Greater Providence was still alive, and Vermilion would struggle to justify continuing to cling onto provinces where three out of every four kirin desired freedom.\n\nWhile Vermilion attempted to claim victory, citing that there were still enough kirin in the north loyal to the Matriarch that it would be heartless to abandon them to Fragrance, the NAKP gathered for an emergency meeting over how to proceed. Fickle Current quickly made the NAKP's official position clear to everykirin present. "We cannot back down now," he stated, slamming a hoof on the table. "Not only did we secure a majority of the votes, we secured a supermajority. Vermilion cannot ignore this, and neither can we. Our only way forward is a simple one: we must be prepared to fight Vermilion to protect the kirin of Greater Providence. We shall give Vermilion one last chance to back down, one final ultimatum to answer. And if still they refuse to yield, then it leaves us with no choice. We shall have war, and the Matriarch will know that it was she who caused blood to be shed."\n\nThere was no deliberation, no discussion amongst party leadership.

Despite Matriarch Superior Rain Shine declaring the Plebiscite illegal and unlawful, the NAKP had organized the vote anyway, and they had claimed victory in the polls, though it was naturally far more complicated than that. Though enough kirin had voted in favor of secession to claim a supermajority of votes, at least a quarter of the votes cast throughout the north were in opposition to the idea of a Northern Compact, and instead longed to stay connected with Vermilion. And the rights of those kirin, no matter that they were in the majority, needed to be protected.\n\nBut could Vermilion afford to protect them? That was something Fern Flare and Rain Shine struggled to answer as they tried to formulate a response to the ultimatum. The conflict with the Rising Fire in the west left Vermilion stretched thin enough as it was. Could they afford to divert resources and banners to the north if they refused Current's ultimatum and the NAKP pressed forward with war? And what of the kirin who voted for secession? Even if the NAKP lost and Fragrance was humbled, would they see the banners marching through their cities as Vermilion's authority reasserted in the north, or as the conquering armies of a foreign nation? How could they afford to keep the north integrated into the realm if it was conquered, not restored?\n\n"What do we do?" Rain Shine asked Fern Flare, pain in her voice. The prospect of fighting more of her subjects hurt her more deeply than any wound ever could. But Kiria could ill-afford to lose Rhapsody and Radiance, two of its most important cities and industrial centers. It would cripple them in a way from which they might never recover.\n\nIn that moment, Fern Flare wished that Autumn Blaze was here, so that she did not have to make the decision that could lead to more suffering in Kiria in the Premier's stead."

kirin_council.20.d:0 "Cypress Snow regarded the kirin in front of him with studious scrutiny. The kirin, a mare by the name of Springtime Sonnet, was unlike the majority of the diaspora that had returned to Fragrance over the years. While most of the kirin who returned to Kiria were from Griffonia, Springtime was from Equestria, and most kirin families that had immigrated to Equestria had found life enjoyable enough there to find little reason to leave. But Springtime had left a comfy position as a broadcasting executive in Fillydelphia to help organize the NAKP's new broadcasting stations in Fragrance, and had specifically requested blocks of air time during the afternoon and evening to use as she saw fit. That was what Cypress has summoned her to his office to discuss today; after all, the radio was one of the NAKP's most invaluable tools on properly educating and informing the kirin of Fragrance, and it wouldn't do to have anything undermine its unified message.\n\n"Radio Free Kiria," Springtime explained, "can be far more than just a tool of the NAKP. In fact, it needs to be if you want it to not only become successful, but profitable as well."\n\nThat raised Cypress' eyebrow. "Successful and profitable? It's already successful enough as it is. The news broadcasts, the talk shows, the educational programming—all of it is carefully curated to advance the official party stances of the NAKP. If it does that, then it serves its purpose of furthering our goals in the long-term."\n\n"For all your talk of free markets and self-regulation, you can be very hypocritical when it comes down to it, can't you?" Springtime rolled her eyes. "Here's my suggestion: allow independent broadcasters to purchase air time on the RFK's stations to air whatever they feel like. The NAKP will still, of course, maintain exclusive rights over the primetime hours, and nothing has to be cut from its programming to make room for this. That's why I reserved select hours for my own use when I helped set the system up: to hold them for independent broadcasting, free from NAKP censors. Within a month, the kirin of Fragrance and beyond will determine what gets broadcasted by consumer taste, and the ethos of supply and demand that the NAKP champions so fiercely. Sure, there may be some kirin with differing views who purchase air time, but the kirin who listen to the RFK will help the market to regulate their access and message to the realm. I see only positives from opening up the air waves in such a manner. How about you?""

kirin_council.21.d:0 "Heavenly Fire, Chief Magistrate of Rhapsody's Divine and Blessed Procurate, watched the scene unfolding in front of the Procurate's grand monastery with a wizened look of bemusement. Rhapsody stood at the center of the Plebiscite as the shining jewel of the Greater Providence region, and as such, both the NAKP and Vermilion loyalists had campaigned hard to sway the votes of the kirin living in the city. That, of course, meant that prominent figures from both sides were regular fixtures in the city, but it seemed like nokirin except for her had the foresight to imagine what would happen if Fickle Current and Matriarch Superior Rain Shine crossed paths in the city. And it was a good thing she had imagined such a possibility, because it was happening right before her eyes.\n\nOn one side of the monastery's great courtyard stood Fickle Current, surrounded by his NAKP cronies and rank and file members who were more than willing to engage in mob violence if their Chairkirin demanded it; on the other, Rain Shine and several mystics and diplomats from Vermilion stood in the center of a ring of disciplined Banner soldiers, outnumbered by the NAKP's side but more than willing to rise to the challenge in the defense of their Matriarch. Between them, Heavenly Fire had directed Rhapsody's Guards Vigilant to keep the two parties separated lest somekirin do something everykirin would soon regret. And with a crowd gathered around the perimeter and growing by the minute, Heavenly knew that the news of what happened here today would very quickly spread its way across Kiria and then throughout the world like an uncontrollable wildfire.\n\nStill, she sensed an opportunity for a bit of showmareship that would benefit Rhapsody by bringing even more attention to her city, and so she dispatched acolytes to both sides with a modest proposal. It didn't take long before they returned to her with the responses of each side, and she allowed herself a small smile through chapped lips on her wrinkled muzzle. She issued one last command, and soon, several more acolytes brought out a beautiful zitan wood table and a pair of matching chairs. They positioned them under a great sandalwood tree in the middle of the courtyard, and soon Rain Shine and Fickle Current emerged from their respective crowds to meet in the middle. Then, they sat down, and with scribes standing nearby to write down every word, they each began to debate their stances on the Plebiscite."

kirin_council.22.d:0 "There was no form to the debate, no structure to adhere to; the conversation that arose between Fragrance's exceptionally educated, traveled, and shrewd businesskirin and Vermilion's reserved, cloistered, yet keen divine avatar of Concord took some time to find its hoofing, but once the smalltalk was out of the way, both kirin dived into the matter at hoof. Both delivered versions of the remarks they had campaigned to the kirin of Greater Providence, with Fickle Current emphasizing the cultural differences and distinctions between the kirin north of the Great Mellifluve watershed and those within it, while Rain Shine hammed home the basic fact that they were all kirin, and unlike those who had been led astray in the west, devotion to Concord and The Way of Fire was as strong a unifying force as any throughout the Realm of Kiria. But it wasn't until almost a solid hour of patient back-and-forth, of position, jab, and deflection, that Rain Shine found an opening to gain the upper hoof in the debate.\n\nAfter whittling away at Current's defenses by pressuring him into explaining what the kirin of his ancestral homeland meant to him when he had been born in distant Griffonia, Rain Shine immediately seized on Current turning the question back on her, and her lips curled into a pleased smirk before softening into a mother's caring smile. "No matter what happens in this vote, all the citizens of Kiria will be my precious Kirin. I think it is no secret to anykirin present that every day I watch my beloved Realm tearing itself apart with war and ideology is another day that I quietly suffer at the thought of the misery my subjects are forced to endure. Kiria, I love you; nocreature in the world can deny that. My love for you will always be firm and unconditional, and if the kirin of the north seek to part ways with me, I am willing to let you go. I do not wish to force anykirin into something they do not wish to be a part of. Sometimes love means letting your children find their own way in life. I only ask that you ask yourselves if this is what you really want, if you really want to part ways with me. Do not let anykirin else tell you what you should think or what you should believe; only ask yourself if you share their beliefs, and you agree that they have your best interests in mind. And only then, I feel, will you be able to make a decision that you can live with, not one that you made simply because you were pressured to do so."\n\nThe look on Fickle Current's face told her everything she needed to know, and the applause from the gathered crowd was proof that her riposte had hit her mark. Though Current was quick to try and dismiss her speech as just a veiled attempt to guilt kirin into staying with Vermilion, Rain Shine knew it would be her words, and not Current's, that would be broadcast throughout the Realm in the days to come."

The teahouse was alive with chatter from its many patrons, and River did enough talking for two; apart from positing a question or leaving a comment here or there, Mayflower was free to enjoy her tea as she listened.\n\nThe radio in the corner of the teahouse crackled to life with the fanfare heralding an announcement from the NAKP, and the teahouse grew quieter as kirin stopped their conversations to listen to what it had to say. When the music was finally over, a mare's voice jumped on the airwaves, lightly colored with static from the distant transmission. "Modernisation! It's what the NAKP stands for!" the voice said, full of energy and pride. "While the rest of the Realm languishes in yesterday, the NAKP is driving Greater Providence forward into the world of tomorrow! That's why Chairkirin Fickle Current signed the Three Moderns program to accelerate the renewal of our society. And just what are these 'Three Moderns', you might be asking yourself? Well, it's simple: modern industry, modern society, and modern Providence. Under Chairkirin Current's ambitious program, the NAKP will strive to expand our industry, transform our society, and create a new Greater Providence that will be the envy of the world!\n\n"But he can't do it alone!" the mare continued. "He needs your help to make it happen! That's why the Chairkirin is asking for every patriotic mare, stallion, and foal to make a donation to their local party branches. Modernising Providence is a daunting task, but with your contributions, we can bring our dreams a little closer to reality! So what are you waiting for, my fellow patriots? Support the NAKP today!"\n\nThe announcement concluded with some more music, and River turned back to Mayflower with a sparkle in her eyes. "The NAKP does so much for us," she said. "We should try to return the favor. Say... didn't you say that you have family helping them out in Fragrance? You're a scientist! You should join them, too!"\n\nMayflower thought about it for a moment. Her cousin was one of the NAKP's top economists; maybe he'd be able to land her a job? "It's worth a try," Mayflower said.

He could tell by the mixture of expressions on the board's faces that what he proposing elicited interest, disgust, and a little bit of everything in between. When he decided that he'd given them enough time to gather the general gist of the document, he interrupted them with the explanation he'd spent the previous night perfecting. "We can hardly claim to be a modern and cosmopolitan future for Kiria if we do not embrace the trappings of enfranchisement," he announced, tapping his hooves together. "The Realm as it stands is entangled in religious-fundamentalism and superstition. The many priests and mystics of The Way of Fire hold disproportionate sway over the common kirin, and when one backs their teachings with the will of a supreme being, the populace becomes a very stupid beast to control. But if we introduce the right to vote to the kirin of the Realm, empower them with the notion that their beliefs can change the world, we accomplish two goals: we strip power away from the priests that govern the Realm, and we give our people a stake in their government, investing them in its defence in a way we could never accomplish before."\n\n"But what if subversive voices gain sway?" one of the kirin sitting at the table asked. "Dissent could amplify like never before, and even in a victory at the polls, large minority could spell a catastrophic blow to the legitimacy of the majority."\n\n"Which is why enfranchisement will be limited," Fickle Current explained. "Local and regional positions are the most visible to the populace but the least impactful on national policy; we shall let them have as much say at the local level as they want. But positions in the upper echelons of the NAKP will require party membership to vote on and run for, and the Executive Council will be our tool to control. I've had some clerks hard at work codifying its rules; so far, the first draft is as thick as a phonebook. Nokirin will ever be able to read it front to back and figure out how it works. That gives us leeway to maintain our grip on the country's policy. Please feel free to read it if you like, but I wouldn't worry about it if I were you. Wealth, above everything else, still determines the makeup of the Council."\n\nThe rest of the councilkirin slowly nodded, satisfied, and Fickle felt a smile curl the corners of his lips. What he neglected to mention was that he codified the powers of the Chairkirin to directly appoint three out of the ten seats on the Executive Council and remove them at will. Power like that would all but ensure his grip on the NAKP would remain unchallenged."

"How much fighting have you done in your life, Chairkirin? Leave the management of the Order to the professionals."\n\n"Are you a professional, Tempered Steel?" Current asked her, an eyebrow raising. "As far as your record goes, you're a mercenary who took the chance the NAKP offered you to make your own paramilitary militia. That is why I'm requesting that you acquiescence with the Executive Council's latest decree. The Order of the Iron Chrysanthemum is an invaluable tool to the NAKP; it allows us to enforce our will where regular soldiers aren't suited. What I want to do is take it to the next level. We will reform it into a proper paramilitary formation with its own strict military hierarchy, induction requirements based on donation, and mandated military training in tactics and logistics for all of its officers. I will not have wealthy civilian soldiers who will spend a Saturday afternoon ordering their own brigade of armed soldiers about as they please, but a disciplined, drilled, and dedicated fighting force ready to answer the beck and call of the NAKP. These reforms will require some pruning of the unsavory elements of the Order, but rest assured, you will remain its leader, and you will only answer to the Chairkirin, who happens to be standing right in front of you. I'll even authorize some funds to use at your discretion to kickstart these reforms. Does that sound agreeable to you, commander, or shall I find somekirin else to lead my new Order?"\n\nAfter a moment, Tempered Steel blinked, awkwardly chuckled, and scratched her hoof against her opposite foreleg. "Uh... yeah, actually, now that you say it outland. I've always been looking forward to taking the next step. The Order has so much more to offer the NAKP. I merely assumed that you were confronting me about the Orders, well, less-than-legal 'trading' business."\n\n"Your smuggling runs?" This time it was Current's turn to smirk. "Who do you think signs off on the shipping manifests when they enter Fragrance's markets? Who do you think frees up cargo space on our chartered ships for a little extra room in the hold when they travel to Skyfall? One way or another, that money makes its way into Fragrance's economy... and there's nothing wrong with that, now is there?""

kirin_council.26.t:0 "The Assembly's Allowance"
kirin_council.26.d:0 "The representatives trickled in from all throughout the northern reaches of the Realm of Kiria, from the land that was de facto under the control of the NAKP. They all made the pilgrimage from their towns and villages to Fragrance, where they gathered in the city's grand town hall to conduct their business. The chamber floor was a little too small for everykirin present, but they made do nonetheless, as no kirin was willing to miss out on the first gathering of the Assembly of North Kiria just to get a little more personal space.\n\nThey were kirin from society's upper echelons, whether they be business owners, wealthy donors, or influential spiritual leaders, and they had all been elected by the kirin of the towns they represented. But they all had one thing in common, even beyond that: they were all present by the good graces of the NAKP, which had actively campaigned on their behalf to their constituents as a reward for adhering to the party dogma. This week, the NAKP had summoned them all to Fragrance to discuss the state of the northern Realm under Fragrance's dominion, and they would spend the rest of the week identifying problems and proposing solutions to the party leadership, which would eventually take them up the chain of command to the Executive Council and the Chairkirin, provided that their resolutions were deemed important enough to take time out of those kirins' busy schedules to address them.\n\nBut independent of that, the NAKP had also placed a measure on the Assembly for it to address itself. The matter concerned how to utilize the budget the NAKP was willing to dedicate for the Assembly to use to address the nation's problems, now and in the future. Three camps very swiftly formed in the hours of debate that were consumed by this one topic. The first proposed to use the money to repair the damage from the unrest and turmoil of the civil war, improving the quality of life for kirin throughout the north and minimizing the disruption of the ongoing conflict. The second suggested instead on using the money to bolster the military to better provide for the protection of their citizens and quell any unrest from subversive activities. The third and final group suggested instead to use this money to invest in the functions of the Assembly in the future, arguing that wise investment would allow the Assembly to become independent of NAKP funding and allow it to address a wider range of problems in the future."

kirin_council.27.t:0 "Standing Together, Separately"
kirin_council.27.d:0 "The meeting thus far had been far smoother than either Fern Flare or Fickle Current had imagined it would be. Tense, certainly, but quite smooth, all things considered. Fern had been surprised Current had made the pilgrimage to Vermilion to seek reconciliation between the Kirin capital and Fragrance, and Current had been surprised to find Autumn's closest advisor serving in her stead as Premier of Kiria. Perhaps both kirin had been most surprised about how willing the other side had been to reach an agreement to slowly stitch Fragrance back into the Realm.\n\n"If I may ask... why?" Fern Flare abruptly questioned, interrupting the minutiae of hashing out a treaty of cooperation and friendship between Vermilion and Fragrance. "When the Grand Gallop Onward fell apart, you and all of your cronies fled Vermilion and cleaved the north off of the Matriarch's realm. And now you want to come back?"\n\n"It's more complicated than you would think," Current said, following a moment's hesitation. "The kirin of Greater Providence want many things, but war with Vermilion is not one of them. The Matriarch Superior is, and always will be, our spiritual leader and unifying icon. Making war against her is a cultural blasphemy that not even a century of living in Griffonia can shake from us in the Diaspora. On top of that, war is only profitable if you're a third party, not if your lives are being lost and your infrastructure ruined in vicious fighting. But, perhaps most importantly, the potential for a future Kiria dominated by the Rising Fire is a thought none of us can bear."\n\nHe sighed, and he loosened his tie with a tug of magic. "Personally, I feel many of my colleagues in the upper echelons of the NAKP have lost their nerve. For all their bluster and bravado, war is not something they wanted to entertain having only recently returned to our homeland. But if we work with Vermilion, and offer all the resources we have at our disposal, we should be able to crush these heretics before it becomes deadly enough to be called a war."\n\n"I hope so, too," Fern Flare agreed. "It's been centuries since kirin have fought kirin like this. Hopefully by working together, we can keep this from getting any worse.""
kirin_council.27.a:0 "Better the enemy we know than the one we don't."
kirin_council.27.b:0 "There's still hope the Realm can come together again."

kirin_council.28.t:0 "Independence Without Fanfare"
kirin_council.28.d:0 "Chairkirin Fickle Current stood by the window in the boardroom, choosing instead to look outside at the sprawling city of Fragrance while the rest of the NAKP's executive council reviewed the final draft for Fragrance's impending declaration of independence from Vermilion's rule. It was a gray day: the clouds were gray, the streets were gray, the buildings were gray, even the mood was gray. There was no rain, and barely a whisper of wind, but the air hung heavy with what might have been, and what had been avoided.\n\nIt was a necessary step; of that, Current had no doubt. Fragrance and the natives of Greater Providence had been allowed to declare their de facto independence from Vermilion, in exchange for curbing the ambitions of the NAKP and respecting the right of Vermilion's rule over the Realm of Kiria. There were many in the party who longed for a war of domination over Vermilion, but more reasonable voices had correctly concluded that war would be a risky endeavor more expensive than it was worth pursuing. Instead, Fragrance was to join Vermilion in crushing the heretic threat in the west, and could now devote its resources toward domestic projects. One dream that could still be realized was the cultivation of the distinct kirin cultural identity of Greater Providence, that domain that existed north of the Great Mellifluve's watershed. It could let Fragrance chart a new course for the future, one that recognized the needs and attitudes of the kirin of the north, rather than subordinating them to the whims of Vermilion in the south. The clouds were gray, but instead of rain, maybe they would break up and let in some sunlight...\n\nWhen the matter was settled, another proposal was raised by one of the executives: would Vermilion appreciate a gift of materiel aid to soften the blow? If Fragrance could spare guns and other war equipment, it might smooth the declaration over with Vermilion. After all, it wouldn't do to try to cooperate to destroy the heretics but always looking over one's shoulder for a knife in the back..."
kirin_council.28.a:0 "Vermilion has never come to our aid. They're indebted to us as is."
kirin_council.28.b:0 "The Rising Fire threat goes beyond old history. Send them what we can."

kirin_council.29.t:0 "Hardly Relaxing"
kirin_council.29.d:0 "It took Fern Flare little difficulty to track Autumn Blaze down with the latest news from Fragrance. Her close friend, though still officially Kiria's Premier, could either be found in one of two places: her residence in Vermilion, or in the hot springs near the palace. Today, the mare was in the latter, sitting in a spring in a quiet corner of the bathing area up to her shoulders in the hot water. When Fern announced her presence with a quiet cough, Autumn flinched, but upon recognizing her friend, she relaxed slightly, if not by much. "Are you here to join me, Fern?" Autumn asked. "Or is it about my... job."\n\nShe shuddered as she said the last word, and it hurt Fern to see her feel nothing but worry and dismay about the role she'd once taken so enthusiastically to. Hopefully that would resolve itself in time, but Kiria could ill-afford to wait until Autumn pulled herself together. "The NAKP issued a declaration of its independence yesterday," Fern informed her. "It was a simple statement, not quite as bombastic as many of us thought it was going to be. But it means the same, with or without pomp. Fragrance refuses to take orders from Vermilion anymore."\n\nAutumn sighed and sank deeper into the water, until the steamy water lapped at the bottom of her muzzle. "Anything else?" she muttered, refusing or unable to look Fern in the eyes.\n\n"They... offered us weapons and supplies to help stabilize the Realm," Fern said. "Fragrance wants to see a stable and safe Vermilion. It's better for business that way. They wouldn't get any business with the Rising Fire, after all. What should we tell them?"\n\nFern could tell that Autumn wanted nothing more than to slip beneath the waters and stay there as long as she could, but both kirin knew Fern would still be waiting for her answer when she resurfaced. "I'm tempted to refuse," Autumn admitted. "Fickle Current betraying us put Vermilion in such dire straits to begin with. And now he wants to make it up to us with guns? They're part of the problem, and their generosity isn't the solution. But..." she sighed again. "Can we really afford to spurn generosity at this point?""
kirin_council.29.a:0 "We need everything we can get, even from those who betrayed us once."
kirin_council.29.b:0 "Fickle Current's gifts are always poisoned. We refuse."

kirin_council.30.t:0 "Kiria Refuses Our Gifts"
kirin_council.30.d:0 "Vermilion officially responded to our offers of providing them equipment and material with a polite declination. Why Vermilion would repudiate our gifts is anykirin's guess, but it likely has to deal with the tense issue surrounding our secession. Premier Autumn Blaze supposedly feels betrayed by our secession from Vermilion's authority, and any recognition of our gift could be seen as tacit recognition of the legitimacy of our independence. Whatever their reasons, Chairkirin Fickle Current has already taken steps to make sure that this equipment doesn't go to waste."
kirin_council.30.a:0 "At least we've avoided war with Vermilion."

kirin_council.31.t:0 "Trickle Down or Well Up?"
kirin_council.31.d:0 "Fickle Current considered himself a shrewd businesskirin, but even he had to admit that he wasn't the most skilled at manipulating numbers. The NAKP's chief economist, on the other hoof, was practically a wizard when it came to Fragrance's finances. Dr. Ardent Bloom's office was filled with boxes stuffed with reams of finance records, economy predictions, and more business dealings than one could shake a stick at. He was also certain that countless under the table agreements were written down on paper somewhere in Dr. Bloom's cluttered office, the kind that had the potential to bankrupt even the most powerful of the trading houses. How he kept it all under control was beyond him.\n\nBut he hadn't gone to see the economist just to comment on his office clutter. Instead, he had gone to him for advice. "The legal teams are working on codifying the laws of our independence, and making our statement a reality," Current explained to the doctor, who watched him with polite interest but kept a pen scratching away at a piece of paper with his magic all the while. "But if we're going to proclaim our independence, then we need to do something to make it mean something real to the kirin of Greater Providence. We need to embark on renewed industrialization efforts, pick up the pieces from Vermilion's failed experiment. You know the financial situation of the NAKP better than anykirin. What's your recommendation?"\n\n"Depends on how ambitious you are," Ardent Bloom answered him, and his magic collected a few folders from different boxes around his office. He spread them out before Current, though he continued to talk while Current leafed through their contents. "The free market is a wonderful thing, and it follows the money regardless of where it leads. Industrializing the north will be profitable... eventually. Companies will make safe investments in new industry, and when those labors bear fruit, they'll reinvest it back into the economy. This trickle down effect will achieve a powerful industrial base in time. But, if you're willing to offer them incentives, they'll happily take more risks and speed things up a little. The best way to get a corporation whose sole function is to turn profits for its shareholders to take a risk is to let them do it on somekirin else's credit. Question is... are you willing to give them your letter of credit?""
kirin_council.31.a:0 "The NAKP will offer incentives to speed things up."
kirin_council.31.b:0 "We'll get the best return on our investment by staying patient."

kirin_council.32.t:0 "Fragmented Growth"
kirin_council.32.d:0 "Fickle Current was swiftly growing to loathe puzzles. Assembling a functional state following its severance from the host nation was like trying to assemble a colossal jigsaw puzzle, only to find out that half of the pieces were in another box. It took trial and error to find which pieces matched with each other, but with the additional threat that he could only try so many times before the pieces broke and the picture would forever be tarnished, if it was even completed it all.\n\nHis current issue was one that required a delicate touch and a couple dozen more jigsaw pieces to painstakingly fit into the puzzle. Greater Providence was a patchwork of regions and subdivisions, each with their own government, laws, and civil bodies, shackled to unique cultural quirks and differing economic drivers. Applying one broad policy over such a patchwork of states would likely be beneficial to some and detrimental to others, and the disparity could hamper the effectiveness of the measure at large. Instead, the best way forward was to rely on and encourage the independent growth of these states. The free market would carve out its niches in the north and settle enterprises into regions that best suited their needs and goals. But, as with everything else, such measures would take time.\n\nCurrent frowned as he thought about it. Time was a valuable commodity, maybe even more so than wealth. Doubtless the growth of these patchwork regions could be accelerated with the right incentives to adventurous businesses. But was such an investment wise? Would its return be worth the amount of capital it would take to successfully incentivize the trading houses to develop the north?"
kirin_council.32.a:0 "You have to spend money to make money!"
kirin_council.32.b:0 "The states will grow with time and competition, as always."

kirin_council.33.t:0 "Stopping the Bloodletting"
kirin_council.33.d:0 "Envoys from the city of Fragrance, sent out on behalf of Fickle Current, Chairkirin of the NAKP, arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName], seeking to attempt a diplomatic resolution to end the bloodshed that has engulfed the Realm in the War of the Double Secession. Chairkirin Current is willing to mediate an end to the war in Fragrance, expressing the urgency with which the war needs to be concluded. If the conflict continues to drag on, famine, disease, and anarchy will cripple the Realm, and leave us fighting over a pile of ashes. Is ruling the ruins of Kiria really worth fighting for more than what we already have?\n\nCurrent's envoys have also come prepared with preliminary terms to begin negotiations with. First and foremost, Vermilion and Chrysanthemum will have to recognize the right of the other to exist, and promise not to suppress the rights of followers of The Way of Fire and The Rising Fire in their respective territories. Additionally, a more favorable border will be established between our domains by Vermilion ceding Verdant to Chrysanthemum and the rule of The Rising Fire. In exchange, Rising Sun will protect the rights of free navigation up and down the Great Mellifluve to all nations, and will refrain from attempting to expand her influence beyond the banks of the Great Mellifluve, with the exception of any territory acquired from Vermilion over the course of the war, which she will be allowed to keep. Lastly, the proposed treaty urges each party to make a promise to mediate any future disputes through diplomatic channels and not through the use of force.\n\nThe treaty is an interesting proposal, and offers us a way out of the bloodshed. But it is unlikely to be popular with our people; we have fought for so much, and what we will be settling for is much less than we promised them. But is the price of continuing the war too steep? And how can we trust the other side?"
kirin_council.33.a:0 "We must accept, for the good of the Realm."

kirin_council.34.d_1:0 "Fickle Current was up before dawn, and after failing to go back to sleep, he decided to start his day before the sun rose. After eating something light for breakfast, he left his home behind and went for a pre-dawn trot. His path took him down to the sandy shores outside of the city limits, where he was all alone save for scuttling crabs and the crashing of waves against the beaches. Eventually, he stopped and sat down on the sand, his gaze turned toward the east, waiting for the sun to reveal itself on the dark horizon. It gave him time to reflect on all he had accomplished so far as the NAKP's unquestioned chairkirin.\n\nWar had come to Kiria for the first time in centuries; now, it was over. He may have helped escalate it by organizing Fragrance's secession when the Grand Gallop Onward failed, but he had played a decisive role in ending it. The threat posed by the Rising Fire had been largely neutralized, and peace had once more returned to the Realm. And it was thanks to his efforts that it was so; he knew he would be remembered for many, many years because of what he had accomplished.\n\nBut it was not without some chafing and disagreement from within the party. Current had had to cut deals as he could and make compromises to keep much of what he'd gained for Fragrance. Submission to Vermilion as the Viceroyalty of Greater Providence had been seen by many in the party as a stab in the back to the idea of an independent Fragrance, but the reality had been that there was no other choice. Fragrance had been too weak to survive on its own, and only in submission to Vermilion would it be allowed to keep much of the freedom Current had bought it. But the kirin of Greater Providence were still proud of what he had secured for them: pride in their northern identity, pride in its recognition from Vermilion, pride in the safe and predictable future Current had promised them. Their futures would be bright and profitable, and at the end of the day, was that not all that they wanted?\n\nThe sun began to rise, an orange glow on the horizon, slowly growing brighter as the minutes passed. As Current felt its light begin to warm his coat, he allowed himself a smile. In Kiria's hour of darkness, Fragrance had been its beacon of hope and peace. It had positioned itself as an ideal for all kirin nations to model themselves after, a rational and logical nation ruled by reason, not superstition and religious dogma. Perhaps, in the end, that was all that mattered."

Would it have been worth it to jeopardize their independence for the sake of greed?

Nokirin alive questions that she made warfare an art, but the execution of her plans to their successful conclusions was helped along greatly by the impulsive rage of her rivals slipping into the nirik form in the midst of combat..."\n\nCypress Snow took a sip of his matcha tea as he watched two of his old friends debate the skill and accolades of many famous military minds throughout world history. It was nice to have them and many other of his Literati friends together under one roof again, and even better that they could finally do so in Kiria. Many of them had feared that they would not live long enough to see this day; some of them didn't. Those lost friends were dearly missed, but Cypress knew they were with them in spirit. If the Way of Fire mystics were to be believed, they lived on in the primordial spark of the kirin race, returned to the fire from which they were born, and the fire that lived inside the breast of every kirin.\n\nThe topic of conversation had drifted hither and thither throughout the afternoon, though recent events had settled it on military matters. It was no secret that things were tense between the NAKP and the government back in Vermilion; at this point, war was less a question of "if" but "when". He decided to clear his throat and head off any more talk of military matters before it grew heated. "Friends, I am glad to have you all here, although I wish it were under better circumstances," he proclaimed, interrupting the ongoing argument. "We've come from many trots of life: professors, corporate advisors, historians, and many more. And now we're all reunited in service of the NAKP and making Kiria what we've always dreamed it should be. But for now, let's not let our talk linger on the art of war.

"Allowing kirin to buy their way out of the conscription lottery was a genius move. Mixing a sense of patriotic duty in contributing to the war chest along with the option to exempt your family from military service has meant war bond purchases have risen over 500% in the past month alone. It's a win-win for both sides: the NAKP gets the money we need to buy guns and continue our armament effort, and our beloved donors get to keep their sons and daughters off of the front lines."\n\n"Indeed," Survey agreed. "I just hope that this doesn't thin the ranks too much."\n\n"Why would it?" Dr. Bloom asked. "It doesn't mean the lottery pulls fewer numbers.

kirin_council.37.d:0 "Radios all throughout much of the Greater Providence realm sprung to life just after dinnertime, heralding the important message with the usual fanfare played across the airwaves. "Good evening, fillies and gentlecolts throughout our beloved Realm!" the announcer's voice greeted with a crackle of static. "Tonight, we have a very special program for you. Our very own Chairkirin, Fickle Current, will be discussing an important question with Dr. Cypress Snow: what makes a kirin? I won't keep the answer to that question from you, and instead I'll turn the microphone over to the Chairkirin. Chairkirin Current, Dr. Snow, the show's all yours."\n\n"Thank you," Fickle Current said. "So, Dr. Snow. Let's skip the introductions; everykirin listening in now knows who we both are. Let's dive right into the heart of the topic at hoof: what is the nature of the kirin spirit?"\n\n"It's a simple answer with many layers to it," Cypress responded. "The outermost layer is perhaps the easiest for everykirin listening at home to understand: we are Concord's chosen people. We are the keepers of Her will, the custodians of the Primordial Fire that birthed the world. Out of all the creatures that inhabit this world, from ponies to griffons to zebras, it was the kirin species that Concord bestowed Her most powerful gift: our flame, our fury, our passion."\n\n"And yet we have all been taught since we were foals to refrain from using Her gift," Fickle Current countered. "The nirik state is a terrible blight."\n\n"To call it a blight is a misconception, one pushed by The Way of Fire," Cypress said, delivering the counterpoint with practiced ease. "Our fire and fury is a tool, not a curse. It is, however, a dangerous one. An axe is a tool that can kill, but it can also shape and create. So too must we use our passion wisely to create, not destroy. In the late 800s, the Realm was on par with Equestria for technological supremacy, thanks to our investments in steam and clockwork technology, but The Silence cost us a century of valuable time. Imagine what could have been but for misplaced superstition!"\n\n"I can, and I encourage everykirin listening at home to do the same," Current said. "The NAKP is the harbinger of a new future for Kiria, and we all have a part to play to make it a reality. We must cast down the heretical Rising Fire and cleanse the ranks of the Way of Fire of those who bury the Realm in superstition for their own gain. We must strive to unite Kiria under its rule and purge the misguided elements that have held us back for so long. That is our destiny, and I have no doubt that the enlightened kirin of Greater Providence will be the ones that lead the Realm back into the glory we deserve.""

kirin_council.38.d:0 "Mayflower Bloom didn't know what to expect when she heard that her cousin had become an officer in the Order of the Iron Chrysanthemum, but even Ardent Bloom dressed in full officer's garb standing across from her in the kitchen of her home in Fragrance somehow didn't feel real. "You like it, May?" he asked her, and he smirked as he held out a foreleg to show off the epaulettes on his shoulder.\n\nMayflower suppressed an amused snort and tried to hide the look on her face by turning back to the tea she was preparing for the two of them. "I didn't take you for an army type, Ardent. How in the world did you end up as a... what did you say it was? Brigand-General?"\n\n"Brigadier-General," Ardent clarified with an annoyed growl. "And I'll tell you how. With war on the horizon, the NAKP was looking to make the Order of the Iron Chrysanthemum a more professional force to be the tip of the spear. Yesterday, the Order was just a bunch of street thugs, bandits, and yes, brigands, hastily assembled into a kind of informal police force to do the party's bidding. But now that the Order's putting together the Death's Head Brigade, they needed money to lure some of the best marines the trading houses have to offer into its ranks, and to equip them with the best Griffonian ordnance we could buy. So I made a contribution, and they awarded me with a rank befitting of my gift."\n\n"And how much was that?" Mayflower asked, finally finishing their tea and pouring it into two waiting cups. From everything it sounded like, nokirin was going to listen to somekirin who bought their rank when it came time to fight, least of all Ardent, who was more at home in his spreadsheets and ledgers than he was on the battlefield.\n\n"A little more than a week's worth of pay," Ardent said with a shrug, but he quickly chased it off with a smile. "But this is just the beginning. Right now, the Order has to buy the best from elsewhere, and it needs the money to do that. One day, though, the true patriots of Kiria will produce the best equipment and the best soldiers the world has ever seen!""

kirin_council.39.t:0 "Beggar at the Ball"
kirin_council.39.d:0 "Fickle Current hurriedly flagged down the cocktail waitress and exchanged his empty glass of champagne for another one, immediately taking a few quick gulps. What was it, his fourth of the night? Fifth? He didn't know, and it was probably better that way. His nerves were fraying, and though he was hardly a heavy drinker, he was reaching for something to help soothe them. After all, he was about to make a very difficult request, and the hit to his reputation would take some time to recover.\n\nHe looked out at all the kirin slowly filing into the grand ballroom of 88 Chrysanthemum Plaza, many of them clutching drinks in their colorful magical auras, and all of them dressed to the nines. They were all members of the pinnacle of modern kirin society, the highest of the Diaspora's high society, and they had all paid 5000 Griffonian idols a head to attend the night's fundraising festivities. And here Current was about to ask them for more.\n\nWhen they had all gathered into the ballroom, Current took the microphone to thank them for their charity and give them all a pat on the back for having the means to afford the exorbitant entrance fee, as he knew all socialite types craved. That part of the speech was easy; then came the hard part. "And now, I'd like to remind everykirin of the reason why we're having this ball tonight, and how much more we all have to give to make our dreams a reality," he said, steeling himself for the inevitable reproachful looks from those gathered before him. "We will soon be finding ourselves in a war, and a very expensive one at that. Suffice it to say, the coffers of the NAKP are simply inadequate for waging war against our foes in Vermilion. Therefore, I regretfully ask of you all if you have anything else you can spare for the war effort, the NAKP will be greatly appreciative of any and all contributions. When the war is won, we will, of course, remember your generosity in the future."\n\nThe scoffs from the gathered kirin and the sniffs of disgust made Current feel like somekirin was pulling his scales off one by one with a pair of pliers, but he did his best to maintain a smile through their murmuring. That was nothing, however, compared, to the words he overhead Silver Silks, heiress to the Sycee Trading House and the single wealthiest kirin present at the party, mutter to her friends. "Begging is quite unbecoming of the Chairkirin, wouldn't you agree? I suppose we should give him what he wants. Elsewise, he may become even more desperate at the next gala, and that just won't do at all."\n\nTheir tittering bit deep, but Current swallowed that embarrassment regardless. If the NAKP didn't get the funds it needed to fight the war, then it was doomed anyway."

kirin_council.40.d:0 ""I hate being in debt," Fickle Current announced to Ardent Bloom as he paced in the latter's office. "Business deals are one thing. Debts change with time. They're unpredictable, and you don't know what you're in for when the debt is called." He sighed and shook his head. "But it's a necessary evil, is it not? We need overseas investors, and our contacts in Griffonia are happy to give us funds if we lease them land, property, and resources as collateral. If we lose, we won't have to worry about our creditors in Skyfall or Flowena calling due, but if we win..."\n\n"There is another option that's not with our usual Griffonian contacts," Ardent said, steepling his hooves as he considered whether or not to press forward. But at Current's curious look, he continued. "The Changelings have caught wind of our offer. I don't know how, but when you're dealing with a race of shapeshifting insects, I suppose it only makes sense that they would. They're interested, and they're offering exceedingly generous terms."\n\n"How generous?" Current asked. In his experience, the more generous the terms, the larger the knife hidden behind a creature's back.\n\n"They want the same things as our Griffonian business partners, but they're more interested in property than resources, and they're willing to pay more for it — much more. But..." Here he hesitated, then sighed and continued. "They're negotiating through Main Hive Industries, their largest industrial conglomerate. It's all run through one bug named Finicus Vesali, and I'll warn you, he's no slouch when it comes to the negotiating table. He probably knows how to cut a deal as well as you do, Current. Long story short, I don't trust them."\n\n"And to make a short story slightly longer?" Current asked, raising an eyebrow.\n\n"Well, the Changelings, unlike Skyfall or Flowena, have the means to collect if we don't pay up," Bloom said. "And they want land more than anything else. You'd think an industrial powerhouse like them would want resources above anything else. Something's fishy, and I don't like it... but at the end of the day, it's your call.""

kirin_council.41.d:0 "There was very little that Dr. Ardent Bloom liked about the creature sitting across the table from him. Sure, it resembled an equine, but the insectoid facsimile created an 'almost but not quite' appearance of a pony or kirin that it bothered him. But even moreso than his appearance was his shrewd intelligence and clever wit, forcing Ardent to use every scrap of resourcefulness and experience to keep up with the deal-cutting businessbug.\n\n"You can drop out at any time, and we'll terminate the contract," Finicus Vesali said to him, and not for the first time, turning those words into a threat pressuring Ardent to do the opposite and uphold the deal as agreed upon. "But of course, we'll have to resolve all the clauses in our agreement. The NAKP will be held responsible for any damages to the equipment we're supplying to your factories, and it will be held accountable should any equipment produced here find its way onto the other side of a changeling battlefield. I think you'll agree that it's only fair to say that Kirin-made guns produced with Changeling-leased equipment taking Changeling lives on the field of battle is a messy can of worms that nocreature wants to open. Oh, and we maintain that we Changeling Queendom has the right to demand the immediate return of any and all equipment loaned to the NAKP for the duration of the contract. I hope this is all agreeable to you, Dr. Bloom?"\n\n"Yes, it is," Dr. Bloom managed through gritted teeth. He knew what was in the contract, so nothing Finicus said to him was a surprise or a lie, but having it read aloud to him made the walls of the box the Changelings were putting the NAKP all the more apparent. "Is there anything else, Herr Vesali?"\n\n"One last thing," and at this, Finicus smiled and set the pen held aloft in his magic down on the table. "The Foreign Office of the Changeling Heer asked me to convey a message while in Fragrance, so here I am, conveying it. In accordance with the secret treaties Vesalipolis has negotiated with Fragrance, the Queendom will be contributing an expeditionary force to support the NAKP's near-term combat activities. Of course, it goes without saying that the Korps will be commissioned as a 'non-state actor force' via the Liaison Office and its operating expenses covered in part by the NAKP. Now, if that's all in order... I believe we are finished here, unless you have anything to add, Dr. Bloom?""

kirin_council.42.t:0 "The Liaison Office for Military Commissions"
kirin_council.42.d:0 "Fickle Current had attended the opening of the Liaison Office for Military Commissions more out of a sense of obligation than any sort of respect or interest. It was a relatively small affair, not something that the NAKP had publicized to the common kirin. After all, the word 'mercenary' held a sour taste in the mouth of the average upstanding citizen, and that was the essential function of the Office: to organize, recruit, and supply mercenary companies that were willing to get their hooves or claws or what-have-you dirty in exchange for generous pay, no questions asked. Officially, these military units would consist of foreign volunteers sympathetic to the cause of the Association, which was technically true, but this pretext fooled nokirin.\n\nEven so, Current couldn't deny that it was a viable business model. The world was such a powder keg that there would always be a demand for soldiers of fortune, the willingness to pay for an elite force capable of greater things than the poorly-disciplined conscript armies of the world. Zebrica and Griffonia in particular were lands filled with conflict and strife, and there, an experienced mercenary company could be the means to alter the course of a war. And Kiria was no different."

kirin_council.43.t:0 "Corporate Contributions"
kirin_council.43.d:0 "Fickle Current was rarely intimidated. After all, as Chairkirin of the NAKP, his power in Fragrance's domains was almost absolute. But his power was still limited by those who pulled the strings behind the scenes, and right now, they were all in one room, and they were not pleased with him.\n\nSilver Silks, the heiress to the Sycee Trading House and quite possibly the wealthiest kirin in all of Kiria, had a scowl on her face, and there was a reason the ember at the end of the cigarette lodged in its jade holder burned blue and pink, not orange. "The NAKP's recent propaganda is a problem, Chairkirin. Your populist slogans are throwing dynamite into a hornet's nest, one that the corporations—your donors, mind you, and the ones who generate 45% of the NAKP's annual budget, by my last estimate—are standing under, unprotected. 'Patriotism', if that's what you call the anarchy you're fostering, is reaching such a feverish pitch that any action we take that the populace deems 'unpatriotic' will hurt our bottom line."\n\n"And that's exactly what you want, isn't it?" The new voice was from the quiet and diminutive stallion sitting at the far end of the table from Fickle Current, wearing a bronze-and-pewter monocle so broad and thick that it practically covered half his face. Fulgent Focus, one of the masters of the All-Kiria Artificers' Guild, seemingly shifted in anxiety as all eyes around the table turned toward him, but he pressed his point regardless. "Yours was a two-pronged attack, expertly executed. Your propaganda drives patriotism to such a fervent frenzy that anything deemed unpatriotic by the public is met with harsh criticism and repudiation, and you come directly to the leaders of the NAKP's most cherished corporate partners to ask us for money once the price of refusal is clear. Am I wrong to state that is the true purpose of this meeting?"\n\nFickle Current was cut off guard by Fulgent's surgical cleave right to the heart of the matter, and the honeyed words and clever talking points he'd practiced before the meeting were suddenly thrown out the window. "Well... yes, it is, Artificer Focus. No point in denying it now, since you've so clearly laid the stakes out on the table." Current stood up and leaned forward, placing his hooves on the finely veneered mahogany table. "I want the corporations to increase their donations to the NAKP. We need increased funding if we are going to fight and win a war that will by all estimates be incredibly destructive and deadly. I could go about raising funds through other means, such as increasing the corporate membership dues, but I think it's clear we would all prefer to trot out of this meeting with a consensual agreement rather than an imposed one.""

kirin_council.843.t:0 "Corporate Rights"
kirin_council.843.d:0 ""Bold talk," Silver Silks scoffed, a stream of cigarette smoke leaving her lips with her words. "I could have my shareholders fund your rivals instead of you, Chairkirin, and in six weeks' time, there'll be another kirin standing at the head of this table, in your place. What will we be getting out of this in return?"\n\n"Legal jurisdiction the likes of which the world has never seen before," Fickle Current stated, and despite the scowl she had a moment earlier, those words caused Silks' eyebrow to raise in interest. "In exchange for increased donations and public statements supporting the NAKP's claim to rule Kiria and unequivocal support for the party platform, the NAKP will use its regional bureaucrats and governors to enforce limited land requisitions on commonly-owned property within our jurisdiction, and transfer the deeds to our corporate donors in the name of development. We will further amend our constitution to extend corporate sovereignty over the lands bestowed upon you as payment. The land is yours to govern and manage as you please; any laws you create and administer will be enforced in supremacy of local laws in those territories."\n\n"Any laws?" Fulgent asked, and not without suspicion. "I fail to believe that the NAKP will be so laissez-faire with lands under its jurisdiction. And any seizure of lands under the domain of Rhapsody will not be accomplished without strenuous resistance; like all clerical types, the Procurate will not return power once granted so readily. Do not make promises that you are not ready to keep, Chairkirin."\n\n"I never do. Business dealings only go so far as one's word." Satisfied, Fickle Current took his hooves off the table and returned to his seat. "I'll have accountants and representatives hammer out the details with your people at a later date. But I think it's well-evident that the interests of the NAKP and our generous corporate allies follow close alignment. I don't imagine that we will have any issues fostering and maintaining an agreeable relationship, now and in the future. After all, prosperity for the NAKP means prosperity for you all, and vice-versa. Now... do we have a deal?""

kirin_council.44.t:0 "Lessons Learned from Griffon Failures"
kirin_council.44.d:0 "The chalk held in Cypress Snow's magical grasp scratched across the chalkboard as he underlined the letters 'GRIFFONIAN FAILURE' marked onto the slate. "The Griffonian Republican revolution in 978 was a failure that saw initial success but devolved into chaos and hopelessness by the time it had run its course," he proclaimed, and he turned to face the dozens of NAKP cadre and officers seated in the lecture hall before him. "The Griffonian Empire was once a strong, absolutist nation, but the inherent challenges of decentralization and the privileges of the vassals opened the door for revolutionary fervor that destroyed it from within. The natural order of society was upended, and during the vicious fighting between monarchists and republicans, the communists and trade unions, the red rats of society, grew exponentially in size and filled in all the cracks that had formed. Like water freezing in the cracks of great stones, they widened those cracks and wedged apart what was once a solid body. They thrive on instability and turmoil, breed in it, and it will no doubt happen to us when we march on Vermilion."\n\nThe chalk flew toward the words 'RISING FIRE' and circled it thrice before dropping back into the tray at the bottom of the chalkboard. "The Rising Fire claims to be a religious movement, but they are in reality a communist movement. They already have their spies whispering lies and treason in the ears of our workers here in Fragrance, promising the bloody glories of class struggle, of collectivism, of the despicable facade of 'creatures' rights'. It is not their interpretation of Concord's teachings that will be the menace of their legacy, but their Marksist-Stallionist ideology. As chaos reigns in the war, they will grow stronger, even as we march closer to victory. And so, it is important that we root it out now, before we march to war."\n\nCypress stomped a hoof on the ground to emphasize his point. "Communism is a disease, and like a disease, it will multiply endlessly until it is bested at great cost, or until it kills its host. But today, we shall inoculate Kiria against this disease. Each of you have a task at hoof to play in the coming hours. You have been chosen to lead the state's counteroffensive against the subversive elements in our midst. You will destroy the fifth column, and through its destruction, bring stability to our beloved Greater Providence and steel our resolve for the war to come. I bid you all good luck, and happy hunting.""

kirin_council.45.d:0 "The radio in Mayor Cherry Blossom's study sung its tinny fanfare, heralding an announcement from Chairkirin Fickle Current, but Fragrance's mayor couldn't muster the willpower to bother turning it off. After all, on or off, Current's voice still carried over the airwaves to the kirin of Fragrance—the kirin of the north, and the kirin Cherry was ostensibly elected to lead. But ever since the meteoric rise of the NAKP in Fragrance, the mayor found herself increasingly marginalized by the empowered party apparatus. Now, lacking the ability to even arrange a timely meeting with Fickle Current, much less summon him to her office, Cherry could only hold a one-sided conversation with the Chairkirin over the radio.\n\n"The constitutional principles of the Party-State are straightforward," Fickle Current said, the radio coloring his voice with static. "Everything the Party does is built around the idea that anykirin can have a path to success through hard work and individual grit. The free markets allow the kirin of the north to buy and sell to and from whom they please. The freedom to create and sign contracts allow kirin and businesses to add legal enforcement to any deals arranged by both sides. The right to work ensures that all kirin can pursue employment and not be coerced into joining unions and other bodies that would siphon off their hard-earned paychecks for the follies of collectivization. Together, these principles will allow us to reclaim the destiny of the kirin people as the hegemons of Eastern Zebrica, a status we were well on our way to claiming before the Silence interrupted our progress."\n\n"Will they, though?" Cherry murmured to herself, though she imagined having the opportunity to say those words to Fickle Current's face. "What of the commoners who work in your factories and plow your fields? What of the soldiers who die holding the guns you sold them? Who really gets the wealth and comfort you promise: the kirin of the north, or you and your cronies?"\n\nShe sighed and shook her head. "None of you were elected by the kirin of Fragrance," she grumbled, glaring down at her idle hooves. "You held party votes and referendums. I was chosen by the kirin of the city you rule over. But at the end of the day... what am I to the Party-State?""

The other night, he had finally decided to send a message to the pirate queen, Roaring Fire, using the enchanted jade candle she had given him after their meeting in Nacre. He'd wondered if he would ever get a response. To his surprise, one was quick in returning, instructing him to board an unassuming red and blue fishing junk in the waters just outside of Fragrance's harbor. He'd taken every precaution to ensure his safety, stationing boarding parties on nearby boats, sharpshooters on the rooftops of harborfront buildings, and even a diving team led by a hippogriff mercenary in the waters below the junk. Still, he had no idea what would happen when he stepped onto that boat. For all he knew, he'd be leaving it with his throat slit open, unceremoniously dumped into the water.\n\nThe rowboat he sat in bumped against the side of the junk, and moments later, a simple rope ladder was tossed over the side. Taking a deep breath to steel himself, Current hesitantly climbed up the ladder until he stood on the junk's rolling deck. The kirin onboard gave him quick glances, but otherwise pretended he wasn't there, leading to him heading for the open cabin door at the stern of the ship. When he opened it and stepped inside, he saw the mare he was looking for, kicking back in a wooden chair with her hooves on the table, still covered in her colorful and garish pirate attire.\n\n"Sit," Roaring Fire said, gesturing to a seat across the table from her. Then her magic pulled out two porcelain cups and poured rice wine from a jar into each. "Drink. After all, what better way to celebrate our new... let's call it a business venture. I know people like you like to keep your terminology clean, as if that changes the nature of the deal just because you call it one thing versus another."\n\n"What you call something matters very much to the kirin who hears its name," Fickle said, sitting down in the offered seat with a frown. He lifted the cup of rice wine to his nose, grimaced after taking a sip, and then forced himself to take a long sip of it. It was strong, much too strong for his tastes, but he went through with it as a common courtesy to the mare sitting across from him. "Let's cut to the meat of it, then. Tell me about your forces. What can you contribute to the war effort?"\n\n"Enough to matter, but not what you're likely hoping for." The pirate queen knocked back her cup of wine in a gulp, than poured another one and drained half of it before continuing. "Our junks aren't oceangoing cruise liners, and we had to scuttle a lot of our largest ships when we left Nacre. We have enough ships to keep ourselves afloat and in business to prey on merchant shipping, but not anything that could take a hit in a stand-up fight from a metal warship.""

What about it?"\n\n"What about it?" Fickle raised an eyebrow. "Do I need to spell it out? Having that on our side would be a great boon to the NAKP's merchant navy. You could scrape together a hundred wooden junks for me, and they wouldn't have anything near the value of that submarine. The Party would keep it fueled and supplied for you, and you'd be able to keep any salvage you can get your hooves on using it. That would make a difference for the war effort."\n\n"It would... if I still had it." While Current blinked in surprise, Fire downed her second cup of wine and started working on her third. "We had to leave the submarine behind when we left Nacre. We didn't have the fuel to maintain it, and replacement parts for a submarine are hard to come by out in the Kirin Sea. I hid it in a cove on the off-chance we'd be able to recover it someday, a chance that you just might be able to take for me." Then she lifted her legs from the table, and her chair slammed back onto all fours with a thud. The pirate queen leaned in over her teacup and raised an eyebrow at Current. "Get me that sub back and I'll make sure not a single ship gets to your enemies. But that's neither here nor there for the moment. In the meanwhile, I can help you in other ways as well. I can have my kirin patrol the waterways of the Great Mellifluve in our smaller junks, harassing supply lines, providing support for river crossings, the likes. Alternatively, I've had to double up on crews on some of my ships since we had to scuttle so many. They're experienced buccaneers, and they love a good fight. If you want, I can dock some of my junks and give you their crews to fight with. You provide us with equipment, I can give you a crack team of marines willing to fight better than any of those pansies you're bringing in from Griffonia.

She and her salvagers from the Sycee Trading House had followed the instructions passed along by the NAKP, unsure of what exactly they would find. But now, moored in the hidden harbor, she saw the prize, and understood why the NAKP had been so desperate to get its hooves on it.\n\nA submarine had been beached on the shoreline, and she recognized it as Feathesian in make from her type abroad in Griffonia. It had obviously been abandoned for some time, given the rust that had become to form over its hull, but at first glance, it at least looked intact. The name 'Dolfijn' had been painted on the side, and there was even a small pile of torpedoes, ammunition, and black barrels of oil stacked up in the back of the cove, well out of reach of the tides. Once all of that was loaded back onto the ship, they could have a tugboat drag it out of the cove and haul it back to Fragrance for repairs. In no time at all, it would be seaworthy again, and the NAKP would have another weapon at its disposal."

All anykirin in Fragrance knew was that the squabbling Triumvirate that ruled from Vermilion had gone down in flames—quite literally. Current had read the assessments and reports from the front that described the NAKP's enemies turning on each other in their trenches, and forward units had described entering the Vermilion loyalists' fortifications only to find charred bodies and blackened, boiled bloodstains along the walls. At night, the battlefield would glow with a blue and pink light, and the howls of monsters wailed into the darkness. By all accounts, the loyalist alliance has collapsed into violent nirik warlord splinter states, and a second inferno like the days before the Way of Fire had descended upon the Realm. Rather than making the war easier to fight, Current knew, it might have just gotten even harder. Feral, mindless nirik were monsters who ignored pain and cared little for self-preservation.\n\n"Sergeant Black Soot here to see you, sir," Current's secretary alerted him, and the NAKP's chairkirin turned around to find a charcoal gray mare standing by his desk. The insignia of the Death's Head Brigade glistened on the mare's shoulder, and in her magic was a soot-streaked book.\n\n"One of our spies was in Vermilion when the Triumvirate collapsed," Sergeant Black Soot said, and she set the book down on Current's desk. "He was by Autumn Blaze's side and was feeding us information since the war began. Thankfully, he managed to flee the capital as it burned to the ground, and the Brigade rescued him from deep behind enemy lines. Lines that were filled with nirik, mind you."\n\nFickle Current knew when a kirin was angling for more taels, and he gave her a nod. "Thank you, sergeant. I'll see to it that you're well rewarded. Now, what is this?" he asked, pointing to the book.\n\n"An excerpt from Autumn Blaze's personal journal," Black Soot said. "For your eyes only." Then she bowed her head. "My team will await further orders, sir." Current dismissed her with a wave of his hoof, then pulled over and opened up the book. Many of the pages were blackened and crumbled into ashes at the slightest touch, but one entry still remained: the last one. Autumn's usually flowing calligraphy was erratic and smudged, but behind the ash and what looked like blood, it was still legible."

kirin_council.50.d:0 "As Fickle Current entered Vermilion, safe in the middle of an armored convoy, he couldn't help but look over the Realm's capital and think back to when he first arrived what felt like a lifetime ago. Back then, he had arrived in an automobile, a piece of machinery so alien to the locals that they could only stare at it in awe and fascination. It had been difficult to cut a path to Vermilion over the Realm's ruined and abandoned roads, but he had done it anyway to make a statement: the future was coming to the backwards Realm. Now, at the end of a brutal civil war, the similarities between then and now seemed almost laughably remarkable, like a bad case of deja vu. With blood and iron, the NAKP had cut a path through Vermilion's defenders, once more bringing the future to the doorstep of Kiria.\n\nThe battle for the capital had taken a toll on its rustic splendor, with many buildings gutted by bombs and artillery and entire blocks reduced to ashes from uncontrolled fires. But apart from a few bullet holes in the walls and the odd crater around its periphery, the Vermilion Palace loomed over the scarred city, utterly untouched. Fitting, then; the Realm could only hold together so long as the constant presence and assuring infallibility of its Matriarch Superior remained unblemished, and even in war, the idea still held true.\n\n"The Matriarch's personal guard refused to fight with our forces," Cypress Snow said as he watched from the seat next to Fickle Current. "They retreated into the palace when the city fell. They haven't budged since. By all reports, the Matriarch is still inside."\n\n"She's too soft to push the kirin who protect her to kill in her name," Fickle Current said. "Besides, the army had orders to not push on the palace at all. We couldn't risk anything happening to the Matriarch. We may hold all the power in the Realm, but she's the one who holds it together with her mere presence. Half of our soldiers fought thinking they were trying to save her from her prison. We would lose everything if we so much as hurt a scale on her body."\n\nCypress Snow only nodded at that. "True enough. But the war's over. It's time for her to come out and do her job.""

kirin_council.51.d:0 "Tempered Steel sat on the gravel beside the train rails with the rest of his banner... or what was left of it. In the final defense of Vermilion, his unit had been surrounded and captured by the NAKP; since then, he'd known nothing but chains around his legs and a painful notch in his horn that stopped him from summoning any magic. It was a simple but effective means of controlling prisoners; the notch would heal over time and his magic would return, but the memory of the pain of having a chisel driven into the root of his horn was as effective a means as any to make sure he didn't try to use it while under guard. So long as the guards fed him and didn't bring back the chisel, he was fine keeping his head down and waiting until he was finally free.\n\nA cadre of NAKP soldiers stood before the group of prisoners, rambling about some important service to the Realm they would all be partaking in shortly. "Under the leadership of the NAKP, Greater Providence has marched south and restored order to the Kirian Realm," the mare at their head announced. "We have delivered the Kirian people from the degenerated government of the Premier in Vermilion and the heretic communists of the Rising Fire. As such, indebted as the Realm is to the heroic sacrifices of the north in its expedition to rescue the Realm, the industry of the cities of Vermilion and Verdant, the seats of the traitorous regimes, shall be forfeited in penance for their crimes. These resources shall be relocated to the north to allow the NAKP to better conduct the reconstruction of the Realm after the civil war, and you all will join your former regimes in punishment for supporting them. You will take part in the relocation effort, disassembling the factories here in Vermilion, and bringing them to Fragrance. When your labors are completed, perhaps then you will be ready to rejoin the Realm as honest citizens."\n\nThe NAKP soldiers began to force the prisoners onto their hooves, and Steel reluctantly rose to his with a sigh. Hard labor wasn't anything he couldn't handle. He just doubted that the NAKP would be so willing to let him and his comrades go when their task was complete."

kirin_council.52.t:0 "Military-Industrial Complexity"
kirin_council.52.d:0 "Cold Forge blinked at the set of blueprints before her and scratched her chin. They were factory floor plans, drawn up by some of the finest architects and artificers the NAKP had on hoof, but they were practically alien to her. She wasn't an artificer, an architect, or even a businessmare. She was a captain in the Order of the Iron Chrysanthemum, and before that, a humble blacksmith outside the city of Fragrance. But when the NAKP arrived in Fragrance years ago, she'd thrown her lot in with them, and now, somehow, she found herself staring hopelessly at blueprints while labor crews broke ground on a new factory next to the river before her.\n\n"Exciting, isn't it?" asked the stallion standing next to her, the collar on his suit cinched so tightly with his tie that Cold Forge could see his mane bunched up beneath it around his neck. She could only nod in agreement, feeling completely out of place wearing a business dress, her flanks feeling exposed by the skirt she'd traded her uniform for. She couldn't even remember his name, but he was here to help get her set up as the foremare of this newest factory. It was all part of the NAKP's latest initiative to provide the newly-minted Imperial Kirian Army with the means to be self-sustaining, able to produce its own equipment and munitions without being a draw on the state treasury. The factories would be administered by officers, and the workforce would be drawn from the rank and file, in essence turning each building into a regiment of its own. There would be no strikes, no slowdowns in production; the soldiers would follow the orders of their foremares and keep the factories effortlessly chugging along. At least, that was the idea. Cold Forge bet that her incompetence would get kirin up in arms in a week.\n\nBut hey, she was a captain, and she knew how to command the respect and loyalty of her troops. That's why they put her in charge of this factory, right?"

kirin_council.53.d:0 "A truck rumbled along an open road heading to the north, its lights cutting through the dusk as it neared its destination. Soldiers armed with pistols sat in the cab, while in the bed in the back, three kirin sat hunched over, their forelegs chained together and then to the floor. Each squinted and tried their best to shield their faces from the wind, and the smell of chemicals drifted in from afar.\n\nOne of the prisoners in the back turned her head toward her unfortunate companions. "A grim fate awaits us, but at least we have this moment of peace together," she said, raising her voice to be heard over the roar of the truck's engine and the wind. "What did they get you two for?"\n\n"Bad business," the stallion in the truck answered. "I took a loan from the Sycee Trading House and fled with the money when the war started. Stupid idea on my part. I thought the NAKP would lose and I'd get to keep the money, but they didn't, and somekirin sold me out."\n\n"Greed was your folly, as it will be for those who enslave us," the second mare in the truck said. She looked up, squinting towards the sky and the first bright stars beginning to emerge. "I am a mystic of the Way of Fire, and I spent my time and energy working on the front lines as a nurse, to heal the injured and perform last rites for those who needed them." The priestess shook her head. "The northerners and the foreigners, they have no respect for Concord's emissaries, to accost one of Her humble servants in such a manner."\n\n"I was a quartermaster for the army," the first mare began. "I was at the front to coordinate supplies to the troops and I was captured as well. Where do you think they're taking us?"\n\n"North, to the Comely Cape," the businesskirin answered. "Sycee runs a prison factory there. So long as you meet your quotas, they take care of you. All things considered, it's probably the best we could have hoped for."\n\n"I heard stories of factories of misery beneath Fragrance," the quartermaster said. "They do all sorts of terrible things to you there. Medical experiments and other crimes. I think the Bloom family has a hoof in it, but..." She shook her head. "It's all hearsay. And I hope that's all it is."\n\n"Whatever is in store for us, faith in Concord will help us persevere," the priestess assured them. "She would not let her foals languish in such misery forever.""

kirin_council.54.d:0 "The champagne let out a pop as the saber knocked off the top of the bottle, and a happy cheer filled the room along with the clapping of hooves. Fickle Current smiled as he watched the servants at 88 Chrysanthemum Plaza pour the bubbling delight into the glasses of everykirin present, and a pleasant chatter broke out around the table. He thought back to that night many months ago where he promised victory to the kirin in this room, and now, surrounded by the heads of the powerful corporations that had made it possible, they finally had a chance to celebrate at a lavish feast. After wartime rationing, it felt good to finally break open some bottles of fine Aquileian champagne, and he knew he wasn't the only one to think so. Even Silver Silks' happy tittering marked a stark contrast from the Sycee heiress' often haughty demeanor, and her mood was matched by the rest of the elite gathered around her.\n\nAs the servants brought out platter after platter of fine food, Cypress Snow stood up at Fickle's right and raised his glass in his magic. "It's been a long struggle for all of us, but it delights me to see that all our efforts were not in vain. The NAKP has triumphed over the rotten mockery of a dying Realm, and now it is up to us, the victors, to set it right. While the Matriarch Superior and the Vermilion Dynasty remain indisputable and, indeed, a stabilizing factor for the Realm as a whole, we have a chance to mold the future into one of our own making.\n\n"The Grand Gallop Onward failed for many reasons," Cypress continued, and the kirin gathered gave him their rapt attention. "The national bureaucracy was incompetent, for one. One needs to look no farther than the former premier's failed efforts to coordinate such an ambitious undertaking. But perhaps the simplest answer is that this land is full of backwards peasants and optimistic idealists who were never meant to hold the levers of power. That right belongs to the kirin who have the means and knowledge to wield them. To us. And may we create a better future than the one we inherited from the Realm."\n\nHe was met with applause, and with one last nod, Cypress sat down. Then, looking to his side at Fickle, Cypress gave his once-student a small bow of his head."

"And I believe he put it simply and eloquently, as he always does. The failures of the Realm stemmed from its corrupt, rotten, and homegrown systems. To put it another way, the failure of the Realm was a Kirian problem, but it is not a kirin problem. All of us have our roots in the Diaspora. We were born and raised in Equus and Griffonia, not in Kiria. We are all products of a modern era, one shaped by the pressures and incentives of the industrial revolution. We are not Kirian, but we are kirin, and it will take a modern breed of kirin to create a modern Kiria."\n\nCurrent raised his glass, and the rest of the kirin seated around the banquet table all did the same. "We have everything we need to remake the Realm. We have the knowledge, the acumen, and most importantly, the will to turn this Realm into something else. When I asked for your support long ago, I promised you would be rewarded. Now you will be. I won't ramble on about the terms and conditions, because I know you already have seen them. Today's decree shifts the responsibilities of governance and the levers of power away from the incompetents and into your hooves. The Matriarch's most loyal corporations, in an effort to prevent the resurgence of the recent upheaval that so plagued the land, shall rule the Realm and its provinces as her most loyal vassals.

kirin_council.55.t:0 "The Corporation of Kiria"
kirin_council.55.d:0 "For Dr. Ardent Bloom, corporate charters were like something akin to the miracle of life. One simple document, once drafted, scrutinized, rewritten, vetted, and submitted, could bring to life a titan of economic potential, birthing a new corporation from nothing but scattered ideas and empty pockets waiting to be filled. Whatever it would accomplish, whatever markets it would shake up, it all started in the drafting room where it was nothing more than an idea in the minds of ambitious creatures.\n\nUnfortunately, when politics barged its way into the drafting room, things tended to get messy. Before Ardent was the initial draft of the charter for the Corporation of Kiria, a monstrous entity in its own right that represented the interests of the Empire in a business setting akin to the vassal-corporations of the Vermilion Dynasty. While the technical details had been filled out, such as the number of shares that would comprise the corporation, and how those would be distributed, the broad strokes of the charter had remained annoyingly blank, and that was all due to the ever-meddlesome politics.\n\nThe original purpose of the Corporation was a simple one: it would serve as the governing body of the territories and protectorates outside of the Empire, providing Vermilion with a direct interface with its far-flung possessions beyond the borders of the Realm. But now there was a fight over whether it should have rights in the Realm proper. On one side was the NAKP, who argued that it would be an effective tool to allow the government to resolve disputes at home by giving it a seat at the bargaining side of business. On the other were the VasCorps, leery of the NAKP gaining too much influence and pushing into their spheres of influence like a market competitor, not a governing body. It was an ugly fight, and growing uglier by the day, and both sides had begun to tug on Ardent's ear to sway the matter one way or the other.\n\nArdent sighed and rubbed his temples. Much like the miracle of life, the miracle of business was often just as messy."

kirin_council.56.d:0 "Silver Silks yawned and idly twirled her cigarette holder in her magic, watching the smoke trail from the end as some NAKP peon named Simple Survey or something like that prattled off on something about voting rights. Silver genuinely wished she was anywhere but here; the stallion speaking had a terribly grating voice, and this meeting was the type of thing she would usually delegate somekirin else to attend in her place. But when the NAKP had summoned representatives from all the corporations to attend to discuss the matter, Silver's advisor had suggested that she attend the meeting in person in case it was important. But all Simple Survey had done was make some kind of half-baked lesson in the values of democracy and suffrage in the Empire, and Silver was bored. She'd need to find a new advisor after she got home and fired the old one for suggesting she attend this boring meeting.\n\n"And now, to the meat of the matter," Survey said, and Silver sighed in relief and pointed her ears up to at least take in the crux of the matter that she'd wasted her day on. "The NAKP values democracy, of course. When done correctly, and under the guidance of a benevolent state apparatus, the private sector, and the mature leadership of the national Party, democracy facilitates and enshrines the principles conductive to commercial-esque competition in a free marketplace of ideas, engendering an incentive for political organizations to provide the best value service to stakeholder-electors. Thusly, the Party, in its wisdom, and to achieve this vision of a harmonic and stable democratic system of governance, will implement limited electoral reforms to allow stakeholders from all sections of society to determine Kiria's political direction.\n\n"How will we accomplish this?" Survey continued, and a slide projector clicked over to a set of bullet points. "The executive council has come up with two proposals, which we will vote on. The first is an electoral system wherein propertied individuals and entities will be able to cast votes proportional to the total value of their assets. This will encompass corporations, landowners, and those other propertied stakeholders in society. There is also an alternative: the so-called "suffragette lottery" model, wherein kirin purchase "franchise shares". There is a lottery that determines which 30% of the shares will become actual votes. Don't be put off by the utter radicalness of this proposal, good friends; of course, corporations can purchase franchise shares en masse, but the marginal element of randomness is supposed to act as an equalizer."\n\n"Good, good, can we get on with it, though?" Silver asked, finally exhausted enough by the meeting to raise her voice and force a vote. The entire ordeal mattered little to her; as the wealthiest kirin in the Realm, she knew her voice was the loudest no matter how the NAKP pitched its sham democracy."

kirin_council.57.d:0 "Black Lotus made her way through the depopulated town square, an NAKP cadre hovering off to her side, and swept the village over with a disinterested look. Chenar looked like so many other villages she'd seen throughout the civil war; a vacuous ruin filled with crumbling and destroyed buildings and stripped of almost the entire adult population. Countless kirin had been forcibly sent off to war, and most never returned. All that remained behind were the elderly who tried to tend burnt and fallow fields, and those too young to fight.\n\n"It's a village full of foals," the NAKP stallion said behind Black Lotus. "Young and impressionable. Once the rural pacification program makes its way here, we'll make plenty of loyal peasants to support the regime in the future."\n\n"Must you state the obvious so openly and carelessly?" Black Lotus said with a roll of her indigo eyes. She paused in the middle of the street for a moment as a trio of foals chasing a ball scampered by, and then continued onwards. "Chenar is a hive of our enemies. Bandits prey on the town, and so too do the Rising Fire guerillas. They openly attack our convoys, and they draw new recruits and supplies from the surrounding countryside. It's a situation that has to be dealt with before we could expect any sort of return for our investments."\n\n"If this is a guerilla hub, then we need to smash it apart," the NAKP soldier said. "You've done plenty slash and burn missions, right, Officer Lotus? This should be old hat to you."\n\n"Killings and reprisals only work when there is somekirin left to kill or punish," Lotus said with a roll of her eyes. "There's barely anykirin left in Chenar as is. Just the young and the old. Sure, some killings would serve as a good warning to nearby towns not to side with our enemies, but perhaps a different approach would work best." Her eyes lingered on the foals for a moment, and the corners of her muzzle turned down in a thoughtful frown. "If we focus on a different approach and invest in the town, pouring money into reeducating these simpletons, then our investment might return to us many times over. And on top of that, the NAKP will see that I'm long overdue for a promotion for my services.""

"That special agent from the west is back," he informed her. "Shall I send him in?"\n\n"Yes, sure, send him in," Leaves said, knocking aside her house of cards with a hoof and collecting them into one pile with her magic. Her secretary nodded and shut the door behind him as he left, and Leaves straightened her dress and leaned back in her chair with a sigh. She could only hope that her meeting with this 'special agent' would liven up her day a little. Fridays were slow as could be, and her mind was already wandering to meeting up with her marefriends after work and seeing if they could attract the gazes of any stallions at the teahouse. Hopefully that scale polish she'd gotten earlier in the week would pay off...\n\nHer dreams seemed to be surprisingly answered when a stallion in his mid-thirties stepped into her office. His mane was wild and unkempt and the coarse hairs lining his muzzle gave him a rugged look. He wore an Iron Chrysanthemum uniform that had obviously seen plenty of use out in the west, but he'd modified it with patches and charms of jade and bone. And when he shut the door behind him, his magic removed a worn-out hat from atop his head and he gave her a respectful nod. "Ma'am."\n\n"Oh, hello," Fall purred, sitting up straighter for a moment only to lean on her desk and smile wide. "Please come in, sit down. I'd like to hear all about this report of yours... and any of your adventures out in the wild, wild west, if you'd care to share." She'd always been fascinated with tales of the west, of the rugged protectors of Greater Providence bringing the rule of law to the lawless and looking ravishing while doing so...\n\n"I'm just here to share what we've learned, ma'am," the stallion said. He dropped a folder full of files on her desk with a glow of his horn. "It's more or less what the department was expecting. The western regional authorities require more funding and resources to finish up the consolidation of the west. That means more kirin and more money."\n\nThat soured the mood, and Fall stuck her tongue out in disgust. "The Bureau for ReConstruction and Integration is on a tight enough budget as is," she said. "We can't afford to waste any where it won't do us much good." She crossed her forelegs and thought for a minute, but ultimately decided to save those thoughts for Monday. It was almost time for her weekend to start, anyway, and she knew exactly how she wanted to start it. "Say, are the rest of your companions as adventurous as you are, soldier? Maybe together we can discuss this further, find a solution. Over tea tonight, perhaps?""

kirin_council.59.d:0 "As Fickle Current watched kirin filter into the Morning Secretariat, he felt, for the first time, at ease to be inside its grand halls. During the Grand Gallop Onward, these walls were filled with bickering rabble, seditious communists, and superstitious mystics, all trying to pull the Realm into pieces with their poorly-conceived ideas. Now, however, a finer breed of kirin found their seats inside the building. Corporate-vassal executives, captains of industry, NAKP grandees, and kirin of wealth and fame took the places of idealistic reformers and unwashed peasants. For the prosperity of the Realm, there was no better upgrade.\n\nOnce everykirin had taken their seats, and after a short introduction by a party official, Current took to the stand and spread out his papers across the rostrum. "Over the past several weeks, the NAKP has undertaken a grand cataloging of the Realm's natural resources and industry. A Grand Survey, if you will. And I am pleased to report that it has been a great success. As Chairkirin and Imperial Premier, I speak on behalf of the Association in reaffirming the indisputable fact that the Vermilion Dynasty, headed by the Matriarch Superior, remains the sole owner in perpetuity of all land in the Empire. In her wisdom, the Matriarch has seen fit to bestow unto her loyal vassal corporations the use of the land in her realm, for the common prosperity of the nation and its people. It is only fair that the Dynasty demands the most minor of financial recompense for its generosity."\n\nAs Current expected, even the tiniest notion or hint of taxation stirred discontented murmurs among the gathered kirin, and he moved to nip their discontent in the bud. "Let me pose a question to you all: what do you do with dividends from your investments? Do you take the money and pocket it? Or do you reinvest those dividends into your assets, and reap greater rewards during the next harvest? I am not proposing taxation, the government leeching off of the hard work of the productive members of society. Rather, I am proposing a mutual reinvestment of our hard work into greater yields in the future. And to do this, I have two proposals that we, as shareholders in the government, will vote on today. The first is an obligation of the vassals to invest in the social development of their own lands through education and social programs for the populace. The second is through an agreement to earmark a certain percentage of each vassal's revenue for the development of industry and infrastructure. I think you all will agree that either proposal will be a great boon for the Realm in the long run.""

Heavy cargo planes and highways that cut across the Realm are a far more flexible option than static rail lines."\n\n"With all due respect, sir, you can kiss my scales." The lieutenant crossed her forelegs and leered back at the stallion sitting across from her. "Nothing moves tonnage as reliably or efficiently as trains. Plus, you can slap some armor and some heavy howitzers on one and you've got an unstoppable monster on rails. I'd like to see your fancy transport planes do that."\n\nDr. Ardent Bloom sighed and rubbed the scales on his nose as the bickering continued around him. It was supposed to be a fairly simple meeting to discuss the modernization of the army, but the meeting had been derailed by debate over the future of supply, logistics, and doctrine. Two camps had clearly developed in the debate, and it was only growing nastier. On one side, a more traditional faction had emerged around the importance of moving things by rail, championing the simplicity, efficiency, and heavy tonnage that rail supported. Those would be key factors in maintaining control over territories, whether they be under occupation or centrally governed by the Realm. On the other, more innovative minds pushed for new ideas like rapid transport and flexibility using heavy cargo planes and highways that allowed material to be quickly repositioned anywhere in the Realm, not just at rail hubs and supply depots. Whichever side won would shape the future of Kiria's doctrine of war.\n\nUnfortunately, the talks were only growing more combative, and the last thing Ardent wanted was to be in the middle of a room full of combat-trained kirin going nirik as tempers flared. Thankfully, he was the chief economist for the NAKP, and he would be the one bringing the decision forward through the party's budget committee. As such, he had the final say on the matter."

The trading floor was packed with kirin and filled with shouts and raised hooves, all roaring beneath the hammering TICK TICK TICK of the ticker tapes spitting out an ever-changing list of price shares and call orders. It was all so overwhelming, but Fireflash had insisted that it would all be worth it.\n\nThrough some miracle, Willow managed to follow Fireflash through the crushing crowds to where dozens, if not hundreds, of kirin in suits and dresses all gathered together, shouting orders and signing papers while the ticker tapes continued their relentless ticking. There was a reason behind the madness: news had broken late last night that the wartime assets and industry of the Vermilion Dynasty would be consolidated under the newly-created Subsidiary Syndicate, with the Dynasty holding a quarter share and the NAKP holding one to match it. The remaining 50% of the shares would go to an undisclosed buyer, but everykirin in Fragrance knew it would either go to Sycee, Sorghum, or the AKAG as the big three VasCorps in the Realm. One of those corporations would get to control the Syndicate as its newest subsidiary, and the boost to its share price was expected to be astronomical. A mad speculation rush descended on the stock exchange, and Willow, whose father had been a top accountant with the Wingluck Consortium but who had never personally invested in the markets, felt overwhelmed.\n\n"One hundred shares from Sorghum!" Fireflash shouted as he forced his way to the front of the line. "Industry is where it's at!"\n\n"You'd do better putting that money on AKAG!" the kirin next to him shouted. "A homegrown automobile industry has no limit on potential!"\n\nWillow felt the blood drain from her face as the loudspeakers crackled to life in the stock exchange, and the feeding frenzy only grew more intense as the moment of truth drew nearer. "A-A hundred from Sycee!" she shouted, throwing down two months' worth of pay on the counter in front of her. The trader across from her swept away her money and produced a sheet of paper in short order, which she signed with wavering magic. And just as he took the paper away from her and she officially secured her shares, Willow strained her panicked ears to hear who won the bid for the Syndicate through the noise of the trading floor:"

I'm not a major yet. Not until my first day on the job." She took a sip of the wine and hummed, her eyes wandering over the kirin gathered for her going-away party, happily chatting, eating, and drinking while music played and the lights of Fragrance's harbor dotted the bay, providing a pleasant backdrop from the building's thirtieth floor. It was all so thoughtful of her colleagues, and she was determined to enjoy every last minute of it.\n\n"From regional director in Sorghum's Fragrance headquarters to major in the Army Assets Administration," Zen remarked with a playful shake of his head. "Everykirin in the building was bidding for that job, I think. I know I certainly passed my resume along." But he smiled and gave Scarlet a clap on the shoulder. "I can't think of anykirin more deserving, though. I've heard the AAA runs them rough over there, but if it's anything like the tight ship you sailed for us, I bet you'll do great. Just try not to forget about us when you're gone!"\n\n"Oh, you know I'd never do that," Scarlet assured him, and she took another sip of her wine, feeling the pleasant burn of alcohol settling in her gut. But truth be told, she couldn't help but feel a little overwhelmed at her impending career change, even if she had every reason to be proud. Countless kirin like her had applied to join the Imperial Kirian Army's upper management and feed themselves into the gears of that all-powerful machine; very few were ever accepted. Those that were found themselves flush with prestige and influence on par with the old banners that once ruled the military, but were increasingly pushed to the sides as the Realm's old military modernized under the NAKP's efforts. Scarlet knew she would be pushed harder than she ever had been before, and she would probably make a lot of enemies in the process. But it was a position that rewarded ambitious kirin, and Scarlet knew she certainly was one of those."

kirin_council.63.d:0 "Firebolt rubbed shoulders with her husband as the pair trotted along Fragrance's wharves on a hot day. Perhaps it was a little too hot; the metal scales embedded into Firebolt's nose felt like they were burning under the sun, and she had to pause for a moment to rub at them in frustration. It was the little things like that that reminded her of the war more than anything else, and how the bullet she took to the face would have killed her if it'd been a little bit further to either side.\n\nHer husband stopped and stood in front of her, casting his shadow over her face to give her a slight reprieve from the sun, if only for a moment. "We're almost there," he assured her, and he gave her a peck on the cheek. "We can ask Malt for some ice to cool it down."\n\n"I should have gone for ceramic scales, not metal," Firebolt groused, but she kissed her husband back and resumed trotting. "Come on, we're late enough as is, Teak. Signal's probably started the party without us."\n\nTeak nodded, and the two continued along the way, watching as the crowd of civilians subconsciously parted for the couple as they strode with military bearing. It wasn't long before they made it to their destination, a small bar named Lookout's Point, and stepped inside. Subdued music filled the background as a few dozen kirin of clean military dress and atmosphere talked with each other and shared drinks, and the two went right to the bar where a group of kirin crowded around one particular specimen wearing his dress blues, complete with medal hanging from the breast pocket. "Congratulations, Signal!" Teak shouted, and the couple parted the crowd to shake hooves with the kirin in question. "I bet the NAKP's happy to have one of their finest soldiers in the party!"\n\n"Teak! Firebolt!" Signal exclaimed, raising his drink in his magic. "So great to see you! The ceremony was fun and all, but now the party's really getting started! Hey, Malt, get them some beers, will you?"\n\nSignal and Teak fell into easy conversation, and Firebolt exchanged courteous greetings with the kirin around them, though her mood dampened somewhat when she saw the pins of the Order of the Iron Chrysanthemum on their lapels. She and Teak and Signal were soldiers who had earned their worth to the NAKP; the kirin of the Iron Chrysanthemum bought their positions with money rather than blood. Still, she stopped herself from bringing it up. It wouldn't do to ruin Signal's celebration by butting heads with his new party mates, would it?"

kirin_council.64.d:0 ""Ready to begin, sir."\n\n"Excellent." Standard-Commander Ficus Ginseng of the Sixth Special Rear Operations Squadron of Civil Defense gathered up his notes and nodded to his secretary as she readied the typewriter to receive his dictated dispatch. "To Vice-Banner-Commander Ginseng Varnish, 3rd Special Naval Squadron; Sister, by now your ships should be within sight of Sunflower and the hive of rebels infesting the area. I have not been able to share details of the operation with you until now for fear of rebels catching wind and them slipping our net, but now it will be too late for them to act. As I'm sure you are aware, the guerillas around Sunflower are the remnants of the Rising Fire, who rule the town with an iron hoof and demand tribute from the peasants living there in the form of food and fodder for their forces. Informants and loyalists to the Empire suffer under summary executions and collective punishment on their neighbors and families. In short, these are vermin that must be stamped right out, and such is your directive."\n\n"Reference Stratagem Nine according to the Civil Defense Counter-Insurgency Manual," Ficus continued, pulling his summary of the stratagem to the top of his notes. "This infestation is to be treated as a case of parasitism that we must spare no effort in rooting out. The bandits derive their sustenance from the peasants of the countryside they infest. They do not produce their own supplies; these they steal or receive in contributions from the local populace. Additionally, we have seen reports that they hide amongst the peasantry in plainclothes, and they receive additional assistance from beyond their area of operations. To that effect, upon arrival, you shall cordon off an area of twenty miles radius from the center of town and prevent the crossings of any creatures past this cordon. Once contained, you will destroy the sources of the parasite's existence. Torch any and all arable land within the area, contaminate wells as you see fit, and raze any places of industry or infrastructure you find. Any kirin suspected of providing aid to the bandits must be rounded up and executed, and villages that do not cooperate shall be razed to the ground. Remember that we are fighting a parasite, and to kill it, the host must temporarily suffer by necessity. Fevers are unpleasant, but at the end of the day, the host lives, and the parasite dies."\n\nSatisfied, Ficus gave one last nod to his secretary. "I shall leave the implementation of the details to you, sister. Act accordingly, and Concord willing, we may be able to share stories over the New Year celebrations.""

'RHAPSODY MAGISTRATES PERISH IN TRAGIC PLANE CRASH' it shouted, alongside an arrangement of portraits of the Procurate's late members. But though the news was a tragic blow to the pride of not only the city of Rhapsody, but the entirety of the Way of Fire, there was not a wet eye between the three pairs in the boardroom.\n\n"A tragedy," Fickle Current remarked as he glanced at the newspaper, but after a moment, he swept it aside with his magic. "A Marksist-Stallionist anarchist finds her way into Rhapsody's airport and the next thing you know, a routine flight from Rhapsody to Fragrance crashes into the sea."\n\n"A pity," Cypress Snow agreed, though the news didn't seem to bother him all that much. "They will be missed. They deserve nothing less than a state funeral and a week of national mourning. I assume we've already been in contact with their successors?"\n\nHis eyes slid over to the third kirin, and Dr. Ardent Bloom nodded. "Their successors have proven much more agreeable than the old lot toward our proposal to integrate the Procurate into the Empire's bureaucracy," he informed them. "And with their agreement, the shares of the Rhapsody Arsenal that the old Procurate once controlled have been generously transferred to the NAKP. Bringing the Arsenal into line with the rest of the VasCorps will help us present a more unified front for the nation, and finally quash those niggling whispers of rebellion coming from their board."\n\n"Excellent." With that, Fickle stood up, and his two companions did the same. "It's important that that matter is finally put to rest. That the loyalty of the Arsenal could ever be owed to a body that was not the Vermilion Throne is inconceivable.""

Yet another twelve hour day trying to play middlemare between five different departments that refused to communicate to each other except through her. But she needed the overtime, so she couldn't complain too much. Especially since, as a middle manager in Sycee's exports department, she actually qualified for overtime pay, unlike most of the kirin under her. It wasn't much, but the time-and-a-quarter pay was very much appreciated, especially with her mother's hip surgery coming up... and doubly so when Sycee's insurance didn't cover 'pre-existing conditions developed before the NAKP's assumption of state affairs'.\n\nMistletoe trudged off down the road, thinking only of the homemade soup her mother would have stewing on the stove for her when she got back. She was fortunate, she knew, as she watched crowds of kirin gathered at dingy roadside inns and gambling dens, burning away what little pittance of pay they had left over once Sycee took back its cuts for corporate lodging and the groceries they bought at the company store. They were the kirin who didn't have the drive or the brains to devote themselves to higher learning and becoming something more useful than laborers or pen-pushers for the trading houses, and as such, they would never rise above their station. They didn't have the drive to succeed, and thus would only be compensated for what they were worth. But Mistletoe knew she was worth more, and she pushed herself to prove it to Sycee. Every day, she busted her scales putting in extra hours for the company, and she knew promotions would be coming soon. The pay raise would be very much appreciated, especially while her mother recovered from surgery, and the higher pay grade meant they would qualify for larger housing accommodations. Maybe she and her mother could have separate bedrooms!\n\nA familiar face waved at her from the other street corner, and Mistletoe had to suppress a frown as she waved back. Kudzu worked in her department alongside her, and she knew he was a competitor for the promotion in her department. He was always kissing their supervisor's scales and giving her compliments on every little thing she did or wore, while Mistletoe was too busy busting her flank to make small talk. He was a competitor, and a threat to her future. But then an idea hit her, and a smile broke out on her muzzle. Next time Kudzu had his morning coffee, she'd secure her promotion."

Vermilion had finally entered a new age with the destruction of the last cell of Autumnal loyalists hiding out in the Vermilion Basin, and nowhere was that more obvious than in the buildings of steel and concrete rising above the ancient wooden and stone buildings. The new age of the NAKP had finally enforced its dominance over the old ways, and though Vermilion still felt like a city under occupation, the lifting of martial law before the parade made it obvious that the former capital of the Realm and the Matriarch Superior's centuries-old seat of power was starting to join the rest of the country in its march into the future. With one hoof in yesteryear and one in tomorrow, Vermilion was a city that straddled two great periods of kirin history, providing a bridge between the old and the new.

The little quip earned polite chuckles from the rest of the kirin, and Ardent nodded at the mare standing at the front of the room by a projector screen. "Please, begin. The board is very excited to hear what you have to say."\n\n"Thank you, doctor," the mare said, and her magic seized the projector switch and clicked onto a picture of idyllic rice terraces nestled in a pristine countryside. "Fillies and gentlecolts of the board, we spend our days working hard for our enterprises and doing the best we can to keep a leg up on our competitors. But successful work is hard work, taxing work, and kirin weren't meant to toil in offices forever. So why not treat yourself to a change of pace? Why not take your family on a trip out west and connect with our ancient roots, like the locals do!"\n\nThe projector clicked over to the next slide, this one showing kirin in traditional garb dancing in front of traditional rammed earth buildings roofed with traditional thatch in a traditional communal hall.

"I hope you lot don't expect me to be all clean and proper like the rest of your stuffy suits."\n\n"It was only for the ceremony," Fickle Current said, not even sparing her a glance as the two kirin trotted down the docks in Hyacinth. "You're the Chief Administrator of the Exclusive Naval Economic Zone of South Kiria, but the rest of the NAKP wasn't going to take you seriously if you showed up in that ridiculous garb of yours. You can take it off when we get to your ship."\n\n"I'm not waiting until I get to the ship," Roaring Fire muttered, and Fickle Current flinched at the sound of tearing fabric. He looked back over his shoulder to see the pirate queen stripped naked, and she tossed the ruined fabric into the lapping waters of the harbor. "Much better," she said with a happy lilt, and when she saw Current's fluster, she gave her flanks a suggestive shake. "What's that thing about pirates and booty...?"\n\nFickle pointedly turned away and continued trotting, refusing to entertain the seaborne marauder's antics. "You're free to engage in whatever shenanigans you want when you're on your ship and out of my mane," he said. "As leader of the ENEZ, it's your duty to patrol the sea lanes along the coast of Kiria, collect shipping taxes and harbor fees, and project our naval power out into our waters. And if the state happens to need the shipping traffic of unfriendly powers disrupted or a statement made on some unfortunate coastal town, then I'm sure you'll find a way to do so discreetly. The line between pirate and sailor is oh-so-blurry in the fog of war."\n\n"I'll need ships," Roaring Fire said, cantering to catch up to Current after her little display. "I can't help but feel like my crew hasn't had a fair seat at the table after all we did in your little war."\n\n"You'll have your ships. Starting with that one." With that, Fickle Current gestured to a brand new cruiser docked in Hyacinth's harbor, its bridge glistening in the morning light. Sleek and modern, it was enough to leave the usually quick-witted and foul-mouthed Roaring Fire with her jaw agape. "She was launched under a rather boring service number. I'll leave the name up to you. Consider it the NAKP's first investment in the ENEZ. I have no doubt that with it, you'll have the funds in no time to grow your fleet."\n\nHe gave Roaring Fire a satisfied look, and after a few seconds, the pirate queen's astonished expression turned into one of giddy joy."

kirin_council.70.t:0 "Birthday Planning"
kirin_council.70.d:0 "It was the Matriarch's birthday, but it was not a happy one.\n\nThat much was obvious to Fickle Current as he stood off to the side of the Vermilion Throne and watched countless delegations from all across the Realm bring gifts and tribute to the Matriarch Superior. From wealthy VasCorp CEOs making personal visits to maintain the farce that they owed allegiance to Rain Shine and not the other way around, to lowly commoners screened beforehoof by the NAKP to show the love all kirin held for their Matriarch, the carefully choreographed song and dance played out before Rain Shine's sullen eyes and forced smile. It wasn't hard for Fickle to understand why Rain Shine wasn't happy; why would she be, when she was forced to serve as the NAKP's puppet to maintain its grasp on the Realm as it took power out of her hooves, away from Concord, and into the pockets of millionaires? But it was a charade that she maintained, if only to help keep the Realm stable. Current held no doubts that Rain Shine disapproved of everything he and his friends had done to Kiria, but she played her part to stop her kirin from killing each other. She was too good of a kirin, if too naive, to think of ending the lie for some greater good that lay on the other side of a river of blood.\n\nStill, between the gifts and the feast earlier that evening, which had consisted of a grandiose spread of traditional Kirian dishes and exotic fare from Equus, Griffonia, and other parts of Zebrica, Current found the gears in his head turning. He recalled several prominent party members and board executives of the various VasCorps talking with lust over the wealth and resources of the Hindian deer to the north even as they sampled small platters of its food. Talk of aggression against Hindia was common in parlor meetings but nearly absent in the boardroom, as it was understood that war with their populous northern neighbor could be catastrophic to the profit margins of the VasCorps. But Current wondered if there was merit to that talk or merely an abundance of caution. He knew that if he pushed the right kirin and justified it, he could have the Realm at war with Hindia in no time.\n\nBesides, he had neglected to give Rain Shine a birthday gift this year. He'd have to give her a special one next year."

Every building around the pavilion had been commandeered by the Iron Chrysanthemum, and a crowd of kirin and deer surrounding the pavilion cheered as Matriarch Superior Rain Shine trotted down a red silk carpet under the protection of two dozen bodyguards. The tall kirin looked markedly uncomfortable, the smile on her muzzle as fake and forced as the pretext for the war in the first place, but she painfully made her way into the pavilion regardless.\n\nInside, she found herself face to face with Fickle Current and a looted throne, and as she took her seat to the fanfare of trumpets, Current lifted a Hindian crown off of its cushion and rested it upon her head. "Long live Matriarch Superior Rain Shine, chosen divine avatar of Concord, and Empress and Protectress of Hindia!" he proclaimed to the crowd, and the cheering crowd of NAKP grandees, corporate aristocrats, and Hindian collaborators stomped their hooves in applause. Rain Shine grimaced at them and obediently waved her hoof, and as the cheering reached thunderous applause, Fickle Current leaned down and whispered in her ear:"

Gratitude, and also to hopefully soften up the Changeling that was currerntly making himself comfortable in the seat across from Fickle Current.\n\n"It's been quite the lovely reception, if I didn't know better I'd say you were trying to butter me up," Finicus Vesali gave Fickle Current a knowing smile. "However, I still believe we have the matter of your payment plan to discuss."\n\n"Of course." Fickle Current smiled back, though he felt a small chill going down his spine. He had seen the estimates, and though desperate times had called for desperate measures, this was one debt he was not looking forward to squaring. "Some more wine while we discuss it?"\n\n"No thank you, and from one businesscreature to another, let's just get this band-aid ripped off without dragging it out, shall we?" Finicus's smile had turned vicious now. "The interest rate for the loan you took was set at 150%, quite the reasonable price considering the high risks of the investment I must say. Still, I am not wholly unreasonable, and though my queen is expecting the money back expeditiously, I do have some leeway.

His forces had spent the last few days more in hiding than actually fighting, as the topic was more about how to get the hay out of here. Commandeering a boat was a desperate move, but he couldn't think of anything else beyond just surrender, and he wasn't quite that desperate to throw himself at the mercy of their approaching foes yet.\n\nOr at least he hadn't been until now. Hiding in the outskirts of Fragrance harbour, he stared in disbelief at the sight of hundreds, indeed thousands, of armed changelings offloading from seemingly every ship in the harbour, from fishing junks to passenger liners to cargo steamers. Had a Changeling invasion force been hidden aboard ships in Fragrance harbour all along, right under the NAKP's noses? They were already moving into the city, and any hopes that they were there as reinforcements withered quickly as he saw scores of unarmed kirin in NAKP uniforms being corralled onto barges under the watchful gaze of changeling guards.\n\nThis was what the suits got for borrowing money from the changelings, wasn't it?

Fern Flare could not believe her ears, and stared in disbelief at the changeling in front of her. What he had told her left her sick to her stomach.\n\n"To an extent," Finicus Vesali clarified with a smile. "We are not wholly unreasonable and we are more than open to compensating you. Still, for the sake of Kiria's future relationship with Main Hive Industries - and the Changeling Queendom - I hope you can see that we poured a lot of money into Kiria, money that has benefitted Fragrance. All we wish is for is the opportunity to recoup our losses, and the city centre of Fragrance will help us do this."\n\n"Oh, yes, that does indeed sound reasonable, just steal a city and ask the creatures you steal it from to not be rude. Of course," Fern Flare felt her disbelief slowly turn to anger. She had to stop herself and take a couple of deep breaths.\n\n"We are not going to budge on this issue, I'm afraid, and surely Kiria has suffered enough without starting a conflict that will lead it into war with the Changeling Hives." Finicus's smile left his face, making it clear just how serious he was.\n\n"Let me offer you an honorable way out, however. Fragrance is one city, of little import to the whole of Kiria, and in return for avoiding another bloody war, MHI will provide you ample industrial and technological aid in return, providing Kiria with peace and progress. If you would choose war instead, that will be on you. I just ask you consider what Kiria truly needs right now.""

Finicus Vesali nodded his head to her. "Also, Fragrance is not a city that is very welcoming to the Rising Fire, ma'am. It resents the Silence for what it cost it, and if you seize it, all you will have is a city that loathes you and which would rise up in revolt before long."\n\n"Do you believe we are not willing to do whatever it takes to save our homeland?" Dayspring Rose asked him lowly. Finicus gave her a small smile. "I would not be so derogatory to suggest that the Fragrancese would win such a fight, but there will be very little left of the city when you do put them down. Who benefits from that? The Fraternal Republic does not need more conflict, and for your understanding, MHI can provide what it does need; industrial and technological aid. We will keep Fragrance under control, make sure that the loans we gave are repaid, without you even really needing to be involved in the process. In return, you will gain all the aid that we can give you, reconstruction will be sped up, and the Fraternal Republic will not need to deal with another war, nor the rebuilding of a levelled city.""

Finicus said, acting as though they were talking about food preferences before his face split in another smile, this one more sinister. "I suppose however that the kirin who caused all of this would be of greater import than a city. It just so happens that chairkirin Fickle Current has contacted us about receiving sanctuary in Fragrance. In case of a breakout of hostilities, he could slip on a plane and be out of reach before you can set after him. Of course, if a deal is worked out between us, we would of course allow you to enter Fragrance in order to arrest him."\n\n"Selling out your allies, is it?" Fern Flare couldn't believe these changelings. Finicus meanwhile shook his head.\n\n"Our debtor, not ally. We were never allied with the NAKP, and we've completed our side of the bargain. Is there not a poetic justice that a kirin like him is captured since he didn't properly review the offer he was given? Besides, I think his capture would be more relevant for future stability than Fragance. What do you say? A toast to peace and future cooperation perhaps?""

I will indulge you enough that you have one chance to make a better offer."\n\n"Very well, then. Fickle Current." Finicus retorted. "At the moment, he has sought shelter in Fragrance, and in case of an attack, he'd be able to board a plane and flee out of your reach. He is a greater threat to Kiria than one city, I'd hazard, and if we work out a deal, there's no reason for us to protect a debtor who defaulted on his debts.

The time has come for him to face justice for his crimes against the Kirian people. It is beyond all doubt that his actions were contrary to Concord's will, and that his greed caused him to lead Kiria off the righteous path. However, not everykirin is in agreement as to what would constitute a just sentence.\n\nSome believe there is only one fitting punishment for traitors and heretics: a bullet to the head. Essentially, this would be sending him directly to Concord to face divine judgement. Others believe that since Fickle Current and the NAKP no longer pose a threat to the Fraternal Republic's stability, killing him at this point would be pointless. They instead argue for trial and imprisonment, believing that nokirin is beyond redemption, and that perhaps with enough time to reflect, he will see the error of his ways and become reconciled with Concord."

"Will you come clean right away, or will I have to drag it out of you?"\n\n"That won't be necessary, your majesty," Finicus bowed deeply before her. "On behalf of the Changeling Queendom, Main Hive Industries has acquired a ninety-nine year lease on the city of Fragrance in Kiria. The city's erstwhile owners owed us a quite sizeable debt, and when they failed to make due on it, the MHI's forces secured our collateral. We have secured the city and convinced the potential claimants to it to let the matter be, and it has cost the Queendom nothing. The changeling queendom now possesses a colony in Zebrica."\n\n"You went behind my back and seized territory in Kiria, risking a war?" Chrysalis summarised, leaning in towards him. "Do you expect me to be happy about this? What will we do when the lease runs out? And what is this city meant to provide? Tea?"\n\n"A 'war' that would have seen your opponents across the world and recovering from a civil war, your majesty. I won't deny it has been an audacious operation, but as you can see, it has all worked out for the best. Moreover, ninety-nine years is more than enough time for us to recoup our investments a hundredfold, not to mention the establishment of a permanent intelligence and security network in Zebrica. As I am sure your majesty is well aware, such tendrils cannot easily be uprooted. Who knows if the Kirian Realm will even exist by then? As for what it will provide, it is a wealthy trading city and a gateway into Kiria, and the resources it lets us access will provide a steady cash flow. MHI will of course take full responsibility for this operation, both economically and administratively, and I have appointed a talented administrator for the region."\n\n"And anything of interest to the Queendom will be shipped back to Vesalipolis," Chrysalis finished.

The smell of earth was thick inside the dark basement, the only light coming from a smattering of candles. Around her sat a group of dishevelled kirin—fellow members of the Marksist-Stallionist Workers Party of Kiria. They spoke in hushed tones, grappling with the shocking developments that had taken place in the city. Fragrance has been taken over by Changelings. The question was now: how should they respond?\n\nSilver Thatch cleared his throat. "It pains me to say this," The aged kirin spoke softly. For years he had been their rock, but now he seemed so very fragile. "We must leave this place and cross over back to Kiria. The Changelings know brutality extraordinarily well. If we stay, they will suppress us ruthlessly and we will suffer the same fate as Gold Muffin's communists." Sorrow was evident in Thatch's eyes. "We must face reality: at this point, the liberation of Fragrance can only be achieved via an invasion from Kiria. We can work with the Rising Fire, or the RaHP. Even they are opposed to the Changelings. We must retreat, and bide our time."\n\nSilence reigned for only a moment before a sharp voice cut through the cold air. "You can not be serious!" Cramoisy erupted. "Run away? What we need to do more than anything is stay in Fragrance and continue our work." Her every word dripped with conviction. "Fragrance is under imperialist rule by a foreign colonial power, a capitalist and hyper-exploitative power too. Kirin are suffering as we speak. And you tell us to wait and compromise?" Cramoisy stomped a hoof emphatically. "It is our duty to stay and fight for the rights and freedoms of the Fragrancese worker and citizen. They need to know that we are with them, or else we will never gain their trust. We need to put our money where our mouth is!"\n\nSummer Spice held her breath. She thought back to when Cramoisy had first joined the MSWPK, recruited by her personally. She remembered their comradery, but she also remembered all the wisdom Silver Thatch had given her over the years. It was a choice between her friend or her mentor. It was unclear who had been more persuasive. In truth, she herself did not know who was right. She closed her eyes, and took a deep breath."

This envoy was disguised for reasons that escaped the korpskommandant. Sciaridae knew better than to be fooled by the apparently unremarkable drone before him and didn't ask questions.\n\nThe changeling hummed thoughtly as he read on.\n\n"As for potential candidates for the position of Chief Executive, I've narrowed them down to two choices," Sciaridae continued. "Cypress Snow and Ardent Bloom, both high ranking NAKP members—pages thirteen and fifteen respectively."\n\nWhile his guest flipped to the indicated pages, Sciaridae shifted in his seat. Snow was an academic and professor who was knowledgeable and well recognised among the NAKP base: landowners, industrialists, and the intelligentsia. Meanwhile, Bloom was the NAKP's chief economist before its collapse. Both kirin would have been excellent choices in Sciaridae's eyes.\n\nAfter a minute or so, the envoy glanced up. "Either one will fall in line?" he asked blankly.\n\n"Of course," Sciaridae replied. "Both of them sought refuge at our consulate when the NAKP was defeated. They will gladly follow our instructions, at least in the short run."\n\nNodding, the drone placed the folder on the desk.

Asides from the presence of changeling overseers, armed soldiers, and machinery, the build sites were nothing too out of the ordinary to the outside observer.\n\nBut Summer Smile knew otherwise.\n\nSummer herself was a member of one of the several unions that operated in the area. She and her family had lived in the neighbourhood before her grandparents' were born, and like most others residents, their home was everything. The nearby workshops-turned-factories had provided hard but honest work that was stable and reliable. She had the chips on her hooves to show for it.\n\nIt all changed when the occupiers arrived.\n\nThey first offered paltry compensation for the families of Poplar Heights to vacate elsewhere. Many had, of course, refused and had organised to resist any attempt to move them. The residents had fought before against hired thugs from the factory owners and even armed soldiers with orders from Vermilion. They had every reason to expect another group of high-hooved bandits to limp back home with broken bones.\n\nSummer shuddered as the images of explosions erupting around the ranks of residents and protesting kirin flooded back into her mind. She later learned that the changelings used three field guns and two planes to bombard the erected barricades. Those who didn't immediately flee faced the onslaught of bombs. The many wounded who survived were then confronted by the organised and ruthless changeling soldiery. Poplar Heights burned that night.\n\nNow Summer glared at the kirin collaborators either working on the site or guarding it with the few changeling soldiers. Thankfully she didn't recognise any of the neighbours she knew. It was a small comfort, but she held on to it dearly, for she knew that nobody from her neighbourhood had the strength to stand up, not after the devastation and massacre.\n\nShe looked down upon herself. Summer's coat was matted, dirty, and completely unpresentable. Only the goodwill and kindness of strangers that took in her and her family had kept them alive so far. What was she to do now?"

Preliminary findings suggest additional benefits for the latter, and more will be known once all of the chemical compounds are isolated. No notable diminishing in the mental faculties has been detected besides some difficulties focusing on singular tasks or conversation subjects. No appreciable difference was noted between direct ingestion of mota rubra and drinking the tea-like drink brewed as per kirin tradition.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\nThere is a consensus among the team that the ingestion of mota rubra by kirin bears no greater risk than consuming alcohol. There is no reason to uphold the ban for civilian consumption to create consternation from the native kirin populations. Additionally, use by kirin auxiliaries may ensure loyalty towards changeling officers and should be encouraged. Upon complete chemical analysis, it may be possible to synthetically create an easy-to-swallow pill form of mota rubra to be dispensed widely among the kirin soldiery."

kirin_council.79.d:0 "The sun set over the city of Fragrance as patients filed into the waiting room of a doctor's clinic. Among them were kirin from all trots of life: a burly dock worker clad in a nondescript overcoat and fedora sat alongside a lawyerly-looking mare with silk cuffs, a lanky clerk wearing an MHI badge on his tie, a father and son, and a schoolfilly in uniform. Around a dozen had gathered by the time the last kirin arrived. Afterwards, a nurse emerged from behind the counter, flipping the sign on the entrance to 'CLOSED' and drawing the blinds.\n\nWordlessly, the kirin entered the back office. Once inside the dark and smoky room they all dropped their disguises simultaneously, revealing their true changeling forms. Not a minute passed before an elegant figure emerged from the basement, wreathed in shadow. It was Cheli Cerae—the Operationsdirektorin—conductor of this black orchestra.\n\n"Loyal soldiers," Cheli wasted no time addressing the assembled changelings, "In our hooves rests the tremendous responsibility of restoring glory to the changeling infiltrator tradition. Expelled from the homeland to these faraway lands; these distant shores are fertile soil for our tradition to flourish," she said in a low voice, her words ringing with deep conviction. "Our brethren are arriving from across the ocean as we speak, but you have the honour of being among the first to be given this solemn duty."\n\n"First we build our strength, then we assert control over this city, the Pearl of Kiria, and then we proliferate." Cheli's face twisted into a predatory grin. "Infiltrators from our proud order will be embedded in the highest echelons of Zebrican governments, institutions, and militaries. No matter what the ignorant masses might believe, we will be the ones pulling the strings."

Across from her sat Odorata, her boss.\n\nExcept it wasn't Odorata. Euodyn knew that the changeling drone who sat across from her was really Cheli Cerae, and Cheli knew that Euodyn knew.\n\nCheli was in Fragrance as Odorata, the drone technically in charge of the local MHI operation despite not actually doing any work. Evidently they had other priorities, but Euodyn wasn't bitter. After all, taking care of company business was simply her job. "Sir," Euodyn began, "In accordance with the company's objectives in Kiria, I will begin directing resources and funds back to the homeland without delay."\n\n"What?" Cheli said incredulously. "That will weaken the Fragrancese economy. Unacceptable. I need a strong Fragrance to accomplish my objectives. Can you possibly reduce the tithes?" Cheli took a lazy drag from their cigarette.\n\n"Absolutely not, sir." Euodyn shrugged. "MHI is here to collect on their investment. I would advise against impeding our mission here." Euodyn was completely calm. The message was clear: there was no room for negotiation.\n\n"Tch," Cheli stewed in annoyance for a moment before recovering. "Fine," they said, narrowing their eyes, "We will simply have to make up for the shortfall using other methods." Their mind raced with possibilities.

Her fellow kirin were becoming less and less active—it was as if a malaise was hanging over the city. Doing her own investigation into the matter and connecting dots had led her to a disturbing possibility: that changeling agents were tampering with the water supply.\n\nWeeks of clandestine observation provided more and more evidence for her hunch, but nothing definite yet. Just then, she witnessed something inconceivable. One of the kirin workers hauling barrels into the plant lost his balance, becoming soaked in liquid as the barrel's contents spilled out. Within seconds, he was out cold, remaining unresponsive even as his coworkers tried to rouse him.\n\nHer eyes went wide. It was the final piece of the puzzle, there was no longer any doubt standing in the way of a horrific conclusion: some kind of chemical compound was being put into Fragrance's water supply, intended to make the population docile and compliant.

They were veteran infiltrator-understudies of the Infiltrationsgruppe 'Maskerade': the last unterstudy-kompanie not disbanded after the Canterlot Defeat. Their name was a proud one, one often whispered in awe when spoken by ordinary changelings. Even so, the company had been gutted.\n\nThey were living legends, no doubt, but also the last of their breed. Only three dozen capable infiltrators trained in the old ways remained, and they were ageing. No traditionally-trained infiltrators had been produced in the years since the Canterlot Defeat. Most saw themselves as relics of a bygone era. That is, until Cheli Cerae gave them hope, along with a new mission.\n\nFifteen members of the Infiltrationsgruppe 'Maskerade' were to be given a crash course in kirin language, customs, politics, and history before returning to active service in the Ost-Zebrikan context. The remainder would become instructors for the Operationsdirektorin's brainchild: the Ost-Zebrikan Unterstudyschule. This school would train changeling infiltrators in the traditional ways and represent a bastion of ancient changeling tradition on alien shores.\n\nThe journey across the sea had been long, but there was no grumbling.

It all came naturally, like it was what she was born to do. The world was a stage and she was the lead actress. But her least favourite part was the factory shifts. Her instructors called it 'hybrid training'. She would take the form of a middle-level factory line manager. Her job was to act the part, supervise the workers, identify any potential troublemakers, ascertain whether they were merely dissatisfied or something more dangerous, like a union organiser, and if they were the latter neutralise them. Her other job was to collect love.\n\nShe did this by discretely syphoning love from the workers a little bit at a time. The side effect was that they returned home slightly more depressed and tired than they would otherwise normally be after each work day. None would be the wiser. After all, it would be stranger if a shift at that factory wasn't soul-crushing and miserable. Annoyingly, she didn't get to keep the love; she had to regurgitate it into a container for eventual transport.\n\nTime passed quickly. Days turned into weeks, then blurred together. After completion of her training Ludicatrix was promoted to Unteragent. The gruelling instruction proved to be invaluable preparation for her first real assignment: infiltrating Main Hive Industries.

In fact, many have dedicated themselves to doing just that," she said proudly, polishing one of the pins on her uniform.\n\nAfter leaving Sciaridae's office, Phylliini sighed deeply. Living in that shadow of one so brilliant was difficult. Sometimes, she even doubted herself.

kirin_council.892.d:0 "Tohmax Phantine fidgeted nervously as he sat on a truck bound for an underground MSWPK safehouse. The Liquidation Operation was already underway, and it was extraordinarily complex with countless moving parts, all intricately choreographed down to the precise minute. Even though this was the result of a long period of planning, he would be lying if he said he felt no trepidation at all.\n\nInfiltrators had done extensive work mapping out the organisational structure, hierarchy, membership, and internal culture of both the NRP and MSWPK. Key leaders, cells, safehouse locations, and more had all been identified. But the goal was not to destroy them. Instead, the plan was for infiltrators to move in simultaneously, replace their targets, and take over the dissident organisations.\n\nIn the end, Tohmax's fears were misplaced. The intelligence was flawless, and supplanting Hawthorn Blaze proved to be an absolute cakewalk. The other Unteragents enjoyed equal success, and the atmosphere inside the debriefing room where they all gathered afterwards was one of excitement and relief.\n\nNow, the Infils.-kommando Ost-Zebrika could wield the NRP and MSWPK like sock puppets, with their animated corpses attracting would-be dissidents and radicals and funnelling them straight into a trap. Lastly, [ROOT.GetLeader] himself had been replaced by a changeling understudy, who would have none of their ability at statesmareship, but would at least be compliant.\n\nEach of the former dissident groups were now run by Unteragents and their Abschnitt networks. Abschnitt ROSA and Unteragent Araneidae Biroi were responsible for the NRP, Abschnitt GRAU and Unteragent Xylida Orusso were to take over the functions of the civilian government, and Tohmax's own Abschnitt ROT was entrusted with taking over the MSWPK. He remembered Araneidae and Xylida from his days at the Ost-Zebrikan Unterstudyschule, and was happy for them both. He steeled himself; managing an entire network was a tremendous responsibility, but he was confident he could handle it."

"You may rise," Queen Chrysalis declared at last. Finicus let slip a small sigh of relief, before looking up to see the Queen towering over him in her throne. Finicus steeled himself, his mission was still before him: renegotiating Fragrance's tithes to Vesalipolis.\n\n"I am somewhat confused," Chrysalis hissed slowly, "It was my understanding that the entire reason we invested resources to aid your occupation of Fragrance was so that the city would send back resources and capital from Zebrica, exactly as you have been doing. Was I mistaken?" she asked, raising an eyebrow. "Tell me, am I wrong?" Finicus felt a wave of immense pressure, the invisible force of the Queen's authority weighing down on him. The rumours were true, Queen Chrysalis truly was an intimidating negotiator!\n\n"No, my Queen, you are not." Finicus replied, concealing his fear completely. "However, the tithes have proven to be too heavy a burden for Fragrance's economy to bear. The statistics are clear: more than a third of all resources and capital in the city are being remitted to Vesalipolis. If nothing is done, I fear Fragrance may collapse and become a drain on the Queendom's resources, instead of being an asset."\n\n"My, my my!" Chrysalis chucked. "I am impressed. Not many come into my throne room so boldly with a request such as this." She grinned, giving Finicus a clear view of her gleaming, razor sharp teeth. "Out of respect, I am willing to reduce the tithe." Finicus felt his heart skip a beat. "However! If I do this, I will be forced to withdraw military resources and support from the International City, since you would no longer be paying for it." Chrysalis kept her eyes glued on Finicus, taking pleasure in watching him squirm. "What will it be, hmm?""

kirin_council.91.t:0 "Where the World Ends" ##Part 1/2
kirin_council.91.d:0 "Summer Spice glanced left and right, taking in a landscape much flatter than the one she was accustomed to. This was the farthest she had ever travelled doing work for the MSWPK. The countryside was quaint, and it was nice to get away from the city. Or at least it would have been, if not for the acrid stench lingering in the air.\n\nShe was investigating the new power plants which had sprung up around the outskirts of Fragrance. "Changelings sure built the places fast..." she muttered to herself. Rumours swirled in teahouses and opium dens that something sinister was going inside these gleaming, new, efficient power plants that pumped out plumes of black smoke 24/7.\n\nShe kept an eye on the buildings from a safe distance, taking a swig from her flask. She only drank tea, as strong as she could brew it, or alcohol: water from the pipes was not to be trusted, and she wasn't sure whether the groundwater had been spiked either. Caffeine and ethanol seemed to combat the chemical that had been put in the city's water supply.\n\nHer attention was grabbed when a vanload of kirin arrived and were offloaded outside one of the plants. One of them turned nirik, erupting in ferocious flames. Summer watched as the nirik's... colleagues? attempted to flee, only to be met with rifle butts and truncheons wielded by changeling guards who corralled them together. One of the guards reacted quickly, shooting the nirik with some sort of rifle, which the guard then reloaded manually with a dart. The nirik was knocked out and turned normal within seconds. Her fellow prisoners were then forced to pick her up. Strange. She would have expected a harsher punishment; why would they tolerate something so dangerous?\n\nA side door on the plant opened, and as the kirin were being led through it she knew this was her chance. Risks be damned, she had to get inside! Making sure there were no sentries that might see, she raced towards the door, and towards the source of that pungent smell."
kirin_council.91.a:0 "Time to get to the bottom of this..."

kirin_council.912.t:0 "The Nirik Factory" ##Part 2/2
kirin_council.912.d:0 "The interior of the power plant was a maze of dimly-lit corridors, lined with pipes and unfamiliar machines. Summer Spice managed to tail the group of kirin while remaining undetected. Eventually, the prisoners were led to a gigantic furnace. She recognized it as the kind where fuel was burnt to boil water, which then generated steam, moving power-generating turbines. The kirin were held down by guards, one by one, and injected with a needle.\n\nWhen one of the needles snapped off in the neck of a kirin, the guards just laughed and injected them with another one. "Despicable... so those things are disposable, and apparently inexpensive," she muttered to herself. Soon, the kirin began to shake, and the guards forced them all into the furnace at bladepoint.\n\nThe furnace door slammed shut with a heavy thud and locked. Horrible screams emanated from the furnace. Summer Spice gasped. The kirin were turning nirik. These were the chilling nirik screams of a kirin having lost all sense of self, gone feral. Water began to steam, and the turbines began to turn.\n\nShe was close enough to hear the guards banter. "How long will this bunch last?" asked one. "Well, the last batch lasted us a full day." replied another. There was no escaping the horrifying conclusion. Kirin could not sustain the nirik state for long: they literally burn themselves out. Maintaining the flames burned a lot of calories, energy, until all that remained was a husk. Being a nirik was like being a burning candle.\n\nAnd that fire was being harvested.\n\nHer blood ran cold. One emotion blotted out all others: sheer terror, the kind only felt by prey that looked into the eyes of an unstoppable predator. Summer Spice became consumed by that overwhelming fear. She abandoned all thought of her mission. All she cared about now was fleeing the power plant as fast as possible."

kirin_council.92.d:0 ""It's settled, then." Cheli Cerae exhaled a puff of smoke as she scrutinised the map of Kiria she and her most trusted lieutenants had gathered around. She pointed a hoof towards Auburn Isle. "Our target shall be the Pirates of Nacre. Their leader, Roaring Fire, is on the run, and her armada has scattered. However, its remnants and stragglers remain; unorganised seafaring bandits, lacking any purpose. Let's be generous and give them one." Cheli's face twisted into a wicked smile.\n\n"We will infiltrate the pirates on the Isle, reorganising them under a Changeling Unteragent and her lieutenants. We will replace the captains of pirate junks, who command the largest pirate raiding parties," she continued, producing a list of active captains on Auburn Isle. "They will follow our actor, who will unite the scattered pirates and lead them to seize Hyacinth and the Auburn Isle." Her hoof swept from the Isle to Hyacinth on the mainland.\n\n"Afterwards, there will be a frenzy of piracy: a spree of violence and devastation. Complete chaos! It will become clear to all that the Kirian government is unable to maintain order and protect those poor, innocent kirin," she said with a theatrical frown. Several of her lieutenants chuckled.\n\n"Then it will be us, the International City of Fragrance, who will swoop in to save the day. We will retake Hyacinth and Auburn Isle, subdue the pirates, and restore order to the Auburn Channel under our benevolent, firm and competent rule." Cheli finished outlining the plan with a flourish. Her lieutenants were buzzing with excitement. They had all outdone themselves: it was the perfect plan. All that remained now was putting it in motion."

At that moment, the cove's attention was captured by a mysterious mare who had arrived wearing an ostentatious captain's uniform.\n\n"This isn't what I expected at all!" Her sharp voice rang out across the cove. "What a sad sight... I heard that the Pirates of Nacre were supposed to be fearsome, but all I see is a bunch of miserable, pathetic kirin." She shook her head slowly. "Are you still even pirates?"\n\nAngry howls filled the air, mixing with the lingering stench of booze "It's not our fault! Roaring Fire disappeared, she abandoned us!" shouted one outlaw. "Yeah, did you just come here to rub it in?" shouted another.\n\n"Not at all! You see, my mother may have abandoned you, but I have not. Allow me to introduce myself: I am Crimson Line, love child of pirate queen Roaring Fire!" she proclaimed proudly, following it up with a theatrical bow. The crowd could not help but let out a collective gasp of surprise. "If you doubt my claim, your captains will vouch for me. Go to any junk and ask! Now allow me to repeat myself: are you pirates?"\n\n"Tartarus yeah, we are!" barked a burly stallion, prompting enthusiastic agreement from the other buccaneers. Some had a hard time accepting her story, but this young mare was undeniably charismatic.\n\n"That's right, we're pirates!" Crimson Line shouted, raising up a hoof. "I shall lead you, and together we will retake what is rightfully ours: all of Hyacinth and Auburn Isle. We will restore pirate rule, along with our old glory!" As she finished her speech, rowdy cheers filled the air. The pirates were inspired, and felt ready to challenge all of Kiria.\n\nWhat none of them knew was the fact that Crimson Line was actually a changeling, or that changelings had already infiltrated the pirate remnants' leadership. It was thanks to these agents that the stage was set for a pirate resurgence."

His gaze was directed towards the fleet of junks floating in the warm, shallow waters, which were in the process of being refitted. They were old, traditional kirin junks made out of softwood, their distinctive sails jutting up towards the clear sky.\n\nThe entire fleet combined would be no match for even a single frigate equipped with modern weapons and armour. This was this fleet that would convey the reorganised Pirates of Nacre on their mission to conquer the Auburn Channel; the ships were armed only with outdated cannon, but those museum pieces would be more than enough to defeat the meagre kirin militias that garrisoned Hyacinth and Auburn Isle.\n\nHe focused his binoculars on the decks of the junks, watching as workers sweated in the warm sunlight applying the finishing touch: black flags on the masts. Perfect. And as a final precaution, just in case, each ship had explosives hidden in the hull. A powerful bomb activated through radio control on a specific frequency known only to changeling agents like himself."

They hoped it was a sign of calmer days ahead.\n\nAt that very moment, an invisible swarm was descending upon the town.\n\nWith practised speed, changeling infiltrators replaced the commanding officers of Hyacinth's coastal defences and garrison, alongside leaders at the local militia headquarters. But that was not all. Infiltrators also targeted communication and transportation infrastructure: postal, telegraph, and railway offices. When the pirates came calling, they would ensure Hyacinth's defences folded immediately.\n\nThey were tasked with laying the groundwork for the pirate occupation, which was to be followed by Fragrance's occupation when the time came to retake the channel. Most importantly, they were to prepare all rail, communications lines, and bridges to the kirin mainland to be cut as soon as the pirates landed. Their sabotage would leave Hyacinth vulnerable and ripe for the picking."

kirin_council.96.d:0 "All of Kiria is looking on in horror, as reports are coming in of absolute bedlam in the Auburn Channel. In a truly stunning development, the Pirates of Nacre have seized Auburn Isle and Hyacinth in a lightning attack, completely overrunning the kirin garrison. The marauders then wasted no time launching a reign of terror and going on a rampage of looting and destruction.\n\nDuring the pirate offensive, they sank not only kirin ships and attacked kirin soldiers, but also a Fragrancese merchantmare moored in Hyacinth harbour that was transporting civil war orphans. The International City of Fragrance has condemned Vermilion for letting the security situation in the channel deteriorate to such a point, and have pledged to launch their own expedition to restore order and stability to the channel.\n\nIn light of Fragrence's swift reaction compared to Vermilion's inaction and incompetence, there are those who suspect Fragrence of pulling the strings behind the attack. Given the superb timing and organisation, it is doubtful that the pirates were capable of planning it themselves.\n\nLending credence to such rumours, the pirates seem to be led and commanded by a group of mostly-green kirin mares dressed in nondescript but high-quality uniforms that are a cut above the pirate rags worn by typical raiders. These "little green mares" are believed to be Fragrancese agents. In particular, one diminutive green mare with a black mane is reported to have fought with terrifying ferocity, claiming the lives of many kirin."

He levitated a pointer toward the map of Hyacinth on the wall behind hum, a sharp tapping sound cutting through the low hum of the projector. "Here's the game plan: invade Hyacinth first to secure the city, and a hoofhold in Kiria." The projector image changed to reflect the changeling plan of attack, black arrows stretching from the sea to the heart of the city. "That is the most important aspect of our mission - to secure a hoofhold in Kiria. We must secure the city first, before the kirin can recapture it." His gruff voice conveyed a palpable sense of urgency.\n\n"Speed is key." Orax stomped a hoof for emphasis. "This invasion is a race against the clock!" He wore a stern expression for a long moment, making the troops anxious, before breaking into a small grin. "The good news is the way has been paved for us, we can thank the infiltrators already in Hyacinth for that. We have accurate intelligence on the details of Hyacinth's coastal fortifications, including which ones are left." The pirate onslaught had done considerable damage to the city's defences.\n\n"Our second objective is Auburn Isle. The kirin navy is weak, so it's unlikely they'll get there before us." Orax made a gesture with his hoof, and the image behind him changed to a photo of the Isle. "Once we control Hyacinth, we can use it as a base for a nice, leisurely naval invasion of Auburn Isle, which will be an almost guaranteed victory." His forecast drew quizzical looks from some of the soldiers. Wouldn't taking the Isle be difficult? Orax's face broke into a confident smile. "I have a hunch Crimson Line's defences won't be very formidable. But don't worry about that. Just do your jobs, and it'll all work out splendidly.""

Do you think I would still be here if I was?!"\n\nDayspring took a step back, shocked by the former pirate queen's fury. When news had reached Vermilion about the seizure of the Auburn channel by a resurgent pirate fleet, her first instinct had been to assume Roaring Fire, the once pirate queen of the Pirates of Nacre, knew something about it. Instead, her probing questions had only elicited confusion, confusion that gave way to sharp and burning anger once she had explained the situation to Roaring. "Don't turn," Dayspring cautioned the pirate, noting the wisps of pink flame and glow settling over the scoundrel's eyes. "But you seriously don't know anything about this? These pirates once sailed under your flag. Surely you would have heard something."\n\n"I have heard nothing," Roaring Fire snapped back, and after gritting her teeth, she managed to step away from the nirik state and calm herself somewhat. "I disbanded my fleet, dismissed my lieutenants. We scattered to the winds when it was clear our time was over. If they had decided to come back, they would have found some way to contact me, not keep me out of the loop." She swished her tail in anger, glaring south over the countryside where some distant body of water shimmered, waiting for her. "Who did you say was leading them?"\n\n"She calls herself Crimson Line," Dayspring answered, then added, "She, um, claims she's your daughter."\n\n"If I had a daughter, somehow I think I would have known," Roaring Fire remarked, flicking her tail again. Then her glare turned in the opposite direction, toward the north east. "Fragrance is filled with shapeshifters now, right? I bet those insects have something to do with it.

"What a wonderful performance!" she exclaimed. But the Operationsdirektorin had some sobering words to add next. "Enjoy this moment, but keep in mind it was a unique confluence of circumstances that enabled our victory. It's unlikely we can replicate such a feat, which was specific to the geography, history, circumstances — everything about our operation."\n\n"But that doesn't mean this was a fluke; far from it," she continued. "Merely that future operations will look quite different. Unlike our dogmatic colleagues back home, we are able to innovate, adapt constantly, change our doctrines, rather than be stuck in ossified repetition of tried-and-true tactics that will quickly become outdated anyway." Her subordinates all wore serious looks as they absorbed her words of wisdom, with many nodding solemnly in acknowledgement.\n\n"And so, let us toast to change!" Cheli raised her glass, smiling.

kirin_council.99.d:0 "Unteragent Ludicatrix leisurely sipped her drink as her eyes scanned the dingy bar. This was rock bottom: a place frequented by the dregs of Fragrancese society, kirin who lived on the edge. It was an easy place for a changeling to blend in. Of course, at that moment, she didn't look like a changeling. Instead she was disguised as a kirin mare. If asked by her superiors she would say she was intelligence gathering, but really it was just for fun.\n\nA few minutes earlier a small, wiry kirin had quietly entered the tavern and slipped into a booth, unnoticed by most of the other patrons. But it did not escape Ludicatrix's trained gaze. She had to admit, she was intrigued by the hiding mare. There was something about her she couldn't quite put her hoof on...\n\nA loud bang resounded across the bar, derailing her train of thought. Two changelings had entered, whispering to each other and squinting as their eyes adjusted to the darkness. She didn't recognise either of them. Apparently deciding she looked friendlier than the other patrons, they approached her.\n\n"Excuse me, miss," said one politely. "Have you seen a suspicious-looking kirin come through here?" Ludicatrix raised an eyebrow. "Short stature, about this tall?" he added, helpfully raising a hoof.\n\n"Oh, I have!" Ludicatrix said, eyes widening in faux-realisation. "She went through that back door over there. If you hurry, you might be able to catch up." After quickly thanking her, the two changelings rushed through the door and away from their target. She had just lied, and she wasn't even sure why.\n\nThe hiding mare didn't acknowledge the exchange at all, but she must have heard it, because she wasted no time taking advantage of the misdirection. Surrounded by an aura of determination, the mysterious mare gracefully slithered out of her booth and left the tavern. Without thinking, Ludicatrix rose out of her seat to follow her."

That was really lucky, she mused. Just when things were looking dicey inside that tavern, a kirin—a complete stranger—had decided to help her out and throw those changelings off her trail, which certainly made escaping easier.\n\nHer thoughts drifted to that generous mare. Helping her slip away was both brave and foolish. In fact, it was incredibly dangerous! Hopefully the changelings wouldn't come after her for retribution. She considered trying to track the stranger down to thank her, but she didn't want to put her in any more risk. Just then, somehow, she heard that same voice again from behind her.\n\n"Hello there!" Ludicatrix called out, still wearing her kirin disguise. She was slightly out of breath, having gone a long way just to find out more about this puzzling mare. "I didn't get a chance to introduce myself properly before," she trotted forward, grinning. The small mare calmly turned around and looked her right in the eyes. "My name is Song Thrush," Ludicatrix said, her heart skipping a beat. Those eyes were beautiful, but 'beautiful' didn't do them justice. There was an ineffable strength and nobility that shone through.\n\n"I'm Summer Spice," she replied matter-of-factly. "Thank you." Summer Spice bowed her head slightly. "I'm sorry, but I don't have any money to reward you with, if that's what you're after."\n\n"No! Not at all!" Ludicatrix blurted out, waving a hoof frantically. The question rattled around her head. Why had she come all this way? Why? "Actually, I was just wondering if, um maybe," she gulped. Her throat had become dry shockingly fast.

It's about the changelings."\n\nBehind her mask, Ludicatrix's blood ran cold. "I've been investigating them ever since they got here, and... you wouldn't believe what they've been doing right under our noses." Summer Spice revealed all the terrible secrets she had uncovered to Ludicatrix. To prove it was not idle speculation, she produced a well-worn notebook, documenting her findings and even including photographic evidence.\n\nLudicatrix was shocked that a single kirin had managed to find out so much about their operation, while Song Thrush wore a face of grim acknowledgement.\n\n"Knowing all that, you probably think it's hopeless, but I don't." Summer Spice clenched a defiant hoof. "The Fragrancese have a right to know. I believe in shedding light on the truth, emancipating knowledge, and striking down our oppressors, so that we can have economic justice and equality." She had launched fully into an impassioned monologue. "As long as we don't give up, there are no secrets they can keep from us, and there's no future we can't achieve." Summer Spice's eyes shone with an impossible brightness.\n\nLudicatrix nodded in awe. She would have expected such confidence from a kirin who was ignorant of the truth, but it was stunning coming from a kirin who had peeled back the curtain of the Masquerade. That determination. That willpower! It was what she really, truly loved about Summer Spice.\n\nBut right now, those feelings were getting in the way, clouding her judgement. She felt torn between love and duty. "I feel the exact same way," she lied.\n\nSummer Spice embraced her, tears in her eyes. "Thank goodness!" She pulled away and wiped her eyes.

Summer Spice's face lit up at the sight of her marefriend and the reunited lovers embraced one another tightly. "Don't worry, I'm going to get you out of here," Ludicatrix promised.\n\nThe two were allowed to leave without incident, to Summer Spice's astonishment. Even as they trotted together through the streets of Fragrance, she pried. She questioned Song Thrush about how she had managed to get her released, to no avail. Her frustration mounted until they were safely within the walls of her apartment, when Song Thrush revealed her true nature.\n\n"My name... isn't Song Thrush. It's Ludicatrix," she said, wearing a conflicted expression. "This whole time, I've been a changeling infiltrator." It pained her to say it, that she was the very embodiment of everything Summer Spice despised: the foreign, colonial oppressor occupying Fragrance. Ludicatrix unceremoniously dropped her disguise. "But I really do love you, that wasn't a lie," she continued. "I can prove it to you. Run away with me. Let's leave this all behind!"

"They call it the Metropolis on the Marekong, I can't wait to see all the sights!"\n\n"Sounds... exciting," Summer Spice replied, looking down at the rippling water. There was a glimmer of sadness in her eyes. Although she had agreed to run away with Ludicatrix, their relationship had been badly wounded by Ludicatrix's revelations.

Rebuilding the connection between them—and trust that had been lost—would be a long and difficult road, but she was prepared to do whatever it took. "Trust me," Ludicatrix said, taking her partner's hoof. "We'll make it work, together." She grinned, and Summer Spice's lips curled up into a weak smile.\n\nIn truth, they both were unsure of the future that lay ahead of them. But one thing was certain: they still had each other."

"Asking me to abandon my home, my ideals? I can't do that, you know I have a duty to the cause." Summer Spice glared at Ludicatrix with steely eyes.\n\nLudicatrix let out a huff of disbelief. "Can't you see? Your revolution is doomed. It's never going to happen," she said calmly, simply stating facts. "Forget all about Fragrance. I love you, that's why I want you to come with me. Don't throw your life away for nothing!" Why, she thought, why was it so hard to make this stubborn mare understand?\n\nSummer Spice was completely unphased. "I'm not going to run away, no matter what. I wont give up on what I believe in." Far from questioning her mission, she had become even more determined. "You say you love me, but why should I even believe you after everything you've said? You just admitted you've been lying this whole time!"\n\n"I do, I really do! Our love is true..." Ludicatrix insisted, but it was no use. Summer Spice looked upon her with an expression of pure disgust. That look was so devastating she couldn't think of anything else to say. Tears began to well up in her eyes.\n\nSummer Spice shook her head wordlessly and turned around. It must have been too painful to talk any further. In that moment, Ludicatrix's resolve returned. She was no longer confused; she knew what she had to do. Taking aim with a concealed dart gun, she said a silent goodbye before pulling the trigger.\n\nAll Summer Spice felt was a small, sharp pain before the Foal's Breath tranquilliser spread through her system, sending her tumbling to the ground. Wasting no time, Ludicatrix cocooned her in preparation for her arrest and inevitable interrogation by the Infiltrationskommando. Summer Spice had chosen duty over love. With their romance over, Ludicatrix was forced to do the same."

After all, everykirin had to put food on the table somehow.\n\nUntil one day, out of the blue, her normally tight-lipped supervisor invited her as his plus one to a mysterious ball. The grand ballroom was filled with high-society types, all wearing masks. The partygoers danced and caroused as orchestral music filled the air. All except Pale Fire herself, who instead stayed near a tray of hors d'oeuvres, sipping on wine and munching on canapés.\n\nThe climax of the ball came without warning: the lights cut out, leaving the room in total darkness. When they came back on, they were tinted a sickly greyish-green. Pale Fire looked around and saw that the guests had all removed their masks and dropped their disguises, revealing themselves to be changelings. She screamed, but froze in place.\n\n"This is your initiation into the masquerade," came a soothing voice. Her love was being sucked, but she remained fully conscious. It was unpleasant, but not lethal. "Now you know the true nature of Fragrance's rulers. You have been entrusted with this great secret. Welcome to our ranks, our loyal comprador."

This group denounces us as foreign imperialists plundering Kiria. They call us a stain on the Realm, locusts to be eradicated, and worse.\n\nIn addition, the Society to Pierce the Veil is gathering support in Greater Providence and North Kiria, especially in the city of Rhapsody. The Society's self-professed mission is to reconquer Fragrance from the "changeling invaders" and cast us out of Kiria and Zebrica altogether. They have many followers and are led by Way of Fire mystics who use religious rhetoric to sway the masses into a fury against us. Essentially, their entire ideology boils down to anti-changeling populism.\n\nThis presents us with an opportunity. The Society is radical, militant, and bellicose. However, Vermilion is more cautious; they clearly do not want war. Vermilion's moderation absolutely infuriates the northern mystics. If we replace the right kirin, and give the northerners a push in the right direction, they may decide to take matters into their own hooves and march to war against us, in defiance of Vermilion. Then, we would of course be fully justified in defending ourselves, by launching an expedition to restore order to Rhapsody, the seat of the rebels.\n\nThat would be quite a fortuitous development for us, if we could bring it about."

With this support, the Society will no doubt become ever bolder in pursuit of their fantastical mission to drive us out of the continent.\n\nReports are already coming in from our agents that they are allowing the Righteous Realm Movement's agitator-mystics to give speeches in public places, as well as instructing the Guards Vigilant to turn a blind eye to the mobbing and beating of pro-changeling collaborators from Fragrance.

There was no shortage of northern kirin who absolutely hated the changeling presence in Fragrance.\n\n"Changelings are imperialists, pests, locusts, cockroaches, a black stain on our beautiful Realm! They are in bed with the NAKP scum who ruined the north with their foolish war against Vermilion. They are greedy foreign capitalists, opportunists who took advantage of Vermilion's weakness to seize Auburn Island and Hyacinth!" The agitator-mystic shouted, riling up the mass of seething kirin.\n\n"They kicked us while we were down, stealing Fragrance and the Auburn Channel. Proud kirin, ready yourselves! The time approaches when we will squash these roaches once and for all!" He raised a hoof high in the air, his words whipping the crowd into a frenzy. As northerners, the object of their hatred was right next door, a constantly looming threat. Swept up in the emotion of the moment, every one of them was ready to march all the way to the changeling homeland.\n\nBut what the crowd did not know was that changeling infiltrators had begun to disguise themselves as agitator-mystics such as this one, adopting the Righteous Realm Movement's bellicose rhetoric with the goal of stoking anti-changeling sentiment.

Lately, trucks and barges filled with guns had been flowing into the Providence Demesne, and there seemed to be no end in sight. The weapons were to arm the Society to Pierce the Veil and the anti-changeling movement it led.\n\nAfter the barge docked, the crowd wasted no time off-loading its precious cargo. Inside were weapons of all kinds: swords, spears, outdated lever-action rifles, Hindian breech-loaders, sabres, and antiquated Griffonian cannon. They were no match for truly modern military hardware, but for a bunch of enthusiastic amateurs that didn't matter. The kirin were eager to get their hooves on whatever they could.\n\nA grizzled kirin emerged from the barge, grabbing the crowd's attention. "Everykirin, I have an announcement, a message from our Society's leaders!" He smiled internally, knowing that those leaders were in fact changeling infiltrators like himself. "They have declared the formation of the Righteous Realm Army, tasked with the divine mission to reconquer Fragrance from the foreign imperialist pests and restore it to the Kirian fold and Concord's loving embrace.

Surprisingly, the traditionally cautious Procurate of Rhapsody stepped aside and let the Righteous Army take control of the city, its arsenals, and allowed the soldiers of its Guards Vigilant to join the Righteous Army.\n\nAt this very moment, the Righteous Army is marching on Fragrance, attacking changeling border checkpoints and outposts, looting changeling-owned warehouses, destroying property, and generally wreaking havoc. All the while loudly proclaiming their divine mission to exterminate the changelings and free Kiria from foreign control and influence, causing many foreign civilians to flee the countryside in terror, taking refuge in Fragrance.\n\nThis turn of events has taken Vermilion completely by surprise. They have no love for the changelings either, but the Righteous Army has essentially stolen Rhapsody and the Providence Demesne from the central government in order to wage this war. Vermilion is in chaos as they try to figure out what's happening, and it is uncertain how long that state of confusion will last.\n\nIn the meantime, the International City's defence force is preparing to repel the attack of the mob, then march on Rhapsody to restore order, since Vermilion has clearly lost control of the region."

Sensing blood in the water, Vermilion has finally gotten their act together and declared war on us.\n\nThe Righteous Realm Army wasted little time swearing loyalty to Vermilion, and now they are fighting together on the same side. There was nothing our infiltrators could do to prevent this; the visceral anti-changeling sentiment combined with impending victory was simply too powerful of a feeling to co-opt or control.

Vermilion has nokirin left to support, so they won't get involved. We will continue to occupy the region to supervise the eradication of the illegal and destabilising anti-changeling sentiments spread by the now-outlawed Society to Pierce the Veil, and to extract war reparations.

"Artificer Focus. I was surprised when my secretary informed me this morning that you had requested a meeting with me. Please, come in. To what do I owe the honor?"\n\nFocus stepped into the room and gravitated toward a chair. No sooner had he taken it did the observant kirin awkwardly clear his throat. "Is it such an honor? Chairkirin, in the interest of time, I will state the reason I am here simply and plainly. I am here on behalf of the Artificers' Guild to lodge a formal complaint against the Sycee Trading House and the undue and anti-competitive behavior they have engaged in with the NAKP. The NAKP's favoritism towards Sycee has allowed the Trading Houses to benefit from roughly double the economic and business opportunities as the Artificers' Guild despite the fact that we pay the same in corporate tithes to the party. The Guild gives as much to the Realm's economy and defense as Sycee does yet we reap half the rewards. This is hardly equitable. As such, the Guild humbly requests that the Matriarchate's Government equalizes the balance of power between themselves and the Trading House so that the free market remains free and is not monopolized by Sycee." His statement finished, Focus finished with an abrupt nod. "I trust I have made my point clear?"\n\nThe statement had caught Current off guard, but as an experienced negotiator, he managed to keep his face expressionless. "I believe you have," he replied. "But I feel I should clarify that the free market applies to the NAKP as much as it does to the VasCorps. We are free to choose whom we conduct business with. All our VasCorps are important members of the Realm and the party values their contributions equally."\n\n"If that were the case I would not be here," Focus said.

As he approached the table, orange eyes from across it met his, and after taking a long drag on her cigarette holder, Silver Silks stepped away from the table and beckoned for him to follow.\n\n"Thank you for coming, Chairkirin," Silver said once the two of them had taken a private booth at the back of the room.

"Then I'll keep things short and simple for your sake, Chairkirin. Sycee finds the favoritism the NAKP is showing toward the Artificer's Guild unacceptable. We pay equal tithes yet they are afforded twice the opportunity and twice the profits of the Trading House. This is anti-competitive behavior, and we have already lodged a formal complaint with the party over our disrespectful treatment. To make it even more clear, Fickle, I'll put it this way. If the party does not do right by Sycee, then we will be forced to escalate the matter. And I'd hate to bet against the House if we do.""

And when she squared off against an opponent before a judge, her arguments would bite hard and drag her unfortunate victim down into the dirt until Sycee's coffers bled it dry under mountains of litigation.\n\nAnd so it was as Madame Silvertael boarded her airship with Sycee's negotiation team en route to [KIS.Capital.GetName]. As the discontent and jockeying between the Trading House and the Artificers' Guild festered, the two VasCorps had taken to litigious thrusts, parries, and ripostes at each other in the Realm's courts. But litigation was expensive, especially between two heavyweight fighters with deep coffers and the willingness to go all-in to box out the competition, and so Madame Silvertael, once a renowned and notoriously successful lawyer in Skyfall before returning to Kiria, had decided to personally involve herself in the fight. By throwing her hat into the ring, Sycee's chairmare hoped to deliver a final, crushing blow to the Artificers' Guild.\n\nAs she addressed a crowd of gathered reporters before stepping onto her airship, the old mare assured them that it was her goal to find a resolution that pleases everykirin, as the ongoing feud benefitted nokirin. And, with a smile, she hinted that she'd already found an angle of attack that would deliver a fatal blow to the Guild's lawsuits and prove Sycee was in the right the entire time."

After an extensive search and rescue operation, reports have confirmed that the airship belonged to Madame Silvertael, the chairmare of the Sycee Trading House, who was due to arrive in [KIS.Capital.GetName] this morning. How the airship ended up so far off course is unknown, but the current rumors suggest that anarchists hijacked and redirected the ship before crashing it into the ocean.

Citing evidence gathered from the crash site from the Procurate of Rhapsody's investigator-magistrates, Silver's first statement as chairmare was to accuse the All-Kiria Artificers' Guild of arranging the hijacking of her aunt's airship by terrorists. The Guild immediately responded that such heinous accusations are false and announced it would commence libel proceedings against Sycee. Silver Silks, in turn, announced that the Trading House would reallocate its legal funding toward an increase in the budget of its security assets, a response mirrored by the Artificers' Guild."

kirin_council.504.d:0 "Fickle Current rubbed his eyes and frowned into his cup of coffee as the Iron Chrysanthemum captain in the boardroom explained the situation to him, Cypress Snow, and several other high ranking kirin of the NAKP. The sun had yet to rise, and wouldn't for several more hours, but the developing situation in the Empire was grave enough that it required an immediate meeting despite the early hour of the morning.\n\nAs Current listened to the captain's report, his eyes grew darker, his frown sharper, even as the other kirin present muttered in alarm or disquiet. The situation over the dispute between the Sycee Trading House and the Artificers' Guild was growing and escalating at an alarming rate. In Fragrance alone there had been two dozen hostile takeover attempts of Sycee or Guild subsidiaries by corporate raiders. The two VasCorps had begun using their security forces to interdict and seize convoys of goods and supplies belonging to their rival, and several reports of violent clashes between the two sides had already been reported and verified by the NAKP's investigative apparatus. On top of that, the Guild Technical College on the outskirts of Massicot was attacked by guerillas flying the banner of the Cascading Sparks, the flag of the rebellious western provinces, with students and faculty butchered and their labs and libraries burned to the ground; the Guild accused Sycee of staging the attack, but Sycee denied any involvement. Then there was the chilling story of a Sycee showroom raided by a paramilitary force wielding magitech rifles and wearing the patches of the defunct Realm and Harmony Party, with the top executives of several Sycee subsidiaries who were there on a meeting murdered in the chaos; Sycee accused the Guild of staging the attack, but the Guild denied any involvement. It appeared the two companies were engaging in espionage and banditry using the symbols of the Empire's enemies for plausible deniability.\n\nThe news was proving devastating to the economy, with stocks tumbling and the NAKP having to reach deep into its coffers to stabilize the markets. On top of that, the Marksist-Stallionist Workers' Party of Kiria was growing in size and staging strikes and trot-outs all across Greater Providence, and the NAKP found itself stretched thin to stop those subversive activities. But even then, it was clear that the strikes would hurt Sycee's sweatshops far more than they would the Guild's studios, and it left little wonder as to where such a fringe political group managed to find the funds to organize to such an extent..."

kirin_council.505.d:0 "Cypress Snow was surprised to see the half-emptied bottle of brandy sitting on Chairkirin Current's desk when he entered his study. It wasn't that the NAKP's chairkirin was enjoying a drink that surprised him, but rather the brand. It was fairly cheap stuff, strong but lacking in the flavors and subtleties of finer brands. Looks like the Chairkirin intended to replace tonight's headache with a much stronger one tomorrow morning.\n\nStill, Cypress opened with a friendly jab as he sat down across from Fickle, who stared into the glass he swirled with his magic. "I thought I taught you to drink better than that in Yale," he teased him. Current scoffed lightly, but he didn't return the barb, and Cypress' features grew sterner. "That bad?"\n\n"Never before has the "Vas" part of "VasCorps" felt more fitting than now," Current said with a sigh, and he pushed a dossier over to Cypress. As the elder kirin leafed through it, Current elaborated. "The situation with Sycee and the Guild is deteriorating faster than anykirin would have thought. There's been an alarming increase in mercenary activities and terror attacks in the land those two control, each with enough plausible deniability for the VasCorps to deny any involvement. There was a shootout at the Grand Canterlot Teahouse, for example. My sources claim that Sycee-sponsored operatives attacked and destroyed the Guild's subsidiary. Many kirin went nirik and the whole thing burned down. The whole neighborhood was filled with paper houses that went up in flames too; we're still sifting through the dead."\n\n"I thought I heard something to that effect," Cypress agreed. "And I take it the other VasCorps haven't had much to say?"\n\n"They have not. They're probably negotiating with both sides as we speak. For now we can assume they're loyal, but tomorrow isn't today..." Current sighed and took another drink from his glass, a long and slow one. When he set it down he shook his head. "Maybe they know something we don't. I can't tell. And now I feel like a king sitting on his throne watching his vassals quarrel among each other, wondering how long I can hold my realm together. I think you'll forgive me a stiff drink over a good one in times like these.""

The early hour of the emergency meeting left him rubbing at his eyes as he settled in; he would need a double shot of espresso when this was over just to get himself back up to speed. "Let's hear the bad news."\n\nA mare in a black suit nodded and pulled a sheet of paper out of her briefcase as Fickle and the other kirin of the NAKP's executive council leaned in closer to hear her words. "At midnight last night, the Artificiers' Guild issued an ultimatum to Sycee to cease all aggression and pay reparations in damages for the actions they have undertaken against the Guild's holdings and corporate interests. They claim that Sycee's actions are illegal and contrary to the Imperial Code and the Way of Fire, and a direct challenge to the ultimate authority of the NAKP's rule of Kiria and the divine authority of the Matriarch Superior. Once again, they denied all involvement in the death of Sycee's former chairmare and expressed their desires to return to a more respectful business relationship."\n\nThe mare set the paper down and picked up another one. "Sycee's response was an immediate repudiation of the Guild's ultimatum. Chairmare Silver Silks reiterated her demands that the Artificers' Guild formally apologize for the murder of her aunt and to pay reparations to the Trading Houses in light of their heinous acts of corporate espionage and murder. She stressed that Sycee would be forced to take 'extraordinary action' to recoup its losses at the hooves of the Guild if it did not do so. The Guild immediately rejected Sycee's counter demands, and that's where things stand now. The other VasCorps have begun evacuating their assets and capital from the rival guilds' headquarters in Sycee and Massicot, as they claim they are too dangerous to continue to do business in."\n\nThe mare set down her papers and looked Current in the eyes. "As of a little over an hour ago, we have heard reports of intensifying fighting in Sycee and Massicot. The two VasCorps are no longer denying their involvement in each other's affairs, it would seem. Kirin have been identified on both sides wearing the uniforms and wielding the weapons of each VasCorp's preferred security forces. I think we all know what this means.""
kirin_council.506.a:0 "We're standing on the brink of a war between two VasCorps."

kirin_council.507.t:0 "Corporate War"
kirin_council.507.d:0 "The ExecCo was in turmoil, and Fickle Current had been up since dawn pulling his mane out.\n\nThere was no more pretense to the game anymore: earlier that week, the Sycee Trading House and the All-Kiria Artificers' Guild had formally declared the beginning of 'hostile business relations' with each other, immediately followed by clashes and open combat between the two VasCorp's private security arms in the fields of the Vespertine Valley. In Sycee's holdings from the Comely Cape to the Peaks of Peril, and in the Guild's demesne from their Massicot headquarters to the southeastern coastlands, the two VasCorps had locked down their territory, rallied their private armies, and set all their industry and subsidiaries to produce equipment and materiel for a war at full bore. Even in Vermilion, the rumbling of distant artillery was difficult to ignore.\n\nThe problems did not stop there; no, they were only the beginning. The war was already undercutting the NAKP's authority over the Realm, as banners that would normally be supplied to the Imperial Kirian Army by the Guild and Sycee had instead defected to their parent corporations and both sides refused to engage in dialogue with the ExecCo while there was still 'unfinished business' to be dealt with. A consortium of the VasCorps led by the Sorghum Foundry had unilaterally declared that they would keep the conflict out of the heartlands of the Realm, and established the Mellifluve Delta Authority that would answer to the consortium's board, not the ExecCo. On top of that, local NAKP governors and commanders of Civil Defense in the western reaches of the Realm had declared the Government for Peace and Security in the West, effectively establishing a western governorate independent of the party's control. In the blink of an eye, Fickle Current found his hold on the Realm effectively quartered with nothing more than lip service from its constituents to assure him of their loyalty.\n\nBut to Current, that was not the worst part. The worst came when the ExecCo preemptively vetoed any attempts by the state to intervene in what was happening, citing Article 12 of the Imperial Code and stressing that the state must not interfere in intercorporate affairs without the consent of all the corporate parties involved. Even his own board was in revolt against him, and there was nothing Current could do to rein them in. And with the situation as volatile as it was, there was nothing he could do but sit and wait and pray that he could find a solution before the Realm's nationalist-corporatist experiment went up in flames."

kirin_council.508.d:0 ""Telegram for you, sir."\n\nFickle Current hadn't even finished fetching his office keys from the pocket of his suit before his secretary floated a folded sheet of paper towards his face with her magic. He took it in his own and held it aloft by his shoulder as he unlocked the door, thanking his secretary before stepping inside. It seemed today would be right to business, then.\n\nSetting his briefcase on his desk, Fickle sat down and unfolded the telegram. It was a missive from the Sycee Trading House requesting the NAKP's assistance in pacifying insurgent anti-government forces. Frowning, Current read further. According to Sycee's telegram, local farming communities in the Vespertine Valley had taken up arms and had started attacking the security forces of both Sycee and the Artificers' Guild as they clashed in the area, and had effectively challenged the rule of the VasCorps and the integrity of the Vermilion Empire itself. Such rebellion could not stand, lest it fester into widespread revolt in the Empire; Current knew this, and so too did Silver Silks, who had accompanied the request with a promise of generous reimbursement for the deployment of NAKP security services. Such an offer to have Sycee indebted to the NAKP was almost too tantalizing to pass up.\n\nBut Current was an established businesskirin, and he knew to look between the lines to find what Sycee's chairmare was not saying. He knew that if he deployed the NAKP's security forces at Sycee's request, the Trading House would try to use them to gain an advantage over the Artificers' Guild, directly or indirectly. On top of that, he knew that Sycee was desperate to win over its rival as quickly as it could. If Sycee really wanted NAKP security forces, then maybe playing hardball with them could extract a better deal after a period of silence..."

kirin_council.509.d:0 "Fickle Current had been just about to leave the office for the day when his secretary dangled a piece of paper in front of him as he stepped through the door. "Telegram," she said, offering him a sympathetic smile. "And yes, it's important. It's from the Guild."\n\nCurrent sighed and took the paper. "Thank you, but I'll deal with this one in the car," he told her, and with a wave, the NAKP's chairkirin left 88 Chrysanthemum Plaza behind and climbed into the backseat of his company car. Once the chauffeur set the automobile and drive and pulled onto the road, Current unfolded the paper and read it in private. It was a request from the Artificers' Guild for the deployment and presence of NAKP security forces to the Trypan Interfluve to deal with the 'deteriorating legal situation' centered around the city of Massicot. The Guild stressed that the dispute with Sycee over 'matters of regular business operation' had led to an increase in property damage in and around the city by 'criminal and illegal behavior' and that the kirin present in the city were 'expressing growing concern' over reserves of food, water, and coal. As recompense for the NAKP's 'generous actions in stabilizing the situation', the Guild promised to reimburse it with 'a generosity matched in value and in spirit' once things returned to normal.\n\nCurrent rolled his eyes and set the paper away. Despite the flowery language, he knew that the Guild just wanted to have access to NAKP security forces to aid them in their dispute with Sycee. They could try to cover it up however they wished, but at the end of the day, the artificers merely wanted the NAKP to side with them over their rival. If they bothered to reach out to him, however, then that implied that the Guild was unsure of its ability to bring its dispute with Sycee to a satisfactory conclusion. With that in mind, Current wondered if his silence would lead to the Guild coming back to him with a better offer in the future."

kirin_council.303.d:0 "When the fire dies\nIts ember may yet smolder\nAnd soon burn anew\n\nIt happened all at once, and with such a sudden fury that many wonder if it was Concord's divine retribution for our blasphemy. Throughout the peasant heartland of the Mellifluve Delta, in one great storm of smoke and fire, the peasants and villagers of the Realm all took up arms and marched against our garrisons. Countless mares and stallions of the NAKP were dragged out of their posts and murdered with scythes and pitchforks and swords, their blood watering the fields of Kiria and giving rise to an uprising of fanaticism and religious fervor we haven't seen since we snuffed out Rising Sun's hold over the west.\n\nIt wasn't just the plantations and rural settlements that have fallen, though. In the city of Sorghum, the workers in our factories attacked their foremares and NAKP officials with weapons forged in our machines and turned each one into a fortress. Coupled with an uprising from peasants outside of the city, the rebels were able to seize the city and all its resources and turn it into a bastion of rebellion and insurrection. The Children of Concord, as they call themselves, have spent the past few days purging and slaughtering anykirin they suspect of having ties to the NAKP, but despite this, some stragglers of the garrison have managed to escape and reform into ad hoc units just outside the city's borders. Eager to avenge their comrades, all we have to do is give them the order and they will charge right back into Sorghum and reclaim it for us.\n\nWhich we absolutely should.

kirin_council.304.d:0 ""What is the meaning of this?! Release me this instant!" Frozen Pyre, First Mystic of Sorghum, had been tending to his garden outside of his manse when an angry mob of peasants passed by. One of them had pointed at him and shouted something indiscernible, and before he knew it they had descended upon him en masse. Now, his house was a smouldering ruin, and he was being unceremoniously dragged through the streets of Sorghum.\n\nDespite Frozen's shouting, nokirin in the frenzied crowd seemed to pay him any attention. Soon, they passed by the town's Divine Fire temple; or, what was left of it, in this case. The NAKP-sanctioned temple had been torn asunder, the Imperial flags gone and the holy murals desecrated. There were even kirin dousing the exterior with gasoline. Frozen tried to protest, but his words only sparked more anger from the crowd. The last thing he saw of the temple before the mob dragged him away was the beginnings of an inferno.\n\nFrozen was confused before, but now he was terrified. What was going on? Where was Civil Defense? He tried to look around for something, anything to help him make sense of the situation. Another multitude of kirin joined the mob, these ones parading homemade banners. Frozen squinted his eyes, trying to make out what was on them. He saw simple drawings of Concord's likeness, along with some grainy photographs of somepony he only recognized from the NAKP broadsheet: the Equestrian Diarch, Princess Celestia.\n\nWhat scared him the most, however, was the third figure being depicted next to the others. An equine with a horn and wings, a mane of burning plasma, slitted eyes, a fanged sneer, and molten-gold regalia. These drawings were the most inconsistent and crude, as it seemed like everykirin had a different interpretation of what entity they had tried to depict. But who was it?\n\nHis thoughts were halted when the crowd began to chant a phrase that only served to terrify him further."

Celestia, the diarch of Equestria, receiving praise alongside Concord. A third, sinister-looking figure stood beside them. His thoughts turned to the other Equestrian ruler, Princess Luna. He recalled reading about how she had once transformed into a twisted version of herself called Nightmare Moon. But Celestia didn't have an alter ego! Were the kirin here trying to depict...\n\nFrozen's eyes went wide with realization. "Heretics!" he screamed. This was blasphemy of the highest degree, to both his faith and that of the Equestrians! He struggled against the mob's grip but to no avail. Some briefly paused their chanting to jeer at him. The mob jostled him roughly. The last thing he saw was the butt of a rifle before darkness descended upon him.\n\nThe mob continued to drag Frozen into an iron mill, part of the vast industrial complex owned by the Sorghum Foundry. Now, the workers had taken it over, much like everywhere else in the city. Through his dazed state, Frozen could do little as they ascended to the upper level of the factory. He groaned as the mob hefted him onto the safety railing above a large vat of molten iron. The heat and brightness of the liquid below brought Frozen to his senses. His foalhood fear of falling became reality as the madkirin pushed him off of the railing towards his demise. He desperately reached out to grab onto something, barely managing to wrap his hoof around the post in time.\n\n"CONCORD!" The angry mob continued to shout. One of them placed a hoof next to Frozen's shaking grip. "CELESTIA!" The hoof was pulled back briefly, as if they were preparing for a- "CONFLAGRATION!" Frozen's hoof was kicked away, plunging him down into the vat below.\n\nFrozen felt an immediate, overwhelming warmness around his body as his back struck the molten iron. He screamed as some of it splashed his eyes, blinding him. He flung his limbs in every direction, trying to free himself from the embrace of the agonizing heat. His screams turned into choking as the fiery liquid began to devour him. Soon enough, his movements ceased as the iron finally managed to melt his body."

Bright Burn had been one of his staunchest companions since he left Equestria to help the kirin of the Realm, and without him, Mahogany knew he would have been swallowed up by the culture shock of visiting his ancestral homelands in the midst of the chaos that gripped them. Smiling softly, Mahogany started to answer his question. "Before the revolt, I was part of the resistance in Sorghum against the Empire," Mahogany said. "I met a mare named Dayspring Rose. Did you know she used to be Rising Sun's protege?" When Bright Burn shook his head, he continued. "Well, she was. She and I got to discussing theology. I guess it's not unexpected given her mentor. What was unexpected was just what exactly she thought of theology."\n\nThe intriguing tangent made Bright Burn sit down by Mahogany's side. "Really?"\n\n"Yeah. Concord, Celestia, Conflagration — that's an idea that Dayspring had, and it really stuck with me. The Radiant Trinity. Three faces of our faith, of what makes us kirin." Mahogany shifted to a more comfortable position on his haunches and turned to face Bright. "It's like a metaphor. Something philosophical. You know what dialectic thinking is, right? I learned about it when I was a student at the Friendship University."\n\n"Reconciling two opposing viewpoints as a way to see the world," Bright answered. "Did Twilight Sparkle teach you that?"\n\n"No," Mahogany said, with a little laugh. "Actually, it was Professor Pinkie. But anyway, it got me to think of the Radiant Trinity in a similar way. Call it tri-alectic thinking, if you will.""

kirin_council.388.t:0 "When Three Become One"
kirin_council.388.d:0 ""Well, think about it," Mahogany said. "The Radiant Trinity is a metaphor for the kirin condition. I feel that much is obvious but it's more interesting if you apply it to specifics. Like rulership. Or, at least, pieces of it."\n\nBright Burn nodded along, sitting in rapt attention while Mahogany spoke, his violet eyes wandering around the temple as he worked through his thoughts. "Think about it this way. A ruler could be like Concord: she can be divine, godlike, somehow above the reality of mortal concerns. That's what the Matriarchs Superior have striven to be in Kiria, and though they may be blessed by some divine magic, they're still mortal. They still die. But they still serve their purpose, even if they act like something they're not — and that's a dialectic thought," he said, winking at the aside. "Or, let's take Celestia. A ruler can be benevolent and virtuous like her, but nocreature save for her can ever be that compassionate. Even her sister, another demigod, couldn't! But she's an ideal to strive toward, something that we mortals want to be like. And in a sense, she seems more attainable than Concord, despite how oxymoronic that may seem."\n\nThen after a moment, Mahogany looked back at the shrine to Concord, and then through it to the torches burning on the opposite wall. "And of course, there's Conflagration. Rage and malice incarnate, but given strength through fury. Warlords and tyrants might be a symbol of Conflagration's rage, but they are only one facet of her aspect. Are we not all burdened by our rage? We can all become nirik if we give into it. The mystics in Vermilion saw it as a burden, but it doesn't have to be a curse. Our nirik forms are our most physically strong, and we gain our strength from rage and passion like Conflagration. The trick is to find a way to use that strength for good, and not for our own selfish ends."\n\nHe looked back to Bright Burn and awkwardly chuckled. "Sorry, that was a lecture and a half, wasn't it? I guess even this far from the School of Friendship, I just can't shake my studious ways."\n\n"You don't have to worry about that," Bright said, scooting a little closer to Mahogany. "I thought it was interesting. You really know your stuff.""

kirin_council.305.d:0 "The Sorghum Foundry was a symphony. Everywhere Kindling Flash trotted, different melodies reached his ears from the kirin hard at work forging weapons to fight against the NAKP. On his left, hammers and presses stuttered out the marching staccato of a thousand hooves stomping down the oppressor; on his right, the grinding whine of saws and cutters severed the chains that had once bound them. More than producing instruments of war, these kirin were forging their freedom, and the discordant notes of industrial power weaved themselves together into a concert in Concord's name.\n\nIt was ironic, Kindling noted as he watched the workers at work, that in some part, the Children of Concord had the oppressors to thank for what he was hearing. Before the Silence, the Sorghum Foundry had been the largest factory complex in all of Kiria, but with the beginning of the Grand Gallop Onward, it had been eclipsed by the gigantic industrial parks elsewhere in the Realm. But the investiture of money and machinery had not passed Sorghum by, and the funding procured by the NAKP had helped to modernize the old craftskirin workshops and simple factories into an industrial powerhouse of its own. Of course, it had not all been for the better. Under the Empire, the Foundry had swallowed poor laborers by the thousands, turning their sweat and tears into black smoke and red steel, before disgorging the exhausted workers at the end of the day, minus those whose life and limb the factories claimed for their own. It had been harsh and cruel, but the oppressor did not care how many kirin were maimed or died. There were always more poor workers to shovel into the foundry like the coal that fed its boilers.\n\nThings were different now, Kindling was happy to see as he cantered down the production lines. Now, the workers were free and labored for themselves, not under fear of the foremare's whip. And surrounding them, the cause they championed hung from the girders of the factory, from the red banners and flags to the broken and bloodied body of the foremare hanging from a noose of chains. As the whistle blew signaling the end of the shift and the start of the next, Kindling knew that in this moment of war and blood, their industrial democracy will be delivered into the world."

kirin_council.306.d:0 "Mahogany Blaze and Bright Burn entered the little unnamed town at the head of their profession, ringing bells in their magic. "The Children of Concord have a message for all weary souls longing to be free!" Bright Burn called out as they passed by houses with darkened windows and closed doors. "The breadbasket of Kiria has risen up in arms against the tyranny of Vermilion and the thieves and murderers that rule it! Come with us to witness the rebirth of Kiria and the redemption of the Dynasty!"\n\nThough their bells and chants turned the heads of several kirin in the village, Mahogany couldn't help but notice the empty weariness on their faces. The heartlands of the Realm and the many villages around it, villages much like this one, had suffered immeasurably in the chaos following the collapse of the Grand Gallop Onward. How many processions like his had come through this town to drum up support before him? How many times had these kirin been asked to lend their ears and their strength to a cause only to be left battered, broken, and even worse off than before? Would they even answer the calls of another one?\n\nYet follow the procession they did, and when they finally entered the town square, Mahogany looked at the kirin around him, both in the procession that followed him and in the villagers that answered the ringing of the bells. They straddled every trot of life left in the Realm, from young firebrands to poor peasants to repentant priests to businesskirin seeking to redeem themselves. And when Bright Burn gave Mahogany a nod and encouraged him to step up and give a speech, Mahogany, felt a lump forming in his throat and a stone sinking in his gut."

kirin_council.386.t:0 "Support from the Weary"
kirin_council.386.d:0 ""Turn your ears, kirin of the Realm, and listen, to the wisdom of the heir to the Vermilion Throne!" Bright Burn announced, his voice carrying a strong confidence that Mahogany lacked. The crowd fell quiet, curiosity overtaking them. Mahogany knew that what they saw impressed them more than anything he could possibly say; it was obvious to anykirin who had seen Matriarch Superior Rain Shine or her likeness before that she and Mahogany shared almost identical coloration, save for their eyes. He had been born in Equestria, but to anykirin who didn't know that, it wasn't that too far a logical step to think that Rain Shine was his mother. That fact, and the encouragement of Bright Burn and others in the Children of Concord, had led to Mahogany standing on the well, acting as the face of the revolution. It was too late to turn back now.\n\n"H-Hello, everykirin," Mahogany started, immediately stumbling over that simple greeting as his anxiety threatened to paralyze his voice. "My name is Mahogany Blaze. And, um, I've come to ask for your help. The Children of Concord need everykirin, you see, to, uh, fight back against the NAKP. They've... they've taken so much from us... and I don't want to ask for more but..."\n\nHis eyes wandered, and he shifted uncomfortably, but when he saw Bright Burn and the nod of encouragement coming from his closest companion, Mahogany swallowed hard and tried to raise his voice to drown out his worry. "But we can't do this without you. We have all lost so much in these recent years, I-I know that all too well. But things won't get better unless we do something about it now. Now, more than ever, do we have the chance to fight back. The Empire is still weak and off-balance. This may be our last, final chance to free ourselves and our home. If we wait any longer, then their strength will grow, and we may never be free again.\n\n"But this is my promise to you," Mahogany said, starting to find his voice and his confidence. "I promise that I will fight with you every step of the way. I won't ask you to do something that I wouldn't do myself. Together, we can throw off the shackles of tyranny and bring democracy to Kiria. We can bring the Realm back to what it was always meant to be: a haven for kirin everywhere! And..." he hesitated just a moment, before throwing himself fully into the role. "And I promise I will restore the glory of the Vermilion Dynasty and make this land a Realm worth fighting for!"\n\nThough unsure at first, cheering soon grew at the end of Mahogany's speech, and Bright Burn gave him a look and a wink. "They love you," he told Mahogany, straining to be heard over the noise of a town of weary kirin suddenly given life once more."

He approached the table, and when the two kirin sitting down saw him, Kindling offered them a smile. "Mind if I join you?"\n\nMahogany and his friend gave each other a look, and after a moment, the other kirin scooted out of his seat. "It's getting late; I should be off to bed anyway," he said, and he trotted around the table to press his neck against Mahogany's for a moment. "You two enjoy your talk."\n\n"I'll do my best, Bright," Mahogany said, watching his friend go. Then he motioned for Kindling to sit down across from him. "You're... Kindling Flash, right?" Mahogany asked. "Dayspring mentioned you last time I spoke with her. She said you're a good friend and an ally to the cause."\n\n"Funny, Dayspring also mentioned you when I spoke with her," Kindling said with a chuckle, taking the offered seat. He gave Mahogany another look and let out an impressed whistle. "She wasn't kidding. You're the spitting image of Rain Shine. If I didn't know better, I'd think you were her daughter."\n\nMahogany groaned and put a hoof to his forehead scales. "You and a lot of other kirin. When Bright Burn and Dayspring suggested that I start going around calling myself the heir to the Vermilion Throne, I didn't think anykirin would take it seriously. Little did I know how readily kirin were willing to believe in something like that, or call me "princess" or "heiress" by mistake... I mean, I know I'm not exactly a farmer rippling with muscles, but I don't look THAT soft, do I?"\n\nThe two kirin shared a good-natured laugh, though it faded away when Mahogany frowned. "Honestly, I don't really know how I feel about the whole thing. I'm just a figurehead, a beacon to tie an idea of freedom to, propped up by my friends. I mean, we don't even know what we're doing half the time, but somehow it just works. The kirin of the Realm are willing to believe in me, despite how little sense it all makes. And now I feel like... like I'm in too deep now, you know? My life is no longer my own. I'm a symbol for the Children of Concord. Mahogany Blaze no longer exists, and the Vermilion Pretender is trotting around in his scales.""

kirin_council.387.d:0 ""I'm not sure how much you remember of Rising Sun," Kindling began. "I don't know if you two ever really interacted much. But Dayspring and I were her followers, once upon a time. Two of her most important, if I'm being honest. She had a way of drawing kirin to her, of giving them an idea and making them want to give her everything they had to make it a reality. You can call it charisma, but I call it showmareship. She was very good at presenting to her followers a clear vision of the Kiria she wanted to create, and articulating that idea and how everykirin could help make it a reality. Sure, she knew how to play on a kirin's emotions with fiery speeches and passionate rhetoric, but the commonfolk are smarter than most give them credit for. The people need to know what they are actually fighting for, the world they're trying to realize at the end of all this death and destruction. If they don't have that, then they won't follow you."\n\nMahogany was quiet for a moment, staring into his empty teacup. "Then why does it feel like kirin follow me when I don't have a clear vision for the future I want to make?" he asked Kindling. "I have ideas, but I'm not good at getting them across, yet they flock to me regardless every time I present myself as the Vermilion Pretender. Why?"\n\n"Because you're a symbol to them," Kindling told him. "You're the Vermilion Pretender. You give them the promise that you're going to remake the Realm in the idealized version of what the Vermilion Dynasty is supposed to represent. Peace, prosperity, plenty for all. The commonfolk can interpret and project their own hopes and dreams and desires on you, through you, and that's why they follow you. But eventually, just being a symbol isn't going to be enough. When the questions get tough, the kirin following you will realize that you don't have answers, just a vague hope for the future -- unless you manage to show them what you want for the Realm."\n\n"But how?" Mahogany asked. "I'm not a particularly good orator. I get nervous giving speeches. How can I show kirin what I want for the future if I trip over my words half the time?"\n\nKindling Flash smiled at him and stood up. "I've got some old texts lying around. We can go through books and scrolls from famous speeches from mystics and Matriarchs of the past. If we study them, I think we'll be able to coach you up and help you put your ideas into words, and maybe like Rising Sun, you'll be able to get kirin to follow you through any hardships to come." Then he gave him a sly smirk."

kirin_council.308.d:0 "It had been a long road from the last village, but Dayspring Rose knew that they'd arrive at the next one after one more day's journey. As the Children of Concord that had been traveling with her laid out their campsite for the evening, Dayspring wistfully thought back to the days when she used to travel the Realm by rail with her mentor. Life was easier then, but with Fragrance's soldiers keeping a close eye on the trains, the only way they could safely move about the country was on hoof. Not even the rivers were safe, filled as they were with the corporations' patrol boats. One day, she told herself, it would all be worth it, and she didn't have to travel across the Realm in fear again.\n\nAs the night grew darker and the stars twinkled to life in the heavens above, Dayspring spotted a familiar figure sitting at the edge of the camp, staring up at the celestial expanse above them. Her hooves took her to that kirin's side, and she sat down next to him with a small smile on her face. "What are you thinking about, Princess?"\n\nMahogany Blaze let out a resigned sigh. "Not you too..." he muttered, shaking his head. "Can't we just save that whole thing for the next village? You know very well I'm not related to Rain Shine. I just look like her."\n\n"That's good enough for the kirin we're trying to save," Dayspring said, though after the little teasing lilt, she gave her head a slight respectful dip. "Sorry. I know it's tough on you. I shouldn't tease."\n\n"It's fine," Mahogany assured her. "Whatever works, right?" He chuckled lightly, trying to make light of the strange circumstances both kirin found themselves in, then grew silent again. Only after a thoughtful pause did he speak once more. "I was just wondering..." the young stallion began, "Dayspring... what IS the Radiant Trinity? I've heard you and the others talk so much about it, but I feel like... like it just doesn't make sense."\n\nAt first, Dayspring was taken aback by the directness of the question, wondering for a moment if Mahogany was serious or not. But when she saw the look in his eyes, she knew it was genuine. "As in, who it is? Or do you mean what it represents?" When Mahogany nodded at the latter, Dayspring took a slow breath and shook her head."

kirin_council.398.d:0 ""I suppose it begins with our goddess," Dayspring said, laying down on the grasses and looking up at the stars. After a moment, Mahogany joined her as well, listening intently as she spoke. "Concord created us and our world, and the Matriarchs Superior have always claimed to be her temporal representative, the manifestation of her from the world of the divine into the realm of the material. But if that were wholly true, would they not be perfect beings? There have been nine Matriarchs Superior since the Vermilion Dynasty was created not even six centuries ago, owing to their longer lifespan. Most have been good, fair rulers, though Matriarch Effulgent Rose bent the Realm to satiate her desires for luxury and comfort, and Matriarch Noctilucent Charm stagnated our society for a hundred years when she instituted the Silence. Even Matriarch Superior Rain Shine, beloved as she was and still is, failed to stop the foreigners from wresting control of the Realm away from her with their money and influence. To put it simply, the Matriarchs are not perfect, and many have wanted to claim their power. My old mentor was one of those kirin."\n\nDayspring's face twisted with painful memories, but she forced her emotions back down and continued. "She failed, and when the Rising Fire was crushed, I fled. While on the run, I found a book about the Equestrian princess, Celestia. When I read the text that night... I realized that it might be Celestia who was Concord's representative in this world, not the Matriarchs. Think about it. Concord created the kirin, yes, but she also created everything else that lived in this world. It would be hubris to insist that her avatar must be a kirin. Perhaps it was Celestia, a perfect, compassionate, immortal demigod, the living embodiment of peace and harmony. And when I read about her sister, Princess Luna, and how when she fell to anger and rage she became Nightmare Moon... well, wouldn't Celestia be similar if she fell? But instead of darkness, she'd be a searing flame, a warrior-goddess that manifests to defend her subjects. She'd be like... like a divine conflagration, burning everything that would wrong Concord's creations in this world."\n\nAfter a moment, Dayspring closed her eyes, feeling comfortable on the grass. "That's what the Radiant Trinity is, Mahogany. Concord, Celestia, and Conflagration are all aspects of this world. Its creator, its caretaker, and its protector. In the name of the Radiant Trinity, we can strive for the utopia of peace and harmony that has existed under Celestia for a millennium. And where those that came before us failed, we will succeed."

In Kirin-Trinitarian theology, Celestia exists in a duality: as a physical and temporal embodiment of Harmony - the benevolent and immortal ruler presiding over the world's creatures - and as a warrior-goddess that manifests to defend harmony, when it is threatened, with righteous purifying flame and divine fury, before receding duly once the foe is vanquished. That Celestia's avenging aspect in the form of the Conflagration had never manifested was, according to Kirin-Trinitarians, a testament to her divine purity.\n\nIn the name of Her Radiant Trinity, the ultimate mission of the Kirin-Trinitarians was to remake Kiria into the utopia of peace and harmony that had existed in Equestria under Celestial rule.§!\n— Trinity-Worship in Kiria - a Study in Theology and Metaphysics, Canterford University Press (1077)"

He could feel the golden sun on his back, warming his scales, and the faintest of breezes toyed with the tufts of fluff in his ears. Around him, the sounds of nature gave the world a serene peace, drawing Mahogany into its embrace, enticing him to set his worries aside and appreciate oneness with the world, if only for a little moment.\n\nThen a tickle settled on his nose, and after screwing up his features for several seconds, the young kirin let out such a sudden sneeze that he fell backwards in a flailing tangle of limbs.\n\nBy his side, Kindling Flash slowly opened first one eye, then the other, and his lips curved as he looked down at the flustered young kirin. "I take it your nose was not as at peace as your mind?"\n\nMahogany huffed and sat upright, an embarrassed blush starting to color his cheeks. "I'm just not good at meditating," the stallion grumbled. "Like... I don't know. I feel like I should be good at it, being a kirin and all, but I never did any of this stuff in Equestria. I just can't focus..."\n\n"Having difficulty setting aside your concerns for the Children, are you?" Kindling asked, and when Mahogany reluctantly nodded, Kindling gestured for Mahogany to once more resume his meditative pose and close his eyes. Only when he had done so did Kindling do the same. "Perhaps it will help you to focus not on worrying over the choices ahead, but of the truths as we know them," the older kirin said. "First, the truth to why we fight. We fight because the right to control one's destiny is universal to everycreature, no matter what their trot of life. Everycreature in this Realm has a right to control their own destiny, and we fight to create a democracy to let them do that. But another truth is that our fight is not a mere peasants' revolution. We fight to liberate all of Kiria; the peasants in the fields, yes, but the workers in the factories and the students in the schools, too. Everycreature has a right to democracy, to decide our collective fate and future, and it is in this promise that we find the strength to unite the population in our struggle. It is the truth of our fight and our purpose that will allow us to build a better future, a shared dream. Does that make sense to you?"\n\nMahogany slowly nodded. "Yeah... Yeah I think it does.""

The two kirin found themselves in the open courtyard behind a shrine to Concord in a remote village as part of their travels. Mahogany didn't know what denomination the temple really belonged to anymore; at once, it may have been a Way of Fire temple, then a Rising Fire temple, and now, at least for the time being, a shrine to the Radiant Trinity. The mystics inside had at least been gracious enough to offer the traveling Children food and shelter on their journey, and though Mahogany was thankful for their hospitality, he found himself wondering how sincere the kirin inside were in their adherence to the Radiant Trinity.\n\nBut he put those thoughts aside as Dayspring began to move her limbs and body in measured, flowing movements, and Mahogany did his best to match not only her motions, but her purposeful breathing. The two kirin moved and turned about their spaces, sometimes craning their necks, sometimes arching their backs, and at some points rising on two, and once even one, leg before dropping back to all fours. Though it only lasted a few minutes, Mahogany felt a little livelier by the time they reached the closing posture.\n\nWhen they were finished, the two kirin sat down and Dayspring offered Mahogany a smile. "Not bad," she told him.\n\n"I don't think I could ever be as good as you," Mahogany said. "I feel like I was tripping over my own hooves. And you said you do that daily?"\n\n"I at least try to. It's good physical exercise and it keeps you in shape. When I was fighting for Rising Sun, I would start my day with it. It would give me time to meditate on finding my warrior's spirit before throwing myself into the trials of the Rising Fire's struggle." Though talk of her past seemed to darken her face, Dayspring shook it away with a shake of her head. "Though I may have been misguided back then, the lessons I learned from it are still important. We have to make ourselves worthy of the Radiant Trinity's attention, being willing to fight and die in Her name, for Her divine glory, in the hope that She may recognize our pain and suffering. Through the nobleness of our struggle and our sacrifice, She will bless us with Her benevolent intervention. The movements help us spiritually connect with Her in the hopes of such."\n\nMahogany couldn't help but spare her a skeptical look. "That's unlikely, don't you think? Countless kirin have all claimed that Concord would help them in their time of need if they pleased her, yet here we are."\n\n"Well, you may be right about that," Dayspring said with a shrug.

kirin_council.311.d:0 "Russet Thrush lay on her belly beneath the prickly branches of a bramble, a well-worn but lovingly maintained Flare bolt-action rifle by her side. Hidden on a small hillock beyond a bend in the dirt road, Russet could see a five hundred meter stretch of road in front of her surrounded by undergrowth and shady trees. It would make a perfect place for an ambush, with even twenty kirin being able to massacre a convoy thrice their number with ease. Unfortunately for her, she was the only kirin along that stretch of road that prayed to the Radiant Trinity.\n\nDust rose over a distant hill, kicked up by the wheels of Civil Defence cars and trucks trundling along roads dry from a lengthy drought, and Russet readied her rifle and braced it against the mud and rocks she'd piled up for a solid shooting platform. She took a deep breath to calm her nerves and tried to think back to her younger days, days that felt like a lifetime ago. Once upon a time, she had been a champion in village shooting conditions, discovering her hidden talent when her father brought home a newly-produced Flare rifle and she stole it to shoot at jars like her older brothers did. But nowadays, instead of painted targets on wooden boards, her shots landed on fellow kirin. And though she tried not to let it bother her, she always felt sick to her stomach whenever her bullets revealed red paint after the shot, not before.\n\nThe first car appeared over the hill, and Russet ticked off the meters in her head as the convoy approached. "May the Conflagration protect me and guide my hooves as I do battle in Her name," she whispered to herself, aiming the iron sights of her rifle with the driver of the car leading the column. "May Celestia watch over and bless my family and comrades still fighting, and ensure that they live long, prosperous, peaceful lives. And when I am dead, may Concord receive me into Her love and warmth, in penance for the warmth I take from this world by my hoof."\n\nHer rifle let out a crack of thunder, and a heartbeat later, the windshield of the lead car shattered and it violently swerved off the road. Swallowing hard, Russet worked the action on her rifle, sighted in on the truck behind it, and immediately fired before the driver could react, sending the truck careening down an embankment and into a tree. Soldiers began to pour out of the trucks, quickly trying to locate the shooter, while Russet continued to fire, sending soul after soul back to Concord with each shot of her rifle.\n\nBullets began to fly back in her directions, striking the trees, the rocks, the dirt, but still Russet fired. The leaves of the brambles hissed as bullets ripped through them, and one fell into the open bolt as she cycled rounds as if to stop her from shooting, but she plucked it out and continued firing even as the suppressing fire grew ever closer. There was no chance of escape, Russet knew, and she fired and fired and fired until pain clawed at her throat and she collapsed on her father's rifle, spitting her own red paint onto the powder-stained bolt."

kirin_council.312.d:0 "It was nightfall in the little village, but that didn't stop the liveliness of a bustling day's activity. In fact, it only seemed to heighten it. A bonfire had been erected at the edge of town, and the many kirin of the village had gathered around to share food and drink and hear stories. Mahogany Blaze, who trotted among their number as they sat and chatted, tried to make sense of it all. He had been told it was some folk tradition from a time even older than the Way of Fire itself, but that was all he could really glean from that. At least he had Bright Burn with him to help make sense of it all.\n\nAs they trotted through the crowd, Mahogany suddenly stopped, his eyes falling on a winged figure sitting on the grasses with a score of foals crowded around her. She was a pegasus with ruffled silver feathers, and though her wings in a crowd of kirin had originally attracted Mahogany's attention, her face held it, and not for a pleasant reason. Her nose had clearly been broken some time ago, scars cut into her soft features, and a bandage wrapped around her head covered her left eye. As he looked on in surprise at the injured pony among their number, he pulled Bright Burn aside and pointed at her. "Who is she?"\n\n"Silver Lining, I think," Bright Burn said. "She joined our number only a few days ago. I heard she was part of an Equestrian aid mission, but some Civil Defense guardsmare gave her a brutal beating for trying to protect some foals about to be shot for theft. I thought she'd go back home after that, but..."\n\n"Kiria's a long way from Equestria and the magic of friendship," Mahogany mused, and the two kirin trotted closer to hear what the pegasus was saying. Her forelegs moved in animated motions as she regaled the foals with stories of Equestria and its benevolent goddess, and Mahogany could see the wonder in the foals' eyes as they heard the tales of a peaceful land after having only known war and suffering for so long in Kiria.\n\nWhen she was finished, Mahogany couldn't help but step forward, and when he cleared his throat, the eyes of everykirin present fell on him. "You do our home justice," he said to Silver Lining, and the pegasus bowed her head. "It makes me miss it so. I too long for the days of peace and plenty... but Kiria is not Equestria."\n\nThat statement was met by a dozen or so cocked heads, and so Mahogany continued. "Celestia protects her ponies, but we don't have her to protect us. We have to stand up for ourselves and build our utopia by our own hooves. We have to struggle for everything we want to see in the world. But that doesn't mean that we can't use Equestria as our role model, our inspiration." He smiled, then added:"

kirin_council.313.d:0 "Mahogany Blaze had never been in combat before. By Conflagration, nocreature had ever tried to KILL him before. Though he was supposedly the face of the movement to overthrow the Empire, he had rarely ventured near the front lines, instead using his image to drum up support in the heartlands of the Realm. But that all changed that morning.\n\nAs his caravan of supporters and believers had set out for their next destination that morning, they had suddenly come under fire from Imperial planes that had appeared out of the clouds. In the confusion, Mahogany and Bright Burn had fled for the nearest treeline. Lost and alone under the leaden gaze of the aluminum raptors above them, the two kirin decided to press onwards in the hopes of meeting the survivors of their procession at their destination, all the while using whatever trees and brush they could find as cover. What felt like a lifetime later, Mahogany and Bright emerged from the cover of the trees to find a company of about thirty militiakirin hunkered down behind the stone walls of a bridge. When they saw Mahogany approaching them, their eyes widened in surprise and most jumped to their hooves. "What's happening?" Mahogany asked them, cantering over while keeping a wary eye trained to the skies. "What are you doing out here?"\n\n"Militia," the lead stallion said, giving Mahogany a sloppy salute. "We heard there was Civil Defense in this area so we gathered to help out. We weren't expecting planes, though." He glanced back at the bridge his troops were gathered around. "We have to hold this bridge. They're coming right this way."\n\n"We're going to die here!" a mare exclaimed, and her rifle shook in her magic. "When those planes come back they're gonna kill us!"\n\nIt was obvious to Mahogany the militia was on the verge of fleeing, and he couldn't blame them; his own heart was still racing from the strafing he'd survived earlier. But he also knew that unless they did something, things weren't going to get better. Instead, he seized a nearby rifle in his magic and raised it. "I might not be a soldier, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to fight. This struggle is bigger than us, isn't it? Our oppression and hardship, we can't control that. But we can control how we answer it, and the way I see it, if we don't answer it now, then how are we going to answer it later? We have to stay and fight. A-and I've never shot a gun before, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to try now if it means doing what's right."\n\nThe fire in Mahogany's words, unsure as it was, seemed to rally the militia, and they slowly nodded with him. But before anykirin could say anything, Bright Burn tapped his shoulder. "I'm with you, Mahogany. But that doesn't mean we need to hold the bridge. Let's hide in the trees there and ambush them when they get across, alright?""

This was a natural consequence of his education at the Equestrian School of Friendship, which ingrained into him a deep respect for harmonist-liberal values that so impressed the common kirinfolk he encountered during his travels as a pretender to the Vermilion Throne. During the Battle of Banyan Bridge, however, he would prove himself to possess the qualities of bravery, charisma, and visionary determination that are shared among all successful military leaders. The tenacious resistance by the bridge's defenders, mostly volunteer soldiers from a Sorghum workers' militia, delayed the advance of a Civil Defence reconnaissance force that would ultimately blunt the momentum of the Imperial Kirian Army's "Battle Plan Mystic" offensive.§!\n— Cadmium Heir: Life of the Vermilion Pretender"

Do you not see that you have damned your spark to be extinguished rather than rejoining Concord's heavenly fire?"\n\nSpinel Serpent stood defiant in front of his home, his withering but incendiary gaze sweeping over the crowd of peasants that had gathered in his yard and keeping them at bay through willpower alone. Before the rise of the Empire of Kiria, he had been their Way of Fire priest; now, he was their priest, landlord, and mayor all in one. Everything that happened in his town happened only with his approval, and through cooperation with the Empire, he had gotten everything he had wanted, using the threat of eternal damnation and the snuffing of the immortal spark to keep dissent contained. A peasant may not fear death, but they would fear losing their promise of peace and rebirth through Concord's Holy Flame once their suffering in this life ended.\n\nSingle Spark knew this as she watched the peasants back down around her. Spinel was just one kirin, alone and unarmed, facing down a mob of a hundred and more, armed with stones and farming implements. But still he held power over them in his words and threats. How could a revolution even sprout, let alone blossom and bear fruit, if it was made from kirin of such weak will? How could they hope to break decades of oppression and fear if they didn't have the strength to break its powerless icon before them?\n\nShe whirled on the kirin that had followed her this far but couldn't bring themselves to take a step more. "What are you all waiting for?" she shouted at them, stomping her hoof. "Do you think your freedom will come for you if you wait? Do you think Concord will award complacency with her boon? We must prove to her that we deserve it! Prove to her that we are willing to take our freedom, and we are strong enough to bear it upon our shoulders! If we don't learn how to stand up against one stallion, how will we stand up against the Empire and the scores of oppressors its sick machinery feeds? How will we ever be free?!"\n\nThe crowd frowned, but ultimately it was another mare, barely older than a filly, who set it in motion. Hefting a rock in her magic, she stepped forward and let it fly with a cry of "Death to the oppressors!" The rock caught Spinel by surprise, striking between the scales on his nose, and as he staggered backwards with blood beginning to run down his muzzle, the crowd grew in fury and frenzy. More stones flew, and as the stallion fell to the ground under the onslaught, the rebels rushed forward to finish the job with their makeshift weapons. Single Spark watched it all with a satisfied grin on her face, and as the crowd sent Spinel's spark back to Concord's embrace, she knew they were finally strong enough to take a stand for themselves."

kirin_council_314_tt:0 "§LPerhaps most infamous among the quasi-religious revolutionary tactics employed by the Communion of Trinity is the practice of "Mass Empowerment Through Direct Action", colloquially referred to as "empowerment actions". The exact implementation of such a practice varied from province to province, and was a phenomenon almost exclusively confined to small agrarian villages in the rural countryside that were usually governed by a landlord-official appointed by regional representatives of the Vermilion government. These landlord-officials were often mystics or priests within the Way of Fire or its NAKP-sanctioned successor sect, the Divine Fire Patriotic Movement. Thus, they combined a religious mandate with governmental authority and economic power to dominate the village they ruled over as de-facto personal fiefdoms.\n\nThe Communion's "empowerment actions", then, which entailed preacher-provocateurs infiltrating rural villages, often bringing with them a stash of weapons with which to arm the peasantry, in order to rouse the village through fiery, impassioned rhetoric into lynching their landlord-official, was immensely efficient in spreading revolutionary zeal and anti-Vermilion sentiment among the rural peasantry and, according to Trinity-Worship doctrine, "empowered the masses to throw off their temporal shackles and accept no other authority than that of Her Radiant Trinity".§!\nA New History of Kiria Volume VI, 980-1060 ALB"

The town, which had seemingly known nothing but hardship and destruction through the Silence and then the wars that plagued the Realm following its end, now stood swaddled in the flags and banners of the Children of Concord. Though the threat of military retribution from the Imperial Kirian Army still loomed over Sprout following its liberation, the kirin in the town busily tended to repairing and rebuilding their small settlement, hopefully for the last time.\n\nYet nothing compared to the spirits of the kirin toiling under the sun. For the first time in seemingly a long time, they held their heads high and moved like a people empowered, a people who had seized their destiny and were ready to defend it. Armored kirin patrolled the perimeter of the town, alert for the threat of Imperial retaliation, while in the heart of the town, the collaborators who had kept Sprout's dreams of liberty under their hooves now languished in stocks, jeered and abused as the kirin went into the town hall to formalize their cooperation and alliance with the Children of Concord. It was a sign that the old order was gone, and a new one was ready to take its place.\n\nThe town hall had never been built to hold this many kirin, but today, it was filled to the brim, packed wall to wall with kirin ready to finally see themselves free and prosperous, and hopefully for good. It took some time to get everykirin quiet and ready to begin, but eventually the young mare in charge of the meeting managed to raise her voice above the din. The proposal was a simple but momentous one: the town of Sprout would join the Provisional Commune of Kiria and move from being a town liberated by the revolution to becoming a part of the revolution. It would change the town's history forever, just like the countless towns before it that had joined the fires of revolution. Little more than that needed to be said, and then it was time to vote."

This was not the first time a band of militiakirin had stopped by the nameless community of poor farmers, and she knew it would not be the last. And just like all the others, she knew what they wanted. So, calling out to her two teenage sons to wait in the field until she came back, Pepper trudged over the dry and brittle grass to the commotion where the other farmers in her community had already gathered to confront the militia.\n\nWhen she made her way to the edge of the crowd, she rubbed shoulders with her neighbor and leaned in close to be heard over the raised voices bickering back and forth at the front and center. "Is it the usual?" she asked, and her neighbor nodded. Pepper grimaced, knowing her day was about to get much more unpleasant, and slowly made her way to the front of the crowd where she could better hear the argument.\n\n"We fight to protect you!" the militia captain said, raising her voice as she strained to remain civil. "The least you can do for us is give us some food to keep fighting! How are we supposed to fight if we starve?"\n\n""We have no more food to give you," the village elder, Wheat Chaff, rebuked with a surly growl. "Every band of militia that comes through here wants our grain. Well, we gave at first. We gave and gave, and all you kirin do is take and take. But the drought means we barely have anything left. We have nothing more to give you. Go take your war and your hungry mouths elsewhere."\n\nBoth kirin glared at each other, but after a moment, the militiamare took one look around and saw how badly her band was outnumbered by angry farmers. "Concord will remember this," the mare spat, and she narrowed her eyes at Wheat. "And may Conflagration's flames take your blasted farm with her." Then they stalked off, and only when they were over the hill did Pepper let out a breath she didn't know she had been holding. Thankfully, the crisis had been averted.\n\nAt least, that was what she thought until she returned to her small plot of land only to find her farm's small granary doors wide open... and both her sons missing."

He stood on a white, sandy shoreline with about a score of kirin in vermilion robes before him, watching him patiently. The nearest vegetation was a hundred paces away, and the waves in the swash lapped at his fetlocks and splotches of glass that dotted the sand. It was the perfect place for this kind of training, and though Guarded Flame had trained many kirin before him in this particular skill, it was dangerous, and steps had to be taken to mitigate that danger.\n\nWhen he felt they were ready, he took another breath and stepped forward. "The angry spirit of the nirik lives within each of us," he said, letting his gaze slowly pass over his pupils. "It is a dangerous thing, a creature of fire and destruction. It is our rage, our worst impulses unshackled. When we were created, Concord breathed the last spark of the Primordial Fire into ourselves, and our souls were split into two. The kirin is the creature of peace, of creation, and the nirik is the creature of violence, of destruction. This I learned when I followed the Way of Fire. But it always felt like there was a piece missing. That was when I discovered the truth through the Children of Concord.\n\n"There are three states of the kirin soul, not two," Guarded continued, and though his students tried to remain stoic and attentive, he saw a flicker of confusion pass across their faces. "The first is as we are, and the second is the nirik. But the third is a union between the two. And this is evident in the Trinity. Celestia represents peace and control. Conflagration represents violence and impulse. But the two are in unity with Concord, who balances them in equal measure. So too must we find a balance between our reason and our rage if we wish to control ourselves when in the nirik state, as the Valiants do."\n\nHe closed his eyes and reached into himself, and carefully, bit by bit, he coaxed out the raging flame in his soul. He felt the transformation overtake him, his coat turning black, his mane erupting into fire, his fangs lengthening and pushing aside his lips, but when he opened his eyes, he could still see clearly, even if the red haze pushed against his will and fought to encroach on his vision. "We will practice, one at a time, in finding this balance," he told his pupils, eliciting surprise and shock at hearing a nirik speak plainly and coherently. "It will be difficult. But there is nothing to burn here, and the ocean will soothe your flame should you lose control. Find your balance and unify your three selves. Only then will you become a true Valiant.""

The practices and methods of becoming a Valiant differed by sect and time, but the Trinity-Worshiping kirin of the Children of Concord sought to attain this control through rationalizing the representative balance of their trinity: Celestia the protector, Conflagration the destroyer, and Concord the creator.§!\n— A Journey Along the Paths and Ways of Fire"

Around her, crouching in the stagnant water of the rice paddies, were a score of armed guerillas and a couple of young kirin that served as her runners, all watching with anticipation as the Imperial oppressors blundered into the trap. Once the moment was right, she turned to a colt at her side and nodded to him. "Tell the other positions to be ready. Once the first truck goes up in smoke, we stand our ground and fight until the enemy is destroyed."\n\nThe colt nodded and galloped off, splashing through the water on lanky limbs, but he was hardly gone for a minute before another mare approached Flash. "Your plan is going to get us all killed!" she cried. "That convoy's got more than just supplies on it. It's got an entire detachment of soldiers protecting it, too, and they outnumber and outgun us.

Though when Dayspring's and Mahogany's eyes locked, the topic quickly shifted from a dinner date with friends to the ever-nagging politics that followed Mahogany wherever he went.\n\n"So, I take it you've probably read Kindling's article by now?" Dayspring asked, and when Mahogany nodded, she let out a little sigh and glanced aside at the stallion next to her. "Well, first off, Kindling's right in that we need to have a democratic Commonalty, not just build off the rotten ruins of the Vermilion state. That's what did Rising Sun in; we both saw firsthoof what good trying to play at bringing a new order to Vermilion got her. So I understand why you want to go for a clean break with the past, as you advocated."\n\nKindling Flash raised an eyebrow. "And? The people need to be able to rule themselves through local democratic assemblies and recallable representatives to Vermilion. With the participation of the people, we can make a more fair Realm for all."\n\n"And you're skipping a few steps," Dayspring said. "To make that work we need the willing participation of everykirin, but there are plenty of places like Fragrance, Rhapsody, and Vermilion itself where we'll be lucky to get even a minority of the population to play along. So we can't jump straight into Commonalty. We need to build to it first." Her eyes slid over to Mahogany. "Mahogany, you've proved yourself to the Realm. Everykirin who marches with us supports you with all their being. You pretended to be Rain Shine's heir in the beginning to gain support, but you've earned the right to claim that title. And if we're going to bring about this Commonalty that Kindling knows is our goal, then I think you're going to have to do it for real. The Realm needs a fair and just king, a paragon of a Patriarch, who stands not to the side like Rain Shine did as the Realm festered around her, but an active ruler who acts in Her Radiance's will to defend the weak from evil."\n\nMahogany fidgeted, feeling floored by the sudden ask of him, and Dayspring apologetically held out a hoof.

"A bright new future is in our grasp!" Dayspring proclaimed, to much cheering. "Through Concord's will, we have freed the Realm from those who would oppress us. It is time to begin a new chapter for the Realm with a new ruler. No longer shall we have a distant Matriarch Superior who rules with ambivalence if not distant disdain; we must have a ruler who leads by example, who embodies the will of the Radiant Trinity, who has secured the faith of the Kirian people. We need somekirin who will unite the Realm, who is a fair choice for the people of Vermilion and Greater Providence, who chafe under our military occupation. We need their cooperation to ensure our Commonalty will survive. We must have Mahogany Blaze as our king!"\n\nThe proclamation created an uproar that seemed to shake the assembly hall with the stomping of hooves, though Mahogany could not tell if it accompanied more cheers or jeers. "This century for the Realm has been little more than the deposing and replacement of tyrants!" a voice called out from the crowd to loud agreement. "Would we add to the cycle with a new one? I would like to believe that the seat of power would not corrupt Mahogany, that he would be just and fair, but this was a struggle waged for freedom, equality and democracy. And you would subvert that with a first among equals? The people fought and struggled for this. Let the people of the Realm decide our future. Give us the Commonalty that we fought for; don't replace the Matriarchy with a Patriarch!"\n\nShouting broke out, but it was ultimately Bright Burn who managed to quell it. "If the people should decide our future, then why not let them decide if they want Mahogany as well?" he called out, silencing the commotion down to low rumblings. "The people should vote on it, as they would with anything else in the Commonalty. Let them decide if they want Mahogany or not. Let this be the first vote of our new Realm!" As murmurs of agreement rose throughout the Assembly, Bright turned aside and looked at Mahogany, who seemed to be staring into the floorboards in thought. "Mahogany... Have you made up your mind? What do you think?""

kirin_council.324.d:0 "It was the day before the vote that would decide the future of the Realm, and Mahogany had gotten little sleep in the days leading up to it. He was tired and wanted to curl up and sleep forever, but even when he closed his eyes, anxiety would only allow him a fitful, restless sleep. Even having Bright Burn's warm body by his side did little to calm him.\n\nBut he had made up his mind about this long ago; it had just taken until now to find the words to say what he had to say. When he had expressed his intent to Bright Burn, the stallion had assured him that no matter what, he would be by his side and support him. Even though Mahogany knew that he would, that little reassurance over what he knew to be the truth was enough to call the assembly.\n\nThat morning, as silence fell over the assemblage of workers and peasants who had come out of their homes, fields, and factories to see him on the outskirts of Vermilion, Mahogany swallowed hard and raised his voice into the microphone standing before him. "People of Kiria, faithful under the Radiant Trinity, I thank you for being here today," he began, his voice wavering under his racing heart. But a tender look from Bright Burn at his side steeled his resolve, and he continued. "Tomorrow, the Realm will vote on whether it wants me to serve as its king or not. I will begin by saying that whatever the kirin of the Realm decide, I will honor. But I am speaking to you today, on the morning before the vote, to tell you that the crown is not something I seek. I do not want it."\n\nHe swallowed again as surprised and shocked whispers broke out in the crowd. "While I traveled the Realm finding support for the Revolution, I saw all I needed to see to know that the Realm will be in good hooves in the hooves of the people, not through some monarchical figurehead. Kiria does not need a king as much as it no longer has a need for the Matriarch Superior. And while I am flattered at the support I've seen for the idea of my kingship, I do not feel it would be in my place to rule Kiria as one. You all... you are all ready to take the first step by yourselves. It is time to finally partake of the fruit that you sowed with your own blood and tears.\n\n"If you still want to proclaim me your king, then I will take up the mantle," he concluded. "But you are ready. Vote 'No' tomorrow and make your dreams a reality. Only then, I think, will you finally know what you all are truly capable of. Thank you."\n\nBowing his head, Mahogany turned around and casually trotted away from the microphone and the podium before anykirin could ask him a question. And only when he was out of sight behind the curtains did he let out a deep, deep sigh—and a surprised snort when Bright Burn kissed him."

But even though it was a vote, it seemed like everykirin in the Realm already knew the answer. The buzz was unstoppable, and the idea of the beloved Vermilion Pretender, Mahogany Blaze, taking his seat in Vermilion was all but accepted even before the polls opened.\n\nMahogany knew this too; though the throne was something he did not necessarily want, he knew it was what the kirin of the Realm wanted, and he was duty-bound to answer their call. So that evening, as the polls began to close, an assemblage of workers and peasants had gathered outside of Vermilion to hear him speak. Behind the curtain, Mahogany pressed his forehead scales against Bright Burn's for a moment, their horns briefly locking, before he stepped into the light to give them what they wanted.\n\n"Kirin of the Realm," Mahogany began, his voice wavering as he felt hundreds of eyes alight upon him. "I've seen the exit polling as I'm sure many of you have. Even if you haven't, word of mouth is a powerful thing. When the votes are counted tonight, I know that I will be your king. Though it is not something that I desired, I will assume the title on your behalf. I want to help you all, and if this is how you want me to do it, then I will.\n\n"But I will not be a ruler, not in the way the Matriarchs of the past have been," he continued, finding some steel in his voice when he saw Bright Burn smiling sweetly at him from the side of the stage. "I will know none of the material comforts of the Matriarchs, including the Vermilion Palace. I will continue to travel the Realm, to meet the people, to hear their grievances from their lips and not through notes and advisors. I will make it my duty to unite the many foals of the Realm, east and west, north and south, so that we are all once again one Kiria - a Realm healed and whole! And when my work is done, I will give up the crown and return the reins of authority to the people. Kiria will be yours to rule, as it always should be and shall be. I only hope to steer the ship out of choppy waters before the tiller is yours."\n\nAs cheers and applause rang out, Mahogany raised his voice to finish. "All faithful before Her Radiance, know that we are all equal before Concord. Just because I am your king does not make your better. Be my shepherds; see to it that I do not stray from Her Radiance's righteous path, and when the time comes, I shall rejoin the Commonalty as another simple soul.

kirin_council.350.d:0 "Underneath the concern and worry and anger that gripped Chairkirin Fickle Current and the rest of the upper echelons of the NAKP after the news broke, there was also another feeling: frustration. Frustration that unrest was allowed to foment for so long in the west. Frustration that attempts to stifle it had done nothing at best, and only further stoked it at worst. Frustration at the incompetence of the lower levels as they both struggled to understand and approach the threat, and their efforts made to conceal their failures from the brass rather than address them. At the very least, Current would make sure that those who had failed the NAKP would be part of the first counterterrorism operations to try and contain this 'Children of Concord' threat.\n\nAll those frustrations took their turn being vented in the war room between Current, Ardent Bloom, and other members of the Executive Council, but they were all resolved in one thing: if the NAKP's intelligence operations had failed to disperse the revolt before it grabbed ahold of the west, then they would crush it through any and all means possible. Hooves on the ground coupled with massed artillery bombardment, indiscriminate airstrikes against suspected rebel gathering posts, and armored columns that would crush any opposition into the dirt beneath their treads would accomplish what subterfuge had not. If the Realm's western provinces had to burn and choke on ash and smoke until the Children were punished, then so be it.\n\nOnly when the meeting was over did Ardent Bloom pull Current aside. "I have a message on behalf of the VasCorps," he said. "In recognition of the Empire's time of crisis, they have offered us three fully-equipped military formations to be put at the disposal of Civil Defence in suppressing the revolt. Their equipment rivals our best; it would be a shame to let such an opportunity go to waste."\n\n"The corporations do nothing for free, and we cannot be seen to have accepted them as gifts. It would be seen as a weakness, and nothing on the market is free," Current observed. "What do they want in exchange?"\n\n"It is not a gift, Chairkirin," Ardent assured him. "They presented us with the standard rates for their aid, though realizing this is a time of great crisis, we negotiated a discount to acquire their services for a single gold coin. Of course, realizing that the services the corporations render us far exceed the value of a coin, it would be wise to look into... other means of rewarding their generosity when all is said and done.""

Gentle Hoof to Civil Defense re: Dissuasion Tactics on the Rural Populace:\n\nPacification efforts in the Mellifluve basin continue to show promising signs of success. Recent efforts to dissuade villages along the river from joining the rebellion have noted a marked decrease in suspected rebel sympathizer activity. Responses have been varied but all trend in a positive direction: some villages are abandoned before Civil Defense arrives to implement dissuasion tactics, while others openly welcome our forces and hoof over both detained rebels and sympathizers for liquidation in a good faith gesture towards our protection. Recommend expanding activities further away from the riverbanks and show that Civil Defense can operate further inland, not just along the Great Mellifluve and its tributaries.\n\nAttached is a list of expended supplies that will need to be restocked before dissuasion operations can be continued; please deliver supplies to the usual depot:\n\n- 140,000 rounds machine gun ammunition\n- 30,000 rounds rifle ammunition\n- 250 incendiary explosives\n- 3 additional prison barges\n- 2 weeks rations for 5,000 soldiers (the rebels have scorched the fields so foraging has been less effective)\n\nAdditionally, see attached list of future villages that need dissuasion. Once resupplied with ammunition and explosives, will set out to engage in further operations. Hopefully shouldn't need to keep the pressure up too much longer; this month only 8,138 potential sympathizers and rebels were liquidated, down from last month's figure of 14,537.

kirin_council.352.d:0 "It seemed like the ashes of the revolt had barely settled before the Executive Council had gathered, along with the leaders of the Empire's many loyal VasCorps, in Fragrance to discuss the aftermath. Fickle Current watched the kirin around him discuss the impact of the revolt on the Empire, from suspected casualty figures to the much more important cost to the VasCorps' bottom line and damage to the Empire's economy. It would take a long time for the Empire and the corporations to rebuild their wealth following the destruction of so many profitable factories and fields due to the petulance of disgruntled peasants, and that left many of the VasCorps' leaders less than pleased. Current knew that they would expect financial aid and support from the government after they had so charitably negotiated a discounted contract for the use of their corporations' private security forces, but the drain on the Empire's already thin coffers were something that it could ill-afford.\n\nThankfully, Cypress Snow had drafted a plan before this meeting, and Current had already given him his approval to propose it to the VasCorps as a potential remedy to all their problems. "Now that the revolt is finished, it is time for the post-mortem question of: why?" Cypress began. "Why was such a fierce revolt able to gain such a firm grip on an already war-weary populace? Let us put aside the failures of the local authorities and security forces who let it fester, as the seeds of revolt should never have been sewn in the first place. Let us instead go straight to the root of the problem: the poor, primitive, and recalcitrant peasantry are fundamentally unaccepting of our beliefs in the liberating power of the markets and our devotion to the Divine Fire. Give them too much freedom, too much time to think, and they will inevitably be drawn towards wrong answers and false promises. The natural drift of the poor kirin's state of mind is toward revolt, and as such, they must be watched closely to ensure that they do not fall victim to this backwards way of thinking.\n\n"To that end, I propose that we work to redefine the relationship between the peasantry and the state," Cypress continued, while the leaders of the VasCorps listened with growing curiosity. "We shall make the peasantry wards of the state, wards of Matriarch Superior Rain Shine. She shall see to them as their mother, providing for their needs in the form of food and shelter. In exchange, they will owe her their utmost loyalty, and it will be up to all of us as the trusted instruments of the Matriarch's will to ensure that they are worked hard, watched close, and firmly disciplined. To that end, the Executive Council will work on distributing the peasantry to each of the VasCorps as their humble wards, and giving you full authority to work them as you see fit to ensure that this does not happen again. And Sorghum Foundries, as the party that suffered the most during the revolt, will be given the lion's share of wards to help rebuild their home city. I hope that sounds agreeable to everykirin?""

In exchange, the Vassal Corporations, with the aid of the NAKP, have promised to protect the citizens of Kiria, and have taken the first step in addressing inequality by abolishing wages and other 'rights' that only promote resentment and instead negotiate contracts and services with the towns under their jurisdictions.

Which, I believe, is an election year."\n\nCherry knew that the representative was trying to threaten her with the prospect of the NAKP shifting financial support toward competitors, but she wasn't going to let those tactics get under her coat. "There won't be an election next year if Fragrance falls!" she shouted back. "And instead of doing everything they can to shore up the city's defenses, the corporations are already cutting losses and running! What do you think it looks like to the people of Fragrance when Sycee hauls all their gold out of the NAKP's coffers and tries to ship it off somewhere else?" She snorted and flicked her tail in anger. "The kirin of Fragrance are more patriotic than Griffonian transplants like Sycee, it would seem. They used the money that Sycee would flee back to Griffonia with to at least defend our city."\n\nThe representative gritted her teeth and tried to plead with Cherry one more time. "Fragrance will never be under direct threat. The setbacks on the frontlines are temporary and reversible. Think long-term here.

Moments to relax in the chaotic dance of ruling the NAKP and championing its efforts in the Realm left little time to have to himself, but thankfully tonight was one of those rare moments where his secretary had cleaned his schedule without telling him beforehoof. Without those little impromptu breaks and free evenings, Current knew he would work himself ragged, but thankfully somekirin else was out there to look after him.\n\nAs he sat down at his desk to read through the stack of foreign newspapers he'd had delivered to his penthouse suite in 88 Chrysanthemum Plaza, however, there was a sudden knock at his door. Current paused, glancing in its direction, trying to remember if he was expecting anycreature that evening, before the door suddenly burst inwards and a kirin galloped into the room, crowbar held aloft in his magical grip. The chairkirin jumped out of his seat in surprise and tried to back away, but the crazed kirin dropped the crowbar on the floor and seized the collar of Current's suit, dragging him over until they were practically nose to nose. In that moment, all Current could think about was shock at how his personal security had let an assassin burst into his penthouse.\n\n"Chairkirin!" the intruder shouted, his magic shaking Current in his grip.

"All of our gold, a stupendous amount of wealth, gone! Vanished! I-I don't see how that's possible! Somekirin would have to have seen it disappear!"\n\n"There were no alarms tripped?"

kirin_republic.1.t:0 "A New Fire Rises" ##unused, replaced with WS
kirin_republic.1.d:0 "Rising Sun softly smiled with pleasure as she looked out over the crowd that had gathered to hear her speak. Hundreds of kirin stood on the shores of the Great Mellifluve, where only an hour earlier, they had used pitchforks, scythes, sledgehammers, and whatever other tools they could get their hooves on to rout the garrison of Vermilion loyalists who had tried to reassert order over Chrysanthemum. The garrison had been armed with rifles, but they were only forty against four hundred. It hadn't been much of a fight at all, but now that blood had been spilled, Rising Sun knew there was no turning back.\n\n"My faithful foals!" Rising shouted, her voice carrying out over the crowd, sweet and enticing. "The Silence is over, and today, we have brought about its destined conclusion. The corrupt mystics of The Way of Fire who ruled over us from Vermilion have been cast aside from our lands, and today, The Rising Fire steps forward to do our duty to Concord. Where the hedonists in Vermilion have twisted and perverted Concord's divine will to suit their own interests, we kirin of the west stand true and stand firm to her ideals. For too long, the hedonists have oppressed the kirin of the Realm by claiming to speak with the voice of Concord, and forcing us to act as they behave through their lies. But why do they not want the common kirin to commune with Concord directly? Why do they insist that they are the only ones who can interpret her will, and then in turn tell us what her will is?\n\n"The answer is simple," she declared, her eyes coming alive like a growing flame. "Because they do not wish for us to know Concord's will. In their corruption, they have forced their will upon us, and called it Concord's. They have even ensnared our beloved Matriarch Superior in their lies. But we shall fall for them no more! The Rising Fire has always encouraged every kirin to seek to understand Concord's will on their own, and that understanding has brought us to where we are today. We all know what Concord wishes of us: she wishes us to stand strong, to stand together, and to support every kirin with equality, justice, and peace. The west has figured this out, but the rest of the Realm remains oblivious. And so they shall until we can bring The Rising Fire to the gates of Vermilion and set our Matriarch free from the clutches of those who have entangled her in lies!" She raised her hoof into the air. "Today marks the beginning of Kiria's salvation! The Rising Fire shall save Kiria from corruption and oppression! And we shall march to Vermilion and rescue the Matriarch, or we shall all die trying!""

kirin_republic.2.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Radios all across Kiria lit up today with the voice of Rising Sun, the leader of the Rising Fire movement in the seceded western region of Kiria. Vowing to reveal the truth of Matriarch Rain Shine's corrupt and villainous advisors, Rising Sun broke the news to all of Kiria that it was Vermilion's own agents, the Banner of the Covered Cage, that was responsible for the complete annihilation of the prospering town of Sunrise several decades ago. Whether Matriarch Rain Shine did not have the chance to break this news to her subjects herself or was complicit in its secrecy, none can say for certain. Rising Sun turned the news of the massacre into a rallying cry for kirin all across the Realm to join the Rising Fire in saving Kiria by freeing Rain Shine from the corrupt advisors in the capital. Her words have already begun to stir up support from commonkirin throughout the fractured realm, threatening the stability of her competitors."

kirin_republic.3.d:0 ""Citizens of Kiria, my name is Rising Sun. I am speaking to you from a radio station in Chrysanthemum, and I have an important message for you. Already there are countless lies in circulation about who I am and what the Rising Fire stands for, all spread by kirin who are not only my enemies, but the enemies of a free Kiria, and the enemies of Concord Herself. The Rising Fire teaches us that Concord is different things to different kirin, and so I shall channel this teaching into my address for the many ears I am reaching throughout the Realm.\n\n"For the devout followers of the Rising Fire, wherever you may be, and for the citizens of the Fraternal Republic of Kiria, know this: a new day has dawned, and the sunrise is beautiful and brilliant. We shall all march forward together to bring about the blessed glory of this brand new day, and our teachings and way of life shall free and liberate all of our brothers and sisters still languishing under oppression. Our just cause cannot be stopped.\n\n"For those longing to be liberated from corruption, from hedonism, from injustice, know this: The Rising Fire marches to throw off your shackles, and to welcome you into our cause. You will know only peace, and duty, and our indomitable faith in our most holy Concord. No longer will you be forced to bow before a corrupt clergy, forced to pay tithes you cannot afford just to provide them lavish riches and wasteful excesses. What you earn by your blood, sweat, and tears will be yours to keep, and together, we shall cast down the parasites that drink your blood and force you into ruin. Our righteous cause cannot be stopped.\n\nFor our most holy Matriarch Superior Rain Shine, who languishes in her gilded cage in Vermilion, know this: our armies march to your summons, and the hour of your freedom will soon be upon you. You are the most divine creature in this mortal realm, and your union with Concord's divinity entitles you to the right to rule over the kirin people. But you are beset upon all sides by those that would use you and deceive you, kirin that claim to be your friends but use your name for their own selfish ends. Though your words may be controlled by the priests who claim to speak for you, rebuke them at every opportunity you can! Speak in the defense of the Rising Fire! The people of Kiria must know the truth! Our holy cause cannot be stopped!\n\n"And for those of you who would stand against the Rising Fire, know this: your fates have been sealed, and your end is coming soon. Repent and join the Rising Fire, or burn in your sin. Our mighty cause cannot be stopped!""

kirin_republic.4.t:0 "Divine Defense and Overwhelming Offense"
kirin_republic.4.d:0 "Rising Sun had gathered her closest confidants about her in the central chamber of Chrysanthemum's largest temple. She had made the space her center of command for the time being, and she felt some sense of irony about it. Here, in these perfumed chambers, she had once studied the Way of Fire as a young acolyte, and had spent countless hours debating the mystics on theology. Now, so many years later, she had returned as the senior-most priestess of the Rising Fire, and this grand temple would be the first coal that would set Kiria ablaze with righteous passion.\n\nGathered about her were several kirin she trusted the most. On her left was Dayspring Rose, the acolyte she had taken under her wing, and on her right was Kindling Flash, one of the most influential grassroots preachers in the west, and the stallion from whom Rising Sun had first learned of the Rising Fire while in Verdant. Sitting opposite them were the soldiers Tinder Blaze and Fern Thorn, two of the precious few kirin loyal to the Rising Fire with any kind of military experience whatsoever. Rising Sun and her companions listened in dutiful silence as Tinder Blaze explained their situation. "The simple fact of the matter is devotion and fervor will only get us so far. You can get a hundred peasants to charge in the name of Concord, but they will all be killed by a hundred shots from a hundred riflekirin at a hundred yards. Our troops, if you could call them that, are equipped with antique swords, farm equipment, and primitive firearms. Once Vermilion recovers from the shock of our violent secession, we will be crushed in short order."\n\n"Concord would not allow her true faithful to be so short an order," retorted a priestess of minor reknown, whose name eluded Rising Sun. "She will protect us on the field of battle and bring a swift end to our enemies."\n\n"Concord is not here to solve our problems for us; like a good mother, She provides us with the means to attain our success, and it is up to us to accomplish it." Dayspring Rose's rebuke was wise beyond her years, and Rising Sun nodded in approval of apt quoting of Concord's teachings. Her protege then turned to the soldiers. "If this is what Concord has provided us, then it is up to us to find success with it. How can we do that, Bannerkirin?"\n\n"We will have to fight unconventionally," Fern Thorn concluded. "We will never win a pitched battle, but if we carefully maneuver and deploy our forces, we can bait Vermilion into traps and ambushes. If we encircle our enemy a few banners at a time, no amount of firepower or discipline will save them from destruction when peasants ready to die in Concord's name charge them from all sides. We will trade land for lives where necessary, and if we are careful enough, we can make sure that the lives lost are the heretics', not ours.""
kirin_republic.4.a:0 "This is Concord's will, and thus it shall be done."

kirin_republic.5.t:0 "A Call to Arms"
kirin_republic.5.d:0 "Thousands of kirin had gathered in the fields outside of Chrysanthemum's ancient walls, packed shoulder to shoulder as they tried to get a look at the orange-robed mare standing on the bed of a wagon in their midst. They were kirin from every trot of life, from faithful and devoted acolytes of the Rising Fire to the peasants and volunteers who had answered the call to fight for their freedom from the oppressors in Vermilion. But they were all united in one belief, the belief that if they did not fight, then they would languish in slavery, and the mare standing before them was the only one who could save them.\n\nRising Sun looked out at the kirin assembled all around her, and as she began to speak, she slowly turned in a circle, making sure all of the kirin present had an opportunity to see her face, meet her eyes, and know that the words she spoke were the complete and utter truth of the world. "We are all, each of us, a soldier who fights in Concord's name," she proclaimed. "Though we may not all fight on the field of battle, we each find a way to contribute to our divine and righteous war against the heretics and nonbelievers who rule over our country. With our words, with our weapons, with our sacrifices, we shall march through our beautiful Realm, overcoming the ineffectual challenges of those who would stand against Concord's divine will. Like a fire sweeping over the dry grasses of a plain scorched under the stifling summer sun, so too shall our cause sweep over Kiria, growing stronger the longer we march. In every town, in every village, we shall find more kirin to join our cause, and our strength will grow while those who stand against us grow weak and weary. We shall overwhelm our enemies with our indomitable will, and the Rising Fire will be the flame that cleanses and scours the land! We shall march onto Vermilion, and when we do, the heretics of old, the Way of Fire, shall be no more. No more shall they oppress us! No more shall they bleed us for everything we possess to satiate their selfish greed! We shall take Kiria back from the hooves who have poisoned it so, and in so doing, we shall once again restore the Realm to Concord's divine rule! Fight on, keep the faith, and we shall have victory everlasting!"\n\nHer words were met with thunderous cries and the stamping of hooves. Some kirin were even weeping in their passion, and a euphoric frenzy rolled through the crowd. Soon, a chant had been taken up, echoing over and over again, screamed into the heavens by a thousand voices:"
kirin_republic.5.a:0 ""For Concord and Kiria! For Concord and Kiria!""

kirin_republic.6.t:0 "Rising Sun's Doctrine of Momentum"
kirin_republic.6.d:0 "Artillery rumbled in the background, many miles away, providing its own thunder to rival that of the storm bearing down on General Ember Glow's camp. The winds and rain tore at the canvas flaps of her tent, and water seeping in under the bottom was slowly turning her personal quarters into a quagmire of mud. A map was laid out on the wooden table in front of her, along with a battery-powered radio in the corner. Through it came Rising Sun's voice, making yet another patriotic proclamation to the kirin of the Fraternal Republic, her bravado and passion a serviceable distraction from the unpleasant weather. "Kirin of the Republic!" Rising Sun proclaimed through the static. "As we grow in strength, our enemies, the decadent Vermilion Realm, rotting and rotten to the core, shall grow ever weaker. The balance of power rests on a single point, and as one of us rises, the other shall fall. For every mile we take, every heretic we end, every foal of Concord we liberate, our cause grows stronger, and Vermilion's pathetic resolve grows weaker. We shall march onto the Matriarch's holy city ever faster, ever stronger, and Vermilion's vise grip on our beautiful Realm shall crumble by the hour. For there is no force as great as that of our Mother, our beautiful Concord, and the divine will through which she empowers us. Her favor will turn the tide of the war and spread the Rising Fire throughout the Realm!\n\n"Times may seem dire now," Rising Sun continued, her voice dropping from impassioned to reassuring, "but it will not always be so. All we must do is survive the initial onslaught from the heretics, and we shall emerge stronger than ever before. Turn away their clumsy strike and deliver a deadly riposte, fighting with every ounce of your being to overwhelm and destroy our enemy. We will hold the line, we will counterattack, and we will soon go on the offensive. Remember, everything you do, you do for Kiria and Concord! Fight until your dying breath, and then fight some more! Concord's Holy Fires shall be our divine fury!"\n\nEmber Glow could only look up from her map and shake her head as Rising Sun's voice was replaced with thunderous applause. In place of tactics and doctrine, the First Priestess relied on passion and divine favor to secure victory for the Republic. But with inexperienced soldiers, little supplies, and no other option, the General could only hope that Rising Sun's impassioned pleas would somehow turn the tide."
kirin_republic.6.a:0 "The only thing we have on our side is Concord. It will have to be enough."

kirin_republic.7.t:0 "The Voice of Concord"
kirin_republic.7.d:0 ""For what do we, the pious, the true believers, have to fear in death? There is nothing to fear behind the veil of death. There will not be darkness or despair; rather, each and every one of us, when we die, will be welcomed into Concord's loving embrace, and the spark that lives within us will rejoin the great Primordial Fire that She so carefully tends to."\n\nKindling Flash looked out over the kirin gathered around him as he let his words sink in. They had come from nothing, the downtrodden peasants as poor as the land they worked through the Silence, but now the Rising Fire had risen them to greatness. They were the instruments of Concord's will, and he was Her herald. "But just because we should not fear death does not mean we should hasten to embrace it," Kindling Flash continued. "Each of us may be a spark of Her will, but without fuel, even the greatest fires will wither and die. It is up to us to provide fuel for Her fire, to toil in Her service, to bring about the manifestation of Her most divine will before our own sparks fade away. In the battles to come, many of us will fade away as we give the ultimate sacrifice for Concord, but our work will fuel the fire that will set the Realm ablaze in heavenly light. And against the tumultuous winds of our enemies, the heretics and hypocrites that would see our work undone, the foreigners and conquerors that would enslave us, we shall stand firm. We shall never retreat, and we shall never surrender! We fight with Concord's blessing, and her blessing will give us victory! Let all who take up the torch of her blessed will be hailed as heroes, and let all who cower from their destiny be thrown into darkness!"\n\nAt that moment, the artillery placed on the hills around them began to fire with a frenzy, and Kindling Flash grabbed a rifle in his magic and lifted it into the air. "We fight for Concord! We fight for Kiria! We fight for the Rising Fire! And today, we will be victorious! Now, my brothers and sisters of the faith...""

kirin_republic.8.d:0 ""The Rising Fire fights for the Matriarch! The Rising Fire fights for Kiria! The Rising Fire needs you, sons and daughters of Kiria, to fight in its name!"\n\nThe kirin was dressed in the simple red robes of the Rising Fire, and in his magic he held dozens of bells fashioned to a wooden rod that he shook to summon a clatter of jangling wherever he went. This was his fourth trip up and down the main street of the tiny village of Chenar, and he had already amassed a small collection of kirin to parade around with him. Many carried the few worldly possessions they needed with them in burlap bags, while some followed with nothing at all. But what they lacked in material wealth, they shared in spiritual and patriotic fervor. All were willing to fight in the name of the Rising Fire, and all would give everything they had to see it triumph over the Fraternal Republic's enemies.\n\nAt the end of town, two kirin, one old, one young, hugged a young mare standing in the front lawn of a hovel, her bags packed with clothes, food, and an antique sword. "Do not go, Cerise," the old kirin said, a stallion who had seen numerous winters pass before eyes now heavy with tears. "The farm needs you. Your parents in the fields need you. You know nothing of war. What will you do with that sabre when the soldiers of Vermilion fight with rifles? You will be killed for nothing!"\n\n"If I die, I will have died for something, grandfather" the young mare said, her voice confident and adamant. "It is my duty, my patriotic duty to Kiria and to Concord Herself, to save the Matriarch and the Realm. Do you not hear the mystic's words? Everykirin must do their part. I have been practicing my swordwork, I am strong and fit, and I will do my part to save the Realm. If you cannot give me your blessing to fight for Kiria, then at least give me your prayers to keep me safe."\n\nAt this, she gave her grandfather one last hug, and then slipped out of his embrace to join the procession in the streets. Her grandfather broke down into sobs as she turned tail on him and left, and Cerise did her best to block out his cries with her house disappearing behind her. It was only when she had made it to the town square that she felt her younger brother cling onto her hind leg. "I'm coming with you!" the colt announced. "Together, we'll fight for glory and make mom and dad proud. We'll save Kiria together, and we'll save them!"\n\nCerise grinned as she turned aside to hug her brother. "Yes we will, Cinnabar," she said, pressing her horn against his. "We'll be the heroes Kiria needs. Together.""

kirin_republic.9.t:0 "Concord Giveth..."
kirin_republic.9.d:0 ""The blessings of Concord be upon you and your family," the mystic said, vermilion powder coating her cleft hoof as she rubbed it on the nose scales of the farmer standing before her. "For all that you give, Concord will return to you a hundredfold, when the flames of the Rising Fire burn brightest at the break of day."\n\nBehind the mystic, a pair of soldiers dressed in the crimson uniforms of the Rising Fire's militia loaded up a beat-up wooden wagon with sheafs of wheat, barrels of carrots, and crates of onions and cabbages. The plants on the fields around them were bare, freshly harvested, and more farmers worked between the rows of crops to package the produce in crates for transportation. The farmer before the mystic, with the vermilion dye freshly rubbed onto her scales, bowed her head in deference, but she watched her family at work in the fields with a hint of worry. "I remain one of Concord's faithful," she said, and she slowly raised her head. "But what of my family? We are willing to give all that we can for the soldiers on the front, but how can we survive the winter if Concord asks for all of our harvest?"\n\nThe mystic only smiled sweetly back at her. "Concord provides for all the faithful in their time of need, just as you have provided for the Rising Fire in the moment of its greatest challenges. Through her benevolent wisdom, she will ensure that you will be cared for through the winter, and your family fed." She turned to the soldiers, who nodded back at her and began to haul the cart away. Moments later, the mystic gave the farmer one last nod and departed along with them.\n\nThe farmer could only stand in place and watch them go, and she worriedly bit her lip as she watched her harvest disappear down the road. "But how?" she wondered aloud, the question remaining unanswered in the empty fields."

kirin_republic.10.d:0 "Rising Sun stood before the two kirin brought before her, one mare and one stallion, as they bowed their heads in greeting to the chief priestess of the Rising Fire. They were the commanders of her two newest banners, the Banner of the Scouring Flame, and the Banner of the Cleansing Fire, together in union forming the Sanctified Banners, and they each had a job to do. "The Sanctified Banners are the newest forces committed to the fight to uphold Concord's benevolent authority, but you shall not see action on the battlefield," she told them. "Yours is a war that shall be fought and won far from the front lines. Yours is a war of the soul, a war to protect the spark of the Primordial Flame that burns within each and every one of us. Your actions will be just as important to our victory as the actions of the soldiers fighting in the mud and blood at the front."\n\nShe turned to the stallion on the left. "Golden Lumen, you are my commander for the Banner of the Scouring Flame. To you, I entrust the important task of following the soldiers on the front lines and making sure that our territory is pacified and compliant to the Rising Fire. You will go to [Root.Capital.GetName] and conduct anti-partisan operations there, where Vermilion loyalists are spreading lies among our people like a disease. You will strike hard, and strike fast. You will smoke them out like rats, and like rats, they will be dealt with like the vermin they are. Make sure that your solution sends a clear message to those that would oppose the Rising Fire."\n\nThen she turned to the mare on her right. "Linseed Gilding, you are my commander for the Banner of the Cleansing Fire. To you, I entrust the important task of maintaining the spiritual purity and devotion of the Republic. You will travel to the village of Sunflower in the Jade Expanse and cleanse the heretical and corrupting influences that infest that city. There, they believe that there should be no priests or mystics, that everykirin is able to commune freely with Concord. But while nokirin should ever truly be separated from Concord, how can they hope to understand their communion without the mystics who have studied to guide them? They will fall astray and be misled, and their heresy will destroy the Republic from within. Their misguided beliefs must not be allowed to spread. I want a stop put to those heretical practices, permanently."\n\nBoth kirin bowed before Rising Sun in acknowledgement, and she dismissed them with a wave of her hoof. "Go, then. See to it that your missions are a success. I eagerly await news of your accomplishments.""

But you know the terrain better than the dogs of Vermilion, and their numbers will not save them when the fire of Concord's fury crashes down upon them. Be with your families and get some rest. We march at first light tomorrow."\n\nThe bannerkirin commander watched the kirin of the village disperse back to their homes, many sharing excited yet nervous whispers about the glory to come tomorrow. Yet there would be little glory for them to share in tomorrow; they would likely be killed almost to the last, and those that did survive the assault would have no fond memories of the horrors they were about to witness. It bothered the commander, and she turned away to return to her tent.\n\nHalfway there, her subordinate caught up to her. "Is something wrong, ma'am?" the younger kirin asked. "If you're worried about the battle tomorrow, I have the utmost confidence in the conscripts. They're ready to fight and die for the Republic and for Concord."\n\n"I have no doubt in the inevitability of our success," the commander responded, slowing a half-step for her subordinate to fall in beside her. "But it will not come without great cost to the kirin of this village. This isn't the first time I've had to recruit the local population into an impromptu vanguard. They aren't here to fight; they're here to die, to buy time for the banner to make up ground and start our assault. They die so the soldiers like us don't have to."\n\n"Doubts may plague us, commander, but we must remember that we all fight and we all sacrifice for the good of the Realm," the other kirin assured her. "Every kirin that is willing to make the ultimate sacrifice brings us one step closer to victory. We can never lose faith in the righteousness of our cause, that we do what we must to create a better Realm. The means may saddle us with guilt, but surely that guilt is better than living with the knowledge that we did not do everything we could to bring about a more perfect Realm?" She nodded to herself and added, "That guilt would be the most bitter of all to me, ma'am."\n\nThe bannerkirin commander slowly shook her head. "You may be right. It is better to sacrifice and win than to be timid and lose. But that does not mean it gets easier to send kirin into the jaws of certain death." She sighed and offered the lieutenant a salute. "Get some rest. We need to be in position to do our part when they do theirs tomorrow. Otherwise, it's all for naught.""

kirin_republic.12.d:0 ""Come on, Daddy! The Republic needs our help!" A kirin filly banged a tin cup against a large metal wok she held in her flickering magic, skipping in circles around a stallion hefting a wheelbarrow in his magic. Inside the wooden wheelbarrow were all sorts of metalware, from pots and pans to old farming equipment like trowels, scythes, and spades. The two kirin joined a small procession of villagers, all carrying their own metalware, to a great stone furnace in the center of town.\n\n"There are things we can live without, Comet," the father said to his daughter. "But I still do not think giving up our wok to the Republic is a good idea. How will Mommy cook your favorite meals?"\n\n"With fire!" Comet exclaimed, as if it was the most obvious answer in the world. "We're kirin, that means we can be fire and stuff! That's what the mare in the red robes in town said! That's why we gotta do our part!"\n\nThe father frowned at the congregation of kirin in the center of town, surrounding the furnace. One by one, each kirin deposited their metalware into the heart of the furnace, where a great crucible heated by nirik melted it down into crude pig iron. The mare in the red robes, a priestess of the Rising Fire, preached with fiery passion about the sacrifices everykirin must make to the Realm and to Concord, and her words whipped the crowd into such a frenzy that kirin would let their passions get the better of them and slip into the nirik state, only to hop into the furnace with the other nirik and add their heat to the fire. It was almost blasphemous—wasn't the point of the kirin religion to prevent the temptations of the nirik state? But Kiria had changed so much in such a short time that he did not know for certain anymore.\n\nIt wasn't long before father and daughter made their way to the front of the line, and Comet giggled gleefully as she hurled the family wok into the furnace. "We're doing our part!" she proudly proclaimed, though her father only managed a smile for her sake. His thoughts were on more pressing concerns, such has how to prepare dinner when they returned from town. But the look on Comet's face convinced him he was doing the right thing. He had to be; but he could only hope for his daughter's sake that she was right."

It is the heart of the Fraternal Revolution, and it shall withstand any attack or siege by our cowardly enemies! So long as one pious and patriotic citizen of this city lives it will not fall!"\n\nBannerkirin Chaplain-Commander Hot Air proudly puffed out her chest at those words, her gaze wandering over her awed crowd—of foals. Fifteen or twenty foals, chaperoned by one sleeping grandparent in a rocking chair in the back, had gathered around Hot Air's small stage, wide eyes fixated on the bannerkirin, or perhaps the couple of kirin hanging from the gallows behind her, each with a placard hanging around their name stating their crimes. Though the crimes written down on each placard, such as the hoarding of food or shirking conscription, probably meant nothing to the illiterate foals in front of her, Hot Air couldn't afford to be picky with her grand speech. After all, with most of the town's adult populace either already fighting on the front or busy building defenses around the neighborhood, she was just happy to have any kind of audience whatsoever. "You are the strength of the Rising Fire, the backbone that will allow it to weather any heretical assault by our enemies!" she proudly proclaimed. "If this city falls, it will not be the end of the fight. You will go to ground and fight anywhere, any way, at any time you can, until the conquerors have no choice but to flee before their occupation becomes their doom! You will inform your fellow citizens of their patriotic duty to fight until the bitter end comes, no matter how it may, and that to submit to the enemy is a cowardly affront to Concord herself! And lest you think our only foes be those from beyond our borders, think again! The enemy could be among us, and we must be ever vigilant for traitors in our ranks!"\n\nAt this point, one of the foals bravely ventured to raise his hoof in the air.

kirin_republic.14.d:0 "The rafts glided silently along the waters of the Great Mellifluve, the kirin huddled on them quieter than the dead as they guided them into the reed-lined shore of the river's eastern bank. The mud and plants softened the impact of their landing, and like wraiths, three dozen kirin swarmed off the rafts and stole up on the village overlooking the water without a sound. Steel glinted under the starlight, with some blades catching a yellow edge from the candles burning in the windows of nearby homes.\n\nA pair of soldiers on sentry duty chatted under the flickering electric light of the town administrator's office, rifles slung around their shoulders. It had been another quiet night for them, save for the occasional distant rumble of artillery far to the north. But that changed in an instant when a ferocious rebel yell sounded from all around the village. They both jumped and raised their weapons, but were cut down in a hail of bullets as kirin clad in black and crimson burst into the light, smashing through windows or kicking down doors in an intense coordinated assault. Screaming and shouting broke out throughout the village as the town's garrison tried to respond, but it was a hopeless endeavor. Within half an hour, the entire garrison had been killed or driven from the streets, and teams of kirin proudly wearing the colors of the Rising Fire began to move from building to building, chasing out anykirin inside and setting fire to the contents.\n\nSoon, all the marauders gathered in front of the town library and forced open the doors. As soon as they entered, they immediately began to raid the shelves, pocketing any and all literary material they could get their hooves on, and dumping scrolls into sacks by the score. But they all paused when one of their members called out in surprise, and moments later hauled over a kirin stallion with thick rimmed glasses perched on his scaly nose, depositing him on the floor in front of a circle of raiders. The leader of their gang, a slender kirin with white coat and red scales, used her magic to get a look at the stallion's face and raised an eyebrow. "Sage Snoot, is it? We heard you might be around here."\n\n"P-Please, d-don't hurt m-me," Sage stammered, trying to shield his face with his forelegs. "This is a B-Bookstorm, right? The locals m-mentioned it. B-But I thought you were only after b-books!"\n\n"Knowledge is what we're after," the mare corrected him, and she turned to her second-in-command. "He's a learned kirin, a scientist of some renown around these parts. Take him with us; the Rising Fire will benefit greatly from his service.""

kirin_republic.15.d:0 "Little Lotus shivered in the rain. She huddled in the mud at the bottom of a ditch alongside a muddy road, the angry black clouds of the storm blotting out almost any light from the sky. Her stomach ached from hunger, and her knee was swollen and turning an angry red. The laceration running its length had started weeping yellow with pus, and it hurt to move. But the throbbing ache was the only thing that reminded her she was alive.\n\nShe hadn't been prepared for war. She and her sister, Orchid, had been conscripted with half the adults from her little village, given a sword, a week's rations, and a canteen of water, and sent to the front lines to fight for the Republic. Their first contact with the enemy from Vermilion had been a disaster. Vanguards had shattered her ad hoc regiment with fire and fury in minutes, and the survivors had scattered to the winds, fleeing for their lives. Lotus didn't know where her sister was; she didn't know if Orchid was alive or dead. Lotus had fled into the woods when the kirin next to her lost his horn to a bullet, and afterwards, she had been too terrified to go back and look for Orchid. Instead, she only fled deeper into the woods, though her flight turned into a limp when she slipped on a mossy rock, fell, and sliced her hind knee open on a spur of shale jutting out from the ground. From there, she had limped for three days until she found Banner-Sergeant Last Stand, who had taken her into his unit of survivors. But instead of retreating west, he had advanced to the east, and promised to personally shoot anykirin that shirked their duty to Concord and the Rising Fire. They were to fight behind enemy lines, attacking anything they could to disrupt the supplies of the Vermilion loyalists. Even from the front lines, they could still see the Rising Fire to glory.\n\nA bird's call sounded out from the nearby trees, though Lotus knew it wasn't a bird, but a warning. Grimacing as she forced herself to peek over the edge of the ditch, Lotus saw a column of two dozen kirin escorting a couple of wagons laden with supplies moving toward her. Swallowing hard, she retreated back into the ditch and pulled her sword out of the cloth protecting it. The supply train was wandering right into Last Stand's ambush, and as soon as she heard the signal, she was to leap out of the ditches and undergrowth with the rest of the survivors and attack it. The ambush party had just as many kirin as the escort, but Lotus shivered when she saw that the escort had modern rifles with shiny bayonets fixed on the end. They were well-fed, well-equipped, and well-trained; Lotus was starving, sick, and scared. But when she heard the signal and the cry went up from the sides of the road, she forced herself to stand and hobble toward the wagon, only to lock eyes with a soldier who pointed his rifle at her and fired."

"It's the same story all across the country. I wouldn't expect it to be any different here in the army camp."\n\nThe other kirin in the camp, Kindling Flash, flashed her an apologetic smile and sat down across from her, a cup of tea in his own magic as well. "Well, while the Rising Fire may have cut out all the wasteful excesses of the mystics of the Way of Fire, the temples in Chrysanthemum are still better supplied than an army camp near the front lines. How goes the work there, old friend? I've been so busy keeping morale up at the front that I haven't had the time to check in on the progress you've made in creating our new government."\n\n"Our people are receptive to our work," Dayspring assured him. "They're a pious and plain folk that have been abandoned by Vermilion for so long. But their loyalty is beautiful and humbling. We have so little to give them, yet we ask so much of them. Their willingness to give, and give without complaint, assures me that what we're doing is right. Just."\n\n"The kirin of the west are hardy creatures," Kindling agreed with her. "They are content with life's simple pleasures, not the lavish frivolities of Vermilion. Yet even still, I sometimes cannot help but feel like we betray their trust. We requisition their supplies and conscript them en masse into our armies, all to emerge victorious in a struggle to topple an apathetic regime that has plagued them for so long. We offer them little choice in the matter, only the promise of a better tomorrow."\n\n"Have faith in Rising Sun's plan," Dayspring Rose said. "My mentor has thought this all out at length. She understands the necessity of the measures we take. And the people do too. We show them care, which is far more than Vermilion ever showed them, and tell them that they rule themselves now. They are liberated under the Rising Fire in a way they never knew they could be liberated before. They are wholly devoted to our cause because we earned their trust, and they know as well as you and I that one day all their struggles will be worth it." She picked up her teacup and took another sip, and when she lowered it, her words were animated with passion and belief. "Tough times require tough choices, Kindling.

All around him, a crowd of peasants and soldiers had gathered, certainly more kirin than there were houses in the town. They watched him speak with wide eyes and rapt attention, and the more his words found their ears, the wider slight smiles became.\n\n"We love Concord, and we love Kiria," Kindling Flash proclaimed. "Through our piety and our patriotism, we will achieve peace and prosperity. Our Fraternal Republic is not a perfect nation by any means, of course not. What nation is perfect on its first try? But the important thing to remember is that we are working through our flaws, together, side by side, to overcome them. The shortages, the rationing, the fighting, the hardship, all of that are the trials by which we shall temper our movement into a perfect utopia. After all, Concord does not grant Her blessings to those who are unworthy of them. We must prove to Her that we are worthy, that Her faith in our race as the custodians of the Last Spark was not misplaced."\n\n"And what will Her blessings look like?" Kindling continued, posing the question to his audience. "I know what they will be, for I have seen them in the flames and in my meditations, and I have watched Concord spell them for us in the fireworks in the night sky. The Fraternal Republic's future is to become a temporal dominion-to-be of Concord, where all shall want for nothing. There will be enough food for every family to feast upon every night. There will be enough shelter for everykirin to sleep with a roof over their heads. There will be enough honest work for every kirin to be fulfilled, enough clothing for everykirin to protect themselves from the elements. We will all have autonomy, liberty, equality, and fraternity under our great democracy, and nokirin shall be exploited or oppressed by those who would seek to profit off of their suffering. A perfect utopia, shaped in Concord's love, modeled after Her benevolent wisdom!"\n\nA cheer went up from the crowd, and a broad smile formed on Kindling's muzzle. "We are all children of Concord, and thus we are all brothers and sisters. We are a family, and so we must all love each other as a family!"\n\nAs the crowd cheered Kindling's last proclamation, a figure watched from the shadow of a nearby building, lips pursed.

kirin_republic.180.d:0 "Honey Dew galloped through the undergrowth, pushing aside branches and stumbling over roots as she fled from the battle raging behind her. Her standard of militia had been ordered to defend one of the few stone bridges over the Great Mellifluve. Beyond the left bank lay Verdant, the metropolis at the mouth of the Mellifluve. Along with Sorghum, Verdant was one of the first major cities directly in the path of the Rising Fire's offensive eastwards.\n\nHer unit of bannerkirin militia were to delay the first heretical thrusts across the Mellifluve until the bridge could be properly demolished with explosives. So they took up positions on the right bank along the road leading to the bridge, ready to ambush the Rising Fire when they came. What they hadn't expected, though, was for the enemy to attack from the wrong side of the river. The Rising Fire had stormed across the bridge from the direction of Verdant, overrunning their camp in minutes and sending the militia into disarray.\n\nNow Honey Dew was galloping as fast as she could. She had to get back to Verdant! Her unit had had no radio, and the army assembling at Verdant had to be warned that the Rising Fire had broken through their lines and were galloping amok in their rear area.\n\nThe sound of thundering water steadily grew as she approached the riverbank. Bursting through the last tangle of bush, she nearly fell into the water. Before her stretched the mouth of the Great Mellifluve, the widest point in the river's many hundreds of miles. With some hesitation, Honey Dew set down her rifle against a tree trunk. It was a Spark Pattern lever-action rifle that her standard had been newly issued with, and abandoning it here seemed like a waste of a perfectly serviceable rifle. But it would only weigh her down as she swam across the roaring rapids to the far shore.\n\nThere was nothing left to do but to take the plunge. The war had just begun, and although the Matriarch's loyal troops had been dealt a defeat today, Honey Dew knew that she'd be able to get assigned to a new unit and be sent back to the front once she reached friendly lines. She only hoped that the heretics hadn't yet reached the gates of Verdant by the time she got there. Concord willing, the day would soon come when she'd ford the Mellifluve in the other direction — once the tide of the war turned, and the Matriarch's banners began their westwards march of reconquest."

kirin_republic.19.d:0 "Rising Sun gently set the latest reports from her banners on the frontlines into a wooden box and closed it. Then, with slow and purposeful movements, she rose from her study within Chrysanthemum's temple and moved toward the balcony overlooking the city below her. It was nighttime, or just about to be, as the last of the orange glow from the sun faded from the evening sky. Below her, the windows of the buildings came to life with candlelight, and shadows moved within them as kirin retired for the night. They were safe from the fighting and could go to sleep without worrying about Vermilion's dogs pounding down their doors in the middle of the night... for now.\n\nRising Sun allowed herself a small frown as she turned the words in those reports over in her mind. The situation at the front was a desperate one—though it was not like she had ever expected it to be anything else. The war against Vermilion was winnable, but it would not be won without colossal sacrifice on the part of every kirin in the west. Alongside the sacrifices of food and material, there were also sacrifices of the mind and heart to make as well. As much as she championed the moral justice and piety of the Rising Fire, Rising Sun knew that honor would only doom her movement to utter failure. There was no room for piety and ideology in the dirty business it would take to crush Vermilion under her hoof; instead, every kirin must be willing to harden themselves to do what they had to do to win. Ruthless cunning would be Vermilion's undoing, and as Rising Sun watched the shadows shift about in the buildings surrounding the temple, she realized that there was a tool as of yet almost entirely untapped by her movement.\n\nShe looked to the east, where the armies of Vermilion were approaching. The front line was too long and her people too few to stop Vermilion's advance, but the Rising Fire was a movement of the people. She began to formulate a plan, a gamble, that would see the Fraternal Republic triumph over her enemies. Every indefensible position would have to be abandoned, the soldiers pulled back and concentrated for decisive strikes where they would be needed, while the kirin who remained would fight behind enemy lines. Everykirin in every town would be expected to attack Vermilion's garrisons wherever and whenever they could, disrupt the supply lines of the Republic's enemies, and wage a perpetual guerilla war to grind Vermilion's soldiers and resolve into dust. Rising Sun knew the reprisals would be harsh and brutal, and the partisans left behind to fight in the name of the Rising Fire would be exterminated to the last. Thousands upon thousands of kirin would die, but it was a sacrifice she needed to make if she was to have any hope of winning the war for her people. Their sacrifices would buy her forces time, and once Vermilion was too weak to fight any longer, she would spring her trap and unleash the full fury of the Rising Fire upon the crumbling resolve of her enemies.\n\nIt would be an inglorious war, but one Rising Sun knew she would win."

"There you are!" she said when she made it to his side, her saddlebags stuffed with all the worldly possessions she could fit in them. "I was wondering where you were. I thought maybe you stayed back to help the soldiers burn the town down."\n\n"No," Black Briar said, but he could only frown at the flames. "What are we gonna do now, though?

Curious, the two colts hurried to the front of the procession, wondering what all the noise was about, when they spotted a kirin dressed in mudstained red robes standing on top of the roof of the village's well. Surrounding them, disgruntled villagers glared up at the kirin Anise recognized as one of the Rising Fire's bannerkirin mystic-commanders, who beseeched them in a pleading tone.\n\n"The Rising Fire needs anykirin, anykirin willing to continue the fight, to join with us," the bannerkirin pleaded to the assembled villagers. "The survivors of our banner will be falling back into the forest to continue the fight behind enemy lines, but there are so few of us who aren't wounded and able to fight. If we are to succeed, we need fresh kirins willing to fight in the name of Concord!"\n\nBut unlike the words of the mystics and recruiters that had come through Anise's village last month, where they had found an enthusiastic audience, the bannerkirin's words were met with anger and hostility. "You took all of our able-bodied mares and stallions last month!" somekirin from the crowd shouted up at him. "Mothers and grandmothers sent their foals and grandfoals to fight with you. Now you want more?" "What happened to our volunteers?" somekirin else asked. "Where are they now?" A third voice challenged the bannerkirin with words that were almost treasonous. "Vermilion had us pay our tithe in gold and crops, not our foals! At least they had the decency to leave our families alone!"\n\nThe bannerkirin on the well could only wince at the angry accusations and questions. "Nokirin should have to send away their children or siblings to war," he said, doing his best to mollify the hostile crowd. "But these are dark times. The armies of Vermilion bear down upon us at this very moment, and we need everykirin who can fight to fight for the Rising Fire! There will be nothing left if you don't!"\n\n"There will be nothing left if we do fight," somekirin in the crowd retorted, and their words were picked up in an angry grumble. "Die in the woods, bannerkirin. You won't have any more of our families!" At that, the crowd began to disperse, deaf to the bannerkirin's pleas to not turn their backs on the Rising Fire.\n\nBut Anise remained, seemingly rooted to the spot. He remembered how his older sister had left to fight when the banners came last month. Maybe she was still out there somewhere? He would never know if he stayed in the village, but if he followed the soldier...\n\nHe turned to Sesame and gave his little brother a hug. "I'm gonna find Coriander," he told his brother.

Outside, gunfire and screaming created a terrible sound of death, and the rumbling of distant artillery coupled with the thundering of nearby explosions added a terrible bass boom to the noise. It had been that artillery that had ripped her home apart and had killed her husband, and that artillery had shattered a pot and lodged a piece of clay shrapnel as large as her hoof deep inside her gut. Given enough time, it would be the death of her, too.\n\nShe coughed weakly and grimaced with her bloodstained teeth as another stab of pain throbbed in her abdomen. Her thoughts went out to her children, all four of them, and she wondered if they were safe or if Vermilion's artillery had killed them too. She had sent them running with her sister at the last moment, right before the attack began, knowing all too well she'd never see them again. But when the Rising Fire soldiers had taken up positions in her village, she had dared to hope that maybe there was a chance. But that hope had quickly proven misplaced. The soldiers the Rising Fire had sent were green recruits who had never tasted battle, and their desultory defence had lasted only ten minutes before they broke ranks and fled. In the end, the Rising Fire had done nothing to save her village, only leaving it and the kirin trapped inside of it as nothing more than a speedbump, a pile of bodies to slow down the relentless tide of Vermilion's advance.\n\nLentil could hear the soldiers approaching outside now. She knew from the stories that they were cruel and heartless monsters, and were likely to kill anykirin they could get their hooves on in retaliation for the relentless guerilla attacks the Rising Fire subjected them to. They would storm into her home and kill her as well. Metal rattled over her head, and she limply looked upwards to see her mother's sword hanging above the ruins of her mantle. Her mother had been a bannerkirin in her youth, a fine one as she claimed, and Lentil had always known her mother to have a warrior's spirit in her heart. Would she have died in a corner, feeling sorry for herself? No. She would have fought, howling her rage at the world that had taken everything from her. To Tartarus with the Serene Tendency, and damn the Rising Fire too. Their war had trampled her life underhoof and left only pain.\n\nShe forced herself to stand and pried the sword off the wall with her magic. Then, dragging the tip along the ground, she hobbled to the ruins of her door, blood dripping on the ground.

Crippled river boats were floated listlessly between the city's many islands, their hulks burnt out and ruined, while kirin on small canoes and rafts paddled around them. In the city's massive floating market of the Coruscating Lagoon, the noise and busy traffic of hundreds of kirin buying and selling goods on the waters of the Great Mellifluve had been replaced by a press of little wooden dinghies all jammed together, all to hear the voice of the kirin standing at the base of the statue of an ancient kirin Matriarch rising from the murky waters.\n\nKindling Flash looked out over the joyous kirin floating before him, many hugging across boats and dancing on rafts so joyously that it was a wonder they didn't capsize. Verdant was his home, and this was the happiest he had ever seen it. After a days-long battle, the kirin of the Rising Fire had broken the yoke of the Vermilion's oppression, and the city where the Rising Fire had been born had finally returned to the revolution.\n\nHe turned those thoughts into his words, and he used his words to rally the crowd. "It has been a long struggle, my brothers and sisters of the faith, but after long last, the Rising Fire has finally returned to Verdant in force! It was here that the true revelations of Concord's divine will were revealed to us, the faithful, and it was here that the Rising Fire was born! It was here that a movement that will purify Kiria in the pyres of piety saw its first spark, and it is here that the growing wildfire of righteousness now rages! Verdant survived the Silence because of our faith and our communal love for one another and Concord's will, and now, it is our responsibility to share our love with the rest of Kiria!"\n\nThe crowd cheered, and Kindling Flash beamed; if nothing else, he knew he could die happy knowing he had freed his home from the kirin who had oppressed it for so long. "When the revolution began, Verdant's best and brightest had left for Chrysanthemum to continue their work.

She and the dozen soldiers under her command had been selected to silence those guns, capture them if she could, and remove the pressure on the battalions holding their ground against the latest offensive.\n\nThe morning skies were gray and rainy, helping to muffle the noise of her small band of soldiers as they crept their way up the rice terraces, inching their way closer to the guns. With any luck, they could reach them without being spotted and tear into the gun crews in a frenzied attack before they knew what was happening. But luck was not on their side, as a patrolling sentry happened to glance down the hillside just as Saber's force made for the next terrace and the cover it provided, and raised the alarm.\n\nWith the element of surprise lost, Saber had but two choices to choose from: retreat and save her team, or press on with the attack. But if she retreated now, the results could be disastrous for the rest of the army. That left only one choice, and with a piercing shout, the bannerkirin leapt up to the next terrace and led the charge. Her squad followed her without question, adding their yells to the charge, and terrace by terrace, the team advanced in the face of strengthening gunfire and heavy resistance.\n\nIt was a murderous climb. Every time they rushed for a terrace, somekirin died. What had started as a group of thirteen had dwindled to five by the time they made it to the top.

May Concord, in her divine wisdom, have mercy on her soul."\n\n"How the mighty have fallen," Rising Sun quietly mused to herself. Long had she known about the pirates of Nacre sailing under Roaring Fire's banner. For years they had menaced the riverine trade that sailed out of Verdant, or what little remained of it throughout the Silence, abducting and slaughtering helpless foals of Concord for their own pleasure and gain. She wanted nothing more than to smite the pirate before her, to strike her head from her shoulders with a sword and toss her body in the river, but cold logic stopped her. While executing Roaring Fire would be helpful to add to her image as a protector of kirin everywhere, the pirate queen was a skilled warrior and could be a useful tool.\n\nA plan formed in her head, and she stepped forward, signaling to the soldier to yank Roaring Fire's mane back to force the pirate to look her in the eyes. "Roaring Fire, menace of the seas, terror on water. I should have you killed for your many crimes, but Concord is merciful. She will not discard what can still be of use to Her glory, and so it is with you. Thus, I offer you a choice; prostrate yourself before me as Her messenger and fight in the name of the Rising Fire, or prepare your spark to be returned to the Primordial Fire in Her care."\n\nRoaring Fire glared up at Rising Sun, fixing her with a dreadfully baleful look, and for a moment, Rising Sun wondered whether the pirate queen would be defiant to the last. But reason won out in the end, and the pirate slowly bowed before Rising Sun. Nodding in approval, Rising Sun turned to the soldier. "Bring her to her cell to rest and eat up. She will need to be strong to serve our Goddess."\n\nAs the two kirin left, Rising Sun turned aside to where Dayspring Rose stood behind her. "You will accompany the pirate," she told her faithful acolyte. "You are the brightest and best of our young leadership, but you lack experience in the field. This will be a valuable lesson.

She gave the sword a little twist with her magic and jammed it into the straw up to the hilt, where she released it to admire her work.\n\n"You fight like a one-eyed, three-legged zebra," Roaring Fire derided her from the side of the room, earning scornful looks from the other kirin valiants in the room. "I would have driven one of my cutlasses under your horn during that flourish. Don't take your eyes off your enemy unless you're eager to meet Concord."\n\nDayspring huffed in annoyance, but before she could say anything, the doors to the barracks opened and a unicorn wandered in, dressed in a prim purple collared shirt trimmed with silver. "You would not believe how hard it is to find this place, what with the, shall we call them, current events going on in this far corner of the world," he said as he confidently strode inside. As the valiants in the barracks slowly formed up and drew closer together, the stallion stopped in their midst and introduced himself with a flamboyant bow. "The Brilliant and Esteemed Archmage Pyrite, from the very far off and distant nation of Wittenland, master of the magical arts both elemental and arcane, and a curious observer to the religion of your fire goddess. A pleasure to be at your service."\n\nThe kirin in the room all gave him looks, but Dayspring Rose did her best to give him a warm greeting. "Archmage Pyrite, it is very wonderful to have you here. You were sent on the behalf of Rising Sun, yes?"\n\n"She's the one with the temper as hot as her looks, right? Yes, her," Pyrite said. "She told me she was in need of somepony trained in higher magic to apply a geas, so here I am. So, who's the lucky kirin in need of magical compulsion?"\n\nAll eyes turned toward Roaring Fire, who stared back defiantly. "Her," Dayspring Rose said, and she marched closer to the pirate. "Touch your horn to mine and say the words," she said as Pyrite drew closer, his horn beginning to glow.\n\nRoaring Fire gave her a sharp look, but after a moment, did as instructed. Their horns lit up, conjoined in the glow of Pyrite's magic, as she slowly read aloud the words to the geas. "I will protect you with my life and follow your every command. I will abide by the spirit of such commands and not try to find loopholes. I will have your best interests at heart at all times, until I am released from your service." She frowned up at the length of her horn as Pyrite released the glow with a flash of light and a pop. "Happy?""

kirin_republic.27.t:0 "Keep the Flame Alive"
kirin_republic.27.d:0 "Rising Sun inwardly seethed as she watched the temple fill with weary kirin, their faces exhausted, downtrodden, afraid. In them, she saw the flickering, fading dream of her Republic, the guttering embers of the Rising Fire. Her enemies were strong, too strong, and her followers were weak, too pathetically weak. They were failing her. They were failing the Rising Fire. But Rising Sun would not let their weakness be the end of her dream.\n\nAs she stepped forward to address the congregation, the murmuring in the room drew quieter, and Sun let her eyes wander over her followers' faces before she proclaimed with a simple, strong statement: "We will not win the war with Vermilion." The uproar was as she expected; cries of fury, of despair, of panic filled the temple, but the officers sitting at the fringes of the congregation remained stoic, impassive. Rising Sun knew that they understood the situation better than anykirin else present, and the doors to the temple momentarily opened and closed as a dissenter, mane and horn alight with pink sparks, was hurriedly bundled out of the room. As the cries of dismay reached a feverish panic, Rising raised a hoof and silenced it with that one simple motion. "It is our duty to make sure that the Rising Fire is never extinguished!" she proclaimed to them all. "Vermilion may win, but that does not mean our end! It is our duty, our sacred duty beneath Concord, to survive and fight another day when the hedonism of our enemies leaves them weak and unprepared!"\n\nShe gestured vaguely off to the west, to somewhere beyond the walls of the temple. "Over the mountains lies a small and backwards nation. Centuries ago, kirin settlers moved into the small nation of Taungpau and taught the locals the ways of Concord's truth. They have long been in isolation, and thus have been spared the excesses of the Way of Fire. We shall march to Taungpau and take refuge amongst our brothers and sisters, and together we shall stoke the flames of the Rising Fire once more. Everykirin, you have one night to gather what you can and burn what you cannot take with you. The Rising Fire shall live on!"\n\nAnother furore began, but it was silenced as a bannerkirin by Rising Sun's side raised his voice over the noise. "The Fire Priestess has spoken!" he declared. "This meeting is hereby adjourned! Prepare to march at sunrise!""

kirin_republic.28.d:0 "Rain Shine opened first one eye, and then the other, as the sound of approaching hoofsteps roused her from her meditations. When she saw that it was Winter Frost and not Autumn Blaze or Fern Flare, Rain Shine adopted the neutral divine persona that she knew the priestess expected from her as Matriarch Superior of the Realm. "High Priestess," she said simply, watching expressionlessly as the High Priestess of the Way of Fire bowed so low her horn made a muffled scratch across the wooden floors. "What news has Concord seen fit to offer to Her Matriarch today?"\n\n"She has given us a great gift, Matriarch," Winter Frost said, rising from her bow. From within her robes she pulled out a simple scroll, and with her magic she laid it a respectful distance away from Rain Shine's hooves. "Do you remember our great shock at the Rising Fire's invasion of peaceful Taungpau? Well, it would appear that their invasion was a success, and now they are asking us for a cease-fire."\n\n"An armistice?" Rain Shine asked. "The Rising Fire seemed so eager to make war in the first place. Now they ask for peace after violating the sovereignty of a neutral nation?"\n\n"They have abandoned the western reaches of the Realm to our armies, Matriarch," Winter Frost informed her. "They have withdrawn to the mountain passes of Taungpau in exchange for surrendering the Realm to us. It is evident that they are simply buying time, and even though they approach us under the banner of peace, the moment they think they are strong enough to fight us, they will try again." She stomped her hoof, and Rain Shine was taken aback by the display of emotion by a priestess before her Matriarch. "Reject it, Matriarch. We must destroy the Rising Fire now while we have the chance. We cannot let their heresy fester on our borders, no matter how many must give their lives in Concord's name to force the mountain passes.""

kirin_republic.29.t:0 "The Dying Embers" ##Event for KIC
kirin_republic.29.d:0 "Rising Sun sat in the main chamber of a frigid temple high in Taungpau's mountains. Once upon a time, it had been dedicated to one of the earliest interpretations of the Way of Fire. Now it was a crumbling ruin, with boarded windows and cobwebs hanging from the old timbers holding up the ceiling. It was a fitting metaphor, Rising Sun bitterly thought to herself. One faith before hers had died in this temple. Perhaps the Rising Fire would suffer the same fate.\n\nBefore her, on a simple table, lay a simple scroll. Sun had read it and reread it thrice now, and the response left a hole in her gut. It would seem the hedonists in Vermilion were determined to fight the war to its end. There would be no peace; consequently, the only hope for the Rising Fire was to resist as long as it could. Her brave patriots would hold every mountain pass they could and make Vermilion bleed for every inch of ground, but she knew it wouldn't be enough. Barring a miracle, this would be the Fraternal Republic's last stand.\n\nRising Sun looked out a nearby window, where howling, frigid winds ripped past the temple, carrying snow in their gale. Concord's warmth had abandoned her. Now there was only the bitter cold. But with or without Concord, Rising Sun knew she would fight until the end. She would fight and die, a martyr to her cause. Better to perish in the mountains than to live a slave, or be brought back to Vermilion in chains.\n\nRising Sun knew she would die. But her legacy, and the last spark of the Rising Fire, would live on."

kirin_republic.30.t:0 "The Embers are still Warm..."
kirin_republic.30.d:0 "Dayspring Rose sat on a rock overlooking the small mountain village in the ravine beneath her. The air was bitter cold and the wind harsh; she had to pile on extra coats to venture out into the snow and ice, an experience she was hardly used to from living along the Great Mellifluve's pleasantly warm branches. In the town below her, kirin and llamas anxiously shuffled along the streets, keeping their heads down as ragged bands of Rising Fire soldiers trotted among them. Whatever life the town had had long ago been squeezed out of it, and neither the conqueror nor the conquered could escape its weight.\n\nRose clutched a small pendant against her chest and closed her eyes. What was left for the Rising Fire now? The retreat from the Realm into the mountains of Taungpau had been a success, and after a ferocious and desperate fight, the soldiers of the Rising Fire had subdued the isolated nation and turned it into their last bastion of strength. Rising Sun ruled from [KIC.Capital.GetName] with martial law, and the Fraternal Republic had been formally dissolved. Dayspring and all the other kirin who followed Priestess Sun were now kirin without a nation. They were soldiers of the Rising Fire, and little more. Their only consolation was that Vermilion had agreed to a peace treaty with the Rising Fire, even if only Dayspring and a few other kirin knew that the terms of the treaty had demanded the dissolution of the Republic in the first place.\n\nDayspring didn't know what the future held for her fellow followers. Rising Sun promised that one day they would return to retake the Realm, but for perhaps the first time in her life, Dayspring didn't believe her longtime mentor and friend. Their strength dwindled by the day as more and more kirin deserted. Dayspring wondered if one day she would join them.\n\nShe pressed the pendant against her heart. She wished Kindling Flash was here."

kirin_republic.555.d:0 ""Are we all set, Dill? That last barge come in?"\n\nDill Weed cast a glance back over her shoulder toward the river, where several kirin clambered about a large wooden raft and used their telekinesis to lift wooden crates and drop them on the muddy shore. "Yeah, but I'd hardly call that raft a barge, Parsnip." Dill shook her head as Parsnip trotted up to her, and together the two kirin watched the laborers work. "But that's everything we got from our friends in Chrysanthemum. Everything they could spare, at least. They're taking a huge gamble on us, so we gotta make sure that we make it pay off."\n\n"The Incendiaries have carried our spark and sheltered it from the winds for this moment," Parsnip said, and he adjusted the old rifle slung across his back with a brief pulse of magic. "When Rising Sun declared her revolution against the hedonists in Vermilion, I knew that we had to leave Verdant and prepare. Now, everything is ready. Two days isn't much time, but the faster we act, the better. We have to take back our home before the Way of Fire can fortify it. If we can take Verdant, then we give the Rising Fire access to the sea while denying it to our enemies. Outside of Vermilion, Verdant might be the most important city in all the Realm."\n\n"Glad we're fighting on home turf, then," Dill said, and a smile stretched across her muzzle. "Island by island, we'll take back Verdant until our friends and families are free!""

kirin_republic.31.t:0 "It's a Beautiful Day" 
kirin_republic.31.d:0 "Dayspring Rose watched as the procession of the ragged columns of peasant soldiers triumphantly made their way down the streets of Vermilion. Far from the striking uniformity of the NAKP's well-equipped armies or the once-joyous cadres of supporters of the Way of Fire, the peasants of the Incarnadine Soldiery were dirty, disheveled, and disorganized. But still, they marched and cheered and hooted and hollered as they took to Vermilion's streets in celebration. It didn't matter how they looked; it only mattered that they had won. Vermilion was theirs, the Realm was theirs, and the war was over.\n\nAs Dayspring looked around, the wounds of Kiria's most important and holy city stood out to her. Countless buildings were pockmarked with bullet wounds; countless more lie in ashen rubble, the pink flames of nirik rage long ago extinguished when their work was done. But overall, the city held up remarkably well, as the Incarnadine Soldiery's relative lack of heavy weapons had spared much of its ancient architecture from destruction. The city had instead been cleared in brutal hoof-to-hoof fighting, and though the price had been exorbitant and the gutters had run thick with blood and bodies, it was a price that the Rising Fire did not shy away from paying. Now that the bloodshed was done, it could finally appreciate the investment.\n\nFollowing the column was Rising Sun, her head held high and a pleased grin on her face. Dayspring blinked; it was one of the few times she had seen her mentor show such an emphatic outward display of emotion that wasn't passionate oratory or rage. But still, Sun had sent her ahead to assess the situation, and Dayspring had a report to give, so she trotted over and respectfully bowed her head. "Mentor," she said, "Vermilion is ours and the Matriarchal Palace is in our hooves. We finally negotiated for the Matriarch to have her guards stand down and meet with you."\n\n"Excellent work, Dayspring," Rising Sun said, and she briefly touched her hoof to her apprentice's shoulder. "I am very much looking forward to meeting with Rain Shine... but not now." Her grin widened as she looked out over the city and took in a deep breath of air. "It's a beautiful day, and I think I'm going to enjoy it a little more.""

kirin_republic.32.d:0 ""Concord's love for us does not stop within the borders of the Realm, you know."\n\nDayspring Rose's ears perked and she opened her eyes, drawn out of her prayers by Rising Sun's words. It was late at night in Vermilion, and the two had finished a day on the political mess of putting the pieces of the Realm back together with some prayers in the Vermilion Palace's temple. Much of the gaudy iconography of the Way of Fire had already been torn down and replaced with the plain but fiery symbols of devotion of the Rising Fire, but it was Rising Sun's statement that Dayspring focused on. "What do you mean?"\n\n"Concord loves all of her foals, no matter where they reside," Rising Sun said. "Most of us live within the Realm, but there are those who live beyond it. And beyond it, they languish without our protection, unable to express their devotion to Concord openly, and without fear." The priestess shifted, and slowly, calmly, she opened her eyes and looked up at the depiction of Concord and Her holy figure on the wall before them. "I was thinking about it while discussing the ordinances for the Carmine Banners. The Banners will be organized with strict discipline to cut out the corruption, nepotism, and decadence that permeated the hedonists, and they will govern the jurisdictions of the Realm with impartiality, efficiency, and most important of all, devotion."\n\nThere she paused, and in the silence, Dayspring felt herself sucking on her lip, wondering where this was going. "I set aside thirty jurisdictions across Kiria, staffed by veterans and heroes of the Righteous War. But fifty is a more auspicious number, and I realized that if we limit Concord's protections to the artificial borders of the Realm, then we limit ourselves in the realization of our duty. So to fulfill this task, to honor the duty Concord has given us, I'm authorizing the creation of additional jurisdictions across Zebrica, wherever there are kirin. Zaikiria, Madrepore, the Zebrides. Taungpau, too." She closed her eyes again and a small smile returned to her muzzle as she lowered her head to rejoin her prayers. "There is much work to be done before our duty is realized. But eventually, in time, we will bring Concord's peace to all the kirin of Zebrica, no matter where they may be.""

kirin_republic.33.d:0 "First Priestess Rising Sun stood in the Verdigris Rotunda and looked around at the innumerous multitude of banners hanging from balconies, and the incalculable number of kirin crowded onto them. Long had she dreamed of seeing this sight before her, of standing triumphant in Vermilion, her message and Concord's truths realized, and the hedonistic superiority of the corrupt Way of Fire mystics laid low around her. Concord had entrusted her to spread the truth, to turn out the Way of Fire and bring the devotion of the Rising Fire to Vermilion, and she had not failed her goddess. But there was yet more work to be done; Concord's plans had not ended with the taking of Vermilion, but had only just begun.\n\nWhen it came time to speak, Rising Sun wasted no time in taking the microphone and imparting Concord's new vision for the Realm, her voice booming around the Rotunda. "We stand here by Concord's divine will!" she proclaimed, much to the thunderous cheering of the faithful around her. "It was her will that the Rising Fire save the Realm from the forces that tried to destroy it. And we have! The foreigners have been laid low and the incompetence of Autumn Blaze's foolish and misguided government has been driven out of Vermilion. No more can they destroy the Realm, to ignore Concord's will in pursuit of their own selfish aims!"\n\nCheers answered her, but also boos and hisses at the mention of the foreigners and the harmonists that had nearly destroyed the Realm. "To repair the damage and heal the wounds they have caused this country, we will find a new way to rebuild. Not in the careless optimism of the Grand Gallop Onward, which suffered from a lack of direction and the predation of opportunistic foreigners within its gears. Instead, we will move forward in a concentrated and dedicated manner. To this end, I declare that the first of eight Hundred Day Campaigns is to begin immediately!" Rising Sun smiled as they cheered; even without knowing what the Hundred Day Campaigns entailed, the kirin of the Realm were simply happy to finally have a strong leader willing to give them the direction they needed to save it. "By Concord's will and our own labors, we will industrialize the Realm and mechanize our agriculture, establish a proper and modern army, raise the standard of living, and eliminate poverty and illiteracy. These are all tall tasks, but through the devotion of every kirin in the Realm, we can make this a reality!""

"She has proven herself in leading the Rising Fire to victory over the foreigners and hedonists. And you would claim that anykirin has the right to doubt her judgment after the fruits it has borne us?"\n\nThe mare's words echoed in the spacious Verdigris Rotunda, filled as it was with kirin that morning. The chambers were full, with kirin lining the benches as the day's debates wound on, taking turns making passionate proclamations about the Realm's future. On this particular day, Rising Sun presided over the debates from the speaker's dias with Dayspring Rose at her side, while Brilliant Blaze and the other kirin who professed their undying loyalty to the First Priestess gathered around her. Opposite her, spread across the benches that in years past had been dominated by the foreigners of the NAKP or the myriad independents that had filled the Rotunda as the Great Gallop Onward galloped toward its doom, were members of the many other tendencies that existed under the Rising Fire's banner. From the ascetic sectlet of the Purifying Fever to Kindling Flash's agrarian communalists, all the different facets of the Rising Fire brought their voices to the Rotunda, though in this instance it was Flash who rebutted Blaze. "I do not doubt the First Priestess' judgment," Flash said. "In fact, I feel privileged enough to feel that bonds of familiarity and friendship exist between us. I would hope that as such, she would see my questions and criticism as a desire to help her succeed, not a play to undercut her." He paused and took a breath, his eyes flitting to Rising Sun's for a moment before he turned his focus back to Blaze. "It is only through critical reflection that we can become stronger, to find the errors in judgment that would turn best intentions into worst implementations."\n\nAs their debate continued, Rising Sun turned aside to Dayspring. "It seems that they would want to temper the sword after it has been quenched," she said to her apprentice. "Once the steel has been shaped and hardened, fire and hammer can only damage function in search of perfection. Do you agree?"\n\n"I do," Dayspring said, "but who is to judge when the sword is finished? Concord is the smith who forges our mettle. Through trial and tribulation, She tempers our character and makes us stronger. I feel it would be foolish to cut the Goddess' work short because we feel we have been tempered enough.""

kirin_republic.35.d:0 "The printing house in Vermilion hummed with the noise of kirin at work, but the work was done by old-fashioned printing presses and manual labor. The modern equipment imported from Griffonia lay silent and still on the printing floor, in dire need of replacement parts and trained operators that the agrarian tendencies of the Rising Fire had put little thought into yet. Still, as Dayspring Rose and Kindling Flash trotted along the floor and watched the laborers work the old machinery, both felt that it was a fitting way to prepare the celebratory pieces on the heroes of the war who had fought so hard to make the Rising Fire's dreams a reality.\n\nOr at least, that's what Dayspring thought. It wasn't until Kindling Flash glanced at one of the test prints and tossed it away in disgust that she realized there was more the stallion wasn't saying. "It's all glory and propaganda," Kindling took her at her questioning look. "Brilliant Burn took it upon herself to make the literacy campaign a glorified celebration of the 'infallible heroes' of the war, most especially Rising Sun. They're practically godly figures in their depictions. Infallible and incapable of doing wrong."\n\n"Better that than to wallow in quandary, conundrum, and failure, right?" Dayspring asked him. "There's nothing wrong with a larger-than-life portrayal. It's simplified and patriotic, and it will help the illiterate learn to read if they find it engaging and heroic."\n\n"When you elevate ordinary kirin to the level of infallible heroes, they stop listening to anybody who isn't on the pedestal with them," Kindling said, a grim warning in his voice. "You can't run a nation like that. Look at what happened with the Way of Fire. They built their power and influence on being the only kirin that could mediate a communion with Concord, and they ruined the Realm. They became elites who were ignorant to the pleas of the commoners and thought that their mysticism entitled them to it. And now I'm afraid Rising Sun is going to fall into the same trap."\n\nHe sighed and shook his head. "No matter what she may think, or what Brilliant Burn and the other hardliners tell her, she can't forget that she's mortal. We make mistakes. We can be fickle and greedy. She's not above that either. And if we don't remind her of that, I'm worried that it won't be too long before she starts seeing herself as less of a First Priestess and more of a Matriarch.""

kirin_republic.36.d:0 "The air was positively grimey with the taste of ash and soot; Dayspring had been told that it was common these days in the Mellifluve Delta, and as she looked out at the sky hanging over the encampment outside of Verdant she could still see a few plumes of smoke rising from smoldering fires in the fields beyond. It was an odd sight to see in peace; it wasn't too long ago that smoke, soot, and ash belied the aftermath of vicious fighting with the fate of the Realm hanging in the balance.\n\nThankfully, though concerning, the soot didn't portend the end times, though it was certainly concerning nonetheless. Vermilion had recently decreed that all farmland in the Delta belonging to landlords and corporations that had survived the Rising Fire's triumphant storm across the Realm be returned to the peasantry for their communal use. It seemed like a simple thing back in the capital, but as the surprising reports came back of its less than successful implementation and the sheer number of plantations suddenly erupting into pink nirik fire, it became clear that something else was ahoof. Dayspring had volunteered to investigate, and after a train ride down to Radiance and a brief seaborne excursion, she found herself in the Delta witnessing it all with her own two eyes.\n\nIt wasn't long before she was brought to a pair of officers who helped run the camp, and made the situation clear for her. "It's the peasantry," the mare of the pair said with a shake of her head. "They're galloping wild. Burning down plantation after plantation as mobs descend to loot and ransack them before we can get the land secured and parceled away to the communes. And we're not exactly getting a lot of support from Vermilion to deal with the problem. Anything seen as acting in repression of the peasants is frowned upon, so our hooves are tied."\n\n"Let them have their fun. This is justice," the stallion urged Dayspring. "The landlords are getting their due. Many of them are trying to slink away and flee the country, but the peasants aren't letting them get that far. They've spent all their lives, generations even, languishing under heavy and heartless hooves. Now they get to return the favor. Besides," he added with a chuckle, "they're doing us a favor.

kirin_republic.37.d:0 "From the way the Marshal General of the Trypan Interfluve looked at her, and the fire she used to temper her voice, Dayspring Rose knew that her presence was deeply resented, to put it mildly. The mare of the Incarnadine Soldiery wasn't used to having her command questioned, least of all by kirin she viewed as civilians, and especially when it was the government making the inquiries. And Dayspring, sent as a representative of First Priestess Rising Sun to inspect the transition of the Soldiery's occupation from military to civilian rule, ticked all of those unfortunate boxes.\n\nBut the military mare was too disciplined to voice her grievances, and she sat quietly and listened as Dayspring broached the next topic in their lengthy meeting in a private room of the local teahouse. "I want to bring up... let's call them 'concerns' of the local government when it comes to how the Aid and Work Bureau has been managing the supply of local labor in the area," she said, and when the Marshal General frowned sharply, Dayspring knew that the government had a reason to be concerned. "I've heard that compensation for the laborers in the village who have lost everything from the war is frighteningly low, and there have been numerous instances of accidents and illnesses occurring under the A&WB's watch. Considering that the Bureau was established to provide aid and work opportunities for the kirin who have lost everything to the war to give them a chance to rebuild and set their lives back on course, you can understand why concerns such as this have caught the First Priestess' attention."\n\nBut to all that, the Marshal General only shrugged. "I believe it would be best if the First Priestess let the Bureau handle its own affairs," she bluntly stated. "The Bureau operates in volatile areas, and there are still partisans and insurgents lurking within the populace of the occupied zones. By maintaining a strict and controlled regiment for all our laborers, we afford them little time to act to disturb the peace. Frankly, Vermilion should care more about the progress we've made in rebuilding the Realm; who cares if a few bad apples fall off the tree in the process?"\n\n"I believe it's important to remember that a few bad apples spoil the bunch," Dayspring countered. "The careless use of labor by the Bureau needs to stop. The Soldiery should be using the Bureau's resources to rebuild homes and plant fields, not toiling in factories for meager compensation. It's better to rehabilitate the kirin of the occupied zones by giving them meaningful and fruitful labors, not letting them languish for long hours for the benefit of the Soldiery."\n\n"The benefit of the Soldiery is to the benefit of the Realm," the Marshal General insisted, and she tapped her hoof on the scroll Dayspring had been using to record her notes in. "How about you take a message back to Vermilion that they let the Soldiery expand our operations and allow us to standardize them. The less ad-hoc these things are, the better they will run for everykirin involved.

"I'm hoping that there's still some time to make some amendments to the literacy campaign," he said, and his magic arranged the books into a nicer stack while pulling two at random and giving one each to the two mares. "There are some works from Equestria that would make good candidates, from poetry to basic science to famous works of literature. Once they're appropriately translated and formatted, they would make an excellent addition to the religious texts already being prepared for the peasants to consume."\n\nRising Sun flipped through the pages of the book Kindling had offered her, her golden eyes skimming across the words before turning back to Kindling. "I thought we had a sufficient volume of religious texts and teachings already prepared for the campaign," she noted, and her magic closed the book. "Those are something the kirin of the Realm will be able to understand and grasp quickly. They're familiar with Concord; this book from this 'A.K. Yearling' pony, not so much. I fear something like this would only confuse them."\n\n"While learning the tenets of the Rising Fire is still important, we shouldn't limit ourselves to only religious texts," Kindling countered. "After all, if we want the kirin people to grow and realize our ambition, then they'll need an understanding of things beyond worship of Concord. They need things that stretch their mind, and not only teach them how to read and write, but to think, and to do all three critically."\n\n"I think your ambitions are far beyond the scope of the campaign," Brilliant Blaze interjected, and Kindling frowned at her. "This is to be a basic introduction to reading and writing for the mass consumption of our people. They need to understand the basics before they can do anything else, and like the First Priestess said, we should focus on what's familiar and most important in their lives. If they focus first on understanding and interpreting Concord's teachings as written in scrolls, then they'll not only learn how to read and write, but how to keep their thoughts pious and pure should they ever be confronted with texts attempting to lure them into deviancy.""

The two had made a point to find time around the lunch hour to stretch their legs and get some fresh air and sunlight whenever they could. Running the Realm was tiring and endless work, and it was a struggle to avoid letting it consume them. It was productive as well; sometimes discussing a problem with a friend would lead to some new revelation or different angle of approach that could solve a seemingly impossible problem, and the topic of their conversation that day was one such obstacle.\n\n"I don't really know what we should do about it," Dayspring said with a sigh and a shake of her head. "'Concord's Righteous Steeds' are proving to be anything but. They're poorly trained irregulars who have no discipline, and I've been hearing reports about individuals in some of the companies performing all sorts of heinous crimes in the countryside. Between the murder, the arson, the looting, and other even less savory crimes, they're starting to sound a lot like the bandits they were organized to weed out. They're bleeding the occupied territories dry and making them more difficult to integrate."\n\n"Then they need to be gotten rid of," Kindling stated. "They're irregular militias formed from angry kirin who just want to take out their anger on those they think wronged them. Their unchecked rage and brutality cannot undermine the revolution's core values. The people trust us to make the Realm better than it was under the Way of Fire or the threat of what it could have become under the foreigners. We can't breach that trust."\n\n"We can't simply get rid of the Righteous Steeds," Dayspring protested. "They're a reciprocation of the trust of the Realm that we trust them to live pious and lawful lives. Under the Rising Fire, they've been granted greater autonomy than they've ever had before, and they appreciate that." She shook her head. "Maybe the problem will resolve itself in time. The people are angry right now, but soon that flame will sputter and die. I can sympathize with their rage, but maybe when they've worked it out then the Steeds will control themselves."\n\n"If we can't get rid of them, then they need to at least face discipline," Kindling said. "A flame unattended can die out, true, but it can also grow into an inferno. As the caretakers of that flame, we need to tend to it, and we can best do that by putting the Steeds under military oversight and making sure that those who break the law are punished.""

RSTU was to be the crown jewel of the reborn Realm's educational institutions, paving the way for the next generation of bureaucrats, artificers, and military commanders. A degree from the RSTU would be worth thousands of times its weight in gold, a piece of paper that could open up endless opportunities for the kirin who held it, a prized accomplishment that would encourage the growth and development of the Realm's future.\n\nOnly, as those months dragged on, the discussions went nowhere, and instead of progress, vitriol and roadblock sprouted in its place. The university was fundamentally split down the middle on what courses it should favor and hire staff for. The majority of the professors and researchers wanted a flexible and open curriculum with the freedom to manage the internal affairs of the university as they saw fit, hoping to create and foster a spirit of academic creativity and ingenuity that would truly make the RSTU the greatest university in the Realm. But opposing them were a select cadre of senior lecturers who made up the Collective Management Committee who advocated for priority to be placed upon the teachings of religion and the Rising Fire's core tenets at the expense of other topics. Only a steadfast devotion to the beliefs of the Rising Fire, they argued, would ensure that the RSTU didn't become a hotbed for dangerous and heretical thinking, as the All-Kiria Collegium once was during the Grand Gallop Onward.\n\nOnly when it was discovered a few weeks ago that the Collective Management Committee was backed and staffed by bureaucrats from the government in Vermilion did the deadlock begin to break. As the news broke, the students of the RSTU began to take to the campus streets, throwing their weight behind one side or another for myriad different reasons. And as the protests and petitioning on campus grew larger and more frenetic, both the professors and the Collective Management Committee knew that one side would have to yield in order to prevent the university from going from the Realm's crown jewel to the Realm's greatest embarrassment."

kirin_republic.41.d:0 "It didn't take Kindling Flash or Dayspring Rose long to see the scale of the task before them when the train stopped at the end of the line. As they hopped off the locomotive at the base of the mountain, they were greeted by a wall of kirin laborers who looked on at them with suspicion and distrust. Dayspring had known that a strike was keeping the tunneling operation in the mountains from progressing—that was why they were here, after all—but she didn't imagine it had gotten this bad.\n\nWithin minutes, Dayspring and Kindling were whisked away to a meeting room, seated between the mine's overmare and the appointed leader of the striking workers. Though the two kirin eyed each other with hostility, when Kindling pressed the worker to give his side of the story, the stallion held nothing back. "Have you ever tried to crack rocks and move dirt with magic and pickaxes?" he asked Kindling and Dayspring. "That's what we do here. We toil for fourteen hours a day chipping away at the mountain to make a tunnel through to the other side. We take pride in our work, we really do, but it's dangerous and backbreaking. Kirin have died in tunnel collapses, and more have been maimed bad. Enough is enough." He put his hooves down on the table and glared directly at the overmare. "We will not go back to work until we get heavy equipment in here. I know the foreigners had some when they were still around, and it'll make things far safer and far more efficient. We won't work so long as we're treated as expendable."\n\n"We have tried to get heavy equipment, but we simply can't," the overmare retorted before Kindling or Dayspring could fashion a response. "The Realm lacks the industry or expertise to produce it ourselves, and I'll be damned if we become another market for the foreigners to flood with their wage labor goods. For the sake of the future and of the Republic's independence, you must continue your jobs and find a way to make do!""

The strike outside the tunnel had escalated, and the miners had driven the supervisors and their staff out of the workplace entirely. Now, they held the end of the rail line like a bastion, and when the overmare and a few supervisors had tried to force the strikers to dissolve with local police and strike-breakers, the miners had fought them off, killing some and capturing others, including the overmare herself. Now, the rebellious sentiment had seemingly started to seep down the mountains and into the nearby towns, and the workers in the factories in workshops in those towns had openly discussed going on strike in solidarity with the miners in the mountains. Something needed to be done before things got entirely out of hoof.\n\nThe telegram had been waiting for Dayspring when she arrived in town, and it had come directly from Rising Sun herself. The First Priestess, as Dayspring had feared, was angered and intolerant of the situation, and had dispatched a brigade of the Incarnadine Soldiery to put a stop to the strikes and get things moving again. They were due in the town in three days, but in the meanwhile, Rising Sun had asked Dayspring to see if she could get the strikers to back down before the use of force became necessary. But how? Rising Sun did not want to cave to the demands of the strikers, fearing that to do so would undermine the authority of the Rising Fire and encourage more dangerous dissidents to start trouble to get what they wanted in the future. She was prepared to have the bannerkirin crush the strikers with gunfire and artillery to get the mines moving again. Even if Dayspring failed, the mines would open again, one way or another.\n\nBut Dayspring didn't want to give in so quickly. She understood why the laborers were on strike; pay was poor, the work was dangerous, and the supervisors pushed the workers so hard that they were willing to accept casualties if it meant getting the job done at the end of the day. The workers had every right to strike for better rights. And the more she thought about it, the more Dayspring wondered if getting the workers or the soldiers to back down would be better in the long run.""

kirin_republic.43.d:0 "Lasting Luminance leafed through the papers her aide brought to her and sipped on rice wine as the day wound down and the sun set over Chrysanthemum. She thought that being a Standard-Commander of the Cleansing Fire would have been a more rewarding post now that the Realm was saved, but truth be told, she spent most of her days running what felt like a daycare for potential dissidents. First Priestess Rising Sun had rewarded her services during the war by putting her standard in charge of keeping tabs on what kirin from the All-Kirin Collegium remained in the Realm to ensure that they didn't attempt to spread ideas that could undermine the authority of the Rising Fire and tempt the people to heresy. It was hardly a glorious post, and Luminance wondered why they didn't just kick them all out of the country, but so long as they had sworn to serve the new Republic, they had been allowed to keep their posts.\n\nOne of the papers that crossed her desk involved one such member of the intelligentsia, an aerospace engineer by the name of Foehn Torrent. After the war, he had sworn his oath of loyalty and been appointed director of the Republic Army's air force development programme, and after establishing a record of quality and patriotic work, his Rising Fire supervisor had submitted a letter on his behalf requesting the loosening of the restrictions on Foehn's movement, curfew, and mandatory monthly reports to the headquarters in Chrysanthemum. It was the last point that warranted the petition; Luminance knew that all the kirin the Cleansing Fire kept an eye on had to make the journey to Chrysanthemum in person to report on their activities, and the journey was lengthy and tiring. The lost time could better be spent on furthering their work instead of traveling across the Realm.\n\nLuminance blew a strand of her mane out of her eyes and took another sip of her wine. She still didn't trust any of the kirin who served in the Collegium, and she regularly rejected petitions like this one. But Foehn at least had kirin to vouch for him and a track record of success and loyalty. Besides, maybe if she accepted, then that would be one fewer report that crossed her desk in the future."

kirin_republic.44.d:0 "Dayspring Rose grunted and stretched her aching limbs as the court adjourned for recess. Normally, observing a murder trial would hardly fall under her purview, but Rising Sun had taken a particular interest in this trial and had brought Dayspring along to see it. The case centered around an Incarnadine Soldier, brother-sergeant Found Flame, who had been dispatched with a detachment of his unit to find and arrest the fugitive leadership of the Rhapsody Procurate who were hiding in the mountains around Rhapsody. Flame and his companions had found the Procurate, alright, but at a terrible cost from partisan attacks, and instead of bringing the Procurate back to Vermilion for trial, Flame had lost control and murdered them in the nirik state, along with numerous civilians in the village that had been sheltering the Procurate, before he could be pacified. Now, instead of the Procurate being put on trial for crimes of heresy, their murderer stood before the court.\n\nFrom the beginning, Rising Sun had seemed displeased, and as kirin left the courtroom for the recess, she voiced her displeasure in the resulting privacy. "These prosecutors are too zealous," she stated, eyeing the prosecution with smoldering ire. "Flame shouldn't have been arrested in the first place. He dispatched justice far faster than these kirin ever would have, and his righteous wrath was indiscriminate. These kirin would have found excuses to pardon the Procurate, I'm sure of it."\n\nDayspring blinked in shock. "We can't expect to run a nation on vigilantism, First Priestess," she objected. "Found Flame murdered captives in cold blood and killed villagers who happened to be nearby! That's hardly justice, that's barbarity! No one kirin should be able to decide if somekirin else lives or dies."\n\n"I would rather have the justice of the people than the schemes of an educated elite deciding who is right and who is wrong." Rising Sun narrowed her eyes once more at the prosecution before turning them to Dayspring. "The Rising Fire is a faith of the people, and the people should deliver Concord's justice, not lawyers. I believe Flame is innocent before Her eyes. But I wonder how She will see these buffoons trying their damndest to condemn him...""

kirin_republic.45.t:0 "Punishing Provocation?"
kirin_republic.45.d:0 "One of the key differences between the Rising Fire and the Way of Fire exists in the agency given to the kirin who profess their belief in Concord, our righteous Goddess of Fire and Guardian of the Primordial Flame. Whereas the Way of Fire was a highly centralized and rigid belief structure where all authority on matters of ritual and interpretation was concentrated in the priests and mystics, the Rising Fire believes that it is the right of everykirin to meditate and ponder Concord's divine will and teachings. Only through this way could we nurture a spiritual and pure belief in Concord's plan, untainted by the greed and corruption of the Way of Fire priests that controlled what their followers believed and manipulated it into a self-serving tool to feed their own hedonism.\n\nCore to these practices are the wandering preacher-provocateurs who travel the Realm to spread the truths of the Rising Fire to those who have spiritually stagnated under the rotting regime of the Way of Fire. Filled with righteous fervor, these charismatic and dedicated kirin spin effective arguments on matters of religion and governance, pointing out how the old government in Vermilion used the Way of Fire to oppress the people, or how the foreigners sought to commodify our beliefs as a way of controlling us. The best of these provocateurs are well known, and draw crowds wherever they stop to speak. The only problem is that these kirin all have vastly different life experiences, and while personal experience in finding one's beliefs is a core part of the Rising Fire, in these confusing times, these differences are only threatening more heresy as kirin not use to thinking for themselves are subjected to different interpretations of the same core belief.\n\nRecently, First Priestess Rising Sun has proposed the standardization of the Rising Fire's core beliefs and the provision of her official interpretation of Concord's will to the provocateurs to spread to the masses. There will of course be those big names who will be resistant to more closely aligning with the First Priestess' personal views, but in the interest of maintaining religious unity in the state and smothering out fledging heresy, perhaps it would be best to pull potentially problematic preacher-provocateurs aside and host them in a retreat outside of Chrysanthemum until the First Priestess' beliefs can be thoroughly explained to them..."

She had set out to Greater Providence that day on the invitation of Flash Pan, one of Kindling Flash's students and friends, and the young stallion had proven himself both chatty and full of conviction and idealism. Dayspring appreciated both of those traits, but as the pair passed by the bannerkirin guarding the camp, she wondered where that fervor would take them.\n\nShe didn't have to wait long to find out. They were barely a hundred yards from the gate when Flash Pan stopped and gestured at the dirty squalor and filth surrounding them, and the emaciated kirin huddled together in whatever shelter they could find from the harsh noon sun. "Did you know things were this bad?" Flash Pan asked her. "This prison for the NAKP partisans and collaborators is more like a dumping ground. The prisoners here are given no medication, offered no sanitation, and only scraps of old and moldy food. And for what? Because Iron Chrysanthemum partisans keep attacking our patrols?" He stomped his hoof down in frustration. "This is cruel and collective punishment! I thought we were supposed to be better than this! Liberators, not tyrants! Why does the First Priestess let this cruelty continue?"\n\nDayspring looked at the skeletal kirin huddled together, and a frown placed heavy weights on the corners of her muzzle. "It's not that simple," she said in a low voice as she regarded the foreigners who were once her enemy on the battlefield. "The populace here despise us. They're clinging to the promises the foreigners gave them, of building a utopia for them on the backs of our slave labor. They support the NAKP partisans, and until they do, they have to be punished for it. Only when they stop clinging to the lie the NAKP fed them and realize that they stand to prosper from working with us and not against us, then the misery can hopefully end." She closed her eyes for a moment before adding, "I fought in the war. I know how brutal and vicious things got. Entire towns in the west no longer exist because of the fighting. These kirin should consider themselves lucky that the same hasn't befallen them."\n\nFlash Pan regarded her with a scrutinizing glare before abruptly turning away.

"We should... probably discuss it," she said, her ears folding back as the words left her mouth.

"We need to give her the trust she deserves," Dayspring insisted. "She led us to victory when others would have failed. She accomplished the impossible. And she'll do it again." Her hooves trembled, and she pressed them into the ground to stop it. "I-I know it looks bad now, but we have to trust her.

For Wintry Mix, the pain gashing open his heart dwarfed the scalding lacerations of the artillery shell that had severed his foreleg and cracked his horn in the war, and it was because it was all his fault.

And he would make sure of that.\n\nAfter making sure his last two daughters would be well cared for by their grandparents, he had embarked on the long walk to Vermilion on his own three hooves. Many times he had questioned what he was doing, and many times he had wondered whether he should turn back. He missed his daughters; his heart ached, and the only thing holding it together was his resolve. But this would not happen again. That, he was sure of.\n\nWhen he arrived in Vermilion, he spent days tracking his target, finding where she liked to frequent, and when. Once he had picked out a suitable spot, he had half a can of gasoline and donated the rest to the temples. Then finally, when he was ready, he waited at the corner, and when she approached, he swallowed as much of the gasoline as he could stomach, poured the rest on his scales, and galloped into the open.\n\nHis sudden appearance shocked Dayspring Rose, who jumped backwards as Wintry Mix charged toward her.

We need to do something about the corvees; the kirin tragedy is getting out of control."\n\n"No," Rising Sun said, and Dayspring's eyes widened in surprise.

What had once been the Realm's breadbasket, the heart of its agriculture and source of food for the kirin who lived all along the Mellifluve's deltas, suddenly had naught but sand to offer.\n\n"How?" Dayspring asked herself as she looked over the desolation. What had happened to the Realm to cause such a famine? Was it the Hundred Day Campaigns that had stripped so many able-bodied kirin from the lands they had worked for the betterment of the Realm, only to contribute to its downfall? Was it the civil war that had scorched and pillaged the land, grinding so many kirin into dust, their blood poisoning the land? Did it stem back to the Grand Gallop Onward, the failure of which had caused all of this? Or was it merely bad luck, a combination of torrential rains, flooding, and blight sent by Concord herself that had brought ruin to the farms of the Realm?\n\nWhatever the cause, Dayspring knew it didn't really matter. The only thing they could do now is try to fix it before it got worse. It wouldn't be an easy task—so many skilled and knowledgable kirin that could have helped solve the mess had fled the Realm for one reason or another—so the only thing they had left was brute force. As Dayspring turned around and returned the way she came, she started to draft up an order in her mind to the Banner Jurisdictions to devote more kirin to the production brigades to ramp up agricultural production elsewhere. No matter what it took, Dayspring knew one thing for certain: the kirin of the Realm had already soldiered through so much. One more burden would not break them."

She could tell from a distance that they were angry, though not at her banner; their anger was reserved for the ten or so mystic-scholars standing behind her, who looked with worry at the approaching crowd and the seemingly insufficient number of soldiers standing between it and them.\n\nOnce her soldiers had made as protective of a line as they could, Flare stepped forward and raised her hoof, showing the seal of the First Priestess impressed upon her orders. "By order of the First Priestess and executed by Banner Master Signal Flare of the Incarnadine Soldiery, the mystic-scholars of Coriander are to be hereby relocated to Vermilion," she proclaimed, doing her best to raise her voice above the chaos of the mob. "This is not a pardon for their crimes in service of the Way of Fire! Their knowledge and talents as learned scholars will be put to use in securing the future of the revolution, but they shall remain as prisoners of the Incarnadine Soldiery until they have proven themselves worthy of freedom! Stand down!"\n\nThough the decree put some pause into the mob, a few kirin still stepped forward. "These hedonists ruined us with tithes and enforced their extortion with thugs!" one shouted. "You speak of redemption; if that is so, then they must earn it here, breaking their scales in the fields like the rest of us, not in a gilded cage in Vermilion!"\n\nCheers of agreement rose from the mob, and Signal Flare looked back at her soldiers.

In the flurry of confusion and death, it was little wonder that Dayglow's companions, guerillas who still fought in the memory of the NAKP and what it once stood for, fled in confusion only to be cut down by rifle fire once they breached the walls of the camp.\n\nA warrior's cry rang out from behind Dayglow, and the stallion turned about and managed to drive his sword through the stomach of the kirin leaping at him. His assailant coughed blood into Dayglow's face, and her eyes widened in surprise at the feeling of cold steel running through her cut, the burning fuses she'd tied into her mane wreathing it in a deathly glow and a halo of smoke. She wasn't a true nirik, only fought and screamed like one, and she whimpered and fell limp when Dayglow ripped the sword out of her bowels. Dayglow spat in her face as her eyes turned to glass, and then turned back to the assault at hoof.\n\nHe knew from the mare he killed he was fighting the Demon Battalion of the Incarnadine Soldiery, a pack of ruthless killers who hunted down guerillas and anykirin sympathetic to them with violence and glee. Stories of their malice and midnight attacks coupled with their terrifying screams and burning manes shattered most untested kirin on contact, and Dayglow knew that his camp was no different. But he was no green recruit; he had fought in the civil war, and he was no stranger to death. Tonight, he supposed, it was his turn.\n\nBut he had no intention of going alone. Breaking open a crate of munitions next to his tent, he pulled out two sticks of dynamite with lengthy fuses, tucked them into the loops of his ragged mane, and lit them with a spark before leaping into the fray. If the Demon Battalion liked to fight with gunpowder fuses that did little more than smoke and flare, Dayglow would show them just what true warriors thought of that."

Some walked with stoicism and clutched the charcoal sticks of their order in prayer, while others protested and cried out with fear. It separated the believers from the pretenders; why be afraid if you believe in the righteousness of your spirituality?\n\nThis was not the first den of Way of Fire hedonists Linseed had ordered cleared out on the First Priestess' orders, but it was the first one she had overseen in person. This was her hometown of Amaranth, where once she had studied with the mystics and their misguided lessons, and when she had heard that the Way of Fire temple had refused to profess loyalty and belief in the All-Communion Path of the Rising Fire, she had insisted on overseeing their removal herself. Now she walked past the priests in the ditch, looking over faces she once had seen from afar, until an elderly stallion called out to her. "Linseed? Is that you, child?"\n\nLinseed bared her teeth and turned at the voice, but she froze when she recognized the wrinkles on his face and the crook of his horn. It was her old mentor, Cooling Salve, and the stallion looked up at her with worry in his eyes, though Linseed knew it was not for himself, but for her. "What are you doing here at the head of a band of killers, Linseed? Do you not remember what Concord taught us, what we studied together? The values of righteousness, justice, and mercy?"\n\nLinseed summoned anger from within herself and put a scowl on her face. "What justice and mercy did the Way of Fire give the kirin of the Realm?" she asked him. "For years, the Way of Fire preyed on the weak and poor in the name of piety. I opened my eyes to your hypocrisy, and now I will mete out the justice the Realm deserves."\n\n"By becoming a killer?" Salve asked her. "You must be a mare worthy of Concord's love, not a cold-blooded killer who spurns its warmth. Otherwise the misery you sow today will only blossom into ruin and damnation when She passes Her judgment on you." At that, he closed his eyes and turned away from Linseed. "Did you come here to kill us, Linseed, to prove a point?"\n\nLinseed seethed, but as memories of her time in Amaranth's temple came back to her, she felt her knees tremble.

kirin_republic.55.d:0 "Rising Sun watched from the shadowy balcony of the nearby Rising Fire temple as a crowd gathered around a curious figure on the ground below. He was neither a pony nor a zebra, but a deer, and a deer spotted in [ROOT.Capital.GetName], so far away from the yarildoms of Hindia to the north, had drawn a lot of attention. But even more fascinating than his race was his story, and he certainly had quite the story to tell.\n\nThe deer, scarred and lame from injuries sustained long ago, bore the name Cherith, and had once been a thrall at a Chitali shipyard that built longboats renowned for elegance, speed, and a firm adherence to the traditional techniques of his people. It was a lucrative business—for the deer that owned it. Cherith, being a thrall, never saw any reward for his hard work except the ever-growing demand to make more. So, banding together other thralls at the shipyards, Cherith led a strike against the poor working conditions that quickly grew into a revolt. Though the revolt was crushed, Cherith had escaped with several others to Barasingha, acquiring some infamy as the leader of the strike along the way. After becoming acquainted with members of the Marksist-Stallionist Workers' Party of Kiria in Barasingha, Cherith traveled from that country to Fragrance and then to the Great Mellifluve, where he constructed a canoe and sailed to [ROOT.Capital.GetName].\n\nRising Sun had to admit, the former thrall's story was an exciting and inspiring one, and there was little doubt as to why he had drawn such a crowd in the capital. Having him fight for the revolution would be a fantastic and inspiring boon for the cause; he was the model of injustice beyond the Realm's borders and could inspire the kirin of the Realm to not let it fall to the same twisted vices of its neighbors. But if he was associated with the MSWPK, then he was a threat to be monitored. The Workers' Party had little in common with the Rising Fire, and any support the former lent the latter was only a friendship of convenience. Rising Sun wouldn't put it past the Party to try and plant a spy in her midst to steer the Rising Fire toward ideals more in line with their beliefs."

She remembered the day when she first laid eyes on Cherith Kattumaram, the thrall who had escaped Chital and found a new home in Kiria, and found it amusing that in a year from now, few kirin would remember that day, let alone this one, or the deer behind such commotion.\n\nA pamphlet produced by the MSWPK had recently been found circulating throughout the Realm, and it didn't take long to pin Cherith as the author behind it. The pamphlet made many proclamations espousing the strength of the ideals of Marksist-Stallionism, but most damning had been the suggestion to enshrine freedom of religious belief in the Republic's constitution. There were many things Rising Sun could point to in the pamphlet that had led to Cherith's arrest, but the suggestion that the Rising Fire should no longer play a central component in life in the Realm was unforgivable. Kiria needed the Rising Fire if it wanted to stay free and prosperous, and to suggest otherwise was not only treason, but blasphemy. It took no time at all to arrange a tribunal and find Cherith guilty of treason and blasphemy, and the punishment that awaited him was ten years' exile in Labour Settlement 07 at the base of Atramentous Rock in the Peaks of Peril. Sun thought it doubtful that Cherith would be a problem again in ten years' time.\n\nThe tribunal had also been a convenient opportunity to crack down on the Marksist-Stallionist Workers' Party of Kiria; Cherith was only their most popular face in the Realm, and Sun knew somecreature else would replace him in time. At the very least, Cherith wouldn't go to the labour settlement alone, and the jeering crowd that sent him off would give him and any other subversive elements a reminder of what happens when you try to take Concord out of Kiria. Though Rising Sun knew other parties and movements both overseas and at home would denounce the move, she knew the truly pious and patriotic in the Realm would support her. If the Realm let down its guard, groups like the MSWPK would try their hardest to lead the Realm afoul of Concord's will. As Her first priestess, Rising Sun would not let that happen."

"It is so wonderful to see you again. I'm glad to see you safe."\n\n"I'm glad to be safe," Dayspring said, though as her eyes met Rising's, she had to force herself from wincing and releasing a shuddering breath. She had left those eyes in Chrysanthemum when the First Priestess gave her team of Valiants a special assignment to carry out in Concord's name, and Dayspring had looked into them with hope and fervor before. Now she saw the death and destruction she had wrought in Concord's name reflected back at her in the fiery glow of Rising's irises. "I wasn't sure if I would come back," she added, with perhaps a second meaning hidden in those words.\n\nIf Rising Sun noticed, she certainly didn't act like it, and her magic scooped up a wooden box on her desk and presented it to the younger kirin. "Concord willed for you to come back to me and to reap the rewards of your actions in Her name," the priestess said, and she opened the box to present a medal with Concord's visage imprinted on the top and Rising Sun's personal seal beneath it. "I want to grant you a commission in the Army of the Fraternal Republic. You've proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that Concord works through you, both in war and in sermon, and I would ask that you continue to do so in service of the Realm we are now entrusted with. I trust you, Dayspring, and I would ask that you remember that trust with fondness and keep an eye on the Army for me. You can even be rid of that loathsome pirate that's been following you around; I was hoping she would meet a fitting end in your travels, but she's proven much too stubborn to die when she's no longer needed."\n\n"I will... decide what to do with her," Dayspring said, thinking of Roaring Fire with some measure of fondness in the struggles they endured together. "And I thank you, Priestess, but I don't know if I could take such a command..."\n\n"You can, and you will excel at it," Rising Sun assured her, and then, seeing Dayspring still hesitate, she used her magic to gently push the young mare in for a hug."

The two mares had joined many of the Republic's dignitaries and officials for the oath-swearing ceremony in Vermilion, where the NCOs and commanders of the First Regular Brigade of the Army of the Fraternal Republic of Kiria pledged their allegiance to the Fraternal Republic and the kirin people. Given the importance of the ceremony, there had been many speeches and awards to be given out, and the whole thing had dragged on for longer than planned. Dayspring wondered if they were going to finish before the storm hit.\n\nFinally, General Ember Glow took to the podium to lead the oath, and Rising Sun leaned forward in her seat with anticipation. The general was the Republic's most important and famous general; it had been her tactics and unyielding resolve that had helped deliver victory with so little to work with, and even the commoners of the Realm knew her name. Having her recite the oath was as important a symbolic victory for the Republic as any, and the First Priestess held her breath as Ember raised her hoof. "I solemnly swear under Concord's bright and glorious fire that I will support and defend the Fraternal Republic of Kiria," the general said, pausing as the officers recited it back to her, then continued. "I will defend Her prosperous Realm from all threats, foreign and domestic, and will faithfully discharge the duties of the office in which I am about to enter. I take this obligation freely and with clear conscience and earnest will to serve the Republic and no other nation or person. By the divine spark invested in me by our Divine Mother in Fire, I swear this oath."\n\nClapping and cheering erupted from the onlookers as the oath finished, and Ember Glow spared a small smile for the officers, but as Dayspring clopped her hooves together, she saw no such applause coming from Rising Sun. Instead the First Priestess seethed, and though the noise drowned out her words, Dayspring read the utterances from her lips.

"These nirik riots need to be stopped," she said, an irritated growl creeping into her voice. "The Grand Gallop Onward agitated them and they've been allowed to fester since. The hedonists never bothered quelling them during the civil war and we've been too complacent in letting them burn themselves out. You would think they would peter out now that the Way of Fire can no longer exploit them."\n\n"I think the peasants expected more from us," Dayspring posited, and when Rising Sun fixed her with a raised eyebrow, the mare elaborated. "They fought and gave their lives to build the Republic, but in many places, they still don't have access to clean water or good food. We've been hard on them with goods and labor quotas to rebuild after the war, and I think after learning to fight for themselves in the civil war, they don't think the fighting is done yet." She hesitated, then added, "If we don't do something to appease them and raise their standard of living, I think we'll have another civil war on our hooves. Or maybe even the general nirik uprising that Noctilucent Charm had been so afraid of a century ago."\n\n"If they think they can make their lives better by destroying the thing they helped create, then we need to destroy them first," Rising Sun spat with a bitter anger. "Do they think they are the only ones who suffered in the war? The Revolution was born from suffering. There are plenty who are happy with how things changed. Greedy peasants throwing tantrums because they don't sit atop mountains of gold should be punished for their insolence." She turned to Dayspring and fixed her with a frown.

kirin_republic.74.d:0 "Froghoof gasped as he tried to catch his breath by the side of the river, water dripping from his mane and horn onto the sodden ground below. Other, stronger kirin spared him a look as they shook themselves off and pressed onward, and after sucking down air, Froghoof gave himself a shake and willed himself to rejoin the march as it pressed onwards. When he had joined the Incarnadine Soldiery, he had imagined a more stationary deployment in countering insurgents and making sure production quotas were met, not being marched halfway across the entire Concord-forsaken Realm in a week!\n\nBut the march was the only way to catch their target, a roving band of Contumacy nirik insurgents. They weren't difficult to track on account of the fiery destruction they left in their wake, but they were difficult to catch up to without trains or automobiles, and given they moved through the rural forests and jungles rather than the roads or rivers, the Soldiery had no choice but to chase on hoof. The frenzy of the nirik state wiped out the instincts for self-preservation, which Froghoof was ashamed to admit he'd learned firsthoof during the chaos of the civil war when he'd lost control of his emotions during a fight and took three days to calm down. He knew that nirik didn't feel the need to eat, drink, or sleep, and often they would die of thirst or exhaustion if they stayed changed for too long. But the destruction they left behind them warranted a response by the Realm, and it was foolhardy to hope that they'd all kill themselves through their anger. Catching them was the Soldiery's highest priority, especially if they could contain the insurgents before they found another village to burn down.\n\nAs Froghoof rejoined the march, pain and fire burning in his legs with every step, he only hoped they'd catch the nirik soon before he was the one that dropped from exhaustion instead. Fording rivers without bridges and climbing over rocky hills without rest was hardly the epic adventure story he knew the press would tell about them one day—if they were successful."

kirin_republic.75.d:0 ""Place those charges and get out!" the banner-sergeant shouted, and Prickly Pear scrambled to her hooves and climbed out of the dirt ditch placed alongside the earthen levee just south of a branch of the Great Mellifluve. Many mudstained kirin joined her, panting as they got to a safe distance, and Pear's ears flicked toward the south where the sounds of fighting were growing louder. The nirik of the Contumacy were fighting to seize the Moonlight Glow Levee System, and the militia hastily organized by the Incarnadine Soldiery were struggling to hold their fury back. Desperate times called for desperate measures, and there were none more desperate than this.\n\nPear looked back at the fuses as the Soldiery's engineers lit them and let the sparks travel to the placed charges. She knew what was going to happen when those charges blew; the floodwaters of the Great Mellifluve would surge through the ruined levee and wash away countless farms and settlements downstream, drowning thousands. Even during the civil war such an action was unthinkable by either side. The Realm depended on the controlled flow of the Mellifluve to irrigate its breadbasket and connect its massive territory together through riverine trade, but right now, it depended on not being on fire even more. It wouldn't matter if the breadbasket was inundated with water if the nirik would burn it down anyway. And, perhaps, it made sense in a twisted sort of way: the easiest way to put out a fire was to smother it with water.\n\nWhen the charges blew with a crack of thunder, however, and the wave of water rushed out to meet her, Prickly Pear's eyes widened as she realized she and the rest of the engineers had miscalculated just how high the waters would flood."

kirin_republic.76.d:0 "Banner-Sergeant Surefire frowned from the back of the tent as her soldiers took names from the kirin of the small town of Stillwater and gave them old rifles in return. As one of the officers of the newly-organized Anti-Nirik Mutual Protection Army, it was her job to go around the countryside near reports of nirik sightings and equip and train ad-hoc militias for the defense of small villages much like this one. Augmented by a couple of veterans of the civil war stationed in each town to serve as a militia captain, the MPA would train the villagers in basic maintenance of their rifles and simple tactics to take down a frontal charge of nirik scorchers, and hopefully, by arming the countryside and the most vulnerable within it, the spread of nirik fire and madness could be contained and eventually snuffed out.\n\nBut Surefire knew that if they weren't careful, this desperate solution could be the foundation for another problem. It was no secret that the way the First Priestess pushed the kirin of the Realm to their breaking point had been the reason for the uprising, and in most villages they stopped at, the locals didn't think too highly of her, or at least the Rising Fire's regime, even if they knew better than to say so openly. Now Rising Sun was giving them rifles and telling them to fight to protect their homes. If she didn't turn things around, Surefire knew, then even when the Contumacy was defeated, the kirin of these villages would keep fighting to protect themselves—only this time against the Realm itself."

Finally, after three days of a gruesome and harrowing march through nirik-infested territory, the Fifty-Second Battalion of Red Guards had reached the village of Stillwater and set up camp on what was soon to be the epicenter of a nirik horde that had been decimating the surrounding area. The soldiers had dug trenches and weapon emplacements and cleared the fields in front of them to create a presighted killing ground. As the nirik monsters only knew anger and hate, they would simply charge at Stillwater and be cut down like wheat before the scythe. The hard work was done, and now Glory could take some time to relax before the next fight.\n\nThen suddenly there was a scream, joined by one, two, ten, twenty more, loud and hateful. Glory jumped in alarm and looked behind her, where a stream of angry nirik attacked the town from behind, stirring chaos and overrunning surprised soldiers with fire and fangs. In a panic, Glory grabbed her rifle and began firing wildly into the oncoming horde. How did they get around them? The nirik were supposed to come from the front and attack like mindless monsters, not flank the entrenchments! Too late, Glory and the rest of her battalion realized they'd underestimated the nirik. The monsters had outflanked them and attacked across rough terrain where there weren't long grasses to catch flame and spread their smoke as an early warning. It seems, unfortunately, they could think and plan. And with the battalion's heavy weaponry pointed the wrong way, there weren't enough bullets in rifles as there were nirik in the horde."

Elsewhere in the ruins of the town, other soldiers of the Incarnadine Soldiery finished off the grim work of snuffing out the last of the Contumacy as their gunshots split the sudden quiet of the evening. This had been the last holdout of nirik, and on Rising Sun's personal orders, it was Cinnabar's duty, and the duty of the rest of his compatriots, to make sure the Contumacy died here. If that meant every last living thing in the town had to die, they would do it—and do it they had.\n\nWalking out of the alley, Cinnabar sat down and dropped his rifle on the ground. He pressed his cleft hooves into his eyes and flattened his ears against his helmet as if he was trying to smother his senses. How much death and destruction had he been a part of? He had joined the civil war when he was but a colt, dragged along by zealotry and patriotic fervor with his sister, Cerise. The fighting and brutality had aged him, physically from injury and hardship, but mentally, emotionally, and spiritually even more so. He had seen things, done things no colt should have ever seen and done, all in the name of the Rising Fire and the future of the Realm. Now, with the Contumacy against the First Priestess' growing autocracy, Cinnabar couldn't help but feel like he had made one last, tragic mistake.\n\nHe shivered as he sat alone against the wall.\n\nHe wished his sister was still with him."

kirin_republic.801.d:0 "The Rising Fire's conquest of Fragrance had never truly been completed.\n\nThe Fragrancese openly spit on their heretical occupiers, the latest in a long procession of outsiders come to claim the Pearl of Kiria for themselves. But the reports of grumbling, malingering, and back-alley scuffles, were nothing compared to what happened the day of the revolt. The kirin say different things - the Rising Fire claim they were merely inspecting the factory for contraband. The Fragrancese, in jeers and cheers, claim that Incarnadine Soldiery came seeking to drag the workers off to some labor camp, and were sent home running with their tails between their legs. Regardless of the truth of the matter, word spread quickly, tempers boiled over, and the kirin of Fragrance decided that enough was enough.\n\nVermilion demanded silence.\n\nRhapsody demanded submission.\n\nFickle Current demanded endless rivers of gold.\n\nNow, the Rising Fire demanded their very lives.\n\nBut as crowds of furious kirin stormed the streets and threw up barricades, one thing was clear. So long as these fiery hearts still beat, Fragrance was no longer a pawn in the designs of others.\n\nFragrance was for Fragrance. What that meant, exactly, none of the kirin in the city were sure. But in a single day of triumphant rioting, they had reclaimed the Pearl of Kiria for themselves. Time only would tell what they would make of it - and if they could keep it."

kirin_republic.80.d:0 "For all the rioting, the shouts of revolution outside, the interior of the Marksist-Stallionist Workers Party of Kiria headquarters were strangely peaceful. The communists spoke in hushed tones, struggling to decide what they ought to do. Just outside the front door, kirin were dying with paving-stones in their hooves as their only weapons against the Rising Fire's outnumbered but reasonably well-equipped soldiers. In the tea room, the debate was heating up tremendously. The young party member Cramoisy burst into the middle of a discussion between party activist Summer Spice and her aging mentor, Silver Thatch. They seemed about to come to blows.\n\n"Rising Sun is a socialist," Thatch said, almost growling, and narrowed his eyes. "Rebellion against a successful socialist revolution - even an admittedly highly agrarian and religiously-inspired one - is still reactionary. You are proposing that we stride onto the street and give our precious stocks of supplies and weapons over to reactionaries."\n\nSummer Spice seemed furious. "You said it yourself, Thatch, these are hardly socialists, they're thugs worshipping a charismatic priest. The kirin of this city are achieving revolutionary consciousness on our doorstep and you are trying to talk us into backing their oppressors? If Rising Sun's thugs are building 'socialism' - then I am a reactionary! What do you think, Cramoisy?"\n\nWithout much warning, both kirin turned to the poor mare, who stammered and looked back and forth between them. The activist who had first brought her to the MSWPK, the mentor who had taught her everything she knew of theory and praxis... but she had no time to stare. Outside the party headquarters, somekirin let out a horrible wail of agony. A Rising Fire soldier? A revolutionary? A bystander?

kirin_republic.81.d:0 "Chervil Boulevard is host to a soup kitchen and community center more well known for putting on amateur theatre nights than for revolutionary fervor. But it was here that Summer Spice set up her soapbox, in front of a poster-plastered wall, and made her impassioned case. The slogans behind her were completely ordinary in every way. 'Foalcare Center open 8am-6pm'. 'Hindian Literature Club meets Tuesdays at 4'. 'Free health-check appointments available inside'. Against this quaint backdrop, it was hard to believe that these kirin in line had thrown off their shackles and risen in revolt just days before.\n\n"Kirin of Fragrance, we need your help!" she began, and the kirin in line gave her some confused looks. "We started a fight, but we haven't won it yet. This city is about to face down the whole of Kiria under Rising Sun's tyranny! If we want to get out of this without meeting Concord, we need more volunteers to hold the barricades. And we need plenty of kirin to support them in any way they can. The MSWPK wants to put together a special Chervil Boulevard Battalion, but we need brave kirin who are willing to defend their homes!"\n\nThe silence was deafening, and Summer Spice was terrified that they were all about to go back to waiting in line, but then the very last kirin she would have expected spoke up. The grimy, decrepit old beggar Pennywort, perennial malingerer that he was, raised his hoof. "I ain't got much left in me," he said, grimly, "but put a gun in these old hooves an' I'll see 'bout doin' somethin' useful fer a change."\n\nSummer Spice was surprised, but she nodded after a moment. "I... thank you, Pennywort. We have some older muzzle-loaders at the party headquarters." And much to Summer Spice's delight, she saw the rest of Chervil Boulevard realize they were about to be outdone by a useless old fool. Suddenly, the floodgates burst. Chamomile Breeze wanted to be the battalion's medic, the Ginko brothers insisted on donating their grocery's stocks to serve as rations. A few of the local retired bannerkirin volunteered to lead the unit. In just minutes, the MSWPK HQ was swamped."

Then, like most of the neighborhood barricadists, they had hunkered down near their homes, much to the annoyance of the defenders at the front line.\n\nFor the past several days, the CCC had been struggling to convince these neighborhood defenders to pitch in. Brown Beurré stood at the bottom of their barricade, underneath Begonia's watchful gaze, doing her best to convince them. They seemed unimpressed. "We aren't much fans of being told what to do!" the mare at the top of the barricade spat, "not by Rising Sun, not by Fickle Current, and not by some half-pint pony with a funny accent, either!" Beurré bristled at the remark, but did her best to smile.\n\n"Do any of you kirin know how to fire that cann- err, Begonia?" Beurré watched as the barricadists looked nervously at each other, and she smiled. "I hadn't thought so. The Committee isn't asking you to abandon Banyan, but you're badly needed at the front. We can find you somekirin who can teach you how to fire that cannon properly, if you'll bring her up to Poplar Heights and put her to work in the siege. And we can get you all training, rations - whatever we have, if at least some of you will come and fight. You can even rotate yourselves out to protect Banyan if you wish."\n\nThe kirin on the barricades frowned, and mumbled something to each other, before dipping behind them to discuss.

The Revolutionary Council's pleas have fallen on deaf ears - the Brigade was marching out tonight. Their ranks filled the streets in Poplar Heights, attracting attention. Soon after starting, crowds were cheering these soon-to-be-martyrs, draping them in wreaths and having them pass around red banners to sign. Their little parade was stopped when they rounded a corner to find none other than the Mayor of Fragrance standing in their path. She cleared her throat and spoke as clearly as possible.\n\n"Kirin of Fragrance!" she said, "I commend your bravery! But don't fool yourselves - this is all for show, you selfish bastards!"

What are you going to do if you succeed? Do you think you'll take one trench-line and march straight to Rhapsody? If you want to throw your lives away for nothing, by all means-" she stepped aside, clearing the way for them to advance, "but if you're really for Fragrance, you're needed at the barricades.

The gunfire just a few blocks away added a much-needed urgency to the proceedings. The first ballot weeded out a dozen candidates, and now there was only one with enough support to win - a Barasinghan deer named Hartshorn, whose decade of work with the MSPWK in Fragrance had proven decisive in attracting support. However, there were enough firebrand nationalists objecting to a non-kirin commander that the second and third ballots had failed. They had their reasons - from concerns about Hartshorn's competence to out-and-out xenophobia - and thanks to their objections, speeches were dragging long while the shells fell like rain.\n\n"This deer abandons his own homeland, and we expect him to fight for ours? This is Fragrance's revolution, Fragrance's future - he doesn't have a stake in it. Not like we do." The young revolutionary jeered at Hartshorn as the deer stepped up to defend himself.\n\n"I have been fighting for Fragrance for ten years," he began, his voice calm and measured, with only a moderate Hindian accent, "with words, when that was appropriate, and now with a rifle." The deer locked his gaze firmly on his most recent challenger. "A day does not pass that I do not think of Hsihoof and the north," he said, anger tinging his voice, "but my life, my work, my duty, lies with Fragrance now. If you will have me, I will lead, and if not, I will fight all the same. We have time for another ballot, maybe two, but their artillery is slowing down. The Rising Fire will attack within an hour, we must all return to our units. Either have me, or do not."\n\nThough the nationalists hated to admit it, there was no more time to bicker and object - barely enough for a vote before galloping to their barricades."

Even giving the mare a chance to speak had split the council, but in the end Paper Brush had cast the deciding vote.\n\nThe mare plead her case with a strong conviction, but the sweat on her brow. With a slight stammer in her fearful voice she told of how her superiors had died or fled, and how her comrades had turned traitor or left. All of those that remained, however, remained because of the oaths they had taken. "And had I not," the officer concluded, "sworn to protect and serve the kirin of Fra-"\n\nThyme Bloom interrupted her. "Well, don't we think we'll need law enforcement eventually? Why turn down anyone willing to help us? Property still needs protection, even in war," she argued, and those beside her nodded silently.\n\nHer voice was quickly followed by Venn Pauvre, who had openly laughed at the suggestion before a flicker of flame from his horn singed the desk. "They're a cop, Thyme. We hang cops." Pauve spoke simply, and his own clique slapped their hooves on the table in support.\n\nPaper Brush, always eager to mend the party into cohesion, coughed and spoke up. "We're at war, I'll remind the council. Willing volunteers are something we can always use more of, and I doubt any police bold enough to approach us would be our enemies.

Particularly, in one unfortunate case, the skilled-but-reactionary commander of the critical Poplar Heights garrisons, unrepentant NAKP member Alpenstrine. Her address to the Council this morning had caused something of a stir - her call for Fragrance's revolt to be the start of a renewed integralist Greater Providence had alarmed the leftists in the MSWPK, and made much of the CCC and the Provisional Assembly uncomfortably put in mind of the NAKP's original plans. No sooner had Alpenstrine finished speaking than Summer Spice rose with a motion to strip her of her command, and as was becoming painfully common, the Revolutionary Council degenerated into squabbling and shouting.\n\nA recess for lunch ended with an unlikely speaker taking the floor - the prominent businessmare Thyme Bloom. The MSWPK delegates could be heard seething as she started to speak. "The simple fact is that we are at war, delegates, and war calls for unpleasant choices and uncomfortable bedfellows. We need to set aside ideological purity-" she spoke sweetly, but her glance at Summer Spice shot daggers, "-and face the facts. Alpenstrine is a competent commander and we are woefully short of military experience. I move that this chamber preserve her commission indefinitely - and in exchange, I will personally see to it that what remains of my family's enterprises in the city are fully mobilized for the war effort. Consider it a bond against Alpenstrine's conduct."

Troops had to be pulled from the front to quell the disturbance as thousands of kirin pressed towards the harbor, overwhelming even the fearsome barricades on Banyan Prospect. The CCC had called an emergency session by the harbourfront to settle the issue.\n\n"The city is being shelled hourly," Brown Beurré pleaded, breathless after galloping down to the harbour to participate. "We're running out of medicine, running low on food. Evacuating those who cannot fight is our only chance - and their only chance, too." Her words were met with murmurs of agreement from some of the delegates, but also with a glare from the ever-practical Paper Brush.\n\n"They were pushing each other off the docks to get to the front, Beurré. We're lucky nokirin went nirik! Morale has never been this low - and this'll happen again if we keep letting ships dock. We don't have a choice but to stand and fight. We have to stop the ships."

Bringing the whole of the North to our cause could take dozens - hundreds! - of kirin visiting every village and spreading the word. It would take a whole expedition of our best and brightest to pierce the intrigues of Rhapsody alone. Those are kirin we can scarcely spare when the city is under assault by the hour!

The rest was firmly under the Council's control, and tomorrow morning, it would meet to decide what further action should be taken.\n\nIn a haze-filled hotel room-turned-office, Mayor Cherry Blossom and Thyme Bloom were having a somewhat dour discussion. "The MSWPK will want us searching every house for stolen bullion. They'll say the gold belongs to the kirin," Cherry Blossom mused, staring grimly at the rapidly-dwindling nub of her cigarette. "That will go over about as well as promising to kill their families. We have plenty of gold to buy the supplies we really need, I don't want to take the heat for sending armed kirin knocking for the rest."\n\nThyme Bloom seemed less sure. "For once, the Marksists might have a point," the businessmare began, drawing a raised eyebrow from Cherry Blossom. "Yes, I know. But, if we had the rest of the gold, I have some contacts who could get us some... some very good deals. On quite a lot of goodies that are getting increasingly difficult to smuggle in. Tobacco, for example."\n\nThis time they both stared grimly at the dwindling cigarette. "That would be nice..." Cherry Blossom admitted, "but siding with the left, seizing and redistributing wealth, that's playing with fire."\n\nThe left would want the gold. The center would doubtless balk.

The priests had sold themselves too cheaply, too many times. To Vermilion, when they were the sword of the Silence. To Rhapsody, whenever the detested Procurate's self-righteousness boiled over to the rest of Providence. To Fickle Current, when the diaspora's gold paid for simony and corruption in spades. To the Rising Fire, when orthodoxy was abandoned to collaborate with the heretics of the West. But anger at their worldly misadventures gave way to nervousness about their link to the divine. There was no doubt that the Magistracy itself would be disbanded. But what to do about religion in the city?\n\nThe delegates were divided. The radicals called for secularism, appropriation of religious property, for the barring of priests from public office. But the city's liberals were aghast at the suggestion of throwing away so much tradition. The opposition seemed to have orchestrated the attendance of the Magistracy's representatives, because at the height of the debate, a liberal delegate unexpectedly yielded their time to one of the priests.\n\n"May I remind you all - all of you who are kirin, at least," the priest began, casting a pointed glare at Brown Beurré, "that a kirin is a steward of a sacred flame. Perhaps the Magistracy went astray in its mission, but you will do well to recall that the Way of Fire is what has ever stood between sacred Kiria and a nirik-blasted ruin.

And she had taken up the morale-boosting habit of carrying teakettles full of hot broth along the barricades, cheering up her subordinates with a small meal and some words of encouragement.\n\nShe was also dangerously inexperienced, and had a habit of freezing under pressure. She knew how to make her soldiers happy, but jokes and cups of soup are not orders, and the Rising Fire forces are not held back with compassion. The Jasmine Battalion was certainly cheerful, but acted more like a gang of foals than a regiment.\n\n"Jasmine Battalion, your attention please!" Snapdragon barked, though her soft and bubbly voice was ill-suited to the task. From the nearby barricade, a few kirin looked back over their shoulders at her, and at the strange stallion standing next to her. She had to call it out several more times before the whole formation was paying her much heed.\n\n"Thank you, Snapdragon, for your battalion's attention." the stallion said. "My name is Watercress. The CCC has asked me to provide advice and support for your colonel."\n\nA murmur of discontent came up from the ranks, and Watercress shook his head.

If we start killing each other like this - without mercy, without law - we'll lose our city to our own worst instincts."\n\nOne kirin in the crowd simmered with flame. "I don't care!" she shouted. "The Rising Fire takes no prisoners. They've killed so many of our friends - they're murderers, here to destroy our city and way of life! I say we have every right to do what we want to these peasant filth."\n\nThe crowd erupted into a furore, and it seemed that opinions were split.

Today was election day, the CCC had decreed - formally, its very last act before it adjourned, though of course it was still attending to the urgent business of the city's defense. A city fighting for liberty will not long tolerate the slow tyranny of emergency and interim powers. Perhaps wisely, the CCC was giving the city the chance to formally choose how it should be run. Fragrance's kirin were lined up outside of basement polling places, braving the bombardment to decide who should steer their little ship.\n\nThree caucuses had formed leading up to the vote. Fragrance's principled libertarians and neighborhood loyalists had put forward a proposal to formalize the autonomy of Fragrance's neighborhoods, reorganizing the city around a free association of neighborhood collectives. The single largest party was the CCC itself, allied with elements of the left-PA, which were asking for a formal renewal of their mandate, alongside dozens of democratic reforms. A 1:200 ratio of delegates to citizens and instant recall elections for a new Fragrance Assembly were their main points. Not to be outdone, the fractious right, Fragrance's most reluctant revolutionaries, had come together to suggest formalizing Mayor Cherry Blossom's influential role within the city, establishing her popular municipal government - what was left of it - as the legal government of Fragrance.\n\nWhoever won would have the fate of the city in their hooves - and with each falling shell, the weight of that burden grew."

The revolt of capitalist restorationists, revisionist traitors, Vermilion revivalists, decadent bourgeoisie, foreign imperialists, Equestrian lapdogs, Griffonian suck-ups and general heretical, reactionary and anti-Kirian elements must not be allowed to contaminate the rest of Kiria.\n\nIn Apricot Glen, rolling artillery barrages shatter the quiet in fifteen-minute intervals; on once-sleepy Cerise's docks, shipments of heavy military and construction equipment from armories across Kiria arrive hourly. Beyond the harbor, the ships still linking Fragrance to the outside world are harassed and often sunk by raiding flotillas from Sycee. There is not an inch surrounding Fragrance that is not within the sights of a rifle.\n\nRising Sun has made herself clear - Fragrance's reactionary revolt is an infectious disease, one that must not be allowed to fester and must certainly not spread. The Rising Fire forces have therefore declared the city under quarantine. Their commitment to this new quarantine doctrine was demonstrated yesterday, when the revolutionaries permitted a convoy of refugees to cross the last ring of barricades and make their way to the Rising Fire lines, waving hastily-painted Rising Fire flags and seeking to surrender.\n\nReports of what happened next are confused. The Rising Fire claims the refugees opened fire after being ordered to return to Fragrance, and were driven back.

The barricade commander especially sat propped up against the barricade with Macawian cigars and Aquileian bottles of wine demonstratively surrounding her, the Rising Fire showing their contempt for Fragrance's perceived decadence. If any of the Rising Fire's forces had been killed, they had collected their own dead, leaving the Fragrancese as a grim warning.

What's known to the public is that two groups of Rising Fire Valiants, one from the harbour and one coming up through the city's sewers, stormed the Poplar Heights Battery shortly after midnight.

Sewn into false bottoms and hidden pockets was their real cargo - leaflets, minutes from the Revolutionary Council, a precious reel of flim from the day of the revolt.\n\nFragrance was a city ablaze, and for now, its fire burned bright. But these four kirin were carrying a spark from its flame to Rhapsody, and the rest of Providence, hoping to spread the revolution.

From the forests and hollows of the West, to the shores and cities of the North, from the mouth of the mighty Mellifluve to the highest of the Peaks of Peril - no two acres of this land are alike, and neither are any two of its kirin. Under the new Kirian Second Republic, the provinces will be free to embrace their unique cultures, lifeways, traditions, and destinies as part of a checkered but united tapestry, making themselves laboratories of harmony and socialism in all its forms. There will be disputes, and disagreements, but the provincial leaders are eager to lead Kiria towards a brighter future - marching together, each in their own way.\n\nIt was the kirin of Verdant, and later of Chrysanthemum, who first proposed the notion of a Kiria with no Matriarch, but Rising Sun usurped that dream and turned the promise of the First Fraternal Republic into a dictatorial nightmare. Today, with the devolution of almost all power to the provinces, it is the kirin of Fragrance who have restored the promise of the First Kirian Revolution through their victory in the Second. The immense moral authority of the Fragrancese, as the first to raise their banners against Rising Sun, has placed them at the head of this new Republic, but the new constitution has made it clear that they intend to empower, not to oppress, their liberated brothers and sisters.\n\nThat the end of the Silence would bring so much death will be solemnly remembered for generations.

Which made it all the stranger that a place where there were still buildings ruined by artillery would take him and his mother in when they'd fled to the far side of the world from the violence in Saddle Arabia. But the kirin were friendly and welcoming, and that first day, they had been given several new pairs of clothes, and invited to a big community dinner in their new neighborhood on Banyan Prospect. There was never any question of where they would live, or how they would pay for anything - the first time that Hoo'fran's mother had tried to explain she was penniless after paying for their ship, the kirin had waved her off and told her there would be none of that.\n\nNow, in the morning, Hoo'fran would go to a big neighborhood school while his mother helped out in a workshop that made the same new clothes that they had been given on their first day. The Fragrancese did things completely differently than in Saddle Arabia. At home, everyone had their own job and minded their own business, and here, everything was done with a dozen friends. Having class together wasn't so strange, but the fact that the teachers insisted on asking everycreature their opinion certainly was. And forming big groups to work in the school's greenhouses, or to go learn about various trades, or even just to play their strange sports... it was bizarre how much the kirin insisted on doing everything together.\n\nIt wasn't just that everything was together - everything seemed to revolve around the neighborhood. Every night, all the residents of Banyan Prospect would get together in the street to eat, to play games, to sing - often revolutionary songs, though also sometimes the strange hymns to the kirin goddess that Hoo'fran didn't understand.

That we've both been trying. You work hard in your lessons, you've made good friends, and you spend so much time working in that greenhouse. Volunteering after work assignments are over, even! You know that we donate all the extra food to a local hospital?" Hoo'fran shook his head. "You've been putting in the work thinking that you have to pay Fragrance back for taking you in.

Speeches and points, motions and counter-motions - the class spent the whole lesson stumbling their way through their first ever formal debate with giggles and only the barest pretense of decorum.

He'd seen the pictures of the cruelties that Rising Fire soldiers - doubtless some from right here in Sorghum! - had inflicted onto their victims.\n\nDid Rising Sun know? He had known now for a long time that there was only greed for power in her heart, but the things the Fragrancese were saying, whole villages vanishing in the night, corpses defiled... were these her orders?

And as Rising Sun and Kindling Flash looked around at the sights and sounds of the city, Dayspring knew she wasn't the only one.\n\nThe purpose for the visit was a ceremonial one. Rising Sun had traveled back in her role as First Priestess to dedicate the grand temple opening in the city, the Temple of the Ascendant Pyre, a structure built to honor the glory and struggle of the Rising Fire as it purged the Realm of hedonism and corruption. They were on their way to open the ceremony, leading a procession of mystics, valiants and Incarnadine Soldiery, and lining every street, thousands of kirin from all trots of life thronged up against a thin cordon of Soldiery as they chanted and waved banners. But the crowd's presence had little to do with the ceremony; the words they chanted were calls for democracy, and the banners they waved bore the symbols of democratic movements that had spread throughout the Realm. The energy was raucous, the noise almost deafening, but it was neither a cheer nor a jeer.

The longer she withholds her promise of democracy from them, the more agitated they are going to become."\n\n"The First Priestess will do the right thing," Dayspring assured him.

We can't afford to have come so far to lose it all now because we weren't thorough enough."\n\n"Mentor, enough is enough," Dayspring said, finally finding her voice. "You talk about chasing shadows, but that's the thing about shadows. No matter how hard you try, you can't catch them in your hooves... and when standing in Concord's light, we're the ones that cast them." She took a breath, and as she gathered her confidence, she stepped up toward Rising Sun, standing close enough to touch her shoulder. "We've destroyed much of the darkness that plagued Concord's Realm. But it's not our place to finish the job. That task lies with the kirin of the Realm... and under Concord's wisdom, a million candles will be much stronger than one, no matter how great the flame." When Rising's eyes met hers, she found an assuring smile on Dayspring's muzzle. "It's time.""

kirin_republic.202.d:0 "The stage and podium where the dedication of the Temple of the Ascendant Pyre had taken place not all that long ago had been mostly disassembled by the time the order came to abruptly stop. But in the timetable the First Priestess wanted, there wasn't enough time to reconstruct it, so when the confused crowd gathered before the temple one cool morning, they found it haphazardly thrown back together and protected by a thin line of Incarnadine Soldiery.\n\nThere was little fanfare when the First Priestess walked out onto the stage, with Dayspring Rose and Kindling Flash at her flanks, but that didn't seem to bother the normally fiery mare as she stood in front of the podium and adjusted the microphone in her magic. "As First Priestess of the Rising Fire and caretaker of the Realm under the guidance of Concord, I thank you for being here today," she began. As confused silence answered her, she nevertheless continued on, her eyes drifting across the motley assortment of kirin gathered before her. "I apologize for calling you all here with little advance warning, but as my trip in Chrysanthemum was due to reach its conclusion tomorrow, I had no time to organize something grander. But it is my hope that what I have to say today will make amends for that."\n\nShe took a deep breath, and a few kirin in the crowd cocked their heads; it was unnatural to see the First Priestess battling nerves as she spoke. "When the Rising Fire proved triumphant over the decay that had rotted our Realm, there was still much work that had to be done," Rising Sun continued. "I asked much of you, and over eight grueling Hundred Day campaigns, you proved more than willing and more than able to sacrifice in Concord's name. We have done much to reshape the Realm, much of which many kirin would have considered impossible a decade ago. But you have done it, you have triumphed... and it is finally time for the reward so long promised. Effective immediately, I am organizing a transitory regime and implementing a committee to oversee the organization of democratic elections throughout the Realm. Soon, your destiny will be in your hooves, as you have earned it. Your dream—our dream—began here in Chrysanthemum. And now I am happy to announce its fulfillment in the city I came to call my home."\n\nIt took a moment before her words cracked through the stunned silence of the crowd, but when it did, it was like a bursting dam. Cheers and tears of joy erupted from the crowd, and emotional kirin hugged each other amidst the chaos. Rising Sun watched them from afar, wondering what they would all think of her once the heat of the moment had passed, wondering if one celebration would wipe away the blood that stained her hooves, until she felt Dayspring's hoof on her shoulder. Her apprentice smiled at her, and only then did Rising Sun let out a sigh of relief as an enormous weight was removed from her shoulders."

kirin_republic.203.d:0 "Dayspring blew faintly on the ink drying on the sheet of parchment paper to help it along, then paused to consider her words. Though the characters would be transcribed by printing presses and dispersed across the Realm through telegraph, she gave what would soon become an executive order in the vein of the imperial decrees of the Matriarchs the attention to detail and polish it deserved before presenting it to Rising Sun for her signature. Though, she decided, it wasn't the parchment itself as the reason why she gave it such attention, but the message it contained.\n\nWith Rising Sun's announcement that the democratization of Kiria had finally begun, one of the first and loudest new movements that finally felt safe and confident enough to make its voice heard was to grant amnesty to the Fragrancese Revolutionaries. Though the kirin of Fragrance had been put down and forced under strict military occupation by the Incarnadine Soldiery for daring to oppose the Rising Fire, many agreed that it was time to loosen the reins and extend a hoof in forgiveness. Prison camps would be emptied, the military garrison in the city reduced to a skeleton crew, and delegates from both Vermilion and Fragrance would meet to discuss terms on autonomy and freedom that would dictate the latter's relationship to the former as a member of the Republic. Even though they had lost their revolt, it seemed like the kirin of Fragrance got what they wanted in the end.\n\nDayspring paused as she thought that over. No, the revolt had not lost. They fought for what they believed in, and even though it had been squashed, they had established their position with blood, and when Vermilion invited them back to the negotiating table, they had a clear and strong hoof to play. Perhaps the Fragrancese struggle of death and destruction mirrored the Rising Fire's in a way nokirin thought possible at the time... though of course, it would need to be seen in practice to be believed.\n\nHumming, Dayspring rolled up the scroll and set off to find Rising Sun for her signature."

kirin_republic.204.d:0 "Labour Camp 07 was an imposing sight, perched as it was along the craggy cliffs of the Peaks of Peril, and Dayspring had to admit, it was also a soul-crushing one. Even if prisoners managed to sneak past armed guards and razor wire, there was only one road to the camp, meaning any feasible escape attempt made scaling slippery rocks and contending with the harsh elements a necessity. It was little wonder why, in its short history, Dayspring had never heard of any successful escape attempts—though the failed ones were as numerous as their conclusions were inevitable.\n\nBut escape was no longer necessary after today; when the camp's commander received her, she presented him a scroll sealed with Rising Sun's personal seal, the contents of which ordered the camp to be emptied out and the prisoners released at once. And while the commander took care of that, there was one prisoner in particular Dayspring wanted to see.\n\nShe found the antlered prisoner in a shoddy bunkhouse reading a Rising Fire pamphlet, and when he saw her, he gently set it down and folded it up. "They don't give us much leisure time when there's gravel to be crushed, but I did ask for something and was given this." Cherith Kattumaram shrugged and tapped his hoof on the pamphlet. "I keep my mind sharp by debating the statements inside, but there's only so much you can do with the same argument over and over again. At least tell me you've brought me something better to read."\n\nDayspring took a breath. "You're free to go, Cherith," she told him. "The democratization of Kiria has begun by Rising Sun's orders. Keeping you here is wrong, and I'd like to apologize on her behalf for everything you've endured here. If you're willing, the Realm would be stronger to have your voice join us in Vermilion."\n\nCherith mulled that over quietly, his eyes drifting back to the pamphlet. "Why should I believe you?" he asked her. "What evidence do you have that your fire priestess is a different mare? Her greed and paranoia sent me here. I don't see why any reforms that come from her hooves would do anything other than strengthen them. I will not legitimize an autocrat by giving her my support when I see no reason to."\n\n"You don't have to come with me, but I encourage you to see for yourself," Dayspring said, and with a bow, she turned around to take her leave. "The camp will be emptied today. Travel the Realm. See for yourself. And if you come to believe I'm telling the truth, we'll be happy to have you in Vermilion.""

She was here to make a radio broadcast, but her scales itched as she fought to sit still. Every fiber of her being worried that she was about to make a terrible mistake, and she knew there was still time to go back. Could she live with herself if she'd thrown it all away, if her sacrifices had mean naught, if the Realm fell apart because she let go too soon—"\n\n"First Priestess, whenever you're ready," said one of the technicians, snapping Rising Sun out of her worries, and swallowing hard, she forced herself to nod back at the kirin. There was a countdown, recording equipment whirred to life, and Rising Sun looked down at the words she'd agonized over the night before, now clutched tightly in her hooves.\n\n"Citizens and devout faithful of the Realm, if you do not recognize my voice, this is First Priestess Rising Sun speaking to you," she said, making her way through the words more like a nervous acolyte reciting a reading before a room of senior mystics than the First Priestess of the Realm. "I am reaching out to you with his broadcast to inform you of important changes happening in Vermilion. As a result of the ongoing democratization efforts, I am relinquishing the power invested in me by Concord and the Matriarch to the kirin of the Realm, effective immediately."\n\nThere, she'd said it, and in doing so, she felt a surprisingly heavy weight disappear from her shoulders. "Furthermore, I am renouncing my position as the absolute leader of the Rising Fire, and will be divesting my responsibilities to a council of senior mystics and priestesses. The Incarnadine Soldiery and the Grand Army will no longer be mine to control alone; responsibility for their actions will be given to officials in Vermilion to use as the Realm demands. All of this, and more, will be part of a draft of a constitution I will be presenting in Vermilion today.\n\n"You may ask why all of this is being done now," Rising continued, and she set her words aside, no longer needing them to deliver her speech. "The truth of the matter is that you are ready for this. Now is the time for the Realm to guide itself. My guidance is no longer needed; I see in the sacrifices you all have made that you are ready for the mantle of responsibility, so like a proud mother letting her daughter leave the nest, so too do I stand by and watch as you make your future for yourself. It is my hope that it is a bright and prosperous one under Concord's light, and like that daughter's mother, I will remain close should you need my advice.""

For a moment, she was back on the frontlines again, storming an NAKP bunker while artillery mulched the earth around her and bullets whizzed like angry hornets. Then she blinked again, and she came back to reality, where she was working on the side of a half-finished bridge spanning the Great Mellifluve, and the boom she'd heard was merely a tall tree being toppled for lumber.\n\n"Careful, Fire, you dropped this," came another kirin's cheerful voice, and she leaned over the scaffolding to see Waterline floating her hammer back up to her. When Fire Flower sheepishly took it back, he glanced back in the direction of the fallen tree. "Don't worry, it got a jump out of me, too."\n\n"Have to remind ourselves those days are behind us, now," Fire Flower said, and she turned back to her work. "Hopefully our days of having somekirin shooting at us are done for."\n\n"I get what you mean," Waterline answered her. "I'd much rather be doing this. Feels good to be building something, not blowing it up. Plus, I like it when the locals are bringing us free food and water not because they're afraid of us, but because we're giving something back to them."\n\nFire Flower hummed in agreement, even if it was lost over the noise of the construction site.

kirin_republic.207.d:0 "Rising Sun looked at the map sprawled across her desk and calmly sipped on her tea. It was a map of Kiria and the states that surrounded it, but Rising found her attention attracted to the southwest, where the collection of states that made up the region of Zaikiria lay. One day, those states would be free, free like the Realm, saved from warlords and nirik and hostile zebra raiders. When that day came, they would be ready to join the Realm as a sister republic, ready to take after Kiria after a little bit of guidance and a gentle hoof showing them the way from Vermilion.\n\nBut as her attention swept over Sen Kinh, she paused on the city of Blossom. The city sat near the border of the Realm and was an important center of riverine trade. Once upon a time, it had been a core part of the Realm that controlled and managed the waterways that divided kirin land from zebra land, but when the disaster of The Silence came to be, the kirin there had separated from the Realm rather than follow its decrees. Over time, the Kirian kirin that lived there culturally drifted in a Zaikirian direction to the point where they were neither Kirian nor Zaikirian, but a mixture of both. When the sister republic of Zaikiria is inevitably created, what should the Realm do? Should it keep Blossom for itself, reuniting long lost foals of the Realm? Should it send Blossom off its sisters in Zaikiria, to continue on the trend it has followed for a century? Maybe the kirin of Blossom themselves should decide?\n\nRising Sun took another sip of her tea and pondered the question in silence."

Leaders of the Incarnadine Soldiery and the most influential members of the Rising Fire looked on in awe, and perhaps some apprehension, as Rising Sun stood before them dressed in fiery, flowing robes. She wasted little time before launching forward with her address, feeling completely confident and in control of the air she commanded. "The time has come for radical changes," she announced to them all, her piercing, burning gaze sweeping over the gathered kirin one by one. "The republic is an unsteady, dangerous thing. Everywhere we look, heretics, hedonists, and foreign infiltrators turn the tools of democracy against us. Every loophole in the law is exploited, and insidious agents tie knots in our faith. If our work is to continue, if we are to keep what we have gained, this cannot happen any longer."\n\nHer audience listened in enraptured silence, and the corners of Rising's lips curved upwards. They were true believers, she could tell. Zealous and loyal. "Tomorrow, I will assume the mantle of Supreme Matriarch of Kiria. The Rising Fire has flourished under my guidance; when I merge the responsibilities as head of our faith with those of the head of state, the Realm will grow stronger than ever before. Where the republic was weak, the Realm of the Kirin under my guidance will be eternal and infallible. I shall bring freedom and prosperity to all kirin, regardless of where they are, as Concord demands it. The Incarnadine Soldiery will be my bow, and they shall let fly the arrow of Concord's justice at our enemies, wherever they may be. The Banner Jurisdictions shall be my voice, and they shall let it be heard with absolute clarity throughout the Realm."\n\nThen she swept her eyes over the crowd once more. "And you all shall be my foals, those who will build the Realm with me. As you once bowed before the Matriarch Superior, kneel before me as your Supreme Matriarch. Your loyalty will be rewarded, and your flames will grow brighter than ever before. Let me know now if I should nurture them or snuff them out.""

Nothing would be enough to chase away the feeling of betrayal that clawed at her heart.\n\nElsewhere in the dingy gambling den, Kindling Flash argued with a kirin by the name of Flash Pan, which she recognized from... somewhere. Her head hurt too much to think straight, but she had enough wits still to listen. "I knew this was going to happen!" Kindling seethed, and he moved like a stallion possessed, throwing whatever supplies he could into a worn pair of saddlebags in a frenzy. "I knew Rising Sun was a usurper! She used us, had us crack down on the Realm under the promise of one day loosening the reins, and when she was sure of her power, she took them from us! I should have tried to do more, fought back, done something while I still had the chance!"\n\n"We can still fight her!" Flash Pan protested. "There are enough of us loyal to the republic, to what we actually fought for! She won't win that easily!"\n\n"Yes she will!" Kindling shouted back at him. "The army, the state, everything swore allegiance to her. She's purged those who could strike back at her and isolated those who could speak out. A friend in the Soldiery told me that I'll be arrested tomorrow. If the Scouring Flame gets their hooves on me, I will be as good as dead. What we need to do now is flee to exile, regain our strength, and come back." His magic closed the bags and hefted them onto his back. "Dayspring, come on.

Panic, worry, fear—all those emotions raced in her mind, clawing at her conscience, stealing rest away from her.\n\nHow could she have let things come to this? It was her blindness, she knew, that had allowed her mentor to betray the revolution. The death of the Republic laid not at Rising Sun's hooves, but Dayspring's. She stood by while Rising assembled lackeys around herself and suppressed the true believers in the Republic. She stood by when the camps were created, the Incarnadine Soldiery ran roughshod over the kirin of the Realm, when the blood price the First Priestess demanded in the name of stability grew ever higher. That blood price marked Dayspring's scales too, she knew. She had helped Rising exact it from the populace. Now, Kindling Flash had fled overseas, her closest friend gone from the Realm, and she was alone. In blindly following Rising Sun's commands, Dayspring had trapped herself in a box of isolation and fealty to a tyrant.\n\nShe tossed and turned on her sleeping mat. What would she do? Could she even do anything? She supposed she could take a stand, as futile as it would be. There would be no hope she would succeed in toppling the tyrant Rising Sun had become. She would surely die. Would she kill herself in the name of the conscience she found too late? Or would she keep her head down and continue as the Supreme Matriarch's student? Rising Sun still trusted her, she could use that authority to try and soften the excesses of tyranny. But would making tyranny palatable to the Realm only allow it to sink its hooks deeper in the long run?\n\nA small whimper of frustration escaped her throat. She didn't know what to do, but she knew she would be forced to choose soon."

As the brown liquid splashed out of the container and stained the table, she looked up at the flamboyantly dressed Roaring Fire. "Drink up," she said, taking a large gulp of her own drink and sitting across from Dayspring at the table. "Ever since your First Priestess started calling herself Supreme Matriarch, you've looked like you need something stiff. You haven't been the Dayspring I know for a while.\n\nDayspring gave the liquid a sniff and frowned at the slightly sweet smell, and when she took a sip, she gagged at the potency hidden behind the sweet taste. "What... is this?" she coughed out, feeling the burn run down her throat and settle in her gut.\n\n"Grog from Puerto Cabello," Roaring said. "Strong stuff I save for special occasions. Much better than the rice stuff you river kirin only know. Maybe it'll help you decide if you're going to lash out at Rising Sun or fold to her."\n\n"I'm that easy to read, huh?" Dayspring asked, and at Roaring's smirk, she rolled her eyes and forced herself to take another small sip of the grog. "I just... don't know what I should do," she admitted. "I let this happen. I stood by while my mentor consolidated her control over the Realm. I blinded myself to the obvious fact that she never intended to give power back to the people. Now Kindling Flash is gone and nokirin is strong enough to oppose her. Even if I took a swing at her, I'd just die. Maybe I'd be better off trying to work with her and limit the autocracy where I can."\n\nThat only earned a harsh laugh from the pirate queen.

Roaring Fire shook her head, and her magic removed one of her swords and set it on the table between the two mares. "Think about it this way. Kirin are going to remember your name no matter what you do. You're Rising's student, her ever-faithful acolyte. They'll remember if you serve her faithfully or if you died fighting for what you believe in. Take it from somekirin whose name is going to be remembered for generations for the terror I wrought on the high seas; if there's a purpose to life in this world, it's making sure somecreature remembers you when you die.

A terrible, cruel fate awaited the names on that scroll. All would be arrested by the Scouring Flame in the coming days, and many would disappear forever. And the worst part was, Dayspring remembered the faces tied to most of them. Many of them were kirin she had considered friends during the revolution. She had looked forward to working with them once the Republic was established. Now, on orders from her mentor, she was sealing their fates.\n\nIt was a cruel test, Dayspring knew. After resolving to continue to serve Supreme Matriarch Rising Sun and do her best to curb what excesses of tyranny she could, her mentor had immediately presented her with what served as a loyalty test. Dayspring knew she could get away with leaving a few names off of the list, but not many. Spare too many kirin and she'd find her own name on somekirin else's list. List too many and she'd be betraying her own beliefs, betraying the reason she even decided to stick with Rising Sun. How does one find the right price when the price is paid for in kirin lives?\n\nUltimately, tears brimming from her eyelashes, Dayspring rolled up the scroll and sealed it. She felt empty, like her soul had already left her body and rejoined Concord in the Primordial Fire She nurtured. But she even doubted that; why would Concord let the soul of the mare who did nothing to stop tyranny, who stood idly by as the Republic and the Matriarch were usurped, rejoin the Fire?"

Her parry was sloppy, slow from exhaustion, and the soldier's retaliation earned Dayspring a crunch from her breaking nose as hilt met snout, but with one final push, Dayspring managed to twist her sword inside her opponent's stance and end the bout then and there.\n\nThe path to the throne room was open, but not for long, so Dayspring limped ahead, panting as her blood ran down her body, taking her energy with it. She was on a suicide mission, she knew, but she had to prove that somekirin was willing to stand up to the tyrant Rising Sun had become. It was a desperate hope, certainly a foolish one, but if she could just get to her former mentor, if she could just put a stop to this...\n\nThe moment she entered the throne room she tripped over her robes and it took her all her strength to stand again. But there before her, seated on the throne that Rain Shine once commanded, was Rising Sun, the Supreme Matriarch of the betrayed revolution. Gasping, Dayspring raised her sword and pointed it at Rising Sun. "In the name of the Fraternal Republic, I challenge you, Rising!" Dayspring gasped, her blade shaking in her wavering grip. "I will not let you destroy what we worked for! I won't let you betray us! I won't let you betray me!"\n\nBut rather than answer her challenge, Rising Sun just slowly shook her head. "How many kirin did you have to kill to get here, Dayspring?" she asked. "I admire your conviction. I always have. And I hoped that when the time came, you would do what's right. But it seems I was mistaken." She sighed and waved her hoof, and from the pillars around the throne room, eight more kirin appeared, fresh and ready to fight. As Dayspring swallowed hard and sized up the insurmountable odds around her, Rising descended from the throne and turned to leave, pausing only long enough to order her guards, "She came here seeking a warrior's death. At least give my student that one last gift." And with that, she left them behind, ears flicking as the song of steel on steel rang out behind her."

"If you're going to go down in a blaze of glory, then what kind of legend would I be if I passed that up? I'm coming with you. Maybe the two of us together will actually stand a chance."

Now, it was a frantic fight to the throne room to try and put an end to the Supreme Matriarch's brief reign the hard way, as much as the thought pained Dayspring.\n\nBut when the two mares burst into the throne room, they were not alone. Rising Sun was there, but a small army of guards stood between her and them, and Rising Sun sneered at them. "When I realized there were enemies all around me, I did not realize they included you, Dayspring," she snapped at her former apprentice, anger seething in her voice. "I thought you were better than this. If I had known the pirate would corrupt you, I would have had her killed the moment she fell into my hooves."\n\n"I didn't do anything. You did that yourself," Roaring Fire rebuked her, and seeing the opposition between them and Rising, she bared her teeth and drew a pistol, her magic providing a momentary spark for the crude black powder weapon even as she aimed. Fire flew as the weapon barked a report, but Rising Sun was already running, and the bullet only grazed the scales of her back before sinking into the throne she'd dived from. It was then that Rising Sun's guards attacked, and Roaring and Dayspring could only backpedal against such an onslaught. "We need to go!" she shouted to Dayspring. "Rising's gone, we're not going to get to her!"\n\n"But where?!" Dayspring shouted back, even as she warded off attacks with her sword. "We can't have come all this way for nothing!""

"Rising Sun once led us, but she has become the very thing she promised she would lead us to destroy, if not worse. She is a tyrant obsessed with power and control. She will undo everything that we fought so hard to accomplish. Do not let her do this! Do not let her steal away everything we fought for! Open your eyes like I have, and see the truth!"\n\nGunshots rang out, and Roaring Fire lurched back, coughing and spitting up blood as the kirin outside fired through the door. But even as they burst into the room, Dayspring clutched the microphone tightly in her magic.

Somehow, she and Roaring Fire had managed to steal a fishing boat and escape down the Great Mellifluve in all the chaos that had engulfed the city, and now they were practically alone on the water. Soon, they'd pass through Massicot, and then eventually, Verdant, where Roaring Fire assured Dayspring that she still had some old connections from her pirating days that could pick them up in a junk and disappear into the ocean.\n\n"Didn't think we'd get out of that," Roaring Fire muttered, perhaps only to herself. "It'll take them some time to realize we went down the river and not towards Radiance. That should give us everything we need to slip away." When Dayspring didn't answer, Roaring sighed. "Or do you want me to turn this boat around so we can get ourselves killed after all?"\n\n"No," Dayspring finally muttered, and she leaned over the side of the boat, letting her hooves drag in the water. "We already took our shot, and it didn't work out. We won't get that close to Rising Sun ever again." She sighed again, then sat upright. "We'll go to Hindia, find Kindling Flash. We'll keep fighting. No matter what it takes, I will fight until Kiria is free. I swear it before Concord that I will not abandon the fires of fate until the Realm is free or Rising Sun finally snuffs out my spark."\n\n"Poetic," Roaring remarked. "You sure you don't want to just become a pirate? Glory, riches, all that?"\n\n"I could never," Dayspring said, shaking her head, but she waved a hoof at Roaring. "You can do whatever you want. You don't owe anything to me. Especially after sticking with me in Vermilion. But whatever you do, at least know that I'm grateful. For everything."\n\n"I know," Roaring said, a little smirk on her muzzle.

A few blocks down, just out of earshot, a cadre of uniformed Soldiery kirin dragged a few kirin in Fragrancese clothing out of a house and roughly shoved them into the back of an idling truck, while a few other kirin in laborer's garb dumped furniture onto the road. An inspector waited nearby, scribbling a few things into a scroll, and Saffron knew that soon enough, another family in the Soldiery would suddenly see their lives change for the better.\n\n"Come on, let's go inside and check it out!" he encouraged his marefriend, gently nudging her toward the door.

She'd considered herself lucky when she'd escaped from the ambush with just a gut wound, but the farther she trudged from the fighting, the more she stumbled and the slower she moved. Now she didn't know if she would even make it to the next town over before the Supreme Matriarch's forces caught up with her.\n\nIt had all gone so wrong. When she and her compatriots had heard Dayspring Rose urge the Realm to fight against Rising Sun's tyranny, they had rushed to take up arms and secure Chrysanthemum as the seat of a new revolution, the revolution renewed. But it was not to be. When they sent out the call, few answered. What had once always been a hotbed of patriotic fervor and sentiment had been pruned down over the months by Rising Sun's purges, leaving only a few scattered embers to burn, flicker, and die in a directionless, confused uprising. It hadn't taken much effort for the Infernal Columns to restore order in the days following the initial uprising, and the speed at which they crushed it was a demoralizing blow that Brilliant feared would be impossible to recover from.\n\nBut Dayspring had been right, before they killed her. So long as one kirin remained alive who remembered the revolution, who was determined to fight, then it was never truly dead. The Infernal Columns may have slaughtered her friends around her, but Brilliant had escaped. She would live on to tell their tale. She just had to make it to the next town over, find somekirin who would take her in...\n\nShe grimaced and fell to her flanks, clutching at her wound. "I'll... make it..." she wheezed to herself.

But they had all been gathered together in Vermilion for one purpose, and refusal had not been an option.\n\nHeads turned as a figure garbed in brilliant reds and oranges approached; it would have been impossible to miss the Supreme Matriarch even without the vibrant outfit from the sheer respect her dominating presence commanded. Kirin bowed their heads as they approached, and all sought to avoid the sharp, piercing glare of her fiery eyes. Those eyes could peer into a kirin's soul, and if they saw even a flicker of discontent, an ember of treason, they could snuff it out with a look.\n\nPerhaps that was the real reason why Supreme Matriarch Rising Sun had gathered them all before her in Vermilion to swear an oath of loyalty before her. Doubtless it would have been easier to pledge loyalty before local officials acting in the Matriarch's name, but then Rising wouldn't have been able to judge them herself. It was no secret that her judgment was swift and absolute. A conspicuous absence among the gathered kirin was that of General Ember Glow, the famous commander who had led the Rising Fire to victory in the civil war. She had not been seen in some time, and rumors swirled about her fate. But in some small way, everykirin knew the truth. Ember would not bow before the Supreme Matriarch, and she had been removed.

From sun up til sun down, he studied and trained with a hundred other colts and fillies his age, all while uncaring and disciplinarian teachers tried to drill knowledge into their little scaly skulls. Every adult in the boarding school demanded silent obedience, and they were not afraid to hoof out discipline if they felt the need to, forcing foals to stand outside in parade formation for hours as punishment.

I know that Mystic-Commissar Judicious Raven (if that even is her real name) stressed that my work is top secret and I should avoid writing things down if at all possible, but considering the kind of kirin the Censorate employs, I think I'd be better off covering my tail and keeping notes somewhere. Just in case.\n\nI recently returned from a visit to Rhapsody where I was able to speak with Heavenly Fire, the ancient mare who leads the Way of Fire Procurate there. Though the heresy has been dismantled, the old mare still lives under house arrest and is generally free to do as she pleases; I guess even for all of the Supreme Matriarch's power, even she can't be rid of the old nag lest the city rise up in revolt. I suppose in a way it was fortuitous, though. Otherwise, I wouldn't be able to learn what I did. I came to her at the request of the Censorate to inquire about Rain Shine's ascension to Matriarch Superior—after all, Heavenly Fire was one of the mystics who was present at the affair in 971. I wanted her to recall the ceremony in as much detail as she could remember, and to my surprise, she was quite forthcoming, and I wrote down all I could.\n\nThe scene was set thusly: one morning, the mystics carried the body of Rain Shine's mother, Noctilucent Charm, out beneath the Verdigris Rotunda, and after hours of prayer and recitation of Concord's Word, the body was set ablaze in a great fire. At the height of noon, Rain Shine nervously stepped into the flame in ceremonial garb, at which point the fuel was collapsed atop her. Only when the flames had turned to ash did she emerge again, her robes burned away, and her newly majestic body covered horn to hoof in soot. Thus, in the funeral pyre of her mother, was the last Matriarch Superior of the Realm born.\n\nI asked Heavenly Fire if there was anything more she could tell me about why the ritual was performed the way it was, and she admitted that not even she nor the other mystics knew much about what causes the physical transformation of a normal kirin mare into the tall and holy avatar of Concord she becomes. But she did tell me that the ritual was performed in honor of the first Matriarch Superior, Incandescent Dawn, and how rather than being burnt at the stake by a warlord's command, she instead emerged from the flames physically changed into a divine and radiant being. If there is any hope of understanding the magical mechanisms behind such a change, perhaps I will have to find an expert on the story of Incandescent Dawn."

kirin_republic.321.d:0 "Just concluded a meeting with a historian in Peace-and-Plenty by the name of Stone Slate (a fitting name for a historian if there ever was one) about the history of Matriarch Superior Incandescent Dawn and her ascension as Concord's first avatar to walk the Realm in our recorded history. Unlike Heavenly Fire, Stone Slate was a little more hesitant to talk to me, but I assured him that speaking of the past was not blasphemous, and he had nothing to fear about discussing a topic centuries old with a member of the Incarnadine Soldiery. After all, while the Way of Fire might have lost its, well, way, the Rising Fire was born from the same roots. That at least got him to calm down enough to tell me what he knew (which I'll summarize).\n\nIn 552, Peace-and-Plenty was ruled by the warlord Cinder Scales from the town that eventually became Sorghum, and was one of the last holdouts in the Realm as the Way of Fire set about unifying our ancestors through religion and philosophy rather than war and conquest. Incandescent Dawn was one of the early Vermilion Priests of the Way of Fire and, like an idiot, thought that she could get a warlord as vicious as Cinder Scales to stop his bloodletting by proselytizing at him. Lo and behold, that didn't work, and the warlord had Incandescent Dawn and her entourage tied up and burnt to show that their fire goddess couldn't protect them. Supposedly, Cinder Scales forced Incandescent Dawn to watch all her followers be consumed by the flames en masse before he cast her into the pit with their still-burning bones. To everykirin's surprise, when the flames died down, Incandescent Dawn was not only very much alive, but had been physically changed, her stature doubling in size and her physical and magical strength greatly improved. This was apparently so deeply frightening to Cinder Scales and his fellow warmongers that they fell to their haunches to beg for forgiveness, with the warlord himself pledging to build and dedicate a temple to Concord in Her honor. Thus, the Realm was united, and the first Matriarch Superior ascended.\n\nAll in all, I'm not sure how much I believe that, and it largely seems like the same story we all learned as foals. But the detail that Incandescent Dawn was cast into the pit of flames after the rest of her entourage was something new, I think. Maybe there's something to be learned there."

Perhaps what is more important is that I've deduced the reasoning why the Carmine Censorate is so interested in this information: Rising Sun wants to be a supreme matriarch more than just in title.\n\nAm I surprised by this? No. There are very few reasons why government resources would be tasked with uncovering religious secrets of our past. The applications are limited. Either one kirin or several would be subjected to the ritual, but at the end of the day, somekirin is going to attempt to ascend, and the Supreme Matriarch isn't one to share. She wants to go through the ritual, to be physically perfected like Rain Shine was decades ago, and cement her legitimacy as the Heir to the Revolution. She plans on founding a dynasty, if not outright proclaiming herself a goddess ruling in Concord's name as Her new avatar. I always suspected she had dreams of grandeur, but I didn't expect them to be this ambitious.\n\nI guess the next question is this: am I bothered by this? Also no. The Supreme Matriarch's rule is already absolute, and she just wants to make it divine as well. And as the kirin who has helped make it possible, I know I can expect ample rewards as thanks. Rising Sun's ascension wouldn't be possible without my work, and I know she'll remember that when she steps into the flames."

kirin_republic.323.t:0 "Ensign Commander Amaranth Plum: Progress Report #4"
kirin_republic.323.d:0 "At this point, I think that we have all we need to make the Supreme Matriarch's dreams a reality. After poring through many different accounts of what happened to Incandescent Dawn when she ascended, as well as the ritual that was performed when Rain Shine assumed her mother's title, we can safely do away with all of the mystic mumbo-jumbo when it comes to magically ascending a kirin. There is one important detail that is common to every single ascension story in the Realm, and that is the presence of blackened, broken kirin horns in the flames at the time the matriarch-to-be enters them.\n\nIt sounds gruesome, but it makes a level of sense. Our horns are magical, and though our magic is usually limited to simple telekinesis unlike the vast array of spells available to unicorns, they do allow us to channel the intangible and make it real. They are the channel through which we manifest the embodiment of the Last Spark of the Primordial Fire Concord bestowed in our species, drawing forth the rage that turns us into nirik just as much as they help us control that anger. And, so it seems, when a kirin horn is subjected to enough heat for enough length of time, it begins to decompose, releasing its magic back into the world around it. Normally, the products of this decomposition have very short half-lives, magically decaying within a few seconds, but that's still long enough for another kirin to, say, inhale them or let them magically bond to their horn. Additionally, they seem to have some effect on the combustion reaction, raising the ignition temperature of organic material it comes in contact with by some factor, making it difficult for flames to catch on something already burning. That, I believe, functions through the same mechanism that makes nirik fire-proof when consumed by their mindless rage.\n\nSo what does all this mean? It means that we can, in all likelihood, pinpoint the mechanism of the ascension ritual to the thermal decomposition of kirin horn, which releases magical particles that, if exposed to a kirin for a long enough duration, can physically transform her into a more magically powerful version of herself. Exposure time and temperature appear to be key in the ritual. Mess either of those up, and you've got yourself another char broiled kirin, not a new matriarch."

kirin_republic.326.t:0 "The Matriarch Usurper"
kirin_republic.326.d:0 "The Supreme Matriarch had not been seen in a week. Even the servants and officials that called the Vermilion Palace their home had not seen her. But she had to be alive. After all, somekirin ate the meals brought to her door. Somekirin issued decrees with her seal. Life went on, even if in one corner of the palace, it seemingly didn't.\n\nThen the day came when a summons was issued to every kirin of note in Vermilion. It did not merely request their presence before the Vermilion Throne, it demanded it. When the kirin arrived, they found a palace full of terrified guards of the Incarnadine Soldiery and speechless serving staff. Gossip and rumors flew among the gathered crowd until the moment they stood before the throne and saw a mare take her seat in it; when she did, silence and horror replaced them.\n\nThere was no doubt that the mare before them was Rising Sun. The color of her coat and mane, what little showed beyond voluminous crimson and black robes, was unmistakably hers, even though it was marbled with scars and burn marks. But it was obvious she was different. Her legs and neck were longer, her tail so long it could wrap around her hooves twice if she sat on all fours. Her horn towered through a black veil like a sword piercing an obsidian stone, but the magic stripes on it were crooked and jagged rather than symmetrical. And beneath the veil, her eyes burned like coals, a haunting, ethereal light seemingly glowing from her irises.\n\nAnd then she spoke. "Concord has chosen me to be the instrument of Her will in the Realm," she said, and though the words were definitely in her voice, they seemed cold and sedate, a far cry from the impassioned and fiery mare she was known as. "Through Her will, I am born anew as the Supreme Matriarch of all kirin. Now, you have a choice. Renew your loyalty before Concord and Her rightful avatar, or let your spark join Her in the Primordial Fire."\n\nThere was little hesitation among the crowd. Not a voice was raised against her, not a soul dared stand before her gaze. As one, they bowed before the Supreme Matriarch, and prayed under their breath that her ire would not scorch them where they stood."

As part of its beliefs, all kirin owe complete devotion and reverence to the Matriarch Superior, their divine leader who unites with Concord's godly divinity upon her ascension, and whose will is interpreted and executed by a Hierocracy of priests and mystics scattered throughout the Realm. Defiance of the Matriarch's decrees is considered blasphemy against Concord Herself, and so the Matriarchs of Kiria rule with absolute theocratic authority. This is useful for keeping the populace in line with the Matriarch's desires, but less useful in facilitating the expression of new ideas."

KIR_banner_system_desc:0 "When the first Matriarch Superior of Kiria, Iridescent Dawn, united Kiria under the rule of the Vermilion Dynasty and the Way of Fire, the followers under her command numbered in the hundreds of thousands. On the steps of the Imperial Palace at Vermilion, Iridescent Dawn rewarded the most loyal of her soldiers with a sacred banner bestowed with the divine blessing of Concord, before decreeing that their descendents shall continue to serve in the defence of the Kirin Realm as their forebears once did. On that day, a thousand military lineages were born, all proud sons and daughters of Kiria and Concord.\n\nBefore the Silence, there numbered a little more than five hundred Banners throughout the Realm. By then, each Banner represented an entire generation of soldiers, all part of the same clan, the largest of which possessed hundreds of family members, whilst the smallest could number as few as a dozen. By dint of the hereditary nature of their unique status, Bannerkirin were granted land to settle upon after service in the Vermilion Banner Army, where they free to raise their offspring to become the next generation of Kiria's warrior class.\n\nThe Silence had decimated both the political power and military prowess of Kiria's Banners — a long decline abruptly cessated by the breakneck modernization of the Realm. In the age of industrial warfare and technological marvels, will Kiria's Banners adapt to keep up with the times, or will Kiria's newfound modernity prove to be their coup de grâce?"

Though the surface-level essence of the old system remained—a legacy of continued armed service to Kiria, passed on from generation to generation—the Neo-Banners are organised more like private military companies, with militarised family lines of employees replacing the old guards, and instead of only warriors, the Neo-Banners' leadership consists also of  businesskirin that can manage considerable conglomerates to maintain and enhance the armies they field.\n\nTo their disparagers, the Neo-Banners are slicing up the country's military into needless factions and competitors. To their supporters, the Neo-Banners are finally leading Kiria's proud sons and daughters to a sustainable future."

KIR_pol_1_desc:0 "Autumn Blaze was never meant to rise as far as she has in her life, born the daughter to poor farmers in Massicot. Though originally destined for a life of the same hardships and meagre living as her parents, Autumn's family managed to get their daughter residence in a temple to Concord in Massicot at the age of seven, where she studied for five years before dropping out and returning to the family farm. In those five years, however, Autumn learned how to read and write, how to perform arithmetic, and perhaps most importantly of all, how to study and interpret the teachings of the fire goddess Concord in religious texts. Though she would never use that particular skill in service to The Way of Fire, Autumn made excellent use of her command over words as both a sword to attack with and a shield to defend against, allowing her to use it as a tool to carve her own path in life. Though she originally put it toward making musicals, plays, and even thought-provoking comedic dissections of the stagnation of kirin life under The Silence, it would serve her the best in 1006, when the Equestrian delegation to Kiria wandered into Massicot.\n\nBeing one of the only kirin in Massicot who knew Ponish because of her studies, Autumn was able to guide the Equestrians, two ponies named Fluttershy and Applejack, to Vermilion, where they sought to make contact with Kiria's Matriarch Superior, Rain Shine, and establish diplomatic ties. Because of her efforts, they were successful, and Autumn ultimately formed a close friendship with Rain Shine when all was said and done. That friendship led her to become Rain Shine's first premier, and now she seeks to guide the All-Kirin Plenum for National Revival as its steadfast and enthusiastic leader. Time will tell if she is successful.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! Twotail813"

KIR_pol_2:0 "Fickle Current"
KIR_pol_2_desc:0 "Despite his rise to prominence in Kiria, Fickle Current was not born a son of the Realm. Rather, he was foaled in Skyfall, where his family had fled the crushing economic collapse that struck hold of Kiria as The Silence was imposed at the beginning of the 10th century. It was there in Skyfall that the Sycee Trading House, one of the Realm's strongest trading conglomerates before The Silence, had relocated, and Current's family enjoyed close ties to the Trading House that left them extremely wealthy. With the wealth that his family possessed, Current was able to afford a prestigious education in Yale, where he was personally tutored by Cypress Snow, another member of the Kirin diaspora and its foremost literati. Under Snow's guidance, Current learned to sharpen his business acumen and cunning insight that would serve him well as a successful businesskirin and, later, the natural fit to represent the business interests of the returning kirin diaspora during the Grand Gallop Onward.\n\nIt was only late in 1006 when Fickle Current stepped hoof in Fragrance, the city of his ancestors, for the first time as The Silence began to lift across the Realm. Remembering the tales of how ineptitude and superstition in Vermilion once forced his family into exile and nearly impoverished them, Current soon resolved to be a champion for the kirin who lost everything in Fragrance and do everything he could to truly modernize Kiria according to what he and the rest of the Kirin diaspora knew in Skyfall and throughout western Griffonia. Unfettered capitalism would be the order of the day, for the wheels of progress in such a backwards land could only be turned with the grease of tremendous investment into the Realm. If Kiria ever wanted to truly join the modern world as a funcitonal nation, it would take an almost unimaginable level of investment, and so Current has resolved to do everything he can to make the nation an enticing opportunity for the wealthy.\n\n§YPortrait by:§!

KIR_pol_3_desc:0 "Born in the mountainous monastery-town of Agate, Winter Frost was surrounded with the religious and mystic fervor of The Way of Fire from the moment of her birth. As she grew older, the young kirin quickly found herself deeply infatuated with the love and divine guidance the Kirin fire goddess, Concord, had blessed her people with, and as such, Winter devoted her entire life to understanding Concord's teachings and sharing them with the rest of the kirin species. Regularly spending many dark winter mornings in mediation along the highest peaks of the holy mountain range that surrounded Vermilion, Winter Frost's devotion was soon rewarded when she was chosen to go to Vermilion and further her service to Concord by serving Matriarch Superior Rain Shine herself. As such, Winter became one of the few kirin who had personally met and interacted with the reclusive Matriarch before The Silence ended, and she became personally devoted and loyal to the Matriarch alongside her fierce devotion to The Way of Fire. Such devotion led to her becoming personally favored by the Kirin Matriarch, and by the time The Silence was officially repealed, Winter Frost was the most influential priestess in Vermilion.\n\nAs The Silence gives way to a new era of politics in Vermilion, Winter Frost has become the loudest critic of reckless modernisation and provides a solid rock to anchor the concerns of the kirin religion to, regularly pushing against motions, bills, and decrees that she believes threaten the sanctity of Concord's divine teachings. While the Plenum seeks to find new answers to the challenges of modernization, Winter Frost works to bring Kiria back to its roots of firm faith and unyielding devotion to Concord and The Way of Fire, and find the answers to Kiria's modernization problem in Concord's teachings.\n\n§YPortrait by:§!

By her own admission, Rising Sun was born in Chrysanthemum and studied to become a priestess in the Way of Fire. But even as a priestess, the mare was often regarded by her peers as too smart for her own good and twice as cunning as the most mischievous fox. She would regularly debate her senior priests about the merits and drawbacks of strictly adhering to the Matriarch Superior's decrees when all they brought about was suffering and ruin for the people of Kiria, and was regularly chastised for it. For the mare who was too smart by half for the lifestyle she had chosen, Rising Sun had reached a frustrating theological dead end to the problems surrounding Kiria.\n\nRealizing that she would never advance as a priestess in The Way of Fire, Rising Sun sailed down the Mellifluve where she ultimately ended up in Verdant at the age of 20. Once there, she quickly realized that Verdant was prospering where Chrysanthemum languished. The Silence was still in full swing over the city, but the many island communities of Verdant had formed their own cooperative communes that worked together to the benefit of all without breaking any of the Matriarch's decrees. Additionally, there was no rigid religious structure that dominated the everyday lives of the kirin in the city, only an individual communion between the average kirin and Concord, with spiritual leaders to aid their followers along toward their own revelations. Rising Sun quickly immersed herself in these beliefs, and in no time at all, had risen to the top of this new sect of The Way of Fire. Naming her sect the Rising Fire, Rising Sun would return to Chrysanthemum to spread her new teachings to the kirin of the west, and made many visits to towns and workshops around Kiria before ultimately ending up in Vermilion as the Grand Gallop Onward progressed to bring her teachings to a new level of national awareness.\n\n§YPortrait by:§!

Cypress hails from the lineage of the All-Kiria Artificers' Guild, and was tutored from a young age with the best scholars that money could buy, both within Griffonia and from Equestria overseas. His sharp mind and great ambition led to him pursuing several doctorates at both Griffonian and Equestrian universities, and he would eventually move to Yale and serve as a professor and mentor for countless members of the kirin diaspora that sought the best education they could afford. In each of them, Cypress instilled a sense of pride and superiority that they were the lucky kirin to escape the wasteful devastation that The Silence had imposed on their ancestral homeland, and they were better for it. And furthermore, he assured them that one day, perhaps, they would return to Kiria and remodel it in their own image, that of the enlightened kirin who had shed the superstitions of the kirin theocracy to modernize like the rest of the world.\n\nNow Cypress Snow has returned to Kiria at the behest of his former protege, Fickle Current, to help recruit kirin from the diaspora and urge them to return to Kiria. Working closely with Current, Cypress makes sure that the whims and wishes of the diaspora are presented to its de facto leader for consideration, and aids in keeping them in line behind Current's policies.

Born as a poor fishermare in Nacre on the pirate-controlled Auburn Isle, Roaring Fire joined her first pirating expedition at the age of 11 and never looked back. As she gained experience, so too did she gain respect from pirates all over the Isle for her fearless bravado and sharp mind. By the time she turned 19 she was captain of her own ship, and through clever diplomacy and cunning intrigue she began to amass a coalition of pirates and assembled a small flotilla. It was with this flotilla that, on one fateful night in 997, she lured the previous de facto pirate leader of the Auburn Isle and his ship out of his cove and beset upon him with a ferocity pirates still talk about in Nacre today. While cannonfire ripped through the wooden hulls of both junks, Roaring Fire swung off a rope and launched herself onto the enemy ship, where in a brutal display of blood and death, she cut through pirate after pirate until finally finding and besting the enemy captain. When she returned to Nacre the following morning with that pirate in chains, she cemented her legend and earned the loyalty of the brigands and buccaneers that called Auburn Isle home.\n\nThanks to her cunning, the pirates of the Auburn Isle have managed to survive into a new age. After successfully negotiating with Fickle Current to join his forces with her pirate armada serving as a mercenary navy, Roaring Fire spared her home from destruction by a resurgent Realm of Kiria and saved her pirates from the gallows. Now, standing at the forefront of a brave new world, the pirates of the Auburn Isle are firmly devoted to their pirate queen, and Roaring Fire is determined to not let them down.\n\n§YPortrait by:§!

Trained from childhood in the ways of the bannerkirin warrior, Ember Wane succeeded his mother to become Commander of the Banner in his mid-forties and at the peak of his prime, having led his fellow bannerkirin all over Kiria on many a campaign to quash those recusants and heretics who dared break the Silence.

Their mission to uphold Noctilucent Charm's final decree concluded, the Covered Cage and its Commander now seek a new purpose — to serve Rain Shine's new regime any way they can. But will the rest of Kiria be as accepting of their service? Those who have seen Ember Wane's many scars speculate on their origins: some say he got them while fighting off pirates in the defence of a fisherkirin village. Others claim that he got his scars from the eradication of the Sunrise Sect, whose clockwork golems and steam howitzers failed to prevent the Covered Cage from massacring all the inhabitants of Sunrise.

As a foal, he expressed a desire to be a mystic just like his great-grandfather who immigrated to Equestria, though opportunities to serve Concord in more than just lip service and benevolent living were few and far between in pony land. He would soon enroll in the School of Friendship in the late 1000s, a hub for creatures of all kinds to interact with and to learn from one another.\n\nHowever, in Princess Celestia and what her little ponies espoused and acted out, Mahogany would find a new interpretation of Concord. Unlike with what Noctilucent Charm taught, the Equestrian embrace of modernisation had the principles of harmony baked in. Hierarchies and classes were not to be antagonized or removed entirely; rather, they presented new opportunities for co-operation and a great lifting up of every pony—and creature. To hear Equestrian heart songs take over factories and offices, and of those with much supporting those without, was a miracle to Mahogany that only Concord could've pulled off.\n\nBut while he had intended to return to Kiria to begin his mystic journey upon hearing of The Silence's end (dismissing the jokes from friends on how he resembled Matriarch Superior Rain Shine), the civil war fast-tracked his plans.

The diaspora flooded into the city of their ancestors, and many returnee shipwrights pooled together their knowledge and capital to rebuild Fragrance's ruined shipyards and render them operational. Combining domestic craftsmareship and foreign innovation, the shipyards of Fragrance function once more.\n\nWhile Vermilion generously subsidizes the Fragrance shipyards, the Matriarchate has never formally apologized for the devastation of Fragrance."

KIR_sycee_trading_house_desc:0 "The port of Sycee in the Comely Cape houses the waterfront headquarters of the Sycee Trading House, one of the oldest merchant banks in all of Eastern Zebrica. After the beginning of the Silence, the Trading House's merchant-directors took their business abroad and continued to make their fortunes away from their homeland. A century of consistently-prudent investment and diversification in Griffonia and Equus have brought them wealth beyond our dreams, and now they are ready to make a small portion of that wealth available to us. Returning home, Sycee has become one of the chief corporate supporters of the National Association of Kirin Patriots and their modernizing and pro-corporatist policies, while always maintaining their classic openness to anyone that they can make money from."

KIR_motor_bureau:0 "Motor Bureau"

Recognising the need to alleviate this problem before a major war would cripple them beforehoof, Premier Autumn Blaze established the Motor Bureau.\n\nThe bureau itself is a potpourri of researchers studying automobiles for military applications, investors willing to shell out the money to see dozens of kirin-made prototypes adjusted amid a hundred trials, and Equestrian advisors bonding with the above two in the field of civil service.\n\nWhile this brainchild of the Premier shouldn't work on paper, the principles of harmony ensure that this rather decentralised organisation produces results under gladsome working conditions."

KIR_sorghum_foundry:0 "Sorghum Foundry"
KIR_sorghum_foundry_desc:0 "The infamous Sorghum Foundry exemplifies a core trend in Kirian history, that being the constant tension between modernisation and the pressures thereof. Founded before the Silence by an enterprising Bannerkirin who foresaw the inevitability of modernization, the Foundry stoked its first furnaces in the city of Sorghum, importing raw iron from the Peaks of Peril and the mountain ranges of the north to process into steel. Just prior to the enactment of the Silence, Sorghum had begun to look like a truly modern city of the time, with new structures of brick and steel being erected in its industrial districts.\n\nAs the provincial capital of the rural-agricultural Great Mellifluve Delta region, Sorghum occupies a perfect geographical position for labour-intensive industrial production, with its factories presenting a chance for famers from the rural periphery to earn relatively high wages as urban workers."

KIR_artificer_guild_desc:0 "Founded sometime during the 8th Century, the All-Kiria Artificers' Guild has long been the vanguard of scientific and technological innovation in Kiria and Eastern Zebrica; the Guild's prolific experimentation with steam and clockwork mechanics in last decade of the 9th Century were the dominant driving force behind the rapid modernisation of contemporary Kiria.\n\nThe Guild had fiercely resisted the Silence, withdrawing to their strongholds at Massicot and Fragrance and seceding from the Realm. The devastation of Fragrance in the aftermath of a punitive expedition by the last remnants of organised Imperial forces led to the exodus of the surviving members to Griffonia, where the Guild would endure a century in bitter exile.\n\nThe post-Silence generation of the Guild's leadership-in-exile kept abreast of the latest technological developments in Griffonia, with some even having taken up teaching positions at the prestigious universities of Yale."

KIR_wingluck_consortium:0 "Wingluck Consortium"
KIR_wingluck_consortium_desc:0 "The Wingluck Consortium is unique among Kirian corporations in that it is not actually from Kiria. The founders of the Consortium, a griffon named Sevac Sembavat and her pegasus wife Starfruit, were from New Mareland, and immigrated to Kiria following the lifting of the Silence. The two of them were fascinated with the natural ability of flight, and sought to replicate it on an industrial scale. Securing a loan from the businesspony Gladmane, they began work on plans for large commercial airliners before being contracted by the New Mareland government for military aircraft design. However the two of them were never a couple to simply be content with what they had in life, and when they saw the chance to expand into the virgin markets of Kiria, they took the risk. In an agreement with the Sycee Trading House, they settled their debt to Gladmane and moved all their operations to the North Kirian region of Greater Providence. Their pioneering designs were heavily patronized by rich kirin who have long wished to sail the skies, as well as forward-looking Bannerkirin commanders who see promise in such "Flying Fortresses"."

KIR_armour_bureau:0 "Armor Bureau"
KIR_armour_bureau_desc:0 "Scales have always been a kirin's natural armour, lightweight yet unflinching against arrows and bullets, but for millennia, blacksmiths and tacticians have striven to figure out how to extend this piece of Concord's creation to the rest of the body without sacrificing mobility (apart from the rare practice of harvesting scales from dead soldiers to augment one's own).\n\nThe age-old challenge was answered in Equus with the invention of the tank, but until 1007, there'd been a paucity of minds and muscles willing to circumvent The Silence, leaving Kiria to start from scratch.\n\nThis much newer challenge, however, has been answered by a creation of Premier Autumn Blaze, the Armor Bureau, a committee of creatures knowledgeable in tanks and of kirin designers and consultants sought after to funnel in these international ideas into kirin-specific contexts and hypothetical Kirian battlefields."

KIR_collegium:0 "All-Kiria Collegium"
KIR_collegium_desc:0 "Without brilliant minds at work, Kiria can never enter the modern age, and the All-Kiria Collegium is the gathering of those minds. Created in an attempt to bolster Kiria's intellectual might, the Collegium acts as a mix between a university and a general research institute, working constantly to advance Kirian science beyond the bounds it was confined to during the Silence. The faculty at the Collegium is made up primarily of diaspora Kirin from Equus and Griffonia, augmented by domestic researchers and other foreigners given jobs as professors or visiting fellows. This diverse cast of characters means that the Collegium is a hub of foreign ideas, often drawing the ire of the Way of Fire. Like many of Kiria's other modern institutions, the Collegium is heavily influenced by the National Association of Kirin Patriots though one of their chief theorists, Cypress Snow, who serves as both a professor of Classical Literature and the president of the university. However, the Collegium's role in modernizing Kiria must be valued above its ties to the NAKP, lest Kiria be lost in the ashes of the past."

KIR_massicot_academy:0 "Massicot War School"
KIR_massicot_academy_desc:0 "Before the Silence, before even Iridescent Dawn set hoof on the land not yet known as Kiria, there was war. The Kirin, so vulnerable to the whims of their emotions, were perhaps more than most swept up by the bloody revels of warfare. Upon the shores of the Great Mellifluve, those ancient folk trained their children in the art of combat, where the finest of those who would fight for their city-state came in as children and came out as warriors. It is said that recruits were forced to jump into the frigid waters in winter as an initiation ritual. Those young foals would either drag themselves out by their hooves or be dragged to the icy depths, only to leave as corpses.\n\nAs Kiria united and time progressed, this ancient training ground became a fully-fledged academy that forged the youth of Kiria into the finest blades of the Matriarch Superior. Those bannerkirin who could call themselves graduates of Massicot provoked envy and admiration alike, right up until the decrees of Noctilucent Charm. The Silence left the School a glorified museum, patiently waiting for the day of its resurrection, where its hallowed halls may be filled with the disciples of bloodshed once more."

KIR_cog_plow_bull_co:0 "Taurus Concerns"
KIR_cog_plow_bull_co_desc:0 "The Taurus Concerns is a new player in the Kirian industrial game, first registered as a company in Skyfall in 998 by Ardent Bloom and his sister: Zenith Bloom, Matriarch-Commander of the Banner of the Starred Taurus. A modern industrial conglomerate, the Concern has bought up factories and mines across Kiria to manufacture both modern industrial products such as automobiles and tractors, as well as weapons of war. While questions have been asked about the Concern's treatment of workers, its leadership's drive for Kiria's modernization and industrialization cannot be ignored.\n\nWorth nothing is the Concern's close ties to the National Association of Kirin Patriots. Ardent Bloom is chief economist of the NAKP, and Zenith Bloom makes no secret of her personal involvement in the less-than-savoury activities of the Order of the Iron Chrysanthemum — the NAKP's paramilitary organisation and, as some allege, smuggling network. But politics aside, Taurus has shown an interest in developing native Kirian tanks and armor, as long as they get to be the ones to manufacture it."

KIR_crane_heavy_industries:0 "Crane Heavy Industries"
KIR_crane_heavy_industries_desc:0 "The commercial venture that represents Crane Heavy Industries most prominently in the public eye is their light aircraft production operations, for which Crane has won numerous procurement contracts with the Vermilion government. Crane alternates between coy courtship and fierce commercial competition with the National Association of Kirin Patriots over its private modernization initiatives — a tense, capricious, and mercurial relationship that the Kirian commentariat love to hate.\n\nCrane cares little for the temporal affairs of the Realm, save for those that concern its most modern and commercially-promising venture, Crane Aircraft. But if one were to strike at this one limb of Crane, the whole beast may soon come knocking."

KIR_dreamboat:0 "Dreamboat International"
KIR_dreamboat_desc:0 "The Dreamboat name is on the lips of every trader, captain, freight forwarder, and harbourmaster in all the ports of Zebrica, Griffonia, and Equus. Shipments from Dreamboat do not arrive very often, but when they do, everycreature hears about it.\n\nMany clients contract Dreamboat for shipments that need to sail through the South Kirin Sea, to ensure that their cargo is protected from pirates by the best sailors money can buy. Dreamboat's rivalry with Scarlet Sails Shipping is the shipping industry's worst-kept secret; indeed, stories of thrilling skirmishes at sea between Dreamboat mariners and the pirate scoundrels of Auburn Isle have become the stuff of maritime legend, and do much to burnish Dreamboat's brand image. Allegations of collusion with Scarlet Sails Shipping, their seemingly pirate-immune navy, and their dubious ties with Pirate Queen Roaring Fire are wholly unfounded."

KIR_scarlet_sails_shipyards:0 "Scarlet Sails Shipping"
KIR_scarlet_sails_shipyards_desc:0"Even more so than most corporations in Kiria, Scarlet Sails Shipping is not what it seems. On paper, the company was founded during the Silence, with its headquarters in the small coastal village of Jasmine, and has experienced unusually stable and consistent growth since. Scarlet Sails Shipping, known colloquially as "The Triple-S Syndicate", specializes in shipping and logistics operations throughout the South Kirin Sea and the Sea of Hope, with branch offices in Sen Kinh and the Zebrides and lesser presences in other ports."

KIR_aureolin_monastery:0 "Aureolin Monastery"
KIR_aureolin_monastery_desc:0 "If certain accounts are true, the Aureolin Monastery, which is currently situated deep in Kiria's western reaches, was received, not built, by its founder Aureolin pre-written history. She had pondered deeply upon Concord's paradox that is the kirin and her nirik state, but upon reaching the height of revelation, she had burst into flames without descending into feral wrath. For this blessing upon kirinity, Concord gave her a towering temple—the world's first monastery—as both a gift and a responsibility to all future generations.\n\nThus the legendary lineage of nirik warrior-monk Valiants—and to a painstaking extent, the more recent Vanguards—was born, continuing to this day as among the first places aspiring kirin monks travel to in search of inner truths as well as physical mastery through martial arts.\n\nUnder the Children of Concord, the monastery has served as a major hub of propagating Trinitarianism, believing that the Valiant is not a balance between two kirin-nirik entities but is itself a third entity."

KIR_divine_mechanisms:0 "Divine Mechanisms"
KIR_divine_mechanisms_desc:0 "Though for the sake of simplification sometimes referred to as a single organisation, Divine Mechanisms are better described as province-wide vocational communes that have co-opted modern technology into their calling, which is unlike the Griffonian stereotype of old-fashioned guilds single-hoofedly steering the course of an entire occupation.\n\nWhile the organisation of a provincial Divine Mechanism varies from village to village, a more common structure is based on the internationally familiar model of apprenticeship, though emphasis is put on how an apprentice is set to become a master of their hometown's version of the craft, not the general craft itself, creating room for vocational exchange as masters visit each other and share insights and quite literal tools of the trade.\n\nOf note is Kiria's industrialisation playing a key role in Divine Mechanisms. While Griffonian and even several Equestrian guilds diminished in the wake of their own industrial revolutions, the Divine Mechanisms and their own "guilds" have instead flourished by welcoming scientific advances into their craft, with a common saying being roughly translated as "A metal blade, I have made; a metal blade and its own family, my son has made." Craftskirin are expected to learn how to maintain their own home-sized factories, while new vocations as well as types of Mechanisms have risen to encompass the fields of research, construction, and early electronics."

Endowed with modern shipbuilding knowledge and shared ownership over former NAKP dockyards, they created the Maritime Systems of the Divine Mechanisms, micro-societies that gather in individual dockyards to improve upon NAKP designs with input from everyone, even the aged fisherkirin by the docks."

Given the massive undertaking that building an airplane is, these communes nurture close relations with each other, particularly with how they consolidate airplane production within the hangar as much as possible.\n\nA consequence of the Divine Mechanisms' beliefs and structure is that airplane-craftskirin are also expected to pilot the planes themselves. Understandably, not all communes follow this rigidly, given a fear of heights, among others."

However, some errant villages refuse the edict to enforce the scorched earth policy, intransigently disobeying our orders to burn their dwellings and fields after they have fled. In some cases, they have even returned to their homes after the the Incarnadine Soldiery have retreated. The Matriarch-Protector's word is law, and as such it must be upheld without exception, and transgressors punished. The kirin of the town of Wheatchaff, in the path of the advancing Vermilion Banners, have obstinately refused to adhere to the scorched earth policy. Thus, the unpleasant and thankless task of doing so falls unto us."

Be they lunatics, doomsayers, prophets, or the genuinely concerned, such creatures weave tales of grandeur and sacrifice, of fervent hope and insurmountable dread, of butchery and plague. They wield fear with as much grace as any swordsmare, whipping those who hear their stories into a frenzy of anxiety and defiance, only to inevitably be disproved by the jeering mundanity of Fate.\nNow, it is widely agreed, we have far surpassed any apocalypse ever conceived.\nMillenia of progress have been immolated in smoke, trampled by the weight of those fateful mistakes and the hubris of a race which dared to believe it could move past itself to become something better. Such dreams are but nostalgia now, idle trivialities to be contemplated by the few kirin who yet remain sane in this cataclysmic hellscape. Nirik in the thousands fight and kill and die, but do not live, doomed to be slaves to the grim will of Rage. Optimism lays dead, sacrificed on the altar of Despair. All that is left for those hapless few whose hope has not been consumed by the inferno is to pray for deliverance, most likely in the form of another major power intervening for fear of the nirik threat fulminating outwards.\nPray to whom? No one knows. Even Concord no longer holds vigil over the Realm of Shattered Hope, Tartarus Incarnate on earth."

KIR_GREAT_LEAP_DECISION_TITLE_3_FOCUS:0 "Radiant Prosperity"
KIR_GREAT_LEAP_DECISION_TITLE_2_FOCUS_DESC:0 "Kiria stood united against the Northern Secession, and defeated the treacherous NAKP to restore the north to the fold. It is time to move on from the scars of the civil war and resume the program of modernisation and liberalisation, guided by the ideals of harmony and justice that the kirin people fought so hard to preserve."
KIR_GREAT_LEAP_DECISION_TITLE_3_FOCUS_DESC:0 "The Grand Gallop Onward has succeeded against all odds. Premier Autumn Blaze has achieved in a few short years a century's worth of industrial and technological progress lost to the Silence. It's time to officially announce the beginning of a new era for a new Kiria: the Era of Radiant Prosperity!"
KIR_GREAT_LEAP_DECISION_DESC_A1:0 "The brainchild of Imperial Premier §YAutumn Blaze§!, the §YThree-and-a-Half Year Plan§!, recognised as a ferociously ambitious course of action even by its most dedicated proponents, seeks to make up for a century's worth of lost progress and transform"
KIR_GREAT_LEAP_DECISION_DESC_B1:0 "the §YRealm of Kiria§! into an industrialized nation by the end of Year 1011. The Plan is the cornerstone of the §YAll-Kiria Plenum for National Revival§!, an assemblage of Kiria's best and brightest summoned to Vermilion, at the behest of Matriarch Superior §YRain Shine§!, to guide the Realm out of the §RSilence§! and into the modern era. Supported by Kiria's friends in Equestria, funded by the wealth of the returning Kirin diaspora, fueled by the resurgent flames of Kirin patriotism and driven by the indomitable will of the Kirin people, Premier Autumn Blaze believes that the Plan can succeed — but only if the Plenum learns to work together, in spite of their ideological differences, towards their shared goal of a strong, independent, and modernized Kiria."
KIR_GREAT_LEAP_DECISION_DESC_A2:0 "The collapse of the §Y3½ Year Plan§! shattered the last vestiges of the §RSilence§! in a single stroke as §YNorth Kiria§!, led by the §RNational Association of Kirin Patriots§!, seceded from the Realm. As civil war raged, the Grand Gallop Onward was brought"
KIR_GREAT_LEAP_DECISION_DESC_B2:0 "to a standstill. Kiria rallied behind the Triumvirate of §PAutumn Blaze§!, §CWinter Frost§! and §ORising Sun§!, and in the end §PHarmony§! prevailed.\n\nDespite such a setback, the millennium is still young, and the Triumvirate's lofty vision of a §CKirian nation§! united under the aegis of the revived §OVermilion Dynasty§! may well gain traction amongst the kirin galvanised by their recent §Gtriumph§! over disharmony. As the Grand Gallop Onward resumes, Kiria's diverse array of ideological tendencies must cooperate and compromise to heal the scars of the §RNorthern Secession§! and to realise the dream of a §Gstrong and prosperous Kiria§!."
KIR_GREAT_LEAP_DECISION_DESC_A3:0 "The success of Imperial Premier Autumn Blaze's §Y3½ Year Plan§! has abolished the last vestiges of the §RSilence§! in the Realm, setting Kiria on the path to becoming a modernized industrial nation. The All-Kiria Plenum for National Revival has matured"
KIR_GREAT_LEAP_DECISION_DESC_B3:0 "from a shiftless gaggle of bickering demagogues into a forum of Kiria's most capable stateskirin and scholar-officials, united by a common purpose — to see the Realm §Cstrong and prosperous§!, emerging from the Silence to assert Kiria's place on the world stage. The millennium is still young, and the Plenum's lofty vision of an Eastern Zebrica united under the aegis of the ascendant §ORealm of Kiria§! may well gain traction amongst the kirin galvanised by their nation's meteoric rise.\nAs the Grand Gallop Onward progresses, and as the Reform Bureau, the Morning Secretariat, and the Plenum all find themselves fonts of power in a rapidly centralizing nation-state, Kiria's diverse array of ideological tendencies must cooperate and compromise to realise the dream of a §Gstrong and prosperous Kiria§!."

KIR_three_and_half_year_plan_desc:0 "We have succeeded what many once thought impossible. Matriarch Superior Rain Shine's ambitious plan has become a reality thanks to Premier Autumn Blaze's endless dedication to the Grand Gallop Onward. Because of their efforts, the 11th century will be a truly wonderful century for the Realm of Kiria."
KIR_crisis_1_mission:0 "The Poisoning of the Mellifluve"
KIR_crisis_1_mission_desc:0 "The Lifeblood of Kiria, the Great Mellifluve is the river that brings life to our beautiful realm and facilitates trade throughout its fertile valleys and lush forests. But while the Great Mellifluve gives us life, we are inadvertently killing it. Our modernisation projects have resulted in factories dumping toxic chemicals into the rivers to mingle with fertilizer runoff and sewage from our growing cities. If the Great Mellifluve dies, then Kiria dies; there is no time to waste in finding a solution."
KIR_crisis_2_mission:0 "In the Wake of Cyclonic Fury"
KIR_crisis_2_mission_desc:0 "A terrible cyclone has decimated the eastern coast of the realm, leaving terrible destruction and misery in its wake. If we are to repair the damage, we will have to coordinate efforts between our government's resources and call upon the returning kirin diaspora for donations and funding to fuel our efforts. We cannot let our people languish in devastation if we want to earn their respect and loyalty, so there is no time to waste!"
KIR_crisis_3_mission:0 "The Crisis of Bread and Rice"
KIR_crisis_3_mission_desc:0 "Our exploding population and the movement of kirin away from the subsistence farms filling the countryside and into our reopening cities has created a dire crisis in our food supply. Cities are emptying their granaries much faster than anticipated, and old farming techniques are insufficient in providing enough food to keep the cities from starving. We must find a solution to this crisis and encourage our fellow kirin to give everything they can afford to see us through this next dreadful winter."
KIR_crisis_4_mission:0 "The Incendiaries' Movement"
KIR_crisis_4_mission_desc:0 "The Incendiaries are a group of kirin peasants and farmers who are loosely affiliated with the Rising Fire heresy of our religion, and they have decided to express their frustration and disillusionment with the Grand Gallop Onward by striking out at our modernisation projects. They must be dealt with one way or another, lest their movement spiral out of control and further hamper our efforts to modernize our countryside."
KIR_crisis_5_mission:0 "Banditry in the West"
KIR_crisis_5_mission_desc:0 "Bandits have long been a problem in the more rural and unsettled lands in the west of our Realm, but throughout the period of modernisation, they have grown ever more troublesome. Caravans and convoys bringing much needed supplies and goods to the west are frequently attacked by bandits, and we simply must do something about them before they jeopardize our ongoing modernisation efforts in the backwaters of the Realm!"
KIR_western_infra:0 "Restore Western Roads"
KIR_western_infra_desc:0 "The many roads that meandered through our great realm have decayed through a century of neglect and become overgrown with vegetation. Let us lay new and modern roads to reconnect our provinces together and further the great task of modernising our country."

KIR_finish_railway:0 "Complete the Vermilion Radiance Line"
KIR_finish_railway_desc:0 "Following the lifting of the Silence over Kiria, Equestrian investment into the Realm's modernisation slowly grew. The influx of Equestrian venture capital and generous donations from the Kirian diaspora in Equestria culminated in the construction of the Vermilion Radiance Line, a railway — the first in Kiria — to connect the capital of the Realm to the port city of Radiance, historically known as the Vermilion Gateway. However, cost overruns and the technical difficulty of carving a path through the dense and hilly Sakura Forest meant that this venture stalled. Already, a railroad unravels from modern neo-Pegasopolian train termini in the hearts of Vermilion and Radiance both, only to end abruptly at the fringes of the Sakura Forest. A little bit of political pressure will breathe new life into the venture — to carve a path through the forest and connect the capital to the sea."
KIR_northern_infra:0 "Restore Northern Roads"
KIR_northern_infra_desc:0 "The many roads that meandered through our great realm have decayed through a century of neglect and become overgrown with vegetation. Let us lay new and modern roads to reconnect our provinces together and further the great task of modernising our country."
KIR_western_rail:0 "Build the Western Railways"
KIR_western_rail_desc:0 "Railroads will allow us to ship resources from their natural desposits to factories where they can be exported or turned into finished goods, and bring goods and kirin back to our hinterlands to further their development. The creation of railroads criss-crossing our great realm will bring Kiria together like never before."
KIR_central_rail:0 "Build the Central Railways"
KIR_central_rail_desc:0 "Railroads will allow us to ship resources from their natural desposits to factories where they can be exported or turned into finished goods, and bring goods and kirin back to our hinterlands to further their development.

The creation of railroads criss-crossing our great realm will bring Kiria together like never before."
KIR_investigate_incendiaries_decision:0 "Investigate the Incendiaries"
KIR_investigate_incendiaries_decision_desc:0 "Matriarch Superior Rain Shine wants us to investigate the Incendiaries before we decide how best to deal with them. A report on their activities in the Realm will be compiled and delivered to the Imperial Premier so she can bring forth a recommendation to Rain Shine."
KIR_stab_decision_A:0 "Accept Petitioners"
KIR_stab_decision_A_desc:0 "Throughout The Silence, the Vermilion Court had been closed to the kirin of the Realm, and the kirin who could claim they had seen the Matriarch Superior in the flesh numbered only in the dozens. With The Silence ending, Matriarch Superior Rain Shine has decided to regularly schedule 70 days of open court where petitioners could see her and make their voices heard. The mere act of seeing Kiria's divine ruler and allowing her to hear their problems has greatly restored the faith of our people in the intentions of the Matriarch and her belief in the success of the Grand Gallop Onward."
KIR_stab_decision_B:0 "Reply to Letters"
KIR_stab_decision_B_desc:0 "While not everykirin can venture to Vermilion to see Matriarch Superior Rain Shine personally, establishing the Office of Transmission has created a way for concerned kirin throughout the Realm to send letters to the Matriarch's court that are then presented to her. In this way, even kirin at the fringes of our realm can feel like their voices are personally heard by the Matriarch, and in turn, Concord Herself."
KIR_stab_decision_1:0 "Bolster the Way of Fire"
KIR_stab_decision_1_desc:0 "Centuries ago, The Way of Fire unified the kirin people in a way no warlord or diplomat had ever achieved before. Our faith in Concord and her divine avatar, the Matriarch Superior, allows us to come together as a peaceful nation and reject the violent urges of the nirik state. In these frightening new times, however, faith in The Way of Fire is fading, especially after the harsh stagnation of The Silence. We must take every effort to reconnect the common kirin throughout the Realm with the teachings and tenets of The Way of Fire if we are to maintain peace and stability in our realm.\n\n§WThe £pol_power §YPolitical Power§! cost of £decision_icon_small §YBolster the Way of Fire§! will increase by §R+25%§! for each time the decision is taken.§!"
KIR_stab_decision_2:0 "Arts and Culture Campaign"
KIR_stab_decision_2_desc:0 "The greatest way to connect with our fellow kirin, to allow new ideas to be spread, and to express our cultural identity as a unifying force is through an arts and culture campaign. Fairs, exhibits, tours, and all sorts of means of bringing kirin together will be directly organized and funded by the government in Vermilion in the hopes of stabilizing the nation and smoothing over any rough patches during modernisation.\n\n§WThe £pol_power §YPolitical Power§! cost of £decision_icon_small §YArts and Culture Campaign§! will increase by §R+25%§! for each time the decision is taken.§!"
KIR_stab_decision_3:0 "Bureaucratic Bottleneck"
KIR_stab_decision_3_desc:0 "The bickering factions and cliques in the Morning Secretariat have greatly hampered the implementation of the Grand Gallop Onward according to Premier Autumn Blaze's vision. Using our allies in the Reform Bureau, we shall temporarily frustrate efforts from competing parties to derail her agenda, allowing the Premier to force through important legislation that will aid in stabilizing the nation.\n\n§WThe £pol_power §YPolitical Power§! cost of £decision_icon_small §YBureaucratic Bottleneck§! will increase by §R+50%§! for each time the decision is taken.§!"
KIR_stab_decision_4:0 "Celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival"
KIR_stab_decision_4_desc:0 "The mid-autumn festival is one of the most important festivals in all of the Realm, marking a time to celebrate a successful harvest and prepare for the dry season. Granting holidays to our hardworking kirin throughout the Realm will greatly bolster spirits and allow everykirin to return to work following the festival refreshed and committed to creating a new and better Kiria of tomorrow."
KIR_mil_decision_1:0 "Recruits for a Banner"
KIR_mil_decision_1_desc:0 "Many villages and towns do not yet contribute to a banner of their own. Efforts will be made—from traditional inter-city banner parades to present-day recruitment centers inspired by those in Equus and Griffonia—to spur sentiments of pooling one's passion, soul, and own fire into the defence of home and country, with the promise of a landed life and legacy.\n\n§WThe £pol_power §YPolitical Power§! cost of £decision_icon_small §YRecruits for a Banner§! will increase by §R+25%§! for each time the decision is taken.§!"
KIR_mil_decision_2:0 "Purchase Equestrian Guns"
KIR_mil_decision_2_desc:0 "The kirin are many, but their rifles are few. With Kiria still unable to churn out enough for their banners and more, another option lies open to us: ordering guns from the government and corporations of our friends in Equestria, in exchange for a hefty sum.\n\n§WThe £pol_power §YPolitical Power§! cost of £decision_icon_small §YPurchase Equestrian Guns§! will increase by §R+25%§! for each time the decision is taken.§!"
KIR_mil_decision_3:0 "Request Equestrian Surplus"
KIR_mil_decision_3_desc:0 "The Equestrian Lilia-Rifle is an old model, but for our plenteous warriors who have rarely seen modern-day guns up close, it is more than sufficient. Asking Equestria to send a shipment of surplus Lilias our way will stave off any interruptions in our modern army training.\n\n§WThe £pol_power §YPolitical Power§! cost of £decision_icon_small §YRequest Equestrian Surplus§! will increase by §R+20%§! for each time the decision is taken.§!"
KIR_mil_decision_4:0 "Form the Foreign Military Mission Corps"
KIR_mil_decision_4_desc:0 "The Vermilion Army is woefully outdated. Our military doctrine is stuck in the last millennium. The Realm's bannerkirin need to gain an understanding of how military campaigns are waged in an age of mechanised and industrial warfare. Forming the §YForeign Military Mission Corps§!, which will organise all-volunteer expeditionary forces to fight abroad, will help us adapt to the new realities of war.\n\nTo this end, some pieces of modern Equestrian equipment will be purchased to outfit these expeditionary forces. Only the best will do for Kiria's martial representatives abroad."
KIR_mil_decision_4_tt:0 "Increases Army Experience Gain by §G+25%§!.\nIncreases the number of Divisions we can send as Volunteer Forces by §G+5§!.\n"
KIR_Send_Extra_Volunteers_Idea:0 "Foreign Military Mission Corps"

KIR_support_decision_1:0 "Kirin Warfare Research Scheme"
KIR_support_decision_1_desc:0 "From the Silence are lifted ancient texts on the nature of warfare as well as Kiria's lengthy annals of its own struggles. Coupled with the advent of 11th-century tactics and ideas from around the world, our finest strategists will adopt the practice of wargames to determine what a kirin soldier can do in these new days."
KIR_support_decision_2:0 "Infantry Support Research Scheme"
KIR_support_decision_2_desc:0 "Before a kirin can fight the enemy, they should take care of many things beforehoof: How will the battlefield be reached? Where is the enemy and how strong are they? How will the kirin's supplies and reinforcements be carried to them and how fast? These and more must be tackled, though the idea of "support companies" is gaining much traction..."
KIR_support_decision_3:0 "Artillery Research Scheme"
KIR_support_decision_3_desc:0 "The kirin has had an affinity for black- and firepowder, tending to their love for explosions in civilian fireworks. Thus, when they learned of what essentially were glorified rifles the size of entire houses, various organisations and guilds put forth plans to fashion the artillery of other countries with the expertise of pyrotechnics. This had been ignored during the Silence, but with the the 3½ Year Plan under way, it is time to let them present their ideas to the military and see what will become our own modern-day cannons."
KIR_support_decision_4:0 "Special Forces Research Scheme"
KIR_support_decision_4_desc:0 "From before Kiria's unification sprawl legends of kirin warriors who can fend off a thousand foes with a single sword, an hours-long nirik state, or their own bare hooves. But what if they become a reality for today, and in enough numbers to bolster dozens of regiments? Mustering up special forces units for Kiria will, on top of granting our army flexibility and unusual capabilities, surely spawn proud, living tales of heroism."
KIR_support_decision_5:0 "Kirin Valiants Research Scheme"
KIR_support_decision_5_desc:0 "Taking on vows of discipline and self-mastery, Valiants are elite warrior monks who utilise their nirik forms without losing themselves in feral wrath. They, too, must not be left behind in the wake of the future, when the soldiers they shall fight with carry not blades but bullets. Training our Valiants in these new ways will bless the winds of battle with a dreadful blaze against our foes."
KIR_matriarch_superior_tour:0 "The Matriarch Superior's Tour"
KIR_matriarch_superior_tour_desc:0 "There are only two things that all kirin throughout the Realm universally respect and adore: Concord, and Her avatar on this earth, the Matriarch Superior. Even still, most kirin in our lands have never seen the Matriarch before, and many may feel that their worries and concerns are unknown to her. By bringing Rain Shine on tour throughout the Realm, we can stabilize the country by affording the common kirin the chance to meet Concord's divine avatar and realize that she does indeed care greatly for them."
KIR_EQS_factories_deal:0 "Extend the Hyacinth Accord"
KIR_EQS_factories_deal_desc:0 "The Hyacinth Accord was an important first deal with a foreign nation after a century of isolation and stagnation. Equestria's support in providing the foundation for our modernisation efforts has been invaluable. But now, with our modernisation efforts well underway, we must decide whether to continue with Equestria's support or forge our own path free of any strings tying us to a foreign economy."
KIR_complete_modernisation_decision:0 "Declare the Triumph of Modernisation"
KIR_complete_modernisation_decision_desc:0 "It had been an arduous task taken delicately at breakneck speeds, but against all odds, the kirin have stepped out of The Silence with their heads held high.

While their countrymares may call them sellouts, these collaborators defend their new liege with vigor and professionalism.\n\nIf you are in the Kirian military or colonial bureaucracy, and are assigned to a posting in Zaikiria, it means one of two things. Either you have done so well in your previous assignment that you have been given a stable, calm posting as a reward for everything you have done, or you are so mind-numbingly incompetent, but not quite enough to be fired, that you need to be put somewhere that you cannot possibly mess up your job. This is because Zaikiria nearly runs itself. The population are kirin, almost all are adherants of the Way of Fire, and there are legions of local leaders willing to work with the Commandery administration in one way or another.

The reasoning for this was not clear, until a Crane Industries headquarters opened in the capital city.\n\nCrane has turned Taungpau into a personal project of theirs, ruling over it with complete autocracy and surprising benevolance. All Crane corporate subsidiaries have activities in the Mandate, and the quality of life there has actually risen. The Banner of the Paper Crane itself is led by a member of the Mallow family, but the government of the region is headed by a local llama collaborator, showing Crane's surprisingly benign attitude towards the region.

Within the Banner's numbers, you can find soldiers of fortune of all stripes, creatures who more often have a loyalty to a paycheck than to the Empire of Kiria.\n\nBut that's fine; the Empire itself doesn't even care about controlling the majority of the Protectorate.

FRV_adv_0_desc:0 "A well-travelled mare from Aquila, Brown Beurré was less interested in pursuing the lofty liberal ideals of Aquileia's revolutionaries than she was in meeting and writing about the common creatures in all of the far-flung ports she visited. Taking up her pen, she became a travel journalist, catching ships to cities all across southern Griffonia, and eventually Zebrica. She might stay a few weeks or months, doing odd jobs and living with the lower classes while writing about their struggles and publishing her stories wherever she could.\n\nIn late 1006, when the news began to trickle out that Matriarch Superior Rain Shine had broken Kiria's long Silence, Brown Beurré eagerly sought passage aboard one of the first ships cautiously making their way to the reopened port of Fragrance.\n\nWhat she found shocked her. The common kirin in Fragrance was destitute, the city itself a shell of its former fame as the pearl of Kiria's north. And though Fickle Current and the NAKP never stopped talking about standing up for Fragrance's interests, Brown Beurré saw things a different way.\n\nLong hours, in dangerous factories, for pitiful pay, under the baton of some industrialist's foremare – that was a story that she had seen before, in a dozen other cities. But she arrived in Fragrance while Kiria was reckoning with itself, trying to decide what kind of country it wanted to be. Even more inspiring were the charity and hospitality of the city's lower classes, who despite having almost nothing, were always ready to share. She resolved to stay in Fragrance and do what she could to nudge the country in a better direction for the burgeoning masses of the growing city.\n\nShe put her pen to work, calling attention to the appalling treatment and living conditions of many of Fragrance's poorest, and though the NAKP often tried to shut her down, she found her ways of slipping through their hooves each time.\n\nNow, she finds herself thrust into a revolution that she had no small part in stoking but was totally unprepared for. With the city in revolt, her loyal readers are now manning the barricades and fighting for everything that she had urged them to stand up for – and though she has never held a rifle, Beurré knows that she owes a duty to this city, the first place in her life she truly feels might be her home."

KIR_CFR_mandate:0 "The Changeling Ost-Zebrikan Mandate"
KIR_CFR_mandate_desc:0 "The International City of Fragrance is not so much a colonial possession of Vesalipolis and its Queen as it is a corporate colony of Main Hive Industries. The secessionist war against Vermilion by the National Association of Kirin Patriots was bankrolled by MHI capital, secured by collateral in the form of swathes of real estate throughout Fragrance. The untimely military defeat of the NAKP obliged the MHI to seize their collateral, taking control of Fragrance mere hours before its surrender.\n\nIt was not to emissaries of Vesalipolis who the NAKP surrendered Fragrance, but Changeling mercenaries of the Vespidae Korps organised by MHI to fight for their kirin corporatist brethren. While the Queen's standard may fly over Fragrance, and although Vesalipolis greedily siphons capital and resources from the commerce flowing through the city, it is MHI who governs this foreign enclave on Kirian soil. Always predisposed to optimal cost-effective methods, the MHI technocrats have adopted a laissez-faire managerial style to their administration of the International City. Save for the matters reserved to the exclusive remit of the Changeling Ost-Zebrikan Mandate, including defence and international relations, most municipal functions are undertaken by the local kirin collaborators of the Civil Administration.\n\nIt is not out of benevolence, but necessity, that MHI and the Changeling Mandate has relinquished power to the Civil Administration. While there is very little love lost between Vermilion and the Fragrancese kirin — erstwhile supporters of the defeated NAKP — they will never accept the status of colonial subjects in their own hometown. The Changeling Mandate is financed almost entirely by MHI, and for them to govern Fragrance wholly under military occupation would require such marepower and resources as to turn the International City into an unquestionably loss-making venture."
KIR_masquerade:0 "§OThe Masquerade§!"
KIR_masquerade_desc:0 "Although there exists no historic enmity between the changeling and kirin races to render unpalatable to Vesalipolis the high degree of autonomy granted to the Civil Administration, which Queen Chrysalis would no doubt have quashed had Fragrance been a city of ponies or, Hatcher forbid, Equestrians, the technocrats of the Changeling Mandate are under no illusions as to the unpopularity of their rule. MHI had, after all, seized control of Fragrance as a creditor taking advantage of the NAKP's humiliating defeat at the hooves of Vermilion. Such autonomy would only breed contempt, conspiracy, and, ultimately, rebellion against the foreign interlopers, whose occupation had conveniently provided a protective umbrella under which to lick their wounds in preparation for revenge against Vermilion, but which will outlive its usefulness, sooner or later.\n\nIt is in recognition of this fact that the Changeling Mandate has taken great pains to ensure that the autonomy of the Civil Administration exists only as an illusion, a legal fiction to salve the much-bruised egos of their kirin wards. The Infils.-kommando Ost-Zebrika works tirelessly in the shadows, exercising the old Changeling politico-military traditions of infiltration and impersonation, to quietly dispose of Fragrancese politicians, industrialists, and security officers who show signs of disloyalty, revanchism, or anti-Changeling sentiment, their identities usurped by consummately-professional Changeling infiltrator-understudies.\n\nThe Fragrancese kirin are allowed to believe that they rule themselves, and that the Changeling Mandate merely serves to ensure their protection from Vermilion's vengeance. But should the masks ever come off, they will find themselves to be sorely mistaken. Their autonomy exists solely at the discretionary indulgence of the Infils.-kommando, and those who would threaten the security and stability of the International City will soon find themselves surprising their friends and family with their newfound and uncharacteristically outspoken appreciation of the benevolence of Fragrance's Changeling protectors."

Growing up as a gifted nymph with a passion for both music and theatre, it was obvious from a young age that Cheli Cerae was a changeling of extraordinary ability. So much so, in fact, that her talents as an actor and musician eventually caught the attention of the Infiltrator Corps. In the ensuing years she was trained in the venerated deep infiltration tradition, but she retained an artist's mindset, appreciating the elegance involved in manipulating creatures.\n\nShe played a part in the disastrous Canterlot Invasion of 1002, narrowly escaping with her life. Recriminations followed soon after: as the highest-ranking infiltrator who survived the operation, she took the brunt of Queen Chrysalis and the Heer High Command's backlash for the invasion's failure. They pinned the blame on the Infils.-Kommando Equestria's "outdated methods," saying that training deep cover infiltrators was too expensive, that they were too unreliable, that the risk of discovery was too great, and ultimately, that they were just not worth the cost.\n\nA new belief began to take hold: that the future of changeling conquest lay in mechanised and industrial warfare. Not in brilliant artistry but cold, calculated steel. The top brass argued that having a whole operation hinge on a single deep cover infiltrator meant having one point of failure, which was unacceptable. Cheli couldn't help rolling her eyes at that. They never mentioned that it was Queen Chrysalis who was the single point of failure during the Canterlot Invasion. Of course, she couldn't mention it either. Without recourse, Cheli Cerae was disgraced, demoted, and her beloved Infils.-Kommando Equestria was defunded, with all its personnel and resources diverted to other units.\n\nAnd now she has been sent to Kiria, far away from the fires of war that rage across Equus. With her raison d'être utterly discredited, no doubt Vesalipolis intends for her to languish in obscurity. But Cheli refuses to accept defeat—she intends to take this chance to resuscitate the old infiltrator traditions in a new world, or die trying.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! Rich May"

They strive to map and catalogue every personal relation, every business transaction, and eventually every thought of their subjects to maximize efficiency and preempt threats. The paranoia of the leaders quickly filter down into every stratum of society, as anyone could be an informer. But is it paranoia if they really are watching you?\n\nIn the International City of Fragrance, a gleaming metropolis on the shore of the North Kirin Sea, the Old Guard of the Changeling deep-cover infiltrator corps rule from the shadows. They are heirs to centuries of Changeling espionage tradition, consummate maestri of geopolitical drama, courtly intrigue, and ministerial thespianism. Discredited and disgraced after the disastrous Canterlot Defeat of 1002, the deep-cover infiltration doctrine was discarded in favour of modernised Sickertruppen tactics. A small but virtuosic cast of Changeling understudies carefully coached to assume the identities of foreign politicians, state bureaucrats, and military leaders was replaced by uniformed formations of saboteurs and infiltrators tasked with military operations behind enemy lines. The painstaking art of Changeling deep-cover infiltration had no place in a world of industrial and mechanised warfare.\n\nIn Changeling Fragrance, however, Operationsdirektorin Cheli Cerae and her cadre of infiltrator-thespians have found a safe haven. The vast continent of Zebrica has yet to be inoculated against the alien pathogen of Changeling subversion. On these foreign shores, the doppelgängers have found their new hunting grounds.§!"

The Guild has been thoroughly corporatised, shedding most aspects of its decentralised and democratic organisation. The Central Council still exists, but as a ceremonial body that serves more as a memorial to the Guild's past traditions than a functional decision-making body. The High Council, primarily composed of high-ranking directors and executives rather than craftsmares, makes most important decisions from their sequestered boardroom. Vestigial Chapters exist only in name as social cliques of Guild executives and managers, and the Guild's traditional membership of inventors and scientists has been relegated to salaried senior employees working under the control of management.\n\n§YPortrait by:§!

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_1:0 "I'm So Overwhelmed!"
KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_1_CONTENT:0 "I left Vermilion a few weeks ago to go visit the new steelworks that have been erected in Fragrance and Rhapsody, argued for and funded in large part by §YFickle Current§! and his like-minded business partners. I've traveled a little bit around the Realm as part of the job, and even a little bit before that when §YThe Silence§! still had our people locked in its grasp, but I've never been this far north. I thought all of our realm was like Vermilion or Massicot, either withering cities dwindling as they decayed, or small villages full of kirin trying to scratch out simple lives with no support or assistance from the government. But Fragrance and Rhapsody are nothing like that! They are still splendid cities, places that tried so very hard to resist the economic and societal collapses of The Silence, and managed to save some of our culture and way of life from before The Silence brought everything to a standstill. I don't know how better I could describe it. The kirin in these cities still have life and color in them, a sense of optimism that tomorrow is going to be a §Ybetter day§!. That's something I share with them, and it made me oh so happy to see it during my travels.\n\nOh, shoot, I'm getting off topic. Or am I? I don't know. Anyway, the §Ysteelworks§! that Fickle Current's clique funded are an amazing sight to behold. These aren't just workshops where blacksmiths forge steel and work their craft; this is something else entirely, a §Ymodern revolution§! that was smothered in Kiria a century ago, but was refined and perfected by the griffons of Griffonia and the ponies of Equus. These are entire factories filled with heavy machinery powered by electricity (another invention from over the seas; it makes me realize just how small my world was growing up in The Silence!) and guided along by workers who pull levers, hit buttons and somehow wrangle these machines into doing all the work for them. And the results can't even be compared to the work of smithy workshops and guilds; these factories can produce §Yin a day§! what an entire guild of talented blacksmiths can produce in a year! Sure, it loses some of that personal touch, but when we're trying to drag our entire nation into the modern era after a century of sitting on our hooves, this industrialization is practically a blessing sent by §YConcord§! herself. Current and his friends might be a little too cynical and greedy for my tastes, but the inventions they're bringing in from overseas, and the capital they're investing in setting up our industry, more than makes up for it. I can only hope that some of the fruits of their labor can make its way down to the kirin working in the steel mills; those I talked to said they worked §Yten or twelve hours a day§! in the scorching heat, with only a few breaks throughout the day. But it pays better than farming (so I've been told), and besides, we kirin like the heat anyway. It's a rough start for many of these workers, but I feel that given enough time and hardwork, this will all pay off for them like it will for the rest of us. We just have to believe in the future we're all building §Ytogether§!.\n\nI believe in that future, and in the Matriarch Superior, and in Concord's blessings. To some extent, I believe in Fickle Current and his compatriots too. We just have to work together to make the best use of the blessings Kiria has been given, and we can shape our future into anything we want it to be. And I'm going to do §Yeverything§! I can to help make it happen!" ##Note: the first three entries for all four characters will be available to KIC and KIS as well, as these entries will occur during the 3 1/2 year plan; that is, pre-civil war.

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_2:0 "Playing Middlemare"
KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_2_CONTENT:0 "Reform, reform, reform! I don't know how many times I had to say that word during the first meeting of §YThe Reform Bureau§! (oh darn I just did it again!), but today was a very busy day! Since the Matriarch Superior made me the premier of the §YPlenum§! (I still don't know why she trusts me with that much responsibility), I was automatically made the head of the Reform Bureau, which is just basically a fancy way of saying I have to be responsible for getting all the influential delegates from the Plenum into one place where we can discuss the specifics of how we want to enact things that get passed on the debate floor. We are, essentially, the §Ycentral government§! of Kiria, and we act with a limited amount of imperial mandate that Rain Shine blessed us with. That's a lot of responsibility for a young mare from Massicot to handle, but I'll do my best to save the Realm and not let the Matriarch down!\n\nUnfortunately, trying to get everykirin to work together is like herding cats, and I've never had a pet cat before, let alone two or three or four, so I'm a little short on experience. §YFickle Current§! brought in a lot of his buddies from overseas, and though the capitalists are providing a lot of the capital and ideas we need to get this whole modernization thing moving, I feel like I have to stop them from reshaping Kiria to §Ysuit their interests§! over those of the common kirin. At least I have somewhat of an ally in that in §YPriestess Winter Frost§!, who is wary about how rapid modernization will alter the social fabric of the kirin species, but I often feel like she goes a little too far. If you try to suggest anything that changes the way kirin society functioned during The Silence, she usually §Ypushes back hard on it§!, afraid of how any hint of modernization could possibly weaken the influence of §YThe Way of Fire§! in our culture. I had to end up playing middlemare between the two and finding a §Ycompromise that helps out everykirin§!, but I don't know how much longer I can keep that up if Winter and Fickle don't get on the same page. It's exhausting! Oh, how I wish I had Applejack and Fluttershy here to help show us how to follow §Ythe Equestrian model of Harmony...§!\n\nBut I'm not going to give up, not at all. Even if it is exhausting and draining, I'm going to keep going back into the Bureau and doing my best to move things along for the good of all the Realm. Hopefully, as we keep working together, we'll be able to get everykirin to have fair and honest debates about how we're going to modernize the country. We all have a common goal, afterall. It falls on us to figure out how to get to it. I'm confident we'll find a way to make that happen!"

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_3:0 "Why Me?"
KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_3_CONTENT:0 "I do not think that I am a good Premier.\n\nOh, how do I even begin? Today's assembly at the court was a complete and total disaster. In the midst of our bickering, a procession of kirin following the religious doctrine they call §YThe Rising Fire§! entered the court, led by a mare who calls herself Rising Sun, and asked to join in on the Plenum. I wanted to let them join, as every kirin should have a voice in determining §Ythe future of the Realm§!, but I let myself be bowled over by §YWinter Frost§! and §YFickle Current§!, who immediately opposed Rising Sun and her followers from joining in. Winter despises The Rising Fire, calling it and its followers §Yheretics§!, and I'm pretty sure she'd toss them all into the sea if she could. Current and his pals don't like the ideas of a §Ycommunalist society§!, because they feel it's a threat to the industry and capitalism they're trying to set up in the Realm. And me? I don't know what happened in court. I felt like I wasn't sure if letting Rising Sun and her followers join the Plenum was the right idea. §YEquestria§! once had a problem with ponies who had a similar mindset to Rising Sun and her sect, and it caused so much misery up there. Maybe I just didn't want the same thing to happen here in the Realm.\n\nBut Rising Sun and her followers are gone now. When I refused to welcome them to the Plenum, they were §Ychased out of the city§! by supporters of Fickle and Winter... and even some of my supporters as well. Instead of talking things out with Rising Sun, we refused to listen to what she had to say and used force to make her go away. And you know what scares me the most? Winter and Current were §Ymore than happy§! to use force to get what they wanted. I'm starting to think that not every debate and problem we're going to encounter at the Plenum can be solved with §Ywords and compromise§!. Force of will and personality (and, I hope, only those two kinds of force) will be what drags this Plenum across the finish line. I don't know if I have the mettle to stand up to Current and Frost when it counts. If I did, maybe I would have made sure that Rising Sun and her delegation had a seat at the Plenum to contribute ideas for the revitalization of our nation.\n\n§YThings are going badly§!, I feel, and this whole ordeal is turning out to be less fulfilling and uplifting than I thought it was going to be when I agreed to be the Matriarch's premier at the start of it all. But it's too late to back out of this now or feel sorry for myself. I have to push on and keep doing my job, no matter what it takes. §YAll of Kiria depends on it§!."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_4:0 "An Honest Heart" ## from KIR_civil_war_focus_6a
KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_4_CONTENT:0 "Hey there, dear diary. It's, uh, been a while, hasn't it? Truth be told I haven't felt like writing much. All I've really wanted to do is curl up in a ball and bury my head under my pillows and wallow in my own misery. I know that's not what kirin usually like to wallow in (what do we wallow in usually, anyway? Ceremony and tradition? That seems right), but it's where I've been ever since §YI messed up the Realm§!. Like, really messed it up. Messed it up so bad that kirin are fighting each other because I wasn't good at my job. I never should have been made Premier, and I feel so bad because Cinder Glow and Fern Flare are trying to keep things together without me but the thought of how I'm letting them down makes me feel even worse and then I feel so bad I don't want to get out of bed and then I realize I'm just letting them down even more and it's a vicious cycle that never ends—\n\nOkay, okay, let's try dropping anchor on that storm-tossed ship. At least, that's what I think you're supposed to do when you're on a ship in a storm (I've never been on a ship at sea, let alone one in a storm!). But the real reason I wanted to write something today isn't to whine about my failures, it's to actually write about something good. §YApplejack visited me today!§! I didn't even know she was going to be visiting Kiria but she came with a shipment of supplies from Equestria to help the Realm out with our troubles. I really wish we didn't need guns and ammunition, but I'd much rather our troops have Equestrian-made rifles and field supplies than nothing but the scales on their backs. Afterwards, we got to have tea, and Applejack apologized that Fluttershy didn't come to see me, because the thought of war scares her and Equestria has its own problems that she can help with. I told Applejack that if anycreature should be apologizing it should be me. I don't like war either, but §YI basically started this one§! and now the Realm is in ruins because of me. I didn't even get another sentence into blaming myself before Applejack put a hoof on my shoulder and tell me I can't blame myself for everything that's happened. She said even Princess Celestia would struggle to do what I was trying to do, to condense a hundred years of progress into no more than four, and that was even before the Plenum started attracting §Ygreedy and lying kirin§! who wanted the Grand Gallop Onward to benefit them specifically instead of the entire Realm. It would have taken a miracle to go off without a hitch, but just because things were broken now, it doesn't mean we should just throw away the pieces. There's still time to try and glue them back together. I'm not sure how I feel about that, but §Yif Applejack believes it, then maybe I should, too.§!\n\nApplejack was sorry that she couldn't do much more for us than bring us some supplies and offer more than words, but Equestria has its own problems brewing with the Changelings (and I think my own little joke that I would have loved having changeling actors during my time as a stage writer would have been neat was unappreciated—stupid Autumn!) and they need to be ready in case things go bad in Equus. I asked her if she had any advice for me because she's a smart pony, and Applejack told me that I'm a smart kirin (which I doubt very much) and that it isn't her place to give advice on how to be a Premier. But she did point out that everything she saw in Vermilion told her that I should be comforted by the fact that §Ythe Realm & Harmony Party stands behind me§! even through my absence and they remain committed to fighting the good fight and defending harmony. That being said, she did offer me her thoughts on the kirin I'm working with from her brief opportunities to speak with them. She said she appreciates what Winter Frost believes in, in that tradition itself isn't a bad thing—after all, the Apple Family has a lot of really proud traditions (and how I would love to get a chance to meet them in Equestria when all this is over!) but tradition can't get in the way of progress. She said she thinks Winter Frost is so worried about forsaking tradition §Ythat she'd freeze the whole Realm if she could§! so that things never changed.\n\nUnfortunately, I think that she's spot on. It's just more challenges I'll have to account for if I'm ever going to try and get the Realm back on track. And to be honest, given how daunting everything seems, §YI worry that I'll never have the strength to try.§!\n\nOh, but it wasn't all doom and gloom about the Realm between two mares! Applejack brought somekirin with her, a kirin named Mahogany Blaze who had graduated from Equestria's friendship school (given everything happening in the Realm today, I think the kirin could really benefit from one or two or twelve thousand of those)! I was shocked that anykirin would want to come back to the Realm in the midst of the war going on when living in peaceful Equestria was an option, but I have to hoof it to the young stallion, because he said that all the stuff he learnt about friendship and harmony wouldn't mean anything if he didn't fight for it in the place where it matters the most: §Yhere in Kiria.§! He didn't know quite how he was going to do that yet, but he was willing to lend a hoof anywhere we could use him, and I told him that we'd find someplace for him and that I really appreciated him coming out here. §YHe would make a fine example to kirin everywhere looking to do the right thing.§!\n\nThen, sadly, we had to say goodbye, and I all but cried right then and there saying goodbye to Applejack. But she told me to be strong, and she told Mahogany Blaze, as former teacher to former student, to use everything he'd learned at the school to make the Realm a better place. Mahogany told Applejack he'd make her proud, and I just know he will, too. Kiria has great things in store for him—and, I can only hope, §Yfor me as well.§!"

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_5:0 "In the Fog of War"
KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_5_CONTENT:0 "Today, I was visiting a military hospital in the Osage District to pay my respects to the convalescent soldiers there. It pains my heart to see them lying without limbs, horns, even eyes, lost in battle against the §RRealm's enemies§!. But it is important for the soldiery to know that their Premier cares for them very much, that I have seen their suffering and bore witness to their sacrifice.\n\nA banner-lieutenant from the Covered Cage, a mare by the name of §YStar Anise§!, pulled me aside as I made my way through the intensive therapy ward. She told me that one of the war wounded, a stallion named §YInkhoof§!, wanted to speak to me about a matter pertaining to our enemies in the war. I agreed at once; even if Inkhoof had merely wanted to speak to me about mid-millennium Kirian literature or hoofball, I would not turn down a request from one of the Realm's §Ybrave sons and daughters§! to speak to their Premier, on whose behalf they had risked, and lost, life and limb.\n\nI have reproduced Inkhoof's account in its entirety below. His description of what he had experienced was disturbing, to say the least. I had always found solace — meagre, cold solace, but solace nonetheless — in the fact that §Ymy enemies were but kirin§!, children of Concord, and that we had, at least, this much in common despite our internecine strife. Even as pitiful a consolation as this has been stripped from me; I know not what dark forces have now been pitted against the Realm.\n\n§YInkhoof's story§!:\n"It's an honour to speak with you, Premier. You need to know what happened to me. I was wounded a few weeks ago. I was my unit's dispatch messenger, on the road with a message from the advance guard to field HQ. I passed by a platoon of kirin, armed and equipped with regulation weaponry and uniforms straight from the manual, which was unusual to begin with. Even more unnerving was how they were all completely mute and staring at each other. They were just resting by the road, not talking, or smoking, or anything. Just staring.\n\n"They seemed stiff and rigid like statues. But when they noticed me approaching, all of their eyes became trained on me, even the ones who were originally laying down facing the sky. It was the creepiest feeling I'd ever experienced. One among them, an officer, broke the silence by introducing herself to me as Lieutenant Patina. She said that they were just resting, making their way to field HQ as well, just like me. She followed up by asking if I was from the advance guard, and if HQ was expecting me. 'Yeah, we radioed ahead to say I'm coming,' I told her.\n\n"She said that that was interesting, and that she thought the attack wasn't until yesterday. I told her that our commander wanted to strike early. You know, while the iron is hot and all that. She then asked me if I wanted to stay and rest for a bit, maybe have some tea as well. At that point I could have sworn that I was the only kirin blinking there. I made some excuses and went on my way. The next day, I made it to HQ and dropped off the report. As I did, a hush came over the room. The brigadier general rushed me into his tent and started questioning me.\n\n"He said that the advance guard had been wiped out last night. Their last, frantic radio transmission made no sense. Something about a platoon of friendlies arriving out of nowhere, saying that they're from HQ even though there wasn't any notification given to the advance guard, and when the radio operator called HQ to verify them, they started gunning everykirin down. 'Friendly fire!' was the last thing heard on comms.\n\n"I still don't know what really happened. I told Lieutenant Anise here about it, but she said that central command in Vermilion hadn't received a report about anything like this from the field HQ. I hope you get to the bottom of this, Premier. The northerners have something to do with this, they must have. When you're stuck in the trenches for weeks and months, rumours travel fast down the grapevine. I've heard enough stories to know that I'm not the only one who's run into these §Yunits of wax kirin§!.""

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_6:0 "The Metal Kirin"
KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_6_CONTENT:0 "Hey, so, uh, oof. Kind of a tough one today. Honestly, any time I have to speak with Ember Wane, I feel like that kirin is about to pry my scales off with a rusty spoon if I say the wrong thing. Thankfully, I haven't had to speak to him much, even in my duties as Premier, but unfortunately today was another one of those times. I met him in a secret briefing (you better not tell anykirin about this, diary!) to talk about §Ysomething that could help in the war.§! Now normally I've been a little too down in the dumps lately to think about anything involving the war, but if Ember Wane had a chance to help put a stop to it, I was going to listen, even if that stallion kind of freaks me out.\n\nUnfortunately he immediately mentioned the Sunrise Massacre, that awful piece of historical nonfiction I wish was historical fiction about how the Banner of the Covered Cage went and massacred a village full of skilled artificers because they wouldn't listen to Matriarch Superior Noctilucent Charm's decrees that made up The Silence. As much as the summary of the massacre makes me feel sick to my stomach, he went over it in detail. My gut promptly started doing flips having to stomach such an awful topic, but he at least got to his point quick enough. It wasn't so much a lopsided massacre as it was a battle, and Ember Wane seemed to almost enjoy making me uncomfortable with stories about how the artificers of sunrise fought with sundry artifacts and advanced contraptions, both mechanical and magical, that killed kirin in various brutal and violent ways (it makes me gag just thinking about it again). But even all those gizmos and doodads weren't the main problem. That honor was apparently reserved for the §Yhundreds of clockwork golems§! that the artificers had under their control. Immune to swords and arquebuses, they apparently gave the Covered Cage quite the run for its money until they found the antenna that controlled them in the village and broke it. And then he spent more time talking about all the bad wounds the golems inflicted on the kirin fighting him, because §Yof course§! he did.\n\nAt that point I interrupted him asking him what the point of all this stuff was, and he didn't seem to like me cutting into his gruesome story time, but he got to the point anyway. According to the logs of the Covered Cage after the battle, they didn't destroy the golems, and actually found a bunch more of them sealed up in a cave beneath Sunrise, §Yjust waiting for the command to activate.§! Ember Wane seemed to think that justified his ancestors' actions in putting the entire village to the torch, and after making sure that he stressed that point to me again, he finally revealed the real reason for the meeting. The Sunrise was erased from most maps of the Realm, the Covered Cage knew where it once stood, and would be able to locate the cavern again (with a little expeditionary aid) where §Yan army of clockwork kirin stand waiting to be activated§!, dormant for fifty years. He wanted my help in organizing the expedition and getting the Covered Cage official approval from Vermilion in digging the golems back up (and, I'm sure, admission from Vermilion that the Banner of the Covered Cage was TOTALLY JUSTIFIED in wiping out an entire village because of the inventions they used against them five decades ago, as seen in Exhibit A: spooky underground cave filled with kirin golems).\n\nI told Ember Wane that we'd definitely consider it, as Vermilion is looking for any edge it can get to win the civil war. While clockwork golems from fifty years back won't singlehoofedly win the war, they'll certainly help.

I enjoyed the poem for its lyrical poetry, but only now, §Yin the twilight of Kiria§!, do I truly understand the poem — being in a similar position as Princess Shade, presiding over the ruin of her nation.\n\nOh what have I done? What have I done? It's all so wrong. So very wrong. There's screaming in the streets, soot in the air. The whole Realm is on fire and it's §Yall my fault!§! The whole Realm has finally found its breaking point. Rising Sun and Winter Frost have spent so long fighting each other and hating each other that they couldn't keep it back any longer. Words escalated to screaming, then hooves and magic got involved, and then flames! Kirin from both sides poured out of the gallery and joined in the melee, and soon there were nirik everywhere! Everywhere! I barely got out of there with my life, and then the flames caught on the banners, and now the palace is burning! I just... §Ywhy?!§!

Don't think about the fangs you just felt pressing against your lips. Just focus on writing. Writing! Keep the anger down. I can do this if I just keep writing. But writing about what? I can't think about anything else with all the fire and noise outside. I can't even leave the city, there's too many nirik in the streets, somenirik will get me for sure! I'm trapped inside my room, stuck with the thoughts of my failure. All I wanted to do was bring the Realm into the modern world. I knew it was going to be tough. There were going to be problems along the way. I thought the war with Fragrance was about the worst that it could get, but it'd be worth it in the end. Rainbows won't light up the sky unless it rains. Candles won't glow until they're burned. §YBut I didn't think we'd be creating a monsoon or setting fire to the house!§! Now instead of rainbows there's just going to be clouds of ash and the fires of ruin. No more laughter, only pain.

I'm just so mad! But what's the point in trying to stay sane anymore? The Realm's already ruined!

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_8_CONTENT:0 "Hi Diary. Do you like history? You must, I mean, that's kind of your purpose right? To record a kirin's personal history? Because I have some history for you that I'm just dying to talk about! Not my own, but also I guess kind of my own? Maybe a sort of shared history of the collective kirin race, of which last I checked, I'm a member of!\n\nSo let's get the bad out of the way first: war sucks, and I hate everything that goes along with it. It makes me just want to curl up on my bed, hug my tail close to my body, and wait in shivering silence until the awful stuff goes away. But I guess in this one case, war was accidentally a good thing? Anyway, the fighting going on in the Sunshine Headlands got so bad that an artillery barrage triggered a rockslide on one of the mountains. Local survivors from the nearby towns seeking shelter went to the area and found the most unexpected thing: §Yan ancient tomb§! exposed to the air for the first time in thousands of years now that explosives had blasted away its cover. Talk about explosive archaeology, right? Exciting stuff!\n\nEven more exciting than the tomb was what was in it. The army captain in the area went to investigate the tomb after hearing about the locals, and inside they found a fancy-schmancy metal sarcophagus decorated with all sorts of runes and other neat mystical stuff. Inside of THAT, however, was the real kicker: the skeleton of a tall, slender equinoid, without any scales on its back but with a long horn on its forehead. You know what that sounds like? That sounds like §Yan eastern unicorn§!, like the kind from legends! You know the legends, diary (maybe you don't, being a book and all), about ancient unicorns in kirin mythology that supposedly bred with dragons to create the first kirin. Of course, who knows if that's real or phony baloney, given that the accepted origin of the kirin is that §Ywe were created by Concord§! as custodians of the Primordial Fire that birthed the world, which is why we go all nirik-y and all that. But if it's not a hoax, it's certainly something neat to study and think about!\n\nUnfortunately, war makes it a pretty bad time to try and study something like that, and the fighting going on in the Sunshine Headlands doesn't really guarantee the safety of any archeologists who would be interested in going out there. While the army took some pictures of everything (and I got to see them!) we'll have to wait until calmer times to actually get a closer look at it all. For the time being, the army §Ysealed the tomb with explosives§! to protect it. It's a shame; there's so much we could stand to learn from exploring the site further, but all the fun and fanciful stuff gets pushed into the background when there's a war going on, and survival is the most important thing. Hopefully one day, when the war is done, we'll be able to send a team back to the tomb, maybe even with international support, and §Yunravel the secrets of this ancient unicorn.§!"

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_9_CONTENT:0 "It's so strange to be back in these walls again. It's been years since I left them when I was a filly, and they're still as cold and imposing as ever. I spent five years of my life studying in the monastery in Massicot, learning how to read and write through devotion to the Way of Fire and poring over the temple's sacred texts before I finally decided I couldn't take it anymore and ran away. I never once thought I'd be back, but I guess I better get used to it now, because I'm not going anywhere anytime soon.\n\n"But Autumn," you may ask, diary, my dear friend, "aren't you Rain Shine's Premier or something?" Yeah, I thought so too. But in continuing the trend of being a very bad premier, I didn't even realize until it was too late that Winter Frost had been working behind the scenes to maneuver the Serene Tendency and the Radiant Hierocracy into a position to pounce on me when my back was turned. While in public, Winter worked with me to win the civil war, behind closed doors, she and her followers were §Ybuying off members of my Realm and Harmony Party§! and swaying kirin to her side. Imagine the look on my clueless face when the RaHP abandoned me as soon as the fighting was done and appointed Winter Frost to replace me! A rather fitting and ignominious end for Kiria's worst premier ever, right?\n\nWhile I deserve what my uselessness has brought me, I feel worse for the other believers in the RaHP who stayed with me until the end. They were blindsided just as badly as I was and now they're scrambling to pick up the pieces of their lives as the Serene Tendency tightens its control on the Realm. Many of them have emigrated abroad, and many more have just put their heads down and tried to come to terms with the new status quo, abandoning support (at least publicly) for the democratic ideas we once championed. As for me, Winter told me she had heard there was a position open for a new acolyte in the temple in my hometown, and strongly implied that it would be in my best interest to petition the monastery matriarch to take me in. It's not like I could say no to that, as much as I wanted to—I still have family in Massicot, and I don't want anything bad to happen to them if I didn't comply. Without the RaHP, there's nothing to protect them (or me, not like my scales are worth protecting anyway) in case they just so happen to be investigated for heresy...\n\nThe whole stinky stink of the thing means that §Ythe old RaHP is dead and gone§!, the kirin who once believed in it scattered to the winds. Now I have to spend my days trudging around the monastery in prayer and meditation, proving to Matriarch Whispering Reed that I'm taking my position as her acolyte seriously. I don't really like her that much. She's always cold to me, if polite, and she knows as well as I do that I'm basically a political prisoner in her care. She's definitely not Matriarch Jubilant Days, the matriarch who was in charge of the temple when I was a filly, and who was basically like an aunt to me even though it was clear I wasn't cut out for the life of a mystic. Not even the occasional visits by the idealistic young mares and stallions who seek out the former leader of the RaHP brightens my days all that much. They expect me to be some charismatic figure, an inspiring beacon of hope and reform, but I don't have anything I can tell them. I already failed at reforming Kiria, and all it did was get countless thousands of kirin killed. §YWhat words of wisdom can I provide for them when all I did was fail?§! I can only watch that bright hope fade from their faces when they realize that I have nothing I can give them other than vague promises that democracy will come to Kiria someday if they just keep working at it, and that's the starkest reminder of how far I've fallen I can imagine. Maybe one day, they'll stop coming when they realize I'm useless, and somekirin far better than me can take up the cause. I can only hope.\n\nOh, that's the prayer bell for the evening prayers. Guess I better wrap this up, then. I don't know what more to tell you, diary. I'm through. I'm spent. I'm kaput. And if this is the punishment I have to endure for getting too big in the horn, then I'll endure it. At the very least, I still have my parents in Massicot with me. So long as I still have my mom's shoulder to cry on and my dad to give me a hug, I'll be alright. I'll endure.\n\n§YGoodbye, diary.§!"

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_10_CONTENT:0 "If there's one thing I learned when I studied in that temple in Massicot when I was a filly (okay I learned a lot more than one thing, like, at least ten), it was philosophy! Maybe not philosophy itself, since religious shut-ins and all that only want to think about how they can think about the same thing they think about all the time in a slightly different way this time, but I learned how to think good! And I've been doing a lot of thinking lately about something §Yvery important to me:§! Harmony!\n\nEver since I first met Applejack and Fluttershy all those years ago and they told me about Equestria and how everypony there lives in harmony, I've always wanted to find some way to bring that same harmony to Kiria. Unfortunately, Kiria is a very different country from Equestria, and that means that a lot of §YKirian problems require Kirian solutions.§! When I first heard about Equestria from my pair of pony pals, I thought it didn't sound too different from the Realm at its core; Equestria was a nation built on peace and stability, and isn't that what Kiria was? It had been so peaceful and so stagnant that it hadn't changed in a century—surely that meant it was harmonious, right? But as they talked, I soon realized there was a key difference. Harmony isn't just peace and stability; you can have that without harmony, mandated through oppression, and §Ythat's exactly what The Silence was.§! The Realm was the most peaceful and stable state in Zebrica, but it wasn't exactly harmonious.\n\nThat got me to do some thinking, and I realized that true Harmony doesn't mean that everykirin has to be uniform or conform to the party line, but rather finding a balance between our differences. §YKiria is a land of a lot of different kirin§! who all have different ideas over how the country should be fixed. The Grand Gallop Onward taught me that with a lot of painful lessons. But when we all worked together in unison, the differences between the kirin of the Realm are the very thing that made us stronger! Each of the parties in the Plenum approached the challenges of modernizing the Realm in their own way, and the different ideas that emerged allowed us to cover each other's weaknesses and amplify one another's strengths. That's what got me to realize what true Harmony is, Kirian or Equestrian or otherwise: as long as multiple DIFFERENT forces work together toward some common goal, and together they're all stronger than they are apart, §Ythat's harmony.§! That's what makes Equestria so successful, and though Kirians aren't Equestrians, it's what's helping to make the Realm succeed in what others would believe to be impossible. No matter our differences, so long as we realize that we're all one big kirin community, that we all have more in common with each other than not, we can work collectively toward a common goal and make something truly special.\n\nI guess to sum it all up in a nice metaphor, harmony is a symphony. Sure, a flute can sound really good on its own, but when it's by itself, it has nothing to harmonize with. You have to surround that flute with chimes and drums and erhus and all the other wonderful different instruments and let them play together to create a symphony. Just like in the symphony, all the different parts have to work together in a collective and cooperative effort to flourish, contributing their strengths to the performance and amplifying their strengths together. That's what us kirin are: we're all instruments of the great symphony that is Kiria, and together, we will §Yplay the harmonious music of our history and future!§!"

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_11:0 "Eight Great Cities" ## from focus KIR_POST_7
KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_11_CONTENT:0 "How do you keep a country that is modernizing and urbanizing beyond anycreature's wildest imaginations from spiraling out of control from too much of a good thing? Well, if somecreature had thought of a solution before, I would have loved to have known about it, but for now, we have to do the best we can with the tools and ideas we have at our disposal. Right now, the Realm is dealing with urbanization that's never been seen before as kirin move back into the cities and off of the subsistence farms they'd been relegated to in The Silence, and the needs of the cities are §Yvery different from the town and villages§! that until now made up the majority of the population centers of the Realm. Administering a city is a complex task that requires different powers, skill sets, and an entirely different context from the provincial diets that used to govern large swaths of sparsely populated countryside and dozens of small towns. So how have we decided to go about addressing the problem?\n\n§YEnter the Eight Golden Mayoralties!§! It's a fancy name, I know, I spent a long time thinking about what I wanted to call it. You can hold your applause, dear diary. But the beauty is in the simplicity. In short, the Eight Great Cities of the Realm—Vermilion, Fragrance, Rhapsody, Radiance, Verdant, Chrysanthemum, Sorghum, and my hometown of Massicot—will be granted their own Mayoralities to administer their affairs independent of the Provincial Diets that cover their territory. The cities will be governed by a Mayor and a ten-kirin Mayoral Cabinet elected from the sitting representatives of the Provincial Diet to enact and execute municipal legislation. The kirin of the cities will be able to elect their representatives, allowing them to make their voices heard and solve the problems they need solving in a way only they can. §YDemocracy in action!§!\n\nEven as we worked on drafting the Eight Golden Mayoralities decree, Fern Flare pointed out that it will also help those cities address any bubbling discontent and unrest, the same kind of issues that led to Noctilucent Charm enacting The Silence in the first place last century. By letting the cities handle their own affairs, it allows them to divert that discontent into electoral politics, letting kirin make their voices heard in the ballot box instead of, you know, going into a mindless nirik berserker rage and §Yburning down a couple buildings to express their anger instead.§! Letting the cities solve the problems as their electorate sees fit will help foster Harmony across the Realm by providing different solutions to different challenges and allowing the others to adopt something that works somewhere else, rather than a mandate from Vermilion imposing a one-size-fits-all solution that works for some cities and definitely doesn't work for others. Given how badly things in the Realm tend to go when one group's opinion tries to make others conform to it, this is a great idea to help keep the peace. With all the chaos that's happened over the last few years, I think we've all come to realize that §YKiria is a pressure cooker§!, and without any release valves for kirin to express their discontent in an acceptable way (such as the ballot box), they tend to think taking up arms and overthrowing the local government is the only way to get what they want. And I don't think I have to explain why trying to govern a Realm that thinks overthrowing the government to get what they want is a very difficult task!\n\nEven as we worked toward enacting the decree, Cinder Glow warned me that there's a chance that these sort of local electoral politics could result in the different cities §Yentrenching divisions from the rest of the Realm§! and championing those differences into some sort of idea that they're better than the rest. It's kind of a scary thing if you look at what that extreme could look like. Instead of eight great cities working together to solve the Realm's problems, you could end up with eight different cities that each resent each other for being different. It would be like each section of an orchestra playing its own melody, §Yunable to come together in true harmony.§! That's why we need a conductor, so to speak. A national identity of kirin, the recognition that the Kirian people are not subjects of Vermilion or even their own Mayoralities, but citizens of the Realm. Thankfully, there are three such conductors that can work together to keep the orchestra together and the people happy: the Matriarch Superior, the Way of Fire, and now the Kirian Constitution, the rising third pillar on which the Realm stands. So long as all three of these parts conduct the orchestra together, §Yand the Kirian people grow to respect and defend their constitution,§! then Harmony in the Realm will truly flourish like never before!"

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_12_CONTENT:0 "§YToday was the day of days§!, one of the days to ever have day-ed (that's a good thing)! After a lot of time and effort, we finally managed to create an oath that will be sworn by all servants of the Realm, no matter what their position. Whether they're local or national officers, elected or appointed, secular or religious, and anything and everything in between, there is no one common oath that they will all swear that will tie the government of the Realm together into something real and permanent.\n\nWhy is this something to write about, you may ask? Because it's a huge deal, that's why! Nothing like this has ever existed in the Realm before. Before, during, and immediately after The Silence, the Realm was a mishmash of governing ideas all rooted in religious devotion, a semi-theocratic state with mystics and priestesses occupying key roles, while local governors, mayors, banner-clans, and much, much more all had some level of autonomy. §YTalk about a headache trying to change anything from within the system!§! But the Grand Gallop Onward offered an opportunity to change things, and after I hammered some ideas of modern civil service inspired by Equestria onto the thing with crooked nails and a rusty hammer, we finally had a framework to start peeling back some of the many layers of legislative paint that had been slapped onto it over the centuries. Thus, the perfect opportunity to provide a starting point for reorganizing and streamlining the laws and branches of government by getting everykirin to pledge their loyalty to the same thing in the same way.\n\nOf course, that ended up being a HUGE undertaking, much more than I ever could have thought! Everykirin wanted something represented in the oath. Winter Frost wanted specific references to Concord and the Way of Fire. The Movement for a Modern Kiria wanted specific references to the Kirian nation independent of the Matriarch Superior. The Marksists wanted references to the Kirian people. Many ultratraditionalists wanted references to the Vermilion Dynasty. The diaspora of Fragrance wanted references to the Kirian nationals abroad. So many demands, but in the end, we agreed that the oath should be sworn to two things: §Ythe Matriarch Superior and the Kirian Constitution§!, in that order. There was debate over which should come first, but we ultimately agreed that Matriarch Superior Rain Shine is the one thing that all kirin, no matter their political inclination or beliefs, no matter where they were born or what they for what cause they champion, agree unifies us. As much as the Kirian people are Kiria, Rain Shine IS the Realm, no matter what form it takes or how it styles itself.\n\nIt took a while to get the words just right, but today, I led a crowd of one thousand servants of the Vermilion state gathered in the Verdigris Rotunda to swear it this morning, in the presence of Rain Shine. I even had my hoof on the original copy of the new Kirian Constitution as I led the crowd in the words. §YGood thing I don't have stage fright!§! It was a magical moment, made even more magical because I knew my voice was being broadcast throughout the Realm, and government officials everywhere were swearing their oaths with me to create the beginning of the new and modern Kiria. Then when it was done, we all celebrated at a feast and raised our glasses to the work we had done and the work we had yet to accomplish.\n\nAs magical as the moment was, I'm not going to lie, §Ythere's still a daunting task ahead of us.§! The Vermilion state is still a patchwork of overlapping jurisdictions governed by different rules, different structure, different powers, hierarchies, tradition, religious superstition, all of that fun stuff. It's super duper inefficient, and I don't dare try to examine the systems myself to reconcile the distances for fear I'll go mad and end up making an early return to Concord! It's going to take a long time to straighten things out and streamline Kiria into a modern state, but that's okay! We have a lot of differences to resolve, but we'll find a way to resolve them and use them to grow together, to create a strong and harmonious state, much like the Equestria I was enthralled with through the stories Applejack and Fluttershy told me in 1006. Keeping that harmony in mind, the kirin of the Realm will work together to weave a colorful tapestry of the Kirian nation-state and community. §YHarmony in Diversity§!, if you will. Ooh, I like that one! I'll have to pitch that name at the next assembly. By embracing our diversity and harmonizing it with each other, we'll create an integral part of the Kirian national ethos, and build a greater Kiria on its scales.\n\nWell, that's it for now, diary! There's a lot of work to be done, and it almost feels like not enough time to do it! But if we could pull off the Grand Gallop Onwards, then §Ywe can accomplish anything we want if we work together!§!"

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_1_entry_13_CONTENT:0 "Hey there, dear diary. It's, uh, been a while, hasn't it? Truth be told I haven't felt like writing much. All I've really wanted to do is curl up in a ball and bury my head under my pillows and wallow in my own misery. I know that's not what kirin usually like to wallow in (what do we wallow in usually, anyway? Ceremony and tradition? That seems right), but it's where I've been ever since §YI messed up the Realm§!. Like, really messed it up. Messed it up so bad that kirin are fighting each other because I wasn't good at my job. I never should have been made Premier, and I feel so bad because Cinder Glow and Fern Flare are trying to keep things together without me but the thought of how I'm letting them down makes me feel even worse and then I feel so bad I don't want to get out of bed and then I realize I'm just letting them down even more and it's a vicious cycle that never ends—\n\nOkay, okay, let's try dropping anchor on that storm-tossed ship. At least, that's what I think you're supposed to do when you're on a ship in a storm (I've never been on a ship at sea, let alone one in a storm!). But the real reason I wanted to write something today isn't to whine about my failures, it's to actually write about something good. §YApplejack visited me today!§! I didn't even know she was going to be visiting Kiria but she came with a shipment of supplies from Equestria to help the Realm out with our troubles. I really wish we didn't need guns and ammunition, but I'd much rather our troops have Equestrian-made rifles and field supplies than nothing but the scales on their backs. Afterwards, we got to have tea, and Applejack apologized that Fluttershy didn't come to see me, because the thought of war scares her and Equestria has its own problems that she can help with. I told Applejack that if anycreature should be apologizing it should be me. I don't like war either, but §YI basically started this one§! and now the Realm is in ruins because of me. I didn't even get another sentence into blaming myself before Applejack put a hoof on my shoulder and tell me I can't blame myself for everything that's happened. She said even Princess Celestia would struggle to do what I was trying to do, to condense a hundred years of progress into no more than four, and that was even before the Plenum started attracting §Ygreedy and lying kirin§! who wanted the Grand Gallop Onward to benefit them specifically instead of the entire Realm. It would have taken a miracle to go off without a hitch, but just because things were broken now, it doesn't mean we should just throw away the pieces. There's still time to try and glue them back together. I'm not sure how I feel about that, but §Yif Applejack believes it, then maybe I should, too.§!\n\nApplejack was sorry that she couldn't do much more for us than bring us some supplies and offer more than words, but Equestria has its own problems brewing with the Changelings (and I think my own little joke that I would have loved having changeling actors during my time as a stage writer would have been neat was unappreciated—stupid Autumn!) and they need to be ready in case things go bad in Equus. I asked her if she had any advice for me because she's a smart pony, and Applejack told me that I'm a smart kirin (which I doubt very much) and that it isn't her place to give advice on how to be a Premier. But she did point out that everything she saw in Vermilion told her that I should be comforted by the fact that §Ythe Realm & Harmony Party stands behind me§! even through my absence and they remain committed to fighting the good fight and defending harmony. That being said, she did offer me her thoughts on the kirin I'm working with from her brief opportunities to speak with them. She said she appreciates what Winter Frost believes in, in that tradition itself isn't a bad thing—after all, the Apple Family has a lot of really proud traditions (and how I would love to get a chance to meet them in Equestria when all this is over!) but tradition can't get in the way of progress. She said she thinks Winter Frost is so worried about forsaking tradition §Ythat she'd freeze the whole Realm if she could§! so that things never changed.\n\nAs for Rising Sun, Applejack was a lot less generous (I think generosity is supposed to be her friend Rarity's thing, if I remember right). She simply told me to be careful, because she thinks Rising Sun is a big fat liar (okay maybe those weren't her words but it's basically what she said). The Rising Fire are all about equality before Concord, justice, freedom, all that, but she doesn't trust Rising Sun one bit. She thinks Rising Sun has something to hide, that she doesn't really believe in what she's preaching, and she might be an even more dangerous snake than the kirin in the NAKP. I asked her what made her think that, and she just said to §Ycall it a gut feeling from the Element of Honesty§!.\n\nUnfortunately, I think that she's spot on. It's just more challenges I'll have to account for if I'm ever going to try and get the Realm back on track. And to be honest, given how daunting everything seems, §YI worry that I'll never have the strength to try.§!\n\nEventually, it was time for Applejack to go, and I all but cried right then and there saying goodbye to her. But she told me to be strong, and to believe in the power of harmony and my friends in the Realm & Harmony Party. For the sake of Kiria, I will try.§!"

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_2_entry_1:0 "Concord's Will"
KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_2_entry_1_CONTENT:0 "Praise be to Concord that in Her divine wisdom, She has seen fit to end The Silence that has blanketed our realm for too long. The kirin people have had §Yone hundred years§! to repent and reflect on the sins of modernization that nearly undid all the hard work of The Way of Fire in unifying our scattered and quarrelsome race centuries ago, and I feel that our society and culture has learned a great deal from the experience. Concord imparted Her will to punish Her errant children through §YMatriarch Noctilucent Charm§!, and now She has decided to forgive us through §YMatriarch Rain Shine§!. Now the only question is this: did we learn our lesson the first time?\n\nDuring Matriarch Charm's reign, §Yunchecked and unfettered modernization§! nearly collapsed our society, as the hedonism of modern conveniences turned our society away from the simple truths of The Way of Fire. We, our parents, our grandparents, and even our great grandparents have atoned for these mistakes. As proudly supportive of tradition as I am, and naturally wary of any change that could undermine Concord's divine authority in our lives, I nevertheless believe that we can safely bring the Realm out of The Silence and into the modern era through careful reflection and consideration of how our choices align with Concord's will. We cannot be willing to blindly turn our faith from our Matriarch to enlightenment and luxury, for then we lose sight of Concord's vision. Foreigners like Fickle Current and his capitalists have been born and raised without Concord's guidance in their lives; they are no followers of The Way of Fire, and they should not be allowed to dictate the future of kirin society. But their money and innovations can serve Kiria in Her vision all the same. One example is the §Yexpansion of roads§! that many of my fellow priests and mystics have volunteered to organize and lead. All across the Realm, my fellow spiritual leaders are recruiting peasants from the fields to repair and renew the roads linking the Realm together, roads that have long fallen into disrepair and disuse throughout The Silence. It is important work that needs to be done, and this modernization will allow us to once again §Yreassert Concord's will§! across the Realm. It is a truly noble project, and just one of many ways we can use the tools of the modern time to reinforce our tradition and our heritage.\n\nBut such a venture also comes with its own risks. The disconnectedness of The Silence was a test placed by Concord to measure our devotion and reward our faith in Her. But now that we are reconnecting the realm, it is clear that some have failed the test. §YHotbeds of heresy§! have sprung up in the west, even in cities such as Verdant and Chrysanthemum, where the mystics and their followers have turned away from The Way of Fire to adopt their own set of heretical beliefs. Connecting Vermilion to these cities is not a one way street; just as they allow the Matriarch to reassert her authority over the west, they allow the heretics to spread their lies and falsehoods further into the east. Such heresy is §Yunacceptable§!, and I will do everything in my power to stamp it out before its corruption can ensnare Vermilion. Such is Concord's will, and as one of Her priestesses, I am Her instrument. I will not fail my Goddess, nor will I fail my Matriarch. I will be the voice of tradition and heritage that Kiria needs me to be, for the good of the Realm."

Today, Fickle Current and his cronies orchestrated a takeover of the government through paper and honeyed words. They stole the divine authority that Concord blesses our Matriarchs with for themselves, turning the Morning Secretariat into the central governing body of the Realm, and removing Matriarch Rain Shine's ability to rule by imperial decree, as has been done in the Realm for centuries. All of this was done under the pretense of codifying laws and political power, but it is nothing more than attempting to put the rule of mortals over the §Ydivine will of Concord§!. The Realm is slowly losing the religious foundations that made it so wonderful and stable, and nokirin outside of my followers seems to care. We were a squabbling mess of petty tribes and villages before The Way of Fire saved us all. What is to stop us from returning to this dreadful way of life should we forget the importance of its five tenets?\n\nIn time, I believe the kirin of Kiria will see the truth of what Fickle Current and his allies are: corrupt and godless businesskirin §Yonly in it for themselves§!. The people of Kiria will stop them from turning the Realm into their plaything, of that, I am sure. But what I am less sure about is the subversive activities of the heretic, §YRising Sun§!. From the moment she entered Vermilion, I knew that she had but one goal on her mind: to destroy The Way of Fire and replace it with her own heresy that she calls §YThe Rising Fire§!. She and her misguided followers believe that their individual communities share a deeper connection with Concord than our divine Matriarch, that the word of the Goddess Herself can be deciphered by the common kirin instead of needing the interpretation of educated and trained priests and scholars. Though she did her best to hide it today, I am sure that this harlot sees the weakening of our Matriarch's authority as a blessing, a way to weaken the righteous grasp of The Way of Fire over the Realm, allowing her to spread her heresy far and wide.\n\nWhat concerns me most about Rising Sun is her §Ycunning§!. Any sensible and respectable kirin would immediately denounce heresy against Concord, but Rising Sun has managed to trick countless thousands of kirin into following her beliefs. Her mind is sharp, her tongue quick, and her eyes seem to see everything at once. I have seen her work at the Plenum ever since our §Yhopeless Premier§! mistakenly saw fit to allow her delegation to participate. She is shrewd and cunning, and plays off of the other delegations to get what she wants. She pretends to support The Way of Fire and the Matriarch when it is convenient, and abandons them when it is not. All the while, her supporters campaign in the city, ever-deepening their entrenchment in the capital of the Realm. Were that I had the power of the first Matriarch, §YIridescent Dawn§!, who could subdue foes with her words and whose talents of theology and rhetoric were unmatched in all the Realm, who could talk a nirik out of their rage when all other methods fail. Were that I could use her skills to dismantle this heretic sect on the Plenum floor, to make the rest of the Realm see how close we are to falling to heresy. Every second that we entertain The Rising Fire is another moment it has to strengthen its position. Something has to be done sooner rather than later. Otherwise, §Yall is lost§!."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_2_entry_3_CONTENT:0 "Today, I returned home to my mountain village of Agate for some much-needed rest and reflection. The challenges of the Plenum are numerous, compounded by the fact that the clarity of our Matriarch's mind is confused and confounded by §Ythose who seek to trick her§! for their own gain. I am, of course, primarily talking about Fickle Current and his NAKP cronies, but I have complained about the stallion too much already. I would rather focus on more pleasant thoughts tonight.\n\nAgate has not changed much since last I visited, despite the impressive progress of the §YGrand Gallop Onward§! in modernising almost every facet of our lives. The monastery is still quiet as ever, with long periods of quiet, peaceful meditation in the gardens during the day accompanied by wind chimes and birdsong. At night, the fireworks pop and sparkle with a rainbow of bright and beautiful colors in §YConcord's honor§!, illuminating the stone square on the mountainside where we gather to sing her praise. But even here, the passage of new decrees is plainly visible. Kirin who were but colts and fillies when I descended to Vermilion in service to the Matriarch years ago are now grown mares and stallions, and many of them have answered Matriarch Rain Shine's §Ycall for aspirant Vanguards§! to join her in Vermilion. Before they would do so, however, they will first venture to the Noctilucent Forest in the borderlands for intense and harrowing training. I have seen how such training hardens the hearts and souls of many a kirin before them, so I took it upon myself to honor these kirin with Concord's blessings before they depart. As I rubbed the holy ashes across their head scales and across the stripes of their horns, I could only think back to when these brave souls were but foals scampering across the monastery grounds. I had known them all, and had the honor of teaching them our holy tenets and Concord's divine guidance as they grew up. §YStone Cleft§! had always been strong and clumsy, but had a tender kindness to his heart that left him with only friends and without enemies. §YFire Whip§! was lithe, cunning, and temperamental, but she always stood by those she trusted and respected, and I know she will make an excellent Vanguard. And then there's §YFirefly§! and §YDragonfly§!, the inseparable pair of brother and sister who did everything together, from mischief as little foals to proudly serving their Matriarch. They and the others I blessed today are some of the best and brightest kirin I know, and though I worry for the hardships they will soon face, I know that they will triumph over them all and bring honor to the Realm.\n\nAs I placed the ashes on the last kirin, I stepped back and asked them a simple question: who do you fight for? Without hesitation, they all answered that they fought for the §YMatriarch Superior and Concord§!. Even though it was the answer I expected, it still left me deeply pleased and relieved to hear it. These kirin will not be beholden to the self-serving interests of Fragrance, nor the squabbling Plenum, nor the Morning Secretariat and its factional politics, and certainly not the heretics of The Rising Fire. They are loyal to Concord and the Matriarch first and foremost, and no temptations shall lead them away from the path of righteousness and honor. They will charge into battle carrying a hoofwritten anthology of Concord's divine teachings and tenets, never forgetting that it is because of Her glory and guidance that the Realm was created, and in that, §YI feel proud§!. They serve as an ever-important reminder that the work I do in Concord's name is important, and so long as my brothers and sisters in the faith similarly remember our devotion to our Goddess, we will be able to protect Kiria from the forces of unchained modernisation that threaten to §Ydestroy it§!."

I appreciate that she takes her position §Ymuch more seriously§! than Autumn ever did. Reciting Equestrian talking points will always be outwitted by Fern's more sensible approach, for she she is mercifully slow in speech and thoughtful in all things, able to compromise and concede to make her betters compromise and concede. Fortunate I am that we met not as rivals but as §YRain Shine's humble subjects§!.\n\nAnd in those meetings, we discussed §Ythe extraordinary declaration§!, specifically that its stipulations would sanction the The Way's chaplains and mystics-commander under various Banners to §Yutilise any means to extract information§! from captured Rising soldiers and to §Ypunish them for their insolence§!, with the further two-fold purpose of safeguarding the §Yspiritual integrity§! of both our troops on the field and Concord's children worried at home. I even went so far as to suggest a clause in which these officers can §Yexecute§! a heretic should the need arise, again for that purpose of spiritual integrity. In this, the Way of Fire has made a major victory for §Ythe preservation of Kiria's soul§!, now supremely empowered against the Rising Fire.\n\nYet this declaration §Ydisparages my own soul§!. Is it not extraordinary in its brutality, in its §Yruthlessness§!? What I have achieved, then, is also total, utter §Ydefeat§!. Plenty of kirin we were supposed to tend to §Yhave fallen to the Rising Fire§!, but the heretics did not suddenly pounce upon them with their vile doctrines. They §Yunderstood the needs of the kirin§!, catered to them, lived with them on the ground. We may be learned, well-read on divine precepts, §Ybut who did the starving foal remember?§! Long after the Silence befell these lands, who banded the western villages together to share Concord's blessings in the midst of Her wrath? For these kirin, some of whom could not have survived the Silence without their help, being able to live and to experience (if falsely) §Ya Concord that is within reach§! is better than a thousand arguments from one of our wise scholars. We, as the Way of Fire, have failed in articulating why our orthodoxy is orthodoxy and how we ought to live with that orthodoxy in mind.\n\nSo, having failed that, we enforce our truth not with its §Yunassailable self-evidence§! to all, but with §Yfrail and brittle blades and bullets§!.\n\nYes, I can blame Rising Sun for igniting this inferno of grief and suffering, but I also wonder §Yif Rising Sun feels the same way§! about all this.

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_2_entry_12_CONTENT:0 "Long ago, I wrote after praising Concord for lifting the Silence, §Y"did we learn our lesson the first time?"§! Back then, we had much to prove. The conveniences of modernity lurked and §Ysought to devour§!, armed to the teeth with lures and traps with which to spirit us away. I was sceptical of Autumn Blaze as Imperial Premier: she had to contend with me, Rising Sun, and Fickle Current, among other §Yconflicting interests§!. And who was Autumn? A mare from Massicot who §Ydropped out§! of her temple studies, who then proceeded to critique the ongoing Silence? A mare whose claim to fame was §Yplaying Vermilion tour guide§! to two wayward Equestrians? I wondered if the Matriarch choosing Autumn was §Yanother test§! from Concord.\n\nBut today, §YI am glad to be proven wrong§!, for Concord has resurrected Kiria through this very mare, and has humbled the proud like me for believing that Concord was not powerful enough to sow this great change through this unassuming name. But before I get to the heart of the matter, I must talk about the head: §YAutumn Blaze did not lead the Realm out of the Silence by herself§!. The Way of Fire played a central role in ensuring that, among the dizzying number of avenues we suddenly found ourselves presented with, we were §Yled down the straight and narrow§!. When Fickle and his associates asked us for deals and investments, I asked for temperance, but they have also shown me how kirin's lives can be §Yimproved with inventions and ideas§! imported from across the world; when Rising and her followers asked us to reconsider core tenets, I declined on the surface of it, but I stayed and listened for the underlying §Ypoints of pain§! experienced by §Ythose of much lower stations§! than mine. Through it all, there was Autumn. When I told her of a policy or a movement was progressing too speedily, Autumn was ready to say yes but had something else to offer: a test against tradition, or rather what I thought was tradition but instead §Ya grown-in aberration§!, an accretion of corruption in interpreting Concord. The Kiria of five centuries ago was not the same as the Kiria of today, and if the Way of Fire was right, our core faith would still prove true, §Yjust manifested in new ways§!.\n\nThus, some things must enter §Ythe winter of their life§!. The Hierocracy is fast fading, but while I shall miss it dearly, we have no need for it. Us mystics and priestesses shall continue the work we have done since the beginning. Autumn knows that without faith in Concord and the Matriarch, there is no Kiria, and apart from the scales and horns we share as creatures, what makes us Kirian is this §Ypiety and faith§! that let us stand heroically in the world as a great flame for others to model themselves after. No longer shall they call us these political terms like "conservative" or "traditionalist"; instead, we are to be §Ysages like those of old§!, having matured into something greater than the glories of your youth, able to understand everything. In this, Autumn is a sage, too, for she has somehow woven every line of kirin living into §Ya great whole§!. The many pigments and dyes rolled into one, §Yan assembly of singers in disconnected tunes turned into a symphony§! that no ear has heard until now.\n\nWhich leads me to §Ythe heart of the matter§!. A few weeks ago, Autumn begged me to go on tour to see a renewed Kiria. In her words, "you gotta get out of stuffy old Vermilion some day!" Not paying heed to her ignorance of how often I did go out of Vermilion from time to time, I took her request and §Ytravelled§! with a few select mystics to see the Realm in its resurgent glory. Now, I am by no means a cloistered flame, but the difference between the Kiria of the Silence and Kiria as of the present is §Ynight and day§!. Like everyone else, I was born when the Silence was well underway, and of the times when Kiria was holy before then, I only heard of by words and stories passed down. Today, everywhere I look, §Yit is as if my ancestors have come back to life§!, treating me with smiles and approval of how Kiria has returned to Concord in many new forms: the cities flourish with activity and life, the ports teem with trade and excited foreigners, the villages blossom with innocent camaraderie, and the shrines and temples are as full as they had reportedly been during Iridescent Dawn's reign. §YI even attended a Rising Fire ritual§!, if from afar, just to sate my curiosity; when the service was over, I still inwardly denied their assumptions about Concord, but I could not deny the friendliness and openness of their congregation, §Yfostered by the belief that Concord is not to be locked away§! in some inaccessible place or creature but §Yis to be talked to in the here and now§!, a caring Mother who travels incredible distances to be with every one of Her children.\n\nSo I end with this: It is for Autumn, along with everyone else she has strung along, that §YI thank Concord and the Matriarch Superior§!. §YThe true meaning of harmony§!, of peace with ourselves and each other and Concord, §Yhas been found in Autumn§!."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_3_entry_1_CONTENT:0 "It is still surreal to me that I am now living in my ancestral motherland. I may have been born in Skyfall and spent the better part of 54 years of my life in Griffonia and Equus, but §YKiria§! has always tugged at my heart from afar. I grew up hearing stories from my grandfather about the country he left behind and the family he had to say goodbye to, and though those memories are tinted rose with the passage of time, the stories he told were not happy ones. §YThe Silence§! destroyed his successful trading company and uprooted so many kirin like him, kirin who fled across the world to find a better life than the life the Matriarch and The Way of Fire forced upon them at home. Those who did not flee were left destitute in the apocalyptic aftermath of economic suicide; who knows how many relatives my family once had who have faded into §Yobscurity and squalor§! because they could not flee to Griffonia like my grandfather did? I have thought many times about reconnecting with distant relatives who spent their entire lives living in The Silence instead of abroad, but always decided against it. What family I have lived in Griffonia with me, not in Kiria, and those that lived here would only be asking for hoofouts from a §Ysuccessful businesskirin§! who made his fortune in more opportune places.\n\nBut now that I have returned to Kiria, there is much work to be done. Foremost among these tasks is bringing back §Ythe diaspora§! and making sure that their voices will be heard in the reconstruction of our nation. Kiria is hopeless without her foals educated abroad, foals who have gone on to be successful capitalists, industrialists, scientists, inventors, entrepreneurs, and more in nations that appreciated their talents. From the moment I arrived in Kiria, I have spent as much time as I can afford trying to reach out to the diaspora and §Ybring them home§!, and my labors have thus far borne many fruits. Just last night, I concluded a party in Fragrance where I brushed shoulders and exchanged words and promises with many of these lost sons and daughters of Kiria. In exchange for their financial support, I promised them §Ylucrative contracts§! and business deals in the resurgent Realm to make their time and money worth the investment. I have indebted myself under a mountain of favors, but like any good businesscreature, I am good at finding ways to get others to hoof the bill. §YMatriarch Rain Shine§! and the rest of the government will make excellent patrons to exchange these favors with; after all, everything I do for the Realm benefits them greatly.\n\nSoon, my vision, and the vision of the Realm's lost foals, will emerge triumphant over this period of reform. We are all organized, disciplined, connected, and funded in a way that no other kirin in this Realm is, even our Matriarch. We will be Kiria's saviors, and as such, we will make sure that we are amply rewarded... §Ywhen the time comes§!."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_3_entry_2:0 "The Charter of Rights"
KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_3_entry_2_CONTENT:0 "It pleases me to see the progress we've made in modernizing the Realm when we have the right kirin to guide the process. Our latest victory was the §YCharter of Rights§! that I saw passed through the Plenum. Kiria's legal system was a mess, but what is to be expected of a §Yhopeless theocracy§!? The nation was held together by hundreds if not thousands of vague religious rulings and conflicting interpretations of Concord's divine will. This made it very hard for any enterprising kirin to maneuver in the system; what one mystic thinks is acceptable may be completely unacceptable to another, and in disputes such as these, mystics and priests immediately defer to their higher authority without question. In most cases, that ends up being the §YMatriarch Superior§!, giving her ultimate decision making authority over the Realm. But now with the Charter of Rights passed, §YThe Way of Fire§! no longer holds such absolute authority over the land. The Charter is a single codified document free of confusing and vague religious statutes that explicitly lays down the word of law. Of course, I made sure that such a Charter was not §Ytoo restricting§! in its legalese. There is space to maneuver, semantics to exploit, and technicalities to find, all perfectly legal within the law for a kirin clever enough to find them. I even managed to score crucial victories for §Yprivate property rights§!, freeing much of a kirin's wealth and assets from mandatory tithes to The Way of Fire, a useless tax that would cripple investments and incentives for any business trying to operate in the Realm. This has been, undeniably, a win for §Ycapitalism§!, and the future of Kiria is looking bright.\n\nBut there is always room to improve. A good businesskirin will not settle for reducing their taxes to 20%, when they could instead be 15% with enough pushing and prodding. Despite the influence I wielded over the Charter, §YPremier Autumn Blaze§! and her allies still managed to include provisions for labor rights and civic freedoms. These are the sort of things that are good to have in a developed nation where they can be afforded, but Kiria is not a developed nation. We are poor and agrarian, and these reforms §Ystand in the way of progress§!. But at any rate, I only see them as temporary obstacles. Autumn is hopelessly outclassed by her job, and I cannot help but feel sorry for the poor mare. She is young and clueless to how the world works; she only earned the position because Matriarch Rain Shine feels §Yindebted§! to her for some reason. I fully expect her support to evaporate as she continues to blunder her way through the Plenum, and when that happens, I have enough support to replace her as the §Ynext premier§!. I'd do a much better job than her; that is something everykirin can agree with. And that also affords me the opportunity to make a few changes that benefit those who have given the most for the modernization of the Realm. I know many partners and connections who would benefit greatly if those labor rights were §Yremoved§! from the Charter, for instance..."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_3_entry_3:0 "An Honest Trade"
KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_3_entry_3_CONTENT:0 "Today, my friends in Fragrance Enterprise and myself met with the Equestrian delegation over the transfer of §Yship schematics§! and blueprints into our hooves. While the designs of the ships they gave us were outdated by their standards, and the fire control systems and battery schematics were similarly antiquated to the modern world, they obsolete the three ships we raised from Fragrance's harbor to the point where they'd only serve well as training dummies. But this transfer of knowledge wouldn't even be possible without the efforts of our §Ymisguided premier§! in befriending the Equestrians. Even though she may be hopelessly outclassed by the requirements of her job, even a broken clock is right twice a day, as they say. The deal is not perfect, of course; in exchange for these blueprints and schematics, we had to agree to give Equestria §Yprospecting rights§! for any resources that they find in Kiria, so in exchange for a one-time gift of obsolete knowledge, they earned themselves a steady stream of valuable raw materials to siphon out of our nation. This won't hurt us in the short term, as Kiria is so underdeveloped and improperly exploited that we do not have a lot of resources immediately on hoof for delivery. In essence, we're only exchanging a small fraction of an already pitifully small potential in this deal. But we will be stung in the §Ylong term§! if we do not find a way to renegotiate or renege on the deal as we properly exploit the resources of our lands. Equestria will gain an ever-growing share of our material output, sapping us of what should be ours by right.\n\nWhile the deal itself went off without any complications, I had an unfortunate encounter with the delegate by the name of §YApplejack§!, one of Autumn Blaze's friends and supposedly a member of the so-called §YElements of Harmony§!. I think she was supposed to represent Honesty if I recall correctly, which is a useful trait to have when negotiating a business deal, though I did not care all that much to properly commit it to memory. Magic artifacts are useful tools but their importance is increasingly diminishing in a modern era of technology and science. At any rate, the mare pulled me aside after the meeting and tried to give me a lecture about §Yproper cooperation§! with the other leaders of the Plenum. And though she did not outright say it, she implicitly accused me of using the Plenum for the benefit of my friends and myself over the benefit of the Realm. While she is correct that the path of modernization I wish to take Kiria on does directly benefit the returning diaspora like myself, it also stands to greatly benefit the Realm as a whole, and cooperation with my colleagues only comes when they meet me halfway. It is not fair for one party to bend over backwards to please an uncompromising partner, after all. I did try to explain this to her, but the mare must be part donkey—that would explain her stubbornness, at least. It seems that the only system she's willing to accept and understand is one that directly mimics the §YEquestrian model of Harmony§!, and anything else is completely foreign to her. Now, at least, I understand where Autumn Blaze learned her hopeless idealism from.\n\nProper cooperation with my peers does still remain an elusive ideal, I will admit, and not one that I can easily reach. Many of the ideas of the other cliques are §Ysimply incompatible§! with a modern Kiria, particularly the traditionalist nonsense that priestess Winter Frost spouts out during every session of the Plenum. I cannot afford to compromise with her too much, else I will lose the backing of my followers and supporters. They wish to see a §Yproperly modernized§! Kiria, not one laden with the burden of outdated religious philosophy, and if I am perceived to be too weak, then I will be ousted as the NAKP's leader. Even in this, life is like a business, and an incapable executive must be replaced for the good of the company. Only in this case, the company is the country, and it cannot have a weak executive board if it is to prosper and be profitable. I will have to be careful to find the right balance between §Ycompromise and dissent§! if I am to steer the fortunes of both Kiria and myself to a more profitable tomorrow."

But as Chairkirin of the NAKP, it is under my direction that Fragrance marches forward to a new era and a brighter tomorrow. I have done everything I can to make that dream a reality, and perhaps no step has been more important than the plebiscite we have just concluded throughout the north.\n\nThe plebiscite to guarantee the self-determination of the kirin of §YGreater Providence§!, those of us living north of the Great Mellifluve's watershed, was a risky step forward. I had no idea how Vermilion would respond, but I had hoped that §YMatriarch Rain Shine§! would allow her subjects to make their own decisions on whether to answer directly to her in Vermilion or seek their autonomy they so craved. But the success of the vote has laid those fears to rest. An §Yoverwhelming majority§! of kirin voted to follow the leadership of Fragrance and the NAKP into a new golden age, one free from the backwards traditions and superstitions in Vermilion, and the Matriarch, regardless of her feelings on the matter, will not attempt to overturn the results. Now, the kirin of Greater Providence will be ours to look after and lead into the future, and that is likely to prove an §Yeven more daunting task§! than organizing and conducting the plebiscite ever was.\n\nBut despite it all, I remain convinced that the efforts of the NAKP and the good kirin of Fragrance will show the Matriarch that our cause is just and will, ultimately, serve the §Ygreater good§! of the realm. The Matriarch has much on her hooves right now, with the trouble caused by §YThe Rising Fire§! in the west; if Rain Shine does not want to see her realm completely shatter beyond repair, it is in the best interests of both parties for the NAKP to take a more active leadership role in Greater Providence and ease the administrative burden on a theocracy that has not suffered infighting for §Yfive hundred years§!. Now that the north has our independence, we will be willing and able to aid Vermilion in the fighting against §YRising Sun§! and her band of heretics, and when the dust settles, the Matriarch will owe us a debt, and one that I intend to leverage. I intend to negotiate with Rain Shine on §Yuniting the realm once more§!, but on my terms, not hers.

But regardless of any actions taken by Vermilion, we pushed on with the vote, and were rewarded with a resounding success.

Therefore, I have had to frame the goals and ambitions of the NAKP through a lens that is palatable to the country folk who still worship her divine status as §YConcord's avatar on earth§!. Greater Providence, led by the strong hoof of the NAKP, will prepare to defend itself from the hedonists and reactionaries in Vermilion and the violent heretics in Chrysanthemum, and we will march south to Vermilion to §Y'rescue'§! the Matriarch Superior.

But, unfortunately, my latest political effort is one such failure. I had staked so much on its success, as had so many of the lost foals of Kiria now returned to their ancestors' lands. Alas, it seems it was not meant to be.\n\nIn Skyfall, my friends and I, all the sons and daughters, grandchildren and great-grandchildren of kirin who fled the Realm at the start of The Silence, dreamed of one day §Yreturning home and making our mark on Kiria§!. We were predominantly descendants of northerners, from cities like Fragrance, Rhapsody, and Radiance. All of these places were cities and cultural centers §Ydistinct from the kirin of the heartlands§!, outside of the watershed of the Great Mellifluve that defined the rest of the country. We dreamed of returning home and carving out an identity for ourselves, giving birth to the state of §YGreater Providence§!, so-called because of its unity around the greatest of the northern cities, Fragrance; in Providence, Rhapsody's Demesne. At the helm of the NAKP following our split from Vermilion, I thought I had the means to make such a dream a reality. But it turns out that such a dream was merely the dream of §Yforeigners§!. The local kirin of the land, those who have lived here throughout The Silence, wanted little part of our ideas brought in from abroad.\n\nThe plebiscite to settle the issue on the proposed §YNorthern Compact for Self-Determination§! was a colossal failure. We failed to secure the vote margins we needed to claim overwhelming victory, and as such, there was no unified movement in the north to secede from Vermilion and join ranks with Fragrance. Without the support of the rest of the north, my dream of Greater Providence may never materialize. And, to my great shame and embarrassment, Vermilion has already begun to §Ycrow about its victory§! and cite the loss in the plebiscite as proof that Fragrance and the NAKP do not speak for the north. The road ahead to our dream of a Greater Providence remains rough and rocky, and though the NAKP will stagger on and attempt to rebound from this loss, I am ashamed to admit that §YI remain in the throes of melancholy§!.

Back in Griffonia, my compatriots and I would talk about all the changes we would bring to the home of our forefathers, and how we would stamp out the rotten mysticism that led to the Realm falling into such a deplorable state over the past century. §YBut times have changed, I feel.§!\n\nWhen the War of the Double Secession began in the ruins of the Grand Gallop Onward, there were many in the upper echelons of the NAKP, myself included, that felt §Ywar with Vermilion was inevitable.§! After all, the kirin of Greater Providence are rather unlike our cousins in the Realm's heartlands. Throughout our history, the kirin of the north have been excluded from the watershed of the Great Mellifluve river, and the sometimes testy history of Vermilion's dominion over Fragrance and Rhapsody has helped foster §Ya separate cultural identity§! that the north is only now beginning to embrace. The kirin of Greater Providence, spurred on by ideas the Diaspora has brought back from Griffonia and Equus, are undergoing a §Ycultural revival§! led by Fragrance and myself. And in a Realm that has only known one master for centuries, many assumed that we would have to settle our differences with Vermilion through force of arms.\n\nBut, to everykirin's surprise, §Ywe have not.§! Once, I dreamed of using the NAKP to aid in imposing my vision of the future on the Realm whether it wanted it or not. But instead, the kirin of Greater Providence have surprised us all by urging us to find the more rational and moderate approach toward reconciling our differences with Vermilion and claiming the independence that we have long desired. And as it turned out, when we finally arranged to discuss our differences with the government in Vermilion, we were pleasantly surprised to find that we were each willing to abide by the idea of §Ylive and let live.§! Did I think it would ever come to this? I would be lying if I said I did. But am I pleased with how it has turned out? Quietly relieved that war with Vermilion was averted? Yes, I do think I am.\n\nWar is a dangerous gamble for all parties involved. It is expensive, destructive, and devastating. Could we have gained more by forcing the issue with Vermilion and taking up arms? Of course we could have. But we also could have §Ylost everything we had§!. A disastrous failed war with Vermilion would have all but crushed the dream of a cultural awakening of Greater Providence and the realization of our shared future, and the dream may never have risen from the ashes again. Instead, like any shrewd businesskirin, we negotiated a deal that benefited all parties, and it has left us with a secure foundation to build our future upon.\n\nBut can it be so cut and dry? Even though we avoided war with Vermilion, there is a large cross-section of our populace that wanted it. And war fever, once whipped into a frenzy, §Yis not so easily dispersed.§! Many kirin in the north, practically foaming at the mouth for the opportunity to destroy Vermilion, now find themselves in an awkward peace, nationalism and jingoism shoved aside in favor of curbing our losses and cutting a deal. I have no doubt in my mind that these next few years will be dedicated towards dispelling §Ynationalist discontent and inevitable unrest.§! The promise of peace and prosperity will keep things sane for now, but as time passes, the memories of what war and death actually are will fade, and there will be those who insist that there is more to be gained through war than there is to be lost. But they are wrong; war is nothing more than a §Yvicious cycle of barbarity§!, where needless death and destruction quashes progress and stifles commerce. Perhaps it is a miracle that I and the NAKP were able to prevent it from happening to us, too.\n\nBut I suppose now is not the time to think about what could have been, and what we narrowly avoided. We must focus on the future and the opportunity we have secured and invested in.

The latest reminder was in the form of a special report I received from the Working Group for Statistics and Analysis on the recent actions of a commando detachment tasked with destroying munitions and supplies in Vermilion. While the commandos were successful in their task, they were unexpectedly attacked during their exfiltration by a few dozen of what the survivors called §Y'clockwork stallions'§! which were immune to the blades and small-arms fire of the team. These clockwork machinations had weapons of their own, including small arms, and the commandos suffered heavy losses in the attack before they were able to disengage.\n\nWhen I read the report, the stories of the §YSlaughter at Sunrise§! came back to me. I was ignorant of this ugly story in the Realm's history, but some of my friends who maintained closer ties to our shared homeland told me about it some time ago. Sunrise was a small holdout of the Artificers' Guild during the imposition of §YThe Silence§! during Matriarch Noctilucent Charm's tyranny that had flourished with a constant stream of inventions that pushed the boundaries of what technology was capable of. From things like thaumaturgical batteries that could supercharge a kirin's telekinetic ability, to processing machines that were comparable with the best computational devices that money can buy today, and everything in between, they embodied the spirit of progress that the NAKP champions, and their descendants, today's Artificers' Guild, pride themselves on. Among their finest works were the §Yclockwork legions§!, soldiers of brass and glass that were unbreakable and unstoppable in their time, but unfortunately too few in number to save Sunrise. A secretive paramilitary group reportedly named the §YBanner of the Covered Cage§! attacked the town without warning, slaughtering everykirin inside and destroying or burying as many of the Guild's technologies that they could find. One can only imagine how much was lost in this attack by paramilitary reactionaries, and how much further the Realm could have been along today had Sunrise prospered and the Silence failed earlier.\n\nStill, it is with some bemusement that I must note the irony in the Realm seeking aid in the buried and forgotten relics that Matriarch Rain Shine's own mother sought to destroy during her reign. Am I worried? No. Impressive as they may be, these are inventions a §Ycentury past their time.§! Technology and weaponry has improved since the age of flintlocks and blackpowder. These delicate, intricate constructs of glass and brass cannot stand up to withering heavy machine gun fire, or mortar bombardment, or the crushing treads of armored vehicles. What the NAKP represents is §Yinnovation and progress.§! Vermilion has dredged up these relics from the old days, but what we already have now is superior to theirs. This is what makes us different: the NAKP actively creates and strives to make new, progress and innovation for its own sake, while Vermilion disdains technological progress as a threat to stability and their own control over the Realm, instead content to feed, parasitical, off of the fruits of the labor of others. This is why they shall fall, and the NAKP will lead the Realm into the §Yprosperous future it deserves.§!"

Vermilion had finally fallen to our forces after fierce resistance from the Way of Fire loyalists and their allies, and the chaos of warfare and the damage of thousands of nirik galloping amok through the streets has left the city in a sorry state, but I made sure that §Ythe Vermilion Palace was to be unscathed§! and the most severe punishment would befall any unit that engaged in combat with the Matriarch's personal guard. Indeed, when the city had all but fallen to our forces, the Iron Chrysanthemum established a defensive perimeter around the palace to protect it from looting and make sure that the Matriarch could not be smuggled out by her bodyguards. Not that it would have been easy to smuggle out a mare twice as tall as the rest of us, but it was absolutely critical that the Matriarch remained exactly where she was until we were ready.\n\nAnd today, we finally were. After exchanging messages with the defenders of the palace, we negotiated safe passage for myself, Cypress Snow, and several other NAKP grandees to see the Matriarch personally. We entered with my own company of bodyguards, passing by haggard defenders and hundreds, if not thousands of civilians that had fled to the safety of the palace when the fighting began. They watched us with fear, some hate, but I think most present was an overwhelming sense of relief that §Ythe fighting was over§! and they could try to return to the normalcy of their lives without the fear of bullets and mortars raining down on them. There is much work to be done to rebuild the Realm, but I will not deny them that much if it means their future cooperation with the party.\n\nAs for the meeting with Rain Shine itself, it happened in the throne room, surrounded by the members of her personal banner, far more disciplined and stalwart than some of the soldiers of the most professional armies in the world, and wholly loyal to her word. The throne room itself was grand and opulent, but not nearly as much as I had remembered; a hole in the roof and damage to the intricate carvings along the walls and the ceiling of the antechamber had been the results of a §Ystray mortar§! that had hit the palace. As for Rain Shine herself, she had dressed herself in her finest raiments, though I noticed a linen bandage peeking out from under the collar of her dress; perhaps she was in the throne room when the mortar hit and suffered injury to her person as a result, and I could only thank the heavens, and Concord if she would hear my words, that the Matriarch had not been killed in the fighting. §YUnifying the Realm would be impossible were she to perish.§!\n\nI have no need to record what was said between us; I read from a prepared statement that the NAKP had captured Vermilion and liberated the Matriarch from the twin forces of decadence and heresy, and it would be through our strength and wisdom that the Realm would be saved from those who had corrupted and ruined it. I said that the NAKP humbly requests the Matriarch to §Yreclaim her position as leader§! of the kirin people in all properly flowery and respectful language as decorum demanded, and Rain Shine gave her assent. What I find more interesting than the words were the emotions of the Matriarch herself. While she appeared perfectly regal, maintaining the otherworldly divide that separates her from the rest of kirinkind as Concord's avatar in this world, I could tell behind the neutral mask she wore that §Yshe was furious.§! After all, why wouldn't she be? The government and she had entrusted to her friend, §YAutumn Blaze§!, had been toppled through war, and the task of the Grand Gallop Onwards unfulfilled. To her, I and the rest of the NAKP are the enemy, the kirin who stole the Realm from her, and no amount of false proclamations of loyalty and humility to her will change that. She knows that she will serve little more as our §Yfigurehead§!, a symbol to parade around the Realm that the NAKP are the rightful rulers of Kiria. I am only grateful that she assented through the farce and played along; were she to refuse, fighting would have resumed in Vermilion, and if the Matriarch dies, then there is nothing holding the kirin people back from the §Ywarlordism and nirik rampage§! that plagued our lands before the Way of Fire. I think she agreed because she knew there was no other choice, and if she refused to play along, far, far more of her subjects would die in the chaos, and the Realm itself might have very well burnt to the ground.\n\nBut what is done is done now, and this marks an important step in bringing the nastiness of the civil war behind us. With Vermilion under our control and the Matriarch in our pocket, it is only a matter of time before the §Yflames are extinguished and peace returns once more§!."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_3_entry_10_CONTENT:0 "As I prepare to get some rest tonight and prepare to enjoy the weekend for a change, my thoughts drift back to a meeting I had today about the state of the §YThousand-Banner System§! that has long been the backbone of the Realm's military. Cypress Snow led the meeting and I was able to sit back and listen, as once I did when he gave his seminars back at the Cafe de Fiori in Bruma, when my future was still full of many 'ifs' and not as many 'whens'. The meeting was part discussion, part history lesson. The Thousand Banners were a military caste of hereditary warriors and officers who fought for the Vermilion Dynasty, but §YThe Silence§! scattered them to the winds of the Realm. Most never recovered, simply disappearing into history, but a few survived until the modern day, despite the odds. These were the banners which still retained the 'Traditional Four Facets' of a true Banner: political, economic, familial and military. When the §YAutumnal Premiership§! attempted to restructure the Vermilion Banner Army by forming infantry divisions bestowed with the titles and trappings of banners, despite most lacking any descendants of banner families in their ranks, and despite lacking any of the political-economic power or martial legacy that came with them, it created a chimera of an army that had one hoof in the past and one in the future with little connecting them in the present. They were §Ywasteful, disorganized, and ill-prepared for combat§!, as they unfortunately found out in the middle of the war. The banner armies Vermilion fielded styled themselves after ancient banners while trying to mesh Griffonian ideas of military organization into them, which ultimately resulted in a chaotic and dysfunctional mess with an incoherent chain of command.\n\nOnly one banner truly remained by the time Autumn Blaze finished mangling the system into something grotesque, and that was the §YBanner of the Starred Taurus§!, who under the wisdom of the Bloom lineage, allied itself with the NAKP. As Cypress suggested that we move to officially dissolve the Thousand Banners system, and in the process remove the elements from our military that fought for Vermilion and are now traitors, Dr. Ardent Bloom worriedly asked if an exception would be made for the Starred Taurus. I know enough about the stallion to know that this was not out of concerns of its history or legacy, but rather the §Yeconomic and political security§! of the Bloom lineage. I suppose such concerns for the wellbeing of one's family are commendable, but typically selfish; he did not, after all, make any motions to protect the privileges of fellow bannerkirin and banner remnants that sided with the NAKP during the war. I have made sure to work that adjustment into the final draft of the decree we will present to Matriarch Superior Rain Shine for her to sign into law on our behalf. After all, keeping the rest of the banner remnants happy, even though §Ymost are industrialists or politicians now§! and not soldiers, will be a comfortable base of loyalty to build the ever-climbing ambitions of the NAKP upon.\n\nThat's an interesting thought: most of the senior bannerkirin who had joined the NAKP have already found ways to be wealthy and powerful independent of their bannerkirin status, primarily by being of use to the party. I personally know some who have foregone their banner identity to present themselves as industrialists, politicians, or proper military commanders first and bannerkirin second."

The building is only three stories tall and has a small selection of rooms, but each is well-stocked and more than sufficient for hosting small groups of NAKP executives. It's §Ybuilt to serve exactly its intended purpose§!, much like the rest of the town.\n\nBaobab is an artificial construction down to every last detail. Its spot was chosen specifically to control as much of the lawless western reaches of the Realm as possible, its buildings stout enough to withstand mortar fire, the grid-patterned boulevards wide enough to provide line of sight for snipers and machine gunners down numerous blocks. Baobab is a §Yfortress masquerading as a city§!, and that goes down to the kinds of kirin that will live in it. All of them are soldiers and their families, given free property in the town if they've served for a decade in our armed forces, or made available for a small subsidized rent if they're active duty or veterans who have not yet served that long.\n\nI watched this morning as the first of those inhabitants arrived in the town, carried in on gleaming half-tracks to the town square, where I delivered a short speech about the law and order they bring to the §Ylawless and orderless west§!. Being soldiers, I know that they will make Baobab successful. Hospitals and public services will be staffed by well-trained military personnel, and law and order will be maintained by a well-regulated citizens' militia that will police not only Baobab but the surrounding countryside as needed. Baobab represents the linchpin of our regional defense strategy: a town of soldiers, in essence a §Yself-sustaining military garrison§! that will be able to deploy its soldiers faster than our military to quell any local uprisings and unrest.\n\nNo more will we have to rely on rugged rangers attempting to police a lawless world where the sky is high and Vermilion is far away. Baobab was expensive to build, and the proof of concept was realized in a very short amount of time, but it is §Yonly the first§! of militarized settlements the party will construct in the west. Next on the docket are MilSet Iroko and MilSet Banyan, but these will be cheaper to build now that Baobab is more than just an idea on paper. Baobab, Iroko, Banyan, and all the MilSets that come after them will be the home of Kiria's new military class, the professional soldiery, the §Yproud successors§! to the legacy of the Thousand Banners. These incubators of iron discipline and military efficiency will raise new generations of professional soldiers, creating a self-sustaining and loyal fighting force to the Realm. In a few years' time, revolt and revolution will be a thing of the past, even this far away from Vermilion. Baobab, and the cities that come after it, will represent the physical embodiments of the new §YImperial Kirian state§! made manifest."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_3_entry_12_CONTENT:0 "§YDo I believe in myths?§! Well, I would at least say that what we know today as myths were born from true stories, warped and distorted over time from a hundred generations of imperfect translations and retellings. A modern myth may be full of fanciful and impossible elements, but there is likely still a kernel of truth buried somewhere inside, even if it has become buried under layer upon layer of fabrication, like the grain of sand at the heart of a pearl. One myth I never expected to find that grain of sand in was the creation of the kirin race, and to discover it in the midst of bitter war perhaps makes it even more profound.\n\nThe Sunshine Headlands were the location of much fierce fighting over the past months. The shelling of a particular hilltop occupied by our troops caused a landslide that revealed an §Yancient tomb§! that must have been several millennia old, buried beneath tons of rock and soil now displaced by the power of modern ordnance. It was not soldiers who found this tomb, but local survivors seeking shelter. Within the tomb they found a sarcophagus, and within that sarcophagus, an ancient skeleton. Tall, slender, and undoubtedly equinoid in nature, the skeleton lacked the scales of a kirin but possessed a long, curved, elegant horn embedded in its forehead. Now, of course there is the possibility of fakery, but the NAKP, upon hearing about this discovery, seized the skeleton and presented its horn to me. It is, without a doubt, the horn of an §Yancient eastern unicorn§!. This would be the first time the remains of an eastern unicorn have been found, and the proof of such a discovery lends surprising credence to an ancient kirin myth.\n\nThe myth predates the establishment of the Way of Fire in the Realm, a tale that the Way of Fire denounced as antithetical to the divine creation of the kirin race by Concord's hoof, and our role as her chosen custodians of the Primordial Flame that birthed the world. In that myth, the kirin race was created as §Tthe offspring of eastern unicorns and dragons;§! it explains our similarities to our unicorn cousins elsewhere in the world, and the fire and destruction that accompanies the rage of the nirik state. Questions of equinoid and draconic compatibility notwithstanding, it would explain our nature to some of our earliest philosophers who looked at the world and saw creatures so similar to us yet fundamentally different beyond the malleable borders of our warring states. It poses a curious academic question opening the door on a matter thought long closed, but it serves little use in a time of war like this. Perhaps the only question relevant now is how easily the war could have been won had we discovered the secrets of the eastern unicorns, and many, many more discoveries and ideas, instead of allowing the Way of Fire to §Ysuppress them in the name of religious supremacy.§!"

Truth be told, I should probably get back to writing that speech instead of distracting myself with my diary, but I've been working on it since dinner and need to take a quick break. Perhaps sketching my thoughts down into this book will help me better put words to paper.\n\nKiria has risen from the Silence, and at last, the damages from §Ydecades of mistake§! has been undone. The Realm is healthy and strong under the leadership of the NAKP, and I do not think even Matriarch Rain Shine can doubt that we've been far more successful in creating a strong Kiria than Autumn Blaze or Winter Frost ever would have. We have secured the legitimacy of our rule at home and backed it up with economic prosperity; now, we need to turn our attention outward. It is our destiny to be the §Yprotector of all kirin§!, from the griffon colonizers in the west, the tribal zebra of the south, and the growing deer threat in the north. Not only will we protect our people, but we will make it our mission to spread civilization beyond our borders, to conquer in Concord's name and to expand her demense. §YKiria shall have an Empire§!, and Vermilion shall, at long last, assume its rightful place alongside the other great powers of the world.\n\nIt is delusional to expect to succeed in our task by converting the people we conquer, though. The faith of Concord is a kirin faith, and those beyond the borders of the Realm are not kirin. They will not be her foals, nor will they be wards of the Matriarch and her Vermilion Throne. They will be subjects of the Empire, not Concord. It is not religion that we bring them, but §Yideology;§! these backwards nations shall have their markets opened to §Ythe Tael§!, development, and technology. They will provide the labor for the engines of progress, and as we lifted ourselves out of the Silence, so too we will now uplift our neighbors from their backwards ways. They will assuredly fight and struggle, but united under the Vermilion banner, the other races of Eastern Zebrica will be able to attain a portion of our glory. When we have all of Eastern Zebrica behind us, then we will be ready to make our presence felt on the world stage; not just in Zebrica, but §Yfuther abroad.§!"

Rising the ranks, earning promotions, watching investments blossom, that sort of thing. §YBut nokirin is ever safe from falling§!, no matter how mighty they may seem. Even the surest investments can suddenly go bankrupt, and those ever-rising numbers on the tickertape can suddenly go from positive to negative without warning. It's the calamity of being blinded by watching a line go up for so long that you miss the chance to sell high before the crash hits, and by the time you finally realize the dip isn't a dip at all, but a yawning chasm, you've already lost it all.\n\nThe NAKP was my investment. I cultivated it, shaped it into a powerful party, soliciting donations and support from the wealthiest kirin of the diaspora in the hopes of building it into the guiding force to shape the future of the Realm. §YAll I needed was for the Three and a Half Year Plan to stumble and fall.§! It seemed like a sure thing; after all, who could ever expect such dreams of grandeur to bear fruit? But when Autumn Blaze's vision for the future not only took root but blossomed and fruited, I missed my opportunity to course correct. She had done the impossible and united Kiria behind her, and now she charts the path forward, not the NAKP as I promised to the kirin I collected donations from. And there is a rule in speculation as true as in any gambling den: §Ynever play with somekirin else's money.§! When the NAKP's investors realized they were not going to get what I promised them after I took their money, well, the outcome was inevitable.\n\nAm I angered by it? Yes. It would be foolish to lie to my own personal recollections. I worked incredibly hard to grow the NAKP, and then it was stripped away from me because of our failings. It's the unfortunate side of business, after all. When business is booming, the CEO basks in the praise and rakes in the riches. When it's failing, however, the board will point their hooves at him and chase him out to prove to the rest of the shareholders that changes are being made. I ran the NAKP like a business, and so it treated me as a business would. My time is over, and those looking to capitalize on it acted. The cunning and opportunistic will always find a way to get what they want—I just didn't expect §Ykirin I called my friends to be the ones to pull the trigger.§!\n\nEven though their betrayal hurts, I cannot fault Cypress Snow and Ardent Bloom for acting to have me removed. Business is a cutthroat game, and they have their own necks to look out for, but they too may find that §Ythe market has changed too much to remain competitive.§! They'll likely try to follow behind Autumn and Vermilion, remaining relevant and treading water while they seek out new opportunities to expand, and in that endeavor I wish them luck. They will certainly need it. Cypress is old, and Ardent is bold; I don't think they have the instincts to survive in the direction Autumn is pushing the Realm in. In the meantime, a brief respite from the public eye will do me some good. Though it won't be mine to lead, I'll keep my seat at the table in the NAKP and maintain my connections. I'll write a book or two where I can shape the story of the NAKP under my guidance with my words before anykirin else can. I'll sit back and watch how Autumn Blaze and the NAKP perform under Cypress and Ardent, and if the chips go my way, kirin in the party will look at how it has decayed under their leadership and yearn for the days when I kept it competitive. From there, it won't be too hard to come out of the wilderness and make a play to retake control of the NAKP, or poach the talent like an executive leaving to set up a rival firm in their former employer's backyard. My ousting from the NAKP will only be a temporary setback. One day, kirin will realize that my vision of a §Ydisciplined, well-oiled, hyper-efficient Kirian state under the guiding hoof of the free markets§! wasn't the villain it was made out to be. My vision will turn the Realm into something worth investing in. After all, as any businesskirin knows, the best investments take time to generate dividends."

My fellow mystics and I have spent the past several weeks traveling along the new roads laid down in the §Yrural west§! of our realm, spreading the glorious news about §YThe Rising Fire§! and how we must adapt the tenets of Concord's faith to a new day. The Silence has taught all of us who follow The Rising Fire important lessons; namely, that we do not need a pyramidal religious order to understand her intentions, that we do not need the temptations of the modern age that turn us away from her glory, that we do not need the legal codes and shackles of some foreigner's ideas of governance to run our nation in defiance of Concord's will. Verdant and Chrysanthemum §Ythrived§! during The Silence, because we learned how to properly interpret and adapt Concord's intentions to the century of communal isolation that it bestowed on the realm. Common kirin organized in their communities, each finding their own meaning in Concord's creations, and working together for a truly classless and equal society can do more good for Kiria than §YThe Way of Fire§! ever could in the modern era. The doctrines of yesteryear belong in yesteryear, and they must modernize too along with the times if they are to hold sway in the future we proudly strive towards.\n\nWe have spread the news and beliefs of our doctrine to §Ycountless kirin§! on the roads we have traveled, and we have been repaid amply in the kindness of strangers and even by the government officials of our Matriarch Superior. Wherever we travel, somekirin is willing to offer us a place to stay for the night and a warm meal, as it is well known that to treat one of Concord's priests with kindness §Yinvites her blessings upon your household§!. And government officials give us alms and gifts, encouraging us to continue to spread the word about the end of The Silence and motivate the populace to rejoice. Though most do so perhaps mistakenly; they believe that we are priests of the old tenets of The Way of Fire, not mystics of The Rising Fire, and doubtless we would get into heated confrontations with them if they knew the truth; most officials from Vermilion I have gotten to know are §Yfairly dogmatic§! in their old beliefs, and would not react well to anykirin professing something some would see as §Yheretical§!. But what they do not know will not harm them, and it will make our lives easier as we continue to spread the word.\n\nWe have enlightened many converts today, just as we did the day before, and as we will continue to do tomorrow. We are the §Yforefront of a movement§!, the tip of the spear, and the fruits of our labor will one day be sweet to savor. Until then, we must do our best to make sure Concord's true divine will is heard throughout the nation."

Where once we roamed from town to town and village to village by hoof, the advent of modern transportation in the form of §Ythe railroad§! has greatly aided us in spreading the beliefs of The Rising Fire to the kirin of the realm. We can visit several towns in a day, whereas before we could only visit one town in several days, stopping at inns or farms along the road and speaking to only a hoofful of kirin before moving on. With such an efficient vector for proselytisation as the railroad, the Rising Fire is spreading §Yfaster than ever§!, and more and more kirin in more and more towns are finding the truth in our teachings. This is truly one of the greatest boons our movement has ever seen, and proves that modernization and The Rising Fire are made for each other.\n\nWhen night falls and the day's tracklaying has ceased, miniature shantytowns spring up at the end of the line. They are populated by an §Yentirely new class§! of kirin who are more than eager to embrace The Rising Fire. On any given day, I speak to tracklayers, coal miners, mechanics, and even prostitutes who populate these transient railside camps. Many are pleased to have a job free of the dull monotony of farming and fishing, but they also feel §Yinadequately rewarded§! for the services they provide by the foreign businesskirin who employ them. The work they do is backbreaking and dangerous, and yet they barely earn more than farmers and fishers do for their labors. The Way of Fire does not care for them, and would rather that they §Ynot exist at all§!, as the traditionalist mystics and priests are wary of the new developments happening in the Realm. But §YThe Rising Fire supports them§!; they provide important labor for their communities, and in the eyes of Concord, they are favored by her divine blessing. Under our teachings and guidance, they are helping to build communities that will appreciate their work and reward them amply. We will do what the leaders of the realm will not do: acknowledge them, recognize their troubles, and treat them as equals. Such is Concord's will, and such is my purpose on this earth.

It is a queer transition and one that I'm not used to, but it is proving to be more effective. Since the §YTransmission Office§! was opened to receive petitions from kirin all across the realm, my followers and I have spent our time writing letters on behalf of the common kirin throughout the Realm, acting as their representatives to petition the Matriarch Superior through the office. It is a change that benefits the common kirin more than their leaders at the §YPlenum§! would believe. The Office of Transmission is designed to serve as a direct interface for the Matriarch to hear from her subjects when they cannot make the journey to Vermilion to petition her in person, but a large portion of our nation is still §Yilliterate§!, meaning it is useless to them. My fellow mystics and I are all literate by our training and education, and so we visit these kirin, put their complaints and desires onto paper for them, and make sure that they are received by the §YMatriarch herself§!.\n\nThis has been a great boon to the commoners, as otherwise, they lack the necessary influence to make their voices heard, especially by the leaders of the Plenum. Priestess Winter Frost is insular and myopic, and sees any kirin speaking out about how The Way of Fire has failed them as §Yheretic rabble to be ignored§!. Fickle Current is indifferent; he is foreign-born and foreign-educated, and sees himself above the afflictions and desires of the commoners, viewing them only as §Ytools to be used§! for his own personal gain. And Premier Autumn Blaze, though well-intentioned and caring, is naive and inexperienced, and simply §Ylacks the awareness and knowhow§! to address this problem. The harsh realities of modernization are leaving us common kirin behind, and so somekirin must serve as their herald and their champion. Just as I have always faithfully served §YConcord§!, so too shall I serve §Ythe poor and downtrodden§! of Kiria. And as they realize their voices are being heard and their complaints are being addressed, the common kirin of the Realm will remember who listened to them and who fought on their behalf, and they will remember that it was The Rising Fire that saved them—not §YThe Way of Fire§!."

Before, my followers and I had to make concessions, engage in petty palace politicking, backroom maneuvering, and more; all the tools of §Ythe Great Game§!, of which I am no novice. But back then, during the Grand Gallop Onward, every word I said was carefully chosen, every action taken carefully considered, and I had to hide my disdain for the kirin like §YWinter Frost§! behind sweet smiles and pleasant conversation. It was a sport I was good at, but it was tedious. But now, the game has changed, and I find myself in open rebellion against Vermilion, fighting tooth and nail with the deluded souls that cling to the hedonism of the Way of Fire, for all the good it has done the realm and the kirin who suffered under it. It is refreshing to share my words more openly with kirin who believe in what I have to say than to debate with those §Yblinded to the truth.§!\n\nBut now that the game has changed, my focus must likewise change by necessity. When we march into Vermilion, it shall herald a new age for the nation, a nation reborn under a §Ynew and revived§! Realm of Kiria. As Concord's foremost chosen and loyal First Priestess of the Rising Fire, only I have the knowledge and pious faith necessary to save the Realm and bring the faithful of Kiria back to peace and prosperity. My word shall be law, for I alone have been deemed truly worthy by Concord Herself to speak for Her, and nokirin—not naive and incompetent, §YAutumn§!, nor shameless reactionary §YWinter§!, nor slimy foreigner §YFickle§! will be able to stand in my way. I shall be free to shape Kiria in Concord's most blessed vision, and even Matriarch Superior Rain Shine §Yshall dance to my tune§!, for hers is a weak will, unfit to rule over all of kirinkind.

There is, and will remain, the matter of holding the Rising Fire together about me until I can accomplish my dream, the §Yrealization of Concord's will§! in Kiria. The Rising Fire is hardly a monolithic organization; there are many different ideas, opinions, and cliques that exist within its strata, many of which are at odds with each other, and only united through the arduous and righteous task we have ahead of ourselves. But when the Way of Fire has been defeated, and the foreigners sent back to distant shores, what happens then? My followers and the commonkirin throughout the Realm §Ygive me their implicit trust§!, but that does not mean I will control it forever. Their trust in me must remain when Vermilion is subjugated, and for Concord's will succeed, I cannot be displaced from Her holy mission. She has placed Her divine trust in me, has chosen me to be the executor of Her will, but that is not something that everykirin will acknowledge. Imagine what sorts of §Yterrible calamities§! will befall my beloved Realm should my work be started but left unfinished? The thought is too terrible to consider. When the stakes are the future of our nation, and even the future of our entire species, there can be no gambles, no unwarranted risks taken.

No longer shall the center of our governance be situated in one static location. Instead, our bureaucratic apparatus will gather their important documents, procure wagons and trucks where we can find them, and create a mobile command center so that our capital may always be on the move, to follow the charge of victory as we sweep aside Vermilion's dispirited resistance and serve as the administrative §Ytip of the spear§! to make the best and quickest reaction to any new developments on the front. If we are able to see the situation and react faster than Vermilion, then we will always hold the initiative, and whomever holds the initiative will be the eventual victor.\n\nIt is not without its risks, however. That I realize. Civil servants and penpushers don't make the best soldiers, and we will inevitably lose equipment, documents, and kirin on the long march around the country. There is a §Ygreat danger§! as well, in that if we move too close to the front lines, a desperate offensive by Vermilion could encircle our mobile capital and leave our forces leaderless and confused.

Having the capital follow me around will separate it from §Ythe weak willed§! who in my absence would set us about a ruinous path as they make decisions blinded to the true story at the front. We shall shed the dead weight, and only those who are truly loyal, truly faithful, truly devoted to the Rising Fire will be willing and able to keep up with me.

Everywhere along the front, the brave soldiers of the Rising Fire do everything they can to resist the onslaught of the false prophets, but still, our resolve remains unbroken. Bent, certainly, but broken, §Ywe are not§!.\n\nEven still, our preachers travel Kiria spreading the true word of Concord to anykirin willing to listen, even in the lands occupied by the heretic administration in Vermilion. It reminds me of my own travels §Ybefore the war§!, when the Grand Gallop Onward was just a thought and not a derelict reality. I remember wandering from town to town with my band of followers, stopping at inns or sympathetic faithful, and evading the harsh scrutiny of The Way of Fire and its many lapdogs, all the while preaching §Ythe true faith§!. Things were hopeful then. Kiria was awakening, and I believed that Concord had chosen me to be the spark that would ignite a new age for our people, rousing them into action and propelling us together into the glory of a new tomorrow. §YHow things have changed§!.\n\nThe kirin we send out into the country to preach and praise Concord are now tasked with another function: to incite outrage and revolt with incendiary rhetoric and carefully pointed questions. The spectre of Vermilion's oppressive retribution is the anvil upon which we beat the hammer of scripture, and between the two, §Ythe common folk of Kiria are tempered§! and ready to fight for their Realm. To the peasants, this must seem like the end of times, but rather, I see it as a new beginning. There is no beginning or end to Concord's holy creation, only periods of transition. Who is to say that the Primordial Fire that birthed our world was not the §Ydying flames of the last?§! Who is to say that, should the time come, §Your world will be born again§! in flames, if Concord wills it? That is what this war is, this struggle for Kiria. It is the rebirth of Kiria through holy fire, a new Primordial Fire, one that shall temper our faith and shape it into something new, something stronger. Fire, fury, and passion are not symbols of our failure, but §Ymetrics of our success§!, for the Realm could not be born anew without cleansing flame. That is what Concord wants for Kiria, and that is what we strive for. So we must give ourselves to the flames, nurture them, let them grow. And when all of Kiria burns like paper in a lantern, only then can a new future be written §Yfrom the ashes of the old.§!"

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_4_entry_7_CONTENT:0 "I held court today in a dingy bunker far enough away from the front line against the so-called Fraternal Republic to be safe, but close enough to hear the distant sounds of war. Ostensibly, being so close to the carnage was supposed to be a display of solidarity, that everyone is going through the same struggles. In reality, it only appeared that way.\n\nIn the middle of a discussion about the shipment of ammunition and medicine to the front, a soldier burst into the court and gave a report that stunned everyone into silence. She'd come across a Vermilion Banner regiment meant to spearhead through the lines, only, what she fought weren't Kirins, but clockwork golems made from shiny brass and impenetrable glass. Immune to small arms fire and blades of any kind, the soldier had to retreat again and again, leaving her wounded comrades behind to perish beneath the might of the automatons. But her unit prevailed over them, and to prove it she brought with her the serrated, esoteric blade she'd pried from the machine—a design nearly a century old, curved with an abrupt edge.\n\nVermillion had seemingly invoked the ghosts of the Silence. How they acquired these golems isn't important, the fact that the bourgeoise forces fear ours enough to stoop so low is. The fact that mettle triumphed over metal is. The soldier then said something that dumbfounded everyone in attendance: "The past will not defeat the future!"\n\nThat soldier couldn't be more correct. These golems are the very embodiment of the oppressive and exploitative past that the capitalists wish to uphold. They wish to turn every worker and every citizen into an unthinking and obedient machine. The lockstep march of these foreboding machines cannot stop the march forward through history. Nothing the capitalists do can change that, nothing they can do can keep me from the Vermilion Throne. Nothing will stop the new dawn of enlightenment and prosperity!"

Ha!\n\nThe indomitable belief of myself and my comrades in the divine righteousness of our cause sustained us through to the signing of an agreement. Well, that and the look on her face made all the endless hours of droning discussion completely worth it! Winter Frost from the Way of Fire, a few delegates from the RaHP, along with us agreed for the Matriach Superior to make a proclamation to all of Kiria.\n\nOh? What's that you ask? Just what would she be proclaiming? Why, it would only be a decree announcing the reconciliation between the Way of Fire and the Rising Fire. That both faiths, committed to the worship of Concord, would never find a reason to go to war against one another. She even called our faiths cousins! This will serve to codify the equality of our faith and Winter Frost's, legitimize both of our rights to exist, and to allow us to spread our faith! In other words, we're now just as much a part of Kirin society as they are!\n\nThe stick of threatened war and the carrot of the Path's full cooperation have accomplished more for the Rising Fire in a couple of hours than any amount of bloodshed could have in years.\n\nOf course, I'm not blind to the hardliners in the Way of Fire who see the Rising Fire as an affront to Concord and Kiria, or the fact that they happen to exert a lot of power over Winter Frost. They will never accept us, and it doesn't matter, because we do not need their approval to exist when the Matriarch Superior has decreed us equals. She has given them a pill, and they have to swallow it. Poor Winter Frost, having to not only take this humiliating compromise but endure the scorn and shame of those in her own camp. She can't even dare to criticize a decision the Matriarch Superior has made, and she cannot go against those within the Way of Fire. Her slavish devotion to tradition would make such an act comparable to drinking poison. This proclamation has placed her in an impossible position and I could almost feel bad for her. Almost.\n\nI'm also not blind to those in the Rising Fire who decry this decision as submission to the Matriarch, as satisfaction in coexisting with our decadent, fallen rivals. However, these voices aren't powerful, and they can be assured, as everyone in the faith can be, that this is only the first step. Today brings us Equality, who knows what tomorrow will bring? For now, the Rising Fire will accept this compromise and capitalise on every opportunity that comes our way to spread our faith as far as our voices can carry it."

The power struggle was beyond grueling, but any armed conflict would be far more grueling, take far longer, and accomplish far less.\n\nThis is why I don't take the fringe voices within the Rising Fire too seriously when they chastise and agitate us to go further. Certainly, it'd be better for us to hound the Tendency, and grind them down until they've been wiped out as a political influence altogether. However, if we went any further than we did, war would break out. Winter Frost might not have the spine to fight back, but the Tendency definitely does. But, their criticism is not without some truth. The fruits of our victories are mellow and modest, but, they still are a victory. The recognition of the Matriarch Superior is no small feat, and to secure such a thing proves my ability as a statesmare. I'm not above accomplishing my goals the hard way.\n\nTo that end, once I bring the rebellious northerners to heel, I will lead the Rising Fire into a bright, new age, helming Kiria from the imperial capital of Vermilion itself. The resulting and inevitable victory will serve as the foundation for a transformed Path. Where before our gains have been achieved through opportune moments in strife and small windows within instability, our new gains in the post-war period will have to be made within peace. We will become the party of peace and prosperity to both legitimize and cement our power, and the more militant among us will have to accept that. Whether that means reigning them in or casting them out entirely, this is how things must be done for progress."

Artillery bombardment in the Sunshine Headlands had caused a landslide the debris of which revealed a path into an ancient tomb. Locals who were seeking shelter from the barrage happened upon the discovery, but what they found has been the subject of a great dilemma.\n\nLodged inside the rock of this tomb was a sarcophagus made of an alloy no one could identify, and its finding spurred some interest in the country despite the war raging on. Although, the majority of the eagerness about it comes from international observers and archaeologists. Inside were the skeletal remains of an Eastern Unicorn. Tall, slender, without scales, and with an elegant curved horn. I saw it in that tomb with my own eyes, and its hollow eye sockets stared back at me, almost judgementally. My first thought was, ‘This must be fake.' But a quick tug of its horn in my magic confirmed it was as real as I was.\n\nStill, I cannot keep my thoughts from racing. Since it is indeed real, it naturally follows that there was a time before Concord and a time before Kirins inhabited Kiria. The kirin were said to have been the offspring of eastern unicorns and dragons, a unity granted by Concord, but these remains fly in the face of that. Should news of the existence of this skeleton get out, our faith in Concord, and indeed Concord themselves, would be undermined. The origin and legitimacy of the Kirin species would be called into question, the faiths throughout the country would splinter in a series of schisms, and the Rising Fire's situation would become even more tenuous and unnavigable. Our ascent, our plans for the future and the path to achieving them all depend upon the understanding of the Path remaining the same. The history of Kiria is a carefully woven one, its thread made and bound by faith, and this discovery could unravel all of it. It could cause untold chaos. Still, for all the harm it could do, I'm grateful that it was I who these remains. Who knows what havoc the imperialists could release should they have gotten their hooves on it first.\n\nNo. These remains are a threat to Kiria, to Concord, and to the Rising Fire's climb to power. News must not be allowed to get out about this, and whatever information slips through the cracks must be strangled and suppressed. The tomb will be sealed and the remains will be hidden in my headquarters. As I write to you now, I think that this skeleton is not just a trophy or merely a bomb that can cause pandamonium should its existence get out. It is a physical embodiment of the past in my control, a monument to the order over the future that I control. That, and it's an excellent listener."

As I sit and write now, cadre-scholars of the Rising Fire are journeying all across the realm to set up schools which will teach the next generation of our history. The old schools of the past decadent regimes, controlled by the Serene Tendency, the modernising RaHP, or the fascist NAKP have been shut down and seized. The buildings that poisoned the minds of our youth with nonsense and lies have been commandeered for a newer, better education campaign by the Rising Fire.\n\nAs with any of our policies, there is dissent regarding the teaching material. Even I must admit that the new curriculum does present a sanitised and simple version of our history, that eludes much of the nuance and demonises (justifiably) our enemies in the civil war. They say that we owe it to our Kirin to provide the best for them, to grant them the gift of access to knowledge and critical thought. In this way, they can be truly liberated and act truly liberatorily.\n\nThat all may sound good, but we face challenges that require solutions now. The forces of reaction have been beaten, but they've not been broken. In Fragrance and Rhapsody, in Greater Providence, and in Vermilion and Massicot, the remnants of the old world gather and scheme their counterattack. This is a coming storm of counterrevolution that a conquest of the hearts and minds of this generation will dispel. To strangle reaction in the cradle we've confined it to, we must consolidate ideological control over the youth. She who controls the youth, controls the future and their loyalty will guarantee the future.\n\nMore importantly, so what if it is indoctrination? The menace of counterrevolution looming over the realm necessitates such an unpleasant expediency. This menace represents the primary contradiction, and the solution to it is indoctrination, which is contrary to freedom of thought. This creates a secondary contradiction. Once we sweep away the reactionaries for good and all, we can take care of that fallout after."

In time the vocal elements against me will thank me for the hard decisions I had to make. For the Republic must be united, and in order to be united we need to embrace centralization, not squabbling factions like the Plenum of old or the scattered and infighting groups of revolutionaries gumming up the gears of the Republic. The Incendiaries were integral to the establishment of the Republic, but they have outlived their usefulness and will only serve to become a thorn in our side.\n\nIt is true that institutionalizing the Incendiaries robs them of that dynamism that made them so useful, but they will be more useful in marching lockstep with me into the future I am building. And do they not owe that to me? Have I not proven my worth as a ruler? Did I not face down the tiger of civil war and snatch victory from its jaws? It's high time they recognize this. It's high time that they submit to my rule and trust in my leadership.\n\nThey scorn me now, but history will vindicate me. They'll understand my actions as more than just a necessary sacrifice, but a logical progression into the next stage of our revolution - - the period of centralisation and consolidation after military success to hammer out certain elements in order to forge a greater order of prosperity and stability.

To accomplish this is to build a strong and centralised government and cut out those that cannot bear the responsibility that I do. Those who dissent, those who refuse to acknowledge my leadership in the hour of the Rising Fire's greatest victory -- a victory I claimed for them -- are those who try to knock the revolution off course and they must be dealt with accordingly. Moreover, if they cannot respect me in our greatest triumph, then what can they be expected to do when things go wrong?\n\nIt really is such a shame too. Some of these kirin weren't even opponents, but comrades-in-arms, sparring partners for theology and political strategy, and some were even my friends. During the civil war, they'd been invaluable in agitating within the lack of hierarchy, in debating over every possible issue in order to claim any trifling victory they could for the Rising Fire. Still, these same traits that made them so useful have now made them liabilities to my rule and they are not necessary for survival. The lack of structure they exploited before cannot remain. Their agitation has become pedantic nitpicking and unhelpful criticism aimed at the Rising Fire, and their debates now manifest as foalish squabbling just for squabbling's sake. This disorganization and disrespect to me, their Matriarch, will not only take us off course but send the revolution careening down a cliff.\n\nAs easy as it would be to bring my hoof down upon them like a thunderbolt, that would be the action of a tyrant and a tyrant I am not. I do not purge opponents from my party, I bestow them with cushy early retirements, posts in the distant and vibrant parts of the country so they may get away from the capital and see the realm, and comfortable sinecures. However, there are some of those ardent voices in my government who refuse any of my gifts, and it is a tragedy to see their names in the headlines following a terrible accident that befell them. Even more so to see a prominent leader of the Incendiaries arrested on charges of blasphemy and treason, what kind of message does that send our comrades?\n\nThe revolution has given Kiria a righteous path to follow and none shall stray from it, as veering from the path is a betrayal of the revolution."

Naturally, they seek a doctor, and the doctor tells them what is afflicting them and then treats the symptoms. In a perfect world, the treatment succeeds and the patient is cured, and they go on about their lives.\n\nBut let me ask you a different question: What does one do if the society they find themselves in is ill? What if the very nation catches a disease? While the answer isn't exactly the same, the solution remains somewhat similar. To alleviate the disease, the symptoms must be treated.\n\nI am referring to the vile, foreign, and godless Marksists who gain popularity in the central organs of the cities, and without intervention, will spread to the entire body politic like a pox. Socialism results from the natural conditions of a given country, it doesn't manifest in the same way across two different countries. Marxism disagrees entirely. The condescending, cosmopolitan ideology from the world over has deluded itself into thinking that it alone can determine what is ‘proper' socialism. In their view, the state and religion should be entirely separate, ignoring not just the important role mystics and priests fill in Kiria's government, but the worship and supremacy of Concord above all matters. It is their incorrect and juvenile belief that the advancement of revolution is a quasi-scientific act in which religion or the kirin way of life plays absolutely no part. The Marksist-Stallionist Workers' Party isn't just a party of foreign subversives who call themselves socialist, it isn't just a threat to faith, but it is a danger to all of kirin revolution on par with the NAKP.\n\nThe Skynavia denunciation criticises the Rising Fire along the same lines that the NAKP would, the arrest of Cherith Kattumaram is the exact same thing the NAKP would do were they provided the chance. In terms of the destruction to Kirin society, to Kirin culture, to the Kirin revolution, the NAKP and the MSWPK are one in the same. And because they are both an equal blight upon society, they must be treated in the same way.\n\nThe cure is not medicine as it would be for any other disease, but stamping them out from all walks of society before this foreign transplanted infection grasps its tendrils around the hearts and minds of the workers. I refuse to let the infection of pseudo-scientific infiltrators destroy Kiria. The disease will not spread."

I was so convinced that every step further toward despotism was for the good of the kirin people, the good of the revolution, and the will of Concord that I had confused being authoritarian with being a good revolutionary. The gratitude I feel for Dayspring Rose for hearing the people and standing with them is beyond the grasp of my words.\n\nThey could've easily done away with me as I had with so many rivals before. The ease with which they could've fabricated an accident that had befallen the Matriarch Superior only goes to demonstrate the strength and the mercy of the kirin people. They have endured so much suffering, sacrificed more than could ever be asked, and lived through the nightmare that was my foray into tyranny and they still offer their hoof to me.\n\nI had wanted to brainwash them and their children that I was the infallible mother of all Kiria who would leave a righteous legacy, but some part of me always knew as the people had known that this was wrong.

The Sunrise Massacre demonstrates this principle in one event that would be true for every action I took in power: The truth would have surfaced regardless.

They have given me the opportunity to live a life of making amends, making the proper apologies, working towards rehabilitation and eventually achieving redemption.\n\nAlthough the legacy of the great Matriarch Rising Sun dies today, the next chapter of the Rising Sun the Kirin is being written.

For the first time in my short life that I've spent following her, she has entrusted me to make my own decisions and §Yexecute Concord's will§! to the best of my capabilities. She has given me use of the troublesome pirate, Roaring Fire, to aid my team of Valiants in our tasks, and though the pirate does her best to needle her way under my scales, I do my best to shut out her disingenuous words.\n\nThe High Priestess had tasked us with hunting down and smiting one troublesome heretic who goes by the name of Quarrelsome Wren. Whether it was his real name or not, I do not know, nor did it matter. What mattered was that High Priestess Sun had branded him a heretic, and for that, §Yhe had to be dealt with.§! Once a faithful follower of our way, he had dared to question the divine will of Concord to Rising Sun's face, questioning whether she was truly the executioner of Her will, and as a result had been condemned and expelled by the faithful priests and mystics in attendance at the temple that day. Ever since fleeing Chrysanthemum, he had wandered from town to town, §Ysubverting the Rising Fire§! with his lies and heresy, corrupting the rank and file and confusing the peasants who did not know he had been branded a heretic. But when we heard that he was hiding in a remote monastery in the mountains of the Cinereous Strath, Rising Sun had dispatched me, my Valiants, and the pirate to deal with him.\n\n§YI do not think I will soon forget what I witnessed today.§!\n\nWhen we arrived at the monastery and demanded that Wren surrender, he refused to show himself, and the monks at the temple attempted to defend him when we entered. Things rapidly grew out of hoof, and several of them §Yturned into niriks§! to defend the heretic. We had to fight to get to him, and I was forced to strike down kirin who should have been my brothers and sisters with my sword. It disturbed me, but the actions of the pirate disturbed me more. She §Yreveled in the slaughter§!, like a monster sent by Concord to punish Her enemies, and those that raised a hoof against her were brutally cut down in a flurry of swords. Violence should only be the last resort when those that oppose Concord's divine will give you no choice, but they should never be something to indulge in.\n\nIn the end, we found Quarrelsome Wren as he tried to flee, and one of my Valiants shot him through the legs to ensure he couldn't. As I put my sword to his throat and asked the heretic if he had any words, he surprised me with §Ya question§!: has Concord ever proven to anykirin else that Rising Sun is her champion other than Rising Sun herself? I retorted that her successes so far have proven Concord's favor for her, that she would not have gotten this far if Concord did not see her as Her champion. But Wren only asked me again: if Rising Sun claims to speak for Concord, why has Concord not assured the faithful that Rising Sun's authority is derived from Her divine will? How could she §Ytruly speak for Concord's divine will§! if she is not the Matriarch Superior, Concord's avatar on earth and embodiment of her will made manifest?\n\nI did not have the opportunity to question him further; disgusted by his heresy, one of my Valiant companions silenced him forever with a bullet to the head. I could only stare in shock, but magic tugged on my mane and I looked over to see Roaring Fire about to drag me out of the burning monastery. "Meditate on it later, little filly," she scolded me in her hoarse voice, "unless you want to join the monks under the ashes and timbers." I knew she was right, and so reluctantly, I followed her out of the temple.

While I'm sure the hedonists in Vermilion are §Yhappy to see these heretics in our territory§!, Rising Sun knows that we could not stand their presence.

Maybe it's because she doesn't like the whole §Y'equality between all creatures, equality under Concord'§! thing they've got going on."\n\nI couldn't stand her insinuations any longer and pointedly left her after that. I know she was mocking me, trying to find ways to turn my faith into a weapon to cut myself with. She's more §Yattentive to theology§! than she otherwise appears, so it would seem. But she is wrong. Perfect equality between creatures before Concord was how Noctilucent Charm justified the Silence a century ago, and the kirin people need mystics and priests to help them understand Concord's will. Misguided notions of total equality only lead to conflict and separation, and it is something we can ill-afford right now. §YWe must all be united under Rising Sun§! if we are to have any hope of defeating Vermilion and the Way of Fire, so that Concord's true word can finally reach all the kirin of the Realm."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_5_entry_3_CONTENT:0 "§YI will see her blood in my nightmares.§!\n\nYesterday, High Priestess Sun sent my team and I to the town of Wheatchaff, a town in the face of the advancing Vermilion banners, to enforce her doctrine of scorched earth. If we are to prevail against Vermilion's superior numbers and better equipment, we must make sure they take nothing from us. They will find no shelter and no food wherever they advance, and Rising Sun has ordered that all towns in the way of Vermilion's advance are to §Yburn their villages and fields to the ground§! to ensure they do not get anything. But there are those errant towns that refuse to heed our call. Their residents return to their homes after our soldiers retreat, and even welcome the advancing armies into their villages without resistance. Wheatchaff looked to be the next to do this, so we were sent preemptively to ensure that Priestess Sun's mandate was upheld without exception.\n\nMy team made quick work organizing the destruction of the village and the evacuation of the residents, and as they set fire to the fields and towns, the town's mayor, the pirate, and myself watched from a nearby hilltop. At first, the mayor was inconsolable. She asked us why we had to do this and why we couldn't just let them be, but I did my best to explain to her that §Ywe cannot win if we don't make sacrifices§!, and I commended her and the townsfolk on behalf of the High Priestess and the Rising Fire. At that point, her misery became anger. She screamed at me that we had condemned them all to death. There is no food to be found amongst the miles of burning fields, she said, and no shelter to be had in the ruins of burnt out villages. She said that the forest was no place to be for the elderly and infirm, and even went so far as to claim life under Vermilion §Ywould have been a better alternative to their exile§!. As I tried to explain to her that there are times when a few may suffer so the rest may thrive, she flew into a murderous rage. Her clothes and mane combusted, and the §Rnirik state§! fell upon her in an instant. Before she could lunge, however, Roaring Fire cut her down with a single stroke of her saber, and the mayor's blood spouted from the gruesome wound on her neck and covered my face.\n\nI do not remember much that followed. I think I was in shock. Why do these kirin not understand what we must do to win? Why do they not see that if they do not embrace sacrifice, we will all lose? Shouldn't they be proud that they are doing everything they must to work together and achieve victory over the Way of Fire?\n\nBut then again... how can I chastise them for their lack of pride §Ywhen I feel none myself?§!"

We had heard rumors of unrest in the town, and being so close to Vermilion, Rising Sun decided it would be too good of an opportunity to pass up without investigating. If we could foment unrest and rebellion on Vermilion's doorstep, it could be a spark to ignite unrest §Ythroughout the Realm§! as well.\n\nThe meeting, however, proved disappointing. The underground resistance movement was led by a couple of young kirin students, with heads full of ideas and not the harsh realities of our §Yrevolutionary struggle§!. Their representative wanted to extract concessions and promises from the Rising Fire in exchange for garnering the support of his comrades. While we both agreed that the officials in Massicot are corrupt, decadent, and craven, and that the priests of the Way of Fire grow fat off of tithes in their monasteries while preaching to the poor about piety and the simple life, our differences were §Ytoo far apart to be reconciled.§! For one, they refused to pledge allegiance to the Rising Fire, and they refused to submit to our laws and to accept the military leadership of our cadres over their cells. The student was too enamored with their hopeless idea of total independence to compromise and negotiate with me, and when I tried to press him some more, he turned on me, calling me an autocrat and drawing a §Yfalse equivalence§! between the Rising Fire and the Way of Fire.\n\nIt was at that point that I decided we were done talking. If these idealistic students and their misguided peasant lackeys refused to cooperate with the Rising Fire, then §Ywhat is the point?§! We cannot function if we do not move in lockstep with each other, with one goal and one drive. A collection of ideas and factions would only weaken our resolve from within, and if they refuse to see the truth and wisdom of our ways, and insist on selfishly indulging in their pipe dreams of "true democracy", then there is no place for them in the Rising Fire. We move as one and fight as one, and only then will Vermilion fall, and only then will the Realm see the §Ylight of Rising Sun's justice for Kiria.§!"

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_5_entry_5_CONTENT:0 "It has been an exhausting day in Vermilion, moving from one function to the next, all the while accompanied by Roaring Fire and her obnoxiously snide remarks uttered when only I can hear them. Sometimes I wonder why I keep the (former) pirate queen around; sure, she was placed in my custody by the First Priestess, but I was given leave to do with her as I saw fit. I'm certain that §Ydoing away with her§! would fit under that purview, but in a way, she has been a reliable companion, even if she doesn't seem to understand, or make any attempts to understand, the progress we are making for the Realm.\n\nBut perhaps even if her commentary is chosen in part, I suspect, by an attempt to get under my scales, her words are very deliberately selected, and it's clear that she is §Ystaying observant of the situation around her§! and not just making lazy attempts to prey on my beliefs. Perhaps the best example of this was her remarks to me today after we left the assembly of the kirin of Vermilion, where the First Priestess expressed her intent that the Rising Fire must take upon itself Concord's sacred obligation to see all the kirin of the world live under one banner. She noted as we departed that Rising Sun did not make mention of whether anykirin had asked the creatures of Zaikiria or Taungpau if they wished to live under the Realm's banner, and perhaps they would not agree to participate willingly in §Yblatant racial imperialism.§! I responded the truth that I knew: that the Rising Fire had proven its worth as Concord's faithful servants on the temporal plane and that we would be liberators of our kirin siblings in Zaikiria and Taungpau. Through our actions, condoned and encouraged through Concord's divine will, we would create the Great Realm of the Kirin, where we would join together as one great big family of kirin.\n\nI of course did not mean that we would literally be one big family, but Roaring Fire seized upon that to needle my scales further. "You should have seen my family in Nacre," she teased me. "Then you would feel differently about family matters. My mother was a drunk and my father was vicious and cruel. They were horrible kirin and I hated them. I didn't have a choice in being born into that family. Do you think Zaikiria and Taungpau will feel any different when Rising Sun's Great Realm §Yforcibly adopts them into hers?"§! I of course snapped back that this was different, that Concord would care for all her wayward foals through the First Priestess' guidance, that they would happily join with their sisters across the border. But even still, I found myself thinking about her words through the remainder of the day.\n\nNow they haunt me as I write this journal. Am I just §Ymindlessly regurgitating the party line?§! How can I know for sure that all, or even a majority, of the kirin in the lands beyond the Realm's borders would happily and gracefully accept our rule. Certainly they would be moved to resist us out of a desire to maintain their self-determination and way of life, however §Ymisguided§! their nationalism or ethnic chauvinism may be. There will be bloodshed, and kirin will be fighting kirin once again. Haven't we seen enough death and destruction, smoke and nirik flames in the Realm already? Is there a need to fan the flames further, when if the neighboring kirin wanted to be a part of the Great Realm of the Kirin, they could simply §Yask to join us?§!\n\nPerhaps, in attending Rising Sun's rally, I find myself standing on the wrong side. Kindling Flash and his associates boycotted it, which certainly sent a message, but only a muted one. His faction is small, and the Rising Fire's orbit is centered squarely around Rising Sun as its first priestess. §YHer word is law, her edicts and decrease incontrovertible.§! Even if I were to join them, to send a strong message that Rising Sun's own protege disagreed with her statement, it would mean little. So what difference would it make?\n\nRoaring Fire of course had one more thing to say before I forced her to drop the topic, unwilling to listen to her treasonous tongue wag any longer. She claimed that this all proves that neither the Fraternal Republic nor the Rising Fire cared much for their ideals anymore, and that the Realm is now §Ya nation under Rising Sun.§! Then she pointed out that the First Priestess had said so herself: she would create a Great Realm of the Kirin, not an extension of the Fraternal Republic. By Rising Sun's own admission, the Fraternal Republic would be replaced by her Great Realm, and Roaring Fire dared me to prove otherwise. And even though I told her she was wrong and misguided, as I write these words, §YI struggle to find justification to prove her otherwise.§!"

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_5_entry_6_CONTENT:0 "My travels throughout the Realm to oversee the institution of the First Priestess' decrees recently took me to the small village of Nutgall in the Clement Doab, where I went to investigate reports of armed clashes between veterans of the Incarnadine Soldiery and the local villagers. Even before I arrived, I knew roughly what to expect. The veterans in the village were issued decrees by the government that gave them rights and titles to the land in the area as a reward for their service, §Yeven though this land was already owned by the local kirin§!, many of whom had fled as the fighting against Vermilion's forces raged during the civil war. When the war ended, many of the villagers who had survived elsewhere had returned, only to find their fields and their family homes occupied by strangers claiming that they were the new owners. Any attempts to resolve these disputes went straight to the regional Banner Jurisdiction, whose officials were once comrades-in-arms with the veterans now occupying the land; it should be little surprise that the villagers §Ywere almost never favored§! in these rulings, leaving many homeless, destitute, and angry. That anger of course manifested in discontent and eventually violence, with nirik transformations and attempts to forcibly evict the veterans from the homes they were occupying. Unfortunately, these were farmers and peasants, and the new occupants were veterans hardened by war. It wasn't long before the veterans retaliated, §Yand their retaliation was bloody.§! The farmers were beaten and chased out of the village at swordpoint, and one ringleader was hacked to pieces as a warning to the others to leave or else suffer a similar fate.\n\nI don't know whether to consider it fortunate or not that the message seemed to have been received by the time I arrived. I had to gather the above information about the events that happened after the fact, as the villagers had all been driven out before I arrived. In fact, all that remained of their presence in the village, besides the homes that the Incarnadine Soldiery veterans now called their own, was §Ya messy campsite torn up and trampled by hooves§! that once served as the makeshift living quarters for the evicted farmers on the outskirts of town. Even as the local bannerkirin commander told me the tales of violence and clashes in the town, the stallion insisted that the veterans were only enforcing their land warrants that had been legally and rightfully granted to them by the First Priestess' decree. Loathe as I am to say it, his words are true: the land warrants, by design or incompetence, grant their holders such a wide degree of power to occupy and possess land and property that the veterans §Yhad done no wrong by the word of the law.§!\n\nOf course, I didn't need the text of the decree to know what it said; I had been in the room when it was drafted, and its aims have always been clear. Veterans loyal to the Rising Fire would help spread its laws and influence across the Realm to consolidate the rule of the Republic by making them personally invested in the stability of regions where Vermilion had limited oversight. The presence of so many battle-hardened loyalist kirin alongside their families would dilute the strongholds of Serene Tendency or NAKP power by §Ypushing out the locals and undermining their influence§!, making them easier to integrate into the Realm. Such a strategy is not without conflict and casualties, as seen in Nutgall, and there is no chance of fostering good will among the local population as outsiders force them out of their homes and off of their fields. The future this strategy is going to create frightens me. The Rising Fire is building a future of conflict, persecution, and oppression, and sewing the seeds for a new generation of guerillas and rebels whose offspring will be taught to hate the Rising Fire and the Fraternal Republic. Will they be wrong to think that? I think not. And the more I think about it, the more I believe that practices such as this one cannot continue. For the stability of the Republic, §Ywe need to take a more reconciliatory approach§! to the kirin that opposed us and lost, not an unflinching steadfastness to the hard-line stance that Rising Sun has adopted."

KIR_diary_SG_ENTRY_TEXTS_protag_5_entry_7_CONTENT:0 "What do I think about working with old enemies?\n\nThat's the question I've been trying to answer all day, I suppose. It hasn't been long since the plan to form and activate the Supervised Task Forces was finally put into motion. On paper, it's a simple thing. Countless kirin who opposed the Rising Fire in our march across the Realm languish in prisons and camps, where they have nothing to do except plot and scheme for their freedom. Many of these kirin are experienced leaders and soldiers, scientists, politicians, and more. All very capable folk. The Supervised Task Forces would §Ymake use of their talents in service to the Realm§! rather than letting them waste in camps by volunteering to participate in service to the Realm in exchange for their freedom. The specialists would be able to help contribute in research and the reconstruction of the Realm, but most would be tasked with policing and counterinsurgency operations—Concord knows we have no shortage of rebel sentiment that must be dealt with if the Fraternal Republic is to maintain its hold on the Realm. After a thorough vetting, prisoners would be deployed to regions of the Realm based on where their allegiances lie. Kirin from Greater Providence would be deployed to the east, south, and west of the country, while those from the east and south in turn are sent to Greater Providence. It makes sense from a stability perspective; after all, we don't want to §Ysend kirin back to where their true loyalties lie§! in case they decide to turn their new freedom into efforts to plot vengeance against the Republic. It's a tried and true tactic for any conqueror, and though our efforts were to liberate the Realm, we could not do that without conquering those which held it in bondage.\n\nBut what I'm seeing in practice is far more distasteful. Many of the paroled POWs aren't just no-name average kirin. Many are §Ynotorious landlords, corrupt mystics, and other profound reactionaries§!. One was even responsible for the destruction of Mungbean, a small village that was entirely wiped out during the war, shelled into the dust even though no soldiers hid within its squalid huts. Another executed any and all Rising Fire mystics she managed to capture during the fighting. Now we're working with them?! Promising them lands, money, and freedom when their work is done?! Why?\n\nI voiced my frustrations, perhaps a bit too emphatically, to Roaring Fire over dinner this evening. Her answer started with a question: §Yisn't this what happened to her?§! She was an enemy of the Realm, captured and brought low, and the First Priestess instead gave me her talents to use on my missions. She was an enemy turned ally, and it just proved that this isn't the first time Rising Sun has tried to make use of old enemies to suit her needs. I believe her exact words were "She's a wily fox, playing the dogs against the cats while she steals the chickens' eggs." I don't know where she got the idiom, or if it was just something she made up on the spot, but it holds a certain amount of truth to it. Like the dogs and the cats, the Supervised Task Forces play the kirin of Greater Providence against the kirin of Vermilion, who are too wrapped up in their hatred for each other to realize that §Ythe fox is securing her control over the Realm.§!\n\nI asked Roaring Fire what she thinks will happen when Rising Sun is done stealing all the eggs, so to speak, and her response was to chastise me for obliviousness. Did I seriously believe that Rising Sun would ever grant just rewards to these kirin? Once they have served their purpose, it would be very easy to put them back in camps or back in the ground. But I still feel that solves little. Even giving these kirin a taste of freedom §Yis an injustice to their victims.§! Instead of atoning for their crimes, they are rewarded with the opportunity to inflict more on others. There is no justice in that, no matter what ends their means supposedly justify. To that, Roaring Fire merely asked me if I thought she had gotten what I thought she deserved. I didn't have an answer.\n\nPerhaps that is what haunts me the most. §YIs Roaring Fire's service under me justice?§! On the one hoof, I would think not. She was a pirate queen, a murderer and a slaver who plagued the seas during Vermilion's institutional paralysis in The Silence. But on the other, she has served me well, and been a steadfast companion. Geas or not, she aims to protect me and help me in my endeavors. And despite it all, I think there is some good in her heart, even if she is loathe to show it and hides it under sarcastic and needling remarks.\n\n§YSo do I think she deserves the same fate as the kirin of the STF, who serve only to be discarded when deemed necessary?§!"

After fleeing Vermilion, Roaring Fire and I had a couple of close calls along the meandering banks of the Great Mellifluve with the Incarnadine Soldiery, but we eventually made it to Verdant in one piece. True to her word, Roaring was able to track down some of her old pirate connections and call in a couple favors to get a small junk and a small crew together to make a dash for the sea. We had another close call with a few patrol boats, but nokirin knows these waters better than Roaring does, and so we were able to §Yslip out to sea and leave them behind§!.\n\nOur destination is Hindia, where Kindling Flash is trying to organize resistance from abroad, but our first stop will be the Zebrides for supplies and more of Roaring's crew. That gives me plenty of time to come to terms with the fact that I will very likely §Ynever return to Kiria§!, to the beloved land I call my home. It makes me think of the kirin from Fragrance that fled a hundred years ago when The Silence began, but unlike them, I'm not fleeing for money or greed, but for my morals. I stood idly by while Rising Sun became a power-hungry despot—worse, I helped her do it, believing I was doing the right thing to keep the Fraternal Republic safe. But when we reached the point of no return, I can at least say that §YI stood my ground in a hopeless situation, even if it was too late.§! Rather than submit to the tyrant my old mentor has become, I defied her, even if it was a futile effort. Perhaps that explains why my heart feels at ease and my thoughts are calm, even though I will never see the land of my birth again.\n\nWhat pains me most of all, however, is that no matter what I do, even if somehow Kindling Flash's rebellion in exile ends up being successful, I will never have Rising Sun back. In addition to being my mentor and teacher who schooled me in the tenets of the Rising Fire and taught me how to achieve spiritual communion with Concord, she was a mare I looked up to, a mare I relied on, a mare I loved like family. She was my family, after all. It's not a story I tell most kirin, but I was abandoned at a temple in Chrysanthemum when I was a foal, with only vague memories of my parents, like flitting shadows in my past. Rising Sun took me in and all but raised me as her own foal. Perhaps that was why I was so willingly blind to her path to autocracy, and perhaps why her fall cuts deeper than any pain I've ever felt before. §YWhat I wouldn't give to have her back, to go back to the way things were.§!\n\nBut things will never go back, and that's the reality I must now live with. It's up to me to figure out how to live my life now. Despite everything, Rising Sun taught me to be a good mare and to never let the odds stacked against me hold me back. I may have failed to stop my mentor from falling to the dark desires that wrapped themselves up in her paranoia, but I can keep fighting to save the Realm from what she's done to it. Kindling Flash and many of our comrades continue the fight, and I will join them with Roaring Fire and her crew by my side. Together, we can prove to those who still believe in the Fraternal Republic that §Ythe revolution is not yet dead§! and that there are kirin who are still willing to fight for it. The Realm will be free once again. It may not be tomorrow, or the days or months or years to come, but it will be one day.\n\nAnd maybe one day, if Concord can spare me a scale of Her divine wisdom and grace, §YI can have my mother back.§!"

There's just been so much happening, so much going through my head and—wow!\n\nOkay, okay, Dayspring, let's back it up and start from the top. I don't know how I missed the signs, but when Rising Sun announced she was going to step down as First Priestess and §Yelevate me as her replacement§! I was shocked. Dumbfounded! I mean, I should have seen this coming, should have known that Rising always intended for me to replace her one day. But I guess I never expected it to be so soon. Her mane hasn't even started graying yet, and she already thinks I'm ready to replace her?!\n\nSo, yeah, I admit, I'm more than a little overwhelmed. But when we had dinner in private after her announcement, Rising assured me that I was more than ready for the task. Even if I didn't think so at the time, my mentor spent that meal calmly and meticulously going through all my fears and concerns and assuaging them with kind and confident words. By the end of it, §YI felt much better§!, even if worry and apprehension still clutched at my chest.\n\nWith the shock of the sudden change wearing off a bit, I now have to put together my plan for the future as the new First Priestess. I don't really have any concrete ideas on policy—until very recently, I was more concerned about executing policy than creating it—but in my mind I have an idea of what I want. I want to preserve the Fraternal Republic and finally step away from many of the strict programs that Rising Sun implemented in her struggles to keep the young republic safe and stable. No more 100 day plans, no more ambitious programs that trade the blood of our people for progress. There is a better way to rebuild the Realm, and that is to cherish and nurture the kirin within it, to give them the tools they need to prosper and allow them to do it. And even though it may seem antithetical to my role as the First Priestess of the Rising Fire, I plan on slackening the state-mandated compulsions to adhere to strict religious devotion to our ways. Not everykirin will want to show their appreciation for Concord in the same way, and if we mandate that they must devote themselves to her in a specific fashion, the Rising Fire will slide down the same path to hedonism and oppression that the Way of Fire decayed to. After all, one of our core tenets is that everykirin can commune with Concord as they desire and see fit; it's what separates us from the Way of Fire, where religious communion was strictly controlled by the corrupt priest class. Only then can we achieve the strong and fair §Ydemocratic, socialist, and communalist Kiria§! the revolution promised the people.\n\nI know there's a long journey ahead of me, and it's not going to be easy. I'm going to stumble, and I'm going to fall. But even if Rising Sun no longer holds the reins in her magic, she'll be there alongside me to guide me, just as she always has done since I was an abandoned filly taken in by the temple in Chrysanthemum. With her help, and with the support of the commonkirin, I will live up to my duties and make a better Realm. One that all of them—Rising Sun, the commonkirin, and Concord herself—§Ycan be proud of.§!"

Their fears about inducing a nirik state intentionally are understandable, but can't they understand that the thing they fear so much is §Yprecisely the thing I am trying to prevent§! with this research? Yes, there is a little flame around the door, but the whole house will be ablaze shortly - better that we escape now, with merely blistered hooves, than perish in the coming inferno.\n\n§YNoctilucent Charm§! did not impose the Silence over a few peasants going nirik and scorching their rice paddies. The pre-Silence literature is clear - the changes brought to Kiria by the coming of modernity created social and class conflicts that inspired mass outbreaks of nirik never seen before. Kirin with pent-up fury over years of percieved injustice can sustain the nirik state for hours, days, in a few cases, and easily re-ignite again and again. In Stalliongrad, these drives caused a revolution. In Kiria, they nearly put the entire realm to the torch, nearly destroyed kirinkind.\n\nNokirin could deny that the §YGrand Gallop Onward§! has been a surprising success, but it is hardly the cure for all ills that §YAutumn Blaze§! would have us think. There are hungry kirin, there are exploited kirin, there are havekirin and there are have-notkirin, and there are already protests and disturbances daily across the realm. I am certain that the presence and power of the Matriarch Superior was the sole reason the Grand Gallop Onward itself did not inspire a §Ymass nirik revolt§! of the kind we saw before the Silence. Yet Autumn Blaze's new §Yconsociationalism§! removes the possibility of there being any decisive or authoritative voice that could calm the whole country at once. Without the power of the old Matriarchate or a single dominant faction, our only safeguard will be that she does not attempt to pass anything unpopular with the other parties in this power-sharing arrangement - which is no safeguard at all.\n\nKiria is being pulled in a dozen directions. Harmonists and socialists, traditionalists, reformists, national-patriots, religious fundamentalists - it doesn't matter who is on top. It matters that the conflict between these groups will be our doom, unless we can §Ysolve the nirik problem for good§!. Our only hope is that it can be bred out of the population over time, but this consociationalism is much too weak to impose such a policy and sustain it. If kirinkind is to survive, we need a strong realm, a unified realm, one that can do the unpleasant thing now to secure a safe, unscorched future for Kiria. Autumn Blaze is not going to provide that kind of leadership, and I don't want to sit idly by while her anaemic government fails to take action. But what can I possibly do?"

The new §YState Undersecretariat for Fire Control§! was showing off its first armored firefighting formations. Unofficially, as everyone in the realm surely knows, this is Kiria's new rapid-response force for nirik outbreaks. Seeing the level of militarization that this simple fire brigade has, I have to say that I am torn.

But at the same time, it is the height of naivite she believes her harmonist consociationalism will survive the first incident where this new fire brigade has to bomb and bayonet somekirin who goes nirik in opposition to her clique's policies.\n\nWhile I was watching the parade, I was accosted by two street urchins who were jeering and making faces at the firefighters. When they noticed me, they trotted over and began to cause troubles. First, they introduced themselves as §YSudden Fire§! and §YPrairie Blaze§!, and they said they were with a group called the '§YRed Angry Fire§!' - or it might've been the Angry Red Fire, I wasn't paying too much attention at first.

I can't tell if they're just two hooligans having some fun or if they're really part of some group, but they started saying things about other protests and riots and arson across Kiria that the Red Angry Fire supposedly has a hoof in. They started talking about how they think Autumn Blaze is a traitor for 'selling out to Equestria' and how they want to burn down what she's built so a §Ynew and pure Kiria§! can rise from the ashes, or, something like that.\n\nI left pretty quickly after that, and they seemed to like how uncomfortable I looked. I mean, Autumn Blaze might be too optimistic for my taste, but she's no traitor! And after meeting those Red Angry Fire urchins, suddenly the fact that she's giving the fire brigades tanks and artillery doesn't seem quite as naive, either."

At least, it was enjoyable, until our ship's boiler failed and we had to make for some miserably tiny town called §YLychee§! for repairs.\n\nMuch as I was trying not to think about politics, I couldn't help but start thinking about §Yrural Kiria§!. One reads about peasant revolts and farmers' rebellions pre-Silence, but really, Kirian politics has always revolved around our biggest cities, the countryside is this immense monolith that nokirin pays any mind to until it's burning down. So I started to ask around about how things were going in Lychee, and discovered that a local party activist named §YSong Thrush§! was giving a speech in a tea shop that same afternoon.\n\nLet me say, Song Thrush is like a mare possessed. She was proudly wearing a §YRealm and Harmony Party§! lapel, and I was ready to hear a stream of cheerful vagaries devoid of substance, but no, Thrush took the room by storm. She began with explaining the success of some local project to hire an ambulance boat that could visit the villages along this part of the Mellifluve and bring sick kirin to the clinic in Lychee, but she was soon interrupted by a heckler who pointed out that the §YHome Affairs Bureau§! had originally promised enough funding to build a proper hospital in town. And that's when Thrush leapt into action - swiftly condemning this heckler's grumbling and pointing out that while funding was never forthcoming, the Home Affairs Bureau was doing the best it could with what it had. The ambulance boat could take the sickest kirin to Sorghum, after all, and it would be the only healthcare that the kirin in the villages could access. Something was better than nothing, as it were. The rest of the kirin present, who I later learned were all members of the Home Affairs Bureau, seemed §Yreassured by her passion§!.\n\nI left her speech feeling strange. Lychee was clearly big enough to need a hospital, and Sorghum was an unpleasantly long boat ride away. The government can barely provide for the cities, and the more I dwell on it, there must be quite a lot of small towns like Lychee feeling increasingly neglected. Yet the kirin here, apart from one dissenter, don't seem disgruntled, or angry, they just seem... resolved. Intent to make do, and intent to help themselves until Vermilion gets around to them. There was even a fundraiser at the end of the social, and River and I both tossed in a few taels - the box said it was funds for a local soup kitchen.\n\nI suppose rural Kiria in some ways has it worse than anywhere else. But knowing that the kirin here are §Yorganizing to make their lives better§!, instead of grumbling and smouldering... it's almost as uplifting as hearing that the Silence was lifted."

I haven't ever been this far west before, and I hadn't ever intended to, but §YRiver Lily§! says it's important for me to see the whole Realm, not just the east and the north. And I have to say, the food here is strange and the kirin stranger, but I like it.\n\nWe arrived in Sorghum at about the same time as some news from Vermilion - §YAutumn Blaze§! and the Secretariat have created a new office, the §YConstitutional Standard-Bearers§!. From what I can tell, they're a combination of an armored division, an intelligence agency, and a counter-insurgency formation. A military planner Autumn Blaze is not. And this kind of expensive force, which will of course end up being deployed against nirik, if any start threatening the constitutional order, is a distraction from a real solution to the nirik problem. Such a distraction, in fact, that if it weren't for  news about niriks and fire suppression attracting my attention like a magnet, the Standard-Bearers would've completely drowned out the other news from Vermilion. The Secretariat has also established a §YKirian Volunteer Fire Department§! to centralize and support local Volunteer Fire Departments that had been cropping up. I wasn't exactly sure what that meant, and the papers weren't clear. Apparently my confusion showed on my face, because River Lily helpfully suggested we see if Sorghum had a local VFD, and that is how I ended up sharing dinner with a fascinating mare named §YOrange Blossom§!.\n\nFrom the guns the Standard-Bearers were apparently carrying, I wasn't sure what to expect from Orange Blossom, though I imagined a mare in homemade armor leading a ragtag group of firefighter-militias into battle against gangs of nirik. But Orange Blossom was a smartly-dressed and well-spoken mare who had been a monk before she ran for the office of VFD Chief in Sorghum. When I started to ask her about how the VFD controlled nirik, she shook her head, and explained that the VFD does everything it can to §Ystop kirin from becoming nirik in the first place§!. Lily told me later that I had my mouth hanging open in confusion as Blossom explained that while the VFD did fight fires, it also tried to find and help kirin who were stressed and at risk of transforming. It makes a lot of sense that a monk of the Way of Fire would be in charge of that kind of operation. As Blossom told me about community outreach programs, counseling and therapy programs, social welfare programs, all designed to help disturbed kirin recover peacefully, I started to get a nervous feeling in my gut.\n\nBlossom's method of dealing with niriks seems... inefficient. Difficult to implement. Expensive, and requiring constant effort, and dedication, and maintenance. But then, isn't that what the §YWay of Fire§! did for centuries? Is the VFD a modern version of the Way of Fire's original goals? And didn't that work? More importantly, if these volunteers - Orange Blossom said the Sorghum VFD had almost a thousand members - if they could actually help kirin keep from going nirik, then maybe we don't need to breed that side of us away. I'm not sure of anything, but as hopeful and friendly as Orange Blossom was, listening to her made a small kirin on my shoulder start whispering that §YI might be very, very wrong§!."

The recent §Yreforms with the tael§! meant that our money wasn't going as far as it had before - not that that was an issue for me, but I could hear the grumblings in town. For example, Lily and I stumbled on a businessmare arguing with her landlord, and their bickering confirmed what I was afraid of.\n\nDevaluing the tael has brought plenty of foreign business into Kiria, and helped the central government handle its debts most effectively, but it's also §Yrun small Kirian businesses up against the wall§!. This poor mare - her name turned out to be §YSnowy Wool§! - couldn't afford the interest on a loan she'd been forced to take out to keep her restaurant open, with how rates have shot up after the reforms. The inflation is quite bad, and Snowy was hardly the only voice loudly complaining on the docks, but her particular case struck me because she was pleading with her landlord for an extension on her rent as a matter of charity. Not for herself, but for her customers, who she is apparently feeding at or sometimes below cost, because otherwise, they wouldn't be able to eat. Yet more evidence that the §YGrand Gallop Onward§! left quite a few kirin in the dust, but, also very heartwarming, to know that the common kirin are doing their best to help each other out.\n\nAfter this argument - the landlord grudgingly agreed to give her a few more days - I approached Snowy Wool and got to talking to her about her restaurant, and she explained everything about the rising prices and the difficulty the kirin in the city were facing. She seemed adamant that if there were hungry kirin in Sycee, it just wouldn't be right to be trying to make a profit off of them, though she wasn't sure how she was going to keep her doors open. I don't know quite what came over me - I've never done anything like this before - but I blurted out that I could offer her a cheaper loan to get her through until the troubles with the tael tide over. She accepted eagerly, and I'm happy to say that I stuck to my word and made sure her money was on its way.\n\nThat night, over our dinner, Lily told me that while she was a little surprised to see me spending money like that, she was proud of me. Part of me wanted to say something about how foolish I was, but I realized, seeing her smile, that I wasn't foolish at all. In fact, I started to think if I would even feel right collecting the interest on that loan. Putting food in the bellies of Sycee's needy seems §Yas good a use of money as any§!."

Mention the Bloom name in this city and it's easy enough to get an invitation to anywhere! If I enjoyed being the center of attention a bit more, I think I could want to stay here forever. And I have my cousins' generous donations to the §YNAKP§! to thank for that. High society here in Fragrance is all abuzz - the §YMatriarch herself§! is visiting the city as part of a tour of Greater Providence! I wasn't sure how I would feel about seeing her in person, but it was a fascinating feeling. For all of my particular convictions about politics, when I first saw Rain Shine in the box at an opera I was attending, I was absolutely star-struck. I very nearly missed the opportunity to meet another fascinating kirin seated next to me - some expatriate stock-trader, one of Fickle Current's distant diaspora connections - named §YMargin Call§!.\n\nIn-between awed glances at the Matriarch and the endless parade of arias, Margin Call and I were able to hold an interesting conversation. He trades in equities, not a surprise from his name, and apparently makes quite a fortune doing so, though he had a somewhat shabby appearance for a kirin who claimed to be so rich. And I soon figured out why. Margin Call is a terribly guilty sort of kirin. He all but blurted out his fury at all the recent news of §Ystrikes being repressed§! and §Ypeasants driven off their land§! for the industry that the Grand Gallop Onward has unleashed. I pointed out that his fortune comes from trading stock in the same companies that are breaking strikes and buying up land. His guilt was obvious, which I can only assume is why he confessed two more things to me. He has been donating generously to the §YFragrance Volunteer Fire Department§!, which, if it is anything like the Sorghum Department, is a worthy cause. But he is also funnelling money and laundering some more questionable operations for the §YRed Angry Fire§!! My gasp nearly got me expelled from the opera.\n\nHe quickly explained that he thinks the RAF - I shudder to think that they are legitimate enough to have an acronym - are fighting a good fight against exploitative bosses with unlimited foreign capital backing them up. When he started naming some particularly cruel business ventures, I uncomfortably recognized a few that §Ymy own family has a hoof in§!. When I asked him what he thought of §YAutumn Blaze§!, he surprised me again by saying that he admired the mare and her commitment to a prosperous Kiria for all. After all, she was personally selected by the Matriarch Superior, was she not? Blaze's apparent inexperience must play into one of the mysteries of Concord's benevolent will, he said. I think he believes that the Red Angry Fire will hold Blaze's hooves to the flame and force her to address the increasing inequality... or perhaps he is simply a stallion of two minds torn in two different directions.\n\nMargin Call did ask me about my own profession, and when I happily explained to him my work on eliminating the nirik state to save Kiria, he asked me how that could possibly work, when griffons and zebras fight among themselves over the same things I am afraid that kirin do?  In particular, he talked at length about the §YPrywhen Civil War§! - what good does eliminating the nirik state do if such a devastating conflict can arise even among griffons? By the time we departed, Margin Call was almost lecturing me, and I think he may have a point - Kiria's problems may be more §Yeconomic and social than biological§!. Food for thought... though I do not know that I completely agree."

And my stereotype of Rhapsody was confirmed when I found myself charged with §Yapostasy§! on my first day in the city and sent to a hearing before the newly-empowered §YProcurate§!! §YRiver Lily§! was with me the entire time, but faced no charges herself, and seemed more furious than anything else, promising she'd bring my family down on the matter if she had to. I didn't want that, I don't like relying on my last name to get out of trouble, but I'm not above it. And with the authorities not telling me anything about the charges, I had no idea what to expect!\n\nI was ordered to remain under house arrest at my hotel with Lily until my hearing, where the magistrate, a weary-looking mare named §YLuminous Flame§!, finally read the charges against me. For failing to anoint myself after passing under a sacred gate that I had never heard of, I was being charged with apostasy of the precepts of the Way of Fire, and threatened with imprisonment and a vast fine. Luckily, however, Luminous Flame seemed to strongly disagree with the lawyer (they insist on calling themselves Juridics here) prosecuting me. She pointed out that few if any of the thousands of kirin who trot under that gate bother to anoint themselves, and asked if the city was full of treacherous apostates, if they had not all been rounded up and brought to court. I have little familiarity with the Procurate's §Yarcane legal systems§!, but by the time she was finished arguing with the juridics, they had their tails between their legs and I was only facing some obscure infraction with a fine of just two taels. When I asked how I was to pay, she smiled and informed me that the court was awarding me a tael a day in recompense for two days of unecessary house arrest - and I walked away entirely free.\n\nI think somekirin in Rhapsody heard about my proposal in the Collegium and arranged to cause me trouble if I ever came to the city. And I got their message - River Lily and I have been enjoying a relaxing week together on the beaches of §YJubilee§!, away from the overzealous Procurate. Still, I have to admire Luminous Flame. While I was awaiting my hearing, I saw her hold court for four other cases, and in each one, she saw nothing wrong with interrupting, arguing with, and even outright shaming the juridics for various oversights and excessively zealous investigations. I doubt very much that she has a future higher in the ranks of the Procurate if she spends so much time annoying the legal community, but it's refreshing to see that sometimes the law is applied honestly, even in a city with such §Yarchaic and corrupt§! governance as Rhapsody.\n\nIt's strange, I always thought of the law as rigid and unbending, which is why it broke down so badly in the chaos before the §YSilence§!. But here I saw the law bend and flow in Luminous Flame's hooves until it arrived at a nothing punishment befitting my non-crime, all while still finding me guilty to satisfy the technicalities of the situation. Maybe the law is a tool that produces the right result in the right hooves, and its letter is less important than its spirit. If even Rhapsody's labyrinthian legal code can create justice, then maybe the important thing is just that we believe that justice will come, and work for it, regardless of where we find ourselves.\n\nI find myself sipping wine on a beach, snuggling with River Lily, and wondering if §YI ought to have more faith in my fellow kirin§!."

But I'm no longer sure I see them that way. Maybe at the time of my visit, modernity has not yet fully arrived in §YChrysanthemum§!, but it has certainly already made its mark. There are factories here, though not as many as in Fragrance, and there is social unrest here as well, though perhaps not as much as in Fragrance, either. But there have not been as many reports of §Ymysterious fires§! or nirik transformations in the West, and part of why I wanted to come here was to understand why the §YRed Angry Fire§! does not seem as prevalent as it is elsewhere. I recieved my answer the moment our ship docked to a wharf covered in picket signs, rather than dockworkers. Chrysanthemum's discontents are organized, and we found the city in the grips of a general strike!\n\nIt was difficult to find accomodation, but §YRiver Lily§! helpfully convinced a local mare running a canteen for the strikers that we would help cook and serve noodles if we could stay with her that night, and she agreed. And so I spent the day learning to make the famous wheat-flour noodles of the Western kirin, while listening to rousing speeches being delivered in the nearby square to crowds of strikers. One of the speakers introduced himself as §YKindling Flash§! - a name I recognized from somewhere, though I couldn't place it. His speech was by far the most passionate, and yet somehow, he was being passionate in asking for restraint, like he was somehow calming a fire by stoking it. He started off by commending Chrysanthemum's strikers for remaining peaceful and civil, and made a very pointed comment about the lack of reported arsons since the strike had started.\n\nClearly not an ally of the Red Angry Fire's brand of revolution, or at least, not publicly. He went on for a while about their demands - mostly the usual suspects. Higher wages, shorter hours, safer work, and fairer management. What impressed me the most was the fact that even with Chrysanthemum's industry relatively underdeveloped compared to the coasts, the working class kirin here were organized enough to put together a general strike in solidarity. It was a message that Kindling Flash stressed over and over, the §Yneed for solidarity§!, the need to ensure that all of Chrysanthemum's workers stuck together.There was something of a committee in the square that held a meeting after his speech, with some kind of loud and passionate vote - I couldn't tell over what. But the strike didn't end, so I guess it wasn't an agreement. I did see a few slickly-dressed kirin (and one griffon) who I can only guess were representatives of 'management' and who slunk away looking dissatisfied afterwards.\n\nI like what I saw here in Chrysanthemum. Kirin §Yvoting and debating and banding together§! to create change, without feeling the need to burn things down. Obviously with the Red Angry Fire around, the solidarity here isn't a universal feeling, but listening to Kindling Flash speaking, I hoped it would be, sooner than later. Vermilion could use a few Kindling Flashes. As could Fragrance.\n\nI also had a lot of fun making noodles with River all day, weird as that sounds. They tasted strange and I don't think either of us were really very good at making them, but we got nothing but smiles and thanks from the strikers we served. Not to mention, River looked pretty adorable when she tripped and landed face-first in a sack of flour. I was laughing so hard I fell down on top of her.\n\n§YThe West does have its charms§!."

I had thought Lychee was 'rural Kiria' - and now I've thought again. Clearwater can't have more than two hundred kirin living here, and most of them are spread out in farms miles from the village center. This might be the smallest 'place' that I've ever been. But even in such a tiny place, Kiria's reopening has been felt - the schoolteacher is not a kirin, but §Yan Equestrian pegasus named Silver Lining§!.\n\nShe politely answered my many questions about §YEquestria§! - what its great cities were like, what a truly modern society is like, what the §YPrincess Celestia's§! governance is like - but she seemed mostly to want to talk about Kiria. She told me that she'd come here from the other end of the world when she'd heard about the return of §YApplejack and Fluttershy's mission§!, and she felt a real calling to travel somewhere and help to spread and nurture harmony.\n\nI then asked how she'd ended up in Clearwater, and she explained she'd heard about a protest by the local peasants against their landlord and she'd come to help try to keep things civil. Immediately, I started imagining §Yenraged kirin threatening to go nirik§! in front of some aristocrat's mansion. But apparently, when Silver had arrived, she'd found a peaceful picket, the most violent thing in Clearwater being a rent strike. That, Silver said, is why she'd stayed. Here was a village that rallied together to make things better for themselves, but did so in §Yharmony§!, not as violent revolutionaries but as determined and peaceful protesters. Silver went on at some length about how much she admired the kirin people, particularly praising a kind of §Yresilience, determination, and grit§! that she hadn't seen anywhere else. And I suppose she had a point. Even in a village as small as Clearwater, the last few years since the end of the Silence must have felt like a typhoon. But even I could tell that Clearwater, for all its poverty, was a happy place, full of passionate and hardworking kirin.\n\n§YWho was that mare§! at the Collegium who so proudly proposed that these kirin should be carefully studied, screened, and controlled? §YWho was that mare§! who was disappointed when the Collegium called out her barbarity for what it was? §YWho was that mare§! that was so afraid of simple, honest peasants just like these, as if at any moment they would torch the world around her? I wish she was not the mare I have to see in every mirror, and all I can think about as I lie here awake, unable to look Lily in the eye. That mare who was so afraid of losing a Kiria she had never seen, so lost in the nightmares of her history books that she never saw the richness, the kindess, the passion and compassion of my countrymares.\n\nWhat did a caring mare like River Lily see in §Ya heartless, dismissive, miskirinthropic academic like me?§!"

But it was when I asked him about how often they were using these weapons against nirik that I felt my heart hit my stomach.\n\nThese are weapons for breaking up riots before a nirik transformation occurs, Singing Sword explained. Hitting rioters hard, and fast, with shock and awe, containing the mass of rioters, quickly breaking them into smaller groups, and suppressing anykirin who starts to smoulder. I have to admit that from his explanations, it seemed brutally effective, and his proud claims that there §Yhadn't been a single nirik transformation§! during one of his crackdowns spoke to that.\n\nOf course, if there hadn't been any nirik transformations... was his office perhaps being a little overzealous in all its brutal precautions?\n\nNot in the least, he assured me, with a sickeningly charming smile.

It's exciting, having such an important goal, being surrounded by like-minded and brilliant kirin all working for that goal.\n\nAfter stumping all day, one of the activists I was with pulled me aside and suggested I should run for office somewhere. I was flabbergasted, but she insisted. Apparently my passion was really on display on the canals of Verdant today, and that... got me thinking.\n\nIf Kiria nearly burned before §Ythe Silence§!, it was because we kirin failed to build a society that did not leave tens of thousands of kirin destitute and desperate. And for a century we've buried our heads in the sand to avoid confronting that failure again. But now we have a chance at §Yprosperity for all§!, with the benefit of hindsight to guide us and the fruits of modernity to carry us forward. We won't ever breed away the instinct to lash out when there is no other option - whatever was I thinking with that? But we can do our best to make sure that Kiria blooms for everykirin.\n\n§YMy journey across Kiria is over§!. One could never see everything... but I've seen what I needed to. I can thank River Lily for that. I do love that mare. We set out from Vermilion, and apart from the capital, there's only one great city of Kiria that Lily and I didn't visit, because I already knew it - it's the closest thing I have to a hometown in this country. Tomorrow, I am packing my bags, catching a train home, and I'm going to put my hoof in the ring in §YRadiance§!."

Newcomers in a rapidly-industrialising yet fractious Empire, with each Kingdom, Duchy, and Barony jealously protective of its own domestic industries, which were already starting to compete against one another to consolidate market share, the AKAG was forced to subcontract itself out to Griffonian competitors in order to generate income. Guild Artificers, formerly renowned throughout the world for the exquisite craftsmareship of their steam and clockwork constructs, were relegated to drafting blueprints for cheap, consumer-grade wristwatches and household boilers.\n\nIn 989, the AKAG underwent a leadership reshuffle. The death or retirement of the last of the AKAG's Artificer-Guildsmasters, senior craftsmares with prodigious artificing experience, cleared the way for the ascension of a new type of guildsmare to the Guild High Council — corporate executives, more often than not bearing degrees from the Middenheim School of Economics, who were more interested in profits than innovation and whose goal was to transform the Guild from an association of craftsmares and inventors into a competitive business.\n\nThe AKAG diversified its operations, taking advantage of technological advancements to market a myriad array of consumer goods, including cars, telephones, home appliances, radios, and the like. An expensive marketing campaign did much to burnish the AKAG brand, touting the sophisticated yet exotic appeal of the Guild's centuries-long legacy in faraway Kiria to win over Griffonian consumers.\n\nThe AKAG is now a highly successful multinational corporation with a talon in every pie. Sensing opportunity, the Guild's executives made sure to gain an early clawhold in the emerging market in electronics, mainly catering to high-net-worth clients like governments, militaries, and other corporations.\n\nThe AKAG which returned from exile bears little semblance to that which departed from Kiria a century ago. Its artificers are all salaried employees overseen by corporate managers, and the Guild invests heavily in real estate and financial speculation to supplement the income from its manufacturing operations.§!"

But once the Silence came, the fortunes of Sorghum and its foundries would turn. The then-Governor of the Foundry understood that the Silence would mean the end of her corporation, so she liquified all her assets and filed for "bankruptcy." In reality, she began making covert investments into far less glamorous industries. Though she had terminated all her labourers, she retained the Foundry's paramilitary outfit of foremares, notorious for their vigilance and brutality as whip-cracking overseers. Mercenary services and protection rackets became the primary sources of income for the Foundry in anarchic Kiria.\n\nAfter the Silence was lifted, the current Governor decided that a return to form was in order. Through the aggressive acquisition of farmland around the city through buyouts and evictions, the Foundry was able to construct entire industrial suburbs housing new foundries in which to stoke the flames of production, if only to supply its paramilitary army with top-of-the-line weapons for their next missions. Following in the hoofsteps of the Foundry's operating model prior to the Silence, those farmers from the surrounding countryside displaced by the accelerating modernisation of Kiria were lured to the city with promises of better opportunities, only to be trapped into debt servitude and made to work in backbreaking conditions for subsistence pay. Unfortunately, Sorghum's star will only rise higher, much to the dismay of the kirin of Peace-and-Plenty and the Great Mellifluve Delta as a whole, whose youth are spat out from the factories with scars both physical and psychological, missing limbs, or as corpses, and whose rivers and fields are soiled by the black effluent spewed forth from the bowels of the Foundry.§!"

All the largest naval manufacturers and merchants did business in the city, and the kirin there were proud of their role in the Realm's economy. But all of this changed when Noctilucent Charm saw fit to impose the Silence on the Realm. Her decrees abolished all hierarchies, currency, and from this, the concept of trade itself. To the city of Fragrance, it was nothing short of the apocalypse. The city was the traditional center for innovation and foreign contact in Kiria, and the Silence would surely mean the end of everything they held dear.\n\nSince the decrees of the Silence would also entail the disbanding of Vermilion's navy and army, save for a few Banners given special dispensation, as well as the loss of trade, the prospect of the Silence especially upset the Kirian fleet based in Fragrance. So, the fleet's captains did something radical: they mutinied, disobeyed orders to scuttle their ships, and turned to whaling, smuggling, or piracy to keep Fragrance's maritime economy alive. Vermilion's response was swift and brutal. In the last military campaign of the Vermilion Banner Army before their formal disbandment, they marched on Fragrance and enforced the Matriarch's decrees by force, demolishing Fragrance's port and shipyards in a punitive expedition and burning whatever ships had remained at anchor in the harbor.\n\nUpon the conclusion of the Silence, Fragrance saw its chance. The diaspora flooded into the city of their ancestors, and many returnee shipwrights pooled together their knowledge and capital to rebuild Fragrance's ruined shipyards and render them operational.

Eventually, you can fold it no more, and it becomes as tough as steel. The more hidden folds there are, the stronger it becomes."\n\nThe history of Crane goes back longer than almost any other corporation in Kiria, and presiding over it all for generations has been the Mallow lineage.\n\nThe mythical story of Crane's founding goes something like this: the first Mallow was a kirin named Lacebark, who lived on top of a mountain during the warlord era before the Way of Fire unified Kiria. As an army of nirik approached his home, he accepted that he would die, and decided, as his last wish, that somekirin else ought to prosper in his absence. Thus, he stowed all his meagre worldly possessions into a felt bag, and tied them to a large paper crane he had made. He then released the crane into a gust of wind that swept it off the mountain, and he watched it fly away. To his surprise, Lacebark survived the nirik attack, and lamented that he had given away all he had to the winds. However, a few weeks later, a paper crane would fly into his window with a different felt bag attached, and containing half of the items he had first sent out — gold ingots, precious gemstones, beautiful porcelain ware, and rolls of intricate masterwork calligraphy. Each week, another crane returned, and as Lacebark took the chance to send out more wealth, more and more returned each week. Thus was birthed the Crane investing consortium.\n\nCrane is powerful not because it excells in one particular industry, but because it has a hoof in every pot. It is even said that some of the loans that first funded the Sycee Trading House came from the Mallow family, so that the Trading House would always have a soft spot for Crane in their future dealings. Crane today is respected by all, even the Vermilion Dynasty, for its wide reach and the hundreds of thousands of kirin that are variously indebted to it.\n\nCrane cares little for the temporal affairs of the Realm, save for those that concern its most modern and commercially-promising venture, Crane Aircraft.

KIR_rain_shine:0 "Rain Shine"
KIR_rain_shine_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 2 April 945 in Vermilion\n\n§YBiography:§! Matriarch Superior Rain Shine has lived her entire life upholding the imperial decrees that instituted the societal and cultural stagnation and decay of the Realm of Kiria, and never once did she imagine that she would be the kirin to undo them. The decrees had been issued by her mother, Matriarch Superior Noctilucent Charm, in 902, and when she passed in 971, Rain Shine swore upon her ascension pyre that she would maintain her mother's policies and devote her life to studying the Way of Fire and the teachings of the fire goddess, Concord, to protect Kiria.\n\nHowever, in 1006, an unexpected diplomatic mission from Equestria ventured into the isolated nation and reached Rain Shine's court in Vermilion. There, two bearers of the Elements of Harmony, Fluttershy and Applejack, argued that they had seen kirin living in poverty and squalor all throughout the realm as a result of The Silence, and while it was effective in preventing nirik transformations, it needed to end for the good of all kirinkind. They offered Equestrian aid in getting the nation back on its hooves, and Rain Shine, isolated from her subjects in the royal palace and oblivious to their plights, realized that continuing The Silence would only spell doom for her subjects in the long run. Though she had sworn to uphold her mother's policies, once Rain Shine learned of the terrible cost The Silence had on the people of Kiria, she agreed to repeal her mother's decrees and end it once and for all.\n\nNow, with The Silence ending in Kiria, Rain Shine has pledged to make up for her mother's mistakes and bring the kirin species into the modern age. But after 60 years of seclusion in Vermilion, Rain Shine may find that her authority is nowhere near as strong as her mother's was a century ago.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! Twotail813"

KIR_winter_frost:0 "Winter Frost"
KIR_winter_frost_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 29 December 966 in Agate\n\n§YBiography:§!: Born in the mountainous monastery-town of Agate, Winter Frost was surrounded with the religious and mystic fervor of The Way of Fire from the moment of her birth. As she grew older, the young kirin quickly found herself deeply infatuated with the love and divine guidance the Kirin fire goddess, Concord, had blessed her people with, and as such, Winter devoted her entire life to understanding Concord's teachings and sharing them with the rest of the kirin species. Regularly spending many dark winter mornings in mediation along the highest peaks of the holy mountain range that surrounded Vermilion, Winter Frost's devotion was soon rewarded when she was chosen to go to Vermilion and further her service to Concord by serving Matriarch Superior Rain Shine herself. As such, Winter became one of the few kirin who had personally met and interacted with the reclusive Matriarch before The Silence ended, and she became personally devoted and loyal to the Matriarch alongside her fierce devotion to The Way of Fire. Such devotion led to her becoming personally favored by the Kirin Matriarch, and by the time The Silence was officially repealed, Winter Frost was the most influential priestess in Vermilion.\n\nAs The Silence gave way to a new era of politics in Vermilion, Winter Frost became the loudest critic of reckless modernisation and provided a solid rock to anchor the concerns of the kirin religion to, regularly pushing against motions, bills, and decrees that she believed threatened the sanctity of Concord's divine teachings. When Kiria collapsed into civil war as a result of her protests being ignored, the priestess soon replaced the inept and naive Imperial Premier Autumn Blaze as Rain Shine's most important advisor. Now, Winter Frost works to bring Kiria back to its roots of firm faith and unyielding devotion to Concord and The Way of Fire, and find the answers to Kiria's modernization problem in Concord's teachings.\n\n§YPortrait by:§!

KIR_fickle_current:0 "Fickle Current"
KIR_fickle_current_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 11 October 953 in Skyfall\n\n§YBiography:§!: Despite his rise to power in Kiria, Fickle Current was not born a son of the Realm. Rather, he was foaled in Skyfall, where his family had fled the crushing economic collapse that struck hold of Kiria as The Silence was imposed at the beginning of the 10th century. It was there in Skyfall that the Sycee Trading House, one of the Realm's strongest trading conglomerates before The Silence, had relocated, and Current's family enjoyed close ties to the Trading House that left them extremely wealthy. With the wealth that his family possessed, Current was able to afford a prestigious education in Yale, where he was personally tutored by Cypress Snow, another member of the Kirin diaspora and its foremost literati. Under Snow's guidance, Current learned to sharpen his business acumen and cunning insight that would serve him well as a successful businesskirin and, later, the natural fit for leader of the NAKP during the Grand Gallop Onward in Kiria.\n\nIt was only late in 1006 when Fickle Current stepped hoof in Fragrance, the city of his ancestors, for the first time as The Silence began to lift across the Realm. Remembering the tales of how ineptitude and superstition in Vermilion once forced his family into exile and nearly impoverished them, Current soon resolved to be a champion for the kirin who lost everything in Fragrance and do everything he could to truly modernize Kiria according to what he and the rest of the Kirin diaspora knew in Skyfall and throughout western Griffonia. Unfettered capitalism would be the order of the day, for the wheels of progress in such a backwards land could only be turned with the grease of tremendous investment into the Realm. If Kiria ever wanted to truly join the modern world as a functional nation, it would take an almost unimaginable level of investment, and so Current has resolved to do everything he can to make the nation an enticing opportunity for the wealthy.\n\n§YPortrait by:§!

KIR_autumn_blaze:0 "Autumn Blaze"
KIR_autumn_blaze_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 20 September 977 in Massicot\n\n§YBiography:§!: Autumn Blaze was never meant to rise as far as she has in her life, born the daughter to poor farmers in Massicot. Though originally destined for a life of the same hardships and meagre living as her parents, Autumn's family managed to get their daughter residence in a temple to Concord in Massicot at the age of seven, where she studied for five years before dropping out and returning to the family farm. In those five years, however, Autumn learned how to read and write, how to perform arithmetic, and perhaps most importantly of all, how to study and interpret the teachings of the fire goddess Concord in religious texts. Though she would never use that particular skill in service to The Way of Fire, Autumn made excellent use of her command over words as both a sword to attack with and a shield to defend against, allowing her to use it as a tool to carve her own path in life. Though she originally put it toward making musicals, plays, and even thought-provoking comedic dissections of the stagnation of kirin life under The Silence, it would serve her the best in 1006, when the Equestrian delegation to Kiria wandered into Massicot.\n\nBeing one of the only kirin in Massicot who knew Ponish because of her studies, Autumn was able to guide the Equestrians, two ponies named Fluttershy and Applejack, to Vermilion, where they sought to make contact with Kiria's Matriarch Superior, Rain Shine, and establish diplomatic ties. Because of her efforts, they were successful, and Autumn ultimately formed a close friendship with Rain Shine when all was said and done. That friendship led her to become Rain Shine's first premier, and guided her through the All-Kirin Plenum for National Revival as its steadfast and enthusiastic leader.\n\nNow, with her like-minded Harmonists in secure control over Kiria, Autumn can extend her influence once more, having learned many hard lessons from the Plenum. With the country in her hooves, she seeks to reconcile Kiria's traditionalist and theocratic past with a vision of a modern Harmonic nation like Equestria. Time will tell if she is successful.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! Twotail813"

KIR_rising_sun:0 "Rising Sun"
KIR_rising_sun_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 13 July 969 in Chrysanthemum\n\n§YBiography:§!: Not much is known about the mare who calls herself Rising Sun, and what is known paints only a vague picture at best. By her own admission, Rising Sun was born in Chrysanthemum and studied to become a priestess in the Way of Fire, as such a lifestyle was the only way to escape the utter stagnation of The Silence while it still held Kiria in its stranglehold. But even as a priestess of The Way of Fire, the mare was often regarded by her peers as too smart for her own good and twice as cunning as the most mischievous fox. She would regularly debate her senior priests about the merits and drawbacks of strictly adhering to the Matriarch Superior's decrees when all they brought about was suffering and ruin for the people of Kiria, and was regularly chastised for it. For the mare who was too smart by half for the lifestyle she had chosen, Rising Sun had reached a frustrating theological dead end to the problems surrounding Kiria.\n\nRealizing that she would never advance as a priestess in The Way of Fire, Rising Sun sailed down the Mellifluve where she ultimately ended up in Verdant at the age of 20. Once there, she quickly realized that Verdant was prospering where Chrysanthemum languished. The Silence was still in full swing over the city, but the many island communities of Verdant had formed their own cooperative communes that worked together to the benefit of all without breaking any of the Matriarch's decrees. Additionally, there was no rigid religious structure that dominate the everyday lives of the kirin in the city, only an individual communion between the average kirin and Concord, with spiritual leaders to aid their followers along toward their own revelations. Rising Sun quickly immersed herself in these beliefs, and in no time at all, had risen to the top of this new sect of The Way of Fire. Naming her sect the Rising Fire, Rising Sun would return to Chrysanthemum to spread her new teachings to the kirin of the west, and made many visits to towns and workshops around Kiria before ultimately ending up in Vermilion as the Grand Gallop Onward progressed to bring her teachings to a new level of national awareness.\n\nNow, Rising Sun finds herself on top of the Realm's food chain, in a position of almost unlimited authority and power. The Rising Fire has risen with her as well, and her beliefs are ready to be shared across the Realm. The Rising Fire is grappling with The Way of Fire, and Rising Sun will be the one to bring about a new era of theology and change to Kiria, one it never could have imagined before.\n\n§YPortrait by:§!

COC_kindling_flash_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 2 February 963 in Verdant\n\n§YBiography:§!: A grassroots preacher from Verdant, Kindling Flash has always been one of the loudest and most persistent voices speaking out against the oppression of the Realm by the Way of Fire and the need to bring liberation to Kiria through the adoption of the tenets of the Rising Fire. For many years, Kindling sailed from island to island in the delta of the Great Mellifluve to preach the tenets of the Rising Fire, and on one of those journeys, he happened to engage with Rising Sun, who had traveled to Verdant on her own spiritual journey. The two debated religion and philosophy for many hours, and it was ultimately through Kindling that the charismatic and fiery priestess adopted the Rising Fire as her faith. In the years before the end of the Silence and throughout the Grand Gallop Onward, the two would work in unison to spread the teachings of the Rising Fire to the masses.\n\nWhen civil war came to Kiria, Kindling found the importance of his role and faith enhanced, and traveled across the country to spread the ideas of the Rising Fire and encourage the kirin of the west to join the fight in Concord's name. Unfortunately, for all his skill as an orator, he could not move the populace to overcome the might of the NAKP, and so when the NAKP claimed victory over the Realm, Kindling disappeared into the many islands of Verdant once more. When the Children of Concord rose up in revolt, however, Kindling soon took his place among their number once again, continuing to spread his message of a free Kiria, and adopting some of the beliefs of the Radiant Trinity into his messaging. Maybe through the Radiant Trinity rather than the Rising Fire, Kindling will be able to finally motivate the kirin of the Realm to seize the freedom and peace so long denied to them through one last struggle."
COC_dayspring_rose_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 21 May 990 in Chrysanthemum\n\n§YBiography:§!: Dayspring Rose certainly never had an easy life, as short as it has been. Abandoned as a foal at a young age, Dayspring Rose was taken in by a Rising Fire temple in Chrysanthemum, which provided for her and other orphans in the city whose parents had either abandoned them or been taken from them during the stagnancy of The Silence. The mystics of the temple taught her how to read and write and fostered in her a devoted fervor to Concord and the beliefs the Rising Fire practiced, proclaimed heretical by Vermilion. But it was Rising Sun who played the largest role in shaping Dayspring's foalhood, taking the young filly under her wing and encouraging her studies of both book and blade. Dayspring grew deeply attached to Rising, eventually seeing her as a surrogate mother of sorts, and forged a permanent loyalty to the older mare and her exciting gravitas.\n\nDuring the civil war, Dayspring often found herself sent out on assignments at Rising's request, employing both her skills as a peerless swordsmare and an efficient official to solve matters of both war and state in the struggle. When the Rising Fire collapsed and Rising Sun disappeared, Dayspring found herself rudderless in a Kiria that was hardly what she was promised growing up. Her drifting eventually took her to the Children of Concord, and now she fights in service of new allies, but with much the same goal: the complete liberation of Kiria from oppression and violence, and the birth of the peaceful Realm she believed in since she was a foal."

Its Matriarch-Commander, Firethorn was raised in a Banner that had both evolved into a complex clan and retained enough soldiers to fight alongside its equals (at least before the Silence).\n\nIn the Silence's last years, Firethorn had seen the folly of the Silence a century in the making. Her clan had propped themselves up thanks to their loyalty to the Realm, but outside the Banner's cosy home villages, the rest of Kiria had languished: just miles away, a small city had thrived; that seemed a lie when all she saw and walked through was a ghost town populated by farmers who lived hoof to mouth.\n\nThat memory returned when Rain Shine announced the Silence's end. No longer will her Banner and the soldiers she takes care of serve themselves and the decrepit pieces of a dying government. A reborn Realm she serves: the Realm and all the kirin that are now suddenly free.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! Tek"
HOC_firethorn_desc:0 "It was not long ago that Firethorn had much to flaunt of her own accord.

She had been targeted by the Hierocracy as a high-level threat; her Banner would be given to some yeskirin who was not so willing to rock the boat.\n\nInstead of execution or imprisonment, Firethorn received Hyacinth, a democratic experiment. Allegedly. Her more cynical side saw the intent behind the open city's existence, that of pinning democracy down while keeping it technically alive. The side of her that yearned for the days of hope, when Autumn and the RaHP and every other kirin who saw better days ahead led the way forward, believed it to be an opportunity. The New Standard Army, the Massicot cadets, and Hyacinth's own soldiers had their base moved here, a sufficient substitute for her Banner.\n\nWith a legislative assembly, a flexible constitution by her side, and one big enough army, Firethorn is ready to show the Realm real harmony in action.\n\n§YPortrait by:§!

Born as a poor fishermare in Nacre on the pirate-controlled Auburn Isle, Roaring Fire joined her first pirating expedition at the age of 11 and never looked back. As she gained experience, so too did she gain respect from pirates all over the Isle for her fearless bravado and sharp mind. By the time she turned 19 she was captain of her own ship, and through clever diplomacy and cunning intrigue she began to amass a coalition of pirates and assembled a small flotilla. It was with this flotilla that, on one fateful night in 997, she lured the previous de facto pirate leader of the Auburn Isle and his ship out of his cove and beset upon him with a ferocity pirates still talk about in Nacre today. While cannonfire ripped through the wooden hulls of both junks, Roaring Fire swung off a rope and launched herself onto the enemy ship, where in a brutal display of blood and death, she cut through pirate after pirate until finally finding and besting the enemy captain. When she returned to Nacre the following morning with that pirate in chains, she cemented her legend and earned the loyalty of the brigands and buccaneers that called Auburn Isle home.\n\nThanks to her cunning, the pirates of the Auburn Isle have managed to survive into a new age. After successfully negotiating with Fickle Current to join his forces with her pirate armada serving as a mercenary navy, Roaring Fire spared her home from destruction by a resurgent Realm of Kiria and saved her pirates from the gallows. Now, standing at the forefront of a brave new world, the pirates of the Auburn Isle are firmly devoted to their pirate queen, and Roaring Fire is determined to not let them down.\n\n§YPortrait by:§!

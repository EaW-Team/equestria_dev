#Slána, lover of our souls,
#Let Queens to thy embrace fly,
#While tempestuously the rain falls,
#While the hailstorm still is high.
#O Saviour, have they tried,
#Surge past all our caste;
#Safe into the haven guide;
#O receive their souls at last.

#"In politics, lies are simply facts that haven't been repeated enough."
#"If you cannot shake the target on your back, you have to create a more tempting target."
#""Out of my way!" Cernhelm roared, throwing the royal guards aside with a mighty shove before barging against the door. The massive gates, meant to be opened by four together, creaked and were slammed open as Cernhelm pushed, heaved, and threw them open. The chamber beyond was regal, but the signs of grief were scattered all over them like petals around the bud that was Gytha's bed. Storming inside, Cernhelm saw the dismal sight of the one he had come for: she lay on the bed, having pushed herself slowly up to see what was happening, and already he saw the play going over her face. Shock, surprise, composure so quick it was as if her life depended on it, and then that damn calm.\n\n"I did not expect yo—" she began before he reached her, stepping up to the bed and wrapping his arms around her, without reservation or hesitation.\n\n"They are all idiots!" he exclaimed. "Foals and narrow-minded buffoons! They got a treasure, and they threw it away because they wouldn't know their flanks from it! You weren't wrong, you were greater than I ever imagined, and I thought you didn't even need me to triumph! I'm sorry Gytha, I'm so sorry..." The words came pouring out of him, tears beginning to well up. "You weren't wrong, you were radiant, and damn those southern morons for not seeing it! But not you, never you!"\n\nGytha had frozen at first in his embrace, but as he fell silent her breathing, rapid as the surprise was, turned ragged. A sniffle turned into a sob, and then tears rolled down her cheeks as she returned the embrace, crying in grief and pain over the events of the last months. All her hopes and dreams had shattered, creating a bed of glass for her to lie in. Now, she found if not peace then at least solace, leaning into his embrace and finally, after so long, crying. She wept over how she had hoped for a kinder world for her people and had it all thrown back into his face. Yet, she wept because the icy cold of despair that had settled over her shattered as well, broken by this rough, uncouth hillpony who came for her when nobody else did.\n\nUnseen by either Chief or Queen was a smartly dressed Feilean watching from beyond the threshold. A soft smile adorned his face as he silently closed the door. He had been one of the many who doubted that his sister's affection of Cenhelm was anything more than a passing crush, and he wasn't often wrong.\n\nThis was one of the few times that he was thankful that he was wrong."

#Two nothings is nothing. That's mathematics! You can argue with me, but you can't argue with figures! Two half nothings is a whole nothing!

#I preface this with mentioning one of my favourite writers growing up, our popular hero, Dairile. And I remember her exact words: "You asked my father to wait, my brother to wait, my uncle to wait. How long must I wait for equality? How long must I wait on rights, liberty and acceptance?" As a changeling nymph, her words resonated with me because I knew that the continent denied me my rights, and I personalised this feeling.
#But, as I grew, I began to understand: poor ponies were denied. They dismissed destitute dogs. Everyone but the leaders, that small group among all of us, have been declined our rights. So I ask you to look to your peers present. Look to them, and say, "friends, the time is now. There are more of us; we are stronger, and we will wait no longer."
#The time is now. When asked to pledge your support, I need you to carry the memory of my words: changelings, ponies, dogs, griffons, males, females, we are all in this together. We are united. Our time is right now.
#We will not wait fifty more years, nor another month. We will not even wait for another queen.  It is not some abstract that may happen in the future. It is not something that might be, that could be, that would be, that should be. It's not coming tomorrow; this is happening NOW.
#Our companion Cader Sclerite shall be Greneclyf's leader and hope. Pledge your support, as I have, to him.

#Day of Democracy

#Our only strength is the will to survive, knowing that we will perish, knowing nothing more absolute.
#We rise, towards the sun! Those who died, died fighting. They are now buried in the sun. No need to mourn, there is a raid to the sun.
#They did not let us sing our songs. They are afraid, afraid of the dawn. They are adfraid of hope, but our songs will be sung.
#There is a destiny above destiny.
#There is a victory growing with every morning.
#There is a God beyond existence or nonexistence.
#There is my country beyond everything, my beloved.
#There is the evil that tortures and tears me down.
#There are songs to be sung in affectation of our victories.
#Beyond the next morning, there is a victory waiting to be won.
#Do not doubt the One! There is a decision coming from the heavens.
#Fear not when the dark falls! There is an artist painting the sun.
#Do not dare to surrender! There is a victory that grows with defeat.

#Some political analysts make the mistake that their enemies should also be ours.
#It is not not those who can inflict the most, but those who can suffer the most who will conquer.
#Dirty Tools for a Dirty Job
#Tabhair arm dó láithreach! Ar son saoirse agus bua! Arna eisiúint ag coiste cosanta nGreneclyf

#There will be no people in Greneclyf, for all property of every sort shall belong to the Ruler. The people are her children and she shall care for them. Each person will be given freely by their neighbours whatever they require for their use, which is as much as any one may reasonably desire.

#Everyone shall work half the tme and play half the time, and the people shall enjoy the work as much as they do the play, because it is good to be occupied to have something to do. There shall be no cruel overseers to watch them, and no one to rebuke or find fault with them. So each one shall be proud to do all that they can for their friends and neighbours, and be glad when they would accept the the things they produced.

#Everyone, no matter what they produced for the community, shall be supplied by the neighbours with food and clothing and a house and furniture and ornaments and games. If by chance the supply ever runs short, more shall be taken from the great storehouses of the Ruler, which would afterwards be filled up again when there is more of any article than the people needed.

 ### STARTING BRANCH ###

 NCH_coronation:0 "Coronate the Queen"
 NCH_coronation_desc:0 "It's been less than a week since Queen Nóra was found dead, and though her daughter Gytha had already been elected as Queen, she is still unordained. Only after her coronation will Queen Gytha be allowed to handle the affairs of state.\n\nAll hail Queen Gytha!"

 NCH_assess_the_situation:0 "Addressing the Dairile Movement"
 NCH_assess_the_situation_desc:0 "Rising tensions among our people with the continentals have permeated in most of our society, and are disrupting Greneclyfian life. We must convene the Council of Royals to deliberate the best course of action for our country if we are to save it."

 NCH_meet_the_continent:0 "Preparing for the Continent"
 NCH_meet_the_continent_desc:0 "The Queen has spoken, and all of the Royals agree; we must mount several expeditions to the world beyond to gain a better relationship with the continentals. We shall prepare the necessary diplomats and means immediately."

 NCH_our_old_friends:0 "Our Old Friends"
 NCH_our_old_friends_desc:0 "Farbrook has long stood by us through thick and thin. Our expedition to Farbrook is mostly to help establish a presence on the continent in a safe harbour, though we do intend to expand our current relationships. These negotiations with Farbrook should be nothing more than a formality."
 
 NCH_trade_diamond_dogs:0 "The Dogs of Diamond Mountain"
 NCH_trade_diamond_dogs_desc:0 "We have seldom interacted with the canids on the continent, but they are the first step in meeting and communicating some of the other, more belligerent species present. It won't be easy to get the Diamond Dogs to agree to our terms, but our diplomats are confident in success."
 
 NCH_trade_bakara:0 "The Sailors of Bakara"
 NCH_trade_bakara_desc:0 "Bakarian ships are not an unordinary sight within our waters, but we have never truly opened former communications with Bakara. They are a naval power that we ought to begin a friendly relationship with if we have any intention to open ourselves to the world."

 NCH_trade_nimbusia:0 "The Pegasi of Nimbusi"
 NCH_trade_nimbusia_desc:0 "The tales of ancient Nimbusia have been in the collective memory of Greneclyfians for a long time, and the prospect of encountering the Nimbusians has some diplomats on edge. They are still the military arm of the River Coalition, and we must make a good impression at Nimbusi if we're to have a chance in the Coalition."
 
 NCH_trade_ponaidhean:0 "The Tribes of Pònaidhean" 
 NCH_trade_ponaidhean_desc:0 "In many respects, the ponies of Pònaidhean are close to our way of life. Their connection and adherence to the principles of harmony and friendship are indicative of a wise people, and we would be remiss not to approach the Taoiseach Coalition with a friendly hoof. We can share our pearls of wisdom so that we both can become something greater."

 NCH_trade_deponya:0 "The Traditionalists of Buckbanburg"
 NCH_trade_deponya_desc:0 "Much like us, Deponyans have found themselves mostly closed off to the world and, if our reports are correct, are at risk of being left behind by the changes of modernity. Deponya is steeped in old views of the world, and will likely be challenging to get a positive response from them. However, if we can make friends with Deponyans, there would be little to stop us."

 NCH_trade_river_republic:0 "The Riverlanders of Rijekograd"
 NCH_trade_river_republic_desc:0 "The River Republic is decidedly the heart and unifying will of the River Coalition. Any hope for possible integration into the wider world stage lies in convincing the ponies of Rijekograd of our good intentions. Once assured, any further efforts will undoubtedly receive the Republic's support."
 
 NCH_trade_wittenland:0 "The Unicorns of Wittenburgh" 
 NCH_trade_wittenland_desc:0 "Wittenland is a land of unicorns with a deep understanding of magic and, by some reports, deep pockets. Some might question our motivation in seeking monetary support from the wealthy monarchy, but both it and the intention of sharing knowledge in magic are true. We only aim to engage in the discussion of magic and to stimulate both of our economies."

 NCH_trade_lake_city:0 "The Guardians of Jezeragrad"
 NCH_trade_lake_city_desc:0 "The Jezeragrad Republic has languished, and its people require help keeping check of the aggressive griffons to the west and south. Though they may have friends from the Coltstream Treaty, Lake City will graciously welcome another friend. Should the worst come to pass, we will show the world that we shall no longer sit idly by when evil threatens peace."
 
 NCH_trade_success:0 "Accepted by All"
 NCH_trade_success_desc:0 "Through Queen Gytha's and our diplomats' collective efforts, we have achieved our primary goals of normalising diplomatic relations and restoring the faith in our people. Our success is cause for celebration, though we still have much work ahead of us." 

 NCH_partial_success:0 "Battered but Unyielding"
 NCH_partial_success_desc:0 "The Riverlands are beyond us. We were foolish to trust them, but this endeavour has revealed who our real friends are. In spite of the grief and hardships that our people have suffered through, our path ahead is not one to be tread alone."
 
 NCH_a_new_day_in_view:0 "A New Day in View"
 NCH_a_new_day_in_view_desc:0 "Despite the difficulties, the Queen has come out stronger from the challenges of her plan. With friends both old and new, Greneclyf can now look towards the future of this uncertain world."

 NCH_crisis_of_faith:0 "Crisis of Faith"
 NCH_crisis_of_faith_desc:0 "They've all refuted our peaceful offers. Have we been wrong to trust in the idea of Harmony? Was Queen Gytha wrong?"

 NCH_coronation_oiren:0 "Coronate the New Queen"
 NCH_coronation_oiren_desc:0 "We have suffered through two calamities mere months apart, and our people are giving into despair! With Queen Gytha gone, we now must look to a new Queen to bring order to Greneclyf before the situation spirals out of control. Only Oiren, once ordained as the rightful ruler, can deliver Greneclyfians from their desperation."

 NCH_a_new_path:0 "A New Path"
 NCH_a_new_path_desc:0 "It's clear that Gytha's way is no longer viable for the prolonged survival of the Hive. We must now seriously reconsider our traditions and way of life if we are to survive in this uncertain world."

 NCH_invite_cader_sclerite:0 "Summon the CPM"
 NCH_invite_cader_sclerite_desc:0 "The Comhghuaillíocht Poblachtach Mór has garnered much support from the Dairile Movement. Though its republican platform seems counterintuitive, the leaders of the CPM are modern changelings have a better understanding of the world of today. Perhaps a radical change is in order?"
 
 NCH_the_old_ways:0 "Stair Grena"
 NCH_the_old_ways_desc:0 "Greneclyfians everywhere are still reeling from the rejection of the ponies on the continent. The Leahman philosophy has been soundly discredited, and our way of life has been put into question. Perhaps, delving deep into our people's history, we shall uncover an answer to our dilemma?"

It is a gift, not a curse!"
 
 NCH_infiltrator_network:0 "Infiltrate The Hillponies"
 NCH_infiltrator_network_desc:0 "Before, when we could call the Hillponies of Farbrook friends, we merely visited their lands.

 NCH_expand_the_networks:0 "Expand the Networks"
 NCH_expand_the_networks_desc:0 "We've learned much about the Hillponies, and we were almost shocked to find that they are a split people vulnerable to attack.

In such times, however, we can resolve our differences and bring them back into the fold."

 NCH_oiren_crusaders_desc:0 "Changelings are the product of the Great Hatcher Below, the first and only emotivores of the world. Others call us parasites, but if left to our own devices, we can easily dominate any sentient creature.

 ### MILITARY BRANCH ###

 NCH_reorganize_the_army:0 "Reorganising the Army"
 NCH_reorganize_the_army_desc:0 "For time immemorial, there has been no 'standing army' in Greneclyf. The closest thing to it has been the Household Guard. Being the only professional soldiers, the drones-at-arms typically levied by the many Clanns simply do not compare. We must take immediate steps to reform our military thinking and our methods."

 NCH_form_a_dedicated_officer_corps:0 "Form a Dedicated Officer Corps"
 NCH_form_a_dedicated_officer_corps_desc:0 "Traditionally, military officers are exclusively Royals who have shown an affinity towards the command of units and soldiers. While this may ensure a pool of competent leaders, its size is limited by the number of possible candidates. Offering a military education as well as allowing the enrollment of Drones will expand that pool, and form a standard to which all future commanders will adhere to."

 NCH_the_industrial_question:0 "The Logistics Question"
 NCH_the_industrial_question_desc:0 "Modern land warfare requires an infrastructure of logistics on a scale previously unseen in Greneclyf, and it necessitates dedicated batallions solely responsible for maintaining lines of communication and supplies to keep our forces fighting for longer. As such, steps must be taken for to form such batallions, as well as the industrial capacity to supply the necessary supplies."

 NCH_purchase_production_licenses:0 "Purchase Production Licenses"
 NCH_purchase_production_licenses_desc:0 "Greneclyf has little experience with the use modern weapons, even less so with the production of them and their munitions. No matter what we do, any native designs will simply not compare to those of foreign designs. While we set aside the necessary funds to set up the necessary industries, we must search for weapon and equipment deals abroad."

 NCH_domestic_arms_factories:0 "Domestic Arms Factories"
 NCH_domestic_arms_factories_desc:0 "Our people have been fairly self-sufficient, so why should our weapons and military equipment industries be any different? Everything that we use should be of Greneclyfian origin. As we are searching for new designs domestically, Greneclyf must immediately begin a massive construction programme to be the foundation of our industries."

 NCH_limited_expansion:0 "Limited Expansion"
 NCH_limited_expansion_desc:0 "We mustn't upset the current environment with the expansion of our current guilds and workshops. Our crafters and metalworkers must be allowed to adapt to the new requirements and tools, lest we bring about unrest among the guilds."

 NCH_give_more_funds:0 "Offer More Funds"
 NCH_give_more_funds_desc:0 "Greneclyf must do everything to catapult our idustries forwards, no matter how sudden it may appear to our workers. To placate any qualms that they may have, we'll appropriate the necessary funds and capital."

 NCH_modern_firearms:0 "Reichswaffen Rifles"
 NCH_modern_firearms_desc:0 "The Reichswaffen Company in the Griffon Empire has made massive waves in the armaments industry, of which even we have felt. Our experts have experimented with their rifles, and have deemed them to be the best from the continent. Let us send a formal offer to their company to establish a cooperative enterprise on our isle."

 NCH_modern_artillery:0 "Greda Guns"
 NCH_modern_artillery_desc:0 "Wingbardy's heavy weapons have long been renowned for their efficacy, and many have called their artillery the most fearsome on the continent. Greda is an old cannon designer, and they may be willing to share their designs with us if we make a good enough offer."

 NCH_automotives:0 "Freemare Automotives"
 NCH_automotives_desc:0 "The pony enclave of New Mareland to the south-west has inherited a strong automotive tradition from Equestria, and it is home to the Freemare Automotive company. Following an economic depression, they may be looking for new business opportunities; let us offer them one that they can't refuse."

 NCH_armoured_vehicles:0 "KLAA Prototypes"
 NCH_armoured_vehicles_desc:0 "The Changeling Lands are at the cutting edge of armour development, and it would be remiss of us to not approach one of their famed designer companies for some of their armoured behemoths. Perhaps they may even be willing to set up a mutual company on Greneclyf dedicated to the develompent of tanks."
 
 NCH_inf_weapons:0 "Lochainn Loadaid"
 NCH_inf_weapons_desc:0 "Our smithies are renowned for their steel weapons, and are thus the best candidate to expand their expertise into firearms. They shall be aggregated into the Lochainn Loadaid na nGaibhaire, and offered the tools and funds to begin work on our homegrown firearms."
 
 NCH_heavy_weapons:0 "Airtléire na nGreneclyf"
 NCH_heavy_weapons_desc:0 "Perhaps less radical of an idea than a hoof-held firearm, bombards and cannons have nevertheless not been part of Greneclyfian combined arms. We must set up the appropriate smithies and ironworks to be placed under a single entity solely dedicated to the production of these mighty weapons. Only then will artillery become a permament fixture of the Greneclyfian army."
 
 NCH_automotive_industry:0 "Biúró na nGluaisteán"
 NCH_automotive_industry_desc:0 "Machines and the production of their parts is a wholly new field of manufacturing that must be built from the ground up if we are ever to compete with the equivalent industries of other nations. Difficult as it is, we ought to focus on motorising our society, rather than producing machines solely dedicated for war."
 
 NCH_tank_investments:0 "The Greneclyfian Tanc"
 NCH_tank_investments_desc:0 "Automotives have their place in war, but armoured fighting vehicles have shown to be decisive tools in war and force multipliers. The 'tanc' should be prioritised, lest we be left at a grievous disadvantage when battling superiour forces."
 
 NCH_continue_the_purchases:0 "Extend the Lincenses"
 NCH_continue_the_purchases_desc:0 "Our production licenses have proven to be a success, and there is little reason to not build upon them. Following the foreign designs may prove difficult to replicate, but will be on par with those of any potential foe."

 NCH_end_the_deals:0 "Terminate the Licenses"
 NCH_end_the_deals_desc:0 "We have learned what we could from the strangers, so we should consider adapting what we've purchased to suit our industrial capacity. More modern designs will come by more slowly without direct support from the foreign experts, but it is time for us to start producing purely native designs."

 NCH_tighten_conscription_regulations:0 "Tighten Conscription Regulations"
 NCH_tighten_conscription_regulations_desc:0 "There is a reason why only the best were recruited into the Household Guard of old, and while we may loosen some of the more stringent requirements for enrollment into the Guard itself, we should still be looking for the best to form our file and rank."

 NCH_call_to_arms:0 "Call to Arms"
 NCH_call_to_arms_desc:0 "We are few in numbers, and a fight with the throngs of griffons and ponies would easily overwhelm our forces. While Greneclyf will never match its foes number for number, we should do our best to close that numerical gap, even if it comes at the cost of enrolling lesser recruits."

 NCH_perfected_planning:0 "Perfect Planning"
 NCH_perfected_planning_desc:0 "Our people can only offer so many soldiers, so we should not needlessly squander them. We can avoid useless losses by having a doctrinal goal at every level of the army: from the tactical to the strategic, every move will be done according to a grand plan."

 NCH_infiltrators:0 "Infiltrator Companies"
 NCH_infiltrators_desc:0 "War is not fair, much as we may wish it were otherwise. As such, we must use every possible advantage that we have to build towards victory, even if it may put into question what it means to be a Greneclyfian."

 NCH_the_greneclyfian_jager:0 "The Greneclyfian Jager"
 NCH_the_greneclyfian_jager_desc:0 "Geamhraich are traditionally Greneclyfians who have taken to a quasi-isolated life in the hills in Aisling, where the winters and wildlife are harsh. Their ways and environments could prove useful to train specialised infantry dedicated to fight in inhospitable conditions."

 ### AIR BRANCH ###

 NCH_rethinking_aerial_warfare:0 "Rethinking Aerial Warfare"
 NCH_rethinking_aerial_warfare_desc:0 "By all accounts we've always had a sort of 'air force' in the sense of high flying drones that serve as battlefield disrupters. But in this modern age of warfare exist flying machines that can be equipped with fully automatic weapons—far larger than anything a single drone could carry, much less fly with. In order to have a properly modern military, we'll need to dive into this brand new field of military science."

 NCH_rock_mountain_base:0 "Bugsmere Air Base"
 NCH_rock_mountain_base_desc:0 "Much like the ancient city-hive of Bugsmere, the innards of the mountains will shelter our main air base. Conventional wisdom may say that the best location would be open terrain, but if war is to come to Greneclyf, a protected base of aerial operations will prove a challenging target for any enemy."

 NCH_aerial_experiments:0 "Aerial Experiments"
 NCH_aerial_experiments_desc:0 "We know ourselves best, so we are best positioned to make aircraft designed around ourselves. Native designs may perhaps not perform as well compared to foreign crafts, but will be simpler to produce en masse."

 NCH_search_for_foreign_designs:0 "Search for Foreign Designs"
 NCH_search_for_foreign_designs_desc:0 "None of our craftsworkers have ever even conceived of a flying craft, so whatever design they could come up with would never be on par with those of more modern nations. It is perhaps better to acquiesce to the costly designs for better perfoming aircraft."

 NCH_flight_schools:0 "Flight Schools"
 NCH_flight_schools_desc:0 "Aside from actually having aircraft to use, we'll need changelings suited to pilot them as well. Unlike regular army work, being a pilot requires a whole different set of talents such as good eyesight, quick reactions, and a strong stomach. By propping up schools dedicated purely to squeezing out the best pilots from our population, we'll know that our aircraft are in good hooves."

 NCH_foreign_pilots_desc:0 "We have the planes, but being of non-Greneclyfian design, no changeling is best qualified to teach our pilots how to fly them.

 NCH_sound_designs_desc:0 "Aircraft are still a young art of engineering, as such there is no reason to go crazy and dive into strange fields.

 NCH_radical_designs:0 "Radical Designs"
 NCH_radical_designs_desc:0 "We lack the industry to mass produce aircraft and the population to continually sustain a fleet of them. Our only choice is to fight brawn with brain and push our models to their very limit.

 ### NAVY BRANCH ###

 NCH_an_admiralty:0 "An Admiralty"
 NCH_an_admiralty_desc:0 "Being an island nation, Greneclyf will need to build up a maritime force. Before we can start however, we must have a structure with a dedicated naval corps of officers and theoriticians to get us started."

 NCH_support_admiral_petiole:0 "Support Admiral Fallon's Plan"
 NCH_support_admiral_petiole_desc:0 "Changelings have the innate talent for subterfuge, and while its use in greater society can be discussed at length, Fallon's plan for the seas applies that same philosophy to our vessels. Instead of the traditional surface ship, our main naval force should be underwater boats that can avoid detection and strike from below. Submarine warfare may be unorthodox, but it is both efficient and effective."

 NCH_go_all_in:0 "Accept Admiral Poethgils's Petition"
 NCH_go_all_in_desc:0 "Adapting our navy to modern warfare will not be enough, and Admiral Poethgils's petition goes into great technical detail on how Greneclyf can do better. He envisions the largest warship to have ever sailed the seas, based off of the great ships produced by Skyfall's naval yards, but larger, with more guns and armour. It will be a costly endeavour, but an unsinkable ship may very well be worth it."

 NCH_found_the_naval_academy:0 "Found the Naval Academy"
 NCH_found_the_naval_academy_desc:0 "Our initial drive for naval officers has produced some results, but it is clear that there must be an institution to ensure that Greneclyf will continue to produce great officers to serve their nations. Using the expertise of our current Admiralty, we can form an official naval academy for just that purpose."

 NCH_expand_the_naval_yards:0 "Expand the Naval Yards"
 NCH_expand_the_naval_yards_desc:0 "The current state of shipyards in Blosmport and other port settlements do not allow for the production of anything more than commercial vessels. If Greneclyf is to become a regional naval power, it must have the capacity to build its own new military vessels."

 NCH_proficient_packs:0 "The Icewaters Sharks"
 NCH_proficient_packs_desc:0 "The life of a submariner is stressful, especially when untrained and unprepared for wartime conditions. New plans put forward by Admiral Farris would designate parts of our territorial waters for use solely by the navy for war games and exercises. War may be the only true way to prepare our sailours for the hardships of war, but this is the next best alternative."

 NCH_lay_down_the_hatcher:0 "Lay Down the Hatcher"
 NCH_lay_down_the_hatcher_desc:0 "The designs have all been approved by naval engineers; the first Hatcher class is ready to be laid down in our shipyards. Soon, Greneclyf shall field the greatest and largest ship that the world will ever see!"

 NCH_torpedo_boats:0 "Torpedo Boats"
 NCH_torpedo_boats_desc:0 "Torpedoes have been used by Greneclyfian ships to protect themselves from pirates before cannons, and even powerful torpedoes don't require a large vessel to be effective. While large warships with great cannons have their place, smaller torpedo boats will prove just as deadly."

 NCH_the_mayfly_class:0 "The Mayfly Line"
 NCH_the_mayfly_class_desc:0 "A modern navy requires flexibility, and cruisers offer a great compromise between the heavy-hitting capacity of larger capital ships and the nimble speed of smaller destroyers. Whether light or armoured, our cruisers shall fill a number of roles that will prove invaluable in a future naval conflict."

 NCH_protected_cruisers:0 "The Borer Class"
 NCH_protected_cruisers_desc:0 "A hard look at Greneclyf's naval industry exposes an inconvenient truth: great battleships are both costly and take an exceedingly long amount of time to build. While we might never produce more than a few battleships, battlecruisers bring similair firepower for considerably cheaper. These shall be the mainstay ships of our nation."

 greneclyf_news.0.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The highly-anticipated coronation ceremony has finally come, and Queen Gytha, daughter of Queen Nóra Mhic, was officially ordained as the successor to the Greneclyfian throne.\n\nThe coronation comes three weeks since the sudden and unexpected passing of the former Queen. In many ways, it is a seal to approve Queen Gytha's position that she had taken upon herself immediately upon her mother's absence. Some worry that the Queen's inexperience may worsen current tensions in the country, but the initial reaction of the populace has been one of relief and of hope.\n\nFor now, a sense of normalcy has returned upon the island."
 greneclyf_news.0.a:0 "Long may she reign!"

 greneclyf_news.0.d1:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]After weeks of confusion in Greneclyf following the sudden death of Queen Nóra Mhic, the former Queen's daughter Gytha has subsequently been fully ordained as Greneclyf's newest Queen.\n\nChief Cenhelm sent a congratulatory message to the Queen with tacit support to continue the Great Pacts. Most believe it to be primarily a formality. Still, some believe that Cenhelm, having offered support to Gytha during the Greneclyfians' time of crisis, might intend to pursue a closening of ties between our two nations.\n\nIn the meantime, most Farbrookians are glad to see our neighbours have overcome this difficult period of national strife."
 greneclyf_news.0.b:0 "We wish Queen Gytha luck in her endeavours."

 greneclyf_news.0.d2:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The news of Queen Gytha's coronation broke the silence from the island of Greneclyf following the sudden cessation of regular communication. It turns out that the previous queen, Nóra Mhic, had passed after some turmoil in the country.\n\nQueen Gytha has sent a communiqué temporarily abstaining from the duty of Protector of the Hillpony Tribes that her predecessor had taken on. Meanwhile, Farbrook has sent its well-wishes to the changelings, suggesting that they are open to closening ties between Greneclyf and the Hillpony region.\n\nFor the most part, our citizens seem to be hopeful that a stable Greneclyf will keep the region safe."
 greneclyf_news.0.c:0 "Though Farbrook does not speak for us all, we wish Greneclyf well."
 greneclyf_news.0.e:0 "Between a strong Greneclyf and Arcturian Order, peace shall endure."

Subsequently, Queen Gytha, daughter of the previous queen, has ruled over the island and was only coronated recently.\n\nWe've also learnt that the Queendom's naval aspirations were dashed with the arrival of the new warships from Skyfall. The vessels in question proved to be costly and ultimately pointless, as they are utterly obsolete. Reports of a discontinued naval programme assuaged all concerns from members of our admiralty of a potential maritime rival."
 greneclyf_news.0.f:0 "Queen Nóra may have been playing with fire, but she didn't deserve such an end."

 greneclyf_news.0.d4:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]For some time, Greneclyf has been going through a state of national confusion with the death of Queen Nóra Mhic. Though her daughter, Queen Gytha, has taken charge almost immediately though has only now been anointed as the rightful ruler. The first message from the new Queen has been one for continued peace among our countries and a closening of ties between our peoples.\n\nThough the reaction from our citizens has been relatively muted, the few Greneclyfian changelings living within our borders have expressed relief over the resolution of the crisis in Greneclyf and hope for the future."

 ### STARTING CORONATION EVENTS ###
 greneclyf_start.0.t:0 "An Evening in Blosmport"
 greneclyf_start.0.d:0 "Things had since calmed down when Queen Nóra Mhic's corpse was recovered from Blosmport's newest canal. Though not all was truly well, at least Greneclyfians were not panicking over the existential threat of a leadership vacuum. There was a queen back on the throne, even if it was an uncrowned and young daughter. Despite all of her efforts to stabilise a nation in crisis, however, Gytha was still not seen as the 'true' Queen of Greneclyf. For nearly three weeks, the tradition was sidelined, but now the young queen could finally look forward to being coronated.\n\nUpon Gytha's desk was a mess of official reports and documents detailing the situation of the nation. Just a week prior, they told of a crisis; two weeks before, they seemed to herald an apocalypse, and Gytha barely knew what to do. Fortunately, she wasn't alone back then, and she wasn't now. A smile played on her lips as she looked upon Feilean, her older brother, mused thoughtfully over a document.\n\n"Sclerite and his CPM supporters have agreed to end their marches, despite his attack dog's calls for further action in Bugsmere and the capital." Feilean's eyes were heavy and yet alert all the same. They met Gytha's. "There's nothing else in the way, Gytha."\n\nGytha looked on hopefully. "Does that mean that we can finally proceed?" she asked tentatively.\n\n"It does," Feilean replied with a sharp nod. "The coronation can go ahead." He smiled softly as his sister slackened visibly in her seat. "There are still a few matters to go over, of course, but the remaining legwork now is straightforward."\n\nThe Queen sat up straighter, her breath hitching slightly at the thought of further delays. "What do I need to do?"\n\n"You?" Feilean asked with a raised eyebrow. When Gytha nodded, he chuckled. "Besides practising and making the official invitations, you may rest, Gytha dearest."\n\nGytha blinked. Was that it?"
 greneclyf_start.0.a:0 ""Perhaps I could do with some sleep...""

 greneclyf_start.1.t:0 "The Crowning of the New Queen"
 greneclyf_start.1.d:0 "It was grandiose: the chamber glittered with lights; royals and respected drones from all walks of life observed in quiet respect; the throne, spotless and immaculate, awaited its new occupant. Awaiting her was the throne and two old, withered-looking drones standing in between. The one on the left held the jewelled crown and the other a ceremonial urn. Much like Gytha, they wore simple, almost ragged white garbs. Theirs were somewhat more pristine than hers, but that was as it should be, for she would become, as tradition dictated, the newest representative of the Sunderer. As the praise singers ended their song, Gytha stopped short and knelt well below the two drones, eyes cast downwards.\n\nThe one on the right spoke first in a voice aged by decades. "Is Your Majesty willing to take the Oath?"\n\n"I am willing," Gytha responded solemnly.\n\n"Will you maintain and preserve unwaveringly?"\n\nGytha closed her eyes in respect and in anticipation. "I shall," she responded. Wordlessly, she felt a gentle hoof softly running along her horn as a coat of ash trailed behind the drone's touch.\n\n"Be your horn, anointed, with the Sunderer's form," enunciated the elderly drone as she finished her ritual. "As queens past were, so shall you, blessed and consecrated, be Queen over the peoples, in the name of Slána the Sunderer."\n\nPlaced upon Gytha's head was a silver circlet crown, and she finally rose to see both drones standing aside for her to take the throne. Gytha did her best not to think about what had happened to its previous occupant. Slowly, gingerly, she took her seat and beheld the chamber with as much authority as she could muster. Gytha recognised some faces from the crowd: her smiling brother, a neutral Queen Oiren, even Queen Cait Murchbagh and Dragon Snowy in their resplendent uniforms.\n\nAfter a pause and a short breath, the Queen of Greneclyf tilted her head upwards and spoke loud enough to create an echo:"
 greneclyf_start.1.a:0 ""Praise be to Greneclyf and to thee!""

 greneclyf_start.2.t:0 "Seeing to the CPM"
 greneclyf_start.2.d:0 "The coronation ceremony had barely finished when Queen Gytha and Feilean were once more in her office. The first order of business was a letter from the CPM, though that was to be expected.\n\n"What does it say?" Gytha asked her brother, though she suspected she already knew its contents.\n\n"They would like to know the Crown's plans now that we have an ordained queen back on the throne." Feilean's green eyes looked up from the letter. "There's particular emphasis on when these plans are meant to take effect."\n\nGytha nodded once. As her gaze wandered, she recalled the demands Sclerite and his party had demanded upon the Queen when her mother's corpse was still dripping wet.\n\nBanishing that morbid thought, she looked to Feilean. "Have you thought over what we've discussed before?"\n\n"I have," Feilean replied, offering her a smile, "and though there are some details to iron out, it's easily the best way forward, Gytha."\n\nGytha let out a slow breath. "Pass me a pen.""
 greneclyf_start.2.a:0 ""You may also want some coffee, Gytha. We'll be here for a while.""

 greneclyf_start.3.t:0 "The Letter from the Queen"
 greneclyf_start.3.d:0 "A hoof ran down Fennore's face. "For my sake, Cader," she said, speaking with an irritated grumble. "Go over what she wrote once more, and in simpler terms."\n\nStanding above Fennore and Eolan, Cader grimaced in irritation before setting aside the letter in his magical grip. "The Queen wants to confer with the River Coalition nations to secure new treaties to protect Greneclyfian nationals and gain new financial ties."\n\n"How? By askin' them nicely?" Fennore blurted out, standing up from her seat. Before Cader could respond, she continued: "That'd be a sight! Our dope of a queen crawlin' to the dogs, or—" she laughed harshly "—or perhaps the Bakarans, askin' 'pretty please?' Does she really think it's as simple as that?" She looked to her companions for an answer. Eolan sat quietly, his expression betraying nothing but exhaustion. Cader's grimace, meanwhile, deepened.\n\n"I don't know how she'll do it," he admitted, "but she may know something we don't. She might well be able."\n\nFennore barked out a hollow laugh. "And pray tell, did she say when she thinks she'd achieve all o' this?"\n\n"The Queen believes that this can be done by the year, and—"\n\n"To Tartarus with that!" she stomped a hoof. "This won't work!"\n\nA tense silence followed as both Cader and Fennore stared each other down.\n\n"It just might," came the weathered voice of Eolan. As his two colleagues turned to him, he added, "Queen Nóra Mhic never tried to speak to the Coltstream properly, and they have been experiencing a period of economic growth." His eyes gleamed brightly behind his glasses. "It could work.""
 greneclyf_start.3.a:0 "Fennore stared back increduluously."

 greneclyf_start.4.t:0 "The Letter from the Queen"
 greneclyf_start.4.d:0 ""Are you bleedin' insane?" Fennore approached Eolan, raising her voice. "You can't trust the continentals to treat us right, let alone give us the time o' day to help us out!"\n\nThe elderly drone merely narrowed his eyes. "I didn't say that it'd be easy,  Ó Cuanáin," he said, his tone calm yet terse. "I am simply saying that should the Queen achieve it, it would dig the country out of its spiral."\n\n"In a year?" Fennore pointedly asked. "Most Greneclyfians can't afford to wait a year! We've made a promise to our people, and we must keep the Crown accountable!" She turned to face Cader. "She won't be able to do it."\n\nSclerite, for his part, only approached Fennore and placed a placating hoof on her shoulder. Her breathing quieted, and their eyes met. After a long moment, Cader spoke.\n\n"I understand, Fennie. I genuinely do. I haven't forgotten what you've suffered through in Bakara." Fennore's lips thinned at Cader's words as he continued. "The Queen's barely taken her mother's place. She's far more sincere in her attempts, even if she's inexperienced. We need to give her a chance. If she doesn't hold to her word..."\n\nHe shrugged, offering a small smile. "We'll manage it. I'm willing to give Queen Gytha a shot." Fennore tilted his head to Eolan. "So is Eolan. Will you give her a chance?"\n\nFennore fell silent, as she mulled it over. She scowled and furrowed her eyes as she gave a single, firm nod."
 greneclyf_start.4.a:0 ""Alright, I will. But only because I trust you, Cader.""

As such, there is much to worry about: logistics, routes, ships, and volunteers.

 greneclyf_trade.4.d:0 "A ship from Greneclyf has arrived at Farbrook, filled to the brim with changelings. This in it of itself was strange, as traffic from the isle is usually no more than a few fishing vessels, but the fact that many political and governmental representatives were onboard was telling. Port authorities were immediately approached by these Greneclyfians, requesting an immediate audience with [Root.GetLeader].\n\nThe head delegate, speaking in Queen Gytha's name, has informed us of a shift in Greneclyf's policy regarding the treatment of its citizens over on the continent. Most of their concerns aren't directed to Farbrook itself, however they are asking for a concentrated effort on our path to ensure equal treatment of changelings under the guise of a trade deal, in the hopes to set a friendly tone abroad in the River Coalition.\n\nThough some of the long-term objectives are somewhat ambitious, the short-term goal to enrichen our currently stale trade is a very realistic one, and Farbrookians already consider their Greneclyfian neighbours as equals.\n\nThe Greneclyfian diplomat stands before you, waiting for your response."

In addition, they wish to for the Greneclyfians already residing within our lands to be protected from discrimination.\n\nOn the one hoof, they're changelings who shouldn't be trusted, as per the old mares' tales, especially due to their naval build-up from years prior. On the other hoof, we have had any incidents with those currently residing in Bakara, and their navy is obsolete and no real threat to ours.\n\nWe could garner some good trade from Greneclyf while promising their citizens the same protections as of those given to our own."

 greneclyf_trade.16.d:0 "Coming in through the riverways, a group of strange, bug-like ponies called changelings from beyond the coast have arrived to formalise new trading relations between our two people. This would involve an exchange of merchants and goods.\n\nWe have of course heard about their kind before, and while these particular changelings come bearing gifts, might perhaps be all a ruse. Maybe they've managed to fool the other member states that they were friendly, or perhaps these Greneclyfians truly wish to just be friends.\n\nHow should we respond?"

They came with the request for open trade in regard to our gems and other rare mineral stores in exchange for exotic fish, some iron and steel products, along with their own brand of textiles work.

No reports of trouble or other misdeeds either after their arrival...perhaps they're genuine enough. \n\nRegardless the bugs have come with the desire to open up trade routes between Wittenburg and "Greneclyf", their island home. Aside from generic products such as iron, steel, and textiles...the bugs, these 'changelings' have made the interesting offer to exchange magical knowledge. Apparently the lore of changelings is vastly unknown as...we have no records on it. Perhaps this is a gold mine that has fallen right onto our lap? Then again...we know for sure the true nature of these creatures is naturally malicious. This could easily be nothing more than a show they're putting up to infiltrate our ranks..."

Normally they never leave their island home, but news came from the arrival that a push was being made to open up relations with the outside world beyond just Farbrook. This new approach goes hoof in hoof with the apparent Greneclyfian desire to follow the aspects of Harmony. To start with, they merely want to begin exchanging textiles in the form of trade."

 greneclyf_trade_crisis.3.d_BAK:0 "A merchant in Bakara was apprehended by local authorities under suspicion of having killed a local pony in the port town of Iceband. Reports are mixed, but what is certain is that a Bakaran is dead, and our citizen was found using their form as a disguise.\n\nWhile witnesses (of which none were present at the moment of the alleged crime) claim that the changeling had purposefully murdered a pony to assume their form and begin a murder spree, the accused said that they had acted in self defense, and that they had taken over their form in a panic upon realising that the aggressor was dead.\n\nIn either case, there is considerable revanchism on the side of Bakara calling for the head of our merchant. Where do we officially stand on this matter?"
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.3.d_DMT:0 "Grave news from Dit-Kazaar on the continent: a Greneclyfian citizen is currently incarcerated awaiting trial for murder.\n\nWhat exactly has happened is unclear, but the local authorities claim that the suspect was found loitering near a murder scene. When prodded for further evidence implicating him, we were given a prompt reply of 'he looks like he did it.'\n\nNeedless to say, our citizen insists that he happened to have been wandering nearby when the police had discovered the body of the victim, though so far his pleads of innocence have fallen upon deaf ears. None of the local residents have spoken up in his defense, and most are convinced of his guilt despite the lack of hard evidence. Our people are aghast at the blatant display of injustice, so they look to us for a response."
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.3.d_NIM:0 "From the nation of pegasi, Nimbusia, comes saddening news. One of our own was jailed and is awaiting trial for murder. The incident has caused a stir amongst the ponies, who were already going against their usual xenophobia by letting Greneclyfan merchants trade in their country. Now even most of the pro-harmony reformists have lost confidence in our species.\n\nBoth the changeling and the victim were allegedly travelling towards some sort of sacred city for the Nimbusians by the name of Prancetras. Friends of our subject say that he got curious after hearing stories of an oracle who lives there, however, shortly before the changeling reached the city, he encountered the victim, a pegasus citizen. Whatever transpired there ended with a dead pegasus and our subject assuming the identity of the pony he just killed. Of course he was found out soon afterwards and was arrested by the Nimbusian authorities.\n\nThe changeling has sworn that it was in fact the pegasus who attacked him, but testimonies by the victim's family and friends say the victim was an honourable citizen and a veteran too, making the Nimbusians skeptical towards his testimony. This case is turning into a nightmare for Nimbusian-Greneclyfian relations. Do we believe our citizen's story or do we back the Nimbusian authorities to save face?"
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.3.d_FRE:0 "In Pònaidhean, one of the more quiet nations in the Riverlands, one of our subjects seems to have made a grave error. While travelling through the Pònaidhean hinterlands, one of our merchants got caught unawares by heavy rainfall. Luckily for him, he could take shelter in a cave, ignoring the strange stone slab with inscriptions on it that stood before the cave's entrance. Through the storm, two monks also traversed the same path as the changeling. When the monks walked past the cave, they saw the changeling's glowing eyes staring at them. A few seconds later, our citizen was overwhelmed and dragged out of the cave and the monks were shouting at him in an unknown language.\n\nIt turns out our subject ventured into a cave where an evil 'demon' was supposedly sealed away. Entering this cave is a grievous offence and extremely suspicious to the pious Pònaidheans. The Taoiseach of Pònaidhean has asked us for our opinion, stating that she is willing to believe this was a misunderstanding, but that letting the changeling go now may mean that the clans in her country vote for restrictions on trade with Greneclyf in the future..."
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.3.a:0 "Plead for our citizen! They've done nothing wrong."
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.3.b:0 "Say nothing. We should let them deal with it."

 greneclyf_trade_crisis.5.d:0 "The trial of one of our own has been noticed throughout the Riverlands. More and more reports are coming in of incidents of flat-out racism against our kind, and more Riverland companies refused cooperation with Greneclyf for reasons we suspect to be because of our race. Our citizens are looking to us for instructions. Some even openly ask if they should give up on friendship with the Riverlands entirely.\n\nFour options are available to us and careful consideration must be made for the safety of our people and our relations with the continentals. We could tell our people to be on guard, although this may make Greneclyfians seem suspicious. We could ask them to be friendlier and patient with those giving them a hard time, to show them our good side. We could also advise our people to consider returning home if they feel threatened, but this may be seen as giving up. Lastly, we could refuse to change course at all."

 greneclyf_trade_crisis.6.t:0 "Greneclyfian Goods Boycotted"
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.6.d:0 "Previously, some of our merchants in the continent had claimed that the Riverlanders were deliberately avoiding to do business with them due to suspected racism. It was a side effect back then, but now people are actively refusing to purchase in our stores abroad. Many of our people have also been refused service in local shops, lending further credence that this is a concentrated effort.\n\nAs a result, our people are reporting losses that will eventually push them out of the markets on the continent if they are not addressed. Many of our merchants have called for retaliatory boycotts back at home, even though by all accounts foreign traders have been keeping perfectly fair and legal activities in Greneclyf. Some have suggested to show good will on our part by subsidising our people's purchases of local goods in the continent, whereas others advise to simply help our traders there to recoup their losses.\n\nWhat should we tell our people?"
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.6.a:0 "Help our people purchase the goods of the locals."
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.6.b:0 "Cover the losses that our merchants are suffering."

 greneclyf_trade_crisis.7.t:0 "Riverlands Trial of Greneclyfian Fuels Paranoia"
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.7.d_BAK:0 "After many days behind closed doors, an utterly confused Greneclyfian was freely released by the authorities.\n\nIt is impossible to say why or how he was cleared of his accusations, as he was never a part of the proceedings between the Bakaran monks who deliberated the matter.\n\nWhilst our citizen was glad to be set free, many Bakarans were not. As he was being judged, orators in major cities repeated the story of the alleged crime, embellishing and adding further heinous acts with each retelling. By the time he was released, none of the Bakarans could believe that the monster that they had continously heard about was set free, and was chased away from the scene.\n\nNeedless to say, we have already sent our official protests to the Bakaran government, though our representatives there expect little sympathy from it."
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.7.d_DMT:0 "A furious representative from Diamond Mountain stormed into the home of our on-site diplomat, soldiers in tow, demanding the whereabouts of the accused from last month. Apparently, the defendant fled from his confinement and has not been seen since the previous night.\n\nOur diplomat of course refuted any part in the defendant's escape and offered a stern condemnation of their actions, but in private has expressed relief over the matter. The few times that the accused had been seen by his fellow Greneclyfians, it was in a dungeon under horrendous conditions. What little food was given was woefully inadequate, and the last time a close friend saw him, the jailed changeling was severely emanciated. It is little wonder that he has escaped his confinement in light of the circumstances.\n\nDespite our official condemnation of the defendant's escape, many diamond dogs were left convinced that there was no way that he had managed to do so unaided, and are now eyeing other Greneclyfians with suspicion."
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.7.d_NIM:0 "The reformist party had collected some money to buy a decent attorney for the changeling on trial in Nimbusia. The trials in the country were quite populist affairs, however, and our subject was already disadvantaged by being both a foreigner and a changeling. Still, the pegasus attorney delivered a flaming speech arguing that there was absolutely no evidence for the murder, pointing out that his client was unarmed and a weapon was found on the body of the dead pegasus. The lawyer of the victim countered by a gross depiction of stereotypes. The attorney played the crowd and fed their fears of the unknown. Despite no evidence that the changeling was actually guilty, the jury of citizens deemed the evidence substantive enough, referring to our subject as the "insectoid monster."\n\nThe trial continued to the second phase, where both the accused and the accuser got to propose a punishment. The defense attorney, under pressure and cornered by the mood of the crowd, decided to push for banishment, while the attacker pleaded for the death penalty. Thanks to the excellent oration of our lawyer, our citizen narrowly escaped death, with the attorney convincing just enough ponies to let the changeling leave, without his possessions, of course. Although our subject escaped Nimbusia with his life, opinions towards changelings in Nimbusia have soured even more."
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.7.d_FRE:0 "In Dail Mhòr, the court proceedings took place against the changeling accused for trespassing and summoning a demon. With the law system separated by Pònaidhean tribe, the Taoiseach had no choice but to make the changeling a temporary honourary member of her own clan. With that, the framework of laws was set.\n\nOur subject was helpless against the clan elders and the monks who acted as witnesses. Most of the court proceedings happened in a language our citizen couldn't even understand and nopony offered him legal counsel. The crimes of the changeling were extremely exaggerated by the elders in the end, as they seemed to truly believe that if the monks hadn't stopped him, the accused would have unleashed a terrible spirit. So, they gave the changeling a sentence of being taken in at a monastery for three years or until he came to repent his demonic past, whichever came later. Without any proper way of defending himself, our subject was dragged off to some forgotten mountaintop, forced into the Pònaidheans' weird religious institutions."

All member races of the Riverlands, both dog and pony, have begun treating them as if they were monsters: cruel, uncaring and ravenous. These rumours are scaring the population all across the Coalition, and relations with the changelings are, as of result, rapidly deteriorating. There are already scattered reports of hate crime related atrocities being committed against Greneclyfians, although these are, thankfully, relatively few and far between as of yet.\n\nThere has been no official response from the island nation as of yet, but it will almost certainly be unfavourable."

 greneclyf_trade_crisis.8.d:0 "While overall disdain held towards our people has dissipated, there are groups of continentals in certain parts of the Riverlands that actively seek out our people to harrass. These roving bands of thugs have prompted some of our citizens to ignore our previous instructions and actively engage them with their own ad-hoc groups. Fortunately these confrontations haven't caused any deaths, but there has been at least one critical injury so far.\n\nOur representatives have been drowning in protests from the respective governments regarding the behaviour of our changelings, promising dire consequences if the matter isn't addressed promptly and in a satisfactory manner. Our diplomats are looking to us for a formal response."

They've endured for many weeks, but there has been no end in sight to the prejudice suffered at the hooves of our people. Ships laden with changelings have returned to Greneclyf seeking respite from the terrible treatment abroad. Unfortunately, these same changelings took out their anger at the continentals who willingly came here.\n\nThe recently inaugurated merchant district in Blosmport was mobbed by the returning merchants and adventurers, actively attacking ponies who were only guilty by association. There were no reported deaths from the clashes, but many were injured, some severely, and the entire district was utterly devastated by ransacking and looting.\n\nOnce the news returned on the continent, we were issued an ultimatum by the entire Coalition: leave their lands and never return.\n\nWith no other choice, we had to acquiesce to their demands and end our official relations with a sour note. People in Greneclyf are now seriously questioning the entire endeavour that [Root.GetLeader] had launched into the continent, as well what must be done in order to move forward in the world.\n\nAre we truly without merit in the eyes of the foreigners?"

Many of the violent locals have either been arrested by the authorities or have been shamed into submission by the majority of Riverlanders. It appears that we have finally defeated the caricature that had been placed upon us, and have earned if not amiable admiration, at least a grudging respect of our level-headed approach to the troubles that our people have had.\n\nMany natives have admitted shame of their past actions and have asked for forgiveness for their folly and blind fear that they once held. As expected, almost every Greneclyfian has wholeheartedly accepted their apologies and have, in true Greneclyfian spirit, extended a hoof of friendship to those who had wronged them before. While most of our communities are still fairly separated from those of local residents, there are some that are integrating very quickly and very well.\n\nBusiness has returned to normal, and there is nary a sign of trouble ahead for our people.

### POLITICAL EVENTS ###
 greneclyf.29.t:0 "A Loss of Faith"
 greneclyf.29.d:0 "The reports have been both incessant and disheartening. Many of our trading deals are failing, either by staunch refusal to our offers or by cessation of those accepted by the other parties. These have severely demoralised our people, but none more so than Queen Gytha. Upon hearing word of the latest failure, she lost herself in open despair, affecting a few too close to her. After much struggle, the Queen managed to sober up enough to close herself off in her personal chamber.\n\nShut off from everyone, the Queen has left no one on the seat of power, and no one is sure as to what can be done. As of right now, there is no one to look towards for a sense of stability, and panic is gripping the nation."
 greneclyf.29.a:0 "Sunderer protect us!"

 greneclyf.30.t:0 "The Council of Royals Deliberates"
 greneclyf.30.d:0 "All of the significant members of the Council have convened in Blosmport for the emergency call sent by those closest to the Queen. After several days of intense dialogue and discussion, an urgent matter has to be resolved today, namely what must be done with the Queen.\n\nFor past week Queen Gytha has been absent from nearly all affairs of statehood, after having locked herself in her private chambers, and is refusing to see anyone; not even her closest friends and advisors can reach to the Queen. With no one at the throne, Greneclyf risks collapse if it continues to remain empty. The Queen's House does not have a suitable replacement, and thus the Council's is considering to invoke a vote. Of the many candidates, Princess Oiren of House Aurelia is the prominent and plausible alternative.\n\nBeing the eldest Royal out of all of the suitable candidates —second only to the Queen— Oiren is a far more reserved Royal compared to Gytha, and has championed a more isolationist policy. This would fly in the face of a tradition that has been followed for centuries, and there are a few in the Council openly questioning Oiren's motives. She has insisted that her priorities are for Greneclyf first and foremost, and that her actions are not motivated by her House's ancient rivalry with House Lepidoptera, the Queen's House. Were the Council to invoke the vote, Oiren is certain to win, as all of the other viable candidates pale in comparison to her experience and popularity.\n\nSome of the Council are still hoping for Queen Gytha to recover from whatever is afflicting her, and that she will soon return to bring back at least some semblance of order. House Lepidotpera has ruled continually for centuries, and both its regents and their philosophies have brought us peace and stability. Perhaps the best course for Greneclyf is to wait for the Queen to come back to us."
 greneclyf.30.a:0 "Queen Gytha isn't wholly lost. We trust in a speedy recovery."
 greneclyf.30.b:0 "Gytha is incapable of leading anymore. Let us hold the vote!"

 greneclyf.31.t:0 "The Queen Recovers" 
 greneclyf.31.d:0 "Fortunately for everyone, Queen Gytha has emerged once more from her private quarters and seems to be shockingly rejuvenated altogether after her initial panic attack some time ago. Many feared that she might have become suicidal in her battle against depression, especially after she had begun to refuse to eat.\n\n Such worries can now be safely dismissed, though there are still concerns of her convictions. Most will still follow the Queen, though the certainty from just a few months ago has been replaced by an air of trepidation and anxiousness." 
 greneclyf.31.a:0 "Where will Gytha take Greneclyf now?"

 greneclyf.68.t:0 "Princess Oiren Crowned Queen"
 greneclyf.68.d:0 "A vote has been called, and after an hour of deliberation, the Council has declared Oiren of House Aurelia Queen of Greneclyf.\n\nThe result was a foregone conclusion, as none of the other candidates were anywhere near as qualified or popular as Princess Oiren, and the vote was merely a formality. Despite the almost trivial proceedings, this is still a profound moment in the history of Greneclyf. After over 800 years of uninterrupted rule, a member of the House of Lepidoptera has been voted out for someone from a different Royal House."

Only the ebbing vestiges of the words of Gytha's brother still echoed through the chamber. Even the dropped title did not rouse the changeling as her eyes saw something that did not exist.\n\nFeilean approached the Queen. "Please," he repeated with a more emphatic tone. He almost sounded desperate.\n\nGytha's gaze grew focused but remained cast downwards. After a pregnant pause, she said, "Leave us."\n\nHer voice was neutral, but it left Feilean uneasy. The herald bowed her head and left. He probably should have joined the drone, yet he could not do so—not yet. His little sister needed someling to offer comfort.\n\n"We– we could try something different," Feilean said. "We still have time to course-correct."\n\nHe suddenly felt a snout nuzzling upon his neck frill. Gytha had embraced him without warning. "Thank you, big brother." Her voice was barely louder than a whisper. "I love you so much for all that you have done."\n\nFeilean hesitated at first but soon returned the embrace. After a long moment of warm comfort, she added, "Please. I need some time alone."\n\nAgain he hesitated to break the contact, though he obediently did so. He made for the door, shooting back a glance. "I will always be here for you, Gytha." A faint smile with watery eyes met his promise.\n\nGytha's stare lingered upon the door before it eventually drifted upwards towards the chandelier of the chamber. She gauged it for a long while; it would probably do."

 #greneclyf.111.t:0 "Teach Moladha"
 #greneclyf.111.d:0 "When I heard about the House of Praise opening, I was sceptical. The Deoirethe that built it and others in the wake of their return never sat right with me. They claim that they were a local tradition in Aisling. They're small, rustic buildings, but there was a quality to them that called to me and many other sceptics. Their first Poet Call saw the pews stuffed with the curious and critics, with many filling the empty spaces in between.\n\nThe Praise Poet, a small, frail-looking drone in a beige robe, greeted us all with an open heart and spoke at length, retelling the tale of the Sunderer. It was nothing that we hadn't heard of before, but there was a noticeable tone of devotion in her voice that wasn't present in most retellings.\n\nI could already sense some guilt from some of the other spectators. They evidently hadn't given much thought about just how much changelings owed their existence to the Sunderer, but I, and I suspect most others, still were unmoved by the flowery prose.\n\nThen the Praise Singers sang\n\nThere was no instrumental accompaniment. It was a short poetical hymn that was about as eloquent as the Poet's earlier oration and, when put into writing, wasn't particularly eye-catching.\n\nBut the symphony... it touched my soul. The utter purity of the voices showed a harmonious quality that I had never believed that we shared. This is a part of our identity, and we had chased it away a century back. How could we have done so?\n\nWhen the choral finished, the entire audience was openly crying. My heart, both burdened with remorse but brought to peace by the song, had moved me to sob.  To this, the Praise Poet spoke:\n\n"Take these words ye faithful ones. Out of the dust were we born, and to the dust, we will return. Ye do not yet know the toil that They have made to bring you here, born on this lonely paradise. So They favoured your ancestors to grow in both Body and Mind, making them aware of themselves. Ye have just awoke; now ye must build and craft community as the creator has formed ye."\n\nI have, and I vow that we shall never again cut away a piece of ourselves. For the Sunderer."

While the Council debates what to do, something dark has been taking root in Gytha's mind...\n\nHarmony was supposed to be the path, as it had been for centuries, but it has led us astray. The world refuses to help Greneclyf solely because of their primal fear of changelings. How can a changeling befriend someone who fears them? How can a changeling love someone who hates them? How can Gytha trust Cenhelm if he refuses to help her?\n\nWell, something from deep within the Queen has taken over, and it is ancient.\n\nA new hunger permeates the air wherever Gytha is present, and while she appears to have recovered from her break, there is something hidden behind her fanged smiles and glowing eyes. This is a changeling Royal reborn, and one who has a sole purpose now: protect and feed her Hive, no matter the cost.\n\nDark clouds are gathering on the isle, and they threaten to billow forth unto the continent."

At first, those closest to Gytha told of her adamantly frustrated by their ideological differences. Something has changed recently, however; the Greneclyfian Royal is no longer as approachable as she had been, and many wonder what could have brought about this change.\n\nRegardless, this shift has coincided with a breakthrough in the Royals' private negotiations. Greneclyf will serve as a faithful ally to our kin from across the sea, bound by the blood of our kind. Some still wonder if this new Queen Gytha will be prepared for this challenge, however..."

Long hours passed after that first confrontation, leaving many waiting with bated breath for the outcome. Surprisingly enough, a seemingly humbled Chrysalis accompanied Gytha to be shown the errors of her ways.\n\n"No more lying, no more scheming," said the Queen. "Chrysalis's goals are united with Our own."\n\nSo with the two Royals finally in agreement, Greneclyf appears prepared to finally tackle the question of how to proceed in light of the great nations refusing our offers of peace and love. One thing is for certain though: Chrysalis shall work with Gytha as a close advisor."

 ### IDEAS ###
 NCH_FBK_pact:0 "The Great Pacts"
 NCH_FBK_pact_desc:0 "The ancient Farbrookian-Greneclyf friendship is symbolised by two pairs of tapestries, each weaved by Farbrook and Greneclyf. One represents the First Sharing from around 800 years ago, whereas the other depicts the Frozen Refuge, both events that are very significant for both Greneclyfians and Farbrookians.\n\nCollectively known as the Great Pacts, this hoofscraft stands as a testament of the historic friendship and collaborative nature between the two peoples, trascending biological barriers and proving that Harmony is truly universal."

 NCH_idyllic_society:0 "Pacifist Tendencies"
 NCH_idyllic_society_desc:0 "Despite our biological capacity for it, Greneclyfians abhor abusing their innate talents of subterfuge for military use and espionage. As such, any research into these areas will be slow.\n\nIn addition, a general lack of interest in all matters military leads to few Greneclyfians enrolling as either officers or as soldiers."
 
 NCH_blindfold_starting:0 "The Legacy of Dairile"
 NCH_blindfold_starting_desc:0 "The memoirs of the expatriate Dairile have reached a broader audience in Greneclyf since it was published some sixty years ago. Further incidents from other Greneclyfians abroad displaying similarities to those experienced by the writer have roused a movement among the changelings protesting their treatment in the continent. The blindfold, symbolising the perceived desire of non-changelings not to speak with Greneclyfians, has become synonymous with the stewing resentment among the populace.\n\nThe growing radicalisation of the movement has shaken the people's faith in the Leahman approach of governance and foreign policy, and we've seen political support waning. We know that the CPM is behind this, and we can expect this to continue if their call for a governmental response to Dairile's question that she posed fifty years ago is ignored. It'd best be a response that Greneclyfians and the CPM will accept, lest we risk further aggravating the perceived slights against us...\n\nThe CPM's supporters are currently §Rprotesting.§!"

 NCH_obsolete_navy:0 "Obsolete Navy Ships"
 NCH_obsolete_navy_desc:0 "What ships we've obtained from our 'deal' with the Skyfall Federation are archaic in every sense of the word. They are old, slow, and extremely limited due to their outdated coal-based turbine engines. Though these are not oil-dependent, the ships are otherwise poorly armed and armoured, making for, frankly, terrible warships.\n\nUntil we either retrofit these ships or otherwise get rid of them, our fleet will remain as a painful reminder of Queen Nóra's gullibility and blindness."
 
 NCH_inadequate_shipyards:0 "Inadequate Shipwrights"
 NCH_inadequate_shipyards_desc:0 "Unfortunately for us, naval investments made by Queen Nóra Mhic were mainly directed towards acquiring foreign-built ships, as it was deemed too costly to set up the necessary foundation for a massive shipbuilding industry. The expansions that have been made were primarily civilian and thus unsuitable to the production and fitting of large war vessels."

 NCH_cara:0 "Cara Ní hAodha"
 NCH_cara_desc:0 "The leader of the Greneclyfian Cartographer Society, Cara Ní hAodha's talents in subterfuge and deception are surprising qualities in a Greneclyfian, more so for someone as calm and placid as she. Her position as the head of the GCS does place her in an advantageous position in the nation, having a network of informants and contacts abroad that can operate on the continent. Cara's motives are as nebulous as her origins, but she has said that the death of Queen Nóra Mhic left Greneclyf vulnerable, and she intends to keep the country safe.\n\nHer skills and connections are contrary to the pacifist and honest methods of the Leahman Clann, but they might be crucial for the well-being of the country. It's evident that behind Cara's soft voice and calm demeanour is a calculating mind who will do anything to defend her country. What else might she be hiding behind her kind eyes though?"

 NCH_scout_plane_equipment_1_desc:0 "The ES05 (or the 'Ulchabhán') was a militarized civilian biplane that initially performed as a fighter in the Greneclyfian military. It was retired from the role of air superiority fighter because of its poor performance compared to other future biplanes introduced later. The ES05's lacklustre speed and agility made for an incredibly efficient and surprisingly quiet vehicle, which made it an ideal scout plane."

However, those speeds came at the cost of agility and low autonomy, so it was not suited for active combat roles when proposed to the Greneclyfian Airforce. A modified design with a less powerful engine slashed its projected speed. As a result, however, its range was massively improved and easily outranged dedicated fighters, including some interceptors."

The 'Seabhac', as it became known, would see a long service life even though newer models, such as the ET07 and ET08, outperformed the Seabhac. Its believed its long service was mostly due to pilot preference over the newer models, though there are conflicting reports that indicate production difficulties with the newer models being the main reason for the ET06's extended service life."

Being an acrobatic performance biplane, the ET07 came with an unusually powerful engine that made for a smaller frame; this would make it the subject of experiments with carrier-aircraft. However, between a temperamental engine and a lightweight fuselage, the ET07 reported more crash landings than most other contemporary biplanes, leaving the model with few qualified pilots willing to fly it."

The first was Oifig na Eitlíocht, who produced the first dedicated Greneclyfian fighter plane: the 'Cróman'. With a more robust fuselage and engine than its predecessor, the ET08 was another model intended to replace the somewhat antiquated ET06. In achieving this performance however, the ET08 was deemed difficult to fly according to many pilots, leaving it with few pilots qualified to fly it."

Afterwards, when the Greneclyfian Navy performed carrier experiments, the FaM08 was selected as a fighter candidate, though the OnE model was deemed unsuitable for a carrier-based role. It would take a redesign from CAdA to make it an adequate carrier fighter, though by then the carrier experiments had concluded and the Navy was not interested until years later."

Inspired by the Republika L-7 that was in service in the River Coalition, the ET10 would come to surpass its continental counterpart. However, it would not see nearly as many numbers as the L-7 or later L-11 due to a problematic production phase. Universally appraised by pilots for its ease of use, the ET10 would serve with the Greneclyfian Airforce for many years."

It mostly used the ET10 and improved on it, and was projected to be comparable in performance with the ET10. During its maiden voyage, the Piongain, unfortunately, suffered an unexpected stall from which the pilot could not recover. Unimpressed by the loss of the plane, the Navy looked elsewhere for a carrier-based fighter."

Supposedly meant to be an alternate proposal to the ET10, the ET13's projected characteristics worried the creator of the ET10 (a certain Alistriona) so much that she used her clout within OnE to suppress her rival's design so that her ET10 would win the contract. When schematics of the ET13 were found, OnE immediately presented the ET13 to the military in order to make amends. It was quickly accepted when it was evident that the ET13 outclassed its predecessor."

Most of the ET13's flight characteristics carried over to the FaM14, though pilots deemed it sluggish compared to the ET13, it impressed navy officers who observed its maiden flight. However, the FaM14 would never see service as the carrier trials never occurred and shifting budgetary policies killed new aircraft projects and contracts."

The IT-1 would never be able to race with the ISR-4 on a paved track, but it proved to be a quicker carrier than the ISR-4 off-road. Nicknamed the 'tortoise' by troops, it was still praised for its reliability."

This technically didn't meet the army's request for an infantry tank, but observers were particularly impressed by the C.2's speed and reliable gun. It would be adopted as the 'combat tank', a role that would work alongside the smaller flanker tanks as the primary anti-tank vehicle in an armoured assault."

 NCH_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "BnG's C.6 was more of a testbed like the Fráma Armúrtha than an actual tank. This was most evident by the incredibly cramped turret and the same gun used in the C.2. However, its new leaf bogie suspension system and redesigned engine deck gave the C.6 a far lower profile, just as low as that of the C.4. Though it was clear that there were issues in the hull's layout that required ironing out, the army commended the new direction in design philosophy for future combat tanks."

Its turret was spacious and comfortable enough for three crewmembers, and the improved roadwheel layout made this a responsive and efficient vehicle. Regardless of its vulnerability to AT fire, 'the Challenger', as it would become known, was a formidable foe to most enemies it faced."

By reworking the driveshaft and removing the turret for an open-topped gunshield mounting, the chassis allowed for large-calibre cannons. The anti-tank variant was designated as the 'Lansaí'.

Trading overall killing power for compact weapons meant that the Saillteoir had considerable staying power, and it outlasted its competitors in endurance trials.

This was to be the beginning of Stalliongradian designs being adapted for use by changeling crews, making them notably distinct from their Stalliongradian counterparts.

The overall weight of the tank was greater than that of the 279, but its ground pressure was still relatively low. Trials in Greneclyf concluded that the gearbox allowed for a speedy reverse acceleration but poor top speed. The project fell through when Stalliongrad retired the head designer."

As such, he has taken upon himself to dedicate his life to the defense of Greneclyf and of his House. Despite his martial skill, Feilean is a kind-hearted soul, and wishes to be more like his younger sister. His defensive attitude translates into a good sense of where to stand and where to fight as well as a careful strategist.§!\n\n§YPortrait By§!§L: bunnyshrubby§!"

 GOLDAIN_MIL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!§L: 9th of November 974, in Blosmport§!\n\n§YRank§!§L: Ghinearál§!\n\n§YBiography§!§L: Goldáin was born into the esteemed Ámharáin family to a drone mother, rich from the trade with Farbrookian ponies and as the sixth of eight siblings. He was named after Goldblóma, a Farbrookian stallion, a long-time family friend and devoted business partner to Goldáin's parents. Being the third youngest among his siblings, he had no chance to inherit the family fortune. Still, his loving parents provided him with the highest quality education reserved only for Greneclyf's wealthiest.\n\nAfter being accepted to officer school, the young Goldáin earned a reputation as a quick-witted and charming person, securing relatively high marks in subjects as well as a certain amount of popularity in the class of 998. His inherent capacity to lead others was honed during his time at the academy and made him an excellent prospective officer. However, due to an altercation abroad regarding a Farbrookian mare, Goldáin's fast-track came to a sudden halt and was seriously reprimanded for his unprofessional behaviour. The only thing that prevented him from being dishonourably discharged or sacked was that he defended the mare, Gimcynn, from suspected criminals. In this, he gained both the respect and admiration of Gimcynn.\n\nNot long after 1003, while still serving in the Greneclyfian Army as a captain, Goldáin's friendship with Gymcinn bloomed into something more, and the two now reside together in Blosmport. A major before the reforms, a superior officer recommended his promotion to general. Though others of his rank eye this with suspicion, Goldáin's youthful energy, while perhaps reckless, promises new ideas to Greneclyf's General Staff.§!\n\n§YPortrait By§!§L: Neither§!"

 SNOW_MIL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!§L: Unknown, some time before the 7th century, in Pengaia§!\n\n§YRank§!§L: Ghinearál§!\n\n§YBiography§!§L: Standing out like a sore hoof among the sea of Greneclyfians, Snow Wingfrost is something of a curiosity on the island. Though by no means a small creature, his stature pales compared to his kin and belies his age. Even he wouldn't know how old he truly is.\n\nLong ago, Snow had abandoned his tribes in the far South in search of a place to deepen his understanding of modern warfare. His wanderings eventually led him to the Griffonian Empire, where he could learn through second-hoof knowledge from the few griffons willing to share or trade. Finally, through a long period of self-teaching, Frostwing grew to have a deep understanding of the griffon school of war and would have been a knowledgeable peer had the griffon courts accepted him. Instead, Snow would only be known as a dragon squatting on the outskirts of Vinnin.\n\nNews of a changeling rearmament campaign reached the dragon, and he was interested in playing his part in a historic undertaking. Of course, the changeling attaché Snow had heard of was from the West, but those who told him of the changelings' lands pointed him to Greneclyf. By pure coincidence, the Greneclyfians were also in the midst of a rearmament program, and Queen Nóra Mhic readily accepted the service offered by Frostwing. Working alongside Feilean, the two modernised the Greneclyfian armed forces, and for his part, Snow was awarded a special place in Greneclyfian society and its military.\n\n§YPortrait By§!§L: Rich May§!"

 CAIT_NAVY_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!§L: 12th of May 973, in Aisling§!\n\n§YRank§!§L: Aimiréal§!\n\n§YBiography§!§L: Born into a relatively poor family of drones, Cait Murchbagh was thrust into a position of nobility due to her hatching as a royal. This, however, made her a noble of nothing in her home of Aisling. The life of nobility never captured Cait's interest and she promptly left it to take on her family's expertise at sea. Coming from a family of traditional sea drones, it wasn't much of a surprise. Unlike her parents, however, the young queen found a career as a naval officer in the defence flotilla of Aisling and made a name for herself.\n\nOnce the Greneclyfian Admiralty was formed, Cait's name was put forward and her experience catapulted to the rank of admiral, as Greneclyf was desperate for admirals. Being a seasoned naval officer, Admiral Murchbagh had several victories against raiders and pirates under her belt and was known to be a dangerous opponent to her foes. Some from the Council of Royals may have baulked at Cait's career path. In contrast, she has often said that she felt most at home at the helm of a warship, and that 'I wouldn't trade it for all of the titles and riches of Greneclyf.'§!\n\n§YPortrait By§!§L: Empress Bridle§!"

#O Saviour, have they tried,
#Surge past all our caste;
#Safe into the haven guide;
#O receive their souls at last.

#""Out of my way!" Cernhelm roared, throwing the royal guards aside with a mighty shove before barging against the door. The massive gates, meant to be opened by four together, creaked and were slammed open as Cernhelm pushed, heaved, and threw them open. The chamber beyond was regal, but the signs of grief were scattered all over them like petals around the bud that was Gytha's bed. Storming inside, Cernhelm saw the dismal sight of the one he had come for: she lay on the bed, having pushed herself slowly up to see what was happening, and already he saw the play going over her face. Shock, surprise, composure so quick it was as if her life depended on it, and then that damn calm.\n\n"I did not expect yo—" she began before he reached her, stepping up to the bed and wrapping his arms around her, without reservation or hesitation.\n\n"They are all idiots!" he exclaimed. "Foals and narrow-minded buffoons! They got a treasure, and they threw it away because they wouldn't know their flanks from it! You weren't wrong, you were greater than I ever imagined, and I thought you didn't even need me to triumph! I'm sorry Gytha, I'm so sorry..." The words came pouring out of him, tears beginning to well up. "You weren't wrong, you were radiant, and damn those southern morons for not seeing it! But not you, never you!"\n\nGytha had frozen at first in his embrace, but as he fell silent her breathing, rapid as the surprise was, turned ragged. A sniffle turned into a sob, and then tears rolled down her cheeks as she returned the embrace, crying in grief and pain over the events of the last months. All her hopes and dreams had shattered, creating a bed of glass for her to lie in. Now, she found if not peace then at least solace, leaning into his embrace and finally, after so long, crying. She wept over how she had hoped for a kinder world for her people and had it all thrown back into his face. Yet, she wept because the icy cold of despair that had settled over her shattered as well, broken by this rough, uncouth hillpony who came for her when nobody else did.\n\nUnseen by either Chief or Queen was a smartly dressed Feilean watching from beyond the threshold. A soft smile adorned his face as he silently closed the door. He had been one of the many who doubted that his sister's affection of Cenhelm was anything more than a passing crush, and he wasn't often wrong.\n\nThis was one of the few times that he was thankful that he was wrong."

#the following three are "romanced by Ardent, reviewed by King Buggo, and sapped by Yuri"
#Cenhelm gazed out at the faint silhouettes appearing through the cool fog. If the morning calm held, they'd start seeing the spires of Blosmport soon, and then the ferry could make for the nearest dock. The voyage had been fair for the most part, though it mattered little to the smiling Chief of Farbrook, steered by nought but heart and dream.\n\n"Good mornin' Chief," the approaching ferry captain said, tipping his officer's cap in greeting. "You seem to be in bright spirits."\n\n"Yes." Cenhelm chuckled with a nod. "I am indeed."n\n\"Thinking about the Queen again?" The ferry captain joined his side. "Must be a lot to think about, if you don't mind sharing."\n\n"Absolutely, but where do I begin?" Farbrook's Chief beamed lively, his eyes entranced on the looming island. "Gytha's heart is as beautiful as she, and she tries her best to care for everycreature. She can try a bit too much at times, but being able to hold onto her convictions so openly against all the world has thrown at her is beyond admirable. Gytha is wonderful, and I truly believe in her ideas of our countries joining through mutual love and growth together, though whenever she speaks, I always swear her words are trying to magically embrace me." He paused and sheepishly added, "That, uh, could just be her Greneclyfian accent..."\n\nCenhelm pushed his embarrassment aside. "Our peoples have nothing to fear. She is more capable of leading a nation than she believes herself to be, and I couldn't ask for a better best friend at my side in this than her. With everything going on, I only hope our relationship can—" A commotion caught his attention, and the Chief glimpsed over... only to double-take at the emerging ferry captain furiously demanding who stole his officer's cap.\n\nThere was a shimmering pop and a pair of hooves gently wrapped around Cenhelm's shoulders from behind. "What was that about my accent, dear?"

#Gytha knew it was too good to last. Everything had gone by like a wonderful dream—the wedding, the honeymoon, the bliss of each moment she spent with her husband. All of it came to an end when Cenhelm, having risen earlier, stood determined before her. Cute as he looked, Gytha wasn't so swayed.\n\n"I'm going abroad as an attaché," Cenhelm repeated.\n\nThe Queen stretched out her legs before lazily tumbling over on their bed to sit up, "No, you're not, and I'm trampling whoever came up with the thought."\nShe straightened her neck and met his gaze, the silence between them interrupted only by the twitching of her wings. Looming over him, however, seemed to only bolster his resolve.\n\n"Gytha, it was my idea," Cenhelm said, continuing to look up at her eyes, "If I am to remain your King, I must use any opportunity to improve myself. I cannot let myself grow complacent, and I could never forgive myself if I was unable to defend you or everycreature in Beorgfordas. That is why I am doing this."\n\nGytha withheld her grimace. She understood his reasoning, even if she was personally against every conception of it. Her beloved husband belonged here, not away trying to better himself for her and Beorgfordas. He was hers, now and forever, and staring down at the pony... she could already tell he had committed himself to this.\n\nShe huffed and forlornly sunk her head onto the rumpled sheets. A sulking moment passed before Cenhelm pulled himself up and nuzzled her side, "I'll be back before you know it."\n\nGytha gently craned her head around and captured his lips in hers, "You better."

#At last! No amount of time abroad learning new interplays of tactics, stratagems, and politics could keep King Cenhelm from yearning for Beorgfordas. Finally, his hooves now walked across the palace threshold. He was home, and not much national fanfare heralded his and his retinue's arrival, just as he requested. Aside from the journey too tiresome for them to be awash in loud spectacle, Cenhelm had been hoping that he could return unnoticed and surprise his most beautiful wife in the world. Though, as expected, it was all for nought the instant he subtly noticed one curiously cute drone tailing him ever since they had boarded the ferry.\n\nOnly when his retinue had finally bidden their departure did Cenhelm approach the drone, who had taken the guise of an ensign and appeared busy with some paperwork. It took every ounce of restraint behind his smirk to keep himself from laughing. "Well, hello there. What may your King do for a cute changeling like yourself on this lovely morning?"\n\nThe drone sputtered and blushed feverishly. "I... your majesty! W-what would the Queen say?!"\n\n"Considering how beautiful you look today..." Cenhelm leaned in. "I believe she would approve, wouldn't you, Gytha?"\n\nThe drone took a step back with an audible huff and set aside a file before dispelling her appearance, growing triple her size and leering over him with deep red irises. Her cheeks were still tinged with blush, which made her pout all the more adorable. "Glad I was right," Cenhelm said with a chuckle.\n\nGytha mumbled a growl and threw herself forward, her hooves snatching him up and closing the gap between them. When they broke from the kiss, Cenhelm managed to find his breath. "And here I was thinking you didn't like me."\n\n"A lot more than yesterday." The Queen smirked. "And a lot less than tomorrow."

#Two nothings is nothing. That's mathematics! You can argue with me, but you can't argue with figures! Two half nothings is a whole nothing!

#I preface this with mentioning one of my favourite writers growing up, our popular hero, Dairile. And I remember her exact words: "You asked my father to wait, my brother to wait, my uncle to wait. How long must I wait for equality? How long must I wait on rights, liberty and acceptance?" As a changeling nymph, her words resonated with me because I knew that the continent denied me my rights, and I personalised this feeling.
#But, as I grew, I began to understand: poor ponies were denied. They dismissed destitute dogs. Everyone but the leaders, that small group among all of us, have been declined our rights. So I ask you to look to your peers present. Look to them, and say, "friends, the time is now. There are more of us; we are stronger, and we will wait no longer."
#The time is now. When asked to pledge your support, I need you to carry the memory of my words: changelings, ponies, dogs, griffons, males, females, we are all in this together. We are united. Our time is right now.
#We will not wait fifty more years, nor another month. We will not even wait for another queen. It is not some abstract that may happen in the future. It is not something that might be, that could be, that would be, that should be. It's not coming tomorrow; this is happening NOW.
#Our companion Cader Sclerite shall be Greneclyf's leader and hope. Pledge your support, as I have, to him.

#Day of Democracy

#Our only strength is the will to survive, knowing that we will perish, knowing nothing more absolute.
#We rise, towards the sun! Those who died, died fighting. They are now buried in the sun. No need to mourn, there is a raid to the sun.
#They did not let us sing our songs. They are afraid, afraid of the dawn. They are afraid of hope, but our songs will be sung.
#There is a destiny above destiny.
#There is a victory growing with every morning.
#There is a God beyond existence or nonexistence.
#There is my country beyond everything, my beloved.
#There is the evil that tortures and tears me down.
#There are songs to be sung in affectation of our victories.
#Beyond the next morning, there is a victory waiting to be won.
#Do not doubt the One! There is a decision coming from the heavens.
#Fear not when the dark falls! There is an artist painting the sun.
#Do not dare to surrender! There is a victory that grows with defeat.

#My name was burnt into ashes, as I once was.

#Some political analysts make the mistake that their enemies should also be ours.
#It is not not those who can inflict the most, but those who can suffer the most who will conquer.
#Dirty Tools for a Dirty Job
#Tabhair arm dó láithreach! Ar son saoirse agus bua! Arna eisiúint ag coiste cosanta nGreneclyf

#There will be no people in Greneclyf, for all property of every sort shall belong to the Ruler. The people are her children and she shall care for them. Each person will be given freely by their neighbours whatever they require for their use, which is as much as any one may reasonably desire.

#Everyone shall work half the time and play half the time, and the people shall enjoy the work as much as they do the play, because it is good to be occupied to have something to do. There shall be no cruel overseers to watch them, and no one to rebuke or find fault with them. So each one shall be proud to do all that they can for their friends and neighbours, and be glad when they would accept the the things they produced.

#Everyone, no matter what they produced for the community, shall be supplied by the neighbours with food and clothing and a house and furniture and ornaments and games. If by chance the supply ever runs short, more shall be taken from the great storehouses of the Ruler, which would afterwards be filled up again when there is more of any article than the people needed.

 ### SUNDERER FOCI ###

 greneclyf_slana:0 "The Sunderer Focus Tree"

 NCH_introducing_the_sunderer:0 "Introducing the Sunderer"
 NCH_introducing_the_sunderer_desc:0 "Reality is often stranger than fiction, but the tales shared by the miracle maker beggar belief despite their veracity. The Sunderer is ready and willing to begin her work, necessitating a proper introduction into the government. Though many will question Queen Oiren's judgement, the Sunderer's deeds will be proof enough to sway even the most sceptical."

 NCH_adressing_the_economy:0 "Adressing the Economy"
 NCH_adressing_the_economy_desc:0 "We are on the edge of total economic collapse, and its causes are many. Though the Sunderer is ready to step in where needed, she and the Queen have agreed that they must draw up plans if the Sunderer cannot tackle the relevant issues. Worse comes to worst, the Queen will have a path to tread upon to bring back us from the precipice."
 
 NCH_educate_the_masses:0 "Educate the Masses"
 NCH_educate_the_masses_desc:0 "It is unconscionable for the people of a modern nation to be uneducated, and we will be in no position to thrive. Our education system has not been updated appropriately to the times, with too few schools and too few enrolments. We must expand the number of schools and do what we can to encourage greater turnouts. The Sunderer may have her own idea on how to tackle this issue."

 NCH_tackling_poverty:0 "Tackling Poverty"
 NCH_tackling_poverty_desc:0 "The dregs of society are filled with the poor and destitute who struggle to live, let alone make a living. While our efforts to raise them out of the hole they have sunk into are all-encompassing, there will undoubtedly be those just out of our view, doomed to be forgotten forever. The Sunderer is particularly keen to take charge of this issue as it seems personal to her."

 NCH_industry_of_the_faithful:0 "Industry of the Faithful"
 NCH_industry_of_the_faithful_desc:0 "Our great efforts to dig Greneclyf out of its stagnation have mostly succeeded, but there is still work to be done. Though she agrees that speed is vital, the Sunderer foresees much tragedy and blunder if she is not the one to lead this programme."

 NCH_dealing_with_the_cpm:0 "Dealing with the CPM"
 NCH_dealing_with_the_cpm_desc:0 "The CPM is the most significant outside political obstacle to our continued governance, and it is only through their sway with the Dairile supporters and the common drones that we can end the unrest. We will first have to approach its leader, Cader Sclerite, and see what deal we can reach to earn support from the CPM."

 NCH_elicit_eolans_support:0 "Elicit Eolan's Support"
 NCH_elicit_eolans_support_desc:0 "Gille Gadhra and his brand are household names and synonymous with wealth, but his actual value is his business connections. We must exploit these to help grease our nation's political and industrial machine. However, the Sunderer sees excellent potential in Eolan were he convinced to participate in government, and she knows she can manage to bring him to our side."

 NCH_faceoff_with_fennore:0 "Faceoff with Fennore"
 NCH_faceoff_with_fennore_desc:0 "With Cader Sclerite's help, we have managed to calm the populace. However, it's clear that the Dairile movement is still alive and that the continued rhetoric from Fennore Dhomnaigh is stoking it. It will remain a severe thorn in Queen Oiren's rule if not dealt with, and what better way than reaching Fennore herself? The Sunderer may have an idea and would like to handle her personally."

 NCH_bettering_queen_oiren:0 "Bettering Queen Oiren"
 NCH_bettering_queen_oiren_desc:0 "Despite the Queen's upbringing and schooling, the immense responsibilities heaped upon Oiren and her natural tendencies have made her a less-than-stellar speaker. A true Queen should be at her best to lead her people; thus, we must address this issue. The Sunderer, being the most approachable Greneclyfian, would be the perfect teacher to iron out Oiren's speech impediments."

 NCH_handling_the_council_of_royals:0 "Handling the Council of Royals"
 NCH_handling_the_council_of_royals_desc:0 "The Council of Royals has good reason to be sceptical of the Sunderer and now the Queen. It will stifle the Crown if we do not act to address its concerns and decisively convince it of our capacity to govern. We expect nothing but dutiful compliance and support from the Council as we work to steer the nation back onto its intended course towards modernity, wealth, and power."

 NCH_finding_felian:0 "Finding Feilean"
 NCH_finding_felian_desc:0 "Though a Leahman, Marshal Feilean has demonstrated a mind for all things administrative, organisational, and martial. With Gytha's gormless resignation, he is angry and, fortunately for us, left wanting to be helpful. We need only to approach him to make use of this want. The Sunderer, however, has noticed this and is insistent that she deals with Feilean personally." #If Gytha lives
 #NCH_finding_felian_desc:0 "Our marshal is heartbroken. Having lost both his mother and sister, his sprightly demeanour is gone, and he is left to languish in his misery. We must pull Feilean Leahman out of his depressive mood if he is to be of any use. Seemingly touched, the Sunderer has politely yet firmly asked to meet with him privately." #If Gytha is ded

 NCH_meeting_murchbagh:0 "Meeting Murchbagh"
 NCH_meeting_murchbagh_desc:0 "The head of our navy, Admiral Cait Murchbagh, must be on the same page as the Crown and has to make the most of her dilapidated station. We must correct the ruined reputation of the navy, and it begins with the perception of it. The Sunderer has expressed interest in meeting the Admiral and is sure she can have Murchbagh do far more than fix our naval prestige."

 NCH_comforting_the_masses:0 "Comforting the Masses"
 NCH_comforting_the_masses_desc:0 "Our people are lost. They have had to deal with the loss of two Queens in quick succession and now have to contend with the news of the Sunderer's return. Many are concerned over the state of our nation, while some are downright panicked. Queen Oiren and the Sunderer must draw up plans to comfort the masses."

 NCH_rallying_the_people:0 "Rallying the People"
 NCH_rallying_the_people_desc:0 "A panicked mob is a danger to its surroundings as well as itself, and often, a strong figure is needed to calm it down. In their frenzy, many changelings have driven themselves into near poverty, causing Greneclyfian society as a whole to spiral downwards. The Sunderer claims experience in leading drones through seamingly unwinnable battles, and would be best suited for the task."

 NCH_gathering_the_intelligentsia:0 "Gathering the Intelligentsia"
 NCH_gathering_the_intelligentsia_desc:0 "Divided, fractured, and confused, the core of Greneclyf's academia has had little time to recover from the national strife, and has instead retreated within itself out of fear and obstinacy. It would take a silver tongue to coax them out to do their part, and the Sunderer seems more than happy to take on the challenge."

 NCH_defeating_illiteracy:0 "Defeating Illiteracy"
 NCH_defeating_illiteracy_desc:0 "We have won the first battle in our war against illiteracy, but many more are to come. Book drives have proven successful, but could be vectors for unwanted and dangerous ideas. The Sunderer claims plenty of experience in 'shepherding' changelings and protecting them from indocrination..."
 
 NCH_toiling_for_a_nation:0 "Toiling for a Nation"
 NCH_toiling_for_a_nation_desc:0 "Our previous attempts to industrialise were languid at best, and it is high time we give it another try. A genuine try. Through blood, sweat, and tears, Greneclyf shall pull itself out of the hole it has dug for itself."

 NCH_the_private_beneficiaries:0 "Private Beneficiaries"
 NCH_the_private_beneficiaries_desc:0 "Thanks in no small part to the efforts of the Sunderer, we have secured the funds and the personnel required to embark on the arduous road to digging the nation out of the hole of industrial and economic stagnation. With Eolan's means, and the will of the changelings we rescued, we stand on the starting line."

 NCH_reaching_the_masses:0 "Reaching the Masses"
 NCH_reaching_the_masses_desc:0 "Through Marshal Feilean's leadership and Admiral Murchbagh's efforts, we have the necessary people and means to take our first major step towards a literate populace. The process shall not be painless, as the project will still rely upon the intelligentsia, but with Feilean's steady hoof, we expect great success."

 NCH_fomenting_a_new_generation:0 "Fomenting a New Generation"
 NCH_fomenting_a_new_generation_desc:0 "Illiteracy is a plague that slowly kills our society, and we must do everything within our power to excise this cancer from our nation. Much will be lost, and we will be left weakened for a long time, but it is essential to ensure that we may raise new generations in a nation free from illiteracy."

 NCH_employ_CPM_and_GCS:0 "Employ the CPM and GCS"
 NCH_employ_CPM_and_GCS_desc:0 "While we have had issues with both the CPM and GCS in the past, we musn't ignore their value. The GCS plays a crucial role in the well-being of the nation, while the CPM has the people's whole-hearted support. Elevating these two will inevitably slant our agenda towards the civilian sector, which is an essential foundation for any country—even the Sunderer agrees."
 
 NCH_seeing_to_the_army:0 "Seeing to the Army"
 NCH_seeing_to_the_army_desc:0 "Giving primacy to the army this early may seem hasty, but it would greatly benefit the efficacy and organisation of our armed forces in the future. Elevating Marshal Feilean would furthermore help ensure an orderly and well-run army, something that the Sunderer deems crucial to the long-term survival of our nation."

 NCH_long_live_the_sunderer:0 "Long Live the Sunderer"
 NCH_long_live_the_sunderer_desc:0 "There is no denying it: we owe most, if not all of our success to the Sunderer. She has both directly and indirectly changed the nation for the better, and this should be officially recognised and celebrated. Once the heroine of all changeling kind, now the heroine of Greneclyf, she deserves a reward befitting her brilliant glory."
 
 NCH_introducing_execration:0 "Introducing Execration"
 NCH_introducing_execration_desc:0 "We changelings are fated to feed on love, but it is not the only emotion that lends us power. Wrath has been deemed a taboo emotion to feed upon, and for good reason. However, I am fortunate enough to be ever so intimately familiar with the power that wrath, or "execrate", as I call it, offers. I shall teach my people how to wield it."
 
 NCH_thoroughfares_for_the_weary:0 "Thoroughfares for the Weary"
 NCH_thoroughfares_for_the_weary_desc:0 "Those who are lost in the dark must be shown the way. I shall provide them with the fire to light their path, in both spirit and reality. New roads shall be laid down, all showing a clear path for the weary. The trails shall lead them to their purpose, either through a shelter, or through me."
 
 NCH_manufactories_for_the_vagrants:0 "Manufactories for the Vagrants"
 NCH_manufactories_for_the_vagrants_desc:0 "Too many listless changelings meander about, wasting away their lives. They are not to be blamed, but instead to be given renewed purpose. To all unskilled vagrants, I shall give the opportunity to work towards the greater goal of our kind. New factories and workshops will fill them a sense of purpose and belonging as they contribute to society."
 
 NCH_dockage_for_the_lost:0 "Dockage for the Lost"
 NCH_dockage_for_the_lost_desc:0 "In spite of our prior efforts, our nation remains isolated from the world, yet many of my people long to travel, to find their place in this world. Who am I to oppose such a desire? Instead, I shall enable it, all while fulfiling a... useful secondary purpose."
 
 NCH_house_of_praise_for_sacrament:0 "House of Praise for Sacrament"
 NCH_house_of_praise_for_sacrament_desc:0 "In my absence, my people have kept the memory of my deeds alive through houses of praise. 'Tis both humbling and perhaps overly exalting, but I have seen it content the assembled worshippers and unite communities. Though I am no deity, they should be given the means to sing their praises as they see fit. I do wonder... How will the people see me once all is over?"
 
 NCH_schools_for_the_misguided:0 "Schools for the Misguided"
 NCH_schools_for_the_misguided_desc:0 "There are some who, by a twist of fate, have strayed from the right path. Though it would be easy to punish them without a second thought, it would be nothing but a waste. I should establish schools to take in these misguided changelings and be educate them into respectable members of society."
 
 NCH_toil_for_the_restless:0 "Toil for the Restless"
 NCH_toil_for_the_restless_desc:0 "Among my people, there are those who cannot find respite without an occupation to provide them with purpose. To save these restless souls, I shall offer them labour programmes, and finally give them peace of mind."
 
 NCH_port_of_the_heavens:0 "Port of the Heavens"
 NCH_port_of_the_heavens_desc:0 "I am no stranger to flight, but the flying machines that have become commonplace are a sight to behold. They carry ever such potential, and their adoption can be encouraged by helping construct the necessary infrastructure. These shall see use by both the civil society and, when the time comes, the nascent military of the air."
 
 NCH_digging_for_the_pentient:0 "Digging for the Penitent"
 NCH_digging_for_the_pentient_desc:0 "There are some whom mere work fails to soothe. Their reasons are varied, and all worthy of sympathy, but only in back-breaking work do these changelings find a semblance of solace. The mineral extraction industry is the ideal penitence for these souls, though more needs to be done to expand this industry."
 
 NCH_poor_no_more:0 "Poor No More"
 NCH_poor_no_more_desc:0 "The efforts put into giving all of my people the means to make a living have finally begun to pay dividends. Streets once filled with beggars and paupers have now become bright neighbourhoods populated only by content workers and citizens no longer burdened by the worry of finding shelter. To see my kind given purpose and saved from bleak circumstances warms this old heart."
 
 NCH_helmslings_of_the_sunderer:0 "Helmslings of the Sunderer"
 NCH_helmslings_of_the_sunderer_desc:0 "Grenatalahm is a nation of sailors, and it cries out for proper vessels to sail the seas. New investments and shipbuilding techniques are necessary to fulfil this need, and I intend to arrange for that, quickly and effectively. The people of Grenatalahm shall once more be fully able to set sail without fear or limits."
 
 NCH_harnessing_the_fire_they_give:0 "Harnessing the Fire They Give"
 NCH_harnessing_the_fire_they_give_desc:0 "Now that my people have stilled their hearts and shattered the taboo of execration, it is time for me to reveal how to harness it. 'Tis an unpleasant sensation for the unaccustomed, but it can become as second-nature as consuming love. My people ought to practice this skill, for there will come a time to use it."
 
 NCH_tempering_the_excesses:0 "Tempering the Excesses"
 NCH_tempering_the_excesses_desc:0 "Wrath is powerful, exceedingly so. Like a fire, it can easily kill its user if wielded carelessly, and like love, it can enthrall changelings who indulge in excess, but with the right knowledge, it can be channelled into incantations meant to focus the wielder, providing willpower, stamina, amongst other boons. As powerful as these incantations may be, they are but a fraction of execration's potential."
 
 NCH_expiations_of_the_ignorant:0 "Expiations of the Ignorant"
 NCH_expiations_of_the_ignorant_desc:0 "With a renewed sense of purpose, many of the previously misguided changelings now find themselves true apostles of our new societal structure. As many civilians remain hesitant, I shall have the faithful spread the word of the new status quo, bringing the unconvinced both the knowledge and the will to break free of their ignorance."
 
 NCH_confratenity_of_the_scholars:0 "Confratenity of the Scholars"
 NCH_confratenity_of_the_scholars_desc:0 "A single changeling may be a fairly intelligent being, but when brought together, our wisdom knows no bound. This nation houses many scholars, and they shall truly shine when brought together. To do so, I shall found and fund closely-knit associations, each dedicated to a branch of science."
 
 NCH_enlightenment_for_all:0 "Enlightenment for All"
 NCH_enlightenment_for_all_desc:0 "Though it took a long time, my successful coralling of the disparate scientists, scholars, and intellectual civilians has brought about such monumental changes that it would be false to call our nation backwards. From this day on, Grenatalahm shall be renowned for its intelligentsia and enlightened populace."
 
 NCH_ablution_of_the_common_hearts:0 "Ablution of the Common Hearts"
 NCH_ablution_of_the_common_hearts_desc:0 "In a way, I admire my predecessors' adherence to pacifism. In an ideal world, it would be the noblest goal to strive for, but my kin shall learn that mere intent cannot make such a world a reality. We must do away with this foalish idea to ensure that all are prepared to carry out the necessary. One day, I pray, we may resume our journey towards this righteous goal."
 
 NCH_mastery_over_the_seas:0 "Mastery Over the Seas"
 NCH_mastery_over_the_seas_desc:0 "Of what benefit is a good vessel if one does not use it properly? Much like a finely honed weapon, a navy neccessitates a series of tenets for all to follow, allowing them to master not just their ships, but the very seas themselves."
 
 NCH_changeling_warriors:0 "Changeling Warriors"
 NCH_changeling_warriors_desc:0 "Our kin was born out of strife, and through strife, I have won our freedom. It is in our very blood to fight for the right cause; each and every one of us holds strength and will within, hidden away. Our soldiers shall be made into the very epitome of warriors, for no one else can truly match the power nor spirit of a true changeling warrior."
 
 NCH_establish_the_preceptory:0 "Establish the Preceptory"
 NCH_establish_the_preceptory_desc:0 "Much to my satisfaction, most of my subjects have begun to wield execrate, but it seems only a few can utilise its full potential. Perhaps, much like the Hatcher once did, I shall elevate these gifted changelings, make them preceptors who can fight, but also lead and teach."
 
 NCH_constructing_the_future:0 "Constructing the Future"
 NCH_constructing_the_future_desc:0 "Much can still be done to develop our heavy industry's methodology. I shall have our specialists focus on conceptualising improvements to the procedures and techniques used in various fields."
 
 NCH_building_the_weapons:0 "Building the Weapons"
 NCH_building_the_weapons_desc:0 "While an excellent warrior can fight with naught but their body, not even I would shun a weapon, and neither shall my soldiers, as they shall each carry the finest arms that hooves and horn can craft. Let us incentivise the gunsmiths of Grenatalhm to produce more of the modern warrior's tools."
 
 NCH_repurpose_the_vessels:0 "Repurpose the Vessels"
 NCH_repurpose_the_vessels_desc:0 "My predecessor's mistake can become my own if I leave it unresolved. The despicable griffons responsible shall eventually answer to our righteous wrath, but for now, we should work with what we have. Once reforged, even dulled blades can become lethal."
 
 NCH_the_coastal_marchers:0 "The Coastal Marchers"
 NCH_the_coastal_marchers_desc:0 "Grenatalhm's geographical reality poses a substantial challenge, and most of the army is unprepared for the fight borne from the sea—an eventuality we will have to face. To correct this, I shall have two divisions of specialists raised, ready to march upon the coasts of our foes."

 NCH_the_bringers_of_fire:0 "The Bringers of Fire"
 NCH_the_bringers_of_fire_desc:0 "What I would have given to have one of these terrifying weapons against the Hatcher! In today's world, however, we shall primarily face enemies bearing hundreds, if not thousands, of these guns. What they have in quantity, we shall overtake with sheer quality and power."
 
 NCH_reap_the_wealth_of_the_earth:0 "Reap the Wealth of the Earth"
 NCH_reap_the_wealth_of_the_earth_desc:0 "We feed upon love for sustenance, but the society of today requires minerals and resources to function. I shall direct our experts to research more efficient methods of extraction, and to discover new deposits. Much like a single changeling, our society can only thrive when all its needs are met."
 
 NCH_builders_of_a_new_world:0 "Builders of a New World"
 NCH_builders_of_a_new_world_desc:0 "Our hives only made possible by our architecturally-minded species and society, but we can and should further hone our construction techniques. Encouraging continued reliance on our natural instincts will be a wondrous complement to the modern methods."
 
 NCH_light_by_another_means:0 "Light by Another Means"
 NCH_light_by_another_means_desc:0 "Though I cannot begin to understand the intricacies of non-magical electricity, I do understand the scope of its potential. There is no reason for changelings to fall behind in the field of 'electronics', and we may even find ourselves at the forefront."
 
 NCH_the_seaborn_army:0 "The Seaborn Army"
 NCH_the_seaborn_army_desc:0 "We must once and for all face that our island shall forever remain our base of operations; our army must always be prepared to invade from the sea. Many will find adjusting to this doctrine difficult, but with it in place, our forces shall never fear an amphibious assault."
 
 NCH_the_land_army:0 "The Land Army"
 NCH_the_land_army_desc:0 "The continent is massive, and when the time comes to fight upon it, we will require both cunning and numbers. Renewed training regimens for the quick drilling of our forces, confident and capable officers to bring out the best of our soldiers, and impassioned appeals to attract volunteers: that is my vision of our army, and it shall be glorious."
 
 NCH_industry_maketh_society:0 "Industry Maketh Society"
 NCH_industry_maketh_society_desc:0 "Changelings are, by our very nature, an industrious species, and I am pleased to see we have adapted to modern times. It is with this knowledge that we shall create the greatest society that this world has ever seen; our factories shall be known for their prolific output that shall far outstrip any other nation's."
 
 NCH_forever_expanding_our_ken:0 "Forever Expanding our Ken"
 NCH_forever_expanding_our_ken_desc:0 "There is no limit to mortal knowledge, though some claim that to attempt to learn everything is fool's errand. But how about me? Was I a fool for attempting —and achieving— the impossible? When there is the will and there is a way, nothing lies beyond our reach. Each and every field of study shall stand on the cutting edge, and our nation shall be known throughout the world as a place of learners and inventors."
 
 NCH_invoke_our_shared_destiny:0 "Invoke our Shared Destiny"
 NCH_invoke_our_shared_destiny_desc:0 "Changelings are dependant on other species by our very nature, even... by design. Our kin have attempted to achieve coexistence through diplomacy, only to be rebuffed for their great efforts. If we are to ensure our survival, we must coerce our so called 'friends' through military force; our campaign shall require a mobilisation of a scale never seen before."
 
 NCH_an_example_of_our_kindness_and_strength:0 "An Example of Our Kindness and Strength"
 NCH_an_example_of_our_kindness_and_strength_desc:0 "We are not monsters. Unlike our unrefined and brutish brethren from Equus, we understand that we must cherish and nurture those whom we rely upon for sustenance, though mere words have yet to convince the Hillpony folk. Through policies, I shall demonstrate that non-changelings have nothing to fear living under our rule, and in fact stand to greatly benefit from it."
 
 NCH_nourishing_our_capacities:0 "Nourishing Our Capacities"
 NCH_nourishing_our_capacities_desc:0 "With the proper infrastructure established, our shipyards are now on par with most modern nations. Of course, this remains insufficient for our purposes; our shipwrights must yet grow more productive. With enough incentives, I am sure that these clever workers will come up with new, more efficient methods to build ships even faster."
 
 NCH_raising_our_sea_wings:0 "Raising Our Sea Wings"
 NCH_raising_our_sea_wings_desc:0 "From what I have witnessed, aircraft dedicated to sea-borne operations are both effective weapons and sturdy shields for our naval assets. I should push for our engineers to design newer models to ensure our naval pilots are not left behind in the arms race above the seas."
 
 NCH_the_water_wings:0 "The Water Wings"
 NCH_the_water_wings_desc:0 "There are some in the admiralty who have expressed great interest in expanding the naval air fleet of bombers, specifically those dedicated for carrier operations. As I understand it, these aircraft excel against ships and make up the fighting wings of carriers. The strength of these aircraft is self-evident, regardless of our level of carrier task force adoption."
 
 NCH_vessels_of_war:0 "Vessels Of War"
 NCH_vessels_of_war_desc:0 "The seas around Grenatalahm are rough, but they will only grow rougher when teeming with enemy ships. To prepare for any such eventuality and bring the fight to our foes, our sailors shall need refurbished and new ships alike. I shall instruct our naval bureaus to design state-of-the-art warships."

 NCH_carriers_of_victory:0 "Carriers of Victory"
 NCH_carriers_of_victory_desc:0 "Aircraft carriers are a novel idea and may even be the future of naval warfare. Easily some of the largest ships to ever set sail, they pose an equally great design challenge, but it would foolish of me to withhold the opportunity from our designers, and perhaps, our navy might become renowned for its carriers."

 NCH_guns_of_the_sea:0 "Guns of the Sea"
 NCH_guns_of_the_sea_desc:0 "The very concept of artillery and its sheer size will never fail to thrill me. These guns, when mounted on a ship, are truly something to bring terror upon any navy that dares call itself our enemy, though doing so will require sound designs for large battleships and an industry to materialise them."

 NCH_ocean_defenders:0 "Ocean Defenders"
 NCH_ocean_defenders_desc:0 "Strong as capital ships may be, even they rely on support from escort destroyers and cruisers. Nimbler, smaller, and cheaper, I see the inherent value in these otherwise unimpressive vessels. They are an essential lynchpin in any naval engagement and their firepower isn't to be underestimated. New designs shall ensure our fleet remains as flexible and powerful as possible."

 NCH_the_sharks:0 "The Sharks"
 NCH_the_sharks_desc:0 "I can appreciate the submarine for how it engages a fight. In a fair fight, it should, by all accounts, sink to the bottom of the ocean. However, much like a cunning changeling, it exploits the weakness of most ships, striking unseen and unexpected. Let our foes bemoan the 'unfairness' of submarine warfare; 'tis a valid strategem, and a wonderful tool for any navy."

 NCH_floating_cities:0 "Floating Cities"
 NCH_floating_cities_desc:0 "There are no two ways around it: the largest ships in the fleet are the most critical and the most powerful, and if we are to defeat our enemies at sea, we must deploy as many capital ships as realistically feasible. Our shipwrights will be pushed to their absolute limits, ensuring our navy may always field the greatest of warships."

 NCH_the_ships_of_the_line:0 "The Ships of the Line"
 NCH_the_ships_of_the_line_desc:0 "In ancient times, the rank and file of armoured soldiers were the mainstay of most armies. In many ways, the cruisers of today are much the same.

 greneclyf_sunderer.1.t:0 "The Changeling who can do Miracles"
 greneclyf_sunderer.1.d:0 "The news that reached Queen Oiren had been plenty and consistently either bad or about troubling developments. Every single utterance made Oiren just that bit more aware of the terrifying hardships and responsibilities that were now her own. How could one changeling resolve all of the country's woes?\n\nResigning herself to another bout of soul-crushing news, Oiren only half-listened to the new report dictated to her. However, when she failed to note the actual issue, the Queen straightened up and asked the messenger to repeat herself.\n\n"In Aisling, Your Highness. There's a petition from an unknown queen to visit you." At Oiren's insistence, the messenger continued: "Many have claimed that she has performed miracles, helping the local community in seemingly fantastical ways."\n\n"Wha– who is she?" The Queen demanded.\n\nThe messenger paused, and her lips tightened. "She purports to be Slána the Sunderer."\n\nOiren almost laughed. The Sunderer, the one who had freed all of changelingdom from the Great Hatcher Below untold millennia ago... Was petitioning the Queen? It had been a while since she had last had an honest smile, one that, surprisingly, the messenger did not share.\n\n"As insane as it may seem, Your Highness," the drone began, "the reports from the locals are emphatically in favour of this "Sunderer" person."\n\nQueen Oiren scoffed. "Do you believe tha-that this is Slána reborn?"\n\nThe drone didn't respond, but it was clear that she was considering the possibility. Oiren did so, too, slowly ruminating on the idea. It was just a visit, after all. If anything, a formal petition from a supposed miracle worker would be a welcome distraction."

A wave of relief washed over her as she signed the last document for the day. Not that the workday was finished. She still had some letters addressed to her to go through. The Queen scanned through the envelopes before spotting one that caught her eye.\n\nIt had an ornate design with the seal of the Greneclyfian Cartographers' Society. Slicing it open, Oiren began to read the letter within.\n\n"To Her Royal Highness,\n\n"We at the Greneclyfian Cartographers' Society have recently heard of the appearance of one individual going by "the Sunderer," and the members of our genealogical branch have searched for records to identify said Sunderer.\n\n"Their findings have yielded no results on the Sunderer's origins or any possible family members.

It didn't sit right with Oiren; since then, she had tried to figure out the peculiarly dressed drone with no success.\n\nHowever, the courteous smile on Cara was curiously absent. In its place was a concerned look. "What do you have t-to report?" the Queen asked.\n\n"Your Highness, as the head of the GCS, it is my duty and responsibility to appraise all court visitors, and I must admit..."

From our understanding and those of advisors, this appears to be nothing more than a confused and misguided soul at best or, at worst, a charlatan impersonating a beloved figure to gain something from Her Highness.\n\n"Though some of our coalition find it difficult to believe that Her Highness was not made aware of this possibility, we are extending our trust that this was the case and that You will correct this situation. However, should this not be the case, the CPM will consider taking action against the Crown, for we will not allow false mystics or babbling mental deficients in Her Majesty's government. We kindly ask Her Highness to have this "Sunderer" removed immediately.\n\n"With sincerest regards,\n\n"Cader Sclerite - CPM Head"\n\nQueen Oiren let out a slow breath. She had interacted with Sclerite enough to recognise that behind the diplomatic language, the threat was a promise were she not to acquiesce to the CPM's demands.

 greneclyf_sunderer.4.d:0 "Since Oiren's coronation, she had gotten few petitioned visitations from those not of her temporary cabinet. They were usually a pleasant break from the torrent of bad news that letters seemed to consistently bring. With this expectation, Oiren allowed in an uncle from her Clann. She smiled warmly when she saw Éanán's form crossing the threshold. "To w-what do I owe the pleasure of your visit, uncle?"\n\n"The mess that you're about to commit unless I talk some sense into you," the older Royal said sourly, immediately sapping Oiren's hopes. "Have you taken leave of your senses?" he asked as he approached her desk.\n\nHarrumphing, Oiren immediately knew what this was about. "Does the whole island kn-know about the upcoming visit from Slána?" she muttered aloud.\n\n"You're lucky it hasn't reached that point yet, lass!" Éanán said in a hiss. "And don't you sully the good Sunderer's name with that blasted charlatan! How could you be so daft?"\n\nOiren rose to her full height in an instant. She remembered when she was dwarfed by Éanán, but even a Royal male couldn't match a fully grown queen in size. Oiren's mouth contorted into a fanged growl but said nothing. Éanán merely sneered.\n\n"Still a child after all these years. All that's changed is that you now wear a crown." Bringing a hoof to his face, he sighed. "Listen, the Council of Royals is willing to overlook this as a minor lapse of judgment so long as you get rid of that charlatan." He paused, regarding Oiren for a moment.

 greneclyf_sunderer.5.d:0 "The hour approached, and Queen Oiren felt the onset of an all-too-familiar anxiety. It was in the same vein as the kind that had plagued her during the coronation, but it wasn't one of overwhelming responsibility. No, this oncoming apprehension was fear of committing a massive and horrible mistake. Groomed for a lifetime to take on the throne from a Leahman queen, high expectations and the heavy punishments over the slightest error had instilled in Oiren an irrational fear that she was feeling all too keenly now.\n\nEvery single changeling of note had warned her of the consequences of this upcoming meeting. From the esoteric GCS to the Republicans, even her own uncle had personally told this to Oiren. The moment she had achieved her one goal in life, even by default, and was given the authority and free reign to do as she pleased...\n\nA disconcerted Oiren stared back at her through a mirror. She saw in that reflection a young, adolescent queen who had never gotten her way, never had a say in her life. The reflection quivered with tearful eyes as Oiren bit back a sob. Why was this the one thing she was second-guessing herself over?\n\nIt couldn't have been that easy, could it? A purported return of the most laudable heroine of all changeling history just showing up during Greneclyf's darkest time? It must have been a fanciful, whimsical, fraudulent coincidence; every part of her being shrieked that this was a massive mistake.\n\nBut the slow trickle of reports and eyewitness accounts of common drones insisting upon the sincerity of the visiting Sunderer must have counted for something. Was it possible to fake so many different responses? Was this evident conspiracy truly this large and unwieldy? Could it just not be possible that this was indeed the Sunderer returned to help the island through its greatest crisis? Was it that impossible in the wondrous, magical world they all lived in?\n\nOiren blinked. Her reflection showed a sudden determination in her eyes. With a breath, she turned to do the right thing."

However, the queen before Oiren was slender and beautifully graceful in her poise. There was no blemish upon the Sunderer's face or the confident smile that she carried. Her yellow-orange eyes, resplendent with knowledge, drank in the throne room before finally settling on Oiren. The smile widened.\n\n"Your Majesty." The bow made the Sunderer's cape billow out with a flowing movement. "Allow me to extend my deepest thanks for having me. It is a great honour."\n\nOiren waved a hoof. "Arise, Slána the Sunderer. The stories surrounding you tell of grand feats and have placed gran– er, great expectations upon you."  She frowned slightly at her stutter—this was not a good time for it. As the Sunderer rose from her bow, she calmly regarded the Queen and said nothing of the mistake, nodding.\n\n"Indeed," said the Sunderer, not taking her eyes off the Queen. "I understand that this meeting was not an easy choice." At Oiren's slight recoil, her expression grew thoughtful. "That is not at all a surprise, Your Majesty. As far as you were made aware, I am but a stranger who has taken the handle of the Sunderer as her own. Who in their right mind wouldn't at least be suspicious?"\n\nOiren leaned forward with interest. "Th-then why have you taken the Sunderer's name?"\n\n"Why?" the visitor repeated back. "Why, because I am her," she said with that confident smile of hers.\n\nQueen Oiren wanted to scoff. Garnering as much authority as her power granted her, she loftily gave an order:"

How dare the Queen bestow such influence upon an imposter of the worst sort? Would she allow any charlatan sufficiently convincing or confident to steal a position of power? Could they trust Queen Oiren's judgement at all?\n\nEven the silent majority harboured doubts. Who in their right mind would believe such a mythical figure would return? Could this be a desperate ploy from the Queen to attain legitimacy with her subjects? Were this the real Sunderer, would she not have helped sooner? Were times perhaps desperate enough that Greneclyf required a miracle like the one that had saved the changeling race?\n\nHowever, amidst the hail of scepticism, the southern town of Aisling shone with faith. They had seen the Sunderer's miracles. They had witnessed her benevolence. They had watched her rise."

At the Sunderer's raised eyebrow, she added, "E-every idea I've had suffers from the same, fatal f-flaw: it has already been t-tried, and has a-already failed."\n\n"Well, I would still like to hear these ideas before I present mine, for I am certain there is gold to be found within. Let us start with some wishful thinking. If you could make a single change, a single decision, that would miraculously fix Greneclyf's economy, what would it be?"\n\nOiren opened her mouth to rebut, but cut herself short. "I guess a thriving i-industry would be one of the b-best things to ask for, but even with your power, you c-c-can't do that, can you?" Slána shook her head. "Then we are b-back to square one. Even if we had funds to f-funnel into industry, I d-doubt we would have the workers to run it. While our unemp—" Oiren cleared her throat. "Even with our sk-ky-high unemployment numbers, there are few ch-changelings who know how to o-operate the equipment, and even fewer who c-can manage an entire factory."\n\nThe Sunderer nodded. \"Indeed, but they can be taught. Within a few weeks, a new worker can learn the fundamentals.

Let us start with some wishful thinking. If you could make a single change, a single decision, that would miraculously fix Greneclyf's economy, what would it be?"\n\nOiren opened her mouth to rebut, but cut herself short. "I guess a thriving industry would be one of the best things to ask for, but even with your power, you can't do that, can you?" Slána shook her head. "Then we are back to square one. Even if we had funds to funnel into industry, I doubt we would have the workers to run it. While our unemployment numbers are sky-high, there are few changelings who know how to operate the equipment, and even fewer who can manage an entire factory."\n\nThe Sunderer nodded. "Indeed, but they can be taught. Within a few weeks, a new worker can learn the fundamentals. Within a few months, she or he can become productive enough to justify the investment."\n\n"Ideally, we would have schools to teach such things." Oiren sighed.

Even if your family HAD done something noteworthy, you, Oiren, have not, and—"\n\n"Enough!" Oiren's hooves hit the desk hard enough to hurt, knocking over her cup of tea in the process, but now that the floodgates had opened, she was far too furious too care. "I s-summoned you here, allowed to speak your t-troubles to me, and this is how you ch-choose to handle such an opportunity?" Fennore's eyes grew wide for a moment.

Thus, We extend Our warmest and kindest well-wishes to you all." She closed her eyes. "Goodnight."\n\nA moment of silence, followed quickly by a 'and we're off the air'. Oiren opened her eyes to the applause and congratulations of the broadcasting staff. She let out a breath she didn't realise she was holding and looked to the Sunderer. The drones parted before Slána as she approached, and she wore the warmest smile that Oiren had ever seen from her. She placed a hoof to Oiren's shoulder. "I knew you could do it."\n\nOiren pulled the Sunderer in for an embrace. She ignored the piqued eyebrows from the drones and merely enjoyed the contact. "I couldn't have done it without you."\n\nAfter an instance of uncertainty, Slána gladly returned the hug. "You had the capacity within you all this time. I merely showed you how to bring it to the surface." They broke contact, and she regarded Oiren. "Not that I have to ask, but how do you feel?""

What was she doing here? How had she slipped through the security? As he resurfaced, he shook the thought off, any doubts he had harboured about her identity gone. "Apologies. I had not expected any guests this late." Even if she was not the real Sunderer, it mattered little if she could pull off something like this.\n\n"'Tis I who should apologise for startling you, Eolan." She offered him a polite smile. "I do applaud your calm demeanour; many others would threaten or even attack an intruder."\n\nLevitating a towel over, he shook his head. "Maybe, but it would be a waste of opportunity to shoo someone with your abilities and connections."\n\nThe Sunderer nodded. "I suppose so." She scratched her chin, and squinted at him. "But if you value my connections so much, why have you not offered Oiren and I your full support?"\n\nEolan cocked his head, quirked an eyebrow, and expertly hid a sly smile. "The Crown hardly needs any investments from one such as myself. It would, of course, be a different story if it needed the funds to prepare Greneclyf for a military eventuality."\n\nSlána chuckled. "What makes you think she isn't? After all, her right hoof is a warrior who defeated the single greatest threat to changeling kind, the Great Hatcher Below."\n\nEolan furrowed his brow, and for a while he nodded to himself. "Tell me plainly: what can I do to ensure the Crown does what Greneclyf needs it to do?""

Around the corner came someone's steps, reverberating louder than the excited remains of the crowd on the other side of the stage.\n\nWhen the Sunderer walked through the door, Fennore smirked. "Well, well, if it isn't the famed Peacemaker Queen. Should I bow down to someone as" —she rolled her eyes— "grand as you?"\n\n\"There is no need for such formalities, Fennore, nor for such hostility. While I can veritably feel your anger, I know full well I am neither its cause nor its target." Fennore raised her brow and gave Slána a flat look; she met it with an amicable smile. "Your hatred is far too old for that; it has followed you from a very young age."\n\nFennore scoffed. "You act like I'm trying to keep my childhood a secret." She clicked her tongue. "You're gonna have to try harder than that if you want to 'show me the error of my ways'."\n\nFennore nearly panicked when Slána's smile widened. "When have I ever said you were wrong?"\n\nFennore opened her mouth to rebut, but instead held the Sunderer's gaze for a few long moments. Slowly, her eyes widened."

He owed as much to the changelings who relied on him, who needed him. Yet he could do nothing, not with his sister forever gone.\n\nWhen he shifted his head, the corner of his eyes caught on a grey and yellow shape, standing near the entrance of his quarters. How had the 'Sunderer' entered without him noticing? Not that it mattered. "Go away..." Yet she still stood there, watching him with solemn, pitying eyes. How dare she? "I told you to leave!" He righted himself and slammed the table with both hooves. "Or are you going to claim you are here to help? To perform one of your 'miracles'?" He gritted his teeth, while her extended silence only fueled the raging inferno in his chest. "Of course you aren't! You can't do anything, else you would have saved her."\n\nAs Feilean continued to glare at Slána, his fire began to cool. "The real Sunderer would have saved her. Shielded her like she shielded changelings." He gulped. "Shielded her like I should have." Just like that, the flame went out, faster than it had flared, replaced by a ball of ice in the pit of his stomach.\n\nA tear landed on the table, beneath his muzzle, followed by another, then another. Feilean struggled for breath as he suppressed sobs. He could not stop the tears, but he would be damned if he sobbed like a child in front of a fraud. A few eternities passed like this, the heavy silence only broken by Feilean's gulps.\n\nAfter several moments, the Sunderer finally spoke, "I shall leave you to your grief, Feilean, but you need to know that it is not too late for you." She waited for him to meet her eyes. "You can still shield what your sister held so very dear."\n\nWhen the door closed behind her, Feilean broke down, bawling like a changeling a quarter his age, unable to stop until he had cried the last tear in his body. Even then, he wanted to cry some more. Gytha was gone; why should he ever stop mourning? He shook his head. She wouldn't want that, and he needed to honour her memory."

As the door opened and revealed the 'Sunderer' sitting in a chair at his desk, he blinked at her for a few moments before the situation caught up to him. "What in Tartarus are you of all changelings doing here?!" He pointed an accusing hoof at her. "How did you even get in?"\n\nThe Sunderer didn't flinch when Feilean slammed the door behind him. "I have wanted to meet you for a while now, Feilean. I have heard of your achievements, of your talents, and of your calm, collected decision-making." He glowered at her, but she held his gaze, barely raising an eyebrow. "I have also heard of your recent outbursts and tendency to isolate yourself. Given recent events, I can hardly blame you, and am instead willing to lend an ear."\n\nFeilean tossed his keys onto the desk and sat down. "Yeah? Well, it's none of your bloody business," he hissed, before telekinetically checking if his drawers had remained locked.\n\n"Oh, but it is," she replied with a shake of her head and a sad smile. "Your devotion and loyalty to your sister were nothing short of admirable, and I deeply empathise with your outrage." Feilean gritted his teeth, but stayed silent. "While there is no shame in anger, it is your duty to wield it appropriately. It is your duty to wield it for Greneclyf."\n\nFeilean opened his mouth for a retort, but the Sunderer stood up, marking the end of their conversation. He scowled at her until she opened the door, nodded to him, and left. For a few seconds, he continued to glare at the door, before finally sighing."

Oiren did her best to maintain the 'authoritative queenly' glare that she had been taught, but the lack of response from the visitor made her face flush with anxiety. Even the more hardened advisors in her cabinet fidgeted under such a stare. Yet, here she was, almost ready to falter instead while meeting the calm, unwavering eyes of the Sunderer. After a moment that went on for too long, her visitor merely bowed her head and lit her horn.\n\nA ball of impossible heat engulfed the throne room. Oiren was blinded by a flare of light emanating from her body. Not that she could see much of that, as she hurriedly averted her eyes from the blaze that had overtaken her vision. She let out a breathless rasp as if she had just been struck in her chest and scrambled from her throne to hide behind it to escape the fiery wave of air. Her whole body felt like it was sizzling underneath the chitin, and her royal vestiges smouldered from the heat.\n\nOiren screamed. It was a pain unlike anything she had ever experienced before, and all she could do behind the throne was to writhe as her mind went blank, overcome by the searing whiteness that overwhelmed all of her senses.\n\nThen, as suddenly it had washed over Oiren, it immediately abated. Nothing ached, burned, or left the impression of warmth. Her dress hadn't gone up in flames, and she felt a tingling chill running all over as if she had just been splashed with water. Tentatively, she opened her eyes to see that she had not, in fact, gone blind. The throne room was still awash with light but with the intensity and colours of a lit hearth. The Queen peeked from behind the throne to see the source of all this and was once more left in awe.\n\nThe Sunderer stood as her body was literally smoking as if it was burning hot, yet she appeared utterly unfazed. Even her cloak was left unsinged. She smiled. "I trust this demonstration was suitably convincing?"\n\nThis was unlike any magic Oiren had witnessed before, changeling or otherwise; it had not been an illusion, and the Sunderer radiated with terrifying power with otherwordly spectral images swirling about her. She was genuine.\n\nOiren, hesitantly, gingerly, asked the Sunderer to continue."

Spotting the teapot on the end table, she added, "I don't suppose you merely wanted to move our tea time earlier, did you?"\n\nSlána chuckled. "Indeed not, for our talk today carries far more weight." She nodded to the sofa as Oiren furrowed her brow. After a moment, Oiren sat down and was soon joined by Slána. "When I took the reigns of this fine country, I promised I would return them to you when you asked, whenever that may be."\n\nSlána poured two cups of tea, letting the topic hang in the air. "Yet you never mentioned it. I have not insisted, for I believed it was your right to decide when you deemed yourself ready." She watched her tea swirl around for a moment before turning to look Oiren in the eye. "I understand you may have your reservations about resuming your duties, but I must ask why you have never brought them up before."\n\nOiren thought about her reply for a moment, then nodded. "It would be a lie to claim I never thought about it, but the times never really felt right. Rapid changes combined with war after war never gave our people the opportunity to catch a breath. I've always felt yet another change of rulership might have only made hectic times downright chaotic."\n\nSlána smirked. "I understand all that perfectly well, but it does not answer my question. Oiren, we both know our country might not earn its rest for a while still, and that the ideal time might never come." Oiren grimaced, unable to hold Slána's gaze. "Thus, allow me to rephrase my question. Oiren, are you afraid of ruling?"\n\n"I..." Oiren sighed. "The truth is, I... I don't know if I am ready, and I don't know how close I am. You've taught me so much, and I have come a long way, but there is still so much to learn. I didn't want to admit it. I think I was —still am— afraid of appearing incompetent."\n\nSlána's eyes hardened. "That was my worry, yes. If you are not ready after everything you have learned, then I believe you will never be ready." Oiren opened her mouth but only ended up staring at the floor. After a moment, she felt Slána's hoof lift her chin, and to her surprise, she found the Sunderer smiling down at her. "However, the true question is whether or not you are ready. I well and truly believe that you are, but I shall not impose my view upon you. So tell me, Oiren: will you rule?\n\nOiren sighed, furrowing her brow, but it only took a moment for the answer to bubble up between the questions and doubts."

 greneclyf_sunderer_flavour.1.t:0 "Night Maritime Patrol"
 greneclyf_sunderer_flavour.1.d:0 "Aidan was irradiant with energy. Nighttime was never much of a hindrance for a changeling, but ever since harnessing the execrate from the local prisoner, his sight seemed to pierce even the thickest veil that the night brought. Such eagle-eyed vision was necessary for his current task as the primary observer of the third anti-aircraft gun of his destroyer. If Aidan did his job well, he'd spot an enemy aircraft well before it made itself heard.\n\nAs the ship went underway, he perked up once he spotted a black shape up high. He quickly brought his binoculars up, and sure enough, he recognised the fuselage, the kind typical of a medium bomber. Without hesitation, he mechanically barked, "Bomber, four o'clock! Two and a half kilometres!"\n\nImmediately, the gun crew sprang to motion. Aidan's fellow observer confirmed the target, and the operators got to work. The 37mm double-barreled gun swivelled in the given direction, and the barrels rose to meet the oncoming target. Shouts from other gun crews seemed to partly indicate confusion and surprise, but Aidan paid no heed; he was simply waiting for the target to come into range before ordering the gunner to open fire. Just a few more seconds and...\n\n"Hold fire!" the director yelled. "Hold your fire!"\n\nAnger welled up in Aidan's throat. Just as he was about to argue against his superior, he was instead met by a wrath even greater than his behind the director's scowl. "That's a civilian airliner, leading sealing!" He growled. "You almost opened fire on one of our own!"\n\nAidan's breath hitched. Looking again at the aircraft overhead through his binoculars, he spotted the Greneclyfian colours on the tail. They were so evident now... How had he not spotted them earlier?\n\n"I'll have your damned wings for breakfast, Sealing Aidan," the director said, seething with irritation. Suddenly feeling very sheepish, Aidan mumbled an apology, cursing himself. The wrath had dissipated slightly, and he could only wonder what other intrusive thoughts could lead him astray if he was not careful..."

While her eyes bore dark rings, her calm smile betrayed no weariness. "Oh, good evening, Slána. I was going to take an early leave today. If you would give me five minutes, we can go on a walk."\n\nThe Sunderer shook her head. "No need. I merely came to congratulate you. Your progress has vastly exceeded my expectations, and you have proven competent enough to count amongst the great queens of history, at least in my eyes." She chuckled. "Though I suppose you should learn to lean upon others when possible."\n\nOiren's mild embarrassment quickly melted away as the words began to sink in. She'd done it. She'd succeeded where two queens before her had failed. Not only that, but she'd also impressed the Sunderer herself. "Wow. Thank you."\n\nSlána smiled. "'Tis nothing, at least compared to your feats." With these words, she excused herself, leaving Oiren to stare at the closed door. It had cost a lot of effort and energy, but she had well and truly done it."

 NCH_nazism_desc:0 "A curious form of autocracy, the current situation implies that a living god is leading the country. Where the normal bureaucratic processes and institutional administrative procedures would at least be a nominal check on a leader's powers, the sheer willingness to defer all matters of state to the Sunderer makes the state an "adherent" autocracy and gives the Sunderer unchecked powers. All aspects of changeling society are so monolithic in this consensual conformity to the Sunderer that there is no such thing as a changeling opposition, much to her surprise.\n\nEffectively, the only opposition is borne from non-changelings as they are seen as the only possible threat to the state. However, compliance and adherence to the societal condition ensure a safe and prosperous place in this society of changeling primacy, promising an odd militarised utopia where not all are equal in status but can all live happy lives."

 ### NEWS EVENTS ###
 greneclyf_news.0.t:0 "The Coronation of the Greneclyfian Queen"
 greneclyf_news.0.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The highly-anticipated coronation ceremony has finally come, and Queen Gytha, daughter of Queen Nóra Mhic, was officially ordained as the successor to the Greneclyfian throne.\n\nThe coronation comes three weeks since the sudden and unexpected passing of the former Queen. In many ways, it is a seal to approve Queen Gytha's position that she had taken upon herself immediately upon her mother's absence. Some worry that the Queen's inexperience may worsen current tensions in the country, but the initial reaction of the populace has been one of relief and of hope.\n\nFor now, a sense of normalcy has returned upon the island."
 greneclyf_news.0.a:0 "Long may she reign!"

 greneclyf_news.0.d1:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]After weeks of confusion in Greneclyf following the sudden death of Queen Nóra Mhic, the former Queen's daughter Gytha has subsequently been fully ordained as Greneclyf's newest Queen.\n\nChief Cenhelm sent a congratulatory message to the Queen with tacit support to continue the Great Pacts. Most believe it to be primarily a formality. Still, some believe that Cenhelm, having offered support to Gytha during the Greneclyfians' time of crisis, might intend to pursue a closening of ties between our two nations.\n\nIn the meantime, most Farbrookians are glad to see our neighbours have overcome this difficult period of national strife."
 greneclyf_news.0.b:0 "We wish Queen Gytha luck in her endeavours."

 greneclyf_news.0.d2:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The news of Queen Gytha's coronation broke the silence from the island of Greneclyf following the sudden cessation of regular communication. It turns out that the previous queen, Nóra Mhic, had passed after some turmoil in the country.\n\nQueen Gytha has sent a communiqué temporarily abstaining from the duty of Protector of the Hillpony Tribes that her predecessor had taken on. Meanwhile, Farbrook has sent its well-wishes to the changelings, suggesting that they are open to closening ties between Greneclyf and the Hillpony region.\n\nFor the most part, our citizens seem to be hopeful that a stable Greneclyf will keep the region safe."
 greneclyf_news.0.c:0 "Though Farbrook does not speak for us all, we wish Greneclyf well."
 greneclyf_news.0.e:0 "Between a strong Greneclyf and Arcturian Order, peace shall endure."

 greneclyf_news.0.d3:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]We have received news by dispatch that the Greneclyfian Queendom has suffered through a period of unrest with the death of Queen Nóra Mhic. Subsequently, Queen Gytha, daughter of the previous queen, has ruled over the island and was only coronated recently.\n\nWe've also learnt that the Queendom's naval aspirations were dashed with the arrival of the new warships from Skyfall. The vessels in question proved to be costly and ultimately pointless, as they are utterly obsolete. Reports of a discontinued naval programme assuaged all concerns from members of our admiralty of a potential maritime rival."
 greneclyf_news.0.f:0 "Queen Nóra may have been playing with fire, but she didn't deserve such an end."

 greneclyf_news.0.d4:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]For some time, Greneclyf has been going through a state of national confusion with the death of Queen Nóra Mhic. Though her daughter, Queen Gytha, has taken charge almost immediately though has only now been anointed as the rightful ruler. The first message from the new Queen has been one for continued peace among our countries and a closening of ties between our peoples.\n\nThough the reaction from our citizens has been relatively muted, the few Greneclyfian changelings living within our borders have expressed relief over the resolution of the crisis in Greneclyf and hope for the future."
 greneclyf_news.0.g:0 "So the pack of bugs has a new alpha."
 greneclyf_news.0.h:0 "Good. Maybe now the changelings will stop whining."
 greneclyf_news.0.i:0 "Perhaps we could have done more for the Greneclyfians?"
 greneclyf_news.0.j:0 "I wonder how the new Queen will handle her mother's mess..."
 greneclyf_news.0.k:0 "Let us see the strength of the new Queen."
 greneclyf_news.0.l:0 "We shall look on with anticipation."
 greneclyf_news.0.m:0 "What will this new Queen bring to the table?"

 greneclyf_news.0.d5:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Word from the Hillpony tribes has come regaling the news that Queen Gytha, daughter of the Greneclyfian Queen Nóra Mhic, was anointed as the new monarch of Greneclyf.\n\nWith this news, we have also learned that the previous Queen had suddenly died, leading to several days of national confusion following public unrest.\n\nAs far as we can tell, the situation on the island has stabilised for the foreseeable future."
 greneclyf_news.0.n:0 "Business as usual, then?"

 greneclyf_news.0.d6:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Surprising news from the remote island of Greneclyf has reached Magehold. It appears that a new Queen has ascended the throne following a period of modernisation on the island. The last time anything of note happened with Greneclyf was the ill-fated expedition of Fidelis Maledictus, whose group disappeared without trace centuries ago.\n\nWe have also learned that the changelings have previously taken the role of protecting the Hillpony lands. However, this currently does not seem to be the case.\n\nRegardless, we may need to pay closer attention to further developments."
 greneclyf_news.0.o:0 "Where Fidelis failed, we'll succeed."

 
 ### STARTING CORONATION EVENTS ###
 greneclyf_start.0.t:0 "An Evening in Blosmport"
 greneclyf_start.0.d:0 "Things had since calmed down when Queen Nóra Mhic's corpse was recovered from Blosmport's newest canal. Though not all was truly well, at least Greneclyfians were not panicking over the existential threat of a leadership vacuum. There was a queen back on the throne, even if it was an uncrowned and young daughter. Despite all of her efforts to stabilise a nation in crisis, however, Gytha was still not seen as the 'true' Queen of Greneclyf. For nearly three weeks, the tradition was sidelined, but now the young queen could finally look forward to being coronated.\n\nUpon Gytha's desk was a mess of official reports and documents detailing the situation of the nation. Just a week prior, they told of a crisis; two weeks before, they seemed to herald an apocalypse, and Gytha barely knew what to do. Fortunately, she wasn't alone back then, and she wasn't now. A smile played on her lips as she looked upon Feilean, her older brother, mused thoughtfully over a document.\n\n"Sclerite and his CPM supporters have agreed to end their marches, despite his attack dog's calls for further action in Bugsmere and the capital." Feilean's eyes were heavy and yet alert all the same. They met Gytha's. "There's nothing else in the way, Gytha."\n\nGytha looked on hopefully. "Does that mean that we can finally proceed?" she asked tentatively.\n\n"It does," Feilean replied with a sharp nod. "The coronation can go ahead." He smiled softly as his sister slackened visibly in her seat. "There are still a few matters to go over, of course, but the remaining legwork now is straightforward."\n\nThe Queen sat up straighter, her breath hitching slightly at the thought of further delays. "What do I need to do?"\n\n"You?" Feilean asked with a raised eyebrow. When Gytha nodded, he chuckled. "Besides practising and making the official invitations, you may rest, Gytha dearest."\n\nGytha blinked. Was that it?"
 greneclyf_start.0.a:0 ""Perhaps I could do with some sleep...""

 greneclyf_start.1.t:0 "The Crowning of the New Queen"
 greneclyf_start.1.d:0 "It was grandiose: the chamber glittered with lights; royals and respected drones from all walks of life observed in quiet respect; the throne, spotless and immaculate, awaited its new occupant. Awaiting her was the throne and two old, withered-looking drones standing in between. The one on the left held the jewelled crown and the other a ceremonial urn. Much like Gytha, they wore simple, almost ragged white garbs. Theirs were somewhat more pristine than hers, but that was as it should be, for she would become, as tradition dictated, the newest representative of the Sunderer. As the praise singers ended their song, Gytha stopped short and knelt well below the two drones, eyes cast downwards.\n\nThe one on the right spoke first in a voice aged by decades. "Is Your Majesty willing to take the Oath?"\n\n"I am willing," Gytha responded solemnly.\n\n"Will you maintain and preserve unwaveringly?"\n\nGytha closed her eyes in respect and in anticipation. "I shall," she responded. Wordlessly, she felt a gentle hoof softly running along her horn as a coat of ash trailed behind the drone's touch.\n\n"Be your horn, anointed, with the Sunderer's form," enunciated the elderly drone as she finished her ritual. "As queens past were, so shall you, blessed and consecrated, be Queen over the peoples, in the name of Slána the Sunderer."\n\nPlaced upon Gytha's head was a silver circlet crown, and she finally rose to see both drones standing aside for her to take the throne. Gytha did her best not to think about what had happened to its previous occupant. Slowly, gingerly, she took her seat and beheld the chamber with as much authority as she could muster. Gytha recognised some faces from the crowd: her smiling brother, a neutral Queen Oiren, even Queen Cait Murchbagh and Dragon Snowy in their resplendent uniforms.\n\nAfter a pause and a short breath, the Queen of Greneclyf tilted her head upwards and spoke loud enough to create an echo:"
 greneclyf_start.1.a:0 ""Praise be to Greneclyf and to thee!""

 greneclyf_start.2.t:0 "Seeing to the CPM"
 greneclyf_start.2.d:0 "The coronation ceremony had barely finished when Queen Gytha and Feilean were once more in her office. The first order of business was a letter from the CPM, though that was to be expected.\n\n"What does it say?" Gytha asked her brother, though she suspected she already knew its contents.\n\n"They would like to know the Crown's plans now that we have an ordained queen back on the throne." Feilean's green eyes looked up from the letter. "There's particular emphasis on when these plans are meant to take effect."\n\nGytha nodded once. As her gaze wandered, she recalled the demands Sclerite and his party had demanded upon the Queen when her mother's corpse was still dripping wet.\n\nBanishing that morbid thought, she looked to Feilean. "Have you thought over what we've discussed before?"\n\n"I have," Feilean replied, offering her a smile, "and though there are some details to iron out, it's easily the best way forward, Gytha."\n\nGytha let out a slow breath. "Pass me a pen.""
 greneclyf_start.2.a:0 ""You may also want some coffee, Gytha. We'll be here for a while.""

 greneclyf_start.3.t:0 "The Letter from the Queen"
 greneclyf_start.3.d:0 "A hoof ran down Fennore's face. "For my sake, Cader," she said, speaking with an irritated grumble. "Go over what she wrote once more, and in simpler terms."\n\nStanding above Fennore and Eolan, Cader grimaced, peeved, before setting aside the letter in his magical grip. "The Queen wants to confer with the River Coalition nations to secure new treaties to protect Greneclyfian nationals and gain new financial ties."\n\n"How? By askin' them nicely?" Fennore blurted out, standing up from her seat. Before Cader could respond, she continued: "That'd be a sight! Our dope of a queen crawlin' to the dogs, or—" she laughed harshly "—or perhaps the Bakarans, askin' 'pretty please?' Does she really think it's as simple as that?" She looked to her companions for an answer. Eolan sat quietly, his expression betraying nothing but exhaustion. Cader's grimace, meanwhile, deepened.\n\n"I don't know how she'll do it," he admitted, "but she may know something we don't. She might well be able."\n\nFennore barked out a hollow laugh. "And pray tell, did she say when she thinks she'd achieve all o' this?"\n\n"The Queen believes that this can be done by the year, and—"\n\n"To Tartarus with that!" she stomped a hoof. "This won't work!"\n\nA tense silence followed as both Cader and Fennore stared each other down.\n\n"It just might," came the weathered voice of Eolan. As his two colleagues turned to him, he added, "Queen Nóra Mhic never tried to speak to the Coltstream properly, and they have been experiencing a period of economic growth." His eyes gleamed brightly behind his glasses. "It could work.""
 greneclyf_start.3.a:0 "Fennore stared back incredulously."

 greneclyf_start.4.t:0 "The Letter from the Queen"
 greneclyf_start.4.d:0 ""Are you bleedin' insane?" Fennore approached Eolan, raising her voice. "You can't trust the continentals to treat us right, let alone give us the time o' day to help us out!"\n\nThe elderly drone merely narrowed his eyes. "I didn't say that it'd be easy,  Ó Cuanáin," he said, his tone calm yet terse. "I am simply saying that should the Queen achieve it, it would dig the country out of its spiral."\n\n"In a year?" Fennore pointedly asked. "Most Greneclyfians can't afford to wait a year! We've made a promise to our people, and we must keep the Crown accountable!" She turned to face Cader. "She won't be able to do it."\n\nSclerite, for his part, only approached Fennore and placed a placating hoof on her shoulder. Her breathing quieted, and their eyes met. After a long moment, Cader spoke.\n\n"I understand, Fennie. I genuinely do. I haven't forgotten what you've suffered through in Bakara." Fennore's lips thinned at Cader's words as he continued. "The Queen's barely taken her mother's place. She's far more sincere in her attempts, even if she's inexperienced. We need to give her a chance. If she doesn't hold to her word..."\n\nHe shrugged, offering a small smile. "We'll manage it. I'm willing to give Queen Gytha a shot." Fennore tilted his head to Eolan. "So is Eolan. Are you ready to do the same?"\n\nFennore fell silent, mulling it over. She scowled and furrowed her brow before she gave a single, firm nod."
 greneclyf_start.4.a:0 ""Alright, I will. But only because I trust you, Cader.""

 greneclyf_start.5.t:0 "Tableside Breakfast News"
 greneclyf_start.5.d:0 "It was all over the front of the morning newspaper in bold font to catch the passing eyes. However, the centred sketch of a horribly bruised changeling drone chained to the ground and surrounded by sneering Bakaran police was guaranteed to draw in readers.\n\nGRENECLYFIAN DETAINED FOR ALLEGED MURDER!\n\nThe newspaper shook in Gytha's grip. She could but feel as if she was the one who had received the beatings so vividly captured in the headlines. This wasn't a 'detainment' at all. This was one of her subjects being brutalised by Bakaran police, their snarling grins showing to all their gleeful discrimination as they pummeled the accused drone. Nocreature deserved to be treated this way, especially not one that was here subject!\n\nHer brother's arrival at the breakfast table right then was perfect timing. "Feilean, have you seen this?" Gytha all but tossed the newspaper to him. "We mustn't allow this to happen again. Assemble our lawmakers, we need to implement safeguards and statutes—"\n\n"That would then be ignored by every country but ours," Feilean interrupted with a grimace, sighing when seeing his sister's glare. "Gytha, we can't afford to react impulsively. Not when our plan is set and about to go underway, which, I assure you, will be the best way to handle these issues there than our authority ever could."\n\nThe angry Queen's glare slowly wilted, and she accepted her brother's words with deafening silence as they ate their breakfast. Feilean courteously flipped the newspaper over with a spell to hide its provoking imagery, but throughout their meal, Gytha's mind lingered on the rendered drawing"
 greneclyf_start.5.a:0 "Which was stronger? A Queen's wrath, or heavily armed prejudice?"

 greneclyf_start.6.t:0 "The Coronation from the East"
 greneclyf_start.6.d:0 "Queen Chrysalis hummed in curious thought. She was about to finish reading today's Der Jäger edition when she spotted an eye-catching article titled: "CORONATION OF GRENECLYFIAN QUEEN". It took her a moment to recall which country this was, and when Chrysalis read the article in more detail, it came back to her.\n\nIt was the pathetic little island of changelings far in the East, off the eastern shores of Griffonia, who adhered to the nonsensical notions of harmony. Odd, since when had the previous Greneclyfian Queen died?\n\nThe answer was in the article, and Chrysalis had to let out a laugh. She killed herself in shame? What a joke! What a weakling! And now her 23-year-old daughter was 'elected' as Queen? Again, Chrysalis couldn't contain her laughter at the absurdity of putting a mewling nymph on the throne, by vote, no less!\n\nAs her laughs died down, the Queen mused on this. The last time she had received a communique from Greneclyf, it was a condemnation of her attack on Canterlot. She hadn't given much thought since she had many things occupying her mind. Perhaps now, this was an opportune moment to return the favour. It would be an amusing break from all the day's work that Chrysalis had to sort through."
 greneclyf_start.6.a:0 "She chose to call for a pen and an interpeter. Chrysalis had many 'compliments' to make..."
 greneclyf_start.6.b:0 "As cathartic as that would be, Chrysalis elected to focus on her work instead."

 greneclyf_start.7.t:0 "Queen Chrysalis's Letter"
 greneclyf_start.7.d:0 ""That witch of a Queen! That utter brute!" Gytha's furious pacing resounded loudly with the pounding of her hooves upon the office floor. "How dare that fiend Chrysalis besmirch my name or that of our mother, Feilean!?" she asked as she glared at the accursed letter that Feilean was reading.\n\nIn stark contrast to his younger sister's stormy mood, Feilean's was stone-faced, but Gytha, even in her rage, could taste his silent anger. "Chrysalis's words are nothing but that, Gytha," he said as he put down the communique from Chrysalis. "She is, as Mother used to say, nothing more than a savage lout who thinks of little else other than war and pettiness."\n\nFeilean's quiet voice irked Gytha. "This can't stand, Feilean!" She stomped her hoof. "We must respond to this. At once!"\n\nHer brother's eyes met hers, and he scowled slightly. A moment later, he said, "There's little point in issuing a diplomatic protest, but I believe we could—"\n\n"Boycott their goods," Gytha said suddenly. At Feilean's piqued eyebrows, she added, "No trade shall occur between Greneclyf and Chrysalis's lands so long as she is in power. It may not mean much to her, but our people must be reminded that the changelings over in Equus are no friends of ours despite our similarities."\n\nAfter a pregnant pause, Feilean bowed his head. "It will be done.""
 greneclyf_start.7.a:0 "No one can make light of the death of a loved one, not even a Queen!"

 greneclyf_start.8.t:0 "Greneclyf Embargoed Us"
 greneclyf_start.8.d:0 ""My Queen, there is a communique for you," a drone declared softly.\n\nQueen Chrysalis didn't bother to raise her eyes from the documents before her. "From whom and what does it say?" she asked, bored.\n\n"From the Greneclyfian Crown." Chrysalis's ears perked up at that response, and she looked up. "It is a declaration stating that the Greneclyfian state has prohibited any and all trade between our two nations and has closed their borders to us."\n\nChrysalis waited, expecting more from the communique. She leaned closer when nothing else came. "Is that all?"\n\n"There are a few veiled jabs at our country and you, my Queen, but nothing that merits your attention."\n\nShe nodded slowly. "And we don't import anything from Greneclyf, right?" When the drone shook his head no, Chrysalis nodded again and returned to her documents. "Very well. No further actions are to be taken against them for now."\n\nThe drone bowed and promptly left, leaving Chrysalis in her mound of work. She chuckled softly at the image of the Greneclyfian Queen wailing in frustration just because of a few written words about her dead mother."
 greneclyf_start.8.a:0 ""What a petulant child.""

 greneclyf_start.9.t:0 "Queen Gytha's Birthday"
 greneclyf_start.9.d:0 "The 10th of January had arrived with the dedicated holiday in full swing since dawn, and many a changeling from hive and countryside had swarmed to Blosmport: the hosting city for the national celebration. Throughout the royal palace grounds, Greneclyf's colours fluttered to the fanfare of young changelings, who buzzed playfully about the halls of chatter from the older ones drinking. Sweet melodies playing from the little orchestra of flutes, violins, harps, and soft drums gave everything a pleasant regality to the whole affair, and the annual celebration of traditions old was embraced by everyone—everyone but the one changeling it all was dedicated for.\n\nGytha poured her eyes over yet another missive reporting information collected from the Riverlands. The Queen wanted to spare no big or small detail in her approach for Greneclyf befriending the mainland. So arduously caught up in her planning, Gytha hadn't even noticed her brother's entry into her bedroom until he closed the door, but even then, she merely acknowledged him with only a glance.\n\n"Gytha, you've been in here all morning," Feilean said. "It's nearly noon, and Greneclyf's Queen has yet to appear at her own birthday festival."\n\n"There'll be another one next year." Gytha huffed. "What there won't be is another chance for us to make an official first impression with the Riverland governments.""\n\nFeilean withheld a sigh and approached. "More reason to go out there, if anything. Don't you think the experience of mingling and having fun with others would help your chances of making a friend of the Riverlands?" Gytha opened her mouth to respond to his words, but her eyes widened, and she creased her lips shut. Feilean watched her silently sit, mulling to herself, smiling at last when he saw Gytha slowly leave her desk. Happily, he held the door open for her, and Gytha hesitantly followed Feilean to her birthday festival.\n\n"Everyone deserves to at least enjoy themselves on their birthday.""
 greneclyf_start.9.a:0 "And enjoy it she did."

 greneclyf_start.10.t:0 "Lá an Tearmann" #Day of Refuge
 greneclyf_start.10.d:0 "Given how dark some wintery days could get, it came to no one's surprise that solace could be found in the most unusual of places with the most peculiar of people. Nothing embodied this more in the northern reaches of the world than the annually honoured Anniversary of the Frozen Refuge, where all on Greneclyf commemorated the wonderful day when the hives of yore were given love by mainlanders; the Farbrookian hillponies, to be exact. All from far and near were welcomed to the anniversary's celebrations on the island in the spirit of sharing and caring in the dark north, though few other than the hillponies ever partook.\n\nSuch lovely celebrations tended to take place in the lighted harbour areas of Blosmport, where the mainlanders could immediately be swamped by the festive changelings upon arrival. Yet even with the music and drinks aplenty, everycreature could feel the unspoken apprehension nipping in the frigid air, thanks to the Queen's proclamation of officially reaching out to the Riverlands.\n\n"Sure hope the Queen knows what she's doing," a changeling drone said before gulping his shot of love-infused whiskey. His two other drinking companions seated next to him nodded.\n\nThe hillpony slugged the large shoulder beside her with a hoof. "Care to wager the odds?"\n\n"Hrmgh," the last of the trio muttered. "I left Diamond Mountain for a reason." He drank a long sip from the glass in his paw, and the three resumed the silence. Being sailors, they each had some familiarity with the Riverland nations, and all three knew just how challenging they could be. The River Coalition barely held as is, in spite of its growing dysfunctions, and now the island was aiming to open up to it. Everything of the future, their own livelihoods, was... dangerously uncertain.\n\nThe three of them continued sitting at the bar in ruminating silence until the diamond dog chuffed and raised his glass to them. The changeling drone and hillpony stirred from their stupors and joined the toast."
 greneclyf_start.10.a:0 "They continued drinking, contemplative, but contented."

 ### SPY GAME EVENTS ###
 greneclyf_spy_game.0.t:0 "An Unexpected Offer"
 greneclyf_spy_game.0.d:0 ""What is this about, Feilean? It's the middle of the night." Gytha only received a brief assurance from her brother, who led them both into the throne hall. All was serenely quiet at this late hour, but the Queen soon noticed in the nearly too peaceful room that no other changeling was present. No sentry on guard nor bureaucrat in sight. It was only herself, her brother... and the lone changeling drone in a striking yellow dress sitting in wait before the throne. Whatever was happening, it was clearly meant to occur in secret.\n\n"Your Highness." The changeling bowed courteously, her voice respectful and humble. Gytha returned the greeting, looking to her brother for an explanation.\n\nFeilean was prompt. "This is Cara, the head of the Greneclyfian Cartographers' Society. They wish to offer their assistance with our efforts in the Riverlands." The simple explanation only brought about more questions.\n\n"Our cartographers have accumulated much understanding of the Riverland nations, as well as others across the continent," Cara explained, "and with official approval and funds, the Greneclyfian Cartographers' Society is more than ready to offer its resources as an agency to aid in your outreach efforts and guarantee the results desired."\n\n"Subterfuge," Gytha said, her voice gaining an edge. "You wish me to approve going against my clann's philosophy for changelings' innate abilities. Why should I consider even approving this?"\n\nCara's smile remained, but her eyes hinted at something else. "Unfavourable circumstances and a rise of dangerous situations all over the continent have unfortunately made it necessary. I tell you this with truth, my Queen, and the truth is that there are dire times ahead for Greneclyf. The direction you wish for our homeland to take is noble and what I and all in our organisation support in full, but few in the Riverlands trust Greneclyf as is. Without some sort of guarantee, it is too likely that Greneclyf's efforts for friendship will be rebuked if not outright taken advantage of."\n\nThe seriousness in Cara's words continued to puncture the silence in the throne hall, only backed further by Feilean's sigh and resigned nod. Moments passed as Gytha thought everything over and through until she finally made her decision known."

 greneclyf_spy_game.1.t:0 "A Visit to Bugsmere"
 greneclyf_spy_game.1.d:0 "Deep within the hive of Bugsmere amid its historical district, Feilean entered a museum undergoing rapid transformation, doing well to avoid obstructing the flow of drones working. He would have an accessible report to Gytha confirming the funds were being used correctly from the intensity he saw. However, the royal was still amazed by the rate of progress they were managing in such a place filled with ancient artefacts and incredibly delicate trinkets.\n\n"It seems everything is to your liking so far." Cara joined his side and observed the ongoing reconstruction, her yellow dress as refined as before. "I must again express the gratitude of the Greneclyfian Cartographers' Society for both you and Queen Gytha agreeing to this. Additional facilities and materials here will help us considerably with achieving Greneclyf's ambitions."\n\nFeilean inspected a nearby glass case containing an artefact. "Yes, though it is rather peculiar for cartographers wanting to involve themselves with national security..." His irises inquisitively glanced over to the changeling beside him, who continued watching the construction.\n\nCara's demeanour didn't change in the slightest. "The average Greneclyfian does not need to be part of our Society to see the dangerous changes arising in the Riverlands, though being some of the most observant and meticulous in the field of cartography does make change all the more noticeable to us."\n\n"I see," Feilean said with a hum. "I suppose there's a strong amount of irony in the idea of Greneclyf being thankful for whatever had driven its best mappers toward this endeavour, though." He could've sworn he had almost heard something akin to a laugh quickly smothered behind her quaint smile and words.\n\n"One could interpret it that way, but the more accurate truth is that the Greneclyfian Cartographers' Society admittedly has a very long memory thanks to the history it collects, and the island has shown a repeated past of struggles whenever it has reached out."\n\nFeilean turned back to the artefact he had been inspecting before: a beyond-weathered carving fragment depicting a dressed changeling playing with what appeared to be breezies. With another hum, he stowed his curiosity and simply monitored the construction with Cara."

 greneclyf_spy_game.2.d:0 "Gytha was finally given a grand tour of the institution, impressively remodelled to serve as the fully transformed Greneclyfian Cartographers' Society headquarters. The GCS and all of its members now served as an official agency on behalf of the state, and the renovations certainly did show for it. She and her brother had received the invitation to tour the finished work, which had brought her to Cara, who graciously showed them every passage and area that had been built, publicly and secretly.\n\nThough even as their guide introduced her to the many GCS agents that would be operating, Gytha still couldn't shake off the gut feeling of how wrong everything felt. The ideas of subterfuge, the manipulation training, the infiltration methods for each country, and the plans to guarantee acceptance —especially the programs to guarantee acceptance— all felt wrong. The Queen managed to press through the tour with the best etiquette she could muster, but when it was just Cara, Feilean, and herself that remained in the public hall, Gytha made her distaste known with a heavy sigh and groan.\n\n"We are doing this for Greneclyf," her brother assured her.\n\n"Yes, but it still feels disingenuous. We are building the future of our homeland upon our broken principles."\n\n"Rest assured, my Queen, the GCS will do everything it can within its power to abide by your wishes," Cara added. "I can promise that I and the operatives I introduced today are more than skilled enough to accomplish their missions without crossing more unethical boundaries."\n\nHer reservations still held, but Cara's words did help. Gytha took a deep breath and composed herself."

 greneclyf_spy_game.3.d:0 "The Queen's words caused Feilean to shift his posture in slight surprise. Cara distantly sighed and regarded the decision. "Are you sure about this?"\n\n"Yes, our relationships in the Riverlands must be built upon love, not deception," Gytha said. Uncertainty of the future thrummed all about her decision, but the core of her principles taught by her clan's doctrine held and gave her conviction. "I won't have Greneclyfians' intent for genuine friendship betrayed by manipulations." She glanced down at her brother sharply. "That you'd even considered this..."\n\nFeilean flickered his wings and brought himself to eye level. "I considered this because of your wish for an authentic friendship, Gytha. The honesty and truth in our outreach could amount to nothing if the Riverlands simply reject it."\n\nA forced cough interrupted the argument, bringing Feilean back to the ground and drawing Gytha away from her sudden fears. Cara straightened her yellow dress and gave them a curtsy. "The morning will be here soon. I shall respect your decision, your Highness, but you can rest assured knowing that the Greneclyfian Cartographers' Society will always lend its assistance when needed."\n\nGytha paused before tacitly thanking the cryptic changeling, who, in turn, smiled and departed, leaving the Queen, her brother, and the fate of Greneclyf's principled efforts to chance. A long silence passed in the hall before Gytha breathed a shaky sigh, earning a gentle hoof from Feilean on her shoulder."

Her conviction only grew as the memory of reading about that poor Greneclyfian returned in force. She nodded resolutely.\n\nThe drone held her pose for a moment longer before curtsying. "Remember," Cara offered, "my services and those of the GCS are always available, your Highness."\n\nBy the time she had left, Feilean had quirked an eyebrow. "What was that about a different idea?" His tone had gained a worrisome edge.\n\n"I've changed my mind," Gytha stated, forcefully keeping her cool. "We'll do what we should have done far earlier."\n\n"The protections thing?" Feilean's voice grew terse. At her nod, he almost snarled. "I already told you that will do nothing to help our people!"\n\nA loud, reverberating hoof stomp clamped up Feilean. He was about to argue when he tasted the grief emanating from the Queen. Voice cracking, she exclaimed, "I am! And I can't believe it took me hearing about plans to infiltrate the Riverlands to realise it!" Gytha's glare intently bore into her brother. "I will set things right, as per our clan's teachings, Feilean."\n\nOnce she stormed off, Feilean was left alone, nearly speechless."

Initial contact yielded confirmation of pro-Greneclyf sentiment among the populace, accredited to the withstanding historic friendship between our nations.\n\nSigns of negative opinions towards Greneclyf are few. Such opinions held by locals in positions of authority are fewer still; these targets are aware of the possible public outcry associated with anti-Greneclyf policy proposal. This matches expectations drawn from preliminary investigations.\n\nIt is of the opinion of the primary handlers that no further resource allocation is required. Relations between Greneclyf and Farbrook remain strong, as previously believed by most GCS heads.\n\nOf note: a GCS operative has formed an intimate relationship with a local.

Agents have submitted reports detailing effects. Injustices sustained by immigrants from Greneclyf have been highlighted until now and continue to be covered by Bakaran mass media.\n\nAs of now, credible polling sources and first-hoof observations stress an immensely positive reception from the majority of the Bakaran electorate to these societies and their actions. Note that the non-aligned BSP and incumbent SDH as major parties are adjusting the tone and language of their platforms in response. Expect sympathetic party members and leaders to pay closer attention to this change; they are likely to maintain the new course and both local assets and agents advise continued support of these individuals.

Fear of criticising Rover Diamondshield is noted as the primary reason for this failure. However, some level of progress in spreading the word to the slaves has been observed.\n\nAppeals to egalitarian ideals promoting the fairer treatment of foreigners, including changelings, may be trickling down to them. However, this could lead to slave riots, but other operatives suggest this is unlikely to occur. Yet handlers present in this sector observed increased worry about the King among slave drivers and masters and they have concerns about possible action which may be perceived as hostile to foreigners.\n\nGeneral conclusion is in favour of conducting more activities to prime Diamond Mountain for Greneclyfian diplomatic envoys and encourage greater chances of trade deal acceptance. Secondary recommendation is to maintain observations of slave activities."

For whatever reason, Deponians have an untangible connection with the arachnids that is akin to guard dogs with owners, but far more dangerous to strangers. The former can sense if their pony companions are not who they really are, and this had led to a number of close-calls where agents had to flee or abort their missions. After some brainstorming, however, agents found that they could avoid the guard spiders by presenting themselves as foreign travelling merchants, then embed into communities as different ponies. Despite the initial difficulty, the handlers were able to gain enough local assets to spread via word of mouth the opportunity of changelings coming to the country. Assessment by on-the-ground assets show that the mostly isolated forest ponies are receptive to the notion and will spread that willingness to accept Greneclyfians to the local authorities and further up"

But before they would leave their homeland, a rousing speech from Gytha moved many in the crowds —and more than a few of the crews— to joyful tears and yet another ovation. After a lavish ceremony, all eyes focused upon the vessels as they left port waters one by one. Horns blew as they slipped their moorings, their sailors and passengers looking out to those at port. Fathers, mothers, sons, daughters, and loved ones shouted to one another their farewells and best wishes. Queen Gytha observed them, and her heart felt a pang of worry, her mind no longer aligned with the joyful, hopeful atmosphere all around her. Though she dared not weep nor return to her palace, the memory of her mother made it difficult for the Queen to keep lingering in the open.\n\nWe can expect some of them to return within a few weeks, whereas the others will take far longer to bring back a response. Regardless, we will be waiting for their return with gleeful anticipation. We only pray that they not only come back safely but also bring good news to our homes."

This in it of itself was strange, as traffic from the isle is usually no more than a few fishing vessels, but the fact that many political and governmental representatives were onboard was telling. Port authorities were immediately approached by these Greneclyfians, requesting an immediate audience with [Root.GetLeader].\n\nThe head delegate, speaking in Queen Gytha's name, has informed us of a shift in Greneclyf's policy regarding the treatment of its citizens over on the continent. Most of their concerns aren't directed to Farbrook itself, however they are asking for a concentrated effort on our path to ensure equal treatment of changelings under the guise of a trade deal, in the hopes to set a friendly tone abroad in the River Coalition.\n\nThough some of the long-term objectives are somewhat ambitious, the short-term goal to enrichen our currently stale trade is a very realistic one, and Farbrookians already consider their Greneclyfian neighbours as equals.\n\nThe Greneclyfian diplomat stands before you, waiting for your response."

Our representative will keep asking for their response, but we can expect this to take, at best, within one or two months. At worst, it is very likely that they may reject our requests.\n\nNevertheless, this has reached the sensitive ears of the public and has attracted great shock and debate. Where there were only a dozen mildly worried questions, there now is an almost never ending stream of anxious and fearful questions all focused on why Farbrook was giving Greneclyf such an answer. Of course, no greater level of shock could be found in any other place on the island except within the Palace.\n\nComments were asked of Queen Gytha, but Her Majesty's staff shooed away the press. For now, the Palace would witness important 'lings come over to have an audience with the Queen. But for every other creature on the island, there was only one question in mind."

Reports are mixed, but what is certain is that a Bakaran is dead, and our citizen was found using their form as a disguise.\n\nWhile witnesses (of which none were present at the moment of the alleged crime) claim that the changeling had purposefully murdered a pony to assume their form and begin a murder spree, the accused said that they had acted in self defense, and that they had taken over their form in a panic upon realising that the aggressor was dead.\n\nIn either case, there is considerable revanchism on the side of Bakara calling for the head of our merchant. Where do we officially stand on this matter?"
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.3.d_DMT:0 "Grave news from Dit-Kazaar on the continent: a Greneclyfian citizen is currently incarcerated awaiting trial for murder.\n\nWhat exactly has happened is unclear, but the local authorities claim that the suspect was found loitering near a murder scene. When prodded for further evidence implicating him, we were given a prompt reply of 'he looks like he did it.'\n\nNeedless to say, our citizen insists that he happened to have been wandering nearby when the police had discovered the body of the victim, though so far his pleads of innocence have fallen upon deaf ears. None of the local residents have spoken up in his defense, and most are convinced of his guilt despite the lack of hard evidence. Our people are aghast at the blatant display of injustice, so they look to us for a response."
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.3.d_NIM:0 "From the nation of pegasi, Nimbusia, comes saddening news. One of our own was jailed and is awaiting trial for murder. The incident has caused a stir amongst the ponies, who were already going against their usual xenophobia by letting Greneclyfan merchants trade in their country. Now even most of the pro-harmony reformists have lost confidence in our species.\n\nBoth the changeling and the victim were allegedly travelling towards some sort of sacred city for the Nimbusians by the name of Prancetras. Friends of our subject say that he got curious after hearing stories of an oracle who lives there, however, shortly before the changeling reached the city, he encountered the victim, a pegasus citizen. Whatever transpired there ended with a dead pegasus and our subject assuming the identity of the pony he just killed. Of course he was found out soon afterwards and was arrested by the Nimbusian authorities.\n\nThe changeling has sworn that it was in fact the pegasus who attacked him, but testimonies by the victim's family and friends say the victim was an honourable citizen and a veteran too, making the Nimbusians skeptical towards his testimony. This case is turning into a nightmare for Nimbusian-Greneclyfian relations. Do we believe our citizen's story or do we back the Nimbusian authorities to save face?"

Luckily for him, he could take shelter in a cave, ignoring the strange stone slab with inscriptions on it that stood before the cave's entrance. Through the storm, two monks also traversed the same path as the changeling. When the monks walked past the cave, they saw the changeling's glowing eyes staring at them. A few seconds later, our citizen was overwhelmed and dragged out of the cave and the monks were shouting at him in an unknown language.\n\nIt turns out our subject ventured into a cave where an evil 'demon' was supposedly sealed away. Entering this cave is a grievous offence and extremely suspicious to the pious Pònaidheans. The Taoiseach of Pònaidhean has asked us for our opinion, stating that she is willing to believe this was a misunderstanding, but that letting the changeling go now may mean that the clans in her country vote for restrictions on trade with Greneclyf in the future..."

Many of our merchants have called for retaliatory boycotts back at home, even though by all accounts foreign traders have been keeping perfectly fair and legal activities in Greneclyf. Some have suggested to show good will on our part by subsidising our people's purchases of local goods in the continent, whereas others advise to simply help our traders there to recoup their losses.\n\nWhat should we tell our people?"

 greneclyf_trade_crisis.7.d_BAK:0 "After many days behind closed doors, an utterly confused Greneclyfian was freely released by the authorities.\n\nIt is impossible to say why or how he was cleared of his accusations, as he was never a part of the proceedings between the Bakaran monks who deliberated the matter.\n\nWhilst our citizen was glad to be set free, many Bakarans were not. As he was being judged, orators in major cities repeated the story of the alleged crime, embellishing and adding further heinous acts with each retelling. By the time he was released, none of the Bakarans could believe that the monster that they had continously heard about was set free, and was chased away from the scene.\n\nNeedless to say, we have already sent our official protests to the Bakaran government, though our representatives there expect little sympathy from it."
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.7.d_DMT:0 "A furious representative from Diamond Mountain stormed into the home of our on-site diplomat, soldiers in tow, demanding the whereabouts of the accused from last month. Apparently, the defendant fled from his confinement and has not been seen since the previous night.\n\nOur diplomat of course refuted any part in the defendant's escape and offered a stern condemnation of their actions, but in private has expressed relief over the matter. The few times that the accused had been seen by his fellow Greneclyfians, it was in a dungeon under horrendous conditions. What little food was given was woefully inadequate, and the last time a close friend saw him, the jailed changeling was severely emanciated. It is little wonder that he has escaped his confinement in light of the circumstances.\n\nDespite our official condemnation of the defendant's escape, many diamond dogs were left convinced that there was no way that he had managed to do so unaided, and are now eyeing other Greneclyfians with suspicion."
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.7.d_NIM:0 "The reformist party had collected some money to buy a decent attorney for the changeling on trial in Nimbusia. The trials in the country were quite populist affairs, however, and our subject was already disadvantaged by being both a foreigner and a changeling. Still, the pegasus attorney delivered a flaming speech arguing that there was absolutely no evidence for the murder, pointing out that his client was unarmed and a weapon was found on the body of the dead pegasus. The lawyer of the victim countered by a gross depiction of stereotypes. The attorney played the crowd and fed their fears of the unknown. Despite no evidence that the changeling was actually guilty, the jury of citizens deemed the evidence substantive enough, referring to our subject as the "insectoid monster."\n\nThe trial continued to the second phase, where both the accused and the accuser got to propose a punishment. The defense attorney, under pressure and cornered by the mood of the crowd, decided to push for banishment, while the attacker pleaded for the death penalty. Thanks to the excellent oration of our lawyer, our citizen narrowly escaped death, with the attorney convincing just enough ponies to let the changeling leave, without his possessions, of course. Although our subject escaped Nimbusia with his life, opinions towards changelings in Nimbusia have soured even more."
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.7.d_FRE:0 "In Dail Mhòr, the court proceedings took place against the changeling accused for trespassing and summoning a demon. With the law system separated by Pònaidhean tribe, the Taoiseach had no choice but to make the changeling a temporary honourary member of her own clan. With that, the framework of laws was set.\n\nOur subject was helpless against the clan elders and the monks who acted as witnesses. Most of the court proceedings happened in a language our citizen couldn't even understand and nopony offered him legal counsel. The crimes of the changeling were extremely exaggerated by the elders in the end, as they seemed to truly believe that if the monks hadn't stopped him, the accused would have unleashed a terrible spirit. So, they gave the changeling a sentence of being taken in at a monastery for three years or until he came to repent his demonic past, whichever came later. Without any proper way of defending himself, our subject was dragged off to some forgotten mountaintop, forced into the Pònaidheans' weird religious institutions."

These rumours are scaring the population all across the Coalition, and relations with the changelings are, as of result, rapidly deteriorating. There are already scattered reports of hate crime related atrocities being committed against Greneclyfians, although these are, thankfully, relatively few and far between as of yet.\n\nThere has been no official response from the island nation as of yet, but it will almost certainly be unfavourable."

Fortunately these confrontations haven't caused any deaths, but there has been at least one critical injury so far.\n\nOur representatives have been drowning in protests from the respective governments regarding the behaviour of our changelings, promising dire consequences if the matter isn't addressed promptly and in a satisfactory manner.

They've endured for many weeks, but there has been no end in sight to the prejudice suffered at the hooves of our people. Ships laden with changelings have returned to Greneclyf seeking respite from the terrible treatment abroad. Unfortunately, these same changelings took out their anger at the continentals who willingly came here.\n\nThe recently inaugurated merchant district in Blosmport was mobbed by the returning merchants and adventurers, actively attacking ponies who were only guilty by association. There were no reported deaths from the clashes, but many were injured, some severely, and the entire district was utterly devastated by ransacking and looting.\n\nOnce the news returned on the continent, we were issued an ultimatum by the entire Coalition: leave their lands and never return.\n\nWith no other choice, we had to acquiesce to their demands and end our official relations with a sour note. People in Greneclyf are now seriously questioning the entire endeavour that [Root.GetLeader] had launched into the continent, as well what must be done in order to move forward in the world.\n\nAre we truly without merit in the eyes of the foreigners?"

Many of the violent locals have either been arrested by the authorities or have been shamed into submission by the majority of Riverlanders. It appears that we have finally defeated the caricature that had been placed upon us, and have earned if not amiable admiration, at least a grudging respect of our level-headed approach to the troubles that our people have had.\n\nMany natives have admitted shame of their past actions and have asked for forgiveness for their folly and blind fear that they once held. As expected, almost every Greneclyfian has wholeheartedly accepted their apologies and have, in true Greneclyfian spirit, extended a hoof of friendship to those who had wronged them before. While most of our communities are still fairly separated from those of local residents, there are some that are integrating very quickly and very well.\n\nBusiness has returned to normal, and there is nary a sign of trouble ahead for our people. Greneclyfians have finally stepped into the wider world, and we have not been shunned for it."

Many of our trading deals are failing, either by staunch refusal to our offers or by cessation of those accepted by the other parties. These have severely demoralised our people, but none more so than Queen Gytha. Upon hearing word of the latest failure, she lost herself in open despair, affecting a few too close to her. After much struggle, the Queen managed to sober up enough to close herself off in her personal chamber.\n\nShut off from everyone, the Queen has left no one on the seat of power, and no one is sure as to what can be done. As of right now, there is no one to look towards for a sense of stability, and panic is gripping the nation."

 greneclyf.69.d:0 ""Gytha," a tired voice pleaded. "Please say something."\n\nFeilean was out of uniform, as he had spent the past three hours trying to comfort his sister as the latest reports came in.\n\nThe Queen had gone through the gamut of reactions, from disbelief, to open weeping and now, a silent dread. Only the ebbing vestiges of the words of Gytha's brother still echoed through the chamber. Even the dropped title did not rouse the changeling as her eyes saw something that did not exist.\n\nFeilean approached the Queen. "Please," he repeated with a more emphatic tone. He almost sounded desperate.\n\nGytha's gaze grew focused but remained cast downwards. After a pregnant pause, she said, "Leave us."\n\nHer voice was neutral, but it left Feilean uneasy. The herald bowed her head and left. He probably should have joined the drone, yet he could not do so—not yet. His little sister needed someling to offer comfort.\n\n"We– we could try something different," Feilean said. "We still have time to course-correct."\n\nHe suddenly felt a snout nuzzling upon his neck frill. Gytha had embraced him without warning. "Thank you, big brother." Her voice was barely louder than a whisper. "I love you so much for all that you have done."\n\nFeilean hesitated at first but soon returned the embrace. After a long moment of warm comfort, she added, "Please. I need some time alone."\n\nAgain he hesitated to break the contact, though he obediently did so. He made for the door, shooting back a glance. "I will always be here for you, Gytha." A faint smile with watery eyes met his promise.\n\nGytha's stare lingered upon the door before it eventually drifted upwards towards the chandelier of the chamber. She gauged it for a long while; it would probably do."

Instead of a rickety car or truck, out of the darkness came an all-grey vehicle on caterpillar tracks travelling at a canter. It was a small thing, barely taller than an average changeling, topped by a primarily cylindrical shape out of which a smiling changeling stood behind an open hatch, waving at bewildered bystanders.\n\nWhat was later revealed to be a tankette, the vehicle was a hoof-crafted artisanal construction by the Donohuei brothers and was the talk of the entire hive. Completely different from a car or tractor, the little tank was ridden by the few changelings brave enough to try before it was loaded on a train for Blosmport by the end of the day.\n\nOnce mounted with a machine gun, the Donohuei brothers presented the tankette to the patent office, and the Greneclyfian Army recognised its potential. Though they do not have a use for it yet, the talk of a natively designed tank has sparked much interest in the capital. Even if most are convinced that we are not ready to field fleets of tanks, we have, in all likelihood, seen the birth of a Greneclyfian tank programme."

 #greneclyf.111.d:0 "When I heard about the House of Praise opening, I was sceptical. The Deoirethe that built it and others in the wake of their return never sat right with me. They claim that they were a local tradition in Aisling. They're small, rustic buildings, but there was a quality to them that called to me and many other sceptics. Their first Poet Call saw the pews stuffed with the curious and critics, with many filling the empty spaces in between.\n\nThe Praise Poet, a small, frail-looking drone in a beige robe, greeted us all with an open heart and spoke at length, retelling the tale of the Sunderer. It was nothing that we hadn't heard of before, but there was a noticeable tone of devotion in her voice that wasn't present in most retellings.\n\nI could already sense some guilt from some of the other spectators. They evidently hadn't given much thought about just how much changelings owed their existence to the Sunderer, but I, and I suspect most others, still were unmoved by the flowery prose.\n\nThen the Praise Singers sang\n\nThere was no instrumental accompaniment. It was a short poetical hymn that was about as eloquent as the Poet's earlier oration and, when put into writing, wasn't particularly eye-catching.\n\nBut the symphony... it touched my soul. The utter purity of the voices showed a harmonious quality that I had never believed that we shared. This is a part of our identity, and we had chased it away a century back. How could we have done so?\n\nWhen the choral finished, the entire audience was openly crying. My heart, both burdened with remorse but brought to peace by the song, had moved me to sob.  To this, the Praise Poet spoke:\n\n"Take these words ye faithful ones. Out of the dust were we born, and to the dust, we will return. Ye do not yet know the toil that They have made to bring you here, born on this lonely paradise. So They favoured your ancestors to grow in both Body and Mind, making them aware of themselves. Ye have just awoke; now ye must build and craft community as the creator has formed ye."\n\nI have, and I vow that we shall never again cut away a piece of ourselves. For the Sunderer."

 greneclyf_attaches.1.d:0 "Gytha knew it was too good to last. Everything had gone by like a wonderful dream — the wedding, the honeymoon, the bliss of each moment she spent with her husband. All of it came to an end when Cenhelm, having risen earlier, stood determined before her. Cute as he looked, Gytha wasn't so swayed.\n\n"I'm going abroad as an attaché,' Cenhelm repeated.\n\nThe Queen stretched out her legs before lazily tumbling over on their bed to sit up.\n\n"No, you're not, and I'm trampling whoever came up with the thought."\n\nShe straightened her neck and met his gaze, the silence between them interrupted only by the twitching of her wings. However, looming over him seemed to only bolster his resolve.\n\n"Gytha, it was my idea," Cenhelm said, continuing to look up at her eyes. "If I am to remain your King, I must use any opportunity to improve myself. I cannot let myself grow complacent, and I could never forgive myself if I could not defend you or everycreature in Beorgfordas. That is why I am doing this."\n\nGytha withheld her grimace. She understood his reasoning, even if she was personally against every conception of it. Her beloved husband belonged here, not away trying to better himself for her and Beorgfordas. He was hers, now and forever, and staring down at the pony... she could already tell he had committed himself to this.\n\nShe huffed and forlornly sunk her head onto the rumpled sheets. A sulking moment passed before Cenhelm pulled himself up and nuzzled her side. "I'll be back before you know it."\n\nGytha gently craned her head around and captured his lips in hers."

 greneclyf_attaches.2.d:0 "At last! No amount of time abroad learning new interplays of tactics, stratagems, and politics could keep King Cenhelm from yearning for Beorgfordas. Finally, his hooves now walked across the palace threshold. He was home, and not much national fanfare heralded his and his retinue's arrival, just as he requested. Aside from the journey too tiresome for them to be awash in loud spectacle, Cenhelm had been hoping that he could return unnoticed and surprise his most beautiful wife in the world. Though, as expected, it was all for nought the instant he subtly noticed one curiously cute drone tailing him ever since they had boarded the ferry.\n\nOnly when his retinue had finally bidden their departure did Cenhelm approach the drone, who had taken the guise of an ensign and appeared busy with some paperwork. It took every ounce of restraint behind his smirk to keep himself from laughing. "Well, hello there. What may your King do for a cute changeling like yourself on this lovely morning?"\n\nThe drone sputtered and blushed feverishly. "I... your majesty! W-what would the Queen say?!"\n\n"Considering how beautiful you look today..." Cenhelm leaned in. "I believe she would approve, wouldn't you, Gytha?"\n\nThe drone took a step back with an audible huff and set aside a file before dispelling her appearance, growing triple her size and leering over him with deep red irises. Her cheeks were still tinged with blush, which made her pout all the more adorable. "Glad I was right," Cenhelm said with a chuckle.\n\nGytha mumbled a growl and threw herself forward, her hooves snatching him up and closing the gap between them. When they broke from the kiss, Cenhelm managed to find his breath. "And here I was thinking you didn't like me."\n\n"A lot more than yesterday." The Queen smirked."

One represents the First Sharing from around 800 years ago, whereas the other depicts the Frozen Refuge, both events that are very significant for both Greneclyfians and Farbrookians.\n\nCollectively known as the Great Pacts, this hoofscraft stands as a testament of the historic friendship and collaborative nature between the two peoples, trascending biological barriers and proving that Harmony is truly universal."

 NCH_blindfold_starting_desc:0 "The memoirs of the expatriate Dairile have reached a broader audience in Greneclyf since it was published some sixty years ago. Further incidents from other Greneclyfians abroad displaying similarities to those experienced by the writer have roused a movement among the changelings protesting their treatment in the continent. The blindfold, symbolising the perceived desire of non-changelings not to speak with Greneclyfians, has become synonymous with the stewing resentment among the populace.\n\nThe growing radicalisation of the movement has shaken the people's faith in the Leahman approach of governance and foreign policy, and we've seen political support waning. We know that the CPM is behind this, and we can expect this to continue if their call for a governmental response to Dairile's question that she posed fifty years ago is ignored. It'd best be a response that Greneclyfians and the CPM will accept, lest we risk further aggravating the perceived slights against us...\n\nThe CPM's supporters are currently §Rprotesting.§!"

 NCH_inadequate_shipyards_MtG_desc:0 "Unfortunately for us, naval investments made by Queen Nóra Mhic were mainly directed towards acquiring foreign-built ships, as it was deemed too costly to set up the necessary foundation for a massive shipbuilding industry.

 NCH_cara_desc:0 "The leader of the Greneclyfian Cartographer Society, Cara Ní hAodha's talents in subterfuge and deception are surprising qualities in a Greneclyfian, more so for someone as calm and placid as she. Her position as the head of the GCS does place her in an advantageous position in the nation, having a network of informants and contacts abroad that can operate on the continent. Cara's motives are as nebulous as her origins, but she has said that the death of Queen Nóra Mhic left Greneclyf vulnerable, and she intends to keep the country safe.\n\nHer skills and connections are contrary to the pacifist and honest methods of the Leahman Clann, but they might be crucial for the well-being of the country. It's evident that behind Cara's soft voice and calm demeanour is a calculating mind who will do anything to defend her country. What else might she be hiding behind her kind eyes though?"

A modified design with a less powerful engine slashed its projected speed. As a result, however, its range was massively improved and easily outranged dedicated fighters, including some interceptors."

Experiments with implementing both the GD series magical grenades as rifle grenades, though promising, were not completed once the army dismissed both the RLUI-16 and the RI-L16."

Eventually recalling former LLB designers, they and Lochainn Loadaid gunsmiths brought the RLUI-P26 to military trials. Though ultimately rejected as the Greneclyfian army was no longer interested in magical firearms, its excellent display in said trials created the demand for the rifle and future magical weapons from private buyers."

 NCH_motorized_equipment_0_desc:0 "The modernisation of the Greneclyfian armed forces saw the introduction of heavy artillery pieces, which, while towable by soldiers, prompted military planners to request a prime mover. However, the lack of suitable candidates forced the hoof of the army and instead used a scout car. Initially built for civilian use, the ISR-1 had decent offroad characteristics but lacked sufficient torque for the new prime mover role. Few ISR-1s were used in this role before the ISR-2 was introduced."

 NCH_motorized_equipment_1_desc:0 "Once the ISR-1 was deployed, its use as an impromptu troop transport became evident, and a request for a dedicated infantry truck was immediately placed. The ISR-2's design evolved from a civilian truck with a reworked transmission gearbox and a new engine in an elongated flatbed chassis. Unlike the previous ISR-1, the ISR-2 exchanged the ISR-1's speed and offroad capabilities for torque and transport capacity. It still served well as a prime mover but was seen as a great success as a troop carrier."

Even the Dornálaí tank was considerably speedier off-road. As such, the need for a troop carrier that could keep up with the cruiser-pattern tanks led to the development of the first standardised half-track design of Greneclyf. The IT-1 would never be able to race with the ISR-2 on a paved track, but it proved to be a quicker carrier than the ISR-2 off-road. Nicknamed the 'tortoise' by troops, it was still praised for its reliability."

Made to double as a prime artillery tower, the IT-2 boasted greater carrying capacity while maintaining tactical manoeuvrability. It, however, also proved costly to produce. As such, only 300 IT-2 carriers were constructed and acquired by the Greneclyfian army."

Outwardly, the IA-PS21 was identical to its Stalliongradian counterpart, but due to different crew requirements, it gained plenty of leg room. Some of the Greneclyfian old guard disliked the transition to wheeled transports as they didn't perform as well off-road as traditional half-tracks did, but a wheeled configuration made the IA-PS21 easy to maintain and repair."

Again, the wheeled design was disliked by some of the Greneclyfian Army Staff, but as the battlefield shifted towards more urban areas, it was readily adopted after trials. As with previous iterations from the IA series, the IA-PS28 had its engine replaced with a smaller design to increase its overall carrying capacity at the cost of speed. It was acclaimed for the ease of repair and maintenance."

The turret was stripped down to be a commander's view port, and the engine was substituted with a less powerful yet smaller design to provide more carrying capacity. The return to caterpillar tracks made the IS-PS28 an excellent vehicle for the terrain that it operated on. It was surpassed by wheeled designs in urban areas, but this shortcoming was deemed insignificant."

As such, a specialised troop carrier was requested, and the LA-1 was the result. Originally a Slatara lorry, the LA-1 was essentially an elongated truck in the skin of a boat.

Deviating from the IT-2 half-track, the new chassis made for a great protected amphibious carrier; it had enough armour to protect the passengers from small arms fire, and the caterpillar tracks addressed reefs and subaquatic rocks that oftend punctured the LA-1's tyres.

The wheeled design made Greneclyfian High Command hesitant of acquiring the production license from Stalliongrad, as past experiences with the LA-1 had left a bad taste. However, the heavy-duty tyres made the CSA-PS1 more than capable of wading across hazardous waters, and its versatility as a reconnaissance vehicle won over the Greneclyfian leadership. Somewhat expensive to build, the CSA-PS1 was mostly deployed with special forces."

Its modified engine meant that while the ITA-PS2 was as capable as its landborne counterpart, it was a gas guzzler due to the precautions taken to make the engine waterproof. In the end, the ITA-PS2's engine could develop problems if it came into contact with water.

With many different commercial automobile designs available, it stood to reason that one could be converted into a fighting vehicle. Using a high-powered Slatara lorry as the chassis, a prototype was built and tested. It boasted a 200° rotating turret that could house a three pounder gun, but it armour was deemed insufficient, and the engine overheated twice during its trial. The FCA-1 proved to be a useful lesson for future designs."

Unlike previous models, the CA-3 took to fulfilling the design requirement for adequate protection against small arms, leading to its distinct shell-like design. Using a modified engine from the Dornálái tank, the CA-3 achieved high cruising speeds and had a long range. This made the vehicle ideal for a centralised armoured car force that could be quickly dispatched to distant areas of operation. It also meant that the CA3 was only built in small numbers due to high production costs."

Survivability and ease of production were the guiding aspects in building the CA-4, and it performed admirably in both aspects. The angular design saved weight and provided good defense at the cost of crew comfort. Despite substituting the previous modified engine with a weaker half-track variant, the CA-4 maintained good speed and manoeuvrability in urban areas."

With an enlarged turret to house a modified two pounder cannon and a rear-facing hull-mounted machine gun, the CAF-1 was capable of engaging lightly armoured targets. However, the mounting of the cannon and the hull machine gun came made for an extremely cramped interior. CAF-1 crews often suffered more from combat fatigue than those of the regular CA-4."

It achieved cruising speeds of 55 km/h and had a top speed of over 100 km/h, making it one of the world's fastest armoured cars of the time. The secret to its speed was the perfected version of the Slatara 4-cylinder engine from the previous CA-8 iteration. It was originally designed for either a 20mm autocannon or 60mm mortar mounted in the turret, but many variants with different mountings served in the army."

As light tanks were phased out, a speedy platform for a high-velocity anti-tank gun was needed, and the C.11 was found to be an ideal chassis. Mounted with a 90mm gun in an enlarged turret, the CAF-3 offered a capable anti-tank response in a small and fast package. Its versatility was praised, and was used in both tank hunting and reconnaissance duties."

These early armoured trains were not standardised, and the differently armoured models caused headaches in maintenance, forcing Army Logistics to create a single design based on the L21 train, the TC1. It had firing ports, and most had HMG wagons to ward off aerial attacks from pegasi and, coincidentally, light aircraft. The TC1's famous camouflage patterns earned it the nickname of 'Rolling Skyline'."

Considerably larger and more powerful, the locomotive could pull up-armoured wagons with dedicated AA weaponry that could be up-gunned to rapid-firing cannons."

While the official BnG design encountered delays, the Donohuei brothers used theirs to create a new tank for the role. Derisively nicknamed 'the Little One', the tankette was barely larger and longer than its predecessor, with arguably less space for the two crewmembers operating it.

The Saillteoir's somewhat open-topped turret meant that only 12.7mm machineguns in a dual configuration were viable as main armaments. Trading overall killing power for compact weapons meant that the Saillteoir had considerable staying power, and it outlasted its competitors in endurance trials. Despite the simplified turret, the medium SPAAG saw limited numbers."

 NCH_super_heavy_tank_equipment_x_2_desc:0 "The C.19 is a testament to its antiquated origins and doctrinal thought. Essentially a truncated Hiodra II, the overall layout was more conventional but retained the oversized turret and had an even larger naval gun. On paper, the C.19 was a formidable heavy tank when first designed in 1017, but the prototype construction took far longer than expected and competed with the C.18 in the 1021 tank trials. Hopelessly sluggish and slow, not even the C.19's astonishing firepower or survivability could outperform the lighter and comparatively versatile C.18."

As such, crews had to get inventive in hiding the vehicle when in combat to ensure its survivability."

In contrast, all changelings are inherently superior to other sapient creatures.\n\nThis goes beyond specific discrimination and the overall treatment of non-changelings as second-class citizens at best, or as little better than cattle at worst."

In addition, she is the youngest Queen to lead Greneclyf at 22, far too young under ordinary circumstances. Unfortunately for everyone involved, Gytha's ascension was anything but. In this light, the new Queen is seen with trepidation, especially considering her close relationship with her mother. Her first weeks as the head of state were chaotic, and it was only through Feilean, her older brother, that order was restored on the island following Queen Nóra's death.\n\nThe difficulties before Gytha are many, and there is little faith in her opponents or herself. However, there is too much at stake for the Queen to fail now. With a well-curated cabinet, a sound plan, and determination, there is a chance for Gytha to undo the mistakes of her mother.§!\n\n§YPortrait By§!§L: Stephen Sen§!"

There is no plan beyond a few policies and actions they have meant to take for years, and Oiren's clann will be of little help.\n\nIt is in this situation that the newly-crowned Queen Oiren must rule a country that is rapidly spiralling out of her barely acquired control.\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!§L: Scroup§!"

 FENNORE_POLITICS_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!§L: 15th of March 976, in Coillín§!\n\n§YBiography§!§L: Born to a poor family, Fennore was one of the many Greneclyfians who partook in Queen Nóra Mic's diaspora project, settling in Vetailje with her family and growing up in the small Greneclyfian community. Her disdain for non-changelings was formed here, and it was solidified when her father, Colum, was beaten to near death by an enraged mob of Bakarans. The image of Fennore's father's broken body on the pavement is one she'll carry to her grave, forever at the forefront of her mind.\n\nWhen she returned to Greneclyf, Fennore was a destitute drone and found her place among countless other drones, left impoverished by failed industrialisation and enrichment efforts. She would probably have been left to waste on the wayside had it not been for the fateful reencounter with an old foalhood friend, Cader Sclerite. Inducted into the CPM, Fennore found her new calling in life: firebrand speaker for a radical new coalition.\n\nAs First Consul, Fennore can manipulate the path the Greneclyfian Republic will tread and, perhaps, allow her more radical stances to dictate policy. Others will undoubtedly question her methods, but there will always be a method to Fennore's madness, and there will always be a traumatic memory driving her.\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!§L: Yuri/floppochkin§!" # Needs a pass of edits -Etyco

Eolan is likely the first Greneclyfian multi-millionaire and easily the wealthiest drone in Greneclyf, possibly of all changeling-kind.\n\nHaving invested early and heavily into steel mills when Queen Nóra Mhic launched her national industrialisation programme, Eolan reaped many dividends and returns and comfortably stayed afloat once the crash came. This has left the elderly drone with a profitable and productive industrial enterprise and a lot of money to spend. Surprisingly, he has chosen to venture into politics and in league with Cader Sclerite's CPM.\n\nFew expect any real play for First Consul from Eolan, and fewer still can even guess his policy matters. The big shot from Blosmport has kept quiet about his own philosophy. Only time will tell...\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!§L: Yuri/floppochkin§!"

Leaving Greneclyf as Breas Ó Fathaigh, his adopted name and nomenclature are examples of Queen Nóra Mhic's more successful policies. As such, he has learned much during his travels. Cader's time in various nations, such as Skynavia and Kása, has helped mould his political identity and agenda. Prior radicalised teachings have long since been tempered by the domestic and international realities he has witnessed. Consequently, he has since formulated his own answer to the woes of Greneclyf.\n\nAs First Consul, Cader would be in the perfect position to guide the country via democratising all aspects of Greneclyfian society and would be the glue keeping the CPM from splintering into the various cliques it used to be. Luckily, his moderate policies and strong friendship with Fennore will undoubtedly aid him in his endeavours, and most expect many great things from the first-ever drone leader in his grand republican experiment.\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!§L: Scroup§!"

He was named after Goldblóma, a Farbrookian stallion, a long-time family friend and devoted business partner to Goldáin's parents. Being the third youngest among his siblings, he had no chance to inherit the family fortune. Still, his loving parents provided him with the highest quality education reserved only for Greneclyf's wealthiest.\n\nAfter being accepted to officer school, the young Goldáin earned a reputation as a quick-witted and charming person, securing relatively high marks in subjects as well as a certain amount of popularity in the class of 998. His inherent capacity to lead others was honed during his time at the academy and made him an excellent prospective officer. However, due to an altercation abroad regarding a Farbrookian mare, Goldáin's fast-track came to a sudden halt and was seriously reprimanded for his unprofessional behaviour. The only thing that prevented him from being dishonourably discharged or sacked was that he defended the mare, Gimcynn, from suspected criminals. In this, he gained both the respect and admiration of Gimcynn.\n\nNot long after 1003, while still serving in the Greneclyfian Army as a captain, Goldáin's friendship with Gymcinn bloomed into something more, and the two now reside together in Blosmport. A major before the reforms, a superior officer recommended his promotion to general. Though others of his rank eye this with suspicion, Goldáin's youthful energy, while perhaps reckless, promises new ideas to Greneclyf's General Staff.§!\n\n§YPortrait By§!§L: Neither§!"

Though by no means a small creature, his stature pales compared to his kin and belies his age. Even he wouldn't know how old he truly is.\n\nLong ago, Snow had abandoned his tribes in the far South in search of a place to deepen his understanding of modern warfare. His wanderings eventually led him to the Griffonian Empire, where he could learn through second-hoof knowledge from the few griffons willing to share or trade. Finally, through a long period of self-teaching, Frostwing grew to have a deep understanding of the griffon school of war and would have been a knowledgeable peer had the griffon courts accepted him. Instead, Snow would only be known as a dragon squatting on the outskirts of Vinnin.\n\nNews of a changeling rearmament campaign reached the dragon, and he was interested in playing his part in a historic undertaking. Of course, the changeling attaché Snow had heard of was from the West, but those who told him of the changelings' lands pointed him to Greneclyf. By pure coincidence, the Greneclyfians were also in the midst of a rearmament program, and Queen Nóra Mhic readily accepted the service offered by Frostwing. Working alongside Feilean, the two modernised the Greneclyfian armed forces, and for his part, Snow was awarded a special place in Greneclyfian society and its military.\n\n§YPortrait By§!§L: Rich May§!"

Having grown up in Venyx's hive near Vesalipolis, and being trained under the tutelage of Venyx has crafted the Royal into a promising commander.\n\nHowever, once Chrysalis took control of the surrounding hives and changeling lands in 988, Aufst's life was endangered by the new despot's culling of Royal males. His queen, Venyx, managed to shuttle him away to keep him safe from Chrysalis's wrath, much to Ausft's protests. Through an elaborate ruse, Venyx ensured Ausft was declared dead and shipped to the one place where he could carve out a living for himself: Greneclyf.\n\nWhen he arrived in 990, the Royal was warmly received, though he had kept the reason for coming a secret. By 1001, Ausft decided to assist the burgeoning Greneclyfian military programme by enrolling as an officer, only to be foiled by Chrysalis's failed invasion of Canterlot in 1002. Branded as untrustworthy, Vespaex was barred from any position of power.\n\nIt was only after the Greneclyfian Queen's pardon to all exiles and refugees that Ausft could finally make use of his upbringing, though for a queen he had never expected to serve.\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!§L: Yuri/floppochkin§!"

 PHASMA_MIL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!§L: 30th of September 968, in Vesalipolis§!\n\n§YRank§!§L: Ghinearál\n\n§!§YBiography§!§L: Phasmatodea's arrival in Greneclyf is as confused as his lineage. Back in Vesalipolis, he was born as an illegitimate son of an unknown royal male. Without many other prospects, Phasmatodea chose to serve in the army. He did so with distinction, eventually becoming a competent field commander during the wars of unification. However, like most other royal males, he was to be put to death in 988 under Queen Chrysalis's new decree.\n\nAfter a long absence, he reappeared in Blosmport in 1001, seeking asylum from Chrysalis's agents and less-than-friendly griffon locals. Though the Royal is tight-lipped about his escape from Equus and the subsequent escapades, the few tidbits he revealed imply near-death experiences, failed attempts at living a new life, and even running an illegal rum-running scheme in Skyfall. However, he was drunk when he made these claims; thus, they are treated as nothing more than drunken ramblings.\n\nHe has lived a relatively quiet life in Cuibhreann, a small town to the West of Aisling, even after the breakdown of Greneclyfian relations with the Changeling Lands and the spike of local distrust towards the Western changelings. Some even started a vicious rumour that he was the one and only child of Queen Chrysalis. Once the general pardon for all foreign changelings was announced by the Greneclyfian Crown, Phasmatodea took the opportunity to serve once more, this time to prove his detractors once and for all: he was no Vesali, let alone the son of someone as despicable as Chrysalis.\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!§L: BlakaSmoko§!"

 NCH_jager:0 "Fusiliers" 
 NCH_jager_desc:0 "Fusiliers are specialised infantry, generally fielding rural changelings with plenty of outdoor experience. They are masters of the marshes and woodlands of the cold North and excellent offensive units, if unconventional."
 NCH_jager_tech:0 "Light Infantry Technology"

 NCH_tech_jager:0 "Light Infantry I"
 NCH_tech_jager_desc:0 "Known locally as 'Fiúsailéirí', these specialised light infantry perform a similar role to the Changeling Lands' Jager units. Typically recruited from a pool of hardy rural changelings, these soldiers are used to rugged terrain, such as marshes and forests, and use unconventional tactics when on the offensive."

 NCH_tech_jager2:0 "Light Infantry II"
 NCH_tech_jager2_desc:0 "Fusiliers perform best when let loose behind enemy lines, especially when they get there without the enemy's notice. To this point, we must train these soldiers with some infiltrator techniques to slip past the enemy lines to raise the least bit of alarm before they unleash themselves upon their unsuspecting victims."

 NCH_tech_jager3:0 "Light Infantry III"
 NCH_tech_jager3_desc:0 "Soft targets such as trucks and infantry are the usual targets for our Fusiliers. However, the occasional heavy vehicles are left alone due to the Fusilier's inability to engage effectively. Teaching our soldiers the best ways to destroy or otherwise disable vehicles such as tanks by providing them with handy field guides will enable our Fusiliers to take on hard targets as targets of opportunity."

 NCH_tech_jager_a:0 "Light Infantry IV"
 NCH_tech_jager_a_desc:0 "A curious tradition has emerged among our Fusilier ranks, where particularly grizzled Fusiliers are called 'Seagoir'. These 'Hunters' seem to have an intrinsic sense of where best to penetrate enemy defences and can survive even the most improbable odds, little worse for wear. We should identify these individuals and offer them NCO training so that they can impress their uncanny abilities upon their squads and improve the Fusiliers' overall capabilities."

 NCH_tech_jager_b:0 "Light Infantry V"
 NCH_tech_jager_b_desc:0 "Marshes and swamps have always been challenging terrain for infantry to traverse, let alone attack. Though our Fusiliers are already reasonably adept in fighting in bogs, they can do better. Specialised water combat training for specific Fusilier detachments will produce soldiers capable of stealthily and efficiently getting through hard points in marshes and clearing the way for the rest of the units."

 NCH_tech_jager_c:0 "Light Infantry VI"
 NCH_tech_jager_c_desc:0 "Many Fusiliers come from mainly wooded areas, so they are already familiar with forests. However, they are only used to surviving and traversing them. A forest already provides excellent cover for stealthy attackers and hidden defenders. However, a new training regimen focusing on creative woodland tactics will enable Fusiliers to identify excellent hiding spots or hidden forest paths. Some of these are so ingenious that it sometimes seems that a Fusilier appears out of nowhere!"

 NCH_tech_changeling_c:0 "Tonn Dubh"
 NCH_tech_changeling_c_desc:0 "Tales of old speak of a time when roving bands of hunter-gatherer changelings, when dealing with settlements, formed 'black waves', said to penetrate any wall or defences. It turns out that particularly well-fed changelings, when attuned to one another,  can create a quasi-congruous shape that can easily overwhelm the defensive positions on the front. Only the stoutest of defences can survive the onslaught of one of these black waves."

 NCH_tech_shock_drop_cocoons_desc:0 "Exiles from the Changeling Lands have shared with us some of the tactics used during the Canterlot Invasion of 1002, one of which includes the insertion of elite soldiers via magically reinforced cocoons. With their expertise, we can perfect this tactic and train our airborne troops in this insertion method for challenging drops. Not only will these protect them as they drop, but the cocoons can also devastate whatever they land on!"

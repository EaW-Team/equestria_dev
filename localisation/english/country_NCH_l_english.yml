#Slána, lover of our souls,
#Let Queens to thy embrace fly,
#While tempestuously the rain falls,
#While the hailstorm still is high.
#O Saviour, have they tried,
#Surge past all our caste;
#Safe into the haven guide;
#O receive their souls at last.

#Expose someone to anger long enough, and they will learn to hate.

#"If you cannot shake the target on your back, you have to create a more tempting target."
#""Out of my way!" Cernhelm roared, throwing the royal guards aside with a mighty shove before barging against the door. The massive gates, meant to be opened by four together, creaked and were slammed open as Cernhelm pushed, heaved, and threw them open. The chamber beyond was regal, but the signs of grief were scattered all over them like petals around the bud that was Gytha's bed. Storming inside, Cernhelm saw the dismal sight of the one he had come for: she lay on the bed, having pushed herself slowly up to see what was happening, and already he saw the play going over her face. Shock, surprise, composure so quick it was as if her life depended on it, and then that damn calm.\n\n"I did not expect yo—" she began before he reached her, stepping up to the bed and wrapping his arms around her, without reservation or hesitation.\n\n"They are all idiots!" he exclaimed. "Foals and narrow-minded buffoons! They got a treasure, and they threw it away because they wouldn't know their flanks from it! You weren't wrong, you were greater than I ever imagined, and I thought you didn't even need me to triumph! I'm sorry Gytha, I'm so sorry..." The words came pouring out of him, tears beginning to well up. "You weren't wrong, you were radiant, and damn those southern morons for not seeing it! But not you, never you!"\n\nGytha had frozen at first in his embrace, but as he fell silent her breathing, rapid as the surprise was, turned ragged. A sniffle turned into a sob, and then tears rolled down her cheeks as she returned the embrace, crying in grief and pain over the events of the last months. All her hopes and dreams had shattered, creating a bed of glass for her to lie in. Now, she found if not peace then at least solace, leaning into his embrace and finally, after so long, crying. She wept over how she had hoped for a kinder world for her people and had it all thrown back into his face. Yet, she wept because the icy cold of despair that had settled over her shattered as well, broken by this rough, uncouth hillpony who came for her when nobody else did.\n\nUnseen by either Chief or Queen was a smartly dressed Feilean watching from beyond the threshold. A soft smile adorned his face as he silently closed the door. He had been one of the many who doubted that his sister's affection of Cenhelm was anything more than a passing crush, and he wasn't often wrong.\n\nThis was one of the few times that he was thankful that he was wrong."

#the following three are "romanced by Ardent, reviewed by King Buggo, and sapped by Yuri"
#Cenhelm gazed out at the faint silhouettes appearing through the cool fog. If the morning calm held, they'd start seeing the spires of Blosmport soon, and then the ferry could make for the nearest dock. The voyage had been fair for the most part, though it mattered little to the smiling Chief of Farbrook, steered by nought but heart and dream.\n\n"Good mornin' Chief," the approaching ferry captain said, tipping his officer's cap in greeting. "You seem to be in bright spirits."\n\n"Yes." Cenhelm chuckled with a nod. "I am indeed."n\n\"Thinking about the Queen again?" The ferry captain joined his side. "Must be a lot to think about, if you don't mind sharing."\n\n"Absolutely, but where do I begin?" Farbrook's Chief beamed lively, his eyes entranced on the looming island. "Gytha's heart is as beautiful as she, and she tries her best to care for everycreature. She can try a bit too much at times, but being able to hold onto her convictions so openly against all the world has thrown at her is beyond admirable. Gytha is wonderful, and I truly believe in her ideas of our countries joining through mutual love and growth together, though whenever she speaks, I always swear her words are trying to magically embrace me." He paused and sheepishly added, "That, uh, could just be her Greneclyfian accent..."\n\nCenhelm pushed his embarrassment aside. "Our peoples have nothing to fear. She is more capable of leading a nation than she believes herself to be, and I couldn't ask for a better best friend at my side in this than her. With everything going on, I only hope our relationship can—" A commotion caught his attention, and the Chief glimpsed over... only to double-take at the emerging ferry captain furiously demanding who stole his officer's cap.\n\nThere was a shimmering pop and a pair of hooves gently wrapped around Cenhelm's shoulders from behind. "What was that about my accent, dear?"

#Gytha knew it was too good to last. Everything had gone by like a wonderful dream—the wedding, the honeymoon, the bliss of each moment she spent with her husband. All of it came to an end when Cenhelm, having risen earlier, stood determined before her. Cute as he looked, Gytha wasn't so swayed.\n\n"I'm going abroad as an attaché," Cenhelm repeated.\n\nThe Queen stretched out her legs before lazily tumbling over on their bed to sit up, "No, you're not, and I'm trampling whoever came up with the thought."\nShe straightened her neck and met his gaze, the silence between them interrupted only by the twitching of her wings. Looming over him, however, seemed to only bolster his resolve.\n\n"Gytha, it was my idea," Cenhelm said, continuing to look up at her eyes, "If I am to remain your King, I must use any opportunity improve myself. I cannot let myself grow complacent, and I could never forgive myself if I was unable to defend you or everycreature in Beorgfordas. That is why I am doing this."\n\nGytha withheld her grimace. She understood his reasoning, even if she was personally against every conception of it. Her beloved husband belonged here, not away trying to better himself for her and Beorgfordas. He was hers, now and forever, and staring down at the pony... she could already tell he had committed himself to this.\n\nShe huffed and forlornly sunk her head onto the rumpled sheets. A sulking moment passed before Cenhelm pulled himself up and nuzzled her side, "I'll be back before you know it."\n\nGytha gently craned her head around and captured his lips in hers, "You better."

#At last! No amount of time abroad learning new interplays of tactics, stratagems, and politics could keep King Cenhelm from yearning for Beorgfordas. Finally, his hooves now walked across the palace threshold. He was home, and not much national fanfare heralded his and his retinue's arrival, just as he requested. Aside from the journey too tiresome for them to be awash in loud spectacle, Cenhelm had been hoping that he could return unnoticed and surprise his most beautiful wife in the world. Though, as expected, it was all for nought the instant he subtly noticed one curiously cute drone tailing him ever since they had boarded the ferry.\n\nOnly when his retinue had finally bidden their departure did Cenhelm approach the drone, who had taken the guise of an ensign and appeared busy with some paperwork. It took every ounce of restraint behind his smirk to keep himself from laughing. "Well, hello there. What may your King do for a cute changeling like yourself on this lovely morning?"\n\nThe drone sputtered and blushed feverishly. "I... your majesty! W-what would the Queen say?!"\n\n"Considering how beautiful you look today..." Cenhelm leaned in. "I believe she would approve, wouldn't you, Gytha?"\n\nThe drone took a step back with an audible huff and set aside a file before dispelling her appearance, growing triple her size and leering over him with deep red irises. Her cheeks were still tinged with blush, which made her pout all the more adorable. "Glad I was right," Cenhelm said with a chuckle.\n\nGytha mumbled a growl and threw herself forward, her hooves snatching him up and closing the gap between them. When they broke from the kiss, Cenhelm managed to find his breath. "And here I was thinking you didn't like me."\n\n"A lot more than yesterday." The Queen smirked. "And a lot less than tomorrow."

#Two nothings is nothing. That's mathematics! You can argue with me, but you can't argue with figures! Two half nothings is a whole nothing!

#I preface this with mentioning one of my favourite writers growing up, our popular hero, Dairile. And I remember her exact words: "You asked my father to wait, my brother to wait, my uncle to wait. How long must I wait for equality? How long must I wait on rights, liberty and acceptance?" As a changeling nymph, her words resonated with me because I knew that the continent denied me my rights, and I personalised this feeling.
#But, as I grew, I began to understand: poor ponies were denied. They dismissed destitute dogs. Everyone but the leaders, that small group among all of us, have been declined our rights. So I ask you to look to your peers present. Look to them, and say, "friends, the time is now. There are more of us; we are stronger, and we will wait no longer."
#The time is now. When asked to pledge your support, I need you to carry the memory of my words: changelings, ponies, dogs, griffons, males, females, we are all in this together. We are united. Our time is right now.
#We will not wait fifty more years, nor another month. We will not even wait for another queen.  It is not some abstract that may happen in the future. It is not something that might be, that could be, that would be, that should be. It's not coming tomorrow; this is happening NOW.
#Our companion Cader Sclerite shall be Greneclyf's leader and hope. Pledge your support, as I have, to him.

#Day of Democracy

#Our only strength is the will to survive, knowing that we will perish, knowing nothing more absolute.
#We rise, towards the sun! Those who died, died fighting. They are now buried in the sun. No need to mourn, there is a raid to the sun.
#They did not let us sing our songs. They are afraid, afraid of the dawn. They are adfraid of hope, but our songs will be sung.
#There is a destiny above destiny.
#There is a victory growing with every morning.
#There is a God beyond existence or nonexistence.
#There is my country beyond everything, my beloved.
#There is the evil that tortures and tears me down.
#There are songs to be sung in affectation of our victories.
#Beyond the next morning, there is a victory waiting to be won.
#Do not doubt the One! There is a decision coming from the heavens.
#Fear not when the dark falls! There is an artist painting the sun.
#Do not dare to surrender! There is a victory that grows with defeat.

#My name was burnt into ashes, as I once was.

#Some political analysts make the mistake that their enemies should also be ours.
#It is not not those who can inflict the most, but those who can suffer the most who will conquer.
#Dirty Tools for a Dirty Job
#Tabhair arm dó láithreach! Ar son saoirse agus bua! Arna eisiúint ag coiste cosanta nGreneclyf

#There will be no people in Greneclyf, for all property of every sort shall belong to the Ruler. The people are her children and she shall care for them. Each person will be given freely by their neighbours whatever they require for their use, which is as much as any one may reasonably desire.

#Everyone shall work half the time and play half the time, and the people shall enjoy the work as much as they do the play, because it is good to be occupied to have something to do. There shall be no cruel overseers to watch them, and no one to rebuke or find fault with them. So each one shall be proud to do all that they can for their friends and neighbours, and be glad when they would accept the the things they produced.

#Everyone, no matter what they produced for the community, shall be supplied by the neighbours with food and clothing and a house and furniture and ornaments and games. If by chance the supply ever runs short, more shall be taken from the great storehouses of the Ruler, which would afterwards be filled up again when there is more of any article than the people needed.

 ### EVENTS ###

 ### SUNDERER START ###

 greneclyf_sunderer.1.t:0 "The Changeling who can do Miracles"
 greneclyf_sunderer.1.d:0 "The news that reached Queen Oiren had been plenty and consistently either bad or about troubling developments. Every single utterance made Oiren just that bit more aware of the terrifying hardships and responsibilities that were now her own. How could one changeling resolve all of the country's woes?\n\nResigning herself to another bout of soul-crushing news, Oiren only half-listened to the new report dictated to her. However, when she failed to note the actual issue, the Queen straightened up and asked the messenger to repeat herself.\n\n"In Aisling, Your Highness. There's a petition from an unknown queen to visit you." At Oiren's insistence, the messenger continued: "Many have claimed that she has performed miracles, helping the local community in seemingly fantastical ways."\n\n"Who is she?" The Queen demanded.\n\nThe messenger paused, and her lips tightened. "She purports to be Slána the Sunderer."\n\nOiren almost laughed. The Sunderer, the one who had freed all of changelingdom from the Great Hatcher Below untold millennia ago... Was petitioning the Queen? It had been a while since she had last had an honest smile, one that, surprisingly, the messenger did not share.\n\n"As insane as it may seem, Your Highness," the drone began, "the reports from the locals are emphatically in favour of this "Sunderer" person."\n\nQueen Oiren scoffed. "Do you believe that this is Slána reborn?"\n\nThe drone didn't respond, but it was clear that she was considering the possibility. Oiren did so, too, slowly ruminating on the idea. It was just a visit, after all. If anything, a formal petition from a supposed miracle worker would be a welcome distraction."
 greneclyf_sunderer.1.a:0 ""This changeling's clearly delusional. Have them committed to an asylum.""
 greneclyf_sunderer.1.b:0 ""...I shall entertain this "Sunderer." Arrange a hearing.""

 #greneclyf_sunderer.2.t:0 "A Debriefing with [NCH.NCH_cara.GetName]" #Cara was hired
 greneclyf_sunderer.2.t:0 "A Warning from the GCS" #Cara was not hired
 greneclyf_sunderer.2.d:0 "There were many things that Oiren had to get used to, and most of them weren't to her liking. Reading reports, dictating responses, and working on paperwork; none of these were activities she had expected to be so time-consuming or demanding as Queen. A wave of relief washed over her as she signed the last document for the day. Not that the workday was finished. She still had some letters addressed to her to go through. The Queen scanned through the envelopes before spotting one that caught her eye.\n\nIt had an ornate design with the seal of the Greneclyfian Cartographers' Society. Slicing it open, Oiren began to read the letter within.\n\n"To Her Royal Highness,\n\n"We at the Greneclyfian Cartographers' Society have recently heard of the appearance of one individual going by "the Sunderer," and the members of our genealogical branch have searched for records to identify said Sunderer.\n\n"Their findings have yielded no results on the Sunderer's origins or any possible family members. This has led them to believe that the individual is, in all likelihood, a spy or impostor posing as the fabled Sunderer of our history and are extending their warning to Her Royal Highness.\n\n"Always faithful and forever at your service,\nCara Ní hAodha - Head of the Greneclyfian Cartographers' Society"\n\nIt struck Oiren odd that the GCS would have written this to her, but she knew they did boast a renowned genealogy department. Their results were almost certainly accurate, but could the same be said about their findings?" #Cara was not hired
 #greneclyf_sunderer.2.d:0 "Queen Oiren still couldn't quite get a good read on the headling of the GCS, Cara, as the latter presented herself for the weekly debriefing of the agency. The Queen had asked about Cara herself when she first introduced herself during the first debrief, but the drone politely declined to do so. It didn't sit right with Oiren; since then, she had tried to figure out the peculiarly dressed drone with no success.\n\nHowever, the courteous smile on Cara was curiously absent. In its place was a concerned look. "What do you have to report?" the Queen asked.\n\n"Your Highness, as the head of the GCS, it is my duty and responsibility to appraise all court visitors, and I must admit..." Cara paused, a slight tinge of incredulity seeping through her expression. "What I am about to disclose about this "Sunderer" visitor is disconcerting."\n\nShe cleared her throat before continuing. "We have performed a comprehensive investigation into her background, but after exhausting every archive, be they our own or the National Genealogy Institute, we have found no familial connections or ties." At Queen Oiren's piqued brow, Cara added, "It's as if she merely came to existance a few weeks ago.\n\n"Now, my Queen," the drone said, "you are free to see whomever you wish, but it would be remiss of me if I did not give you forewarning about this changeling. I would recommend you would forego this visit."\n\nQueen Oiren carefully regarded the matter." #Cara was hired
 greneclyf_sunderer.2.a:0 ""I am not one to doubt the GCS. Have the impostor arrested."" #Cara was not hired
 greneclyf_sunderer.2.b:0 ""What would some cartographers know about the Sunderer? I will see her."" #Cara was not hired

 greneclyf_sunderer.3.t:0 "The CPM's Protest"
 greneclyf_sunderer.3.d:0 "Another day, another bundle of letters found its way to the Queen's desk. Again, most of the enveloped papers didn't catch Oiren's eye, but one prominently stood out. On it was the CPM's red wax seal, and it immediately perked her attention; this was important.\n\nShe soon got to reading the republicans' message.\n\n"To Her Royal Highness,\n\n"We have received news through contacts about an upcoming visit to Blosmport and are highly concerned of the nature of said visitor. From our understanding and those of advisors, this appears to be nothing more than a confused and misguided soul at best or, at worst, a charlatan impersonating a beloved figure to gain something from Her Highness.\n\n"Though some of our coalition find it difficult to believe that Her Highness was not made aware of this possibility, we are extending our trust that this was the case and that You will correct this situation. However, should this not be the case, the CPM will consider taking action against the Crown, for we will not allow false mystics or babbling mental deficients in Her Majesty's government. We kindly ask Her Highness to have this "Sunderer" removed immediately.\n\n"With sincerest regards,\n\n"Cader Sclerite - CPM Head"\n\nQueen Oiren let out a slow breath. She had interacted with Sclerite enough to recognise that behind the diplomatic language, the threat was a promise were she not to acquiesce to the CPM's demands. Carefully regarding the words, Queen Oiren thought of an appropriate response:"
 greneclyf_sunderer.3.a:0 ""Sclerite is right, and I cannot afford to anger the republicans.""

 ### SUNDERER FLAVOUR ###

 greneclyf_sunderer_flavour.1.t:0 "Night Maritime Patrol"
 greneclyf_sunderer_flavour.1.d:0 "Aidan was irradiant with energy. Nighttime was never much of a hindrance for a changeling, but ever since harnessing the execrate from the local prisoner, his sight seemed to pierce even the thickest veil that the night brought. Such eagle-eyed vision was necessary for his current task as the primary observer of the third anti-aircraft gun of his destroyer. If Aidan did his job well, he'd spot an enemy aircraft well before it made itself heard.\n\nAs the ship went underway, he perked up once he spotted a black shape up high. He quickly brought his binoculars up, and sure enough, he recognised the fuselage, the kind typical of a medium bomber. Without hesitation, he mechanically barked, "Bomber, four o'clock! Two and a half kilometres!"\n\nImmediately, the gun crew sprang to motion. Aidan's fellow observer confirmed the target, and the operators got to work. The 37mm double-barreled gun swivelled in the given direction, and the barrels rose to meet the oncoming target. Shouts from other gun crews seemed to partly indicate confusion and surprise, but Aidan paid no heed; he was simply waiting for the target to come into range before ordering the gunner to open fire. Just a few more seconds and...\n\n"Hold fire!" the director yelled. "Hold your fire!"\n\nAnger welled up in Aidan's throat. Just as he was about to argue against his superior, he was instead met by a wrath even greater than his behind the director's scowl. "That's a civilian airliner, leading sealing!" He growled. "You almost opened fire on one of our own!"\n\nAidan's breath hitched. Looking again at the aircraft overhead through his binoculars, he spotted the Greneclyfian colours on the tail. They were so evident now... How had he not spotted them earlier?\n\n"I'll have your damned wings for breakfast, Sealing Aidan," the director said, seething with irritation. Suddenly feeling very sheepish, Aidan mumbled an apology, cursing himself. The wrath had dissipated slightly, and he could only wonder what other intrusive thoughts could lead him astray if he was not careful..."

Where the normal bureaucratic processes and institutional administrative procedures would be at least a nominal check on a leader's powers, the sheer willingness to defer all matters of state to the Sunderer makes the state an "adherent" autocracy and gives the Sunderer unchecked powers. All aspects of changeling society are so monolithic in this consensual conformity to the Sunderer that there is no such thing as a changeling opposition, much to her surprise.\n\nEffectively, the only opposition is borne from non-changelings as they are seen as the only possible threat to the state. However, compliance and adherence to the societal condition ensure a safe and prosperous place in this society of changeling primacy, promising an odd militarised utopia where not all are equal in status but can all live happy lives."

 ### NEWS EVENTS ###
 greneclyf_news.0.t:0 "The Coronation of the Greneclyfian Queen"
 greneclyf_news.0.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The highly-anticipated coronation ceremony has finally come, and Queen Gytha, daughter of Queen Nóra Mhic, was officially ordained as the successor to the Greneclyfian throne.\n\nThe coronation comes three weeks since the sudden and unexpected passing of the former Queen. In many ways, it is a seal to approve Queen Gytha's position that she had taken upon herself immediately upon her mother's absence. Some worry that the Queen's inexperience may worsen current tensions in the country, but the initial reaction of the populace has been one of relief and of hope.\n\nFor now, a sense of normalcy has returned upon the island."
 greneclyf_news.0.a:0 "Long may she reign!"

 greneclyf_news.0.d1:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]After weeks of confusion in Greneclyf following the sudden death of Queen Nóra Mhic, the former Queen's daughter Gytha has subsequently been fully ordained as Greneclyf's newest Queen.\n\nChief Cenhelm sent a congratulatory message to the Queen with tacit support to continue the Great Pacts. Most believe it to be primarily a formality. Still, some believe that Cenhelm, having offered support to Gytha during the Greneclyfians' time of crisis, might intend to pursue a closening of ties between our two nations.\n\nIn the meantime, most Farbrookians are glad to see our neighbours have overcome this difficult period of national strife."
 greneclyf_news.0.b:0 "We wish Queen Gytha luck in her endeavours."

 greneclyf_news.0.d2:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The news of Queen Gytha's coronation broke the silence from the island of Greneclyf following the sudden cessation of regular communication. It turns out that the previous queen, Nóra Mhic, had passed after some turmoil in the country.\n\nQueen Gytha has sent a communiqué temporarily abstaining from the duty of Protector of the Hillpony Tribes that her predecessor had taken on. Meanwhile, Farbrook has sent its well-wishes to the changelings, suggesting that they are open to closening ties between Greneclyf and the Hillpony region.\n\nFor the most part, our citizens seem to be hopeful that a stable Greneclyf will keep the region safe."
 greneclyf_news.0.c:0 "Though Farbrook does not speak for us all, we wish Greneclyf well."
 greneclyf_news.0.e:0 "Between a strong Greneclyf and Arcturian Order, peace shall endure."

 greneclyf_news.0.d3:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]We have received news by dispatch that the Greneclyfian Queendom has suffered through a period of unrest with the death of Queen Nóra Mhic. Subsequently, Queen Gytha, daughter of the previous queen, has ruled over the island and was only coronated recently.\n\nWe've also learnt that the Queendom's naval aspirations were dashed with the arrival of the new warships from Skyfall. The vessels in question proved to be costly and ultimately pointless, as they are utterly obsolete. Reports of a discontinued naval programme assuaged all concerns from members of our admiralty of a potential maritime rival."
 greneclyf_news.0.f:0 "Queen Nóra may have been playing with fire, but she didn't deserve such an end."

 greneclyf_news.0.d4:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]For some time, Greneclyf has been going through a state of national confusion with the death of Queen Nóra Mhic. Though her daughter, Queen Gytha, has taken charge almost immediately though has only now been anointed as the rightful ruler. The first message from the new Queen has been one for continued peace among our countries and a closening of ties between our peoples.\n\nThough the reaction from our citizens has been relatively muted, the few Greneclyfian changelings living within our borders have expressed relief over the resolution of the crisis in Greneclyf and hope for the future."
 greneclyf_news.0.g:0 "So the pack of bugs has a new alpha."
 greneclyf_news.0.h:0 "Good. Maybe now the changelings will stop whining."
 greneclyf_news.0.i:0 "Perhaps we could have done more for the Greneclyfians?"
 greneclyf_news.0.j:0 "I wonder how the new Queen will handle her mother's mess..."
 greneclyf_news.0.k:0 "Let us see the strength of the new Queen."
 greneclyf_news.0.l:0 "We shall look on with anticipation."
 greneclyf_news.0.m:0 "What will this new Queen bring to the table?"

 greneclyf_news.0.d5:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Word from the Hillpony tribes has come regaling the news that Queen Gytha, daughter of the Greneclyfian Queen Nóra Mhic, was anointed as the new monarch of Greneclyf.\n\nWith this news, we have also learned that the previous Queen had suddenly died, leading to several days of national confusion following public unrest.\n\nAs far as we can tell, the situation on the island has stabilised for the foreseeable future."
 greneclyf_news.0.n:0 "Business as usual, then?"

 greneclyf_news.0.d6:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Surprising news from the remote island of Greneclyf has reached Magehold. It appears that a new Queen has ascended the throne following a period of modernisation on the island. The last time anything of note happened with Greneclyf was the ill-fated expedition of Fidelis Maledictus, whose group disappeared without trace centuries ago.\n\nWe have also learned that the changelings have previously taken the role of protecting the Hillpony lands. However, this currently does not seem to be the case.\n\nRegardless, we may need to pay closer attention to further developments."
 greneclyf_news.0.o:0 "Where Fidelis failed, we'll succeed."

 
 ### STARTING CORONATION EVENTS ###
 greneclyf_start.0.t:0 "An Evening in Blosmport"
 greneclyf_start.0.d:0 "Things had since calmed down when Queen Nóra Mhic's corpse was recovered from Blosmport's newest canal. Though not all was truly well, at least Greneclyfians were not panicking over the existential threat of a leadership vacuum. There was a queen back on the throne, even if it was an uncrowned and young daughter. Despite all of her efforts to stabilise a nation in crisis, however, Gytha was still not seen as the 'true' Queen of Greneclyf. For nearly three weeks, the tradition was sidelined, but now the young queen could finally look forward to being coronated.\n\nUpon Gytha's desk was a mess of official reports and documents detailing the situation of the nation. Just a week prior, they told of a crisis; two weeks before, they seemed to herald an apocalypse, and Gytha barely knew what to do. Fortunately, she wasn't alone back then, and she wasn't now. A smile played on her lips as she looked upon Feilean, her older brother, mused thoughtfully over a document.\n\n"Sclerite and his CPM supporters have agreed to end their marches, despite his attack dog's calls for further action in Bugsmere and the capital." Feilean's eyes were heavy and yet alert all the same. They met Gytha's. "There's nothing else in the way, Gytha."\n\nGytha looked on hopefully. "Does that mean that we can finally proceed?" she asked tentatively.\n\n"It does," Feilean replied with a sharp nod. "The coronation can go ahead." He smiled softly as his sister slackened visibly in her seat. "There are still a few matters to go over, of course, but the remaining legwork now is straightforward."\n\nThe Queen sat up straighter, her breath hitching slightly at the thought of further delays. "What do I need to do?"\n\n"You?" Feilean asked with a raised eyebrow. When Gytha nodded, he chuckled. "Besides practising and making the official invitations, you may rest, Gytha dearest."\n\nGytha blinked. Was that it?"
 greneclyf_start.0.a:0 ""Perhaps I could do with some sleep...""

 greneclyf_start.1.t:0 "The Crowning of the New Queen"
 greneclyf_start.1.d:0 "It was grandiose: the chamber glittered with lights; royals and respected drones from all walks of life observed in quiet respect; the throne, spotless and immaculate, awaited its new occupant. Awaiting her was the throne and two old, withered-looking drones standing in between. The one on the left held the jewelled crown and the other a ceremonial urn. Much like Gytha, they wore simple, almost ragged white garbs. Theirs were somewhat more pristine than hers, but that was as it should be, for she would become, as tradition dictated, the newest representative of the Sunderer. As the praise singers ended their song, Gytha stopped short and knelt well below the two drones, eyes cast downwards.\n\nThe one on the right spoke first in a voice aged by decades. "Is Your Majesty willing to take the Oath?"\n\n"I am willing," Gytha responded solemnly.\n\n"Will you maintain and preserve unwaveringly?"\n\nGytha closed her eyes in respect and in anticipation. "I shall," she responded. Wordlessly, she felt a gentle hoof softly running along her horn as a coat of ash trailed behind the drone's touch.\n\n"Be your horn, anointed, with the Sunderer's form," enunciated the elderly drone as she finished her ritual. "As queens past were, so shall you, blessed and consecrated, be Queen over the peoples, in the name of Slána the Sunderer."\n\nPlaced upon Gytha's head was a silver circlet crown, and she finally rose to see both drones standing aside for her to take the throne. Gytha did her best not to think about what had happened to its previous occupant. Slowly, gingerly, she took her seat and beheld the chamber with as much authority as she could muster. Gytha recognised some faces from the crowd: her smiling brother, a neutral Queen Oiren, even Queen Cait Murchbagh and Dragon Snowy in their resplendent uniforms.\n\nAfter a pause and a short breath, the Queen of Greneclyf tilted her head upwards and spoke loud enough to create an echo:"
 greneclyf_start.1.a:0 ""Praise be to Greneclyf and to thee!""

 greneclyf_start.2.t:0 "Seeing to the CPM"
 greneclyf_start.2.d:0 "The coronation ceremony had barely finished when Queen Gytha and Feilean were once more in her office. The first order of business was a letter from the CPM, though that was to be expected.\n\n"What does it say?" Gytha asked her brother, though she suspected she already knew its contents.\n\n"They would like to know the Crown's plans now that we have an ordained queen back on the throne." Feilean's green eyes looked up from the letter. "There's particular emphasis on when these plans are meant to take effect."\n\nGytha nodded once. As her gaze wandered, she recalled the demands Sclerite and his party had demanded upon the Queen when her mother's corpse was still dripping wet.\n\nBanishing that morbid thought, she looked to Feilean. "Have you thought over what we've discussed before?"\n\n"I have," Feilean replied, offering her a smile, "and though there are some details to iron out, it's easily the best way forward, Gytha."\n\nGytha let out a slow breath. "Pass me a pen.""
 greneclyf_start.2.a:0 ""You may also want some coffee, Gytha. We'll be here for a while.""

 greneclyf_start.3.t:0 "The Letter from the Queen"
 greneclyf_start.3.d:0 "A hoof ran down Fennore's face. "For my sake, Cader," she said, speaking with an irritated grumble. "Go over what she wrote once more, and in simpler terms."\n\nStanding above Fennore and Eolan, Cader grimaced, peeved, before setting aside the letter in his magical grip. "The Queen wants to confer with the River Coalition nations to secure new treaties to protect Greneclyfian nationals and gain new financial ties."\n\n"How? By askin' them nicely?" Fennore blurted out, standing up from her seat. Before Cader could respond, she continued: "That'd be a sight! Our dope of a queen crawlin' to the dogs, or—" she laughed harshly "—or perhaps the Bakarans, askin' 'pretty please?' Does she really think it's as simple as that?" She looked to her companions for an answer. Eolan sat quietly, his expression betraying nothing but exhaustion. Cader's grimace, meanwhile, deepened.\n\n"I don't know how she'll do it," he admitted, "but she may know something we don't. She might well be able."\n\nFennore barked out a hollow laugh. "And pray tell, did she say when she thinks she'd achieve all o' this?"\n\n"The Queen believes that this can be done by the year, and—"\n\n"To Tartarus with that!" she stomped a hoof. "This won't work!"\n\nA tense silence followed as both Cader and Fennore stared each other down.\n\n"It just might," came the weathered voice of Eolan. As his two colleagues turned to him, he added, "Queen Nóra Mhic never tried to speak to the Coltstream properly, and they have been experiencing a period of economic growth." His eyes gleamed brightly behind his glasses. "It could work.""
 greneclyf_start.3.a:0 "Fennore stared back incredulously."

 greneclyf_start.4.t:0 "The Letter from the Queen"
 greneclyf_start.4.d:0 ""Are you bleedin' insane?" Fennore approached Eolan, raising her voice. "You can't trust the continentals to treat us right, let alone give us the time o' day to help us out!"\n\nThe elderly drone merely narrowed his eyes. "I didn't say that it'd be easy,  Ó Cuanáin," he said, his tone calm yet terse. "I am simply saying that should the Queen achieve it, it would dig the country out of its spiral."\n\n"In a year?" Fennore pointedly asked. "Most Greneclyfians can't afford to wait a year! We've made a promise to our people, and we must keep the Crown accountable!" She turned to face Cader. "She won't be able to do it."\n\nSclerite, for his part, only approached Fennore and placed a placating hoof on her shoulder. Her breathing quieted, and their eyes met. After a long moment, Cader spoke.\n\n"I understand, Fennie. I genuinely do. I haven't forgotten what you've suffered through in Bakara." Fennore's lips thinned at Cader's words as he continued. "The Queen's barely taken her mother's place. She's far more sincere in her attempts, even if she's inexperienced. We need to give her a chance. If she doesn't hold to her word..."\n\nHe shrugged, offering a small smile. "We'll manage it. I'm willing to give Queen Gytha a shot." Fennore tilted his head to Eolan. "So is Eolan. Are you ready to do the same?"\n\nFennore fell silent, mulling it over. She scowled and furrowed her brow before she gave a single, firm nod."
 greneclyf_start.4.a:0 ""Alright, I will. But only because I trust you, Cader.""

 greneclyf_start.5.t:0 "#TO BE ADDED: News from Bakara" #Don't like this title. Maybe you can come up with something?
 greneclyf_start.5.d:0 "#TO BE ADDED: Gytha reads a news article about something really bad happening to a Greneclyfian in Bakara and is, on an impulse, seriously considering implementing a ton of unnecessary red tape in order to "protect" changelings from being discriminated against. Feilean's there to remind her that the plan covers these issues, and assures her that it will work. She's calmed down, but the story of the abuse lingers in her mind."
 greneclyf_start.5.a:0 "We must trust in the plan."

 greneclyf_start.6.t:0 "The Coronation from the East"
 greneclyf_start.6.d:0 "Queen Chrysalis hummed in curious thought. She was about to finish reading today's Der Jäger edition when she spotted an eye-catching article titled: "CORONATION OF GRENECLYFIAN QUEEN". It took her a moment to recall which country this was, and when Chrysalis read the article in more detail, it came back to her.\n\nIt was the pathetic little island of changelings far in the West, off the eastern shores of Griffonia, who adhered to the nonsensical notions of harmony. Odd, since when had the previous Greneclyfian Queen died?\n\nThe answer was in the article, and Chrysalis had to let out a laugh. She killed herself in shame? What a joke! What a weakling! And now her 23-year-old daughter was 'elected' as Queen? Again, Chrysalis couldn't contain her laughter at the absurdity of putting a mewling nymph on the throne, by vote, no less!\n\nAs her laughs died down, the Queen mused on this. The last time she had received a communique from Greneclyf, it was a condemnation of her attack on Canterlot. She hadn't given much thought since she had many things occupying her mind. Perhaps now, this was an opportune moment to return the favour. It would be an amusing break from all the day's work that Chrysalis had to sort through."
 greneclyf_start.6.a:0 "She chose to call for a pen and an interpeter. Chrysalis had many 'compliments' to make..."
 greneclyf_start.6.b:0 "As cathartic as it would be, Chrysalis elected to focus on her work instead."

 greneclyf_start.7.t:0 "Queen Chrysalis's Letter"
 greneclyf_start.7.d:0 ""That witch of a Queen! That utter brute!" Gytha's furious pacing resounded loudly with the pounding of her hooves upon the office floor. "How dare that fiend Chrysalis besmirch my name or that of our mother, Feilean!?" she asked as she glared at the accursed letter that Feilean was reading.\n\nIn stark contrast to his younger sister's stormy mood, Feilean's was stone-faced, but Gytha, even in her rage, could taste his silent anger. "Chrysalis's words are nothing but that, Gytha," he said as he put down the communique from Chrysalis. "She is, as Mother used to say, nothing more than a savage lout who thinks of little else other than war and pettiness."\n\nFeilean's quiet voice irked Gytha. "This can't stand, Feilean!" She stomped her hoof. "We must respond to this. At once!"\n\nHer brother's eyes met hers, and he scowled slightly. A moment later, he said, "There's little point in issuing a diplomatic protest, but I believe we could—"\n\n"Boycott their goods," Gytha said suddenly. At Feilean's piqued eyebrows, she added, "No trade shall occur between Greneclyf and Chrysalis's lands so long as she is in power. It may not mean much to her, but our people must be reminded that the changelings over in Equus are no friends of ours despite our similarities."\n\nAfter a pregnant pause, Feilean bowed his head. "It will be done.""
 greneclyf_start.7.a:0 "No one can make light of the death of a loved one, not even a Queen!"

 greneclyf_start.8.t:0 "Greneclyf Embargoed Us"
 greneclyf_start.8.d:0 ""My Queen, there is a communique for you," a drone declared softly.\n\nQueen Chrysalis didn't bother to raise her eyes from the documents before her. "From whom and what does it say?" she asked, bored.\n\n"From the Greneclyfian Crown." Chrysalis's ears perked up at that response, and she looked up. "It is a declaration stating that the Greneclyfian state has prohibited any and all trade between our two nations and has closed their borders to us."\n\nChrysalis waited, expecting more from the communique. She leaned closer when nothing else came. "Is that all?"\n\n"There are a few veiled jabs at our country and you, my Queen, but nothing that merits your attention."\n\nShe nodded slowly. "And we don't import anything from Greneclyf, right?" When the drone shook his head no, Chrysalis nodded again and returned to her documents. "Very well. No further actions are to be taken against them for now."\n\nThe drone bowed and promptly left, leaving Chrysalis in her mound of work. She chuckled softly at the image of the Greneclyfian Queen wailing in frustration just because of a few written words about her dead mother."

 greneclyf_start.9.t:0 "Queen Gytha's Birthday" #Written by Ardent, edited by King
 greneclyf_start.9.d:0 "The 10th of January had arrived with the dedicated holiday in full swing since dawn, and many a changeling from hive and countryside had swarmed to Blosmport: the hosting city for the national celebration. Throughout the royal palace grounds, Greneclyf's colours fluttered to the fanfare of young changelings, who buzzed playfully about the halls of chatter from the older ones drinking. Sweet melodies playing from the little orchestra of flutes, violins, harps, and soft drums gave everything a pleasant regality to the whole affair, and the annual celebration of traditions old was embraced by everyone—everyone but the one changeling it all was dedicated for.\n\nGytha poured her eyes over yet another missive reporting information collected from the Riverlands. The Queen wanted to spare no big or small detail in her approach for Greneclyf befriending the mainland. So arduously caught up in her planning, Gytha hadn't even noticed her brother's entry into her bedroom until he closed the door, but even then, she merely acknowledged him with only a glance.\n\n"Gytha, you've been in here all morning," Feilean said. "It's nearly noon, and Greneclyf's Queen has yet to appear at her own birthday festival."\n\n"There'll be another one next year." Gytha huffed. "What wont be is another chance for us to make an official first impression with the Riverland governments.""\n\nFeilean withheld a sigh and approached. "More reason to go out there, if anything. Don't you think the experience of mingling and having fun with others would help your chances of making a friend of the Riverlands?" Gytha opened her mouth to respond to his words, but her eyes widened, and she creased her lips shut. Feilean watched her silently sit, mulling to herself, smiling at last when he saw Gytha slowly leave her desk. Happily, he held the door open for her, and Gytha hesitantly followed Feilean to her birthday festival.\n\n"Everyone deserves to at least enjoy themselves on their birthday.""
 greneclyf_start.9.a:0 "And enjoy it she did."

 greneclyf_start.10.t:0 "Lá an Tearmann" #Day of Refuge - Written by Ardent, edited by King
 greneclyf_start.10.d:0 "Given how dark some wintery days could get, it came to no one's surprise that solace could be found in the most unusual of places with the most peculiar of people. Nothing embodied this more in the northern reaches of the world than the annually honoured Anniversary of the Frozen Refuge, where all on Greneclyf commemorated the wonderful day when the hives of yore were given love by mainlanders; the Farbrookian hillponies, to be exact. All from far and near were welcomed to the anniversary's celebrations on the island in the spirit of sharing and caring in the dark north, though few other than the hillponies ever partook.\n\nSuch lovely celebrations tended to take place in the lighted harbour areas of Blosmport, where the mainlanders could immediately be swamped by the festive changelings upon arrival. Yet even with the music and drinks aplenty, everycreature could feel the unspoken apprehension nipping in the frigid air, thanks to the Queen's proclamation of officially reaching out to the Riverlands.\n\n"Sure hope the Queen knows what she's doing," a changeling drone said before gulping his shot of love-infused whiskey. His two other drinking companions seated next to him nodded.\n\nThe hillpony slugged the large shoulder beside her with a hoof. "Care to wager the odds?"\n\n"Hrmgh," the last of the trio muttered. "I left Diamond Mountain for a reason." He drank a long sip from the glass in his paw, and the three resumed the silence. Being sailors, they each had some familiarity with the Riverland nations, and all three knew just how challenging they could be. The River Coalition barely held as is, in spite of its growing dysfunctions, and now the island was aiming to open up to it. Everything of the future, their own livelihoods, was... dangerously uncertain.\n\nThe three of them continued sitting at the bar in ruminating silence until the diamond dog chuffed and raised his glass to them. The changeling drone and hillpony stirred from their stupors and joined the toast."

 ### SPY GAME EVENTS ###
 greneclyf_spy_game.0.t:0 "An Unexpected Offer" #Ardent and King both busy with things at the same time lmao
 greneclyf_spy_game.0.d:0 ""What is this about, Feilean? It's the middle of the night." Gytha only received a brief assurance from her brother, who led them both into the throne hall. All was serenely quiet at this late hour, but the Queen soon noticed in the nearly too peaceful room that no other changeling was present. No sentry on guard nor bureaucrat in sight. It was only herself, her brother... and the lone changeling drone in a striking yellow dress sitting in wait before the throne. Whatever was happening, it was clearly meant to occur in secret.\n\n"Your Highness." The changeling bowed courteously, her voice respectful and humble. Gytha returned the greeting, looking to her brother for an explanation.\n\nFeilean was prompt. "This is Cara, the head of the Greneclyfian Cartographers' Society. They wish to offer their assistance with our efforts in the Riverlands." The simple explanation only brought about more questions.\n\n"Our cartographers have accumulated much understanding of the Riverland nations, as well as others across the continent," Cara explained, "and with official approval and funds, the Greneclyfian Cartographers' Society is more than ready to offer its resources as an agency to aid in your outreach efforts and guarantee the results desired."\n\n"Subterfuge," Gytha said, her voice gaining an edge. "You wish me to approve going against my clann's philosophy for changelings' innate abilities. Why should I consider even approving this?"\n\nCara's smile remained, but her eyes hinted at something else. "Unfavourable circumstances and a rise of dangerous situations all over the continent have unfortunately made it necessary. I tell you this with truth, my Queen, and the truth is that there are dire times ahead for Greneclyf. The direction you wish for our homeland to take is noble and what I and all in our organisation support in full, but few in the Riverlands trust Greneclyf as is. Without some sort of guarantee, it is too likely that Greneclyf's efforts for friendship will be rebuked if not outright taken advantage of."\n\nThe seriousness in Cara's words continued to puncture the silence in the throne hall, only backed further by Feilean's sigh and resigned nod. Moments passed as Gytha thought everything over and through until she finally made her decision known."
 greneclyf_spy_game.0.a:0 ""We can't afford to be betrayed again. Make the necessary preparations.""
 greneclyf_spy_game.0.b:0 ""And risk betraying what little trust we have? We can't do this.""
 greneclyf_spy_game.0.c:0 ""Actually, I've been thinking...""

 greneclyf_spy_game.1.t:0 "A Visit to Bugsmere"
 greneclyf_spy_game.1.d:0 "Deep within the hive of Bugsmere amid its historical district, Feilean entered a museum undergoing rapid transformation, doing well to avoid obstructing the flow of drones working. He would have an accessible report to Gytha confirming the funds were being used correctly from the intensity he saw. However, the royal was still amazed by the rate of progress they were managing in such a place filled with ancient artefacts and incredibly delicate trinkets.\n\n"It seems everything is to your liking so far." Cara joined his side and observed the ongoing reconstruction, her yellow dress as refined as before. "I must again express the gratitude of the Greneclyfian Cartographers' Society for both you and Queen Gytha agreeing to this. Additional facilities and materials here will help us considerably with achieving Greneclyf's ambitions."\n\nFeilean inspected a nearby glass case containing an artefact. "Yes, though it is rather peculiar for cartographers wanting to involve themselves with national security..." His irises inquisitively glanced over to the changeling beside him, who continued watching the construction.\n\nCara's demeanour didn't change in the slightest. "The average Greneclyfian does not need to be part of our Society to see the dangerous changes arising in the Riverlands, though being some of the most observant and meticulous in the field of cartography does make change all the more noticeable to us."\n\n"I see," Feilean said with a hum. "I suppose there's a strong amount of irony in the idea of Greneclyf being thankful for whatever had driven its best mappers toward this endeavour, though." He could've sworn he had almost heard something akin to a laugh quickly smothered behind her quaint smile and words.\n\n"One could interpret it that way, but the more accurate truth is that the Greneclyfian Cartographers' Society admittedly has a very long memory thanks to the history it collects, and the island has shown a repeated past of struggles whenever it has reached out."\n\nFeilean turned back to the artefact he had been inspecting before: a beyond-weathered carving fragment depicting a dressed changeling playing with what appeared to be breezies. With another hum, he stowed his curiosity and simply monitored the construction with Cara."
 greneclyf_spy_game.1.a:0 ""Let's hope we can finally break that cycle.""

 greneclyf_spy_game.2.t:0 "The Greneclyfian Cartographers' Society is Ready"
 greneclyf_spy_game.2.d:0 "Gytha was finally given a grand tour of the institution, impressively remodelled to serve as the fully transformed Greneclyfian Cartographers' Society headquarters. The GCS and all of its members now served as an official agency on behalf of the state, and the renovations certainly did show for it. She and her brother had received the invitation to tour the finished work, which had brought her to Cara, who graciously showed them every passage and area that had been built, publicly and secretly.\n\nThough even as their guide introduced her to the many GCS agents that would be operating, Gytha still couldn't shake off the gut feeling of how wrong everything felt. The ideas of subterfuge, the manipulation training, the infiltration methods for each country, and the plans to guarantee acceptance —especially the programs to guarantee acceptance— all felt wrong. The Queen managed to press through the tour with the best etiquette she could muster, but when it was just Cara, Feilean, and herself that remained in the public hall, Gytha made her distaste known with a heavy sigh and groan.\n\n"We are doing this for Greneclyf," her brother assured her.\n\n"Yes, but it still feels disingenuous. We are building the future of our homeland upon our broken principles."\n\n"Rest assured, my Queen, the GCS will do everything it can within its power to abide by your wishes," Cara added. "I can promise that I and the operatives I introduced today are more than skilled enough to accomplish their missions without crossing more unethical boundaries."\n\nHer reservations still held, but Cara's words did help. Gytha took a deep breath and composed herself."
 greneclyf_spy_game.2.a:0 ""For Greneclyf, for everycreature, and for friendship.""

 greneclyf_spy_game.3.t:0 "Refusing the Offer"
 greneclyf_spy_game.3.d:0 "The Queen's words caused Feilean to shift his posture in slight surprise. Cara distantly sighed and regarded the decision. "Are you sure about this?"\n\n"Yes, our relationships in the Riverlands must be built upon love, not deception," Gytha said. Uncertainty of the future thrummed all about her decision, but the core of her principles taught by her clan's doctrine held and gave her conviction. "I won't have Greneclyfians' intent for genuine friendship betrayed by manipulations." She glanced down at her brother sharply. "That you'd even considered this..."\n\nFeilean flickered his wings and brought himself to eye level. "I considered this because of your wish for an authentic friendship, Gytha. The honesty and truth in our outreach could amount to nothing if the Riverlands simply reject it."\n\nA forced cough interrupted the argument, bringing Feilean back to the ground and drawing Gytha away from her sudden fears. Cara straightened her yellow dress and gave them a curtsy. "The morning will be here soon. I shall respect your decision, your Highness, but you can rest assured knowing that the Greneclyfian Cartographers' Society will always lend its assistance when needed."\n\nGytha paused before tacitly thanking the cryptic changeling, who, in turn, smiled and departed, leaving the Queen, her brother, and the fate of Greneclyf's principled efforts to chance. A long silence passed in the hall before Gytha breathed a shaky sigh, earning a gentle hoof from Feilean on her shoulder."
 greneclyf_spy_game.3.a:0 ""Gytha, are you sure about this?""

 greneclyf_spy_game.4.t:0 "Rethinking Everything"
 greneclyf_spy_game.4.d:0 "Cara blinked, her stoic expression remained unchanged. "Are you sure, your Majesty?"\n\nQueen Gytha was sure. Her conviction only grew as the memory of reading about that poor Greneclyfian returned in force. She nodded resolutely.\n\nThe drone held her pose for a moment longer before curtsying. "Remember," Cara offered, "my services and those of the GCS are always available, your Highness."\n\nBy the time she had left, Feilean had quirked an eyebrow. "What was that about a different idea?" His tone had gained a worrisome edge.\n\n"I've changed my mind," Gytha stated, forcefully keeping her cool. "We'll do what we should have done far earlier."\n\n"The protections thing?" Feilean's voice grew terse. At her nod, he almost snarled. "I already told you that will do nothing to help our people!"\n\nA loud, reverberating hoof stomp clamped up Feilean. He was about to argue when he tasted the grief emanating from the Queen. Voice cracking, she exclaimed, "I am! And I can't believe it took me hearing about plans to infiltrate the Riverlands!" Gytha's glare intently bore into her brother. "I will set things right, as per our clan's teachings, Feilean."\n\nOnce she stormed off, Feilean was left alone, nearly speechless."
 greneclyf_spy_game.4.a:0 ""Gytha, what's gotten into you?""

 greneclyf_spy_game.5.t:0 "A Restless Night"
 greneclyf_spy_game.5.d:0 "#TO BE ADDED: After announcing her gear shift, the CPM is fucking furious with Gytha and the protests return with a vengeance. All attempts to reason with the CPM and protesters are in vain and even Gytha's finding herself isolated from her own brother. Slowly, mournfully, she wonders if she just doesn't have the temperament to BE a Queen."
 greneclyf_spy_game.5.a:0 ""Perhaps... I shouldn't be Queen?""

 greneclyf_spy_game.99.t:0 "Cara's Personal Visit"
 greneclyf_spy_game.99.d:0 "Gytha's eyes widened in surprise when she saw the irritatingly familiar yellow dress cross the threshold into her office. The Headling of the GCS, Cara, had just appeared as if she hadn't been dismissed—she had even begun to rattle off a report after a polite greeting! The Queen's mood soured as soon as the shock faded, and she outright asked Cara, "What are you doing here?"\n\nThe little drone stopped and looked up with her large eyes with an almost quizzical expression before she smiled softly. "Ah, right. Perhaps my prior letter didn't reach you." Her horn lit up with magic as she fished out another document from her bag. "I don't believe you were fully informed of the conditions and terms of my employment and services rendered to you. You'll find everything in there."\n\n"But I..." Gytha's protest immediately died as she began to skim the document—a contract. "Thus neither the agreement nor the employment may be terminated or voided without the consent of an officialised third party jury..." She met Cara's eyes. "And who would be the third party jury?"\n\nThe drone's smile remained pleasant, if perhaps a bit off. "Why, that would be the CGS's leadership. You can find a list of names on page twelve."\n\n"That's a conflict of interest!" Gytha interjected. "There's no way that this can be legal!"\n\nCara merely shook her head. "I'm afraid to say that it is. There are no legal recourses for this. I will serve you and the country even if you wish me out of your cabinet." Her grin grew ever slighter as Gytha felt legally powerless. Funny, did her fangs always glisten so brightly? Cara stared at nowhere in particular as she spoke aloud:"
 greneclyf_spy_game.99.a:0 ""I kindly ask you to stop trying to get rid of me.""

 greneclyf_trade.2.d:0 "It is clear that Greneclyf must put it's best hoof forwards in the coming days if we are ever going to extend our influence beyond our island and Farbrook. As such, there is much to worry about: logistics, routes, ships, and volunteers. Without these, we will not go far, so nothing must be left to chance.\n\nThese preparations will take time, but they are necessary to ensure that nothing will go wrong."
 greneclyf_trade.2.a:0 "There is much work to do."

 greneclyf_trade.3.t:0 "The Start of the Great Expeditions"
 greneclyf_trade.3.d:0 "The noon sun is shining high in the sky; the ships are all prepared to cast off; the intrepid sailors, ambassadors and other officials of Greneclyf stand proudly to the ovation of the cheering multitudes; the day has finally arrived.\n\nDelegates from the Royal Houses and Queen Gytha herself are present to see off these brave changelings, and a rousing speech from Gytha moves many in the crowds —and more than a few of the ship crews— to joyful tears. After a lavish ceremony, all eyes were upon the departing vessels as they left port waters.\n\nWe can expect some of them to return within a few weeks, whereas the others will take far longer to bring back a response. Regardless, we will be waiting with for their return with gleeful anticipation."
 greneclyf_trade.3.a:0 "A glorious day!"

 greneclyf_trade.4.t:0 "A Delegation from Greneclyf"
 greneclyf_trade.4.d:0 "A ship from Greneclyf has arrived at Farbrook, filled to the brim with changelings. This in it of itself was strange, as traffic from the isle is usually no more than a few fishing vessels, but the fact that many political and governmental representatives were onboard was telling. Port authorities were immediately approached by these Greneclyfians, requesting an immediate audience with [Root.GetLeader].\n\nThe head delegate, speaking in Queen Gytha's name, has informed us of a shift in Greneclyf's policy regarding the treatment of its citizens over on the continent. Most of their concerns aren't directed to Farbrook itself, however they are asking for a concentrated effort on our path to ensure equal treatment of changelings under the guise of a trade deal, in the hopes to set a friendly tone abroad in the River Coalition.\n\nThough some of the long-term objectives are somewhat ambitious, the short-term goal to enrichen our currently stale trade is a very realistic one, and Farbrookians already consider their Greneclyfian neighbours as equals.\n\nThe Greneclyfian diplomat stands before you, waiting for your response."
 greneclyf_trade.4.a:0 "We shall honour our friends' wishes."

The crew and passengers arrived with the good and expected news of Farbrook's acceptance with our proposal.

 greneclyf_trade.7.t:0 "Greneclyf Awaits an Answer"
 greneclyf_trade.7.d:0 "We have done what we could to postpone the question, but the Greneclyfian diplomat has made a final demand: we must give him an answer regarding his request for the protection of Greneclyfian citizens within our borders and of his trade offer. Otherwise, he will take our silence as a refusal.\n\nWhat shall be our official response?"
 greneclyf_trade.7.a:0 "We shall honour our friends' wishes."

 greneclyf_trade.8.d:0 "The ship to Farbrook has finally returned, though with bad news. Despite our efforts, Farbrook has refused our request. In addition, while it wasn't explicitely stated, we can assume that the Great Pacts are no longer in effect, and that our friendship has ended."

 greneclyf_trade.9.t:0 "Farbrook Breaks off Relations"
 greneclyf_trade.9.d:0 "We have finally gotten word back from Farbrook, but a stunned diplomat has returned to tell us of an utter cessation of all ties, official or otherwise, between our nations. The news have spread quickly, and a general sense of sorrow has gripped the hearts of many of our people, as many have friends over in Farbrook.\n\nThe Queen has done her best to calm down the populace, but despite her insistence otherwise, she too has suffered from the loss of her own relationship."
 greneclyf_trade.9.a:0 "Have they lost their minds?!"

 greneclyf_trade.10.t:0 "Changelings Wish to Trade"
 greneclyf_trade.10.d:0 "Greneclyfian changelings, ancient creatures capable of shapeshifting and emotivores, arrived upon our shores with the both an offer and a request. Hailing from the island to our North-West, these insectoid ponies have come with urgent request to open up trade routes as part of a national effort to promote Harmonic elements in their society. In addition, they wish to for the Greneclyfians already residing within our lands to be protected from discrimination.\n\nOn the one hoof, they're changelings who shouldn't be trusted, as per the old mares' tales, especially due to their naval build-up from years prior. On the other hoof, we have had any incidents with those currently residing in Bakara, and their navy is obsolete and no real threat to ours.\n\nWe could garner some good trade from Greneclyf while promising their citizens the same protections as of those given to our own."
 greneclyf_trade.10.a:0 "Our Republic protects all within our borders. We agree."

 greneclyf_trade.12.t:0 "Bakara Refuses"
 greneclyf_trade.12.d:0 "Our envoy to Bakara returned home today to give the unfortunate news of rejection. Despite our earnest attempts to sway them, the leadership there refused to agree to our requests. Among their grievances was their concern about our previous naval build-up which they believe that was meant to threaten their naval dominance. Our envoy's dismissal was curt as it was blunt."

 greneclyf_trade.13.d:0 "Some sudden news came today in the form of ships hoisting a flag of unknown origin landing in port under the guise of peace. Aboard these weaponless convoys were the changelings of Greneclyf. This is not our first encounter of these creatures, and we have seen their ilk among Nimbusia. They came offering iron and steel along with their own brand of textile products in exchange for our own goods. They seem harmless enough..."
 greneclyf_trade.13.a:0 "They're completely harmless, and Nimbusia could always have more friends than enemies."

This would involve an exchange of merchants and goods.\n\nWe have of course heard about their kind before, and while these particular changelings come bearing gifts, might perhaps be all a ruse. Maybe they've managed to fool the other member states that they were friendly, or perhaps these Greneclyfians truly wish to just be friends.\n\nHow should we respond?"

 greneclyf_trade.22.t:0 "Bug Things from Greneclyf"
 greneclyf_trade.22.d:0 "We've recently received an envoy from the islander bug ponies off the coast.

 greneclyf_trade.29.d:0 "Curiously enough, strange creatures of myth called changelings have arrived in the capital today. Knowledge of them exists primarily in orally passed down campfire tales of love-draining shapeshifters with sinister intent. While these stories are actually true about them...the ones who've come today have done so in peace. In fact they've shown the utmost respect and have come in their origin form as well. No reports of trouble or other misdeeds either after their arrival...perhaps they're genuine enough. \n\nRegardless the bugs have come with the desire to open up trade routes between Wittenburg and "Greneclyf", their island home. Aside from generic products such as iron, steel, and textiles...the bugs, these 'changelings' have made the interesting offer to exchange magical knowledge. Apparently the lore of changelings is vastly unknown as...we have no records on it. Perhaps this is a gold mine that has fallen right onto our lap? Then again...we know for sure the true nature of these creatures is naturally malicious. This could easily be nothing more than a show they're putting up to infiltrate our ranks..."

This new approach goes hoof in hoof with the apparent Greneclyfian desire to follow the aspects of Harmony. To start with, they merely want to begin exchanging textiles in the form of trade."

 ### TRADE CRISIS EVENTS ###
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.3.t:0 "Greneclyfian Apprehended and Accused of Grievous Crime"
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.3.d_BAK:0 "A merchant in Bakara was apprehended by local authorities under suspicion of having killed a local pony in the port town of Iceband. Reports are mixed, but what is certain is that a Bakaran is dead, and our citizen was found using their form as a disguise.\n\nWhile witnesses (of which none were present at the moment of the alleged crime) claim that the changeling had purposefully murdered a pony to assume their form and begin a murder spree, the accused said that they had acted in self defense, and that they had taken over their form in a panic upon realising that the aggressor was dead.\n\nIn either case, there is considerable revanchism on the side of Bakara calling for the head of our merchant. Where do we officially stand on this matter?"
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.3.d_DMT:0 "Grave news from Dit-Kazaar on the continent: a Greneclyfian citizen is currently incarcerated awaiting trial for murder.\n\nWhat exactly has happened is unclear, but the local authorities claim that the suspect was found loitering near a murder scene. When prodded for further evidence implicating him, we were given a prompt reply of 'he looks like he did it.'\n\nNeedless to say, our citizen insists that he happened to have been wandering nearby when the police had discovered the body of the victim, though so far his pleads of innocence have fallen upon deaf ears. None of the local residents have spoken up in his defense, and most are convinced of his guilt despite the lack of hard evidence. Our people are aghast at the blatant display of injustice, so they look to us for a response."
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.3.d_NIM:0 "From the nation of pegasi, Nimbusia, comes saddening news. One of our own was jailed and is awaiting trial for murder. The incident has caused a stir amongst the ponies, who were already going against their usual xenophobia by letting Greneclyfan merchants trade in their country. Now even most of the pro-harmony reformists have lost confidence in our species.\n\nBoth the changeling and the victim were allegedly travelling towards some sort of sacred city for the Nimbusians by the name of Prancetras. Friends of our subject say that he got curious after hearing stories of an oracle who lives there, however, shortly before the changeling reached the city, he encountered the victim, a pegasus citizen. Whatever transpired there ended with a dead pegasus and our subject assuming the identity of the pony he just killed. Of course he was found out soon afterwards and was arrested by the Nimbusian authorities.\n\nThe changeling has sworn that it was in fact the pegasus who attacked him, but testimonies by the victim's family and friends say the victim was an honourable citizen and a veteran too, making the Nimbusians skeptical towards his testimony. This case is turning into a nightmare for Nimbusian-Greneclyfian relations. Do we believe our citizen's story or do we back the Nimbusian authorities to save face?"
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.3.d_FRE:0 "In Pònaidhean, one of the more quiet nations in the Riverlands, one of our subjects seems to have made a grave error. While travelling through the Pònaidhean hinterlands, one of our merchants got caught unawares by heavy rainfall. Luckily for him, he could take shelter in a cave, ignoring the strange stone slab with inscriptions on it that stood before the cave's entrance. Through the storm, two monks also traversed the same path as the changeling. When the monks walked past the cave, they saw the changeling's glowing eyes staring at them. A few seconds later, our citizen was overwhelmed and dragged out of the cave and the monks were shouting at him in an unknown language.\n\nIt turns out our subject ventured into a cave where an evil 'demon' was supposedly sealed away. Entering this cave is a grievous offence and extremely suspicious to the pious Pònaidheans. The Taoiseach of Pònaidhean has asked us for our opinion, stating that she is willing to believe this was a misunderstanding, but that letting the changeling go now may mean that the clans in her country vote for restrictions on trade with Greneclyf in the future..."
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.3.a:0 "Plead for our citizen! They've done nothing wrong."
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.3.b:0 "Say nothing. We should let them deal with it."
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.3.c:0 "Insist on extraditing them to be tried at home."
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.3.e:0 "Offer our full support to the local investigation."

 greneclyf_trade_crisis.5.t:0 "Rumours Spread about our People"
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.5.d:0 "The trial of one of our own has been noticed throughout the Riverlands. More and more reports are coming in of incidents of flat-out racism against our kind, and more Riverland companies refused cooperation with Greneclyf for reasons we suspect to be because of our race. Our citizens are looking to us for instructions. Some even openly ask if they should give up on friendship with the Riverlands entirely.\n\nFour options are available to us and careful consideration must be made for the safety of our people and our relations with the continentals. We could tell our people to be on guard, although this may make Greneclyfians seem suspicious. We could ask them to be friendlier and patient with those giving them a hard time, to show them our good side. We could also advise our people to consider returning home if they feel threatened, but this may be seen as giving up. Lastly, we could refuse to change course at all."
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.5.a:0 "Our people must carry on with a stiff upper lip"
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.5.b:0 "Do unto them as we would have them do to us."
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.5.c:0 "Be vigilant and safe. Our people must stay wary."
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.5.e:0 "Offer safe passage back to Greneclyf to those who desire it."

 greneclyf_trade_crisis.6.t:0 "Greneclyfian Goods Boycotted"
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.6.d:0 "Previously, some of our merchants in the continent had claimed that the Riverlanders were deliberately avoiding to do business with them due to suspected racism. It was a side effect back then, but now people are actively refusing to purchase in our stores abroad. Many of our people have also been refused service in local shops, lending further credence that this is a concentrated effort.\n\nAs a result, our people are reporting losses that will eventually push them out of the markets on the continent if they are not addressed. Many of our merchants have called for retaliatory boycotts back at home, even though by all accounts foreign traders have been keeping perfectly fair and legal activities in Greneclyf. Some have suggested to show good will on our part by subsidising our people's purchases of local goods in the continent, whereas others advise to simply help our traders there to recoup their losses.\n\nWhat should we tell our people?"
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.6.a:0 "Help our people purchase the goods of the locals."
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.6.b:0 "Cover the losses that our merchants are suffering."
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.6.c:0 "Impose boycotts against foreign businesses in Blosmport."
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.6.e:0 "...maybe our merchants are doing poorly because they're no good?"
 
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.7.t:0 "Riverlands Trial of Greneclyfian Fuels Paranoia"
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.7.d_BAK:0 "After many days behind closed doors, an utterly confused Greneclyfian was freely released by the authorities.\n\nIt is impossible to say why or how he was cleared of his accusations, as he was never a part of the proceedings between the Bakaran monks who deliberated the matter.\n\nWhilst our citizen was glad to be set free, many Bakarans were not. As he was being judged, orators in major cities repeated the story of the alleged crime, embellishing and adding further heinous acts with each retelling. By the time he was released, none of the Bakarans could believe that the monster that they had continously heard about was set free, and was chased away from the scene.\n\nNeedless to say, we have already sent our official protests to the Bakaran government, though our representatives there expect little sympathy from it."
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.7.d_DMT:0 "A furious representative from Diamond Mountain stormed into the home of our on-site diplomat, soldiers in tow, demanding the whereabouts of the accused from last month. Apparently, the defendant fled from his confinement and has not been seen since the previous night.\n\nOur diplomat of course refuted any part in the defendant's escape and offered a stern condemnation of their actions, but in private has expressed relief over the matter. The few times that the accused had been seen by his fellow Greneclyfians, it was in a dungeon under horrendous conditions. What little food was given was woefully inadequate, and the last time a close friend saw him, the jailed changeling was severely emanciated. It is little wonder that he has escaped his confinement in light of the circumstances.\n\nDespite our official condemnation of the defendant's escape, many diamond dogs were left convinced that there was no way that he had managed to do so unaided, and are now eyeing other Greneclyfians with suspicion."
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.7.d_NIM:0 "The reformist party had collected some money to buy a decent attorney for the changeling on trial in Nimbusia. The trials in the country were quite populist affairs, however, and our subject was already disadvantaged by being both a foreigner and a changeling. Still, the pegasus attorney delivered a flaming speech arguing that there was absolutely no evidence for the murder, pointing out that his client was unarmed and a weapon was found on the body of the dead pegasus. The lawyer of the victim countered by a gross depiction of stereotypes. The attorney played the crowd and fed their fears of the unknown. Despite no evidence that the changeling was actually guilty, the jury of citizens deemed the evidence substantive enough, referring to our subject as the "insectoid monster."\n\nThe trial continued to the second phase, where both the accused and the accuser got to propose a punishment. The defense attorney, under pressure and cornered by the mood of the crowd, decided to push for banishment, while the attacker pleaded for the death penalty. Thanks to the excellent oration of our lawyer, our citizen narrowly escaped death, with the attorney convincing just enough ponies to let the changeling leave, without his possessions, of course. Although our subject escaped Nimbusia with his life, opinions towards changelings in Nimbusia have soured even more."
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.7.d_FRE:0 "In Dail Mhòr, the court proceedings took place against the changeling accused for trespassing and summoning a demon. With the law system separated by Pònaidhean tribe, the Taoiseach had no choice but to make the changeling a temporary honourary member of her own clan. With that, the framework of laws was set.\n\nOur subject was helpless against the clan elders and the monks who acted as witnesses. Most of the court proceedings happened in a language our citizen couldn't even understand and nopony offered him legal counsel. The crimes of the changeling were extremely exaggerated by the elders in the end, as they seemed to truly believe that if the monks hadn't stopped him, the accused would have unleashed a terrible spirit. So, they gave the changeling a sentence of being taken in at a monastery for three years or until he came to repent his demonic past, whichever came later. Without any proper way of defending himself, our subject was dragged off to some forgotten mountaintop, forced into the Pònaidheans' weird religious institutions."
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.7.a:0 "There is nothing to do but wait and see what happens next..."
 
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.8.t:0 "Rumours Snake Through the Riverlands"
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.8.d:0 "Ever since the infamous trial of the Greneclyfian changeling, rumours have been spreading about the changelings already present within the whole of the Riverlands. All member races of the Riverlands, both dog and pony, have begun treating them as if they were monsters: cruel, uncaring and ravenous. These rumours are scaring the population all across the Coalition, and relations with the changelings are, as of result, rapidly deteriorating. There are already scattered reports of hate crime related atrocities being committed against Greneclyfians, although these are, thankfully, relatively few and far between as of yet.\n\nThere has been no official response from the island nation as of yet, but it will almost certainly be unfavourable."
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.8.a:0 "Our citizens' well-being matters more than the feelings of some bugs'."
 
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.8.t:0 "Violent Clashes"
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.8.d:0 "While overall disdain held towards our people has dissipated, there are groups of continentals in certain parts of the Riverlands that actively seek out our people to harrass. These roving bands of thugs have prompted some of our citizens to ignore our previous instructions and actively engage them with their own ad-hoc groups. Fortunately these confrontations haven't caused any deaths, but there has been at least one critical injury so far.\n\nOur representatives have been drowning in protests from the respective governments regarding the behaviour of our changelings, promising dire consequences if the matter isn't addressed promptly and in a satisfactory manner. Our diplomats are looking to us for a formal response."
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.8.a:0 "Their people started it! They share the brunt of the blame!"
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.8.b:0 "Both sides are equally at fault. We'll chastise our own if they chastise theirs."
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.8.c:0 "We're better than this! We'll punish the changelings who actively sought violence."
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.8.e:0 "What do they expect us to do? We have no authority in the Riverlands."

 greneclyf_trade_crisis.24.t:0 "Greneclyfians Forced to Abandon the Continent"
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.24.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, the continentals couldn't shake free of their preconceived perceptions of us, and have let their fears lash out at our people. They've endured for many weeks, but there has been no end in sight to the prejudice suffered at the hooves of our people. Ships laden with changelings have returned to Greneclyf seeking respite from the terrible treatment abroad. Unfortunately, these same changelings took out their anger at the continentals who willingly came here.\n\nThe recently inaugurated merchant district in Blosmport was mobbed by the returning merchants and adventurers, actively attacking ponies who were only guilty by association. There were no reported deaths from the clashes, but many were injured, some severely, and the entire district was utterly devastated by ransacking and looting.\n\nOnce the news returned on the continent, we were issued an ultimatum by the entire Coalition: leave their lands and never return.\n\nWith no other choice, we had to acquiesce to their demands and end our official relations with a sour note. People in Greneclyf are now seriously questioning the entire endeavour that [Root.GetLeader] had launched into the continent, as well what must be done in order to move forward in the world.\n\nAre we truly without merit in the eyes of the foreigners?"
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.24.a:0 "But... but I did the right thing... didn't I?"

 greneclyf_trade_crisis.25.t:0 "Tensions Fade in the Riverlands"
 greneclyf_trade_crisis.25.d:0 "After punishing the Greneclyfians responsible for inciting violence, there has been a tense if calm period within our communities in the continent. Many of the violent locals have either been arrested by the authorities or have been shamed into submission by the majority of Riverlanders. It appears that we have finally defeated the caricature that had been placed upon us, and have earned if not amiable admiration, at least a grudging respect of our level-headed approach to the troubles that our people have had.\n\nMany natives have admitted shame of their past actions and have asked for forgiveness for their folly and blind fear that they once held. As expected, almost every Greneclyfian has wholeheartedly accepted their apologies and have, in true Greneclyfian spirit, extended a hoof of friendship to those who had wronged them before. While most of our communities are still fairly separated from those of local residents, there are some that are integrating very quickly and very well.\n\nBusiness has returned to normal, and there is nary a sign of trouble ahead for our people. Greneclyfians have finally stepped into the wider world, and we have not been shunned for it."

### POLITICAL EVENTS ###
 greneclyf.29.t:0 "A Loss of Faith"
 greneclyf.29.d:0 "The reports have been both incessant and disheartening. Many of our trading deals are failing, either by staunch refusal to our offers or by cessation of those accepted by the other parties. These have severely demoralised our people, but none more so than Queen Gytha. Upon hearing word of the latest failure, she lost herself in open despair, affecting a few too close to her. After much struggle, the Queen managed to sober up enough to close herself off in her personal chamber.\n\nShut off from everyone, the Queen has left no one on the seat of power, and no one is sure as to what can be done. As of right now, there is no one to look towards for a sense of stability, and panic is gripping the nation."

 greneclyf.69.t:0 "A Final Embrace"
 greneclyf.69.d:0 ""Gytha," a tired voice pleaded. "Please say something."\n\nFeilean was out of uniform, as he had spent the past three hours trying to comfort his sister as the latest reports came in.\n\nThe Queen had gone through the gamut of reactions, from disbelief, to open weeping and now, a silent dread. Only the ebbing vestiges of the words of Gytha's brother still echoed through the chamber. Even the dropped title did not rouse the changeling as her eyes saw something that did not exist.\n\nFeilean approached the Queen. "Please," he repeated with a more emphatic tone. He almost sounded desperate.\n\nGytha's gaze grew focused but remained cast downwards. After a pregnant pause, she said, "Leave us."\n\nHer voice was neutral, but it left Feilean uneasy. The herald bowed her head and left. He probably should have joined the drone, yet he could not do so—not yet. His little sister needed someling to offer comfort.\n\n"We– we could try something different," Feilean said. "We still have time to course-correct."\n\nHe suddenly felt a snout nuzzling upon his neck frill. Gytha had embraced him without warning. "Thank you, big brother." Her voice was barely louder than a whisper. "I love you so much for all that you have done."\n\nFeilean hesitated at first but soon returned the embrace. After a long moment of warm comfort, she added, "Please. I need some time alone."\n\nAgain he hesitated to break the contact, though he obediently did so. He made for the door, shooting back a glance. "I will always be here for you, Gytha." A faint smile with watery eyes met his promise.\n\nGytha's stare lingered upon the door before it eventually drifted upwards towards the chandelier of the chamber. She gauged it for a long while; it would probably do."

They claim that they were a local tradition in Aisling. They're small, rustic buildings, but there was a quality to them that called to me and many other sceptics. Their first Poet Call saw the pews stuffed with the curious and critics, with many filling the empty spaces in between.\n\nThe Praise Poet, a small, frail-looking drone in a beige robe, greeted us all with an open heart and spoke at length, retelling the tale of the Sunderer. It was nothing that we hadn't heard of before, but there was a noticeable tone of devotion in her voice that wasn't present in most retellings.\n\nI could already sense some guilt from some of the other spectators. They evidently hadn't given much thought about just how much changelings owed their existence to the Sunderer, but I, and I suspect most others, still were unmoved by the flowery prose.\n\nThen the Praise Singers sang\n\nThere was no instrumental accompaniment. It was a short poetical hymn that was about as eloquent as the Poet's earlier oration and, when put into writing, wasn't particularly eye-catching.\n\nBut the symphony... it touched my soul. The utter purity of the voices showed a harmonious quality that I had never believed that we shared. This is a part of our identity, and we had chased it away a century back. How could we have done so?\n\nWhen the choral finished, the entire audience was openly crying. My heart, both burdened with remorse but brought to peace by the song, had moved me to sob.  To this, the Praise Poet spoke:\n\n"Take these words ye faithful ones. Out of the dust were we born, and to the dust, we will return. Ye do not yet know the toil that They have made to bring you here, born on this lonely paradise. So They favoured your ancestors to grow in both Body and Mind, making them aware of themselves. Ye have just awoke; now ye must build and craft community as the creator has formed ye."\n\nI have, and I vow that we shall never again cut away a piece of ourselves. For the Sunderer."

 greneclyf_attaches.1.d:0 "Gytha knew it was too good to last. Everything had gone by like a wonderful dream — the wedding, the honeymoon, the bliss of each moment she spent with her husband. All of it came to an end when Cenhelm, having risen earlier, stood determined before her. Cute as he looked, Gytha wasn't so swayed.\n\n"I'm going abroad as an attaché,' Cenhelm repeated.\n\nThe Queen stretched out her legs before lazily tumbling over on their bed to sit up.\n\n"No, you're not, and I'm trampling whoever came up with the thought."\n\nShe straightened her neck and met his gaze, the silence between them interrupted only by the twitching of her wings. However, looming over him seemed to only bolster his resolve.\n\n"Gytha, it was my idea," Cenhelm said, continuing to look up at her eyes. "If I am to remain your King, I must use any opportunity to improve myself. I cannot let myself grow complacent, and I could never forgive myself if I could not defend you or everycreature in Beorgfordas. That is why I am doing this."\n\nGytha withheld her grimace. She understood his reasoning, even if she was personally against every conception of it. Her beloved husband belonged here, not away trying to better himself for her and Beorgfordas. He was hers, now and forever, and staring down at the pony... she could already tell he had committed himself to this.\n\nShe huffed and forlornly sunk her head onto the rumpled sheets. A sulking moment passed before Cenhelm pulled himself up and nuzzled her side. "I'll be back before you know it."\n\nGytha gently craned her head around and captured his lips in hers."

 greneclyf_attaches.2.d:0 "At last! No amount of time abroad learning new interplays of tactics, stratagems, and politics could keep King Cenhelm from yearning for Beorgfordas. Finally, his hooves now walked across the palace threshold. He was home, and not much national fanfare heralded his and his retinue's arrival, just as he requested. Aside from the journey too tiresome for them to be awash in loud spectacle, Cenhelm had been hoping that he could return unnoticed and surprise his most beautiful wife in the world. Though, as expected, it was all for nought the instant he subtly noticed one curiously cute drone tailing him ever since they had boarded the ferry.\n\nOnly when his retinue had finally bidden their departure did Cenhelm approach the drone, who had taken the guise of an ensign and appeared busy with some paperwork. It took every ounce of restraint behind his smirk to keep himself from laughing. "Well, hello there. What may your King do for a cute changeling like yourself on this lovely morning?"\n\nThe drone sputtered and blushed feverishly. "I... your majesty! W-what would the Queen say?!"\n\n"Considering how beautiful you look today..." Cenhelm leaned in. "I believe she would approve, wouldn't you, Gytha?"\n\nThe drone took a step back with an audible huff and set aside a file before dispelling her appearance, growing triple her size and leering over him with deep red irises. Her cheeks were still tinged with blush, which made her pout all the more adorable. "Glad I was right," Cenhelm said with a chuckle.\n\nGytha mumbled a growl and threw herself forward, her hooves snatching him up and closing the gap between them. When they broke from the kiss, Cenhelm managed to find his breath. "And here I was thinking you didn't like me."\n\n"A lot more than yesterday." The Queen smirked."

 NCH_FBK_pact:0 "The Great Pacts"
 NCH_FBK_pact_desc:0 "The ancient Farbrookian-Greneclyf friendship is symbolised by two pairs of tapestries, each weaved by Farbrook and Greneclyf. One represents the First Sharing from around 800 years ago, whereas the other depicts the Frozen Refuge, both events that are very significant for both Greneclyfians and Farbrookians.\n\nCollectively known as the Great Pacts, this hoofscraft stands as a testament of the historic friendship and collaborative nature between the two peoples, trascending biological barriers and proving that Harmony is truly universal."

 NCH_idyllic_society:0 "Pacifist Tendencies"
 NCH_idyllic_society_desc:0 "Despite our biological capacity for it, Greneclyfians abhor abusing their innate talents of subterfuge for military use and espionage. As such, any research into these areas will be slow.\n\nIn addition, a general lack of interest in all matters military leads to few Greneclyfians enrolling as either officers or as soldiers."

 NCH_blindfold_starting:0 "The Legacy of Dairile"
 NCH_blindfold_starting_desc:0 "The memoirs of the expatriate Dairile have reached a broader audience in Greneclyf since it was published some sixty years ago. Further incidents from other Greneclyfians abroad displaying similarities to those experienced by the writer have roused a movement among the changelings protesting their treatment in the continent. The blindfold, symbolising the perceived desire of non-changelings not to speak with Greneclyfians, has become synonymous with the stewing resentment among the populace.\n\nThe growing radicalisation of the movement has shaken the people's faith in the Leahman approach of governance and foreign policy, and we've seen political support waning. We know that the CPM is behind this, and we can expect this to continue if their call for a governmental response to Dairile's question that she posed fifty years ago is ignored. It'd best be a response that Greneclyfians and the CPM will accept, lest we risk further aggravating the perceived slights against us...\n\nThe CPM's supporters are currently §Rprotesting.§!"

 NCH_obsolete_navy_desc:0 "What ships we've obtained from our 'deal' with the Skyfall Federation are archaic in every sense of the word. They are old, slow, and extremely limited due to their outdated coal-based turbine engines. Though these are not oil-dependent, the ships are otherwise poorly armed and armoured, making for, frankly, terrible warships.\n\nUntil we either retrofit these ships or otherwise get rid of them, our fleet will remain as a painful reminder of Queen Nóra's gullibility and blindness."

Her position as the head of the GCS does place her in an advantageous position in the nation, having a network of informants and contacts abroad that can operate on the continent. Cara's motives are as nebulous as her origins, but she has said that the death of Queen Nóra Mhic left Greneclyf vulnerable, and she intends to keep the country safe.\n\nHer skills and connections are contrary to the pacifist and honest methods of the Leahman Clann, but they might be crucial for the well-being of the country.

As a result, however, its range was massively improved and easily outranged dedicated fighters, including some interceptors."

 NCH_amphibious_tank_equipment_4_desc:0 "Technically not a tank, the 'Platypus' Flotation Device (FSP) was an improvement over the previous generation of the same equipment. All tanks that were fitted with the device were dubbed as the Platapas model, even though the chassis varied wildly. The most common one used was a modified C.15 tank, and it was the heaviest tank that could swim with the FSP. It outperformed the C.13 fitted with the FSP, managing nearly 500 meters of water before requiring recovery. The C.13, by comparison, sank immediately."

The FSP-2 was modified so that it was also possible to install on other vehicles. It primarily saw use in light tanks and vehicles where needed, and depending on the chassis, could allow the vehicle to ford up to a kilometer of water. The only downside was that installing the device took time, and was nearly impossible to do so in combat conditions."

 NCH_medium_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "The first tank by BnG, the C.2 'Snail', was more manoeuvrable and faster than its name implied. This was due to a disproportionately large engine for the hull and its relatively thin armour. This technically didn't meet the army's request for an infantry tank, but observers were particularly impressed by the C.2's speed and reliable gun. It would be adopted as the 'combat tank', a role that would work alongside the smaller flanker tanks as the primary anti-tank vehicle in an armoured assault."

 NCH_medium_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "BnG's C.6 was more of a testbed like the Fráma Armúrtha than an actual tank. This was most evident by the incredibly cramped turret and the same gun used in the C.2. However, its new leaf bogie suspension system and redesigned engine deck gave the C.6 a far lower profile, just as low as that of the C.4. Though it was clear that there were issues in the hull's layout that required ironing out, the army commended the new direction in design philosophy for future combat tanks."

Its turret was spacious and comfortable enough for three crewmembers, and the improved roadwheel layout made this a responsive and efficient vehicle. Regardless of its vulnerability to AT fire, 'the Challenger', as it would become known, was a formidable foe to most enemies it faced."

By reworking the driveshaft and removing the turret for an open-topped gunshield mounting, the chassis allowed for large-calibre cannons. The anti-tank variant was designated as the 'Lansaí'.

The 'Sábh' was based on the Laoch chassis, and had a much larger turret housing for a 37mm autocannon that allowed for a high angle of fire. The Greneclyfian High Command initially did not accept the design, but a demonstration of the vehicle convinced officers to approve it. A limited production run saw limited models in the army, and its overall combat effectiveness is disputed."

Due to the modification of the Poll however, it was very vulnerable to infantry, artillery, and air attacks. As such, crews had to get inventive in hiding the vehicle when in combat to ensure its survivability."

 NCH_medium_tank_aa_equipment_3_desc:0 "Difficulties encountered in the Piobaraithe's turret forced engineers to reconsider the original turret for the 'Saillteoir' SPAAG. The Saillteoir's somewhat open-topped turret meant that only 12.7mm machineguns in a dual configuration were viable as main armaments. Trading overall killing power for compact weapons meant that the Saillteoir had considerable staying power, and it outlasted its competitors in endurance trials. Despite the simplified turret, the medium SPAAG saw limited numbers."

The C.15 boasted the armament and spacious turret of the C.13 while maintaining the overall mobility and speed of the C.9. Though it was better armoured than the C.9, the C.15 was widely considered as woefully vulnerable to contemporary AT threats, earning it the ironic nickname of 'the Knight.'"

This new tank, designated as the C.16 and internally known as 'the Knight II', faced numerous development issues revolving around procuring a suitable engine and extremely high ground pressure. By the time BnG selected one, the C.16's layout was deemed obsolete compared to its competing design, the C.18, and the army discarded it."

Informally known as 'the Tiger' due to its origins, the C.17 had a whole new hull layout and, most importantly, interleaved roadwheels with large thread tracks to better distribute the weight. Though it weighed more and was more expensive than the C.16, the army picked the C.17 due to its overall better performance in survivability tests."

As the design cycle progressed, it kept changing engines, adding additional armour to make the tank as impervious as possible. However, the design was unfeasible simply due to a lack of suitable engines and the vehicle's sheer mass. A hull of the C.14 would be produced in 1012 but would be scrapped by late 1013 since it didn't meet the army's requirements."

The Hydra would have mounted a naval gun and an autoloader that allowed a reasonably quick reload for its calibre. It would have been of welded construction, which should've been feasible for the Greneclyfian industry, but by the time the design was finalised, BnG realised that the multi-turreted tank was a dead-end and began working on a more modern idea."

Essentially a truncated Hiodra II, the overall layout was more conventional but retained the oversized turret and had an even larger naval gun. On paper, the C.19 was a formidable heavy tank when first designed in 1017, but the prototype construction took far longer than expected and competed with the C.18 in the 1021 tank trials. Hopelessly sluggish and slow, not even the C.19's astonishing firepower or survivability could outperform the lighter and comparatively versatile C.18."

In addition, she is the youngest Queen to lead Greneclyf at 22, far too young under ordinary circumstances. Unfortunately for everyone involved, Gytha's ascension was anything but. In this light, the new Queen is seen with trepidation, especially considering her close relationship with her mother. Her first weeks as the head of state were chaotic, and it was only through Feilean, her older brother, that order was restored on the island following Queen Nóra's death.\n\nThe difficulties before Gytha are many, and there is little faith in her opponents or herself. However, there is too much at stake for the Queen to fail now. With a well-curated cabinet, a sound plan, and determination, there is a chance for Gytha to undo the mistakes of her mother.§!\n\n§YPortrait By§!§L: Scroup§!"

There is no plan beyond a few policies and actions they have meant to take for years, and Oiren's clann will be of little help.\n\nIt is in this situation that the newly-crowned Queen Oiren must rule a country that is rapidly spiralling out of her barely acquired control.\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!§L: Scroup§!"

 FENNORE_POLITICS_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!§L: 15th of March 976, in Coillín§!\n\n§YBiography§!§L: Born to a poor family, Fennore was one of the many Greneclyfians who partook in Queen Nóra Mic's diaspora project, settling in Vetailje with her family and growing up in the small Greneclyfian community. Her disdain for non-changelings was formed here, and it was solidified when her father, Colum, was beaten to near death by an enraged mob of Bakarans. The image of Fennore's father's broken body on the pavement is one she'll carry to her grave, forever at the forefront of her mind.\n\nWhen she returned to Greneclyf, Fennore was a destitute drone and found her place among countless other drones, left impoverished by failed industrialisation and enrichment efforts. She would probably have been left to waste on the wayside had it not been for the fateful reencounter with an old foalhood friend, Cader Sclerite. Inducted into the CPM, Fennore found her new calling in life: firebrand speaker for a radical new coalition.\n\nAs First Consul, Fennore can manipulate the path the Greneclyfian Republic will tread and, perhaps, allow her more radical stances to dictate policy. Others will undoubtedly question her methods, but there will always be a method to Fennore's madness, and there will always be a traumatic memory driving her.\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!§L: Yuri§!"

Eolan is likely the first Greneclyfian multi-millionaire and easily the wealthiest drone in Greneclyf, possibly of all changeling-kind.\n\nHaving invested early and heavily into steel mills when Queen Nóra Mhic launched her national industrialisation programme, Eolan reaped many dividends and returns and comfortably stayed afloat once the crash came. This has left the elderly drone with a profitable and productive industrial enterprise and a lot of money to spend. Surprisingly, he has chosen to venture into politics and in league with Cader Sclerite's CPM.\n\nFew expect any real play for First Consul from Eolan, and fewer still can even guess his policy matters. The big shot from Blosmport has kept quiet about his own philosophy. Only time will tell...\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!§L: Stanislav§!" #CHECK WITH STANISLAV

Leaving Greneclyf as Breas Ó Fathaigh, his adopted name and nomenclature are examples of Queen Nóra Mhic's more successful policies. As such, he has learned much during his travels. Cader's time in various nations, such as Skynavia and Kása, has helped mould his political identity and agenda. Prior radicalised teachings have long since been tempered by the domestic and international realities he has witnessed. Consequently, he has since formulated his own answer to the woes of Greneclyf.\n\nAs First Consul, Cader would be in the perfect position to guide the country via democratising all aspects of Greneclyfian society and would be the glue keeping the CPM from splintering into the various cliques it used to be. Luckily, his moderate policies and strong friendship with Fennore will undoubtedly aid him in his endeavours, and most expect many great things from the first-ever drone leader in his grand republican experiment.\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!§L: Scroup§!"

So, I fought to liberate all changelings, ultimately committing the final sacrifice.\n\nMy mind... wandered—for an unknowable amount of time.

Only when I saw your Nóra Mhic's floundering, a confirmation of a vision, did I decide to out myself. However, I was considered a fraud, a liar, and cast into a horrid place, but I bade my time, confident that I would once more be in a position to guide my kin.\n\nI am humbled that you have chosen me to lead, and though any changeling could achieve what I shall, I will honour my station and once again fight for my kin, for my countrylings, and for our future.\n\n§!§YMy Portrayer§!§L: AnaStaFury§!"

 GOLDAIN_MIL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!§L: 9th of November 974, in Blosmport§!\n\n§YRank§!§L: Ghinearál§!\n\n§YBiography§!§L: Goldáin was born into the esteemed Ámharáin family to a drone mother, rich from the trade with Farbrookian ponies and as the sixth of eight siblings. He was named after Goldblóma, a Farbrookian stallion, a long-time family friend and devoted business partner to Goldáin's parents. Being the third youngest among his siblings, he had no chance to inherit the family fortune. Still, his loving parents provided him with the highest quality education reserved only for Greneclyf's wealthiest.\n\nAfter being accepted to officer school, the young Goldáin earned a reputation as a quick-witted and charming person, securing relatively high marks in subjects as well as a certain amount of popularity in the class of 998. His inherent capacity to lead others was honed during his time at the academy and made him an excellent prospective officer. However, due to an altercation abroad regarding a Farbrookian mare, Goldáin's fast-track came to a sudden halt and was seriously reprimanded for his unprofessional behaviour. The only thing that prevented him from being dishonourably discharged or sacked was that he defended the mare, Gimcynn, from suspected criminals. In this, he gained both the respect and admiration of Gimcynn.\n\nNot long after 1003, while still serving in the Greneclyfian Army as a captain, Goldáin's friendship with Gymcinn bloomed into something more, and the two now reside together in Blosmport. A major before the reforms, a superior officer recommended his promotion to general. Though others of his rank eye this with suspicion, Goldáin's youthful energy, while perhaps reckless, promises new ideas to Greneclyf's General Staff.§!\n\n§YPortrait By§!§L: Neither§!"

 SNOW_MIL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!§L: Unknown, some time before the 7th century, in Pengaia§!\n\n§YRank§!§L: Ghinearál§!\n\n§YBiography§!§L: Standing out like a sore hoof among the sea of Greneclyfians, Snow Wingfrost is something of a curiosity on the island. Though by no means a small creature, his stature pales compared to his kin and belies his age. Even he wouldn't know how old he truly is.\n\nLong ago, Snow had abandoned his tribes in the far South in search of a place to deepen his understanding of modern warfare. His wanderings eventually led him to the Griffonian Empire, where he could learn through second-hoof knowledge from the few griffons willing to share or trade. Finally, through a long period of self-teaching, Frostwing grew to have a deep understanding of the griffon school of war and would have been a knowledgeable peer had the griffon courts accepted him. Instead, Snow would only be known as a dragon squatting on the outskirts of Vinnin.\n\nNews of a changeling rearmament campaign reached the dragon, and he was interested in playing his part in a historic undertaking. Of course, the changeling attaché Snow had heard of was from the West, but those who told him of the changelings' lands pointed him to Greneclyf. By pure coincidence, the Greneclyfians were also in the midst of a rearmament program, and Queen Nóra Mhic readily accepted the service offered by Frostwing. Working alongside Feilean, the two modernised the Greneclyfian armed forces, and for his part, Snow was awarded a special place in Greneclyfian society and its military.\n\n§YPortrait By§!§L: Rich May§!"

 VESPAEX_MIL_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!§L: 12th of December 968, in Vesalipolis§!\n\n§YRank§!§L: Ghinearál\n\n§!§YBiography§!§L: Aufst Vespaex is a displaced changeling. Having grown up in Venyx's hive near Vesalipolis, and being trained under tutelage of Venyx has crafted the Royal into a promising commander.\n\nHowever, once Chrysalis took control of the surrounding hives and changeling lands in 988, Aufst's life was endangered by the new despot's culling of Royal males. His queen, Venyx, managed to shuttle him away to keep him safe from Chrysalis's wrath, much to Ausft's protests. Through an elaborate ruse, Venyx ensured Ausft was declared dead and shipped to the one place where he could carve out a living for himself: Greneclyf.\n\nWhen he arrived in 990, the Royal was warmly received, though he had kept the reason for coming a secret. By 1001, Ausft decided to assist the burgeoning Greneclyfian military programme by enrolling as an officer, only to be foiled by Chrysalis's failed invasion of Canterlot in 1002. Branded as untrustworthy, Vespaex was barred from any position of power.\n\nIt was only after the Greneclyfian Queen's pardon to all exiles and refugees that Ausft could finally make use of his upbringing, though for a queen he had never expected to serve.\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!§L: Yuri§!"

He was mostly spared of the devastation from the consolidation war and was fast-tracked into the budding naval academy of Dytrisium once Queen Chrysalis united the hives.\n\nThough a promising admiral and almost assured of a prestigious career, Vironect was disgusted by the culling of Male Royals in the Changeling Lands and was pushed to the point of no return in 1002, when, as a staffer of Recina, he witnessed her resignation. Following this, Vironect abandoned the path to an admiral position in the Kriegsmarine and fled to Greneclyf, unwilling to serve under such a cruel queen.\n\nHe was surprised by the reasonably sizeable ex-pat community of changelings who had taken residence on the exotic island. He became a close friend to Aufst Vespaex, one of the few Royal Males who escaped Queen Chrysalis's cull. When all changelings from Equus were permitted to join the military, Anaemia enthusiastically enrolled into the Greneclyfian Naval Service, ready to offer his services to a more just leader.§!\n\n§YPortrait By§!§L: Vladio§!"

 ### EQUIPMENT MODULES ###
 tank_modern_fixed_superstructure_turret:0 "Modern Fixed Superstructure"
 tank_modern_fixed_superstructure_turret_desc:0 "A fixed superstructure only allows the main armament to traverse in a small arc without turning the entire vehicle. However, it allows the vehicle to mount a bigger armament while being overall of smaller size, making the vehicle perfect for ambushes."

 tank_composite_armor:0 "Composite Armor"
 tank_composite_armor_desc:0 "Adding a thin layer of silica glass between the armor plates dramatically increases armor effectiveness. Unfortunately, the technique is still in its infancy and somewhat unreliable, and very expensive to produce."

 tank_heavy_cannon_5:0 "Modern Heavy Cannon"
 tank_heavy_cannon_5_desc:0 "A weapon that can fire a large shell. With exceptional armor penetration and decent performance against soft targets, its biggest drawbacks are the sheer size and cost, which make it too unwieldy to be mounted in most vehicles not specifically designed to carry it."

 tank_super_heavy_cannon_2:0 "Improved Super-Heavy Cannon"
 tank_super_heavy_cannon_2_desc:0 "An absurdly large weapon with unmatched performance. There are very few things that this weapon can not destroy, and none of them have any business shooting at a tank."

 demolition_gun:0 "Demolition Gun"
 demolition_gun_desc:0 "A high-explosive gun designed to destroy fortifications and bridges, accurate to a long range and also highly effective against infantry as an area-of-effect weapon. While it can provide some anti-armor firepower, it was never designed for such a role."

 stabilizer_2:0 "Improved Stabilizer"

 oscillating_turret:0 "Oscillating Turret"
 oscillating_turret_desc:0 "By making the turret itself pivot up and down rather than having the gun do so, we can omit the usual traverse space inside the turret and mount a slightly more powerful cannon in our light tanks. This creates a major weakspot in the armour at the pivot point, which makes it unsuited for larger vehicles."
 gun_computer:0 "Fire Control Electronics"
 gun_computer_desc:0 "By adapting miniaturized examples of artillery and navel fire control electronics we can greatly increase accuracy at range."
 anti_tank_guided_missiles:0 "Anti-Tank Guided Missiles"

 super_heavy_tank_chassis_2_desc:0 "These tanks are rolling monstrosities, with high-caliber bunker smashing cannons and several layers of reinforced armor. But even with the most advanced engines and extra-wide double tracks, these tanks have trouble traversing marshes and have to ford rivers with a snorkel."
 super_heavy_tank_chassis_3_desc:0 "Faster treads allow these super heavy tanks to compete on the modern battlefield. High-caliber bunker smashing cannons and several layers of reinforced armor render them nearly unstoppable in a fair fight. While they will likely never reclaim dominance from the main battle tanks due to their reduced versatility, they nonetheless can provide devastating firepower when our troops need it most."

 light_tank_chassis_4_short:0 "1018 Light"
 light_tank_chassis_4_desc:0 "Mainly relegated to support roles, newer generations of light tanks still have a part to play in modern mechanised warfare, as their unparalleled mobility makes them an excellent supplementary reconnaissance and flanking force to the main army. Our newest chassis reflect this while allowing for a better application of armour for survivability."
 light_tank_chassis_5:0 "Modern Light Tank Chassis"
 light_tank_chassis_5_short:0 "1024 Light"
 light_tank_chassis_5_desc:0 "Further development in light tanks has yielded some exciting propositions of creating tanks light enough for quick aerial transport or even paradrops! Though the hulls are still too heavy for the latter, they can mount enough armour to withstand most infantry attacks, an engine fast enough to outpace some cars, and a weapons system powerful enough to pose a threat to any enemy."

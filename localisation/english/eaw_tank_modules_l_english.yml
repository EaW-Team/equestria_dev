 tank_naval_cannon:0 "Naval Cannon"
 tank_naval_cannon_desc:0 "While mounting a destroyer's main cannon on a tank may seem completely insane, it will provide immense firepower and be capable of destroying most any target currently operational."
 tank_super_heavy_cannon_2:0 "Improved Super-Heavy Cannon"

 tank_heavy_howitzer_2:0 "Improved Heavy Howitzer" 
 tank_heavy_howitzer_2_desc:0 "A heavy field howitzer adapted to be mounted in a vehicle. Its primary purpose is indirect fire support against soft targets, but it can be fired directly at a target if necessary.

 tank_rocket_launcher_4:0 "Modern Rocket Launcher"
 tank_rocket_launcher_4_desc:0 "The ultimate example of our armour mounted rockets, this technology perfects delivery and guidance into a devastating rocket system."

 demolition_gun:0 "Demolition Gun"
 demolition_gun_desc:0 "A high-explosive gun designed to destroy fortifications and bridges, accurate to a long range and also highly effective against infantry as an area-of-effect weapon. While it can provide some anti-armor firepower, it was never designed for such a role."

 stabilizer_2:0 "Improved Stabiliser"
 stabilizer_2_desc:0 "Improving from mere single-axis stabilisation to double-axis stabilisation allows the gun to be even more accurate during the short stop to fire."
 stabilizer_3:0 "Advanced Stabiliser"
 stabilizer_3_desc:0 "Fully automatic stabilisation finally allows for accurate fire on the move. It will still usually be advantageous to stop to fire, but when that is not possible this provides a potent advantage."
 oscillating_turret:0 "Oscillating Turret"
 oscillating_turret_desc:0 "By making the turret itself pivot up and down rather than having the gun do so, we can omit the usual traverse space inside the turret and mount a slightly more powerful cannon in our light tanks. This creates a major weakspot in the armour at the pivot point, which makes it unsuited for larger vehicles."
 gun_computer:0 "Fire Control Electronics"
 gun_computer_desc:0 "By adapting miniaturized examples of artillery and naval fire control electronics we can greatly increase accuracy at range."
 tank_agtm_launcher:0 "ATGM Launcher Tube"
 tank_agtm_launcher_desc:0 "A launcher tube designed for anti-tank guided missiles allows for truly unparalleled anti-armor performance. No tank in service can reliably survive a direct hit at any range. However, against soft targets, it is only equipped with a coaxial machine gun, rendering it no more effective than the tankettes of old."
 anti_tank_guided_missiles:0 "Extra ATGMs"
 anti_tank_guided_missiles_desc:0 "By adding wire-guided missiles directed by the gunner through an adapted flight stick, we can greatly increase the chance of engaging first at range. These use a HEAT warhead and greatly enhance anti-tank capabilities."

 modern_tank_chassis_2_desc:0 "The initial foray into the universal tank concept has yet to succeed as we hoped. However, new advancements and breakthroughs in armour layouts, electronics, and engines can begin to correct flaws and coalesce different design ideas into a more refined vision: the Main Battle Tank (MBT). Primarily relying on speed and firepower, this new platform is modern and highly cost-effective."
 modern_tank_chassis_3:0 "2nd-Gen MBT Chassis"
 modern_tank_chassis_3_desc:0 "The performance of first-generation MBTs has been nothing short of excellent. With new field experience, silica-based composite armour and hydropneumatic suspension, we can introduce our army's most modern chassis for armoured vehicles. We expect this line of tanks and fighting vehicles to evolve and become a staple of our armoured forces."

 super_heavy_tank_chassis_3_short:0 "1026 Super-Heavy"

 super_heavy_tank_chassis_2_desc:0 "With the propagation of the MBT, some questions remain about the utility of a heavy tank or proper breakthrough tank. Despite this, many theorists believe there is still a place for a super-heavy tank that is more conventional in design. With two-piece ammunition, we can increase the calibre of the main gun while still keeping the shell size manageable for manual crew loading, and large, double-width caterpillar tracks can better distribute the added weight."
 super_heavy_tank_chassis_3_desc:0 "Stronger and more reliable train drives allow these super-heavy tanks to compete on the modern battlefield. High-caliber bunker smashing cannons and several layers of reinforced armor render them nearly unstoppable in a fair fight. While they will likely never reclaim dominance from MBTs due to their reduced versatility, they nonetheless can provide devastating firepower when our troops need it most."

 light_tank_chassis_4_short:0 "1018 Light"
 light_tank_chassis_4_desc:0 "Mainly relegated to support roles, newer generations of light tanks still have a part to play in modern mechanised warfare, as their unparalleled mobility makes them an excellent supplementary reconnaissance and flanking force to the main army. Our newest chassis reflect this while allowing for a better application of armour for survivability."
 light_tank_chassis_5:0 "Modern Light Tank Chassis"
 light_tank_chassis_5_short:0 "1024 Light"
 light_tank_chassis_5_desc:0 "Further development in light tanks has yielded some exciting propositions of creating tanks light enough for quick aerial transport or even paradrops! Though the hulls are still too heavy for the latter, they can mount enough armour to withstand most infantry attacks, an engine fast enough to outpace some cars, and a weapons system powerful enough to pose a threat to any enemy."

 armor_tech_5:0 "Reactive Armour Experiments"
 armor_tech_5_desc:0 "We can improve the staying power of our armoured vehicles with a novel idea: reactive armour. Experiments with explosive-filled bricks applied to plates reduce the penetration of shaped charges with a directed explosion. Minor changes to the filling can make the reactive armour effective against kinetic projectiles. Of course, once the brick is hit, it is no longer useable, but it might just be enough to save our tank crews from a direct hit."
 armor_tech_6:0 "Early Composite Armour"
 armor_tech_6_desc:0 "Reactive armour shows promise, but its application is extra weight on an already heavy vehicle. A breakthrough in armour development that uses layers of different materials within the steel faces of the chassis may supplant conventional all-steel designs. Fused silica glass has yielded the best result, stopping shaped charges that can easily penetrate hundreds of millimetres of resistant steel armour. A major benefit of this armour scheme is a significant reduction in overall weight."

 engine_tech_5:0 "High-Powered Engines"
 engine_tech_5_desc:0 "There is still more that we can do to improve the performance of our tank engines. A novel idea is to increase fuel delivery and charging degree pressure. This reduces the amount of required oxidant in the combustion chamber when compressing, generating significantly more kinetic energy. The final designs of these high-pressure can output an outstanding amount of power capable of moving heavier vehicles."
 engine_tech_6:0 "Fuel Additives"
 engine_tech_6_desc:0 "We can only build up an engine so much before it becomes impractical. With so much already done to mechanically improve our engines, we can look at improving the fuel that they run on. Some additives, such as extreme pressure additives, or even monopropellants, can increase the engine output within the pistons, making these engines some of the most powerful, if not as long-lasting, engines worldwide."

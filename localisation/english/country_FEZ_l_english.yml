 ##Leader Descriptions
 smuggler_trump_desc:0 "Gwanaël Godard and his family came to Fezera two decades ago, after being ousted from Skyfall for cheating with scales. Among the many merchant families in the trade capital of Griffonia, their reputation has never been positive. Few shed tears after the Iron Chancellor ordered their fortune to be seized and family itself exiled. With meager funds and endless amount of spite, Gwanaël has made it his life's mission to exact revenge on those who have defaced his family's name. The morality and legality of his actions has rarely been a concern in his mind, and now as the mayor of Fezera, Gwanaël Godard and his associates seek to expand their schemes tenfold."
 ALKAPONY_desc:0 ""A wise guy, eh? So you wanna know about Willem Holveder? Listen here, kid, and lemme tell you a story...\n\nI was but a small chick roaming the streets of Griffton. My parents, Maar curse them both, barely looked after me, and soon enough I was left on my own, begging for food and Idols. With no school or any particular talents, it looked like young Willem wouldn't last very long. That is, until I joined the local gang, hehehe. It felt so damn good to shakedown those fat merchants, who looked down on us like we were worth less than dirt. Which may have been the truth, but y'know, forget about it!\n\nBut the good times couldn't last for long. Sure, the boss thought I was a good shot, and we made much selling moonshine, but all our success attracted the attention of coppers and soon after, half of the gang was dead or locked up. The rest of us who weren't caught knew they would squeal on us, so I told the birds we're tailing it outta here. So I took 'em all to a dump called Fezera, and slowly we rebuilt ourselves to something bigger and greater. I'll be honest, this place grew on me, nevermind all the rain.\n\nThey told me it couldn't be done, but where are they now? Hah! I run this joint now and I've got some big plans. Now then, you've got ten seconds to start talking who sent you before I start pulling feathers. It better not be those damned coppers...""
 police_chief_desc:0 "Police chief Wilfried Pasvogel has served in the Fezeraanse Politie for over three decades with distinction and merit, despite constant lacks of griffonpower, funding and equipment. Having a firm sense of justice, he has always been moral and steadfast in upholding the law, regardless of the rampant corruption in Fezera. His colleagues in the force remark that the chief has grown cold and distant ever since his partner got shot and killed in an investigation of smuggled contraband from Skyfall. He was just an ordinary detective back then, and could do nothing as the case was closed due to the lack of evidence and suspects. Since then, Pasvogel has worked his way to the top of the Politie, surviving many attempts to eliminate from the town, and now leads the city-state as a lawful sanctuary for any griffon fleeing from war-torn lands."
 moneyless_loser_desc:0 "Following the departure of traitorous Gwanaël Godard, the city's remaining bureaucrats has hastily put up Koos Geldloos as the city's new mayor. They've reasoned that since luck never favoured Fezera, and Koos himself is particularly known for being particularly unlucky, that it can't get any worse."

 FEZ_criminal_haven:0 "Scoundrel's Haven"
 FEZ_criminal_haven_desc:0 "Nested on the shores of western Griffonia, Fezera is a minor mercantile city-state that goes unnoticed compared to its competition in Skyfall and Flowena. With its glory days as an Imperial Free City long past, Fezera has greatly diminished in importance, with less and less trade flowing through its ports. As a result, unscrupulous elements of society have creeped in and made it their own den of scum and villainy."

With its glory days as an Imperial Free City long past, Fezera has greatly diminished in importance, with less and less trade flowing through its ports. As a result, unscrupulous elements of society have creeped in and made it their own den of scum and villainy.\n\nWith the recent disbandment of the Fezeraanse Politie, criminal activity has ramped up, all while Mayor Godard insists nothing is wrong as his paid security force patrols the streets and dispenses justice on skewed principles."

 FEZ_criminal_haven_penose_desc:0 "Nested on the shores of western Griffonia, Fezera is a minor mercantile city-state that goes unnoticed compared to its competition in Skyfall and Flowena. With its glory days as an Imperial Free City long past, Fezera has greatly diminished in importance, with less and less trade flowing through its ports. As a result, unscrupulous elements of society have creeped in and made it their own den of scum and villainy.\n\nThe meticulous takeover by Don Holveder and his Familie has left other factions in the city decapitated, with the penose now free to openly ply their immoral trade. Nonetheless, they are careful about treating their own citizens with respect, as they rely on popular support to remain in power."
 FEZ_fake_cops:0 "Gone To The Dogs"
 FEZ_fake_cops_desc:0 "Myles Pawtner and his private security forces have taken over policing matters in Fezera. Ruthless and loyal only to the deep pockets of mayor Gwenaël Godard, they serve Fezera only in ways that also serve certain interests. There is now order again, but only Godard's law."

 FEZ_painful_recovery:0 "Licking Our Wounds"

 FEZ_griefwald_ally_desc:0 "Now that the birds in Greifwald have agreed to support us, it is time to formalise our alliance on paper. Hopefully, they won't realise what they've signed up for..."
 FEZ_more_factories:0 "Additional Firearm Production"
 FEZ_more_factories_desc:0 "Guns, we need more guns. We can't spare money to buy some at the moment, so we shall instead improve our current production centres and expand the workshops. Each firearm will make a difference in the war to come."
 FEZ_skyfall_war:0 "End the Trade Federation"
 FEZ_skyfall_war_desc:0 "We've got our weapons, our allies and our mercenaries ready and waiting. It is time to pull off the biggest heist in history. Mayor Godard is eager to take to claim the largest villa in the city of Skyfall for himself, with a scenic view on the bustling ports. Onwards!"
 FEZ_approach_aqulia:0 "Appeal to Aquileia's Lower Instincts"
 FEZ_approach_aqulia_desc:0 "We've done it, Skyfall is ours. While we are eager to expand our money making operations, first we must secure ourselves against an invasion. We shall approach the Aquileians in hopes of obtaining their protection. We know how high and mighty they like to present themselves but we'll make them an offer that can't refuse. Their very own slush fund, all safe and secret. We already got a name: Beakstream."
 FEZ_expanding_market:0 "The World Beyond"
 FEZ_expanding_market_desc:0 "Now that we've got Skyfall in our claws, the world is our oyster! We shall expand our operations across entire Griffonia, and maybe even beyond! By pretending to be the legitimate successor of Skyfall, we'll get access to exclusive trade contracts, which we'll put to good use. Namely, to swindle the world!"
 
 
 ##The Classy Mobsters
 FEZ_siding_maf:0 "De Familie"
 FEZ_siding_maf_desc:0 "The boss is tired of those scammers in the city hall giving Fezera a bad reputation. Now we aren't blind, we're not fit either to walk guilt-free, but the main difference is that we care about the people. With the Politie out of commission, we can step up and assume control."
 FEZ_corrupt_cops:0 "Not So Different"
 FEZ_corrupt_cops_desc:0 "We sympathize with the policegriffs. All they wanted to do it keep Fezera a safe place to live in. We shall approach their remnants and offer them a deal they won't be able to refuse."
 FEZ_family_first:0 "Strengthen the Family"
 FEZ_family_first_desc:0 "We need griffons in every aspect of Fezzerian managment. Nothing can happen in this city anymore without our involvement. That includes all the coin being made and lost, as well."
 FEZ_loose_ends:0 "Eliminating the Competition"
 FEZ_loose_ends_desc:0 "Our takeover has been remarkably smooth. However, there are still a plenty of birds in Fezera that require a whacking. The boss needs to rule uncontested to achieve his goals."
 FEZ_expand_family:0 "New Blood"
 FEZ_expand_family_desc:0 "With our control secured, we can now spread the word across western Griffonia. Fezera is a place where anygriff who fought the law can lay low and never get pinched. As an additional benefit, some of them might even join our Familie fully."
 FEZ_invite_criminals_to_family:0 "Recruitment"
 FEZ_invite_criminals_to_family_desc:0 "The influx of various gentlegriffs over the past months has resulted, as expected, into willing recruits for our organisation. The boss is pleased with the numbers, the books are open."
 FEZ_protect_scientists:0 "Watch the Eggheads"
 FEZ_protect_scientists_desc:0 "Fezera can reasonably be called a city of smart griffons. Intelligent birds means progress, and progress means better guns and more loot. Make sure the eggheads have everything they need to come up with new technologies and advancements."
 FEZ_ludicrous_buisness:0 "Sharing Our Success"
 FEZ_ludicrous_buisness_desc:0 "Now that all pieces are in place, we can initiate our honest trading schemes. We got plenty to sell! Additionally, a cut of each sale will go to the poor griffons of Fezera, so that they can stand up for themselves. We want everygriff living in Fezera to be decent."
 FEZ_more_tobacco:0 "A Better Brand"
 FEZ_more_tobacco_desc:0 "Skyfall is famous for their various excellent tobacco brands. We shall take advantage of this, and copy their success! Perhaps an improvement is in order, as well..."
 FEZ_more_boos:0 "Wonderful Liquor"
 FEZ_more_boos_desc:0 "As part of our operations, we've been producing illegal alcohol in underground distilleries. No need to hide anymore! Some of our factories will now be repurposed to exclusively produce liquor. To attract workers, we'll give them each a free sample of the merchandise."
 FEZ_more_tommy_guns:0 "A Means of Protection"
 FEZ_more_tommy_guns_desc:0 "You can get much further with a kind word and a gun than you can with just a kind word, it is known. Everygriff in the Familie needs to know this. But first, we're going to need more weapon factories."
 FEZ_skyfall_blockade:0 "The Don's Plan"
 FEZ_skyfall_blockade_desc:0 "After extensive consultation with the other high ranking members of the Familie, the boss has decided that we're going to take over Skyfall. They got the goods, the money, they got it all. We shall begin with the preparations at once."
 FEZ_mafia_way:0 "The Fezzerian Customs"
 FEZ_mafia_way_desc:0 "We're familiar with every inch of our country. This will become crucial in the upcoming fight. Bait the attackers right where we want them to be, then whack them."
 FEZ_rally_family:0 "Prepare the Family"
 FEZ_rally_family_desc:0 "The mobsters are great shots, no doubt, but they lack cohesion to fight as a proper army. We need to organise our griffons into units and battalions, in order to have a chance at victory."
 FEZ_prepar_boarder:0 "Healthy Worries"
 FEZ_prepar_boarder_desc:0 "Skyfall's army is better equipped and more numerous than ours. We shall appear weaker than we are, giving away the control of the border, only to lure the overconfident fools into our fortifications. A veritable deathtrap will await."
 FEZ_tommy_guns_for_all:0 "Our Little Friends"
 FEZ_tommy_guns_for_all_desc:0 ""Should anygriff decide to mess with us, they shall receive a warm welcome from our little friends. Ensure every member of the Familie owns one.""
 FEZ_dons_men:0 "The Boss' Way"
 FEZ_dons_men_desc:0 "Although the boss has never had any actual military training, he knows better than all of us how to lead a fighting force. We trust that he and his son will make excellent leaders on the field. You don't last long in Fezera if you don't have the street smarts to survive."
 FEZ_skyfall_strikes:0 "Expanding Our Territory"
 FEZ_skyfall_strikes_desc:0 ""Boss says we're ready. Either we dine in Skyfall by the next month, or we're sleeping with the fishes in the docks of Fezera. We're going to take Skyfall for all that it's got!""
 FEZ_mafia_skyfall:0 "Putting Skyfall to Good Use"
 FEZ_mafia_skyfall_desc:0 "With the city of Skyfall in our claws, its famous ports and ships are ours to command. And we know just the thing to do - sell our merchandise across the entire world! Riches will flow in, sooner than one can imagine."
 FEZ_attack_haukland:0 "A Safe Haven Between the Continents"
 FEZ_attack_haukland_desc:0 "The boss has been eyeing the Hauklands archipelago for some time. He thinks they'd make a great Summertime resort, and a place to retreat should things go sour on the mainland. Not to mention, it's a safe place to store our treasures. As soon as those ships are ready, we're going to pay Meyer a visit."
 FEZ_marry_wng_maf:0 "Align With the Wingbardian Family"
 FEZ_marry_wng_maf_desc:0 "The Wingbardian Mafia is the single largest organised crime syndicate across the entire continent. Even failed states that are run by bandits aren't as wealthy and influential like them! The boss wants to make a mutually beneficial offer with one of their biggest families. They get a cut from the Skyfall trading, we get their protection."
 FEZ_go_alone:0 "Our Own Path"
 FEZ_go_alone_desc:0 "We've done pretty good for ourselves, and nobody can deny that. Why make allies when we're doing great on our own? The boss has declared: we eat alone. Still, we'd be wise to prepare for an eventual foreign incursion. Skyfall is coveted by many on the continent..."
 
 ##Good Cops
 FEZ_good:0 "A Just and Honourable Cause"
 FEZ_good_desc:0 "These thugs will stop at nothing to sate their own greed. It is time for good, honest griffons to step up and clean the stains from Fezera. Everything will be done by the book, of course."
 FEZ_recovering_raid:0 "Recover Our Losses"
 FEZ_recovering_raid_desc:0 ""Chief, we've lost many good griffons in the assault, and many of our precincts have been burned down. Not to mention all the files and equipment lost... It will take some time until we can recover our strength, chief, but I know we can do it.""
 FEZ_recruit_last_cadets:0 "Volunteers for Righteousness"
 FEZ_recruit_last_cadets_desc:0 "We've mourned for our fallen policegriffs long enough, it's time to hire new ones to carry the torch of justice. There are plenty of griffons in Fezera who do not like being ruled by crooks and bandits, and we shall capitalise on this."
 FEZ_asking_for_help:0 "Feathisian Assistance"
 FEZ_asking_for_help_desc:0 "Training new cadets would go a lot smoother if we had enough equipment for all of them. The clandestine elements in this country control much of the production centres, which means our means of resupplying are very limited. Chief Pasvogel has decided to send a plea to Feathisia, he's certain they will understand our cause."
 FEZ_insipire_pd:0 "Crusade Against Crime"
 FEZ_insipire_pd_desc:0 "It must be clear at all times what we fight for. A lawful society where every griffon can live in peace and prosperity, without fear of being extorted. Remind the griffons what is our cause."
 FEZ_prepare_for_raids:0 "The Cost of Preparation"
 FEZ_prepare_for_raids_desc:0 "Training has proceeded up to plan, and a new generation of policegriffs stands ready to dispense justice and fight crime. Soon enough, we're taking the battle to the villainous holdouts."
 FEZ_do_it_by_the_book:0 "The Code of Law"
 FEZ_do_it_by_the_book_desc:0 "It cannot be stressed how important it is to do everything by the book. We shall bring the lawbreakers to justice, but we shall never compromise on our ideals. We shall never stoop so low to become like them. Otherwise, our cause is hollow and the good people of Fezera will not trust us."
 FEZ_hunt_corruption:0 "Root Out Corruption"
 FEZ_hunt_corruption_desc:0 "There is corruption at seemingly every aspect of our society - industry, the militia command, the Fezzerian University and even the city council itself. That much has been very clear to everygriff for years - yet nogriff has done anything about it. It is time to enact justice on these horrid enablers of corruption."
 FEZ_start_raids:0 "Strike the Criminal Holds"
 FEZ_start_raids_desc:0 "The Fezeraanse Politie is ready to remove the sinful element from our society. There's no doubt it will be a tough battle - the thugs have many hideouts and even more griffons - but with justice and law on our side, we'll end their operations once and for all. And remember, do it by the book."
 FEZ_rally_public:0 "The Public Opinion"
 FEZ_rally_public_desc:0 "The commonfolk must know of our cause! For years, the thieves have been conducting a campaign of public relations to paint themselves in a good light, while we're the oppressors. No more! The public must know everything! Expose every scrap of their real intentions!"
 FEZ_defeat_of_maf:0 "Prison for the Family"
 FEZ_defeat_of_maf_desc:0 "We've caught all of the Penose family leaders, with Don Holveder found hiding in his villa. With the leaders captured, the mobsters have fractured and become disorganised. They shall receive a fair and just trial - although there's no doubt most of them will spend a very long time behind bars."
 FEZ_defeat_of_smugglers:0 "End of the Smuggling Operations"
 FEZ_defeat_of_smugglers_desc:0 "We've busted "Mayor" Godard and almost half of the city council trying to escape to Haukland with a fast ship. They shall return every bit they scammed from the people!"
 FEZ_take_control_of_country:0 "Restoration of Order"
 FEZ_take_control_of_country_desc:0 "With the culpable elements in Fezera defeated, a power vacuum has sprung up. We can now finally step up and begin improving Fezera. To the detractors who believe we'll become the next dictators, we say to look at the law, and remember that we are accountable to the people."
 FEZ_safter_place:0 "A Safe Country"
 FEZ_safter_place_desc:0 "Already, Fezera feels like a better, different place. The griffons conduct their daily business freely, and overall, Fezera is set to become a land free of fear. Thus, we shall encourage immigration to our beautiful town, as long as they pay respects to the law."
 FEZ_reopen_skoolz:0 "Reopen the Places of Learning"
 FEZ_reopen_skoolz_desc:0 "While illiteracy has never been a serious problem in Fezera, the truth remains that most griffons did not receive more than the most basic of education. Thus, we shall open new schools and expand the current faculties, so that everygriff can be properly knowledgeable."
 FEZ_more_factory_jobs:0 "Employment for the People"
 FEZ_more_factory_jobs_desc:0 "The common griffon could hardly find decent work before, as the most important positions were filled by felons, who only hired their friends and family. Nepotism and cronyism shall no longer occur in Fezera, and everygriffon shall have a fair chance at finding work. We expect production to bloom as a result."
 FEZ_better_trains:0 "A New Railroad"
 FEZ_better_trains_desc:0 "We may be a country dominated by a single large city, but it doesn't mean that the countryside should be left underdeveloped. To begin correcting this, a railroad will be constructed, connecting every major settlement of the land."
 FEZ_reopen_academy:0 "Fezzerian Police Academy"
 FEZ_reopen_academy_desc:0 "The Fezzerian Police Academy is a prestigious location in which all policegriffs received their proper training - or they would have, were it not for all budget cuts we received under the rule of "Mayor" Godard. Now that we control where the Idols go, it shall regain its splendour."
 FEZ_stronger_than_ever:0 "Peace and Harmony"
 FEZ_stronger_than_ever_desc:0 "Law and order have been restored to Fezera. The griffons no longer face extortion or unjust taxation, and the Fezeraanse Politie has been brought back to its full strength. The people are convinced by our reforms, and they fully trust and cooperate with us. Good work, everygriffon!"
 FEZ_hunt_evil:0 "Hunting Down the Stragglers"
 FEZ_hunt_evil_desc:0 "Despite our victories, there are still some griffons who threaten the prosperity of our fair city. The amount of crimes reported has been rather low, but that doesn't mean we can rest. No, the criminal element cannot be allowed to persist, lest it becomes a widespread problem again."
 FEZ_war_prep:0 "Prepare for War"
 FEZ_war_prep_desc:0 "With our internal matters settled, we've begun to observe the situation in our neighbours and Griffonia at large. We believe that our current forces are insufficient to properly handle an external incursion, and so we shall expand our ranks."
 FEZ_special_academy:0 "First Graduates"
 FEZ_special_academy_desc:0 "The accelerated course at the academy has already produced results! Two morally upstanding griffons have completed their assignments in record time, and are ready to command our forces."
 FEZ_war_with_evil:0 "Investigate the Source"
 FEZ_war_with_evil_desc:0 "It is known that many issues that have plagued Fezera have been "imported" from Skyfall. As upstanding members of the force, it is our duty to conduct a thorough investigation in whether should the nation itself be held accountable for their crimes, or should we join them as partners. This will determine the future of our city-state for the near time."
 FEZ_ally_aqulia:0 "Friendship with Aquileia"
 FEZ_ally_aqulia_desc:0 "The griffons of Aquileia are some of the most fervent supporters of Harmony on the continent, and we should aim towards establishing an alliance with them. This way, our safety will be forever ensured, and we focus exclusively on keeping to our internal matters."
 FEZ_ally_republic:0 "The Republican Cause"
 FEZ_ally_republic_desc:0 "[FAT.GetLeader] is a staunch supporter of democracy and justice, having fought for years against tyranny and malefactors, and is the natural choice for our protector. Surely, when he sees how upright our society is, he'll accept our request for protection? We certainly hope so."
 
 ##Army
 FEZ_army_start:0 "Establish the Fezzerian Forces"
 FEZ_army_start_desc:0 "Since Fezera declared independence, its armed forces have been nothing more than a glorified city guard, unsuitable for anything more than defending the streets and chasing away lost animals. As our place in the world is becoming more and more apparent, we've decided to correct this issue, and establish a proper land force."
 FEZ_expand_army:0 "Expand the Recruitment Quotas"
 FEZ_expand_army_desc:0 "At the current moment, the city guard is comprised of mostly volunteers. Reasonable for a small city-state, but if we wish to expand our influence in the world, the number of recruits must rise. Our recruiters shall start a grand recruitment drive, to attract even more volunteers."
 FEZ_mobile_start:0 "De Nieuwe Steunpilaar"
 FEZ_mobile_start_desc:0 "As seen in the recent wars, mobility and armoured vehicles are the future of warfare. With some effort, we can transform our army into a highly mobile strike force, ending the battle before it even begins."
 FEZ_motrized:0 "An Army on Wheels"
 FEZ_motrized_desc:0 "The idea of using trucks and automobiles to carry troops and supplies is not widespread in Fezera. If we desire to have a mobile army, we need to design our own transportation vehicle and train troops in its most efficient usage."
 FEZ_tanks:0 "Light Tank Experiments"
 FEZ_tanks_desc:0 "The quintessential armoured vehicle is a quick one - able to shrug off small arms fire and secure objectives while the remainder of the army cleans up stragglers. This shall be our primary tactic."
 FEZ_bigger_tanks:0 "Improved Armoured Vehicles"
 FEZ_bigger_tanks_desc:0 "Initial tests with our light tank models has been successful, but our generals feel that a more heavily armoured vehicle that does not sacrifice too much on speed would be better suited for leading the vanguard. Luckily, we have just the designs for those ready and waiting for approval."
 FEZ_mobile_doctrine2:0 "Improving Our Doctrine"
 FEZ_mobile_doctrine2_desc:0 "Our strategies, training and tactics could always use improvement. If we cannot come up with our own ideas on how to do that, then we shall employ foreign designs. We must not fall behind in military thinking."
 FEZ_better_tank_factories:0 "Streamlined Tank Production"
 FEZ_better_tank_factories_desc:0 "We've done our best to drag ourselves into the forefront of modern warfare. While the troops can still benefit from more training, already we reap the benefits - our workers are producing tanks and trucks much more efficiently."
 FEZ_superior_start:0 "Vertrouw Op Artillerie"
 FEZ_superior_start_desc:0 "Fezzerian industry is too small to support a large motorised force. Instead, we shall continue trusting in the old reliables - rifles and shells to blast away our foes."
 FEZ_bigger_guns:0 "Replace the Rusty Guns"
 FEZ_bigger_guns_desc:0 "Our artillery pieces are little more than leftovers from Skyfall, or were obtained from suspicious sources. Efforts shall be placed in obtaining the newest models."
 FEZ_special_forces:0 "Special Forces"
 FEZ_special_forces_desc:0 "Regular infantry performs their job admirably, but for the most difficult situations, we're going to need to establish an elite fighting force to handle these special missions."
 FEZ_better_weapons:0 "Improving Our Soldiers' Equipment"
 FEZ_better_weapons_desc:0 "A quick examination of our rifles shows that they're woefully outdated. Same goes for our support equipment - it is a priority to bring them to contemporary standards."
 FEZ_superior_doctrine2:0 "Perfecting Our Strategy"
 FEZ_superior_doctrine2_desc:0 "In order to maximise the firepower of our army, the troops must be trained better in coordinating with each other, and our generals and officers need to be aware of every tactic at their disposal."
 FEZ_hardened_troops:0 "A Proud Elite"
 FEZ_hardened_troops_desc:0 "We've come a long way from our humble beginnings, but the Fezzerian soldier is now a proud warrior, willing to push himself to the limit in service to his country. Meanwhile, the ordnance factories have perfected their casting methods, producing a higher amount of heavy weaponry. Fezera shall never fall!"
 
 #Airforce
 FEZ_air_start:0 "Claws in the Sky"
 FEZ_air_start_desc:0 "The ever changing aspect of warfare requires us to continuously adapt and overcome any obstacles. Airplanes have been making great progress in the past decade, and we find ourselves lacking any of them to defend our skies. This changes now, with the establishment of the Fezzerian Air Force."
 FEZ_new_airports:0 "New Plane Hangars"
 FEZ_new_airports_desc:0 "Before we could even think about putting our planes to use, we must first construct hangars and airfields for their usage. Fezera has many empty fields, thus we're not lacking in space for them."
 FEZ_air_doctrine_start:0 "Choosing Our Approach"
 FEZ_air_doctrine_start_desc:0 "The way our pilots operate is part of a larger strategy, not something to be chosen randomly. We must choose a suitable doctrine for our airforce and its future composition."
 FEZ_fighters:0 "Procure Fighter Designs"
 FEZ_fighters_desc:0 "The role of airplanes is best suited for directly supporting our troops in the field. The airforce will be tied to their performance, and the first step is to find a suitable fighter design. Our more developed neighbours will be more than happy to sell us one of their dated models."
 FEZ_heavy_fighters:0 "Sky Fortresses"
 FEZ_heavy_fighters_desc:0 "Our current fighter designs are not durable enough, nor do they have sufficient range for some of our more demanding missions. A new prototype will be developed, carrying higher firepower as well."
 FEZ_air_doctrine_f:0 "The Way We Fight"
 FEZ_air_doctrine_f_desc:0 "Cooperation between airplanes is a requirement if we desire to maximise their performance. They should make use of every resource and tactic in the book to perform optimally."
 FEZ_cas:0 "Close and Personal"
 FEZ_cas_desc:0 "A specialised plane is required to directly support our troops in the field, but one that does not carry the drawbacks of bombers. By modifying our fighters, we can develop a slower, but more devastating close support plane."
 FEZ_fighter_doctrine:0 "Fighter Formations"
 FEZ_fighter_doctrine_desc:0 "Additional training is required to improve the coordination and effectiveness of the ground forces and pilots. Performance in the field is lacking, and we require better results."
 FEZ_bombers:0 "Develop a Bomber Model"
 FEZ_bombers_desc:0 "We shall bomb our foes to dust - whether it is their troops, their fortifications or their cities - we shall never relent until there is nothing left! But to achieve this grand design, we require an airplane to carry this explosive payload."
 FEZ_bomber_doctrine:0 "Bomber Tactics"
 FEZ_bomber_doctrine_desc:0 "Our nascent bomber squadrons require improved training, in order to perform effectively. There is more to them than just piloting an airplane and dropping bombs."
 FEZ_naval_bombers:0 "Bomb the Seas"
 FEZ_naval_bombers_desc:0 "Warships, despite carrying anti-air batteries, are still vulnerable to attacks from the skies, if they are not supported by their airplanes. We shall take advantage of this by developing a bomber model intended exclusively for missions at sea."
 FEZ_bomber_doctrine2:0 "Bombs Away!"
 FEZ_bomber_doctrine2_desc:0 "The bomber pilots have been returning with better results, but they must still learn how to coordinate with their escorts, as well as develop methods to perfect their timing of payload release."
 FEZ_strat_bombers:0 "Their Most Vulnerable Target"
 FEZ_strat_bombers_desc:0 "Without their industrial production, the forces of our foes will soon disintegrate. Although none of our current bomber models have the range, payload or armour to carry out such a dangerous mission, this will change soon."
 FEZ_air_production:0 "Optimised Airplane Production"
 FEZ_air_production_desc:0 "Our extensive focus on airplane research and development has given us great insight on how to reduce production costs. Soon enough, every pilot in Fezera will have his own plane, and a reserve as well!"
 
 ##Boring Navy, sorry Captain
 FEZ_naval_start:0 "The Vast Ocean"
 FEZ_naval_start_desc:0 "While Fezera can claim to be somewhat influential in naval trade, it is nothing compared to our neighbours in Skyfall. This situation must change, immediately. We must have a warfleet to protect our trade."
 FEZ_large_fleet:0 "A Grand Proposal for the Fleet"
 FEZ_large_fleet_desc:0 "Fezera shall rule the waves! A grand fleet to match the glorious Imperial fleet of old shall be designed, built, and led by our finest naval strategist."
 FEZ_small_fleet:0 "A Realistic Proposal for the Fleet"
 FEZ_small_fleet_desc:0 "Unfortunately, Fezera cannot hope to construct any sort of large fleet for a very long time. Instead, we shall continue depending on fast cruisers to waylay enemy ships, and produce submarines to sink our enemies' trade convoys."
 FEZ_battleship:0 "Battleship Designs"
 FEZ_battleship_desc:0 "What we require is a grand warship. One that puts every other naval vessel to shame! A sturdy battleship, even a lonesome, will ensure our dominance at seas."
 FEZ_battleship_doctrine1:0 "A Fleet in Being"
 FEZ_battleship_doctrine1_desc:0 "Coordinating multiple warships to stay in formation is a serious effort that requires proper training on the seagriffs' part. Not to mention, the ship's captains will require an extensive amount of time spent on choosing their strategy! The payoffs will be worthwhile, however."
 FEZ_aircraft_carrier:0 "Carrier Ship Blueprints"
 FEZ_aircraft_carrier_desc:0 "Carriers and carrier based planes are set to become crucial in the future of naval warfare, and we believe having some of our own would complement well our battleships."
 FEZ_battleship_doctrine2:0 "Dominate the Seas"
 FEZ_battleship_doctrine2_desc:0 "Excellent work is being done on improving our fleet's capabilities, but we can always improve our tactics. We shall study our potential foes' doctrines and adapt to them accordingly."
 FEZ_battle_cruiser:0 "Armoured Cruisers"
 FEZ_battle_cruiser_desc:0 "Although we cannot field a fleet comprised fully of battleships due to multiple reasons, we can instead modify our heavy ship hulls to carry less weight, while preserving its firepower and speed."
 FEZ_submaries:0 "Import Submarine Models"
 FEZ_submaries_desc:0 "Our initial attempts to produce our own submarine have resulted in a failure. We're lucky that nobody drowned when the prototype sunk! We've decided it would be more feasible to look to our neighbours for a reliable model. If they will not provide one, we'll have to make contact with distant shapeshifting creatures..."
 FEZ_submarine_doctrine1:0 "Convoy Interception"
 FEZ_submarine_doctrine1_desc:0 "As our fleet is insufficient to properly battle other, much stronger fleets on the high seas, we will focus on efforts on sinking their more vulnerable targets. A war of attrition, as it is."
 FEZ_submarine_doctrine2:0 "Starving Our Foes"
 FEZ_submarine_doctrine2_desc:0 "The submarines shall operate every day of the week, regardless of the hour - we shall not relent until the enemy is depleted of their supplies and resources. This will force their surrender."
 FEZ_cruisers:0 "Fast Raiders"
 FEZ_cruisers_desc:0 "The ever reliable cruiser is a key part of our fleet. Quick, but carrying sufficient firepower, they can compete with the heavy ships with proper tactics. Still, our aging designs require an update."
 FEZ_heavy_cruisers:0 "Quick and Dangerous"
 FEZ_heavy_cruisers_desc:0 "A natural progression from our light cruisers, the heavy cruiser shall carry a far greater amount of guns and armour. Existing ships will be retrofitted with the new modifications."
 FEZ_dockyards:0 "Expand Our Naval Production"
 FEZ_dockyards_desc:0 "Our existing ports and shipyards are incapable of handling the increased demand by our increased naval spending. We require an expansion of our naval facilities, if we wish to maintain our fleet."
 FEZ_better_landingcraft:0 "Safe Landings"
 FEZ_better_landingcraft_desc:0 "Naval invasions are some of the most dangerous and complex operations we can put into action, and casualty rates are high as the troops scramble to secure the objectives. We've thought of several ideas to improve the chances of our forces making it to the landing zone, starting with our transport ships."
 FEZ_aquatic_fighters:0 "Fezzerian Marines"
 FEZ_aquatic_fighters_desc:0 "Victory at sea is a prerequisite for a successful naval invasion - and we believe it would be best to train a specialised force dedicated to amphibious warfare. They shall be the first to take steps on the enemies' shores."

 #Events
 fezera.100.t:0 "A Daring Raid"
 fezera.100.d:0 "During the cold night, the seedy underbelly of Fezera did not slumber. For weeks now they had prepared for this, a bold strike at the heart of their bitter foe: Fezeraanse Politie, the law enforcement agency of Fezera. For years now they had been a thorn on their side, refusing to let them operate in peace and hurting their profit margins. Many bosses had been arrested, shipments seized and illegal operations unveiled. The time had come for payback.\n\nThe criminals struck suddenly, all at once across the city. The police department of every precinct was targeted, with griffons carrying weapons smuggled from abroad. Fires were set and explosives thrown, with policegriffs on night shift being caught by surprise and shot without mercy. Those that managed to hide called for reinforcements and woke up their comrades who rushed to action.\n\nFlames spread and sirens echoed in the darkness of the night as law and crime clashed. As the sun rose on an ash-covered city, the end result of the fighting was clear for all to see."
 fezera.100.a:0 "Chaos reigns."
 fezera.100.b:0 "Order and justice prevail!"
 
 fezera.1.t:0 "Fezera Gazette - \nPolice Force Disbanded!"
 fezera.1.d:0 "Following the destruction that occurred last night, our city-state of Fezera has been left in turmoil. A majority of the police force has perished in the fighting, and what remained could not be reached or found. The prominent citizens have implored for Mayor [FEZ.GetLeader] to step up and provide aid for our griffons in grey. Mayor Godard had this to say at the City Council's emergency meeting:\n\n"The Politie has shown to be incompetent at their jobs. They have shamed the good name of Fezera and as such, I declare with the Council's full approval, the disbandment of the Fezeraanse Politie. Rest assured, good citizens, the perpetrators behind yesterday's crimes will be found, but we need new protectors. That is all, no questions."\n\nWe at the Fezera Gazette implore our readers to stay at their homes and avoid going outside at night. Look after each other as best as you can."

However, in recent years, their diplomats have gradually become much more professional and accommodating.\n\nToday, their ambassador has requested a private meeting with our foreign affair minister, a griff with who he has formed a close relationship. The meeting saw the ambassador put forward a deeply unorthodox offer. He has requested a formal guarantee of Fezera's independence. Nothing surprising ever since the Free City decided to try their claws at nation building but now, he has offered a true compensation for it. He has offered that Fezera would set up a financial system that would be able to launder money on a massive scale to our discretion. Funds could be freely available with absolute protection from Fezera against any enquiries. Fezera would essentially create the perfect slush fund.\n\nThe minister has not been in contact with anyone since the meeting so should we decide to go forward with it, we would be safe to do so.

It's disappointing but we have no time for petty grudges or entertaining naivety.

The truth is he was there to present the full secret deal to a clawful of trusted members of our administration. The Fezzerians have set up a financial holding for various securities under the name of Beakstream. Officially, it is a new semi-public institution in Fezera that will allow various financial institutions and brokers to have their securities available for clearing and settlement. Considering the number of financial organizations in the conquered Skyfall, this is all pretty unsuspicious. The complexity of the system and the secrecy rules for banking that Fereza has specially tailored for it will allow us to divert fund in perfect secrecy for all purposes. We essentially now have our very own slush fund to use for both political gain and covert actions.\n\nThe difficult part of the operation has been to defend our policy to let [FEZ.GetNameDef] remain a free nation. We have downplayed the importance of the Aquilephone community in Fezera and emphasized our attachment to peace in this troubled era. This is also where Beakstream has already proven deeply useful to help smooth the edges and fund our propaganda on the matter more effectively."

Those Skyfall chicks were no match for our typewriters!" Don [FEZ.GetLeader] sat in the ruined Trade Council chambers alongside his top henchgriffs. His loyal underlings were having a time of their life celebrating their victory. The destruction could have certainly been avoided, but the defenders needed an explosive approach before surrendering. Still, the Familie performed admirably and now the wealthiest cities on western coast were theirs. Not bad for a griffon who used to wander with empty pockets on the streets of Griffton.\n\n"Alright birds, settle down. Grimbeak, stop stealing crystals from the chandelier, you can loot things later." The underbosses reluctantly settled down and listened. "Our work is far from done. These Skyfall griffons had little love for their rulers, but they ain't gonna jump in our claws just because we came here. If we're gonna have these people respect us, and not treat us like classless thugs, we're gonna have some actual administration." The mobsters moaned in anguished at the thought of doing paperwork. "Not us, you fools! Plenty of eggheads who'll do that for a couple of Idols. As long as stay to our good side, and show these folks the Fezzerian way, we'll be swimming in Idols double quick. Combined with the fleet we've taken, we're gonna be set for a lifetime."\n\nThe griffons conceded to their boss' superior logic, and went off to do their jobs. Don Holveder remained seated for a while, pondering on his many plans for the future of Fezera and Skyfall."
 fezera.19.d_neutral:0 "Mayor [FEZ.GetLeader] felt very much satisfied with himself as he walked through the mansion of his old nemesis. It was such a shame that the old bird died before he could see his work undone, but Godard was content regardless. At long last, the injustice against his family has been resolved, and he would retrieve his stolen family's fortune. So what if they cheated on scales? Skyfall was supposed to be purely about business, with no rules! Instead they got their wealth taken and kicked out to a nearby slum called Fezera. When you're at rock bottom, there's no other way but up, and Godard has succeeded against all odds.\n\nHis personal grudge settled, the matter at claw remained the integration of Skyfall. Admittedly, the looting and pillaging his birds did after the conquest did little favours to anygriff, but that's nothing a little bit of positive public relations and rebuilding programs couldn't correct. The real prize was the Skyfall Port, of course. Once he got the workers to clear our the wrecks and rubble, real trade could commence. He would rebuild his family's fortune, no, triple it! Perhaps once the pile of Idols became large enough, he could even retire with his associates to a distant Zebrican island.\n\n[FEZ.GetLeader] took one last gaze at Guichard's portrait, sneering at his image. Even in death he looked so uptight and humourless. Thus he spoke a few choice words of spite..."
 fezera.19.d_dem:0 ""Officer Kop. Have the criminals been caught?"\n\n"Yes, sir. Skyfall has been taken with minimal losses, after we've bribed over the mercenaries to support our side. I don't like dealing with such treacherous griffons, but a deal is a deal. The city has avoided major destruction and we've got their leaders locked up and ready for processing." Police chief [FEZ.GetLeader] felt very assuaged with the success of the operation. His griffons in grey certainly weren't used to fighting as a proper armed force, but the equipment held fast in the chaotic urban warfare. It was little different from fighting the Penose back in the streets of Fezera, after all.\n\nWith the surrender of the Skyfall government, he was finally free to conduct his investigations to the fullest, and the truth would be revealed. Justice would finally come to the thousands of Fezzerians who were swindled by Skyfall merchants, the local mobsters who have funded the criminals in Fezera would be found, and Pasvogel would finally discover the killer of his partner. An officer's death could not be forgiven. The police chief briefly pondered if he allowed his personal grudge to mire his sense of justice, but concluded that it was necessary to bring law and order back to Fezera and Skyfall.\n\n"Give my compliments to the force, Officer Kop. They've all performed above and beyond the call of duty, and I couldn't be more prouder of them. But, we now have an entire country to run. The citizens see us as liberators and we must not betray their trust. We've got a lot of work to do."

Last time, one of the goons didn't feel so good after the boss found out he was stealing the cut.\n\n"We're all here, boss. What's the occasion?", one of the underlings asked impatiently. [FEZ.GetLeader] swiveled around in his leather chair, pushing aside a copious stack of coins and papers. "Listen up, birds. We've been doing good for ourselves these last few years, nobody's denying that, but our margins are getting lower. It's time to expand our markets, if you understand my meaning.", the Don calmly explained while flipping a singular golden Idol.\n\n"But where, boss?", a more slower minion inquired. Without missing a beat, the boss continued: "We've been given black eyes by those meddlesome merchants for too long. Here's the plot to capture your greed and intrigue - we're going to take Skyfall for all that it's got!" A raucous laughter spread among the underbosses, as they discussed what they would do with the wealth of Skyfall. Goods from all over the world, riches beyond imagination and a flotilla larger than anything they ever had!\n\nA calm voice of reason rose among the chatter. "Eh, boss, how we gonna take over Skyfall? They're pretty tough, and they got those weirdo mercs too."

This wasn't as dapper as his Wingbardian suits but there definitely was something grand about these military uniforms. A Holveder in a field marshal uniform definitely had some style, as they say. He turned to his wife who was leisurely waiting on the nearby sofa. "Whadda ya think, liefje?", he said. She raised her head and smiled, a bit bemused. "Handsome. Though if you had told me I would be married to a lawgriff, I'd have laughed. Poor ol' mama would have loved it." Willem laughed. The old crow would have hated him even more. He turned to the tailor. "Where's Cor?" he asked. The tailor went out to get him.\n\nCor Holveder entered the room. The young bird was an odd sight, tall as he was, in the awkwardly tight Fezzerian uniform. He looked uncomfortable and embarrassed. Yet, Willem was beyond proud. His son, that big old goose, was now a leader of griffons, a military griff. He smiled and approached.\n\n"Beautiful, son. Like an Arcturian knight, except the kind who comes back with the broads!" Cor blushed lightly and let out a small wimpy "daaad". He may have been serious with his crew but in a family context, he always remained that small shy fledgling. Well... A very large and sturdy fledgling... Willem came closer and removed the military tie, giving his son a more wild and proud look. He smiled. "Better now. We're Holveder. Not knights." The tailor protested: "Sir, with all due respect, this is highly irregular." Willem raised his voice: "Shut up. I say what is or isn't regular around here. Out, now." The griff meekly left the room and Willem took his son to the balcony.\n\nThey looked over Fezera. It was a nice view, despite the somewhat grey weather that always reigned over the peninsula. Willem took out two cigars from his pocket and offered one to his son. "Caballan", he commented as he lighted them. The two spent a small moment in silence, smoking and watching the city.\n\n"Cor. I know what they say in the ranks. They think it's all a scam but know this: it ain't. We got rich from this city and despite the potholes, the weather and the fact. But it's our home. Sure, we could take what we like and leave for a nice cozy place in Zebrica but that's not what I want. It may be a dump but I got used to it. I sweated here, and I made myself big here.

He arranged for it to be organized at the Prinsklauw, one of the finest hotels in Skyfall, and it had been packed like never before. All the empty suits in Skyfall were present. Word got around that the Gambino-Holveder wedding would set the stage for the next decade and everygriff wanted to mark some points with the new bosses in town. But more importantly, the ambassador of Wingbardy was there and now, Willem had a letter from none other than [WNG.GetLeader] himself promising a guarantee of Fezera's independence. Don Gambino had fulfilled his promise. And yet, the most beautiful thing for Willem had been to see his son, dancing with his bride Allegra, and the smile on his wife's face. Yes, it had been good to be a gangster but some things were better than that.\n\nAs Willem entered his room, he unbuttoned his shirt, glad to finally breathe a bit. A noise. He raised an eyebrow.

"I thought you would be having a wedding night..." She smirked. "I would. But your son can't hold his liquor." Willem frowned and sat. They remained silent for a moment, the only noise in the room being the icecube of Allegra's glass clinking. She sighed. "Your son... He's not the brightest candle on the chandelier, is he?", she said, putting her glass against her temple to underscore her point.

She kept laughing, adding: "Non hai capito una sega!". He didn't speak Wingbardian and just waited her to finish. She calmed herself and answered. "The truth is, papà, that you played yourself. You have no idea, do you?" He blinked. What the Tartarus was she talking about? "I'm nothing and so are you and your son. Your whole marriage plan is a scam. You think a Gambino wants to deal seriously with a poor stronzo from Fezera? It's all a plan to put his goons up north and set up a Gambino del Nord family once he no longer needs you. You don't have enough griffs to control even a small provincial family, let alone the Gambino." Anger had slowly left Willem. She got under his feathers but she made sense.

I know all about how he does things. And I can tell you all about it." Willem's mind was racing. That was all inside knowledge he didn't expect but he had one question: "Why are you doing this?" "Because I'm tired of being nothing. And I'll make sure my sweet old father remembers what I am the day he gets thrown in his grave. I'll be Gambino de Nord and it'll be spelled Holveder.

Too many hired muscle in Fezera had penose ties or had more rewarding opportunities in Haukland or Skyfall. As for the mercenaries, they were very good for the battlefield but rather useless in the streets. Then arrived Myles Pawtner. Hailing from Bronzehill, he had served for a time in the Imperial army before setting up as a private investigator in Feathisia. And thus Beagle Eyes was born. He had amassed a small fortune solving cases for rich citizens and the nobility but his methods had become increasingly violent. What caused him to pack up and leave with his employees was a fiscal scandal that may or may not have been caused by Pawtner spending too much time around the wife of a top fiscal inspector. And so, he ended up in Fezera.\n\nGodard received him with interest. They talked a lot about his history back in Feathisia and even bonded a bit over their mutual distaste for fezzes. However, he still had some reservations.\n\n"Now, mister Pawtner, there is something I have to ask you. As an employee, you may encounter some... conflicts of interest when serving Fezera and its laws. After all, it is a rather innovative approach to law and order, of which there certainly are kinks to work out. May I ask how you would go about addressing them?"\n\n"Conflict of interest? There won't be one.", the dog calmly said. Godard had his attention peaked. "Oh? Why is that?" Pawtner continued: "As you said, I'm an employee. What the boss says goes."\n\nGodard smiled.

And it applies all the more to those who don't do the actual thieving and murdering.\n\nEnter Jeannot Stoemeling, one of the accountant of the Familie and a griff very much not looking the part of the gangster. Frail, meak and snivelling, he was forced to go on the run when the drive by on the mayor didn't work out. But contrary to most criminals of the Familie, his family was not aware of his business partners. And when they were forced to hide in rundown flats in the worst neighborhoods of Fezera, they got infuriated as spoiled middle-class families do when robbed of their not all that well-earned comfort. This lead our dear accountant to evade his "bodyguards" and make a tobacco run to get some fresh air. And to run into one of our good Beagle Eyes employee.\n\nNeedless to say, he got no cigarette out of it and was instead introduced to the luxury of our new "interrogation rooms". From our reports, he didn't even need a slap to start talking. And now, we have intelligence into both the finances of the Familie and their inner circle.

While it was tempting to just raid the place, Stoemeling explained to our griffs that in case anything dangerous happened in the region, they would evacuate it at all cost. And that Holveder would only trust his son to oversee that kind of operation.\n\nNow, when you leave near the sea, what is dangerous? If you thought hurricane, congratulations, you got the same idea as two now ex-employees. The answer was Hauklandish raiders. Despite all that had happened, Godard still maintained good relations with some in Meyer's surroundings. And so did the Familie. So Godard called in a few favours to spread the word around the Isles that a raid could happen around the area where the farm is located. And through the wonders of pirates' incapability of keeping their beak shut, the news arrived in Fezera. And so Cor Holveder arrived with a few trucks and a squad of gangsters to save their stock. After all, they trusted their Hauklandish contacts enough to tip them off but not to the point of trusting them not to loot their little hidden bank.\n\nUnfortunately for them, Godard was waiting for them with a full squad of Beagle Eyes employees armed with the best weapons available. What ensued was not much of a fight. The first truck of the convoy got knocked over by a landmine. Two ambushed machine guns took care of the rest. Cor Holveder barely survived.

Stoemeling died in the process, sure, but he had served his purpose anyway. Now, the Family had been cornered and what had to happen happened: Holveder made contact, asking for a meeting. And Godard obliged. They agreed to meet in a small bar on the west side of Fezera, on the territory of a largely neutral penose that had no stakes in the fight between Godard and Holveder.\n\nIt was late during the evening and it rained outside when Holveder arrived. He looked tired, the poor bird. Godard was already seated at the counter, leisurely drinking a pint of beer and smoking a cigar. As Holveder sat down, the mayor noticed that his nemesis was wearing a black armband as a sign of grief. Apparently, he did like the young Cor. The two griffs did not greet each other. Instead, Holveder simply said "This has gone on long enough". Godard blew some smoke: "Well you started it. We had a good thing going on." Holveder answered with weariness in his voice: "It was not personal. There was an opportunity and I tried to take it. You would have done the same." The mayor shrugged. His interlocutor continued "You won. It's said. What now?". The mayor drank a sip of his beer and answered nonchalantly "It's over for you. You know that, right?" The mobster sighed: "You've already taken my son. Is that not enough?" No answer. "Look. Just let my wife go. Just her." Godard smirked. "I'm afraid that is not possible". Holveder froze in despair. Godard added: "She has been dead for thirty minutes now. I'm afraid your compound was not artillery-proof." Holveder stood up, yelling "You mon..." before getting shot several time by the bartender, a Beagle Eyes employee. Godard didn't look as his goon made sure the mobster was dead and simply drank his beer while outside, the mobsters protecting Holveder were getting shredded by machine guns.\n\nAfter the gunfight died down, Pawtner entered the bar, bloody but calm as always. He sat next to Godard where Holveder previously sat. The mayor looked at him.\n"Do you have any pups, Myles?"\n"I do not, boss."\n"Good.""

And for all their big talk about how much better they are than Godard and his minions, it does sound like these birds are much less business savvy.

While their help is appreciated by the current instructors who have a much lesser workload as a result, the same cannot be said from the recruits.

 fezera.114.d:0 "It was late at night and Wilfried Pasvogel was staring at his files in his home office. He had been drinking, much more than he was used to and more than would ever be wise. He was tired. So much blood had been spilled already and it seemed like they were not progressing. This cesspool of a city seemed bent on preventing him and his fellow policegriffs from enacting any kind of justice. And at the center of it all lied Godard. That damn corrupt and incompetent tyrant. Every day he was prancing around, helping all kinds of criminals while destroying justice and law enforcement while citizens barely got around in the city. And for what? For his personal profit alone. He had no plan. No ethics. Nothing. And yet, he was at the helm of the state. Why did they even try? It was all beginning and ending for him. Something had to be done. And he knew just why.\n\nPasvogel angrily cleared his desk and grabbed his gun. He put it in his holster and grabbed his coat. But when he opened his door, he saw his daughter who was about to knock. She stepped back, looking afraid. He asked her what she was doing there. "I have an exam tomorrow and... I know you have so much work but I need your help for this." She showed him her criminal law textbook. He paused and simply smiled. "Of course. I'll just... Grab a glass of water first." Ashamed, he went and freshened up.\n\nThe two began to revise. Reading the principles that had inspired him to become a policegriff calmed him. It reminded him that justice through assassination was no justice at all. And as they were revising, he noticed that she knew her course perfectly. And then he understood what she was doing. He felt like a fool but more importantly, he never was so proud of her."

The whole family had come to the city to congratulate her and they had a large party. He had never been so proud.\n\nDuring the party, Wilfried had a chat with his daughter and her uncle, a lawyer back in Westtry. He was telling her that after seeing her grade, he wanted her to come and do an internship at his firm. She thanked him but she explained that being a lawyer was not what she wanted to do. Wilfried frowned: "It is a good opportunity, it would be a shame to pass that up." She smiled and continued: "I know, dad, but I feel that I'm not suited for being a lawyer." She went on to explain that she when she started to think about her studies, what she wanted was following into Wilfried's footsteps: to serve the law and uphold it. Justice was what drove her throughout the studies.\n\n"This city has so many lawyers already. And you have brought in so many policegriffs into service. So I thought that what is really needed are more judges. This is what I want to do... What do you think?"\n\nThe uncle smiled: "It's a tough career. But a good one."\nWilfried smiled too."

 fezera.116.d:0 "The Police Station was abuzz, despite the number of officers hospitalized after the operations of the previous months. It had been a tough one but fortunately, they had prevailed. Fezera had prevailed. Wilfried let out a long sigh of relief among his piles of paperwork. He didn't even stopped to think about it until now. That January night had been a huge landmark but a costly one. The Familie and others criminals were still running amok in the city but they would endure. They had to.\n\nA knock came from his door. Wilfried raised his eyes. Gwenaël Godard, followed by an annoyed officer protesting against the intrusion. The mayor smiled at Wilfried. "Good evening chief", he cheerfully said. "I tried to tell mister mayor that you were busy but..." Wilfried interrupted the officer: "It's alright, Dries. That will be all.". The officer saluted and left without further comment. Godard casually strolled around the office, looking at the various documents on the walls. "How may I help you, sir?" Godard finally looked at him and smiled.\n\n"It is impressive work you've done lately. I'm impressed. Soon, the scum of Fezera may very well be all behind bars." "We're simply doing our duty." Godard chuckled.\n"Of course... Of course. Modest as always." He leaned against the desk. "Unfortunately, you've not just been modest, have you now? People are talking, you know. The councilgriffs are talking. They're worried you're just replacing the thugs among the streets instead of arresting them. They're not interest in frontier justice. We're in Fezera after all, not Weter. Now, I would never doubt your methods but you need to help me out here. I've done my best to placate them but you're going to suffer some budget cuts. I wanted you to hear it from me."\nThe mayor looked at him with a contrite face but Wilfried barely answered. "Will my griffs in the hospital be taken care of at least?" Godard looked shocked. "But of course! You have my word on that. You know what? Here's my card with my personal number. Don't hesitate to call me if you need anything and keep me posted. We're in the same boat you and I!" The mayor whipped out his card and gave it to Wilfried. "Thank you, sir."\n\nBefore he left, Godard stopped and took Wilfried's daughter picture in his claw. He took a look and put it back. "You've got a beautiful daughter, Wilfried. You should get back to her and the rest of your family. They deserve a present father."The chief answered by the most polite grunt he could muster. "Have a good night, mister mayor..." Finally, Godard left. Wilfried went and locked the door behind him. He made sure to close the blinders before anything else. He reached for his key and opened the large cabinet next to his desk, revealing a vast mind map of all the criminal networks they had knowledge of in Fezera. At the center of it all was the picture of Gwenaël Godard. Wilfried looked at it for a moment before simply pinning the mayor's card next to it."

 fezera.117.t:0 "Blood Money"
 fezera.117.d:0 "It was a beautiful morning in Fezera, yet few were in the mood to enjoy the weather. Today was Wilfried Pasvogel's funeral. Many veterans from the Fezeraanse Politie were in attendance. It may have been dangerous after they had been crushed so badly but they could at least risk it to honor their dead commander. After all, he was taking Fezera's future with him in the grave. His wife and children were inconsolable. The priest finished his prayer: "May he have safe passage to his last place of respite." That's when they came. A long procession of Familie griffs arrived, carrying large white flower arrangements. And among them, there he was, sharply dressed as always and seemingly without a care in the world. Nogriff dared to move. The mobsters were more numerous and many of them were coming out of the woods and grave rows, their trench coats obviously hiding guns. One young Politie officer tried to move but an older griff stopped him. There was no point in bravado. Willem Holveder was the mayor now after all.\n\nHolveder took the place of the priest.\n"Thank you. What a terrible day this is... I've known chief Wilfried Pasvogel for a long time. We've had our share of trouble, the two of us. For sure. But in the end, I'd like to think we respected each other, maybe we were even friends. I sure felt that way. He was of the kind of griffs that just isn't found anymore. I apologize for not meeting any of you sooner but we've had a lot on our claws after the death of my predecessors. That's why I'd like to take this occasion to tell you all, that Fezera will do right by all of you. We'll take care of those unpaid wages for all policegriffs and a special pension will be paid to all family members of officers who died in the line of duty. It's the Fezeraanse way. We take care of our own. Don't we?"\nHe smiled. The anger was palpable among the crowd. Pasvogel's daughter tried to step forward and call out the mobster, if only to spit on that smug face of his. But she didn't. Her mother stopped the fiery griff. Resolved, the widow stood up and looked at Holveder. "Thank you, mister Holveder.", she simply said.\n\nAnd that was it. Holveder nodded, excused himself and his goons put the flower arrangements all around the grave. All white flowers with the exception of a single purple morning-glory at the center. The signature of the Familie telling the witnesses and families to keep quiet or else."

 fezera.118.d:0 "Gwenaël Godard sighed as Luciaan was going on and on about the red tape that would be needed to normalize the situation after the Fezeraanse Politie was decapitated. Luciaan was a competent lawyer indeed but sometimes, he simply failed to comprehend the subtle nuances of a political coup.\n\n"Yes, yes. That is all well and perfect. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a very important lunch to get to." Luciaan froze and stood there for a second as Gwenaël grabbed his coat and began to leave. The griff seemed so miffed, something the mayor was not used to see in his lawyer. That was new. At last, it seemed the paper pusher had found another emotion than boredom. Still not interesting enough to keep the mayor in his office any longer. He got out.\n\nAs the mayor walked down the stairs of the city hall, Luciaan catched up to him and grabbed his arm, putting himself in front of him. He looked as angry and serious as he'd ever been.\n"Now, Gwenaël. We've known each other for years and I won't stand there while you get yourself into trouble. You have no idea of the kind of the legal conundrum you've put yourself into!"\n\nGwenaël still wasn't listening. Something had caught his attention. That black car. It seemed to belong to the Familie and had started its engine as soon as he had left. Then, a window slowly opened. Gwenaël reacted fast. He grabbed Luciaan back and fell in front of him. Before the poor lawyer could utter a word, the bullets were flying. Several hit Luciaan and one blew Gwenaël's hat away. Then it stopped and the car fled the scene. Gwenaël trembled but more from rage than from fear. He had dared. The lousy scum dared to try to kill him! Willem Holveder, the Familie, they were not content to stay on the sideline. They were in to play. Alright then! He would answer the challenge and teach them never to fail their opening move.\nLuciaan, apparently still alive, grabbed his collar and seemed to try to whisper his final words to the mayor. Godard simply shoved him aside and rose up, angrily pointing to his bodyguard who had finally showed up. "About bloody time, you useless pigeon! Take that corpse to the morgue and before you do, get me Peeters on the phone! This time, the damn bird gets it!""

 fezera.119.d:0 "The members of the city council all rushed into the meeting hall. Nogriff there knew what to do. The mayor had just been shot in a drive by right on their doorsteps and the militiagriffs who usually protected the Fezzerian city hall had disappeared. And there was no police to call anymore. Godard had made sure of that. Then, sharply dressed griffs entered the room. Gasps and screams were followed by horrified silence and the sounds of paws and claws on the ground as tommy gun wielding griffs entered the room. Some councilgriffs took cover, desperately hoping to protect their life. However, no shots were fired. One of the griffs took the oldest member by the arm and brought him to the tribune. He was given a piece of paper and was told to read it.\n\n"The... The council is now in... extraordinary session? Wait. That's not..." he was interrupted by the gun-wielding griff loudly dropping his gun on the desk. "Read it.", he said. The old councilgriff complied. "The council is now in extraordinary session. Please gain your seats. We shall now hear from mister Willem Holveder." The councilgriffs slowly obeyed, as confused as they were afraid. Then, Willem Holveder casually entered the room, well-dressed in his immaculate white suit, hat and trench coat. He approached the tribune.\n\n"Dear members of the city council... Nah. Countrygriffs! I'm here to report to you a terrible news. Our good mayor Gwenaël Godard has been murdered by the worst scum out there. My griffs are reporting that a Skyfall gang may very well be behind it and let me tell you. Now, you know me. I'm but a simple Fezzerian who, like any good griff, looks after his family. And right now, I feel we are all one big family, a Fezzerian family. We're all united in grief over the death of our poor dear Godard. But we have a duty to our brothers, sisters and children. We must attend to the safety of Fezera. I know the laws of our dear city, like any lawful citizen, and I know that in the case of untimely death in office of our mayor, the council is required to elect a new one. I know this is a poor time to campaign but I can promise you all a very simple thing: safety. Because at the end of the day... Aren't we all family?"\n\nNo griff dared answer. Then, a lone griff hit his desk with his claw, slowly building up into a slow clap. Then another. And slowly, the hall erupted in deafening applause, the councilgriffs madly beating their desks as if their lives depended on it. Willem simply smiled."

 fezera.120.t:0 "Small Breweries Emerge"
 fezera.120.d:0 "Fezera has long been known for its large breweries, supplying the Heartlands in cheap, mass-produced beer. While nogriff was particularly proud of the job they were doing, it brought in a lot of Idols to the city. The collapse of the Empire following the loss of the Idol of Boreas marked the end of that. While there still was a market for cheap alcohol in a continent ravaged by war and economic downturn, less and less griffs were interested in Fezzerian beverages. Aquileian and Wingbardian wines made a great comeback and the increasing commercial isolation of Fezera made it lose its favour for import. And so, the great industrial breweries shut down. Few tears were shed outside of the breweries' workers.\n\nIt could have been the end of Fezzerian beer making industry, but many of the laid off workers began to experiment with what they had learned. Hundreds of room-sized breweries were opened throughout Fezera and the countryside. New recipes were designed, with quality and flavour in mind rather than pure quantity. New tastes of beers were developed, inspired by old villages recipes like the lambiek. Many followed in their footsteps and what started as pet projects of unemployed workers simply trying to make some booze has turned into a mass movement. Even temples are joining the craze, trying to find new ways to gain income. More interestingly, many of these breweries are creating brands around their beers, identifying them by their place of origin, not unlike Aquileian wineries. Some merchants are even trying to export them!"

 fezera.121.t:0 "The Zottenzalen Craze"
 fezera.121.d:0 "Like every major city in Griffonia, Fezera was home to many theaters. Higher class Fezzerians could enjoy the finest productions and classics from all over the Empire and even some Equestrian plays. The collapse of the Empire made these theaters slowly wither away after that. Many troupes refused to come to such a destitute place or risk traveling away from the safer provinces of the Empire. The status of Fezera as a home of Aquileian republicanism brought in some artists but generally, the émigrés were in no mood for traditional theater, something which the general public in Fezera was still very much in favor of. As for the troupes and theaters in Skyfall, well... Maybe it's best to say nothing about them. And so, one by one, the theaters closed down.\n\nUntil now. Some owners of theaters decided to take a risk rather than simply wait to die as well. So, in the Fezzerian tradition, they searched for opportunities to bounce back. They discovered that while Griffonia remained a land of opera and theater, places like Equestria had heavily invested in the new art of cinema. The upfront cost for buying the equipment and the copies of foreign made movies was big, sure, but not as much as paying for the troupes, orchestras and props needed for producing proper theater.\n\nThe public loved it. The theaters often sold out, causing the theaters to organize several more screenings, something that would have been impossible. Sadly, the movies failed to attract the higher class of Fezera who regards it all as a fool's pleasure. And so, these new cinemas were nicknamed zottenzalen, literally "fools rooms"."

 fezera.122.d:0 "The Griffonian Fez Company has declared bankruptcy today. While it is a terrible news for their employees, it also marks the end of a great symbol for Fezera as a whole. The fez has been long been said to have been created in Fezera and as Griffonia entered the industrial age, it became a widespread and popular piece of Griffonian military and police dress.\n\nSadly, few were surprised as the market for fezzes was shrinking significantly for years now. The fez was strongly tied to the Imperial imagery and many new nations born out of the old Grover realm began to slowly discontinue its use to differentiate themselves from the old empire. The increasing use of helmets and caps also made it more and more obsolete. Worse, the few nations that did continue to use the fez favored local companies rather than importing them from Fezera, either out of national pride or to cut cost. In recent years, the GFC tried to transition to a more civilian fashion company. The fez unfortunately failed to break through as a fashionable headwear. The venture's failure marked the end of the company.\n\nDespite the bankruptcy, the Amicale of the Fezmakers declared that they would continue the Fezzerian fez-making tradition. We will see if these craftgriffs manage to cause a comeback of the fez."

After the Terror, he cultivated links with the Republicans who saw in him one of the hopes for a second revolution while at the same time, gaining significant influence within the army. His republican dealings, sincere or not, eventually leaked and the government prepared for an insurgency. The insurgency never materialized as Patissier got spooked and fled the country with his mistress. His popularity collapsed after that.

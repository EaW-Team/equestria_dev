 # Events
 vedina.1.t:0 "The Succession Crisis"
 vedina.1.d:0 "With the noble courts of Vedina growing restless, Wingstrom knows he must act soon to prevent a succession crisis. His young daughter Sköldsvärd must pass the traditional trials and prove her worth in three key areas.\n\nFirst, she must find a suitor and prove she can further her lineage. Next she must embark on a grand knightly quest and prove her valor and bravery. She must gather great deeds and victories to show to the nobility that she is ready to lead. Lastly, she must prove she can govern a state and improve Vedina as a whole.\n\nThe road will be long and arduous, but if she applies herself, Sköldsvärd can rise to become the greatest leader Vedina has ever seen."
 vedina.1.a:0 "We shall see."
 vedina.2.t:0 "Matters of Love"
 vedina.2.d:0 "Sköldsvärd realizes she has to marry a prince to gain respect in court. Having a consort, or at least a suitor, will help establish Sköldsvärd's position as heir and reassure the nobles that Vedina's line of succession will continue.\n\nAs such, Sköldsvärd agrees with her counselors to host a court session to allow suitors the ability to court her."
 vedina.2.a:0 "Here we go."
 vedina.3.t:0 "Sköldsvärd's First Day at Court"
 vedina.3.d:0 "During the first day at court, Sköldsvärd meets what seems like hundreds of suitors. They all seem to blur together into a mix of griffon faces. Three stand out, though.\n\nPrince Stridande, a proud aristocrat dressed in a striking military uniform. Prince Ondska, a dark-feathered griffon in a red cape. It's his almost... leering smirk that Sköldsvärd recalls the most.\n\nAnd of course, Prince Lycklig. Or... Princess Lycklig. The only griffoness to approach her.\n\nSköldsvärd suspects that these three will be the ones that will ask for her claw in matrimony."
 vedina.3.a:0 "Let's see if Sköldsvärd is right."
 vedina.4.t:0 "Prince Stridande Wishes To Court Sköldsvärd"
 vedina.4.d:0 "Dedicated to Princess Sköldsvärd, Stridande's letter is flowery, courteous and quite long. It is honestly a bit of a chore to read. On the other claw, towards the end of the letter, she notices that Stridande underlines a number of concerns about Vedina's military and some rather good ideas about how to improve it. It's a rather odd shift of tone for some griffon that seems to be a pure toff."
 vedina.4.a:0 "Maybe he has hidden depths?"
 vedina.5.t:0 "Prince Ondska Wishes To Court Sköldsvärd"
 vedina.5.d:0 "Ondska's letter compliments Sköldsvärd's beauty, intellect and strength, which is flattering, but rather straightforward. He also included a picture in his letter, which shows a dark-feathered griffon in a dashing blue-red jacket. He remarks that "together, we, the strong, can achieve anything". He also mentions though, that "those who oppose us, will simply have to fall in line" and that "change is coming to Vedina." "
 vedina.5.a:0 "What kind of change? And what does he mean by "fall in line?""
 vedina.6.t:0 "Princess Lycklig Wishes To Court Sköldsvärd"
 vedina.6.d:0 "Sköldsvärd finds Lycklig's letter the strangest to read, and not simply because it's a griffonness asking for her claw in courtship. On one claw, Lycklig seems to understand the weight on Sköldsvärd's shoulders, saying that if she becomes her consort, she'll do her best to "shoulder her responsibilities, and make you happy". But there's very little about why she would be the best consort, especially given that she is well, a she."
 vedina.6.a:0 "A bit of a mystery."
 vedina.7.t:0 "First Day at Court: A Summary"
 vedina.7.d:0 "Today, not one, but three princes (or well, two princes and a princess) have announced that they wish to court Sköldsvärd. Somehow she must now choose between the three of them. Luckily, as is the custom the princess must participate in some group event with her courtiers. She can get to know her suitors better during that time."
 vedina.7.a:0 "Who shall Sköldsvärd choose?"
 vedina.8.t:0 "The Hunt"
 vedina.8.d:0 "Sköldsvärd has chosen to participate in one of the most traditional practices of Vedinan nobility, a hunt! Of course, every one of her suitors has chosen to join the group made up of Vedina's nobles and their relatives. However, Sköldsvärd can only choose one suitor to accompany her personally, who shall she choose?"
 vedina.8.a:0 "Princess Lycklig."
 vedina.8.c:0 "Prince Ondska."
 vedina.8.b:0 "Prince Stridande."
 vedina.9.t:0 "Princess Lycklig Accompanies Sköldsvärd"
 vedina.9.d:0 "Lycklig is not a poor hunter, but she is disgusted by the sport. She expresses to Sköldsvärd that killing the poor animals who have done them no harm but by existing seems a poor waste of Vedina's natural resources and the talents of their best knights, especially given how most griffons in Vedina can't even afford meat."
 vedina.9.a:0 "She might have a point."
 vedina.10.t:0 "Prince Stridande Accompanies Sköldsvärd"
 vedina.10.d:0 "Stridande is a great hunter and gives good tips for Sköldsvärd about how to improve her hunting, but in whispers, so that she isn't embarrassed or condescended. Together, they bag two arctic foxes, all the while exchanging jokes."
 vedina.10.a:0 "A great time."
 vedina.11.t:0 "Prince Ondska Accompanies Sköldsvärd"
 vedina.11.d:0 "Ondska engages Sköldsvärd in a talk about the hunting that evolves into a discussion about the needs of the strong and of the weak. Ondska points that that given Vedina's limited resources and griffonpower, it only stands to reason that the most intelligent, the most strong, and the most physically able, should get the majority of the resources. During the hunt they spotted a winterchilla, which transformed into a huge winterzilla before their eyes as the sun set. Ondska shot and killed it, afterwards commenting how appearances can deceive and that even a small country such as Vedina has great power hidden within."
 vedina.11.a:0 "An interesting discussion."
 vedina.12.t:0 "After the Hunt"
 vedina.12.d:0 "After the hunt, the court sits down in a glen for a nice relaxing picnic. It's a beautiful day, though rather quiet. There are no birds. It's almost... too quiet.\n\nThe griffons hear some peculiar rustling sound coming from the bushes, followed by a growling noise."
 vedina.12.a:0 "IT'S A BUGBEAR!"
 vedina.13.t:0 "Lycklig Reacts to the Bugbear"
 vedina.13.d:0 "Lycklig screams in horror, but after a moment's hesitation, she readies her weapon, and ushers the younger members of the party away, shielding them from the flying insectoid bear as best she can. She's clearly inexperienced with her weapon though, and utterly terrified."
 vedina.13.a:0 "Sköldsvärd glances to Stridande..."
 vedina.14.t:0 "Stridande Reacts to the Bugbear"
 vedina.14.d:0 "Stridande leaps up to fight the bugbear telling everybody to get back and fires his gun. He's shaking from adrenaline, so he misses his shot, but charges forward regardless screaming "For Vedina!" He is smacked aside by the beast for his trouble, but he didn't even hesitate for a second."
 vedina.14.a:0 "Readying her own weapon, Sköldsvärd looks to Ondska..."
 vedina.15.t:0 "Ondska Reacts to the Bugbear"
 vedina.15.d:0 "Ondska is nowhere to be found when the bugbear attacks, at least at first. After seeing Lycklig usher the younger members of the party away, Sköldsvärd does notice Ondska dive on the bear from above, hacking at it with his claws, screeching, "The strong will devour the weak and become stronger in return!" The bugbear claws at him and he manages to dodge the strikes, before circling up to a higher altitude with his wings."
 vedina.15.a:0 "It's Sköldsvärd's turn."
 vedina.16.t:0 "Princess Sköldsvärd Fights the Bugbear"
 vedina.16.d:0 "Sköldsvärd fires her rifle, hitting the bugbear, but the beast is somehow still moving. She draws her sword and swoops at it. It bats at her, but she dodges it's strike, and slashes at it's lower leg. She manages a hit, but it's gaining on her. With a cry, Sköldsvärd buries her blade with a perfect thrust into it's throat, silencing the creature. The nobles erupt in cheers."
 vedina.16.a:0 "The hunt ends, and what a hunt it was."
 vedina.17.t:0 "The Ball"
 vedina.17.d:0 "It's the start of the Ball! A less traditional Vedinan activity, but it's a fun way to blow off steam and mingle. But which prince shall Sköldsvärd ask to be her partner at the ball?"
 vedina.17.a:0 "Princess Lycklig."
 vedina.17.b:0 "Prince Stridande."
 vedina.17.c:0 "Prince Ondska."
 vedina.18.t:0 "Princess Lycklig Dances with Sköldsvärd"
 vedina.18.d:0 "Sköldsvärd takes Lycklig's claws and finds herself floating through the air, guided by a griffon who clearly enjoys dancing and knows how to do it. As they whirl through the hall, Lycklig brings up the subject of the commonfolk of Vedina and their mutters about how if only they could share in this wealth and entertainment. Sköldsvärd listens to Lycklig's ideas about how to bring Vedina out of poverty, many of which are quite well-supported. All the while, they twirl through the air in their own bubble. It's a informative, but intimate moment in time."
 vedina.18.a:0 "A great first dance, certainly."
 vedina.19.t:0 "Prince Stridande Dances with Sköldsvärd"
 vedina.19.d:0 "Surprisingly enough, Stridande is a very bad dancer. He nearly slams Sköldsvärd into the pillars of the dance hall several times. He does apologize profusely, listens to Sköldsvärd's instructions carefully and keeps trying his best. By the end of the dance, he's... less crash-prone, but by no means a good dancer."
 vedina.19.a:0 "At least he tried..."
 vedina.20.t:0 "Prince Ondska Dances with Sköldsvärd"
 vedina.20.d:0 "The prince is striking in his black jacket and decorative pointed steel helmet. His dancing leaves a bit to be desired as he's a bit stiff and prefers to take the lead, but he is competent. As they waltz through the air, he asks if Sköldsvärd has heard of the old myths about the dark magicians. She responds that she has, and when she does, his eyes light up. He muses on how they brought their wielders such power and strength that all feared them, and asks Sköldsvärd if it would be nice for Vedina to be feared for a change, instead of being trampled down by the Griffonian Empire. "After all," he points out, "the Empire is experiencing a period of resurgence. We can industrialize and reform all we want, but can we do so fast enough?" When Sköldsvärd doesn't respond, he says in an off-clawed manner, that he doesn't mean to say that Vedina should immediately embrace... more questionable magic, but that considering how Equestria has magic, the Griffonian Empire has population and industry, they should definitely look at... different ways to apply magic so that they can survive. In this, he seems quite sincere in his belief."
 vedina.20.a:0 "Was he really here to dance...?"
 vedina.21.t:0 "After the First Dance"
 vedina.21.d:0 "The first dance is finished! Now, time to relax, mingle with all the suitors and enjoy snacks served in the grand halls of the palace."
 vedina.21.a:0 "Onward!"
 vedina.22.t:0 "Sköldsvärd's Conversation With Ondska"
 vedina.22.d:0 "Ondska takes Sköldsvärd aside to have a quiet conversation. Sköldsvärd listens to him talk about the dangers of Vedina being so weak in the face of the power of the Griffonian Empire. He has a point, but there's an odd light that flickers in his eyes as he goes on and on about how it might makes right, and the weak's destiny is to be subsumed by the strong."
 vedina.22.a:0 "Okay..."
 vedina.23.t:0 "Sköldsvärd's Drink With Stridande"
 vedina.23.d:0 "Stridande pulls Sköldsvärd over after her first dance, treating her to a drink. He compliments her on her beauty, and grace, but oddly enough, he also makes a few biting jokes at the expense of some of the attendees. Like how "Countess Räkmacka sends her children to private school, yet she is trying to pay her way to be appointed Minister of Education!" He's clearly got strong opinions about the state of Vedinan nobility."
 vedina.23.a:0 "Hmm..."
 vedina.24.t:0 "Lycklig Dances With Sköldsvärd"
 vedina.24.d:0 "Lycklig asks Sköldsvärd for her second dance, and she accepts. They whirl through the ballroom, finding themselves perfectly in sync as they speed up. Lycklig is thoroughly and sincerely reveling the dance and doing her best to try to make sure Sköldsvärd enjoys the dance as well. She frequently and rightfully compliments Sköldsvärd on how much work she has put into appearing the perfect princess."
 vedina.24.a:0 "That was nice, wasn't it?"
 vedina.25.t:0 "A Successful Ball"
 vedina.25.d:0 "It's been a nice night, with dancing, revelry and, above all, interesting company. There will be opportunities to get to know the other suitors later, but for now, everyone is heading home to sleep."
 vedina.25.a:0 "What next?"
 vedina.26.t:0 "The Feast"
 vedina.26.d:0 "Feasting is a Vedinan tradition about as old as hunting, and thus, an excellent time to enjoy good food, some performers doing acrobatics and singing in the background, and good company. Who shall Sköldsvärd seat next to her?"
 vedina.26.a:0 "Princess Lycklig."
 vedina.26.b:0 "Prince Stridande."
 vedina.26.c:0 "Prince Ondska."
 vedina.27.t:0 "Princess Lycklig Sits with Sköldsvärd"
 vedina.27.d:0 "Instead of making Lycklig eager to eat, the opulence of the feast seems to annoy the princess. She eats the food almost... guiltily, as if she doesn't to eat it. Sköldsvärd presses Lycklig as to why, which is when Lycklig spits out that a poor Vedinan family can't even afford the plate that this food is being served on. She tells Sköldsvärd that she appreciates her hospitality, but for the sake of the Vedinan griffons, she will only eat until she is full, and will not gorge herself."
 vedina.27.a:0 "At least she's not wasting food."
 vedina.28.t:0 "Prince Stridande Sits with Sköldsvärd"
 vedina.28.d:0 "Stridande grumbles about how the food isn't as good as the rations in the Griffonian Empire. He wonders openly if some noble lord or lady's swindled the best ingredients from the Royal Kitchen and replaced them with second-rate ingredients. He asks Sköldsvärd if the Vedinan noble families will ever fulfill the roles they were sworn to."
 vedina.28.a:0 "Huh..."
 vedina.29.t:0 "Prince Ondska Sits with Sköldsvärd"
 vedina.29.d:0 "Ondska is very happy to sit next to Sköldsvärd. He muses that the view from the table head must look rather interesting. But he also points to Sköldsvärd that a number of her nobles are very much playing their own game, and clearly wary of her.\n\n"Wouldn't it be nice to have all of them love you? To have it so that they only desire to serve you?" He explains that if Vedina is to be protected from aggression and to come to her own on the world stage, they need to be united as a military state, where all must serve for the country's benefit. They would all be guided by one strong ruler.\n\nWhen Sköldsvärd asks about the consequences of such militarization and centralization Ondska shrugs.\n\n"The strong devour the weak in this world, Princess, and I know you have the ability to do what's necessary.""
 vedina.29.a:0 "Hmm..."
 vedina.30.t:0 "After the Feasting"
 vedina.30.d:0 "Now that she's full, it's time for Sköldsvärd to mingle with the suitors. There's some entertainment in the form of a band of musicians and some accompanying performers."
 vedina.30.a:0 "How's Stridande doing?"
 vedina.31.t:0 "Prince Stridande Comments on the Feast"
 vedina.31.d:0 "Stridande comments that the entertainment is alright, but that the performers don't seem to be doing it happily. He suspects that they aren't being paid in full and laments to Sköldsvärd that the nobility no longer sponsors the arts, and rather tries to cheat artists out of their hard-earned cash with fine print."
 vedina.31.a:0 "So how is Prince Ondska doing?"
 vedina.32.t:0 "Prince Ondska Makes Some Comments"
 vedina.32.d:0 "Ondska is looking at a stained glass window dedicated to the Wise Lady, and showing the first king, Förena, being given guidance. He mutters that if she was so wise, why didn't she push the king to expand eastward.\n\nSeeing Sköldsvärd, he smiles and points out that it's rather impressive that the Wise Lady is worshipped even today and that her influence is so widespread.\n\nHe seems disapproving of the Wise Lady, though, and when Sköldsvärd inquires, he grimaces and says the fact she only provided guidance has led to Vedina being in this position. If she was an active god who would lead, and exerted her power and wisdom to rule Vedina, then they wouldn't have been subjugated by the Griffonian Empire."
 vedina.32.a:0 "Okay, how is Princess Lycklig doing?"
 vedina.33.t:0 "Princess Lycklig Comments on Wine"
 vedina.33.d:0 "Sköldsvärd walks by Lycklig, noticing that she doesn't seem to like the drink and mutters something about how most griffons taste alcohol but once in their life. It's an odd comment given that she does finish her drink and greets Sköldsvärd with a winning smile, complimenting her on her dress. Sköldsvärd asks Lycklig if what she says is true. Surprised, Lycklig says yes, explaining how the nobles hold a stranglehold on wine."
 vedina.33.a:0 "Hmm."
 vedina.34.t:0 "Feast Over"
 vedina.34.d:0 "All in all, a successful feast. There will be time to mingle further with the suitors, but at least Sköldsvärd has a sense of who the suitors are."
 vedina.34.a:0 "Now, what next?"
 vedina.35.t:0 "A Night Out"
 vedina.35.d:0 "Sköldsvärd decides to have a night out with one of her suitors. But whom to choose?"
 vedina.35.a:0 "Prince Ondska."
 vedina.35.b:0 "Prince Stridande."
 vedina.35.c:0 "Princess Lycklig."
 vedina.36.t:0 "Sköldsvärd and Prince Ondska's Night Out"
 vedina.36.d:0 "The place Ondska takes Sköldsvärd is a quiet temple to the Wise Lady, far from the city. It's a marvel of old Vedinan architecture and it's got this tranquil atmosphere to it.\n\nAt least at first glance, as Sköldsvärd and Ondska enter deeper in, the mood changes. Something's off about this temple. The end of it has the typical statue of the Wise Lady, but that seems diminished and compared to the statues of the massive griffons that flank her.\n\nOndska, who had been talking going on about how the precursors to the First Lady had magical abilities despite the fact they were griffons, falls silent. He tells of Sköldsvärd that if she's noticed something odd about this temple, then she has good senses, because the temple isn't one to the Wise Lady.\n\nOndska taps the wall too the left of the statue of the Wise Lady and pushes a block of stone, along with the wall. It rotates with a groan. Ondska walks, grinning widely and Sköldsvärd follows him, slowly. The circular chamber beyond is some kind of old ritual chamber with stains and carvings on the floor. As Sköldsvärd narrows her eyes, she realizes they are strange runes, which she vaguely remembers seeing in some old tome about ancient runic magic.\n\nOndska explains that this was where the ancients who predated the Wise Lady used to summon and create contracts with creatures from beyond, which allowed them to wield powers despite their griffon heritage. Sköldsvärd asks for clarification and Ondska says that the creatures tend to be misunderstood as purely evil demons. "They're more demanding than evil. They follow their contracts to the letter, which foolish summoners tend to forget, and wise summoners always remember." He points out though that the powers bestowed upon by the creatures could allow their masters to perform feats only dreamt of. The pictures and murals on the walls of the chambers seem to attest to this, as they show griffons leading armies into battle, and casting spells that devastate their pony or griffon enemies."
 vedina.36.a:0 "Summoners and sorcerers... Who would have known?"
 vedina.37.t:0 "Sköldsvärd and Prince Stridande's Night Out"
 vedina.37.d:0 "Stridande asks Sköldsvärd to wear a disguise, and takes her into Turhamn. There they have a great time dancing in the "Brass Galleon" bar and there's a lot of interesting company. Many of the bar's customers are Vedina-born young military officers, who grumble at how the nobility keeps cutting their budget and how tradition rather than innovation seems to be the call of the day. They're also excellent comedians who take care to make the disguised Stridande and Sköldsvärd comfortable and included."
 vedina.37.a:0 "Well, that was fun?"
 vedina.38.t:0 "Princess Lycklig and Sköldsvärd have a Night Out"
 vedina.38.d:0 "Lycklig takes Sköldsvärd - who goes in disguise - to a salon club with a group of other griffonesses. Most from Vedina, but a few from Nova Griffonia and some hailing from as far as the Evi Valley. They engage in a concerted discussion about the wealth gap between the poor and rich and how it ends up hurting both. Some of them have quite outlandish ideas, but Lycklig, who is presenting, puts forward a rather conservative plan that supports gradual development, with the adjustment of Vedinan traditions to accommodate a modern world. After the salon is finished, Lycklig invites Sköldsvärd to ask questions about her plan, which Sköldsvärd does, and they continue to discuss Vedina's economy into the night.\n\nSköldsvärd does have one big question though, how will Lycklig provide her with an heir? Lycklig counters with, "provide you with an heir, why, can it not be the other way around?"\n\nLycklig then laughs and explains that there are plenty of children who lack parents of their own, and who'd make excellent successors given proper love and care. Blood isn't the only way griffons can be connected, after all."
 vedina.38.a:0 "Oh..."
 vedina.39.t:0 "A Walk in the Garden"
 vedina.39.d:0 "Sköldsvärd decides to go for a quiet walk in the Royal Garden in Turhamn with one of her suitors. But whom to choose?"
 vedina.39.a:0 "Prince Ondska."
 vedina.39.b:0 "Prince Stridande."
 vedina.39.c:0 "Princess Lycklig."
 vedina.40.t:0 "Sköldsvärd and Ondska's Walk"
 vedina.40.d:0 "Ondska seems almost disdainful of the flowers of the gardens. Most of the time he keeps talking about how Vedina must abandon the idea of trying to provide for every griffon, and focus on providing as much resources as possible for those actually able to make a difference. Occasionally, he points to the odd spider or predatory insect that he and Sköldsvärd run into and uses them as an example the possibility of what might happen to Vedina; it's fall or it's rise."
 vedina.40.a:0 "A good walk?"
 vedina.41.t:0 "Sköldsvärd and Stridande's Walk"
 vedina.41.d:0 "During their walk in the Stridande confides in Sköldsvärd about his worry about the nobility of Vedina and how they've forgotten their duty. Stridande and Sköldsvärd also talk about their favorite legends and old heroes from Vedina's past. They both admire King Förena, but find that they have a common adoration of "The Wise Lady" in Vedina's history."
 vedina.41.a:0 "Good enough."
 vedina.42.t:0 "Sköldsvärd and Lycklig's Walk"
 vedina.42.d:0 "Lycklig finds the gardens peaceful, and says as much to Sköldsvärd, but she seems to be rather saddened by them. Sköldsvärd wonders why and presses Lycklig, until she asks "Why does such beauty has to be only for the rich? Can we not have parks, and public gardens, where children, and the elderly of all classes can play together? Can share ideas and remember that they are all from Vedina?"\n\nSköldsvärd questions Lycklig why she is so concerned and asking this question. Lycklig is silent.\n\n"Because I am an illegitimate child."\n\nHer father had no other heirs though, and so was forced to legitimize her. She thus wants change because she can really feel for the common griffon as she has seen and experienced a poor childhood herself, and isn't going to let her good fortune go to waste. She tells Sköldsvärd that, "If you choose me, I will make sure no Vedinan child grows up hungry, and glaring with hate at the nobility who tax them. I will bring Vedina into the modern world as your right claw.""
 vedina.42.a:0 "That was intense!"
 vedina.43.t:0 "The Dinner"
 vedina.43.d:0 "A private dinner in the Royal Castle is a great way for Sköldsvärd to spend time with one of her suitors. But who shall Sköldsvärd pick?"
 vedina.43.a:0 "Prince Ondska."
 vedina.43.b:0 "Prince Stridande."
 vedina.43.c:0 "Princess Lycklig."
 vedina.44.t:0 "Sköldsvärd and Ondska Have Dinner"
 vedina.44.d:0 "The Prince is pulling a full charm offensive, of sorts. Ondska is certainly attempting to be suave.\n\nHowever, his flirting compliments tend to be along the lines of, "You know, things would run so much smoother if you were the only power in Vedina." Or, "The Kingdom should trust griffons like you more, rather than the law." And "What do the peasants know of how to rule? Only you, and I of course, know anything of ruling.""
 vedina.44.a:0 "At least he's trying?"
 vedina.45.t:0 "Sköldsvärd and Stridande Have Dinner"
 vedina.45.d:0 "Stridande is an excellent conversationalist, regaling Sköldsvärd about his stories in the Griffonian Empire and during training. Toward the end of the dinner, Sköldsvärd and Stridande also get into a discussion about how to apply Vedina's traditions in a modern world, and its role in a modern world. In the end, Stridande states that he thinks that chivalry still has a place, and mentions that no matter who Sköldsvärd chooses, he'll always be loyal to Vedina, as is his role."
 vedina.45.a:0 "Huh, that seems very good of him?"
 vedina.46.t:0 "Sköldsvärd and Lycklig Have Dinner"
 vedina.46.d:0 "Lycklig makes the dinner herself and is a surprisingly good cook. It's a very romantic atmosphere and Lycklig is very willing to listen to Sköldsvärd complain about the outdated and weird tradition of dangerous trials for heirs, whilst also cracking a few jokes at her own expense, and at the expense of some of the more stuffy Vedinan nobility. It's a relaxing evening and Lycklig finishes it by serving dessert and dancing with Sköldsvärd to the music of the gramophone."
 vedina.46.a:0 "A most wonderful evening."
 vedina.47.t:0 "The Love Letters"
 vedina.47.d:0 "Having spent some time with all of her suitors, Sköldsvärd is coming close to the point to where she can make a decision. But before she does, three love letters from the three suitors arrive for her."
 vedina.47.a:0 "Time to open them."
 vedina.48.t:0 "Princess Lycklig's Letter"
 vedina.48.d:0 "Lycklig makes the argument that they seem to get along, that unlike the other suitors, they can relate to each other thanks to their gender and that Sköldsvärd needs help to bring Vedina into the future, not back into the past. Having an heir will not be a challenge, given the choice of adoption. \n\nThe crux of her letter is towards its end, where she concedes that she might not have gotten Sköldsvärd to love her yet. She writes though that regardless, she will be the queen-consort that will help Sköldsvärd lead Vedina to not to militarization, not to whatever insanity that Ondska might be planning, but to the uncertain future, or the "undiscovered country" as Lycklig calls it."
 vedina.48.a:0 "Okay. What did Prince Stridande write?"
 vedina.49.t:0 "Prince Stridande's Letter"
 vedina.49.d:0 "In the love letter, Stridande plays down his status and emphasizes not his wealth, but his chivalry, stating that no matter who Sköldsvärd chooses, he'll respect her choice. What he does want is to serve and he thinks he can best serve as her consort, to help remind the nobility of their old roles, and to help her make Vedina the bastion of chivalry that they used to be."
 vedina.49.a:0 "Okay. What did Prince Ondska write?"
 vedina.50.t:0 "Prince Ondska's Letter"
 vedina.50.d:0 "Ondska says that he's not just a good choice, he is the only choice if Sköldsvärd is to rule supreme over Vedina, crushing her enemies underneath her claws and vanquishing dissent. He claims that if she chooses him, he would help her lead Vedina to become the strongest power on the continent."
 vedina.50.a:0 "Hmm."
 vedina.52.t:0 "Assessing the Situation"
 vedina.52.d:0 "Vedina has problems both within and without, as [Root.GetLeader] well knows by now. The economy is behind the times, the military is not quite up to the standards of more modernized nations, and more than these things Vedina's position in the political stage is uncertain. With the Emperor's death, we can breathe more freely. But we cannot yet stand alone.\n\nThe main allies we could seek to maintain our relative independence are Aquileia to the south, and our neighbors in the Griffonian Republic. Both are stalwart in their resistance to any Imperial resurgence, and both could potentially stand firm against Imperial renewal. Aquileia and its Entente would better suit our harmonic ideals, but the Griffonian Republic would be easier to coordinate our defences. We must choose, quickly but not without wisdom."
 vedina.52.a:0 "Who to befriend?"
 vedina.53.t:0 "Courting the Entente"
 vedina.53.d:0 "Sköldsvärd approaches the Republic through intermediaries, looking for them to make good on the proposed Entente. There is some mild tension between us. The Republicans are suspicious of any monarch, and we are a bit dismayed by the more radical in their ranks. But we are united by our harmonic ideals, and by our distrust of the expansionist Empire.\n\nPreliminary negotiations set a time and a place for a royal visit, but it is up to [Root.GetLeader] to seal the deal. We cannot offer tanks or planes, but we can offer knights of superb quality and skill. The monarch sits across a table from an elected leader, their aides on either side, and Sköldsvärd decides to let some of her guard down. If she is to overcome their distrust of her status, she must show the Republicans that she is a griffon same as they are despite her estate, and that they are closer than it would appear. She talks freely, letting herself gush about the beautiful sights of the capitol, and of her hope for friendship between two nations. But will it win them over?"
 vedina.53.a:0 "Cross your talons..."
 vedina.54.t:0 "A Proposal"
 vedina.54.d:0 "[JER.GetLeader], President of the Republic, is cordial despite his people's misgivings. After the preliminary meeting, he takes his leave and invites Sköldsvärd and her retinue to a reception. She accepts happily, expressing her excitement to finally try a taste of the famed Aquileian cuisine.\n\nAt the reception full of diplomats, generals, and rich financiers of the democratic cause, Sköldsvärd is absolutely radiant. She carefully chose an outfit more suited for the republican tastes, beautiful but not obscenely ornate. The ladies talk in glowing terms, and every bachelor in the room follows her with his eyes. Her every word is listened to with rapt attention and her every action watched.\n\nThe next few days brings another battery of meetings. Vedina's harmonist sentiment is not in question, but its monarchy is still hard to swallow. [JER.GetLeader] asks if he may send a delegation to see what Vedina is like for himself, and the monarch readily agrees. Talk turns to what Vedina can offer the Entente in terms of griffonpower and material. Afterwards, Sköldsvärd returns to her chambers feeling glum. Has she done enough? [JER.GetLeader] hasn't cracked a smile since she arrived..."
 vedina.54.a:0 "The answer comes soon..."
 vedina.55.t:0 "Vedina Joins the Entente"
 vedina.55.d:0 "The next day, Sköldsvärd returns to the conference room to meet a smiling but bleary-eyed President. "Congratulations," he says, extending a claw. "For better or worse, I am here to offer our decision."\n\nThe baffled monarch looks down at it. "What do you mean, my good griffon?" she asks.\n\n"While you were sleeping, Highness, my cabinet spent the whole night in debate. I will be honest with you and say that Vedina is not a partner that we looked for, but perhaps it is one that we needed. The finer points of our cooperation need to be ironed out, but the Entente and the Republic welcomes you into our fold."\n\nAn elated Sköldsvärd takes his claw and shakes it happily, startling the more formal among her retinue. She may be royal, but she is after everything still a griffon, and a young one at that. All of her hard work, her worries, and the future of her nature hanging over her, and for the first time in ages she feels like she can breathe."
 vedina.55.a:0 "A good day for Vedina and harmony!"
 vedina.56.t:0 "Vedina is Judged Unworthy"
 vedina.56.d:0 "President [JER.GetLeader] had been distant for her whole visit, but today he just seemed grim. Sköldsvärd sat down as she had several times, and noticed that he did not speak at all right away.\n\n"I have unfortunate news," he said suddenly, startling her. "Your Highness, I confess that I had hoped that the Republic could aid you. I am sworn enemy of royalty, but griffon to griffon, I like you. But the Republic cannot afford to tie itself to a backwards nation, especially one under a royal yoke. The Empire's threat is too great, and the world is too dangerous for such sentimentality. I am sorry. The cabinet and the people's assemblies have spoken, and with a heavy heart, I must ask you to and your retinue to leave." He rose stiffly, and bowed before leaving a stunned royal behind him."
 vedina.56.a:0 "We leave with heavy hearts."
 vedina.57.t:0 "The Griffon Alliance"
 vedina.57.d:0 "Rather than chance our luck with the Aquileians, whose hatred of monarchs is still fresh, let us approach the remnants of the first Republic, the one that rose in Griffenheim. If anyone will be a stalwart ally in the fight against the Empire, it would be those whose hatred of our former masters has forged them into a nation. Their alliance is less sure, as these Republicans have fewer potential friends and are far less stable.\n\nHowever, the Republican griffons are close by, and coordinating our military efforts should be a bit easier. Unlike Aquileia, the northern republic has more immediate need of friends, and cannot afford to be as picky."
 vedina.57.a:0 "Let us go with open minds."
 vedina.58.t:0 "Courting the Republic"
 vedina.58.d:0 "[Root.GetLeader] arrived in Cloudbury today to much pomp and circumstance. But to be truthful, her visit has already proved a bit disappointing. Cloudbury is a fine city, but its people do not look hopeful or enthusiastic about anything, let alone such an important alliance. The Republicans have a lot of problems, and it shows. Outside of Cloudbury, the griffons of the country do not necessarily like or trust the government of the city. The army is a unruly at best, and mutinous at worst. Her reports emphasized the precarious nature of the Republic, even as [FAT.GetLeader] works tirelessly.\n\nBut Sköldsvärd still hopes. [FAT.GetLeader] is a shrewd griffon, and she's sure that he will see the advantages of having Vedina's corps of knights backing up his army."
 vedina.58.a:0 "We await their final decision."
 vedina.59.t:0 "Vedina Joins the Alliance"
 vedina.59.d:0 "[FAT.GetLeader] and Sköldsvärd converse long into the night, and even more the next day. He is a pragmatic griffon, and she finds him charming in a gruff sort of way. He's a veteran of both war and political disaster, and while he has sympathy for her harmonist outlook, he refuses to be tied down to it.\n\nEventually, they reach an accord. Vedina and the republicans will stand together against the Empire. It's high time that these warmongering conquerors meet their end!"
 vedina.59.a:0 "Brothers in arms!"
 vedina.60.t:0 "Vedina Shown the Door"
 vedina.60.d:0 "[FAT.GetLeader] is a hard griffon. He's seen too many dewy-eyed idealists die, and had to order the deaths of at least some of them. His life has become a quest to restore the republic, and he will stop at nothing. He is cordial to Vedina's lady, but as talks go on he seems more and more unimpressed with our military capability. Our lack of modern technology, our reliance on knights, and the state of our economy at last prompt him to quip that we've asked him to tie himself to a country with all of the problems he has, but worse.\n\nEventually, Sköldsvärd must concede defeat. The Republic is too embittered, too fragile, too desperate, and too stubborn to see the error of their ways. [FAT.GetLeader] and his government cannot be reasoned with. We can only hope that they aren't destroyed by the Empire."
 vedina.60.a:0 "Frustrating."
 vedina.61.t:0 "Looking Across the Sea"
 vedina.61.d:0 "It was the Empire who colonized Nova Griffonia, not Vedina. But we have maintained cordial relationships, if not close ones, with our cousins across the sea. Our ways are very different, but perhaps some common ground can be found between us. We both live in troubled times, and we are both vulnerable to the machinations of other more powerful and more modernized nations.\n\nA royal visit is out of the question, as the colony is far too wild for that. But a noble diplomatic mission has been dispatched looking for an accord between us. The gulf between us does limit how useful we can be to each other, that is true, but our knights would be welcome on the frontier, and their brave militagriffs would be a boon for us here on the frontlines of the next war on Griffonia."
 vedina.61.a:0 "Will they help us?"
 vedina.62.t:0 "The Colonists Agree!"
 vedina.62.d:0 "Good news from Equus! Word comes from our mission to Weter that the colonists have heard the cry of their cousins in Griffonia, and have decided to side with us. What exactly that looks like is yet to be determined, but unless talking out the specifics completely breaks down, we have a sure friend in Nova Griffonia. In such troubled times, any friend is a good friend."
 vedina.62.a:0 "Brothers in arms!"
 vedina.63.t:0 "Nova Griffonian Refusal"
 vedina.63.d:0 "Our dignitaries have come home with hats in claws and ill news. Nova Griffonia simply does not have what we seek. Not only that, but those rubes turned our party away after only a few days! Apparently they have "bigger problems" on Equus, which is frankly ridiculous. Changelings or yaks or whatever else, are they not griffons? Nova Griffonia was a mistake, really, creating griffons with no idea about real griffon problems and concerns! By the gods, they're hardly even griffons anymore!"
 vedina.63.a:0 "That is ill news indeed."
 vedina.64.t:0 "An Unfortunate Truth"
 vedina.64.d:0 "There are very few griffons in Vedina who want to return to our old place in the shadow of the Empire. Whilst in our protectorate the Empire rarely truly oppressed us, it also kept us feeble and nonthreatening. Our culture was being erased slowly, yes. Our country itself was being eaten away. But it does not need to be that way.\n\nThe emperor is dead, and with him dies the old ways and the old ideas. Vedina has an opportunity now to redefine its relationship to Griffenheim. A Vedina that comes back to the Empire of its own accord can return not as a puppet but as a valued friend and junior partner. With some luck and shrewdness, we can survive. There's nowhere else to turn, in the end. Only the Empire endures."
 vedina.64.a:0 "Perhaps it is for the best."
 vedina.65.t:0 "Crawling Back to the Empire"
 vedina.65.d:0 "Vedina has sent a somber delegation to the Imperial capitol to negotiate our return. The Imperial officials were surprised, to say the least, that we didn't cut and run. We are not sure what they will make of poor Vedina. We are far from the seat of power, and surrounded by nations which are not friendly to the old order. We ourselves have at times been unfriendly to it, and they will not forget this. We can offer them our knights, though they are poorly equipped in this day and age. Our economy, our weak industry, our remoteness... These things all count against us. Loyalty and knights were enough to buy imperial protection a few hundred years ago. We hope it will be enough to buy it now."
 vedina.65.a:0 "We await their decision."
 vedina.66.t:0 "Better Safe Then Brave"
 vedina.66.d:0 "Vedina has always prized itself on honour. We have talked chivalry and courage into the ground, and take great pride in our traditions. But wisdom is also a virtue, and part of being a good knight is making the most of your strengths for a good cause. Few love the Empire, but they can see the wisdom in picking the devil you know. It might not be the bravest, but it is probably the safest course of action to hitch our star to the rising star of the Regent. Especially now that we have assurances that the Imperials will keep their claws off our culture and our society, perhaps we can help push them towards a better and more honorable course. Who knows? At best Vedina can help stabilize the continent. At worse, we'll be safe from our neighbors and a rapidly changing world. Long live the Empire! For better or worse."
 vedina.66.a:0 "Vedina is loyal again."
 vedina.67.t:0 "The Imperial Refusal"
 vedina.67.d:0 "There are moments that leave entire countries temporarily paralyzed, and this is one of them. Nobles in Turhamn sit in stunned silence, struggling to understand how everything could have fallen apart. The merchants have closed their shops. The peasants, even, have begun to worry about what the future holds.\n\nThe Imperial response to our petition is an open letter posted through Vedina which advises our benighted land to "look to your own defenses" and wishes us luck, but also officially cuts all ties between us. Not only will they spare no resources to preserve their protectorate, but in fact if they win out from the host of dangers assailing them then we may one day have an imperial army at our door. Times are bleak, and if even the Empire won't take us back, can we find friends elsewhere?"
 vedina.67.a:0 "We're doomed..."
 vedina.68.t:0 "Vedina Stands Alone"
 vedina.68.d:0 "We cannot trust the republicans, with their strange new ideas. We cannot go back to the Empire, for many reasons. The colonists cannot be trusted to be useful. The ponies certainly won't be our friends. We are alone and beset on all sides by, if not foes, then potential foes. Everygriff sharpens their talons and swords, and young peasants practice with bayonet and pistol knowing that all too soon they will need them. Who can say what shall come? But whatever it is, Vedina and its griffons will not fare well without the Lady's blessing and a heap of luck."
 vedina.68.a:0 "Look to our own defenses."
 vedina.69.t:0 "Rogue's Gallery of Friends"
 vedina.69.d:0 "Now that we've let go of our more naive ideals, it's time to look abroad and assess the situation. As much as we'd all like to deny it, Vedina is not as strong as it could be in this new world. We lag behind in technology, if not in valor, and our economy is still outdated and inefficient.\n\nThere are a few likeminded nations who share our ideology of strength whom we may align ourselves with for the time being. We could seek an arrangement with the Archons, who while not quite what we have in mind are fellow travelers. While not quite what we have in mind, the Archon is something of a fellow traveler. The griffons across the sea might also be worth investigating, if we can find sympathizers who share our view of the strong and the weak.\n\nOr, if we must, we could go it alone. With time, we could perhaps form a coalition of nations based around ourselves?"
 vedina.69.a:0 "Partner with the Empire!"
 vedina.69.b:0 "The Colonists it is."
 vedina.69.c:0 "We'll start our own alliance!"
 vedina.70.t:0 "Proposing an Alliance"
 vedina.70.d:0 "Now that we've figured out who exactly we need as our friend and ally in troubled times, next comes properly impressing them. It has been decided that the royals will go, of course, but accompanied with the most advanced military honor guard we can muster. No expense shall be spared. It is unnecessarily showy, yes, but it will get the job done.\n\nWe can only hope that our investment will pay off. Vedina needs allies, and it needs them soon. The republicans could gather their strength any day now, and until we have friends opportunists all down the coast count us as a soft target. Let us hope we make a good impression. The first step to being truly strong is surviving long enough to better yourself."
 vedina.70.a:0 "What will their answer be?"
 vedina.71.t:0 "They Agree!"
 vedina.71.d:0 "Joyous news from abroad! Our now partners have agreed to our proposed alliance. While perhaps these are not the best terms --they have been somewhat dodgy on the question of just how much support they are willing to provide in the case of war-- the minimum guarentees have satisfied our rulers. Vedina shall have its alliance, and with friends comes the security to modernize fully."
 vedina.71.a:0 "Brothers in arms!"
 vedina.72.t:0 "Vedina is Rebuffed!"
 vedina.72.d:0 "Another bleak day in what seems like a bleak time. Our embassy has been sent packing. The royals and their honor guard were not as impressive as we'd hoped, and now we have lost the opportunity to form a potentially valuable alliance.\n\nThe mood back home is sour. The nobles and knightly ranks talk as they always have, and a few have put forth the idea that perhaps our lovely rulers are not quite cut out for the job of representing the Kingdom abroad. Most of the elites are still loyal, of course, but it is telling that after an initial acceptance of the new order, there are cracks beginning to show. The former princess and her consort are not as loved as they would perhaps have liked... for now. But that will change. This is only a setback."
 vedina.72.a:0 "We'll show them..."
 vedina.73.t:0 "An Invitation From [From.Capital.GetName]"
 vedina.73.d:0 "A note with the royal seal arrives in our chosen ally's capitol intended for the eyes of only their highest officials. It contains wild promises, and honestly comes across as a bit... keen. But there's certainly a degree of charismatic charm as well. Vedina does not invite just about anyone to its league, after all. There is some honor in that selectivity!\n\nOnly one question. Will they accept, and join our League?"
 vedina.73.a:0 "Yes!"
 vedina.73.b:0 "The League of What now?"
 vedina.74.t:0 "Another Joins the League!"
 vedina.74.d:0 "Success! After some deliberation, we have gained a valued friend. The exchanging of gifts, advisors, and officials is already being negotiated, and soon comes joint military planning.\n\nThis is, of course, not the end. The league must grow, and Vedina's ambitions do not end at just acquiring a friend or two. No, we dream far bigger. This is but the first step, and these fools are just a stepping stone on the Kingdom's road to eventual empire."
 vedina.74.a:0 "Glory to Vedina!"
 vedina.75.t:0 "Made a Mockery"
 vedina.75.d:0 "These disgusting fools that we offered our friendship to have thrown the invitation away. Clearly we overestimated them.\n\nWhile no one says anything at court, there are whispers being traded noble to noble. Perhaps all of this talk of the Rights of the Strong and the Duties of the Weak was for show. Perhaps. Such is the danger of talking about oneself in terms of strength in an ideology of absolutes."
 vedina.75.a:0 "A minor setback."
 
 
 vedina_quest.1.t:0 "The Quest of Valor"
 vedina_quest.1.d:0 "One of the Princess' many trials is to prove her valor in combat. Thus, she must scour the land, looking for a suitable challenge to combat. There are many such opportunities, but in order to impress the court, she knows that the victory must be a very notable one.\n\nEspecially important for Vedina is that the act is a good deed in of itself. The glory must not be for her, but for Vedina and its people. Thus, the Princess wanders into the sleepy village of Dunkelskugga, which is reportedly having trouble. She wanders into the tavern and..."
 vedina_quest.1.a:0 "...begins to investigate right away!"
 vedina_quest.1.b:0 "...enjoys a quick drink."

 vedina_quest.2.t:0 "Ahh, That Touched The Spot"
 vedina_quest.2.d:0 "A refreshing drink and a few smiles later and the Princess had herself a rather informative discussion with the bartender, who offered her a room for a low price.\n\nIt turns out that the village had been under the thumb of a dragon for a while, having to sacrifice its wealth to it on a regular basis. Why had it not been reported, simple, the local noble lord was corrupt and cared little for their plight. Sköldsvärd thought that fighting a dragon and slaying it would certainly impress the court, but would also be extremely dangerous."
 vedina_quest.2.a:0 "A dragon, eh?"
 vedina_quest.3.t:0 "A Good Night's Rest"
 vedina_quest.3.d:0 "There is nothing quite like a good night's rest, and Sköldsvärd has now found herself quite well rested, eager to take on whatever challenge befalls the village. It has given her time to reflect, and she had decided she should ask the locals."
 vedina_quest.3.a:0 "Perfect."
 vedina_quest.4.t:0 "A Dragon?!"
 vedina_quest.4.d:0 "It was a dragon. A dragon had taken up residence in the nearby mountain and was extorting the village of its riches. A vile injustice indeed. Sköldsvärd needed to deal with this, and thus she vowed to vanquish it.\n\nSuch a thing would not be easy. She would need assistance to fell such a beast, but from who?"
 vedina_quest.4.a:0 "The local knights!"
 vedina_quest.4.b:0 "A bigger gun is all the assistance she needs."
 vedina_quest.4.c:0 "The people must defend themselves!"
 vedina_quest.5.t:0 "The Knights"
 vedina_quest.5.d:0 "A small and effective force of Vedina's finest live in the area, owning several farms and serving the local lord and the crown loyally. It would be foolish not to utilise them. After a quick visit, they are happy to assist the Princess in whatever way she needs.\n\nOf course, proper preparation is sometimes key, but it may be better to deal with this quickly. Sköldsvärd can spend time forming a proper plan, or she can take what she has and hope for the best. What is her decision?"

Apparently there is a substance which can be made from simple herbs which will prove very poisonous to dragons. It won't kill one, but enough to give the Princess and her knights an edge.\n\nStill, isn't such an advantage a dishonourable one?"
 vedina_quest.6.a:0 "Use it!"
 vedina_quest.6.b:0 "We can do without."
 vedina_quest.7.t:0 "Victory!"
 vedina_quest.7.d:0 "The brave knights charged forth with the Princess at their head, dashing into the ancient lair of the dragon. There a heated battle erupted, quickly silencing the ancient dragon in the mountain. It put up a good fight, but armed with poisoned weapons and a determination to defend their country, the attackers defeated the greedy dragon. The killing blow was dealt by the Princess herself and the dragon's treasure hoard has been seized and returned to the peaceful village. A victory for liberty, and for Vedina, and for the Princess who has proved her valor in battle."
 vedina_quest.7.a:0 "Excellent."
 vedina_quest.8.t:0 "Dishonourable Discharge"
 vedina_quest.8.d:0 "The Princess is right, the knights of Vedina do not fight in such underclawed ways. They will fight the dragon with honour and that is that. Poison is for weaklings and treasonous scoundrels, after all. Thus, Sköldsvärd is resolved, she will fight the dragon in a fair fight."
 vedina_quest.8.a:0 "It is the right thing to do."
 vedina_quest.9.t:0 "Victory!"
 vedina_quest.9.d:0 "The brave knights charged forth with the Princess at their head, dashing into the ancient lair of the dragon. There a heated battle erupted. It was a long and drawn out one and some casualties were taken. Still, at the very least the dragon has been killed by the Princess' claws and the dragon's hoard was returned to the village below."
 vedina_quest.9.a:0 "A good outcome at least."
 vedina_quest.10.t:0 "The Royal Artillery"
 vedina_quest.10.d:0 "One of Vedina's finest artillery battalions are stationed nearby. A short journey brought the Princess to their barracks. It didn't take much to work out that a dragon couldn't possibly withstand a barrage from modern artillery guns. Thus, the artillery company is more than happy to assist her. The plan is to use the Princess as bait for the dragon, to lure it out to a specific location. Then, the artillery can blow the beast to smithereens."
 vedina_quest.10.a:0 "Sounds like a good plan."
 vedina_quest.11.t:0 "Hook, Line, and..."
 vedina_quest.11.d:0 "With that the Princess returns to the village. A nice open field lays in front of the dragon's lair, making it a prime location to bombard. Thus, Sköldsvärd leaves the artillery company to set up and journeys to the dragon's lair. Once she has received the green light from a flag waved in the distance, the Princess dashes into the cave and attacks the dragon."
 vedina_quest.11.a:0 "Don't you die on me now."
 vedina_quest.12.t:0 "Splat!"
 vedina_quest.12.d:0 "After a few moments, Sköldsvärd returns, with a very angry dragon on her tail. The lumbering beast crashes out of the cave and heads right into the open field. The artillery begins its bombardment, raining shells upon shells on the dragon until there is nothing left but a crater. Sköldsvärd has survived, having gotten herself well clear with her wings, and has earned victory over the dragon, returning its hoard to the people of the town."
 vedina_quest.12.a:0 "Anygriff up for pancakes?"
 vedina_quest.13.t:0 "The People Rise"
 vedina_quest.13.d:0 "This village would do better if it learned to fend for itself. Thus, Sköldsvärd should assist them in defeating the dragon. The people seem reluctant, but the Princess enthuses them that with her help and leadership they can accomplish this lofty task. With that she manages to form an impromptu militia. Now all she has to do is decide their course of action."
 vedina_quest.13.a:0 "An ambush is our best bet."
 vedina_quest.13.b:0 "Let's seal the cave."
 vedina_quest.13.c:0 "Perhaps trained soldiers would be better..."
 vedina_quest.14.t:0 "An Ambush is chosen"
 vedina_quest.14.d:0 "It has been decided that the militia's best chance will be to ambush the dragon outside its lair and use specialised weighted nets to hold it down while they slowly kill the beast with longspears. The preparations are long and the Princess assists with training and construction. It is hard work, but eventually, they are ready. With Sköldsvärd as bait, it is all down to her."
 vedina_quest.14.a:0 "Charge!"
 vedina_quest.15.t:0 "Victory!"
 vedina_quest.15.d:0 "The trap was a success. Sköldsvärd dashed into the cave to get the dragon's attention before running away, drawing the dragon out. There the people of Dunkelskugga struck, and they struck hard, trapping the dragon and fighting it at length with long spears and sharpened poles. It was a slow and painful demise for the creature, and not all of the militia made it back alive. Still, with the threat of the dragon gone and its hoard returned to them, they can now rest at peace and recuperate."
 vedina_quest.15.a:0 "Job done."
 vedina_quest.16.t:0 "Blow It All Up!"
 vedina_quest.16.d:0 "Frankly, getting a militia to fight a dragon is a bad idea. So why not instead use something else entirely? The power of dynamite! With a few careful demolition charges, the sleeping dragon can be killed without a fight. Ingenious indeed. After all, why wake it if it is asleep? With the dynamite secured and the plan in place, all that is needed is the execution."
 vedina_quest.16.a:0 "Just don't bring the whole mountain down..."
 vedina_quest.17.t:0 "Boom!"
 vedina_quest.17.d:0 "A single deafening explosion rung through the mountain as the dynamite was triggered. No doubt the dragon was quite surprised when it exploded in its sleep. Placing the dynamite had been a challenge, but Sköldsvärd is light on her claws, and managed to place it in all the right spots. With the dragon dead, the villagers can now mine out the old lair to retrieve its treasure."
 vedina_quest.17.a:0 "A rather sudden end."
 vedina_quest.18.t:0 "Bandits!"
 vedina_quest.18.d:0 "Another great Vedinan value is the value of honour. Thus, the Princess has come to the County of Flodbotten. Reports of bandits and brigands have come from the county recently, and the local Vedinan nobility seems to have done nothing about it. In order to deliver justice to the county, the Princess must intervene! But how exactly?"
 vedina_quest.18.a:0 "Confront the vagabonds bravely!"
 vedina_quest.18.b:0 "Lure them into an ambush."
 vedina_quest.56.t:0 "A Plot Twist"
 vedina_quest.56.d:0 "This isn't about just bandits anymore. Unfortunately, the quest will not be so straightforward. After confronting the bandits and defeating them in combat, the Princess learned that the local count is actually sponsoring them! He is using the bandits to raid trade convoys, then offers his own soldiers to the merchants for a high price, making quite a profit from protecting the caravans and barges. Sköldsvärd could just leave it, she had defeated the bandits for now, but would it not be better to solve this once and for all?"
 vedina_quest.56.a:0 "Let's solve this properly."
 vedina_quest.56.b:0 "Nah, job done."
 vedina_quest.19.t:0 "Confronting the Lord"
 vedina_quest.19.d:0 "The Count of Flodbotten greeted the Princess with open claws. He freely admits that he was using the bandits for his own gain. In fact, he offers the Princess a portion of the profits should she let him continue. It's a generous offer indeed, but can the Princess really afford to damage her integrity?"
 vedina_quest.19.a:0 "For the right price she can."
 vedina_quest.19.b:0 "Never!"
 vedina_quest.20.t:0 "Change In Management"
 vedina_quest.20.d:0 "The Count has to go, that is for sure. But should the Princess deal with this? She could simply promote a new knight to the position and revoke the count's title, but that would no doubt anger the rest of the nobility. She could put him on trial as well, surely that would be the right thing to do?"
 vedina_quest.20.a:0 "I am the law!"
 vedina_quest.20.b:0 "A fair trial!"
 vedina_quest.21.t:0 "The Trial"
 vedina_quest.21.d:0 "After a fair trial by public jury, the Count is sentenced to death. He is executed and a new regional governor, known for her dedication to law and order, is installed in his place. Justice has prevailed and the Princess has proven herself to be an honourable ruler for Vedina."
 vedina_quest.21.a:0 "Honour is all."
 vedina_quest.22.t:0 "Charity"
 vedina_quest.22.d:0 "In order to ensure a prosperous realm the king's court is expected to donate vast sums of money to good causes in order to boost economic growth in the country and to ensure the health and safety of the people. To get Vedina back on its paws and to ensure that its people prosper, Sköldsvärd is tasked with leading the donations."
 vedina_quest.22.a:0 "What is the situation?"
 vedina_quest.22.b:0 "No charity on my watch!"
 vedina_quest.23.t:0 "Charity"
 vedina_quest.23.d:0 "There are three distinct issues the poor suffer in Vedina. Firstly, traditional village communities have suffered due to continued industrialisation and urbanisation, meaning griffons live increasingly often on their own, without a family to support them. We should invest in community projects and centres in order to bring griffons closer together once again. The second is the large amount of sick griffons in the country. Modern medicine has not quite made its way over to Vedina, so we should take steps to ensure that the people get the care they need. Thirdly, there has been an increase in the awareness of the plight of the disabled. If a factory worker is severely injured at work, then most of the time they are let go from the factory. We should ensure there is some kind of social care for these people, to ensure their families do not go hungry."
 vedina_quest.23.a:0 "Focus on community projects."
 vedina_quest.23.b:0 "Focus on the sick."
 vedina_quest.23.c:0 "Focus on the disabled."
 vedina_quest.23.e:0 "No. We're trying this new thing called austerity."
 vedina_quest.24.t:0 "Charity"
 vedina_quest.24.d:0 "There is still more to do. We have yet to focus on some areas in our country. What should we focus on next?"
 vedina_quest.24.a:0 "Focus on community projects."
 vedina_quest.24.b:0 "Focus on the sick."
 vedina_quest.24.c:0 "Focus on the disabled."
 vedina_quest.24.e:0 "This is taking too long!"
 vedina_quest.25.t:0 "Charity"
 vedina_quest.25.d:0 "There is still more to do. We have yet to focus on some areas in our country. What should we focus on next?"
 vedina_quest.25.a:0 "Focus on community projects."
 vedina_quest.25.b:0 "Focus on the sick."
 vedina_quest.25.c:0 "Focus on the disabled."
 vedina_quest.25.e:0 "This is taking too long!"
 vedina_quest.26.t:0 "Community projects"
 vedina_quest.26.d:0 "Investing in public parks and community projects, we have managed to restore a community spirit with the people. With some government support, these initiatives have soared, and community clubs and celebrations have began in earnest. Griffons support one another and are more willing to share, which is remarkable considering the inherent greed of our species."
 vedina_quest.26.a:0 "No griffon left behind!"
 vedina_quest.26.b:0 "No griffon left behind!"
 vedina_quest.26.c:0 "No griffon left behind!"
 vedina_quest.27.t:0 "Healing The Sick"
 vedina_quest.27.d:0 "Investment in modern hospitals and healthcare have borne fruit. Our people are healthier and better suited for modern life. Life expectancy rates are up and so is productivity. The new health service industry is booming and the people are greatful to the Princess for this investment."
 vedina_quest.27.a:0 "Excellent."
 vedina_quest.27.b:0 "Excellent."
 vedina_quest.27.c:0 "Excellent."
 vedina_quest.28.t:0 "The Disabled"
 vedina_quest.28.d:0 "Our focus on disabled citizens has earned us great respect. A new social credit has been established for those injured in the workplace, which means that less families are going hungry. With this safety net, the disabled can focus on retraining and rebuilding their livelihood."
 vedina_quest.28.a:0 "Wonderful."
 vedina_quest.28.b:0 "Wonderful."
 vedina_quest.28.c:0 "Wonderful."
 vedina_quest.29.t:0 "Sköldsvärd the Charitable"
 vedina_quest.29.d:0 "With three major social issues solved by copious amounts of government funding, Sköldsvärd's position has been strengthened. She has been established as capable of social reform and has proven that she is more than capable of the knightly virtue of charity."
 vedina_quest.29.a:0 "Huzzah."
 vedina_quest.30.t:0 "Austerity"
 vedina_quest.30.d:0 "The notion of charity is all well and good, but it doesn't help the economy. We should cut this waste and ensure that we continue to profit. There is no profit in such activities after all. In order to get our economy back on track, we must cut off this fat and prosper. With a healthier economy, our citizens will be healthier as well, eventually."
 vedina_quest.30.a:0 "Yes, perfect."
 vedina_quest.31.t:0 "Austerity"
 vedina_quest.31.d:0 "With the budget cuts we have purposed, we have managed to cut several unnecesary services down to the bone. This has resulted in a number of savings which can be poured back into our economy."
 vedina_quest.31.a:0 "Job done!"
 vedina_quest.32.t:0 "A Quest of Patience"
 vedina_quest.32.d:0 "Patience, another grand Vedinan virtue. Patience and tolerance of others, giving a knight the ability to learn and adapt to other cultures. For it is true, the world is full of magic and strange creatures aplenty. Perhaps seeking out others will teach Sköldsvärd of patience and tolerance."
 vedina_quest.32.a:0 "Lets go out and about."
 vedina_quest.32.b:0 "Perhaps a good book will teach me?"
 vedina_quest.33.t:0 "A Day on the Beach"
 vedina_quest.33.d:0 "The coastline of Vedina is long, and during her childhood Sköldsvärd grew quite fond of the sea. She found a gentle serenity in the soothing sound of waves and the salty wind from the sea. Surely nothing bad could lurk here? No, just nature's guardians. Yet still, something stirs in the water. What could it be?"
 vedina_quest.33.a:0 "Is it..."
 vedina_quest.34.t:0 "A Monster!"
 vedina_quest.34.d:0 "A sea serpent erupted from the waters, rising high into the air. It looked down upon Sköldsvärd, its visage twisted in hate. "Who dares to once again disturb the peace of my home? This beach belongs to me, not to greedy griffons! I've had enough of your kind!" Clearly the creature was not happy about her being here. The objective of this quest was to make friends and understand creatures, but the serpent's wrath makes the Princess doubt that words could save her. What should she do?"
 vedina_quest.34.a:0 "Teach the beast some respect!"
 vedina_quest.34.b:0 "Surely this anger must come from somewhere."
 vedina_quest.35.t:0 "One Dead Serpent"
 vedina_quest.35.d:0 "The sea serpent's scales are no match for Sköldsvärd's blade. The battle is quick and decisive and Sköldsvärd comes out of it quite unscathed. With the savage beast dead, she returns home. Perhaps she can't be friends with everything after all..."
 vedina_quest.35.a:0 "Oh well..."
 vedina_quest.36.t:0 "Friends With A Serpent"
 vedina_quest.36.d:0 "Sköldsvärd told the sea serpent she meant no harm. She had come seeking him out and wished to know more about him and his kind. She told him she wanted to be friends, and the sea serpent surprisingly broke into tears. He gave her a big strong hug and told her no griffon had ever wanted to be his friend before. After a short introduction, he swam next to Sköldsvärd as she walked along the beach and went on a long monologue about griffons. He only wished to be left in peace, yet the locals continued to harass him, always coming to his home beach to catch fish, swim, sunbathe or to dump their garbage into the ocean. "You see Sköldsvärd," he told her, "At first I told the griffons to leave me alone, but they were afraid of me and thought I was some vile beast who wanted to eat them and attacked me. Ever since I've taken a more stern stance, slowly becoming the monster they thought I was. But you... you weren't like them. You didn't let your assumptions guide you and treated me like an equal. Perhaps I should treat griffons the same from now on."\n\nThat lesson would stick with Sköldsvärd. Each person was far more complex than they first appeared. She left the sea serpent then and vowed to visit from time to time, but most importantly, she instructed the local villagers to avoid the beach and leave the sea serpent alone."
 vedina_quest.36.a:0 "Who knew?"
 vedina_quest.37.t:0 "A Loony Old Bird!"
 vedina_quest.37.d:0 "A griffon suddenly emerged out of the water, equipped with diving gear. He seemed rather old and angry. "You!" he snapped at her, "Get out of here. The ancient treasure buried here belong to me! I've been looking for it for years, and I won't let some chick like you take it from me!" Sköldsvärd was taken aback by the griffon's hostility. Perhaps there is some wisdom to be learned here, but then again, from the looks of this old coot, it will likely be a waste of time. What should she do?"
 vedina_quest.37.a:0 "This griffon needs to be in an asylum."
 vedina_quest.37.b:0 "Perhaps she should speak more softly."
 vedina_quest.38.t:0 "Public Service"
 vedina_quest.38.d:0 "A quiet tip to the local constabulary and the old griffon has been carted off to the asylum. Apparently he is receiving treatment for his unique condition and he will not bother the locals anymore. However, Sköldsvärd wonders if that was the right decision. She didn't even try to figure out if the old griffon was actually ill..."
 vedina_quest.38.a:0 "At least that's one quest down."
 vedina_quest.39.t:0 "A Curious Theory"
 vedina_quest.39.d:0 "It seems that the old loony is rather obsessed with finding this treasure. It takes several hours to earn his trust, but once it is finally earned Sköldsvärd begins to see that he has much wisdom. The old hermit has been a treasure hunter for years, finding everything he looked for except the loot of an ancient searaider lord who once ruled these lands. He had done extensive research and concluded that the treasure had to be buried on the beach, and was certain he was close to finding it. He clearly knows much about history, and Sköldsvärd could well learn from him."
 vedina_quest.39.a:0 "Informative and useful."
 vedina_quest.40.t:0 "Feeling Bookish"
 vedina_quest.40.d:0 "Rather than go outside, Sköldsvärd thinks that she should instead read a book. After all, this questing has taken it out of her a bit, and she wants a nice quiet weekend away with a good book. But what to read?"
 vedina_quest.40.a:0 "Isn't there a new romance novel?"
 vedina_quest.40.b:0 "How about a spellbook?"
 vedina_quest.41.t:0 "Very Stirring"
 vedina_quest.41.d:0 "The romance novel has Sköldsvärd enthralled all week. A lovely griffon couple struggling with debt and the burden of trying to raise children are the main characters. With everything going on, their relationship has stalled, and the book follows their quest to rekindle their relationship and rebuild their lives. Sköldsvärd wonders at its meaning and if she might end up feeling that same love and romance. Perhaps a fling with an unsuspecting griffon will quell these needy feelings."
 vedina_quest.41.a:0 "A fling will certainly suffice."
 vedina_quest.41.b:0 "A romance takes work!"
 vedina_quest.42.t:0 "A One Night Stand"
 vedina_quest.42.d:0 "That dashing and muscular griffon will never know just who the lovely griffoness was. They met in a cozy bar just on the outskirts of Järnköping, and he was too drunk to recognize the Princess. She wanted him and he wanted her. After all was said and done, Sköldsvärd was left feeling empty. There was little point in it all, and she only felt that wonderful feeling for a brief time. Could it be she was wrong?"
 vedina_quest.42.a:0 "Dissapointing."
 vedina_quest.43.t:0 "Waiting For The One"
 vedina_quest.43.d:0 "Sköldsvärd remains determined. Of course, such love cannot be earned in a single night. She will have to wait and hope that her future husband, or wife, is as wonderful as the griffons described in her book. Thus Sköldsvärd resolves to wait until she has been married to experience the pleasures of the flesh."
 vedina_quest.43.a:0 "Waiting for a better reward."
 vedina_quest.44.t:0 "A Spellbook"
 vedina_quest.44.d:0 "The tome of magic is from Equestria, of course. While griffons have their own enchantments, the magic of unicorns is far greater, and very unknown to Sköldsvärd. The book quickly becomes a fascination, the arcane mysteries that unicorns can tap into and bend to their will is quite staggering and different to how griffons react to magical forces. She certainly could know more, but how should she go about that?"
 vedina_quest.44.a:0 "She'll kidnap a unicorn."
 vedina_quest.44.b:0 "She'll befriend a unicorn."
 vedina_quest.45.t:0 "Captured!"
 vedina_quest.45.d:0 "It takes quite a while to find a unicorn to capture. There are a few Equestrian magicians in Vedina, most of which are explorers or foreign advisors. She had to trick one into an ambush and knock them out so they couldn't escape with their magic. After the pony recovers from her questionable act, Sköldsvärd interrogates the pony about their magic, and actually learns a fair bit. However, she now has the problem of a rather terrified unicorn in her basement."
 vedina_quest.45.a:0 "Let's deal with that later."
 vedina_quest.46.t:0 "A Tea Party"
 vedina_quest.46.d:0 "Sköldsvärd decided to host a tea party with several prominent unicorn magicians. Throughout they educate and inform her about the many possibilities that unicorn magic has, as well as telling her of great tales of magical feats. Sköldsvärd is intrigued the entire afternoon, and she learns a lot about them. They can interact with the world very differently to her, and it opens her eyes up to the possibility that there may be other perspectives to problems she has not thought of herself."
 vedina_quest.46.a:0 "What a nice afternoon."
 vedina_quest.47.t:0 "The Knight's Code"
 vedina_quest.47.d:0 "In order to become a fully fledged knight of Vedina, the Princess must learn the Knight's Code and know it by heart. While it is a dull task, it is a very necessary one as there is much wisdom in its words."
 vedina_quest.47.d_try_again:0 "No, that was wrong. I need to start over again.\n\nIn order to become a fully fledged knight of Vedina, the Princess must learn the Knight's Code and know it by heart. While it is a dull task, it is a very necessary one as there is much wisdom in its words."

 vedina_quest.49.d:0 "Yes, Vedinan knights should only fight to defend the weak and protect those under their charge.\n\nVedinan nobility are expected to behave with nobility and grace. They are bastions of truth and justice in an era of strife and mistrust. Therefore, a knight of Vedina should..."

But what are these words to the Princess. What do they mean?"
 vedina_quest.51.a:0 "They're just words."
 vedina_quest.51.b:0 "It means Vedina is awe inspiring."
 vedina_quest.51.c:0 "It teaches one to better oneself."
 vedina_quest.52.t:0 "Just Words"
 vedina_quest.52.d:0 "Yes, perhaps they are just that. Words. Sköldsvärd halfheartedly learns the knightly code for ceremonial purposes, but doesn't give it much thought other than that..."
 vedina_quest.52.a:0 "Oh well..."
 vedina_quest.53.t:0 "Hurrah for Vedina!"
 vedina_quest.53.d:0 "Indeed, this just shows how much better Vedina is than everywhere else. It shows that Vedinan knights truly are noble in purpose and in spirit. Sköldsvärd seeks to be just like them, though is it right that she is just doing that for her country?"
 vedina_quest.53.a:0 "Perhaps."
 vedina_quest.54.t:0 "It Teaches To Better Oneself"
 vedina_quest.54.d:0 "Perhaps Sköldsvärd has understood the meaning behind those words. She seeks to better herself that she might inspire others and spread harmony and good through the world. Perhaps that is the true lesson to be learned here..."
 vedina_quest.54.a:0 "Something to think about."
 vedina_quest.55.t:0 "Princess Returns Home"
 vedina_quest.55.d:0 "A crowd was treated to a rather fantastic landing as Princess Sköldsvärd returned home to the capital in a rather adventurous fashion. She had finished her quest and demonstrated each of the values of Vedina. Now that she has returned home, she can rest and can focus on other matters. No doubt her life will return to the reality of governing a kingdom, but she will always remember the adventure she had on her noble quest."

 vedina_wedding.1.t:0 "The Wedding Preparations"
 vedina_wedding.1.d:0 "The rush of courtship, the hunts and the parties and everything else, have all been exhausting. But it's all been worth it in the end. Sköldsvärd has found a mate worthy of being her royal consort, one who will stay by her side through the coming days as she struggles to reform Vedina.\n\nThe wedding has been planned extensively and no expense has been spared, though her partner is less than thrilled to be at the center of such royal opulence! The nobility and the knights still look at her askance, but she knows this will change with time. The line of succession will be secured, and her new consort will help her navigate all of this political intrigue... Or so she hopes. There are a few lingering doubts in the back of her mind.\n\nAnd into this mixture of doubt and happiness, a certain prince seeks a brief private audience with his liege..."
 vedina_wedding.1.a:0 "Seems harmless."
 vedina_wedding.2.t:0 "Ondska Interrupts"
 vedina_wedding.2.d:0 "Ondska meets the princess in the gardens, where once they strolled a-courting. He seems far less composed, far less happy. He makes small talk at first, taking tea and inquiring after the wedding preparations. A knot of anxiety in Sköldsvärd's chest slowly unwinds. She had worried about what he would say, but perhaps he is truly here to wish her well.\n\nUntil, of course, he asks with a practiced air of indifference whether or not she's found that respect she so eagerly sought for in all of courting and questing. Do the griffons of Vedina really respect her? Will they follow her if times turn for the worse? He's heard some terrible things. Some are even whispering that the people are glad to have her weakness shored up by her spouse's strengths. Knights laugh at stories of her hunting expedition and worry that she is too young and foolish to lead the armies of the Kingdom. Isn't there an older, more determined veteran griffon to lead?\n\nOndska offers a simple solution. With him, she could be more than just a figurehead. Together, they could bring these backtalking anklebiters into line and bring Vedina into a glorious new age. All Sköldsvärd has to do is choose a different spouse. "

They want us to go crawling back to the Empire and with your weakness they will get their way. I could have given you everything!"\n\nSköldsvärd rises and forces the arrogant would be suitor back just as his claws reach for a sword. But she does not need to call for guards or for her own sword. Faced with real resistance, the craven griffon takes to the sky, cursing Sköldsvärd and her intended."

 vedina_wedding.4.t:0 "The Wedding"
 vedina_wedding.4.d:0 "The wedding goes ahead, to the delight of the peasantry who have for a brief time been allowed to congregate about the castle in great cheerful throngs. Inside, the air is far more reserved. The nobility, the knights, and the leading commons are outwardly congratulatory, but there is some discomfort in the air. It is the same uncertainty that has plagued the princess since the very beginning.\n\nBut at the height of the actual ceremony, there is a pause. The representatives of the various estates step forward to offer their support for the Queen-to-be. The Commons do so readily. The representative chosen for the knightly classes also assents, tho he is noticeably less enthusiastic. The chosen noble, a richly-dressed duke, steps forward, and every griffon present holds their breath. His refusal at this stage would be more than just embarrassing. It would be a disaster of the highest order, enough to potentially set the whole noble estate against Sköldsvärd.\n\nKnights fidget in ceremonial armor. Barons and Counts tense up and look amongst themselves, as if confirming that they all know what is coming next."

 vedina_wedding.5.d:0 "Everything has gone wrong. The noble estate has chosen to reject the princess' match definitively, and when Sköldsvärd did not assent to being controlled by their will, things came to blows. Chaos tore the wedding celebrations apart, and knights took sides in a chaotic free-for-all. The Princess, her intended, and a rearguard of knights beat a fighting retreat until they could take to the sky in front of the shocked peasantry outside.\n\nThe council of nobles is formed within hours of distraught but grimly determined nobles. This was not the outcome they had hoped for, and outside the commons are in a general uproar. Every griffon on the street wants blood, and most of them want the blood of the landed gentry in particular. The princess, now wildly popular with the lower orders, has escaped and may yet lead a resistance against the council's rule."

 vedina_wedding.6.t:0 "A Red Wedding"
 vedina_wedding.6.d:0 "The noble estate gives its blessing, and the wedding proceeds... Until another voice interrupts, one unlooked for and definitely unasked for: Prince Ondska.\n\nHe invokes an ancient right, one of combat. As he does, several black-cloaked knights emerge from the crowd. A coup? No, he says, cutting a dashing figure, a duel! When the new monarch ascends fully to power, they can be challenged. No one has invoked this right in centuries, and it is probably no longer binding. But his knights all carry guns, and he himself has drawn a sword. Outside, more conspirators clash with unprepared guards and cut down slow-moving or uppity commoners who get in their way. \n\nSköldsvärd panics. She has to stop this madman, but what options does she have? Ondska repeats his challenge. Single combat, one on one, for the future of Vedina and its griffons."

 vedina_wedding.7.d:0 "Sköldsvärd has not yet answered the challenge. The throne room is filled with panicking griffons and well-armed traitor knights. At any point, the loyal knights may draw their weapons and the bloodbath will cripple the nation in a moment. Her life and the life of her kingdom is balanced precariously on the edge of a knife.\n\nThere are two choices. On her right, the prelate is still gripping in his ancient claws the ceremonial blade that her forefathers have sworn on for generations. It is heavy, impractical, but it is the choice of the knightly ruler. It's the weapon that her chivalrous ancestors would have chosen without hesitation. If she took it, she would fight Ondska on similar terms, griffon to griffon, and show everyone that Harmony did not need to compromise its integrity.\n\nOn the other claw, on her left is a guard who is stuck mid-step watching the traitors. He cannot move, but she can. His sidearm would solve the supremacist puzzle in front of her efficiently and cleanly, and with luck perhaps take a few of his traitors too.\n\nShe clenches her claws. Two choices, and two potential futures."

 vedina_wedding.8.d:0 "Before she can make any decision, the princess is thrown to the floor by an explosion. Outside, the conspirators lose control of the situation and the scuffles become a running battle. An overeager conspirator with an explosive hit the palace itself with the blast and part of the ceiling comes down.\n\nSköldsvärd looks up... and there, in the loosened masonry, is an ancient looking sword. She acts, springing forward to grab it and dispatch the traitor while there is still time. Chaos rules, but she and Ondska face each other in single combat, their swords high. As she fights, she feels a certainty-- the ancient sword of her fathers was truly false. This is the blade blessed by the Lady, and today she wields it to save her people.\n\nOndska parries her thrusts, and she sidesteps his wild, aggressive attacks. He wounds her leg, but she manages to tear gashes in his arms. He overestimates his own speed, and she hews through a wing.\n\nThe traitor prince goes down, and the Princess offers him a noble end. But he refuses, pulling a knife and tripping her. But it is not to be. Whether imbued with the sword's power or just her own training, Sköldsvärd cuts him down at last, and the conspirators flee the capitol."

The princess wastes no time in grabbing the sidearm from the closest guard.\n\nShe points it at the prince. He rises, meeting her eyes. "Is this how you truly are? A coward?"\n\n"I'm not the one who brought a sword to a wedding because no one would mate with me," Sköldsvärd snarls, her demeanor cold with contempt as she gunned him down. The prince died without his duel, and the conspirators fled from the castle as their leader falls."

 vedina_wedding.10.t:0 "The Edge of Darkness"
 vedina_wedding.10.d:0 "Inevitably, every choice and step down dark paths corrupts the heart. As the Princess and the dashing Ondska talk in private, his true intentions become more and more obvious. His veiled talk of the Strong and the Weak stops being veiled and ironic and becomes explicit and cruel. The Strong crushing the Weak is not something to be avoided, but something that he wishes for fervently. But there is more than that. He talks about the vitality and thrill of magic, real magic, born of blood and acts of domination. He whispers about the absolute power of blood magic, when the right offerings are brought. The world is a machine that you put coins into and pull the lever, and out comes a prize! It's just that sometimes, the coin is griffon lives.\n\nThe Princess is dismayed, but she has also changed. Ondska was right about how others saw her. Despite her triumphs and efforts, the nobles have never respected her. Perhaps they never will, unless she forces them to do so. Sköldsvärd may not be sure about all the blood magic, but putting the fear of Gods into people so that they will finally respect the Worthy? That sounds better and better."

 vedina_wedding.11.d:0 "Ondska continues, and lays out his own wedding plans. Things will go as normal... until his supporters use this occasion when everyone is in the same place to impress on them exactly what kind of change the two of them have in store. With the help of her own guards, Prince and Princess can take the country's elites hostage and centralize their hold on power in a single day. It's a bold plan.\n\nSköldsvärd decides that its a workable one, as well. She claw-picks several of her most trusted griffons and soon the corruption seeps into every corner of the palace. The guards, the retainer-knights, all of them may not be enthused about magic, but they are certainly loyal to their soon-to-be queen in a way darker than before. When the day of the wedding arrives, they will be ready.\n\nOndska invites several mages from parts unknown and with Sköldsvärd's blessing she gives them lodging in the palace. The knights may grumble about their oddities, but the mages are brilliant researchers... and just as ethically-challenged as Ondska himself."

 vedina_wedding.12.d:0 "The wedding is beautiful, and a tiny part of Sköldsvärd is sad that it will all end in violence. But that part of her is sentimental and weak, the part that the nobles laughed about behind her back. She crushes it.\n\nAs the common and knightly estates send forth a representative to offer their allegiance to the newly crowned Queen, all eyes are on the chosen noble representative. It is his assent that will truly clench the crown... That is, it would if there weren't alternative plans in motion. He steps forward, no doubt to voice his disapproval of the chosen prince, when black cloaked knights spring forth from the illusionary spells that Ondska's mage friends crafted for them. They hold dozens of key noble griffons at sword and gunpoint, and a laughing Ondska confronts the stammering naysayer himself.\n\nKnights draw their weapons, and as Ondska slays the representative in cold blood the palace devolves into chaos as battles rage. Sköldsvärd finds herself looking down at slain noble griffons who she knew used to mock her, and she spits on their corpses. They could have avoided this. They brought this on themselves."

 vedina_wedding.13.d:0 "The Red Wedding, as its called, was not entirely successful. While many prominent harmonist and conservative nobles were slain, still more escaped or were unable to be present in the first place. Many knights did not side with the openly evil prince and princess, and now rouse the peasantry to action. Ondska's hope for a single clean stroke is foiled.\n\nBut that's alright. After all, what better way to refine strength than war? As nobles and knights and peasants rise up against his now magically-charged reign, the dark magician is confident that those willing to seize power like himself will always triumph over fearful old griffons and their old ways. His mages work day and night on new spells and curses, and his dark knights whip the miserable commons into shape. Those who will not serve as fodder for the army will serve as fodder for spells or factories. "

He's right, after all, about how the nobles sneer at her behind her back and the commons don't care about her at all. She is all alone in this world.\n\nBut when he turns to dark magic, to sacrifice and domination, she recoils. Emotionally, she wants to punish those who have wronged her, that's true. But since she was born, the Princess loved the stories about King Förena and the Wise Lady and the sword Oövervinnlighet. She dreamed of quests and knighthood and being loved by all. This... this isn't anything like that. What has she been doing all this time?\n\nDisgusted, Sköldsvärd tries to push back and change topics, but Ondska is monomanic. He doubles down. She asks him to leave, and he becomes murderously furious. He leaves... only to return the next day. As she walks to clear her head, the Princess and her guards are attacked.

She makes it to the armory with a squadron of guards, only to find that traitors defend it. Battle is joined. She slips through the struggle and stumbles at the door.\n\nOne of the dark knights calls on a talisman given him by a mage and there is a flash of light and fire as the hallway shakes apart. When the smoke clears, there are but two left standing. Sköldsvärd, pressed against the armory door, and a limping traitor. In her panic she tries to get in the door to find a firearm. She manages to get in, finds a pistol, brings it to bear with ammunition as the knight raises his sword...\n\nThe gun jams. Sköldsvärd dies alone, as the knight escapes to rejoin his comrades.

In the throne room, Ondska's pet mages unleash spells which tear up the floor and ceiling before they are slain. Knights fall into the pits and are crushed beneath the rubble. Sköldsvärd herself is almost crushed, but rolls into a crater. There in the indention she finds an ancient strongbox, long buried beneath the castle, now blown open by fighting. And inside?\n\nSköldsvärd lifts the legendary sword Oövervinnlighet high, feeling power running through it. Is it magic, or just the weight of history and purpose? She does not know, but she wields it beautifully, cutting a path to her would be lover Ondska. They fight griffon to griffon, and at last she cuts him down in honorable combat in the great hall before the shattered throne of Vedina. His army is defeated.\n\nSköldsvärd weeps.

She has been scarred by battle and by betrayal... but is also invigorated by the recovery of Vedina's sacred artifact and her own renewed sense of historic, harmonic purpose. The shadow over her soul has been burned away in the fires of conflict.\n\nBut who will sit beside her? Vedina must have heirs and must have a ruling couple. She still needs a consort. Only two choices remain, and both have come in person to offer their help no matter what. Both care for her and also for her nation. Should she choose beautiful, brilliant Lycklig's way of social reform and the uplifting of the common griffon? Or the gallant, dedicated Stridande's path of military reform and a renewed paternalistic harmony for the downtrodden?"

Her father left her both a legacy and a mission, and she almost squandered both because of the lies and the handsome face of a maniac. She has another chance, but only just barely.\n\nThe sword Oövervinnlighet takes a prominent place now in the palace as a testament to this, and she had it installed over the throne. It is pointed downwards, in a way that she feels is almost ominous. It seems to say, remember what can happen when you fail. Certainly she knows now.\n\nBut no griffon can be this solemn on the eve of a joyous wedding, and so Sköldsvärd too eventually leaves the quiet of her inner sanctum.

Our special task force has failed to sufficiently suppress the separatist movement, and they have now raised their flag in rebellion!\n\nDuke Fredjanik's forces have massed to the west and are well armed and well trained. Yet their divisions are spread very thinly, we may be able to win out if we concentrate our efforts and push hard against them. We should act quickly, this war will only deplete our strained resources."
 wingstrom.7.a:0 "One less problem to worry about."

 wingstrom_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 3rd October, 941, in Turhamn\n\n§YBiography§!: Gustav IV of the House of Wingstrom, commonly referred to as simply "King Wingstrom", has reigned as King of Vedina for decades, maintaining the traditions and values of the chivalrous monarchy before and after the Republican Revolution. Due to Gustav's efforts, the effects of the Revolution on the wayward Kingdom were largely averted, and the nobility continued to support the rule of the Wingstrom dynasty without significant unrest from the commoners.\n\nEleven years after the Republican Revolution, at the age of 48, the Wise Lady and the gods bestowed upon Gustav his only first and only child, a griffon by the name of Sköldsvärd. Gustav's young wife died soon after, and the King was left with only a female heir to pass the trials of the Vedinan monarchy. As the remaining members of the Wingstrom dynasty died out, more and more nobles clamoured for his heir's claw in marriage, desiring the throne of Vedina for themselves, but Gustav refused each and every one of them - declaring that when she came of age, his daughter would prove herself alone to be worthy of the trials of Vedina, and the Wingstrom name.\n\nNow, his daughter has came of age, and the old King, although still popular among the nobility, has decided that he will abdicate upon his heir's the completion of the trials of Vedina. Due to Gustav's actions, he hopes, the Wingstrom name will live on, regardless of whatever cowardly noble is the one to secure his daughter's claw."
 stridande_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 4th May, 974, in Skyrim\n\n§YBiography§!: There is perhaps no griffon that embodies the martial, chivalrous values of Vedina more than Prince Stridande, third son of the Jarl of Skyrim, Olbricht Wulfharth. A troublesome vassal of Vedina for centuries, the Jarldom has traditionally been one of the most fiercely militaristic lands in all of Griffonia, save for perhaps the Knightly Order of Hellquill, so it was no surprise that Stridande took up the sword and shield of a Knight of Vedina.\n\nLow in the line of succession for his Duchy, Stridande served in numerous tours against the Republicans, participating in skirmishes and border exercises against Northern warlords and Kemerskai's government. Now, he has returned to the scene of the Vedinan nobility, in order to woo the Princess of Vedina and unite their houses in marriage.\n\nUltimately, however, will Stridande's strength and loyalty be enough to save Vedina?"
 ondska_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 24th November, 982, in Halmstad\n\n§YBiography§!: It was almost as if Ondska was pre-destined to be a shadowy schemer, dwelling in the courtly intrigues of Vedina with little regard for the outdated morals of the chivalrous Kingdom. Born to the Norén family, Counts of Flodbotten, Ondska was named "Evil" in Vedinan, a testament to his vengeful father's cynical humour. It is perhaps most ironic that Ondska, at least on the interior, appears to embody his name. Ambitious, ruthless, and cunning, he has risen from cousin of the Counts of Flodbotten to one of the most important schemers in all of Vedina.\n\nHandsome and charming, Ondska seems to be a prime candidate for the new Prince of Vedina, should the Princess take what she hears about him at face value. Much-loved by most of the nobility for his facade of courtesy and generosity, Ondska is the prime candidate of the traditionalist faction of Vedina, discontent with Gustav Wingstrom's reforms of the Vedinan monarchy.\n\nHowever, should the princess find herself looking a little deeper, Ondska's plans surely would be foiled - unless he can convince her of the scheming ways of his family himself."

 GRI_gw_tank_equipment:0 "Airbender"
 GRI_gw_tank_equipment_desc:0 "The 'Airbender' as it was commonly named, was a result of the early machinegun-on-wheels designs of the Republican Revolution, used by Kemerskai's revolutionaries and later Imperial loyalists. The crude designs later developed into the first early tank design in Griffonia, with the Airbender's main armament consisting of a cannon and machinegun in the front and another machinegun on the back."

 GRI_heavy_tank_equipment_1_desc:0 "Developed by Arcturien in 1006, the Beak was the Empire's first attempt as a heavy assault vehicle. Improved by the Changeling attache in Griffonia in the following years, it saw moderate use as a support vehicle for knight assaults until the early 1010's, when it was replaced by newer designs."

 GRI_heavy_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "Designed in 1011 by the Feathisian Kasteel Automobiel, the Gryta sought to reinforce the Beak's strengths in its use as a assault tank. The experience of the Herzland Wars in the last years made Imperial command realize the necessity of a tank that would be capable of breaking through heavily-fortified areas, in addition of knight attacks."

 GRI_melee_equipment_0_desc:0 "The finest Swords from griffon smiths, a relic of ancient times of knightly glory. Carried by the Knightly Orders both as a symbol of their station and functional weapons when enchanted, these masterwork pieces are nonetheless still outdone by modern firearms."
 GRI_melee_equipment_1_desc:0 "The musket was instrumental in conquering Griffonia for the Empire, and Imperial line troops have proudly carried variants of the Vorderlader for two centuries from Aquileia to the Riverlands. Though firmly an antique by 1007, the Model 70 is much beloved, found both in the display cases of noble households and the claws of peasant revolts."

 GRI_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "Originally designed as a high-caliber breech-loaded hunting rifle, Imperial Reichsarmee officers proposed it be as the newest line rifle to replace the aging Vorderlader Model 70. Inspired, Blautal quickly retooled a military model known as the M-X98. This large caliber rifle swiftly replaced the older musket with metal cartridges, and spread like lightning across the Empire for in the following decades."

Now edited, modernized and restored, this bolt-action 7.65mm design inspired the Changeling Gewehr-7, and is now ready for its own service in Griffonian claws."

After seeing its startling use in the Changeling Sturmgewehr, Reichswaffen was immediately ordered to develop a similar automatic rifle.

POLITICS_NIGHTMAREMOON_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography§!: Myths and fables tell of two regal sisters who ruled together, creating harmony for all the land. The eldest used her alicorn powers to raise the sun at dawn; the younger brought out the moon to begin the night. While it is obvious today that the tales speak of the Royal Pony Sisters who rule Equestria, few, if any concrete facts are known about their history.\n\nHowever, the one legend imprinted in everypony's mind speak of a dark nightmare who attempted to overthrow the fair Princess of the Sun, driven by her jealousy and hatred. They clashed in the old Castle of the Two Sisters, and their battle left the proud edifice desolate and ruined. Afterward, the entity calling herself Nightmare Moon was banished, soon forgotten except in cautionary foal stories.\n\nIn what would be shown as a rude awakening, the Nightmare returned after a millennium in exile to bring once more eternal night and despair; but she was defeated by a group of six mares who wielded the legendary Elements of Harmony, revealing the long lost sister of Princess Celestia, Luna. Although Luna tried to reintegrate in the modern world, the strain of leadership, combined with the injustice towards thestrals, have let loose her old grudges and allowed the darkness to take hold again. Now she rules with an iron hoof, yet abandoning some of her more extreme stances in favour of cold, calculating measures.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

POLITICS_CHRYSALIS_DESC:0  "Ruler and despot of the Changeling Hives, Queen Chrysalis was the first of her race to unite them under one banner. From her hatching in 930, she has proven to be an exceptional individual. Being the only child of the dead Queen of Vesalipolis, she was raised with extreme care and given best possible education, which made her spoiled and arrogant, but also intelligent, determined and firm. She was crowned in 945 and fended off an attack from Vraks with her army. Soon after, the Vesalipolis-Ditrysium axis was formed, and it would be the embryo for united Changeling Lands.\n\nUnder her leadership, other hive queens either joined her voluntarily or were forced into submission. She became the sole absolute ruler of her species in 988, but her ambitions only continued to grow. She plotted to take over Equestria by infiltrating Canterlot and decapitating the nation with a single strike, and executed her plans in 1002. Chrysalis herself replaced Princess Cadance and had fooled nearly everyone, and had even bested Princess Celestia. It was by mere fluke that her victory was snatched away from her grasp and her people banished to the frozen North. Clearly infiltration alone is not enough to reclaim what is rightfully hers, and Chrysalis recognises the need of a powerful and modern military. Any opposition and protest to her despotic reign is swiftly crushed as she prepares to redeem her honour, or die trying."

POLITICS_CRIMSON_DESC:0 "On the mountain, Crimson "Ruby" Hayden has watched as Dragons fought over wealth, distrscted by materialism. From early fights and violence between her kind being observed by her, she began to grow a hatred to the Dynasty. After a visit to Stalliongrad, her thoughts began to radicalize, forming the DFCP in 1007 with nationalist, Communist principles. Haydenism is now a popular thought contrast to traditional dragon thought."

POLITICS_CADENZA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 14th of February 972, near Vanhoover\n\n§YBiography§!: Princess Cadance's humble origins belie her future as one of the royal alicorns of Equestria. The pegasus foal, who would later become known as Princess Mi Amore Cadenza, was found in a forest close to Vanhoover by her earth pony adopted parents. Taken to a nearby village, it was a peaceful, calm life until one day, a jealous sorceress named Prismia stole the love of the villagers using a malevolent magical necklace. The young Cadance confronted Prismia and turned her own magic against her, causing her to change her horrible ways. Afterward, Princess Celestia recognised her power, adopted her as her niece and elevated Cadance as the alicorn Princess of Love.\n\nThereafter, Cadance became a foalsitter for Princess Celestia's newest personal student, Twilight Sparkle. She would meet and fall in love with Twilight's older brother, Shining Armour. Their wedding day was going to be perfect, but unfortunately, the scheming Chrysalis, Queen of the Changelings used the opportunity to impersonate Cadance and seize control of Equestria by guile. Despite the presence of a large changeling host and their empowered Queen, Princess Cadance and Shining Armour used the power of their love to cast the changelings out of the country.\n\nWhen the Crystal Empire reappeared, Celestia sent Cadance to rule over it, knowing her to be a descendant of Princess Amore, its last ruler before Sombra's reign. Cadance made her stand there, defeating the nascent shadow of King Sombra that lingered after his banishment by using a mythical artefact called the Crystal Heart. With their success, she and Shining Armour have safekept the land ever since, siring a foal named Flurry Heart along the way.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
POLITICS_SOMBRA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography§!: Sombra's origins are as mysterious as the mere mention of his name is unsettling. What is known, however, comes from the testimony of crystal ponies who were willing enough to speak. He is one of the umbrum — shadow ponies rumoured to be buried under the frozen wastelands of the Crystal Empire, waiting to be released. Some say it was loneliness and dejection that turned him bitter and jaded, striking out against Princess Amore, while others say that it was his only friend and companion, Radiant Hope, who turned Sombra to darkness.\n\nWhat followed is known to everypony: the tyrannical King Sombra used dark magic of the umbrum to enslave the crystal ponies, using many for his personal experiments. His reign of terror only came to an end once the Princesses of Equestria banished him beneath the ice, only for Sombra to curse his land to disappear along with him. After a thousand years, his shadowy form made an attempt to take over again, only to be thwarted by the combined efforts of Princess Cadance and the bearers of the Elements of Harmony.\n\nIt is uncertain whether the most recent reincarnation of King Sombra is the same pony from the myths, but one thing is sure: The King is back.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

POLITICS_EAGLECLAW_DESC:0 "Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw of the Strawberry Duchy is the cousin of Grover V, the Griffonian Emperor and is a griffon who holds vast tracts of land and large amounts of wealth. Were Grover to pass away, she would be a prime candidate to become regent and certainly feels that she would be the only one suitable!\n\nShe is a staunch supporter of the nobility and she will try to uphold the balance between the nobles, religion and the people. She does truly care for her people though, and wants to see them prosper above all else; she even has plans for some minor reforms in the pipeline!\n\nWhile she is no stranger to the life as a noble, ruling her own Duchy would be nothing compared to ruling an entire empire and she might find herself part of a larger power-struggle, tearing the empire apart."
PRINCESS_DARA_DESC:0 "Priestess Dara is worshipped as a demigod and the leader of the tribal union. Most of decisionmaking however is carried out by her mentors, that often act in their selfish interests."

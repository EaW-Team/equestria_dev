# Leaders #
POLITICS_CELESTIA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography§!: Myths and fables tell of two regal sisters who ruled together, creating harmony for all the land. The eldest used her alicorn powers to raise the sun at dawn; the younger brought out the moon to begin the night. While it is obvious today that the tales speak of the Royal Pony Sisters who rule Equestria, few, if any concrete facts are known about their history. Their achievements in defeating Discord, King Sombra, Lord Tirek and other terrors have become legendary.\n\nPrincess Celestia's role in maintaining thousand years of peace after Nightmare Moon's banishment has been well documented. Responsible for raising the Sun, and until recently the Moon, she is perhaps the most beloved creature in the world, being a staunch proponent for peace, kindness and cooperation. With the recent return of Princess Luna to assist her in rulership, Princess Celestia continues to perpetuate the long, relative peace for all the ponies of Equestria.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
POLITICS_CELESTIA_LUNA_DESC:0 "The Princesses of Equestria, Celestia and Luna wield power over the Sun and Moon respectively. Despite the Diarchial power structure, Equestria has always been ruled by Celestia, leaving Luna to assume a supporting role. The recent campaign to welcome the Fourth Tribe into Equestria has changed this, and Princess Luna has now assumed a complementary role alongside her sister, working to realise the dreams of her subjects."
CHANCELLOR_NEIGHSAY_DESC:0 "Neighsay is strict and conservative, preferring to do things by the EEA guidelines. He is also very prejudiced against anyone who is not a pony, openly referring to non-ponies as "creatures" in a dismissive manner."
POLITICS_DAYBREAKER_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography§!: Myths and fables tell of two regal sisters who ruled together, creating harmony for all the land. The eldest used her alicorn powers to raise the sun at dawn; the younger brought out the moon to begin the night. While it is obvious today that the tales speak of the Royal Pony Sisters who rule Equestria, few, if any concrete facts are known about their history.\n\nFor over a thousand years, Princess Celestia has safeguarded her ponies, and the land of Equestria. Doing it solely from the goodness of her own heart, she didn't ask for any compensation, nor demanded their absolute loyalty. Everything the Princess wished was for her little ponies to be protected. Contemporary times, however, are not kind to the ideals of friendship and harmony, with the onslaught of a merciless war leaving very little room for pleasantries.\n\nThus came the ascension of Daybreaker. Infuriated by the gall of her enemies, the former Princess, now Empress, wasted little time in reorganising the state to something far more totalitarian. Many ponies protest in the face of sudden, radical changes, but Daybreaker cares little for the complaints of a minority: all she needs is a devoted herd ready to give their all to protect Equestria.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Twotail813"
POLITICS_BLUEBLOOD_DESC:0 "A well educated and accomplished general from the Equestrian military, Prince Blueblood rode his popularity as a hero of Equestria and his traditionally inherited power as a prince through the elections and into his new role as the executive of the nation. His tactics as a general were strict, disciplined, and conservative, not to mention highly effective, and he carries those methodologies into his administration. Though not necessarily the most humble politician, Blueblood knows how, when, and what to say what the public wants to hear, knows what the public wants, and has the intellect to carry out their will efficiently. Finally, his knowledge as a general gives his pragmatic administration great insight into the military and the defensive needs of the nation, essential in the torn and chaotic modern world."
POLITICS_RICH_DESC:0 "A member of Equestria's nouveau riche at least by Canterloninan standards, Filthy Rich is a pioneering capitalist and industrialist. Ruthless in his business tactics though perhaps not the sharpest at governmental administration as demonstrated by his first and only term as Mayor of Ponyville, his skills at the trade floor translate well to the negotiations table in economic matters. He entered the new democratic political scene through his financial influence and power, under the simple but to some, sort of unsettling catchphrase "Make Equestria Great Again", though not exactly specifying how in the face of opponents with more clear motives, goals, and methods."
POLITICS_PANTS_DESC:0 "Fancy Pants is a renowned member of the old Canterlot elite aristocracy, a shrewd businesspony and a clever diplomat. Though uptight as many Canterlotians are, he has occasionally shown a softer side such as his favorable business dealings with Rarity and forgiveness to the aid of Princess Twilight Sparkle after a notable debacle while she was attending other business. With these qualities, he is a natural choice for a leader that the traditional elite are content with, though some ponies may not agree with his strongly orthodox methods and policy."
POLITICS_MARE_DESC:0 "Considered a pioneer in many respects, Mayor Mare, otherwise known as Flitter Flutter, trailblazed many aspects of democratic campaigning at the local level. Despite a few rough patches in her long administration as the Mayor of Ponyville, losing once to Filthy Rich, she has proven to be both a well meaning and effective leader and diplomat, again at the local level. It remains to be seen if she can effectively run a whole nation as well as she can run a city."
POLITICS_GEARHEART_DESC:0 "A selfmade mare, Copper Gearheart came from humble beginnings as a failed magic student and an eccentric engineer/inventor. After her failure in university in Canterlot, she returned to her home city of Manehattan with at least one magical talent, hyperprecise telekinesis that augmented her innovative mind as she joined the rapidly growing industrial revolution, and by 1007, she was the head of a rapidly growing industrial company with technological research at its heart. During the Lunar Civil War, she entered the political scene with a staunch progressive platform focused on scientific progress, redefining the government by democratic principles, and advocated for the disempowerment of the old hereditary elite."
POLITICS_ETERNAL_DESC:0 "Hailing from the wide, warm open plains of southwest Equestria, Maxos Eternal was part of the last generations of rural frontierspony and later a successful landowning rancher. He was a stallion who cared very much about his fellow equine and looked to make his mark helping others, becoming a key figure in maintaining the Equestrian food supply and overall rationing system when the Lunar Civil War broke out. He naturally became part of the political scene in the wake of the democratic movement after the civil war due to his popularity and reputation for fairness, joining the movement on a platform of simply hearing out his fellow ponies and acting on their wishes."
POLITICS_LEAD_DESC:0 "Ledd Metal was an established blacksmith within the traditional medieval guild system of Equestria when the Equestrian Industrial Revolution came full swing in the 980s, he became caught up in the winds of change as many guilds and craftsponies gave way to unskilled labor and unions. Disgruntled by the waves of change, avoiding the draft during the Lunar Civil War as a skilled metalworker, and seeing his fellow ponies striving to determine their own fates, he pulled together the support of the remaining old guilds, he joined the political scene on the platform to preserve the old harmonic order with the new methods of democracy."
POLITICS_SPARK_DESC:0 "Ember Spark was a veteran Pegasus trooper and one of the most decorated enlisted soldiers in the Equestrian Army, having joined as soon as he was eligible in 997. He proved to be a capable and fair leader who turned down promotions to an officer several times. At the behest of many of his fellows in the army, he reluctantly joined the rising democratic movement during an R&R period during the Lunar Civil War. Once it had ended, with the support of his many brothers and sisters in arms, he took up a platform focused on the defense of future peace and harmony in this new, changed Equestria."

POLITICS_NIGHTMAREMOON_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography§!: Myths and fables tell of two regal sisters who ruled together, creating harmony for all the land. The eldest used her alicorn powers to raise the sun at dawn; the younger brought out the moon to begin the night. While it is obvious today that the tales speak of the Royal Pony Sisters who rule Equestria, few, if any concrete facts are known about their history.\n\nHowever, the one legend imprinted in everypony's mind speak of a dark nightmare who attempted to overthrow the fair Princess of the Sun, driven by her jealousy and hatred. They clashed in the old Castle of the Two Sisters, and their battle left the proud edifice desolate and ruined. Afterward, the entity calling herself Nightmare Moon was banished, soon forgotten except in cautionary foal stories.\n\nIn what would be shown as a rude awakening, the Nightmare returned after a millennium in exile to bring once more eternal night and despair; but she was defeated by a group of six mares who wielded the legendary Elements of Harmony, revealing the long lost sister of Princess Celestia, Luna. Although Luna tried to reintegrate in the modern world, the strain of leadership, combined with the injustice towards thestrals, have let loose her old grudges and allowed the darkness to take hold again. Now she rules with an iron hoof, yet abandoning some of her more extreme stances in favour of cold, calculating measures.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

## Changeling ##
# Leaders #

POLITICS_CHRYSALIS_DESC:0  "Ruler and despot of the Changeling Hives, Queen Chrysalis was the first of her race to unite them under one banner. From her hatching in 930, she has proven to be an exceptional individual. Being the only child of the dead Queen of Vesalipolis, she was raised with extreme care and given best possible education, which made her spoiled and arrogant, but also intelligent, determined and firm. She was crowned in 945 and fended off an attack from Vraks with her army. Soon after, the Vesalipolis-Ditrysium axis was formed, and it would be the embryo for united Changeling Lands.\n\nUnder her leadership, other hive queens either joined her voluntarily or were forced into submission. She became the sole absolute ruler of her species in 988, but her ambitions only continued to grow. She plotted to coup and invade Equestria, and executed her plans in 1002. Chrysalis herself replaced Princess Cadence and had fooled nearly everyone, and had even bested Princess Celestia. It was by mere fluke that her victory was snatched away from her grasp and her people banished to the frozen North. Clearly infiltration alone is not enough to reclaim what is rightfully hers, and Chrysalis recognises the need of a powerful and modern military. Any opposition and protest to her despotic reign is swiftly crushed as she prepares to redeem her honour, or die trying."

POLITICS_CRIMSON_DESC:0 "On the mountain, Crimson "Ruby" Hayden has watched as Dragons fought over wealth, distrscted by materialism. From early fights and violence between her kind being observed by her, she began to grow a hatred to the Dynasty. After a visit to Stalliongrad, her thoughts began to radicalize, forming the DFCP in 1007 with nationalist, Communist principles. Haydenism is now a popular thought contrast to traditional dragon thought."

POLITICS_PWELLINGTON_DESC:0 "Paw Wellington had emerged as the despot of the fractured polar communities in 1002. Under his reign, the polar bears have finally organized into a civil society. He is remarked as being firm but fair, willing to share the fish and having soft paws. Since his rise to power, the bears have seen rather decent success."

POLITICS_PRINCERUTHERFORD_DESC:0 "Beyond the Crystal Mountains, Prince Rutherford leads a proud nation of Yaks. Prince Rutherford is the disputed ruler of the traditionally isolationist Yaks, and has only recently begun to enter the global scene. This entry resulted in a nearly disastrous diplomatic event, which almost brought the underdeveloped nation of Yakyakistan into a war with Equestria. Luckily, Pinkie Pie - Equestria's own Element of Laughter - was able to step in and prevent the situation from spiralling out of control. Since the incident, Prince Rutherford has become committed to bringing his kingdom out of its current dark ages, and into an age of prosperity. Rutherford is willing to do just about anything for his people, provided it does not come at the expense of the Yaks' pride."

## Jakistan ##

POLITICS_PRINCEBRADFORD_DESC:0 "To the East of the internationally recognized country of Yakyakistan, Prince Bradford holds claim over a clan of Yaks whom call themselves the 'Jaki-Clan.' A long-time rival of his brother, Prince Rutherford of Yakyakistan, Bradford simply wishes for his Yaks - or Jaks, depending on who you ask - to be left alone. Unfortunately for Bradford, with tensions rising with the Changelings to the West, the griffons to the East, and Prince Rutherford practically breathing down its neck, the Jaki-Clan finds itself in a precarious position."

POLITICS_CADENZA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 14th of February 972, near Vanhoover\n\n§YBiography§!: Princess Cadance's humble origins belie her future as one of the royal alicorns of Equestria. The pegasus foal, who would later become known as Princess Mi Amore Cadenza, was found in a forest close to Vanhoover by her earth pony adopted parents. Taken to a nearby village, it was a peaceful, calm life until one day, a jealous sorceress named Prismia stole the love of the villagers using a malevolent magical necklace. The young Cadance confronted Prismia and turned her own magic against her, causing her to change her horrible ways. Afterward, Princess Celestia recognised her power, adopted her as her niece and elevated Cadance as the alicorn Princess of Love.\n\nThereafter, Cadance became a foalsitter for Princess Celestia's newest personal student, Twilight Sparkle. She would meet and fall in love with Twilight's older brother, Shining Armour. Their wedding day was going to be perfect, but unfortunately, the scheming Chrysalis, Queen of the Changelings used the opportunity to impersonate Cadance and seize control of Equestria by guile. Despite the presence of a large changeling host and their empowered Queen, Princess Cadance and Shining Armour used the power of their love to cast the changelings out of the country.\n\nWhen the Crystal Empire reappeared, Celestia sent Cadance to rule over it, knowing her to be a descendant of Princess Amore, its last ruler before Sombra's reign. Cadance made her stand there, defeating the nascent shadow of King Sombra that lingered after his banishment by using a mythical artefact called the Crystal Heart. With their success, she and Shining Armour have safekept the land ever since, siring a foal named Flurry Heart along the way.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
POLITICS_SOMBRA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography§!: Sombra's origins are as mysterious as the mere mention of his name is unsettling. What is known, however, comes from the testimony of crystal ponies who were willing enough to speak. He is one of the umbrum — shadow ponies rumoured to be buried under the frozen wastelands of the Crystal Empire, waiting to be released. Some say it was loneliness and dejection that turned him bitter and jaded, striking out against Princess Amore, while others say that it was his only friend and companion, Radiant Hope, who turned Sombra to darkness.\n\nWhat followed is known to everypony: the tyrannical King Sombra used dark magic of the umbrum to enslave the crystal ponies, using many for his personal experiments. His reign of terror only came to an end once the Princesses of Equestria banished him beneath the ice, only for Sombra to curse his land to disappear along with him. After a thousand years, his shadowy form made an attempt to take over again, only to be thwarted by the combined efforts of Princess Cadance and the bearers of the Elements of Harmony.\n\nIt is uncertain whether the most recent reincarnation of King Sombra is the same pony from the myths, but one thing is sure: The King is back.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

## Strawberry ##
# Leaders #
POLITICS_EAGLECLAW_DESC:0 "Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw of the Strawberry Duchy is the cousin of Grover V, the Griffonian Emperor and is a griffon who holds vast tracts of land and large amounts of wealth. Were Grover to pass away, she would be a prime candidate to become regent and certainly feels that she would be the only one suitable!\n\nShe is a staunch supporter of the nobility and she will try to uphold the balance between the nobles, religion and the people. She does truly care for her people though, and wants to see them prosper above all else; she even has plans for some minor reforms in the pipeline!\n\nWhile she is no stranger to the life as a noble, ruling her own Duchy would be nothing compared to ruling an entire empire and she might find herself part of a larger power-struggle, tearing the empire apart."
PRINCESS_DARA_DESC:0 "Priestess Dara is worshipped as a demigod and the leader of the tribal union. Most of decisionmaking however is carried out by her mentors, that often act in their selfish interests."

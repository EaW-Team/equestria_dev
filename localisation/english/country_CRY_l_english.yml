CRY_dawn_on_crystal_empire_desc:0 "Last year's reforms went well: poverty and illiteracy continue to drop as the crystal ponies come to acclimate to their new lives, free of Sombra's tyranny at last. Industrialization continues apace with Equestria's help. Flurry Heart turned two years old, and Shining and Cadance are very happy together. We can only hope 1007 will be as good to us!"
CRY_the_way_of_harmony:0 "The Way Of Harmony"
CRY_the_way_of_harmony_desc:0 "##TODO, the Empire has had quite the conturbed and traumatic history, but, thankfully, help finally arrived to those living in these lands, with none of it being possible if it were not for harmony and the royal family. We simply must continue down this path, specially considering our recent reforms have already been greatly welcomed."
CRY_equestrian_tutelage:0 "Equestrian Tutelage"
CRY_equestrian_tutelage_desc:0 "##TODO, as much as the Crystal Empire has recovered ever since its return we are still missing the last few pushes in order to fully modernize this nation. To achieve this goal we simply need to work with Equestria, as they have the tools and resources necessary to fill the gaps in our capabilities."
CRY_crystal_bit:0 "Create The Crystal Bit"
CRY_crystal_bit_desc:0 "##TODO, if the Crystal Empire is ever to stand on its own we need to come up with our own currency, else who knows how our nation and economy would react if one day Equestria goes to the way of darkness?"
CRY_adopt_the_equestrian_bit:0 "Adopt The Equestrian Bit"
CRY_adopt_the_equestrian_bit_desc:0 "##TODO, trying to go it alone in something as important as our currency is not a good idea, we need to officially adopt the bit in order to make trade more seamless between our great nations, no need to shake the boat."
CRY_the_crystal_bank:0 "The Crystal Bank"

CRY_expand_our_agricultural_sector:0 "Tend To Our Agricultural Sector"
CRY_expand_our_agricultural_sector_desc:0 "##TODO, the Crystal Empire might not be known for its farms, but that doesn't mean we don't have the ability to further grow our own food. Some areas of the Empire are perfectly good for cultivation, and those that aren't can be made into something useful by our great pegasi."
CRY_increase_imports:0 "Increase Imports"
CRY_increase_imports_desc:0 "##TODO, we produce enough food to feed our current population, but as our Empire thrives it is obvious that our population will grow. With that in mind we should go with the safe option, that being to import more food from Equestria just in case."
CRY_entice_outsiders:0 "Attract Outsiders"
CRY_entice_outsiders_desc:0 "##TODO, with our expanded food base it wouldn't be hard to accomodate more creatures into our Empire. We should offer potential immigrants with cheaper housing and temporary benefits to convince them to come over."

CRY_on_our_own_hooves_desc:0 "##TODO, as much as we appreciate Equestria's help there is still a need for the Crystal Empire to truly stand on its own legs if we are to be respected as a legitimate sovereign nation. We will still ask our Equestrian allies for help, but we must also focus on developing ways to advance by ourselves."
CRY_multipolar_concept:0 "Multipolar Concept"
CRY_multipolar_concept_desc:0 "##TODO, The Crystal City is certainly the shining jewel of the Empire, but that does not mean we shouldn't make an effort to develop other sizeable communities around our realm.

CRY_develop_mi_amore_desc:0 "##TODO, Mi Amore lies in a spot that makes it perfect for development, if we were to help expand the city there is a possibility that in the far future it becomes as great as Cristal City itself due to the general proximity.

CRY_winter_solstice:0 "Winter Solstice"
CRY_winter_solstice_desc:0 "Having failed to host an official celebration of the Winter Solstice the year prior, it would please our people if we hold a bigger festival this year. Let's host the greatest Winter Solstice celebration that the Empire has ever seen!"
CRY_crystalling_anniversary:0 "Crystalling Anniversary"
CRY_crystalling_anniversary_desc:0 "Our people hold a soft spot for Princess Cadance's family, and her daughter, Flurry Heart, is no exception. A public celebration of Flurry's birthday will doubtlessly draw large crowds and invaluable support."

CRY_world_metropolis:0 "World Metropolis"

CRY_research_effort_desc:0 "##TODO, the only way to liberation of the old is with education and research, we must further fund our research institutes to make sure we can stand up against other powers in Equus."
CRY_equestrian_military_staff:0 "Equestrian Military Staff"

CRY_with_our_own_ponies_desc:0 "##TODO, if we wish to be taken seriously as a real nation we cannot rely on Equestrian help for everything, specially not when it comes to our own defence. We need to create an army with our own doctrines and tactics, one completely and genuinely ours."

CRY_combat_the_dark_spectre_desc:0 "##TODO, the crystal ponies still haven't forgotten about Sombra, and how could they? It was truly a horrible period to experience, but it is now time to combat this fear and any pony that might wish to bring this monster back."

CRY_volunteers_desc:0 "##TODO, even if we are strongly against direct intervention we should still think of the possibility of helping nations around the globe in their struggles, even if it means just sending a few volunteers and some loose pieces of equipment.

CRY_crystal_guard:0 "Expand The Crystal Guard"

CRY_crystal_canterlot_railway_desc:0 "When our nation returned, a rail line was constructed linking the Crystal City and Canterlot. As useful as this original line is, we can no longer get around the fact that relying on a single piece of track to transport millions of tons of goods and services every day is economic insanity. Roadways can never efficiently pick up this much slack, a new and larger rail network needs to be built."

CRY_under_their_wing_desc:0 "##TODO, we are going to break free gradually, slowly phasing out our dependence."
CRY_referendum:0 "#TODO BREAK FREE NOW"
CRY_referendum_desc:0 "##TODO, Equestria has been a great friend to us, but this does not mean we should forever be their vassal, or at least that's how a lot of ponies in the Crystal Empire are starting to see it as. A referendum shall be held to put this concern to bed." # TODO PODRICK REWRITE THIS
CRY_mi_amore_forever:0 "Mi Amore Forever"
CRY_mi_amore_forever_desc:0 "House Amore has proven itself time and time again. There is no longer a shred of doubt in the hearts of anyone that [Root.GetLeader] is the right monarch for the job. Indeed, they've become so popular that pollsters have been encouraged to stop asking people about the subject to prevent the appearance of tyranny or rigging. It's time we do something else to show our great love and affection for House Amore."
CRY_greater_economic_ties:0 "Greater Economic Ties"
CRY_greater_economic_ties_desc:0 "Since it is clear that Equestria's future is our future it must also be clear that our Crystalline ponies really love Equestrian stuff. From rifles to rototillers, we can't get enough of that sweet Equestrian merchandise. We should allow more Equestrian companies to invest in the Crystal Empire to cut down on shipping costs and further integrate our nations."
CRY_a_statement:0 "A Statement"
CRY_a_statement_desc:0 "##TODO, now that we are free to determine our own foreign policy we should begin to look for nations who may be greatly abusing their own citizens, it is time to take the fight to them for once."

CRY_prioritize_our_industry_desc:0 "##TODO, even if it might hurt us on the short term we cannot allow ourselves to become some kind of Equestrian economic zone, we must have industries of our own."
CRY_the_fifth_race:0 "The Fifth Tribe"
CRY_the_fifth_race_desc:0 "##TODO, the ponies of the Crystal Empire are unique in their own right, just as the tribes of Equestria are different from on another, it is time we start considering them a different and valid pony race."
CRY_a_part_of_something_greater:0 "A Part Of Something Greater"
CRY_a_part_of_something_greater_desc:0 "##TODO, the ponies of the Crystal Empire might look different, but functionally they're just an extension of already existing pony tribes, one must come to realize this reality."

CRY_the_riverside_industry_desc:0 "##TODO, the Crystal Empire isn't really known for its fish, and that is to be expected with most rivers of the nation being frozen, but with the return of the Heart and warmer climates in the south we could finally dig into this industry."

 # Sombra #
 CRY_the_king_of_monsters:0 "The King of Monsters"
 CRY_the_king_of_monsters_desc:0 ""At long last, I have returned. The Crystal Empire is mine, but I am not content with merely one realm - it is only right that I should rule over all nations. But there is much to do; my might and magic are no longer enough to conquer them. I shall have to assemble a royal court to assist me in this matter. With proper plans in place, I will not be overthrown a third time.""
 CRY_a_thousand_years_passed:0 "A Thousand Years Passed"
 CRY_a_thousand_years_passed_desc:0 ""A thousand years. It is hard to grasp. The very language has changed, with new words and new meanings for old words. Industrialization, socialism, logistics, tanks, planes... I know I have much to learn. But I will not dawdle. The world does not wait even for a King.""
 CRY_speed_tactics:0 "Maneuver Tactics"
 CRY_speed_tactics_desc:0 ""I have always known that war is won not by they who have the greatest might, but by they who seize the most valuable targets. What good would all their power have done Celestia and Luna if I had captured Canterlot and stood ready to slaughter their subjects? Surely they would have negotiated instead. That much has not changed, and I will use these 'trucks' to capture that which my enemies hold dear.""
 CRY_armored_recovery_vehicles:0 "The Best of Both Worlds"
 CRY_armored_recovery_vehicles_desc:0 ""With the emergence of both tanks and motorized infantry, I was naturally interested in combining them. Thus emerged what my scientists have dubbed the 'Infantry Fighting Vehicle'. It is still in its infancy but I trust this will someday be the backbone of the army.""
 CRY_armor_wonderweapons:0 "The Wonder of Armor"
 CRY_armor_wonderweapons_desc:0 ""Hah! These 'tanks' are majestic. Armored against attack, wielding weapons that would have taken a dozen archmages to match the power of, and swifter than a pegasus in flight. You will construct many of these iron monsters. Do not disappoint me.""
 CRY_big_guns_som:0 "Massive Cannons"
 CRY_big_guns_som_desc:0 ""Shortly before my banishment, a captured Equestrian tinkerer described what she called the 'cannon'. I had never had a chance to try it before the alicorns deposed me--until now. What a spectacular beast! Able to rain death on those leagues away, it will no doubt prove a force multiplier for my army.""
 CRY_the_common_soldier:0 "The Meat Grinder's Meat"
 CRY_the_common_soldier_desc:0 ""Some things have changed, but some never do. The simple infantry continues to be a core component of the army, guarding the more advanced equipment and pinning the enemy down. They may wield rifles instead of spears and pack shovels instead of shields, but I feel most at home here.""
 CRY_the_non_combat_tools:0 "More than Bullets"
 CRY_the_non_combat_tools_desc:0 ""When one of my advisors informed me of 'combat service support', I nearly enslaved him on the spot. Signals? Hospitals? Engineering? It is absurd that an army would need such baubles. But it seems in this modern age, such luxuries are universal and universally considered valuable. So be it.""
 CRY_conquer_the_skies:0 "Conquer the Skies"
 CRY_conquer_the_skies_desc:0 ""Great pegasi of metal--they tell me it is not iron, but another metal I have never heard of--now fly above us. While my magic can easily rip them from the sky, I can't be everywhere at once, and they are quite annoying. Thus I have reluctantly authorized the creation of so-called 'fighters' to guard my rightful sky.""
 CRY_rain_death_upon_them:0 "Rain Death Upon Them"
 CRY_rain_death_upon_them_desc:0 ""With the sky now mine, a beautiful new era can begin: an era of aerial bombardment. Before my banishment I experimented with pegasi dropping heavy stones on my foes. But this is far more efficient.""
 CRY_air_interdiction:0 "Raids of Terror"
 CRY_air_interdiction_desc:0 ""A larger bomber, carrying a heavier payload, would be able to strike deep behind enemy lines and crush their supply depots. With no food, what soldier could hold out? See that this is developed.""
 CRY_oceanic_ambitions:0 "Crossing the Grand Oceans"
 CRY_oceanic_ambitions_desc:0 ""At last, I have reached the seas. This represents potential, but also danger. An enemy could strike me where I was not expecting it. So I will do unto them as they would do unto me, and do it first.""
 CRY_or_a_day_for_them:0 "A Day for Them"
 CRY_or_a_day_for_them_desc:0 ""My subjects have not changed much - perhaps because I took them with me. But their protests and moaning have new terminology, 'creature rights' foremost among their demands. Creature rights. What an amusing concept. They speak of rights? There is only one right that matters--the right of strength.""
 CRY_the_genius_that_is_me:0 "An Evil Genius"
 CRY_the_genius_that_is_me_desc:0 ""Genius? Yes... I like that descriptor. I am among the mightiest mages ever to have lived, and I am already using that power to its fullest extent. But it is not enough. I will learn everything about everything, and in doing so master it all.""
 CRY_scientist_clique:0 "Research for Freedom"
 CRY_scientist_clique_desc:0 ""Many among my subjects are talented scholars, administrators, and tacticians in their own right. I will permit them and their families freedom, and even slaves of their own, in exchange for service. A resurrection of the old system of nobility under Amore, in a way, but redesigned to serve me. Fitting.""
 CRY_unchained_ambition:0 "Unchained Ambition"
 CRY_unchained_ambition_desc:0 ""Let me be clear: this world is mine. Not because of my parents' lineage, nor my species. It is mine because I want it and am strong enough to seize it! I will break all that stand against me, and force the rest to kneel. Nothing will stand in my way.""
 CRY_but_my_enemies_have_not_rested:0 "My Enemies Have Not Rested"
 CRY_but_my_enemies_have_not_rested_desc:0 ""Celestia. Luna. Chrysalis. [STG.GetLeader]. Some names I know all too well, others I have only just heard of. They are united in one thing, however. They all want my head on a pike. And if there is a truly absolute law in our world of chaos and misery, it is this: do unto others as they would do unto you and do it first.""

 newcrystals.1.t:0 "Family Time"
 newcrystals.1.d:0 "The new year had barely begun. There was a kind of taste in the air most associated with potential. Everycreature knew that with the new year came new hope. Wishes, resolutions, aspirations. And everycreature knew, of course, that most didn't see fruition. But even still, wasn't it such a pretty thing to hope? That was what it meant to be a crystal pony, Cadance thought, to love and hope without reservation. No matter what. If Shining Armor had resolved to defend what he loved, Cadence had resolved to nurture a healthy future for what she loved. Whom she loved.\n\nFlurry Heart played around in the indoor royal gardens, picking flowers to make a crown for the three of them. It was much too cold for the outdoor gardens to hold much in the way of workable plantstuffs, but here, within the castle's warmth, warmth of the heart could also be shared. The royal couple sat on a bench, more than happy to let their child play around with their manes, even if it meant getting a few stems stuck in there. They all giggled along. Merriment was in abundance for the family, especially around this time of the year.\n\nWhat was harmony? Cadance bounced the question around in her head. As stalwart in being its protector she was, the concept was sometimes remarkably difficult to define. There were ideals of cohesion and stability as ideological foundations, but figuring out what that really meant concretely was an entirely different matter. Was harmony peace? No, it couldn't be. After all, harmony meant having to fight sometimes. To the bitter end, if necessary. What, then, was harmony? As Cadance looked at her little filly playing around, the answer to her question hit her right in the face. Harmony was to love those around oneself, fully and unequivocally. If harmony was anything, it was this. Happiness with her family."
 newcrystals.1.a:0 "To another thousand years, may love prosper evermore!"

 newcrystals.2.t:0 "A Fifth Tribe"
 newcrystals.2.d:0 "#TODO: Crystal Ponies are officially declared a fifth tribe of ponykind! Yay!"
 newcrystals.2.a:0 "Woohoo!"

 newcrystals.3.t:0 "The Changeling Exiles"
 newcrystals.3.d:0 "#TODO: Shining Armor meets with some exiled changeling harmonists, maybe even Thorax himself. He reassures them that nopony is bigoted against them simply because of their species, and they're safe here in the Crystal Empire."
 newcrystals.3.a:0 "Together to stop Chrysalis."

 newcrystals.4.t:0 "The Referendum" # TODO REWRITE 
 newcrystals.4.d:0 "#TODO: A referendum is held to decide the fate of the Crystal Empire. In a steep majority, they reject remaining a puppet. Cadance is surprised, but promises to honor the results and draft their independence request to Equestria."
 newcrystals.4.a:0 "Now we wait."

 newcrystals.5.t:0 "How Far We've Come" # we had a referendum
 newcrystals.5.d:0 "#TODO: Cadance reflects on the fate of the Crystal Empire, now standing on its own as a fully free nation. It feels good. The referendum passed, but Equestria will always be their friend. She spends time with her husband, happily together, before writing to Celestia."
 newcrystals.5.a:0 "Dear Princess Celestia..."

 newcrystals.6.t:0 "How Far We've Come" # we didn't have a referendum
 newcrystals.6.d:0 "#TODO: Cadance reflects on the fate of the Crystal Empire, now standing on its own as a fully free nation. It feels good. Despite maintaining close ties, Equestria chose to recognize them as free simply because of all their great contributions. She spends time with her husband, happily together, before writing to Celestia."
 newcrystals.6.a:0 "Dear Princess Celestia..."

 newcrystals.7.t:0 "Party Planning"
 newcrystals.7.d:0 "##TODO, event where Cadance is speaking to Shining Armour about he helping to supervise and coordinate a few events she is setting up, namely stuff like the Northern Gala and the Crystalling, specially that latter one since he kinda needs to be there in the first place. Shining makes a joking comment about how much he wished Pinkie Pie was here to help them, which Cadance chuckles at."
 newcrystals.7.a:0 "Let's get these parties started."

 newcrystals.8.t:0 "Millenary Issues"
 newcrystals.8.d:0 "##TODO, event with Cadance, Shining Armour, and Sunburst. Sunburst explains a few of the issues still haunting the Crystal Empire, mostly stuff related to how modernization isn't quite there yet for areas of the empire from what he has seen. Meanwhile Shining reports on how the army could use some reforms and how there still plenty of training to do to get these crystal ponies into shape for any possible future war. Cadance simply listens to both as she takes the information in."
 newcrystals.8.a:0 "We can do this."

 newcrystals.9.t:0 "Getting Them Into Shape"
 newcrystals.9.d:0 "##TODO, even with Shining Armour where he meets with the newest rookies of the Crystal Guard after the most recent expansion to the force, he is cordial and friendly but is quick to correct them once they start acting too out of line due to thinking they could take advantage of his friendliness."
 newcrystals.9.a:0 "Here we're not friends."

 newcrystals.10.t:0 "An Offer From The Crystal Empire"
 newcrystals.10.d:0 "##TODO (GENERIC POV), representatives from the Crystal Empire have approached our administrations seeing if we would be interested in purchasing some crystals."

 newcrystals.12.d:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] rejected our crystal trade offer."
 newcrystals.12.a:0 "It's over."


 newcrystals.13.t:0 "Rumors of Suspicious Activity"
 newcrystals.13.d:0 "Shining Armor furrowed his brow as he read the report before him: "Local pony says neighbors are plotting something. Claims to have heard them say something about King Sombra." He sighed. The Crystal City police have investigated dozens of reports about this by now, though all have led to nothing. He wanted to chalk this up to paranoia, and yet...\n\nShining put a hoof to his temple. He had resigned from the Equestrian Royal Guard to avoid headaches like these, especially since the job had required him to spend so much time away from his wife and daughter, yet those same headaches were now popping up left and right here. Was regular old paranoia really something he needed to worry about, though? \n\nHe took the report and cross-examined it with others he had gotten over the weeks, looking for any details that might indicate that there was something more going on. The Crystal Empire was his home now, and he needed to be vigilant to protect it. If nothing else, confirming that these were just rumors would quell his worries.\n\nJust as he was about ready to dismiss this report, he noticed something: a matching description between two separate reports. Both described a 'pale amethyst crystal unicorn' as a suspicious individual.\n\nShining felt a pit in his stomach as he envisioned the idea of normal, ordinary ponies trying to bring about the return of King Sombra. The same king who had enslaved them all and cursed this land for a millennium. Surely, this had to be a coincidence, right? He bit his tongue as he tried to weigh the merit of looking into this. He didn't want to waste more time looking for something that wasn't there. After all, it was about time to head to the park with Cadance and Flurry Heart, and he didn't want to worry them.\n\nHe reached for the phone and considered what to tell his subordinate to relay to the Crystal City police."
 newcrystals.13.a:0 "Keep an eye out for ponies causing trouble, but this isn't a top priority."
 newcrystals.13.b:0 "We're not taking any chances. Launch a full investigation immediately."

 newcrystals.14.t:0 "Planning The Celebration"
 newcrystals.14.d:0 "##TODO, event about Cadance preparing the nation for the Winter Solstice, which will happen later that year, perhaps she could be asking Shining and Spike for help to set up everything that is necessary for the event in time."
 newcrystals.14.a:0 "We still have time."
 
 newcrystals.15.t:0 "The Winter Solstice Celebration"
 newcrystals.15.d2:0 "##TODO, event where the Winter Solstice is happening, but so is the Equestrian Civil War! Oh no."
 newcrystals.15.d2:0 "##TODO, event where the Winter Solstice is happening, could have a wholesome scene between Shining and Cadance where the former is comforting her due to how stressful it has been to be the ruling princess of the Crystal Empire. But in the end she says she wouldn't trade it for the world, and that she is certain to continue making this realm better."
 newcrystals.15.a:0 "A great Solstice."

 newcrystals.16.t:0 "The Northern Gala"
 newcrystals.16.d:0 "##TODO, event where the Northern Gala is being held, the attendance is much greater than expected, but obviously this isn't a bad thing, seems like the Crystal Empire will have a great year."

 newcrystals.19.a:0 "Woohoo."


 crystalsombra.1.t:0 "Your Story - A Peculiar Pony"
 crystalsombra.1.d:0 "Your arrival in Crystal City occurred without celebration, thankfully. You were never one for parties, though your friends and family had insisted on giving you a "going away" cake. They had all wished you good luck with your new job at Star Energy, an Equestrian electrical company. Bringing the Crystal Empire's ancient society up to speed with modern technology was an ever-ongoing process—one that you were excited to help with.\n\nYour job was set to begin next week, so you had some time to kill. There was a small souvenir shop near your apartment that had caught your eye, so you figured you could peruse its wares in hopes of finding something to help decorate your rather sparse living space.\n\nUpon entering the store, you were greeted by an overwhelming multitude of crystal-themed trinkets and baubles. It was hard to pick out something to direct your eyes to, especially since the antique building had not yet been wired for electrical lighting. The overhead lanterns were hardly sufficient to determine what anything was from afar, though one thing did catch your eye: a painting on the wall. You approached it, noticing that it depicted the defeat of the evil King Sombra by Princess Cadance and Spike "the Brave and Glorious."\n\n"It's sad, isn't it?" The feminine voice, though soft, caught you off guard enough to jump slightly. You turned to see a rather pretty crystal pony also looking at the painting. You asked if she was the shopkeeper. She nodded and introduced herself as Cherry Bluebell. You then asked her why the painting was sad.\n\nHer expression was somber. "A long time ago, the pony who would become the cruel monster in that painting was just a scared little colt. He didn't want to be evil, though forces outside of his control made him that way. But there was still good in him, locked deep away."\n\nYou tell Cherry that this sounded preposterous. If he was good on the inside, then why did the crystal heart destroy him? Good ponies don't die like that.\n\nHer smile was kind, though her eyes were filled with sadness. "He was too far gone, but..." She looked away and bit her tongue, then returned her gaze to yours, "...there might still be hope. Here," She placed a small card into your hoof. "If you want to learn about the true story of Sombra from the pony who knew him best, then come to this meeting in a few days.""
 crystalsombra.1.a:0 "You decide to attend the meeting."
 crystalsombra.1.b:0 "You decide not to go. After all, Sombra is pure evil. Everypony knows this."

 crystalsombra.2.t:0 "Your Story - History Lesson"
 crystalsombra.2.d:0 "#TODO: You arrive at the book club. It's mostly younger ponies, including the pony who brought you here, but a few older ones are present. A heavily cloaked pony sits in the corner. Just as you reflect on how weird this all is, she speaks up. She introduces herself as Radiant Hope, and she says that she knew Sombra when he was a foal, that they grew up together. That there was always good in him, and he didn't have to become such a tyrant. That she tried to save him, but couldn't, and foolishly reported his actions to the alicorn sisters, who banished him for a thousand years. She spent those thousand years with fairy-ponies called Umbrum, where she didn't age a day. When he returned a few years ago, she left the fairy realm. But she missed her chance to save him, and he was killed by Cadance and Shining Armor."
 crystalsombra.2.a:0 "Huh..."

 crystalsombra.3.t:0 "Future Perfect"
 crystalsombra.3.d:0 "#TODO: Now, Radiant says that it's still possible to resurrect him. His horn was lost, but not destroyed, and as long as it exists, he can be brought back. But she needs our help. She's presumed dead by the world, and that's critical to her safety. But she absolutely wants to save his spirit. To bring the good that's inside him out. As the meeting wraps up, she looks at you personally and says that she just wants to give him one more chance. You head home, and think about what to do."
 crystalsombra.3.a:0 "Maybe she's right. He deserves a chance, right?"
 crystalsombra.3.b:0 "These ponies are crazy! I have to report them!"

 crystalsombra.4.t:0 "Magic Research"

 crystalsombra.16.a:0 ""Soon, we'll know for sure.""

 crystalsombra.17.t:0 "The Battle of the Crystal Palace"
 crystalsombra.17.d:0 "It was like a deluge. Pure, unadulterated power. The Royal Guard fired their weapons at the shadowy mass pouring through them, but each and every little wound they inflicted immediately disappeared. A pony stood behind the magical power, focusing all of her magic onto him. She whispered apologies beneath her breath to nobody. Her tears were not consequential to anyone present. Each snapshot of consciousness echoed against another pony dead. One after another, the guards fell to the magic of the King.\n\nHe cackled. This was his great victory. It wasn't even a real fight, no, this was a parade. He flaunted himself about, his mind-controlled followers taking their positions around the city. Every organ of government would be his. They already were, for all intents and purposes. Former life littered the ground, future fertiliser for the gardens he'd grow in his new castle. He only laughed more. It was the last sound every member of the Royal guard heard, blinking out one by one. This was a thousand years in the making, and he was going to enjoy every second of it.\n\nFor his healer, Radiant Hope, the only one to whom he'd consider granting the key to his heart, things were not so pleasant. She didn't want this. But what choice did she have? Her whispered apologies were only faintly heard by few over the commotion, and not long before their own deaths. Were it not for her actions, how else would her beloved be free? How else could justice be found? There had not been an iota of thought that her beloved would have subdued the Empire. But even now, she had to protect him, heal him, support him. She loved him. She was sorry, but she loved him so much."
 crystalsombra.17.a:0 "It wasn't long before they reached the Throne Room."

 crystalsombra.18.t:0 "Triumph I"
 crystalsombra.18.d:0 "The throne felt perfect. It wasn't just the physical sensation of comfort that bristled through Sombra's body as he sat down, but the mental relief of victory washing over him. The 'battle', whose procession had been more akin to a massacre, was over. He was the King of Monsters, the sole autocrat worthy of this power. Standing at the head of the institution that once tortured him, his will extended over the Empire.\n\nThrough his suffering, he had been tempered into the finest steel to grace all of Equus, perhaps the world itself. So stood his ego, embellished and enshrined as the psychopomp for an erstwhile harmony. The new order was here, and it wasn't going anywhere. Forever, the Empire was his. No one would hurt him ever again. Not him, not his beloved. He, as King, claimed his right as absolute sovereign. Not by the weakness of diluted bloodlines, not by the fantasy of the governed's consent, but by the authority from which all other authority derived: violence.\n\nThis was the supreme right by which he would govern. And his first act would be to cement it. The last dredges of Amore, the first of his chains he cast off, still resided in this castle. Worthless creatures. They would see his magnificence in their final moments.\n\n"Go, fetch the former royals," he barked at a castle servant.\n\nThe servant sputtered off with a contingent of guards loyal to the new monarch. It wasn't long before they returned with Mi Amore Cadenza and Shining Armor, shackled and beaten. The King of Monsters barely glanced in their direction, a wicked grin about his face. He paid no mind to the growing concern in Radiant Hope, merely metres away. No, this was his triumph. He would savour it."
 crystalsombra.18.a:0 ""Kneel," Sombra commanded."

 crystalsombra.19.t:0 "Triumph II"
 crystalsombra.19.d:0 "Both royals looked at each other. A moment stretched outwards into eternity. It was said that love connected all creatures, and in that moment it had connected both wife and husband. Without exchanging a word, novels were spoken between them. Steeling themselves, they turned forward once again. They would make their stand here. If the Empire was to be lost to tyranny, they would still defend it to its last. They would not be Sombra's slaves. Never would they kneel.\n\nThe King of Monsters was enraged by this brazen display of disobedience. The Throne was his, Imperial authority flowed from his blood alone. How dare they still defy him? They still stood against him, still spat on his dignity, as they did so long ago when he was but a clueless foal. He stood, growling in their direction as he galloped forwards.\n\n"How dare you!" he snarled. "That was an order. I will have your heads for this."\n\n"Wait!" Radiant Hope exclaimed, rushing out from the sidelines. "Sombra, this isn't you. They're beaten, they're not your enemies anymore. They don't need to die."\n\nSombra hesitated for only a moment. His hatred for their bloodline, for what they represented, flowed freely. They deserved this. Every ounce of pain they'd inflicted on him, every disgrace, would be repaid a hundredfold. He imagined the vindication, the thrill. All he needed to do was make them submit. Then, his true victory would be complete. His anger overflowed as he stepped past Radiant Hope, staring at the defiant royals. His rage was a cold one, devoid of compromise or reason.\n\n"Kneel, or I'll go get your worthless little foal and kill them in front of you," he stated."
 crystalsombra.19.a:0 "The former royals fell to their knees immediately."
 crystalsombra.19.b:0 "The former royals looked at each other, then advanced on Sombra."

 crystalsombra.20.t:0 "Triumph III"
 crystalsombra.20.d:0 "These symbols of so-called 'harmony' fell into blubbering messes so easily. Sombra grinned as they grovelled at his feet, crying out so that Flurry Heart could live. They offered a public abdication, their lives, everything they could. The new monarch only grew more manic by the moment. This was everything he had wanted and more. His triumph, his glory, his truest victory complete.\n\nEverything had fallen into place. The creatures in the city clamoured for a renaissance, a return to the glory of the golden age of the Empire. He would answer their call, not these pathetic creatures before him. In his right hoof materialised his blade. Stepping forward, each graze against the floor echoed through the room. He raised the sword, already savouring the satisfying rush to come.\n\n"SOMBRA!" Radiant Hope cried out as she ran in front of him. "It's over," she whispered, laying a hoof on him. "It's over," she repeated.\n\nHe looked between her and the royals, still grovelling, and huffed. With a herculean effort, he lowered his weapon and turned away from them. "You're right, my beloved," he said, "I've already won. There's no reason to stain the carpets here." Turning on the about, his voice raised to a shout, "GUARDS! See to it that our former royal family is imprisoned. Throw away the key," he said, walking out of the throne room towards the balcony.\n\nSo many ponies were there. The victorious, the loyal. Everycreature under his reign who accepted his truth, his rejuvenation , would find themselves rewarded. He would build an Empire for those who yearned for the glory days. His days. His right hoof raised to the sky. "THE FUTURE IS WON!" he shouted to the crowd gathered.\n\nThey cheered back, and soon, a chant emerged above all the rest."
 crystalsombra.20.a:0 ""HAIL SOMBRA, LONG LIVE THE KING!""

 crystalsombra.21.t:0 "A Death A Millennium Overdue"
 crystalsombra.21.d:0 "He had threatened their daughter. There was no doubt as to what had to be done. Maybe they weren't going to make it out of here. Maybe. But they would take the King of Monsters down one way or another. For the Empire. For their daughter. Mi Amore Cadenza and her husband Shining Armor stepped forward. Cadance knew that the power of an alicorn was no small thing. With their powers combined, they would vanish this darkness. As their horns began to glow, magic melded and intermixed.\n\nThe science of magic was a difficult thing to understand. Thaumaturgical research in the sense of the modern scientific method was, in truth, in its infancy. But in the oral traditions of the Empire, love itself was often considered magical. There was something inherently ineffable about the experience of adoration, not simply of another creature, but of one's community, friends, life itself even. There was power in that love; the kind that could vanquish the strongest hatred. In that maxim did the lovers' faith lie.\n\nGuards moved inwards, weapons drawn. But they would make little impact. As they closed in on the pair, even as some raised their weapons to fire, it all happened so fast. The King's lover, too, stepped forward. What little warning there was came to an abrupt end as quickly as it came, only a few seconds having passed between the first steps and the glow coalescing, ready to seek its quarry.\n\nOne, singular beam crackled outwards. A shockwave hit the room as the sound barrier was demolished by the photonic volley. It searched for its target, the King of Monsters, the life which it would render asunder. And it found life. Eviscerated it. That life had been Radiant Hope, who had stepped in front of her lover to protect him.\n\nShe fell to the ground, scarlet spreading across the floor."
 crystalsombra.21.a:0 "The King of Monsters dropped to his knees. "HEALER! GUARDS, GET A HEALER!""

 crystalsombra.22.t:0 "Justice"
 crystalsombra.22.d:0 "His hooves rushing to hold her, to cradle her, Sombra sputtered and choked out words in-between sobs. "Radiant! Radiant, just hold on, okay? They're getting someone. They're going to help you. It's going to be alright," he said. Tears began to fall onto her.\n\n"Sombra...?" Radiant Hope creaked out. She was barely able to speak; life drained quickly from her. "You're okay? That's— that's good…!"\n\n"I'm okay, you saved me! You did, my love. And I'm going to save you too, so just hang on. Please, just a little longer."\n\n"No, no. It's..." she trailed off, limply falling against his hold, "It's okay. I helped. I helped. I love..." she smiled. It was the last thing she said. Her last breath left her.\n\nThere was nothing Sombra could do. He was a destroyer, a warrior, not a healer. She had been the healer. She was the one who had put him back together. She had been someone worth fighting for. If love was magical, she had been his source. The room was still, nobody moved, nobody dared to. Finally, Sombra snapped upwards, his gaze locked on the former royal couple.\n\n"You killed her!" Sombra screamed. His stocky, stilted phonemes sloughed off of his vocal cords with little enthusiasm. They could barely leave him between his tears.\n\n"I didn't mean to!" Cadance insisted. "It was you! We were going to kill you!"\n\n"SHUT UP!" he shouted back.

"I do enjoy a good view," he mused, "It makes it all the better that everything I behold belongs to me."\n\n"Yes, it does." Sombra instantly recognized the voice as Radiant Hope's. She joined him to look over the brilliant city. Sombra noted that she wasn't smiling - she hadn't smiled much lately.\n\n"Why do you look out there, Hope? It only seems to upset you."\n\nHope didn't meet his eyes. "I heard that you had executed a particularly troublesome rebel."\n\n"Of course," Sombra stated with a hint of surprise, "You know as well as I do that there can be no opposition to my rule. And now, there isn't."\n\n"That's good," Hope deadpanned, "So now we've won, right? We can live here happily together?"\n\n"Well, not quite yet. We need to expand the empire, so at some point, we will make plans to attack Equestria, Stalliongrad, and others who might threaten us."\n\nHope looked absolutely dejected. "Oh, so then you'll be done?"\n\nSombra turned to face her, shocked at her remarks. "Hope, this is only the beginning! Then there's the yaks and the griffons! And even beyond them, there are other threats!"\n\nThere was silence between them for some time. A tear fell down Hope's cheek as she turned to look at him. "I know you won't change your mind on your goals, but... can you promise me something?" Hope paused, trying to stifle a crying fit, "Can you promise me that you'll at least try to be better?

"The workers of Stalliongrad have officially ended all trade with the Crystal Empire, my king."\n\nKing Sombra leaned forward from his throne, confusion abundant on his face and in his voice. "What do you mean, 'the workers?' Where's their monarch, or equivalent?"\n\n"Well, um, they don't have one. Stalliongrad's authority lies with the common pony. They believe in an idea called 'communism', which means that the, ah, well, everything is owned collectively by the whole and distributed evenly to all, and that every worker has an equal say in determining how the government is run. Even their elected official is one such worker."\n\n"You mean to tell me that this nation is run by... peasants?"\n\nThe servant looked increasingly nervous as she tried to explain. "Well, their elected official represents all, even the most destitute, but basically, yes."\n\nFor a moment, Sombra stared at her, incredulous. Then, he tilted his head back and exploded with wild laughter. His body shook, and he doubled over, smashing his hoof on his throne. When he finally finished laughing, he wheezed. "'Communism'... Hah! That's new. Never, in all my years, have I heard anything so unbelievably stupid. To think that a mere peasant would be able to sit upon a throne and command other peasants around, it's hilariously insane."\n\nThe servant bit her tongue. "Well, my king, they do earnestly believe that the system works. And their ideas are... infectious, to say the least."\n\nSombra waved a hoof dismissively, still recovering from his bout of laughter. "It's obviously a ploy by whoever leads them to make their slaves believe that they have power. Anyone who seriously believes in the idea of 'communism' must be the biggest sucker in the world." He cleared his throat, having finally caught his breath, "I almost want to meet their 'elected official' and share a laugh over how they've played their underlings."\n\n"Well, um, their embassy here in Crystal City is still intact, if you want to organize a meeting."\n\n"Is that so?" Sombra grinned, imagining how this entire joke of a country would be even funnier once he confirmed his suspicions. "I'll consider it.""

She'd tried having heart-to-heart talks. She'd tried having patience. She'd even tried compromising. It was only after one crying fit at another atrocity he had committed that she had a horrible, heartbreaking realization: Sombra was, at best, placating her. He had no intention of ever truly committing to her wishes.\n\nTears streamed down Hope's eyes as all of the bottled emotions she had stuffed down surfaced at once. "I thought you cared about me! Why won't you listen to me?!"\n\nSombra sighed in frustration, then turned his full attention to her. "I do care about you, Hope, but you're making this very difficult.

This wasn't the life that she wanted, to rule others through fear and suffering. She latched onto what Sombra had just said: he cared about her. Things were so terrible right now; she no longer had a choice in what to do. There was only one option, one way that could fix everything. But deep down, she was afraid that she already knew what the outcome would be. "Sombra, this ends NOW. It's me, or your precious Crystal Empire. What do you want more?"\n\nSombra stared at the only pony that had ever cared about him for what seemed like an eternity to both of them. Eventually, he broke more than just the silence. "The Crystal Empire."\n\nSomehow, the silence that followed was even more deafening. Hope's crying gave way to full-blown despair as Sombra coldly watched her turn and run away."

The former royal couple's housekeepers had attempted to escape, but were now mind-controlled and forced to continue their work. Many of the guards had suffered a similar fate, though far more of them had died in the fighting than he would have liked.\n\nAs for the former royal couple, Sombra would have loved to make a mocking display of their corpses, but truth be told, he was not in the best mood. Sure, he had gotten what he wanted, but...\n\nHe looked at the smaller, empty throne next to him. Radiant Hope wasn't here to enjoy this victory with him. It was still hard to believe that she was gone.\n\nSombra sighed. He didn't love her, at least not in the way she seemed to love him, but he did genuinely care about her. She was... misguided, but the effort she had gone through to restore him was commendable, and he respected that. He respected her, he supposed. He just couldn't fathom actually loving another pony. It seemed foalish, and yet...\n\n"My King," A mage who had aided Sombra in the coup entered the throne room with a black sack in tow, "We have found a foal hiding in the kitchen—the spawn of the royal couple. What shall we do with her?"\n\nAs Sombra processed this information, the mage unceremoniously dumped the foal out of the bag onto the floor before him. Her mouth had been taped shut, her wings bound, and a magical suppression ring placed upon her horn. Only then did Sombra hear her muted bawling. He snarled. "Be silent, you insufferable whelp!"\n\nHis command did little to quell the small foal, whose cries only intensified. The mage stepped forward, "My King, shall we dispose of this one like her parents?"\n\nThe king's gaze burned into the sobbing wreck of a foal, barely more than a toddler. Her parents had torn Hope from this world, and as he opened his mouth to order her execution, he suddenly heard Hope's voice in the back of his mind:\n\n"...Please just promise me this one thing: When we take the Crystal Palace from Cadance and Shining Armor, don't hurt their daughter.

Those who had given him form and power.\n\nIt looked rather ordinary, all things considered—just a dusty wooden door with a simple-looking latch. Sombra stared at the thing as he slowly approached it. Would releasing the umbrum really be that simple? Just opening a single old door?\n\nWould Rabia be pleased with him, given how long she and the others have been imprisoned?\n\nSombra reached out a hoof to the latch. Despite knowing deep within him that this was what he was meant to do, he couldn't help but think of what Radiant Hope had said to him just before they dethroned Shining Armor and Princess Cadance: "We'll build a Crystal Empire to be forever remembered."\n\nHe gazed at the latch. If he opened this door, there was a good chance that the umbrum would destroy the Crystal Empire as retribution for their imprisonment. Sure, he would be fine, but...\n\nThe scene of Hope lying on the cold floor of the throne room flashed through his mind again. The memory was still raw, giving him pause.

 crystalnews.1.t:0 "Sombra Cult Crushed!"
 crystalnews.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]While King Sombra has been dead for years, his ghost remained to be exorcised--until today. After years of searching, the Crystal Empire has arrested the ringlander of a secret society devoted to his resurrection, his childhood friend Radiant Hope. Hope has sworn that she never wanted to hurt anypony, that she only wanted to save her best friend from the darkness inside him, but she is still facing decades in prison for conspiracy and treason. In her arrest, Sombra's horn (which is key to reviving him) was also captured, although Hope made a deal with her captors--in return for the names and locations of every cultist involved, his horn would be placed in secure storage instead of destroyed. The Crystal Royals agreed, and Sombra's horn is now being kept at a secret location under guard.\n\nWith the Sombra cult now completely defunct, the Crystal Ponies can rest easy that he will never enslave them again."

At long last, she has succeeded. Sombra has risen from his grave, and now the King of Monsters lives once more. He has already seized the Crystal City, and with Princess Cadance and Shining Armor's fates unknown, it seems likely the entire Empire is next."

In a speech, he declared his ambitions were not based on "ancient ownership", "personal bloodline" or "delusional nationalism"; the whole continent would be his because he had the power to seize it! He denounced the very concepts of cooperation, diplomacy, and peace, identifying them as "the dreams of fools too weak to seize destiny"."

Today, an even darker fate befalls the Crystal Empire: King Sombra has been deposed by his own family, the Umbrum of myth, and his mother now rules in his place. While the cause of their rift is not fully clear, rumor holds it relates in some way to the daughter of Princess Cadance, Princess Flurry Heart.\n\nLady Rabia has proclaimed herself Empress of Darkness, and her intentions of conquest could not be clearer."

There is no doubt that the Crystal Empire can stand on its own, but there are many dangers in this new world, far more threatening than Sombra, and the Crystal Princess has expressed that the alliance should be maintained.

#### DESCS
POLITICS_CADENZA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 14th of February 972, near Vanhoover\n\n§YBiography§!: Princess Cadance's humble origins belie her future as one of the royal alicorns of Equestria. The pegasus foal, who would later become known as Princess Mi Amore Cadenza, was found in a forest close to Vanhoover by her earth pony adopted parents. Taken to a nearby village, it was a peaceful, calm life until one day, a jealous sorceress named Prismia stole the love of the villagers using a malevolent magical necklace. The young Cadance confronted Prismia and turned her own magic against her, causing her to change her horrible ways. Afterward, Princess Celestia recognised her power, adopted her as her niece and elevated Cadance as the alicorn Princess of Love.\n\nThereafter, Cadance became a foalsitter for Princess Celestia's newest personal student, Twilight Sparkle. She would meet and fall in love with Twilight's older brother, Shining Armour. Their wedding day was going to be perfect, but unfortunately, the scheming Chrysalis, Queen of the Changelings used the opportunity to impersonate Cadance and seize control of Equestria by guile. Despite the presence of a large changeling host and their empowered Queen, Princess Cadance and Shining Armour used the power of their love to cast the changelings out of the country.\n\nWhen the Crystal Empire reappeared, Celestia sent Cadance to rule over it, knowing her to be a descendant of Princess Amore, its last ruler before Sombra's reign. Cadance made her stand there, defeating the nascent shadow of King Sombra that lingered after his banishment by using a mythical artefact called the Crystal Heart. With their success, she and Shining Armour have safekept the land ever since, siring a foal named Flurry Heart along the way.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
POLITICS_SOMBRA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography§!: Sombra's origins are as mysterious as the mere mention of his name is unsettling. What is known, however, comes from the testimony of crystal ponies who were willing enough to speak. He is one of the umbrum — shadow ponies rumoured to be buried under the frozen wastelands of the Crystal Empire, waiting to be released. Some say it was loneliness and dejection that turned him bitter and jaded, striking out against Princess Amore, while others say that it was his only friend and companion, Radiant Hope, who turned Sombra to darkness.\n\nWhat followed is known to everypony: the tyrannical King Sombra used dark magic of the umbrum to enslave the crystal ponies, using many for his personal experiments. His reign of terror only came to an end once the Princesses of Equestria banished him beneath the ice, only for Sombra to curse his land to disappear along with him. After a thousand years, his shadowy form made an attempt to take over again, only to be thwarted by the combined efforts of Princess Cadance and the bearers of the Elements of Harmony.\n\nIt is uncertain whether the most recent reincarnation of King Sombra is the same pony from the myths, but one thing is sure: The King is back.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

crystalemp.26.d:0 "The Princess has received special guests from Equestria today. As the unofficial meeting began, grim looking ponies in suits and military officers explained how Sombra cultists have infiltrated the Crystal society, and even the upper echelons of the government, while the present Crystal officials and soldiers could only silently nod. As the guests explained, [From.GetLeader] has been extremely concerned about the possibility of King Sombra's return, and that the threat posed by his return has been underestimated for far too long. Finally, the pony in a uniform of a Colonel of Equestrian Royal Guard outlined the plan of a joint operation between Equestrian and Crystal agencies that would finally get rid of the threat once and for all. The ponies were ready and in position - the only thing required was the approval of [Root.GetLeader]."
crystalemp.26.a:0 "We cannot say no - the operation has our approval."

crystalemp.27.t:0 "Just another day"
crystalemp.27.d:0 "You've been going to meet your friends more and more lately, often for no reason other than to enjoy their company. Such is the case today.\nHowever, as you trot down the familiar streets leading to the Club, something feels....different. You can't quite put your hoof on it. You feel an urge to look over your shoulder, but see nothing of note. Perturbed, you continue onwards.\nAs you climb the stairs, the itch doesn't go away. You knock on the door, and it opens to reveal the familiar face of Peyote. The huge Stallion smiles down at you, murmuring a greeting. You reply and scurry inside, still feeling spooked. The gentle giant does not fail to notice, concern creasing the corners of his eyes. He opens his mouth to say something, but is interrupted as the unmistakable crack of breaking glass shatters the silence first. Cold winds blow into the apartment, bringing with them a small metal object. It bounces across the floor before exploding with a tremendous flash, no more than a meter away. Your ears feel like they are burning and you stumble about blindly, smashing your shin on a table and folding into a pile of limbs."
crystalemp.27.a:0 "Run!"
crystalemp.27.b:0 "Fight!"

crystalemp.28.t:0 "Flight"
crystalemp.28.d:0 "You scramble to your hooves, or try to. Animal instinct overwhelms you, and all you can think of is escape.\nYou stumble towards the front door, but it explodes off its hinges. You see it impact the dazed form of Dust with a sickening crack, audible even over the screams filling the room. You swerve to the left, ducking through the closest open door. Your eyes still hurt more than you can describe, but raw adrenaline keeps them open. You lunge for a window, fumbling with the lock. As you crawl out and try to balance on the windowsill, black figures pour into the room behind you, shouting demands. They advance, guns raised.\nYou try to shuffle to the side but only succeed in losing your grip. You totter on the edge, forelegs flailing. A feeling of vertigo runs down your spine and you try to lean back towards the window, but it's no use. One of the figures drops his weapon and dives. Time seems to slow as he rushes forward, forelegs outstretched. Your eyes meet his as his hooves brush against your fur, but it's too late. You tilt backwards..."
crystalemp.28.a:0 "So this is what it's like to fly?"
crystalemp.28.b:0 "I never told her that I..."

crystalemp.29.t:0 "Resistance"
crystalemp.29.d:0 "You scramble to your hooves, or try to. A burst of spiteful defiance swells up from deep in your chest. These people think they can just barge in here, ruin all the work everyone has spent so much sweat and blood on? How dare they!\nYou half-run, half-stumble your way to the kitchen, and wrench open the cupboard beneath the sink.\nYou shove your hoof deep inside, and soon feel the cold steel of a Cabaret pistol in your grip. You pray to whatever god is listening that it is loaded, before standing back to your full height, pistol at the ready in your mouth. Your eyes dart around, searching for enemies. Seconds later, a heavily armed figure dressed in black swoops through a nearby window. You hear the front door being blasted off it's hinges and the loud shouts of the intruders, but have no time to look. You snap your weapon onto the target, and fire.\n*click* \nOr try to, anyway. You pull the trigger several more times, but nothing happens. You don't have time to be confused for long, as a rapid *brrrp* emanates from his machinepistol. You are lying on the ground now...when did that happen? Everything feels so heavy....screams continue from the rest of the apartment, but they are fainter now...why is that? You want to lift your head to look, but can't muster the strength..."
crystalemp.29.a:0 "I think i'll just take a nap..."

cryscr.1.t:0 "Celebration is Planned!"
cryscr.1.d:0 "Due to the economic problems the government could not support the tradition with an official celebration of the Winter Solstice holiday last year. However, undoubtedly the situation will change during this year. And we will hold a grand festival on the Winter Solstice day!"
cryscr.1.a:0 "Hurray!"
cryscr.2.t:0 "Flurry Heart Birthday!"
cryscr.2.d:0 "Flurry Heart is the baby daughter of our current Princess, Mi Amore Cadenza. And today she is celebrating her second birthday! Congratulations to the happy family from all the ponies of our vast homeland, the Crystal Empire. Long live the Princesses!"
cryscr.2.a:0 "Yay!"
cryscr.3.t:0 "The Winter Solstice Celebration!"
cryscr.3.d:0 "One of many ancient tradition of the Crystal ponies is celebrating the winter Solstice, when the sun is lowest on the horizon and the night is longest. In medieval times it was an important turn in the season, as it meant that the first half of the harsh crystalline winter was finally over and that brought everypony hope for a warm spring and the start of the sowing season. The celebration was attended by many crystal ponies and tourists from Equestria with yet another visit of the Equestrian royalty."
cryscr.3.a:0 "Hurray!"
cryscr.4.t:0 "Equestria Games Preparations!"
cryscr.4.d:0 "[EQS.GetLeader] is planning to organise the next Equestria Games in Crystal City. It would be to our benefit to support this enterprise, because events such as these unite ponies and celebrate friendship among them."
cryscr.4.a:0 "Right."
cryscr.5.t:0 "Crystal Fair"
cryscr.5.d:0 "The Crystal Fair is one of the oldest traditions of the Crystal Empire and it is shame that we have to ask Equestria for permission and funds to hold the event."
cryscr.5.a:0 "I'm sure Princess Celestia will agree."
cryscr.6.t:0 "Crystal Empire wants to hold Crystal Fair"
cryscr.6.d:0 "Princess Cadance has requested us to support the Crystal Fair celebration. She fears that they simply cannot afford the entirety of its cost, and the Crystal Ponies could really use something to cheer them up. How do we respond?"
cryscr.6.a:0 "May I have an invitation, Cadance?"
cryscr.6.b:0 "We don't have money for that."
cryscr.7.t:0 "Equestria Agrees"
cryscr.7.d:0 "[EQS.GetLeader] granted us permission to carry out the Crystal Fair."
cryscr.7.a:0 "Great!"
cryscr.8.t:0 "Equestria Refuses"
cryscr.8.d:0 "[EQS.GetLeader] denied our proposal of holding a Crystal Fair."
cryscr.8.a:0 "Aww!"
cryscr.9.t:0 "Story of Mi Amore Family"
cryscr.9.d:0 "A new biography of Princess Mi Amore Cadenza has hit bookstores this morning, and it has sold like hot cakes. The biography details her life, from her time as an orphaned Pegasus, to her ascension, to her marriage, and finally to her rule of the Crystal Empire. What is most surprising about the book is the candid nature of the writing: very little is kept private, and the words describe a sincere image of a kind family mare, warts and all.\n\nThe struggles depicted in the biography have renewed interest in the Royal Family among Crystal Ponies, leading to greater solidarity with the Mi Amore family and the Equestrian Crown."
cryscr.9.a:0 "We represent the ponies."
cryscr.10.t:0 "Grand Festival"
cryscr.10.d:0 "We have finally held our first Grand Festival since the banishment of Sombra by the Elements of Harmony! A Thousand years ago, before the disappearance of our empire, it was an annual holiday where we showed the world the beautiful products of our craftsponies: rigorously made crystals, durable armours, diamond-sharp swords! Now we are ready to show the world our strong tanks, precise rifles, swift aircraft and magnificent goods!"
cryscr.10.a:0 "Hurray!"
cryscr.11.t:0 "A Group of Dissidents"
cryscr.11.d:0 "Rumours spread across the Crystal City that there exists a group of ponies that support the old Sombra regime. That is very unlikely, because there are still ponies that have lived under Sombra's tyranny and horror of his enslavement lives in the hearts of the crystal ponies. Regardless, a spectre from the past haunts the Crystal Empire."
cryscr.11.a:0 "That can't be true."
cryscr.12.t:0 "An interesting meeting"
cryscr.12.d:0 "On one ordinary [GetMonth] day in the Crystal City, you are walking through the streets. You stop near a souvenir shop and glance at the poster behind the front display window. A pony in over-exaggerated, heavy chains languishes in the foreground, while a dark silhouette of King Sombra looms in the background. "May tyranny never return to the Crystal lands" reads the writing. "Who would ever pin that in their room?" You wonder aloud. Suddenly a young, pretty pony with light pink coloured fur and a dark blue mane stops nearby as you continue gazing over the poster. You turn and find her also staring through the window. "I hope he will return one day." She says quietly. "What?" You ask. "Have you never wondered what the Crystal Empire would be like, if King Sombra returned?" she replies. You look at her, stunned. "Come join us to find out" she says and puts a note into your hoof."
cryscr.12.a:0 "I need to take part in this."
cryscr.12.b:0 "Are you crazy?!"
cryscr.12.c:0 "I will support, without participating personally."
cryscr.13.t:0 "Interesting Development"
cryscr.13.d:0 "You are given an invitation to a club called "Stories of the Frost", as it says on the card. The description on the other side reads: "Join the historical literature club of the Amethyst University! Tea, cookies and long talks about world history are guaranteed! Top floor, door 37." Sounds like fun, you think. The mare, however, walks away before you can ask anything else. On the other side of the invitation card you can see a detailed map leading to the club."
cryscr.13.a:0 "I will have to check that out."
cryscr.13.b:0 "Not worth it, eh."
cryscr.14.t:0 "Forget it!"
cryscr.14.d:0 "You throw the invitation card away. Whirling in the light breeze, it falls down onto the pavement. "Are you serious? Why would you want that?! He destroyed our country! He..." You don't get to finish, as the pony turns away. She gives you a scornful glance as she goes. You turn around and walk away, wishing to forget this incident ever happened."
cryscr.14.a:0 "Youngsters these days."
cryscr.15.t:0 "It's about time"
cryscr.15.d:0 "It's been a while since you met the mare near the souvenir shop. However, you kept the card and today you finally had the time to follow the instructions that supposedly should lead you to the location of the club. There was something alluring in that card, that mare, and what she said that day. You took a walk through the streets and found yourself at the end of the suggested route. An ordinary, newly built apartment building stands in front of you."
cryscr.15.a:0 "Right into the 37th."
cryscr.15.b:0 "What am I doing?"
cryscr.16.t:0 "First Meeting"
cryscr.16.d:0 "You climb all the way to the top floor of the apartment building. Anticipation slowly fills you as you climb the stairs. After knocking on the wooden door, you are greeted by a stallion garbed in an old, dusty magicians robe. "Is this some kind of cosplay meeting?" You think silently. The stallion motions you to come in and closes the door behind you. The apartment is illuminated only by pony magic, candles, luminous plants, and crystals. Despite this terrible lighting system, you can distinguish a bunch of ponies on the couch, at the table and on the floor. Suddenly the mare you met at the store trots out of a dark doorway, which you suppose leads to the kitchen. "I was waiting!" she exclaims with excitement."
cryscr.16.a:0 "Oh, huh?"
cryscr.17.t:0 "The Club"
cryscr.17.d:0 ""Welcome to the History Club! Hurray!" She cries joyfully. The other ponies support her with weary hurrahs of their own. "We study magic, literature, history, politics and evolutionary science here, but most importantly, we are united by one idea: the belief that the Crystal Empire needs Sombra back!"\n"And what makes you think this is such a good thing?" you ask after contemplating for a few seconds. "Apparently this guy has never read a history book before!" Quips one colt from his poorly illuminated perch. A wave of quiet giggling fills the room. "What do you know that I don't?" You say, irritated. "Sit down" Says an old stallion, who, like the door guard, is also wearing an antique magicians mantle."
cryscr.17.a:0 "Sure thing, gramps."
cryscr.17.b:0 "Why, though?"
cryscr.18.t:0 "The Stories of the Frost"
cryscr.18.d:0 "You sit down at a coffee table at his request. A peculiar crystalline flower bathes both of you in an eerie turquoise glow as the wizened old stallion begins his story.\n"I remember the King. I remember a time when the Crystal Empire was great and powerful, was really an Empire. The lands of the Yaks were under our control, the Western Shores were our second home, and our flag was even planted in the soil of the savage Griffons. The Crystal Ponies were true masters of Equestria and beyond. The soil was rich, the grass was green, the empire thrived and the ponies were free. It was then that the Alicorn sisters of Equestria started to become jealous of our greatness and power. Using the dark magic of the so-called Elements of Harmony, they imprisoned the king and all of the Crystal ponies in a place outside time and space for more than a thousand years. And now, the Crystal Empire is shamelessly trod upon by the sisters of Equestria and their unlawfully installed puppet, "Princess" Mi Amore Cadenza. Their greedy hooves take away all the treasures of the Crystal Empire, giving nothing in return. Thus, the only hope for the Crystal Ponies, the only way for them to gain the future they deserve, is through the return of King Sombra. With our help and his magic, we will restore the old glory of the Crystal Empire!".\nThe stallion ends on a triumphant note, but the effect is somewhat ruined as he starts coughing furiously a second later."
cryscr.18.a:0 "I... see."
cryscr.19.t:0 "An Offer of the Lifetime"
cryscr.19.d:0 "For more than two hours the ponies narrated to you the history of the Crystal Empire, told you of the time when King Sombra ruled over the land. That he was wise, just and caring to the ponies. That the sisters envied his glory and majesty. All of this greatly differed from the Equestrian narrative, but sounded so convincing and motivational.\n"We've been watching you for many moons," says the old pony suddenly. "We know you want to help. We know you want to aid King Sombra's escape from his shameful prison. The crystal ponies must rise against decay and oppression. The time is perfect, frankly, as the stars align in the correct position only once every five hundred years. It is the best time for the incredibly powerful reincarnation spells that will be called for. There is a way to bring King Sombra back, but we need your help! Together we will change the history of the Crystal Empire, and maybe the whole world, for the better!""
cryscr.19.a:0 "Me? Change the world?"
cryscr.20.t:0 "The Decision"
cryscr.20.d:0 "You exit the apartment and walk home, reconsidering your life choices. You were offered a chance to change history. Are you really that powerful? Do you really have the right to decide the fate of millions of ponies? "The group believes that I'm one of them, but what if they really succeed?" You whisper. "Maybe I should report this all to the police while I still have the chance?" The churning thoughts in your head cause you to lose your bearings, leaving you endlessly wandering through the streets of the Crystal City. You get home late in the evening and sit down at the kitchen table, head clasped in your hooves. Suddenly, you realise what must be done."
cryscr.20.a:0 "I have to join!"
cryscr.20.b:0 "This organisation is a threat to peace and harmony!"
cryscr.20.c:0 "I'm not the one they're looking for."
cryscr.21.t:0 "Reported"
cryscr.21.d:0 "The next morning you immediately go to the nearest police station and report everything that you've been told. Police and Royal Guard squads are immediately scrambled to the apartment. As the assault team smashes the door off it's hinges, the screams of the shocked conspirators fill the air. A huge stallion emerges from a side-room and tries to resist, but the policeponies are well-trained. In short order, every member of the "Club" is seized or gunned down. As they are taken down the steps and towards the waiting police van, you notice the cream-pink mare amongst them. She is tightly bound with hoofcuffs, and clearly terrified of what awaits her. She notices you in the crowd, and her eyes widen in shock. You suddenly realise that you never even asked for her name... As you contemplate the strange feeling curling around your heart, the last of the conspirators are bundled into the van. The doors are slammed shut, and within seconds they have been taken away."
cryscr.21.a:0 "I did the right thing... didn't I?"
cryscr.22.t:0 "The Return of Sombra"
cryscr.22.d:0 "You wake up to a terrible, shattering noise. As you roll out of bed and stand up, you see a huge cloud of smoke billowing across the skyline outside your window. The sound of aircraft engines is roaring in your ears. You hastily gather up your things and rush out onto the street. Ponies everywhere are running around in panic, or else standing in a daze. "Sombra has returned!" You hear somepony scream in the crowd. Suddenly, you hear gunshots in the distance. Several hours later you find yourself in a drafting centre. A rifle is shoved into your hooves and you are ordered to head towards one of the many barricades popping up all over the city. "Protect your Princess, Protect Harmony!" exclaims the sergeant. Sombra's supporters are taking up arms, and his return has almost immediately escalated into an all out civil war. A kind of war that the Crystal Empire has never seen before. It looks like the club succeeded after all..."
cryscr.22.d_com:0 "Sudden nightmares and intense dread interrupt your thoughts; you look outside and see billowing plumes of smoke from the capital. Engines roar as a squadron of aircraft flies overhead. Confused ponies are running all over the place. One voice can be discerned through all the noise, likely the result of a pony speaking into a megaphone. "Sombra has returned, comrades! Take up arms! Defend your homes, your families, your city, your country! Sombra was banished once! It will happen again, and we will show the world that our might is enough!" Some time later, the conscription begins in earnest, and you are not spared; you are given the bare necessities; a gun, ammunition, and a small knife, before being dispatched to the front lines. It would seem that Sombra's cult, that club, has succeeded..."
cryscr.22.d_fas:0 "After coming to power in the Empire, [Root.GetLeader] has finally been able to go about her work without secrecy or impediment. With the full resources of the state at her disposal, what once seemed like a daunting task has proven remarkably easy. All the necessary ritual materials have been prepared, and King Sombra can now be returned to the waking world with little more than an order.\n\nAfter so long, it almost feels anti-climactic for it to happen like this..."
cryscr.22.a:0 "No way."
cryscr.22.b:0 "That was quick."
cryscr.23.t:0 "Back to the Club"
cryscr.23.d:0 "After a while you are fully convinced that the return of Sombra is necessary to secure a better future for the Empire and its citizens. You return to the club, where you now meet only four ponies. Sakira Bluebell, the pink-furred earth pony from before, with her dark blue mane and deep violet eyes. Dust Snowfall, the old earth pony stallion with pale-light ochre fur, a long, grizzled mane, and a perpetually tired look on his face. Lake Frost, the light-blue, nearly white unicorn with reflective dark-blue hair, the one who wore the magician's mantle before. And new to you, Red Peyote, a huge pony who wouldn't look out of place guarding a nightclub entrance. You jokingly wonder if the only part of his body without extra muscles stacked on is his horn. It is a pleasure to meet you." says Snowfall. "We have been developing a plan to bring King Sombra back from limbo for many moons now. Your assistance will be extremely helpful."
cryscr.23.a:0 "I'm in."
cryscr.24.t:0 "Knowledge of the elders"
cryscr.24.d:0 ""In order to release King Sombra from his magical prison, we need to acquire both an ancient rune and a crystal heart charged with dark magic. With these, we will be able to replace the Crystal Heart and weaken the veil between the world of the living and Limbo, where King Sombra is imprisoned. We know that the secrets of reincarnation magic and the formula to create the Dark Heart can both be found amongst the many scrolls and books in the library of Amethyst University. However, dark magic is strictly forbidden by law in the Empire and access to the Forbidden Section requires the very highest level of security authorisation. We will have to resort to extreme measures: enchanting the librarians and guards. This is a dangerous enterprise, are you with us?""
cryscr.24.a:0 "That's why I'm here."
### rework
cryscr.25.t:0 "On the way"
cryscr.25.d:0 "The next day, you join up with Sakira on one of the central streets. She waves to you from the other side of the street and you rush across in a barely restrained dash, despite the lack of traffic. Once by her side, the two of you begin to walk. You could almost describe it as a fun stroll with a friend...If it weren't for the fact that you are both intending to change history. As you chat, Sakira gives you a look into her life. It turns out that she is a history student. She had always admired King Sombra, even before joining the Club. After meeting Dust Snowfall and hearing the old Stallions stories, she decided to dedicate her life to saving King Sombra."
cryscr.25.a:0 "I see."
cryscr.26.t:0 "Entrance"
cryscr.26.d:0 "You link up with the second part of the group. Only Peyote, the bouncer stallion, isn't here. The giant university library looms in front of you. In silence, you trot up the stairs. Inside, an old librarian greets you. She is very familiar with all of you, even Dust. Every gentle hoofstep and hushed comment reverberates back at you as you pass the mare and journey through the silent, magnificent halls. The only other signs of life here are students, quietly reading their study books and whispering to each other. You head to the centre of the hall, then turn left, all the way to the wall. Between the shelves, another turn to the left, some more turns, into a passageway, and... there it is! "The Forbidden Section". Two guards are playing chess on a coffee table near the door. The plan springs into action. Sakira approaches the guards and distracts them with small-talk. Meanwhile, using all his power, Lake casts a charm spell on the stallions. Their eyes turn green and they return to their unfinished game, apparently unconcerned. "I practised that for many moons." Lake says, panting slightly. He takes a pair of keys from the guards, and opens the door..."
cryscr.26.a:0 "Forward."
cryscr.27.t:0 "The Library"
cryscr.27.d:0 "You've spent three hours in the library. Although the ancient and dusty tomes were sometimes ardours for to read, they proved very useful in your studies. Most of your time was spent walking around the shelves, trying to find the required books. In the end, everypony gathered to the centre of the Forbidden Section. "We need to hurry, the spell on those guards won't last forever." Dust murmurs in a warning tone. "Well" you start "as it turns out, three things are required to succeed. First, some basic crystal rocks. Second, a red Umbrum crystal. And third, time for the Dark Heart to grow. We will have to head into the Mountains in order to find the crystals." As you finish, Dust speaks up approvingly. "That is right. And after we have procured them, we shall spread the crystals around the city and fill them with magic. This will make the reincarnation spell much stronger in the end." He opens a book and levitates it around around slowly for the benefit of the group. "And here is the pentagram that we will have to draw, before casting the spell.""
cryscr.27.a:0 "Answers, finally!"
cryscr.30.t:0 "Hit the road"
cryscr.30.d:0 "You studied everything carefully many times over the next few days. As you did so, the connection between you and others became even stronger. You were working hoof in hoof as partners, as friends. And now it is time to go on a journey in search of crystals. But the destination is yet to be decided."
cryscr.30.a:0 "The Umbrum Cage."
cryscr.30.b:0 "Snowybury awaits!"
cryscr.31.t:0 "The Umbrum Cage"
cryscr.31.d:0 "You head south on hoof, to the gently sloping hills and perilous mineshafts of the Umbrum Cage. This sparsely populated region adjacent to the Neighagra high-lands received its name due to its unusually rich veins of Umbrum crystals. You follow your map to one of the old mines. The whole region is abandoned. You trot past the eerie sight of broken stone huts overrun by plants, and the rusted skeletons of antiquated carts and machinery. No work has been done here for centuries. When the Crystal Empire disappeared, this place did not. We truly are a nation of time travellers, you muse. Finally, you arrive at the right mine. "Are you sure that this will have what we need?" You ask uncertainly. "I've checked the maps and books over and over." Lake replies with a hint of irritation. "This place was a major mine before we disappeared, and it clearly hasn't been exploited at all since then. So it should be just as rich now as it was back then.""
cryscr.31.a:0 "Alright then."
cryscr.32.t:0 "The Crystal Mountains"
cryscr.32.d:0 "The air near the mountains is cold and fresh. At the foot of the mountain lies the town of Snowybury, once quite popular with tourists due to its location. Beautiful forests and waterfalls dot the landscape, while healing springs and skiing resorts higher up the mountains attract many crystal ponies. The Crystal Empire truly is a wonderful country! The town itself is very quiet and stereotypically "rural" place in the endearing, quaint sort of way. Despite it being practically the most northerly outpost of ponykind, cultivated fields are scattered all around. But you can't waste time appreciating the beauty of your homeland. You and your friends arrived here with a purpose."
cryscr.32.a:0 "Lovely place."
cryscr.33.t:0 "The Caves"
cryscr.33.d:0 "After a day spent checking out the landmarks, you finally get an opportunity to separate from the main crowd of tourists. You duck into a cave entrance and begin to make your way deep into the mountain. "Are you sure we won't get lost?" Sakira titters nervously as you you descend into darkness. Already, all sources of illumination have vanished except for Lake's magic and a small flashlight taped to Dust's head. You think you can feel the temperature dropping with every dozen steps. Within minutes, the students are already shaking from cold and each exhale brings forth a cloud of steam. The coldness of the mountain bites to the bone, and you start to feel as if you have a sore throat. As you are busy climbing down a nearly vertical incline, you suddenly realise that you can barely feel your hooves. You progress even further, until suddenly you round a corner and see the faint glow of crystals in the distance. Everypony hastens their pace. You come out into a big grotto with a clean, beautiful underground lake. The still, perfect surface of the lake transitions seamlessly into hard stone. Rich and intact crystal deposits of various colours dot the walls and floor, sometimes stretching up from the ground to a height greater than a pony. Some of the crystal formations glow faintly, but the main source of the sky-blue light you saw earlier proves to be the lake itself. Or rather, what is inside it. Looking down through the perfectly clear liquid, you see HUNDREDS of crystals. And at the centre of the treasure-trove, one pure red spike can be seen. This is it. An Umbrum crystal."
cryscr.33.a:0 "There it is."
cryscr.34.t:0 "Red Crystal"
cryscr.34.d:0 ""Let's get this over with." You say. Sakira takes a hammer and starts searching for a good ordinary crystal. You turn to Lake. "Lake, can you pull out the red crystal? We need to get out of here before we all freeze to death." "I can try." He replies, noticeably shaking. He steps closer to the lake and as his horn flashes with light, an identical aura appears around the crystal at the bottom. But nothing happens. He clenches his teeth, and a second layer of glow bursts into life over his horn as his legs begin to shake. It doesn't help. Lake falls to the ground suddenly. You rush over to check on him, but thankfully it seems like he has just fainted. "Sweet Celestia" You whisper. "One of us will have to dive" says Dust. After glances from the group, he elaborates. "It would take incredible skill at magic to dislodge that. A physical approach would be much easier.""
cryscr.34.a:0 "I will."
cryscr.34.b:0 "Sakira."
cryscr.34.c:0 "Dust, you're experienced."
cryscr.34.e:0 "Sakira, let's do it together."
cryscr.35.t:0 "Deep water"
cryscr.35.d:0 ""I will, I can do it. Sakira, give me the hammer, let's finish this." You say with determination. "Oh...okay" agrees Sakira reluctantly. She hoofs you her hammer. You take the tool and stare into the water for a few seconds. Then, without further ado, you steel yourself and jump in. The water is colder than you can describe, so cold that it burns. You try to dive to the bottom as fast you can, but the pressure increases and it's hard to move. After what feels like hours but can only have been seconds, you find yourself about a meter before the glowing red crystal. Swinging desperately, you feel the reverberations from each strike pulse up your legs. Another swing. And another. Spasms and convulsions wrack your back hooves as pain takes over. One more swing. One more. A crack! And at last the red crystal dislodges, now floating gently. You grab the beautiful thing with both hooves and push off from the bottom of the lake. You breach the surface gasping for air, leaving the hammer in the lake forever. You feel delirious, ready to faint. But through it all, you can't help but muse proudly "What a team we are....""
cryscr.35.a:0 "..."
cryscr.36.t:0 "Red and pink"
cryscr.36.d:0 ""W-why me? I-I'm scared." Sakira looks at you and Dust in shock. "I can't even swim." You say. "You need to do it for Sombra! The future of the Crystal Empire might depend on you right now, we won't be able to come back here." You reason. "You... You're right." she breaths unevenly, but tries to control it. You put a hoof on her back and murmur some gentle reassurances. "For my people" she says, suddenly filled with determination. She takes the hammer into her mouth with a short, firm nod. Jump. Splash. She swims very well apparently. You anxiously worry, imagining what the water feels like. After a long minute of waiting, Sakira breaks through the surface again, coughing violently. You and Dust immediately leap into action to help her out. She is ice cold to the touch and shaking uncontrollably, but the red crystal is with her."
cryscr.36.a:0 "Well done."
cryscr.37.t:0 "Old pony's job"
cryscr.37.d:0 ""Move aside, youngsters". Dust immediately accepts his task without persuasion. You feel your respect for the experienced old Stallion grows even stronger. Despite his age, he is willing to do anything for the hope of King Sombra's return. He takes Sakira's hammer into his mouth and jumps into the lake. You exchange hopeful glances with Sakira. Dust's swimming pace is rather slow. You try to imagine what the water must feel like, and grimace at the result. After a minute of waiting, Dust finally breaks through the surface once more. You and Sakira quickly run to the bank to help him out, but he doesn't look concerned or exhausted. But more importantly, the Umbrum crystal is there, tight within his grasp."
cryscr.37.a:0 "Good job."
cryscr.38.t:0 "Freeze together"
cryscr.38.d:0 " "Sakira, it will be easier if we do this together. We can break the crystal and help each other swim. We are stronger together, this is the smartest way." You reason, staring earnestly at her. "oh, uh..." she sighs,"Okay... Let's do it." Both of you take deep, preparatory breaths before stepping up to the brink. You look over at her and give her a wry smile, squeezing her hoof reassuringly. Then, the pair of you jump into the lake. The water is so cold that it burns. Struggling, you both push your way down. It becomes harder and harder to move as the pressure increases. As you approached the crystal, you grab it with both hooves and try to pull, while Sakira attacks it at the base with the hammer. You witness hit after hit, and each passing second feels as if it is a minute long. Finally, the crystal breaks and you quickly struggle to the surface, dragging Sakira up with you by her hoof. You are both freezing and shaking, but the job is done."
cryscr.38.a:0 "Made it."

cryscr.39.d_player:0 "With great trouble you and the group retrace your path back out of the caves. You are exhausted and frozen, but victorious. Now that the crystal has been found and retrieved, it is time to change history. Struggling to stand on your frostbitten hooves, you require assistance to walk. You get back to Snowybury and spend a night in the hotel. You start to feel very sick, and from time to time you burst into terrible, wretched coughing. Sakira tries to take care of you, bringing you hot tea and medicine, changing your clothes as you sweat. But it gets worse, and you can't help but wonder if you will ever get better...."

Now that the crystal has been found and retrieved, it is time to change history. Struggling to stand on her frostbitten hooves, Sakira requires assistance to walk. You get back to the hotel in Snowybury and spend a night there. Everypony needs rest, especially Sakira who soon develops a serious cold. You try to help in any way you can. You bring tea and medicine to her bed, keep the fireplace warm, and hold her hoof reassuringly. Between terrible coughing fits, she smiles in sick delirium and assures everypony around her that this is all fine. She is as close to achieving her goal as she's ever been, and so she is happy."
cryscr.39.d_dust:0 "With great trouble you and the group retrace your path back out of the caves. You are exhausted and frozen, but victorious. Now that the crystal has been found and retrieved, it is time to change history. Things are going rather great. However, when you get back to your hotel room for some well-deserved rest, you notice that Dust Snowfall is starting to feel dizzy and sick. His age, seemingly irrelevant for so long, suddenly makes itself felt. He develops a high temperature, followed by a horrific cough. The three of you do everything you can to help the old stallion, but it is obvious that he requires professional medical treatment."
cryscr.39.d_sakira_and_player:0 "With great trouble you and the group retrace your path back out of the caves. You are exhausted and frozen, but victorious. Now that the crystal has been found and retrieved, it is time to change history. Struggling to stand on your frostbitten hooves, you and Sakira require assistance to walk. With Dust having to help Lake, you and Sakira walk together, supporting each other. By the time you arrive at the hotel room, it is apparent that both you and Sakira have caught a cold. Both of you spend a rough night dealing with dizziness, fever and coughing fits. It is obvious that you will require medical treatment when you arrive back in the Crystal City."

cryscr.40.t:0 "Dark Heart"
cryscr.40.d:0 "Back in the City, Dust and Lake immediately set about fashioning the various crystals into the artefacts that you need. "It will take roughly one to three moons for the Dark Heart to grow in strength. Now that we have succeeded, we must pass on the news to the leader of our cause, so she may prepare the Movement across the Empire. But... Not anypony else. We need to be even more careful from now on. If the police arrive to search the apartment, we're doomed. We should consider moving to a safer place.""
cryscr.40.a:0 "Me and Sakira really need help."

cryscr.41.d:0 "As there are no civilised places to rest, you decide that you need to set up a camp in one of the abandoned stone houses. As you look for a good structure, you suddenly hear voices inside your current candidate. You look inside through a hole in the wall. The house doesn't have a roof and inside of it, everything is covered in lush plants, grass, flowers, and a dogrose bush. Inside, on what appears to be the fallen roof, two foals are playing with sticks and dolls. When they notice you, they back off, scared."
cryscr.41.a:0 "It's all good, easy, easy."
cryscr.41.b:0 "Everything is okay, kids."
cryscr.42.t:0 "Foals"
cryscr.42.d:0 ""You've got nothing to be afraid of here, I'm just a traveller passing by, looking for a place to stay." You say. The ponies look relieved, but alert. "T-there are never ponies around here" says one foal, a filly with blue fur. "Ah, well, we uh, we were investigating the mines, for... scientific reasons" - you say - "I'm here with a group of my friends..."\nThe Foals decide to stay with you for some time. Eventually, you ask them what they think about King Sombra. - "My parents told me that he enslaved everypony, and there was no friendship or harmony when he was here." - says the colt - "Celestia and Luna freed us from him. We are free now"\n"What if they are wrong?"\n"We'd need Sombra back to find that out" - he jokingly replies. "Anyway, we should get back to our village, the sun is going down."\nYou find little sleep that night. Your thoughts are consumed by questions. Who is King Sombra? What will he really do? How will the ponies react to his resurrection... The clear sky glimmers with beautiful stars as you lie on your back, wide awake."
cryscr.42.a:0 "Right..."
cryscr.43.t:0 "Foals"
cryscr.43.d:0 ""Shh-shh, calm down. Hey guys, come here, I've found some foals here!" You shout to attract the attention of your friends. The foals exchange glances and run away through a tiny hole in wall. "No, wait!" you cry, but they have already vanished. "Foals? Where?" Sakira asks as she approaches. "I... They ran away..." You admit, looking apologetic. "You shouldn't have screamed like that, good heavens!" Sakira rolls her eyes. "You scared the foals. Ugh, no matter. Anyway, this place looks good enough." You and your friends set up camp in the house. The sight of the sky, filled with beautiful, glimmering white stars, is the last thing you see before you close your eyes and fall into a deep, dreamless sleep."
cryscr.43.a:0 "Fine."
cryscr.44.t:0 "The Mines"
cryscr.44.d:0 "The next morning you all eat a short breakfast, cooked by Sakira. After that, you decide to try your luck in the mines and search for something valuable. After looking around, you stumble upon a shaft covered by the remnants of a large wooden door. The look of the tunnel is not very inviting. In fact, it is downright creepy. There almost seems to be a....dead space around the shaft entrance, within which grass seems unable to grow. It feels like the whole place is an entrance to the underworld. "There's nothing we can do about it" says Lake, lighting his horn. "Don't hesitate, hesitation and doubt are a waste of time." He turns away and goes inside."
cryscr.44.a:0 "Here we go."
cryscr.45.t:0 "Old Gates"
cryscr.45.d:0 "The tunnel is very dark, and only the presence of unicorn magic and the flashlight on Dust's head allows you to continue on. Here and there, you see rusty remnants of pickaxes, shovels, and other equipment. This place clearly hasn't been touched since the disappearance of the Crystal Empire. Every tool looks medieval, ancient. There weren't any rails, like you've seen in pictures of mines in the San Palomino Desert. After a good hour of walking in cold, wet, stuffy air of the shaft, turning every now and then according to Lake's map, you stumble upon a door which was not marked on the map. "I can sense a magical barrier on this door" says Lake, tapping it experimentally with a hoof."
cryscr.45.a:0 "What's with that?"
cryscr.46.t:0 "The Barrier"
cryscr.46.d:0 ""I have to break it somehow." says Lake, as his horn begins to glow brighter. The arcane aura of his magic concentrates around the door. Sparks start to appear, as if the door itself is a malfunctioning machine. Soon, the ground begins to shake and the ozone chocking the air makes it hard to breath. The rumble of this magical duel reverberates off the walls of this tight enclosed space, growing into a physically painful cacophony. Suddenly the door explodes in a cloud of light-grey dust. A fleck of debris hits you, and when you bring your hoof to your cheek it comes away red. Lake screams at the climax, and you rush over to his side."
cryscr.46.a:0 "Ah."
cryscr.47.t:0 "Treasures"
cryscr.47.d:0 "The door has vanished, atomised. Lake stands and rubs his forehead in pain, grimacing. Once the cloud of dust and residual magic static has faded, you are able to see what was behind the door. THOUSANDS of crystals of different kinds and shapes are in front of you! Umbrum crystals, gems, precious stones of every description. "This is great!" exclaims Dust. "Are you alright?" Sakira asks Lake. "Y-yes, it's okay, something just got in my eye when the door exploded." he replies.\nYou retrieve the crystals that you need to grow the Dark Heart and head back home."
cryscr.47.a:0 "Well, that went better than expected."
cryscr.48.t:0 "Crystal Dark Energy"
cryscr.48.d:0 "You decide to take your time and charge the crystals scattered around the City with dark magic. Lake and Dust teach you to control your magic power through a magical staff. "Remember, magic lives in all of us, in all ponies. Some of us just need certain help to control it." After several days of hard practice you learn a spell that takes part of your mana and transforms it into dark energy. With that, the group takes you to fill the crystals. As said in the books, it will create an additional layer of force to support the reincarnation spell."
cryscr.48.a:0 "Right."
cryscr.49.t:0 "The Dark Heart is ready"
cryscr.49.d:0 "At last, the Umbrum crystal has grown into the Dark Heart. With this, when the moment comes, we will replace the Crystal Heart and bring King Sombra back! But first, we need to organise Sombra supporters for a revolt. We have only once chance to do this, thus we ought to be thoroughly prepared."
cryscr.49.a:0 "Yes."
cryscr.50.t:0 "Dark Portents in the Crystal Empire"
cryscr.50.d:0 "As Equestrian advisors have spread throughout the Empire they've started to notice strange events, prompting an investigation by the Royal Guard. Results were... inconclusive. It is a strange situation where the chief investigator, True "The Fox" Believer, swears that there is a conspiracy afoot, but no matter how many people are interrogated nor how many accounts audited nothing seems to appear. Some of the Crystal Royal Guard seem to believe the same as The Fox, with them proclaiming that this conspiracy must go all the way to the highest echelons of government, but many others on both sides of the border are now saying that this is starting to feel like a wild pony hunt. The Fox claims that the investigation must continue, and that he is close to unravelling the whole thing, but that is unlikely to be financially feasible."
cryscr.50.a:0 "Give this pony his own department, and no subordinates."
cryscr.1111.t:0 "Intermission"
cryscr.1111.d:0 "The Dark Heart has grown to its full strength. Sternly believing in your just cause, you prepare yourself for the deed you are bound to accomplish in next several days, the dream awaited by many, the return of King Sombra. Mixed thoughts, mixed feelings in the group, whispers, negotiations with Sombra supporters. Everything is hasty, turbulent, hectic. "This is really it." Sakira murmurs to you one evening. "Everything is going to change tomorrow...""
cryscr.1111.a:0 "Yes... yes!"
crysom.0.t:0 "Action starts"
crysom.0.d:0 "As the leader of the underground party of Sombra supporters, you receive the message firsthoof: The student Cell is ready to act. It is decided. Tomorrow, the Crystal Heart will be replaced with the Dark Heart, the magical veil separating the world of the living and limbo will be temporarily destroyed, and Sombra will restore his material body. We need to organise an appropriate greeting for our lawful King."
crysom.0.a:0 "That's right."
crysom.1.t:0 "The Final Act"
crysom.1.d:0 "During the night, a crowd of Sombrians surrounds the city palace. Violence starts to spread across the city as the police try to restore order. However, well-organised Cells of Sombrians keep police reinforcements tied up away from the palace with ambushes and blockades. You know that such overt actions make the deployment of the Royal Army only a matter of time, so you need to act fast. You remove the Crystal Heart and throw the Dark Heart in its place. Immediately, giant storm clouds appear in the sky, blocking out the moon. You and your friends stand in a circle around the heart and start chanting the spell. The crowd supports you. "Usque ad septentrionem glacies extremo qui suscitatur qui inscribitur contra fortunam sol et luna post horizontum posuit in sempiternum! Et ille timor hostium suorum ferit!""
crysom.1.a:0 "Spiritis!"

crysom.2.t:0 "The Return"
crysom.2.d:0 "After several minutes of incantation, thunder and lightning breaks the sky. A great cloud starts to grow from the ground at the edge of the city. A bright, green, and violent writhing speck appears kilometers away. You all cease your chanting and stare in awe. The cloud is relentlessly driving towards the city centre. Lightnings strikes, brighter than ever now, pepper the ground and illuminate the streets as if it were day time. Suddenly, everything turns black. Ghostly shadows are passing by. Explosions, thunder, the earth shakes... But after a minute the darkness fades away. And there he stands in a crater under the palace, in his steel armour, his eyes glowing with dark magic. His mere presence frightens everypony around on an instinctual level."
crysom.2.a:0 "So it begins."
crysom.2.b:0 "So it begins."
crysom.2.c:0 "So it begins."
crysom.2.e:0 "So it begins."
crysom.3.t:0 "Riders of Apocalypse"
crysom.3.d:0 "From the smoke, after Sombra, come his Royal Guards, partially coalesced dark shadows. They look around contemptuously and the ancient, baleful power inside their eyes diminishes everypony they gaze upon. They are ready to fight for the king."
crysom.3.a:0 "Ride forth, and slay them all."
crysom.3.b:0 "Ride forth, and slay them all."
crysom.4.t:0 "Dark Magic"
crysom.4.d:0 "An ancient Dark Orb arrived with King Sombra. It is dying, but it is still powerful enough to enhance physical and psychological abilities of our soldiers."

crysom.5.t:0 "Power"
crysom.5.d:0 "An ancient Dark Orb arrived with King Sombra. It's power is fading away, but the magic is still strong enough to control the minds of Ponies. It is time to send everypony to the mines."

crysom.6.t:0 "Lake's health"
crysom.6.d:0 "After the incident in the Umbrum mines, Lake's vision has been worsening day by day. If this continues, he will not be able to do his job in the government."
crysom.6.a:0 "What can we do?"
crysom.7.t:0 "Lake is blind"
crysom.7.d:0 "A message came today that Lake Frost has completely lost his vision. He says it was sudden, he woke up and couldn't see a thing, everything was pitch black. He thought it was because he overworked the day before. But he never regained his vision. Now he stays in his room in deep depression."
crysom.7.a:0 "Too bad."
crysom.8.t:0 "Sickness"
crysom.8.d:0 "After swimming through the underground lake in the Crystal Mountains your health never really recovered. But today you feel absolutely terrible, coughing up blood and with the highest temperature a pony can have. It is unlikely that you will be able to participate in government any time soon."
crysom.8.d_sick_together:0 "After swimming through the underground lake in the Crystal Mountains, your health never really recovered. Today was one of those days of terrible sick migraines, and you barely struggled through it. Sakira is suffering similarly, sadly."

crysom.8.b:0 "Always."
crysom.9.t:0 "Sickness"
crysom.9.d:0 "Dust Snowfall, always looking happy and motivated, fell ill last night. Fever, coughing, and migraines all struck at once. It is as yet unclear what caused this sickness, however you assume that it is a consequence of that swim he took in that underground lake."
crysom.9.a:0 "Too bad."
crysom.10.t:0 "Sickness"
crysom.10.d:0 "Week after week, Dust's health is worsening. King Sombra personally sent the best doctors to pull Dust through this and expressed his condolences over the matter. Sometimes Dust feels better and goes out onto the balcony in his newly built private apartment building in the centre of Crystal City, but his outings are limited to this. He prefers to stay inside his apartment as he believes cold weather can damage his health even more."
crysom.10.a:0 "Get well soon."
crysom.11.t:0 "Dust Snowfall"
crysom.11.d:0 "Sad news come to us today, as Dust Snowfall passed away in his bed this morning. Such a serious, continuous sickness could not end without consequences for someone at his age. And in this case they were most serious. The evening before, he coughed blood and couldn't walk. The doctors did everything to support his life, but death came for him. In several days he will be buried in the central cemetery of the City, with all the other great leaders of the Crystal Empire."
crysom.11.a:0 "Never forget."
crysom.1222.t:0 "Sakira is sick"
crysom.1222.d:0 "After swimming through the mountain lake, Sakira never fully recovered. And her condition has been worsening during the last few weeks.

She feels that without fresh air and the lovely countryside of the Crystal Empire she will never recover."
crysom.1222.a:0 "Get well soon!"
crysom.1222.b:0 "I need to be there by her side!"
crysom.12.t:0 "Getting better"
crysom.12.d:0 "Over time Sakira was allowed to go outside. She never fell into despair about her condition, never pitied herself and urged others not to. She took her sickness for granted, as if it was an ordinary way of life. She was always cheerful and wished that even if she died, King Sombra and her friends would continue building a better life for the ponies of the Crystal Empire."
crysom.12.a:0 "Truly a patriot."
crysom.12.b:0 "Need to pay her a visit."
crysom.13.t:0 "Back to normal life"
crysom.13.d:0 "During the moons of sickness, Sakira never gave up or fell into depression, and that was probably the crucial factor in her recovery. Yesterday she informed everyone that she is going back to her office in the Crystal Palace to continue serving the state."
crysom.13.a:0 "Great job."
crysom.14.t:0 "Militarisation"
crysom.14.d:0 "During today's assembly of the government, King Sombra ordered the state to commence rapid militarisation of the country so that it will be able to fend off any external threat.

crysom.14.a:0 "Right."
crysom.15.t:0 "The New Army"
crysom.15.d:0 "Propaganda campaigns and military training, as well as funding to military factories, will all drain our scarce resources. But there's no way around it if we want to stay in power.

crysom.15.a:0 "Of course."
crysom.16.t:0 "The Civil War has ended"
crysom.16.d:0 "Yesterday the last centre of resistance was eliminated by the New Umbrum Army. The civil war is won. Now we must prepare to defend the Empire from the greedy hooves of Equestria."
crysom.16.a:0 "Forward."
crysom.17.t:0 "Recovered"
crysom.17.d:0 "In the middle of the night, Sakira walked up to you and said that she didn't feel any sign of her sickness anymore. She hugged you in your bed and cried. This was the moment you both had been waiting for for many moons. She said that tomorrow she is going to start working in her office in the Palace, she wants to help the Empire in every way she can."
crysom.17.a:0 "Great!"
crysom.18.t:0 "Together in trouble"
crysom.18.d:0 "Over time Sakira was allowed to go outside. She never fell into despair about her condition, especially with you by her side. She never pitied herself and urged others not to. She took her sickness for granted, as if it was an ordinary way of life. You never left her alone during these bad days, nor did she abandon you. Together you knew you could get through this. The Magic of Friendship always lifts up the spirits of Ponies."

crysom.19.d:0 "King Sombra has gathered his closest advisors and declared that the war against Equestria is inevitable, and that it needs to be carried out as soon as possible, before Equestria is able to build up it's strength.

There is no doubt that the Crystal Empire can stand on its own, but there are many dangers in this new world, far more threatening than Sombra, and the Crystal Princess has expressed that the alliance should be maintained. However, the dissenting opinion believes that the nation is more than capable of defending itself, and relying on [equestria.GetLeader]'s assistance would only result in continued subjugation.

Though they will never be able to say it publicly, many crystal citizens hope that the new queen will be able to tame many of her husband's darker impulses. For many outside the Empire though the new queen is a mystery, save for the fact that she was the ringleader of the plot to bring Sombra back to life.

King Sombra has fired back at his critics, declaring their words to be pure nonsense and that extermination of opposing bloodlines is the only logical and morally upright position to hold.

TWILIGHT_DESC:0 "The latest ascendant to Alicornhood, Princess Twilight Sparkle is the Element of Magic, former protégé of Princess Celestia and saviour of Equestria. Her meteoric rise to fame and success is attributed to her resolve in spreading the magic of friendship wherever she went, and in the process corrected many wrongs and even converted some former antagonists to the Equestrian cause. She is also one of the most brilliant mages of the time, having invented and perfected many spells and arcane methods. Yet Twilight Sparkle remains as humble as the day she first set hoof in Ponyville, preferring the company of her friends and family rather than dealing with the minutiae of bureaucracy. \n\nRecent events, however, have left her greatly saddened, and she has accepted the rulership of the Crystal Empire. And even though there are many who dislike the Monarchy as a ruling system, very few ponies can say anything negative about Twilight Sparkle, who is the living embodiment of how much you can achieve with friendship and kindness."

A shy and reclusive pony in his youth, many things changed for him after he met his future wife, Princess Cadance. From there, he quickly rose through the ranks and eventually proposed to Cadance. Unfortunately, his marriage day was almost ruined by Queen Chrysalis' schemes, but through the power of love, he and Cadance expelled the changelings from Canterlot. Afterward, they were appointed rulers of the resurgent Crystal Empire, guarding it from the dark forces of King Sombra. He is stern, but fair, and the troops under his command greatly appreciate his father-figure behaviour and unwavering dedication to the defence of Equestria. Sworn to protect everything he cares for, Shining Armour will fight to the end to protect his wife, child and Equestria from the clutches of Chrysalis."

Although timid and introverted by nature, her fellow ponies encouraged her talent, resulting in Wondermane having a chance to attend a prestigious school in Baltimare. While her academic performance was not always stellar, Wondermane's natural drive and determination led her to discover her exceptional talent in combat magic. Soon afterwards, she was recommended to the newly formed Equestrian unicorn corps.\n\nEven with her pacifist tendencies, Wondermane has shown herself to be capable in the field. Eventually rising to the top of her command, she was one of the first military personnel to be assigned to the recently returned Crystal Empire. The frigid north suits Wondermane more than her native jungles ever had."
solidshot_desc:0 "The adopted son of a moderately elevated family in the Crystal Empire, Solid Shot used his familial connections and natural gifts as a markspony to secure an officer's commission in the army.

Very self interested, his loyalties are fickle at best, but he is, none the less, a gifted officer."

cry_ice_desc:0 "Ice is a Lieutenant Colonel, formerly of Equestria, now serving under the Crystal Empire. Having worked as a Winter Specialist due to his extremely aggressive nature in northern climates, he was mostly tasked with putting down border skirmishes near Stalliongrad, until he voluntarily joined the Crystal Army.\n\nWhile being caring to the ponies under him, he offers little care to hostile forces. His thoughts are based around one thing. The continuous attack of a enemy line. He holds his troops to the highest. At the same time, he holds airpower as key to his plans, and uses it religiously.\n\nIce is a only child, and his family spent a lot of time around him. When it came to be known to them he wanted to become a chef, his father instead booked him, and persuaded him to enlist in the Royal Guard. His initial expectation was a short career, but he began to grow fond of the orderly construct of the military.\n\nDespite being a playful and friendly bat, he did his job efficiently. He was promoted to Sergeant at the age of 24, eventually applying, and accepted, into the Equestrian Military Academy. He entered it expecting to get his commission, until he actually entered it. The competition of the school thrilled him, and he was among the highest-scoring graduates. Following his comission as a 2nd Lieutenant, he was deployed to the Severyanian border, putting down small insurgents and equally small border skirmishes. His work was noticed eventually, and he was finally comissioned as a Captain when he was 33. His ascent into becoming a Lt.Col. began when he was tasked with the assault of a factory taken over by a small group of rebels. He led a group of 20 ponies against around 40 insurgents. After a two-hour siege, he convinced the insurgents to surrender, propelling him from Major to Lieutenant Colonel at the age of 35. He transferred to the Crystal Army afterwards, still using the insignia of his old unit, the 38th Winter Warfare Battalion."

She quickly enlisted in the Royal Guard and rose to the rank of general within a short span of time. She noticed the growing threat of the Changelings along the borders and began adapting her strategies to best combat them. One day Dusty fears that all that has been gained will be lost and she might even be open to more radical ideas that ensure the security of the Empire against other hostile species."

CRY_dawn_on_crystal_empire_desc:0 "Last year's reforms went well: poverty and illiteracy continue to drop as the crystal ponies come to acclimate to their new lives, free of Sombra's tyranny at last. Industrialization continues apace with Equestria's help. Flurry Heart turned two years old, and Shining and Cadance are very happy together. We can only hope 1007 will be as good to us!"
CRY_the_way_of_harmony:0 "The Way Of Harmony"
CRY_the_way_of_harmony_desc:0 "##TODO, the Empire has had quite the conturbed and traumatic history, but, thankfully, help finally arrived to those living in these lands, with none of it being possible if it were not for harmony and the royal family. We simply must continue down this path, specially considering our recent reforms have already been greatly welcomed."
CRY_equestrian_tutelage:0 "Equestrian Tutelage"
CRY_equestrian_tutelage_desc:0 "##TODO, as much as the Crystal Empire has recovered ever since its return we are still missing the last few pushes in order to fully modernize this nation. To achieve this goal we simply need to work with Equestria, as they have the tools and resources necessary to fill the gaps in our capabilities."
CRY_crystal_bit:0 "Create The Crystal Bit"
CRY_crystal_bit_desc:0 "##TODO, if the Crystal Empire is ever to stand on its own we need to come up with our own currency, else who knows how our nation and economy would react if one day Equestria goes to the way of darkness?"
CRY_adopt_the_equestrian_bit:0 "Adopt The Equestrian Bit"
CRY_adopt_the_equestrian_bit_desc:0 "##TODO, trying to go it alone in something as important as our currency is not a good idea, we need to officially adopt the bit in order to make trade more seamless between our great nations, no need to shake the boat."
CRY_the_crystal_bank:0 "The Crystal Bank"

CRY_expand_our_agricultural_sector:0 "Tend To Our Agricultural Sector"
CRY_expand_our_agricultural_sector_desc:0 "##TODO, the Crystal Empire might not be known for its farms, but that doesn't mean we don't have the ability to further grow our own food. Some areas of the Empire are perfectly good for cultivation, and those that aren't can be made into something useful by our great pegasi."
CRY_increase_imports:0 "Increase Imports"
CRY_increase_imports_desc:0 "##TODO, we produce enough food to feed our current population, but as our Empire thrives it is obvious that our population will grow. With that in mind we should go with the safe option, that being to import more food from Equestria just in case."
CRY_entice_outsiders:0 "Attract Outsiders"
CRY_entice_outsiders_desc:0 "##TODO, with our expanded food base it wouldn't be hard to accomodate more creatures into our Empire. We should offer potential immigrants with cheaper housing and temporary benefits to convince them to come over."

CRY_on_our_own_hooves_desc:0 "##TODO, as much as we appreciate Equestria's help there is still a need for the Crystal Empire to truly stand on its own legs if we are to be respected as a legitimate sovereign nation. We will still ask our Equestrian allies for help, but we must also focus on developing ways to advance by ourselves."
CRY_multipolar_concept:0 "Multipolar Concept"
CRY_multipolar_concept_desc:0 "##TODO, The Crystal City is certainly the shining jewel of the Empire, but that does not mean we shouldn't make an effort to develop other sizeable communities around our realm.

CRY_develop_mi_amore_desc:0 "##TODO, Mi Amore lies in a spot that makes it perfect for development, if we were to help expand the city there is a possibility that in the far future it becomes as great as Cristal City itself due to the general proximity.

CRY_winter_solstice:0 "Winter Solstice"
CRY_winter_solstice_desc:0 "Having failed to host an official celebration of the Winter Solstice the year prior, it would please our people if we hold a bigger festival this year. Let's host the greatest Winter Solstice celebration that the Empire has ever seen!"
CRY_crystalling_anniversary:0 "Crystalling Anniversary"
CRY_crystalling_anniversary_desc:0 "Our people hold a soft spot for Princess Cadance's family, and her daughter, Flurry Heart, is no exception. A public celebration of Flurry's birthday will doubtlessly draw large crowds and invaluable support."

CRY_world_metropolis:0 "World Metropolis"

CRY_research_effort_desc:0 "##TODO, the only way to liberation of the old is with education and research, we must further fund our research institutes to make sure we can stand up against other powers in Equus."
CRY_equestrian_military_staff:0 "Equestrian Military Staff"

CRY_with_our_own_ponies_desc:0 "##TODO, if we wish to be taken seriously as a real nation we cannot rely on Equestrian help for everything, specially not when it comes to our own defence. We need to create an army with our own doctrines and tactics, one completely and genuinely ours."

CRY_combat_the_dark_spectre_desc:0 "##TODO, the crystal ponies still haven't forgotten about Sombra, and how could they? It was truly a horrible period to experience, but it is now time to combat this fear and any pony that might wish to bring this monster back."

CRY_volunteers_desc:0 "##TODO, even if we are strongly against direct intervention we should still think of the possibility of helping nations around the globe in their struggles, even if it means just sending a few volunteers and some loose pieces of equipment.

CRY_crystal_guard:0 "Expand The Crystal Guard"

CRY_crystal_canterlot_railway_desc:0 "When our nation returned, a rail line was constructed linking the Crystal City and Canterlot. As useful as this original line is, we can no longer get around the fact that relying on a single piece of track to transport millions of tons of goods and services every day is economic insanity. Roadways can never efficiently pick up this much slack, a new and larger rail network needs to be built."

CRY_under_their_wing_desc:0 "##TODO, we are going to break free gradually, slowly phasing out our dependence."
CRY_referendum:0 "#TODO BREAK FREE NOW"
CRY_referendum_desc:0 "##TODO, Equestria has been a great friend to us, but this does not mean we should forever be their vassal, or at least that's how a lot of ponies in the Crystal Empire are starting to see it as. A referendum shall be held to put this concern to bed." # TODO PODRICK REWRITE THIS
CRY_mi_amore_forever:0 "Mi Amore Forever"
CRY_mi_amore_forever_desc:0 "House Amore has proven itself time and time again. There is no longer a shred of doubt in the hearts of anyone that [Root.GetLeader] is the right monarch for the job. Indeed, they've become so popular that pollsters have been encouraged to stop asking people about the subject to prevent the appearance of tyranny or rigging. It's time we do something else to show our great love and affection for House Amore."
CRY_greater_economic_ties:0 "Greater Economic Ties"
CRY_greater_economic_ties_desc:0 "Since it is clear that Equestria's future is our future it must also be clear that our Crystalline ponies really love Equestrian stuff. From rifles to rototillers, we can't get enough of that sweet Equestrian merchandise. We should allow more Equestrian companies to invest in the Crystal Empire to cut down on shipping costs and further integrate our nations."
CRY_a_statement:0 "A Statement"
CRY_a_statement_desc:0 "##TODO, now that we are free to determine our own foreign policy we should begin to look for nations who may be greatly abusing their own citizens, it is time to take the fight to them for once."

CRY_prioritize_our_industry_desc:0 "##TODO, even if it might hurt us on the short term we cannot allow ourselves to become some kind of Equestrian economic zone, we must have industries of our own."
CRY_the_fifth_race:0 "The Fifth Tribe"
CRY_the_fifth_race_desc:0 "##TODO, the ponies of the Crystal Empire are unique in their own right, just as the tribes of Equestria are different from on another, it is time we start considering them a different and valid pony race."
CRY_a_part_of_something_greater:0 "A Part Of Something Greater"
CRY_a_part_of_something_greater_desc:0 "##TODO, the ponies of the Crystal Empire might look different, but functionally they're just an extension of already existing pony tribes, one must come to realize this reality."

CRY_the_riverside_industry_desc:0 "##TODO, the Crystal Empire isn't really known for its fish, and that is to be expected with most rivers of the nation being frozen, but with the return of the Heart and warmer climates in the south we could finally dig into this industry."

 # Sombra #
 CRY_the_king_of_monsters:0 "The King of Monsters"
 CRY_the_king_of_monsters_desc:0 ""At long last, I have returned. The Crystal Empire is mine, but I am not content with merely one realm - it is only right that I should rule over all nations. But there is much to do; my might and magic are no longer enough to conquer them. I shall have to assemble a royal court to assist me in this matter. With proper plans in place, I will not be overthrown a third time.""
 CRY_a_thousand_years_passed:0 "A Thousand Years Passed"
 CRY_a_thousand_years_passed_desc:0 ""A thousand years. It is hard to grasp. The very language has changed, with new words and new meanings for old words. Industrialization, socialism, logistics, tanks, planes... I know I have much to learn. But I will not dawdle. The world does not wait even for a King.""
 CRY_speed_tactics:0 "Maneuver Tactics"
 CRY_speed_tactics_desc:0 ""I have always known that war is won not by they who have the greatest might, but by they who seize the most valuable targets. What good would all their power have done Celestia and Luna if I had captured Canterlot and stood ready to slaughter their subjects? Surely they would have negotiated instead. That much has not changed, and I will use these 'trucks' to capture that which my enemies hold dear.""
 CRY_armored_recovery_vehicles:0 "The Best of Both Worlds"
 CRY_armored_recovery_vehicles_desc:0 ""With the emergence of both tanks and motorized infantry, I was naturally interested in combining them. Thus emerged what my scientists have dubbed the 'Infantry Fighting Vehicle'. It is still in its infancy but I trust this will someday be the backbone of the army.""
 CRY_armor_wonderweapons:0 "The Wonder of Armor"
 CRY_armor_wonderweapons_desc:0 ""Hah! These 'tanks' are majestic. Armored against attack, wielding weapons that would have taken a dozen archmages to match the power of, and swifter than a pegasus in flight. You will construct many of these iron monsters. Do not disappoint me.""
 CRY_big_guns_som:0 "Massive Cannons"
 CRY_big_guns_som_desc:0 ""Shortly before my banishment, a captured Equestrian tinkerer described what she called the 'cannon'. I had never had a chance to try it before the alicorns deposed me--until now. What a spectacular beast! Able to rain death on those leagues away, it will no doubt prove a force multiplier for my army.""
 CRY_the_common_soldier:0 "The Meat Grinder's Meat"
 CRY_the_common_soldier_desc:0 ""Some things have changed, but some never do. The simple infantry continues to be a core component of the army, guarding the more advanced equipment and pinning the enemy down. They may wield rifles instead of spears and pack shovels instead of shields, but I feel most at home here.""
 CRY_the_non_combat_tools:0 "More than Bullets"
 CRY_the_non_combat_tools_desc:0 ""When one of my advisors informed me of 'combat service support', I nearly enslaved him on the spot. Signals? Hospitals? Engineering? It is absurd that an army would need such baubles. But it seems in this modern age, such luxuries are universal and universally considered valuable. So be it.""
 CRY_conquer_the_skies:0 "Conquer the Skies"
 CRY_conquer_the_skies_desc:0 ""Great pegasi of metal--they tell me it is not iron, but another metal I have never heard of--now fly above us. While my magic can easily rip them from the sky, I can't be everywhere at once, and they are quite annoying. Thus I have reluctantly authorized the creation of so-called 'fighters' to guard my rightful sky.""
 CRY_rain_death_upon_them:0 "Rain Death Upon Them"
 CRY_rain_death_upon_them_desc:0 ""With the sky now mine, a beautiful new era can begin: an era of aerial bombardment. Before my banishment I experimented with pegasi dropping heavy stones on my foes. But this is far more efficient.""
 CRY_air_interdiction:0 "Raids of Terror"
 CRY_air_interdiction_desc:0 ""A larger bomber, carrying a heavier payload, would be able to strike deep behind enemy lines and crush their supply depots. With no food, what soldier could hold out? See that this is developed.""
 CRY_oceanic_ambitions:0 "Crossing the Grand Oceans"
 CRY_oceanic_ambitions_desc:0 ""At last, I have reached the seas. This represents potential, but also danger. An enemy could strike me where I was not expecting it. So I will do unto them as they would do unto me, and do it first.""
 CRY_or_a_day_for_them:0 "A Day for Them"
 CRY_or_a_day_for_them_desc:0 ""My subjects have not changed much - perhaps because I took them with me. But their protests and moaning have new terminology, 'creature rights' foremost among their demands. Creature rights. What an amusing concept. They speak of rights? There is only one right that matters--the right of strength.""
 CRY_the_genius_that_is_me:0 "An Evil Genius"
 CRY_the_genius_that_is_me_desc:0 ""Genius? Yes... I like that descriptor. I am among the mightiest mages ever to have lived, and I am already using that power to its fullest extent. But it is not enough. I will learn everything about everything, and in doing so master it all.""
 CRY_scientist_clique:0 "Research for Freedom"
 CRY_scientist_clique_desc:0 ""Many among my subjects are talented scholars, administrators, and tacticians in their own right. I will permit them and their families freedom, and even slaves of their own, in exchange for service. A resurrection of the old system of nobility under Amore, in a way, but redesigned to serve me. Fitting.""
 CRY_unchained_ambition:0 "Unchained Ambition"
 CRY_unchained_ambition_desc:0 ""Let me be clear: this world is mine. Not because of my parents' lineage, nor my species. It is mine because I want it and am strong enough to seize it! I will break all that stand against me, and force the rest to kneel. Nothing will stand in my way.""
 CRY_but_my_enemies_have_not_rested:0 "My Enemies Have Not Rested"
 CRY_but_my_enemies_have_not_rested_desc:0 ""Celestia. Luna. Chrysalis. [STG.GetLeader]. Some names I know all too well, others I have only just heard of. They are united in one thing, however. They all want my head on a pike. And if there is a truly absolute law in our world of chaos and misery, it is this: do unto others as they would do unto you and do it first.""

 newcrystals.1.t:0 "Family Time"
 newcrystals.1.d:0 "The new year had barely begun. There was a kind of taste in the air most associated with potential. Everycreature knew that with the new year came new hope. Wishes, resolutions, aspirations. And everycreature knew, of course, that most didn't see fruition. But even still, wasn't it such a pretty thing to hope? That was what it meant to be a crystal pony, Cadance thought, to love and hope without reservation. No matter what. If Shining Armor had resolved to defend what he loved, Cadence had resolved to nurture a healthy future for what she loved. Whom she loved.\n\nFlurry Heart played around in the indoor royal gardens, picking flowers to make a crown for the three of them. It was much too cold for the outdoor gardens to hold much in the way of workable plantstuffs, but here, within the castle's warmth, warmth of the heart could also be shared. The royal couple sat on a bench, more than happy to let their child play around with their manes, even if it meant getting a few stems stuck in there. They all giggled along. Merriment was in abundance for the family, especially around this time of the year.\n\nWhat was harmony? Cadance bounced the question around in her head. As stalwart in being its protector she was, the concept was sometimes remarkably difficult to define. There were ideals of cohesion and stability as ideological foundations, but figuring out what that really meant concretely was an entirely different matter. Was harmony peace? No, it couldn't be. After all, harmony meant having to fight sometimes. To the bitter end, if necessary. What, then, was harmony? As Cadance looked at her little filly playing around, the answer to her question hit her right in the face. Harmony was to love those around oneself, fully and unequivocally. If harmony was anything, it was this. Happiness with her family."
 newcrystals.1.a:0 "To another thousand years, may love prosper evermore!"

 newcrystals.2.t:0 "A Fifth Tribe"

 newcrystals.3.t:0 "The Changeling Exiles"
 newcrystals.3.d:0 "#TODO: Shining Armor meets with some exiled changeling harmonists, maybe even Thorax himself. He reassures them that nopony is bigoted against them simply because of their species, and they're safe here in the Crystal Empire."
 newcrystals.3.a:0 "Together to stop Chrysalis."

 newcrystals.4.t:0 "The Referendum" # TODO REWRITE 
 newcrystals.4.d:0 "#TODO: A referendum is held to decide the fate of the Crystal Empire. In a steep majority, they reject remaining a puppet. Cadance is surprised, but promises to honor the results and draft their independence request to Equestria."
 newcrystals.4.a:0 "Now we wait."

 newcrystals.5.t:0 "How Far We've Come" # we had a referendum
 newcrystals.5.d:0 "#TODO: Cadance reflects on the fate of the Crystal Empire, now standing on its own as a fully free nation. It feels good. The referendum passed, but Equestria will always be their friend. She spends time with her husband, happily together, before writing to Celestia."
 newcrystals.5.a:0 "Dear Princess Celestia..."

 newcrystals.6.t:0 "How Far We've Come" # we didn't have a referendum
 newcrystals.6.d:0 "#TODO: Cadance reflects on the fate of the Crystal Empire, now standing on its own as a fully free nation. It feels good. Despite maintaining close ties, Equestria chose to recognize them as free simply because of all their great contributions. She spends time with her husband, happily together, before writing to Celestia."
 newcrystals.6.a:0 "Dear Princess Celestia..."

 newcrystals.7.t:0 "Party Planning"
 newcrystals.7.d:0 "##TODO, event where Cadance is speaking to Shining Armour about he helping to supervise and coordinate a few events she is setting up, namely stuff like the Northern Gala and the Crystalling, specially that latter one since he kinda needs to be there in the first place. Shining makes a joking comment about how much he wished Pinkie Pie was here to help them, which Cadance chuckles at."
 newcrystals.7.a:0 "Let's get these parties started."

 newcrystals.8.t:0 "Millenary Issues"
 newcrystals.8.d:0 "##TODO, event with Cadance, Shining Armour, and Sunburst. Sunburst explains a few of the issues still haunting the Crystal Empire, mostly stuff related to how modernization isn't quite there yet for areas of the empire from what he has seen. Meanwhile Shining reports on how the army could use some reforms and how there still plenty of training to do to get these crystal ponies into shape for any possible future war. Cadance simply listens to both as she takes the information in."
 newcrystals.8.a:0 "We can do this."

 newcrystals.9.t:0 "Getting Them Into Shape"
 newcrystals.9.d:0 "##TODO, even with Shining Armour where he meets with the newest rookies of the Crystal Guard after the most recent expansion to the force, he is cordial and friendly but is quick to correct them once they start acting too out of line due to thinking they could take advantage of his friendliness."
 newcrystals.9.a:0 "Here we're not friends."

 newcrystals.10.t:0 "An Offer From The Crystal Empire"
 newcrystals.10.d:0 "##TODO (GENERIC POV), representatives from the Crystal Empire have approached our administrations seeing if we would be interested in purchasing some crystals."

 newcrystals.12.d:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] rejected our crystal trade offer."
 newcrystals.12.a:0 "It's over."


 newcrystals.13.t:0 "Rumors of Suspicious Activity"
 newcrystals.13.d:0 "Shining Armor furrowed his brow as he read the report before him: "Local pony says neighbors are plotting something. Claims to have heard them say something about King Sombra." He sighed. The Crystal City police have investigated dozens of reports about this by now, though all have led to nothing. He wanted to chalk this up to paranoia, and yet...\n\nShining put a hoof to his temple. He had resigned from the Equestrian Royal Guard to avoid headaches like these, especially since the job had required him to spend so much time away from his wife and daughter, yet those same headaches were now popping up left and right here. Was regular old paranoia really something he needed to worry about, though? \n\nHe took the report and cross-examined it with others he had gotten over the weeks, looking for any details that might indicate that there was something more going on. The Crystal Empire was his home now, and he needed to be vigilant to protect it. If nothing else, confirming that these were just rumors would quell his worries.\n\nJust as he was about ready to dismiss this report, he noticed something: a matching description between two separate reports. Both described a 'pale amethyst crystal unicorn' as a suspicious individual.\n\nShining felt a pit in his stomach as he envisioned the idea of normal, ordinary ponies trying to bring about the return of King Sombra. The same king who had enslaved them all and cursed this land for a millennium. Surely, this had to be a coincidence, right? He bit his tongue as he tried to weigh the merit of looking into this. He didn't want to waste more time looking for something that wasn't there. After all, it was about time to head to the park with Cadance and Flurry Heart, and he didn't want to worry them.\n\nHe reached for the phone and considered what to tell his subordinate to relay to the Crystal City police."
 newcrystals.13.a:0 "Keep an eye out for ponies causing trouble, but this isn't a top priority."
 newcrystals.13.b:0 "We're not taking any chances. Launch a full investigation immediately."

 newcrystals.14.t:0 "Planning The Celebration"
 newcrystals.14.d:0 "##TODO, event about Cadance preparing the nation for the Winter Solstice, which will happen later that year, perhaps she could be asking Shining and Spike for help to set up everything that is necessary for the event in time."
 newcrystals.14.a:0 "We still have time."
 
 newcrystals.15.t:0 "The Winter Solstice Celebration"
 newcrystals.15.d2:0 "##TODO, event where the Winter Solstice is happening, but so is the Equestrian Civil War! Oh no."
 newcrystals.15.d2:0 "##TODO, event where the Winter Solstice is happening, could have a wholesome scene between Shining and Cadance where the former is comforting her due to how stressful it has been to be the ruling princess of the Crystal Empire. But in the end she says she wouldn't trade it for the world, and that she is certain to continue making this realm better."
 newcrystals.15.a:0 "A great Solstice."

 newcrystals.16.t:0 "The Northern Gala"
 newcrystals.16.d:0 "##TODO, event where the Northern Gala is being held, the attendance is much greater than expected, but obviously this isn't a bad thing, seems like the Crystal Empire will have a great year."

 newcrystals.21.d:0 "#TODO: Princess Cadance invites random ponies to the crystal palace, letting them see how things work and what it's like. They are awed, and very happy with how approachable she is - she's just like them, she didn't grow up a princess!"
 newcrystals.21.a:0 "Woohoo."


 crystalsombra.1.t:0 "Your Story - A Peculiar Pony"
 crystalsombra.1.d:0 "Your arrival in Crystal City occurred without celebration, thankfully. You were never one for parties, though your friends and family had insisted on giving you a "going away" cake. They had all wished you good luck with your new job at Star Energy, an Equestrian electrical company. Bringing the Crystal Empire's ancient society up to speed with modern technology was an ever-ongoing process—one that you were excited to help with.\n\nYour job was set to begin next week, so you had some time to kill. There was a small souvenir shop near your apartment that had caught your eye, so you figured you could peruse its wares in hopes of finding something to help decorate your rather sparse living space.\n\nUpon entering the store, you were greeted by an overwhelming multitude of crystal-themed trinkets and baubles. It was hard to pick out something to direct your eyes to, especially since the antique building had not yet been wired for electrical lighting. The overhead lanterns were hardly sufficient to determine what anything was from afar, though one thing did catch your eye: a painting on the wall. You approached it, noticing that it depicted the defeat of the evil King Sombra by Princess Cadance and Spike "the Brave and Glorious."\n\n"It's sad, isn't it?" The feminine voice, though soft, caught you off guard enough to jump slightly. You turned to see a rather pretty crystal pony also looking at the painting. You asked if she was the shopkeeper. She nodded and introduced herself as Cherry Bluebell. You then asked her why the painting was sad.\n\nHer expression was somber. "A long time ago, the pony who would become the cruel monster in that painting was just a scared little colt. He didn't want to be evil, though forces outside of his control made him that way. But there was still good in him, locked deep away."\n\nYou told Cherry that this sounded preposterous. If he was good on the inside, then why did the crystal heart destroy him? Good ponies don't die like that.\n\nHer smile was kind, though her eyes were filled with sadness. "He was too far gone, but..." She looked away and bit her tongue, then returned her gaze to yours, "...there might still be hope. Here," She placed a small card into your hoof. "If you want to learn about the true story of Sombra from the pony who knew him best, then come to this meeting in a few days.""
 crystalsombra.1.a:0 "You decide to attend the meeting."
 crystalsombra.1.b:0 "You decide not to go. After all, Sombra is pure evil. Everypony knows this."

 crystalsombra.2.t:0 "Your Story - History Lesson"
 crystalsombra.2.d:0 "All things considered, you're not sure that this was the best idea. Attending a strange meeting in a secluded section of the public library was already questionable enough, but you were also held up at the entrance by one of the attendees who believed you to be an undercover police officer. It wasn't until Cherry Bluebell arrived that you were let in, as she vouched for your legitimacy as a genuinely curious foreigner who had recently moved here.\n\nWait, how did she know you had just moved here? As you were processing that thought, hushes came over the small crowd of about twenty. They were mostly younger individuals, but none were foals. Then, a hooded pony arrived from... seemingly nowhere. You blinked; trying to figure out how they got here. Illusion magic, maybe? The others seemed to know they were about to appear, so...\n\n"Thank you all for coming," began the hooded figure, "I'm sorry that we had to abandon our last meeting location... there are ponies looking for me. And if they find me, well..." Their voice trailed off. Suddenly, they turned their head toward you and a few others, "...though I see we have new friends." Alarms began to go off in your head. Ponies were looking for this mysterious character? What have you gotten yourself into?\n\nThe hooded pony then removed their disguise, revealing an amethyst crystal unicorn. She was rather pretty, you'd say. "My name is Radiant Hope," Her smile was kind, but you could see the tiredness behind it. "A long time ago, I knew Sombra when he was a foal. He wasn't the terrible monster everypony claims he is, but... his fate was to be evil, even though I know he didn't want to be. We were best friends. We were... almost more than that. But then fate came and demanded he obey, and I wasn't strong enough to save him."\n\nAfter taking a moment to gather herself, Radiant Hope continued. "When Sombra was banished by the Equestrian alicorns, he cursed the Crystal Empire to vanish with him. The curse would last a thousand years, longer than I would live, so... I resorted to traveling to the Fairy World where Sombra's kind—the Umbrum—lived. There I existed without aging, waiting for the day Sombra would return... but I was too late. I missed his return, and... he was killed."\n\nShe sniffled a bit, then turned her attention to the newcomers. "Sombra isn't a normal pony, though. He's special. Even though he's dead, I know that he can still be saved. That's why I'm asking you all here to help me. I know that we can find that innocent colt who never wanted to hurt anypony and bring him back. And to do that, well... first I need your names.""
 crystalsombra.2.a:0 "Radiant Hope faced you directly. "So, what's your name?""

 crystalsombra.3.t:0 "Your Story - Future Perfect"
 crystalsombra.3.d:0 "#TODO: Now, Radiant says that it's still possible to resurrect him. His horn was lost, but not destroyed, and as long as it exists, he can be brought back. But she needs our help. She's presumed dead by the world, and that's critical to her safety. But she absolutely wants to save his spirit. To bring the good that's inside him out. As the meeting wraps up, she looks at you personally and says that she just wants to give him one more chance. You head home, and think about what to do."
 crystalsombra.3.a:0 "Maybe she's right. He deserves a chance, right?"

 crystalsombra.17.t:0 "The Battle of the Crystal Palace"
 crystalsombra.17.d:0 "It was like a deluge. Pure, unadulterated power. The Royal Guard fired their weapons at the shadowy mass pouring through them, but each and every little wound they inflicted immediately disappeared. A pony stood behind the magical power, focusing all of her magic onto him. She whispered apologies beneath her breath to nobody. Her tears were not consequential to anyone present. Each snapshot of consciousness echoed against another pony dead. One after another, the guards fell to the magic of the King.\n\nHe cackled. This was his great victory. It wasn't even a real fight, no, this was a parade. He flaunted himself about, his mind-controlled followers taking their positions around the city. Every organ of government would be his. They already were, for all intents and purposes. Former life littered the ground, future fertiliser for the gardens he'd grow in his new castle. He only laughed more. It was the last sound every member of the Royal guard heard, blinking out one by one. This was a thousand years in the making, and he was going to enjoy every second of it.\n\nFor his healer, Radiant Hope, the only one to whom he'd consider granting the key to his heart, things were not so pleasant. She didn't want this. But what choice did she have? Her whispered apologies were only faintly heard by few over the commotion, and not long before their own deaths. Were it not for her actions, how else would her beloved be free? How else could justice be found? There had not been an iota of thought that her beloved would have subdued the Empire. But even now, she had to protect him, heal him, support him. She loved him. She was sorry, but she loved him so much."
 crystalsombra.17.a:0 "It wasn't long before they reached the Throne Room."

 crystalsombra.18.t:0 "Triumph I"
 crystalsombra.18.d:0 "The throne felt perfect. It wasn't just the physical sensation of comfort that bristled through Sombra's body as he sat down, but the mental relief of victory washing over him. The 'battle', whose procession had been more akin to a massacre, was over. He was the King of Monsters, the sole autocrat worthy of this power. Standing at the head of the institution that once tortured him, his will extended over the Empire.\n\nThrough his suffering, he had been tempered into the finest steel to grace all of Equus, perhaps the world itself. So stood his ego, embellished and enshrined as the psychopomp for an erstwhile harmony. The new order was here, and it wasn't going anywhere. Forever, the Empire was his. No one would hurt him ever again. Not him, not his beloved. He, as King, claimed his right as absolute sovereign. Not by the weakness of diluted bloodlines, not by the fantasy of the governed's consent, but by the authority from which all other authority derived: violence.\n\nThis was the supreme right by which he would govern. And his first act would be to cement it. The last dredges of Amore, the first of his chains he cast off, still resided in this castle. Worthless creatures. They would see his magnificence in their final moments.\n\n"Go, fetch the former royals," he barked at a castle servant.\n\nThe servant sputtered off with a contingent of guards loyal to the new monarch. It wasn't long before they returned with Mi Amore Cadenza and Shining Armor, shackled and beaten. The King of Monsters barely glanced in their direction, a wicked grin about his face. He paid no mind to the growing concern in Radiant Hope, merely metres away. No, this was his triumph. He would savour it."
 crystalsombra.18.a:0 ""Kneel," Sombra commanded."

 crystalsombra.19.t:0 "Triumph II"
 crystalsombra.19.d:0 "Both royals looked at each other. A moment stretched outwards into eternity. It was said that love connected all creatures, and in that moment it had connected both wife and husband. Without exchanging a word, novels were spoken between them. Steeling themselves, they turned forward once again. They would make their stand here. If the Empire was to be lost to tyranny, they would still defend it to its last. They would not be Sombra's slaves. Never would they kneel.\n\nThe King of Monsters was enraged by this brazen display of disobedience. The Throne was his, Imperial authority flowed from his blood alone. How dare they still defy him? They still stood against him, still spat on his dignity, as they did so long ago when he was but a clueless foal. He stood, growling in their direction as he galloped forwards.\n\n"How dare you!" he snarled. "That was an order. I will have your heads for this."\n\n"Wait!" Radiant Hope exclaimed, rushing out from the sidelines. "Sombra, this isn't you. They're beaten, they're not your enemies anymore. They don't need to die."\n\nSombra hesitated for only a moment. His hatred for their bloodline, for what they represented, flowed freely. They deserved this. Every ounce of pain they'd inflicted on him, every disgrace, would be repaid a hundredfold. He imagined the vindication, the thrill. All he needed to do was make them submit. Then, his true victory would be complete. His anger overflowed as he stepped past Radiant Hope, staring at the defiant royals. His rage was a cold one, devoid of compromise or reason.\n\n"Kneel, or I'll go get your worthless little foal and kill them in front of you," he stated."
 crystalsombra.19.a:0 "The former royals fell to their knees immediately."
 crystalsombra.19.b:0 "The former royals looked at each other, then advanced on Sombra."

 crystalsombra.20.t:0 "Triumph III"
 crystalsombra.20.d:0 "These symbols of so-called 'harmony' fell into blubbering messes so easily. Sombra grinned as they grovelled at his feet, crying out so that Flurry Heart could live. They offered a public abdication, their lives, everything they could. The new monarch only grew more manic by the moment. This was everything he had wanted and more. His triumph, his glory, his truest victory complete.\n\nEverything had fallen into place. The creatures in the city clamoured for a renaissance, a return to the glory of the golden age of the Empire. He would answer their call, not these pathetic creatures before him. In his right hoof materialised his blade. Stepping forward, each graze against the floor echoed through the room. He raised the sword, already savouring the satisfying rush to come.\n\n"SOMBRA!" Radiant Hope cried out as she ran in front of him. "It's over," she whispered, laying a hoof on him. "It's over," she repeated.\n\nHe looked between her and the royals, still grovelling, and huffed. With a herculean effort, he lowered his weapon and turned away from them. "You're right, my beloved," he said, "I've already won. There's no reason to stain the carpets here." Turning on the about, his voice raised to a shout, "GUARDS! See to it that our former royal family is imprisoned. Throw away the key," he said, walking out of the throne room towards the balcony.\n\nSo many ponies were there. The victorious, the loyal. Everycreature under his reign who accepted his truth, his rejuvenation , would find themselves rewarded. He would build an Empire for those who yearned for the glory days. His days. His right hoof raised to the sky. "THE FUTURE IS WON!" he shouted to the crowd gathered.\n\nThey cheered back, and soon, a chant emerged above all the rest."
 crystalsombra.20.a:0 ""HAIL SOMBRA, LONG LIVE THE KING!""

 crystalsombra.21.t:0 "A Death A Millennium Overdue"
 crystalsombra.21.d:0 "He had threatened their daughter. There was no doubt as to what had to be done. Maybe they weren't going to make it out of here. Maybe. But they would take the King of Monsters down one way or another. For the Empire. For their daughter. Mi Amore Cadenza and her husband Shining Armor stepped forward. Cadance knew that the power of an alicorn was no small thing. With their powers combined, they would vanish this darkness. As their horns began to glow, magic melded and intermixed.\n\nThe science of magic was a difficult thing to understand. Thaumaturgical research in the sense of the modern scientific method was, in truth, in its infancy. But in the oral traditions of the Empire, love itself was often considered magical. There was something inherently ineffable about the experience of adoration, not simply of another creature, but of one's community, friends, life itself even. There was power in that love; the kind that could vanquish the strongest hatred. In that maxim did the lovers' faith lie.\n\nGuards moved inwards, weapons drawn. But they would make little impact. As they closed in on the pair, even as some raised their weapons to fire, it all happened so fast. The King's lover, too, stepped forward. What little warning there was came to an abrupt end as quickly as it came, only a few seconds having passed between the first steps and the glow coalescing, ready to seek its quarry.\n\nOne, singular beam crackled outwards. A shockwave hit the room as the sound barrier was demolished by the photonic volley. It searched for its target, the King of Monsters, the life which it would render asunder. And it found life. Eviscerated it. That life had been Radiant Hope, who had stepped in front of her lover to protect him.\n\nShe fell to the ground, scarlet spreading across the floor."

"You're okay? That's— that's good…!"\n\n"I'm okay, you saved me! You did, my love. And I'm going to save you too, so just hang on. Please, just a little longer."\n\n"No, no. It's..." she trailed off, limply falling against his hold, "It's okay. I helped. I helped. I love..." she smiled. It was the last thing she said. Her last breath left her.\n\nThere was nothing Sombra could do. He was a destroyer, a warrior, not a healer. She had been the healer. She was the one who had put him back together. She had been someone worth fighting for. If love was magical, she had been his source. The room was still, nobody moved, nobody dared to. Finally, Sombra snapped upwards, his gaze locked on the former royal couple.\n\n"You killed her!" Sombra screamed. His stocky, stilted phonemes sloughed off of his vocal cords with little enthusiasm. They could barely leave him between his tears.\n\n"I didn't mean to!" Cadance insisted. "It was you! We were going to kill you!"\n\n"SHUT UP!" he shouted back. "She would have resurrected me, made me spare you, she was everything you aren't. You..." he said, losing his will to say anything more. He stepped forward. He would tend to his beloved's body later, after he avenged her. Dragging the pair out to the balcony, crowds of supporters greeted him. A new era was upon them, but not for Sombra.\n\nThrowing them down, he took his blade and raised it towards the sky. In front of the world, he would have his revenge. They took everything from him. His sole regret was that he could only kill them once. The lovers embraced each other, killed in the same swing of his sword. The crowd cheered. He did not share their excitement."

"I do enjoy a good view," he mused, "It makes it all the better that everything I behold belongs to me."\n\n"Yes, it does." Sombra instantly recognized the voice as Radiant Hope's. She joined him to look over the brilliant city. Sombra noted that she wasn't smiling - she hadn't smiled much lately.\n\n"Why do you look out there, Hope? It only seems to upset you."\n\nHope didn't meet his eyes. "I heard that you had executed a particularly troublesome rebel."\n\n"Of course," Sombra stated with a hint of surprise, "You know as well as I do that there can be no opposition to my rule. And now, there isn't."\n\n"That's good," Hope deadpanned, "So now we've won, right? We can live here happily together?"\n\n"Well, not quite yet. We need to expand the empire, so at some point, we will make plans to attack Equestria, Stalliongrad, and others who might threaten us."\n\nHope looked absolutely dejected. "Oh, so then you'll be done?"\n\nSombra turned to face her, shocked at her remarks. "Hope, this is only the beginning! Then there's the yaks and the griffons! And even beyond them, there are other threats!"\n\nThere was silence between them for some time. A tear fell down Hope's cheek as she turned to look at him. "I know you won't change your mind on your goals, but... can you promise me something?" Hope paused, trying to stifle a crying fit, "Can you promise me that you'll at least try to be better?

"The workers of Stalliongrad have officially ended all trade with the Crystal Empire, my king."\n\nKing Sombra leaned forward from his throne, confusion abundant on his face and in his voice. "What do you mean, 'the workers?' Where's their monarch, or equivalent?"\n\n"Well, um, they don't have one. Stalliongrad's authority lies with the common pony. They believe in an idea called 'communism', which means that the, ah, well, everything is owned collectively by the whole and distributed evenly to all, and that every worker has an equal say in determining how the government is run. Even their elected official is one such worker."\n\n"You mean to tell me that this nation is run by... peasants?"\n\nThe servant looked increasingly nervous as she tried to explain. "Well, their elected official represents all, even the most destitute, but basically, yes."\n\nFor a moment, Sombra stared at her, incredulous. Then, he tilted his head back and exploded with wild laughter. His body shook, and he doubled over, smashing his hoof on his throne. When he finally finished laughing, he wheezed. "'Communism'... Hah! That's new. Never, in all my years, have I heard anything so unbelievably stupid. To think that a mere peasant would be able to sit upon a throne and command other peasants around, it's hilariously insane."\n\nThe servant bit her tongue. "Well, my king, they do earnestly believe that the system works. And their ideas are... infectious, to say the least."\n\nSombra waved a hoof dismissively, still recovering from his bout of laughter. "It's obviously a ploy by whoever leads them to make their slaves believe that they have power. Anyone who seriously believes in the idea of 'communism' must be the biggest sucker in the world." He cleared his throat, having finally caught his breath, "I almost want to meet their 'elected official' and share a laugh over how they've played their underlings."\n\n"Well, um, their embassy here in Crystal City is still intact, if you want to organize a meeting."\n\n"Is that so?"

She'd tried having heart-to-heart talks. She'd tried having patience. She'd even tried compromising. It was only after one crying fit at another atrocity he had committed that she had a horrible, heartbreaking realization: Sombra was, at best, placating her. He had no intention of ever truly committing to her wishes.\n\nTears streamed down Hope's eyes as all of the bottled emotions she had stuffed down surfaced at once. "I thought you cared about me!

This wasn't the life that she wanted, to rule others through fear and suffering. She latched onto what Sombra had just said: he cared about her. Things were so terrible right now; she no longer had a choice in what to do. There was only one option, one way that could fix everything. But deep down, she was afraid that she already knew what the outcome would be. "Sombra, this ends NOW. It's me, or your precious Crystal Empire. What do you want more?"\n\nSombra stared at the only pony that had ever cared about him for what seemed like an eternity to both of them. Eventually, he broke more than just the silence.

The former royal couple's housekeepers had attempted to escape, but were now mind-controlled and forced to continue their work. Many of the guards had suffered a similar fate, though far more of them had died in the fighting than he would have liked.\n\nAs for the former royal couple, Sombra would have loved to make a mocking display of their corpses, but truth be told, he was not in the best mood. Sure, he had gotten what he wanted, but...\n\nHe looked at the smaller, empty throne next to him. Radiant Hope wasn't here to enjoy this victory with him.

She was quite literally bouncing off the walls with excitement, for today was Saturday, and Saturday meant that she got the whole day to play with Dad!\n\nEventually, she couldn't wait any longer. She opened her door and rushed out into the main hall of the castle, looking for her father. The two housekeepers she whizzed past nearly toppled over, earning her an amused glance from one and an annoyed glare from the other. Soon enough, she reached her parents' bedroom and went inside, only to see...\n\n"Daddy, it's Saturday! We're supposed to play today! Why do you have your working clothes on?" Flurry Heart frowned as she saw her father checking his outfit in the mirror.\n\nShining Armor sighed, "I know, Flurry, I know. It's just... things have gotten very complicated lately, and something came up. Dad needs to make sure that the Crystal Empire is safe for you and your mom."\n\n"But... but..."\n\nShining turned to address his daughter. "I'm sorry, Flurry, I really am. You remember the stories I used to tell you about Queen Stinkybug?" He watched her nod, "Well... she was just one bad guy. There's more just like her, and we need to be ready for them." He paused, hoping that his explanation would placate her, but her disappointed expression was still there. "I don't know when I'll be back, but what do you say to some ice cream once I'm finished with work? Would you like that?"\n\nFlurry's eyes went wide as she got an idea. If she couldn't play with her dad, then... "I don't wanna wait! Can I watch you work? Pretty please?! I pinkie promise I'll be quiet!"\n\nShining was caught off guard by her request. He supposed that, technically, the castle's war room was still a part of his house, and Cadance had instructed him to keep her inside the house while she was out dealing with foreign dignitaries... but if his wife found out that he brought Flurry to a military strategy meeting, she would have his head.\n\nThen again, didn't Flurry make some friends at school recently? He could try to arrange a playdate where they could come to the castle."

 crystalnews.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]While King Sombra has been dead for years, his ghost remained to be exorcised--until today. After years of searching, the Crystal Empire has arrested the ringlander of a secret society devoted to his resurrection, his childhood friend Radiant Hope. Hope has sworn that she never wanted to hurt anypony, that she only wanted to save her best friend from the darkness inside him, but she is still facing decades in prison for conspiracy and treason. In her arrest, Sombra's horn (which is key to reviving him) was also captured, although Hope made a deal with her captors--in return for the names and locations of every cultist involved, his horn would be placed in secure storage instead of destroyed. The Crystal Royals agreed, and Sombra's horn is now being kept at a secret location under guard.\n\nWith the Sombra cult now completely defunct, the Crystal Ponies can rest easy that he will never enslave them again."

#### DESCS
POLITICS_CADENZA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 14th of February 972, near Vanhoover\n\n§YBiography§!: Princess Cadance's humble origins belie her future as one of the royal alicorns of Equestria. The pegasus foal, who would later become known as Princess Mi Amore Cadenza, was found in a forest close to Vanhoover by her earth pony adopted parents. Taken to a nearby village, it was a peaceful, calm life until one day, a jealous sorceress named Prismia stole the love of the villagers using a malevolent magical necklace. The young Cadance confronted Prismia and turned her own magic against her, causing her to change her horrible ways. Afterward, Princess Celestia recognised her power, adopted her as her niece and elevated Cadance as the alicorn Princess of Love.\n\nThereafter, Cadance became a foalsitter for Princess Celestia's newest personal student, Twilight Sparkle. She would meet and fall in love with Twilight's older brother, Shining Armour. Their wedding day was going to be perfect, but unfortunately, the scheming Chrysalis, Queen of the Changelings used the opportunity to impersonate Cadance and seize control of Equestria by guile. Despite the presence of a large changeling host and their empowered Queen, Princess Cadance and Shining Armour used the power of their love to cast the changelings out of the country.\n\nWhen the Crystal Empire reappeared, Celestia sent Cadance to rule over it, knowing her to be a descendant of Princess Amore, its last ruler before Sombra's reign. Cadance made her stand there, defeating the nascent shadow of King Sombra that lingered after his banishment by using a mythical artefact called the Crystal Heart. With their success, she and Shining Armour have safekept the land ever since, siring a foal named Flurry Heart along the way.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
POLITICS_SOMBRA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography§!: Sombra's origins are as mysterious as the mere mention of his name is unsettling. What is known, however, comes from the testimony of crystal ponies who were willing enough to speak. He is one of the umbrum — shadow ponies rumoured to be buried under the frozen wastelands of the Crystal Empire, waiting to be released. Some say it was loneliness and dejection that turned him bitter and jaded, striking out against Princess Amore, while others say that it was his only friend and companion, Radiant Hope, who turned Sombra to darkness.\n\nWhat followed is known to everypony: the tyrannical King Sombra used dark magic of the umbrum to enslave the crystal ponies, using many for his personal experiments. His reign of terror only came to an end once the Princesses of Equestria banished him beneath the ice, only for Sombra to curse his land to disappear along with him. After a thousand years, his shadowy form made an attempt to take over again, only to be thwarted by the combined efforts of Princess Cadance and the bearers of the Elements of Harmony.\n\nIt is uncertain whether the most recent reincarnation of King Sombra is the same pony from the myths, but one thing is sure: The King is back.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

She would deny him nothing, and he can no longer stand denying her. The only thing to plan is the wedding."

TWILIGHT_DESC:0 "The latest ascendant to Alicornhood, Princess Twilight Sparkle is the Element of Magic, former protégé of Princess Celestia and saviour of Equestria. Her meteoric rise to fame and success is attributed to her resolve in spreading the magic of friendship wherever she went, and in the process corrected many wrongs and even converted some former antagonists to the Equestrian cause. She is also one of the most brilliant mages of the time, having invented and perfected many spells and arcane methods. Yet Twilight Sparkle remains as humble as the day she first set hoof in Ponyville, preferring the company of her friends and family rather than dealing with the minutiae of bureaucracy. \n\nRecent events, however, have left her greatly saddened, and she has accepted the rulership of the Crystal Empire. And even though there are many who dislike the Monarchy as a ruling system, very few ponies can say anything negative about Twilight Sparkle, who is the living embodiment of how much you can achieve with friendship and kindness."
CRY_Shining_Armour_desc:0 "The older brother to Twilight Sparkle, Shining Armour is the Prince of Crystal Empire and Captain of the Royal Canterlot Guard. A shy and reclusive pony in his youth, many things changed for him after he met his future wife, Princess Cadance. From there, he quickly rose through the ranks and eventually proposed to Cadance. Unfortunately, his marriage day was almost ruined by Queen Chrysalis' schemes, but through the power of love, he and Cadance expelled the changelings from Canterlot. Afterward, they were appointed rulers of the resurgent Crystal Empire, guarding it from the dark forces of King Sombra. He is stern, but fair, and the troops under his command greatly appreciate his father-figure behaviour and unwavering dedication to the defence of Equestria. Sworn to protect everything he cares for, Shining Armour will fight to the end to protect his wife, child and Equestria from the clutches of Chrysalis."

cry_wondermane_desc:0 "Wondermane's origins are nested in an obscure village on the edges of southeastern Equestrian jungles. She has shown proficiency in the field of magic from an early age. Although timid and introverted by nature, her fellow ponies encouraged her talent, resulting in Wondermane having a chance to attend a prestigious school in Baltimare. While her academic performance was not always stellar, Wondermane's natural drive and determination led her to discover her exceptional talent in combat magic. Soon afterwards, she was recommended to the newly formed Equestrian unicorn corps.\n\nEven with her pacifist tendencies, Wondermane has shown herself to be capable in the field. Eventually rising to the top of her command, she was one of the first military personnel to be assigned to the recently returned Crystal Empire. The frigid north suits Wondermane more than her native jungles ever had."
solidshot_desc:0 "The adopted son of a moderately elevated family in the Crystal Empire, Solid Shot used his familial connections and natural gifts as a markspony to secure an officer's commission in the army. Promoted to general in his early thirties, his extremely fast promotions led to rumours that he had secured such as much through seduction and nepotism as skill. Very self interested, his loyalties are fickle at best, but he is, none the less, a gifted officer."

cry_ice_desc:0 "Ice is a Lieutenant Colonel, formerly of Equestria, now serving under the Crystal Empire. Having worked as a Winter Specialist due to his extremely aggressive nature in northern climates, he was mostly tasked with putting down border skirmishes near Stalliongrad, until he voluntarily joined the Crystal Army.\n\nWhile being caring to the ponies under him, he offers little care to hostile forces. His thoughts are based around one thing. The continuous attack of a enemy line. He holds his troops to the highest. At the same time, he holds airpower as key to his plans, and uses it religiously.\n\nIce is a only child, and his family spent a lot of time around him. When it came to be known to them he wanted to become a chef, his father instead booked him, and persuaded him to enlist in the Royal Guard. His initial expectation was a short career, but he began to grow fond of the orderly construct of the military.\n\nDespite being a playful and friendly bat, he did his job efficiently. He was promoted to Sergeant at the age of 24, eventually applying, and accepted, into the Equestrian Military Academy. He entered it expecting to get his commission, until he actually entered it. The competition of the school thrilled him, and he was among the highest-scoring graduates. Following his comission as a 2nd Lieutenant, he was deployed to the Severyanian border, putting down small insurgents and equally small border skirmishes. His work was noticed eventually, and he was finally comissioned as a Captain when he was 33. His ascent into becoming a Lt.Col. began when he was tasked with the assault of a factory taken over by a small group of rebels. He led a group of 20 ponies against around 40 insurgents. After a two-hour siege, he convinced the insurgents to surrender, propelling him from Major to Lieutenant Colonel at the age of 35. He transferred to the Crystal Army afterwards, still using the insignia of his old unit, the 38th Winter Warfare Battalion."

CRY_DUSTY_EMBER_DESC:0 "After the Empire's return Dusty, like all Crystal ponies, had very few memories of her past except the horrors that she experienced under Sombra's rule. Once he was defeated and she realized how prosperous the Empire could be under the guidance of the Alicorns it didn't take long before she became paranoid of outside forces taking all of it away. She quickly enlisted in the Royal Guard and rose to the rank of general within a short span of time. She noticed the growing threat of the Changelings along the borders and began adapting her strategies to best combat them. One day Dusty fears that all that has been gained will be lost and she might even be open to more radical ideas that ensure the security of the Empire against other hostile species."

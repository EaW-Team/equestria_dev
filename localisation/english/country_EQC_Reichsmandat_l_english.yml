 EQC_meet_with_pony_nobles:0 "Meet With The Pony Elite"
 EQC_meet_with_pony_nobles_desc:0 "We need to find supporters for our government. Our natural allies here are the elites of old New Mareland. We certainly have a more strict interpretation of monarchy and elite rule then old Equestria had, but that might not even be a bad thing to them..."

 EQC_a_new_culture:0 "A New Culture"
 EQC_a_new_culture_desc:0 "It is important that we introduce Imperial virtues to the ponies of the Reichsmandat. Obedience, hard work and faith in the gods will be the first among them. And of course, we also need to show them the glory of the Emperor."

 EQC_posniaks_of_the_west_desc:0 "Posniaks, ponies that believe in the Trinity and integrate into Herzlandisch culture, are common in the eastern borderlands of Hellquill and Longsword. In fact, the knightly orders there have been the best proof of how to show ponies the glory of griffon civilization.

 EQC_go_through_the_law_books_desc:0 "The law of old New Mareland under Jet Set was good, but much has happened since. And of course, we can't ignore that we are part of the Griffonian Empire now, so we need to go through the books and come up with compromise solutions."

 EQC_improve_citizen_welfare_desc:0 "To bring the economy back on track, it is not enough to just get the legal environment back to work. We also need a stable consumption from our population, and what easier way to get it then by giving cash to those who will spend it?"
 
 EQC_the_fair_work_act:0 "The Fair Work Act"
 EQC_the_fair_work_act_desc:0 "The Fair Work Act is a combination of laws establishing legal standards around hiring and firing of people.

 EQC_liberalize_the_economy:0 "Liberalize The Economy"

 EQC_imperial_industrial_partnerships:0 "Imperial Industrial Partnerships"
 EQC_imperial_industrial_partnerships_desc:0 "The Empire proper is right next door, and they have – in contrast to us – a ginormous industrial base. We should invite some of their companies to invest in our little Reichsmandat, but of course we need the right incentives for that."
 
 EQC_a_fruitful_cooperation:0 "A Fruitful Cooperation"
 EQC_a_fruitful_cooperation_desc:0 "Our relationship with the Empire is not that of a mere colony. We are an autonomous part of the Empire, true, but we still have a relationship on equal footing. This was not guaranteed, and we should be proud of it."
 
 # Communism
 EQC_the_reichsmandat_communism:0 "The Reichsmandat"
 EQC_the_reichsmandat_communism_desc:0 "We have established the Reichsmandat, but so far our supporters here are few and far between. We need to show the ponies the glory of Griffonian communism."
 
 EQC_build_up_the_party:0 "Build Up The Party"
 EQC_build_up_the_party_desc:0 "A good communist society also needs a strong communist party, able to unite all strata of society. Sadly, the ponies seem to have a disdain for the Griffonian way of communism, and somehow seem to think that an Emperor is not compatible with what they call equal. How wrong they are."
 
 EQC_expropriate_large_landholders:0 "Expropriate Large Landholders"
 EQC_expropriate_large_landholders_desc:0 "The base of all communism is land ownership. The land belongs to the people that work on it, not to some oligarchs far away. We will expropriate anypony who owns an unduly share of the farmland."
 
 EQC_the_first_combine:0 "The First Combine"
 EQC_the_first_combine_desc:0 "If we want to reconfigure our economy to follow a communist model, the combine as economic unit should certainly be our starting point. Here, the workers own their own factory, under gentle guidance from the communist party."

 EQC_introduce_communist_legal_codes_desc:0 "The old New Marelander legal codes were written for a capitalist society. We need to put them all under scrutiny, if they fit to our new, equal societal model. And always remember, the Emperor protects us from reaction."
 
 EQC_collectivization_of_the_agricultural_sector:0 "Collectivization Of The Agricultural Sector"
 EQC_collectivization_of_the_agricultural_sector_desc:0 "In the past, the freeholder peasant could work their land on their own, and some freeholder peasants formed the first proto-communist communities. However, in our changing times, we need to pool resources, as otherwise modern industrial farm equipment would be unfeasible to maintain. So, we will introduce the Kolkhoz, as a large, community-owned farm."
 
 EQC_invest_in_heavy_industry:0 "Invest In Heavy Industry"
 EQC_invest_in_heavy_industry_desc:0 "Our Hochkommissar, Werner Rotflügel, once was a metalworker. And just like for him, the heavy industry is the breeding ground for communist workers. More heavy industry is therefore not only a needed investment into our economy, but also political boon."
 
 EQC_review_the_party_doctrine:0 "Review The Party Doctrine"
 EQC_review_the_party_doctrine_desc:0 "Let's face it: The Communist Party of Neustutenland was founded in a rush with only a few members. Since then, we have come a long way, and now it is time to review what we have just rushed back in the day. We will of course also consult with our mother party over in Griffenheim."
 
 EQC_expand_the_political_department:0 "Expand The Political Department"
 EQC_expand_the_political_department_desc:0 "Political awareness is the first step of any burgeoning communist. They need to be aware of the dangers of reaction, the suppressive nature of capitalism and the virtue of an equal society. We need to go out and tell the people the truth."
 
 EQC_loyalty_to_communism:0 "Loyalty To Communism"
 EQC_loyalty_to_communism_desc:0 "We are a semi-autonomous part of the Griffonian Empire, but our true loyalty is to communist thought.

 # Neutrality
 EQC_reichsmandat.1.t:0 "The New Hochkommissar"
 EQC_reichsmandat.1.d:0 "It was a quiet day in Sunset. The majority of the army had left the city, although a small garrison remained to preserve order, until the local government structures were up to the task. Here, in the mansion of the president, a small ceremony made the establishment of the Reichsmandat official. [THIS.GetLeader] had given a short speech, before [THIS.GetLeader.GetSheHe] officially inaugurated Elsa von Schnabeltass as Hochkommissar. Elsa then gave another speech and answered a few question from journalists, and soon enough the ceremony was already over.\n\nAnd so she was here. Hochkommissar of Neustutenland. Elsa sighed. She had so many good plans in Griffenheim, which would now go unfinished. But the promotion to Hochkommissar had been too good to pass up upon. Well, maybe once she had taught these ponies some culture she could go back and finish her plans.\n\nRight. Ponies. She tried to focus her thoughts. She would meet with some locals soon, and there were still things to prepare. She grabbed a folder on her desk to look on the information her staff provided to her. Lists of influential ponies. Lists of pony elites. And lists of various native griffon leaders. She started to dig into the reports.\n\nThe most important thing would be to find a suitable Mandatspräsident, who could run the day-job of governing without getting in her way. And of course would serve as a friendly face for the ponies. It would be a complicated affair for sure, as according to the reports before her, many ponies still held loyalty to Equestria. It would be a long way to go."
 EQC_reichsmandat.1.a:0 "Let's get to work."
 EQC_reichsmandat.1.b:0 "I want to listen in."

 EQC_reichsmandat.2.t:0 "A Delightful Evening"
 EQC_reichsmandat.2.d:0 "Crown Jewel dipped her head a little. "A wonderful event, your highness. It is good to see that we have a government who values the truly important things." She looked around. "I see that you have invited many of New Mareland's most esteemed ponies. I have to admit that I was doubtful how the Griffonian Empire would handle this delicate situation, but matters have turned around wonderfully."\n\nElsa smiled. Crown Jewel would also have made a good Mandatspräsident. "Dear Crown Jewel, how nice of you to say that. Indeed, it is my intention that the virtues of the Empire can benefit New Mareland as well. Way too many these days believe that political power should be given to the people. But we can see that it takes special talents to rule, right? Power should be exercised by those best suited for it."\n\n"I could not agree more! But there is no gratitude anymore in this world. I own a small business over in New Hoofington, and I can tell you, workers these days are the worst. They always complain for more salary. As if their salaries wouldn't already make up the majority of my expenses! And then they complain to no end whenever I tell them to do some overtime. Some of them even outright refused – of course, those ones didn't get old in my company. Ehm... on that end, would you consider to... adapt some of the legislation?"\n\n"All the laws of old New Mareland will be reviewed soon. And I have to say, the Empire has a much more sensible approach to these legislations. I think in the light of harmonizing the laws, some changes are indeed in order."\n\nAt this point, the orchestra started to play. Dipping her head again, Crown Jewel looked onto Elsa with anticipation. Elsa took up the offer, and so, to the soft sounds of the music, they danced. The evening was still young, and she would dance with many mares and stallions here. Sadly, not all of them were as welcoming to the new government as Crown Jewel was. Her work here was far from done."
 EQC_reichsmandat.2.a:0 "We will bring order to these lands."
 
 EQC_reichsmandat.3.t:0 "The Prelate Of Sunset"
 EQC_reichsmandat.3.d:0 "Elsa stood in front of the new building in town. She really couldn't make up her mind on whether it had been a good idea to work with local architects instead of just relying on Herzlander ones. This would be the new Temple of Eyr, and even more the seat of the new Prelate for Neustutenland. First, it hadn't been easy to even choose which God would get the prelate. Most would perhaps preferred Boreas, the highest of the Gods, but ultimately she had gotten order to instead have a Prelate of Eyr. Then, the construction of the temple had been riddled with difficulties, as the pony architects were just not capable of imitating good Herzlander style for building temples. After a number of revisions, the result had been an interesting mix of architectural styles. She sighed. Maybe this would at least make it more appealing to the ponies.\n\nShe had also thought for quite a while about how to organize the opening ceremony. Getting the ponies to convert would probably take a long time either way, but a good first impression could give it a nice head start. And so, she had invited some successful examples of pony converts from Hellquill. Her thoughts started to wander a bit. The posniaks of the frontier where a truly fascinating kind. It was the best proof that the Empire could be inclusive to everycreature. This would be her vision as Hochkommissar – she would prove to Griffenheim that the ponies could be a productive and loyal subjects.\n\nShe was interrupted in her thoughts when a servant approached her. "Your highness, it is time. The new prelate will arrive from the capital soon."\n\nAfter a short car drive, they arrived at the main station of Sunset. Not much later, an Imperial train arrived, clearly marked by the Archonate of Eyr. The new Prelate of Sunset and all Neustutenland had officially arrived."
 EQC_reichsmandat.3.a:0 "Welcome, Prelate Hildegard."
 EQC_reichsmandat.3.b:0 "Welcome, Prelate August."
 
 EQC_reichsmandat.4.t:0 "A Report Back Home"
 EQC_reichsmandat.4.d:0 "It was time for another report to the capital and at last, she would have good news. The new government had finally been stabilized, both financially and politically. While most ponies were still apathetic to her regime, they were at least now willing to work alongside it.\n\nAs the compiled her reports, she felt a good sense of pride. She had showed it to all her doubters once more – if these griffs in the Imperial government had hoped to give her a task she would fail, they now surely would learn better. Instead of failing, the economic numbers were stabilizing, the tax income steadily improving and unemployment on a new low. Soon enough, all investments the Imperial government had put into her little Mandate would pay out plentiful.\n\nAnd politically, her reports also showed positive signs. Yes, the majority of the population was not exactly loyal, but there now was a class of influential ponies invested into her regime, someponies she – and the Empire – could rely on in the future. The native griffons, while they didn't consider themselves Imperials by any stretch of the imagination, at least had proven positive about their new, true equality in the nation. Sure, this could have gone better, and she had hoped that at least the griffons would really welcome her regime, but at least the griffons were generally against going back to being an Equestrian colony again.\n\nLastly, the converts. Their numbers were little, but at least in a large town such as Sunset, the temples could be filled. More temples would need to be built in the future, and hopefully more ponies would see the light of the Trinity, but for now every progress was good progress. The "posniaks of the west" was perhaps a bit ambitious, but this would change over time. It had not happened in the frontier in a year either.\n\nShe put her quill away and looked upon her report. Yes, this was good. She took the stack of papers, put it in a briefcase and called for her secretary. But one nagging thought remained: No matter how good her performance here would be, this was a job for life, or at least until she would be recalled by the Emperor. She would need to let go of her old rivalries after all, this at least these ever scheming griffs had achieved."
 EQC_reichsmandat.4.a:0 "A job well done, for now. But when would it end?"
 
 # Harmony
 EQC_reichsmandat.5.t:0 "The New Hochkommissar"
 EQC_reichsmandat.5.d:0 "The announcement had created quite some interested. The plaza before the former Presidential palace in Sunset was filled with ponies, which had come to see the new Hochkommissar. Indeed, Willy Pferdefreund's reputation had spread to New Mareland, but the atmosphere was not free of tension. It would take more than one good griff to endear the people of the newly formed Reichsmandat to the Empire.\n\nAnd nogriff thought about this point as much as Willy himself. At times he called himself foolish for even accepting the offer – it would be an impossible task to balance the interests of the Empire with those of the ponies under his protection. But on the other claw, who else would have done it? And most importantly, what would they have done? Better him at the helm than one of those griffs who would only see this as a step in their career.\n\nAn orchestra played the Imperial anthem, and afterwards the New Marelander one, signalling the arrival of [THIS.GetLeader]. Willy had insisted on playing the old New Marelander anthem. This would serve as a signal to the ponies, and indeed, he could see some ponies lift their head up upon hearing the familiar tones. He was a little afraid of the reaction from the Imperials, but they didn't react. Then, [THIS.GetLeader] held a short speech, in which [THIS.GetLeader.GetHeShe] expressed hope that the new Hochkommissar would be the right griffon to build friendly relationship between the Empire and the ponies. The speech was followed by a longer one from Willy himself, in which he expressed his hope of brining harmony as well as free and fair elections to the Reichsmandat. With this, he was now officially inaugurated as Hochkommissar – now, the real work would begin."
 EQC_reichsmandat.5.a:0 "We can do this."

 EQC_reichsmandat.6.t:0 "The Elections"
 EQC_reichsmandat.6.d:0 "After month of careful preparation, the time for elections had arrived. This had not been an easy feat, because even though New Mareland had had established parties, those structures had largely been destroyed in the tumult prior to the Reichsmandat's foundation. And so, it had been up to Willy to rebuild two new parties. As he thought about it, it was quite funny to him how similar the Empire at large and the new Reichsmandat had been in this regard. Both had their democracy implemented from the top-down.\n\nBut this is how it should be. If the old revolution of 978 proved anything, then that democracy could not be built by the people. His old home of Skyfall was the best prove, despite its republicanism it had always been in the iron claw of Guichard. And this is not to speak of Cloudbury, were Kemerskai had pretended to be a democratic president for decades. All nonsense.\n\nThis train of thought was cut short by his secretary called him. Voting had begun, and his vote he would cast in what almost could be described as a public ceremony. Indeed, it had been quite the shock to many ponies when he announced a couple of weeks ago that he had given up his Imperial citizenship in favour of a Neustutenlander one. But it had been a necessary step. How else could he convince the ponies that he had their best interest in mind? Now he would be judged by the same laws as they were, and the decision of the government would apply to him the same way as to all of them. And indeed, in some sense his life dream had come true... this was not Equestria, but it was as close as he would ever get. On a second, more serious call from his secretary he got up from his desk and went voting.\n\nThe next day, the election results were announced. The party with the most seats in parliament would get to provide the Mandatspräsident. And the winner was..."

They were impressed by my writing skills, and so they allow me to study law. It's an attractive field right now. They are reviewing all the laws, you know? So ponies like me that study the new laws will be in great demand."\n\n"Calm down, Rose Bush. I don't think that I'll lose you anytime soon – even if I wish for it sometimes." He let out a snarl. "Our parents will never ever be able to pay you subsidies to go to university – not to talk of the costs for the university itself. That's a daydream, dearie. We're poor farm workers from the Hoovesplains, we don't get to study on the university."\n\n"You're an old killjoy, brother. But this time, you're also wrong. Last week, the government abolished all tuition fees. They announced that on the radio – and my letter confirms it. And it comes better: The government also introduced a program to give interest-free credits for poor students. As you can see here, I was accepted also for this. I'll get... how are our new coins called... 500 whatevers every month, for as long as I study."\n\nRose Bush pressed her brother the letter into his face. He took the letter with his hoof and begun to read. After a while he crunched his muzzle and mumbled: "Fine. Go then and leave me to rot here.""

 EQC_reichsmandat.8.t:0 "The Language Law"
 EQC_reichsmandat.8.d:0 ""Herr Kommissar... ich... eh... mögen Sie, aber Reich kann nicht sein... vertrauen." The old pony shook his head. "Ich... eh..."\n\n"Oi, you can speak Ponish to me. I'm a New Marelander like any of you." The pony looked in surprise upon hearing the Hochkommissar speak flawless Ponish, with even a slight New Marelandian accent. "And in fact, because of the new law, you will always able to do all your business in Ponish – well, that you were able to do already before, but the government now has introduced that we should all speak Ponish in public offices. And this goes for me as much as for everypony else."\n\n"What, really, mate? I mean... commissioner? I must have missed that. I was a digger back in my days, and a cannon ball exploded right next to me – I've struggled with hearing ever since. But that's like... can I have your hoof... claw... for that one?" Willy Pferdefreund grabbed the pony's hoof with this claw and shook it. "I guess I need to reconsider on the Empire. Maybe they're not as bad as they used to be back in my days..." And with this comment, the old pony galloped away.\n\nIt had been a good idea to organize this public meeting, thought Willy. There was still so much distrust, even after the elections. He preferred to not put himself in the spotlight as much. Maybe they would come to see the new Reichsmandat as not overly different to the old days. After all, these ponies here had been a colony of Equestria. Self-governing, but still bound by Canterlot. In some sense, the new arrangement was even not all that different really, only that Canterlot had been replaced by Griffenheim.\n\nIt was all not easy. He had met quite the number of ponies today, and perhaps he had convinced some of them. The new law concerning languages would certainly help as well to make the ponies feel less overarching burden. But how long would it take to really end this deep distrust?"

The elections had been a success, maybe the largest success so far. Many ponies, especially here in New Mareland, only ever had heard bad stories about the Empire, stories of the tyranny from the Grover dynasty. Was it surprising, that they had feared the worst? But the elections and subsequent appointment of a democratically backed Mandatspräsident had turned it around.\n\nWilly Pferdefreund let out a sigh. Of course, not everything was going swimmingly. Whenever he sent a report to Griffenheim, their answer was a list of demands. Yes, they always spoke of how they appreciated his efforts for societal harmony, but still, he felt, for them the only thing that mattered was the bottom line.\n\nImperial companies had tried to exploit the workers of New Mareland. It had taken multiple interventions in the Imperial court until something changed. These industrialists really had the nerve to treat his little ponies as colonial subjects! Wait... his little ponies? His train of thoughts stopped for a moment. Why had he just used Celestia's formulation? Was he really feeling like her...? Probably not.\n\nHe lifted his head to look out of the window. No, he was not a Celestia to these lands, and he should not think these things. He was a New Marelander, just like them. In the democratic process, there was no need for an alicorn – not to speak of that he had none of their powers. The only thing he could do, and the task for the rest of his life, would be stand up for New Marelander interests in the Empire. If he could claim any legacy, it should be to have prevented New Mareland from becoming an Imperial colony."

 EQC_reichsmandat.10.d:0 "The rain had forced the ceremony inside at the last moment. Looking at the number of visitors, it might have saved him an embarrassment, Werner Rotflügel thought. Despite plenty of announcements that the event would be open to the public, nopony had taken interest, and so the only ones waiting for the inauguration ceremony were a clawful of journalists.\n\nAt the last moment however, a quite old looking stallion and a very young mare showed up, as the only ones not here for work. The almost-Hochkommissar was so confused that he approached the unequal pair. "Hello, ponies. How nice that you have found your way here. Are you here for the ceremony?"\n\nThe old stallion answered: "Yes. You know, many years ago good old Caramel Marks approached Celestia about her vision for Equestria. Did you know this? Almost nopony knows this. I've always asked myself what would have happened if Celestia hadn't thrown her out. You had it better in your Empire. Your Grover has accepted communism. I just wish that it all happened in Equestria, you know? Saddens me that you griffons are ahead of us."\n\nThe young mare kicked him with her hind hoof. "You are so wrong, old pony. These griffons here are our saviours, yes, they are! The stupid ponies never wanted to hear that communism and monarchy work together. I'm so happy to meet you, commissioner. You will finally correct everything that's wrong, right? You'll show these pony 'communists' what real griffon communism looks like. I've seen pictures of the Emperor. He looks mighty fine, no wonder that he is a great communist."\n\nWerner was now even more confused. They both seemed to have the right ideas, but were they truly on the right track? He walked back to the stage, and after a short speech of [THIS.GetLeader] and a slightly longer speech from himself, he was officially appointed Hochkommissar."

 EQC_reichsmandat.11.t:0 "The First Combine"
 EQC_reichsmandat.11.d:0 "The rattling of sawmills in the background added to the industrial atmosphere. Werner Rotflügel felt reminded of his old days as metalworker in Griffenheim. What better place to start with for a combine? The new "Woodwork Combine 'Caramel Marks'" would be the first of many, until the New Marelander economy was properly restructured.\n\nFor his speech, he had prepared a script: "Dear ponies and griffons of the Woodworking Combine 'Caramel Marks'. As the Hochkommissar of the Reichsmandat, it is a special honour for me to witness the birth of communism in our fair nation. We have already made great progress, but much remains to be done. This factory here has a long history, as it started out over two hundred years ago as a simple sawmill owned by a local landholder."\n\nThe speech went on for a while. In true fashion of these opening speeches, it covered the entire history of the factory, with sprinkled in phrases about the exploitative nature of private businesses. It also talked about various economic issues tangentially related to the factory, and general communist talking points with absolutely no relationship to the factory. The listeners mostly lost interest after half an hour, but the Hochkommissar had not even finished half his script.\n\nTowards the end of his speech however – at this point many were already asleep – the few still listening were in for a surprise. "As you know, the Emperor takes the establishment of communism here in Neustutenstaat very seriously. As this is the first combine of hopefully many, he has given it his seal, so that you can call yourself now the 'His Majesty's Woodwork Combine Caramel Marks'. I have held this off to be a surprise, and hope that this fulfils you with as much pride as I have for this achievement." He paused in the hope of a spontaneous applause, however the ponies that still listened just looked surprised, before whispering a bit among themselves."

 EQC_reichsmandat.12.t:0 "The Kolkhoz"
 EQC_reichsmandat.12.d:0 "The red cap that they had given her was really not suited for a unicorn. Probably manufactured for griffons, and simply send to the Reichsmandat without further thinking about it. After a while Fire Glow had simply made a hole for her horn. This made the cap sit a bit awkward, but at least it could not fall off again.\n\nDue to this hassle with her new insignia, she arrived a bit late to the farm. Or kolkhoz, as they were now called. But it had been a good day – her hard work finally had paid off, and she had been promoted to party commissar for the kolkhoz. In the past, they had all worked for a grumpy old mare. Never would she had considered her for a promotion, much less for the leader of the farm. No, the old mare always wanted to "know her ponies". No wonder that the farm managers had all been young stallions. She suppressed a shudder.\n\nBut things had changed. She was pleased to see that the other farm ponies were already there. "Comrades! I'm happy to see that you are all eager to work. As newly promoted party commissar for the... no, our farm... I of course mean our kolkhoz... ehm, ok, this is all a bit new to all of us, right?" She laughed nervously. "Anyways, as you know, we always work for the good of the community. No longer are we suppressed and exploited by capitalist masters, but we are here to do the good work for us and those we care for. Hail to the communist party!" She looked expectantly to her co-workers.\n\nNopony clapped. But an old stallion asked: "Isn't the official party salute 'Hail to communism and Emperor Grover'?"\n\nFire Glow pinned her ears back. "Well, yes, but why did you think I was finished? I wanted to say, please go to your work." And in a slightly higher tone she added: "Hail to communism and Emperor Grover!" Maybe they had just replaced an extorting master with an insane one. But it was still a good swap."

 EQC_reichsmandat.13.t:0 "A Report Back Home"
 EQC_reichsmandat.13.d:0 "Werner Rotflügel sat behind his desk to write once more a report to Griffenheim. How were things progressing? Good, to some extent. The economic chaos in the aftermath of the establishment of the Reichsmandat had been cleared up. The laws were all reviewed and changed to fit the new political realities. And also elsewhere, he could sense a stabilisation of the situation. Vandalism, pretty common after the start of the transition to a communist economy, had become rare. And the Communist Party, despite a slow start, had grown in size.\n\nBut where things truly good behind this façade? This was a thousand-idols-question. Had the feelings of the ponies changed, or had they only learned when they should clap during his speeches? As sad as it was, reality was probably closer to the latter. All sorts of reports were scattered on his desk, but he knew that at least half of them were simply fake, and the others of dubious quality. These ponies creating the reports all just hoped for a promotion, or feared what would happen when they didn't deliver. He already tried to be soft, but if he would be too soft, wouldn't this just let reaction creep back in?\n\nIn some sense, his job reminded him of his old days in Griffenheim. His union of monarcho-communists had never really caught on. For some reasons, neither griffons nor ponies seem to value the combination of communism and monarchy. The exceptions of course were the dogs from Bronzehill. But he suspected even them of just being so loyal to the Emperor that they couldn't let him go. Was he the only one alive to truly value the concept, the theory behind monarcho-communism? It seemed so logical to him.\n\nHe sighed. Now was not the time for deep ideological questions. He started to crawl thought the various statistics on his desk and compile them for Griffenheim."

Her mother died early, and her father had to sell the family estate because of mounting debt when she was seven. After living for a while in Katerinburg, they moved to Griffenheim in 972 when she was fifteen. Here, her father worked in the Imperial administration. They came into contact with other nobles, which however snubbed her and her father for their lack of money.\n\nThe revolution cost her father his job, and very nearly also his life, but they were able to flee north to Bronzehill. As the revolution was over, her father went back to Griffenheim, while she moved to Yale. Increasingly determined, she secured herself an Imperial sponsorship for her studies, studying law in Greenback. She graduated top of her class, which earned her a recommendation to work in the Imperial tax office. Earning well, she could buy back the Schnabeltass estate, fulfilling her first goal in life. But in her new respectable position, she could now to build up a network of contacts to also organizing revenge on the nobles that snubbed her father.\n\nWith this, she became a divisive persona in the Griffenheim court.

His parents worked in an import-export business with Equestria, leading to him coming into contact with ponies very early on in his life. When he was only six, his parents took him to a trip to Canterlot where they had some business to organize, but there he declared that "he would stay here among the ponies". While this didn't come to pass – his parents objected quite strongly – ever since he has lived to fulfil his name.\n\nAs he grew up, he started to work in his parents business, always taking opportunities for business trips to the pony lands. But he also extended his contacts into the Griffonian Empire. With the Empire regaining strength, he shifted his work towards political activism. He became an honorary member of the "Vereinigung greifischer Ponys" (Union of Griffonian Ponies) and a strong advocate for more multi-speciesism in the Empire. In addition, he advocated for harmony, praising his experiences in Equestria.\n\nWhen the time arose to pick a Hochkommissar for the Reichsmandat, he seemed as the ideal candidate to be the friendly face for the Empire. And he is indeed determined to make sure that the ponies, both of the Empire and the Reichsmandat, do not get the short end of the stick."

 EQC_werner_rotfluegel_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 28th of April, 969, Griffenheim, Griffonian Empire\n\n§YBiography§!: Werner Rotflügel was born in Griffenheim to a family of metalworkers. He grew up in an atmosphere on tension in the city, which eventually culminated in the revolution. While his family was generally unaffected by the chaos, he grew a disdain for both the republicans and the monarchists. With fourteen, he made an apprenticeship for locksmith, but soon switched to metalworking just like his parents.\n\nWhen working in the factory, communist ideas spread among the proletariat. At this point, Werner was still largely unpolitical, seeing communism as just a variant of republicanism. However, at some point he accidentally read an article by Clara Woofkin arguing for a monarcho-communist regime. He immediately saw this as the solution to all the problems of republicanism as well as monarchism, interpreting it – wrongly, as some would say – as a government that could bring true justice in a peaceful way.\n\nSoon, he organized his own trade union with an explicitly monarcho-communist ideology. To his disappointment, none of his co-workers were interested, and even among the wider city only a clawful of people joined. This all changed when monarcho-communism arrived officially in the Empire. He immediately tried to offer his services to the government, which saw him as loyal, but not overly bright.\n\nNow he has become Hochkommissar for the Reichsmandat, which proved to be a throwback to his old days. Despite his best efforts, the ponies seem to not be impressed by his ideas, but he is used to fighting alone for the right cause."

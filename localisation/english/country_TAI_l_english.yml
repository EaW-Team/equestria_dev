 PRIESTESS_DARA_DESC:0 "TODO: Dara is worshipped as a demigod amongst the Tanaighans. She is young and was personally picked by Zaramo to lead. She doesn't really know what she's doing yet. Her advisors often engage in their own selfish interests unbeknownst to her. She is sad about her brother."

 TAI_fea_disdain:0 "Feathisian Disdain"

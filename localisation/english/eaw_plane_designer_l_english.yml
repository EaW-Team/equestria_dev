 jet_engine_8x:0 "8x Jet Engines"
 jet_engine_8x_desc:0 "Eight engines provide an absurd amount of thrust, for carrying an absurd amount of weapons."
 jet_engine_2_1x:0 "1x Turbofan Engine"
 jet_engine_2_1x_desc:0 "Replacing turbojets with turbofans produces more thrust and speed, at the cost of more complexity and production time."
 jet_engine_2_2x:0 "2x Turbofan Engines"
 jet_engine_2_2x_desc:0 "$engine_1_2x_desc$"
 jet_engine_2_3x:0 "3x Turbofan Engines"
 jet_engine_2_3x_desc:0 "$engine_1_3x_desc$"
 jet_engine_2_4x:0 "4x Turbofan Engines"

 fast_jet_engine_6x:0 "6x Supersonic Jet Engines"
 fast_jet_engine_6x_desc:0 "Six engines with boron-enriched zip fuel can provide astounding speed, although at a hefty price and fuel consumption. They also take up as much space as 8 normal jet engines, thus requiring a larger airframe to mount."

 rocket_engine_4:0 "Crystal Engine I"
 rocket_engine_4_desc:0 "Similar to a rocket engine, this design uses the radical idea of liquid crystals for its power source. This increases performance, at the cost of requiring access to said crystals."
 rocket_engine_5:0 "Crystal Engine II"
 rocket_engine_5_desc:0 "More stable, faster, and overall better, this is the ultimate in short-range interceptors."

 super_large_bomb_bay:0 "Super Large Bomb Bay"
 super_large_bomb_bay_desc:0 "A massive bay to carry enough ordinance to devastate a city."
 guided_air_to_surface_missile:0 "Guided Air-to-Surface Missile"
 guided_air_to_surface_missile_desc:0 "A bomb with joystick guidance and a rocket engine, this missile is among the first true precision air-to-surface weapons."
 guided_air_to_air_missile:0 "Guided Air-to-Air Missile"
 guided_air_to_air_missile_desc:0 "A high explosive charge with a rocket engine and heat or radar guidance, this new weapon of war is a serious threat to planes currently flying."
 nuclear_air_to_air_rocket:0 "Unguided Nuclear Air-to-Air Rocket"
 nuclear_air_to_air_rocket_desc:0 "While it may seem completely insane to fire unguided nuclear rockets over our own airspace, the fact is that modern bombers are unstoppable by machine guns. With missiles still in their infancy, this rocket provides a valuable stopgap for killing strategic bombers and preventing actual nuclear strikes on our soil."
 hardpoint:0 "Hardpoint"
 hardpoint_desc:0 "Capable of mounting an autocannon, bombs, glide bombs, or even rockets, this is the true multirole weapon of choice. Its chief drawback is its cost."

 small_plane_airframe_5:0 "Modern Small Airframe"
 small_plane_airframe_5_desc:0 "This airframe is designed to take advantage of the great speeds offered by modern engines and potentially reach low transonic speeds."
 cv_small_plane_airframe_5:0 "Modern Carrier Airframe"
 cv_small_plane_airframe_5_desc:0 "The ultimate fusion of naval aviation and jet technology, this airframe is flexible and powerful."
 modern_small_airframe:0 "$small_plane_airframe_5$"
 modern_small_airframe_desc:0 "$small_plane_airframe_5_desc$"
 medium_plane_airframe_5:0 "Modern Medium Airframe"
 medium_plane_airframe_5_desc:0 "With jet-powered planes now dominant, engineers have learned how to truly take advantage of jet propulsion."
 large_plane_airframe_5:0 "Modern Large Airframe"
 large_plane_airframe_5_desc:0 "A more durable frame focuses on survivability, to ensure at least some bombers get through."
 super_large_plane_airframe_1:0 "Super Large Airframe"
 super_large_plane_airframe_1_desc:0 "Massive, unwieldy, and very long-range, this airframe can mount the largest bombs ever dropped... at a high price."

 radio_navigation_3:0 "VHF Omnidirectional Range"
 radio_navigation_3_desc:0 "Very high-frequency vacuum tube transmitters with mechanically rotated antennas provide a pilot with the very high-frequency omnidirectional range (VOR) system 360 courses to and from a radio station. It works with the same fundamental principles as earlier RDF systems but utilises short-range radio and RADAR stations instead, allowing for a nearly exact navigational aid for aircraft pilots."
 air_ground_radar_3:0 "Air-Ground Radar III"
 air_ground_radar_3_desc:0 "Even better air-to-ground ensures a higher chance of successful hits."
 air_ground_radar_4:0 "Air-Ground Radar IV"
 air_ground_radar_4_desc:0 "The final word in aerial bombardment, this radar lets pilots ensure their payloads almost always hit even at night."
 air_air_radar_3:0 "Air-Air Radar III"
 air_air_radar_3_desc:0 "Modern radar is capable of even locating enemy fighters, instead of just bombers."
 air_air_radar_4:0 "Air-Air Radar IV"
 air_air_radar_4_desc:0 "Further advancements in radar let air superiority and interception missions reach new heights of success."

 bomb_sights_3:0 "RADAR Integrated Bombing Computer"
 bomb_sights_3_desc:0 "Efforts in Air-to-Ground RADAR development offer a significant advantage for new bombsights over optical versions, allowing bombardiers to get a clearer image of their targets even in poor visibility conditions. While most bombsights models will still include an optical sight as a backup analogue system, it is evident that the future of bombing will rely increasingly on RADAR imaging."
 bomb_sights_4:0 "Fully Computerised Bombsight"
 bomb_sights_4_desc:0 "With complete digitalisation and computerisation, this bombsight isn't a "sight" as a ballistic computer that uses RADAR imaging to calculate bomb trajectories in real-time. Taking into account many factors, both internal and external, this computer is capable of reducing the circular error probable from what used to be hundreds of meters to mere tens of meters, with unparalleled precision compared to previous computers."

 hardpoints:0 "Hardpoints"
 hardpoints_desc:0 "Flexible mounts capable of holding autocannons, rockets, bombs, or glide bombs. What they lose in power they make up for in versatility."
 advanced_jet_engines:0 "Turbofan Engines"
 advanced_jet_engines_desc:0 "The turbofan is a new development that increases thrust and speed, allowing more power to be gotten out of the same quantity of fuel."

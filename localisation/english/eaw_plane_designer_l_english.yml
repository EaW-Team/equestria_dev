 cv_small_plane_airframe_5:0 "Modern Carrier Airframe"
 cv_small_plane_airframe_5_desc:0 "The ultimate fusion of naval aviation and jet technology, this airframe is flexible and powerful."
 medium_plane_airframe_5:0 "Modern Medium Airframe"
 medium_plane_airframe_5_desc:0 "Against all odds, the concept of a heavy fighter has survived as the now well-understood design parameters for intermediate sizes of jet aircraft provide a platform to transport and use an incredible number of new air-to-air weapons. On top of this the dominance of jet technology has allowed our designers to fine tune many of the previously difficult processes in the research and development stage of airframe production, creating more optimised and effective aircraft."
 large_plane_airframe_5:0 "Modern Large Airframe"
 large_plane_airframe_5_desc:0 "The most notable innovations for this second iteration of heavy jet airframes are largely centred around survivability, both in terms of the reliability of the designs themselves and in terms of countermeasures when faced with imminent interception by the enemy. In the case of the latter, hull-mounted weapons have become largely obsolete; rendered ineffective by the speed at which the aircraft travel. In their place are countermeasures deployed directly from the fuselage, serving as a last line of defence in the event that altitude is not enough."
 super_large_plane_airframe_1:0 "Super Large Airframe"
 super_large_plane_airframe_1_desc:0 "Since the inception and adoption of bomber technology, it has been generally accepted that the simplest way to increase the munition load of an aircraft is to increase its overall size. Previously the limiting factor was the amount of thrust and lift that piston engines could generate, but this issue has vanished with the creation of reliable and powerful jet engines. As such our engineers have devised a truly colossal airframe, one that could carry an equally enormous payload if we truly wish to sink our resources into such an immense project."

 small_plane_airframe_6: "Supersonic Small Airframe"
 small_plane_airframe_6_desc: "Building on now tried and true jet technologies, the idea of a supersonic aircraft is no longer so far-fetched. Although prototypes have shown that these speeds may begin to diminish the manoeuvrability of such an aircraft, it is hoped that the ability to disengage at such absurd velocities will make up for the reduction in turn rate. With missile technology and more powerful engines on the horizon, perhaps dogfighting will fade from doctrine entirely."

 radio_navigation_3:0 "VHF Omnidirectional Range"
 radio_navigation_3_desc:0 "Very high-frequency vacuum tube transmitters with mechanically rotated antennas provide a pilot with the very high-frequency omnidirectional range system 360 courses to and from a radio station. It works with the same fundamental principles as earlier RDF systems but utilises short-range radio and RADAR stations instead, allowing for a nearly exact navigational aid for aircraft pilots."
 air_ground_radar_3:0 "Air-Ground Radar III"
 air_ground_radar_3_desc:0 "Whilst the previous line of air-to-ground targeting computers were an improvement, they were not hugely significant upgrades over the original designs. Recent developments however have allowed our engineers to create what amounts to a very early form of radar imaging, something that could eliminate the need for spotters and multiple bombardiers. Once our air crews figure out how to use this highly advanced equipment, they'll never want to go back."
 air_ground_radar_4:0 "Air-Ground Radar IV"
 air_ground_radar_4_desc:0 "Largely an improvement upon our previous innovation, this new targeting system removes much of the operation complexity whilst improving upon the image resolution. Previously it was considered dangerous to use these machines at night as it was nigh impossible to make out targets under such conditions, but with ease of use and higher quality picture the risks are now negligible."
 air_air_radar_3:0 "Air-Air Radar III"
 air_air_radar_3_desc:0 "By this point both our pilots and aircraft designers are beginning to see the value in accurate radar on their light aircraft. Now however, another issue has become apparent. Current detection systems can only inform pilots that there is an aircraft, not what size of aircraft it is or whether it would be wise to try and intercept it. This challenge is one that our engineers hope to overcome with the next series of air-to-air radar systems."
 air_air_radar_4:0 "Air-Air Radar IV"
 air_air_radar_4_desc:0 "As our radar technology advances, so too do our craft-mounted systems improve. Already preliminary designs are circulating that can outrange and outperform the prior generation of air-to-air detection systems. Though they are still limited by the airframe they are installed within, never before have our pilots been so confident in their ability to detect and engage enemy aircraft."

 bomb_sights_3:0 "RADAR Integrated Bombing Computer"
 bomb_sights_3_desc:0 "Efforts in Air-to-Ground RADAR development offer a significant advantage for new bombsights over optical versions, allowing bombardiers to get a clearer image of their targets even in poor visibility conditions. While most bombsights models will still include an optical sight as a backup analogue system, it is evident that the future of bombing will rely increasingly on RADAR imaging."
 bomb_sights_4:0 "Fully Computerised Bombsight"
 bomb_sights_4_desc:0 "With complete digitalisation and computerisation, this bombsight isn't a "sight" as much as a ballistic computer that uses RADAR imaging to calculate bomb trajectories in real-time. Taking into account many factors, both internal and external, this computer is capable of reducing the circular error probable from what used to be hundreds of meters to mere tens of meters, with unparalleled precision compared to previous computers."

 hardpoints:0 "Hardpoints"
 hardpoints_desc:0 "Whilst there is much to be gained in the specialisation of aircraft in certain roles, versatility is nevertheless an important factor in aircraft design. The premise of hardpoints conceptually is simple: Provide a platform which can mount any kind of weapon, allowing the aircraft on which the hardpoint is mounted to perform many different roles without sacrificing its effectiveness in any one area. Much to the surprise and annoyance of veteran dogfighters, this innovation has proven to be incredibly effective."
 general_purpose_bombs:0 "General-Purpose Bombs"
 general_purpose_bombs_desc:0 "Balancing blast damage, penetration, and fragmentation, this new generation of bombs can hit harder against any target type it is suited for."
 aa_cannon_4:0 "Advanced Aircraft Cannons"
 aa_cannon_4_desc:0 "Despite modern aircraft utilising armour and being made almost entirely of metal, existing calibres used in current air-to-air cannons are still more than capable of tearing enemy fighters in half. Their primary limitation was poor volume of fire, making it quite difficult to actually land effective fire on manoeuvrable opponents. This shortcoming has been largely rectified with the implementation of improved cannons, with the added benefit of giving the weapons increased capacity to strafe ground targets; though the results of such strafing runs are still mixed."
 aa_cannon_5:0 "Modern Large Cannons"
 aa_cannon_5_desc:0 "Using multiple barrels in the style of old Catling guns enables a truly astonishing rate of fire, even with 20mm rounds. Jet engines also provide enough electricity to rotate the barrel when flying. They even perform better against ground targets."
 tank_buster_3:0 "Anti-Tank Cannon III"
 tank_buster_3_desc:0 "Since the inception of air-to-ground gunnery, utilising the firepower of cannons mounted on aircraft has been limited in effectiveness by the precision required to damage or destroy enemy armour. Providing useful close air support required particularly skilled pilots and the absence of enemy anti-air to make strafing runs effective, but no longer. Rapid fire weaponry has rendered the skill previously required to destroy armour and mechanised equipment a non-factor as the volume of fire compensates for general lack of accuracy."
 electronic_countermeasures:0 "Anti-Missile Countermeasures"
 electronic_countermeasures_desc:0 "As mounted weapons become progressively less effective at dealing with manoeuvrable enemy aircraft, the next best thing is to create ways of preventing damage from their weapons should they come close enough to use them. Radio oscillators, decoys and chaff rockets are quickly becoming ubiquitous in heavier airframes that have the fuselage space in which to install them. They can't prevent damage from cannon fire, but they do provide protection against missiles and other modern air-to-air weaponry."
 advanced_aircraft_construction:0 "Advanced Aircraft Construction"
 advanced_aircraft_construction_desc:0 "The advent of jet technology has both created possibilities and generated design difficulties. Piston engine planes largely relied on long wings at right angles to a fuselage in order to generate the lift necessary to fly, but this design is far less feasible on jet aircraft. The speeds at which they travel necessitate new designs such as swept wings in order to reduce the drag generated by wing profiles, increasing the speed of aircraft and reducing the likelihood of spontaneous disassembly resulting from the extreme forces involved."
 advanced_jet_engines:0 "Turbofan Engines"
 advanced_jet_engines_desc:0 "Turbofans are a fascinating piece of technology, combining the innovations in jet engines with a modernised form of propeller to generate more thrust from the same amount of air and fuel input. The propeller —now taking the form of a many-bladed fan—  rests at the front of the engine and allows air to pass through, oxidising the jet fuel which combusts behind it. As the air enters the system through its blades, the fan begins to spin and generates additional thrust. Though the technology is currently primitive, it shows incredible promise."

However, acoustic-homing torpedoes continue to be an effective ASW weapon. The design and development of air-dropped ASW torpedoes will allow our aircraft to continue being excellent counter against enemy submarine actions."

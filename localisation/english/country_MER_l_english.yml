 MER_POLITICS_FACILIER_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! April 14th, 978\n\n§YBiography:§! Born the son of a fishmonger and a shipyard worker, life was not set to be easy for young Facilier. With little wealth to his family name, the young colt often turned his attention outward: to the sea, and whatever laid beyond. Noveau Aquila was a bustling port at the time, and Facilier's attention was often fixated on the stories the sailors brought with them. More crucially, they often spoke of the harsh working conditions faced by those who made their living on the seas. In an effort to put the stories of these unsung heroes to paper, Facilier would leave home and seek out likeminded individuals, travelling far and wide with little but his few belongings.\n\nFor all his effort, the stories he sought would lead him to the young Socialist Republic of Stalliongrad, where he would decide to embark upon an ideological safari to other regions in and around Equestria harboring communist sympathies. However, after spending much time within Coltjun revolutionary circles in Baltimare, he would instead leave for Les Meridiennes, influenced by his heritage and confident in their revolutionary potential.\n\nWith little more than his meagre possessions and no connections in the area, Facilier would eventually meet up with Mama Ruby, working his way through the ranks and building the PKM up to be the true party of the people. With the end of Vivienne's brief rule on the isles, they now seek to transform the former colony into an independent state with its own bright future.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! BunnyShrubby"

 ## Starting Admirals 
 MER_soup_defaux:0 "Soup Defaux"
 MER_soup_defaux_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 970\n\n§YBiography:§! In the time of the first Aquileian Counterrevolution, Albert Berthelot and his Monarchists drew in every able-bodied creature they could to fight and die for the Discret Restoration, and of all those who went from worthlessness to importance through their role in the conflict, few have given as much as Soup Defaux.\nBorn to a low-class Pridean family, Defaux joined the navy as a deck-swabber on the nation's flagship. By all accounts, he did this just fine, yet on a terrible day in 985, when the city of Pridea burned and Defaux was only 15, he caught the eye of Dennis "The Menace" Discret. The captain noticed the sailor, barely more than a child, and stuffed him into the closet housing a casemate cannon with orders to keep loading shells until told otherwise. And Defaux did this, first for an hour, then three, then six, until Pridea was rubble.\nSupposedly, he was scorched black when he was allowed out, and it may not have only been on the outside. He was very different when he came out, and the loss of his parents in the destruction only made it worse. Regardless, having been noticed by Dennis, he was able to become a career officer and begin climbing through the ranks. He ended the war as a Junior Lieutenant and stayed in the navy.\nThen, a few years later, he beat one Lieutenant Smoke, a fellow officer, to death in a dispute. It was found that he was unable to pass a psychological evaluation. For his years of faithful service, Dennis interceded in his life one last time and managed to get him promoted to Admiral – at the cost of being sent to Les Meridiennes for the rest of his life, likely to never see any combat or adventure ever again.\nIt was fine by him. Being a sailor was never his dream. But sometimes, the cannons are all firing at full speed, and explosions sound off a distant coast, and the tension seems to fade from his muscles. \n§YPortrait by:§! §GRyanBoi§!"

 MER_simon:0 "Simon Volière"
 MER_simon_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 968 ALB\n\n§YBiography:§! Hailing from a village just beyond Port Giselda on Belle-Ile, Simon Volière developed a profound affinity for the sea and the sailor's life from an early age. It was during a fishing trip with his father that he first laid eyes on an Aquileian warship, igniting within him a fervent desire to join the Navy.\nWith determination, he delved into the study of mathematics, navigation, and other requisite skills, aspiring to enroll in the Naval Academy. Simon's dreams materialized when he secured admission to the École Navale Royale in Aquileia. Transitioning from a brief tenure in the Aquileian fleet, he found his niche in the Meridienne Squadron.\nLeveraging his intimate knowledge of the surrounding waters, Simon excelled in navigation, steadily ascending through the ranks. His career received a significant boost when a cousin ascended to the esteemed position of Royal Governor. Although he identifies as a staunch Royalist, his experience in Aquileia fostered a profound mistrust of King Moriset. No matter what happens in Aquileia he loves his island home and will do anything to protect it."

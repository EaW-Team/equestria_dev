MER_POLITICS_GENEVIEVE_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 968\n\n§YBiography:§! "Without the Meridiennes, there would be no Aquileia. Without Geneviève Volière, there will be no Meridiennes!" These bold words come from the islands' rarely sober noble population. What does Geneviève herself think? Is she a proud lapdog, or the champion of her home isles? \n\nThe truth is, much like Geneviève herself, in the middle. \n\nBorn to a fairly prominent family, Geneviève was always booksmart. Her personability made her an ideal recruit for the colonial authorities. She tackled her duties with pride, inspired by her lifelong friend Tarte au Corossol. During the Revolution, she worked to ensure the Meridiennes' continued loyalty even after the exiled Discrets left for Saddle Arabia. \n\nAfter the Restoration, Tarte left for the mainland, leaving Geneviève without a mentor or a friend in sight. Despite this, forged her own path. She accepted King Discret's offer to replace the retiring governor of the Meridiennes. Since then, she has proven herself to be the most efficient administrator in the Crown. \n\nTruthfully, Geneviève doesn't know the conditions on the mainland that well - she's never been! However, she has complete faith in her beloved King to rule with a tough, but fair talon. He won't let her down, and she won't let him down, either!\n\n§YPortrait by:§! §SScroup§!" #

MER_POLITICS_OEUF_DESC:0 "#TODO"
#MER_POLITICS_FACILIER_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! April 14th, 978\n\n§YBiography:§! Born the son of a fishmonger and a shipyard worker, life was not set to be easy for young Facilier. With little wealth to his family name, the young colt often turned his attention outward: to the sea, and whatever laid beyond. Noveau Aquila was a bustling port at the time, and Facilier's attention was often fixated on the stories the sailors brought with them. More crucially, they often spoke of the harsh working conditions faced by those who made their living on the seas. In an effort to put the stories of these unsung heroes to paper, Facilier would leave home and seek out likeminded individuals, travelling far and wide with little but his few belongings. \n\nFor all his effort, the stories he sought would lead him to the young Socialist Republic of Stalliongrad, where he would decide to embark upon an ideological safari to other regions in and around Equestria harboring communist sympathies. However, after spending much time within Coltjun revolutionary circles in Baltimare, he would instead leave for Les Meridiennes, influenced by his heritage and confident in his ability to bring about a revolution with ease. \n\nWith little more than his meagre possessions and no connections in the area, Facilier would eventually meet up with Mama Ruby, working his way through the ranks and building the KPEy up to be the true party of the people. With the end of Vivienne's brief rule on the isles, they now seek to transform the former colony into an independent state with its own bright future."

MER_POLITICS_TARTE_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! July 20th, 961 \n\n§YBiography:§!\n"Without Tarte au Corossol, there would be no Mouvement Patriote. Without the Mouvement, there would be no Aquileia!" So say the demagogues, but what about Tarte herself? Surely the heart within such a patriot's chest would beat with a passion and fire like no other! \n\nThose who believe that are fools, and those who know the truth have been to the Meridiennes.\n\nIn those terrible days after the Revolution, it was Tarte's love for her country and her hatred for its enemies that inspired her to found the MPA. Once the monarchy was restored, that same love brought Tarte to the mainland. The MPA's explosive popularity delivered unto Tarte power the likes of which she could have only dreamed. She intended to make a second revolution impossible. \n\nKing Discret had a similar idea, for he feared Tarte would soon eclipse him. He "granted" Tarte a "special position" on the Meridiennes, only to return to Aquileia at his request. She was all but banished. Leadership of the MPA fell to that wretched mainlander, Rodier. Tarte's lifelong ambitions shattered and fell to the ground around her, like shards of a mirror. \n\nIn Tarte's chest beats the heart of a patriot, and a patriot like her will always love her country and hate its enemies. However, the years of gruelling, tedious exile have taken their toll; her flame burns on, dimmer than ever before.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! §NNeither§!"

### Subideology Descriptions ###
MER_centrism_desc:0 "L'Etablissement Colonial is primarily made up of local and foreign elites under the rule of Governor Geneviève Volière and the closest thing Les Meridiennes has to a political party. There is little in the way of a central ideology; the party ranges from apolitical bureaucrats to the conservative nobility who wish to maintain the status quo. However, L'Etablissement does have one central goal: to continue serving the Crown through the islands' strategic ports, local resources, and trade."
MER_rexism_desc:0 "While many know of the Mouvement Patriote d'Aquileia (MPA) in Aquileia, in reality the nationalist party had its humble origins on the islands under a then young Tarte au Corossol during the First Revolution. Unlike the MPA in the mainland, which has been subverted by so-called "republican" patriots, the MPA in Les Meridiennes continue to profess their undying loyalty to the Crown. However, even on the islands, the MPA is split between the old guard griffons from the mainland and the more racially diverse young officers."
MER_marxism_desc:0 "With Les Meridiennes having a diverse population from different walks of life, it's of little surprise that the ideas of class struggle have spread to the islands as well. A recent development is the Kominote Pawas Entèrelijyon yo (KPEy), a religious society founded by socialist activist Mama Ruby. KPEy claims that the Canteribbean faith is in line with assisting the poor through wealth redistribution and social programs. Unlike the PPH, KPEy's power base is with the blue-collar workers in port cities and local parishes, and there are rumors that their calls for workers' rights may just be a front for Markist ideology..."
MER_harmonic_libertarianism_desc:0 "While most of the isles' nobility are content with maintaining the status quo, there exists a small faction known as the Progressistes Philanthropiques et Harmonistes (PPH), made up mostly of liberal philanthropists with the nobility, rural agrarianists, and Equestrian expatriates who have brought their ideas of harmony to the islands. While loyal to the crown, they advocate a gentler hand of governance, modest social reforms, and wish to turn Les Meridiennes into the prosperous jewel of the Canteribbean."

MER_economic_reform_hearings:0 "Economic Revitalization Hearings"
MER_economic_reform_hearings_desc:0 "Be it Saddle Arabian nobles or Aquileian royalty, Equestrian visitors or zebra wanderers, everycreature has fondly spoken of our little islands and their natural beauty. Very few would say, however, that the Meridiennes are economically viable. Something must be done to reverse this trend, to give our home a niche of its own."
MER_reduce_economic_reliance:0 "Pursue Economic Autonomy"
MER_reduce_economic_reliance_desc:0 "Production of goods and material is sparse and underdeveloped: most is made to satisfy the local needs, while anything luxurious is imported from the Aquileian mainland and our other trading partners. While we cannot expect the Meridiennes to entirely self sufficient, improving the quality of products and expanding existing factories would go a long way towards reversing the downward trend."
MER_develop_second_port:0 "Develop Cocoyer"
MER_develop_second_port_desc:0 "Port Giselda is where all the rustic splendour of the Meridiennes can be fully appreciated. Our culture, our historical landmarks, the bustling docks full of goods and creatures from around the world! However, it is unwise to put all of our eggs in one basket, as the pony expression goes. Promoting the development of Cocoyer would encourage immigration towards the lesser appreciated southern islands."
MER_diversify_exports:0 "Diversify Our Exports"
MER_diversify_exports_desc:0 "What little is shipped abroad can be summed up in two items: rubber and exotic fruit, sold for a pittance. We simply cannot compete with larger and more established nations, who not only export more, but better quality goods too. The first step towards breaking this mold is the expansion of an iron deposit in Cocoyer. It can be refined into steel, a decently valued commodity."
MER_fight_stagnation:0 "Prevent A Recession"
MER_fight_stagnation_desc:0 "The economic situation is slowly becoming untenable. With less and less labour available for locals, there is a growing number of creatures that is able to work, but there is simply no room for them. Idle thoughts lead to either emigration or dangerous sentiments. It cannot be fixed over a day, but large scale (for our size) public projects should temporarily alleviate the problem."
MER_harmonist_solution:0 "The Progressive Method"
MER_harmonist_solution_desc:0 "What connects the few settlements on our islands is mostly dirt trails, with a few cobblestone roads dating to ages past. The automobile has yet to make a large breakthrough, mostly seen as a strange frivolity from the mainland. But the march of progress cannot be avoided, and the civil engineers affilated with the KPEy and PPH have presented a plan that would correct our lack of infrastructure."
MER_traditionalist_solution:0 "The Traditionalists' Argument"
MER_traditionalist_solution_desc:0 "What connects the few settlements on our islands is mostly dirt trails, with a few cobblestone roads dating to ages past. The local cream of the crop wishes to see development similar to the norm of great cities like Vyzima, Aquila or Pelis. To achieve that, certain ideas like labour laws or fair payment should be put aside in the pursuit of progress."
MER_education_reforms:0 "Renovate the University"
MER_education_reforms_desc:0 "The University of Port Giselda, established over a century ago, has never been particularly notable in the quality of its lessons, or the amount of options available for enterprising students. As innovation comes from our best and brightest, we should invest in this institution, bring over more teachers from the mainland. Surely, the expansion of the intellectual group should be one of our priorities."
MER_negotiate_subsidies:0 "Subsidise Key Industries"
MER_negotiate_subsidies_desc:0 "The Meridiennes' economic activity is divided between the fishing sector, rubber plantation owners, small scale tourist attractions and the meagre local production. None of them can be called reasonably successful, barely managing to stay afloat for various reasons. State intervention could and should lead to an economic growth, increasing our revenue and job opportunities for locals."
MER_encourage_intellectuals:0 "Encourage Higher Learning"
MER_encourage_intellectuals_desc:0 "According to recent census results, we've found that only a small minority of our population actively pursues intellectual careers. The stereotype of an islander interested in scarcely more than having a leisurely time could not be stronger, apparently. This minority only accounts for around 1% of our population. Increasing this percetage to 4 would be optimal, and we have ideas how to achieve that."
MER_stable_growth:0 "Stable Growth Achieved"
MER_stable_growth_desc:0 "Fair winds are blowing on our fair isles in recent times. Although the Meridiennes are far from achieving any sort of prosperity, a potential crisis has been averted, and it should be smooth sailing from now on. Perhaps, once the mainlanders hear about our recent improvements, they'll approve a higher budget for the colony?"
MER_letter_to_moriset:0 "Correspondence With The King"
MER_letter_to_moriset_desc:0 "It is the biannual occasion in which [MER.GetLeader] writes an official report to our Aquileian masters. More often than not, it consists mostly of droll tax reports and unsubtle demands for further funding, which would go relatively unnoticed. But for once, we have some actual good news to present to the King, and there's surely a reward waiting for us loyal subjects."

## Revolution (JER is monarchist) ##
MER_the_second_revolution_monarchy:0 "Aquileia In Flames"
MER_the_second_revolution_monarchy_desc:0 "Disaster! Horror! Outrage! Once again, the Ancien Regime is under threat as the revolting Republicans have risen up to reimpose their radical ideology on the mainland. Even if our islands are far from the troubles, the cracks will quickly start to form, should we hesitate. We must convene at once and quickly decide on the next course of action, before the situation grows out of control!"

MER_balance_shifts_moderate:0 "Balanced Priorities" 
MER_balance_shifts_moderate_desc:0 "Although we are beholden to the Aquileian Crown, we also have to consider the welfare of the isles which we call our home and its people. While outright refusing aid is out of the question, perhaps more modest financial support would keep our coffers afloat and avoid popular discontent."

MER_elevate_voices_of_reason:0 "Elevate the Voices of Reason"
MER_elevate_voices_of_reason_desc:0 "Protests by MPA war hawks due to our unwillingness to commit to a state of war against the republicans are to be expected, but the nationalists are not nearly as ideologically unified as we had thought. Some well-planned backroom deals and political maneuvering would help us gain allies outside our usual circles and curb more adventurist ideas."

MER_raise_regional_militias:0 "Raise Rural Militias"
MER_raise_regional_militias_desc:0 "Our professional troops are too tied down in affairs that are better served by regional militias – these militias should be integrated into the colonial army as an official national guard. This will certainly please the Méridionalist wing of the MPA and free up our regulars for military actions elsewhere." 

MER_negotiate_with_warhawks:0 "Placate the Hawks"
MER_negotiate_with_warhawks_desc:0 "We must avoid the same mistakes of 985 and balance between domestic and foreign needs if we want to keep our economy stable through the Second Revolution. The pacifist harmonists and MPA's Méridionalists may be vastly different in ideology, but we can compromise with both to promote economic policies that put our islands' priorities first."

MER_dig_in:0 "Dig In and Pray"
MER_dig_in_desc:0 "#TODO We dont't really know WHAT to expect. You can never be too careful, especially in a position as vulnerable as ours, far away from the protection of our currently preoccupied liege. We will reinforce our cities by restoring age-old defenses and bolstering them with new ones. What's more, we should be able to spin this as military involvement and get the interventionists off our backs"

MER_buff_ourselves:0 "The Babineaux Plan"
MER_buff_ourselves_desc:0 "#TODO we will strive to distinguish ourselves on the battlefield, demonstrating our capacity for independent military initiatives. rather than adopting the aquileian doctrine of defense, we shall play to our own strengths and strike the enemy where they are weak"

MER_buff_aquileia:0 "Bring NCOs Out of Retirement"
MER_buff_aquileia_desc:0 "#TODO we have lots of retired NCO types just sitting about not doing anything. let's send em over to lend a helping hand."

MER_detrimental_enthusiasm:0 "Detrimental Enthusiasm"
MER_detrimental_enthusiasm_desc:0 "#TODO an event about an idiot appointee making the mistake of directing military production directly towards Aquileia in exchange for some equipment"

MER_patriotic_speech:0 "#TODO patriotic speech"
MER_patriotic_speech_desc:0 "#TODO The Governess' speech will probably scripted to vary based on sub-path"

MER_balance_shifts_radical:0 "Take Action"
MER_balance_shifts_radical_desc:0 "As far as we are from the mainland, we cannot just simply lay idly on our laurels while good Aquileians are fighting for what's right. The isles have always been devoted subjects of the Crown, and within each of our hearts (those harbouring dissident thoughts will be prosecuted) is an earnest desire to prove ourselves. We must take a stand, for the King and proud Aquileia!"

MER_send_help:0 "The First Wave"
MER_send_help_desc:0 "#TODO it will take some time to fully shift ourselves to a war-ready state, but in the meantime, lets send some manpower!"

MER_arms_shipments:0 "Send Weapon Shipments"
MER_arms_shipments_desc:0 "The Meridiennes maintain a miniscule arms industry, intended completely for local purposes of keeping order. We have not seen battles in quite a while, and as a result, a considerable stockpile of admittedly dated firearms has grown over the past years. Instead of rusting in armouries, we should send everything we can spare to our friends at the mainland. Every little bit helps, and we must prove ourselves."

MER_deepen_involvement:0 "Deepen Involvement"
MER_deepen_involvement_desc:0 "#TODO if we wish to see victory against those who would threaten the status quo, we must be ready to commit ourselves fully to the defense of our brothers at home. "

MER_send_actual_volunteers:0 "Send Volunteers"
MER_send_actual_volunteers_desc:0 "The blood of the patriots calls to action! Many creatures have demanded recently to be sent to battle, and their number has grown to a worrying amount. If we do not approve their requests, they could very well incite riots with their behaviour. Thus it is settled: anycreature willing to die for King and Aquileia will be given passage to the mainland, with enough gear to sustain themselves in combat."

MER_join_the_fray:0 "Join the Fray"
MER_join_the_fray_desc:0 "#TODO The mainland is devored by the fire of war. It is our duty to directly intervene to help the Crown!"

MER_wait_it_out:0 "With Bated Breaths, We Watched"
MER_wait_it_out_desc:0 ""We've done all that we could, distant as we are, leaving us only to wait and listen for any news from the mainland. Information will take days to arrive, but I will pray for the King's success in combating these filthy insurgents. Aquileia has the Discrets; she needs no 'president' or 'republic'.""

MER_old_fart:0 "Vieux Croûton"
MER_vieux_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 14 May, 935, in Port Giselda, Les Meridiennes\n\n§YBiography:§! Vieux Croûton is a retired general of a bygone era; graduating abroad at the École Militaire, Croûton's unassuming appearance hid a subtle mind which allowed him to gradually rise up the ranks. After Aquileia's secession, Croûton proposed a set of reforms within the newly founded Armée Royale, but his ideas came to nothing due rampant nepotism in the military. Disillusioned, Croûton decided to accept a posting in the Les Meridiennes.\n\nAs revolution raged in the mainland, Croûton eventually became involved in the nascent MPA on the islands. Incidentally, the de Navets fled to Les Meridiennes, where one stallion fell in love with Croûton's daughter; their easy-going lifestyle conflicted with Croûton's upbringing and increasingly fanatical militarism. His relationship soured with his daughter, who accused him of neglecting his family over his career. After the First Revolution, his daughter returned back to the mainland, where they lost touch with one another.\n\nMore than two decades later, his hitherto unknown grandson, Ragoût de Navet, was assigned to the same post as him – his daughter had long passed away due to her health instability. Regretful of his past zealotry, Croûton found a new meaning in his life to become a new familial figure to Ragoût.

MER_oiseau_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 18 October, 938, in Aquila, Aquileia\n\n§YBiography:§! The second of three children of the Gériatrique family, Oiseau was expected to take up a military career, much like his father and grandfather. Oiseau was a slacker in his youth, finding outdoor sports more interesting than sessions on philosophy. Once he was of age, he enlisted into the Reichsarmee, where he found his calling in military engineering.\n\nOnce Aquileia broke free from the Empire, Oiseau became responsible for the kingdom's fortifications. One of his main plans was the construction of the "Redoute Nord" to defend the northern border. His achievements caught the notice of a young Vieux Croûton, and realizing that they had much in common, they became close friends.\n\nDuring the revolution, Oiseau remained in the mainland to fight against the republicans. Regrouping in the Périphérie, Oiseau gathered supplies for the restorationists before pushing south with the loyalists to reclaim the country. This effort earned him much praise after the fighting – for Oiseau, it was just his duty. He had no ambitions of delving into Aquileian politics in the aftermath, and after another decade of loyal service, Oiseau was rewarded with reassignment to Les Meridiennes, essentially a vacation for the aging griff.\n\nIt was on the islands that he was reunited with Vieux once more. With the privileges that came with his high military rank, Oiseau enjoys gambling and smoking cigars in his pastime. He may be living out his retirement years at Les Meridiennes, but the griff senses that there may be something still here for him to do."

MER_soup_defaux_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 970 ALB\n\n§YBiography:§! In the time of the first Aquileian Counterrevolution, Albert Berthelot and his Monarchists drew in every able-bodied creature they could to fight and die for the Discret Restoration, and of all those who went from worthlessness to importance through their role in the conflict, few have given as much as Soup Defaux.\nBorn to a low-class Pridean family, Defaux joined the navy as a deck-swabber on the nation’s flagship. By all accounts, he did this just fine, yet on a terrible day in 985, when the city of Pridea burned and Defaux was only 15, he caught the eye of Dennis “The Menace” Discret. The captain noticed the sailor, barely more than a child, and stuffed him into the closet housing a casemate cannon with orders to keep loading shells until told otherwise. And Defaux did this, first for an hour, then three, then six, until Pridea was rubble.\nSupposedly, he was scorched black when he was allowed out, and it may not have only been on the outside. He was very different when he came out, and the loss of his parents in the destruction only made it worse. Regardless, having been noticed by Dennis, he was able to become a career officer and begin climbing through the ranks. He ended the war as a Junior Lieutenant and stayed in the navy.\nThen, a few years later, he beat one Lieutenant Smoke, a fellow officer, to death in a dispute. It was found that he was unable to pass a psychological evaluation. For his years of faithful service, Dennis interceded in his life one last time and managed to get him promoted to Admiral – at the cost of being sent to Les Meridiennes for the rest of his life, likely to never see any combat or adventure ever again.\nIt was fine by him. Being a sailor was never his dream. But sometimes, the cannons are all firing at full speed, and explosions sound off a distant coast, and the tension seems to fade from his muscles. \n§YPortrait by:§! §GRyanBoi§!"

MER_simon_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 968 ALB\n\n§YBiography:§! Hailing from a village just beyond Port Giselda on Belle-Ile, Simon Volière developed a profound affinity for the sea and the sailor's life from an early age. It was during a fishing trip with his father that he first laid eyes on an Aquileian warship, igniting within him a fervent desire to join the Navy.\nWith determination, he delved into the study of mathematics, navigation, and other requisite skills, aspiring to enroll in the Naval Academy. Simon's dreams materialized when he secured admission to the École Navale Royale in Aquileia. Transitioning from a brief tenure in the Aquileian fleet, he found his niche in the Meridienne Squadron.\nLeveraging his intimate knowledge of the surrounding waters, Simon excelled in navigation, steadily ascending through the ranks. His career received a significant boost when a cousin ascended to the esteemed position of Royal Governor. Although he identifies as a staunch Royalist, his experience in Aquileia fostered a profound mistrust of King Moriset. No matter what happens in Aquileia he loves his island home and will do anything to protect it."

Trema would then be raised by a hippogriff family from whom he'd hear tales of bounty hunters adventuring to stave off swarms of pirates, only to realize that that was supposed to be the marines' job. Wonder turned to optimistic patriotism as he signed up for said marines, but he quickly discovered that the armed forces were in a sorry state—from lack of funds to Aquileia-based corruption, these permanently etched in his heart a lesson about colonies: they are nothing without their overlords—and who's to say if said overlords will kind and understanding for the foreseeable?\n\nIt took only a few weeks of expending his youthful charisma among his battalion for them to understand the sorry state of the colonies. This capture of the hearts of so many marines caught the eye of a certain Shine Light who would then select Trema as his first friend in the arena of national politics, and the rest was history.\n\nNowadays, apart from his explicitly political endeavors, Trema di Koko has also invested in an adoption center, bringing his life to a sort of virtuous full circle."
MER_allende_expy:0 "Shine Light"
MER_allende_expy_desc:0 "The stamp of legitimacy for Les Meridiennes' leftist movement, Shine Light has often straddled the line between two worlds—old and new, rich and poor, a seemingly elitist face always choosing the option for the lower classes—in pursuit of the isles' liberation.\n\nComing from royalist Aquileian parents who'd recently moved to the islands, Shine would be tutored at lush private schools where his thirst for knowledge led him to uncover unsavory truths about the very families his mother and father conversed with, flashing so much wealth at each other without caring for their subjects who lived on these far-off lands. Leaving most of his privileges behind, Shine entered the field of activism, publishing pamphlets and conversing with contenders in the political sphere, always pushing for reform... and sometimes picking up ideological compatriots along the way from all walks of life.\n\nAgainst the stereotype of nobility-hanging radicals, Shine Light has thus been hailed as a sensible and rational voice for progressive thought. A few, however, decry this as waffling indecision. Through it all, one thing is clear: he is determined, and he trusts in himself and in his friends that, when the time is right, they'll entirely alter the islands—and then the world."
MER_yarah_roselle:0 "Yarah Roselle"

Up until a few years ago, the stretch of ocean that separated the three continents swapped tales of her misdeeds, all while she amassed herself no small fortune.\n\nYarah then vanished from the radar, which meant one less pirate to deal with. It would surprise quite a few, then, that her re-appearance in Les Meridiennes was accompanied by none other than the local religious leader Mama Ruby, and that Yarah herself had renounced her swashbuckling ways to travel on the divine threefold path of the Holy Watraz, Aitraz, and Yah.\n\nYet, in strange way, that yearning for freedom she'd experienced as a brigand never disappeared, instead latching onto more productive causes: anti-imperialism across the globe. For all the political upheaval that would cause, however, she talks about it in good cheer and kindness. Why be so angry when, in the end, she knows how the story will end: with the world and its creatures made whole and united by the Gods?"

However, when she can't help but witness the march of history—with the inevitable clashes of the classes springing up around the world—why, indeed, must the revolution here delay?\n\nSet on this trajectory by a family of dockyard workers, Temperada can be found these days stirring up the hornet's nest of mass movement among this generation of seaside laborers, championing their cause in the form of rallies and speeches that often get her on the front page of next day's news. Yet, for all her successful praxis, her theory has made her inflexible to more methodical paths to progress, more than once risking outright revolt that would've ended messily for the island's left-wing movement.\n\nStill, a volatile weapon like her, when put in the right claws, can be of immense use, although, with her constant calls for action no matter how bold or brash, she may better be described as the conscience—pricking the soul of a righteous crusade lest it fall into sloth."

Her present life is one of control. A top dog in the most literal sense, Ceaux-Ceaux has amassed favors scattered across the islands' nobility as well as influence among the various sectors of the economy as a patron of the arts. What the Laroche scion wants, the Laroche scion gets with ease, though she claims it is not out of self-enrichment but out of a sincere belief of "ancient nobles taking up arms and coin to guide the masses for their betterment." \n\nTherefore, she has made herself a linchpin of the colony's old aristocracy, gaining their loyalty by propping up "the fashionable chivalry of Aquileia" with flashy galas and feasts for the public—and threats and blackmail behind the scenes in case the low-born mob try to overrule her principled rule. If anyone wants to enact more than token reforms, they would have to contend with the bulwark of stubborn conservatism that is Ceaux-Ceaux."

Born into a family of humble shopkeepers, Breezy Bloom inevitably took the helm once she was of age. With her siblings, she grew her family’s shop to succeed and support her parents who sacrificed so much to care for her. After finding an intelligent and strong stallion, she too grew her own family, being a kind mother, wife, and mare for all in her town.\n...well, that’s what she often daydreams about, anyways. In reality, her parents drowned when she was 3, their ship sunk by a republican torpedo. They may have been volunteers against the rebellion, but their deaths were as real as any other soldier. Perhaps out of pity, the leading officer of her parents took Breezy and trained her from a young age to make her self-sufficient, strong, and untrusting of others. Despite this tough "parenting," the little foal grew into a powerful, intelligent mare.\nFilled with militaristic values and a hatred for the republican rebels, she eventually found a common cause with the MPA, before eventually joining the military forces of the islands and rising to the rank of Colonel. Her skills, and her brutality, made her a force to be reckoned with. Her drive for revenge put her on the frontlines of any battle. Rage filled her hooves with each shot, each punch, and each stab. Pirates were common victims, but any mission involving republican rebels took priority for her. For this mare, nothing would be better than wiping all rebel scum off the planet. And if she died? Well, at least she died for her homeland.\nAs she continued to drown in the blood of her victims, however, a new face appeared. Yet, none of her training prepared her for Navet. Though initially annoyed with his naivety, she found his honest nature relieving, and a friendship quickly sparked between them. However, as they grew closer, fighting developed a bitter feeling to it. Her mind filled up with questions. What was she really fighting for? She could ignore them for a while, but eventually, she would have to find the answer – no matter how deep into her heart it would penetrate. \n§YPortrait by:§! §GFly_Over§!"

### March Decisions ###
MER_securing_griffonia:0 "Securing Griffonia"
MER_securing_griffonia_desc:0 "#TODO subjugating an entire continent is a lot of work."
MER_securing_north:0 "#TODO"
MER_securing_north_desc:0 "After the great struggles endured during the War with the Empire, the task of seizing the northern realms is expected to be more of the same. Though the region of Cloudbury proper should be easy enough to pick off, the difficulty arises in the areas immediately surrounding it. If we are to wrap this campaign up quickly, we must be ready to face the harsh terrains ahead."
MER_securing_south:0 "#TODO"
MER_securing_south_desc:0 "The newest campaign is against the nations of Griffonia's south. In this, we have a unique opportunity, since it would not at all be hard for us to send our navy and our world-class marines to open up a second front. It doesn't have to take the entire country, just demand enough of their attention that the main army can win."
MER_securing_hillponies:0 "#TODO"
MER_securing_hillponies_desc:0 "The hillponies are not called as such for no reason. Their lands are rugged and not at all conductive to large-scale operations, and that is how they have survived this long in spite of their backwards technology. Unfortunately for them, we know a thing or two about fighting in the hills, as we have one somewhere around here."
MER_securing_minotaurs:0 "#TODO"
MER_securing_minotaurs_desc:0 "Compared to the conquests of the Southern states, the nations of the Eler Sea present new challenges - which we are even more well-suited towards overcoming. The glory of Aquileia will soon be upon them when we land directly on the rear lines of our enemies!"
MER_securing_riverlanders:0 "#TODO"
MER_securing_riverlanders_desc:0 "One of the last bastions of retrograde holdouts on the continent is the River Federation. Empress Vivienne has now decided to take the sword to them who think their numbers can save them, and we shall be at her back to prove them wrong!"
MER_securing_east:0 "#TODO"
MER_securing_east_desc:0 "The former Griffonian Empire's eastern reaches were an odd place. Their terrain was largely plains and forests, with just enough mountains and rivers to make for some odd boundaries. The armies there are not particularly strong, but their lands are vast and easily defended in spite of that. The corollary: we can often just run right past them, and should plan for it."

MER_juggling_factions_tt:0 "§gThe Colony of Les Meridiennes is an oddity within the Kingdom of Aquileia. Having avoided the bloodshed of the First Revolution, it had been seen as free from the stain of Republicanism and had likewise been spared from King Moriset's resultant cleansing. As such, a wide array of interest groups have been able to form, each falling more or less under respective ideological umbrellas and making it possible to more easily deal with them collectively. Seeing as how the King, as well as many within the colonial administration, are apparently satisfied with this outcome, it is unlikely that this will change very soon.\n§!"

# Member Tooltips - NOTE - Written from Geneviève's POV #
MER_member_icon_tt:0 "[GetMERMemberDesc]"
MER_sod_supremacy_desc_tt_0:0 "The 'Les Méridionalistes' originate in the isles, and justify their elitism and nationalism with academics. Regardless of their attempts to soften their rhetoric, or hide it through big words, they're still nationalists and no friend of harmony. Extremely difficult to debate or argue against, most of their members are skilled in rhetorical craft."

MER_sod_supremacy_desc_tt_1:0 "The hardcore wing of the MPA is known as the 'La Gériatrie'. If it weren't for their geriatric nature they would be more of a threat politically, and in more reasonable times would be dismissed as a band of grumpy old greybeards. Unfortunately they form a solid demographic that can be counted on to support other anti-harmonist groups. Angry old birds, grasping at their last chance to be relevant."

MER_sod_harmony_desc_tt_0:0 "The 'Expatriate Business Mares' in their mother tongue, and 'Juments D'affaires Expatriées' to ours, hail mostly from Equestria. They can be counted on as strong supporters of harmony, and bring with them good ideas from Equestria. Curiously the group isn't solely female, the name is just a reflection of Equestrian social conventions."

MER_sod_harmony_desc_tt_1:0 "Stuffy nobility, but not completely unreasonable. They have a decent sense of charity- I think if more nobility acted like them we'd have less communists. Led by INSERT GRIFFON HERE, quite the charmer. They often throw the sort of thousand gold-piece per plate fundraisers the wealthy adore, and can be considered an ally for liberal policies. Probably nothing too radical though, in the end they still value comfort over social justice. Still known to chafe at taxation, they view themselves as better handlers of social programs through charity than the state."

MER_sod_harmony_desc_tt_2:0 "Trot Barley, always good company. When I think of him I think of fresh apple pie and good conversation. He leads the Barleyan Yute Fawmas, which I associate more with him than anything else. They're an agrarian movement, certainly not radical but cynical towards industrialization. Good friends to have, but their pessimism towards the modern world can be frustrating. When it comes to actual policy, they're always cynical of anything that can be viewed as pushing us towards cities and machines, but a stalwart ally for social liberalization."

MER_sod_communism_desc_tt_0:0 "Facilier is a name more heard than seen, and his clique of radical communists is more rumoured than it is actually known. He's been seen with Mama Ruby, and strangely one of the only things we do know about him is his immense contributions to her religious wing. The organization itself seems to be a cult of personality around their leader, and so learning their intentions means learning his. Unfortunately, nobody really knows much about him beyond his name and some left-wing connections. Altogether spooky group, if politicians hate anything it's uncertainty- and they are made of it."

MER_sod_communism_desc_tt_1:0 "Mama Ruby is a kind soul, and leads a group of socialists in peaceful lobbying for greater social services. They tend to spend more time philosophizing and focusing on spirituality than politics, but often align themselves with other left-leaning groups. Anybody seeking to undue welfare programs will find them a stubborn and surprisingly stalwart opponent."

MER_sod_neutrality_desc_tt_0:0 "I like to call the old nobility the leashed bitches, and CeauxCeaux Laroche holds them close. They're the last gasp of the old guard, with a fixation on the status quo and deeply resentful of any attempts to change anything from postage stamps to social services. Their blue-blood wealth allows them to hate an outsized influence in politics, and you can always count on them to whine about any welfare programs, and scream bloody murder about taxation."

MER_sod_neutrality_desc_tt_1:0 "It's a simple matter of fact that the bureaucracy doesn't ultimately care who's in charge. From the postbird to the deputy secretary of water-works, the well-suited government class tends to follow the winds. I have little doubts about my own friends, but it's always worrying to know that the government could change overnight and all it would mean for the bureaucrats is a new painting on the wall."

MER_sod_neutrality_desc_tt_2:0 "Non-Partisans are an ironic lot. Claiming to be disinteresting in politics and above it, they form their own demographic. The contradiction is seemingly lost on them, as they are quick to unite and form a stubborn bloc of opposition towards more radical ideas."

MER_sod_communism_folder_tt:0 "#TODO I don't really get how the highly spiritual and generally apolitical §YMama Ruby§! could ever be thought of as a dirty §Rcommunist§!, but I'm assuming it has something to do with all the charity.

MER_sod_neutrality_folder_tt:0 "Most of the §ggovernment§! is made up of conservative nobles and bureaucrats who care little about who is in charge.

Especially with Ceaux-Ceaux leading the nobility – she knows how to get on my nerves sometimes."

meridiennes_history.1.t:0 "Tropical Genesis" #TODO rework the Cacicazgos to be less associated with chiefdoms. 
meridiennes_history.1.d:0 "The Canteribbean is named for its islands, but it is its people that define the region and make its history. Yet, remarkably little is known about the region before the arrival of foreign explorers, as much of the history is confined to unreliable oral traditions or was lost to time. Still, at least some facts can be discerned.\n\nThe islands that make up the modern colony of Les Meridiennes were settled quite late in terms of world history, being too small, uninviting, or just too unknown to attract serious attention. Arriving long after Equestria began to be widely populated, the first permanent inhabitants of the islands were members of the three pony tribes. These pioneers were part of the tail-end of a wave of settlers that populated Puerto Caballo and the Summer Islands among other islands. According to legends, they were made aware of the scattered islands only by following patterns of migratory birds. In the first century ALB, the inhabitants were joined by a smaller number of batponies who were fleeing from the outburst of prejudice in mainland Equus that followed the banishment of Princess Luna. Isolated from developments on the mainland, the ponies of the Canteribbean welcomed them with a cosmopolitan warmness that would become a key feature of their cultural identity.\n\nThe land itself was found to be similarly generous. The plentiful cassava became a staple food, supplemented by maize, while an abundance of fruit was cultivated in orchard-gardens and supplied by freshwater mountain streams. To organise their living in this environment, a system of Cacicazgos, or small chiefdoms, developed among the ponies. Despite the potential for conflict between villages over the centuries, friendship and cooperation seemed to prevail."

meridiennes_history.2.t:0 "The Confederation" #TODO rework the confederation to be less native-y
meridiennes_history.2.d:0 "The islands’ idyll could only last as long as the outside world did not take note. But in the seventh century ALB, that is exactly what happened. Explorers from across the world swarmed to the Canteribbean, driven by a desire to claim for their patrons the islands’ natural bounty. The natives extended their iconic warm welcome to these strangers, sometimes even to their own detriment, but as explorers built permanent structures and expanded their influence, attitudes began to change.\n\nThe year 650, just after Coltlumbus established New Mareland, saw the apex of this disorganised rush. Equestrian magistrates made claims on the islands by appealing to the locals’ alleged loyalty. In this, they were bitterly disputed by Sicameonese merchants who built trading posts in the eastern archipelago, and by Saddle Arabian merchants and Hippogriffian expeditionaries who established themselves in the south. The competition between these outside forces disrupted the islanders’ lives and often pitted Cacicazgos under foreign influence against each other, almost to the point of violence.\n\nHorrified at these developments, three of the largest remaining independent Cacicazgos began to cooperate to resist external influence. They were the Maneua of modern-day Belle-Île, the northern Xarhoof, and the Hayuey in the south.  From 665, the three chiefdoms defied alluring promises from outsiders until in early 670 they founded the Caciazgo, or the Confederation of the Isle.\n\nTo commemorate their new-found unity, an impressive ceremonial plaza was built in Maneua territory, in the centre of what would much later become Port-Giselda. Despite outward confidence, prolonged backroom disputes over the plaza’s location and construction cast a foreboding shadow on whether the loose confederation was truly capable of uniting the islanders like it was intended."

meridiennes_history.3.t:0 "Paradise Lost" #TODO rework to be less native-y
meridiennes_history.3.d:0 "Despite the creation of the native Caciazgo (Confederation) in 670, the next two decades would see foreign influence reach a victorious crescendo. Over the 670s, the Hippogriffs abandoned their efforts to consolidate the Trots and Canters Islands, while the Sicameonese merchants were driven to bankruptcy as their ships were harassed by renewed dragon piracy over the Mareiana Trench. This left the Equestrians and Saddle Arabians as the only major contenders for influence in the region.\n\nThe effort these two powers made to stake their claim on the Canteribbean was disproportionate. Saddle Arabian merchants took great care to ingratiate themselves with the locals in order to legitimise their presence. They petitioned for support from the Emir’s court which sent gifts and talented negotiators, along with cartographers and resource surveyors to stake their claim. In contrast, exerting control over the islands was a mere passion project for certain Equestrian administrators who took the loyalty of the pony population for granted. When the South-Eastern administration was reshuffled in 680, Equestria’s claims to the distant islands faded away into disinterest.\n\nMeanwhile, disheartened by constant disputes over the division of responsibilities, individual Cacicazgos quietly left the Confederation and placed themselves under Saddle Arabian protection, drawn by the promise of economic prosperity. The Saddle Arabians’ introduction of exotic goods like coffee beans and bananas as well as their control of trade ports increased dependency on their merchants, who were by now pushing for full incorporation of the islands. After a tense period of negotiations, the depleted Confederation signed away its sovereignty in 690 with the Treaty of Arubeira, which incorporated the Confederation into Saddle Arabia but granted it nominal jurisdiction over the islands so that the merchants could get down to business without distraction."

meridiennes_history.4.t:0 "Life Goes On"
meridiennes_history.4.d:0 "While some expected life under the Saddle Arabians to be one lived under the iron hoof of foreign domination, this fear never materialised. Instead, life went on much like before for most ponies, despite important changes arriving upon their shores. The Caciazgo was gradually made into a functional form of native self-governance through the introduction of the unifying authority of an Emir (Arabian Governor) and the extension of rigorous Arabian civil laws and courts to the islands. Ironically, the Confederation faded away soon after, merging entirely with the Arabian administration. Aided by Arabian merchants eager for returns on their investments, the ponies of the Canteribbean were finally in a position to dip their hooves into the modern world which beckoned from across seas.\n\nOnly, the islands were no longer inhabited just by ponies anymore. When explorers took an interest in the Canteribbean in the seventh centuries, many formed or joined communities that outlasted their governments’ investment but remained welcome by the cosmopolitan natives. Hippogriffs, zebras, griffons, Equestrian ponies, and of course horses from Saddle Arabia now formed a notable minority in many islands and infused parts of their cultures into the land.\n\nHowever, only the last of these groups could count on official support that would make their contributions entrenched. Arabian architecture permeated in many newly built structures, and although no official attempt at assimilation was made, natives adopted foods like falafel into their diets and Arabian clothing spread among the local elites. Arabian merchants also brought along with them their indentured servants, mostly donkeys, who began to cultivate traditional herbs and spices, like the ganja plant that was used for medicinal purposes and later gained local cultural significance."

meridiennes_history.5.t:0 "Conflict in Paradise"
meridiennes_history.5.d:0 "The appointment of Emir Hisan in 781 began a saga that would upset the balance in the peaceful region. With great ambitions on his mind, on the day he arrived the Emir marched into the notorious gaming house in Mina' Alsalahif and demanded a one-time tax from the patrons. Infuriated, a band of regulars led by Alejandra Muñoz stormed a docked merchant ship and took off. Within a year, they were joined by three other armed vessels that enforced a sustained campaign of piracy on the islands, being careful to avoid ships flying the Arabian colours to placate their lethargic navy. This was small consolation to the locals who had to live under an atmosphere of fear, especially when the rowdy pirates would come onshore with impunity after bribing the small Arabian garrison and drunkenly ransack a port of their choosing.\n\nDetermined to secure aid from his patrons in person, Emir Hisan embarked for Saddle Arabia in early 783. Alas, soon after departing, his ship crossed paths with the pirate fleet which barrelled towards him, sensing an easy mark. But before they could close, the pirates were driven off by a volley of canonfire launched by a large vessel emerging from a secluded island, as if by divine intervention. The Emir’s saviour, Guillaume LeBlanc, an Aquileian corsair-turned-merchant, was indignant upon hearing of the Emir’s troubles. He persuaded the Emir to return to the islands to organise a militia by employing his crew as advisors and arms-suppliers instead of relying on a distant court.\n\nAt the end of the year, their efforts led a few dozen locals to be declared combat-ready. The Emir set a high-stakes trap by relocating his treasury to a less secure location to lure the pirates onshore. Upon arrival, the pirates were set upon by the militia laying in wait. Their engagement was chaotic and bloody, lasting an entire day as the pirates retreated into the jungle, and only surrendered after Muñoz was killed by a venomous snake. To commemorate what would become known as the first military conflict fought on the Canteribbean islands, the Emir offered LeBlanc’s crew to settle on the islands and declared a state of unending friendship between Aquileia and Saddle Arabia, much to the confusion of the two courts."
meridiennes_history.5.a:0 "Friendship beats piracy. Always."

meridiennes_history.6.t:0 "Gracious Gift of Tropics"
meridiennes_history.6.d:0 "While the islands remained safe from piracy, they could not be shielded from global economic trends. In truth, long before Emir Hisan’s arrival, the islands were losing economic value. While still turning a profit, the Canteribbean was no longer the golden goose Arabian merchants once imagined it as. Technological improvements allowed merchant ships to cross continents without the need for rest in a quaint tropical port, while the Zebrican interior was further opened to trade which diminished the need for goods sourced from the islands.\n\nWhile contributing to decline in its own way, the piracy debacle of 781-83 rather dramatically exposed the lack of interest in the islands felt by the Arabian court. What could have been solved in weeks dragged on for years and relied on intervention by a random foreign merchant. Realising his leash was longer than he thought, the Emir began asserting his independence over the next year by claiming rights normally reserved for the mainland court and developing the new militia force. In secret, the Emir began shopping around for a foreign partner that would prove more interested in investing in the islands, already having rebuked Equestrian officials out of fears they would infringe on the rights of the locals.\n\nUpon hearing of the forced marriage of Giselda Discet to Emperor Grover II following Aquileia’s conquest in 785, the Emir pounced. Animated by a fondness for Aquileia after his close escape and reasoning that a defeated kingdom would have every reason to take a genuine interest in a new possession, the Emir sent his friend, Guillaume LeBlanc, to Aquileia to deliver an extraordinary wedding gift to the Queen - the islands of the Canteribbean themselves. The handover itself was a fait accompli, with Aquileian soldiers arriving before news even reached the disappointed Arabian court. Emir Hisan returned to Saddle Arabia to smooth things over and his descendants would remain steadfast friends of both Aquileia and the Canteribbean.\n\nAccepting excitedly, Queen Giselda even decided to spend her honeymoon on the islands, making sure to drag Grover II to every native site possible, amazed at the “independence” and “resilience” displayed by the locals and personally commending the Emir for the respect he’d shown to the “cultural autonomy” of the natives, all in earshot of her grumpy husband."

meridiennes_history.7.t:0 "Two Peaceful Centuries"
meridiennes_history.7.d:0 "Despite the Emir’s high hopes of immediate Aquileian investments, it took a while for the defeated kingdom to make proper use of their newfound possession. During the first few years of Aquileian control, it was actually other imperial subjects who capitalised on the potential of the islands. Of special note are the Feathisians, who poured investment capital into four villages on the archipelago of Les Abondantes, hoping to gain influence over the native labourforce. Most of these ventures eventually failed, with the exception of Deshayes which became a thriving town and remains tightly integrated with the Van Stiphout company to this day.\n\nOnce Aquileians brought their full attention to the islands it became clear that they saw their new possession explicitly as a colony which was to host a griffon majority in order to ensure its loyalty. Initial colonisation efforts were restricted to the families of officials and merchants in order to avoid abusing the locals’ hospitality. However, Grover II’s invasion and incorporation of Sicameon was to prove a watershed moment for the griffon population on the islands. Eager to flee their devastated home, many Sicameonese recalled romantic tales of their ancestors living overseas in prosperity and peace. Some of these dreamers turned to Les Meridiennes, where they were happily incorporated into existing Sicameonese-speaking communities and welcomed as refugees by the natives, regardless of the scale of their immigration.\n\nThe influx of immigrants revitalised Les Meridiennes. Those who came were available to work on the plantations which were more productive than ever due to the introduction of modern tools and techniques. Immigrants often maintained connection with the mainland and were able to stimulate demand for Canteribbean products by word of beak alone, which helped the islands’ economy. Good fortune would continue to bless the islands with steady economic growth and a placid political situation persisted even after Aquileia broke off from the Empire in 972. For a time."

meridiennes_history.8.t:0 "Arrival of Disaster"
meridiennes_history.8.d:0 "While Les Meridiennes was becoming better connected to the wider world, it still took a Pridean flotilla fleeing to their shores to notify the islands of the First Aquileian Revolution. Governor Bernadette Vidal reacted with speed and decisiveness. Les Meridiennes was placed on high alert with militia forces mustered, bearing their most threatening-looking flintlocks, ready to combat any revolutionary activity. But the islands were quiet. The locals’ loyalties were further confirmed when they extended their typical warm welcome by offering shelter and food to the monarchist exiles who began to arrive in droves. The religious ceremonies performed by the native ponies to bless their new friends even won over the Rileans who looked at the backwards tropical islands with utter despair, although they may have found the chants more entertaining than inspirational.\n\nReceiving orders from Marechal Berthelot, leader of the monarchist resistance on the mainland, Governor Vidal met with the exiled monarchists, hoping to stave off rising hopelessness or potential disorder by focusing their attention on future plans. She laid out her view - the islands were remarkably loyal, completely isolated from the reach of the Republicans, and, she assured them, utterly committed to serving the kingdom as best they could. The following weeks saw Port-Giselda’s telegraph office swamped with griffons in royal army uniforms. Ships packed with correspondence cycled in and out of port under the heaviest escort they’ve ever seen, aiming for the Griffonian coast.\n\nIn the Canteribbean, safe from Republican clutches, the inklings of a plan were coming together. A plan for a counter-revolution."

meridiennes_history.9.t:0 "Patriots’ Debut"
meridiennes_history.9.d:0 "Soon after the exiles' arrival, the islands received even more special visitors - the remaining members of the Discret royal family. Most did not venture outside the capital, impatient to transit to a more acceptable place of exile. However, some like the future Duke Gadiffer took the time to tour the countryside and appreciate  the same places as Queen Giselda saw on her honeymoon. The royal presence boosted morale among the monarchists but remained brief due to an invitation from the descendents of Emir Hisan, the islands’ former Aquileiaphile governor, offering refuge in their luxurious palace in Saddle Arabia.\n\nDespite the Discrets’ departure, preparation for the counter-revolution continued in Les Meridiennes. The lone military factory on the islands was renovated with émigré aid and began working on strenuous long shifts staffed by local griffons to keep up continuous production of small arms. Textile artisans worked overtime to outfit the monarchist forces while Aquileia-owned plantations provided sugar rations to sweeten the effort.\n\nIn 983, a young batpony named Tarte Au Corossol gained acclaim among the exiles for leading a group of local youths to expel alleged republican spies trying to unionise a weapons workshop. After repeated interventions, she quickly gained a cult following among the most passionate Aquileians and they soon founded the Mouvement Patriotique Aquilien (MPA), a group devoted to a monarchist Aquileian nation. The organisation would become intimately involved with the mobilisation, encouraging workers to put in unpaid overtime, sending members to oversee production in workshops, and arranging marches and events to instil patriotic spirit.\n\nWhile local harmonists saw the MPA as disruptive, there is no denying that their tactics led to broad increases in productivity and rallied the wavering exiles. Most of all, the MPA proved that Les Meridiennes was, and would forever remain, loyal to the crown."

meridiennes_history.10.t:0 "The Counter Revolution"
meridiennes_history.10.d:0 "As preparations for counter-revolution progressed, the exiles began to extend their effort beyond the islands. Leading the charge were members of Tarte’s MPA, who volunteered to infiltrate the mainland in order to organise monarchist resistance cells. Unexpectedly, the MPA’s zeal proved popular among many Aquileians, especially in Westkeep, and the movement would grow in mainstream popularity. The exile navy was placed under the command of Baron Dennis, another sympathiser of the movement. The ships were bolstered by upgrades procured from Equestrian and Wingbardian shipyards in preparation for their homecoming.\n\nWhen Marechal Albert Berthelot, leader of the mainland monarchist movement, signalled his readiness to begin the counter-revolution in 985, the exiles of Les Meridiennes moved into action. Baron Dennis took the fleet to smash any republican vessels before moving to bombard republican forces along the Aquileian coast, culminating in the shelling of Pridea. Monarchist forces made up of both exiles and newly recruited locals took advantage of the republican disorganisation and made simultaneous landings all along the coast. Pushing inland and towards major cities, they were joined by jubilant MPA partisans and Berthelot’s forces. Overwhelmed by the decisive assault, republican leadership collapsed into chaos, paving the way for the restoration of the rightful Discret dynasty."

meridiennes_history.11.t:0 "The Restoration Recession"
meridiennes_history.11.d:0 "Praise was showered upon Les Meridiennes for the vital role the islands played in the Restoration. However, gratitude notwithstanding, when the exiles returned home they withdrew most of their investments while the sudden depopulation of domestic consumers hit the economy hard. The second punch would come from the royal government itself, when in 990 the mainland beet sugar industry received a significant royal subsidy, making sugar cane plantations in Les Meridiennes unable to compete, bringing significant knock-on effects to the entire export economy.\n\nIn response to frantic requests from Governor Vidal, the court eventually sent Lord Monnet to investigate the conditions on the islands. His 992 report would become the blueprint for reform for the next decade. The brief recession following the Restoration was stymied by guaranteeing an Aquileian market for a certain quantity of cane sugar, while economic development was pursued with heavy reliance on industrial goods sourced from the mainland.\n\nWhile wages and living standards rose as the economy recovered and modernised, it would increasingly prove to be an unsustainable solution. Aquileian investment slowed down in the early 1000s, and recent reports suggest that the economy of Les Meridiennes would not survive without mainland assistance . Should a crisis disrupt the relationship between colony and home, there is no telling what the future will bring to the island paradise."

meridiennes_history.12.t:0 "A Brief History of the Summer Islands"
meridiennes_history.12.d:0 "In many ways, the Summer Islands are like estranged siblings to Les Meridiennes. Both sets of Canteribbean islands were settled around the same time by Equestrian settlers, enjoy similar flora and environment, and have developed their own ways of life. However, while the southern archipelagos attracted great attention from foreign explorers in the seventh century which culminated in their annexation by Saddle Arabia, the Summer Islands were left undisturbed, perhaps shielded by their closer physical proximity to Equestria or simple disinterest.\n\nRemaining part of the pony nation was a mixed blessing for the islands. While the Arabians invested in the economy and governance of their Canteribbean possessions, the Summer Islands were left to fend for themselves. The administration of the islands was heavily disputed between the officials in Puerto Caballo and Southpoint, and it was only in 790 that the conflict was solved when a permanent Equestrian governor was appointed to the islands and order was brought to the islands.\n\nTo make the islands profitable, sugar cane was introduced as a cash crop in the ninth century where it joined the mango plantations established earlier by batpony entrepreneurs from the South-East. Despite these investments, locals are far poorer on average than in Les Meridiennes due to the low demand for their products on Equestrian markets, a problem only exacerbated when the industrial revolution seemed to pass over the islands.\n\nIn recent years, the Summer Islands have been dominated by Tropic Haze, the first university-educated native. Upon her return in 1002, the earth pony began harassing the governor with relentless petitions and travelling across the islands teaching literacy classes, hoping to instil political consciousness in the locals.\n\nWith the recent union with Les Meridiennes, Tropic Haze is cautiously optimistic that the concerns of the Summer Islands will be better met under a government closer to home. However, her first priority remains the wellbeing of the locals, and should her new benefactors neglect her compatriots like Equestria once did, there will be hell to pay."

meridiennes_history.13.t:0 "A Brief History of Les Loyales"
meridiennes_history.13.d:0 "Beaches and corrals and not much lived on what Equestrian pioneers branded Last Point. Flora didn't thrive so much as it scraped off whatever it could. No wonder, then, that when hooves reached these pockets of land, only a hardy few stayed to build outposts and lighthouses to guide ships along. They would be sought after for their wildly diverse sea life but not much else.\n\nThe Saddle Arabians had a different idea, for one of their merchants' guilds made a discovery: if Les Loyales didn't need natural goods if they could process them instead. Rocky terrain couldn't grow food but they could support stores and workshops. Tiny cottage industries soon blossomed all over: Puerto Caballoan tobacco wrapped the Loyales way, luxurious fabrics dyed with rare algae, and fine seafood dining by masters of centuries-old recipes, to name only the famous exports. When the islands fell under Aquileian control, the griffon aristocracy visited them for a gentrified experience of "the foreign." Some of them stayed.\n\nBy the time of the revolution, the royal family in exile, believing that the Republic might attempt an invasion of the remaining loyalists, pressured local governors to construct dozens of fortresses and billets: anything to stop the Republicans from setting paw on the kingdom again. Such an invasion never came, leaving the forts to decay, but the victorious monarchy sought to reward the faithful should they choose to stay in Las Meridiennes. Their choice of islands—Les Loyales—was already home to the high life, so they would be given lavish manors with perfect seaside vistas.\n\nAs it stands, Les Loyales is the personification of a toast to the well landed in life. Nobles are rewarded with mansions and servants, tourists get to enjoy exquisite fish after a game of gold or tennis, and executives can attend conferences and land deals in only the most appropriate of places."

meridiennes_history.14.t:0 "A Brief History of Les Abondantes"
meridiennes_history.14.d:0 "The distant south-western islands were dubbed "The Lost Islands" by the ponies that discovered them and their staggering biodiversity. One island mimicked jungles found deep in the Equestrian south-east, while another boasted of ferns that towered over houses and pony-sized fruits, and a cay had magically grown corals on land. Mangos, guava, starfruits, papayas, and more helped to entice explorers to stake a claim here and live far from the Principality's reach.\n\nBut do-gooders weren't the only ones who loved the isolation. Pirates soon found The Lost Islands' position to be strategic. For centuries afterwards, pony privateers plundered merchant vessels and raided as far as Puerto Caballo, secure in the fact that their base of operations was in this semi-secret archipelago. Time would only amplify its reputation as a hovel for under-the-table business: Saddle Arabian dissidents, Sicameonese refugees, West Griffonian crime families, and international mercenaries—not to mention Les Meridiennes' own rejected folk that polite society dared not acknowledge—were welcome here. Aquileia, up to now, sends its more troublesome figures here as a backclawed reward: a tropical villa but all alone save for morally dubious neighbors. "Les Abandonés" they were soon called.\n\nPast this grimy image, though, a softer side reveals itself, for The Lost Islands' strange flora and fauna offered just as many opportunities for honest creatures to live well even in the face of foreign control. There still exists a clawful of villages who've had their ways of life untouched, fed by their lush environments, and the friendships the various settlements have here might be remnants of the Confederation.\n\nNowadays, Les Abondantes bubbles with activity no matter which way you go. A life of crime or of tranquility, of co-operation or isolation: far from outside interference, it will surely be abundant."

A copper-engraved scene played out in front of him, lit by the dim shine of three fragrant candles, of three gods in a triangular pattern, all of whom stood above a plethora of smaller gods. "Oh, Watraz," his whispers radiated through the air, "Holy Watraz, make our islands whole," he muttered with a bow and a tap on his forehead with his hoof before turning to the idol with a book in its talon, "Oh, Aitraz, Holy Aitraz, make our creatures whole." His eyes gazed up to the final god, the one that flew above all the others. Unlike the last prayers, he bent down to the floor and kept his eyes down. "Oh Yah, Holy Yah. Holy above all others. Be my guide, my rock, and..."\n\n"Make me whole," a soft voice emanated from behind, jolting the stallion up from his bent position. He nearly backed into his icons were it not for the light hold of a mare’s hoof around his foreleg. The stallion’s eyes adjusted to the darkness, finding a set of parallel, ebony stripes across a smiling, yet unknowable face. Warm eyes accompanied this pattern, yet they too were unreadable. The stallion rubbed his eyes with his free hoof before gasping. Mama Ruby stood before him. Healer, theologian, activist, and mother to all.\n\n"Easy, Cherry," she whispered as she released her grip from his foreleg, "Lest you step on your holy shrine." The stallion looked back to his icons, only a few centimeters away from his leg. "M-mama Ruby, please forgive me," he stuttered as he put distance between him and his shrine.\n\nThe zebra mare smiled and bent down to inspect his shrine. "I’m not the one to ask forgive for, but I do not believe the gods would look badly upon an honest mistake. Perhaps I should be the one to ask forgiveness for causing a close call."Cherry shook his head. "Don’t say such a thing, Mama Ruby! I’m sorry I didn’t hear your arrival." The zebra turned towards him and only responded with a smile to reciprocate his pleasantry. "You’re too kind, but I’ve come for more than just a simple chat."\n\nCherry nodded, and Mama Ruby, still smiling, blew the candles out."

Not that she didn’t enjoy it, of course, but every job needs a stretched break every now and then.\nA discordant pile of mail caught the corner of her eye, strewn across the visitor’s table at the center of her office. Intentional on Antoine’s part, no doubt. She walked around the sofa and sat down, looking over the battlefield of mail. Letters from family, bills, and an absurd number of advertisements – all the usual.\nThat was, except for one single letter, purple in color. Unlike the rest of the mail, this letter lay centered and straight, a few centimeters from the edge of the coffee table. The griffon tilted her head and outstretched her talon towards the enclosed envelope, and upon touching it, she caught a whiff of a familiar aroma. A sense of nostalgia filled her heart, and Genevieve snatched the letter up with renewed emotion.\n"Tarte."\nGenevieve gasped, staring at the envelope, a familiar indention upon its center. She pulled open the tab on the top and pulled out a paper with hand-written lettering.\n"Genevieve,\n"How are you doing? I hope this letter finds you well. How long has it been since we last talked? Ten years? I remember it was before you left for the mainland. Maybe even longer. I often wonder if it was because of something I did.\n"I don’t know how to put this any other way, but... well, I-"\n"Governess," a call came from the door. Genevieve put the letter down and looked up to find one of the newly hired secretaries. "We’re set for the weekly hearings in the meeting hall."\nThe governess nodded, then stared back at the letter. She wanted to keep reading, more than anything, but her job had other things to worry about right now. She walked around to her desk and plopped it into a free cabinet.\nAnd yet, she felt... excitement? Fear? She couldn’t ignore the alien sensation within her core. A smile unconsciously grew on her beak, and she thought about her response. There was so much to say in the years they hadn’t talked. She’d need more than a letter to say it all.\nBut that was for another day."

The horse released a big yawn, and he rolled out of his bed, touching his hooves upon the carpet of his bedroom. He stretched his left back leg as long as it could go while extending his right foreleg in a similar way. After a rub of his eyes, he pushed his mane out of his eyes and walked over to the set of icons at the end of his room.\nIt wasn’t the images of idols he looked at first, though, but the green grass-like substance he had wrapped in thin parchment last night. With a flick of a lighter next to it, the end of the paper burnt, and a familiar aroma encircled Barley’s nose. He stuck the unlit end into his mouth and let the fragrance sneak down his throat and into his lungs. The sensation would make anycreature cough, but to Barley, it was a welcoming itch. His mind awoke as the enhanced air filled every square centimeter of his chest, and once he felt the murkiness of sleep evaporate from his body, he released it in a breath of vapor.\n"Yah, Holy Yah, Holy above all others," he muttered as he gazed upon his icons with a renewed, heightened level of thought, "Be my guide, my rock, and make me whole. Oh Yah, I implore you to accept my prayer." He breathed in another puff from his roll and released it as he bent down to the gold, holy painting.\nThe horse leaned towards the window and looked out. A beautiful day, as Yah always brought to the islands. The streets were active like usual, with every kind of creature going about their day. Would it be hectic or would it be calm, Trot wondered? He smiled and breathed out vapor once more.\n"Yah," he spoke..."

She would be getting used to this soon, since this port town was going to be her new home for the foreseeable future. She moved out of the way as a troupe of dock workers moved some of her studio equipment. A well-dressed griffon met her as she was walking off the docks and started talking. “You are Mrs. Wilted Daisy, correct?” He asked, looking around at all the pack horses shifting crates and dodging gofers. “I’m the mayor of this town, and I would like to personally welcome you to Les Meridiennes. I, uh, didn’t realize you would be shipping so much stuff. Are you trying to move your entire studio in one trip?”\n     “Why ever not?” She replied politely. “And to what do I owe your introduction?”\n     “Yes, well, you’re the talk of the town, Mrs. Daisy.” He said jovially. “An entire animation studio on our sleepy little islands… most of us never would have imagined it. I’m glad that you saw the value in our competitive international pricing, and we look forwards to helping you on your next blockbuster.”\n     “Yes, yes.” Daisy answered. She reached the end of the docks and her hippogriff chauffer opened the door to a bomb-black car. In minutes, clouds had come in front of the sun and a few small drops of rain fell on her coat. “Well, I would like to continue this business talk, but…” She shrugged and fit herself into the backseat. As the car drove away, she sighed. She was surprised that it had taken this long for her to see a griffon on these islands and was happy to have an excuse to postpone further interactions. The mayor was so small-minded, she would dislike him especially." #Catnapper

He squeezed his tongue with his two large front teeth as he concentrated on pulling the rebel micro-stakes out of his hair. In regular Navet fashion, however, he fell into a cycle of poking his hooves, pushing the toothpicks deeper in the jungle atop Navet’s head before trying again.\n     "Sir!" Navet’s ears twitched at the sound of the familiar voice. To his side stood a saluting unicorn. Ragoût nodded. "Hello there, Extra," he spoke with his slow, warm voice.\n     "Letter for you, sir! From your father!" Extra spoke once more, dropping the letter on Navet’s desk with a shimmer of his horn. The commander nodded and turned to the parchment before opening it and clearing his throat. "Ragoût," Navet began.\n     "I hope this letter finds you fast before you make any more decisions with the flowins sent to you last week. I have heard that you gave away twenty-thousand flowins from the allowance you received a few weeks ago. While I am glad you care for your fellow creatures, I do wish you would be more careful with the money you receive. It is very important, and you can’t spend it on just anything without deeper thought. What I am saying is this: Think before you spend, because you’re receiving a lot of flowins. It’s not something anypony can find themselves with.\n     "Love, your father," Navet finished. He leaned back and tapped his chin with his hoof, ruminating on the words of his dad. Think before he spends... "Extra," he turned to his adjutant, "What is an important cause I should spend my flowins on?"\n     Adjutant Extra tapped his hoof on his chin. "Well, sir, we have some soldiers that could use some help. Topsy Turvy’s daughter needs new glasses, and Camille recently hurt her talon in an accident. Perhaps we could use those flowins to help them out?"\n     Navet smiled and nodded. "That’s a good idea, Extra. Could you do that for me?" The unicorn smiled back and gave a large salute."

The card fluttered to the floor softly, and the elderly bird across from him looked absolutely confused at the protest.\n“What, no jacks?” Oiseau Geriatrique questioned his voice an awkward mumble. “What kind of a poker game is this?” he complained with a soft wheeze. Vieux sighed, again, and surrendered the matter- and his hand. Glancing around the room, desperate for something else for his mind to focus on. While age had been fairly kind to him, and his mind was sharp as ever, his body felt downright fossilized on hot days- and today was certainly hot. “Let’s just play Crazy Eights…” Vieux suggested.\nAs the afternoon went on, the card table was joined by a trio of old veterans. They looked to Vieux expectantly as they played, and it was fairly obvious they were there for one thing, and that one thing was eventually spoken between a few careless hands.\n“So, how’s the boy…” Tristan Baracolle questioned coyly, as he glanced over his cards.\nVieux smiled, “Oh wonderful. I might just put some fire into his heart. Why, the way I hear it he’s become quite the guiding star for his men.”\nThe group snorted. Ragout’s assignment as an officer had always been comical- almost cartoonish. Going from fed with a silver spoon to leading was quite something, and they all remembered similar officers once.\n“That colt was called to a fire, trivial thing you know. So he bursts through the door trying to act brave and gets a lungfull of smoke. Stumbles backwards out of the door, trips on the firehose. So it’s spraying and spraying, a few of his men are trying to get a handle on it, and he grabs it trying to recover his honour. Ends up spraying the town mayor as they’re watching, half the constabulary, and damn near everything except the actual gods damned building.” \nVieux grinned, “He at least offered to pay for a new library.”\nOh how the group laughed, and Vieux relaxed back in place. His grandson’s life was going to be the greatest biography ever written once all was said and done, and he was delighted to be a part of it. Why, before Vieux had met him that whelp would have run from the fire. It was a step forward, at least, and Vieux was happy to keep pushing him forward. "

Today they were hitting the Bar Le Paradis near the city center of Port-Giselda, where the black-feathered griff hoped to scare some money out of the local businesses and tourists.\n\nBreezy suddenly entered the bar with Ragout following close behind. Before he could speak, Breezy covered his mouth with her hoof and snorted at Cyrille. "Alright, that's it from you all. This bar is under MPA's watch. You better leave if you value your feathers," Breezy not-so-subtly threatened.\n\nCyrille turned around to look at Breezy and laughed. He was a head taller than the mare with a thuggish, scarred face. "Sorry, miss. We'll leave something left over for you when we're done here," the griffon answered, flicking his spent cigarette ash right on Breezy's face. His three henchgriffs cackled around him.\n\nBreezy smiled darkly and locked the door behind her before trotting toward Cyrille. He was still laughing when the pegasus suddenly slammed his head down onto the counter, bloodying his face. "I warned you. Now you can't leave," Breezy taunted. Before his henchgriffs could react, Breezy's gang members left their seats to join the brawl.\n\nRagout was quick to dodge a few punches and thrown bottles his way and hide behind a table, only occasionally peeking out to see Breezy and her companions beating Cyrille and his lackeys with batons until they were almost unconscious. Once their bruised bodies were dragged out onto the road, Ragout shook his head. "We could have avoided violence. My own soldiers could have handled it," he objected.\n\n"We handled it more easily.

The moons light perfectly flowed into the room from outside, and the gentle ocean only meters from her window reflected that light back up beautifully. It was a beautiful night, and part of her deeply wanted to just go find someone comfortable to nest with.\nWork, however, called. Even on a warm day one could only procrastinate so much, and tomorrow she would have to make an effort to push things forward. Genevieve settled herself in, and ruffled her feathers to get comfortable before she lit a few candles for light.\nThe light of candles was a signal, one not quite agreed on but apparent all the same, for Antoine to make his entrance. He sniffed softly at the air, and sighed as the fragrant candles soothed whatever worries might be on his mind. Now was a time to relax, catch up, and then rest.\nGenevieve glanced back from her seat, and smiled as she met Antoine’s eyes. “There can’t be much to catch up with tonight, or I would have known about it already…"\nAntoine stepped closer, and reached out to gently pat Genevieve’s head. “Not a thing to worry about beyond the trivial. Just a mild scandal, one of the customs officers has been taking bribes for who knows how long. Kind of an embarrassment, but I’m sure people will forget by the time the morning editions are out.”\nAntoine provided a small folder. “Name’s in here, details of the case too. He’s probably going to spend a good five years cleaning up beaches.”\nGenevieve giggled, “Oh we live in such a paradise even that hardly sounds like a punishment. Maybe we should send him to Olenia…”\nTaking a few minutes to briefly study the report, Genevieve was somewhat amused at the whole affair. Why anybody would even bother with such corruption when they lived in such a paradise was beyond her. Regardless, she filed it away for reference all the same.\nFinally satisfied she was caught up, Genevieve leaned out to blow the candles out. She sighed softly, and leaned back in her chair to gaze at the moon. Not too much to catch up on tonight, but the future was coming, and like an ocean storm it could always surprise them."

"I agree that our reforms ought to run deep, but we must limit our scope, else we'll risk causing utter chaos."\n\nTemperada couldn't get out a word before Yarah's gentle nod silenced her. "He is right. I would hate for our actions to make things worse than they were just because we attempted to do everything at once."\n\n"With all due respect," said Shine Light.

We are talking about the fate of an entire country."\n\nTemperada sighed. "Well, where should we start? Do you guys have any ideas? I presume my ideas will be 'too rash' again."

"We're wondering what we would do if we could magically shape the country to our vision. Instead, we should try to figure out how we would go about it. It would make our options and limitations clear, and steer us away from day-dreaming idealism and towards topics actually worth discussing."\n\n"Well," Temperada piped up, stars in her eyes. "There's this Facilier character who, as far as I've heard, shares our beliefs and is pretty influential."\n\n"I've talked to him," said Yarah with a smile. "He seems like a solid bet."\n\n"I don't trust him," Trema muttered, "I don't trust any foreign influence, and I will certainly not make an exception for him..."\n\nShine Light nodded, but didn't bother adding anything. Meanwhile, Temperada opened her beak, but quickly averted her gaze to stare at the table instead. Yarah shot Trema a glare, which he met with an apologetic half-smile."

meridiennes.1.d:0 ""...and so, I firmly propose that we must no longer rely on Aquileian imports and instead diversify our own economy," the unicorn merchant concluded. He took a deep breath, pushed his glasses up with his left hoof, and gazed at the administration council before him.\nAt one look, he wondered if he had entered the wrong building. The dozen or so appointed nobles, sitting behind pristine wooden podiums, almost all had their heads supported by their claws. A few opened their beaks in a collective yawn. One even slept like a rock, his forehead placed firmly on top of his desk. The pony pondered how much of his proposal they had listened to.\n"Thank you," a voice spoke from the center. Below the 5-meter portrait of King Moriset, and in a podium raised above the rest of nobles, sat a griffon with dark blue hair. In juxtaposition to her court, her attentive eyes shifted between making eye contact with the merchant and looking down to her papers. Her left talon scribbled upon her desk with great care and precision.\nSo this was Geneviève Volière? The merchant had never seen a creature with such focus.\n"No, thank you, Lady Geneviève," he responded with a small bow of his head.\nGeneviève nodded to her citizen and looked to the crowd behind him. Ponies, horses, and griffons of various backgrounds sat in rows of chairs, all the way down to the entrance of the court. An accurate representation of the islands the King had appointed her to govern. And for King Moriset, she would do everything she could.\nThe governess put her pen down and opened her beak. "We have a few more groups to hear from as we conclude today’s hearings on our economic reform. I understand we all have different views on how we should remodel our economy, but I am pleased that we all agree on the necessity of change. We are bound to a united cause, and I hope this will be a precedent for the future of Les Meridiennes.

Forms and requests from local governors sat neatly in the left-hand corner of her desk. Next to that stack were the petitions from citizens that had the required signatures to warrant an examination. A third stack, dedicated to the weekly reports of her ministry heads. And a fourth for miscellaneous writings related to her position.\nHer talon moved with speed and grace, and her eyes darted back and forth through the requests from her subjects. Her whole attention onto her job removed the office from her peripherals. Her bookcases disappeared. Her guest couches were gone. All was lost to the void surrounding her.\n"Lost in work again?" a voice shook Geneviève’s world.

And here I find you, like usual, engulfed in a well-organized cesspool of work."\nGeneviève rubbed her brow. "What is it, Antoine?"\n"You have guests from the KPEy, the PPH, and even the MPA all here to lend their support to your reform plan – that is, if they don’t kill one another in the waiting room beforehand."\nThe governess leaned back and dropped her pen. "Can you tell if they’re hear for more than just providing support?"\nHer secretary shrugged. "It’s hard to tell. Regardless, letting them voice their public support would be helpful.

For days, countless creatures of countless camps spoke before court in hopes of having their personal ideas of reformation understood. Some would take only a few minutes, while others would speak for hours. For anycreature other than the governess, it was a test of patience, with the bleak hope that their speech would not be taken for granted.\nAnd it was finally over. Geneviève dropped her pen and leaned up from her chair.\n"My citizens, I cannot thank you enough for the words and viewpoints you have provided to me throughout these hearings. I am blessed to have been chosen to govern these islands. Greater to me than its beauty or economy are the creatures that inhabit it. You are all vital parts of Les Meridiennes, and I believe that together we can make it through this recession.\n"Having heard your opinions on the matter, I believe that we have developed a reform plan suitable for everycreature on the isles. There is still the matter of civilian infrastructure to deal with, but I have under my claws a written-out plan forged by your aid. With my stamp, we will begin its execution and save our Meridiennes. For both king and country."\nGeneviève raised her stamp and pushed it down against her completed form. At first, the silence persisted. But slowly, one set of hoofs began clapping in the back. Two more horses followed, and eventually, the whole room applauded with sincerity.

Indeed, though it was the primary university of Les Meridiennes, calling the place run-down would be a compliment. Black ooze, unidentifiable by eye, covered the walls of the buildings. Wood and broken glass filled the void of where a significant number of windows should be. A water-pipe jutted out from the ground to the two’s side, where a water fountain once was.\nAntoine gagged as some grotesque stench invade his nostrils. "Do you want us to get infected by some new illness before you listen to my advice? Or perhaps cut our appendages on some broken glass? Though the latter hasn’t happened, I fear that the former may have already occurred," he complained before mustering a false cough.\nGeneviève sighed, her eyes still focused forward. "This university once was the shining jewel of education in the Canteribbean before a hurricane landed twenty years ago. Since then, we’ve yet to renovate it."\n"And why was that?" the pegasus asked.\n"We simply let our citizens study on the mainland," the governess answered. "We willingly neglected the school."\n"Then why change the status quo now? Why not... provide a scholarship to study in the mainland or something?"\nGeneviève stopped, prompting her secretary to freeze in his tracks. "It has contributed to our economic problems, yes, but more than that is the damage to our pride. Les Meridiennes deserves more. We’ve- No, I’ve made a mistake by ignoring this," she spoke.\nAntoine looked over his solemn governess' shoulder and tilted his head. She still kept her eyes turned away from Antoine. He shriveled his brow, then after a few moments, leaned back and sighed. "My governess, you hold yourself far too accountable. After all, those fools you call your court prove their uselessness by not approaching the subject. Nor did your minister of education discover the issue."\n"I too ignored it," Geneviève replied.\nWhy did the governess always put the blame onto herself? Antoine rubbed his temples with his hoof, then cleared his throat. "Alright, governess, you’ve convinced me. I'll help save this university. On one condition..."\nThe governess merely nodded to hear the rest.\n"You take a break once this is all done.""

A family of griffons played together just across the path that his seat stood on, the father grabbing his toddler hatchling and raising her high in the air. A pony couple walked side by side down the path, their heart-filled eyes embracing the depths of each other’s souls. An elderly zebra and a horse played chess in the refreshment area just down the walkway, their faces downcast towards the table where a battle of wits took place.\nSalade breathed in the nice sea air and spoke. "It’s a beautiful day, isn’t it?"\n"A little sunny, but perfect otherwise," a feminine voice responded. The pegasus turned his head to find a familiar zebra leaning against a tree. She had a permanent smile plastered across her face that was warm yet shallow. Behind those eyes, however, was an enigma that none of his spies could unmask.\n"Mama Ruby," he said with a smile, "Glad you could make it."\n     The zebra walked past Salade and sat next to him on the bench. "I’m always willing to talk, Salade."\nHe laughed. "Then perhaps you could tell me about Facilier?"\nNo muscle moved on Ruby’s face. She kept her smile, but Salade continued to sense something hiding behind it. "Come now, Salade. I don’t question the kind of company you’re with."\n"Oh, I’m only joking, Ruby. Truthfully, though I am skeptical of your relationship with Facilier, I respect your work. Many of my own help you. Not just the spies, I mean. They simply appreciate the work you do for our islands," Salade responded.\nThe zebra nodded. "Well, I cannot say the same of your espionage, but I know you care for Les Meridiennes. So then, what have you called me to discuss?"\n"We both agree and wish to aid the governess in her reforms, correct? Then it would be best that we try to work together and figure out where we help her. After all, two heads – and wallets – are better than one," Salade said with a wave of his hoof.\nRuby crossed her hooves together.

"Like you said, I care for Les Meridiennes."\nThe zebra nodded. "As do I.""

meridiennes.6.d:0 ""It’s about time," Acalan muttered to himself as he spotted a brown dot appear on the water below. The foal grabbed a vine with one hoof, walked a few steps back, and took a running start towards the edge. With the swing of the vine, Acalan launched himself off the cliff and into the open sky.\nHe adored the touch of the wind moving across his fur. The adrenaline pumping through his veins. He let out a loud yell of excitement as he flew further and further away from the rocks. His body stabilized itself and aimed him towards the ground, seeing the clear water come closer to him.\nBut before he even fell half the length of the cliff, a blur shot past him and he felt two warm talons snatch his forearms.\n"Acalan! How many times do I need to tell you not to do that?" a familiar voice spoke from above. Acalan looked up to see a griffon with orange feathers gasping for breath.\n“Sorry, Ms. Louisa,” he replied. His teacher lowered him slowly to sea level where a large boat floated, though to call it a boat was a stretch. It looked as if somecreature from Aquileia took a schoolhouse and placed it on a raft just a few meters larger than itself.\nMs. Louisa placed her student on the edge of the floating school and landed. She sighed. "That was really dangerous, you know?"\nThe foal tilted his head. "But there’s water!"\nThe griffon shook her head. "It may be fine a few meters above the water, but the higher you jump from a cliff, the more the water will hurt you. From that height, it wouldn’t be pretty, and your parents wouldn’t like it. Your village may even stop sending you and the other kids here."\n"Oh," Acalan said as he absorbed the information.\nMs. Louisa patted her student on his head. "You like this school, don’t you?"\nThe earth foal nodded his head vigorously. "I like it a lot!"\n"Then promise me you won’t do that again, okay?"\n"Yes, ma’am!"  the foal replied. He put his hoof into his teacher’s talon, to the surprise of Ms. Louisa. She smiled, however, and led her little student in. While she had initially been unhappy being sent to Les Loyales with a new school, nothing could replace the relationship she had gained with her students."

meridiennes.7.d:0 ""Thank you all for being here at the grand re-opening of the University of Port Giselda. It has been a long month, but the work our friends at the Stable Structures Reconstruction Company have done is more than anyone could ask for. What was once a crippled university riddled with damage has once again become a jewel of our island.\n"What this reconstruction symbolizes is not just education, but a reminder in the pride we should have. Not just the pride we should have as Aquileian citizens, but the regional pride we should have as Meridienners. It is with that great pride that we continue to educate ourselves, build our businesses, and serve the King at our best. Thank you all."\nA round of applause and cheers erupted before Genevieve. She nodded at her citizens and walked back to her chair at the back side of the stage as the university’s chancellor took the mic back and waited for the clapping to end.\n"So?" Antoine asked. He sat just right of Genevieve, with a portable pony-friendly typewriter on his lap.\n"So what?" Genevieve asked back.\nAntoine hooves moved around the typewriter as the chancellor began his speech. "Remember that promise you made? About taking a break?"\nGenevieve looked down and reached into her thoughts until she found the promise he had mentioned. She scowled and whispered, "I don’t recall it being so much as a promise as it was a condition."\nAntoine stopped typing and frowned. "Please don’t find a way to break the promise, governess. Try as I might, I fear I could not take your place if you were to die of overwork."\n"I won’t- Ack, fine!" Genevieve snapped with a wave of her talon. Though she still muttered the words, it was loud enough for her to garner the attention of those on the stage. Even the chancellor looked back. Before he saw anything, however, the governess flipped back to normal, her eternal straight face covering up her outburst.\nAntoine, however, was beaming."

Though Geneviève didn't hear it through the glass, the edges of her beak curled up, and soon she started laughing out into the night.\n\nThe door to the balcony opened. "What... what's so funny?" asked Antoine.\n\n"I don't—" Geneviève took a deep breath. "I don't know. Must have been the stress leaving my body."\n\nHe chuckled. "Can't blame you. The past few weeks have been rather... hectic."\n\n"You're telling me." Geneviève rolled her eyes, but couldn't keep herself from smiling. "But let's change the topic; the less I think about government duties tonight, the better." Antoine nodded. "How's the family?"\n\n"Great! Henriette thinks she might be pregnant again! Hasn't seen a physician yet, but she's pretty sure. Part of me hopes she's imagining it." Another chuckle. "Don't get me wrong, I love Marie and Gustave, but I don't know if I can handle another one." Geneviève shared his laugh. "Anyway, what about you?" She blinked at him. "Well, when are you going to settle down?"\n\n"Oh please." She dismissed him with a wave of her talons. "As if I had the time for that. Besides, even if—" Her eyes focused on something, or rather someone inside. "What is she doing here?" A moment before the pink-haired diamond dog turned towards the balcony, Geneviève forced a smile. "CeauxCeaux. It's... quite the surprise to find you here."\n\n"Of course! When I heard the numbers were out, I just had to come congratulate you, ma chère!" CeauxCeaux wore a huge, almost strained smile. "Always knew you could do it."\n\n"Well, thank you," said Geneviève. "Did you need anything?"\n\nCeauxCeaux gasped, placing a paw on her chest. "No, no, I would never." She shook her head. "I merely came to catch up with an old friend, discuss gossip around a good glass of wine." At Geneviève's arched brow, she gave a nonchalant wave of her paw. "Fine, fine, I may also have wanted to ask a good, old friend for an insignificant, tiny, minuscule little favour."\n\nGeneviève would have let out a deep sigh, had she not fully expected this. Instead, she kept her tone as polite as possible. "Well, I apologise, but, I'm afraid I'm not available tonight, Miss Laroche."\n\nCeauxCeaux scoffed, turned, and left."

meridiennes.9.t:0 "A Letter to the King"
meridiennes.9.d:0 ""...and that concludes my report, Your Majesty," Genevieve mimicked her written words before she dotted the final period on her letter. She tapped her chin with her pen and looked through her words once more. Contained in her letter was a detailed list of each part of her reform. Months of work all summarized into a couple of paragraphs. A feat few could muster, especially when royalty is involved.\nShe looked up to a massive portrait of King Moriset hanging above the entrance to her office. His brown feathers came to life in the paint upon the canvas. Each stroke, each pass of the brush - it all served to portray His Majesty as he was. His portraits were common in the governor's building, but this one was special to her: It was given to her by the King himself. Not some reproduction of an old painting, but a new portrait in which King Moriset had to pose for hours. He sat on his throne, but had a warm smile not worn by royalty. A smile that filled Genevieve with the strength to push herself on her worst days.\nBy some miracle, she was in his good graces, but that only heightened his expectations of her. Everything she did had to be perfect. Even what she ate or how she acted had to be just right, for being His Majesty's representative meant that any negative view of her was a negative view of the King.\nShe could not make a mistake. She went through her letter a second time, ensuring it had proper grammar and content. After that was complete, she nodded to herself, then got up off her chair. However, a paper ball crumbled under her back paw, almost causing her to yelp. What was that?\nGenevieve looked back at her paws to find dozens of rough drafts balled up and thrown around her chair. How many letters had she written in the last few hours?\nThe griffon shook her head then walked to her office door. She'd take care of that later. For now, she had a letter to send to the king."
meridiennes.9.a:0 "For the King!"

meridiennes.10.t:0 "The King's Response"
meridiennes.10.d:0 ""My wonderful subject,\n"I thank you for your work over this past year. It has been evident that your dedication to the crown has been a large factor in the success of your work. You have provided exemplary aid to the Kingdom, and strengthened the resolve of the creatures that inhabit Les Meridiennes. Once more, our islands have become a jewel of Aquileia.\n"Attached to this package is a gift from my own collection, expensive as it is rare. I am looking forward to your next project.\n"Sincerely, Your Majesty, King Moriset."\nGenevieve dropped the letter and looked at the silver spoon inside of a glass case. The engravings in the handle must have been all hand-welded. The patterns, sets of metal tendrils that wrapped around one another and united into a single entity, had a level of detail that the governess had never seen on silverware such as this. Even a few small gemstones rested in visually pleasing positions on the handle.\nDid the King specifically pick this out for her? How long did it take for him to choose this? Such a magnificent object, gifted from the King’s own collection.\nThe governess smiled and squeezed her talons together. She couldn’t have asked for a better reward from King Moriset himself. Genevieve jumped off her chair and took the glass-enclosed spoon in one talon, then walked to the central bookcase in her office.\nGenevieve Voliere was not one for showing off. In fact, she had always despised such an action. But, to receive such a gift from the King himself, what else could she do? She placed the silver spoon at eye-level and took a few steps back.\nAll the other knick-knacks she had received didn’t matter. Gifts, awards, prizes – they were all ridiculous things she had stumbled into. This spoon, however? It was a testament. Proof that it was her actions, not her position, that provided better lives for her citizens. For her king.\nAnd nothing could slow her down."

meridiennes_two.1.t:0 "A Letter from Les Meridiennes"
meridiennes_two.1.d:0 ""Your Majesty, a letter has arrived from the islands," King Moriset’s attendant announced with a courteous bow.\nThe King looked down from his throne and raised his eyebrow. A teacup sat on the arm rest, with a silver spoon and a saucer to complement it. "Oh, yes, it is that time of year, is it not? A letter from... Gianna? Garnet?"\n"Genevieve is her name, Your Majesty."\nKing Moriset nodded. "Ah, yes, Genevieve. Alright, you may bring it over here."\nThe attendant stood from his bow and walked up a set of steps to where the throne resided. Once he reached the top, he bent his legs down once more and raised his talons hold the letter to the king. King Moriset snatched the parchment and waved the attendant away. With a third, small bow, the servicegriffon stepped off the stairs and towards the door of the throne room.\nThe king punctured the top of the letter with his claw and pulled out the letter that had, unfortunately, not been spared of his letter-opening skills. Nevertheless, he opened the paper and began reading:\n"Your Majesty, may you be ever healthy in this time. I come to you with a report upon the successful economic reform of Les Meridiennes. In previous years, our island has lacked the growth and fervor that it once had before the unfortunate actions of the republican rebels. We had left this alone initially, but the signs were apparent: This could lead to a full economic collapse of the islands if not handled. Thus, our creatures took the steps necessary to save our economy, and in only a few months, the predictions for Les Meridiennes’ fate have been avoided. Listed are the steps taken..."\nKing Moriset smiled and leaned back in his chair. All was well, wasn’t it? His ministry was foolish to convince him otherwise.\n"Attendant," he spoke as he raised his talon.\nTo the right of the throne, an attendant arrived, seemingly out of nowhere. "Yes, Your Majesty?"\nHe handed the letter. "Take this and send a reply to Governess… Giena of Les Meridiennes. Let her know my pleasure in her work. Oh, and uh," the King looked around before grabbing the spoon from his tea set beside him, "Send her this as a gift. I have more anyways.""

He’d need to go and have more retrieved... but that could wait for the morning. For now he’d sit here and brood over his well–laid plans, completely undone by a revolution far from these islands. To say Facilier was in a sour mood would be a drastic understatement, him spewing curses in many languages under his breath in the silence of his office. He glares angrily at the collection of maps and invoices skewed across his desk, each painting a picture of failure. His failure.\n \nOne could be forgiven for thinking him melancholic, with his public persona giving statements about these unfortunate losses and asking for protection from up high. To him, those are not the focus of his clouded mind. Instead his muddled attention is buried in reports and notes that have slowly made their way to his office, informants and allies making him aware that there will be no capitalizing on this occasion for him, that they cannot follow through. His plan is over. To him it seems as if he is at his lowest, his deepest dreams crushed- but were they really?\n \nJust because the political situation has not necessarily developed to his advantage doesn’t mean his efforts are all for naught; he’ll just have to reorganize, replan, build a new schedule. He still has his resources and support, all he has to do is reshuffle his deck. A moment of clarity breaks through his drunken haze. He hasn’t failed, he has just been delayed.\n \nThere's only one thing truly outside of his hooves, now. One resource that can’t be bought or stolen, one that can only be prayed for..."

Much of what she had in there is smashed, destroyed beyond a reasonable doubt. But there is an order to it, a very thought-out tantrum, one which has seemingly only spared that which still relates to Aquileia itself as an idea, like her flag or the bust of Queen Giselda next to her desk. A desk the mare now lay heaped upon, sobs racking her body as she laments 'you idiot, you damnable fool' in equal parts directed at Moriset and herself. As she lay there facedown in her own tears, she contemplates what is left for her to actually be fighting for, wondering why she left the statue and the flag intact at all. Raising her gaze to look towards them, she instead spots something peering out of the middle of a partially-fallen stack of mail on the corner of her desk. A rather simple envelope bearing the Governess' seal. At the sight of Genevieve's reply, she gasps! She HAD written back after all! Tearing it open and reading the letter, the exact contents of which will remain secret until I come up with something good for when it gets brought up later, she's suddenly returned to a far more calm mood.

meridiennes_m_rev.1.t:0 "Panic in the Courthouse"
meridiennes_m_rev.1.d:0 "The heaviest air Genevieve ever felt rested in the courthouse. What was once her domain felt as unfamiliar as a new land to an explorer. Only, it shouldn’t be as such. It was uncanny, as if there was an invisible beast staring at Genevieve from the corner of the room, just out of her peripherals. She turned her neck, only to find an empty corner, but the sensation remained. That fear remained.\nGenevieve rubbed her damp palms together and looked back at the crowd. The usual groups came. Merchants, shopkeepers, farmers, elites… they were all here. None looked at one another, just directly at the governess. What was it they were here for again? Why did they stare at her?\nOh yes, the meeting. She looked down at her papers and cleared her throat. "I understand what we’re all here for. I don’t think there’s a single creature on these islands that haven’t heard of the rebellion on the mainland. And so, we must come to a consensus on how we as a dominion should help our kingdom. So, without further ado, let us begin this meeting."\nAt first, the silence persisted. Each and every creature in the room looked around at one another, unsure how to speak their mind about the encroaching revolution. But one horse near the front raised her hoof. "I-I don’t think we should pull ourselves into the war. We have too much to lose."\nGenevieve nodded and wrote out her words on her paper, as she always did. And perhaps that was what she needed to feel normal once more: Returning to normality. She would just do what she always did.\nThen a scoff came out from the front.\n"Coward. You would ignore our kingdom for yourself?"\nThe governess shot her neck up to find a griffon with glasses a couple rows in front of the horse.\nThe horse huffed. "What I’m doing is protecting my family!"\n"Well, wait until the revolution comes here, and see how your family will be then."\n"Don’t talk to her like-"\n"Hey, shut it!"\nDozens of voices spoke out at once. The governess gasped as her citizens fought one another, screaming into each other’s faces as if this were a pub. She looked at the nobility next to her, who all kept silent as always. She tried to speak up, but no creature could hear her.\nShe leaned back, waiting for it all to end, but the arguments persisted. And the fear remained."

After that first failure of a court, Genevieve managed to ring everyone back to sanity and discuss their ideas rather than yell them. Not that it was easy. Every comment, every speech, she could see somecreature ready to leap off their chair in attack. She could barely keep the lid on things, and it was getting tougher each meeting.\n"And like usual, you have your beak stuck in piles of papers," a familiar voice said. Genevieve shot her head up to find the same bat pony she’d known her whole life.\n"Tarte," Genevieve, “It’s been a while."\nThe pony smiled. "Same to you. It’s been almost a decade since we’ve talked, hasn’t it?"\nGenevieve leaned up from her chair and was about to give an excuse, but Tarte raised her hoof to stop her. "Don’t worry," the bat pony said, "I know you’ve been busy."\nThe governess leaned back and sighed. "It wasn’t just that."\nThe two sat in silence for a moment, only looking into each other’s eyes. In Tarte’s soul, Genevieve could sense a rainbow of emotions that mirrored her own. A fractal of thoughts and opinions that would take a book to explain. The two were connected in one way – and so very distant in so many others.\nTarte cleared her throat. "As you can guess from last meeting, the MPA and most of the bleeding-heart nobles have joined sides, Trot Barley included. We believe the only way Les Meridiennes can go is to join in on the battle in the mainland."\nGenevieve nodded and looked down at her papers. "Our admin is leaning towards a more moderate approach, as is Mama Ruby and her followers. We just don’t have the creaturepower to spare."\nThe bat pony chuckled, perhaps in subtle disbelief, and looked away. "I get it. Honestly, I do."\nThe two went silent again, and nothing but the air of tension and the slight echo from outside Genevieve's door accompanied them.\nThe griffon started up. "I-I read your-"\n"I think it's best I leave," Tarte interrupted. "I-it was good to see you again, Genevieve. Honestly."\nThe bat pony turned away and walked towards the door, leaving Genevieve to wallow in the aftereffects of a shotty reunion. The griffon reached her talon out, and words filled up in her throat, but once Tarte opened the door and exited through the threshold, what she wanted to say subsided into regret. Genevieve dropped her claw down and sighed."

"I’m glad to see you’re taking this side, but why come to me? Can’t you just stamp a paper and call it done?"\nThe goveness shook her head and sighed. "Legally I can, but our islands have always been stable because of whatever democracy I can afford. If I were to force our islands to remain inactive, yet the majority wanted to join the war, it would bring far more harm than joining the mainland in the fight."\n"Indeed," a new voice spoke. Or rather a voice that had always been there but had yet to speak. "It’s important to encourage unity in this time of distress."\nThe chancellor nearly jumped out of his chair. He had yet to notice the middle-aged zebra sitting in the chair next to Genevieve’s.\nAfter catching his breath, he opened his beak. "I’m sorry, and you are?"\n"Ruby," the zebra said as she outstretched her hoof out.\nThe professor extended his talon and shook her hoof before he nodded in remembrance. "Ah, yes, a pleasure to meet you."\n"The pleasure's all mine," Mama Ruby said with a warm smile. Genevieve couldn’t help but feel anxious at her gaze, though. It was unreadable. Unknowable. Like there was something greater behind those eyes than anyone could know.\n"She reached out to me and backed our faction. So, could you aid our faction?"\nThe elderly griffon shot his eyes back to Genevieve as he let go of Mama Ruby’s hoof. "Oh, of course! Anything you want, governess.""

The ships came in this morning, bearing cargo of weapons and proving that the communiques were not some sort of joke. Overseas guns and cannons are now finding their way to the claws and hooves of our fighters across the front.\n\nThis is not a terribly large amount of support for a nation as industrialized and large as ours, especially once it's split between us and the other loyalist regions, but it is far more than nothing, and for the small islands it must be a tremendous burden upon their military industry. After this rebellion is dealth with and the traitors are dead or exiled, we will have to look into some method of repaying the small island nation for their spirited assistance."

The Archon is so old that he remembers the youthful years of your mother. A child Grover the Sixth may be, but a stiff wind could defeat that walking antique." He took a moment to catch his breath from the hot sun. "Oh, and we have an audience now." He continued, pointing to a group of four or so Zebra mares in army uniforms and Les Meridiennes patches who were watching.\n\n"By blue, this war has brought out the strangest folks." Jean replied before being directed to the next box. He wrapped his claws around it, but it didn't budge when he tried to lift it. After a moment of thought, he took off his military shirt and set it aside, revealing a dark tank top underneath.\n\nA chorus of cheers and whistles rose from the Zebras. It only rose in intensity as he strained to pick up the large crate and pitch it up so that his companion could pull it onto the bed. When he could finally take his claws off of it without fear of it falling off, one of the Zebras called out "Meet us out back and we'll show you how to lift, little boy!", causing the others to cheer and holler. It was especially odd since they seemed to be shorter than he was.\n\nJean felt vaguely uncomfortable, but when he looked to Leclerc for help, the latter just muttered "lucky bastard" under his breath. Normally, looking good in a uniform was one of the perks of military life, but this was not how Jean had expected it to go."

Joining the ships carrying vital war materials and trade goods to our docks are now colonial vessels bearing more soldiers for the front, and those who have been sent into battle are currently proving themselves equal to our normal fighters, although they often have strange customs.\n\nSadly, the amount of fighters sent has been split between us and all of the other loyalists, and the colony is not a large or populous nation to begin with, so the overal effect for us is small. Still, this is a clear show of support and loyalty from the colony, and one which should not go unrewarded after our victory."

"More news from the mainland, Governess."\n\nAQUILA SECURE MORISET IS SAFE FOR NOW STOP MME VOLIÈRE YOU ARE ORDERED MAKE PREPARATIONS TO ASSIST IN COUNTER-ATTACK STOP BOREAS SAVE THE KING\n\nSome were lengthy, detailed missives, and some, like this one, were brief and direct updates. "Could you close the door on your way out?" she asked, not looking up. Antoine, devoid of any of his usual quirks, obeyed, muffling the sound of panicked voices in the corridor outside.\n\nGeneviève tried to straighten out the telegrams, but they woud not obey. The breeze from the window slowly sent them fluttering off of her desk like pigeons. So she took a deep breath, and focused instead on straightening her thoughts. She had to be strong, for her king, for the citizens. The Governess must govern, now more than ever.

Now, many are awaiting trial and probable early release for poor health on charges of violating new anti-extremism laws put in place to make it harder for ultranationalists and other obnoxious groups to have undue sway over our politics.\n\nThere have been complaints about this. Numerous politicians of Aquileia have sent us a message on the subject which, in short, reads "We could hear their bones creaking when we sent them over. They couldn't possibly have been that much trouble." Another prominent critic was an MPA high-roller of many years, who gave a beautiful off-the-cuff treatise on the tyranny of the PPH to a few dozen of his supporters from the rocking chair on his front porch and then fell asleep. A few within our own party have also raised concerns about this unsubtle approach, but some time spent talking to arrestees convinced them that no harm was being done to our political sphere.\n\nThe effect is already clear. Bored youth are no longer able to spend lazy afternoons hearing the old folks ranting about some nonsense, and the few extremists who are young enough to use a gun well have gotten the message that they should tone done their rhetoric or else risk arrest."

One day this tyrannical oligarchy would be revealed to all, then he could have his revolution.\n\nIn his blinding anger, he suddenly bumped into a MPA delegate in front of him who had voted in favor. The word "prick" was muttered, followed by a venemous glare from the old stallion, but Beauxregard was not in a position to get into a fight.

MER_POLITICS_OEUF_DESC:0 "#TODO"
MER_POLITICS_FACILIER_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! April 14th, 978\n\n§YBiography:§! Born the son of a fishmonger and a shipyard worker, life was not set to be easy for young Facilier. With little wealth to his family name, the young colt often turned his attention outward: to the sea, and whatever laid beyond. Noveau Aquila was a bustling port at the time, and Facilier's attention was often fixated on the stories the sailors brought with them. More crucially, they often spoke of the harsh working conditions faced by those who made their living on the seas. In an effort to put the stories of these unsung heroes to paper, Facilier would leave home and seek out likeminded individuals, travelling far and wide with little but his few belongings. \n\nFor all his effort, the stories he sought would lead him to the young Socialist Republic of Stalliongrad, where he would decide to embark upon an ideological safari to other regions in and around Equestria harboring communist sympathies. However, after spending much time within Coltjun revolutionary circles in Baltimare, he would instead leave for Les Meridiennes, influenced by his heritage and confident in his ability to bring about a revolution with ease. \n\nWith little more than his meagre possessions and no connections in the area, Facilier would eventually meet up with Mama Ruby, working his way through the ranks and building the PKM up to be the true party of the people. With the end of Vivienne's brief rule on the isles, they now seek to transform the former colony into an independent state with its own bright future."

### Subideology Descriptions ###
MER_centrism_desc:0 "#TODO colonial administration, primarily made of certain elites and those appointed within the "court" of Genevieve. At the start of the game, it's paradoxically also the closest thing to a functioning political party"

MER_marxism_desc:0 "#TODO parishes and nearby areas that have fallen under their political control. Some of these areas include the dockyards and industrial centers of certain port cities"

MER_economic_reform_hearings:0 "Economic Revitalization Hearings"
MER_economic_reform_hearings_desc:0 "Be it Saddle Arabian nobles or Aquileian royalty, Equestrian visitors or zebra wanderers, everycreature has fondly spoken of our little islands and their natural beauty. Very few would say, however, that the Meridiennes are economically viable. Something must be done to reverse this trend, to give our home a niche of its own."
MER_reduce_economic_reliance:0 "Pursue Economic Autonomy"
MER_reduce_economic_reliance_desc:0 "Production of goods and material is sparse and underdeveloped: most is made to satisfy the local needs, while anything luxurious is imported from the Aquileian mainland and our other trading partners. While we cannot expect the Meridiennes to entirely self sufficient, improving the quality of products and expanding existing factories would go a long way towards reversing the downward trend."
MER_develop_second_port:0 "Develop Cocoyer"
MER_develop_second_port_desc:0 "Port Giselda is where all the rustic splendour of the Meridiennes can be fully appreciated. Our culture, our historical landmarks, the bustling docks full of goods and creatures from around the world! However, it is unwise to put all of our eggs in one basket, as the pony expression goes. Promoting the development of Cocoyer would encourage immigration towards the lesser appreciated southern islands."
MER_diversify_exports:0 "Diversify Our Exports"
MER_diversify_exports_desc:0 "What little is shipped abroad can be summed up in two items: rubber and exotic fruit, sold for a pittance. We simply cannot compete with larger and more established nations, who not only export more, but better quality goods too. The first step towards breaking this mold is the expansion of an iron deposit in Cocoyer. It can be refined into steel, a decently valued commodity."
MER_fight_stagnation:0 "Prevent A Recession"
MER_fight_stagnation_desc:0 "The economic situation is slowly becoming untenable. With less and less labour available for locals, there is a growing number of creatures that is able to work, but there is simply no room for them. Idle thoughts lead to either emigration or dangerous sentiments. It cannot be fixed over a day, but large scale (for our size) public projects should temporarily alleviate the problem."
MER_harmonist_solution:0 "The Progressive Method"
MER_harmonist_solution_desc:0 "What connects the few settlements on our islands is mostly dirt trails, with a few cobblestone roads dating to ages past. The automobile has yet to make a large breakthrough, mostly seen as a strange frivolity from the mainland. But the march of progress cannot be avoided, and the civil engineers affilated with PKM and PPH have presented a plan that would correct our lack of infrastructure."
MER_traditionalist_solution:0 "The Traditionalists' Argument"
MER_traditionalist_solution_desc:0 "What connects the few settlements on our islands is mostly dirt trails, with a few cobblestone roads dating to ages past. The local cream of the crop wishes to see development similar to the norm of great cities like Vyzima, Aquila or Pelis. To achieve that, certain ideas like labour laws or fair payment should be put aside in the pursuit of progress."
MER_education_reforms:0 "Renovate the University"
MER_education_reforms_desc:0 "The University of Port Giselda, established over a century ago, has never been particularly notable in the quality of its lessons, or the amount of options available for enterprising students. As innovation comes from our best and brightest, we should invest in this institution, bring over more teachers from the mainland. Surely, the expansion of the intellectual group should be one of our priorities."
MER_negotiate_subsidies:0 "Subsidise Key Industries"
MER_negotiate_subsidies_desc:0 "The Meridiennes' economic activity is divided between the fishing sector, rubber plantation owners, small scale tourist attractions and the meagre local production. None of them can be called reasonably successful, barely managing to stay afloat for various reasons. State intervention could and should lead to an economic growth, increasing our revenue and job opportunities for locals."
MER_encourage_intellectuals:0 "Encourage Higher Learning"
MER_encourage_intellectuals_desc:0 "According to recent census results, we've found that only a small minority of our population actively pursues intellectual careers. The stereotype of an islander interested in scarcely more than having a leisurely time could not be stronger, apparently. This minority only accounts for around 1% of our population. Increasing this percetage to 4 would be optimal, and we have ideas how to achieve that."
MER_stable_growth:0 "Stable Growth Achieved"
MER_stable_growth_desc:0 "Fair winds are blowing on our fair isles in recent times. Although the Meridiennes are far from achieving any sort of prosperity, a potential crisis has been averted, and it should be smooth sailing from now on. Perhaps, once the mainlanders hear about our recent improvements, they'll approve a higher budget for the colony?"
MER_letter_to_moriset:0 "Correspondence With The King"
MER_letter_to_moriset_desc:0 "It is the biannual occasion in which [MER.GetLeader] writes an official report to our Aquileian masters. More often than not, it consists mostly of droll tax reports and unsubtle demands for further funding, which would go relatively unnoticed. But for once, we have some actual good news to present to the King, and there's surely a reward waiting for us loyal subjects."

## Revolution (JER is monarchist) ##
MER_the_second_revolution_monarchy:0 "Aquileia In Flames"
MER_the_second_revolution_monarchy_desc:0 "Disaster! Horror! Outrage! Once again, the Ancien Regime is under threat as the revolting Republicans have risen up to reimpose their radical ideology on the mainland. Even if our islands are far from the troubles, the cracks will quickly start to form, should we hesitate. We must convene at once and quickly decide on the next course of action, before the situation grows out of control!"

MER_balance_shifts_moderate:0 "Balanced Priorities"
MER_balance_shifts_moderate_desc:0 "#TODO For as much as we are beholden to our overlord, our Governess is naturally torn between her home (and by extension her people) in the isles as well as the crown to whom she swears fealty. While refusing to aid the mainland would be both out of the question and suicidal, perhaps we can do so in a manner that won't break the bank and disgruntle the populace as much"

MER_elevate_voices_of_reason:0 "Elevate the Voices of Reason"
MER_elevate_voices_of_reason_desc:0 "#TODO while we naturally expected a lot of resistance to our attempts at avoiding the economic and social impacts of an official state of war with the republicans, the sources of both praise and discontent are not as ideologically clear-cut as we had once expected. Via some careful backroom deals and political maneuvering, we'll attempt to find those outside of our usual circles to promote our ideals for us"

MER_raise_regional_militias:0 "Raise Rural Militias"
MER_raise_regional_militias_desc:0 "#TODO officializing some regional territorial militias should free up some of our professional troops for actions elsewhere. This is certain to please the Méridionalist wing of the MPA, whose regionalist rhetoric has long advocated for such formations to be integrated into the colonial army proper." 

MER_negotiate_with_warhawks:0 "#TODO Negotiate with Hawks"
MER_negotiate_with_warhawks_desc:0 "#TODO in order to return the economy to a more manageable state throughout and following this crisis, we will seek to implement sustainable practices to strike a balance between domestic and foreign needs. yadda yadda, the focus will basically involve making use of pacifist harmonists and isolationist nationalists to try to promote an inward focus."

MER_dig_in:0 "Dig In and Pray"
MER_dig_in_desc:0 "#TODO We dont't really know WHAT to expect. You can never be too careful, especially in a position as vulnerable as ours, far away from the protection of our currently preoccupied liege. We will reinforce our cities by restoring age-old defenses and bolstering them with new ones. What's more, we should be able to spin this as military involvement and get the interventionists off our backs"

MER_buff_ourselves:0 "The Babineaux Plan"
MER_buff_ourselves_desc:0 "#TODO we will strive to distinguish ourselves on the battlefield, demonstrating our capacity for independent military initiatives. rather than adopting the aquileian doctrine of defense, we shall play to our own strengths and strike the enemy where they are weak"

MER_buff_aquileia:0 "Bring NCOs Out of Retirement"
MER_buff_aquileia_desc:0 "#TODO we have lots of retired NCO types just sitting about not doing anything. let's send em over to lend a helping hand."

MER_detrimental_enthusiasm:0 "Detrimental Enthusiasm"
MER_detrimental_enthusiasm_desc:0 "#TODO an event about an idiot appointee making the mistake of directing military production directly towards Aquileia in exchange for some equipment"

MER_patriotic_speech:0 "#TODO patriotic speech"
MER_patriotic_speech_desc:0 "#TODO The Governess' speech will probably scripted to vary based on sub-path"

MER_balance_shifts_radical:0 "Take Action"
MER_balance_shifts_radical_desc:0 "As far as we are from the mainland, we cannot just simply lay idly on our laurels while good Aquileians are fighting for what's right. The isles have always been devoted subjects of the Crown, and within each of our hearts (those harbouring dissident thoughts will be prosecuted) is an earnest desire to prove ourselves. We must take a stand, for the King and proud Aquileia!"

MER_send_help:0 "The First Wave"
MER_send_help_desc:0 "#TODO it will take some time to fully shift ourselves to a war-ready state, but in the meantime, lets send some manpower!"

MER_arms_shipments:0 "Send Weapon Shipments"
MER_arms_shipments_desc:0 "The Meridiennes maintain a miniscule arms industry, intended completely for local purposes of keeping order. We have not seen battles in quite a while, and as a result, a considerable stockpile of admittedly dated firearms has grown over the past years. Instead of rusting in armouries, we should send everything we can spare to our friends at the mainland. Every little bit helps, and we must prove ourselves."

MER_deepen_involvement:0 "Deepen Involvement"
MER_deepen_involvement_desc:0 "#TODO if we wish to see victory against those who would threaten the status quo, we must be ready to commit ourselves fully to the defense of our brothers at home. "

MER_send_actual_volunteers:0 "Send Volunteers"
MER_send_actual_volunteers_desc:0 "The blood of the patriots calls to action! Many creatures have demanded recently to be sent to battle, and their number has grown to a worrying amount. If we do not approve their requests, they could very well incite riots with their behaviour. Thus it is settled: anycreature willing to die for King and Aquileia will be given passage to the mainland, with enough gear to sustain themselves in combat."

MER_join_the_fray:0 "Join the Fray"
MER_join_the_fray_desc:0 "#TODO The mainland is devored by the fire of war. It is our duty to directly intervene to help the Crown!"

MER_wait_it_out:0 "With Bated Breaths, We Watched"
MER_wait_it_out_desc:0 ""We've done all that we could, distant as we are, leaving us only to wait and listen for any news from the mainland. Information will take days to arrive, but I will pray for the King's success in combating these filthy insurgents. Aquileia has the Discrets; she needs no 'president' or 'republic'.""

### Loyalist Focus Tree ###
###########################

MER_steady_as_she_goes:0 "Steady As She Goes"
MER_steady_as_she_goes_desc:0 "As expected, the filthy Republican rabble has been crushed and prevented from restoring their most ignoble ideals. The populace is content knowing that further insecurities will not plague our fair islands, but much work remains to be done in the service for the Crown."

################
### Military ###
################

MER_reform_colonial_military:0 "Reform the Colonial Military"
MER_reform_colonial_military_desc:0 "For many years, the islands of Meridiennes have maintained what could be quaintly called, an informal militia. There was never a need for any sort of military development, owing to the protection from the mainland. But now we live in troubled times, where certainties are breaking down. With the surplus raised from the economical reform, we can invest into restructuring our armed forces."
MER_fighter_research:0 "Beginnings of an Airforce"
MER_fighter_research_desc:0 "Although far from large landmasses, the position of our islands has a certain benefit, according to some radical thinkers. As airplanes are becoming more and more prominent in conflicts, they could be utilised to effectively protect our home. What good is the greatest fleet in the world, if it can't reach its destination? We must look into acquiring this knowledge for our benefit."
MER_prioritize_range:0 "Prioritize Long-Range Air Operations"
MER_prioritize_range_desc:0 "The imported airplanes have proven their worth, and the pilots have successfully completed various trial runs. However, the range of these machines is insufficient for any sort of wider operations, that aren't confined to our homelands. Our future designs will have to made in mind to minimise this drawback: grant them a further reach, cut down on the unnecessary excess."
MER_torpedo_bomber_primacy:0 "Torpedo Bomber Primacy"
MER_torpedo_bomber_primacy_desc:0 "It would seem that the wind is blowing in an unfavourable direction for warships these days, not many can successfully resist an aerial attack without support from their own aviation. With that in mind, we've drawn up plans for our first aircraft specialised in striking targets rather than opposing planes - a long range bomber dedicated for naval assaults."
MER_air_doctrine_research:0 "Belle-Île School of Aerial Warfare"
MER_air_doctrine_research_desc:0 "As with any new innovation, the usage of airplanes must be put to a certain standard. To elaborate, it means that they should operate in a combined arms styled approach with the other branches of our armed forces, as well as determining a specialisation of our aerial doctrine. Plans might quickly fall apart, but good planning will carry us a long way."
MER_bomber_research:0 "Bomber Advancements"
MER_bomber_research_desc:0 "The naval bomber project has given satisfying results, and with the lessons learned, we can redesign the chassis to fit a more localised approach for bombing missions. Even though currently the only thing in strike range are remote islands with practice targets for our new pilots, perhaps someday the mainland will require our aid, and the colonial airforce shall be ready to respond."
MER_arms_industry:0 "Jumpstart Our Arms Industry"
MER_arms_industry_desc:0 "If there is anything that's always missing, it would be firearms and supplies. With the planned expansion of the colonial forces, current production is unsatisfying and would not be able to keep up with the demand, especially if a conflict arises. The local economy will be bolstered with the expansion of our factories and workshops, all in service to the good crown of Aquileia."
MER_modernize_infantry_equipment:0 "Infantry Kit Innovations"
MER_modernize_infantry_equipment_desc:0 "Rifle and ammunition, certainly the most basic things any soldier needs. As war becomes ever more deadly, there is an even greater need to stay ahead of our rivals: more accurate weaponry, additional tools for the field and removing obsolete equipment from our armouries. The armed forces will certainly take greater pride in their service, if they possess the best we can give."
MER_CAS_research:0 "Dive Bomber Modernisation"
MER_CAS_research_desc:0 "Bombing is certainly effective in causing untold amounts of devastation, but certain situations require more finesse and restraint. It would do us little good if an aerial strike on the battlefield ends up causing friendly fire, which is why there is a need for a specialised aircraft that can remove such a risk, while remaining effective in achieving objectives."
MER_pridean_officers:0 "Hire Pridean Generals"
MER_pridean_officers_desc:0 "Us proud patriots are not lacking in enthusiasm when it comes to serving the Aquileian crown, but we cannot do everything on our own. The remoteness of these isles means there are few who can call themselves veterans or innovators in military matters, thus arises a need to acquire the services of such individuals from the mainland. Quality cooperation is sure to follow."
MER_infantry_equipment_standardization:0 "Standardise Infantry Equipment Designs"
MER_infantry_equipment_standardization_desc:0 "Centuries of industrial progress has taught the world a simple fact: uniformity in the parts of any machine means that it can be assembled easily. By making identical parts within a fine tolerance, identical machines can be built from any mixture of those parts. Particularly useful for the military, cutting down on repair costs for almost any equipment."
MER_marine_capabilities:0 "Elite Hippogriff Marines"
MER_marine_capabilities_desc:0 "Out of many races that dot this world, the hippogriffs are rightfully considered to be more adept when it comes to handling water. Given our position, amphibious assaults are certainly going to be required at some point, thus it pays to be prepared for the possibility. The colonial marines shall be a point of pride for the nation, whatever race they may be."
MER_artillery_modernization:0 "Revamped Ordinance Designs"
MER_artillery_modernization_desc:0 "Artillery has been a mainstay of any ground force ever since its inception, and the primary way to counter an opposing force is with our own. Numbers, however, aren't the solution for everything. Efficiency is the key, such as improved training for artillery crews, advanced percussion shells, or even hydraulic recoil mechanisms that greatly improve accuracy."
MER_support_companies:0 "Support Company Proliferation"
MER_support_companies_desc:0 "Combat has evolved a long time ago from the heroics of a single warrior, it is now a dedicated team effort. Each works on their own in achieving their objective, but as a part of a whole, larger operation. To this end, support companies are required: soldiers to handle bridge building, supply transport, taking care of the wounded, and more. Without support, even the greatest force will fail."
MER_naval_industry_expansion:0 "Expand Our Naval Industry"
MER_naval_industry_expansion_desc:0 "The Meridiennes have always had a plentitude of dockyards, ports, wharves, fisheries and other aspects of naval production, but recent developments have led us to assume that the current industry is insufficient for building more advanced vessels. The locals will bemoan the devastation of shores and beaches, but this is more important than aesthetics."
MER_submarine_advancements:0 "Wolfpack Advancements"
MER_submarine_advancements_desc:0 "It would be foolhardy to assume we could build even one battleship or similar warship in time for a conflict, not to mention it would probably become obsolete on completion. Thus it seems natural to specialise in submarines, to harry and waylay merchant convoys, and other undefended ships. More importantly, they can be assembled far quicker, making losses manageable."
MER_invasion_transports:0 "Improved Transport Designs"
MER_invasion_transports_desc:0 "Warships can be temporarily given the order to transport soldiers, but their cramped space makes difficult to move a large quantity, or across a longer time period. What is needed are dedicated vessels for the job, alongside landing barges that will assist in assaulting coasts and shores."
MER_moar_dockyard_expansion:0 "Shipyard Work Quotas"
MER_moar_dockyard_expansion_desc:0 "Although the naval industry has substantionally grown in recent times, production still remains at unsatisfying levels. We have little choice but to push directives for increasing productivity, first through promises of rewards, later by enforcing punishments should deadlines be ignored. All for the good of the nation, of course."
MER_destroyer_advancements:0 "Anti-Submarine Efforts"
MER_destroyer_advancements_desc:0 "The island nation relies heavily on imports from around the globe, lest crucial materials run into a shortage when it is most needed. To patrol the coasts of Meridiennes, and report on any suspicious activities from would-be raiders, destroyers are needed to fulfil that role. Cheap, adaptable and quick, much roles can be satisfied with their presence."
MER_cruiser_advancements:0 "Workhorse Theorem"
MER_cruiser_advancements_desc:0 "Owing to our restricted naval industry, the largest warships that can be feasibly built belong to the cruiser class. Sturdy and armed to withstand devastating battles, yet quick enough to act as an escort for more vulnerable vessels. It is certain that the locals will be awed, once the first is launched from the shipyards."
MER_doctrine_of_support:0 "Small Contribution, Large Impact"
MER_doctrine_of_support_desc:0 "We have never claimed to be on the same level as any province on the mainland, but our dedicated support shall not go unnoticed in Aquila. By setting aside resources and equipment for our overlord, we shall prove ourselves worthy of the Crown's favour, while maintaining a certain level of autonomy for ourselves."

MER_a_meeting_with_the_queen_desc:0 "It is a new dawn in Aquileia, just as it can be here. As good subjects of the Crown, we shall request some of the new Queen's time in order to hear her plans for our bright future."

### Nationalists Path ###
MER_choose_MPA:0 "Favour The Méridionalists"
MER_choose_MPA_desc:0 "#TODO rewrite - Unlike those bleeding hearts in the PPH, only the most loyal members of the Queen's Party should help to lead her proposed reforms to the administration. We can ill-afford indecision or treason, and thus the only candidates are those who love our fair nation above all else."
MER_sideline_PPH:0 "#TODO Reassure 'Insert Frenchy Name for Liberal Nobles'"
MER_sideline_PPH_desc:0 "#TODO we will reassure the lib nobles that they can still be doing their charity, since we have our own secret ways we intend to utilize them."

MER_MPA_auxiliaries_idea_desc:0 "The next generation will also need leaders and soldiers, and so we shall form a youth's scouting group to let our children learn the skills to navigate our island nation - and learn on their own to appreciate its beauty. In addition, the fostered feelings of camaraderie will serve them in the future, once they become politically active."
MER_obligatory_ponypower_injection:0 "Bring in Foreign Fighters"
MER_obligatory_ponypower_injection_desc:0 "#TODO"
MER_genevieve_code:0 "The Volière Directives"
MER_genevieve_code_desc:0 "#TODO Geneviève intends to take the nation in a more nationalistic direction, but is not too big on it personally. So who better to help her than Tarte, with hom she engages in one-on-one debates as she struggles to balance pragmatic nationalism and aggressive foreign policy with her more moderate domestic ideals."
MER_ensure_industrialist_support:0 "Ensure Future Industrialist Support"
MER_ensure_industrialist_support_desc:0 "#TODO the industrialists have proven that they value profits above all. While they're broadly harmonist-leaning by nature, the allure of future income can easily ensure compliance."
MER_sway_ruralists:0 "Sway Harmonic Ruralists"
MER_sway_ruralists_desc:0 "#TODO For how much the Méridionalists try to project the image of a broad movement transcending demographics and region, their influence in areas outside of Belle-Île is often contested by Barley's harmonists. "

MER_reshuffle_rural_administrators_desc:0 "#TODO why try and sway the rural populace when we can just slowly replace a bunch of local leaders with more 'suitable' candidates."
MER_token_reforms:0 "Token Reforms"
MER_token_reforms_desc:0 "#TODO while they're ultimately not the most suitable people to determine the wider course of our future nation, Geneviève is rather sympathetic to the libtard nobility and even Trot Barley to an extent. We can't do everything we imagine they'd like, but we can certainly do what we can."
MER_MPA_position_secured:0 "The MPA Triumphant"
MER_MPA_position_secured_desc:0 "The true and righteous way of Aquileia and her Queen has proven its worth yet again on our fair shores, and now we may do as we need to in order to secure prosperity for the future. Under a distant yet firm hand, the kinds under our banner can each fulfil their role in the years to come in their own way."

### Harmonists Path ###
MER_choose_PPH:0 "Favour the Harmonists"
MER_choose_PPH_desc:0 "Counter to what the nationalists within the MPA might have us believe, the abandonment of our traditional methods of governance need not be a permanent affair. While [FROM.GetLeader] seems to be very receptive towards the idea of reinstating and further developing our system of rule once all is said and done, that is not enough to win her over fully. If she is to go through with it, she will need to be swayed..."
MER_welfare_programs:0 "Edict of Universal Medicine"
MER_welfare_programs_desc:0 "We have many things in great numbers. Gentle beaches, favourable winds, exotic animals, and tropical diseases number among them. A national system of hospitals and community-level medicine distribution can greatly lessen the dangers of the latter two. Should the situation occur, these institutions could be rapidly converted to serve the armed forces, prioritising healthcare to our gallant soldiers."
MER_gilded_turtles_PPH:0 "Bolster Monarchist Support"
MER_gilded_turtles_PPH_desc:0 "Our goal is not at all the abolition of the monarchy or the expansion of the democracy. It is merely a kinder sustainable governance. With some honest dialogue and maybe a few favours, at least a few of the more liberal-minded members among them can be made to see things our way."
MER_sideline_MPA:0 "Sideline la Geriatrie"
MER_sideline_MPA_desc:0 "The MPA is, for the most part, too invested in the exact nature of the monarchic institution for the good of itself, to say nothing of the nation as a whole. Luckily, we came prepared, and there are ways to keep them at a distance from the part of the state where things happen."
MER_curtail_noble_excesses:0 "Curtail Noble Excesses"
MER_curtail_noble_excesses_desc:0 "#TODO the lib nobles can be quite generous, but we've really gotta have a talk with them about not overdoing it with the grandiose displays. Geneviève will try and discuss the matter with one of her noble gal pals."

### Colonial Economy ###
########################
MER_continue_the_reforms:0 "Finish The Reforms"
MER_continue_the_reforms_desc:0 "The colonial administration has done an excellent job preventing the islands from falling into an economic slump, much like the majority of Griffonia in recent times. There are a few token improvements left to carry out to maintain a stable growth, so let's not rest and call it a done deal just yet."
MER_civ_industry:0 "Expand Domestic Industrial Sectors"
MER_civ_industry_desc:0 "The simple basics of any economic thought: growth and profit pave the way for further growth and profit. As the populace is slowly gaining wealthier, they're buying more products, giving producers a return on their investment and more. A further development in our industries for the production of everything a creature might need in their daily life is in order."
MER_more_development_projects:0 "Additional Development Projects"
MER_more_development_projects_desc:0 "There are many deals, designs, enterprises or plans the government can pursue, but as always, there are not enough funds or resources for everything. Establishing a formal procedure for economic proposals, which the colonial administration can then review and decide on its viability should ensure that only the most serious motions reach the end."
MER_society_development_modernized:0 "Le Parc Industriel De Port Giselda"
MER_society_development_modernized_desc:0 "Centralisation and consolidation of industry can only serve towards increasing efficiency and productivity. Port Giselda is already home to a majority of the Meridiennes' economic activity, but there is always room for additional improvement. Setting aside an area dedicated for industrialisation, away from urban centres, shall further our endeavours."
MER_expand_giselda_university:0 "Expand Campus Grounds"
MER_expand_giselda_university_desc:0 "With the recent expansion of the Port Giselda University, interest has raised to a degree where we simply cannot accomodate any more students near the area! It would seem that good news travel far, and while we certainly won't end up in an Equestrian newspaper detailing on best education facilities, we can still increase the budget for our brighter future."
MER_electronics_research:0 "Electronical Ingenuity"
MER_electronics_research_desc:0 "The guiding trend for technology these days is that it is growing ever more efficient, yet compact and smaller. Such is the case especially in the field of electronics, where a claw sized contraption can guide the actions of a machine that is far larger in size. Further development in this area could lead to a breakthrough in emerging fields of science."
MER_fuel_industry:0 "The Les Abondantes Fuel Refinery"
MER_fuel_industry_desc:0 "An island chain like ours needs fuel to avoid becoming isolated from the wider world, as transportation grinds to a halt because there's simply none of it left. Although oil remains at somewhat affordable prices for the time being, it will certainly increase as demand picks up globally, and we should establish a certain amount of self-sufficiency in this regard."
MER_summer_islands_purchase:0 "Purchase The Summer Islands"
MER_summer_islands_purchase_desc:0 "To the northwest lie the Summer Islands, named such for their particular charm during the warm season. Although they've never been officially a part of the Meridiennes, they are culturally similar enough to us, not to mention less than three day's distance by ship. Surely, their owners would be interested in an mutually amicable exchange?"
MER_more_domestic_companies:0 "Further Investments In Domestic Industry"
MER_more_domestic_companies_desc:0 "Business is booming, as the saying goes, but not everycreature is destined to achieve success in their ventures. The government can mitigate these failures to some degree, by offering subsidies, publish advice regarding corporation laws, provide efficient advertising and more. We simply expect a small return on our investments, however."
MER_invite_aquileian_companies:0 "Invite More Mainland Companies"
MER_invite_aquileian_companies_desc:0 "There are few things corporations enjoy, but one of them are low operation costs. We cannot do everything on our own, local businesses cannot satisfy the needs of the state. Thus, by offering mainland companies several benefits in exchange for opening a branch on the isles, we can gain their expertise and knowledge for little investment."
MER_resource_prospects:0 "Resource Prospects"
MER_resource_prospects_desc:0 "The Meridiennes can't be called large islands by any means, but much of the interior remains both sparsely populated and explored in terms of resource exploitation. This was primarily because of the expenses involved, but now that technology has reduced these costs to an appreciable degree, we can attempt to find out if anything valuable lies beneath the ground."
MER_machine_tools_research:0 "Industrial R&D Grants"
MER_machine_tools_research_desc:0 "Problems require a solution, and that's where innovation shines brightest, especially when enticed with a generous reward. If we were to collect and list the most common woes the industrial sector is facing, those with the drive and ideas to offer improvements will certainly follow suit."
MER_eradicate_poverty:0 "Eradicate Poverty"
MER_eradicate_poverty_desc:0 "Despite our efforts, there are still a few places where the standard of living is unacceptably low. Idleness and lack of money drive creatures to undesirable thoughts, after all. By hiring unemployed locals to do government-sponsored light infrastructure projects, paid for by taxing the businesses which later arrive to take advantage of it, we can solve even that."
MER_improved_inter_island_shipping:0 "Improved Inter-Island Shipping Routes"
MER_improved_inter_island_shipping_desc:0 "As development increases, so does the need to transport resources and creatures between our islands, and even beyond them. However, the civilian transportation sector is not what could be called efficient by any means, both in scheduling and the quality of their vessels. Alleviating these hindrances should help tremendously for the local economy."
MER_tourism_industry:0 "Makings Of A Tourist Economy"
MER_tourism_industry_desc:0 "With most of the local problems solved or in the process of such, we can now turn our sights to exploiting the islands' most appealing quality. Namely, the development of a sector based around attracting creatures from around the world to come here and spend their money! It can certainly be more profitable than any traditional industry we might establish here."
MER_hemp_industry:0 "Develop Industrial-Grade Hemp"
MER_hemp_industry_desc:0 ""Whatever your misgivings about this 'weed' are, there are no doubts that it is quite practical. Paper, food, textiles, or even personal enjoyment, I've heard, hemp can be utilised far more effectively than just letting it rot!"\n\n- Trot Barley, Minister of Agriculture"
MER_plantations:0 "Subsidise the Plantations"
MER_plantations_desc:0 "From crops to rubber, the island plantations provide a great deal of resources that can be further refined in the production process. They haven't quite kept up with the times, with many reporting very low profit margins or worse. To prevent a source of labour from going under, we shall give a little push to ensure they stay competitive in this day and age, for the good of the state."
MER_pleasure_colony:0 "The Crown Jewel"
MER_pleasure_colony_desc:0 "We've been through turbulent times, and we've invested a great deal of effort, but the Meridiennes of today can hardly be compared to those from a decade ago. Modern infrastructure, industry and education have been successfully laid down, and now we reap the benefits of our success. Whoever decides to visit our little corner of the world, will leave greatly impressed."

MER_standardized_gun_designs:0 "The [MER.GetAdjective] Standard"
MER_standardized_gun_designs_desc:0 "To reduce the reliance on foreign imports, which are often of dubious, varying quality, we've gathered the attention of local gunsmiths and arsenals. A standardised rifle has been designed and placed into immediate production. It is unlikely to win any awards for reliability or performance, but it is good enough for our requirements."
MER_dockyard_industry_expansion:0 "Efficient Shipyards"
MER_dockyard_industry_expansion_desc:0 "For too long, the naval industry has been beset with a chronic failure of adherence to deadlines, to say the least about the uninspired workforce and corrupt management. Improving the production process by decentralising the construction of parts, combined with quotas that promise a substantial reward if they're fulfilled, should be a step in the right direction."
MER_MPA_auxiliaries:0 "MPA Youth Auxiliaries"
MER_MPA_auxiliaries_desc:0 ""What the hell are you doing all the way out here? Lost, huh? I swear, they ought to teach map-reading in schools. Ranger? No, not yet, I'm just a Royal Scout. Come on, I know where we are, the path's this way...""
MER_defanging_communism:0 "Appropriating Communist Views"
MER_defanging_communism_desc:0 "Socialist ideas have always been a scourge for any well behaving citizen, inciting subversive and disobedient thoughts. However, it would be rather unpopular to arrest the leadership of the PKM, which is why we've settled for an alternative approach: picking apart their ideology to take what we were going to implement anyway, quietly discard the rest. The true citizen will not listen to tall tales of revolution and class struggle if they're sufficiently content with what we provide."
# MER_welfare_programs:0 "Edict of Universal Medicine"

MER_hemp_industry_idea:0 "Thriving Hemp Industry"
MER_hemp_industry_idea_desc:0 "Hemp fabric is a material with a number of positive effects, and the legal control of the material makes it exotic. There has also been an uptick in self-reported happiness in areas where the plantations are, although for reasons we do not currently understand, and so has an unhealthy lifestyle of lounging about and eating junk food."
MER_beginnings_of_a_tourist_economy:0 "Beginnings of a Tourist Economy"
MER_beginnings_of_a_tourist_economy_desc:0 "It is obvious that the Meridiennes will never be as prosperous and developed like some of the major cities dotting the continental coastlines, but there is a certain advantage to our underdeveloped nature. Many a creature enjoys the sight of clear skies and shining seas, far from the worries of their everyday life. Thus, tourism is a gamble with low investment, high returns - sufficiently impressing the newcomers with what we can offer will spread the good word further, giving us an lucrative mean of income."

The taxation from the income our many hotels and resorts are bringing in allow us to further develop the isles, particularly in cultural exhibitions which strengthen our national identity.

MER_soup_defaux:0 "Soup Defaux"
MER_soup_defaux_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 970\n\n§YBiography:§! In the time of the first Aquileian Counterrevolution, Albert Berthelot and his Monarchists drew in every able-bodied creature they could to fight and die for the Discret Restoration, and of all those who went from worthlessness to importance through their role in the conflict, few have given as much as Soup Defaux.\nBorn to a low-class Pridean family, Defaux joined the navy as a deck-swabber on the nation’s flagship. By all accounts, he did this just fine, yet on a terrible day in 985, when the city of Pridea burned and Defaux was only 15, he caught the eye of Dennis “The Menace” Discret. The captain noticed the sailor, barely more than a child, and stuffed him into the closet housing a casemate cannon with orders to keep loading shells until told otherwise. And Defaux did this, first for an hour, then three, then six, until Pridea was rubble.\nSupposedly, he was scorched black when he was allowed out, and it may not have only been on the outside. He was very different when he came out, and the loss of his parents in the destruction only made it worse. Regardless, having been noticed by Dennis, he was able to become a career officer and begin climbing through the ranks. He ended the war as a Junior Lieutenant and stayed in the navy.\nThen, a few years later, he beat one Lieutenant Smoke, a fellow officer, to death in a dispute. It was found that he was unable to pass a psychological evaluation. For his years of faithful service, Dennis interceded in his life one last time and managed to get him promoted to Admiral – at the cost of being sent to Les Meridiennes for the rest of his life, likely to never see any combat or adventure ever again.\nIt was fine by him. Being a sailor was never his dream. But sometimes, the cannons are all firing at full speed, and explosions sound off a distant coast, and the tension seems to fade from his muscles. \n§YPortrait by:§! §GRyanBoi§!"

Though the region of Cloudbury proper should be easy enough to pick off, the difficulty arises in the areas immediately surrounding it. If we are to wrap this campaign up quickly, we must be ready to face the harsh terrains ahead."
MER_securing_south:0 "#TODO"
MER_securing_south_desc:0 "The newest campaign is against the nations of Griffonia's south. In this, we have a unique opportunity, since it would not at all be hard for us to send our navy and our world-class marines to open up a second front. It doesn't have to take the entire country, just demand enough of their attention that the main army can win."

MER_securing_east:0 "#TODO"
MER_securing_east_desc:0 "The former Griffonian Empire's eastern reaches were an odd place. Their terrain was largely plains and forests, with just enough mountains and rivers to make for some odd boundaries. The armies there are not particularly strong, but their lands are vast and easily defended in spite of that. The corollary: we can often just run right past them, and should plan for it."

meridiennes_history.1.t:0 "Tropical Genesis"
meridiennes_history.1.d:0 "The Canteribbean is named for its islands, but it is its people that define the region and make its history. Yet, remarkably little is known about the region before the arrival of foreign explorers, as much of the history is confined to unreliable oral traditions or was lost to time. Still, at least some facts can be discerned.\n\nThe islands that make up the modern colony of Les Meridiennes were settled quite late in terms of world history, being too small, uninviting, or just too unknown to attract serious attention. Arriving long after Equestria began to be widely populated, the first permanent inhabitants of the islands were members of the three pony tribes. These pioneers were part of the tail-end of a wave of settlers that populated Puerto Caballo and the Summer Islands among other islands. According to legends, they were made aware of the scattered islands only by following patterns of migratory birds. In the first century ALB, the inhabitants were joined by a smaller number of batponies who were fleeing from the outburst of prejudice in mainland Equus that followed the banishment of Princess Luna. Isolated from developments on the mainland, the ponies of the Canteribbean welcomed them with a cosmopolitan warmness that would become a key feature of their cultural identity.\n\nThe land itself was found to be similarly generous. The plentiful cassava became a staple food, supplemented by maize, while an abundance of fruit was cultivated in orchard-gardens and supplied by freshwater mountain streams. To organise their living in this environment, a system of Cacicazgos, or small chiefdoms, developed among the ponies. Despite the potential for conflict between villages over the centuries, friendship and cooperation seemed to prevail."

meridiennes_history.2.t:0 "The Confederation"
meridiennes_history.2.d:0 "The islands’ idyll could only last as long as the outside world did not take note. But in the seventh century ALB, that is exactly what happened. Explorers from across the world swarmed to the Canteribbean, driven by a desire to claim for their patrons the islands’ natural bounty. The natives extended their iconic warm welcome to these strangers, sometimes even to their own detriment, but as explorers built permanent structures and expanded their influence, attitudes began to change.\n\nThe year 650, just after Coltlumbus established New Mareland, saw the apex of this disorganised rush. Equestrian magistrates made claims on the islands by appealing to the locals’ alleged loyalty. In this, they were bitterly disputed by Sicameonese merchants who built trading posts in the eastern archipelago, and by Saddle Arabian merchants and Hippogriffian expeditionaries who established themselves in the south. The competition between these outside forces disrupted the islanders’ lives and often pitted Cacicazgos under foreign influence against each other, almost to the point of violence.\n\nHorrified at these developments, three of the largest remaining independent Cacicazgos began to cooperate to resist external influence. They were the Maneua of modern-day Belle-Île, the northern Xarhoof, and the Hayuey in the south.  From 665, the three chiefdoms defied alluring promises from outsiders until in early 670 they founded the Caciazgo, or the Confederation of the Isle.\n\nTo commemorate their new-found unity, an impressive ceremonial plaza was built in Maneua territory, in the centre of what would much later become Port-Giselda. Despite outward confidence, prolonged backroom disputes over the plaza’s location and construction cast a foreboding shadow on whether the loose confederation was truly capable of uniting the islanders like it was intended."

meridiennes_history.3.t:0 "Paradise Lost"
meridiennes_history.3.d:0 "Despite the creation of the native Caciazgo (Confederation) in 670, the next two decades would see foreign influence reach a victorious crescendo. Over the 670s, the Hippogriffs abandoned their efforts to consolidate the Trots and Canters Islands, while the Sicameonese merchants were driven to bankruptcy as their ships were harassed by renewed dragon piracy over the Mareiana Trench. This left the Equestrians and Saddle Arabians as the only major contenders for influence in the region.\n\nThe effort these two powers made to stake their claim on the Canteribbean was disproportionate. Saddle Arabian merchants took great care to ingratiate themselves with the locals in order to legitimise their presence. They petitioned for support from the Emir’s court which sent gifts and talented negotiators, along with cartographers and resource surveyors to stake their claim. In contrast, exerting control over the islands was a mere passion project for certain Equestrian administrators who took the loyalty of the pony population for granted. When the South-Eastern administration was reshuffled in 680, Equestria’s claims to the distant islands faded away into disinterest.\n\nMeanwhile, disheartened by constant disputes over the division of responsibilities, individual Cacicazgos quietly left the Confederation and placed themselves under Saddle Arabian protection, drawn by the promise of economic prosperity. The Saddle Arabians’ introduction of exotic goods like coffee beans and bananas as well as their control of trade ports increased dependency on their merchants, who were by now pushing for full incorporation of the islands. After a tense period of negotiations, the depleted Confederation signed away its sovereignty in 690 with the Treaty of Arubeira, which incorporated the Confederation into Saddle Arabia but granted it nominal jurisdiction over the islands so that the merchants could get down to business without distraction."
meridiennes_history.3.a:0 "...and found."

meridiennes_history.4.t:0 "Life Goes On"
meridiennes_history.4.d:0 "While some expected life under the Saddle Arabians to be one lived under the iron hoof of foreign domination, this fear never materialised. Instead, life went on much like before for most ponies, despite important changes arriving upon their shores. The Caciazgo was gradually made into a functional form of native self-governance through the introduction of the unifying authority of an Emir (Arabian Governor) and the extension of rigorous Arabian civil laws and courts to the islands. Ironically, the Confederation faded away soon after, merging entirely with the Arabian administration. Aided by Arabian merchants eager for returns on their investments, the ponies of the Canteribbean were finally in a position to dip their hooves into the modern world which beckoned from across seas.\n\nOnly, the islands were no longer inhabited just by ponies anymore. When explorers took an interest in the Canteribbean in the seventh centuries, many formed or joined communities that outlasted their governments’ investment but remained welcome by the cosmopolitan natives. Hippogriffs, zebras, griffons, Equestrian ponies, and of course horses from Saddle Arabia now formed a notable minority in many islands and infused parts of their cultures into the land.\n\nHowever, only the last of these groups could count on official support that would make their contributions entrenched. Arabian architecture permeated in many newly built structures, and although no official attempt at assimilation was made, natives adopted foods like falafel into their diets and Arabian clothing spread among the local elites. Arabian merchants also brought along with them their indentured servants, mostly donkeys, who began to cultivate traditional herbs and spices, like the ganja plant that was used for medicinal purposes and later gained local cultural significance."
meridiennes_history.4.a:0 "The more things remain, the more they change."

meridiennes_history.5.t:0 "Conflict in Paradise"
meridiennes_history.5.d:0 "The appointment of Emir Hisan in 781 began a saga that would upset the balance in the peaceful region. With great ambitions on his mind, on the day he arrived the Emir marched into the notorious gaming house in Mina' Alsalahif and demanded a one-time tax from the patrons. Infuriated, a band of regulars led by Alejandra Muñoz stormed a docked merchant ship and took off. Within a year, they were joined by three other armed vessels that enforced a sustained campaign of piracy on the islands, being careful to avoid ships flying the Arabian colours to placate their lethargic navy. This was small consolation to the locals who had to live under an atmosphere of fear, especially when the rowdy pirates would come onshore with impunity after bribing the small Arabian garrison and drunkenly ransack a port of their choosing.\n\nDetermined to secure aid from his patrons in person, Emir Hisan embarked for Saddle Arabia in early 783. Alas, soon after departing, his ship crossed paths with the pirate fleet which barrelled towards him, sensing an easy mark. But before they could close, the pirates were driven off by a volley of canonfire launched by a large vessel emerging from a secluded island, as if by divine intervention. The Emir’s saviour, Guillaume LeBlanc, an Aquileian corsair-turned-merchant, was indignant upon hearing of the Emir’s troubles. He persuaded the Emir to return to the islands to organise a militia by employing his crew as advisors and arms-suppliers instead of relying on a distant court.\n\nAt the end of the year, their efforts led a few dozen locals to be declared combat-ready. The Emir set a high-stakes trap by relocating his treasury to a less secure location to lure the pirates onshore. Upon arrival, the pirates were set upon by the militia laying in wait. Their engagement was chaotic and bloody, lasting an entire day as the pirates retreated into the jungle, and only surrendered after Muñoz was killed by a venomous snake. To commemorate what would become known as the first military conflict fought on the Canteribbean islands, the Emir offered LeBlanc’s crew to settle on the islands and declared a state of unending friendship between Aquileia and Saddle Arabia, much to the confusion of the two courts."
meridiennes_history.5.a:0 "Friendship beats piracy. Always."

meridiennes_history.6.t:0 "Gracious Gift of Tropics"
meridiennes_history.6.d:0 "While the islands remained safe from piracy, they could not be shielded from global economic trends. In truth, long before Emir Hisan’s arrival, the islands were losing economic value. While still turning a profit, the Canteribbean was no longer the golden goose Arabian merchants once imagined it as. Technological improvements allowed merchant ships to cross continents without the need for rest in a quaint tropical port, while the Zebrican interior was further opened to trade which diminished the need for goods sourced from the islands.\n\nWhile contributing to decline in its own way, the piracy debacle of 781-83 rather dramatically exposed the lack of interest in the islands felt by the Arabian court. What could have been solved in weeks dragged on for years and relied on intervention by a random foreign merchant. Realising his leash was longer than he thought, the Emir began asserting his independence over the next year by claiming rights normally reserved for the mainland court and developing the new militia force. In secret, the Emir began shopping around for a foreign partner that would prove more interested in investing in the islands, already having rebuked Equestrian officials out of fears they would infringe on the rights of the locals.\n\nUpon hearing of the forced marriage of Giselda Discet to Emperor Grover II following Aquileia’s conquest in 785, the Emir pounced. Animated by a fondness for Aquileia after his close escape and reasoning that a defeated kingdom would have every reason to take a genuine interest in a new possession, the Emir sent his friend, Guillaume LeBlanc, to Aquileia to deliver an extraordinary wedding gift to the Queen - the islands of the Canteribbean themselves. The handover itself was a fait accompli, with Aquileian soldiers arriving before news even reached the disappointed Arabian court. Emir Hisan returned to Saddle Arabia to smooth things over and his descendants would remain steadfast friends of both Aquileia and the Canteribbean.\n\nAccepting excitedly, Queen Giselda even decided to spend her honeymoon on the islands, making sure to drag Grover II to every native site possible, amazed at the “independence” and “resilience” displayed by the locals and personally commending the Emir for the respect he’d shown to the “cultural autonomy” of the natives, all in earshot of her grumpy husband."
meridiennes_history.6.a:0 "A wedding gift AND honeymoon destination?"

meridiennes_history.7.t:0 "Two Peaceful Centuries"
meridiennes_history.7.d:0 "Despite the Emir’s high hopes of immediate Aquileian investments, it took a while for the defeated kingdom to make proper use of their newfound possession. During the first few years of Aquileian control, it was actually other imperial subjects who capitalised on the potential of the islands. Of special note are the Feathisians, who poured investment capital into four villages on the archipelago of Les Abondantes, hoping to gain influence over the native labourforce. Most of these ventures eventually failed, with the exception of Deshayes which became a thriving town and remains tightly integrated with the Van Stiphout company to this day.\n\nOnce Aquileians brought their full attention to the islands it became clear that they saw their new possession explicitly as a colony which was to host a griffon majority in order to ensure its loyalty. Initial colonisation efforts were restricted to the families of officials and merchants in order to avoid abusing the locals’ hospitality. However, Grover II’s invasion and incorporation of Sicameon was to prove a watershed moment for the griffon population on the islands. Eager to flee their devastated home, many Sicameonese recalled romantic tales of their ancestors living overseas in prosperity and peace. Some of these dreamers turned to Les Meridiennes, where they were happily incorporated into existing Sicameonese-speaking communities and welcomed as refugees by the natives, regardless of the scale of their immigration.\n\nThe influx of immigrants revitalised Les Meridiennes. Those who came were available to work on the plantations which were more productive than ever due to the introduction of modern tools and techniques. Immigrants often maintained connection with the mainland and were able to stimulate demand for Canteribbean products by word of beak alone, which helped the islands’ economy. Good fortune would continue to bless the islands with steady economic growth and a placid political situation persisted even after Aquileia broke off from the Empire in 972. For a time."
meridiennes_history.7.a:0 "A blessing of quiet prosperity."

meridiennes_history.8.t:0 "Arrival of Disaster"
meridiennes_history.8.d:0 "While Les Meridiennes was becoming better connected to the wider world, it still took a Pridean flotilla fleeing to their shores to notify the islands of the First Aquileian Revolution. Governor Bernadette Vidal reacted with speed and decisiveness. Les Meridiennes was placed on high alert with militia forces mustered, bearing their most threatening-looking flintlocks, ready to combat any revolutionary activity. But the islands were quiet. The locals’ loyalties were further confirmed when they extended their typical warm welcome by offering shelter and food to the monarchist exiles who began to arrive in droves. The religious ceremonies performed by the native ponies to bless their new friends even won over the Rileans who looked at the backwards tropical islands with utter despair, although they may have found the chants more entertaining than inspirational.\n\nReceiving orders from Marechal Berthelot, leader of the monarchist resistance on the mainland, Governor Vidal met with the exiled monarchists, hoping to stave off rising hopelessness or potential disorder by focusing their attention on future plans. She laid out her view - the islands were remarkably loyal, completely isolated from the reach of the Republicans, and, she assured them, utterly committed to serving the kingdom as best they could. The following weeks saw Port-Giselda’s telegraph office swamped with griffons in royal army uniforms. Ships packed with correspondence cycled in and out of port under the heaviest escort they’ve ever seen, aiming for the Griffonian coast.\n\nIn the Canteribbean, safe from Republican clutches, the inklings of a plan were coming together. A plan for a counter-revolution."
meridiennes_history.8.a:0 "Les Meridiennes rises to the call."

meridiennes_history.9.t:0 "Patriots’ Debut"
meridiennes_history.9.d:0 "Soon after the exiles' arrival, the islands received even more special visitors - the remaining members of the Discret royal family. Most did not venture outside the capital, impatient to transit to a more acceptable place of exile. However, some like the future Duke Gadiffer took the time to tour the countryside and appreciate  the same places as Queen Giselda saw on her honeymoon. The royal presence boosted morale among the monarchists but remained brief due to an invitation from the descendents of Emir Hisan, the islands’ former Aquileiaphile governor, offering refuge in their luxurious palace in Saddle Arabia.\n\nDespite the Discrets’ departure, preparation for the counter-revolution continued in Les Meridiennes. The lone military factory on the islands was renovated with émigré aid and began working on strenuous long shifts staffed by local griffons to keep up continuous production of small arms. Textile artisans worked overtime to outfit the monarchist forces while Aquileia-owned plantations provided sugar rations to sweeten the effort.\n\nIn 983, a young batpony named Tarte Au Corossol gained acclaim among the exiles for leading a group of local youths to expel alleged republican spies trying to unionise a weapons workshop. After repeated interventions, she quickly gained a cult following among the most passionate Aquileians and they soon founded the Mouvement Patriotique Aquilien (MPA), a group devoted to a monarchist Aquileian nation. The organisation would become intimately involved with the mobilisation, encouraging workers to put in unpaid overtime, sending members to oversee production in workshops, and arranging marches and events to instil patriotic spirit.\n\nWhile local harmonists saw the MPA as disruptive, there is no denying that their tactics led to broad increases in productivity and rallied the wavering exiles. Most of all, the MPA proved that Les Meridiennes was, and would forever remain, loyal to the crown."

meridiennes_history.10.t:0 "The Counter Revolution"
meridiennes_history.10.d:0 "As preparations for counter-revolution progressed, the exiles began to extend their effort beyond the islands. Leading the charge were members of Tarte’s MPA, who volunteered to infiltrate the mainland in order to organise monarchist resistance cells. Unexpectedly, the MPA’s zeal proved popular among many Aquileians, especially in Westkeep, and the movement would grow in mainstream popularity. The exile navy was placed under the command of Baron Dennis, another sympathiser of the movement. The ships were bolstered by upgrades procured from Equestrian and Wingbardian shipyards in preparation for their homecoming.\n\nWhen Marechal Albert Berthelot, leader of the mainland monarchist movement, signalled his readiness to begin the counter-revolution in 985, the exiles of Les Meridiennes moved into action. Baron Dennis took the fleet to smash any republican vessels before moving to bombard republican forces along the Aquileian coast, culminating in the shelling of Pridea. Monarchist forces made up of both exiles and newly recruited locals took advantage of the republican disorganisation and made simultaneous landings all along the coast. Pushing inland and towards major cities, they were joined by jubilant MPA partisans and Berthelot’s forces. Overwhelmed by the decisive assault, republican leadership collapsed into chaos, paving the way for the restoration of the rightful Discret dynasty."

meridiennes_history.11.t:0 "The Restoration Recession"
meridiennes_history.11.d:0 "Praise was showered upon Les Meridiennes for the vital role the islands played in the Restoration. However, gratitude notwithstanding, when the exiles returned home they withdrew most of their investments while the sudden depopulation of domestic consumers hit the economy hard. The second punch would come from the royal government itself, when in 990 the mainland beet sugar industry received a significant royal subsidy, making sugar cane plantations in Les Meridiennes unable to compete, bringing significant knock-on effects to the entire export economy.\n\nIn response to frantic requests from Governor Vidal, the court eventually sent Lord Monnet to investigate the conditions on the islands. His 992 report would become the blueprint for reform for the next decade. The brief recession following the Restoration was stymied by guaranteeing an Aquileian market for a certain quantity of cane sugar, while economic development was pursued with heavy reliance on industrial goods sourced from the mainland.\n\nWhile wages and living standards rose as the economy recovered and modernised, it would increasingly prove to be an unsustainable solution. Aquileian investment slowed down in the early 1000s, and recent reports suggest that the economy of Les Meridiennes would not survive without mainland assistance . Should a crisis disrupt the relationship between colony and home, there is no telling what the future will bring to the island paradise."
meridiennes_history.11.a:0 "Tough times in the tropics."

meridiennes_history.12.t:0 "A Brief History of the Summer Islands"
meridiennes_history.12.d:0 "In many ways, the Summer Islands are like estranged siblings to Les Meridiennes. Both sets of Canteribbean islands were settled around the same time by Equestrian settlers, enjoy similar flora and environment, and have developed their own ways of life. However, while the southern archipelagos attracted great attention from foreign explorers in the seventh century which culminated in their annexation by Saddle Arabia, the Summer Islands were left undisturbed, perhaps shielded by their closer physical proximity to Equestria or simple disinterest.\n\nRemaining part of the pony nation was a mixed blessing for the islands. While the Arabians invested in the economy and governance of their Canteribbean possessions, the Summer Islands were left to fend for themselves. The administration of the islands was heavily disputed between the officials in Puerto Caballo and Southpoint, and it was only in 790 that the conflict was solved when a permanent Equestrian governor was appointed to the islands and order was brought to the islands.\n\nTo make the islands profitable, sugar cane was introduced as a cash crop in the ninth century where it joined the mango plantations established earlier by batpony entrepreneurs from the South-East. Despite these investments, locals are far poorer on average than in Les Meridiennes due to the low demand for their products on Equestrian markets, a problem only exacerbated when the industrial revolution seemed to pass over the islands.\n\nIn recent years, the Summer Islands have been dominated by Tropic Haze, the first university-educated native. Upon her return in 1002, the earth pony began harassing the governor with relentless petitions and travelling across the islands teaching literacy classes, hoping to instil political consciousness in the locals.\n\nWith the recent union with Les Meridiennes, Tropic Haze is cautiously optimistic that the concerns of the Summer Islands will be better met under a government closer to home. However, her first priority remains the wellbeing of the locals, and should her new benefactors neglect her compatriots like Equestria once did, there will be hell to pay."

Intentional on Antoine’s part, no doubt. She walked around the sofa and sat down, looking over the battlefield of mail. Letters from family, bills, and an absurd number of advertisements – all the usual.\nThat was, except for one single letter, purple in color. Unlike the rest of the mail, this letter lay centered and straight, a few centimeters from the edge of the coffee table.

Are you trying to move your entire studio in one trip?”\n     “Why ever not?” She replied politely. “And to what do I owe your introduction?”\n     “Yes, well, you’re the talk of the town, Mrs. Daisy.” He said jovially. “An entire animation studio on our sleepy little islands… most of us never would have imagined it. I’m glad that you saw the value in our competitive international pricing, and we look forwards to helping you on your next blockbuster.”\n     “Yes, yes.” Daisy answered. She reached the end of the docks and her hippogriff chauffer opened the door to a bomb-black car. In minutes, clouds had come in front of the sun and a few small drops of rain fell on her coat. “Well, I would like to continue this business talk, but…” She shrugged and fit herself into the backseat. As the car drove away, she sighed. She was surprised that it had taken this long for her to see a griffon on these islands and was happy to have an excuse to postpone further interactions. The mayor was so small-minded, she would dislike him especially." #Catnapper

For this event, you must know that one of Navet's more notable flaws is that he's simply god awful with money. Not because he blows it all on frivolities, but because he just does not understand the real value of it. The letter itself is NOT his father refusing to give him more money as you would initially assume, but rather a sort-of pleading affair. Navet is entitled to an equal share of some inheritance type thing as his father and manages to effortlessly sap the value out of it . He essentially begs Navet through very basic wording to be more aware of what money actually MEANS, but Naive Navet naturally misunderstands this to comedic effect."

meridiennes.1.t:0 "The Economic Reform Hearings" 
meridiennes.1.d:0 ""...and so, I firmly propose that we must no longer rely on Aquileian imports and instead diversify our own economy," the unicorn merchant concluded. He took a deep breath, pushed his glasses up with his left hoof, and gazed at the administration council before him.\nAt one look, he wondered if he had entered the wrong building. The dozen or so appointed nobles, sitting behind pristine wooden podiums, almost all had their heads supported by their claws. A few opened their beaks in a collective yawn. One even slept like a rock, his forehead placed firmly on top of his desk. The pony pondered how much of his proposal they had listened to.\n"Thank you," a voice spoke from the center. Below the 5-meter portrait of King Moriset, and in a podium raised above the rest of nobles, sat a griffon with dark blue hair. In juxtaposition to her court, her attentive eyes shifted between making eye contact with the merchant and looking down to her papers. Her left talon scribbled upon her desk with great care and precision.\nSo this was Geneviève Volière? The merchant had never seen a creature with such focus.\n"No, thank you, Lady Geneviève," he responded with a small bow of his head.\nGeneviève nodded to her citizen and looked to the crowd behind him. Ponies, horses, and griffons of various backgrounds sat in rows of chairs, all the way down to the entrance of the court. An accurate representation of the islands the King had appointed her to govern. And for King Moriset, she would do everything she could.\nThe governess put her pen down and opened her beak. "We have a few more groups to hear from as we conclude today’s hearings on our economic reform. I understand we all have different views on how we should remodel our economy, but I am pleased that we all agree on the necessity of change. We are bound to a united cause, and I hope this will be a precedent for the future of Les Meridiennes. By His Highness' will, we will fix our islands' economy together."\n"Now, let’s move on to our next proposition...""

meridiennes.2.d:0 "Moments of rest were far and few in between for Geneviève as her work called her attention at all times of the day, and today was no exception. Forms and requests from local governors sat neatly in the left-hand corner of her desk. Next to that stack were the petitions from citizens that had the required signatures to warrant an examination. A third stack, dedicated to the weekly reports of her ministry heads. And a fourth for miscellaneous writings related to her position.\nHer talon moved with speed and grace, and her eyes darted back and forth through the requests from her subjects. Her whole attention onto her job removed the office from her peripherals. Her bookcases disappeared. Her guest couches were gone. All was lost to the void surrounding her.\n"Lost in work again?" a voice shook Geneviève’s world. She nearly jumped out of her chair at the sudden appearance of a bronze-colored figure in her office.\nAntoine, her secretary. Geneviève glared at the smiling pegasus. "Warn me next time you come in," she groaned.\nAntoine chuckled. "If you recall, which you seem to have not, I had rung your phone twice. I then knocked on your door a few times. After no response, I assumed you may have finally died from overwork, and it warranted the urgency to enter your office. And here I find you, like usual, engulfed in a well-organized cesspool of work."\nGeneviève rubbed her brow. "What is it, Antoine?"\n"You have guests from the PKM, the PPH, and even the MPA all here to lend their support to your reform plan – that is, if they don’t kill one another in the waiting room beforehand."\nThe governess leaned back and dropped her pen. "Can you tell if they’re hear for more than just providing support?"\nHer secretary shrugged. "It’s hard to tell. Regardless, letting them voice their public support would be helpful. Not that we need it to pass the reform, of course, but rather for-"\n"-for unity," Geneviève finished Antoine’s sentence.\nHe nodded. "It’s all up to you, governess.""

meridiennes.3.t:0 "Hearings Conclude"
meridiennes.3.d:0 "The afternoon sun peered into the courtroom and landed on the tiled floor. A silence possessed the hall, and all that could be heard were the scribbles of the governess and the muffled sounds of chirping outside.\nThe creatures in the rows kept their voices silent, not just out of politeness but out of a disbelief. For days, countless creatures of countless camps spoke before court in hopes of having their personal ideas of reformation understood. Some would take only a few minutes, while others would speak for hours. For anycreature other than the governess, it was a test of patience, with the bleak hope that their speech would not be taken for granted.\nAnd it was finally over. Geneviève dropped her pen and leaned up from her chair.\n"My citizens, I cannot thank you enough for the words and viewpoints you have provided to me throughout these hearings. I am blessed to have been chosen to govern these islands. Greater to me than its beauty or economy are the creatures that inhabit it. You are all vital parts of Les Meridiennes, and I believe that together we can make it through this recession.\n"Having heard your opinions on the matter, I believe that we have developed a reform plan suitable for everycreature on the isles. There is still the matter of civilian infrastructure to deal with, but I have under my claws a written-out plan forged by your aid. With my stamp, we will begin its execution and save our Meridiennes. For both king and country."\nGeneviève raised her stamp and pushed it down against her completed form. At first, the silence persisted. But slowly, one set of hoofs began clapping in the back. Two more horses followed, and eventually, the whole room applauded with sincerity. The governess gazed momentarily to the portrait of King Moriset above her, then turned back to her citizens."

meridiennes.4.t:0 "Renovating the University of Port Giselda"
meridiennes.4.d:0 ""I find this university... unkempt," Antoine bemoaned as he followed Geneviève down the cobblestone walkway. Indeed, though it was the primary university of Les Meridiennes, calling the place run-down would be a compliment. Black ooze, unidentifiable by eye, covered the walls of the buildings. Wood and broken glass filled the void of where a significant number of windows should be. A water-pipe jutted out from the ground to the two’s side, where a water fountain once was.\nAntoine gagged as some grotesque stench invade his nostrils. "Do you want us to get infected by some new illness before you listen to my advice? Or perhaps cut our appendages on some broken glass? Though the latter hasn’t happened, I fear that the former may have already occurred," he complained before mustering a false cough.\nGeneviève sighed, her eyes still focused forward. "This university once was the shining jewel of education in the Canteribbean before a hurricane landed twenty years ago. Since then, we’ve yet to renovate it."\n"And why was that?" the pegasus asked.\n"We simply let our citizens study on the mainland," the governess answered. "We willingly neglected the school."\n"Then why change the status quo now? Why not... provide a scholarship to study in the mainland or something?"\nGeneviève stopped, prompting her secretary to freeze in his tracks. "It has contributed to our economic problems, yes, but more than that is the damage to our pride. Les Meridiennes deserves more. We’ve- No, I’ve made a mistake by ignoring this," she spoke.\nAntoine looked over his solemn governess' shoulder and tilted his head. She still kept her eyes turned away from Antoine. He shriveled his brow, then after a few moments, leaned back and sighed. "My governess, you hold yourself far too accountable. After all, those fools you call your court prove their uselessness by not approaching the subject. Nor did your minister of education discover the issue."\n"I too ignored it," Geneviève replied.\nWhy did the governess always put the blame onto herself? Antoine rubbed his temples with his hoof, then cleared his throat. "Alright, governess, you’ve convinced me. I'll help save this university. On one condition..."\nThe governess merely nodded to hear the rest.\n"You take a break once this is all done.""

meridiennes.5.d:0 "Salade sat on the bench in the park and looked around, covering his eyes from the sun. A family of griffons played together just across the path that his seat stood on, the father grabbing his toddler hatchling and raising her high in the air. A pony couple walked side by side down the path, their heart-filled eyes embracing the depths of each other’s souls. An elderly zebra and a horse played chess in the refreshment area just down the walkway, their faces downcast towards the table where a battle of wits took place.\nSalade breathed in the nice sea air and spoke. "It’s a beautiful day, isn’t it?"\n"A little sunny, but perfect otherwise," a feminine voice responded. The pegasus turned his head to find a familiar zebra leaning against a tree. She had a permanent smile plastered across her face that was warm yet shallow. Behind those eyes, however, was an enigma that none of his spies could unmask.\n"Mama Ruby," he said with a smile, "Glad you could make it."\n     The zebra walked past Salade and sat next to him on the bench. "I’m always willing to talk, Salade."\nHe laughed. "Then perhaps you could tell me about Facilier?"\nNo muscle moved on Ruby’s face. She kept her smile, but Salade continued to sense something hiding behind it. "Come now, Salade. I don’t question the kind of company you’re with."\n"Oh, I’m only joking, Ruby. Truthfully, though I am skeptical of your relationship with Facilier, I respect your work. Many of my own help you. Not just the spies, I mean. They simply appreciate the work you do for our islands," Salade responded.\nThe zebra nodded. "Well, I cannot say the same of your espionage, but I know you care for Les Meridiennes. So then, what have you called me to discuss?"\n"We both agree and wish to aid the governess in her reforms, correct? Then it would be best that we try to work together and figure out where we help her. After all, two heads – and wallets – are better than one," Salade said with a wave of his hoof.\nRuby crossed her hooves together. "Well, I’ll admit, I didn’t except you of all creatures to come forward with a genuine proposition."\nThe pegasus smiled at his temporary ally. "Like you said, I care for Les Meridiennes."\nThe zebra nodded. "As do I.""

meridiennes.6.d:0 ""It’s about time," Acalan muttered to himself as he spotted a brown dot appear on the water below. The foal grabbed a vine with one hoof, walked a few steps back, and took a running start towards the edge. With the swing of the vine, Acalan launched himself off the cliff and into the open sky.\nHe adored the touch of the wind moving across his fur. The adrenaline pumping through his veins. He let out a loud yell of excitement as he flew further and further away from the rocks. His body stabilized itself and aimed him towards the ground, seeing the clear water come closer to him.\nBut before he even fell half the length of the cliff, a blur shot past him and he felt two warm talons snatch his forearms.\n"Acalan! How many times do I need to tell you not to do that?" a familiar voice spoke from above. Acalan looked up to see a griffon with orange feathers gasping for breath.\n“Sorry, Ms. Louisa,” he replied. His teacher lowered him slowly to sea level where a large boat floated, though to call it a boat was a stretch. It looked as if somecreature from Aquileia took a schoolhouse and placed it on a raft just a few meters larger than itself.\nMs. Louisa placed her student on the edge of the floating school and landed. She sighed. "That was really dangerous, you know?"\nThe foal tilted his head. "But there’s water!"\nThe griffon shook her head. "It may be fine a few meters above the water, but the higher you jump from a cliff, the more the water will hurt you. From that height, it wouldn’t be pretty, and your parents wouldn’t like it. Your village may even stop sending you and the other kids here."\n"Oh," Acalan said as he absorbed the information.\nMs. Louisa patted her student on his head. "You like this school, don’t you?"\nThe earth foal nodded his head vigorously. "I like it a lot!"\n"Then promise me you won’t do that again, okay?"\n"Yes, ma’am!"  the foal replied. He put his hoof into his teacher’s talon, to the surprise of Ms. Louisa. She smiled, however, and led her little student in. While she had initially been unhappy being sent to Les Loyales with a new school, nothing could replace the relationship she had gained with her students."

It has been a long month, but the work our friends at the Stable Structures Reconstruction Company have done is more than anyone could ask for. What was once a crippled university riddled with damage has once again become a jewel of our island.\n"What this reconstruction symbolizes is not just education, but a reminder in the pride we should have. Not just the pride we should have as Aquileian citizens, but the regional pride we should have as Meridienners. It is with that great pride that we continue to educate ourselves, build our businesses, and serve the King at our best. Thank you all."\nA round of applause and cheers erupted before Genevieve. She nodded at her citizens and walked back to her chair at the back side of the stage as the university’s chancellor took the mic back and waited for the clapping to end.\n"So?" Antoine asked. He sat just right of Genevieve, with a portable pony-friendly typewriter on his lap.\n"So what?" Genevieve asked back.\nAntoine hooves moved around the typewriter as the chancellor began his speech. "Remember that promise you made? About taking a break?"\nGenevieve looked down and reached into her thoughts until she found the promise he had mentioned. She scowled and whispered, "I don’t recall it being so much as a promise as it was a condition."\nAntoine stopped typing and frowned. "Please don’t find a way to break the promise, governess. Try as I might, I fear I could not take your place if you were to die of overwork."\n"I won’t- Ack, fine!" Genevieve snapped with a wave of her talon. Though she still muttered the words, it was loud enough for her to garner the attention of those on the stage. Even the chancellor looked back. Before he saw anything, however, the governess flipped back to normal, her eternal straight face covering up her outburst.\nAntoine, however, was beaming."

meridiennes.9.d:0 ""...and that concludes my report, Your Majesty," Genevieve mimicked her written words before she dotted the final period on her letter. She tapped her chin with her pen and looked through her words once more. Contained in her letter was a detailed list of each part of her reform. Months of work all summarized into a couple of paragraphs. A feat few could muster, especially when royalty is involved.\nShe looked up to a massive portrait of King Moriset hanging above the entrance to her office. His brown feathers came to life in the paint upon the canvas. Each stroke, each pass of the brush - it all served to portray His Majesty as he was. His portraits were common in the governor's building, but this one was special to her: It was given to her by the King himself. Not some reproduction of an old painting, but a new portrait in which King Moriset had to pose for hours. He sat on his throne, but had a warm smile not worn by royalty. A smile that filled Genevieve with the strength to push herself on her worst days.\nBy some miracle, she was in his good graces, but that only heightened his expectations of her. Everything she did had to be perfect. Even what she ate or how she acted had to be just right, for being His Majesty's representative meant that any negative view of her was a negative view of the King.\nShe could not make a mistake. She went through her letter a second time, ensuring it had proper grammar and content. After that was complete, she nodded to herself, then got up off her chair. However, a paper ball crumbled under her back paw, almost causing her to yelp. What was that?\nGenevieve looked back at her paws to find dozens of rough drafts balled up and thrown around her chair. How many letters had she written in the last few hours?\nThe griffon shook her head then walked to her office door. She'd take care of that later. For now, she had a letter to send to the king."

meridiennes.10.t:0 "The King's Response"
meridiennes.10.d:0 ""My wonderful subject,\n"I thank you for your work over this past year. It has been evident that your dedication to the crown has been a large factor in the success of your work. You have provided exemplary aid to the Kingdom, and strengthened the resolve of the creatures that inhabit Les Meridiennes. Once more, our islands have become a jewel of Aquileia.\n"Attached to this package is a gift from my own collection, expensive as it is rare. I am looking forward to your next project.\n"Sincerely, Your Majesty, King Moriset."\nGenevieve dropped the letter and looked at the silver spoon inside of a glass case. The engravings in the handle must have been all hand-welded. The patterns, sets of metal tendrils that wrapped around one another and united into a single entity, had a level of detail that the governess had never seen on silverware such as this. Even a few small gemstones rested in visually pleasing positions on the handle.\nDid the King specifically pick this out for her? How long did it take for him to choose this? Such a magnificent object, gifted from the King’s own collection.\nThe governess smiled and squeezed her talons together. She couldn’t have asked for a better reward from King Moriset himself. Genevieve jumped off her chair and took the glass-enclosed spoon in one talon, then walked to the central bookcase in her office.\nGenevieve Voliere was not one for showing off. In fact, she had always despised such an action. But, to receive such a gift from the King himself, what else could she do? She placed the silver spoon at eye-level and took a few steps back.\nAll the other knick-knacks she had received didn’t matter. Gifts, awards, prizes – they were all ridiculous things she had stumbled into. This spoon, however? It was a testament. Proof that it was her actions, not her position, that provided better lives for her citizens. For her king.\nAnd nothing could slow her down."

meridiennes_two.1.t:0 "A Letter from Les Meridiennes"
meridiennes_two.1.d:0 ""Your Majesty, a letter has arrived from the islands," King Moriset’s attendant announced with a courteous bow.\nThe King looked down from his throne and raised his eyebrow. A teacup sat on the arm rest, with a silver spoon and a saucer to complement it. "Oh, yes, it is that time of year, is it not? A letter from... Gianna? Garnet?"\n"Genevieve is her name, Your Majesty."\nKing Moriset nodded. "Ah, yes, Genevieve. Alright, you may bring it over here."\nThe attendant stood from his bow and walked up a set of steps to where the throne resided. Once he reached the top, he bent his legs down once more and raised his talons hold the letter to the king. King Moriset snatched the parchment and waved the attendant away. With a third, small bow, the servicegriffon stepped off the stairs and towards the door of the throne room.\nThe king punctured the top of the letter with his claw and pulled out the letter that had, unfortunately, not been spared of his letter-opening skills. Nevertheless, he opened the paper and began reading:\n"Your Majesty, may you be ever healthy in this time. I come to you with a report upon the successful economic reform of Les Meridiennes. In previous years, our island has lacked the growth and fervor that it once had before the unfortunate actions of the republican rebels. We had left this alone initially, but the signs were apparent: This could lead to a full economic collapse of the islands if not handled. Thus, our creatures took the steps necessary to save our economy, and in only a few months, the predictions for Les Meridiennes’ fate have been avoided. Listed are the steps taken..."\nKing Moriset smiled and leaned back in his chair. All was well, wasn’t it? His ministry was foolish to convince him otherwise.\n"Attendant," he spoke as he raised his talon.\nTo the right of the throne, an attendant arrived, seemingly out of nowhere. "Yes, Your Majesty?"\nHe handed the letter. "Take this and send a reply to Governess… Giena of Les Meridiennes. Let her know my pleasure in her work. Oh, and uh," the King looked around before grabbing the spoon from his tea set beside him, "Send her this as a gift. I have more anyways.""

A desk the mare now lay heaped upon, sobs racking her body as she laments 'you idiot, you damnable fool' in equal parts directed at Moriset and herself.

meridiennes_m_rev.1.d:0 "The heaviest air Genevieve ever felt rested in the courthouse. What was once her domain felt as unfamiliar as a new land to an explorer. Only, it shouldn’t be as such. It was uncanny, as if there was an invisible beast staring at Genevieve from the corner of the room, just out of her peripherals. She turned her neck, only to find an empty corner, but the sensation remained. That fear remained.\nGenevieve rubbed her damp palms together and looked back at the crowd. The usual groups came. Merchants, shopkeepers, farmers, elites… they were all here. None looked at one another, just directly at the governess. What was it they were here for again? Why did they stare at her?\nOh yes, the meeting. She looked down at her papers and cleared her throat. "I understand what we’re all here for. I don’t think there’s a single creature on these islands that haven’t heard of the rebellion on the mainland. And so, we must come to a consensus on how we as a dominion should help our kingdom. So, without further ado, let us begin this meeting."\nAt first, the silence persisted. Each and every creature in the room looked around at one another, unsure how to speak their mind about the encroaching revolution. But one horse near the front raised her hoof. "I-I don’t think we should pull ourselves into the war. We have too much to lose."\nGenevieve nodded and wrote out her words on her paper, as she always did. And perhaps that was what she needed to feel normal once more: Returning to normality. She would just do what she always did.\nThen a scoff came out from the front.\n"Coward. You would ignore our kingdom for yourself?"\nThe governess shot her neck up to find a griffon with glasses a couple rows in front of the horse.\nThe horse huffed. "What I’m doing is protecting my family!"\n"Well, wait until the revolution comes here, and see how your family will be then."\n"Don’t talk to her like-"\n"Hey, shut it!"\nDozens of voices spoke out at once. The governess gasped as her citizens fought one another, screaming into each other’s faces as if this were a pub. She looked at the nobility next to her, who all kept silent as always. She tried to speak up, but no creature could hear her.\nShe leaned back, waiting for it all to end, but the arguments persisted. And the fear remained."

After that first failure of a court, Genevieve managed to ring everyone back to sanity and discuss their ideas rather than yell them. Not that it was easy. Every comment, every speech, she could see somecreature ready to leap off their chair in attack. She could barely keep the lid on things, and it was getting tougher each meeting.\n"And like usual, you have your beak stuck in piles of papers," a familiar voice said. Genevieve shot her head up to find the same bat pony she’d known her whole life.\n"Tarte," Genevieve, “It’s been a while."\nThe pony smiled. "Same to you. It’s been almost a decade since we’ve talked, hasn’t it?"\nGenevieve leaned up from her chair and was about to give an excuse, but Tarte raised her hoof to stop her. "Don’t worry," the bat pony said, "I know you’ve been busy."\nThe governess leaned back and sighed. "It wasn’t just that."\nThe two sat in silence for a moment, only looking into each other’s eyes. In Tarte’s soul, Genevieve could sense a rainbow of emotions that mirrored her own. A fractal of thoughts and opinions that would take a book to explain. The two were connected in one way – and so very distant in so many others.\nTarte cleared her throat. "As you can guess from last meeting, the MPA and most of the bleeding-heart nobles have joined sides, Trot Barley included. We believe the only way Les Meridiennes can go is to join in on the battle in the mainland."\nGenevieve nodded and looked down at her papers. "Our admin is leaning towards a more moderate approach, as is Mama Ruby and her followers. We just don’t have the creaturepower to spare."\nThe bat pony chuckled, perhaps in subtle disbelief, and looked away. "I get it. Honestly, I do."\nThe two went silent again, and nothing but the air of tension and the slight echo from outside Genevieve's door accompanied them.\nThe griffon started up. "I-I read your-"\n"I think it's best I leave," Tarte interrupted. "I-it was good to see you again, Genevieve. Honestly."\nThe bat pony turned away and walked towards the door, leaving Genevieve to wallow in the aftereffects of a shotty reunion. The griffon reached her talon out, and words filled up in her throat, but once Tarte opened the door and exited through the threshold, what she wanted to say subsided into regret. Genevieve dropped her claw down and sighed."

### Moderates Branch Stuff ###
meridiennes_m_rev.3.t:0 "A visit with the University"
meridiennes_m_rev.3.d:0 ""As you know, our island is splintered on how we should help at the mainland," Genevieve spoke to the current chancellor of the University of Port Giselda, "Our administration has decided to side with the moderates, as we don’t have the capabilities to join the war without widespread suffering for our islanders."\nThe old griffon smiled and removed his glasses, then rubbed the smudges with a cloth between his fingers. "I’m glad to see you’re taking this side, but why come to me? Can’t you just stamp a paper and call it done?"\nThe goveness shook her head and sighed. "Legally I can, but our islands have always been stable because of whatever democracy I can afford. If I were to force our islands to remain inactive, yet the majority wanted to join the war, it would bring far more harm than joining the mainland in the fight."\n"Indeed," a new voice spoke. Or rather a voice that had always been there but had yet to speak. "It’s important to encourage unity in this time of distress."\nThe chancellor nearly jumped out of his chair. He had yet to notice the middle-aged zebra sitting in the chair next to Genevieve’s.\nAfter catching his breath, he opened his beak. "I’m sorry, and you are?"\n"Ruby," the zebra said as she outstretched her hoof out.\nThe professor extended his talon and shook her hoof before he nodded in remembrance. "Ah, yes, a pleasure to meet you."\n"The pleasure's all mine," Mama Ruby said with a warm smile. Genevieve couldn’t help but feel anxious at her gaze, though. It was unreadable. Unknowable. Like there was something greater behind those eyes than anyone could know.\n"She reached out to me and backed our faction. So, could you aid our faction?"\nThe elderly griffon shot his eyes back to Genevieve as he let go of Mama Ruby’s hoof. "Oh, of course! Anything you want, governess.""

It only rose in intensity as he strained to pick up the large crate and pitch it up so that his companion could pull it onto the bed. When he could finally take his claws off of it without fear of it falling off, one of the Zebras called out "Meet us out back and we'll show you how to lift, little boy!", causing the others to cheer and holler.

"Understood, governess."\nHe quickly ran out and closed the door. The muffled sound of panicked voices and movements behind the door continued to echo through the room, but an overbearing silence followed.\nGenevieve tried to straighten out the telegrams, but they didn’t listen to her talons. Some were crumpled. Some were cut unevenly. Some had tooth marks. There was too much disorder to the slips of paper.\nThe griffon took a deep breath and calmed her thoughts. She was supposed to be strong. For her king and for her citizens. She was supposed to be resourceful, smart, and always have an answer for everything.

Now, many are awaiting trial and probable early release for poor health on charges of violating new anti-extremism laws put in place to make it harder for ultranationalists and other obnoxious groups to have undue sway over our politics.\n\nThere have been complaints about this. Numerous politicians of Aquileia have sent us a message on the subject which, in short, reads "We could hear their bones creaking when we sent them over. They couldn't possibly have been that much trouble." Another prominent critic was an MPA high-roller of many years, who gave a beautiful off-the-cuff treatise on the tyranny of the PPH to a few dozen of his supporters from the rocking chair on his front porch and then fell asleep. A few within our own party have also raised concerns about this unsubtle approach, but some time spent talking to arrestees convinced them that no harm was being done to our political sphere.\n\nThe effect is already clear. Bored youth are no longer able to spend lazy afternoons hearing the old folks ranting about some nonsense, and the few extremists who are young enough to use a gun well have gotten the message that they should tone done their rhetoric or else risk arrest."

It was insanity, a transparent attempt to grab power for the powerful and add another layer of legal defense to keep the workers down.\n\nBut what had him really angry was that he just had to live with it. He had seen the projections, the voter turnouts, everything. Leftism was just not as popular these days, and revolutionary thought even less so. He couldn't even remove this corrupt legislature from its precious hall if all of his revolutionary comrades were standing just outside, and the attempt coming out to anything besides a further repression was simply impossible.\n\nHe joined the stream of exiting politicians as he decided that the only thing to do was to flee and bide his time as he waited for things to change. One day this tyrannical oligarchy would be revealed to all, then he could have his revolution.\n\nIn his blinding anger, he suddenly bumped into a MPA delegate in front of him who had voted in favor. The word "prick" was muttered, followed by a venemous glare from the old stallion, but Beauxregard was not in a position to get into a fight. He knew when he wasn't welcome anymore, and if the stare he was getting from the MPA youth scoutmaster across the street was anything to go by, he'd best start preparing to make his exit."

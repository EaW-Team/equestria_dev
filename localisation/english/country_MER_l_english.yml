MER_POLITICS_GENEVIEVE_DESC:0 "#TODO §YBorn:§! 969\n\n§YBiography:§! \n\n§YPortrait by:§! §SScroup§!"
MER_POLITICS_OEUF_DESC:0 "#TODO"
MER_POLITICS_FACILIER_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! April 14th, 978\n\n§YBiography:§! Born the son of a fishmonger and a shipyard worker, life was not set to be easy for young Facilier. With little wealth to his family name, the young colt often turned his attention outward: to the sea, and whatever laid beyond. Noveau Aquila was a bustling port at the time, and Facilier's attention was often fixated on the stories the sailors brought with them. More crucially, they often spoke of the harsh working conditions faced by those who made their living on the seas. In an effort to put the stories of these unsung heroes to paper, Facilier would leave home and seek out likeminded individuals, travelling far and wide with little but his few belongings. \n\nFor all his effort, the stories he sought would lead him to the young Socialist Republic of Stalliongrad, where he would decide to embark upon an ideological safari to other regions in and around Equestria harboring communist sympathies. However, after spending much time within Coltjun revolutionary circles in Baltimare, he would instead leave for Les Meridiennes, influenced by his heritage and confident in their revolutionary potential. \n\nWith little more than his meagre possessions and no connections in the area, Facilier would eventually meet up with Mama Ruby, working his way through the ranks and building the PKM up to be the true party of the people. With the end of Vivienne's brief rule on the isles, they now seek to transform the former colony into an independent state with its own bright future."

MER_economic_reform_hearings:0 "Economic Revitalization Hearings"
MER_economic_reform_hearings_desc:0 "Be it Saddle Arabian nobles or Aquileian royalty, Equestrian visitors or zebra wanderers, everycreature has fondly spoken of our little islands and their natural beauty. Very few would say, however, that the Meridiennes are economically viable. Something must be done to reverse this trend, to give our home a niche of its own."
MER_reduce_economic_reliance:0 "Pursue Economic Autonomy"
MER_reduce_economic_reliance_desc:0 "Production of goods and material is sparse and underdeveloped: most is made to satisfy the local needs, while anything luxurious is imported from the Aquileian mainland and our other trading partners. While we cannot expect the Meridiennes to entirely self sufficient, improving the quality of products and expanding existing factories would go a long way towards reversing the downward trend."
MER_develop_second_port:0 "Develop Cocoyer"
MER_develop_second_port_desc:0 "Port Giselda is where all the rustic splendour of the Meridiennes can be fully appreciated. Our culture, our historical landmarks, the bustling docks full of goods and creatures from around the world! However, it is unwise to put all of our eggs in one basket, as the pony expression goes. Promoting the development of Cocoyer would encourage immigration towards the lesser appreciated southern islands."
MER_diversify_exports:0 "Diversify Our Exports"
MER_diversify_exports_desc:0 "What little is shipped abroad can be summed up in two items: rubber and exotic fruit, sold for a pittance. We simply cannot compete with larger and more established nations, who not only export more, but better quality goods too. The first step towards breaking this mold is the expansion of an iron deposit in Cocoyer. It can be refined into steel, a decently valued commodity."
MER_fight_stagnation:0 "Prevent A Recession"
MER_fight_stagnation_desc:0 "The economic situation is slowly becoming untenable. With less and less labour available for locals, there is a growing number of creatures that is able to work, but there is simply no room for them. Idle thoughts lead to either emigration or dangerous sentiments. It cannot be fixed over a day, but large scale (for our size) public projects should temporarily alleviate the problem."
MER_harmonist_solution:0 "The Progressive Method"
MER_harmonist_solution_desc:0 "What connects the few settlements on our islands is mostly dirt trails, with a few cobblestone roads dating to ages past. The automobile has yet to make a large breakthrough, mostly seen as a strange frivolity from the mainland. But the march of progress cannot be avoided, and the civil engineers affilated with PKM and PPH have presented a plan that would correct our lack of infrastructure."
MER_traditionalist_solution:0 "The Traditionalists' Argument"
MER_traditionalist_solution_desc:0 "What connects the few settlements on our islands is mostly dirt trails, with a few cobblestone roads dating to ages past. The local cream of the crop wishes to see development similar to the norm of great cities like Vyzima, Aquila or Pelis. To achieve that, certain ideas like labour laws or fair payment should be put aside in the pursuit of progress."
MER_education_reforms:0 "Renovate the University"
MER_education_reforms_desc:0 "The University of Port Giselda, established over a century ago, has never been particularly notable in the quality of its lessons, or the amount of options available for enterprising students. As innovation comes from our best and brightest, we should invest in this institution, bring over more teachers from the mainland. Surely, the expansion of the intellectual group should be one of our priorities."
MER_negotiate_subsidies:0 "Subsidise Key Industries"
MER_negotiate_subsidies_desc:0 "The Meridiennes' economic activity is divided between the fishing sector, rubber plantation owners, small scale tourist attractions and the meagre local production. None of them can be called reasonably successful, barely managing to stay afloat for various reasons. State intervention could and should lead to an economic growth, increasing our revenue and job opportunities for locals."
MER_encourage_intellectuals:0 "Encourage Higher Learning"
MER_encourage_intellectuals_desc:0 "According to recent census results, we've found that only a small minority of our population actively pursues intellectual careers. The stereotype of an islander interested in scarcely more than having a leisurely time could not be stronger, apparently. This minority only accounts for around 1% of our population. Increasing this percetage to 4 would be optimal, and we have ideas how to achieve that."
MER_stable_growth:0 "Stable Growth Achieved"
MER_stable_growth_desc:0 "Fair winds are blowing on our fair isles in recent times. Although the Meridiennes are far from achieving any sort of prosperity, a potential crisis has been averted, and it should be smooth sailing from now on. Perhaps, once the mainlanders hear about our recent improvements, they'll approve a higher budget for the colony?"
MER_letter_to_moriset:0 "Correspondence With The King"
MER_letter_to_moriset_desc:0 "It is the biannual occasion in which [MER.GetLeader] writes an official report to our Aquileian masters. More often than not, it consists mostly of droll tax reports and unsubtle demands for further funding, which would go relatively unnoticed. But for once, we have some actual good news to present to the King, and there's surely a reward waiting for us loyal subjects."

## Revolution (JER is monarchist) ##
MER_the_second_revolution_monarchy:0 "Aquileia In Flames"
MER_the_second_revolution_monarchy_desc:0 "Disaster! Horror! Outrage! Once again, the Ancien Regime is under threat as the revolting Republicans have risen up to reimpose their radical ideology on the mainland. Even if our islands are far from the troubles, the cracks will quickly start to form, should we hesitate. We must convene at once and quickly decide on the next course of action, before the situation grows out of control!"

MER_balance_shifts_moderate:0 "Balanced Priorities"
MER_balance_shifts_moderate_desc:0 "#TODO For as much as we are beholden to our overlord, our Governess is naturally torn between her home (and by extension her people) in the isles as well as the crown to whom she swears fealty. While refusing to aid the mainland would be both out of the question and suicidal, perhaps we can do so in a manner that won't break the bank and disgruntle the populace as much"

MER_elevate_voices_of_reason:0 "Elevate the Voices of Reason"
MER_elevate_voices_of_reason_desc:0 "#TODO will compare the popularity of the non-neutrality ideologies and effects will vary from there. A level-headed member from the relevant ideology will be the one to "

MER_raise_regional_militias:0 "Raise Rural Militias"
MER_raise_regional_militias_desc:0 "#TODO officializing some defense forces for our " 

MER_negotiate_with_warhawks:0 "#TODO Negotiate with Hawks"
MER_negotiate_with_warhawks_desc:0 "#TODO in order to return the economy to a more manageable state throughout and following this crisis, we will seek to implement sustainable practices to strike a balance between domestic and foreign needs. yadda yadda, the focus will basically involve making use of pacifist harmonists and isolationist nationalists to try to promote an inward focus."

MER_dig_in:0 "Dig In and Pray"
MER_dig_in_desc:0 "#TODO We dont't really know WHAT to expect. You can never be too careful, especially in a position as vulnerable as ours, far away from the protection of our currently preoccupied liege. We will reinforce our cities by restoring age-old defenses and bolstering them with new ones"

MER_buff_ourselves:0 "#TODO buff our attack - greedy"
MER_buff_ourselves_desc:0 "#TODO we will strive to distinguish ourselves on the battlefield, demonstrating our capacity for independent military initiatives. rather than adopting the aquileian doctrine of defense, we shall play to our own strengths and strike the enemy where they are weak"

MER_buff_aquileia:0 "#TODO buff JER defense - supportive"
MER_buff_aquileia_desc:0 "#TODO we will opt to take a more defensive approach. The situation is far too dire to warrant gambling everything on our own initiatives. It'd be far safer to sit back and support the kingdom's flank with everything we've got."

MER_detrimental_enthusiasm:0 "#TODO detrimental enthusiasm"
MER_detrimental_enthusiasm_desc:0 "#TODO an event about an idiot appointee making the mistake of directing military production directly towards Aquileia in exchange for some equipment"

MER_patriotic_speech:0 "#TODO patriotic speech"
MER_patriotic_speech_desc:0 "#TODO The Governess' speech will probably scripted to vary based on sub-path"

MER_balance_shifts_radical:0 "Take Action"
MER_balance_shifts_radical_desc:0 "As far as we are from the mainland, we cannot just simply lay idly on our laurels while good Aquileians are fighting for what's right. The isles have always been devoted subjects of the Crown, and within each of our hearts (those harbouring dissident thoughts will be prosecuted) is an earnest desire to prove ourselves. We must take a stand, for the King and proud Aquileia!"

MER_send_help:0 "#TODO initial volunteers"
MER_send_help_desc:0 "#TODO decision to send manpower"

MER_arms_shipments:0 "Send Weapon Shipments"
MER_arms_shipments_desc:0 "The Meridiennes maintain a miniscule arms industry, intended completely for local purposes of keeping order. We have not seen battles in quite a while, and as a result, a considerable stockpile of admittedly dated firearms has grown over the past years. Instead of rusting in armouries, we should send everything we can spare to our friends at the mainland. Every little bit helps, and we must prove ourselves."

MER_deepen_involvement:0 "Deepen Involvement"
MER_deepen_involvement_desc:0 ""

MER_send_actual_volunteers:0 "Send Volunteers"
MER_send_actual_volunteers_desc:0 "The blood of the patriots calls to action! Many creatures have demanded recently to be sent to battle, and their number has grown to a worrying amount. If we do not approve their requests, they could very well incite riots with their behaviour. Thus it is settled: anycreature willing to die for King and Aquileia will be given passage to the mainland, with enough gear to sustain themselves in combat."

MER_join_the_fray:0 "#TODO join the fray"
MER_join_the_fray_desc:0 "#TODO"

MER_wait_it_out:0 "With Bated Breaths, We Watched"
MER_wait_it_out_desc:0 ""We've done all that we could, distant as we are, leaving us only to wait and listen for any news from the mainland. Information will take days to arrive, but I will pray for the King's success in combating these filthy insurgents. Aquileia has the Discrets; she needs no 'president' or 'republic'.""

### Loyalist Focus Tree ###
###########################

MER_steady_as_she_goes:0 "Steady As She Goes"
MER_steady_as_she_goes_desc:0 "As expected, the filthy Republican rabble has been crushed and prevented from restoring their most ignoble ideals. The populace is content knowing that further insecurities will not plague our fair islands, but much work remains to be done in the service for the Crown."

################
### Military ###
################

MER_reform_colonial_military:0 "Reform the Colonial Military"
MER_reform_colonial_military_desc:0 "For many years, the islands of Meridiennes have maintained what could be quaintly called, an informal militia. There was never a need for any sort of military development, owing to the protection from the mainland. But now we live in troubled times, where certainties are breaking down. With the surplus raised from the economical reform, we can invest into restructuring our armed forces."
MER_fighter_research:0 "Beginnings of an Airforce"
MER_fighter_research_desc:0 "Although far from large landmasses, the position of our islands has a certain benefit, according to some radical thinkers. As airplanes are becoming more and more prominent in conflicts, they could be utilised to effectively protect our home. What good is the greatest fleet in the world, if it can't reach its destination? We must look into acquiring this knowledge for our benefit."
MER_prioritize_range:0 "Prioritize Long-Range Air Operations"
MER_prioritize_range_desc:0 "The imported airplanes have proven their worth, and the pilots have successfully completed various trial runs. However, the range of these machines is insufficient for any sort of wider operations, that aren't confined to our homelands. Our future designs will have to made in mind to minimise this drawback: grant them a further reach, cut down on the unnecessary excess."
MER_torpedo_bomber_primacy:0 "Torpedo Bomber Primacy"
MER_torpedo_bomber_primacy_desc:0 "It would seem that the wind is blowing in an unfavourable direction for warships these days, not many can successfully resist an aerial attack without support from their own aviation. With that in mind, we've drawn up plans for our first aircraft specialised in striking targets rather than opposing planes - a long range bomber dedicated for naval assaults."
MER_air_doctrine_research:0 "Belle-Île School of Aerial Warfare"
MER_air_doctrine_research_desc:0 "As with any new innovation, the usage of airplanes must be put to a certain standard. To elaborate, it means that they should operate in a combined arms styled approach with the other branches of our armed forces, as well as determining a specialisation of our aerial doctrine. Plans might quickly fall apart, but good planning will carry us a long way."
MER_bomber_research:0 "Bomber Advancements"
MER_bomber_research_desc:0 "The naval bomber project has given satisfying results, and with the lessons learned, we can redesign the chassis to fit a more localised approach for bombing missions. Even though currently the only thing in strike range are remote islands with practice targets for our new pilots, perhaps someday the mainland will require our aid, and the colonial airforce shall be ready to respond."
MER_arms_industry:0 "Jumpstart Our Arms Industry"
MER_arms_industry_desc:0 "If there is anything that's always missing, it would be firearms and supplies. With the planned expansion of the colonial forces, current production is unsatisfying and would not be able to keep up with the demand, especially if a conflict arises. The local economy will be bolstered with the expansion of our factories and workshops, all in service to the good crown of Aquileia."
MER_modernize_infantry_equipment:0 "Infantry Kit Innovations"
MER_modernize_infantry_equipment_desc:0 "Rifle and ammunition, certainly the most basic things any soldier needs. As war becomes ever more deadly, there is an even greater need to stay ahead of our rivals: more accurate weaponry, additional tools for the field and removing obsolete equipment from our armouries. The armed forces will certainly take greater pride in their service, if they possess the best we can give."
MER_CAS_research:0 "Dive Bomber Modernisation"
MER_CAS_research_desc:0 "Bombing is certainly effective in causing untold amounts of devastation, but certain situations require more finesse and restraint. It would do us little good if an aerial strike on the battlefield ends up causing friendly fire, which is why there is a need for a specialised aircraft that can remove such a risk, while remaining effective in achieving objectives."
MER_pridean_officers:0 "Hire Pridean Generals"
MER_pridean_officers_desc:0 "Us proud patriots are not lacking in enthusiasm when it comes to serving the Aquileian crown, but we cannot do everything on our own. The remoteness of these isles means there are few who can call themselves veterans or innovators in military matters, thus arises a need to acquire the services of such individuals from the mainland. Quality cooperation is sure to follow."
MER_infantry_equipment_standardization:0 "Standardise Infantry Equipment Designs"
MER_infantry_equipment_standardization_desc:0 "Centuries of industrial progress has taught the world a simple fact: uniformity in the parts of any machine means that it can be assembled easily. By making identical parts within a fine tolerance, identical machines can be built from any mixture of those parts. Particularly useful for the military, cutting down on repair costs for almost any equipment."
MER_marine_capabilities:0 "Elite Hippogriff Marines"
MER_marine_capabilities_desc:0 "Out of many races that dot this world, the hippogriffs are rightfully considered to be more adept when it comes to handling water. Given our position, amphibious assaults are certainly going to be required at some point, thus it pays to be prepared for the possibility. The colonial marines shall be a point of pride for the nation, whatever race they may be."
MER_artillery_modernization:0 "Revamped Ordinance Designs"
MER_artillery_modernization_desc:0 "Artillery has been a mainstay of any ground force ever since its inception, and the primary way to counter an opposing force is with our own. Numbers, however, aren't the solution for everything. Efficiency is the key, such as improved training for artillery crews, advanced percussion shells, or even hydraulic recoil mechanisms that greatly improve accuracy."
MER_support_companies:0 "Support Company Proliferation"
MER_support_companies_desc:0 "Combat has evolved a long time ago from the heroics of a single warrior, it is now a dedicated team effort. Each works on their own in achieving their objective, but as a part of a whole, larger operation. To this end, support companies are required: soldiers to handle bridge building, supply transport, taking care of the wounded, and more. Without support, even the greatest force will fail."
MER_naval_industry_expansion:0 "Expand Our Naval Industry"
MER_naval_industry_expansion_desc:0 "The Meridiennes have always had a plentitude of dockyards, ports, wharves, fisheries and other aspects of naval production, but recent developments have led us to assume that the current industry is insufficient for building more advanced vessels. The locals will bemoan the devastation of shores and beaches, but this is more important than aesthetics."
MER_submarine_advancements:0 "Wolfpack Advancements"
MER_submarine_advancements_desc:0 "It would be foolhardy to assume we could build even one battleship or similar warship in time for a conflict, not to mention it would probably become obsolete on completion. Thus it seems natural to specialise in submarines, to harry and waylay merchant convoys, and other undefended ships. More importantly, they can be assembled far quicker, making losses manageable."
MER_invasion_transports:0 "Improved Transport Designs"
MER_invasion_transports_desc:0 "Warships can be temporarily given the order to transport soldiers, but their cramped space makes difficult to move a large quantity, or across a longer time period. What is needed are dedicated vessels for the job, alongside landing barges that will assist in assaulting coasts and shores."
MER_moar_dockyard_expansion:0 "Shipyard Work Quotas"
MER_moar_dockyard_expansion_desc:0 "Although the naval industry has substantionally grown in recent times, production still remains at unsatisfying levels. We have little choice but to push directives for increasing productivity, first through promises of rewards, later by enforcing punishments should deadlines be ignored. All for the good of the nation, of course."
MER_destroyer_advancements:0 "Anti-Submarine Efforts"
MER_destroyer_advancements_desc:0 "The island nation relies heavily on imports from abroad, lest crucial materials run into a shortage when it is most needed. To patrol the coasts of Meridiennes, and report on any suspicious activities from would-be raiders, destroyers are needed to fulfil that role. Cheap, adaptable and quick, much roles can be satisfied with their presence."
MER_cruiser_advancements:0 "Workhorse Theorem"
MER_cruiser_advancements_desc:0 "Owing to our restricted naval industry, the largest warships that can be feasibly built belong to the cruiser class. Sturdy and armed to withstand devastating battles, yet quick enough to act as an escort for more vulnerable vessels. It is certain that the locals will be awed, once the first is launched from the shipyards."
MER_doctrine_of_support:0 "Small Contribution, Large Impact"
MER_doctrine_of_support_desc:0 "We have never claimed to be on the same level as any province on the mainland, but our dedicated support shall not go unnoticed in Aquila. By setting aside resources and equipment for our overlord, we shall prove ourselves worthy of the Crown's favour, while maintaining a certain level of autonomy for ourselves."

MER_a_meeting_with_the_queen:0 "A Meeting With The Queen"
MER_a_meeting_with_the_queen_desc:0 "It is a new dawn in Aquileia, just as it can be here. As good subjects of the Crown, we shall request some of the new Queen's time in order to hear her plans for our bright future."
MER_choose_MPA:0 "Favour The Nationalists"
MER_choose_MPA_desc:0 "Unlike those bleeding hearts in the PPH, only the most loyal members of the Queen's Party should help to lead her proposed reforms to the administration. We can ill-afford indecision or treason, and thus the only candidates are those who love our fair nation above all else."
MER_sideline_PPH:0 "Reassure The Traditionalists"
MER_sideline_PPH_desc:0 "Too many traditionalists have reservations about the path we have chosen, but they can be made to understand that the reformation we need is not mutually-exclusive with the life they know. In fact, the two are inseparable."
MER_strengthen_monarchists:0 "Strengthen The Monarchists"
MER_strengthen_monarchists_desc:0 "It is above all the monarchists of our nation who can lead us into our Queen's future. When it is possible, they should be granted more power within the legal system to help build our path forward."
MER_MPA_auxiliaries_idea:0 "MPA Youth Auxiliaries"
MER_MPA_auxiliaries_idea_desc:0 "The next generation will also need leaders and soldiers, and so we shall form a youth's scouting group to let our children learn the skills to navigate our island nation - and learn on their own to appreciate its beauty. In addition, the fostered feelings of camaraderie will serve them in the future, once they become politically active."
MER_disperse_harmonist_support:0 "Erode Harmonist Support Base"
MER_disperse_harmonist_support_desc:0 "Whether they're treasonous or merely incompetent in their well-meaning, the Harmonists of the nation will eventually complain about something we must do, and probably praise their own superior morals into the grave they dug for themselves. To start chipping away at them now would make sense. #TODO rewrite to have a less hostile tone towards the harmonists. "
MER_discourage_progressive_assembly:0 "Discourage Progressive Assembly #TODO - more creative name"
MER_discourage_progressive_assembly_desc:0 "The Progressive Assembly and similar groups have served their purpose well, but they're filled with politicians who are downright decrepit! It's practically a country club for politicians. Sidelining them a bit would make just about everything easier, and relieve the pressure on our ears. #TODO - the progressive assembly is not really a defined group, there are merely progressive advisors and their affiliated regional authorities"
MER_token_reforms:0 "Token Reforms"
MER_token_reforms_desc:0 "Although the systems as they currently exist are perfectly fine, there are some places they could be better. Not much better, but there's no reason to turn down small improvements on what we have. Plus, it would let many of the other political groups pretend we care what they think."
MER_MPA_position_secured:0 "The MPA Triumphant"
MER_MPA_position_secured_desc:0 "The true and righteous way of Aquileia and her Queen has proven its worth yet again on our fair shores, and now we may do as we need to in order to secure prosperity for the future. Under a distant yet firm hand, the kinds under our banner can each fulfil their role in the years to come in their own way."
MER_model_colony:0 "A Model Colony"
MER_model_colony_desc:0 "Among the annals of history, few colonies have ever had the stability, the prosperity, and the loyalty that we now have. This is thanks in no small part to our glorious Queen, but also to our governor and to all of our patriots who have worked hard to make this dream into reality."
MER_renovate_political_system:0 "Renovate The Colonial Administration"
MER_renovate_political_system_desc:0 "The system of districts and polities currently in place is not ideal. The inefficiency is one thing, but even worse is that it's letting some truly virulent figures into the body politic. They've got to go, and some creative redistricting and lawmaking will fix that tout de suite."
MER_stamp_out_communism:0 "Root Out Communist Sympathizers"
MER_stamp_out_communism_desc:0 "While the MPA and PPH disagree on many things, one point they both find troublingly apparent is that the PKM is, in spite of their origins as a charitable religious party, nominally infected with surreptitious communists. If we're to ensure we stay in the Queen's good graces, we're gonna have to concern ourselves with their empty promises."
MER_defang_communism:0 "Defang The PKM"
MER_defang_communism_desc:0 "As much as we would like to simply root out the filth hiding amongst the PKM from the government institutions, our limited and localized democracy is a point of pride for many citizens, and what could be more undemocratic than removing politicians for what they MIGHT believe? Instead, we'll have controlled opposition simply appropriate many PKM policies and drive them toward irrelevancy."
MER_strengthen_the_administration:0 "Rein In The Center"
MER_strengthen_the_administration_desc:0 "The nation's political centre is not entirely beholden to a single party, and is often split among regional and independent groups. If given the opportunity, however, many of them would gladly come under the umbrella in order to be part of a bigger political machine."
MER_choose_PPH:0 "Favour the Harmonists"
MER_choose_PPH_desc:0 "Counter to what the nationalists within the MPA might have us believe, the abandonment of our traditional methods of governance need not be a permanent affair. While [FROM.GetLeader] seems to be very receptive towards the idea of reinstating and further developing our system of rule once all is said and done, that is not enough to win her over fully. If she is to go through with it, she will need to be swayed..."
MER_welfare_programs:0 "Edict of Universal Medicine"
MER_welfare_programs_desc:0 "We have many things in great numbers. Gentle beaches, favourable winds, exotic animals, and tropical diseases number among them. A national system of hospitals and community-level medicine distribution can greatly lessen the dangers of the latter two. Should the situation occur, these institutions could be rapidly converted to serve the armed forces, prioritising healthcare to our gallant soldiers."
MER_bolster_monarchist_support:0 "Bolster Monarchist Support"
MER_bolster_monarchist_support_desc:0 "Our goal is not at all the abolition of the monarchy or the expansion of the democracy. It is merely a kinder sustainable governance. With some honest dialogue and maybe a few favours, at least a few of the more liberal-minded members among them can be made to see things our way."
MER_sideline_MPA:0 "Sideline The MPA"
MER_sideline_MPA_desc:0 "The MPA is, for the most part, too invested in the exact nature of the monarchic institution for the good of itself, to say nothing of the nation as a whole. Luckily, we came prepared, and there are ways to keep them at a distance from the part of the state where things happen."
MER_discourage_far_right_assembly:0 "Arrest Far-Right Extremists"
MER_discourage_far_right_assembly_desc:0 "As with any modern nation-state, we have an oddball collection of ultranationalists, theocrats, and general malcontents who are frankly a danger to everyone around them whenever there are no children on their lawn to yell at. A few high-profile arrests and a few well-placed ones on top should knock them down a peg."
MER_harmonic_nationalism:0 "Harmonic Nationalism"
MER_harmonic_nationalism_desc:0 "It is said that, on a sinking ship, you place the life preserver over your own head before helping those around you. Though we may desire to help the world be a kinder and more prosperous place, we must first ensure that we ourselves are kind and prosperous, or else we would be nothing but a drag, a beggar, and a waste of our potential."
MER_placate_remaining_MPA:0 "Placate Remaining MPA"
MER_placate_remaining_MPA_desc:0 "While we have all but ensured that our home will never give rise to a revolution of its own, many within the PPH worry that the MPA, should we fail to reassure them, could become a hotbed of anti-government sentiment, especially given our recent actions against them. If we wish to ensure that these measures remain temporary, we will need to reconcile with them."

MER_continue_the_reforms:0 "Finish The Reforms"
MER_continue_the_reforms_desc:0 "The colonial administration has done an excellent job preventing the islands from falling into an economic slump, much like the majority of Griffonia in recent times. There are a few token improvements left to carry out to maintain a stable growth, so let's not rest and call it a done deal just yet."
MER_civ_industry:0 "Expand Domestic Industrial Sectors"
MER_civ_industry_desc:0 "The simple basics of any economic thought: growth and profit pave the way for further growth and profit. As the populace is slowly gaining wealthier, they're buying more products, giving producers a return on their investment and more. A further development in our industries for the production of everything a creature might need in their daily life is in order."
MER_more_development_projects:0 "Additional Development Projects"
MER_more_development_projects_desc:0 "There are many deals, designs, enterprises or plans the government can pursue, but as always, there are not enough funds or resources for everything. Establishing a formal procedure for economic proposals, which the colonial administration can then review and decide on its viability should ensure that only the most serious motions reach the end."
MER_society_development_modernized:0 "Le Parc Industriel De Port Giselda"
MER_society_development_modernized_desc:0 "Centralisation and consolidation of industry can only serve towards increasing efficiency and productivity. Port Giselda is already home to a majority of the Meridiennes' economic activity, but there is always room for additional improvement. Setting aside an area dedicated for industrialisation, away from urban centres, shall further our endeavours."
MER_expand_giselda_university:0 "Expand Campus Grounds"
MER_expand_giselda_university_desc:0 "With the recent expansion of the Port Giselda University, interest has raised to a degree where we simply cannot accomodate any more students near the area! It would seem that good news travel far, and while we certainly won't end up in an Equestrian newspaper detailing on best education facilities, we can still increase the budget for our brighter future."
MER_electronics_research:0 "Electronical Ingenuity"
MER_electronics_research_desc:0 "The guiding trend for technology these days is that it is growing ever more efficient, yet compact and smaller. Such is the case especially in the field of electronics, where a claw sized contraption can guide the actions of a machine that is far larger in size. Further development in this area could lead to a breakthrough in emerging fields of science."
MER_fuel_industry:0 "The Les Abondantes Fuel Refinery"
MER_fuel_industry_desc:0 "An island chain like ours needs fuel to avoid becoming isolated from the wider world, as transportation grinds to a halt because there's simply none of it left. Although oil remains at somewhat affordable prices for the time being, it will certainly increase as demand picks up globally, and we should establish a certain amount of self-sufficiency in this regard."
MER_summer_islands_purchase:0 "Purchase The Summer Islands"
MER_summer_islands_purchase_desc:0 "To the northwest lie the Summer Islands, named such for their particular charm during the warm season. Although they've never been officially a part of the Meridiennes, they are culturally similar enough to us, not to mention less than three day's distance by ship. Surely, their owners would be interested in an mutually amicable exchange?"
MER_more_domestic_companies:0 "Further Investments In Domestic Industry"
MER_more_domestic_companies_desc:0 "Business is booming, as the saying goes, but not everycreature is destined to achieve success in their ventures. The government can mitigate these failures to some degree, by offering subsidies, publish advice regarding corporation laws, provide efficient advertising and more. We simply expect a small return on our investments, however."
MER_invite_aquileian_companies:0 "Invite More Mainland Companies"
MER_invite_aquileian_companies_desc:0 "There are few things corporations enjoy, but one of them are low operation costs. We cannot do everything on our own, local businesses cannot satisfy the needs of the state. Thus, by offering mainland companies several benefits in exchange for opening a branch on the isles, we can gain their expertise and knowledge for little investment."
MER_resource_prospects:0 "Resource Prospects"
MER_resource_prospects_desc:0 "The Meridiennes can't be called large islands by any means, but much of the interior remains both sparsely populated and explored in terms of resource exploitation. This was primarily because of the expenses involved, but now that technology has reduced these costs to an appreciable degree, we can attempt to find out if anything valuable lies beneath the ground."
MER_machine_tools_research:0 "Industrial R&D Grants"
MER_machine_tools_research_desc:0 "Problems require a solution, and that's where innovation shines brightest, especially when enticed with a generous reward. If we were to collect and list the most common woes the industrial sector is facing, those with the drive and ideas to offer improvements will certainly follow suit."
MER_eradicate_poverty:0 "Eradicate Poverty"
MER_eradicate_poverty_desc:0 "Despite our efforts, there are still a few places where the standard of living is unacceptably low. Idleness and lack of money drive creatures to undesirable thoughts, after all. By hiring unemployed locals to do government-sponsored light infrastructure projects, paid for by taxing the businesses which later arrive to take advantage of it, we can solve even that."
MER_improved_inter_island_shipping:0 "Improved Inter-Island Shipping Routes"
MER_improved_inter_island_shipping_desc:0 "As development increases, so does the need to transport resources and creatures between our islands, and even beyond them. However, the civilian transportation sector is not what could be called efficient by any means, both in scheduling and the quality of their vessels. Alleviating these hindrances should help tremendously for the local economy."
MER_tourism_industry:0 "Makings Of A Tourist Economy"
MER_tourism_industry_desc:0 "With most of the local problems solved or in the process of such, we can now turn our sights to exploiting the islands' most appealing quality. Namely, the development of a sector based around attracting creatures from around the world to come here and spend their money! It can certainly be more profitable than any traditional industry we might establish here."
MER_hemp_industry:0 "Develop Industrial-Grade Hemp"
MER_hemp_industry_desc:0 ""Whatever your misgivings about this 'weed' are, there are no doubts that it is quite practical. Paper, food, textiles, or even personal enjoyment, I've heard, hemp can be utilised far more effectively than just letting it rot!"\n\n- Trot Barley, Minister of Agriculture"
MER_plantations:0 "Subsidise the Plantations"
MER_plantations_desc:0 "From crops to rubber, the island plantations provide a great deal of resources that can be further refined in the production process. They haven't quite kept up with the times, with many reporting very low profit margins or worse. To prevent a source of labour from going under, we shall give a little push to ensure they stay competitive in this day and age, for the good of the state."
MER_pleasure_colony:0 "The Crown Jewel"
MER_pleasure_colony_desc:0 "We've been through turbulent times, and we've invested a great deal of effort, but the Meridiennes of today can hardly be compared to those from a decade ago. Modern infrastructure, industry and education have been successfully laid down, and now we reap the benefits of our success. Whoever decides to visit our little corner of the world, will leave greatly impressed."

Their most significant resource is a mid-sized port, and most of the islanders are employed in maintaining it.

If we are to wrap this campaign up quickly, we must be ready to face the harsh terrains ahead."
MER_hillpony_mission:0 "Into The Hills"

MER_eastern_mission:0 "Manoeuvers In The East"
MER_eastern_mission_desc:0 "The Griffonian Empire's eastern reaches were an odd place. Their terrain was largely plains and forests, with just enough mountains and rivers to make for some odd boundaries. The armies there are not particularly strong, but their lands are vast and easily defenden in spite of that. The corollary: we can often just run right past them, and should plan for it."
MER_southern_mission:0 "Divide And Conquer"

While this has its benefits and has helped to foster healthy trade relations with the Crown, we have little ability to produce any refined goods domestically. As a result, local production has stagnated and unemployment is rising, owing to an uncompetitive market.

As a result, local production has stagnated and unemployment is rising, owing to an uncompetitive market.\n\nHowever, recent reforms have greatly reduced the mainland dependency.

MER_standardized_gun_designs:0 "The [MER.GetAdjective] Standard"
MER_standardized_gun_designs_desc:0 "To reduce the reliance on foreign imports, which are often of dubious, varying quality, we've gathered the attention of local gunsmiths and arsenals.

MER_dockyard_industry_expansion:0 "Efficient Shipyards"
MER_dockyard_industry_expansion_desc:0 "For too long, the naval industry has been beset with a chronic failure of adherence to deadlines, to say the least about the uninspired workforce and corrupt management.

MER_defanging_communism_desc:0 "Socialist ideas have always been a scourge for any well behaving citizen, inciting subversive and disobedient thoughts. However, it would be rather unpopular to arrest the leadership of the PKM, which is why we've settled for an alternative approach: picking apart their ideology to take what we were going to implement anyway, quietly discard the rest.

Many a creature enjoys the sight of clear skies and shining seas, far from the worries of their everyday life.

## Starting Admirals 
MER_soup_defaux:0 "Soup Defaux"
MER_soup_defaux_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 970\n\n§YBiography:§! In the time of the first Aquileian Counterrevolution, Albert Berthelot and his Monarchists drew in every able-bodied creature they could to fight and die for the Discret Restoration, and of all those who went from worthlessness to importance through their role in the conflict, few have given as much as Soup Defaux.\nBorn to a low-class Pridean family, Defaux joined the navy as a deck-swabber on the nation’s flagship. By all accounts, he did this just fine, yet on a terrible day in 985, when the city of Pridea burned and Defaux was only 15, he caught the eye of Dennis “The Menace” Discret. The captain noticed the sailor, barely more than a child, and stuffed him into the closet housing a casemate cannon with orders to keep loading shells until told otherwise. And Defaux did this, first for an hour, then three, then six, until Pridea was rubble.\nSupposedly, he was scorched black when he was allowed out, and it may not have only been on the outside. He was very different when he came out, and the loss of his parents in the destruction only made it worse. Regardless, having been noticed by Dennis, he was able to become a career officer and begin climbing through the ranks. He ended the war as a Junior Lieutenant and stayed in the navy.\nThen, a few years later, he beat one Lieutenant Smoke, a fellow officer, to death in a dispute. It was found that he was unable to pass a psychological evaluation. For his years of faithful service, Dennis interceded in his life one last time and managed to get him promoted to Admiral – at the cost of being sent to Les Meridiennes for the rest of his life, likely to never see any combat or adventure ever again.\nIt was fine by him. Being a sailor was never his dream. But sometimes, the cannons are all firing at full speed, and explosions sound off a distant coast, and the tension seems to fade from his muscles. \n§YPortrait by:§! §GRyanBoi§!"

meridiennes_history.2.d:0 "#TODO Starting in 650, just a year after Coltlumbus established New Mareland, many of the islands in the Canteribbean found themselves being split between various powers. From small scale Sicameonese trading posts in the east, Equestrians in the north, and some saddle arabian and hippogriffian crap in the south, the natives that had inhabited the isles for centuries welcomed many to their home islands, at times even to their detriment. Around the year 665, finding themselves being increasingly surrounded on all sides by exploring powers, the main three tribal nations on what is now Belle-Île, having always preferred diplomacy with one another over warfare, sought to unify themselves into a cohesive trade kingdom. The end result, despite being less cohesive than they would have liked, was eventually agreed upon and in early 670, the Confederation of the Isle was born."

Overseas guns and cannons are now finding their way to the claws and hooves of our fighters across the front.\n\nThis is not a terribly large amount of support for a nation as industrialized and large as ours, especially once it's split between us and the other loyalist regions, but it is far more than nothing, and for the small islands it must be a tremendous burden upon their military industry. After this rebellion is dealth with and the traitors are dead or exiled, we will have to look into some method of repaying the small island nation for their spirited assistance."

He's not even old enough to smoke yet."\n\nLeclerc pulled the box the rest of the way onto the truck's bed and sighed with exertion. "So? The Archon is so old that he remembers the youthful years of your mother. A child Grover the Sixth may be, but a stiff wind could defeat that walking antique." He took a moment to catch his breath from the hot sun. "Oh, and we have an audience now." He continued, pointing to a group of four or so Zebra mares in army uniforms and Les Meridiennes patches who were watching.\n\n"By blue, this war has brought out the strangest folks." Jean replied before being directed to the next box. He wrapped his claws around it, but it didn't budge when he tried to lift it. After a moment of thought, he took off his military shirt and set it aside, revealing a dark tank top underneath.\n\nA chorus of cheers and whistles rose from the Zebras. It only rose in intensity as he strained to pick up the large crate and pitch it up so that his companion could pull it onto the bed. When he could finally take his claws off of it without fear of it falling off, one of the Zebras called out "Meet us out back and we'll show you how to lift, little boy!", causing the others to cheer and holler. It was especially odd since they seemed to be shorter than he was.\n\nJean felt vaguely uncomfortable, but when he looked to Leclerc for help, the latter just muttered "lucky bastard" under his breath. Normally, looking good in a uniform was one of the perks of military life, but this was not how Jean had expected it to go."

Joining the ships carrying vital war materials and trade goods to our docks are now colonial vessels bearing more soldiers for the front, and those who have been sent into battle are currently proving themselves equal to our normal fighters, although they often have strange customs.\n\nSadly, the amount of fighters sent has been split between us and all of the other loyalists, and the colony is not a large or populous nation to begin with, so the overal effect for us is small. Still, this is a clear show of support and loyalty from the colony, and one which should not go unrewarded after our victory."

Now, many are awaiting trial and probable early release for poor health on charges of violating new anti-extremism laws put in place to make it harder for ultranationalists and other obnoxious groups to have undue sway over our politics.\n\nThere have been complaints about this. Numerous politicians of Aquileia have sent us a message on the subject which, in short, reads "We could hear their bones creaking when we sent them over. They couldn't possibly have been that much trouble." Another prominent critic was an MPA high-roller of many years, who gave a beautiful off-the-cuff treatise on the tyranny of the PPH to a few dozen of his supporters from the rocking chair on his front porch and then fell asleep. A few within our own party have also raised concerns about this unsubtle approach, but some time spent talking to arrestees convinced them that no harm was being done to our political sphere.\n\nThe effect is already clear.

#TODO - Rewrite slightly to make the politics make sense. Facilier himself is communist, but not openly. The PKM at the start had been skirting the very edges of what they're allowed to get away with by presenting their most "extreme" reforms as being religious in nature, but by this point, Vivienne has clued in on it already and has told Genevieve about it.

meridiennes_scripted.1.d_MPA:0 "As the results of the final vote of the day were announced and the Colonial Assembly's members all stood up to go home, Facilier Beauxregard sat still in his seat, seething silently. The last vote was on the subject of communism, specifically regarding many of the more extreme ideals - and therefore his career - and the Assembly, in a characteristic show of liberalism, had chosen to ban it - and therefore him - from the public. It was insanity, a transparent attempt to grab power for the powerful and add another layer of legal defense to keep the workers down.\n\nBut what had him really angry was that he just had to live with it. He had seen the projections, the voter turnouts, everything. Leftism was just not as popular these days, and revolutionary thought even less so. He couldn't even remove this corrupt legislature from its precious hall if all of his revolutionary comrades were standing just outside, and the attempt coming out to anything besides a further repression was simply impossible.\n\nHe joined the stream of exiting politicians as he decided that the only thing to do was to flee and bide his time as he waited for things to change. One day this tyrannical oligarchy would be revealed to all, then he could have his revolution.\n\nIn his blinding anger, he suddenly bumped into a MPA delegate in front of him who had voted in favor. The word "prick" was muttered, followed by a venemous glare from the old stallion, but Beauxregard was not in a position to get into a fight. He knew when he wasn't welcome anymore, and if the stare he was getting from the MPA youth scoutmaster across the street was anything to go by, he'd best start preparing to make his exit."

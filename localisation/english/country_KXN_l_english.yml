KXN_Matriarch_Cult_desc_tt_A:0 "The Matriarch Superior is the voice of Concord; She cannot be fallible under any circumstances. The same cannot be said for the treacherous advisors that surround Her, which are the culprits behind the continued ruin and decrepitude of kirinkind. Heed not their lies and the deluded mystics who claim to be representing the Way of Fire: once their poisonous influence is removed, the Matriarch will be free to guide us properly."
KXN_Matriarch_Cult_desc_tt_B:0 "The Matriarch Superior is the voice of Concord; She cannot be fallible under any circumstances; Her word, the eternal law. To question Her is heresy, and to resist Her will is to resist Concord. Yet She was shackled by traitors — weaklings and cowards who entrapped Her in their web of lies, poisoning Her ears against Her true children.\n\nThe Lan Kir have swept aside those vermin. The Militarchy's Banners have scoured the rot from Vermilion. The Matriarch now speaks with clarity, freed by the hooves and iron of the strong. Kirinity, rejoice! Your Matriarch has been restored to Her rightful glory. It is only through the purifying flame of the Lan Kir that Her Radiance may shine unclouded, and only through their fervour that the Way of Fire may burn pure once again."

### National Focuses ###
KXN_Focus_MILTARCH:0 "Keeping the Long Vigil"
KXN_Focus_MILTARCH_desc:0 "Many kirin would regard us as obsessed maniacs who have strayed far from Concord's grace. Yet it is them who live in poverty, ignorance and squalor, while the Lan Kir maintain the traditions that made kirinkind strong. Thus we must remain vigilant, vigilant and ever more vigilant: it is the only way the Matriarch will bestow upon us Her favour."
KXN_Focus_MILTARCH_1:0 "Observe the Equinox"
KXN_Focus_MILTARCH_1_desc:0 "Far from a mystery, the movement of celestial bodies is predictable and subject to natural laws. On particularly auspicious days, the stars provide us omens, which the learned kirin can interpret as either a portent or blessing. The upcoming equinox, where day and night are in perfect balance, shall reveal our destiny."
KXN_Focus_MILTARCH_2:0 "Rite of Kindling"
KXN_Focus_MILTARCH_2_desc:0 "Fire is as much of a purifying force as it is destructive. It drives away the heretical disease, and any collateral damage inflicted is a simple necessary sacrifice. As many Valiants perish one way or another, there are many more who will gladly take up this secret rite to further our cause."
KXN_Focus_MILTARCH_3:0 "Gauntlet of Fire" ## Knives and bullets can't pierce it. Bulletproof.
KXN_Focus_MILTARCH_3_desc:0 "To truly join the ranks of the Valiant Ten-Thousand, it is not as simple as knowing how to fight or kill. A Lan Kir must truly find balance between their Kirin and Nirik forms to prove themselves worthy of this title; they must go through a gauntlet of fire to prove themselves ready for the burden of protecting all Kirinity.\nThe weak will perish and the strong will thrive."

KXN_Focus_MILTARCH_4_tt:0 "Unlocks Focus: §YSmite Her Enemies§!."
KXN_Focus_AIRFORCE:0 "Muster the Aerostats"
KXN_Focus_AIRFORCE_desc:0 "Even here, we have heard of a brutal warlord far to the west, who embarked on a great conquest. Though he would meet his inglorious end soon enough, we have recognised his usage of lighter-than-air aircraft to be a viable strategic option. They are highly mobile and capable of carrying a great deal of equipment and kirin wherever needed."

KXN_Focus_AIRSHIP_1:0 "Nirik-Fired War Balloons"
KXN_Focus_AIRSHIP_1_desc:0 "While the aerostats are fairly inexpensive in upkeep, this quickly grows unsustainable as the fleet expands. Fuel and lifting gas do not come cheaply, but what does exist in great amount are fiercely devoted kirin. By utilising the nirik state to effectively provide an endless amount of energy, our airships will reach new heights of performance."
KXN_Focus_AIRSHIP_2:0 "Dirigible Gunships"
KXN_Focus_AIRSHIP_2_desc:0 "By expanding upon their design, these aerostats may truly become as warships of the skies. Our enemies may expect us to be out of our element while so high up; they will only recognize their grave mistake as they plummet to their end!"
KXN_Focus_AIRSHIP_3:0 "Aerostatic Artillery"
KXN_Focus_AIRSHIP_3_desc:0 "For many centuries, it has been understood that wars are won through a decisive application of firepower. There is certainly no shortage of artillery, but rough terrain greatly reduces its efficiency. Mounting such on our airships makes them almost invulnerable to retaliation, but certain adjustments will be required to ensure the recoil won't become a problem."

KXN_Focus_AIRPLANE_1:0 "Fixed-Wing Aerodynes"
KXN_Focus_AIRPLANE_1_desc:0 "That same warlord fell victim to his hubris, for he failed to anticipate that his precious dirigibles could be vulnerable to more nimble aircraft. Covering up this weakness is a simple enough matter, but the issue remains that these escort airplanes will not have the same range. Perhaps, one day we could station escorts on the airships themselves?"
KXN_Focus_AIRPLANE_2:0 "Modern Air Doctrine"
KXN_Focus_AIRPLANE_2_desc:0 "High above, a whole new battlefield is revealed: fighters duel to protect their allies, bombers and close-air support aircraft directly influence the ground war, and transports and scouts provide vital support. It seems there is a whole different world of battle to which our kind is unaccustomed. We cannot allow Kirinity to fall behind the times. We will conquer the skies as we have the land!"
KXN_Focus_MOTORCYCLE_1:0 "Iron Steeds, Forward!"
KXN_Focus_MOTORCYCLE_1_desc:0 "The majority of our forces are better suited for taking objectives, rather than holding them. It follows that a strategy based around quick assaults will leave many kirin exhausted, and to avoid that, an effective method of transportation is needed. Motorcycles shall fulfil this niche, but their usage will present further demands."

KXN_Focus_DEATH:0 "Hail War, Hail Death!"
KXN_Focus_DEATH_desc:0 "Battle doesn't need a purpose; the battle is its own purpose. You don't ask why a plague spreads or a field burns. You don't ask why the Lan Kir fight. Neither do the ashes of the fallen become worthless; it is the kindling that drives the burning banner of civilisation forwards."

While it would be simple and efficient to simply set ablaze whichever areas are known to be full of rebels, it would be more prudent to learn from willing collaborators the art of jungle warfare."
KXN_Focus_SWORD:0 "Lan Kir Sword Dancers"
KXN_Focus_SWORD_desc:0 "Far from obsolete, the hiltless blade demands great discipline from its user. One wrong move can result in the haughty kirin suffering a serious self-inflicted injury, but those trained under the Sword Dancers move with the speed and grace of a choreographed troupe, the steel and its user as one."
KXN_Focus_STORM:0 "Fervour of the Pyre"
KXN_Focus_STORM_desc:0 "There has been doubt that our methods would yield results outside of carefully managed training regimens. Those same doubts are now naught but ashes and fading embers.

KXN_dusky_daddy_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 31st of July, 947 in Solstice\n\n§YBiography§!: Strong, healthy foals are a sign of Concord's favour, so it was proclaimed when Long Dusk was sired.\n\nThus he was blessed, for the lack of a better word, with his mother's constant demands and lessons. Summer Storm was a peerless example of kirinity: fierce warrior, devoted servant of Concord, knowledgeable in all things a leader of exiled kirin should possess. She expected nothing less from her only child, and while the road was harsh and unforgiving on both body and mind, he succeeded her with great approval of all bannerkirin swearing allegiance to the Lan Kir.\n\nAustere, humourless and rarely tolerating failure, Long Dusk has nonetheless kept the dream alive of restoring the Matriarch's grace upon Her distant children. Actual progress was slow and minimal, but preparations were plentiful and extensive: it will take only a minimal effort to reclaim kirinkind's greatness once the stars align to signal the conflagration's beginning. To this end, he has relentlessly drilled the same sort of affection to his beloved daughters, Clarion Call and Prairie Spark, whom he can rely on most to carry the torch.\n\nFor a harmonious family leads to prosperity in everything, and only together can they realise a vision of greatness.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Rari"

How could she not, when Clarion was told from the early age that she was Concord's chosen to restore the greatness of kirinity? Peerless with a blade, a master strategist, and incredibly steadfast when it comes to controlling the nirik state, it would seem her demanding father created the perfect prodigy.\n\nWhile Clarion takes justified pride in her skill and talent, it came with certain downsides that are not easy to dismiss. It turns out that perfection is like a mountaintop, in the sense of having nokirin to truly relate to outside of her immediate family. The lack of social graces is manageable, but what she truly desires is approval from those same close-knit figures. Long Dusk had never been an approachable or affectionate parent, but her dearest sister, Prairie Spark, had been her foundation in moments of doubt.\n\nOnly together can they burn brightly, for separately they would be reduced to smouldering embers, ashes seeking what remained of the greatest of Valiants.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Rari"

Instead, Prairie admired her to no end, for she was perfect in everything, and when she faltered, Prairie would provide comfort. This support was reciprocated, for in the face of their demanding father, failure for one was failure for both.\n\nSecond best is still one of the best, however, and there is no denying Prairie is just as capable in leading the oathsworn bannerkirin. She is simply more cautious, and more heedful that sometimes the direct approach is not the best idea, which is seen by the reckless as a coward's recalcitrance.\n\nThere is no doubt, though, that should Clarion demand it, Prairie would burn the world for her, and she just might accomplish that.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Rari"

KXN_Bonfire_Cascade_desc:0 "Where Clarion Call is charismatic, calculating, and almost regal in her command, Bonfire is raw instinct and brute force. He does not scheme, but demands. When he enters a war council, it is not to debate but to decree. He loathes diplomacy, mocks ceremony, and derides "book generals" — but in battle, he is a storm: forced marches, ruthless flanking to the point of dangerous overextension, and lightning assaults in the face of impossible odds that result in the most improbable and glorious of victories. His wanton brutality and bloodlust is matched only by his military brilliance. Where he goes, his fiercely loyal bannerkirin follow, even if it were into the depths of Tartarus itself, for he shares their rations, bleeds with them in the mud, and lavishes upon them loot and glory without end."

Such a catastrophe would deny us the Golden City's unfathomable riches, robbing us of the fruits of our conquest.\n\nOur aerostats have located the pyramidal temple of the priesthood, scouts have identified a way to ford the moat surrounding the City, and our strategists have devised a plan for a small strike force of our most ruthless and cunning bannerkirin to slip into the City undetected. They will fight their way to the temple, and slaughter the priesthood in their beds. With the Thunder Tiger neutralised, a volley of flares will signal the fall of the temple, prompting our forces outside to storm the City. With regard to exfiltration, the strike force will be relieved when the City falls; failing that, they will have given their lives for the glory of Concord."

lan_kir.1.t:0 "Broken Silence"
lan_kir.1.d:0 ""My daughters." They stood at attention, their discipline instilled over the long years. The Primus Militarch took exceptional pride in that Clarion Call and Prairie Spark did as they were told, with no hesitation. "Have you been assiduous in the tasks I've assigned to you?"\n\nThe elder cast an imperceptible glance to the younger, and Prairie met his eyes. "Yes, father. Since we've received word that the edicts of Silence have been rescinded, the loyal Many have been reinvigorated. This is a clear, Concord-gifted sign that the Matriarch Superior has recognised the folly it brought." It didn't require divine wisdom to know that.\n\n"Why had you made us wait so long, father? You know that long delays are not a tool of the clever!" Clarion made her displeasure clear, and who could blame her? He had been preparing her since foalhood.\n\n"Curb your anger, Clarion. It is correct that the Silence has irreparably damaged the soul of kirinity, and utterly ruined our reputation. Other creatures—" he allowed some of his repressed feelings to emerge, "—knew exactly whom to fear and respect. It would not surprise me in the slightest if Vermillion had become a collection of hovels and beggars." Long Dusk would take a closer look at his prodigies. Clarion seemed eager to immediately right these wrongs, while Prairie gave off an uncertain feeling. They would keep each other in check. "Our flame has only just begun to flicker. See to it that it is stoked to a blaze." Both bowed their heads in respect."
lan_kir.1.a:0 "Kirinkind needs us."

lan_kir.2.t:0 "Clarion and Prairie at the Equinox Rite"
lan_kir.2.d:0 "The homeland of the Lan Kir, a scorched landscape blackened by fire and industry, is blanketed under a haze of smoke. On the night of the Equinox, when day and night stand equal, aspirant bannerkir assemble in their thousands beneath a blood-red sky. This is the oldest of their rites: to embrace the perfect duality of kirin and nirik, discipline and frenzy, kindling and flame. Pyres roar to life across the ritual field as war-horns sound in unison, their baleful shriek shaking the earth. Rank by rank, the bannerkir turn nirik and march into the inferno, their discipline unbroken even as they are engulfed by flame. The weak and cowardly falter and are dragged away or are left to be devoured by the fire. The strong and fearless endure, trotting out of the conflagration blackened but none the worse for wear.\n\nClarion Call trotted at the head of her host, naked but for a crimson cloak. At the first step into the flaming pyre she did not hesitate, her mane erupting into cyan fire as she turned nirik. Each motion was perfect, controlled, a soldier's precision turned into ritual — the embodiment of fear mastered and cold fury weaponised.\n\nPrairie Spark followed, slower, her hoofsteps deliberate. Her transformation came in silence: eyes closed, her breath steady, flames unfurling around her as rage and resolve intertwined. Where Clarion's fire roared with incandescent passion, Prairie's burned steady and unyielding. Her scars were vivid in the firelight, her quiet strength a counterpoint to her sister's brilliance. The nirik sisters stood in the centre of the pyre, wreathed in flame, facing each other through the blaze. Clarion raised her voice over the inferno:\n\n"Flame and flesh! Discipline and devotion! In Concord's name!"\n\nLed by their Patriarch- and Matriarch-Commanders, the bannerkirin roared as one, a thousand manes aflame. They struck the ground with their hooves, the sound echoing like thunder. In that moment, the rite was complete — the Lan Kir had once more proven themselves unbroken, and their leaders the living image of flame and flesh mastered, one and indivisible.
lan_kir.2.a:0 "We are kirin. We are nirik. We are one."

lan_kir.3.t:0 "The Expiation of Fear"
lan_kir.3.d:0 "The Rite of Kindling is not for the faint of spirit. A sacred tradition preserved only among the elite of the Lan Kir, it is equal parts trial, branding, and rebirth. Beneath fluttering banners, flamelight flickered across solemn, scarred faces. The gathered stood motionless, their jaws still stinging from the deliberate and shallow, yet deeply symbolic scar cut beneath the left eye to mark them as vessels of Concord's incandescent wrath. A low chant echoed across the stone plaza, accompanied by the scent of ash and incense. The Expiation of Fear had begun. One by one, each bannerkir stepped forward, a smearing of ceremonial oil still fresh upon their muzzle, to speak aloud the one fear they had never confessed, not even to themselves. Fear of failing the Matriarch or one's banner. Of losing oneself to the nirik state. Of dishonouring their ancestors. Of weakness passed down to one's foals.\n\nClarion Call spoke with cold clarity: "I fear that I will live long enough to see our glory tarnished by the unworthy." Her voice was like tempered steel.\n\nPrairie Spark hesitated. "I fear that we'll burn everything we love in trying to protect it," she admitted, quieter than the rest.\n\nA long silence followed. Clarion's expression didn't change, but her hoof briefly brushed Prairie's flank as she stepped back into formation.\n\nThe confessions were not mocked. They were accepted in solemn silence. In Lan Kir, courage is not the absence of fear — but its mastery. Only by facing what one dreads the most can a valiant truly master it, and themselves.\n\nThen came the final chant, shouted in unison, echoing against blackened stone as the fire danced in the brazier:\n\nIn life there is pain;\nin pain there is rage;\nin rage there is purpose;\nin purpose there is power;\nin power there is glory;"

lan_kir.4.t:0 "Initiation into the Ten Thousand"
lan_kir.4.d:0 "The column of the Ten Thousand wound its way through the charred valley, a river of steel shimmering in the evening haze. Clarion Call and Prairie Spark trotted together at the head of the vanguard, the thunder of marching hooves the backdrop to their conversation. For once, there was no council of war, no map-table between them — only two sisters, daughters of Long Dusk, trotting shoulder to shoulder as they had in youth.\n\nClarion broke the silence first. "You've come of age now, Prairie. No longer a banneret in waiting, no longer the sister in my shadow. A Militarch in your own right. Father would be proud. I am proud."\n\nPrairie turned her head, startled by the uncharacteristic tenderness in Clarion's voice. Clarion had always been flame and fury incarnate: incandescent, imperial, impenetrable. Yet tonight, in this fleeting moment, beside Prairie was not Clarion the iron matriarch, the bannermare who would be Primus, but Clarion the sister.\n\nThey halted on a ridge where the whole host could be seen passing below. Clarion stepped close, resting a hoof on her sister's shoulder. "You have always been my most steadfast companion, my sister, my friend. And there is no kirin I would trust with my life more than you. My Sworn Retinue of the Rutilant Shield would march with me into the depths of Tartarus itself. It has need of a Matriarch Vicegerent — my right hoof, my first sword. That place should be yours. If you take it, we shall fight back to back, and together we will be unbreakable. I would have none other to guard my life, none other to shoulder the burden beside me." The solemn offer hung heavy in the air. To be Matriarch Vicegerent of the Rutilant Shield was no mere sinecure, but the highest honour her sister could bestow upon any bannerkirin.\n\nPrairie bowed her head in gratitude and deference, yet her heart was pounding. To take her sister's offer would bind her to Clarion forever, sharing her triumphs, yes — but never her destiny. Yet as daughter of the Primus Militarch, Prairie also had the right to gather to her side companions of her choosing, to carve her own destiny rather than guard another's. To do so would be to step out of her sister's shadow and claim her place as a Militarch entire, no longer a satellite orbiting a brighter star. The chance to carve her own name into the annals of the Lan Kir — or to fail, and be eclipsed.\n\nClarion's eyes searched her sister's face, her voice steady but edged with something softer, more fragile. "I would be honoured beyond words if you trotted this path with me, Prairie. But if your heart calls you elsewhere..."\n\nThe torchlight of the Ten Thousand flickered below, countless kirin awaiting their command. At that moment, Prairie knew the choice would define not only her fate, but the fate of all who followed her."
lan_kir.4.a:0 "Swear fealty to Clarion, become Matriarch Vicegerent of the Rutilant Shield."
lan_kir.4.b:0 "Prairie Spark will carve her own path through history."

lan_kir.400.t:0 "The Guildmaster's Defection"
lan_kir.400.d:0 "The pavilion of the Primus Militarch was silent as Brass Lantern of the All-Kiria Artificers' Guild bowed low before the dais. His mane was streaked with soot, his robes scorched, and behind him stood a ragged column of engineers and artificers, their saddlebags heavy with strange devices. The silence broke with Clarion Call's voice, sharp as a blade. "Spies. That is what I see. You waited while the Silence destroyed your Guild and the Realm, then crawl to us only when it ends. You bring toys and tales of atrocity, but I see only opportunists. Why now? Why not then?"\n\nBrass Lantern bowed lower, pressing his head deeper into the dirt. "Because to speak then, Matriarch, was death. The Banner of the Covered Cage massacred my city of Sunrise in one night. They came without warning. They slaughtered everykirin — engineers, apprentices, foals. They smashed our forges, burned our libraries, and buried our machines beneath the ash. All to silence us. All because our minds refused to bow. I alone escaped, the sole surviving Guildmaster."\n\n"When the Silence broke, I carried our memory to Vermilion, to Rain Shine herself. I told Rain Shine the truth: that it was her mother, Noctilucent Dawn, who sent the Banner of the Covered Cage to destroy Sunrise. I begged her: denounce the murderers, honour my forebears as scientist-martyrs of Kiria, restore justice to the dead of Sunrise. I was a fool. She refused. She turned her back on the blood her mother had spilled." Brass Lantern struck the ground with his horn in obeisance. "And so I come here, not to Vermilion, but to you, who too had resisted the Silence. I bring my disciples, and what remains of our craft and knowledge — thaumaturgic batteries to magnify telekinesis, calculating-engines swifter than any scribe, machines that can build in days what would take years. We have nothing else, but this we give. Do not cast us away."\n\nClarion Call snarled. "You come bringing stolen fire from traitors' graves, and I should let you live? These could be planted seeds from the Covered Cage itself to poison us from within. I say we drive them out, or burn them where they stand." Prairie Spark interjected in a firm but calm tone: "Or we could keep them. They have knowledge possessed by no kirin else. If there is treachery ahoof, we'll know soon enough. If they speak truth, then we gain tools our enemies cannot match. Father, let me take them into my service. If there is perfidy, it will fall on me — and me alone." Long Dusk sits in silence, eyes half-shut. The burden of command was like a mountain on his back. Finally, he speaks. "So be it. They are yours, Prairie. You will answer for them with your honour, and with your blood if need be. Let them build, let them serve, but never let them forget who commands them. Brass Lantern, know this: you live only by the grace of the Lan Kir. Forget it, and you will burn."\n\nThe Guildmaster lowers himself flat on the ground, trembling. "By my ancestors, by the ashes of Sunrise, I swear it. We are yours, Primus. Our craft, our minds, our lives.""

lan_kir.401.t:0 "Hydrafall"
lan_kir.401.d:0 "They called her Kumakuyag the Eight-Tongued Queen, She of Many Mouths, Moon-Swallower of the Black Swamp. For five centuries, she had ruled the swamp and the jungle of the Far South. She was a mountain of muscle and scale, eight heads crowned with jagged horns writhing above a vast body. Her eyes burned red as cherries in the mist. The zebra of the Far South whispered her name in fear and reverence, leaving offerings at the edges of her hunting grounds to appease her hunger. The Golden Temple priesthood revered her as a living terror, the tooth and claw of the gods.\n\nThe Lan Kir had conquered the land, and Clarion Call would suffer no rival. Now they would conquer its gods. She and Prairie Spark led the hunt themselves, moving silently through knee-deep mire, scouts guiding them to a moonlit clearing baited with fresh zebra carcasses. The ground trembled before the hydra queen's arrival — a slow, sinuous bulk that blotted out the treeline. As Kumakuyag lunged, the clearing erupted in white-hot muzzle-flashes. Anti-tank rifles cracked in disciplined volleys, punching hoof-sized holes through scale and sinew. But every time a head was blasted apart, another lunged forward, snapping, devouring unlucky kirin. Prairie saw it first — the stumps writhed, smoking, and from them, new heads began to bud grotesquely. "Scorch the neck stumps!" she roared. Kiran firelances and firebombs cauterised each neck in turn, until the great body thrashed in the muck, headless, then collapsed in the shallows, the swamp boiling red around her.\n\nThe native zebra watched in stunned silence as their slain god was dragged from the swamp. That night, the hydra's carcass was split open and feasted upon by the Lan Kir. Clarion tore into one of its eight hearts, juice running down her muzzle, while the native chiefs bowed before her and swore fealty. As tribute, they offered up their semi-tame war hydras to her banner host. These creatures — smaller than Kumakuyag, but still formidable — would be trained to move in formation with her personal bodyguard, a living wall of scale and terror to guard the Primus Militarch's life."

lan_kir.403.t:0 "Master of the Desert"
lan_kir.403.d:0 "The Imazeeb shamans sang, their voices rising in a chorus to beckon their God. May Ijirmed help us. May she punish the invaders. Clarion Call felt no need to disrespect their rituals. Lan Kir's finest would prove their right to rule by combat, not words. With closed eyes and an emotionless expression, she waited while kneeling in the rough sand. For this hunt, she brought no modern weapons, nor anyone to help. Only a pair of grapple hooks lay by her side, a large chain binding them to her forelegs.\n\nClarion let any thoughts escape her mind. The cries of the shamans, the scorching sun, the whispering sand, even the ominous pulses that rumbled beneath the earth, weak and then strong. She reached a state of absolute focus. The world slowed. Utter serenity reigned until Clarion's eyes snapped open.\n\nWithin a beat of a heart, she transformed into her nirik state. Hooves and telekinesis reached for the grapple hooks, and she jumped into the air. The sand immediately gave in to an abomination that made the shamans shriek in joy and terror. The Tatzlwurm. A massive sand worm with a maw large enough to devour a kirin whole. Nevertheless, the beast would find its prey was no easy dinner. Clarion maneuvered through the air, letting the Tatzlwurm rise in its torrential attack to fall upon its back. With her grapple, she held onto the beast's scaly back with every ounce of strength in her body. The sandstorm thrashed in the dunes, descending and ascending, swimming in vain through the sands to rid itself of its aggressor. Yet Clarion stood firm. The grapple hooks pried open a scale on the beast's back, digging into its flesh. She pulled with her entire might, the nirik flames engulfing the iron chain and burning away the blurry brownish sandstorm that rose with the Tatzlwurm's rampage. The impasse stretched for minutes until the sounds abruptly stopped. The sand veil parted to reveal a shocking sight to the Imazeeb shamans. Clarion the Conqueror stood atop its exhausted body. The sand worm's pride as a hunter had been broken."

lan_kir.404.t:0 "The Spellfire Fellowship"
lan_kir.404.d_1:0 "Prairie Spark had long understood that iron alone would not win the wars to come. On campaign, she had witnessed first-hoof the power of a unicorn mage on the battlefield. The raid that left her scarred had proven it beyond doubt: a mere hoof-full of unicorns had nearly killed her and Clarion and brought the Ten Thousand low. Now, as a Militarch in her own right, she sought not only kirin loyalty, but something more — the fire and thunder of foreign sorcery.\n\nThrough diplomacy, coercion, and sheer force of will, Prairie has secured the allegiance of a cadre of unicorn battle-mages — outcasts, turncoats and mercenaries, some captured in battle, others attracted to the Lan Kir's glory and martial splendour. They were not bound by oath or kinship, but by avarice and ambition. To Prairie's Companion Kir they swore loyalty, forming a new inner guard unlike any other in Lan Kiran history.\n\nThe night they joined, Prairie presented them before her personal retinue. The unicorns stood cloaked in the apparel of war, horns glowing faintly, while her kirin companions eyed them with a mixture of awe and suspicion. Prairie broke the silence: "Iron can bend and break, and a fire can fade to ash. But magic — when yoked to will — endures. These mages will march and fight beside us, not as slaves or servants, but as bannerkin."\n\nThe statement was daring, almost heretical. But as the unicorns knelt and dipped their horns in salute, a roar of approval rose from her bannerkirin. Where Clarion bound herself to tradition, Prairie was carving something new: a force wielding not only nirik flame, but arcane spellfire.\n\nAlready they called it the Spellfire Fellowship — Prairie Spark's own, unmistakable, and dangerous."

lan_kir.405.d_1:0 "The captured manticore chieftain roared inside the pit, chains rattling as it hurled its massive body against the fetters that bound it as his clan watched from their cages, snarling and hissing. The beast was a terror of legend, mane the colour of blood, wings vast as sails, and tail crowned with venom. The crowd of bannerkirin howled in response, hungry for spectacle and blood. Clarion Call descended into the arena, armed with nothing but a long spear gripped in her telekinesis. She fixed the manticore with her gaze and spat into the dust. "Let strength decide who rules. Come and taste my steel, king of beasts."\n\nThe manticore charged, wings snapping wide, claws tearing furrows through the sand. Clarion's spear flashed forward, deflecting his first strike in a shower of sparks. He wheeled, tail whipping, and his stinger cracked like a hammer against her spear, forcing her back. The crowd screamed. Clarion hissed, her mane erupting into cyan fire as she turned nirik, sparks and flame spilling from her eyes. She met him head-on, her body moving like a dancer's through the storm of talons and teeth. His jaws snapped inches from her throat as she drove her spear up under his ribs, deep into his flesh.\n\n"Kill it!" the bannerkirin screamed. The rest of the manticore clan, snarling and rattling their chains, bayed in grief and fury, awaiting their own slaughter. Clarion lifted her spear to finish what she had begun — and cut him down cleanly, giving the manticore chieftain the warrior's death he demanded. The crowd roared for more. Bannerkirin clamoured for the slaughter of the rest of the manticore clan.\n\nAnd so they did. Clarion raised her spear high, then brought it down in judgement. One by one, the cages were opened, and one by one, the manticores were cut down in a storm of steel and fire. Their roars turned to whimpers, their wings and tails taken as trophies. When the last of the beasts lay slain, Clarion stood over the carnage, her mane still smouldering. She raised her spear high before her roaring host. "No kings but us," she said. "No rivals, mare or beast. Wherever the Lan Kir march, there will be only fire, and only our rule." The bannerkirin thundered in exultation. Moonlight Glow's heir, first sword of Concord, the matriarch beast-slayer — Clarion Call had shown all the world that nothing, not even the beast kings of the deep wilderness, could stand against the destiny of the Lan Kir."

What better proof of our right to rule than that even monsters bow to us? Slay them, and you have meat and hides. Spare them, and you have wings and claws to march beneath our banners." Clarion's eyes blazed, torn between bloodlust and ambition. "Look," Prairie said, pointing. The manticores were bowing. Wings spread, heads lowered, eyes locked on Clarion's hooves. Cowed by the death of their chieftain, they now yielded to his killer as their new alpha. "They are yours, sister." Eventually, Clarion lowered her spear. The bloodlust of the bannerkirin turned to exultation as the cages were thrown open and the manticores knelt to their Primus.

lan_kir.406.d_1:0 "The Banner Host has marched into many lands, but none felt as oppressive and cold as the Hindian peaks. The terrain was perilous and unstable, with one false step enough to plunge even the luckiest creature into the abyss. The temperature was freezing, biting at the kirins' skin even though they wore heavy clothes. A few even suggested they maintain the nirik transformation during the trip, if only to fend away the icy encroachment.\n\nThen why, one might ask, wander into such hostile lands? A hunt, they would answer. The struggle between prey and hunter was enough motivation to trespass even the most unforgiving regions of Zebrica. The sisters were at the forefront, with Prairie Spark in the lead. Their quarry was a famous monster in the region, with a lion's head and body, a goat's head sprouting from its back, and a tail that morphed into a snake. The infamous chimera.\n\nDays passed, the scouts tracking their quarry into the heart of the mountains. Within a cave, hibernating through the snowstorm, the chimera rested passively. The plan was simple: scare it out of its hole and ambush it as it stepped outside. Clarion herself acted as the vanguard, sneaking into the beast's lair. Once beside it, she snapped into her nirik state, point-blank gunfire echoing through the cave before she charged into melee. The chimera, disoriented and in panic, could only stall the attacks before rushing outside. "Now!" Clarion shouted, and the kirins waiting in ambush, together with Prairie, raised their firearms. The peaks' pristine white snow was dyed a deep crimson, each shot drawing more blood. The chimera tried to escape, but every path was blocked by the Militarchy's hunters. In a last act of defiance, it spat fire from its mouths, trying to cover the clearing in blazing flames. Alas, fire was a nirik's closest friend. Clarion cut through, reaching the struggling beast. Her blade reflected the flickering flames before it struck down."
lan_kir.406.d_2:0 "The Banner Host has marched into many lands, but none felt as oppressive and cold as the Hindian peaks. The terrain was perilous and unstable, with one false step enough to plunge even the luckiest creature into the abyss. The temperature was freezing, biting at the kirins' skin even though they wore heavy clothes. A few even suggested they maintain the nirik transformation during the trip, if only to fend away the icy encroachment.\n\nThen why, one might ask, wander into such hostile lands? A hunt, they would answer. The struggle between prey and hunter was enough motivation to trespass even the most unforgiving regions of Zebrica. The sisters were at the forefront, with Prairie Spark in the lead. Their quarry was a famous monster in the region, with a lion's head and body, a goat's head sprouting from its back, and a tail that morphed into a snake. The infamous chimera.\n\nDays passed, the scouts tracking their quarry into the heart of the mountains. Within a cave, hibernating through the snowstorm, the chimera rested passively. Even though bloodlust was thick in the air, Prairie urged a different approach. Rather than baiting the beast into ambush, they would sneak inside and restrain it. Words of discontent might have risen, but the kirins accepted the word of the strong as natural. They moved as one, sneaking close to the slumbering chimera. Prairie waited for every kirin to be in position before waving downwards to signal the attack. Spears cut through the darkness, puncturing the beast and snapping it awake. It roared and tried to fight back, but the spears were tied by chains — the kirins pulling them to immobilize their quarry. Clarion alone kept the snake's head in check. The chimera began to spurt fire; the kirins snapped into their nirik state to welcome the flames. Prairie leapt onto its back, restraining the goat's head and forcing its body down. The chimera struggled for dozens of minutes before finally exhausting in defeat."

Large reptiles spread across the dunes with a preference not to fight in melee, but to hurl boulders at great distances with tails resembling catapults. Nevertheless, a beast was still a beast, fated to become quarry to proud hunters.\n\nThus, it was no surprise that Clarion Call arranged a hunt. She would not abide wild animals contesting her rule over the land. The Banner Host marched into the barrenlands, seeking the traces of a slingtail nest. Little escaped Prairie Spark's eyes as she scouted ahead for her sister. Soon, they were found. Dozens of slingtails curled together, feasting upon the remains of their prey in a ravine. The kirin encircled them into a deadly battlefield. The stage was set.\n\nThe slingtails reacted first, spotting their aggressors. With shrieks of defiance, they picked up boulders with their tails and hurled them towards the kirins. "Brace for impact!" Clarion exclaimed just as the bombardment rocked their lines. It did little, though, as Lan Kiran discipline was not simply for show. Muzzle fire sparked through the rocky biome, the response matching the beasts in ruthlessness. Prairie called for firebombs to follow into the mayhem. The slingtails fought bravely, attempting many times to spearhead their way out of the encirclement with support from their kin's bombardment, yet the kirin lines held, impenetrable.\n\nAs the sun was finally threatening to set upon the horizon, silence reigned through the ravine."

Each time the beasts attempted to break through the encirclement, they were repelled and forced back, but the kirin made great effort not to deal mortal injuries. The battle lasted deep into the night, the slingtails' stubbornness only reinforced Prairie's desire to have them fight for the Militarchy.

The Valiant Ten Thousand stood in flawless formation, a guard of honour lining the avenue. As the forefront of the entourage, Silver Chime marched with calm steps—a contrast to the fiery temperament commonly associated with a Kirin from the southeastern territories, yet precisely the composure expected of an emissary dispatched by the Matriarch herself. \n\nFrom a balcony not far away, Prairie and Clarion both observed the choreographed procession, their views of Chime's arrival divided.\n\n"This is an utter farce, how could Father permit this ill-intentioned serpent into our home? She should have been turned away at the border instead of being allowed to come so far into our home. I fear her influence may spread rot among the common folk." Clarion murmured, her gaze sharp with distaste. "Such petty politicking is beneath us."\n\n"Clarion! This is an envoy of the Matriarch herself! It shows that our unending loyalty and service to Concord has finally been recognised." Prairie scolded her, her voice in hushed tones. "This is a favourable omen, not an ill one. Is this not the very recognition Militarchy has long striven for?"\n\n"If the Banners wished for a watchcreature sent to scrutinise our every action and report it all back to Vermillion." Clarion retorted bitterly.\n\n"There is truth in both your words." The voice of Long Dusk came from behind them as he emerged onto the balcony. Both daughters immediately showing their reverence. "The Plenipotentiary comes under the Matriarch’s authority," he stated, his tone leaving no room for debate. "Therefore, she shall be received with the utmost respect and hospitality. This is the will of Concord." He paused, his stern gaze silencing Clarion before she could voice a protest. "However," he continued, "we must also remember our duty to protect Kirinkind. This too is the will of Concord. You would both do well to remember this balance."\n\nThe sisters returned their gaze to the scene below, the weight of their father’s words settling heavily upon them, their own views being shaped up by the conversation.

The Primus Militarch had assembled the Banner Host, and kirinity answered his call a thousandfold. At last, the time they had trained their entire lives for had come.\n\nLong Dusk observed his soldiers from a pavilion, with Clarion Call and Prairie Spark just a few steps behind him. The former bore the same bloodthirsty anticipation in her eyes, the latter a calm resolve. Long Dusk emanated a profound air of authority and ruthlessness. Rearing against the heavens, he loudly proclaimed to his army, "Bannerkin! Daughters and sons of Concord, it is time! The Silence is broken — the long night ended! Kiria wakes, weak and trembling, like a newborn foal blinking at the dawn. Around her, the world has shifted, become cruel and strange. Already, the wolves circle."\n\n"But who stood vigil through that dark? Who kept watch while the Matriarchs slept? Who trained, who bled, who forged themselves into iron discipline so that Kiria would not perish in her slumber? You did! We did! The Lan Kir, Concord's chosen, the Valiant Ten Thousand eternal! Look to the north! Our suzerain stirs, but she is frail, her court rotted, her resolve weak. Look to the west! Barbarians sharpen blades and plot. Look to the south — all hunger for the day Kiria falls, so they may feast on her bones. This we cannot permit. This we will not permit."\n\n"We are few, yes — but we are fire and discipline made flesh. Our nirik flame will scour the foes of kirinity! Our hooves will trample them, our banners will blot the horizon! The world must be made safe for Kiria, for the Matriarch Superior, for the sacred children of Concord! This is what our ancestors died for, what we have trained for since foalhood, what Concord herself has marked us for. From the ash of our homeland to the ends of the earth, let every creature know: the Lan Kir march forth!"\n\nThe bannerkirins' eager reply came with the thunder of thousands of hooves, shaking the earth itself. The cacophony was met by Long Dusk's even more deafening voice. "To fulfil our sacred duty! To fight not only for Kiria! Not only for Vermillion! To fight for kirinity as a whole!"\n\n"March out, my bannerkirin! To undying glory! To endless conquest!" he roared, a zealous fire in his eyes. "March forth, my kin! For it is our vow to Concord!

This was a dream long deferred, now made real by steel and sacrifice. The bannerkirin had trained their entire lives in the dense forests and fire-scarred plains of the Zaikirian interior. The sea was but a myth to them, an idea passed down through ancient scripture, weathered maps, and old stories. Almost none had seen it. Until now.\n\nOn the beach, Prairie Spark stood in stunned silence, the roar of the waves in her ears and salt on her lips. She had led the march to the sea, and now she watched her bannerkirin — the same hardened mares and stallions who had swept aside the [KXN_Event_50_state_target.owner.GetAdjective] soldiery — cast aside their helmets and gallop into the surf, laughing. For a moment, even the most disciplined among them were fillies and colts again, overcome by foalish wonder. The surf glittered under the sun like molten silver, stretching far beyond sight, infinite and untamed. It was unlike anything she had imagined.\n\nClarion Call stepped beside her, expression unreadable. "You're staring," she remarked. "I've never seen anything so... enormous," Prairie replied softly. "And loud. It's loud."\n\nClarion tilted her head. "You grew up with artillery drills. You're afraid of waves?" "I'm not afraid," Prairie said, too quickly. Then, sheepishly: "Maybe a little. Of how it makes me feel."\n\nThey fell silent as bannerkirin in soaked uniforms splashed into the waves. Somekirin shouted with joy. For once, Clarion didn't call them to order.\n\n"It's beautiful," Prairie whispered. Clarion nodded, still watching the sea. "Yes. I want to keep it."\n\nThen the bark of mortars in the distance shattered the moment, putting an end to the reverie. Incoming shells began to fall, churning the sand and turning the seafoam crimson. The enemy had regrouped, and they were not about to let the Lan Kir bask in joy. Shouts rang out, orders barked. Clarion's blade was out in an instant, her serenity gone like smoke, eyes aflame.

Reaching Clarion Call's command tent, he executed an awkward, flapping bow and announced himself — loudly. "I am Giuseppe Georginio! I come from Wingbardy! I bring... boom."\n\nClarion, utterly unbothered, gave him a long, level look. Prairie Spark, seated beside her, blinked twice. "Explain," Clarion said. "I read of Lan Kir. Long history. Much inspiration. You have — how you say — 'honour through kaboom'? Yes?" He grinned, then added, "I was artillery officer. Trained in Yalish school. Boring! I want adventure. I cross sea. I find glory. I train you."\n\n"You came halfway across the world... to teach us artillery?" Prairie asked, incredulously. Giuseppe puffed his chest out proudly. "Lan Kir fight like inferno. I want to burn, too." He continued: "I learn your history. Read much scroll. So much honour, real fire inside. Not fake 'Way of Fire' mumbo. That is tourist mystic trash! But Lan Kir? Real stuff. Sacred! I even — look, look..."\n\nHe jabbed a talon toward a red, swollen scar under his eye. "I give myself scar. Painful, yes. But pain is meaning, no? I read this. You say it. 'In life is pain! Rage! Purpose!' All that!" Prairie winced. "That's... very infected."\n\nClarion stood, circling him slowly with a calculating eye. "Spin," she commanded. Giuseppe blinked. "... Spin?" "Turn," Clarion said. Giuseppe obeyed, wings spread, feathers slightly ruffled from the journey. A few bannerkirin in the tent gasped, either in awe or confusion.\n\n"Your wings are strong and intact," Clarion said, "and you don't smell like cowardice. Very well." She stepped forward. "From this day, you will be known as Feathered Lance, master of fire, feather, and fury. You will serve as my commander of artillery." Giuseppe looked up in shock, then bowed. "Truly?" Clarion nodded. "You came with skill and story. That is more than most. We will give you a proper Lan Kiran blade. We'll adjust the hilt for your claws.

Whispers of atrocities trail behind them: massacres, pillage, compelled harmony at the point of a blade. What chills Rain Shine more than their savagery is their certainty — that they act in her name. A dragonfire candle is lit, its flame green and accusing.

With the reprimand came demands. Cease our campaigning. Lay down our weapons.

This time it will not travel by dragonfire, but by hoof.\n\nA Vermilion Herald is chosen, cloaked in the red and gold of the Matriarchal Retinue. The missive they carry restates the demands: that Militarch Long Dusk cease all military action and present himself before the Vermilion Court.

Will you answer Her, or must we assume you no longer hear Her voice?" The words hang in the air like an unsheathed blade. Bannerkirin crowd the edges of the confrontation, their eyes narrowing at the Vermilion Herald, flanked by the crimson-clad bannerkir of the Matriarchal Retinue. Clarion Call stands at Long Dusk's side, her horn alight with restrained fire, but no order to attack is given.\n\nLong Dusk's answer is silence — a refusal by omission. Clarion steps forward instead, voice like cold steel: "The Matriarch's will is Concord. The conflagration we stoke is for the glory of Concord. If you would call that heresy, then you do not know Her at all."\n\nThe Herald and his escort withdraw under a chorus of muttered cursing, and more than one hoof reached for a weapon as they pass. The Lan Kir let them go without harm, though the tension is thick enough to choke on.\n\nIn the evening, the High Generalarchate gathered the host. The Militarch spoke not of rebellion, but of fidelity — claiming that the Herald's declaration was the product of corruption in Vermilion, and that Rain Shine is blind, her court a nest of weakness and scheming. Her divine will has been perverted by a cowardly conspiracy of those who fear strength. It is the Lan Kir's mission that remains true to Concord's incandescent glory.

Rain Shine's cabinet argued in the candlelit court chamber of the Vermilion Palace. Some urged war at once, but the Matriarch herself ordered one final attempt — not out of weakness, but to make clear before all kirinity that the Lan Kir's rebellion was of their own choosing.\n\nThis time, the message will not travel alone. A Vermilion Herald will set forth again, but under the protection of the best of Rain Shine's own Matriarchal Retinue — those sworn to her personal protection and trusted with her life. Their armour, lacquered crimson and gold, speak as loudly as any command; their mere presence a reminder that the Matriarch's will is not to be taken lightly. When they reach Solstice, they will join up with the Vermilion Plenipotentiary to the Lan Kir, Silver Chime, whose voice is laden with the full authority of the Vermilion Court. Together, they will confront Long Dusk and place before him the Matriarch Superior's final ultimatum.\n\nThis will be no quiet parley, no polite exchange of courtesy. It will be the last warning before words give way to steel. Even as they depart, the Realm begin to prepare for war — a mobilisation order is quietly inked, the supply network reviewed, the Vermilion Banner Army brought to military readiness.

The two emissaries moved with deliberate imperiousness through the camp, their armed entourage forming a bristling wall of armour and weaponry around them against the gathering crowd of hostile Lan Kir bannerkirin.\n\nThere would be no ritual formality or decorum. In Long Dusk's command tent, Silver Chime stepped forward, unfastened a pouch, and let a gilded medallion fall to the ground between them, the emblem of the Matriarch Superior catching the firelight.\n\n"Militarch Long Dusk," she declared, her voice carrying over the murmur of the gathering crowd, "by the will of Matriarch Superior Rain Shine, you are hereby summoned to Vermilion to answer for your crimes — the slaughter, the pillage, the violation of Concord's sacred scripture. You will present yourself before Her court by month's end."\n\nThe ring of onlookers swelled — grim-faced bannerkirin, muttering, stamping, their anger barely leashed. Only the Retinue's implacable presence and the sight of the Matriarchal crest upon their armour kept the crowd from drawing steel. They were the Matriarch's own, and even the boldest of the Lan Kir hesitated to strike them. For now. The bannerkirin looked to Long Dusk — to see if their Militarch would kneel, or if the path ahead would be war.\n\nLong Dusk's eyes never left Silver Chime.

lan_kir.199.d:0 "The camp was silent long after the Vermilion Herald and Silver Chime departed, escorted by the Matriarchal Retinue. Long Dusk had ordered the medallion retrieved from the dust, returning it to the Herald with clipped words about "logistical timing" and "clarifying the will of the Matriarch" — and a promise to "duly consider Her word" rather than an outright refusal. It was enough to spare the emissaries from immediate violence, but in the eyes of many bannerkirin, it reeked of hesitation.\n\nAmong the rank and file, the damage was done, discontent spreading like wildfire. Had the Militarch bent the knee to Vermilion, leaving their humiliating condescension unanswered? Was the iron will that had propelled the Lan Kir across Zebrica now blunted by cowardice and fear? Bannerkir loyal to Long Dusk spoke of strategy, of buying time to prepare for the inevitable war. Yet in the hearts of those raised on fire and conquest, the doubt festered. Was the Matriarch truly against them? Or was their leader losing his nerve?\n\nThe truth was crueler still: every heartbeat bought by delay also frayed the legend of the Lan Kir's invincibility. And to the north, the Matriarch's court would be weighing that same hesitation, deciding if it marked prudence... or weakness. Before the High Generalarchate, Long Dusk declaimed at great length on tactical necessity: the importance of carving out breathing space to marshal their strength, gauge enemy intent, and choose the terrain on which to fight. Yet even the most loyal bannerkirin could feel it — the ruse was fraying, and sooner or later, Vermilion's banners would be on the march."

lan_kir.200.t:0 "First Blood"
lan_kir.200.d:0 "The medallion struck the dirt.\n\n"My answer," Long Dusk said, "is the same iron law Moonlight Glow taught the first of the Lan Kir. To rule is the right of the strong. To obey is the lot of the weak. We are strong. And you are weak." Then, without a further word, he drove his blade through the Herald's throat. The camp erupted into an orgy of bloodshed. The Matriarchal Retinue formed up into a defensive ring around Silver Chime, but the Lan Kir bannerkirin cut them down in a storm of flame and steel. The hoof-to-hoof combat is frenzied and brutal. Clarion Call, hurling herself into the fray, is speared through the flank; Long Dusk, fighting alongside his daugher, is slashed across the muzzle by a nimble Kirian valiant before she is gutted by a bayonet. When the killing is over, the gilded medallion is trampled into the mud, glinting faintly beneath a crust of dried blood.\n\nThat night, Long Dusk convenes the High Generalarchate. "The Matriarch's mind is poisoned," he declares. "Rain Shine has been deceived. If we do not march on Vermilion, She and Concord will be lost to us — and to all of kirinity. We must free the Matriarch from the treacherous grip of Her own court."\n\nMurmurs rippled through the tent — not of doubt, but of grim approval. The smell of iron still clung to their nostrils from the slaughter, and their eyes burned in the lamplight. Clarion Call, still pale from blood loss, forced herself to her hooves. "Vermilion calls us butchers. Let them. They will see the truth when we stand in the Matriarch's court and lay her false counsellors at her hooves — in chains, or in pieces."\n\nA ripple of low laughter passed among the officers, but not all joined in. Wildfire Flourish leaned forward, eyes narrowing. "And the rank and file? The Matriarch's seal is not something they'll forget seeing trampled." Long Dusk slammed his hoof onto the table. "They will forget nothing — they will understand. We are not traitors to Concord. We are Her last defenders." He looked to each bannerkirin in turn. "The banner host will march at dawn. Kiria will be our next conquest." Outside, the war drums began to beat."

lan_kir.201.t:0 "A Death in Vermilion"
lan_kir.201.d:0 "It happened in the heart of Vermilion, under the roof of the Imperial Palace. Primus Militarch Long Dusk had just returned from an evening trot when the assassins struck — a stay-behind valiant hit squad belonging to the Banner of the Covered Cage, sworn enemies of the Lan Kir since the Silence. The first strike opened his foreleg, severing tendon and muscle. The second found his ribs. The blade had been poisoned. It was no common toxin, but distilled frostfire, an alchemical compound made from the Foal's Breath flower designed to choke the nirik spark before it could kindle. In his dying moments, Long Dusk would have felt the cold crawl through his veins, his inner fire guttering, his fury smothered out.\n\nBut Long Dusk did not go quietly. He fought like a demon, hurling one assassin down a flight of stairs, crushing another's skull with his hooves, and tore the throat from a third with his teeth. But the fourth shot him clean through his breastplate, and with Long Dusk's magic extinguished by the frostfire, his strength ebbed. By the time his personal guard burst in, the Primus Militarch lay dead, one hoof still wrapped around the throat of the last assassin he'd killed.\n\nBy nightfall, the city burned with the vengeance of the Lan Kir. Dozens of hostages were put to the sword. It took the assassins who had been captured three days to perish, their agony on public display all the while.\n\nThe funeral was a spectacle of iron discipline. Every bannerkirin stood at rigid attention as Long Dusk's body was laid upon a great pyre, clad in his armour and regalia. It took three hours before the last of the funereal smoke dissipated into the night sky. Prairie Spark had wept in silence. Clarion Call did not — her eyes were fixed, cold and unblinking on the city's skyline. In the silence after the flames died, she spoke only once:"

lan_kir.202.t:0 "Sound the Drums of War"
lan_kir.202.d:0 "The drumming began before dawn, low and steady, rolling over the city like the distant growl of an oncoming storm. The air still smelled faintly of ash from the funeral pyre — the last trace of Primus Militarch Long Dusk, father, conqueror, and martyr. The bannerkirin stood in silent formation, shoulder to shoulder, their breath hissing through teeth clenched with grief and rage.\n\nClarion Call mounted the obsidian dais without ceremony. At her side hung her father's blade, its edge still sharp and gleaming. She stood a long moment, letting the drumming and the Lan Kir's synchronised breathing fill the silence. Prairie Spark stood behind her, pale and still, eyes moving like a sentry scanning for danger. Clarion did not speak at first. She thrust the sword skyward, and a ripple passed through the host as ten thousand bannerkirin stood to attention. The drumming ceased in perfect unison.\n\n"The injustice foisted upon us," she said, her voice carrying like a trumpet over the silent host, "we do not bemoan, but pay back in kind. Those who would see kirinity destroyed revel in our sorrow. They say our Primus got what he deserved, and celebrate his death as their salvation." Clarion drove the sword into the stone, sparks spitting from the impact. "They sought to quench the flame of the Lan Kir. But here we stand — brighter, fiercer, hungrier. My father's death will not be our end. It will be our proving."\n\nThe host began to stamp their hooves in rhythm, the sound like a rolling thunderclap. Clarion paced the dais, eyes locked on the massed ranks below. "They call us barbarous. But is it barbarity to survive? They call us butchers. But is it butchery to put to the sword those who would see kirinity strangled in its crib?" Prairie's gaze swept the crowd. She could see it — the way Clarion's words lit an inferno in their eyes. Even in grief, they looked ready to tear the world apart. Clarion turned back to the crowd, her mane now ablaze in a halo of fire. "The world is a pyre," she said, voice low at first, drawing them in. Then, with the force of a battle cry: "And we are the spark! Go forth, Lan Kir, and conquer!"\n\nA roar answered her — wordless, furious, exultant, a tidal wave of sound and heat, of manes igniting, of steel striking steel in frenzied salute. Somewhere in the mass, a chant began:\n\n"Clarion!" somekirin shouted. "PRIMUS!" the crowd answered. "CLARION! PRIMUS! CLARION! PRIMUS!" they roared, a wall of sound shaking the square. Prairie stood in the shadow of her sister, feeling the heat, the certainty, the unstoppable momentum. And she wondered, quietly and privately, if the Lan Kir would survive the blaze Clarion had just lit."

No doors were kicked in, no buildings set aflame. Patrols posted themselves at intersections, politely but firmly directing civilians to remain indoors. On the steps of the Imperial Palace, Long Dusk turned to Prairie Spark. "We could take everything," he murmured. Prairie shook her head. "And then we would own nothing. Let them see we are not beasts. Let them fear our restraint as much as our fury."\n\nLong Dusk gave the order. No blood shall be spilled. No treasure shall be taken. The Lan Kir would enter no home, harm no civilian, and take nothing that was not surrendered. The kirin of Vermilion watched from shuttered windows as their conquerors passed, silent and austere. Whispers spread that perhaps the Lan Kir were not the butchers the court had claimed — at least, not today. To the conquered, it was mercy. To the Lan Kir, it was discipline."

No! The Lan Kir cried in anger. To them, these kirin were weak and degenerate. They had been swimming in wealth, enjoying an easy life while their kin suffered. Concord Herself agreed! Else why would they be permitted to ransack every temple, every museum, every house worth more than its weight? The city was but a treasure trove waiting for its righteous owners.\n\nOn the steps of the Imperial Palace, Prairie Spark implored her father, "Order them to stop! Please! We came to save Kiria! Not out of disgusting greed!" Long Dusk did not reply. He merely cast her a side glance, yet it was enough to make her press her lips into a flat line. Truly, he knew his daughter was not wrong. Yet his ancestors had bled and suffered for Vermillion. He had bled and suffered for Vermillion. Hundreds of thousands of his bannerkirin had as well. Was it really right to let it all go? Revenge was a dangerous wish, but also a sweet one.\n\nLong Dusk waited. Vermillion wept as its riches were stolen, leaving it no more than a husk, a shadow of its past. Only when there was no more to take did he finally turn to Prairie Spark. He paid no mind to his daughter's anxious and angry expression. He simply instructed."

Ugly, festering feelings became more prominent, more intoxicating to the kirin who partook of the forbidden power. A bulbous tumour grew unfettered, nourished by these sickening emotions. It tipped the Banner Host to the edge, waiting only for a spark to make it explode. And then it happened.\n\nVermillion had fallen. The ancient city walls were torn apart by unrestrained bombardment, letting the kirins, drunk on their nirik fury, swarm inside. The aura of bloodlust was heavy in the air, suffocating. Kirin were slaughtered without even the chance to beg for mercy. Buildings were burned to the ground and reduced to nothing. There was no kinship nor forgiveness. Only destruction.\n\nThe city wept in despair. Pyres to Concord were lit above the ruins, torrents of smoke mingling in the skies to form turbid clouds. The heavens themselves joined in sorrow, raining upon the devastation. On the steps of the Imperial Palace, Long Dusk stared with a bestial grin. The Banner Host would claim supremacy over kirinity. Vermillion would be rebuilt one day in his image, purged of degeneracy and corruption. The Matriarchate would obey his will, for it had no other choice.\n\nHis crazed gaze swept over the flames of purification consuming the city. On this day, Long Dusk believed himself to be the arbiter of Concord. Following Her will, he burned the impurities of kirinity to ashes, and henceforth they would be born again. Stronger, mightier, more faithful than ever. His devotion was blinding - enough that he did not realise what had happened just beside him. Prairie Spark stood there."

Prairie Spark and Clarion Call moved as one, hoofsteps echoing through the ruined grandeur. They passed statuary cracked by shellfire and frescoes blackened by nirik flame. At the end of a scorched hallway, a steel vault door groaned open under the attention of Lan Kiran artificers. Ancient wards had been broken, physical locks shattered. Within, amidst velvet-lined cases and relics of near-myth, lay what they had sought: a slender crescent forged of meteoric iron, its surface flawless, curved edge gleaming with a mournful light.\n\n"The Dawn Sliver," one of the artificers whispered, reverent. Clarion stepped forward. Her telekinesis caressed the hiltless blade. She swung it in a slow, testing arc through the air — and the blade sang. "Autumn Sun's own," Clarion murmured. "So much done with so little ornament. He could have conquered the world with this blade."\n\nPrairie Spark stood behind her, gaze fixed not on the blade but on her sister's expression — intense, unblinking, something feral stirring in her soul. "They say," Prairie said slowly, "that Autumn Sun, First Sword of the First Matriarch, struck down Scarlet Crucible last with that blade. She was his friend. A fellow sworn companion of Incandescent Dawn. They say they both gave in to their bloodlust, from which only Autumn Sun awoke. After that," Prairie continued, "he renounced the sword. Became a monk. Hid from what he'd done."\n\n"Because he was weak," Clarion said. "He mistook self-denial for virtue." "No," Prairie said. "He knew how the Dawn Sliver channelled his nirik fury into inequine strength, and how this fury consumed more of his soul each time. He was afraid of what he might become next."\n\nClarion didn't respond. She stared at the Sliver as if looking for Concord's reflection along its polished edge.

Between the two hosts, in the quiet of no mare's land, the two commanders met.\n\nPrairie spoke first, her voice steady: of the long marches they had endured together, of the empires they had brought low, of the banners they had carried side by side under Long Dusk and Clarion Call. She reminded Bonfire of his oaths — to her father, to her sister — and of the oath that now remained: to what remained of the Lan Kir Militarchy, and by extension, to her.\n\nShe did not demand submission. She offered it as a pact of honour. The Lan Kir were far from home, scattered, bleeding, hunted. If they were to survive, they must rally under one banner, hers. Bonfire would keep his Equatorarchy; he would rule it as her vassal, and his power would be secured.\n\nAs proof of her good will and pure intent, she returned a group of his own officers, cowed and bound, who had come in the night whispering treachery to her. They had beseeched Prairie for her to let them kill him, to send his head back to her camp. Instead, she hoofed them back to him, untouched, for justice to be rendered upon them by their master and commander.\n\nBonfire looked long at her, his eyes burning with suspicion. All waited for his decision: would the Equatorarch kneel, or would he spit on her offer and call his army to battle?\n\nAt last he gave a great laugh, the sound carrying over the field.

Tributaries once cowed by the nirik menace have risen in open revolt. The Great Kir Constellatory is unravelling.\n\nThe first hammer blow falls from within. Bonfire Cascade, among the greatest Militarchs of his age, has declared Clarion unfit to rule. From his stronghold in [?var:KXN_Strongest_Satellite_State_Var.GetNameDef], he renounces her command and proclaims himself the Rutilant Emperor, sovereign of a reborn empire of nirik flame and fury. His banners have already rallied to him, and several satellite states have raised his battle-standard in allegiance.\n\nWhere Clarion Call is charismatic, calculating, and almost regal in her command, Bonfire is raw instinct and brute force. He does not scheme, but demands. When he enters a war council, it is not to debate but to decree. He loathes diplomacy, mocks ceremony, and derides "book generals" — but in battle, he is a storm: forced marches, ruthless flanking to the point of dangerous overextension, and lightning assaults in the face of impossible odds that result in the most improbable and glorious of victories. His wanton brutality and bloodlust is matched only by his military brilliance. Where he goes, his fiercely loyal bannerkirin follow, even if it were into the depths of Tartarus itself, for he shares their rations, bleeds with them in the mud, and lavishes upon them loot and glory without end.\n\nBonfire Cascade has framed himself as the true heir of the Lan Kir's creed: martial prowess unbound by morality, nirik fury unshackled by restraint. He despises what he calls Clarion's "imperial pretensions," accusing her of aping Rain Shine's degenerated court in Vermilion. To him, the Lan Kir were never meant to rule from thrones or wear crowns. Concord's progeny were meant to burn, conquer, and devour.\n\nTo the bannerkirin torn between them, the question becomes: follow Clarion, their incandescent Matriarch-Commander who speaks of destiny and Concord's will, or Bonfire, the warlord who promises loot, glory, and the unfettered right of the Lan Kir not only to rule, but to devour.\n\nIn [KXN.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], Prairie Spark rallies her sister's loyalists. Prairie denounces Bonfire's bloodlust, cautioning that if the Lan Kir cannot master their fury, it will master them instead. The Lan Kir are not the demonic and feral beasts their enemies say they are, but Concord's chosen children, heirs of the dawn, destined to rule over a world broken and remade in Concord's divine image.

In their wake came fire and thunder: half a dozen unicorn battle-mages on pegasus-drawn sky-chariots, their horns blazing with lightning and deadly magic.\n\nLan Kiran banners burned. Hastily mustered fireteams collapsed under an onslaught of unicorn sorcery that tore through the Lan Kir's disciplined ranks like paper. Sporadic anti-air fire cut down some of the pegasi, but still they struck, descending on thin-walled tent after tent to gut groggy kirin in their beds.\n\nFrom the wreckage of her tent, Clarion burst forth in a blaze of cyan fire, her mane igniting as she turned nirik, cutting one pegasus raider down with a dagger hurled at his neck. Facing her down in a semicircle were the unicorn battle-mages, who had converged on Clarion's command tent. This was to be, for them, a one-way assassination mission, the last forlorn hope of their tribe. Clarion met them in battle, parrying one's hiltless blade mid-swing with her own, but another's crackling spell scorched the earth black beneath her.\n\nAt the last moment, Prairie Spark, having just arrived on the scene, hurled herself forward, deflecting an energy blast meant for her sister with her body, the magic missile tearing across her flank. Bannerkirin surged to close ranks around the sisters, a fierce counterattack driving the pony attackers back.

With her retinue, she plunged headfirst into the reeds, her personal battle-standard trailing behind her like fire.\n\nThe story takes an unexpected turn. While tracking the beast, Clarion galloped headfirst into a hive of creatures the locals call flyders — green-skinned, multi-legged arachnids with buzzing wings, jagged mandibles, and spinnerets that shower their prey in choking webs. They fell upon her like a stormcloud, biting and stinging from every direction. Clarion's retainers roared with laughter as their commander, conqueror of nations, scourge of kings, danced about swatting at bugs. Even Clarion herself could not help but grin through gritted teeth, her pelt welted red beneath her armor.\n\nAt last, the beast itself appeared — a hulking cragadile, its stony carapace gleaming in the sun. Clarion leapt upon its back with fire in her mane, driving her spear into its eye. The cragadile thrashed, then fell still. Triumphant, bruised, and covered in flyder bites, the Primus Militarch ordered the carcass hauled back to camp. She will rest now, her body recovering from the hunt.\n\nYet whispers pass among the camp-followers: that even the mightiest flame can be dimmed, not by glorious foes, but by a thousand tiny stings..."

lan_kir.499.t:0 "Death of The Conqueror"
lan_kir.499.d:0 "The tent was already thick with smoke and shouting when Prairie Spark rushed in. Clarion Call lay upon a litter, pale and motionless. In distant [KXN_farthest_state_from_solstice_target.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], far from Solstice, far from their homeland, the Conqueror's flame had gone out. Prairie stood frozen, the weight of absence crushing her chest — she had not been there when her sister drew her last breath.\n\nIt had began as a jest. Clarion Call, Primus of the Great Kir, dancing and swearing as she swatted at the buzzing flyder swarm while her retinue roared with laughter. That night they drank from the cragadile's skull, and all seemed as it ever was: Clarion the Conqueror, resplendent and invincible.\n\nBut the venom had swiftly taken root. Her skin darkened, each vein crawling with black fire, her strength leeching away. Clarion, who had led the Lan Kir across the continent, who had conquered the world in Concord's name, was brought low by an insect's bite. Her body burned with fever, yet could no longer summon flame. Her speech spiralled into delirium, until even that ceased. By the time Prairie reached her sister's side, Clarion, Matriarch of the line of Summer Storm, Militarch of the Lan Kir, was but a husk. Cold. Gone.\n\nFor a moment Prairie could not comprehend it. There was no farewell, no final command. The one who had been her commander, her sister, her best friend, was simply gone. The gathered bannerkirin began to shout, to accuse, to scheme. Clarion's generals, deprived of her iron hoof, already circling like vultures, now fell upon one another like wolves. Old companions, hardened bannerkirin, clawing at each other's throats for succession. One burst into nirik fire, another answered in kind, and in a heartbeat the command tent dissolved into fratricide. Steel clashed on steel, loyal retainers dragged comrades into the melee, the shouts of "Primus Militarch!" rising above the chaos like a curse.\n\nPrairie seized a young aide by the collar, hissing through her teeth: "Suppress this. Keep it quiet. If word spreads, the host will shatter." But she could already hear the din beyond the canvas walls, the swelling cacophony of bannerkin turning upon bannerkin, with the terrible crescendo of civil war. News of Clarion's death was already loose in the camp — and with it, the Great Kir was tearing itself apart.\n\nPrairie looked once more at her sister's still face, then at the firelit madness raging around her. Her heart screamed to grieve, but duty stifled it. There was no time. No choice. Only the terrible knowledge remained: the age of Clarion Call, and with her, the Lan Kir, was over."

The bannerkirin that once marched with iron discipline and unquestioning obedience to the Militarchate are now stranded on strange, hostile soil with no empire behind them, no supply train, no home but the thought of one far to the east. The Great Shattering has broken more than the Great Kir Banner Host — it has broken the chain of command itself.\n\nAround campfires, in makeshift barracks, in the cold and wet of muddy trenches, the rank-and-file bannerkirin gather in rough assemblies, voices raised no longer in chants of fealty and devotion, but in debate. They are no longer willing to endure orders that lead only to death and futility. "We are not beasts of burden," one trooper spat, "but proud bannerkirin of the Lan Kir. We will fight, yes — but not to be wasted."\n\nPrairie Spark watches as these councils of the common soldiery take shape, mutinous bands of scarred veterans and weary survivors defying the old absolutist stratocratic order. Once, they would have been broken up with fire and iron, but now the Militarch herself is forced to stand before them and justify her right to lead. Yet they do not deny her leadership outright. Instead, they demand that it be tempered — that she must argue, persuade, and respect the collective voice of her bannerkirin if she is to lead them at all.\n\nOne bannerkirin rose. "Primus, we marched behind Long Dusk, behind Clarion. We obeyed without question, and now look around you — ash, ruin, and death. You ask us to march east, across a continent that does not want us. Why should we obey again?" Prairie met their gaze. "Because if we scatter, we are nothing. Only if we march together will we be Ten Thousand strong. I do not deny your dismay. You have fought and bled beside me. I have asked much of you, as have my sister and father before me. But without order, without unity, there will be no home to return to — only a nameless grave in foreign earth. The name of the Lan Kir is still feared and respected by this world. Let us prove that we are not spent yet."\n\nThere was a long pause. Then, slowly, hooves struck the earth in unison. Not a chant of obedience, but the rough, grudging rhythm of solidarity. It is a fragile compact, born of necessity. The rank-and-file now follow their commanders into battle after bruising battle not because of blind obedience, fanatical zealotry or lust for glory, but because of their shared and desperate dream of return. If Prairie cannot balance her authority with the will of the councils, [KXN.GetNameDef] will surely collapse into mutiny and ruin. For now, the Soldier's Republic marches on."

lan_kir.599.d:0 "In the blasted rubble of Timbucktu, atop the collapsed and blackened portico of the old university, an elderly zebra sat upon a fallen column, beneath the sky open through the shattered roof. In a past life, he had been a professor of science. Now, he was known to the scattered communities of urban survivors as a sage and storyteller. Around him gathered a hoof-full of foals, their coats caked in dust, their ribs showing thin through their hides. They had known only famine, poverty and ruin — the world left behind after the Great Kir burned the continent to ash. "Once, children," said the sage, "this world was not so small. Once, we journeyed not only on hoof or by cart, but by steel engines of our own making. Massive beasts that breathed steam thundered down tracks that stitched the continent together. On the iron road, you could travel from the jungles to the desert in a single day."\n\nThe foals blinked, puzzled. Some whispered among themselves, trying to imagine such a thing. The sage continued. "There were wagons that moved by themselves without sweat or toil, wagons that drank fire-oil and galloped across the land with the speed of the wind. There were ships — iron leviathans — that crossed the vast oceans, bearing news, goods, and travellers from far-off lands. Our cities used to sparkle like the stars in the sky at night, constellations of light powered not by flame but by captured lightning. And here, in these halls, we learned how to build these great devices. We dreamed of flight, and of soaring even higher."\n\nHis voice faltered. Around him, the shell of the university seemed to press in. Ruined books still lay mouldering in the debris, their pages now home to mold and insects. He bowed his head. "Now, we till the soil with hooves and wooden plows. We pray for rain and starve in its absence. The world is smaller, dimmer, poorer. We have gone backward, children. And this—" he gestured to the ruins, "—is the inheritance the Great Kir left you: a dark age, born of fire."\n\nThe foals were silent. To them, this was not tragedy but mystery; they had never seen locomotives, or diesel cars, or steam ships, or aeroplanes. To them, such wonders were fairy tales. The sage's tears, however, were real. He wept not for the world the children had lost, but for what they could no longer imagine."

lan_kir.600.t:0 "Something New"
lan_kir.600.d:0 "The march was over. What remained of the Ten Thousand had limped into Solstice, hooves cracked, uniforms ragged, eyes hollow from years of war and death. The homeland was little more than ash and ruin — the forest stripped bare, river water running black, villages abandoned. Prairie Spark, last descendant of the line of Summer Storm, expected nothing but silence, the end of an epic tale written in blood.\n\nBut in a small shrine on the city's edge, she found a secret hidden from all. Waiting for her there was a quiet kirin matron who had been a retainer to Clarion Call, and who had guarded a secret through the Great Shattering. Swaddled in simple cloth, eyes wide and unknowing, lay a foal — Clarion Call's sole progeny. Born in secrecy, hidden while the Great Kir burned the world, the infant had survived when their family and the Militarchy had perished. For the first time in her long march, Prairie felt that she would cry, not for what had been lost, but for what might yet be. The Lan Kir had marched to free the Matriarch, then to avenge Long Dusk, then to glorify Clarion — until there was nothing left but ash. Now, here was her sister's legacy: not a continent-spanning empire, nor the death and destruction she left in her wake, but a foal, untarnished by bloodlust or avarice, a blank slate free of the cycle of war and death that had consumed the Lan Kir.\n\nIn that moment Prairie understood. They had lived and died by the sword; they had conquered, they had burned, and at last, they had shattered. But the future need not be written in blood. In her sister's heir Prairie saw both burden and blessing: the chance to raise a kirin not for war, but as a foal of that which had long been denied to the Lan Kir — art and music, culture and learning, peace and harmony. The chance for atonement was not yet lost to her people. The last ember of Clarion's conflagration could be a spark that could kindle something new — a more peaceful, softer, better world.\n\nThe battered bannerkirin, gathering around their Primus, saw the foal too. Some fell to the ground in silence, some wept openly, some prayed to Concord. For the first time in memory, there was no talk of war. Only the hush of possibility."
lan_kir.600.a:0 "A chance to start anew."

lan_kir.580.t:0 "Exodus"
lan_kir.580.d:0 "The Consororal Bannerhold is being abandoned.\n\nFrom the wharves of Clarionople to the dusty roads inland, a great exodus surges forward. Families haul their possessions in crates and sacks, strapped to their backs, lashed to carts and makeshift litters. Foals stumble beside them, too young to remember the great campaigns, too old to be carried. Salvaged cars grind forward, patched with mismatched armour plates, spewing oily black fumes. Convoys of battered trucks scavenged from half a dozen nations rattle and groan under impossible loads. Wagons creak, pulled by sweating kirin and half-broken beasts of burden, while long columns of soldiers march on hoof. All are part of the same endless column, stretching from the port to the horizon.\n\nAt the head of it all, Prairie Spark rides, her voice hoarse from command, her eyes fixed not on the city she is leaving behind but on the long road ahead. The Bannerhold — once a paradise on foreign shores — is no longer home. Prairie Spark has decreed that the Lan Kir will return to Solstice, no matter how hostile the continent, no matter how costly the journey.\n\nBut as the Ten Thousand march out, whispers ripple among the ranks: "Home? Or defeat?" "Are we marching towards destiny... or fleeing from it?" At the war council, some officers mutter that this march is folly — that the Lan Kir have built a stronghold here, richer and softer than the scorched forests of Zaikiria. Others sneer, spitting that only cowards cling to foreign comforts, and that Prairie's doubters have forgotten their roots. The reality is that losing one's home is always hard; twice, doubly so."

lan_kir.581.t:0 "The Petition of Feathered Lance"
lan_kir.581.d:0 "Prairie was overseeing the departure of the last convoy when a small delegation pushed through the crowd, led not by a kirin but by a griffon. Giuseppe Georginio — but as he is now more commonly known, Feathered Lance. Once, he had been tolerated more as a curiosity than a comrade, a griffon whose accent made kirin laugh. Now, gone was the wide-eyed foreigner who had crossed half the world to join the Lan Kir out of some romantic notion of glory. In his place stood a grizzled veteran. His beak was notched and scarred, his cuirass battered but meticulously polished. War has a way of burning away softness. Behind him stood a cohort of bannerkirin, battered, weary, but proud. They bore Clarionople's flag beside Giuseppe's personal standard. And though he bore no kirin blood, every kirin in his following stood behind him with unwavering loyalty.\n\nGiuseppe gestured broadly toward the coastline where Clarionople rose, its half-built towers and walls gleaming in the sun. "Primus Prairie Spark. We have fought across the continent to reach this land. We bled for it. We buried our kin in its fields. And now, look! Look at this city that bears your sister's name. The streets are paved in our style. The arches bear our carvings. The locals have learned our tongue. Some of us took wives here. Some of us sired foals who know no soil but this. This city is ours. It is home." Murmurs rippled through the watching kirin. Some nodded. Some scowled. Giuseppe pressed on, his wings flaring as his voice rose. "Clarionople is the proof that our destiny was real. That the dream was fulfilled. And yet you ask us to abandon it. To march back across a continent already stained with our blood."\n\nOne of Prairie's aides spat. "You want to desert. To cut yourself loose from the Ten Thousand. Who are you to tell us what the Lan Kir must do?" But the words rang hollow. Everykirin could see the truth — that Giuseppe had long since ceased to be an outsider. He stood among his bannerkin marked by the same scars, shaped by the same campaigns. He was as much a Lan Kiran as any of them. Giuseppe didn't flinch, and continued: "I know the cost. Without your bannerkirin, without your ordnance, we will stand alone. But I would rather stand here, in Clarionople, than return in shame. If you will grant me leave, I and mine will remain. We will hold this land. In your name, if you allow. In ours, if you will not."\n\nAnd then, slowly, he unwrapped a bundle from his satchel. Within was a sabre, hilt bejeweled, blade worn smooth from sparring. "Clarion gave this to me. Long ago, before she became what history made her. A gift, when I was still learning what it meant to fight beside you. I give it now to you, Prairie, as a memory of her, and as a token of farewell. Let it remind you of her, and of me, when we are gone."\n\nPrairie's composure cracked. The rigid, commanding mask that her sister had worn so well broke. Without thinking, she stepped forward and embraced the griffon, holding him tightly as though anchoring herself against the tide of fate that pulled them apart. "Then stay, Feathered Lance. Stay, and hold this city. But know this: you will be on your own. Alone, in a hostile land. We need every last mare and stallion for the long march home. If you remain, my brother, you may well die here." Giuseppe bowed low, before he straightened himself and chuckled. "That is the idea, yes. Though with luck, it'll be age that claims us, not war." One last salute was exchanged. "Go then, Feathered Lance," said Prairie. "Hold Clarionople in our name.""

KXN_Matriarch_Cult_desc_tt_A:0 "The Matriarch Superior is the voice of Concord; She cannot be fallible under any circumstances. The same cannot be said for the treacherous advisors that surround Her, which are the culprits behind the continued ruin and decrepitude of kirinkind. Heed not their lies and the deluded mystics who claim to be representing the Way of Fire: once their poisonous influence is removed, the Matriarch will be free to guide us properly."
KXN_Matriarch_Cult_desc_tt_B:0 "The Matriarch Superior is the voice of Concord; She cannot be fallible under any circumstances; Her word, the eternal law. To question Her is heresy, and to resist Her will is to resist Concord. Yet She was shackled by traitors — weaklings and cowards who entrapped Her in their web of lies, poisoning Her ears against Her true children.\n\nThe Lan Kir have swept aside those vermin. The Militarchy's Banners have scoured the rot from Vermilion. The Matriarch now speaks with clarity, freed by the hooves and iron of the strong. Kirinity, rejoice! Your Matriarch has been restored to Her rightful glory. It is only through the purifying flame of the Lan Kir that Her Radiance may shine unclouded, and only through their fervour that the Way of Fire may burn pure once again."

### National Focuses ###
KXN_Focus_MILTARCH:0 "Keeping the Long Vigil"
KXN_Focus_MILTARCH_desc:0 "Many kirin would regard us as obsessed maniacs who have strayed far from Concord's grace. Yet it is them who live in poverty, ignorance and squalor, while the Lan Kir maintain the traditions that made kirinkind strong. Thus we must remain vigilant, vigilant and ever more vigilant: it is the only way the Matriarch will bestow upon us Her favour."
KXN_Focus_MILTARCH_1:0 "Observe the Equinox"
KXN_Focus_MILTARCH_1_desc:0 "Far from a mystery, the movement of celestial bodies is predictable and subject to natural laws. On particularly auspicious days, the stars provide us omens, which the learned kirin can interpret as either a portent or blessing. The upcoming equinox, where day and night are in perfect balance, shall reveal our destiny."
KXN_Focus_MILTARCH_2:0 "Rite of Kindling" ## Niriks turn due to strong negative emotions. Rage, Grief, Despair, Desperation. Lan Kir has mastered one more: combining fanatical devotion with single-minded discipline, true mastery of the nirik state, fearless, willing to die, subsume self to sacrifice for cause and Matriarch, ego death.
KXN_Focus_MILTARCH_2_desc:0 "Fire is as much of a purifying force as it is destructive. It drives away the heretical disease, and any collateral damage inflicted is a simple necessary sacrifice.

KXN_Long_Dusk:0 "Long Dusk"
KXN_dusky_daddy_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 31st of July, 947 in Solstice\n\n§YBiography§!: Strong, healthy foals are a sign of Concord's favour, so it was proclaimed when Long Dusk was sired.\n\nThus he was blessed, for the lack of a better word, with his mother's constant demands and lessons. Summer Storm was a peerless example of kirinity: fierce warrior, devoted servant of Concord, knowledgeable in all things a leader of exiled kirin should possess. She expected nothing less from her only child, and while the road was harsh and unforgiving on both body and mind, he succeeded her with great approval of all bannerkirin swearing allegiance to the Lan Kir.\n\nAustere, humourless and rarely tolerating failure, Long Dusk has nonetheless kept the dream alive of restoring the Matriarch's grace upon Her distant children. Actual progress was slow and minimal, but preparations were plentiful and extensive: it will take only a minimal effort to reclaim kirinkind's greatness once the stars align to signal the conflagration's beginning. To this end, he has relentlessly drilled the same sort of affection to his beloved daughters, Clarion Call and Prairie Spark, whom he can rely on most to carry the torch.\n\nFor a harmonious family leads to prosperity in everything, and only together can they realise a vision of greatness.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Rari"
KXN_Clarion_Call:0 "Clarion Call"
KXN_Clarion_Call_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 14th of March, 977 in Solstice\n\n§YBiography§!: There are those whose lives never amount to anything, those who are content to be mediocre, and then there is Clarion Call.\n\nExpectations have always been high for Long Dusk's favoured firstborn, and whereas most would buckle and be swept aside, she excelled in every test given by her mentors. How could she not, when Clarion was told from the early age that she was Concord's chosen to restore the greatness of kirinity? Peerless with a blade, a master strategist, and incredibly steadfast when it comes to controlling the nirik state, it would seem her demanding father created the perfect prodigy.\n\nWhile Clarion takes justified pride in her skill and talent, it came with certain downsides that are not easy to dismiss. It turns out that perfection is like a mountaintop, in the sense of having nokirin to truly relate to outside of her immediate family. The lack of social graces is manageable, but what she truly desires is approval from those same close-knit figures. Long Dusk had never been an approachable or affectionate parent, but her dearest sister, Prairie Spark, had been her foundation in moments of doubt.\n\nOnly together can they burn brightly, for separately they would be reduced to smouldering embers, ashes seeking what remained of the greatest of Valiants.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Rari"
KXN_Prairie_Spark:0 "Prairie Spark"
KXN_Prairie_Spark_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 28th of October, 979 in Solstice\n\n§YBiography§!: Bright flames leave long shadows, and Prairie Spark had often been content to avoid attention.\n\nSeemingly always second best to her older sister, Clarion Call, it could be easily assumed that one would harbour a great deal of resentment for it. Instead, Prairie admired her to no end, for she was perfect in everything, and when she faltered, Prairie would provide comfort. This support was reciprocated, for in the face of their demanding father, failure for one was failure for both.\n\nSecond best is still one of the best, however, and there is no denying Prairie is just as capable in leading the oathsworn bannerkirin. She is simply more cautious, and more heedful that sometimes the direct approach is not the best idea, which is seen by the reckless as a coward's recalcitrance.\n\nThere is no doubt, though, that should Clarion demand it, Prairie would burn the world for her, and she just might accomplish that.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Rari"

Such a catastrophe would deny us the Golden City's unfathomable riches, robbing us of the fruits of our conquest.\n\nOur aerostats have located the pyramidal temple of the priesthood, scouts have identified a way to ford the moat surrounding the City, and our strategists have devised a plan for a small strike force of our most ruthless and cunning bannerkirin to slip into the City undetected. They will fight their way to the temple, and slaughter the priesthood in their beds. With the Thunder Tiger neutralised, a volley of flares will signal the fall of the temple, prompting our forces outside to storm the City. With regard to exfiltration, the strike force will be relieved when the City falls; failing that, they will have given their lives for the glory of Concord."

For a time, it seemed nothing could halt the Lan Kir — until the death of the §ODemon Matriarch§!.\n\nThe §RGreat Shattering§! came without warning. Zebrica rose as one against the nirik scourge. Within a week, all that remained was a scattering of §Pembattled rump states§!, leaving the remnants of Clarion's banners stranded on the far side of a hostile continent. Between them and home lies a continent ablaze, with vengeful enemies lusting for kirin blood at every pass.

lan_kir.1.t:0 "Broken Silence"
lan_kir.1.d:0 ""My daughters." They stood at attention, their discipline instilled over the long years. The Primus Militarch took exceptional pride in that Clarion Call and Prairie Spark did as they were told, with no hesitation. "Have you been assiduous in the tasks I've assigned to you?"\n\nThe elder cast an imperceptible glance to the younger, and Prairie met his eyes. "Yes, father. Since we've received word that the edicts of Silence have been rescinded, the loyal Many have been reinvigorated. This is a clear, Concord-gifted sign that the Matriarch Superior has recognised the folly it brought." It didn't require divine wisdom to know that.\n\n"Why had you made us wait so long, father? You know that long delays are not a tool of the clever!" Clarion made her displeasure clear, and who could blame her? He had been preparing her since foalhood.\n\n"Curb your anger, Clarion. It is correct that the Silence has irreparably damaged the soul of kirinity, and utterly ruined our reputation. Other creatures—", he allowed some of his repressed feelings to emerge, "—knew exactly whom to fear and respect. It would not surprise me in the slightest if Vermillion had become a collection of hovels and beggars." Long Dusk would take a closer look at his prodigies. Clarion seemed eager to immediately right these wrongs, while Prairie gave off an uncertain feeling. They would keep each other in check. "Our flame has only just begun to flicker. See to it that it is stoked to a blaze." Both bowed their heads in respect."

lan_kir.3.t:0 "The Expiation of Fear"
lan_kir.3.d:0 "The Rite of Kindling is not for the faint of spirit. A sacred tradition preserved only among the elite of the Lan Kir, it is equal parts trial, branding, and rebirth. Beneath fluttering banners, flamelight flickered across solemn, scarred faces. The gathered stood motionless, their jaws still stinging from the deliberate and shallow, yet deeply symbolic scar cut beneath the left eye to mark them as vessels of Concord's incandescent wrath. A low chant echoed across the stone plaza, accompanied by the scent of ash and incense. The Expiation of Fear had begun. One by one, each bannerkir stepped forward, a smearing of ceremonial oil still fresh upon their muzzle, to speak aloud the one fear they had never confessed, not even to themselves. Fear of failing the Matriarch or one's banner. Of losing oneself to the nirik state. Of dishonouring their ancestors. Of weakness passed down to one's foals.\n\nClarion Call spoke with cold clarity: "I fear that I will live long enough to see our glory tarnished by the unworthy." Her voice was like tempered steel.\n\nPrairie Spark hesitated. "I fear that we'll burn everything we love in trying to protect it," she admitted, quieter than the rest.\n\nA long silence followed. Clarion's expression didn't change, but her hoof briefly brushed Prairie's flank as she stepped back into formation.\n\nThe confessions were not mocked. They were accepted in solemn silence. In Lan Kir, courage is not the absence of fear — but its mastery. Only by facing what one dreads the most can a valiant truly master it, and themselves.\n\nThen came the final chant, shouted in unison, echoing against blackened stone as the fire danced in the brazier:\n\nIn life there is pain;\nin pain there is rage;\nin rage there is purpose;\nin purpose there is power;\nin power there is glory;"

The Golden Temple priesthood revered her as a living terror, the tooth and claw of the gods.\n\nThe Lan Kir had conquered the land, and Clarion Call would suffer no rival. Now they would conquer its gods. She and Prairie Spark led the hunt themselves, moving silently through knee-deep mire, scouts guiding them to a moonlit clearing baited with fresh zebra carcasses. The ground trembled before the hydra queen's arrival — a slow, sinuous bulk that blotted out the treeline. As Kumakuyag lunged, the clearing erupted in white-hot muzzle-flashes. Anti-tank rifles cracked in disciplined volleys, punching hoof-sized holes through scale and sinew. But every time a head was blasted apart, another lunged forward, snapping, devouring unlucky kirin. Prairie saw it first — the stumps writhed, smoking, and from them, new heads began to bud grotesquely. "Scorch the neck stumps!" she roared. Kiran firelances and firebombs cauterised each neck in turn, until the great body thrashed in the muck, headless, then collapsed in the shallows, the swamp boiling red around her.\n\nThe native zebra watched in stunned silence as their slain god was dragged from the swamp.

The beast was a terror of legend, mane the colour of blood, wings vast as sails, and tail crowned with venom. The crowd of bannerkirin howled in response, hungry for spectacle and blood. Clarion Call descended into the arena, armed with nothing but a long spear gripped in her telekinesis. She fixed the manticore with her gaze and spat into the dust. "Let strength decide who rules. Come and taste my steel, king of beasts."\n\nThe manticore charged, wings snapping wide, claws tearing furrows through the sand. Clarion's spear flashed forward, deflecting his first strike in a shower of sparks. He wheeled, tail whipping, and his stinger cracked like a hammer against her spear, forcing her back. The crowd screamed. Clarion hissed, her mane erupting into white fire as she turned nirik, sparks and flame spilling from her eyes. She met him head-on, her body moving like a dancer's through the storm of talons and teeth. His jaws snapped inches from her throat as she drove her spear up under his ribs, deep into his flesh.\n\n"Kill it!" the bannerkirin screamed. The rest of the manticore clan, snarling and rattling their chains, bayed in grief and fury, awaiting their own slaughter. Clarion lifted her spear to finish what she had begun — and cut him down cleanly, giving the manticore chieftain the warrior's death he demanded. The crowd roared for more. Bannerkirin clamoured for the slaughter of the rest of the manticore clan.\n\nAnd so they did. Clarion raised her spear high, then brought it down in judgement. One by one, the cages were opened, and one by one, the manticores were cut down in a storm of steel and fire. Their roars turned to whimpers, their wings and tails taken as trophies. When the last of the beasts lay slain, Clarion stood over the carnage, her mane still smouldering. She raised her spear high before her roaring host. "No kings but us," she said. "No rivals, mare or beast. Wherever the Lan Kir march, there will be only fire, and only our rule." The bannerkirin thundered in exultation. Moonlight Glow's heir, first sword of Concord, the matriarch beast-slayer — Clarion Call had shown all the world that nothing, not even the beast kings of the deep wilderness, could stand against the destiny of the Lan Kir."

Clarion's eyes blazed, torn between bloodlust and ambition. "Look," Prairie said, pointing. The manticores were bowing. Wings spread, heads lowered, eyes locked on Clarion's hooves. Cowed by the death of their chieftain, they now yielded to his killer as their new alpha. "They are yours, sister." Eventually, Clarion lowered her spear. The bloodlust of the bannerkirin turned to exultation as the cages were thrown open and the manticores knelt to their Primus.

This was a dream long deferred, now made real by steel and sacrifice. The bannerkirin had trained their entire lives in the dense forests and fire-scarred plains of the Zaikirian interior. The sea was but a myth to them, an idea passed down through ancient scripture, weathered maps, and old stories. Almost none had seen it. Until now.\n\nOn the beach, Prairie Spark stood in stunned silence, the roar of the waves in her ears and salt on her lips. She had led the march to the sea, and now she watched her bannerkirin — the same hardened mares and stallions who had swept aside the [KXN_Event_50_state_target.owner.GetAdjective] soldiery — cast aside their helmets and gallop into the surf, laughing. For a moment, even the most disciplined among them were fillies and colts again, overcome by foalish wonder. The surf glittered under the sun like molten silver, stretching far beyond sight, infinite and untamed. It was unlike anything she had imagined.\n\nClarion Call stepped beside her, expression unreadable. "You're staring," she remarked. "I've never seen anything so... enormous," Prairie replied softly. "And loud. It's loud."\n\nClarion tilted her head. "You grew up with artillery drills. You're afraid of waves?" "I'm not afraid," Prairie said, too quickly. Then, sheepishly: "Maybe a little. Of how it makes me feel."\n\nThey fell silent as bannerkirin in soaked uniforms splashed into the waves. Somekirin shouted with joy. For once, Clarion didn't call them to order.\n\n"It's beautiful," Prairie whispered. Clarion nodded, still watching the sea. "Yes. I want to keep it."\n\nThen the bark of mortars in the distance shattered the moment, putting an end to the reverie. Incoming shells began to fall, churning the sand and turning the seafoam crimson. The enemy had regrouped, and they were not about to let the Lan Kir bask in joy. Shouts rang out, orders barked. Clarion's blade was out in an instant, her serenity gone like smoke, eyes aflame. Prairie crouched low, hooves moving on instinct. "Guess the ocean doesn't love us back," she muttered.\n\nClarion didn't look back. "Then we'll take it anyway.""

Reaching Clarion Call's command tent, he executed an awkward, flapping bow and announced himself — loudly. "I am Giuseppe Georginio! I come from Wingbardy! I bring... boom."\n\nClarion, utterly unbothered, gave him a long, level look. Prairie Spark, seated beside her, blinked twice. "Explain," Clarion said. "I read of Lan Kir. Long history. Much inspiration. You have — how you say — 'honour through kaboom'? Yes?" He grinned, then added, "I was artillery officer. Trained in Yalish school. Boring! I want adventure. I cross sea. I find glory. I train you."\n\n"You came halfway across the world... to teach us artillery?" Prairie asked, incredulously. Giuseppe puffed his chest out proudly. "Lan Kir fight like inferno. I want to burn, too." He continued: "I learn your history. Read much scroll. So much honour, real fire inside. Not fake 'Way of Fire' mumbo. That is tourist mystic trash! But Lan Kir? Real stuff. Sacred! I even — look, look..."\n\nHe jabbed a talon toward a red, swollen scar under his eye. "I give myself scar. Painful, yes. But pain is meaning, no? I read this. You say it. 'In life is pain! Rage! Purpose!' All that!" Prairie winced. "That's... very infected."\n\nClarion stood, circling him slowly with a calculating eye. "Spin," she commanded. Giuseppe blinked. "... Spin?" "Turn," Clarion said. Giuseppe obeyed, wings spread, feathers slightly ruffled from the journey. A few bannerkirin in the tent gasped, either in awe or confusion.\n\n"Your wings are strong and intact," Clarion said, "and you don't smell like cowardice. Very well." She stepped forward. "From this day, you will be known as Feathered Lance, master of fire, feather, and fury. You will serve as my commander of artillery." Giuseppe looked up in shock, then bowed. "Truly?" Clarion nodded. "You came with skill and story. That is more than most. We will give you a proper Lan Kiran blade. We'll adjust the hilt for your claws.

The Lan Kir, distant kin and wayward descendants of Concord, have swept across the savannahs and coasts like wildfire — waging a war of conquest, enthroning themselves as sovereigns, and raising their banners over subjugated creatures. Whispers of atrocities trail behind them: massacres, pillage, compelled harmony at the point of a blade. What chills Rain Shine more than their savagery is their certainty — that they act in her name. A dragonfire candle is lit, its flame green and accusing. A missive directed to the fortress-monastery of Solstice: Militarch Long Dusk must answer for these actions. If their loyalty to the Matriarch Superior is more than a banner for war, they will heed the summons. If not... Kiria must prepare for worse."

Enclosed within: an official reprimand from Vermilion, penned in ornate calligraphy, accusing the Lan Kir of unsanctioned conquest, of barbarity, of violating the sacred harmonic teaching of Concord. With the reprimand came demands. Cease our campaigning. Lay down our weapons. Send Long Dusk to Vermilion to answer for so-called 'atrocities'.\n\nMilitarch Long Dusk read the letter aloud before the assembled bannerkirin commanders in his field tent. "They accuse us of butchery," he announced, "and ask that I submit myself to Vermilion for judgement. As if I were a dog." Among the bannerkirin, unrest simmers. Nominally loyal subjects of the Matriarch Superior, Her silence till now was taken as tacit approval — was it not She who blessed our steel with fire?\n\nTo maintain cohesion, Clarion Call delivers an emergency address to the rank and file. With impassioned precision, she weaves a narrative: that the Matriarch Superior is under siege, misled by sycophantic cowards and weaklings who fear the flame of true devotion. That this missive is not Her true voice, but that of Her jailors. And that it is the duty of the faithful to correct such a grave error.\n\nThe army listens, entranced."

And the armies of Lan Kir have only pressed further since.\n\nIn the Imperial Palace, Rain Shine paces in measured, gliding steps as her advisers debate. At last, she speaks: "Let no kirin say Vermilion acts rashly".\n\nA second message is prepared — longer, more detailed, and less forgiving. This time it will not travel by dragonfire, but by hoof.\n\nA Vermilion Herald is chosen, cloaked in the red and gold of the Matriarchal Retinue. The missive they carry restates the demands: that Militarch Long Dusk cease all military action and present himself before the Vermilion Court. But this time, the missive also includes a clear warning: failure to comply will be interpreted as defiance — not merely of Rain Shine, but of Concord Herself.

Cease your campaigning, disband your war host, and account for your savagery before Her court. Failure to comply will be taken as open defiance. This," he says, "is the Matriarch's will. Will you answer Her, or must we assume you no longer hear Her voice?" The words hang in the air like an unsheathed blade. Bannerkirin crowd the edges of the confrontation, their eyes narrowing at the Vermilion Herald, flanked by the crimson-clad bannerkir of the Matriarchal Retinue. Clarion Call stands at Long Dusk's side, her horn alight with restrained fire, but no order to attack is given.\n\nLong Dusk's answer is silence — a refusal by omission. Clarion steps forward instead, voice like cold steel: "The Matriarch's will is Concord. The conflagration we stoke is for the glory of Concord. If you would call that heresy, then you do not know Her at all."\n\nThe Herald and his escort withdraw under a chorus of muttered cursing, and more than one hoof reached for a weapon as they pass. The Lan Kir let them go without harm, though the tension is thick enough to choke on.\n\nIn the evening, the High Generalarchate gathered the host. The Militarch spoke not of rebellion, but of fidelity — claiming that the Herald's declaration was the product of corruption in Vermilion, and that Rain Shine is blind, her court a nest of weakness and scheming. Her divine will has been perverted by a cowardly conspiracy of those who fear strength. It is the Lan Kir's mission that remains true to Concord's incandescent glory. The second medallion, they said, is not condemnation, but a challenge to remain steadfast.\n\nThe bannerkirin's resolve is unwavering. For now."

The Lan Kir march ever onward, leaving a trail of fire and death in their wake, and still they claim to serve Concord. The Matriarch's patience is not without limit. Rain Shine's cabinet argued in the candlelit court chamber of the Vermilion Palace. Some urged war at once, but the Matriarch herself ordered one final attempt — not out of weakness, but to make clear before all kirinity that the Lan Kir's rebellion was of their own choosing.\n\nThis time, the message will not travel alone. A Vermilion Herald will set forth again, but under the protection of the best of Rain Shine's own Matriarchal Retinue — those sworn to her personal protection and trusted with her life. Their armor, lacquered crimson and gold, speak as loudly as any command; their mere presence a reminder that the Matriarch's will is not to be taken lightly. When they reach Solstice, they will join up with the Vermilion Plenipotentiary to the Lan Kir, Silver Chime, whose voice is laden with the full authority of the Vermilion Court. Together, they will confront Long Dusk and place before him the Matriarch Superior's final ultimatum.\n\nThis will be no quiet parley, no polite exchange of courtesy. It will be the last warning before words give way to steel. Even as they depart, the Realm begin to prepare for war — a mobilisation order is quietly inked, the supply network reviewed, the Vermilion Banner Army brought to military readiness. If the Lan Kir will not bow to Vermilion's voice, they may soon face her sword."

At their head trotted the Vermilion Herald and Silver Chime, the Matriarch's Plenipotentiary to the Lan Kir, who had apparently slipped out undetected from her closely-surveilled compound in Solstice. The two emissaries moved with deliberate imperiousness through the camp, their armed entourage forming a bristling wall of armour and weaponry around them against the gathering crowd of hostile Lan Kir bannerkirin.\n\nThere would be no ritual formality or decorum. In Long Dusk's command tent, Silver Chime stepped forward, unfastened a pouch, and let a gilded medallion fall to the ground between them, the emblem of the Matriarch Superior catching the firelight.\n\n"Militarch Long Dusk," she declared, her voice carrying over the murmur of the gathering crowd, "by the will of Matriarch Superior Rain Shine, you are hereby summoned to Vermilion to answer for your crimes — the slaughter, the pillage, the violation of Concord's sacred scripture. You will present yourself before Her court by month's end."\n\nThe ring of onlookers swelled — grim-faced bannerkirin, muttering, stamping, their anger barely leashed. Only the Retinue's implacable presence and the sight of the Matriarchal crest upon their armor kept the crowd from drawing steel. They were the Matriarch's own, and even the boldest of the Lan Kir hesitated to strike them. For now. The bannerkirin looked to Long Dusk — to see if their Militarch would kneel, or if the path ahead would be war.\n\nLong Dusk's eyes never left Silver Chime. Every word, every silence in that moment would be remembered. One choice would define what came next."

lan_kir.199.t:0 "The Better Part of Valour"
lan_kir.199.d:0 "The camp was silent long after the Vermilion Herald and Silver Chime departed, escorted by the Matriarchal Retinue. Long Dusk had ordered the medallion retrieved from the dust, returning it to the Herald with clipped words about "logistical timing" and "clarifying the will of the Matriarch" — and a promise to "duly consider Her word" rather than an outright refusal. It was enough to spare the emissaries from immediate violence, but in the eyes of many bannerkirin, it reeked of hesitation.\n\nAmong the rank and file, the damage was done, discontent spreading like wildfire. Had the Militarch bent the knee to Vermilion, leaving their humiliating condescension unanswered? Was the iron will that had propelled the Lan Kir across Zebrica now blunted by cowardice and fear? Bannerkir loyal to Long Dusk spoke of strategy, of buying time to prepare for the inevitable war. Yet in the hearts of those raised on fire and conquest, the doubt festered. Was the Matriarch truly against them? Or was their leader losing his nerve?\n\nThe truth was crueler still: every heartbeat bought by delay also frayed the legend of the Lan Kir's invincibility. And to the north, the Matriarch's court would be weighing that same hesitation, deciding if it marked prudence... or weakness. Before the High Generalarchate, Long Dusk declaimed at great length on tactical necessity: the importance of carving out breathing space to marshal their strength, gauge enemy intent, and choose the terrain on which to fight. Yet even the most loyal bannerkirin could feel it — the ruse was fraying, and sooner or later, Vermilion's banners would be on the march."
lan_kir.199.a:0 "Sharpen your blade. Sooner or later, they will come."

lan_kir.200.t:0 "First Blood"
lan_kir.200.d:0 "The medallion struck the dirt.\n\n"My answer," Long Dusk said, "is the same iron law Moonlight Glow taught the first of the Lan Kir. To rule is the right of the strong. To obey is the lot of the weak. We are strong. And you are weak." Then, without a further word, he drove his blade through the Herald's throat. The camp erupted into an orgy of bloodshed. The Matriarchal Retinue formed up into a defensive ring around Silver Chime, but the Lan Kir bannerkirin cut them down in a storm of flame and steel. The hoof-to-hoof combat is frenzied and brutal. Clarion Call, hurling herself into the fray, is speared through the flank; Long Dusk, fighting alongside his daugher, is slashed across the muzzle by a nimble Kirian valiant before she is gutted by a bayonet. When the killing is over, the gilded medallion is trampled into the mud, glinting faintly beneath a crust of dried blood.\n\nThat night, Long Dusk convenes the High Generalarchate. "The Matriarch's mind is poisoned," he declares. "Rain Shine has been deceived. If we do not march on Vermilion, She and Concord will be lost to us — and to all of kirinity. We must free the Matriarch from the treacherous grip of Her own court."\n\nMurmurs rippled through the tent — not of doubt, but of grim approval. The smell of iron still clung to their nostrils from the slaughter, and their eyes burned in the lamplight. Clarion Call, still pale from blood loss, forced herself to her hooves. "Vermilion calls us butchers. Let them. They will see the truth when we stand in the Matriarch's court and lay her false counsellors at her hooves — in chains, or in pieces."\n\nA ripple of low laughter passed among the officers, but not all joined in. Wildfire Flourish leaned forward, eyes narrowing. "And the rank and file? The Matriarch's seal is not something they'll forget seeing trampled." Long Dusk slammed his hoof onto the table. "They will forget nothing — they will understand. We are not traitors to Concord. We are Her last defenders." He looked to each bannerkirin in turn. "The banner host will march at dawn. Kiria will be our next conquest." Outside, the war drums began to beat."

lan_kir.201.t:0 "A Death in Vermilion"
lan_kir.201.d:0 "It happened in the heart of Vermilion, under the roof of the Imperial Palace. Primus Militarch Long Dusk had just returned from an evening trot when the assassins struck — a stay-behind valiant hit squad belonging to the Banner of the Covered Cage, sworn enemies of the Lan Kir since the Silence. The first strike opened his foreleg, severing tendon and muscle. The second found his ribs. The blade had been poisoned. It was no common toxin, but distilled frostfire, an alchemical compound made from the Foal's Breath flower designed to choke the nirik spark before it could kindle. In his dying moments, Long Dusk would have felt the cold crawl through his veins, his inner fire guttering, his fury smothered out.\n\nBut Long Dusk did not go quietly. He fought like a demon, hurling one assassin down a flight of stairs, crushing another's skull with his hooves, and tore the throat from a third with his teeth. But the fourth shot him clean through his breastplate, and with Long Dusk's magic extinguished by the frostfire, his strength ebbed. By the time his personal guard burst in, the Primus Militarch lay dead, one hoof still wrapped around the throat of the last assassin he'd killed.\n\nBy nightfall, the city burned with the vengeance of the Lan Kir. Dozens of hostages were put to the sword. It took the assassins who had been captured three days to perish, their agony on public display all the while.\n\nThe funeral was a spectacle of iron discipline. Every bannerkirin stood at rigid attention as Long Dusk's body was laid upon a great pyre, clad in his armour and regalia. It took three hours before the last of the funereal smoke dissipated into the night sky. Prairie Spark had wept in silence. Clarion Call did not — her eyes were fixed, cold and unblinking on the city's skyline. In the silence after the flames died, she spoke only once:"
lan_kir.201.a:0 ""This will not go unanswered.""

lan_kir.202.t:0 "Sound the Drums of War"
lan_kir.202.d:0 "The drumming began before dawn, low and steady, rolling over the city like the distant growl of an oncoming storm. The air still smelled faintly of ash from the funeral pyre — the last trace of Primus Militarch Long Dusk, father, conqueror, and martyr. The bannerkirin stood in silent formation, shoulder to shoulder, their breath hissing through teeth clenched with grief and rage.\n\nClarion Call mounted the obsidian dais without ceremony. At her side hung her father's blade, its edge still sharp and gleaming. She stood a long moment, letting the drumming and the Lan Kir's synchronised breathing fill the silence. Prairie Spark stood behind her, pale and still, eyes moving like a sentry scanning for danger. Clarion did not speak at first. She thrust the sword skyward, and a ripple passed through the host as ten thousand bannerkirin stood to attention. The drumming ceased in perfect unison.\n\n"The injustice foisted upon us," she said, her voice carrying like a trumpet over the silent host, "we do not bemoan, but pay back in kind. Those who would see kirinity destroyed revel in our sorrow. They say our Primus got what he deserved, and celebrate his death as their salvation." Clarion drove the sword into the stone, sparks spitting from the impact. "They sought to quench the flame of the Lan Kir. But here we stand — brighter, fiercer, hungrier. My father's death will not be our end. It will be our proving."\n\nThe host began to stamp their hooves in rhythm, the sound like a rolling thunderclap. Clarion paced the dais, eyes locked on the massed ranks below. "They call us barbarous. But is it barbarity to survive? They call us butchers. But is it butchery to put to the sword those who would see kirinity strangled in its crib?" Prairie's gaze swept the crowd. She could see it — the way Clarion's words lit an inferno in their eyes. Even in grief, they looked ready to tear the world apart. Clarion turned back to the crowd, her mane now ablaze in a halo of fire. "The world is a pyre," she said, voice low at first, drawing them in. Then, with the force of a battle cry: "And we are the spark! Go forth, Lan Kir, and conquer!"\n\nA roar answered her — wordless, furious, exultant, a tidal wave of sound and heat, of manes igniting, of steel striking steel in frenzied salute. Somewhere in the mass, a chant began:\n\n"Clarion!" somekirin shouted. "PRIMUS!" the crowd answered. "CLARION! PRIMUS! CLARION! PRIMUS!" they roared, a wall of sound shaking the square. Prairie stood in the shadow of her sister, feeling the heat, the certainty, the unstoppable momentum. And she wondered — quietly, privately — if the Lan Kir would survive the blaze Clarion had just lit."

Their cause is righteous — to free the Matriarch Superior from her corrupt and decadent court. Yet make no mistake: this is treason against the Matriarchate. For the first time, the Lan Kir march against Vermilion.\n\nWhen the first of the Lan Kir emerge on the far bank, they stand upon Kirian soil. There is no turning back.

No doors were kicked in, no buildings set aflame. Patrols posted themselves at intersections, politely but firmly directing civilians to remain indoors. On the steps of the Imperial Palace, Long Dusk turned to Prairie Spark. "We could take everything," he murmured. Prairie shook her head. "And then we would own nothing. Let them see we are not beasts. Let them fear our restraint as much as our fury."\n\nLong Dusk gave the order. No blood shall be spilled. No treasure shall be taken. The Lan Kir would enter no home, harm no civilian, and take nothing that was not surrendered. The kirin of Vermilion watched from shuttered windows as their conquerors passed, silent and austere. Whispers spread that perhaps the Lan Kir were not the butchers the court had claimed — at least, not today. To the conquered, it was mercy. To the Lan Kir, it was discipline — and discipline was another name for control."

The banners of Lan Kir fluttered proudly from shattered columns, while the last of the surviving palace staff skittered like frightened vermin beneath the hooves of bannerkirin now encamped in its marbled halls. Prairie Spark and Clarion Call moved as one, hoofsteps echoing through the ruined grandeur. They passed frescoes cracked by shellfire and statuary blackened by nirik flame. At the end of a scorched hallway, a steel vault door groaned open under the attention of Lan Kiran artificers. Ancient wards had been broken, physical locks shattered. Within, amidst velvet-lined cases and relics of near-myth, lay what they had sought: a slender crescent forged of meteoric iron, its surface flawless, curved edge gleaming with a mournful light.\n\n"The Dawn Sliver," one of the artificers whispered, reverent. Clarion stepped forward. Her telekinesis caressed the hiltless blade. She swung it in a slow, testing arc through the air — and the blade sang. "Autumn Sun's own," Clarion murmured. "So much done with so little ornament. He could have conquered the world with this blade."\n\nPrairie Spark stood behind her, gaze fixed not on the blade but on her sister's expression — intense, unblinking, something feral stirring in her soul. "They say," Prairie said slowly, "that Autumn Sun, First Sword of the First Matriarch, struck down Scarlet Crucible last with that blade. She was his friend. A fellow sworn companion of Incandescent Dawn. They say they both gave in to their bloodlust, from which only Autumn Sun awoke. After that," Prairie continued, "he renounced the sword. Became a monk. Hid from what he'd done."\n\n"Because he was weak," Clarion said. "He mistook self-denial for virtue." "No," Prairie said. "He knew how the Dawn Sliver channelled his nirik fury into inequine strength, and how this fury consumed more of his soul each time. He was afraid of what he might become next."\n\nClarion didn't respond. She stared at the Sliver as if looking for Concord's reflection along its polished edge.

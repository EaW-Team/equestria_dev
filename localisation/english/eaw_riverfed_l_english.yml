 #### IDEAS ####
 RIV_member_state:0 "Treaty of Coltstream Member"
 RIV_member_state_desc:0 "This state has signed the Treaty of Coltstream. In 898 the River Coalition was founded, following Emperor Grover II's destructive invasion and the continuous raids by neighbouring griffons and deer. The founding members of the treaty were Lake City, Bakara, River Republic and Nimbusia. Although the treaty has been mainly a defensive alliance since its inception, some politicians and their supporters advocate to expand the treaty to allow for more cooperation between the states of the River Coalition.\n\n§YThe River Coalition is primarily a defensive alliance. Therefore, member states cannot join offensive wars unless they are waged by the Coalition leader.§!"
 RIV_rcsc_member:0 "RCSC Member"
 RIV_rcsc_member_desc:0 "This State has signed the Treaty of Coltstream and has opted into the River Coal and Steel Community. Hailed as an inventive solution to solve rivalry between the states of the Coalition, the RCSC has pooled the markets for coal and steel, the prime resources for warfare. The member states have given authority over these markets to a Coalition oversight committee. By interlinking the industries of warfare between the member states, the RCSC hopes to prevent conflict between its members.\n\n§YThe River Coalition is primarily a defensive alliance. Therefore, member states cannot join offensive wars unless they are waged by the Coalition leader.§!"
 RIV_rec_member:0 "REC Member"
 RIV_rec_member_desc:0 "This state is a member of the River Economic Community, the successor to the RCSC. The REC has pledged to go beyond just Coal and Steel and incorporate the entire economy. By slashing tariffs between the member states and encouraging and equal playing field for competition, the smaller member states hope to compete against countries with bigger markets. This has meant more authority has flowed to the oversight committee and away from the national governments.\n\n§YThe River Coalition is primarily a defensive alliance. Therefore, member states cannot join offensive wars unless they are waged by the Coalition leader.§!"
 RIV_river_union_member:0 "River Union Member State"
 RIV_river_union_member_desc:0 "This state is a member of the River Union, the successor to the REC. The Union is much more centralised than its predecessor and has taken responsibility for all sorts of policy areas. Much speculation abounds when the United Parliament will push for more centralisation, which might lead to a full-fledged federation."
 RIV_rdc:0 "River Development Company"
 RIV_rdc_desc:0 "Although in the past the Coalition has done much to develop their neighbours, the help has been undirected and decentralised. To help guide the good intentions of the Coalition to where they are most needed, the River Development Company has been founded. Consolidating funds and experts from all the member states, the RDC uses their assets to help the construction of new factories, highways, bridges and dockyards."
 RIV_beings_rights_idea:0 "River Convention on Racial Tolerance"
 RIV_beings_rights_idea_desc:0 "This nation is a signatory of the River Convention on Racial Tolerance, committing to the elimination on racial discrimination and striving to promote understanding between all races of the Coalition."
 RIV_development_grants_idea:0 "River Development Grants"
 RIV_development_grants_idea_desc:0 "This nation has received generous development grants from the River Coalition, aimed at improving their underdeveloped economy."
 RIV_centeral_bank_idea:0 "River Central Bank"
 RIV_centeral_bank_idea_desc:0 "For monetary matters, the River Central Bank coordinates our own Central Bank, as well as those of our friends. This will help to keep rampant inflation at bay and ensure that there is always enough money to go around."
 RIV_rivbit_idea:0 "The Rivbit"
 RIV_rivbit_idea_desc:0 "We are a member of the single currency area and have replaced our own coins with the Rivbit! This has increased both tourism and international trade and has further stabilised our economy."
 RIV_river_army_idea:0 "The River Army"
 RIV_river_army_idea_desc:0 "We have integrated our armed forces with the River Army. Although the armies of the different states are still formally under the control of their own governments, the River Army Command coordinates and directs the armed forces from now on."
 RIV_LCT_bonus:0 "Lake City Industrialists"
 RIV_RCT_bonus:0 "River Republic Merchants"
 RIV_NIM_bonus:0 "Nimbusian General Staff"
 RIV_WIT_bonus:0 "Wittenlandic Mages"
 RIV_BAK_bonus:0 "Bakaran Sailors"
 RIV_DEP_bonus:0 "Deponyan Farmers"
 RIV_FRE_bonus:0 "Pònaidh Artisans"
 RIV_DMT_bonus:0 "Diamond Dog Miners"
 RIV_leader_surrender_bonus:0 "River Coalition Leader Surrender Blocker"
 
 #### FOCUS ####
 RIV_dreams_of_a_federation:0 "Dreams of a Federation"
 RIV_dreams_of_a_federation_desc:0 "The Treaty of Coltstream was designed in such a way that the coalition members could choose to expand the treaty to certain policy areas. It is a far cry from true political unity, but by breaking open discussion about expanding the treaty, we might be able to set a step in the direction of a true River Federation."
 
 RIV_science_society:0 "River Science Society"
 RIV_science_society_desc:0 "The different countries that comprise the treaty all have their own universities with their own expertise. Encouraging an exchange of knowledge and of students themselves will help all member states to broaden their horizons and push the boundaries of science towards the modern age."
 
 RIV_found_the_rcsc:0 "The River Coal and Steel Community"
 RIV_found_the_rcsc_desc:0 "Initially proposed by the foreign minister of the River Republic Calm Current, the River Coal and Steel Community (RCSC) will be an organisation to regulate the industrial production of all Riverland states. The goal of this is to ensure continued peace and cooperation between all member states by creating a common market for coal and steel, thus neutralising competition over resources."
 
 RIV_develop_DEP:0 "Invest in Deponya"
 RIV_develop_DEP_desc:0 "Deponya is one of the less developed members of the treaty. To strengthen our relations with them and to make our ally able to contribute more to the alliance, we can invest in Deponya. Purchasing a significant patch of forest for industrial development will surely help our friends along!"
 
 RIV_build_roads_in_DEP:0 "Build Roads in Deponya"
 RIV_build_roads_in_DEP_desc:0 "Deponya shares a border with griffon territory, but their borderlands lack proper infrastructure. If the Coalition is to properly defend themselves against any sudden threats, our forces should be able to quickly move towards the border. Deponya lacks sufficient industrial capacity to do undertake a large public works effort in the area, so it is up to us to prepare the borderlands for military manoeuvres."

 RIV_development_grants_DEP:0 "Development Grants for Deponya"
 RIV_development_grants_DEP_desc:0 "More must be done to lift the state of Deponya up to the level of the rest of the Coalition. We will make development grants available to their government. The Deponyans might be a bit clingy towards their traditions, but with enough compensation, even they might see the value in progress!"

 RIV_develop_FRE:0 "Invest in Pònaidhean"
 RIV_develop_FRE_desc:0 "Pònaidhean is one of the weaker members of the Coalition. Their country consists mostly of rugged highlands. By investing in large scale excavation, we can make a larger part of the country actually fit for industrialisation. Surely the tribes will enjoy their newfound wealth." 
  
 RIV_build_roads_in_FRE:0 "Build Roads in Pònaidhean"
 RIV_build_roads_in_FRE_desc:0 "Pònaidhean shares a border with the deer clans to the south. The exact motives of these creatures are unknown to us, but it wouldn't hurt to prepare infrastructure in the area, in case large troop movements are required. Who knows, maybe this will help bring Pònaidhean's tribes closer together?"
 
 RIV_development_grants_FRE:0 "Development Grants in Pònaidhean"
 RIV_development_grants_FRE_desc:0 "More must be done to lift the state of Pònaidhean up to the level of the rest of the Coalition. We will make development grants available to their government. Some Pònaidheans might prefer to stay as isolated tribes, but they will soon see the value of cooperation!"

 RIV_found_the_rdc:0 "The River Development Company"
 RIV_found_the_rdc_desc:0 "The Coalition has, informally, done much to develop the most backward member nations. To formalise this development, we will create an independent River Development Company. We will give them the experts and funding they need to develop industry and infrastructure for the entire Coalition. If we get all our friends to help, we will all benefit!"

 RIV_found_the_rec:0 "The River Economic Community"
 RIV_found_the_rec_desc:0 "The RCSC has been a resounding success. We must now push forward and try to integrate more sections of the economy. This will make our economies less dependent on the outside and more resilient. To help in this plan we shall propose that the RCSC will be transformed into the River Economic Community. It is time to call for another treaty conference!"

 RIV_social_fund:0 "Establish a Social Fund"
 RIV_social_fund_desc:0 "The differences between labour laws and social security between the different member states is a cause for concern. We cannot integrate our economies while our social programs remain different. To curtail the worst situations, we will establish the Social Fund to protect workers from all member states."

 RIV_rdc_rail_projects:0 "RDC Road Projects"
 RIV_rdc_rail_projects_desc:0 "The RDC has made it their mission to connect the many far-flung places in Eastern Griffonia. By inviting their engineers we will be able to connect our hinterlands together. We have but to draft an official plan and send a request to the Company."

 RIV_eastern_transport_fund:0 "Fund RiverTrans"
 RIV_eastern_transport_fund_desc:0 "RiverTrans is a proposal by the River Development Company to increase connectivity across the member states by making an international transportation company. RiverTrans will develop the traditionally neglected border roads to ensure that it is as easy to travel between countries as it is within countries. "

 RIV_beings_rights:0 "Write the Convention on Racial Tolerance"
 RIV_beings_rights_desc:0 "The River Coalition has creatures of many different races living within its member states. Not only various equine races, but diamond dogs as well. To show that the River Coalition is happy to accept all races into its ranks, be they changelings, deer or even griffons, we should draft the Convention on Racial Tolerance, aimed at promoting equality between races."

 RIV_river_parliament:0 "Found the River Parliament"
 RIV_river_parliament_desc:0 "The Integration of the Riverlands is not a project of the elites alone. We must be sure to keep the citizens involved as well. A directly elected parliament of the River Community shall be created. By giving this parliament a say in some matters that concern the entire Community, we are sure to increase popular support for more integration."

 RIV_rdc_industry_projects:0 "RDC Industrial Projects"
 RIV_rdc_industry_projects_desc:0 "One of the RDC's primary goals is increasing economic growth. By opening up new industrial sectors and guaranteeing the invesment from private individuals, the Company increases industrial capacity. We can make use of their services ourselves, granting us an expansion in industrial capacity."

 RIV_rdc_local_investment_funds:0 "RDC Investment Funds"
 RIV_rdc_local_investment_funds_desc:0 "The RDC has large sums available to invest in regional projects. We could spend some time to lobby the Company so that they invest more into our country. Not only might this help our industry, it may help to convince our population that the continued integration of the Riverlands is beneficial for our country."
 
 RIV_develop_friends:0 "Send Delegations to the Northern Ponies"
 RIV_develop_friends_desc:0 "The isolated Northern Ponies are a somewhat unknown factor to us. But most of the ponies in the Coalition see them as their long lost cousins either way. It is time to send some delegates and some precious gifts to these pony states so we can open up diplomatic contact."

 RIV_develop_firtree:0 "Assist Firtree"
 RIV_develop_firtree_desc:0 "The Firtree Villages are an agrarian society who have yet to fully industrialise. We can use the development grant program to help the Bonedrift government along. Perhaps if we show the ponies of Firtree our generosity, they will want to be our friends."

 RIV_develop_farbrook:0 "Assist Farbrook"
 RIV_develop_farbrook_desc:0 "Farbrook is the largest of the Northern Pony states, but the ponies there don't have it any better when it comes to their industry, being, as with the rest of the North, largely agrarian. If we assist the ponies of Farbrook, surely they will want to stick with us!"

 RIV_develop_watertowns:0 "Assist the Watertowns"
 RIV_develop_watertowns_desc:0 "We heard stories of the legendary Holy Springs near the Watertowns. However, its healing waters seems to be about the only thing the small state has going for it. By assisting the Watertowns with industrial aid, they might be willing to establish closer ties with us."

 RIV_friends_with_greneclyf:0 "Send an Emissary to the Changelings"
 RIV_friends_with_greneclyf_desc:0 "Off the coast lies an island inhabited by strange creatures called Changelings. They surely look more like ponies than the griffons do and we have heard stories about their Queen treading the path of Harmony. Perhaps if we reach out to them, we will be able to make an unlikely friend?"

 RIV_expand_the_federation:0 "Offer Membership to the North"
 RIV_expand_the_federation_desc:0 "Much has been done to improve ties between the Riverlands and the northern pony states. Emissaries have even been sent to the changelings of Greneclyf. It is time to go even farther and formally ask these states to join the Treaty of Coltstream!"

 RIV_free_movement:0 "A Free Travel Area"
 RIV_free_movement_desc:0 "If our economies are to be integrated, it makes no sense that goods and people can't easily travel between the member states of the REC. We will propose a Free Travel Area between the countries, so that all our citizens can freely move around. This will surely help economic growth. With luck, it will also help create understanding between all the different inhabitants of the Community."

 RIV_centeral_bank:0 "River Central Bank"
 RIV_centeral_bank_desc:0 "To control the monetary matters of the Community, we must coordinate the efforts of the national banks of the member states. A supranational Central River Bank will make sure that the all national banks play fair. If we push this idea, perhaps we can deliver the Bank's first President, increasing our power in the expanding intergovernmental bureaucracy."

 RIV_the_rivbit:0 "The Rivbit"
 RIV_the_rivbit_desc:0 "It is a very annoying matter to exchange currency whenever you go abroad. This matter is even worse for companies that trade in several of the member states. To show both political unity and to help improve trade between the Community Members, let us propose a single currency, the Rivbit!"

 RIV_the_river_union:0 "The River Union"
 RIV_the_river_union_desc:0 "There has been a wild growth of institutions, objectives and laws regarding the River Economic Community. We will need a new treaty conference to make sense of it all and to untangle the bureaucratic mess we have created. With a free trade area, free travel and a single currency, we will be able to proudly call ourselves The River Union now!"

 RIV_river_army:0 "The River Army"
 RIV_river_army_desc:0 "The Riverlands have stood side-by-side against foreign invaders for centuries. Having a unified River Army would help ensure the everlasting safety and security of the Union whilst helping pushing down the cost of defence for our member states. In addition, by integrating and more closely linking the armies together, we can expand our own international influence."

 RIV_river_government:0 "A United River Government"
 RIV_river_government_desc:0 "It is time to reconsider the sovereignty of the national governments. The River Union has proven way more competent in dealing with issues than the squabbling national governments. We will pressure them into giving up their veto for changing the Treaty of Coltstream, effectively remodelling the River Commission into a united River Government."

 RIV_the_federation:0 "The River Federation"
 RIV_the_federation_desc:0 "After years of gradual integration, the River Union now finds itself ready to take the last step towards Federalisation. By officially declaring the River Government sovereign over the Riverlands, the member states of the Coalition will cease to exist as separate entities on the world stage. A dream for many, the River Federation will rise in their place as a global superpower."

 RIV_pacify_the_north:0 "Pacify the North"
 RIV_pacify_the_north_desc:0 "Some of the Northern ponies have strayed from the path of Harmony. We must intervene to protect the citizens of the north against their own government. The River Federation will not tolerate any threats near its borders. We will bring Harmony and democracy to the Riverlands, by any means necessary"

 RIV_pacify_the_south:0 "Pacify the South"
 RIV_pacify_the_south_desc:0 "Deer, Zebra, Mages. Strange states that should not be there rule the lands to the South of the River Federation. We must bring these lands under our protection so that the Federation is safe from threats from within or without."

 RIV_atomic_energy_community:0 "Found RIVATOM"
 RIV_atomic_energy_community_desc:0 "We have learned of the wonderful abilities that magical crystals hold. Untold power in the very bonds between magic and substancce. We will fund a federal research organisation to study these crystals and make the findings available to the Federal Government, and especially the military."

 #### EVENT ####
 riverfed.1.t:0 "The River Society of Science"
 riverfed.1.d:0 "[From.GetName] has proposed a student exchange program along with a permanent knowledge sharing initiative. This River Society of Science, will help to improve learning throughout the Riverlands. Although the plan would benefit our country, some nationalists are concerned about sharing our technology with foreigners, even if they are our friends."
 riverfed.1.a:0 "A brilliant idea!"
 riverfed.1.b:0 "We will not share our knowledge with anyone."
 
 riverfed.2.t:0 "The River Coal and Steel Community"
 riverfed.2.d:0 "[From.GetName] has proposed a plan they call the River Coal and Steel Community. With it, we will share the base raw materials between our coalition members more fairly and with less competition. An additional idea is to prevent war between members of the coalition by putting control over the resources required for warfare in the control of a supranational committee. This committee would be chaired by independent experts.\n\nAlthough these plans could improve our economy and many of our citizens sympathise with the idea of stopping warfare between members of the Coalition, giving up control over our resources to some outside 'experts' is an unprecedented step."
 riverfed.2.a:0 "With this, we will secure peace!"
 riverfed.2.b:0 "We refuse to give over sovereignty to this committee."
 
 riverfed.3.t:0 "[From.GetName] has aided our Industry"
 riverfed.3.d:0 "[From.GetName] has built a factory for us to help us along with our industrialisation efforts. With state of the art machines they cleared a large plot of land for development and even funded construction of a new factory. Our citizens are amazed that our friends would help us in such a way."
 riverfed.3.a:0 "A toast to our friends in [From.GetName]!"
 
 riverfed.5.t:0 "[From.GetName] has built Roads for Us"
 riverfed.5.d:0 "[From.GetName] has funded an infrastructure project inside our country. They cited strategic considerations for the entire coalition. Without roads, it would be hard to transport forces through our country against any attack by the states that surround us. Either way, these brand new roads will serve us well."
 riverfed.5.a:0 "Their generosity is truly humbling."
 
 riverfed.7.t:0 "[From.GetName] Has granted us Industrial Aid"
 riverfed.7.d:0 "[From.GetName] has granted us aid to help develop our industrial base. A temporary program of grants, along with a delegation of engineers from [From.GetName] have been sent to help us. The ambassador [From.GetName] said that their country considered helping friends as important as helping themselves and that [From.GetName] truly seek no compensation for their aid."
 riverfed.7.a:0 "Let us not squander this opportunity."
 
 riverfed.8.t:0 "[From.GetName] Has Granted us Industrial Aid"
 riverfed.8.d:0 "[From.GetName], all the way from the Riverlands, has granted us industrial aid. A delegation of their engineers arrived to help us with the construction of new factories. Meanwhile they have also promised us financial aid to develop our country. The government of [From.GetName] has promised that they do this in the name of continued friendship between our nations and that there were no conditions attached to their help."
 riverfed.8.a:0 "Let us make generous use of their assistance."
 
 riverfed.9.t:0 "[From.GetName] has sent a Friendship Delegation"
 riverfed.9.d:0 "A boat arrived today, carrying a delegation from [From.GetName]. After a miscommunication almost led to us shooting at them, the diplomats explain that they have come to establish diplomatic ties and that it was truly the wish of [From.GetName] to be friends with us. Even more, they promise that all their friends in the Riverlands feel the same way and would be delighted to start talking with us!"
 riverfed.9.a:0 "Let us work together for a better world."
 riverfed.9.b:0 "Friends? It must be a trick. Who would ever want to be friends with us?"
 riverfed.9.c:0 "We'd rather not."
 
 riverfed.10.t:0 "[From.GetName] Has Accepted our Friendship Delegation"
 riverfed.10.d:0 "Our delegation to [From.GetName] reports that the changelings actually want to be our friend. It seems that diplomacy and openness truly work wonders. We can now begin to set up diplomatic channels and maybe even trade relations. Let us toast to our new friends!"
 riverfed.10.a:0 "Together, we shall make a world of peace and prosperity."
 
 riverfed.11.t:0 "[From.GetName] Has Rejected our Friendship Delegation"
 riverfed.11.d:0 "[From.GetName] does not want to be our friend, it seemed. They sent our delegation back home and were skeptical of our true motives. It seems that these changelings have a hard time trusting us. The news has been met with disappointment and some citizens are even offended that the islanders turned us down."
 riverfed.11.a:0 "But I thought they liked love?"
 
 riverfed.12.t:0 "[From.GetName] has Invited Us to Join the Treaty of Coltstream"
 riverfed.12.d:0 "We have been invited to join the Treaty of Coltstream, guaranteeing mutual defence in the event of an attack. The treaty, however, seems to be more than just that. The member states work together on all sorts of issues and are looking to intensify this cooperation. We must consider carefully if that is truly the road we want to take."
 riverfed.12.a:0 "Sign the treaty, this is our best shot at preserving peace and harmony."
 riverfed.12.b:0 "We are not interested at this time."
 
 riverfed.122.t:0 "[From.GetName] Signs the Treaty"
 riverfed.122.d:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] was invited by us to join the Treaty of Coltstream to further mutual cooperation. Their ambassador appeared today with the treaty signed and ratified. With [From.GetNameDef] joining the treaty, we are even stronger against outside threats."
 riverfed.122.a:0 "A joyous occasion!" 

 riverfed.13.t:0 "[From.GetName] Has Declined to Join"
 riverfed.13.d:0 "[From.GetName] does not want to join the Treaty of Coltstream. In an official statement, the country declared that although they appreciate the values of the Riverlands, they do not see a place for themselves in the treaty just yet. Nevertheless, [From.GetName] has said that their rejection does not have to mean the end of our friendship."
 riverfed.13.a:0 "At least we can still be friends?" 
 
 riverfed.14.t:0 "The River Development Company"
 riverfed.14.d:0 "[From.GetName] has founded the River Development Company. A pan-Riverlands jointly-owned corporation to assist in improving infrastructure and industries in the poorest parts of the Riverlands. The chairs of the company have already revealed bold plans to overhaul industry and transportation in the region and they hope for our cooperation."
 riverfed.14.a:0 "What a great idea, we will join this venture!"
 riverfed.14.b:0 "We won't fund this nonsense, we are fine on our own!"

 riverfed.15.t:0 "The River Economic Community"
 riverfed.15.d:0 "[From.GetName] has approached us with an intriguing proposal; the transition of the RCSC into a River Economic Community. This is an attempt both to improve relations and boost the economy of both our nations, as well as all the others involved. It also, however, a diplomatic move; one that seeks to bind our nations together.\n\nThe REC, founded by the Treaty of [From.Capital.GetName], proposes both reductions to custom duties and the establishment of a customs union, while also making a singular market for goods, labour, services and various other such across the member states. There are plans to expand it; Furthermore, the establishment of the River Commission will provide the means to further these plans; proposing legislation, implementing decisions made, and otherwise upholding the River treaties while upholding the REC's daily dealing.\nIf we were to sign up for this then it would begin to benefit us immediately. However, it would also likely create ties with [From.GetName] that cannot be severed in the foreseeable future."
 riverfed.15.a:0 "Cooperation is the key to the future!"
 riverfed.15.b:0 "We will opt-out, this goes too far!"

 riverfed.16.t:0 "The River Social Development Fund"
 riverfed.16.d:0 "[From.GetName] has approached us with further treaties to append to what has already been built on in the REC. They back a River Commission proposal to put in place measures and practices that improve factory conditions not only without hampering workplace efficiency, but rather to streamline the process even more. This might lose us the ability to control our own labour laws, however."
 riverfed.16.a:0 "Our citizens deserve this fund!"
 riverfed.16.b:0 "[From.GetName] should mind their own business!"

 riverfed.17.t:0 "River Convention on Racial Tolerance"
 riverfed.17.d:0 "[From.GetName] has convened the members of the Community to discuss the matter of racial equality. They propose a new convention aimed at promoting tolerance between the many races of the Community. Signatories of the convention will be committed to eliminating racial discrimination and promoting understanding between all races. It also requires its signatories to outlaw hate speech and criminalizing racial violence. [From.GetName] wants to form a pan-Riverlands committee to oversee the implementation of the convention and monitor its use. The verdicts made by this committee would be binding in the countries that sign the treaty. This convention will likely make other races more eager to join the Community in the future."
 riverfed.17.a:0 "Let us sign it for unity's sake!"
 riverfed.17.b:0 "This is an unacceptable breach of our sovereignty."

 riverfed.18.t:0 "The River Parliament"
 riverfed.18.d:0 "It was inevitable that with all the powers granted to the River Commission, there would be a call for more democratic control at the pan-Riverlands level. [From.GetName] has championed the cause for a River Parliament which would be a counterweight to the unelected Commission. The proponents of this parliament hope that this will result more sensible and popular policies, while ensuring that the Riverlands are ruled by, for and of the people."
 riverfed.18.a:0 "We must allow our citizens a say in pan-River affairs!"
 riverfed.18.b:0 "We already have representation at the national level."

 riverfed.19.t:0 "A Free Movement Area"
 riverfed.19.d:0 "A radical proposal was brought up in a meeting by the ambassador from [From.GetName]. They proposed that a free movement area should be realised between the member states of the Community. That would mean abolishing border controls in our internal borders and losing control of who comes and goes into our country across the border of the Community. This would come with several other reforms, like a trans-national police agency to catch cross-border criminals. Although connecting our peoples together is a good thing, a border was always considered a sign of national sovereignty. Should we part with our borders?"
 riverfed.19.a:0 "If money can flow freely, so should our citizens!"
 riverfed.19.b:0 "Our border guards stay!"

 riverfed.20.t:0 "The River Central Bank"
 riverfed.20.d:0 "The increasingly interdependent economies of the Riverlands lack serious oversight in monetary matters. In reality, the smaller national banks usually just follow the lead of those in the larger economies. [From.GetName] has proposed to end this and ensure that all member states can equally talk about monetary policy, by making that a pan-Riverland task. A new Central Bank will be made, which will oversee the national central banks. This bank will be almost completely independent from the River Commission and national governments. It would massively improve what we can do with our economy, but these breaches of national sovereignty are starting to become pretty severe..."
 riverfed.20.a:0 "Let us formalise the cooperation that already existed!"
 riverfed.20.b:0 "Our country, our rules!"

 riverfed.21.t:0 "The Rivbit"
 riverfed.21.d:0 "For time immemorial, coins have been used as a symbol of national control, a way to spread the ideas of a government to the citizens of the nation. However, a small economy has a hard time keeping a stable currency. With the borders opened and the economies connected, [From.GetName] has pushed for a single currency, the Rivbit. This would solve problems for many companies and tourists who cross the borders often. It would be a big sign of unity and trust in the pan-River government to have a currency-union."
 riverfed.21.a:0 "The Rivbit will be a stable currency for us all!"
 riverfed.21.b:0 "I want my head to feature on our own coins."

 riverfed.22.t:0 "The River Union" 
 riverfed.22.d:0 "[From.GetName] has called another conference to revise the treaty. They argued that the increased responsibility of the Commission, the parliament and the single currency all show that the Community is much more than an economic and military construct. After a long time of negotiation, the many laws and treaties that came before have been untangled and merged into a new treaty, the Treaty of [From.Capital.GetName]. Much of the informal powers of the Commission and the River Parliament have now been formalised and if approved, the River Union would be a very powerful organisation, one which we will not be able to sidestep easily.\n\nProtests have been organised in our capital both for and against the treaty, as our citizens are becoming increasingly aware about what is actually happening in the Riverlands. Some of our citizens have even called for an all-out federation, while others want a roll back on the pan-River powers. Regardless of if we ratify the treaty or not, this question will surely stay as a divisive issue for the foreseeable future."
 riverfed.22.a:0 "The Union Forever!"
 riverfed.22.b:0 "They want what? No, we must reject."

 riverfed.23.t:0 "The River Army"
 riverfed.23.d:0 "[From.GetName] wants to set another step towards centralisation. The armies of the Union members will be put under a centralised command structure. We have always been coordinating our armed forces together with our friends, but this would formalise a hierarchy in which the army is under Riverlander control. The savings of centralising the army will be enormous and there is a lot we can still learn from our friends. However, the proposal has met with outrage amongst some of our officers and a significant part of the population. An army is the one thing that defines a state. If we lose control of our army, could we still be called a nation?"
 riverfed.23.a:0 "What are they afraid of? This will save money!"
 riverfed.23.b:0 "They will never take our country's pride!"

 riverfed.24.t:0 "Centralising the River Government"
 riverfed.24.d:0 "Some have awaited this day eagerly, while others dreaded it. [From.GetName] has put a proposal on the table which is frankly, preposterous. Or it should be. It will push the power to change the treaties away from our government and the other countries and put it in the control of the River Commission and the River Parliament. This will in effect mean that we will be unable to stop decisions by these institutions and that leaving will be nigh impossible.\n\nNormally such a proposal would be rejected outright, but the River Union has given us so many benefits, and we stand to gain much more from this reform. However, our government must ask itself if it would really sign a law to make itself obsolete. We have come so far and enjoyed so many of the benefits of cooperation, do we really even want to be separated from our friends anymore?"
 riverfed.24.a:0 "They left us no choice but to accept."
 riverfed.24.b:0 "There is still a way back!"

 riverfed.25.t:0 "The River Federation"
 riverfed.25.d:0 "[From.GetName] has done much to bring the River Union to the place it is today. Many of its institutions are located in [From.Capital.GetName] and it is unsurprising that they are the ones who have been pushing for the River Federation. Informally, surprisingly little would change as most affairs are handled by the Union anyway. Formally, however, we'd renounce our right to leave the Union and give the Federation the prime authority of government and say over our army. If we agree to the Federation, it will be the Federal Government which decides what things our government can do, instead of us controlling the Union Government. Of course, banding together like this will make us a formidable power, and surely no one could ever threaten us again.\n\nMany question, however, if our original dream hasn't turned into a nightmare. Are we not on the verge of losing what made us [Root.GetAdjective] in the first place? We have to make a decision that will decide the future of our children and maybe the future of Griffonia as a whole."
 riverfed.25.a:0 "We will join the Federation!"
 riverfed.25.b:0 "This is a step too far, but we shall stay in the Union."
 riverfed.25.c:0 "[From.GetName] is trying to take us over, we must leave!"

 riverfed.27.d:0 "[From.GetName] has decided that they do not want to take part in the Federation. However, they are happy with staying in the Union on the terms we decided on equally, as long as they can keep their independence. This is a setback, but our institutions will still be able to control a lot of their decisions and we will still be able to protect them, and we will effectively be able to direct them around on the stage."
 riverfed.27.a:0 "We can work with this."

 riverfed.28.t:0 "[From.GetName] Leaves the Union!"
 riverfed.28.d:0 "[From.GetName] has announced that they are activating the secession protocol made into the original treaty of Coltstream. They will be negotiating their way out of the Union, reverting back to normal relations. They will surely be missed, but it appears that we have no choice but to let our friends go for now."
 riverfed.28.a:0 "Is there nothing we can do?"

 riverfed.29.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Joins the Federation!"
 riverfed.29.d:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has announced that they are ready to initiate the accession into the River Federation. Although the government of [From.GetName] initially had its doubt about the River Federation and decided to not give up their sovereignty. The undeniable success of the new nation has made these doubts fade away and now [From.GetNameDef] will join the Federation of the Riverlands!"

### Coltstream Summit Stuff/Intro ###
coltstream.1.t:0 "The Summit Beyond the Mountain"
coltstream.1.d:0 "King Rover Diamondshield, sighed and grumbled on his throne as he held a piece of paper in his paw. The noise made his daughter Molly look up from her book. "What is it father?"\n\n"An invitiation to come to Coltstream. It's the Coalition." Rover explained unenthusiastically.\n\nThis made Molly jump up and put her book down, rushing to the throne to see the letter. "Are we going? We're going right?" Her tail wagged excitedly as she waited for the huge dog King to respond.\n\nRover whined, "I really don't want to. Those meetings drag on forever and they never decide on anything."\n\nThe dismissal made Molly set up puppy eyes, swaying softly as she looked up at her dad. "I want to see Coltstream! You never took me to the River Republic! There are going to be so many ponies there!"\n\nRover grumbled at the thought. "That's exactly the problem my sweet princess! So many ponies. Let's just stay home and let the ponies worry about all the politics." Rover bit his lip when looking into his daughter's eyes. It was very, very difficult to deny her anything. She was kind of right. He was the King after all, he was supposed to show up for this even if it was just for ponies. Molly kept smiling up in anticipation, pricking through the King's stony demeanour with the same ease she always had. Her smile kept up its assault on the king's resistance. Until finally Rover stood up, sighed deeply and picked up his daughter."
coltstream.1.a:0 "We'll go to Coltstream!"

coltstream.2.t:0 "An Ill Timed Invitation"
coltstream.2.d:0 "Mayor Frost looked out of his window overlooking Jezeragrad. He sighed. The city looked ever so peaceful and yet, so much was brewing in those cheerful streets. He turned back towards his desk where the letter was resting. The invitation to the summit in Coltstream. He had been dreading it. The timing of it all had just been so poor between the elections, the chaos in Longsword and the unrest. He feared that leaving for Coltstream would be like leaving the fireponies station in the middle of a drought. And yet, despite it all, the coalition was a vital pillar of the City's stability and democracy. If it wasn't there, what would even stand in the way of the military taking over?\n\n"I can ill afford to leave...""
coltstream.2.a:0 "My staff can hold down the fort for a few days."

coltstream.3.t:0 "A Message to the Quiet Woods"
coltstream.3.d:0 "Deponya is many things to its people. It is a place of harmony with nature, where its ponies have managed to find a tenuous coexistence with the deadly Eygsic forest. It is a place of tradition and loyalty, where its kings have ruled unquestioned for centuries and where modern ideologies have struggled to find root. It is a place that cares little for the outside world, being content to live its life in peace.\n\nYet, its sedate existence and disinterest in the outside world does not make it isolationist, and it has stood with the River Coalition since its inception. Therefore, as the news reaches it of the Coltstream Summit its king, Grimhoof, wastes no time and has called for a ship to be readied for the voyage. Deponya stands by her friends after all."
coltstream.3.a:0 "Let's see what the outsiders want."

coltstream.4.t:0 "The Chains of Commanding"
coltstream.4.d:0 "River Swirl loathed the Sabor these days.\n\nGranted, it was a necessary part of her duties as Chancellor, but to actually face Nova Whirl in the Sabor was not something that she desired right now.\n\nAnd there Nova Whirl went again: "...Will the Chancellor apologize to the ponies outside this building for leaving them in the lurch? Aren't they aware that most of our ponies have never had it this bad?"\n\nRiver Swirl looked at the clock, groaning quietly when she realized Nova's rant had lasted for over forty minutes. Then she spotted Iron Hoof entering the chamber from the side, waving a piece of paper. He trotted in a light canter over to River Swirl's side, showing her the message.\n\nShe rose to speak, shooting Nova Whirl an unfriendly glare, "I apologize for the brief intercession, but our leadership and role as the Heart of the Riverlands demand that we, the River Republic, host and attend a summit to bring together the Coalition to renew the treaty of Coltstream."\n\nWith those words, she left the Chamber, leaving Nova Whirl to rail against her to a missing Chancellor. There were some things she loved about her job. And there were some she hated."
coltstream.4.a:0 "Uneasy lies the head..."

coltstream.5.t:0 "A Letter to the Free Clans"
coltstream.5.d:0 "Time flew slowly in the green hills of Ponaidhean and so, every invitation to the regular summits of the Coltstream Treaty signatories felt like a reminder of the time passed. Crimson "Cridhe an Dràgon" nic Heart, Taoiseach of the Free Ponies would attend of course. Though the monks and clans of the hills would rather live in quiet isolation, they were in general agreement that the world was too troubled for them to expect to live in peace and had to contribute somewhat to the welfare of the world. And so the Free Ponies would travel to Coltstream to voice their desires."
coltstream.5.a:0 "Let us get on the road then."

coltstream.6.t:0 "The Coltstream Summit"
coltstream.6.d:0 "A delegation from Rijekograd arrived in the Royal Castle and delivered an invitation to Queen White Star herself. She was cordially invited to attend a summit of all River Coalition members at Coltstream, where the foundational treaty had been signed all those years ago. White Star herself was eager to take part, having always been an advocate of seeking closer ties with other Coalition members, but word spread quickly and soon enough the Witenagemot issued a protest.\n\nLed by Lord Wulfric of Cemricia, White Star's former supporter and long-time nemesis, the more conservative mage-nobles requested the Queen to refuse the invitation. They said that it was in fact a thinly veiled insult from the River Republic, as Coltstream had once belonged to Wittenland but was ceded to the Rijekans after a brutal war. Not only that, but the Coalition itself was a defensive alliance, and currently there was no major threat facing any of the member states. Therefore the summit seemed to have no purpose, and would likely be a waste of time.\n\nWhite Star politely ignored the complaint and accepted the invitation, responding to the nobles that she had the obligation to maintain good relations with their allies, lest they abandon Wittenland in its time of need. She did promise to protect Wittenland's interests and make no promises of anything. While White Star wanted to do more at the summit, she knew she had to get the internal situation in her country under control before she could look abroad."
coltstream.6.a:0 "Let us hope it will go well."

coltstream.7.t:0 "The Lesser Meeting"
coltstream.7.d:0 "A delegation from Rijekograd arrived in Nimbusi to deliver an invitation to Pegicles to attend the regular summit of all River Coalition members at Coltstream. The strategos couldn't help but sigh at the thought. The Treaty was all well and good even if Nimbusia had always been forced to be its backbone but Pegicles never understood the need to attend all these meetings. After all, what could the summit actually achieve? It was no meeting of the boule where all could freely debate and vote. Even when there was consensus, it would always be weak and left to the signatory states to interpret in their own way whereas once the citizens of Nimbusia had decided something, this much was law.\n\nStill, it was his duty. Unless the boule would see fit to renege on their treaty obligations, he wouldn't embarrass its citizens. So, with only a small party, he would fly southwards and see if maybe the Riverlands had anything more to offer."
coltstream.7.a:0 "The law is clear."

coltstream.8.t:0 "The Invitation"
coltstream.8.d:0 "Water Lily frowned, leaning forward at her desk as she pondered the letter before her. It was a cordial message from River Swirl, inviting her to attend a River Coalition summit in Coltstream to renew the pact. She wanted badly to go and reaffirm Bakara's commitment to the Coalition. In addition, there were important matters that needed to be addressed by all of them together. She sighed. If only things were that simple.\n\nDomestically, the summit loomed large. In recent years, the standing of the Coalition among Bakarans had fallen considerably, and attending would do no favours for her popularity. If she was to go, Firm Scow and other anti-Coalition fanatics would hammer her relentlessly in the press. Not to mention the fact that Tea Dip and Bray Foam would make hay giving speeches and riling up supporters while she would be out of the country entirely. Water Lily looked out her window and saw the city skyline under a cloudy sky.\n\nShe truly wanted to go, but perhaps now just wasn't the right time... The campaign was already in full swing, and the stakes were astronomically high. The future of Bakara hung in the balance! If not for that, she would have accepted without batting an eye. Besides, Water Lily thought, the summit would be a simple, routine affair. Surely the rest of them would be fine without her...\n\nWater Lily tapped a hoof on the desk, before finally making her decision and putting pen to paper."
coltstream.8.a:0 "I look forward to attending."
coltstream.8.b:0 "Regrettably, I have other commitments and must decline."

coltstream.9.t:0 "A Pony's Welcome"
coltstream.9.d:0 "The trip from Diamond Mountain to Coltsteam had been a long one. They could have taken the sea route to Nimbusia or Bakara and go south but that would have meant making a stop in Bakara, which king Rover just wouldn't do. Those damn seaponies had annoyed him enough with their rants about "democracy" and "creatures rights". He wanted a nice calm journey with his daughter. So they went the land route through the Deponyan forest. Lovely place if you didn't count all strange magical occurences.\n\nFinally, they made their way to Coltstream. Rover was in a foul mood over reports of slave uppityness back home but he was sure Gnasher and Biter had everything under control. When they got out of the carriage, their host was there to greet them. River Swirl, all dressed up and smiling from ear to ear. Rover didn't like her. She wasn't as bad as the Bakarans but she always talked too much. Though Molly seemed happy to see her as she ran out to her. The two chattered on while he only got the bare minimum of diplomatic pleasantries.\n\nAs they made their way towards their apartments, Rover had to call out Molly who had wished to stay by River Swirl's side to meet the others. He sighed as she ran up to him. He really would need to teach her some royal discipline, lest she would end up like their neighbours."
coltstream.9.a:0 "Ponies smile too much."

coltstream.10.t:0 "Out of Sight..."
coltstream.10.d:0 "Springtime Frost, Mayor of Lake City, let out a weary sigh as his boat pulled into the dock. He may have been a fisher once but those days were long behind him and the rocking of the boat did his stomach ill. As he stepped down onto the landing he felt his gut twist at the thought of the days to come. He couldn't afford to wait idly here, his rivals would mock him for running from the mess back home. On the other hoof, if he stayed home, he would have been abandoning Lake City's allies and economical partners. \n\nDrowning in this sea of stress and worries, he barely acknowledged River Swirl as she welcomed him to the summit location. Yet, at the last minute, he snapped out of his melancholy, apologized and embraced her.\n\n"Chancellor Swirl. How good it is to see you."\n\nHe didn't add anything and simply left for his accomodations with Swirl looking at him with concern as her aides announced that his Majesty of Deponya was arriving, preventing her from talking to him."
coltstream.10.a:0 "But not out of mind."

coltstream.11.t:0 "The King in the Woods"
coltstream.11.d:0 "King Grimhoof cut a strange figure as he arrived at the summit. Dressed in an ermine robe and the royal crown of Deponya, he stood out among the other ponies to say the least, as did his entourage. Grimhoof, however, chose to not pay it much mind, instead greeting River Swirl as he would distant family members that he had not seen in a long while, no matter who they were. While all smiles, he noticed how so many of the delegates were tense. Poor River Swirl was dealing with the fallout of her strange system of governance, the Bakarans were having their own issues, the bloody tragedy in Longsword was ever unfolding before all their eyes. And he knew how likely it was that it would spillover in Hellquill.\n\nGrimhoof hoped that this unease was a passing thing, and that the future was going to look bright for them. Yet if it wasn't, then the coalition needed to hold."
coltstream.11.a:0 "We must hope they all remember."

coltstream.12.t:0 "A Warm Welcome"
coltstream.12.d:0 "There were good days and bad days. Mostly mediocre days though, but despite this, it was a good day today. She had looked forward to a few days away from the leftist hotbed that was Rijekograd and in relaxing conditions as the medieval town of Coltstream was arrayed before her. A few hours of boring meetings, but other than that, three relaxing weeks of nothing while Iron Hoof ran the show. There would be a price to pay for it in the end but that lay in the future.\n\nAnd the high point had been the arrival of Water Lily. They both led their nations against the communist hordes. They both were harmonists in a world and continent that was decidedly hostile to those same ideas. And they were both facing a tough reelection fight between communists, military, business interests and all the other groups they had to keep track of and defeat.\n\nThe biggest lie is that negotiation happens in the open. Most happens in backrooms and built up on friendships, drinks and shared enemies. Perhaps this was why Bakara and the Republic worked so well lately. But the time for waiting was over. They had all arrived, the monks, the pegasi and even the more...traditional heads of state from the three Kingdoms. The summit was soon to begin."

There would be a price to pay for it in the end but that lay in the future.\n\nIt was a shame that Water Lily hadn't shown up then. She had looked forward to the two getting to vent their shared frustrations with their shared adversaries and their unique national ones. A way to talk out all the things that would be a catastrophe to say out loud in public.\n\nA damn shame."

Walking through the city proper proved strangely more difficult. Citizens and onlookers kept getting in their way, inspecting them like oddities. It puzzled Crimson. After all, their monks still traveled the world and helped those in need. Surely they must have seen their likes before?\n\nThen, a sudden roar of applause and cheers. Strange change of heart but she'd take it if she didn't notice the Nimbusian delegation flying over them. Apparently killing the dreaded Griffonian emperor still secured fame a century later... But no matter, Anam-Teine cared little for fame.\n\nTheir arrival at the summit palace proved to be a better experience. River Swirl welcomed them all warmly.\n\n"The Free Ponies salute you, Chancellor Swirl. I hope this summit proves to be fructuous for us all!"\n\n"Likewise, honored Taoiseach Crimson! You and your brothers and sisters are always welcome here.""

coltstream.15.t:0 "Down The Stream"
coltstream.15.d:0 "The royal entourage of Queen White Star departed the capital in the morning mist, escorting Her Majesty to Coltstream to attend the Summit. The group travelled on a luxurious river barge down the Griffking river, and many commoners gathered on the banks of the river and on their own boats to witness the procession. White Star herself stood on the deck of the ship, gazing at Wittenburgh behind her. While she was gone, there was nothing to stop Lord Wulfric or her other opponents from trying to take over, except Wittenlandic tradition. The only legitimate way to become monarch was through a duel, and as much as White Star disliked Wulfric, she had to admit he was honourable. So she hoped her fears were unfounded and turned to look ahead, towards Coltstream.\n\nWhen the Queen and her entourage arrived at Coltstream's riverside docks, they received a warm welcome by River Swirl herself. Rijekograd, her city, was on the opposite shore, so this place must've felt like second home to her. White Star thought she wouldn't be willing at all to ever cede the town back to its original owners, and for good reason. But as she looked at the town itself, she could clearly see Wittenlandic architecture and other signs of her culture, even if it was buried under the Rijekan one. In the end, she thought, it should be the ponies of Coltstream who decided which nation they should belong to, instead of any outsider.\n\nAfter meeting River Swirl, White Star met with the other attendees of the participating nations, always acting politely and calmly, even when speaking to King Rover of Diamond Mountain who was similar to Wulfric in many ways. If the Coalition was to stay together, the leaders would have to put aside their differences and work together, no matter their beliefs and values."

Rather than dilly dally on the roads or use a plane, he would rather use the occasion to showcase the strength and agility of Nimbusian pegasi. After traversing a cloud, there it was. Coltstream. Just as he remembered it. Not the mightiest of cities but still an honored ground, where Ponies had come together to vanquish the hated Grover, second of his name. As he descended, he decided to indulge the locals a bit and fly over the market square causing much cheer and applause.\n\nFinally, he arrived at the Summit Palace. He flew around for a moment, to let their hosts prepare for them. Finally, when he saw River Swirl take her place in the ground, he flew down.\n\n"Khaîre Chancellor Swirl! I am here as a representative of the citizens of Nimbusia. You are thanked for hosting this summit."\n\nRiver Swirl smiled and thanked him, wishing him welcome and hoping that he would find the accommodations to his liking."

"I wouldn't miss this for the world!"\n\nRiver Swirl grinned. "Things are that bad up there, huh?" Water Lily laughed heartily as the two shook hooves.\n\n"Nothing I can't handle." Water Lily waved a hoof dismissively. "Just a few boisterous Coalition sceptics, is all. Of course, I hear things are no picnic here, either. Sounds like a tough spot for the HSR to be in." River Swirl nodded knowingly. "Seems like no matter what you do, you can't please everypony."\n\n"Thanks. We have been having some... difficulties with our governing partners." River Swirl's voice strained slightly. "However, in the end I am confident that cooler heads will prevail." She looked off into the distance for a moment. "But enough about politics! We'll have plenty of time for that later. First, all of us are going to enjoy a nice state dinner tonight."\n\n"That does sound enticing." Water Lily said, intrigued. "What's on the menu?

From all accounts, it was a joyous occasion with a few toasts being thrown.\n\nThe evening continued with the traditional ball though not all leaders attended. Strategos Pegicles who had already barely partaken at the state dinner went to bed early while King Rover Diamondshield went back to his apartments but was represented by his daughter Molly. The ball, attended by many honored citizens from all the coalition, opened with what could have been a diplomatic faux-pas, the opening dance that was supposed to feature leaders dancing in duos left Water Lily hanging due to the early departure of Pegicles. Yet, princess Molly spontaneously offered the Bakaran President to dance with her and king Grimhoof. Though awkward, the dance endeared the crowd and the fashion journalist in attendance. More gloom was mayor Frost who was seen dancing at the end of the ball with Chancellor Swirl after having spent the majority of the evening writing in an alcove.\n\nFinally, the night ended on a demonstration of Anam-Teine techniques by Crimson nic Heart and her entourage at the request of princess Molly, drawing many cheers before all leaders finally went to bed to get some much needed rest before the various meetings of the summit."

The ball started on an awkward note as it was supposed to be opened with a dance of all state leaders paired by two by two. The ball organized scrambled to scrap it before Princess Molly pointed out that with Pegicles' early departure, they were the correct number. Not waiting for an answer, she lead Queen White Star to the dance floor, promptly followed by other leaders.

At least Grimhoof wore his crown and attire and Pegicles his armor. He liked Pegicles enough. For a commoner.\n\nThey all chattered and bickered, posturing about this and that. Rover barely listened. After all, what were their problems? He had revolts and knightly incursions on his paws! And that was why they were all there.\n\nWhen it came to him to speak, he didn't stand up. No need considering how much he towered over them all.\n\n"Diamond Mountain thanks the coalition for its warm welcome. However, we regret that this warmth only applies to meetings and summits. Every day, rude visitors from our neighbours come and tell us how things ought to be done in our kingdom. They complain about the lives of hounds they have never met or spoken to yet they happily profit from the ores and products we happily provide to the coalition.\n\nWe thank the Kingdom of Deponya and Lake City for their continued help in standing guard against the griffon hordes in the Frontier and recommend for other states to do the same and honor their military obligations rather than lecture their allies for matters not covered by the Treaty of Colstream.""

It was time for this risk of coming here to pay off, but how? If he went home with nothing but a story about one dance to show, his political rivals would have his head.\n\nHe went in the plenary session confident. He had fended off the Wittenlandic offers that would have jeopardized the guilds' support and secured a lower tariff for an investment deal with Deponya. He followed the various speeches, reviewing his own address, carefully written to say nothing and upset noone. The perfect milktoast speech. And then came his time to speak. He stood up, considered the audience and after taking a long breath, threw his notes to the side.\n\n"Dear friends,\n\nAllow me thank all of you for coming today. It is a simple thing really but how many of our ancestors could have conceived us meeting peacefully when two hundred years ago, we still fought over this very city. I see some grimacing but still, is it not a testament to how far we've come? How democracy and the rule of law changed us? How collaborating on the simplest of things brought us closer together?\n\nYet this great concord of ours was born in pain and in a painful world we continue to live in. Just a few days west of my home city, ponies are being slaughtered in the name of purity. South, Prywhen burns as leaders failed to give their citizens a place or bread on their tables. And what of our great enemy? What of the Empire? Perhaps good will triumph in that troubled place. Perhaps the Frontier shall become a place of meeting rather than fighting. But we're not there and it is likely that the worst voices get heard in Griffenheim like they have before. Whatever comes, we should honor the spirit of the Coltstream treaty and face it together, as friends, in peace and harmony. For if democracy fails, if the coalition fails, if we fail, then what but death and misery for decades to come?\n\nPerhaps when we meet again, we will have the occasion to deepen our bonds. It is my deepest hope and wish.""

River Swirl discussed future economic aid with him, to which he gave a polite but noncommittal answer. The Bakarans - as always - were salivating over the prospects of logging rights and he had to find the most peaceful way of telling them that the sun would fall out of the sky before that happened. He found himself consoled by the presence of Springtime Frost, who did not seek to weasel special privileges out of him, but was content to greet him as a friend and associate, clear up some of the minor issues that had arisen in recent times, and let their bond remain as it was, friendly, yet respectful."

Talking with old friends from Lake City and Deponya in the diplomatic corps that she had not seen for a long time and the dinners that all the leaders had to attend as part of their duties to keep up appearances. It almost felt like she was that bright young thing on the Rijekan political scene eighteen years ago that had just been elected to her seat of Dubrovneigh West.\n\nFor all the talk that Pegicles and Diamondshield made of this being a superfluous thing, River Swirl was quite convinced that the summit was a pleasure and an honor to host, even with those small meetings about the proposals of the further integration. Of the Coal and Steel Community and the Science Society. And of course, of the griffons that were always there to attack.\n\nThe summit was a joy to be at. Long hours of talking international politics, discussing the fate of the communists which they were sure to meet soon. For all that River Swirl thought, this was a week of talk, wine, partying and the occasional work-related responsibility associated forthwith."

Instead, she used her time to denounce the bloodshed in Longsword and the continued woes of the inhabitants of Barrad as well her worries of the Pentarchy spiraling out of control. She also finished by advocating for the coalition to also focus on the everyday dangers and threats posed by the Austurlandic vikingars as well as her wish to see a detente and rapprochement between the coalition and the Kása Free State, much to the dismay of Wittenland and Nimbusia."

She had promised to Wulfric and other nobles to not make promises and to protect Wittenland's interests, so she had to remain silent when she wanted to speak and vice versa. At the main meeting she requested member states safely away from the Coalition's border to take a more active part in defending Wittenland as the Gryphian cossacks had been rather bold in their raids in recent years. Afterwards she attempted to sign a fair economic deal with Lake City which Springtime Frost unfortunately had to reject, politely refused to promise any development aid to Pónaidhean but said that the matter could be discussed later, and lastly attempted to bring up the Coltstream Question with River Swirl. However, when she saw how the Riverpony was in a good mood, she didn't want to ruin it and only had a surface-level talk with her, not asserting the Wittenlandic claim to the region at all.\n\nAt the end, White Star felt rather frustrated, and thought she had only succeeded at doing what Wulfric had wanted her to do: That is, doing nothing meaningful. Perhaps the next Summit, if it was held, wouldn't be as bad for her."

The strategos felt a bit miffed by the lack of military etiquette in such a summit but these were the times they lived in apparently...\n\nMuch of the talks and speeches centered on issues that had little to do with their treaty obligations. Though some did understand that they were mostly here for defense purposes. Finally, Pegicles' turn to speak came and he decided to focus on two things: respect towards his nation and their common treaty obligations.\n\n"Respected allies,\n\nI speak in the name of the citizens of Nimbusia. We are glad to once again state that we are honoring our obligations to protect and defend our lands and those of our allies against foreign threats. We only regret that some of our respected fellow signatories do not contribute as much as we do and respectfully remind them that should war come, we won't be able to carry the shield and the spear on every piece of the frontline.\n\nI also wish to address the common insults that my people face regarding the matter of Helotry. Despite claims from Bakaran ágnoiatoi, it is no form of slavery. Helots have food in their bellies, roof over their heads and both purpose and place within our society. Should one see slavery and misery to be rectified, they ought to look towards the place of our fellow ponies in Longsword, slaughtered in the name of our wretched enemies, or to Austurland that raids and shackles innocents in the name of greed alone. Despite this, agitators from lands like the so-called Kása Free State continue to insult us by perpetuating this lie. We wish for it to stop and for the coalition to focus once more on our common defense against those in the Frontier!""

She spoke in a sombre tone as she listed them off. "The Riverlands must stand as one and condemn this bloodshed."\n\n"Times such as these demand that we provide strong moral leadership." Water Lily brought a hoof down forcefully on the table. "We have to make it crystal clear that the Coalition will not tolerate such injustices." White Star and River Swirl nodded in agreement, although some of the other leaders seemed less enthusiastic. Just as she was about to continue, Water Lily was interrupted by a loud yawn from Rover Diamondshield.\n\nSilence filled the room and all eyes were on Rover, who didn't seem bothered. "Do you not think these matters concern us?" Water Lily asked incredulously. Rover smirked and gave a shrug. "They do." Water Lily shot the dog a determined glare.

A few dogs wearing red could only do much after all. For now, he could rest. Good that was all good.\n\nYet, something kept worrying him. Molly seemed unlike her usual self.

On the other hoof, purists were angered over the Coalition General Reporter's final agreement which went in their opinion well beyond the scope of the 898 treaty. Traditionalists however mostly supported the strategos' conduct and in the end, no motion was voted to reprimand him or his positions. A robust debate and the strategos being informed of where the citizens stood was enough for most. Yet, such nitpicking still worried Pegicles considering how little he had strayed from the Nimbusian tradition."

coltstream.39.d:0 "After the conclusion of the summit, River Swirl stood at the docks with Water Lily to wish her well on the trip back to Bakara. "I must have repeated myself a lot in there." Water Lily mused. "Always talking about how we have to stand as a beacon for the oppressed. They're all probably tired of hearing it." She smiled wryly. "Sometimes I wonder how many others see it that way." Water Lily sighed and looked off into the horizon.\n\n"I do," River Swirl replied, matter-of-factly. "We're leaders, and what we say matters. We need to set an example not just for our citizens, but for the world." She swept a hoof towards Coltstream. "When we speak, ponies listen."\n\n"For that to work, ponies have to trust us. Too many don't." Water Lily frowned, shaking her head. "And it's not their fault! We need to earn that trust. Up to now, I'm not sure we've done enough."\n\n"I know you've done all you can. Remember that you're not in this alone." River Swirl trotted up next to Water Lily. "I'm right there with you. We both have important roles to play, but in our own ways." A horn blared across the calm waterfront, indicating that the ferry would soon be leaving.\n\n"You're right." Water Lily said, before turning to face River Swirl and smiling. "Good luck in the elections."\n\n"You as well.""

coltstream.40.t:0 "Conclusion of the Summit"
coltstream.40.d:0 "After days of tense meetings and negotiations, the Coltstream summit had at last come to end. The Coalition leaders in attendance returned home, having all signed an agreement renewing the pact which would soon bear Water Lily's signature as well.\n\nWater Lily was pleased to see that the agreement also contained sections going beyond merely reiterating the Coalition's mandate of mutual defence, but also taking a moral stand against persecutions in Longsword. Yet, it was strange to have Springtime Frost of all ponies to thank for it. And Water Lily couldn't help but wonder: what if she had been there?"

coltstream_news.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Today, the Coalition General Reporter released the agreement drafted by the leaders of the River Coalition after their summit in the city of Coltstream. As per the course, the summit formally renewed the defensive pact between all eight nations and their promise to stand together against any Griffonian incursion. However, the agreement goes beyond the status quo and actively condemns the bloodshed currently occuring in the County of Longsword, warning Count Pallas to end his abuse of native ponies. The agreement also hopes for a peaceful resolution of the Brodfeld civil war, but the language included in the pact does not pave the way for an immediate military intervention."

coltstream_news.2.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Today, the Coalition General Reporter released the agreement drafted by the leaders of the River Coalition after their summit in the city of Coltstream. In a surprising breach of tradition, the Bakaran President Water Lily failed to attend. However, their representatives did not block the agreement. As per the course, the summit announces his intention, pending formal Bakaran signature, to renew the defensive pact between all eight nations and their promise to stand together against any Griffonian incursion. The agreement does go beyond the status quo and actively condemns the bloodshed currently occuring in the County of Longsword, warning Count Pallas to end his abuse of native ponies. It also hopes for a peaceful resolution of the Brodfeld civil war, but the language included in the pact does not pave the way for an immediate military intervention and the absence of the Bakaran Republic points to a lack of unity in the coalition."

greifwald.26.d:0 "We have received an offer of cooperation from our distant cousins in the land of Greifwald. It seems that, now that they've had time to re-evaluate their position, they have decided to rejoin us and aid us in the wars to come in exchange for special autonomy. The Count is not a particularly aggressive griffon, so while we doubt he will be much help for us, he's not likely to cause any problems or drag us into some conflict only he cares about.\n\nOn the other talon, Greifwald is a weak and impoverished nation and it wouldn't be hard for us to simply topple the government and take what we want like everyone expects we shall." #empire receives an offer from greifwald to join faction

greifwald.27.t:0 "Greifwald Requests to Join Us!"
greifwald.27.d:0 "It seems that, faced with the resurgent Griffonian Empire, the County of Greifwald has decided to try and get back in our good graces. They've offered to bind themselves to us in foreign affairs in exchange for protection and autonomy. Their armies are weak, but the Empire is coming, and it would be easier to fight alongside the Greifwaldians than to crush the nation, rebuild it, and THEN do the same thing.\n\nThe Count himself is not exactly a monarchist, but he's not exactly a liberal, either. Political expediency aside, selling the deal to our populace is doable, if we don't want to make a show of proudly rejecting the offer." #aquileia receives an offer from greifwald to join faction

greifwald.28.a:0 "Damn you, Trimmel!"

greifwald.29.t:0 "Fork In The Road"
greifwald.29.d:0 "    Count Ostrick Cloudet walked the bustling streets of Falcontown. To be able to simply pop down to the stores and get a sandwich or a new hat, even as the leader of the whole nation, was his proudest achievement so far, although his security guards were not fans of it. At first the townsfolk had been shocked and the petty nobles scandilized, but after months, and then years, it was no longer spectacular that he took his daily walk outside the palace. Nowadays they paid attention to him, but they didn't bow as if he were his father or mother, or pester him with suggestions for political changes. "Good morning, Margueritte!" He called to an aged grocer. She was one of his closer acquaintances because she helped him hide from his court that he had a taste for cheap, fattening jerky, and he didn't need the family doctor getting on him about his diet again.\n    "Good morning, Count Cloudet!" She called back. "It's so cold out there, are you sure you should be walking about?"\n    He placed a few idols on the counter. "It will be fine, this is a very nice coat." He leaned against one of the shelves as he took a few sticks of dried meat. "I've got a difficult decision coming up, and thought that a treat might make the answer clearer, or at least more palatable."\n    "Is it the kind of decision I can help you with?" Margueritte asked cheerfully.\n    "I'm afraid not, although I wouldn't mind your opinion. Greifwald is between two countries which could become great powers, and both of them would want to annex us. Can we, as a country, remain independent? If not, which would be better to side with?" He looked at her and took a bite.\n    She shrugged. "I pretend to be an expert on public transport, but not on foreign policy."\n    Cloudet wanted to ask, "do you think I will make the right decision?", but that was certainly more doubt than he should show to a commoner. He was supposed to be above that. So he didn't."
greifwald.29.a:0 ""Understandable""

greifwald.30.t:0 "The Day Approaches"
greifwald.30.d:0 "    Cloudet stood over the battle map that had been given to him by his generals. On one side, the eastern border of Greifwald. On the other, the self-proclaimed nation of Adelart. His generals were confident that victory was possible within the constraints he had given them. Greifwald would get much of its population and the majority of its oil supply back, both of which meant a lot of money for the coffers. He was still uneasy. Adelart had seceded some years before he became the Count, and he had dreaded the day he did what he as leader was expected to do and declared war. A single stroke of the pen - but how many lives would he end? Would he be able to live with himself after being directly responsible for the violent deaths of thousands, the destruction of houses and the work of generations? He never knew.\n    His nation demanded, however, that he find out. Greifwald needed every advantage it could get to survive the events to come, and even if it didn't, the populace wanted the country to be whole again and shouted as much in the streets. He looked up and around at the officers around the room. "Begin the operation when ready."\n    Across the room, his eyes met with Petalbeak's. "You're doing the right thing", those two blue orbs said, but he wasn't sure he believed it."
greifwald.30.a:0 "Please don't struggle..."

greifwald.31.t:0 "Law and...Forgiveness?"
greifwald.31.d:0 "    Deadly outlaws. Dangerous revolutionaries. Anarchists, and bandits. None of them had stopped Greifwald on its march towards the conquest of Adelart.\n    Through forests and over rivers, our forces engaged the armies of the breakaway state with equally deceptive tactics as the ones they employed. Far from a traditional, frontline conflict, the absence of information and general confusion led to one of the most chaotic, yet at the same time, least deadly wars in recent memory. It is for these reasons, and his preconceived idealism, that Count Cloudet made the decision he did.\n    A full pardon, and welcome, to the bandits and citizens of Adelart, as if they were reuniting family. If that weren't enough to send pure shock throughout both sides, the added immediate imprisonment of the Sheriff, and subsequent address which blamed the conflict mostly upon his cruel past actions, brought the conflict to an anticlimactic, and confusing end.\n    Stepping out onto the street, Merlock Wood gave a glance to his surrounding comrades, all of them just certain of their execution, now free Griffons. They were even allowed to keep their guns. For the first time in his life, Merlock Wood asked;" #welcome back bandits, you're all pardoned. not you sheriff, you suck balls
greifwald.31.a:0 ""Well...Now what?""

greifwald.32.t:0 "Broken Record"
greifwald.32.d:0 "    Difficulty was to be expected. Minor resistance, sure. But the stubborn attitudes of the more nationalistic groups of Adelart was above all, demoralizing.\n    Count Cloudet paced the room, and if his claws had not been gripped to the floor out of nervousness, the twitching of his wings would have probably sent him hovering. Sure, he didn't expect all of Adelart to immediately fall under his control, but surely his strategy of winning hearts and minds had to count for something.\n    Making their way into the Count's room, Reinhold Grinfeather's entrance hardly broke the Count out of his trance. "Merciful is one attribute, sire. Naive is another."\n    Lifting his head, Count Cloudet regarded Grinfeather with a nod. "I can't give up on them now. If the province of Adelart truly is the rightful territory of Greifwald, then so too are their citizens ours." With a heavy sigh, Cloudet lowered his head once more. "...I won't be a tyrant." he said, his voice being softer than before."  #i have pardoned a bunch of anti-government radicals and now they are agitating against the government. how could this happen?`
greifwald.32.a:0 ""I just have to keep trying...""

greifwald.33.t:0 "Anarchist's Mistress Captured!"
greifwald.33.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Last night, as part of the initiative to clean up Greifwald's streets, the nation's police launched a series of coordinated raids against criminal gangs. The biggest target was the band of anarchist Morgan Bernier. The raids resulted in the seizure of hundreds of illegal weapons and nearly a ton of narcotics, while nearly a thousand arrests were made, including many of Bernier's top lieutenants and his mistress, who was taken in for questioning.\nBernier himself seems to have eluded capture once again, but his wing may be bent by these developments to prevent him from returning to his former strength." #well we didn't get morgan bernier but we got his girlfriend
greifwald.33.a:0 "Close enough!"

greifwald.34.t:0 "Revelations"
greifwald.34.d:0 "    Smalltail knocked on the door nervously, and Cloudet let him in with about as much confidence. The Count didn't know what the police chief wanted to talk about but... well, with a face like that, it couldn't be good, right? "So remember how, forever ago, we had the police raid Morgan's anarchist bandits and destroyed them?"\n    Oh Tartarus, this was absolutely not good. "Yes," Cloudet egged him on.\n    "And how we didn't nab Morgan himself, but we did get his mistress, and we've been keeping her in prison as a hostage?" Cloudet waved at him to continue. "We... uh... didn't get Morgan's mistress. We got Morgan... and didn't realize it was him... because he was wearing a dress... and no one recognized him."\n    Cloudet stared into Elva's eyes. "I-" He began. "Uh... you..." He turned his head down and carefully massaged his temples with his claws. "You know what? I do want to know. How did no one notice for a year, and how did you finally figure it out?"\n    "I don't know how no one noticed until now. There's no excuse, there will be a difficult conversation with every policegriff he passed on the way to his holding cell. A routine physical is where we finally discovered the, uh, ruse. I think even he was confused."\n    "You put a male in a women's prison and didn't notice for months. Yeah, wow, you're right. There is no excuse for this level of incompetence. You..." Cloudet stopped himself. Elva's head bowed in shame. "I'm sorry." He began again. "I saw her... him... too, and I didn't catch it. We all made mistakes. Just... don't make me have to hear about Morgan again, alright?" Elva sighed and nodded, and left." #turns out we got morgan bernier
greifwald.34.a:0 "This country sucks sometimes."

greifwald.35.t:0 "The First GELA"
greifwald.35.d:0 "    On orders from the Count, the Greifwaldian Excellence in Literature Award has been created. Every few years, a panel of judges will read the most iconic and popular Greifwaldian books released and give the prestigious decoration, plus a small sum of money, to whichever one they feel captures the 'Greifwaldian spirit' the best. It is hoped that this will promote Greifwald's culture to old and new citizens.\n    There are only a few real contenders for the prize. Among them is 'The Birds in Tights', about a heroic bandit leader who fights a farcical guerilla war against the corrupt Vice-Governor of Greifwald as the Governor campaigns with the Emperor elsewhere. While praised for its light-hearted and free spirit, less historically-literate readers struggled to tell where the fictionalized story of Merlock Wood ended and the pure invention began.\n    Another entrant is 'The Exiles', a thinly-veiled autobiography. The unnamed main character was too young to fight in the Republican Revolution and, in the chaos that followed, bounced from cause to cause, settling on Greifwaldian independence. Despite how clueless and brazen the protagonist is, the book bursts with energy and captures the feeling of that time perfectly.\n    A novel not about Greifwald itself, 'Imperially Deranged' is a black comedy about a high-ranking minister in the Griffonian Empire who kills prostitutes to fill the hole in his soul from the petty games he plays to maintain his social status. Its biting satire of Imperial government culture is overshadowed by less-sophisticated readers seeing the protagonist's excessively curated pretend-personality and finding him charming rather than pathetic.\n    The final entrant is 'The Forest's Red Twilight', about a mercenary who joins a company hired to patrol Greifwald in the initial stages of its pacification. The band of outlaws and degenerates goes off the rails with bloodlust and is destroyed by every group in the region at once. One of the panel threw up while reading it from the extreme violence, yet the hauntingly beautiful descriptions of the natural world and the strange demon known as the 'Juror' are unforgettable." #what is the great greifwaldian novel?

greifwald.36.t:0 "Expansion Has Its Price"
greifwald.36.d:0 "The addition of new territory adds an ever increasing burden upon our administration. As Count Cloudet's velvet approach to governance means few, if any, arrests or imprisonments, many of our new subjects freely riot and brazenly protest our rule. But when one is in the business of expanding their realm, a little instability is to be expected. Let them seethe, let them whine. In the end, all will be fine." #a recent conquest has caused some controversy among the loser population
greifwald.36.a:0 "It's just growing pains."

greifwald.37.t:0 "37"
greifwald.37.d:0 "    Cloudet was unsure what possessed him to ask the knife to be brought to his office. He felt as if it was something Ebonwing would've done. The blood was dry, but the splatter was violent, having dripped onto the ornate handle. A beautiful weapon sullied in avoidable tragedy. He rotated the murder weapon, barely distracting himself from the anger and betrayal he'd felt. His kindness and charity, spoiled and exploited.\n    He heard in detail how a Coltaghinian refugee stabbed another in cold blood, all because they happened to find each other, mortal political foes with totally opposing views. Back in Zebrica, they were on other ends of their country. Now, refugees seeking shelter were now mixed with radicals who wanted to bring their war here. Not all took the chance for the new, peaceful life the Count reached out with.\n    Cloudet pondered. Democracy was a dangerous process, a raging train of good things, but always with a high chance to derail. He had to slow down, tighten the ropes that he was untying. Restrictions had to be introduced. The question was, how far? On one hand, he could simply ban all foreign organizations that ever called for a shed of blood.\n    But the road to hell was always paved with good intentions. Today, the nationalists want blood. What if tomorrow it were communists? Religious fundamentalists? Even pacifists themselves? Every cause wanted peace in the long run, but there must have been a point they deemed that violence was the forgivable sin to reach paradise. Would it be best to suppress just those foreigners who loudly called for violence, or take away the liberty of any foreigner to push their vision upon Greifwald, even if peacefully?" #should we ban foreign nationalist groups, or foreign radical groups of all kinds? we're already holding people hostage via threat of extradition

greifwald.38.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The corpse of government member Eliza Day was discovered with her throat slit and barely hidden in a canal not far from her residence. Although there is belief that the murder was committed in lieu of a recent bill she had recently succeeded in passing, one authorizing investigations into the spendings of religious institutions, the slaying has all the markings of the recent string of serial killings. This has been deemed to be yet another unfortunate, but apolitical loss of life." #eliza day just died??

greifwald.39.t:0 "The Boss Returns"
greifwald.39.d:0 "As the ship blew its horn and began to settle at the dock, Cloudet took a breath of fresh air. It wasn't the crisp cold air of Northern Equus, nor the fragrant tropical scent of South-eastern Zebrica, but it was home. Escorted by his plainclothed bodyguards, the Count was led into his car, where an eager aide awaited. "Count, sir! I'm glad to see you safe and sound. How was your trip?"\n    "To be honest? Well, it was..." Cloudet sighed as the car began to drive off. "...Overwhelming. Unpredictable. It's supposed to be all organized and modern, but there's so much chaos in it all too, across each continent. Elections, councils, juntas - those who throw their power away like candy, and those who clutch onto it till their claws bleed. There's models that I'd deem less efficient, though then I'd have to explain how they'd reached wealth and progress...Some models of governance are utterly insane, or so lenient that I wonder how someone just didn't waltz in to just claim they're the new leader...."\n    The aide frowned at the prospect that the Count could've spent the month away for naught. "Oh. I am sorry to hear. Would you say that the trip has been a wast-...I mean, would you say that the trip was not the best use of..."\n    "A waste of time?" Cloudet smiled. He then shook his head at the aide. "No, quite the opposite. As strange as all these countries and their leaders were, I have to spend some time adjusting my approach. I want what's best for Greifwald, but I need to keep power from falling to the wrong talons. I think this trip made me realize what I can and cannot do to our form of government. Best of both worlds! Or...the best of all three continents, if you'd rather. Oh, uhm, driver? Could we stop for coffee and croissants? I missed our bakeries..."" #welcome home, boss!

greifwald.40.t:0 "The Strange Land"
greifwald.40.d:0 "    Cloudet sat behind his desk of fine wood and relaxed. He considered calling for a glass of wine or some other alcohol, but his dietitian insisted he had been drinking too much as of late, and besides, the decision ahead was sure to be a significant one. Even now he could faintly feel the weight on his brain and in his bones of that month spent traveling, and his job left him little time to let the tension work itself out. There were a dizzying array of ideas he had encountered on his journey, but he had sat on what he had heard for many weeks, and he now felt he had enough of a grasp of Republican politics to know what role they ought to play in his own nation.\n    Political studies had turned so devilishly complicated in the universities. He had had no clue that Republicanism had so many wildly different sects split along lines of how to vote, to say nothing of for whom to vote and why. Rattling in his skull were democratic structures that were proven, unproven, were being tested, had worked centuries ago, and might work centuries hence. Back when Cloudet was growing up, and he was simply Ostrick, son of Governor Corbin, all you needed to know was that Republicanism would free you and/or let you rob your landlord. Not only was there so much more, but it was imperative that the solution be tailored to the population's willingness to learn the intricacies thereof.\n    He pulled a pen and set the tip against a piece of paper. He carefully scrawled out the boilerplate introduction to a new decree. As the "owner" of his entire nation, innumerable important leading positions were effectively his employees. A good place to start introducing true Republicanism was to have them be appointed by the public rather than his own household.

greifwald.41.t:0 "The Big City"
greifwald.41.d:0 "    Cloudet felt the voices disappear behind him. The voices of griffons ushering him not to go by himself. But the Count was like a wild wind, and it was impossible to stop him now. After all, there could be only one first day in Griffenheim. He'd never been to the city in his life, he wasn't important enough to be invited, nor rich enough for a night out.\n    In fact, the city was so opulent, so massive, so sprawling and so gorgeous that if you had told him it was his, he'd faint on the spot... Even though that was the truth. The war was already gone in the back of his mind once he was struck with this beauty. He didn't even care that he was now the leader of this land. No. He felt like a kid in the big city once again, running around with his to-do list, spending bill after bill on bakeries, museums, souvenirs, even a short visit to a local wine tasting event.\n    After exactly two hundred and twelve turns, several hours of brisk walking, and a few taxi rides, the Count checked the map. Then, he blinked at it. It became apparent that wherever he was now, it was not on this map, which was for tourists and primarily showed the city center. The count was so excited he was now alone, and in the middle of unfamiliar territory.\n    Yet, even on the streets of a city that he had just taken over, even if it was full of griffons who'd love nothing more than to gut him and leave him to bleed, he knew he was safe. After all, he wasn't ever that important or rich. Who'd recognize him on the street? He certainly didn't get any discounts on the account of being recognized. Now, to find someone who wouldn't brush him off for asking for directions..." #man griffenheim is big

He escorted the Count with his Corporal, each looking left and right to make sure there were no assassins about.\n    "I-I'm okay, I'm okay... " Cloudet chuckled, a little like a madman. His eyes were unfocused and his feathers were ruffled. "Griffenheim is... A slightly overwhelming place. I mean, who would've thought it was home to these martial artists from Klugetown? Tortoise-like fellows who live in the sewers, helped me out when some muggers pulled a gun on me... I had no idea that a staff could incapacitate three griffons at once, I'll tell you that much!"\n    The military policemen shot each other a concerned look.

Sure, he kept to the safer parts of town, but all the same it was something more than the confines of office and court. He could never thank one griffon enough for this privilege, one named Thyme Featherfall. For tonight, Thyme was Cloudet - and Cloudet was Thyme. A brave and loyal double - to whom Cloudet owed these precious hours.\n    After all, Thyme was the reason why the real Cloudet felt the soft paws of his date brush against his underneath the table, the gal giggling ever-so-softly. The waiter brought them two glasses of fine wine, he poured first for the pink-feathered madame of repute, and then to his very own leader, unknowingly. The lady never took her eyes off of her date, her feline tail swishing from side-to-side with infatuation and glee. \n    "...You almost look like Count Cloudet." The lady suddenly said. The griffon felt his blood freeze. "Except you're a dash more handsome~." She cooed. There was still tension that made the griffon unable to speak...Until they heard the live voice of a griffon who introduced himself as Count Cloudet, from the radio near the counter. The lady chuckled. "I may need a pair of spectacles, though."\n    Quietly, the incognito count let out the softest sigh through his beak, bringing his talon to hold hers. "I may not be a count myself - but I promise to make you feel like a countess tonight."\n    The noble lady tried to do everything in her power to prevent the adorable little snort in her giggle, but failed. Cloudet felt his heart throb. He forgot he was who he was. For tonight, he was Thyme Featherfall..." #yes, potential girlfriend, it's not me, count cloudet. look, my body double is on the radio and everything!

Greifwald's victory over Aquileia. "So to summarize, the Aquileian forces over the entire region are now surrendering, or non-factor. Sir, we got them."\n    "It can't all be good news." Cloudet quietly muttered under his breath. "What about those two officers who were arguing earlier outside? Was there an incident? A counter attack?"\n    "Oh, that..." The officer cutely giggled. "They're fighting over whether we'll celebrate with cognac, or champagne. I'm honestly on team cognac - champagne is birthday party level stu--... A-Anyways, sir! We'll soon get to rounding up the Aquileian soldiers. Then, we'll begin sorting out the daunting, long heaps of bureaucracy and protocol that comes with victory. Treaties, agreements, all that."\n    "...Wow." Cloudet scratched his beak with amazement. "We did it? But... How?" He muttered. The odd look he'd earned from the officers made him quickly and nervously change his demeanor. "Er, perfect! You've all done well!... Excuse me for a moment." The count said, and walked out of the room with a slight daze, perhaps to cry in joy, or perhaps to have a smoke.\n    "Is he disappointed?" The officer asked as Cloudet walked away. "Maybe... we took more casualties than he expected? Or maybe he's upset the Aquileian's surrendered later than he'd hoped?"\n    "... I think the Count is just surprised we did it." The other officer softly said. "I mean, if you went back in time and told me that Greifwald would put Aquileia down, I'd probably think you've lost your marbles."" #we own aquleia now?

In the palace Cloudet felt sick, unwelcome. To him, opulence was running water and electricity, a comfortable bed, and three meals a day. Now, in rooms of gold and decadence, he felt lightheaded and uncomfortable.\n    The Count sighed. "If only the artist had spent less making Moriset look like a graceful griffon that he never was, he could've spent the effort painting Aquileia's beautiful landscapes..."\n    The Count took one more look at the huge painting, then at all the trinkets around him. He turned his head to his companion. "On second thought, I'd rather not see the number." Cloudet told the appraiser beside him.\n    "If you say so..." The griffon nervously laughed, scratching the back of his head with a talon. "It's not like I came all the way over here to appraise one of the most expensive collections in the world..."\n    Cloudet giggled. "I still need you to crunch the numbers for a catalogue. I want some of these things sold, others put into museums."\n    The appraiser chuckled. "Remembering my first years working in dad's pawnshop, I can say for sure hoarding expensive things leads to no good. Easier to rob someone with a vault than someone who'd invested it.

On the other end of the table, flanked by his advisors, was Count Cloudet, who was no more at ease, but not for the room. "My good Count, I must ask. Do you know what you are doing?" Eros opened. He had not explicitly said what this meeting was for, but Cloudet could guess.\n    "I am accepting your surrender, Father." Cloudet said.\n    Eros shook his head sadly. "No, I am pleading with you. You are destroying an ancient and holy empire with your actions. Surely, you can recognize that you are standing against Boreas's will."\n    Cloudet waited, and looked around the room. No one was laughing. Softly, he spoke. "Father, a few years ago Greifwald was a backwater warlord state split in two. We had little but ourselves and the teachings of Eyr. Now we are marching through the capital of the mighty Griffonian Empire. I do not pretend to know what Boreas's will is, or whether his gifts will remain where they are forever, but if he has placed his claws on the scales, he has not done it for you."\n    "Count Cloudet. I know you are not a holy griffon. Do not speak for the gods." The Archon asked, grimacing.\n    "Please, accept the ruling of fate gracefully, if not for the gods then for our soldiers. They are still dying." Cloudet begged.\n    "Do not speak for the gods! You know nothing of them!" The Archon demanded. The Count jumped back from the outburst before reaching into a briefcase and pulling out a battle map. He pointed at the Imperial positions as Eros watched. His face contorted into rage and his beak ground against itself. He stood up in his chair. "Why, you-" He began, waving a talon. "You, you... YOU..." As he balled his claws into a fist, a trickle of blood fell from his beak. He sat back down slowly and slumped forwards, drooling on the table." #we own griffenheim now?

It was odd to the young bird that his Empire be conquered from underneath him, yet the conqueror still came to his mighty chair and bowed with reverence before the emperor. "I think you're supposed to be gloating." He mumbled to no one in particular.\n    "Emperor Grover, I harbor no ill will towards the Griffonian Empire." Count Cloudet began. Grover VI motioned and the leader rose. "I have merely done what I must as a fellow head of state to defend my people's freedom and independence from a rival power."\n    "What will happen to me?" The child asked.\n    Cloudet looked around. "We are still working it out." He admitted. "We did not expect to be in this position, in case you couldn't guess. We're trying to figure out how to manage the Empire to best maintain peace and stability in Greifwald. It's a process that will likely involve you, but we do not want to say anything definitive at this time."\n    "It's a process that won't involve the Archon, either, from what I hear."

That question alone made Cloudet sick, and he closed his eyes...Reopening them to be faced with evil. Ferdinand Dawnclaw, beaten and tied.\n    Despite his poor vision, Dawnclaw grinned with his bloodied beak. He knew who he was looking at. "...Cloudet. Who...Would have known that this dump of a country you inherited would bring me here...You know, no historian will believe this. They'll write that the Empire was dissolved in anarchy and civil war, but nobody would have the guts to pick up the pen and say that Greifwald took down--"\n    "Ferdinand Dawnclaw." Cloudet said, with sterness the albino did not expect. "You stand before me as a griffon who has killed so many for his own greed and power - for sowing seeds of chaos into the Empire's citizens and taking the throne you did not have the right to. Even going as low as to kill children with your cold talons, in cold blood. Emperor or not I cannot forgive you for this. Ferdinand Dawnclaw, for your crimes, you are sentenced to life in solitary confinement. Take him away."\n    "T-That's it!?" Ferdinand shouted. "That's why you're so furious!?

"Your "nation" is doomed if you don't have the guts to do what's right, even if it means killing a child - just as you don't have the guts to kill me!

The original document was made official with a seal made of his own coagulated blood, and all copies were dotted with drops of it. Upon Aekold's copy was more blood - his own. Whether nosebleed caused by high blood pressure or self harm, he did not take the final words of his mentor well. Not at all. Yet, tears too did stain his copy; and so did Cloudet stain his own copy with his own cries.\n    When the two met, Aekold slightly shook in despair and fury. He'd swipe his talon across Cloudet's neck if he had the chance, but he was undeniably spiritual. He knew that the so-called afterlife would repay his defiance to a dying wish tenfold. He sighed before the young griffon. “Count.” Aekold bowed his head. “You've...familiarized yourself with Ebonwing's-...?”\n    “Will.” Cloudet nodded. He rubbed his eyes with a talon. Aekold was frankly surprised by his refusal to hide his emotional state. “Yes...I practically read it over and over again. It's...A lot to take in, knowing these are the final words he'd ever pass onto me.”\n    Aekold did not enjoy what fate had chosen for multiple reasons these last few days, but he felt comfort in one thing. Ebonwing was not a stepping stone or a footnote to the Count. Aekold would never willingly call himself a friend of Cloudet, but at least on this day they were ones who'd lost the same piece of their souls. Equally placed on the scales. “As his words will it, the Temple of Eyr shall commence closer cooperation with your government. He decreed we serve you for the good of all griffons of the nation. We're ready to send our griffons to receive your orders, and to advise or be advised.”\n    This was the first thing that made Cloudet smile today, just a little. A boon, a gift of his old friend that was out of his reach. He'd never insist upon or even ask Ebonwing something like this, he respected him and his faith. Yet, this was an undeniable step in the right direction. “...Thank you Aekold. I'm glad we can pursue a better future together now. Let's make up for all the years our organizations have kept one another at an arm's length.” He said. Albeit disgruntled, Aekold nodded - and the two shook talons." #sadly, ebonwing has died of being old. his replacement is here though

The officers and soldiers keep making jokes that we'd fight some archers in the woods - but...my good friend, i-it's still an armed conflict."\n    "There, there, Cloudet." Ebonwing calmly, soothingly said. "It's only natural that war and its consequences fret you, that is the sign of a good leader. Yet - anxiety clouds the mind, in the end. That is not a state we can afford to be in."\n    "I know, Ebonwing." Cloudet absently said, eyes glued to the birds, frogs, and rabbits that frolicked around the sacred grounds. "But until I know that whatever goes down with Adelart ends well, I won't be able to sleep much. Eh, not like I could sleep before, not with the strangler in Falcontown...Heard another victim appeared last night, not far from here either..."\n    Ebonwing found the resolve to smile. "The serial killings are a matter for the law and order, I'm afraid, yet I assure you that you are most safe. Let us focus on the larger issue at hand. As I said, please be calm now. You see, we in the Temple - we've always had our ways...And our tricks. And...well, I'll just say you can sleep easy knowing that I've prepared a trick for our little new war as well.

Such was Maar's empire. Ebonwing looked up. No one had spoken in a while. "I suppose this means the meeting is over." He said with the firmness his worn body could muster.\n    The others, mostly griffons but a few strange creatures, muttered and mumbled with each other as they left. Today's meeting of the council had accomplished little, as they usually did, but that was the way of things. Ebonwing himself had no post-meeting business and so he went, thinking about the journey here. It had been multiple lifetimes and he was fortunate enough to witness all the best moments of Maar's return. Soon enough, there he was on a balcony in the palace formerly belonging to the Imperial Family, overlooking Griffenheim in the twilight with the Ziggurat annihilating the skyline in the near distance. In the gardens below, a few sets of legs pattered as a family of ghostly nightcrawlers began their nightly walk. The creatures were little more than a pair of legs and a stubby head and their walks never took them anywhere, but they bothered no one and were well-liked for it. One bent down to eat a fallen apple: The plants were fruiting more so that the lack of agriculture didn't cause a famine. At least, not yet.

He, or she, wore a red shawl and confidently strode past the corpses slowly being returned to the earth around them. Three black-robed figures appeared from the undergrowth to challenge the wanderer, and with one, two, three slashes they were all dispatched, with a fourth swing to bisect the bush that had risen up alongside the defenders. The figure, still dripping with blood and sap, put the sword back wherever it had been grabbed from, and stopped down to pick up a small paper card covered in occult symbols, and, pleased with themselves, continued walking.\n    This was what Greifwald had been before the Empire's effete talons had grasped it, Ebonwing was sure of that. Deep down he knew that he would be here forever, however long that turned out to be, but he wasn't upset, it was a fine place to spent the rest of a life.\n\n\n    Lindt was a bit surprised to find the Archon sleeping in a chair outside.

Others whisper - complete social climber. For this reason, the light shone upon someone else.\n    A house-sized demon who seemed up to the challenge. Maybe Barbas anticipated it. Maybe he didn't. Yet, he was more level-headed. Charismatic. Likeable. This crisis of succession was formed by that fact alone, that although the priests knew Aekold was assigned to be the next, they were reluctant to accept the fact. They all wanted Barbas, like a child of a divorced couple who wanted to be with the parent who'd lost the custodial battle.\n    To prevent tensions and religious strife, the priests, greater in number, gathered.

Griffons whose talons were marked with needle spots would claw at the armed soldiers, not caring about the rifle pointed at their face. As they fell to the ground, the armed griffs noticed the strangest feature. Black blood dripping from their wounds.\n    The commander kicked open the door - into the orphanage. Their long investigation led them here. Armed with firearms and intent, they stormed the building expecting hostiles, though there were screaming, cowering children. The burly soldiers stormed towards one young griffon in particular.  The child was slender, with purple feathers and tired eyes. He screamed as he ran through the orphanage, but didn't make it far as a soldier immediately tackled him.\n    "No! No! Leave me alone!" Screamed the child as he started to claw with his talons at the soldier that tried to restrain him. The trooper shouted in pain as one lucky claw managed to swipe across his face, drawing blood. In retaliation, the trooper felt no remorse as he smashed the butt of his rifle into the child's beak, causing his black blood to splash onto his face.\n    The soldier immediately began screaming, recoiling as the blood of the suspect started to mix with his own. The commander was the last to arrive on site, when he saw his subordinate writhe and shout, first from pain... and then, rage.\n    "Idiot!" The commander cried. "Take his gun away, now!" He barked out the order to his troops. The other armed griffons ran up to him, but his resistance was intense. He started to shove and punch his comrades away, then took his gun...and pointed it at the terrified, cowering children and caretakers.\n    Only then, the black-blooded child pecked the mad griffon in his paw, distracting him... and allowing the commander to take the headshot with his pistol. Screams echoed through the orphanage, including the target, who found himself covered in the red blood. It became black before their very eyes. As the commander approached, the child resisted. The adult was sure to be more careful, but the child continued to yell. "Don't touch me! I'm cursed! I'm cursed, I'm--"\n    "Calm down! We're here to help you!" The commander shouted. Yet, the child shook his head, resisting as best he could. "We'll cure you, just relax! Corporal, put the bag over his head and take him!"\n    The child kept crying and screaming, but refused to fight as he was dragged away. He knew well what could happen if his blood spread... He did not want any more mad, insane griffons to roam the streets of his home." #we found black blood

How could any Griffon of Boreas tolerate this vandalism? He watched as they unearthed a vault within, emerging with nothing but a mere scroll of parchment. "Is this it?" The commander asked the Maarite scholar. He carefully passed the dusty, coarse paper over to him. The scholar took careful note of the words written upon it, studying them closely. The commander knew that the screams of the priest indicated it was exactly what they were looking for.\n    "No, no!" The priest cried. "Why is it here!? Why did they bury it underneath this sacred place!?" He tried to break away from the soldiers that held him, only to receive a swift butt of a rifle into his stomach.\n    "If you do not know what artifacts your temple holds, blasphemer... " The Maarite scholar murmured. "...Then this faith is not true to you. Yes, sir. These are the scrolls we're looking for. Would you fancy to test them? On second thought... It's a good thing we had placed Maar's protective blessings upon ourselves before we came here, because I believe they may have already been activated." Said the scholar, feeling the paper suddenly become warm. He had merely read the words to himself, and it was enough... The commander did not understand - not until the terrible sound of crashing was heard outside. The soldiers watched how in addition to the destruction they had already caused, more was being added. A brick was thrown through the stained glass, and it allowed the angered shouts of the mob to be heard. They ventured onto the streets... Where the once peaceful village had turned into Tartarus in a manner of minutes, as peasants shouted bloody fury, fighting among themselves. Windows broken, fistfights breaking out, anarchy reigned within sheer minutes.\n    "We got what we came for. Turn your safeties off and return to the transport." The commander said. The priest was let go - and so he stood by himself in the temple he loved so much...It didn't take long before, with a cry of sheer fury and rage, he approached a statue that honored Boreas, and with incredible strength, toppled it - taking with it the candlesticks which spilled the hateful flames upon the carpet. The temple was engulfed with flames, and the mad screams of the once-tranquil, once-pious Father."

Greifwald was beset on all sides by aggressive competitors and needed to secure itself against outside influences. It pained the prelate to see his friend so distraught: Cloudet had slaved away for countless sleepless nights seeking answers to a problem well outside his control.\n    The prelate's friend sat in one of the chairs set before the grand desk. “We are at a crossroads. I have no heir to give responsibility for my work, much of which still needs to be done. I can't turn to our political neighbors for help - that would end Greifwald as we know it.” Cloudet rested his head upon a propped claw. “I... I am left with only one option. And... I...”\n    Ebonwing frowned - he knew precisely which option Cloudet hesitantly alluded to. To complicate matters further, it also sounded like an old prophecy that made vague allusions to “the cloud letting the temple in silently”. Here was Cloudet undoubtedly knowing Ebonwing could offer a solution to his problems. The prelate asked what Cloudet couldn't: “You want the Temple to help strengthen your position, is that what you mean?”\n    The count sat in resigned silence, painfully aware of the answer, but unable bring himself to speak the words, his eyes instead pleading for help he desired.\n    The Temple had ample power, money, and resources, all of which Cloudet desperately needed, but bringing the Temple in to assist with governmental affairs could easily make the count look weak. The prelate simply could not bear to see his friend be compromised, but he now had a prophecy to fulfill: the cloud was silently letting the temple into the government. How could he refuse fate?\n    The prelate let out a resigned sigh. “The Temple will help, my friend. Quietly and secretly. You need not worry.”" #ebonwing you are truly my greatest ally :)

And if that happens, I may be suspected for making up facts about...the research...?”\n    “It makes sense, doesn't it?” The glasses-griffon cooed as she filed her talons. “The higher ups are expecting us to analyze texts that practically came in clutch during a grand siege. Now what would they say if you came sooner than they expected? Don't you think they'd assume you've half-assed the project and made something up just to have more time for yourself?”\n    “That...” The investigator found himself stuck as he blinked at the table. “So...How long should...I--”\n    “Take a hike. I mean, from here to the hills, and back. Should take a week or so.” She said. “That's enough time for us to do the finishing touches. Take long enough, and that wine we've got in the caskets will be just a little bit tastier too. It makes sense, doesn't it?” She asked. And as the griffon nodded - shaky and unsure, she smirked. “Atta boy. Watch out for the wolverines!”\n    With that, he left - to walk from here to the hills, and return. The extra week was fine enough for her to enjoy her new toy for the last moments she could before too many suspicions fell on her. She laughed at its simplicity - merely say “it makes sense, doesn't it?” at the end of a relatively compelling argument, and its intensity will triple in size.\n    She kicked her legs back on the table, and summoned one of the assistant scribes over. “Massage my paws, please.

Not - 'maybe will help' us in the next five, ten years. Now, mister Franc. We know you've been...playing with our people's resources, but playtime is over. We need real machinery.

Cloudet corrected him.\n    "No, just Chrysalis." Trimmel corrected back. "The one who deserved the title only existed in propaganda leaflets and on street corners. What the one on the throne deserved was a good stoning, and I'm not talking about the Elements of Harmony." He laughed at the idea. The Count chuckled along politely, but he didn't have Trimmel's strange sense of humor. "Whatever the case, I felt this was something you should be warned about before I go ahead with it. I am willing to take full responsibility for any plundering or massacre that you find out of order."\n    The Count rubbed his eyes. "That's fine, and you may go ahead with it, but it does make me worry. I suppose I should have known that not every changeling would be unduly maligned. War brings out the worst of every society. What can be done about it?"\n    "Your majesty, that is a question for Herr Vect. He can think outside the bun. I just 'live más', as they say in Sicameon.""

greifwald.104.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]An interesting sight unfolded on the streets of Falcontown's Coursbourg district last Wednesday as thousands of Changelings marched in support of Kama Voll. Dubbed 'Little Lyctida', Coursbourg has been the primary destination of the Changelings and their allies who have fled the political situation on Equus. Among these refugees is the issue of the day, one Kama Voll, who was arrested three months ago for armed robbery and was sentenced the previous week.\nAt the protest, Changelings clashed with law enforcement and demanded her release. They argued that the verdict was discrimination, that the witnesses of every race who testified against her were motivated by racism, and that she had been nothing but honorable during her service in the Wehrmacht as a Range Safety Officer."

The recent disturbances with the changeling immigrants had affected him more than he had expected. It was not hard to see why, it just didn't make sense – they had everything a creature should need to be satisfied, hardly less than the native-born griffons had, and yet they weren't satisfied, they were furious. The demand of the protesters was for preferential treatment, pure and simple, and even Cloudet felt that was a bad precedent to set.\n    He realized he had stopped outside the office of one Marshal-General Trimmel. His own advisors had been unusually unhelpful. Trimmel was a military bug who had talked around political issues in the past, but these were his own people. Cloudet knocked. "Come in," the slightly-muffled voice answered.\n    "Where's the beef, comrade?" Trimmel absentmindedly asked as he carefully folded some report into a paper airplane. He saw that it was the Count himself who had entered and hastily snapped to a changeling salute, then wilted where he stood as he remembered that was not how the Count wanted to be greeted. He began to sputter out an apology, but the Count just laughed, and the Marshal-General resigned himself to having suffered a minor embarrassment. "Blegh... what can I do for you, good sir?"\n    "It's the issue with the changeling immigrants. The protests about this or that. I figured you might have an interesting perspective on that."

If they aren't doing what you want, you haven't kicked them hard enough."\n    Cloudet raised an eyebrow. "You treat your dogs like that?"\n    Trimmel waved it off. "Not mine, no.

He was in the war room of the palace, a place he didn't often go, but one of Trimmel's brilliant new ideas had turned into an argument that reached the highest level and Cloudet was personally called on the phone.\n    It began with a plan to buy opium from overseas, then airdrop it into camps and fortifications held by enemies under the expectation they would take it and use it. Opium addicts are far less combat-effective than normal soldiers. Opium users are even worse. At the very least it would be a guided weapon, a way to get enemies to turn themselves into casualties as they were forced to go to rehab. A crass plan, but a functional one.\n    Then the other side of the coin came into play. Trimmel's next plan was to do the opposite for Greifwaldian soldiers. Methamphetamine made soldiers faster, tougher, better. Yet its addiction was no less debilitating or painful, and to willingly inflict it on your own people was monstrous.\n    And yet again, if every Greifwaldian soldier was simply MORE, then that didn't really change the calculus of the suffering of war. If ten griffons could undergo the risks and pain normally carried by twelve, wasn't that more efficient in a cynical and utilitarian way? Shorter hours at the factory, fewer empty seats at tables, so on, an extra few weeks or months of peace afterwards and so on?\n    Revoltingly, it held some appeal.\n    The generals, mostly griffons but some changelings, watched as the Count turned it over in his head. Trimmel sat at the head, trying to predict the odds the Count would fall one way or the other and silently preparing to not have what he wanted this time." #ey boss can i hab de meth

Count Cloudet had not known many socialists, but he had known a few, and as a national leader, he had different information than the commoners. What socialist states did exist were always of two faces, one of a perfect society with enough asterisks to crush a griffon to death, and one of simple delusion. It was a nice idea that reality couldn't handle.\n    Rumors had long circulated that the new Marshal's close acquaintance, one General Vect, had sympathies for socialist causes. His allies certainly didn't and so Cloudet didn't worry about it. Then Vect had done something unexpected; he came to Cloudet and asked for a favor.\n    The Count looked over the small sheaf of papers as Vect waited expectantly. Cloudet wondered what the changeling equivalent of a talons-up was, because Trimmel must have been doing it just beyond the door to encourage his ever-hesitant friend. Well, the plan was very "Vect" for lack of a better word. He wanted to run an experiment. Greifwald would take a state (Aiwle was the natural choice), give it some separation from the rest of the new empire, remove the old rulers, and replace it with a system of workers' cooperatives. No terrorists, no international sanctions, just a few years to see if a poor state could be improved through an ultra-modern political philosophy. With the rest of the empire to serve as a safety net and an easy route back to normal governance, it couldn't even implode the way so many revolutionary states had done before. Yet failure would still mean impoverishment.\n    Cloudet rubbed his temples. He was an emperor now. There was the means and even the expectation that he would spend big on vanity projects. He had no love of grand palaces or exotic metals. This idea, though, would prove something important no matter what happened. He grabbed his pen." #socialist state part 1

greifwald.117.d:0 "    The Aiwle experiment has run for three years now, and it is not yet done bearing fruit, nor has its progress gone un-monitored. However, there have been many interesting developments, and it is my belief that now is a good time to explain what has happened ever since this began.\n    The good news: Economic efficiency is up, and higher levels of social cohesion and job satisfaction are consistently reported. Wealth inequality has shrunk dramatically. Most importantly, the average Griffon feels far less alienated from their society than before and increasingly strives to be an active participant in the political process.\n    That last point is also the source of much of the bad news. Consider the peasant class who, liberated from the whips of their landlords, have not become a model proletariat. Instead they simply left many of their fields fallow, growing enough to sustain their own communities and little else. The cities complained, so the patriarchs and matriarchs of the villages attempted to rope entire regions into, essentially, agricultural unions to maintain and abuse a monopoly on crops. A famine was only averted with dozens of arrests. This naked self-interest is only unusual in its scope, and tension exists constantly between state quotas and workers, between managers and their auditors across the hall, and between new technocrat-dictators and leadership realities. Efficiency is up, but output is down everywhere.\n    The theory for this is that, unlike a socialist revolution, there was no preexisting meritocratic structure that replaced the government. The top of society was simply removed. When given control over the means of production, the workers do with it what the barons and the crony capitalists did before – be petty and selfish, except now it's a self-serving group rather than a self-serving individual.\n    This has itself a silver lining, though. Unlike most, this socialist state is obviously not run by terrorists and brigands." #socialist state part 2

greifwald.118.d:0 "    The socialist experiment in Aiwle continued and, given more time, did not resolve its fundamental issues, merely learned to mitigate them while uncovering new ones. Increasingly, cooperatives competing for the system's limited resources have turned to graft and nepotism to get ahead of their partner cooperatives, occasionally veering into outright crimes. Internal audits have been less reliable every passing year due to upper managers being bureaucratic cousins to state auditors. The technocrat overseers of the cooperatives have finally settled into their role properly, but in many cases this was enabled not by practice, but by cooperatives forming a parallel bureaucracy with a mandate to ignore all but the most unified workplace democracy as they dispassionately push through competent managers instead of ideological firebrands or eloquent idealists.\n    The most visible problem remains the rural/urban divide, which broke into protests, then counter-protests, and then riots and counter-riots as the farmers battled for the freedom to tend their farms with no regard to the food needs of the state. The barons were at least afraid enough of rebellion to limit their squabbles between each other, but the baron-collectives are of the masses, and the masses do not fear rebellion. While the Sterdamm killings of four councilors once shocked the nation for months, there have been five farmer's riots in south Aiwle with at least as many fatalities. A few murders are also suspected to be assassinations related to cooperative politics.\n    Every economic and social issue makes prices and availability for commodities more unstable than they already are, and thus encourages theft and corruption to get ahead of the broken system, thus exacerbating the economic and social issues. Given time, Aiwle is unlikely to right itself. Any future experiments would be better off getting a fresh start, and although I will regret the termination of this program, it is the right choice." #socialist state part 3

Trimmel slapped her hoof away and snarled. She ignored the gesture. She didn't like Moonburger and she didn't like Trimmel. Unlike Chrysalis, though, Trimmel didn't shoot messengers, so giving him bad news was fun. "We decided it's you."\n    He was already halfway through the first pack of fries when the portly bug realized what she had told him and twisted his face with equal parts terror and disappointment. "Narcys, four meters below you is the S.K.V.D.'s worst agent, and, well, the number of days he has left in him is less than the number of limbs that are stil attached. I'd tear out an eye for you as a message for the cabal but it's less fun when they can't see what I'm doing to them and I already threw out his spare. Maybe I'll send you on with some teeth. Anything to remind my so-called 'friends' that it's me they're dealing with. Who put my name in? Who thought I should run a country? Tell me."\n    She sighed. She should have expected him to start sharing details. "Marshal-General, everyone already knows about your... hobby. I can assure you nobody was happy with the decision. Like it or not, however, you have built a coalition featuring every kind of character and ideology, and the only things they all agree on are that they owe you their lives at least once each, that you're fair and effective, and that at least one of those are both more important to them than how much they hate you."" #heh, you know, i really shouldn't be in charge you blithering idiots

greifwald.121.t:0 "The Monstrous Red Dragon"
greifwald.121.d:0 "    As leader, public relations work was never far away. The creatures of Greifwald all wanted to feel like Count Cloudet was looking out for them personally, and that meant not only the rich and the poor, the educated and the illiterate, the urban and the rural, but every once in a while, the Count was to break bread with the land's newest minority – the changelings. It helped them to accept him as their new monarch, and the Greifwaldian griffons to accept them as their new co-nationals.\n    Normally, this came with a Griffonian flair to keep the new arrivals from feeling like they could be Changeling nationals abroad. Yet Trimmel had insisted on one piece of home being allowed to come with them, and on being seen with the Count as they experienced it for the cameras. It was odd since, normally, the Marshal-General normally let interviews and press releases do the heavy lifting.\n    Cloudet had once been impressed (terrified, even) by Trimmel effortlessly lifting his own body weight in lead bricks despite being so pudgy. "All warfare is based on deception", the changeling had said wryly. He now saw something even more frightful, the other side of how such an active creature could be that fat. The Count took a hesitant bite of the titular food behind Chrysalis Fried Chicken and found it still bitter with salt and wet with grease, and was still unable to ignore the loud chewing and spatters of flesh as Trimmel snapped bones and tore apart a family-size bucket of the breaded meat, his body a temple to gluttony and unrestraint.\n    "Ifn't thif houf-licking goud?" The bug asked before bothering to swallow.  Cloudet muttered something and Trimmel chose to hear it as agreement. "Ah, yeah. Your royal dietician is a smart fellow but never enjoying yourself buys you so few days it might as well be a rounding error. Luckily, this is official business. DON'T say I never gave you anything."\n    Cloudet felt like one more bite would cause him to have a heart attack." #hello, cloudet. i love you :)

Even if one was given to me I wouldn't know what to do with it. I don't like needing to take initiative all the time, I don't like doing everything myself and having ultimate responsibility for everything. Alas, when it became indisputable that Chrysalis was not who I was promised, I waited for someone else to pick up the torch for me when I should have taken it and given it to the right creature. So someone else picked her successor for me. What a disaster that was!" Trimmel rambled on about his life story. Cloudet was becoming uncomfortable. This trip wasn't supposed to involve Trimmel. In fact, Trimmel wasn't supposed to be in town at all, he was supposed to be overseeing the Aquileia Branch. And this drive was supposed to take ten minutes, not forty-five. And he really was worried about reports of fake orders being given in his own royal name. Trimmel continued. "A good leader is harsh, but fair. They keep you on the right track, they say no to things that go against the overall objective. In a country, the overall objective is the soul of an entire people so it must be watched carefully. I'm not waiting for someone else to make the first move this time. If a leader must be replaced, then let it be so. I'll work out the details later."\n    "Trimmel, I'm a bit concerned by the direction this conversation is taking," Cloudet interjected. Outside, the limousine was on a random side road now.\n    Trimmel stared at him dully, then rubbed his eyes as if he had suddenly become exhausted. "Sir, the time to be 'a bit concerned' was when I first arrived. The time to be scared was two months ago. Now is the time to be resigned." The limousine slowly rolled to a stop. A half-dozen armed changelings stood around the woods, watching the vehicle, weapons held tightly." #hi cloudet! i'm gonna kill you :D

I'm just Thyme Featherfall. And... I'm doing well, I think. Today's a rather quiet day, isn't it?"\n    "..." The doctor's facial expression softened, though this could always be a trick. It wasn't unusual for patients to pretend they're not crazy just to get released. Still, to her, this was a good start. Maybe in a few years, a decade or a few, there was hope for this griffon to reintegrate into society.\n    When Cloudet was allowed to step out into the yard, surrounded by barbed wire and fences, he sat down on a bench and sighed. He saw Trimmel and those gunmen each time he closed his eyes, almost always in his dreams. How he hated that changeling - how he wished he was here, so that he could show him his fury for having his trust and kindness abused.\n    He sat so still, that when he opened his eyes, he was surprised to a little butterfly that had landed on his beak. Cloudet found the humor in nature's act. It reminded him - that not everyone was lucky to end up here after staring down a barrel, let alone several.\n    Cloudet noted - this was a book definition of an ironic end, for he was in some way dead.

May the gods have mercy on the souls of all involved. Today was the day when he fully subsumed the identity of Count Cloudet, and as such, he sat behind the desk he had so often stood in front of, stared at the reams of paper, and comprehended what exactly was being asked of him.\n    He did not have the slightest idea in whose favor he should rule, or how. Even if he did, he would struggle to put pen to paper and make his word law. He was a military creature, and this was a civil issue. His solutions were unbefitting of a civilian administration and would not at all be like the Count he was trying to imitate.\n    He put the paper down and picked up the phone to dial a specific room in the Department of Defense. "Hey, Vect. I have a question. You know that union dispute in Pulliers?" He began. "Vect, I know you. You've been following it pretty closely.

Those of you who met her might guess that the Youth Leader's version of our monarch was somewhat more civilized than the real thing. We can re-use this, however. Think about it." He waved his hooves about. "Wasn't Cloudet so much more reasonable, and even-tempered, and domesticated? Wouldn't it be nice if the creatures of Greifwald imitated him? And since we are using his government as a hoof-puppet, we should learn to imitate him, too. Questions?"\n    Narcys Murx's hoof shot up. [Root.TrimmelGuilt1]\n    "That's besides the point!"

The relatively youthful bug said cheerfully. "I'm just glad you understood how badly you were needed here, and the commensurate paycheck."\n    "The pay IS nice...

At least we got rid of that annoying dietitian. He would have talked my ear off if he found out how much pizza I was eating."\n    Vaspier chuckled. "Not them.

greifwald.128.d:0 "Above Trimmel's fireplace, there was a painting of a monster from Griffonian mythology. One priest or another had had a vision of this many-headed beast conquering a lady of the sun. In this particular painting, color balance reasons had left the dragon's scales as yellow or tan rather than the original red. Trimmel had asked once, and Vect had answered. In Griffonia he was called the Great Red Dragon because of the propaganda surrounding him and Celestia, mixed with one incident where Synovial called him something similar during his stay in Griffenheim.\n    That had sounded more poetic than he knew Synovial to be. Vect had explained that "he was mad because you were trying to get a Kirian book on guerrilla warfare into the officer school curriculum" and did not know about the story, or the series of artworks. The media had run with it anyways.\n    Now he sat back and looked up at the painting, which always elicited a joke for being such a frightening piece given a place of honor in the reading room. He didn't feel like reading tonight. It had been a long time since he'd been able to take out his frustrations. About losing The War. About being an enemy of the state in his homeland. About the fact that his family was associated with him and his failures. About the depressing, cynical Comedy of the Count and the Marshal done for the public's sake. About the fact that he was in charge of a country now, the thing he had feared more than death itself.\n    Most of all, about the fact that there had been one person on the planet who was willing to accept him for who he was, and he had let that blind him to the fact she was also the one person on the planet who deserved to experience his dreams of chronic and sustained cruelty.\n    Did the dragon fear ushering in the apocalypse? No. Trimmel felt a need to be like it.\n    He took the painting off the wall, disassembled the frame, pulled off the paper canvas, and did something he could never tell about.\n    He consumed."

The battle of Vesalipolis had gone so well, not without flaws but it had ended in a clear victory with the Greifwaldian flag flying atop the great spire in the center of the hive. Resistance had been crushed and the enemy routed after long, hard-fought campaigns. Yet, the city outside was filled with more gunfire and screaming than it had been during the battle. It had all turned when an order was given allowing soldiers to forage the city for supplies before moving on, an order which the army had interpreted as “plunder whatever you please from whoever you please and kill any who resist”. Vect’s own attempts to stop the rampant looting were stymied by the fact it was an order directly from Marhsal-General Trimmel, the one who could counteract the order, elaborate for the soldiers and make them listen.\n    He turned a corner and saw movement on a balcony of the Queen’s former palace. Trimmel and another changeling were pacing. Not pacing, dancing. Not another changeling, a wooden mannequin wearing a flowing dress. He held the object in his magic as he went through the steps of a waltz on the reflective marble floor, swinging it from one side to the other to the beat he wove in his own head from the sounds of fire and death outside. The duo carved lines in the air as they disturbed the ash that sat upon it. Beyond the banister, the city was in perpetual morning by the glow of a thousand incinerations and the black smoke-filled sky.\n    Vect realized then what he should have realized when he saw how broad that order was, that this massacre was not an accident, but was the intended result. He backed outwordlessly. In the deepest pit of his heart, he knew his shame was finite. The beast this nation loved had turned his gaze back home and found a nation that consorts with beasts.

AET_new_depatriates:0 "Correct the Depatriates"
AET_new_depatriates_desc:0 "The previous leaders of Greifwald, the Cloudet family, loved to pretend to be educated. They surrounded themselves with the most credentialed bunch of reactionaries and statists they could find to keep up this appearance. We can do better. We can get real thinkers with the correct thoughts aimed at the proper ends."
AET_ban_religion:0 "Abolish Organized Religion"

AET_burning_person_desc:0 "Originally a theoretical festival dedicated to art, music, and maximum and boundless personal expression, we will make the Burning Creature a cultural institution.

AET_anarchist_global_domination_desc:0 "Freeing the world will be a long and bloody struggle, but the griffons and the other creatures must learn to accept that we have nothing to lose but their chains.It is a moral and historical imperative that the world order be destroyed and a more equitable one be built anew atop the remains."

AET_anarchist_republic_1_desc:0 "The most dangerous threats come from within and the clearest source of this is the degenerate petty dictators and warlords in the north who oh-so-proudly proclaim their revolutionary intent even as they salivate over neighboring countries.

AET_anarchist_republic_3_desc:0 "So many nations resulted in so many concepts, so many attempts and prototypes, all ripe for the taking and annexing into our own means and methods. The cause of progress will get good use out of these one-off designs and what was learned from them."
AET_anarchist_kingdom_1:0 "Destroy the Liberals"
AET_anarchist_kingdom_1_desc:0 "The so-called 'revolutionaries' of Aquileia only wanted to take power from the king and transfer it to the bourgeoisie.

AET_anarchist_kingdom_2:0 "Storm the Bastille"
AET_anarchist_kingdom_2_desc:0 "We have, of course, already liberated all the prisoners, but the metaphorical fortress-prisons of Aquileia bear untold caches of arms and armors for our use and the revolution needs every ounce of war material."

AET_complete_neutrality_desc:0 "We must maintain complete and utter neutrality in our dealings with both the Aquileians and the Imperials.

AET_appease_neither:0 "Independence"
AET_appease_neither_desc:0 "The Empire would not accept us as a truly independent vassal, and Aquileia would not do so either.

AET_neutral_factories_desc:0 "With no outside assistance, picking up the Greifwaldian economy will be a long and arduous journey featuring many late hours, but alas, this is the cost of owing no one anything, and for that it will be worth it when we can simply have our own day."
AET_neutral_science:0 "Correct the Record"
AET_neutral_science_desc:0 "The journalists of Greifwald rile up the populace on every issue, demanding the government commit suicide on the altar of public opinion.

AET_imperial_forts:0 "The Enemy to the South"
AET_imperial_forts_desc:0 "With our close ties to the Griffonian Empire, it is sadly quite possible that we may be drawn into a conflict with the Kingdom of Aquileia and her allies.

AET_align_aquileia_desc:0 "The Griffonian Empire may have been the strongest power on the continent once, but those days are long gone. It is very likely that the Kingdom of Aquileia will become the dominant power in Griffonia, and so we should seek cooperation with the Aquileians."
AET_aquileian_arms:0 "Import Aquileian Weaponry"
AET_aquileian_arms_desc:0 "As the Greifwaldian industrial base is quite small, it may be in our best interest to purchase some weapons from the Aquileians.

AET_aquileian_adivosrs_desc:0 "The Aquileian Military is one of the most advanced in the world. It may be possible to organise a joint military mission with the Aquileian high command. We would be able to learn a lot of new tactics and doctrines for our own military."

AET_aquileian_industry_desc:0 "While it might be difficult to convince Aquileians to invest into Greifwald, it would not only improve our economy, but also bind us closely to Aquileia. This would help our diplomatic and political standing on the world stage."
AET_aquileian_economic_help:0 "Request a Loan from Aquileia"
AET_aquileian_economic_help_desc:0 "The Aquileian economy is much larger than that of Greifwald.

AET_develop_aquileian_desc:0 "Our heavy industry is still lacking, despite all our efforts. But now that we have close ties to the Aquileian economy, we are in a position to change this.

AET_aquileian_guarantee:0 "A Friendship with the Eagles of the West"

AET_aquileian_forts:0 "The Enemy in the North"
AET_aquileian_forts_desc:0 "We are now formally in the Aquileian sphere of influence, and as such, the possibility of conflict with the Griffonian Empire looms over our heads. Fortifying our northern border will allow us to stop any Imperial incursion into Greifwald before it even begins."

AET_aquileian_faction_desc:0 "As the most powerful nation in the Peripherie, and the gateway between them and the Empire, Aquileia must be able to see the value in our peaceful cooperation with them in military matters.

AET_conquer_HEL_desc:0 "The territories of Lissay and Eagleton, now composing the nation of Adelart, have been an integral part of Greifwald for centuries, before they were taken from us less than 20 years ago. Many griffons living there are still loyal to the Greifwaldian nation as their government is descending into extractionism... and our government needs the money from their oil fields."
AET_core_HEL:0 "Reintegrate Adelart"

AET_new_country:0 "Springtime for Greifwald"
AET_new_country_desc:0 "The Unification of Greifwald has had a tremendous effect on our nation: for the first time in decades, the griffons of Greifwald can be proud of their nation, and support for our government is at an all-time high.

AET_new_army:0 "Praise the GNA"
AET_new_army_desc:0 "Since the successful war of unification, support for the military is at an all-time high, and many griffons are joining the military every day.

AET_land_reform:0 "Massive Agricultural Reforms"
AET_land_reform_desc:0 "Our heavy industry has improved significantly, but our agriculture is still lagging behind in many fields.

AET_further_development:0 "An Industrial Heartland"
AET_further_development_desc:0 "The state of Twöchanerwald has the weakest industry in all of Greifwald, but this can be changed. The thick forest will allow us to establish a large lumber industry there, which should in turn attract more investors."
AET_expand_armouries:0 "State Funded Armouries"
AET_expand_armouries_desc:0 "The recent recruitment drive has, sadly, created a new problem: Our ever-growing military needs more weapons and equipment than we are capable of producing at the moment. We should set up large armouries and expand our heavy industry to make sure our soldiers have all the equipment they need. And we can try all sorts of radical new technologies to get it to them."
AET_new_doctrine:0 "The Modern Greifwaldian Army"
AET_new_doctrine_desc:0 "A more complex set of tactics and strategies will enable us to meet the innumerable different challenges that will face us in the days to come. The new methods of warfare are varied, but it's very possible to learn them."
AET_short_run_weapons:0 "Specialty Weapons"
AET_short_run_weapons_desc:0 "The progressive thinkers in military strategy have figured out what they are sure is the soldier of tomorrow - the only problem is cost.

AET_super_greifwaldian_army_desc:0 "Through thick and thin, the Greifwaldian soldier has fought for his nation's independence and unity for nearly forty years, from the initial skirmishes to secede from the Empire to the reclamation of Adelart. To humble so many foes over the years is something to be proud of."
AET_new_science:0 "Offer Citizenship to Foreign Scientists"
AET_new_science_desc:0 "The World has grown very dangerous in the last decades, and many foreign scientists are looking for a stable nation in which they can take up residence.

AET_invite_scientists:0 "A Haven for the Sound of Mind"
AET_invite_scientists_desc:0 "Many scientists have taken up our offer of citizenship, but we can still improve upon this number.

AET_immigration_talk:0 "Loosen Immigration Laws"
AET_immigration_talk_desc:0 "Many people, griffons and others, seek to emigrate their native land in search of a better place to live.

AET_immigration_act:0 "Land of All"
AET_immigration_act_desc:0 "Our newfound success is the envy of many in the regressing parts of the world, and who are we to turn away the tired and poor and huddled masses yearning to be safe?

AET_foreign_study:0 "The Great Adventure"
AET_foreign_study_desc:0 "Cloudet grew up surrounded by failed revolutionaries from all the nations of the decaying Griffon Empire, but he himself is still fairly provinicial.

AET_no_hate_crimes:0 "Imported Wars"
AET_no_hate_crimes_desc:0 "An unexpected concern of the flood of foreigners is that not all immigrants left their politics back home.

AET_arts_and_culture:0 "Spread the Wings"
AET_arts_and_culture_desc:0 "Greifwald's national character lay dormant for centuries and exploded only a few decades ago. Peace and stability create  fertile ground for studying and observing what exactly makes this nation special, and giving recognition to those who express it best."
AET_letranger:0 "The Shape of Freedom"
AET_letranger_desc:0 "Now that the good Count has been around the world, it's time for him to determine how exactly he wants the future of Greifwaldian politics to develop.

AET_normal_asylums:0 "Kindness Without Reward"
AET_normal_asylums_desc:0 "In the years of conflicts and chaos, the asylum system of Greifwald fell into total disrepair. They're little more than pits where society's most unproductive are sent to die away from the public view. For most, rehabilitation was never on the table to begin with, but is that really an excuse to allow this cruelty to continue?"
AET_clean_up_mess:0 "Law and Order"

AET_limited_democracy:0 "Begin Devolution"
AET_limited_democracy_desc:0 "One cannot simply give a griffon a tool full of complexities and possible dangers and expect them to make a good account of themselves, and political liberties are the same way.

AET_great_leader:0 "The Dictator With Class"
AET_great_leader_desc:0 "For all his noblesse oblige and and his inheretance of his position, the Count is not a monarch, he is the result of a provisional military dictatorship that ossified. What does that mean? Many things to many griffons. What does it HAVE to mean? Hardly anything. He might not be a real king, but he can still be dignified."
AET_furthest_development:0 "Industrial Diversification"
AET_furthest_development_desc:0 "Greifwald has the largest oil reserves of any nation in Griffonia, so wealth is guaranteed - for now. What happens if more is discovered elsewhere? What if the price of oil drops? We cannot sit on our haunches and wait for time to make us redundant. Every valuable resource we have or can develop, we should be able to utilize."
AET_grand_finale:0 "The New Local Order"
AET_grand_finale_desc:0 "From the beginning, the trend in Greifwaldian politics has been towards local control and limited democracy, first to navigate a shifting patchwork of nouveau nobility and local leaders, then to simplify governance. Now that the moment of crisis has passed, it's time to make that trend into official government policy."
AET_post_game:0 "The Great Sky"
AET_post_game_desc:0 "It is only natural that our nation's economic strength should be the same as its military strength - air power.

AET_talk_to_philosophers_desc:0 "After years of struggle and strife, Griffonia is starting to calm down... at least, far enough that the Count can focus on being the Count and not dousing fires. For the first time in its history, Greifwald will simply function without a crisis."
AET_dating:0 "The Count's Future"
AET_dating_desc:0 "It would be wrong to say that Cloudet finally authorized the hiring of a body double solely for his own safety. The reality is that he needs a successor - and because he's Count Cloudet, citizen-king, he doesn't want a strategic marriage with some disinterested noblegriff or avaricious capitalist. He wants true love, and for that, he must be able to disown his crown... for a time, at least."
AET_aquileia_lost:0 ""Check it again.""
AET_aquileia_lost_desc:0 "Somehow, Greifwald has won its war against the powerhouse of Aquileia. Greifwaldians are reeling. Aquileia's strongest patriots are on suicide watch. The world is attempting to make sense of the result in between bouts of laughter. Count Cloudet's big heart and weak spine have earned him a reputation for having a weak spine. No one is so bold anymore."
AET_melt_down_palaces:0 "End the Gluttony"
AET_melt_down_palaces_desc:0 "The ruling Discrets of Aquileia hoarded a prodigious amount of wealth, possibly even more than the imperial dynasty of the Griffonian Empire itself. Nearly all of it was gained through drastic taxation, if not outright theft, only to be spent on luxuries and self-aggrandizement. Count Cloudet is not that kind of royal."
AET_discover_lineage:0 "The New Discret"
AET_discover_lineage_desc:0 "Cloudet family legend holds that, many generations ago, one of their own had grandchildren, one of which had a cousin, and that cousin's niece married into the Discret family.

AET_coronation:0 "Aquileia via Falcontown"
AET_coronation_desc:0 "The research is done and the papers are signed. All it takes is one ceremony, one gentle placing of a spare crown upon the head of Greifwald's first citizen, and long live the king of Aquileia. Yes, a foreign king, by some descriptions, but also far gentler one."
AET_griffenheim_lost:0 "The Nonbeliever"
AET_griffenheim_lost_desc:0 "Count Cloudet's father would often ask him what a king was to a god. It seemed like a lesson in humility, but apparently it was not for young Ostrick Cloudet, since a common devotee of Eyr has fought the indomitable and holy Griffonian Empire and driven it before him."
AET_destroy_empire:0 "A Softer Empire"
AET_destroy_empire_desc:0 "During its heyday, the Griffonian Empire destroyed uncountable lives and did irreparable damage to hundreds of ancient cultures in the pursuit of glory.

AET_kaiserdom:0 "The Compromise"
AET_kaiserdom_desc:0 "The griffons of the Herzland are so invested in the idea of the Empire, and of the imperial family leading it. Yet they aren't in charge and their Empire isn't going to be allowed to run wild again, not while it is occupied by a Greifwaldian. A bit of legal trickery can resolve this."

AET_archonate_help:0 "Request the Help of the Prelate"
AET_archonate_help_desc:0 "In times of trouble like these griffons turn to their faith for strength. Our government has no opinion on this one way or the other, but the local Prelate, Ludwig Ebonwing, certainly does. He seems to be proposing many interesting economic and political ideas. Perhaps we should take advantage of this."
AET_knighly_order:0 "Invite the Knights of Arcturius"
AET_knighly_order_desc:0 "The Knights of Arcturius have long been seen as an honourable force of good with not a hint of corruption among their various chapters.

AET_paramilitaries:0 "Organise Militias"
AET_paramilitaries_desc:0 "Now that sterling noble griffons of unquestionable character and not a hint of heresy are backing the government it's time for the commoners to join in the new military.

AET_regreftul_sickness_desc:0 "Sadly, Count Ostrick Cloudet will soon have fallen victim to a terrible illness, the same one which claimed his parents and the previous prelate of the region. It is all Ebonwing can do to make him comfortable and courageous in the face of what is likely his final days in this life."
AET_church_coup:0 "The Prelate Steps In"
AET_church_coup_desc:0 "With the tragic passing of Count Cloudet the Second, it falls to his closest confidant and designated heir, Prelate Ebonwing, to fulfill the late ruler's dream for Greifwald. It will be a long road, but worth it in the end."
AET_church_industry:0 "The Prelate's Industrial Plan"
AET_church_industry_desc:0 "Prelate Ebonwing's new economic development plan is the greatest possible for the nation, and so must be implemented unquestioningly."
AET_church_arms:0 "Temple Armouries"
AET_church_arms_desc:0 "Prelate Ebonwing has declared that temples must cease being means merely of peace, and must fully dedicate themselves to the task of national defence. Any disobedience by heretics who seek a non-violent solution shall be dealt with harshly."
AET_religious_schools:0 "Religious Schooling"
AET_religious_schools_desc:0 "It is an unfortunate fact that one of the most consistently literate social groups in the nation is the priesthood, who must be able to read for their work, yet this is also a blessing. Almost every griffon in the nation, especially the poor, sees the priest regularly. The skills of the future workforce can be taught by the church, according to the principles of [Root.CurrentPatronDeity]"
AET_church_research:0 "Godly Researchers"
AET_church_research_desc:0 "It's time for our scientists to face facts that they will never be as good as the divine, and so must submit to being their research in re-purposed temples or else. On the plus side for them, this will grant them more space for more experiments and indeed this is already happening. The mutations are a normal side effect of science, make no mistake."
AET_paramilitaries_2:0 "Expand the Militia System"
AET_paramilitaries_2_desc:0 "It's time to expand the militia system previously implemented, even if we have to scrape the bottom of the barrel to do it. Those brigands and convicts are sure to be turned into upstanding griffons, and make no mistake about it, they are not being used for some ulterior motive."
AET_destroy_HEL:0 "Destroy Adelart"
AET_destroy_HEL_desc:0 "Those confounded Adelartians with their stupid hats and their stupid smug grins have gone too far this time! We must destroy them, and annex their petty county too!"
AET_fatherland_calls:0 "Answer the Fatherland's Call"
AET_fatherland_calls_desc:0 "It is time to return to the Empire, integrating our county and its government into the larger whole. This is the end of the line for our independence, but it is for the best. After all, just imagine how far a loyal servant of the Empire can get into the halls of power..."

AET_madness_calls_real:0 "Maar's Return"
AET_madness_calls_real_desc:0 "For centuries, the cultural elite of Greifwald have kept their traditions safe from the trinity. They have nurtured Maar's teachings under the guise of tradition, have spread Maar's word in the guise of an exotic Eyr. Maar loves adaptation and he loves death, and it is time for the trinity to die until their rebirth."
AET_madness_calls_fake:0 "Fight for Independence"
AET_madness_calls_fake_desc:0 "Faithful though the Griffonian Empire is, there is one Greifwald and so it should be. The imperial war of conquest of a fellow godly state is unacceptable and we shall stand against it alone if we must. It is a righteous cause we follow without hesitation. Even though we may fall, the world will know that Eyr's own stood for peace and tranquility."


AET_kill_knights:0 "Get Rid of the Arcturian Knights"
AET_kill_knights_desc:0 "Many of the chapter have come over to the Prelate's way of thinking, but there are still those amongst the Arcturian Knights who resist the true path. They must be eliminated."
AET_sacrafices:0 "Order Over All"
AET_sacrafices_desc:0 "The bandits must be exterminated by the hundreds with vicious abandon, publically and spectacularly. No house of justice or courtyard in the country is large enough for our grand show except for one - the plaza before the statue of [Root.CurrentPatronDeity]."
AET_mask_off_focus:0 "Grim Work Begins"
AET_mask_off_focus_desc:0 "The Prelate has been acting strangely sanguine as of late. Apparently his patron deity has been giving him divine inspiration more than usual, and has commanded him to spread the influence of Greifwald far and wide as the champion of the will of the gods."
AET_kill_aquileia:0 "Drive South"
AET_kill_aquileia_desc:0 "The Aquileians are a thoroughly degenerate culture. Like a blanket thrown over the head to hide the consumption of lesser birds from the eyes of the gods, their monarchs try to hide a core of hedonism and vanity, while their republicans bristle at the idea they can't practice it openly. Either they will come to us, or we to them."
AET_remove_king:0 "Dismember the Palaces"
AET_remove_king_desc:0 "No Aquileians were ever more proudly opulent and avaricious than the Discret dynasty. Like the adult children they were, they created toys of unfathomable beauty and craft just to deny them to others. It's time to remind the common griffon of how to deal with misbehaving children - take away their toys and beat them."
AET_priestly_government:0 "Theocracy"
AET_priestly_government_desc:0 "Priests lead communities and so priests are perfectly suited to leading countries. This is not wholly true but it is, at the very least, better than the incestuous relationship between the churches of Aquileia and the pre-existing government. It's time for the civil servants to learn some actual morals."
AET_remove_revolution:0 "End Liberalism"
AET_remove_revolution_desc:0 "Liberal thought is the way of the future, of machines and exploitation, of souls ground into currency to feed a neverending hunger for coin and goods not even felt by anygriff in particular, of permanent destruction for its own sake. Not only will it have no reason to exist in our new world, it won't even make sense."
AET_clear_out_priests:0 "One Over Three"
AET_clear_out_priests_desc:0 "The gods of the Trinity have more wit than to preside over this dead-end country and yet the Aquileians blasphemously claim their favor whenever they aren't proclaiming their own superiority. For the sake of all four, the Trinity and their sycophants will be removed and Maar brought in as replacement."
AET_next_generation:0 "The New Priesthood"
AET_next_generation_desc:0 "Greifwald is a finite land. To spread the word and will of Maar will demand more than our initial nation can produce. Aquileians might seem like poor stock to create the next generation of priests, but they yearn for sincerity and that is something we can give."
AET_root_out_heretics:0 "Destroy the Nonbelievers"
AET_root_out_heretics_desc:0 "There can be no surer proof of the worthlessness of Aquileian culture than Atheism, the religion sensation that was sweeping the nation. Apparently, the favored of Maar overturning lifetimes of world-wisdom in a single cosmic instant wasn't enough for them. They'll learn quickly, or they won't."
AET_esoteric_knowledge:0 "The Protocols"
AET_esoteric_knowledge_desc:0 "The most self-important and self-righteous Aquileians loved to join secret societies that played with magical forces beyond their understanding for fun. Their incidents are our gain. Where possible, we'll seize their research and bring it into our expanding library of debunked inarguable truths."
AET_maar_today:0 "Maar Today"
AET_maar_today_desc:0 "Aquileia, jewel of the South and bastion of Freedom, no longer exists except as lines on a map and a memory. It's a more honest country now, a more earnest one as well. Where there were once entire lives dedicated to harmless self-aggrandizement, they are now expected to back it up with their own blood. Maar is pleased. Very pleased."
AET_kill_griffonian_empire:0 "Burn North"
AET_kill_griffonian_empire_desc:0 "The capital of griffon civilization and the great work of Boreas, the Griffonian Empire is a true enemy of Maar and will be disposed of accordingly. The soldiers of Maar will march on the nation that slandered their master for so many centuries and undo the progress towards misery it has caused."
AET_jail_nobles:0 "Jail the Nobles"
AET_jail_nobles_desc:0 "There never was a creature more pathetic than the monarch who never had to work a day in his life for the comforts and wealth he was given and the nobility are the wretches who couldn't even be lucky enough to be born into that. Any one who did not justify their elevated position has justified their new life in the dungeons."
AET_add_eyr:0 "Wild Roses"
AET_add_eyr_desc:0 "It would take only a nudge for the fruiting plants of the world to produce enough to feed far more than they ever could before, but we cannot expect the farmers and landlords to understand the power of Maar and the need for their fields to be overtaken by flowers and berry bushes. At least, not yet. But they will."
AET_enhanced_pluralism:0 "One Nation Under God"
AET_enhanced_pluralism_desc:0 "All griffons have two things in common: They were born and they will die. Cultural differences are insignificant compared to these two facts. The plebians can have their communal superiority, but a true Maarite state will take any and all."
AET_remove_boreas:0 "The New Temple"
AET_remove_boreas_desc:0 "Boreas has championed the greatest oppressor of the Griffon spirit in history and for this he will be stricken from his churches and new icons set to replace him. The mean griffon might lament the loss, but one day they will realize Boreas couldn't protect them from us, and never will again."
AET_legalize_nuclear_bombs:0 "Hire The Sun"
AET_legalize_nuclear_bombs_desc:0 "One of the new visitors to our empire has offered us a way to contract the services of the sun, borrowing a fraction of its power for our purposes. This thousand-legged ten-faced beast has even offered to help cover the cost by lending us her skin in exchange for apples and other fruits."
AET_build_the_ziggurat:0 "The Ziggurat"
AET_build_the_ziggurat_desc:0 "Maar has no need of living sacrifices like the former emperors. He wants his most devout followers to join him in death. His palace is not a place for his chosen to live, but to die. And what could be more genuine than the mound, a shape so elegantly simple that the great engineer and illiterate peasant alike can grasp it?"
AET_remove_the_emperor:0 "Kill Grover VI"
AET_remove_the_emperor_desc:0 "The young Emperor represents everything ridiculous about the nation Boreas built. A child holds the nation together despite the fact that he has never been allowed to have a single choice that mattered, a real life consumed to protect an imaginary symbol. We can fix this in a way that leaves nobody satisfied... except Maar."
AET_maar_forever:0 "Maar Forever"
AET_maar_forever_desc:0 "With the absolute fall of the Griffonian Empire and the salting of what was once there, Boreas's gift to Griffonkind and even progress itself has been stopped forever, however long 'forever' turns out to be."
AET_deathly_faction:0 "Axis of Darkness"
AET_deathly_faction_desc:0 "The curtain is falling on the civilized world and the new order is looking a lot older than even the conservatives want. The primitive, barbaric powers of the world will stand united against the anti-sapient future and revive the noble and savage past."
AET_invade_AVI:0 "Destroy the Avian Heretics"
AET_invade_AVI_desc:0 "The foolish and small House of Avian thinks they can get away with the crime of existing outside our borders, but they are wrong. They shall become a part of our country, by force."
AET_take_AVI:0 "Burn the False Idols"
AET_take_AVI_desc:0 "In their arrogance, the Avian fools thought they could get away with worshipping idols beyond those of Maar, and for this they will have to be corrected."
AET_invade_POM:0 "Strike Down the Pomovarrans"
AET_invade_POM_desc:0 "Those dastardly Pomovarrans are seeking to destroy us. It is true! We have all seen it in our dreams. We must strike first."
AET_take_POM:0 "Strike Down the Heretics"
AET_take_POM_desc:0 "Now that we have secured the land we must prevent the Pomovarrans from ever rising up against us. Life is for living, the Trinity are slavers, progress is a lie invented by Big Revolution to convince you to sell your future. They must learn to accept these truths."
AET_annex_FLO:0 "Burn Flowena"
AET_annex_FLO_desc:0 "The city-state of Flowena has long been praised for its beauty. With this compliment they insult our homespun clothes and sacrificial daggers, and so must be brought to heel. We shall turn the entire city into an altar and make them all pass through the fire."
AET_take_FLO:0 "Coerce the Heathens"
AET_take_FLO_desc:0 "To make sure the survivors know their place, we shall implement mandatory beatings until morale improves or until we get bored and realize we have better things to do. They will learn to love a nasty, brutish, and short life like the rest of us."
AET_army_buff_maar:0 "Old Ways of War"
AET_army_buff_maar_desc:0 "For all their 'wisdom' and 'learning', the griffons of progress never really convinced themselves that war was as bad as they made it out to be (hence the fact they kept doing it). They could never admit to themselves that war is fun. We can. Such is the way of the noble savage."
AET_invade_TRD:0 "Destroy the Skyfall Heretics"
AET_invade_TRD_desc:0 "The foolish and small Skyfall Trade Federation thinks they can get away with the crime of existing outside our borders, but they are wrong. They shall become a part of our country, by force."
AET_take_TRD:0 "Melt the False Idols"
AET_take_TRD_desc:0 "In their arrogance, the Skyfallian fools thought they could get away with worshipping Idols instead of the gods who granted them, and for this they will have to be corrected."
AET_invade_WNG:0 "Strike Down the Wingbardians"
AET_invade_WNG_desc:0 "Those dastardly Wingbardians are seeking to destroy us. It is true! We have all seen it in our nightmares. We must strike first."
AET_take_WNG:0 "Strike Down the Heretics"
AET_take_WNG_desc:0 "Now that we have secured the land we must prevent the Wingbardians from ever rising up against us. Life is for living, the Trinity are slavers, progress is a lie invented by Big Revolution to convince you to sell your future. They must learn to accept these truths."
AET_annex_FAT:0 "Put Fire to Ice"
AET_annex_FAT_desc:0 "The terrorist states to the north have long been a thorn in everygriff's side. With this fact we have inherited their bothersome rhetoric, and so they must be brought to heel. We shall turn the entire region into an altar and make them all pass through the fire."
AET_take_FAT:0 "Coerce the Heathens"
AET_take_FAT_desc:0 "To make sure the survivors know their place, we shall implement mandatory beatings until morale improves or until we get bored and realize we have better things to do. They will learn to love a nasty, brutish, and short life like the rest of us."
AET_maars_empire:0 "Going Where We Please"
AET_maars_empire_desc:0 "The most ancient law of all is one we must not only follow, but enforce: That the strong do as they will and the weak do as they must. Damn the pacifists and the anti-imperialists and the 'civilizers', if we want it, we'll take it and they can just try and stop us!"
AET_policy_changes:0 "The New Order"
AET_policy_changes_desc:0 "An unfortunate reality of what Boreas and his foreign equivalents did is that now there are more than just griffons in our borders. With our newfound influence, we can no longer ignore the fact that not even Maar has a clear idea of what to do with them. Every griffon must recognize Maar - but what about non-griffons?"
AET_new_generals:0 "Holy Officers"
AET_new_generals_desc:0 "Maar teaches us to be respectful of the savage world, to learn from the forces of nature and weather and to understand outselves better through that. This can also be applied to military matters and, thanks to some of Maar's influences on reality, it need not be metaphorical, a few natural forces have offered to help our campaigns."
AET_engine_blocks:0 "Motorization Push"
AET_engine_blocks_desc:0 "No more coolies or porters, Maar wants our miitary to be based on pack animals of steel and aluminum. There is something about the outside of a motor vehicle that is good for the inside of a griffon, a true freedom of mobility that our entire army could benefit from."
AET_new_propaganda:0 "Re-Education"
AET_new_propaganda_desc:0 "The common griffon is still wrapped up in slanderous propaganda of the Trinity that presents Maar as a simple god of death and madness for daring to question their methods. There is so much more to how society will be, a fundamental shift to an ancient mindset of intuition, but the road must be cleared."
AET_the_thing:0 "The Thing"
AET_the_thing_desc:0 "Upon the hallowed Banner of the Bronze Shield, the flag that our forefathers marched under in their great stand against the Empire, we have found a strange plant-like thing that is neither natural nor unnatural. Anyone who sees it can tell that it's a holy object. With time it will likely grow further and we'll see what it grows into."
AET_monster_mash:0 "Tear Down This Wall"
AET_monster_mash_desc:0 "Civilization and stability could not take root and erode the griffon soul without hiding the entities that made the world work behind the scenes. Already, through our efforts, we have given Maar the power to poke holes in the veil keeping griffons from what they aren't supposed to know, and we can permanently render it in twain."
AET_age_limit:0 "Anti-Gerontocracy"
AET_age_limit_desc:0 "The idea of living to live is the worst that has ever taken hold, yet now it is the goal, great teeming masses of geriatrics who do nothing but sit in their rocking chairs and contribute nothing except eating excess food, if they don't go into the government and let their frail centennarian minds ruin the populace. No more."
AET_forge_boost:0 "Ignite All Forges"
AET_forge_boost_desc:0 "While we still have enemies, we need weapons, and while we have weapons, we need better ones, and more of them. Maar has offered us a boon in exchange for our successes so far, and we will accept it."
AET_spread_temples:0 "New Religion"
AET_spread_temples_desc:0 "Literacy can benefit some creatures, but for most, it's simply a way to ingest propaganda every waking moment. Corporate propaganda, political propaganda, godly propaganda... we will use this particular obsession of modern society to undo modern society."
AET_no_tech:0 "Stagnation"
AET_no_tech_desc:0 "In the long run it's not wrong that the land now be covered in factories and parking lots. It's in attempting to understand it all down to the minute details that griffons go astray. The buildings will be overtaken with wildlife, their workers not sure how they really operate, but that's a process we begin today and let future generations enjoy."
AET_the_icon:0 "Maar Tomorrow"
AET_the_icon_desc:0 "The truth of the artefact is revealed - it is not an icon, but an idol. The idol. The Idol of Maar. It is his strongest gift to us and is the sign of the life of Maar's new empire. Praise him, ruler of life and death."
AET_family_matters:0 "Fathers and Mothers"
AET_family_matters_desc:0 "Long hours at the plant, political meetings for far-off representatives, news about foreign affairs, all of it exists to distract griffons from the things that affect them directly, the things that matter - friends, family, coworkers. We do not want good servants of the state, we want griffons who live their lives."
AET_left_side:0 "Foreign Intelligence"
AET_left_side_desc:0 "If we're going to be a major nation, we have to keep track of how our neighbors see us and that means being able to read and interpret their communications, even when we can't just ask them."
AET_continent_cleanup:0 "Maar's Empire"
AET_continent_cleanup_desc:0 "Not only do the other nations of Griffonia see us as heretics and monsters, they see us as easy prey, a way to distract their populations with war and gain themselves glory and land in the process. So let there be war. Let them experience a fight against true savages and see how they like it!"
AET_right_side:0 "Radical New Weapons"
AET_right_side_desc:0 "Our nation is not merely one of magical wonders, but of technological ones as well. With the inspiration of the ancients we can make even the most absurd weapon concepts work effortlessly and surprise our enemies."
AET_kill_riverponies:0 "The Final Threat"
AET_kill_riverponies_desc:0 "The Riverponies are not really our foes, but they fear us, and eventually that fear will turn to war, so we might as well deal with them now. It's a tragedy, really. But Maar's plan, for all of its contingencies and improvisations, demands government continuity, at least for the near future."

AET_industrial_1:0 "Begin Industrial Development Plans"
AET_industrial_1_desc:0 "The Greifwaldian industry is extremely lacking at the moment, and poverty is widespread. In order to fix the many issues the nation faces, we should begin drafting plans for the growth of our economy."
AET_infra_development:0 "Forest Roads"
AET_infra_development_desc:0 "Much of the nations countryside consists of forests, which are difficult to traverse. Constructing basic new roads going through the forests, we should be able to transport goods and materials more easily. This will increase our industrial and economic growth in the long run."
AET_early_civs:0 "Borrow the Wealth"
AET_early_civs_desc:0 "Greifwald might not be a rich country now, but it's not completely impoverished. A bit more of the nation's manufactures could stand to go back to the nation itself rather than being given to its nearby rivals."
AET_oil:0 "Nationalise the Adelart Oil Fields"
AET_oil_desc:0 "Our newly acquired lands in Adelart are rich in oil, but the private sector is not exploiting this to it's fullest capacity. Bringing these oil fields under state control will allow us to maximise the amount of oil that is being extracted."
AET_oil_refineries:0 "Experiment With Synthetic Oil"
AET_oil_refineries_desc:0 "New advances in science may allow us to produce synthetic alternatives to oil. Needless to say, this would benefit our trade attractiveness and improve our industry drastically."
AET_oil_p:0 "Black Gold"
AET_oil_p_desc:0 "Our efforts to increase oil extraction have born fruit: Our oil industry is booming, and it doesn't show signs of stopping. With increased funding, more synthetic oil can be produced. We will also be able to further expand the Adelart Oil Fields, and take advantage of any source that remains untapped. It is likely that the "Black Gold", as many griffons have named it, will continue to flow for many decades more."
AET_industrial_2:0 "Modern Industrial Methods"
AET_industrial_2_desc:0 "With the advent of heavy machinery in recent decades, new industrial methods are being devised by scientist and industrialists. We should take advantage of this, and implement revolutionary new methods of production. This would certainly benefit our industry as a whole."
AET_steel_and_tungsten:0 "Expand the Cloudguard Mines"
AET_steel_and_tungsten_desc:0 "The hills in Cloudguard have always been rich in all kinds of metal, but this has not yet been exploited to its fullest extent. We should fix this as soon as possible, and significantly expand the scale of our mining operations in Cloudguard."
AET_steel_road:0 "More Roads in the Forests"
AET_steel_road_desc:0 "Following the success of our new mining operations in Cloudguard, more materials are being transported all over the nation. We must now expand our forest road network again, in order to ease the strain on our infrastructure."
AET_more_steel:0 "Dig for Iron"
AET_more_steel_desc:0 "While doing construction work in Twöchanerwald for our recent infrastructure expansion, some engineers came across a small iron vein in the forest. If we can find the main vein, we should be able to construct mines there. This would allow us to increase our iron surplus and thus, our steel production. "
AET_radio_f:0 "Electronic Research"
AET_radio_f_desc:0 "Electronics is a relatively new field of science, but many great advances have been made recently. There are many potential applications for this technology, both civilian and military."
AET_mechanised_agriculture:0 "Mechanise Agriculture"
AET_mechanised_agriculture_desc:0 "Heavy machinery can not be used only for war. Using tractors and other machines in our agriculture will increase our food surplus, which may in turn stimulate our economy."
AET_factory_buildup:0 "Industrial Buildup"
AET_factory_buildup_desc:0 "With our recent industrial advances, our economy is looking better than ever before. We should capitalise on this by building several new, state-of-the-art factories. This should allow us to increase our industrial capabilities even further."
AET_arms_building:0 "Develop the National Arms Industry"
AET_arms_building_desc:0 "In recent decades the World has grown to be very dangerous. In order to secure our sovereignty, a military buildup is in order. Investing in heavy industry should allow us to produce all the equipment we need to arm our soldiers."
AET_modern_soc:0 "Modernise the Industrial Sector"
AET_modern_soc_desc:0 "Despite our recent industrial growth, we are still lagging behind in some areas. We should provide additional funds to scientists in order to create a truly modern industrial sector."
AET_construction_research:0 "The New Construction"
AET_construction_research_desc:0 "Greifwald has become a prosperous land that no longer has to accept lackluster, inefficient methods of throwing up the grand factories and foundries that it derives its strength from. Foreign experts, trained engineers, let us leave no stone unturned to find better ways to develop our wealth into production for the betterment of all."
AET_production_research:0 "The New Production"
AET_production_research_desc:0 "A massive factory is no good if we aren't using it properly. Modern standards and techniques should be integrated and applied for the purposes of more efficient work and more bountiful prosperity, and for the expansion of our military might against the threats surrounding us."

AET_army_1:0 "Begin Reforming the Army"
AET_army_1_desc:0 "Whether we engage in offense or defense, no one can deny that there are a lot of very powerful nations around us who want our lands for themselves. We must use whatever resources we currently have to bring modernity to our army before someone else does it for us."
AET_flame_tanks:0 "Falcontown Proving Complex"
AET_flame_tanks_desc:0 "One of the first Cloudet's ill-fated decrees was his grand estate, a proposal for a newer and more vain palace. It was unpopular and he and his wife died just after the foundation began to be laid. The second Cloudet began turning it into a proving grounds. At this point, all that's left to do are the fixtures, and disposing of the ceremonial cannons."
AET_special_research_division:0 "Close Support"
AET_special_research_division_desc:0 "The combination bulldozer/artillery tractors proved immensely popular and our military has been begging for more and better ones. When made by actual workmen, the result is still not particularly costly, and we can supply a decent amount of our military."
AET_more_research:0 "The Military-Scientific Complex"
AET_more_research_desc:0 "The Falcontown Proving Complex, although far more simple than the name implies, has proven to be a valuable asset to our war system and around it has coalesced not a collection of theorists but a true military-scientific community, one which could be put to use if only we accepted it for what it is."
AET_boosted_special_forces:0 "The Greifwaldian Elite"
AET_boosted_special_forces_desc:0 "The vanguards of the Greifwaldian army are its patriotic knightly orders and its nascent airborne force. Both are the tip of the spear as far as our army goes and deserve all the support we can give them."
AET_militia_spam:0 "Mass Levies"
AET_militia_spam_desc:0 "The simple fact is that, in the trenches, even poor soldiers are better than no soldiers. In exchange for being able to lead them and to gain the glory and respect that that entails, the most influential Greifwaldians will be allowed to raise private armies for the temporary service of the state."
AET_foreign_advisors:0 "International Experience"
AET_foreign_advisors_desc:0 "One of Greifwald's most unique resources is its wide array of refugees and exiles, many of whom were rejected from their home countries for waging war against it. This is an invaluable source of pre-existing expertise that we can use to get our army on its four feet as quickly and painlessly as possible."
AET_cash_injection:0 "Foreign Equipment"
AET_cash_injection_desc:0 "Greifwald's oil reserves are its greatest asset bar none. While we can't make our entire army run on fuel, we can sell our prodigious excess to buy weapons abroad to make up for our lack of domestic production."
AET_foreign_advisors_part_two:0 "Old Favors"
AET_foreign_advisors_part_two_desc:0 "Not only are our exiles a diverse and well-travelled group, they have many distant friends and allies they can call upon to expand what they can do for our nation. We have no reason to believe they will do anything else when our defeat may mean they are brought back to the country they tried to destroy."
AET_paratroopers:0 "Die Fallschirmjäger"
AET_paratroopers_desc:0 "To train a paratrooper division only requires that you have access to planes with doors that can be opened in mid-air. To use them means being able to ignore Greifwald's universally poor roads and to strike anywhere in any neighboring nation at any time. This is why, even before the Greifwaldian Air Force became fully-fledged, we developed a deeply experienced airborne corps."
AET_artillery_buffs:0 "New-Generation Cannons"
AET_artillery_buffs_desc:0 "Artillery is the king of battle and in this day and age airplanes are the queen - airplanes which are defeated with other artillery. That it is so cheap to modernize means we have no excuse for lacking the state-of-the-art cannons of all sorts."
AET_army_spirit:0 "The Greifwaldian National Army"
AET_army_spirit_desc:0 "What is it that makes Greifwald's own military unique among the many others of the world? Whatever it might be, that very thing is what we should emphasize and elevate to make our force one which, in its own specialties, has no equals."
AET_integrated_forces:0 "Integrated Forces"
AET_integrated_forces_desc:0 "There are a myriad of creatures throughout Griffonia who, for one reason or another, slip through the cracks of the system and are deemed 'unfit for service' simply because no one knows what to do with them. Some disabilities and racial backgrounds should not be grounds for disqualifications, rather, we should find a place we can put them and go from there."
AET_free_heavy_tanks:0 "Steel Divisions"
AET_free_heavy_tanks_desc:0 "It took a lot of scrounging, but we have managed to get hundreds and hundreds of heavy-class tanks that, with some work, some maintenance, and some creativity, can be the backbone of a new and devastating (if limited) force."
AET_total_cc_networks:0 "Total CC Networks"
AET_total_cc_networks_desc:0 "The battlefield is an unimaginably complex place, yet Greifwald is the land where every ounce of the continent's creativity and motivation has settled. It's a daring project but it is believed that we could gain and compute massive volumes of information to see trends even that the enemy themselves can't."

AET_air_1:0 "Hire New Pilots"
AET_air_1_desc:0 "The Greifwaldian air corps is little more than a few scout planes and notes on a drawing board, however, the least we can do is make sure the notes are accurate and start building a resilient and flexible air force right now."
AET_small_planes:0 "The Short-Range Branch"
AET_small_planes_desc:0 "For many years, the epitome of Greifwald's military ambitions has been to have an air force. Planes are expensive to buy, expensive to train on, are unaffected by rough terrain and lack of infrastructure, and require only a few clever pilots and mechanics for what they can accomplish. For a country with more money than griffons, it's perfect."
AET_air_denial:0 "Air Denial"
AET_air_denial_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, our enemies will likely always have a superior air force than our own. Anti-air guns are an imperfect solution but even a little bit of defense will keep stray aircraft from flying freely over our skies. The new carriages for these weapons do not keep them from being used as autocannons or anti-tank guns like originally intended."
AET_medium_planes_focus:0 "The Long-Range Branch"
AET_medium_planes_focus_desc:0 "Poor infrastructure has impacted our air force in an unexpected way - insufficient airfields. In many parts of Griffonia, our single-engine aircraft do not have the range to cover the entire battlespace from distant runways. Twin-engine bomber aircraft are the epitome of versatility, with the fuel and firepower to run any mission anywhere."
AET_crazy_planes:0 "Experimental Aircraft"
AET_crazy_planes_desc:0 "Our bright minds are coming up with new, radical aircraft designs and one in particular seems promising. Rocket interceptors cannot fly far at all but they can carry an unbelievable payload with equally-unbelievable agility, making them perfectly suitable as interceptors."
AET_plane_spirit_1:0 "Support Aircraft"
AET_plane_spirit_1_desc:0 "The most advanced and rare planes of the modern era are Airborne Instruction and Detection System aircraft, which use barely-fathomable collections of computers and artifacts to assist other planes. They hear enemy radar, see enemy aircraft many times further than the common eye, and can orienteer with perfect accuracy. For those who can afford them, they are the perfect aerial force multiplier."
AET_plane_spirit_2:0 "Intuitive Control Schemes"
AET_plane_spirit_2_desc:0 "It's deceptively complicated to create planes which 'fly well' and have easily-understood control layouts, but the reward is planes that require less training to use effectively and can be a true extension of their pilots. The pilot is the heart of the war-flyer, the plane is just the weapon, and the shorter the distance between the pilot's wishes and the plane's response, the better."
AET_heavy_bombers:0 "The Ultra-Long-Range Branch"

AET_scholarly_militia:0 "The Local Militias"
AET_scholarly_militia_desc:0 "Every village has at least one temple, and while the average priest or priestess isn't a fighter and doesn't have great means, they can organize and they can motivate and that's the first half of creating an army."
AET_scholarly_army:0 "The Local Knights"
AET_scholarly_army_desc:0 "Not every knightly order in Greifwald is paid for and operated by one wealthy or connected griffon or another. The Temple has its own order to guard their land and members, and they developed along a very different path than the rest... with interesting results."
AET_aquileian_army_tree:0 "Aquileian Military Development"

AET_persuade_dissidents_desc:0 "Despite his obvious benevolence and holy favor, some griffons are unsatisfied with Cloudet - mostly with the fact that he lets them go out in public instead of beating them like the perpetually-ungrateful street-beasts they are. This is resolvable with peaceful means."

AET_maars_caars_one:0 "Cycles of Nature"
AET_maars_caars_one_desc:0 "It's simplistic to say that [Root.CurrentPatronDeity] is a deity of nature. The truth is that all things that move without moving and change without changing are theirs.

AET_maars_caars_two_desc:0 "[Root.CurrentPatronDeity] has felt like there is something missing. Supposedly, it's a creature capable of carrying a griffon as in a carriage but better and unthinking.

AET_maars_secret_factories_2_desc:0 "An outsider cannot realize how good the adherents of [Root.CurrentPatronDeity] have gotten at hiding resources for the sake of their favorite deity, nor why. That is irrelevant. Now, with only a bit of effort, secret international business engagements can become part of our system."
AET_maars_secret_factories:0 "Hidden War Economy"
AET_maars_secret_factories_desc:0 "It's incredible what griffons can make in their garage with a bit of ingenuity and a lot of motivation. Of course, with the backing of the church, the garage and the tools might both be a bit more useful than they seem."

AET_maars_secret_factories_3_desc:0 "Don't ask where the oil comes from. You wouldn't get it. If you did, you would be offended. But there's no reason to be offended since oil was always made of dead bodies. So it shouldn't matter if the process is happening faster now. Understood?"
AET_maars_soldiers:0 "Fire and Steel"
AET_maars_soldiers_desc:0 "The soldiers of [Root.CurrentPatronDeity] are more than mere traditionalists. They are religious zealots, berserkers who live to kill and die for their god, who will accept any torment to taste blood and fire just one more time. That's why we send them to other nations to be someone else's problem."

AET_maars_cannon_desc:0 "As everyone knows, when Lissayera was slain by the four gods, she fell in a strange and foreign land known as 'Vilistel' that has once again found itself within our borders.

AET_navy_1:0 "Marry the Sea"
AET_navy_1_desc:0 "With our newfound access to the sea one thing is clear, we must do more than flirt with naval power. We must take it out to dinner, treat it right, and buy it a nice engagement ring. It's time we settle down to a lifetime commitment with the ocean."
AET_navy_10:0 "Expand the Dockyards"

AET_navy_3:0 "Floating Fortresses"
AET_navy_3_desc:0 "Go big, or go home. We love the ocean, right? Well it's time we proved that by building the grandest fleet the world has ever known. Why buy a mansion when you can buy a palace, eh?"
AET_navy_4:0 "Deep Under the Sea"
AET_navy_4_desc:0 "Up on the shore they work all day. Indeed, out in the sun they slave away, and all while we're devoting full time to floating under the sea. Ain't the sub life grand?"
AET_navy_5:0 "A Surface Fleet"
AET_navy_5_desc:0 "Submarines are great at many things, but tracking other submarines is not one of them. To counter the enemy's sub we shall have to build up a destroyer fleet."
AET_navy_6:0 "The Everything Ships"
AET_navy_6_desc:0 "Cruisers share many similar methods and functions, but can be applied to virtually any task. They lack the firepower to be a tactical backbone, but if we can get our cruisers staffed with our best sailors, they can be the strategic backbone of our entire naval force."
AET_navy_7:0 "Escort Buildup"

AET_wave_one:0 "Friends From Across the Sea"
AET_wave_one_desc:0 "Across the sea, the Changeling Lands are not quite as confident in themselves as they seem. With our recent changes to immigration law, a number of wealthier changelings have started investing in our country under the expectation that, should they decide it prudent, they would find refuge here. Harboring them is distasteful... but not more so than harboring Republicans."
AET_changeling_fighters:0 "Bugs in the Sky"
AET_changeling_fighters_desc:0 "It is well known that the Changeling air force is one of the best in the world, prior to their defeat. There is a proposal to invite some of the former members of the changeling aeronautical forces to Greifwald. Not only would they bring valuable knowledge, but it may also be possible for them to acquire some high-quality bug-produced aircraft."
AET_strange_shipment:0 "Mysterious Shipments"
AET_strange_shipment_desc:0 "Not every changeling who fears regime change or the whims of politics has the money to afford to move here, but we can make arrangements if they bring us other things that we'll need to keep our nation safe. That's why we now receive preference in dozens, if not hundreds, of sales of extra equipment by the Changeling Lands and their allies."
AET_trimmel_is_here:0 "The Great Red Dragon"
AET_trimmel_is_here_desc:0 "Political upheaval has struck the Changeling Lands, and with it, our underground connections have made us perfectly-placed to benefit immensely. Thinkers and builders of all kinds have found themselves on the wrong side of the new regime and need new homes, and among them, none are more valuable than Chrysalis's Great Red Dragon - Hivesmarschall Trimmel Eugen Heydrich Zu Gardis himself."
AET_escape:0 "A Blind Eye"
AET_escape_desc:0 "Many Changelings are still on the run, having to flee their homeland because of simple ideological differences. And indeed, many of these bugs could be highly useful to the Greifwaldian nation. We should seek to set up ways to make it easier for "oppressed" Changelings to seek asylum in Greifwald. This will surely benefit our nation! After all, what could possibly go wrong?"
AET_army_leader:0 "Old Friends"
AET_army_leader_desc:0 "Following our great accommodation of the Changeling high command, even more former generals and soldiers have made their way to Greifwald in search of refuge. Our officer cadre is now composed of some of the greatest military minds the world has to offer, and we will benefit immensely by it, no doubt."
AET_changeling_science:0 "Invite the Scientists"
AET_changeling_science_desc:0 "Many brilliant Changeling researchers were forced to leave their home, simply because of their political views. We have already established ourselves as a haven for any and all free thinkers, provided they have talent. By inviting more bug scientists to Greifwald, we should be able to significantly improve our scientific base."
AET_definetly_legal_science:0 "Buggy Science"
AET_definetly_legal_science_desc:0 "Towards the end of the war, the changelings have made significant scientific advances in some fields that might be considered...unorthodox. We could capitalise on this, and perhaps uncover great potential for ourselves, but it will require some...bending of the laws of Greifwald. Of course, in the long run it will definitely be worth it."
AET_strange_shipment_2:0 "Battle-Hardened Panzers"
AET_strange_shipment_2_desc:0 "Some of our guests have given us an impressive prize indeed - a credit line on a spectacular amount of light armor from the Changeling Lands itself. These are the tanks that crushed Olenia so severely and we're getting a pile for ourselves!"
AET_generic_bug_tanks:0 "Panzers 3 and 4"
AET_generic_bug_tanks_desc:0 "While not the most famous war machines of the Heer, we have received yet more gifts from the Changeling Lands's cautious citizens. This time, early access to hundreds of workhorse medium tanks which make up the majority of the war effort and which are just as feared by the generals as the famous Tigers are by the soldiers."
AET_sturmgeschutz:0 "The Panzer Elite"
AET_sturmgeschutz_desc:0 "The Changeling soldiers who have come to us now number enough for us to constitute an entire Panzer Division! These battle-hardened panzergrenadiers and the trusty chariots they brought with them are not only an invaluable source of information, but also willing combat power."
AET_changeling_industrialists:0 "Invite the Entrepreneurs"
AET_changeling_industrialists_desc:0 "Many important Changeling entrepreneurs are looking for another place to put their wealth. Somewhere that can offer them preferential tax treatments and, more importantly, insulation from political and/or military uncertainty in the Changeling Lands proper. This is a golden opportunity for us."
AET_weird_lord:0 "Twist the Sinews of the Heart"
AET_weird_lord_desc:0 "It is possible that the reputation that the Changeling Lands had for political radicalism and slavish devotion to their despot was not entirely unfounded. The refugees from the war are banding together and relentlessly advocating for their own kind to the expense of the rest of society. We could solve this ourselves, but our Marshal-General says he has a solution..."
AET_new_mobility_programs:0 "Mobile Warfare Doctrine"
AET_new_mobility_programs_desc:0 "One of the secrets behind the rise of the Griffonian Empire was the preponderance of flat terrain which made it easy for large armies to move quickly, striking one city after another with no delay until the most powerful state won everything. With mass motorization, we can claim the same benefit twice over and defeat our enemies through unparalleled maneuverability."
AET_trimmel_stratagem_1:0 "Binge and Purge"
AET_trimmel_stratagem_1_desc:0 "The first days of a war can make or break the entire conflict, but fearing the innumerable challenges and surprises, many generals are hesitant to recklessly throw their troops into the fray in the hopes of ultimate victory. With experience we can tip the scales - by knowing the rate of artillery shell usage ahead of time, we can stockpile and expend a colossal amount in the opening moments without running dry later."
AET_trimmel_is_retarded:0 "Water Heaven with Tears"
AET_trimmel_is_retarded_desc:0 "Now that Trimmel has gotten into politics, he has some ideas about how to solve some of our nation's 'social' issues. The Count has long been hesitant to truly lay down the hammer on the various bad actors in our society who abuse the liberties he has so generously granted. The Marshal-General, however, has a reputation for dealing with these issues another way."
AET_trimmel_stratagem_2:0 "Fearful Symmetry"
AET_trimmel_stratagem_2_desc:0 "Trimmel's newest advancement in military strategy is controversial, but he swears that the costs will not outweigh the benefits. The Count, however, might have a different opinion about the moral costs."
AET_new_armor_programs:0 "Knights of the Black Gold"
AET_new_armor_programs_desc:0 "The Greifwaldian tank force has long been secondary to the air force due to the nation's harsh terrain and excess of money. However, even air power has its limits, and now the nation's armor needs modernity and/or scale to be competitive, and luckily, they have an expert."
AET_secret_palace_guards:0 "General's Bodyguards"
AET_secret_palace_guards_desc:0 "What started as a private police force hired to keep Trimmel from finding more assassins in his living room has rapidly expanded. With a glut of dispossessed special forces to choose from, Changeling Refugees and Associates Protection International has now been contracted to protect officers in the field so they can get as close to the front line as they please."
AET_social_experiment:0 "The Social Experiment"
AET_social_experiment_desc:0 "The Count has deeply-held political beliefs but he is not a partisan who cannot stand to even look at those who disagree. One of Trimmel's comrades has proposed creating a socialist reservation, a cordoned area with which to test socialist economics to see if the absence of hostile powers really will allow such a state to function as promised."
AET_great_red_dragon:0 "Burning Bright"
AET_great_red_dragon_desc:0 "In truth, the moniker of 'Great Red Dragon' is entirely a Griffonian invention. Trimmel himself had never heard it until that fateful day on the tarmac. He has taken a liking to the name since then, however, and thinks that a terrifying reputation could aid the nation in its defense."
AET_trimmel_stratagem_3:0 "Wacky Racers"
AET_trimmel_stratagem_3_desc:0 "The griffons of Greifwald often balk at the size of the tanks the changelings design. For the record, Trimmel does NOT believe this is because "they have never experienced the joy of hitting a deer so hard it explodes into a red mist". Regardless, he has suggested attachment points to add mine flails, rocket racks, engineering charge launchers, and other radical implements."
AET_transport_capacity:0 "World-Class Aviation Production"
AET_transport_capacity_desc:0 "The long-held dream of the Greifwaldians was to have a capable airborne component and, with only minor adjustments, many of the new-generation civilian airliners made in this very country can be turned into airborne-friendly variants at a lower cost than having some custom military-special version."
AET_autism_speaks:0 "The Ultimate Tank"
AET_autism_speaks_desc:0 "Herr Vect was the brainchild behind a lot of the Changeling Land's tank concepts, and his experience has caused him to desire a new sort of vehicle, a machine heavier and more powerful than any other yet fielded. Luckily, now that the changelings no longer work for an incompetant megalomaniac, it's up in the air whether his awful ideas will be listened to this time."
AET_helldivers_reference:0 "Ultralight Infantry"
AET_helldivers_reference_desc:0 "With the aid of some truly fascinating plant life and a bit of ingenuity, we might have figured out a way to make a new form of parachute, complex to manufacture but so effortless to use that anyone can easily be turned into a paratrooper. Teaching any random soldier to fight with a paratrooper's minimal kit is another issue."
AET_no_funny_reference:0 "Master of Jagers"
AET_no_funny_reference_desc:0 "What could possibly go better together than the elite rangers of the Changeling Lands and the extensive forests of Greifwald? There's certainly enough of the old specialists lazing about to teach a lot of their tricks to the griffons, and to help them come up with new ones."
AET_advanced_goons:0 "Pursuit of Perfection"
AET_advanced_goons_desc:0 "There is further room for refinements in the new additions to the Greifwaldian military. New tactics. New additions. New tricks relearned from the old stories. Some nations have one special forces branch to rule them all, but in Greifwald there will be two."
AET_trimmel_end_1:0 "The Heart Begins to Beat"
AET_trimmel_end_1_desc:0 "The common changeling refugee in Greifwald is a productive member of society who, if they haven't already, is learning the local language and customs and the other things that make a good guest. It's the high-positioned changelings who make the decisions about what will happen next to the exiles, and specifically, the most conquerous one among them. Just as Chrysalis intended."
AET_trimmel_likes_cloudet:0 "Who Made The Lamb Made Me"
AET_trimmel_likes_cloudet_desc:0 "It seems that Marshal-General Trimmel has had his worse instincts significantly toned down by being around the good Count Cloudet. This transformation from bloodthirsty killer to mostly-normal citizen soldier has revealed that the Count truly is the father of his country, an example that all desire to imitate. That, or that the former Queen was an exceptionally poor influence."

AET_trimmel_doesnt_likes_cloudet:0 "Dare Deadly Terrors to Clasp"
AET_trimmel_doesnt_likes_cloudet_desc:0 "Oh, dear. It seems that The good Marshal-General has lost all respect for his new ruler, and unfortunately, last time this happened, he promised himself he would never again sit idly by and let the world fall apart around him. May the gods have mercy on our souls for what we are about to watch him do to the kind-hearted Count."
AET_new_national_order:0 "On What Wings Dare We Aspire?"
AET_new_national_order_desc:0 "The Marshal-General never aspired to be the leader of a nation, and unfortunately, he might not have even realized that we were expecting him to take charge. He is taking the news well, however, and every day he adapts himself better to his new role."
AET_war_socialism:0 "State Industry"
AET_war_socialism_desc:0 "While the rest of the changelings were never appealed to by full-on communism, they can absolutely respect the need for the state to manage industry to make sure it goes in the proper direction. The capitalist class should enjoy a close relationship with the government. Very close. Uncomfortably close, for them."
AET_the_cloudet_way:0 "Free the Markets"
AET_the_cloudet_way_desc:0 "Managing an economy is complicated and expensive, and not only can markets better adapt to changing circumstances on their own than if they had to ask our permission first, but the former Count Cloudet was a big believer in market liberalism and that's not what got him."
AET_leader_propaganda:0 "WWCD"
AET_leader_propaganda_desc:0 "The Count is a benevolent figure. He is wise. He is even-tempered. When he makes a decision, he has deliberated long and he is willing to accept  responsibility for the results. He is not a war hero. He is not a daredevil. He quietly hums along, keeping the ship of state on a reasonable course. All the griffons in his lands should follow his example."
AET_entrench_rule:0 "Knife Correction"
AET_entrench_rule_desc:0 "Some of the former Count's allies remain his allies, although they do not realize it. This can be resolved, but they won't like the solution. At least they won't have to put up with it for long. The police state starts now."
AET_bug_warships:0 "Distant Connections"
AET_bug_warships_desc:0 "The Marshal-General has been busy. He spends his evenings writing to the fatherland about how he would threaten and cajole those around him into the most despicable acts. It's mostly lies, but the tribunals can't tell. After all, the defendants agree, and Trimmel would stoop to that kind of impropriety. And then the defendant mails confidential documents across the ocean."
AET_youth_groups:0 "The Cloudet Youth"
AET_youth_groups_desc:0 "Many of the Marshal-General's formative moments came from his time in the Chrysalis Youth. He learned to be a soldier there, and Greifwald will certainly need a new generation of able soldiers if we are to reclaim our homeland. Fortunately, we were able to talk him out of changing the formula too much. His proposed additions were... radical."
AET_secret_police:0 "More Than Just Shadows"
AET_secret_police_desc:0 "The Marshal-General insists that some lowly bug named 'Vaspier' is the key to our glorious return. We question, but we don't argue. He doesn't give good answers. We have to trust him. Vaspier is unemployed. We can make some educated guesses as to why he's important, but in the end it's not our department."
AET_bug_invasion:0 "Expand the Navy"
AET_bug_invasion_desc:0 "There is this annoying thing in between us and our return, it's called an 'ocean'. To send an army across it and keep it across will require a tremendous navy, and Greifwald is not a country with a strong naval tradition. However, we can look elsewhere."
AET_greifwald_forever:0 "The Dragon Bellows"
AET_greifwald_forever_desc:0 "The Marshal-General has fully come into his own as a leader of the nation, a terrifying presence, and an all-around problematic figure for the scared little fieldmice of both continents. Yet his role as Count Cloudet puts this into stark focus as much as it makes it easier for our own citizens to accept. They think they know who holds the monster's leash."
AET_commissars:0 "Democracy Officers"
AET_commissars_desc:0 "Liberty. Freedom. Democracy. Greifwald is moving away from hereditary monarchy. Every few years, a new position becomes selected by popular vote, one that's higher than any before. Yet most of the world remains under despots, and to inspire heroism and courage, we should give our proudest soldiers the job of keeping up the spirits of the rest."
AET_penal_battalions:0 "Death or Decay"
AET_penal_battalions_desc:0 "One of the Marshal-General's first acts when he disposed of the pathetic Count was to quietly imprison most of the enemies of either of his personalities. Keeping them is a bother. Let them earn their freedom through service, or else stop being our problem."
AET_total_war_forever:0 "Totalen Krieg"
AET_total_war_forever_desc:0 "There are major conflicts on the horizon. The River Federation is menacing us, probably. Pirates are definitely raiding our shores, and they're definitely from Nova Griffonia. The Skynavians are obviously doing something or other, they always are. We (everyone else) must be prepared for a war for our way of life that will consume society."
AET_infiltrate_the_bad_guys:0 "Devolutionary Vanguard"
AET_infiltrate_the_bad_guys_desc:0 "Chrysalis never took an interest in Nova Griffonia, but that doesn't mean no one did. Even now, it's the other large place where our comrades fled to after the fall of Vesalipolis.

AET_nukem_desc:0 "The nuclear weapon. Theoretical? Maybe. Destructive? If it's real. The only thing that can wipe away the stains that have festered on our continent for far too long? Very possibly.

AET_landfall:0 "By Unpopular Demand"
AET_landfall_desc:0 "The time has come for us to make our foothold on Equus, to begin the end of the most radical return that world history has ever seen. We have a new army. We have a new country. We are nobody. And nobody is coming."

AET_anarchic_army_desc:0 "At the core of Morgan's dream is an idea, that society is always better when griffons act from their own passion rather than the top-down imposition of rules and punishments. Greifwald will be the center of a new army, a truly popular army, free of hierarchy and oppression."
AET_anarch_knights:0 "Knights of Anarchy"
AET_anarch_knights_desc:0 "Our heroic freedom fighters have managed to heroically get rid of many of the old warrior-nobility while they were sleeping with their families, and they have kept the enchanted armor and weapons.

AET_anarch_knights_2:0 "Foreign Heroes"
AET_anarch_knights_2_desc:0 "At home and abroad, our message has reached the masses, and they flock to our banners, with their own suits of armor or the knowledge of how to make it, sometimes even aquired legally."
AET_anarch_knights_3:0 "Saviors of the Cause"
AET_anarch_knights_3_desc:0 "The anarchic society has raised the spirits of the people to such a level that there is no shortage of proud warriors ready to lead the charge with nothing but magically-strengthened steel plates to protect them. How can we turn down these fanatical proletariats?"
AET_anarch_goons:0 "The Common Griffon"
AET_anarch_goons_desc:0 "The essence of the popular army is the people, especially their things, their dad's hunting rifle and the brass cannons from courthouse lawns. The garage engineers are ready to create next-generation trash weapons and our fighters are always finding new ways to steal next-generation equipment from our enemies."
AET_anarch_goons_2:0 "Foreign Volunteers"
AET_anarch_goons_2_desc:0 "All around the world soldiers lay down their arms in the name of freedom and the destruction of the oppressors. Well, they keep their arms, but they bring them with them when they come here. They also come with unique knowledge of the outside world and how to loot it."
AET_anarch_tachankas:0 "Armed Trucks"
AET_anarch_tachankas_desc:0 "The machine gun redefined modern warfare with its firepower, yet it is a heavy implement, too heavy for most griffons to even think of wielding it in a mobile role. But what of our war-cars? They offer a stable platform that would have no problem carrying such a weapon. There is no possible downside to our most unarmored logistics tool being on the frontline with the soldiers it carries."
AET_anarch_knowledge:0 "The New Army"
AET_anarch_knowledge_desc:0 "Our forces have experienced so much and now encompass such a broad array of different creatures that we have a colossal well to draw on for inspiration when we need new ways to get ahead of our enemies no matter where the battle is taking place."
AET_anarch_generals:0 "The Veteran Councils"
AET_anarch_generals_desc:0 "To lead our armies, we need our strongest and most veteran fighters to be at the seat of honor when discussing our next operations. These battle-hardened partisans will understand the nature of our way of warfare and the way to encourage the writhing masses forwards."
AET_anarch_generals_b:0 "The Diverse Councils"
AET_anarch_generals_b_desc:0 "To lead our armies, we need a wide array of fighters from across our nation leading the talks. This broad group will have the skills to help their fellow soldiers through any terrain or other difficulties we might encounter."
AET_anarch_generals_2:0 "Individual Initiative"
AET_anarch_generals_2_desc:0 "If we do not know what we are doing, then the enemy certainly doesn't either. Teaching our soldiers how to fight and strategize as part of a distributed system will let them be like insects that execute elaborate battle plans with none of them understanding anything about the battlefield."
AET_anarch_police:0 "Army Criers"
AET_anarch_police_desc:0 "The sole bad thing about being an army built along anarchist principles is that, if a soldier doesn't want to do his work, we cannot make him. But what if we could? Our most avid and forceful preachers of the revolution can be embedded into the army to exhort our fighters forwards to glory and heroism."
AET_anarch_generals_3:0 "Large-Scale Operations"
AET_anarch_generals_3_desc:0 "Experience has taught our councils and our armies how to work together across truly massive front lines that span entire theaters, and our army is so much stronger for it. Growth of our state teaches us how to grow it further in a cycle to dismantle the temples, palaces, and bullies."
AET_anarch_generals_4_a:0 "Anarchist Coordinators"
AET_anarch_generals_4_a_desc:0 "It's not contradictory - someone somewhere has to know where the tanks are needed and how to get them there from where they're placed, and just because we don't have an explicit hierarchy doesn't mean that the usual army of secretaries and quartermasters can be left behind."
AET_anarch_generals_4_b:0 "Anarchist Stormtroopers"
AET_anarch_generals_4_b_desc:0 "The revolution is first won in the cities and refusal to acknowledge this truth has ended many a partisan band prematurely. Our own fighters are rapidly gaining a knowledge base from our infiltrators as we come upon them and reintegrate them, and they learn how to battle in the streets and across rooms."

AET_revanchism:0 "Adelart Revanchism"
AET_revanchism_desc:0 "Adelart was just as much a part of Greifwald as any other, and its loss is keenly felt - not least because revenues from oil had been a major part of the economy. They might seem friendly, but the Adelartian territory is run by criminal gangs who would not be missed. Glory, wealth, and a true united Greifwald is but a single war away."
AET_serial_killer:0 "Serial Killer"
AET_serial_killer_desc:0 "Falcontown's wealthy districts are currently gripped by a slow-burning terror. Every few weeks or months, someone turns up strangled to death. Nothing is ever taken from the body, nor is there ever any variation in the method of killing. The only discernable pattern is that they are usually younger griffons who have recently achieved some great success in their life, such as graduating as valedictorian or winning a sports competition or becoming engaged. So far, the police have been powerless to stop it."
AET_morgans_bandits:0 "Morgan's Bandits"
AET_morgans_bandits_desc:0 "Although they are often called 'bandits', the highway robberies and occasional assassinations are really the side-project of a major smuggling ring led by an ephemeral anarchist named Morgan Bernier. This does not make them more desirable."
AET_depatriates:0 "The Depatriates"
AET_depatriates_desc:0 "There's an entire class of creatures, mostly griffons, known as 'Depatriates' in Greifwald. They are mostly high-ranking foreign intellectuals and generals given asylum in exchange for lending their services to the nobles and government of the state. They're controversial and often obnoxious, and will remain as such until our politics start to stabilize, but collectively, their knowledge is both broad and deep."

AET_some_devolution_desc:0 "Now that things are peaceful, the first experiments in local democracy can begin. For now it's only a few hesitant feelers, but if nothing goes wrong, it will expand. The journey of one thousand six hundred and nine kilometers begins with a single step."
AET_much_devolution:0 "Journey to Republic"
AET_much_devolution_desc:0 "Count Corbin Cloudet was an autocrat, an authoritarian, and an uncompromising visionary. Count Ostrick Cloudet is an autocrat as well, but a far more liberal one content to ride the trends of modern politics. Will the third in line also be radically different? Long-term stability demands that the government change. Cloudet's successor might wield a lot of power, and they might not, but by then there will be a parliament to ensure that not all government functions lie on one set of unknown shoulders. To create a republican spirit the right way will take years, maybe even decades, but a strong monarch can afford to be patient."

AET_one_will:0 "The Icon of Maar"
AET_one_will_desc:0 "The icon has matured and it's purpose is revealed. Maar has chosen us to lead all of griffonkind into an old age of savagery and purity, of primal fear and primal joy, of griffons behaving as they did before the trinity rebuilt the world in their own image and experiencing things once driven extinct by the march of progress."
AET_maars_caars:0 "Metal In Motion"

AET_super_multiculturalism:0 "One Griffonia"
AET_super_multiculturalism_desc:0 "Cultural differences are an important part of finding one's own place in society, no matter how hard that is to respect. The Empire wanted everyone to be like themselves so they could be easier to manage, everyone a replaceable cog in a machine that only understood avarice. It's not how things ought to be."
AET_no_boomers:0 "Cult of Youth"

AET_good_paras:0 "Long-Range Infantry"
AET_good_paras_desc:0 "The wars that created Greifwald, that forged it and tore it apart and reunited it, were not stand-up fights between industrialized peers but were inelegant brawls between poor nations with poor supply lines. Any given moment, a soldier could expect to lack food, or ammo, or clothes, or all three. To be elite meant being able to fight anyways, and for special forces units deep behind enemy lines, that's still the case."

AET_maar_black_blood:0 "Black Blood"
AET_maar_black_blood_desc:0 "A plague has spread throughout our army. The soldiers are plagued by nightmares and delusions and, when injured, their blood is a deep black. The afflicted launch themselves against the enemy, even against the wishes of their own commanders, certain of all-consuming pain followed by death, or, failing that, victory. That the black blood gives its victims self-destructive levels of strength and endurance means that defeat is never certain."

AET_maar_revolutionary_fervor_desc:0 "Protests, strikes, riots, assassinations and plain murders... the passions of every creature in our country seem to be inflamed.

What can be done when even the pacifists are taking up arms?"
AET_maar_factory_broke:0 "Gross Incompetence"
AET_maar_factory_broke_desc:0 "All of a sudden, nothing works. Massive orders are constantly sent to the wrong address and arrive late, and excessive amounts of time are spent not only fixing ridiculous errors by machine operators who should know better, but then fixing those fixes when the mechanic only makes the problem worse. We would think it a conspiracy if it weren't for the fact that groups opposed to the government are suffering just as much under the shoddy accounting and frequent mistakes."

AET_CLOUDET_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 19 Aug, 970 in Falcontown\n\n§YRank§!: Count of the Lands of Greifwald and the Good Creatures Therein\n\n§YBiography§!: Ostrick Cloudet is the young son of an ambitious and devious provincial governor named Corbin and his equally ambitious wife. As he grew up, he witnessed the conditions that led to the Republican Revolution of 978, as well as the revolution itself, the aftermath, the crowning of his father as the Count of the province of Greifwald, the years of sectarian violence on either side of that event, the purges, the terror, the secession of Adelart and the failed attempts to bring it to heel, economic downturn, and finally, the deaths of his own two parents and much of his family by the plague in 1002. However, although his parents could've been cruel and merciless, they were not small-minded despots, and they ensured that Ostrick Cloudet would be shown uncountable perspectives from across the nation and the world in order for him to forge his own destiny when it became his time to rule.\nIt is truly remarkable that such good parents can come from such horrible creatures, although the new Count, despite how willing he is to break from their methods, would never say such a thing about them.\nAs a leader, he is moderate, restrained, open-minded, and soft-hearted, but he is also hesitant, fearful and light-pawed.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Scroup"

In those days, the Temple was the single road to education for the impoverished, and so the agnostic young griffon learned to be faithful in exchange for reading, writing, and all forms of knowledge. He wasn't deemed cut out for the priesthood, however, and became employed by the land's noble owners, who were particularly devout, and there his piety turned real. With a talon in every of Greifwald's social classes, he grew into a learned scholar, an excellent mediator, and passionate preacher.\nHe rejoined the Temple and, equally adept at resolving conflicts between verses and between griffons, became a beloved figure who swiftly rose through the ranks. Accusations of Maarite leanings and of noble interference slid off of him like water from a raincoat. His final superior in Greifwald's religious structure was claimed by the same plague that took much of the house of Cloudet, leaving Ludwig the highest priest in the land. A few years later, with no successors, a dying Count Ostrick Cloudet placed his country into the talons of his lifelong friend and confidant, who has ruled it ever since.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Scroup"

She was not a freelancer, but acted under the umbrella of the largest local crime organization, the Amein Community. As Morgan grew up, the Community was also undergoing rapid expansion that created a host of new management positions that dear mother filled one after the other. Soon she was one of the trusted lieutenants of the then-Baroni. He retired and, her having defeated every new challenge in the last twenty years, she was named his replacement. Morgan watched as, year after year, stale bread was replaced with cake, the house became larger while the bug count became smaller, and trips to the library turned into weeklong vacations in places like Yale and Pridea.\nThen something odd happened a few years into her tenure. She died in a car accident, and despite the fact that the position of Baroni wasn't hereditary, her will stated that it should go to Morgan, barely-tested and barely even an adult. What's more, the Amein Community was a business, but Morgan wanted to use it as something grander. A movement, the center of a unified front to liberate the workers of the world. Now, that is what it has become - the role of Baroni is increasingly rarely-called-upon as anarchy sweeps the old order away.\nAnd anyone who questions it will meet either irresistable beauty or an angry mob.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: LittlePudel"

The second was the secret one, the nobility's own, the Temple of Maar. For the last five hundred years, these two organizations drifted closer and closer together until Ebonwing's ascension to the Archonate merged them completely. Eyr's temple was little more than the publically-known version of Maar's, and thus was the one which was folded into the other. This meant that the Maarite prelate was the only remaining one, and thus, Aekold Helbrass, scion of the house of Ameins and lifelong devotee, became the second-highest priest in the land.\nHe might be a rampaging zealot harboring a multi-century grudge against the gods who destroyed his family's miniature empire, and he might be excessive in his prosecution of the disbelievers, but he is certainly good at getting the troops moving.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Motley"

He has spent most of the last 350 thousand years wandering the continent, watching the progression of time and how his fellow beings shaped the landscape and the civilizations which grew up in it. Unlike many other natural forces, the Peripherie Westwind is calm before interacting with mortals and tempestuous over the ocean where no one can be harmed (Griffons were not meant to be sea-dwellers), and Barbas is accordingly sociable by demon standards. He is also associated with forgotten things and owns a portion of the domain of the cool evenings of Spring and Fall in which Griffons rest between bedtime and the day's work.\nHe has become a leader in the Greifwaldian Holy Army to learn more about the mortals he passes on his journey. With his knowledge of the once-known, he brings an important level of unpredictability to a nation normally known for having a strong orthodoxy in the officer corps.

The only story from her childhood she likes to tell is that she went to elementary school with Thorax and found him so annoying she trained her pet maulwurf to throw dirt at him. She once mentioned privately that she joined the Kriegsmarine as soon as she was allowed in order to help prop up a family business, although she didn't mention what family or what business.\nHer claim is that she was a lowly cook on a ship that was destroyed during the 1002 anti-Chrysalian sailor's strikes, but she appeared in Greifwald mere weeks after those strikes were crushed. Clearly, whatever government attention she felt she garnered, there was enough of it that they would find her anywhere on Equus.\nWhen she arrived, her first order of business was to join Greifwald's river guard, riding patrol boats up and down the waterways. She was versatile and hardworking enough that she soon became captain of one of the little things, and had a notable skill in leadership that smelled far more like past experience than talent. She always stayed close to the waterline, whether it's in keeping her craft technically spotless or by unhesitatingly discussing matters with the crew when she found it appropriate. She also started wearing a wig so that the many Greifwaldians who had never seen a changeling before would stop calling her 'sir'.\nWhatever the case, between her nebulous past and her current service in Greifwald's riverine navy, there are few creatures alive who have had such a breadth of naval experience. When Greifwald found itself building a new naval institution from scratch and speedboats, numerous stubborn admirals with their last-generation experience were overlooked in order to get a creature who knew a little about everything and could learn the unique geopolitical needs of Greifwald.\n§YPortrait By§!: BlakaSmoko"

It seems that she was born to an abusive single father in the Sicameonese city of Keowin, ran away from home at the age of 17, was too unstable to hold down a job, and came to Greifwald to escape creditors and court dates.\nShe came to our attention when she started talking about secret government programs that actually existed. No matter how deeply we investigated her we couldn't figure out how she was finding out what she knew. Eventually we gave in and asked her. Her answer was that she was being told about them by one "Mr. Hailstorm", who she was (and is) in regular communication with, and who also drip-feeds her theories on the magical sciences and on future technologies in general. We have yet to figure out who that is, or if it's a real creature at all, and we believe Maar is using the deranged as a mouthpiece again.\nWhatever the case, her radical and often-incomprehensible scientific theories are considered brilliant by the experts whenever they can understand them. We've put her in charge of her own research division, and although her juniors and seniors both consider her "difficult", she gets good results.\n§YPortrait By§!:"

There is no evidence of this, but Trimmel finds it just as believable as the official story of his birth.\nWhatever the case, as a scrawny young grub, he learned that he was special. Most creatures abhor violence. They have to be pushed into it, prepared for it. Not Trimmel. Wherever he went, the bullies were put in their place with extreme prejudice. He was a hero. Then his parents found out and he learned that being special doesn't mean being good. Sometimes it means being very, very bad.\nSeeking to channel his passion productively, he joined the Wehrmacht and found himself rapidly rising through the ranks. He impressed Queen Chrysalis with his rare mixture of civilized skill and prehistoric brutality. She did not impress him, since he did not feel the latter quality was to be celebrated. Soon, he grew to despise her and her system, and began gathering a cabal of loyal changeling officers to use for his own purposes. He did not feel qualified, intellectually or morally, to run a country, so he planned to throw his influence behind the first coupist he didn't hate. Then outside forces put a stop to Queen Chrysalis first.\nWhen he made his army disappear to Greifwald, he found that he had swapped an accepting leader for a weak one. This time, he didn't wait for someone else to make the first move.\nOver the years, he has been known by many names. Trimmel Cetyl zu Gardis. Oberst Trimmel. Comrade Salt Bald. Mister Slime Fraud.

# AET_ship_hull_cruiser_1:1 "Super Destroyer Hulls"
# AET_ship_hull_cruiser_1_short:1 "Super Destroyers"
# AET_ship_hull_cruiser_1_desc:0 "The need for ships in between the conventional destroyer and the massive, slow, and expensive battleships led to the concept of the 'super destroyer', which proved to be very versatile and produced a wide array of designs and concepts."
# AET_ship_hull_cruiser_2:1 "Expanded Doctrine Super Destroyer Hulls"
# AET_ship_hull_cruiser_2_short:1 "Expanded Doctrine Super Destroyers"
# AET_ship_hull_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The radical versatility that the super Destroyer concept afforded led to new and larger hulls being built to accomodate more complex systems or simply heavier ones. New designs with heavier armor or mounts for larger cannons were drafted and produced en masse."
# AET_ship_hull_cruiser_3:1 "Long-Range Raider Super Destroyers"
# AET_ship_hull_cruiser_3_short:1 "Raider Super Destroyers"
# AET_ship_hull_cruiser_3_desc:0 "New ideas regarding the possibility of new cruiser designs have led to the development of hulls designed explicitly for long-range raiding operations or the mounting of anti-aircraft batteries and their gun directors, respectively. These extend the viability of current roles and keep this class of ships relevant moving forwards."
# AET_ship_hull_cruiser_4:1 "Super Destroyer Destroyers"
# AET_ship_hull_cruiser_4_short:1 "Super Destroyer Destroyers"
# AET_ship_hull_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Continued expansion of the role of the Super Destroyer led to a new niche in the class built specifically to fight and defeat its equivalents in foreign navies, known as "cruisers". Superior armor and armament and more advanced systems both demanded newer and larger layouts to accomodate them."
# AET_ship_hull_cruiser_5:0 "Second-Generation Super Destroyers"
# AET_ship_hull_cruiser_5_short:0 "Second-Generation Super Destroyers"
# AET_ship_hull_cruiser_5_desc:0 "The original purpose of the Super Destroyer was to be a mid-class ship between the battleship and destroyer, and thus, the newest breed of Super Destroyer focused on density to escape the race of ever-expanding hull size and cost. The radical versatility the ships afforded continued to be valuable without the colossal weapons platforms they had begun to grow."
# AET_ship_hull_cruiser_6:0 "Modern Missile-Armed Super Destroyers"
# AET_ship_hull_cruiser_6_short:0 "Modern Super Destroyers"
# AET_ship_hull_cruiser_6_desc:0 "The revolution of missile technology brought new life to the Super Destroyer as the smallest warship that could carry large amounts of heavy-class guided anti-ship missiles, and thus, after a brief stint out of the limelight, new forms of Super Destroyers were once again laid down and commissioned, now carrying banks of AshM's in their hull."

greifwald.28.t:0 "The Intelligentsia"
greifwald.28.d:0 "     As [Root.GetLeader] was faced with finding new ways to stregnthen the national military, his mind drifted to the lower nobles and higher bureaucrats of the nation, and one of the country's strongest resources that had yet to be fully tapped. After the Republican Revolution, many of the fleeing revolutionaries had been highly-educated. Count Corbin de Cloudet made a song and dance of allowing them to find refuge in the County of Greifwald if they remained apolitical thereafter. Many were brought onto his staff and into his court, and soon it was fashionable among the other elites to have their own 'foreign advisors', many of whom were fugitives. Status and time soothed the raging extremists, but it was part of the culture now that geniuses from abroad, eccentric or not, should be actively found and recruited by the government, and this had real effects on how things were ran. Count Ostrick de Cloudet himself, for example, had been highly influenced by the myriad of liberal academics his father had brought on.\n    And what about these educated creatures? As often-liberal staff of the upper government, most of them were still around after the various political changes. By now [Root.GetName] had the most concentrated pool of brilliant minds you could find on the continent without plundering an entire university. Although they were chosen for raw talent rather than practical merit and were often mocked by the lower classes for their insistence on idiosyncracy, they would make, on paper, one of the smartest officer corps on the planet if they were used as such. Or, if those engaged in military affairs instead were taken out, extremely efficient research laboratories were only a few penstrokes away."
greifwald.28.a:0 "High technology is in our claws!"
greifwald.28.b:0 "Eccentric officers have their own charm."

greifwald.29.t:0 "Fork In The Road"
greifwald.29.d:0 "     Count Ostrick de Cloudet walked the bustling streets of Falcontown. To be able to simply pop down to the stores and get a sandwich or a new hat, even as the leader of the whole nation, was his proudest achievement so far, although his security guards were not fans of it. At first the townsfolk had been shocked and the petty nobles scandilized, but after months, and then years, it was no longer spectacular that he took his daily walk outside the palace. Nowadays they paid attention to him, but they didn't bow as if he were his father or mother, or pester him with suggestions for political changes. "Good morning, Margueritte!" He called to an aged grocer. She was one of his closer acquaintances because she helped him hide from his court that he had a taste for cheap, fattening jerkey, and he didn't need the family doctor getting on him about his diet again.\n     "Good morning, Count Cloudet!" She called back. "It's so cold out there, are you sure you should be walking about?"\n     He placed a few idols on the counter. "It will be fine, this is a very nice coat." He leaned against one of the shelves as he took a few sticks of dried meat. "I've got a difficult decision coming up, and thought that a treat might make the answer clearer, or at least more palatable."\n     "Is it the kind of decision I can help you with?" Margueritte asked cheefully.\n     "I'm afraid not, although I wouldn't mind your opinion. Greifwald is between two countries which could become great powers, and both of them would want to annex us. Can we, as a country, remain independent? If not, which would be better to side with?" He looked at her and took a bite.\n     She shrugged. "I pretend to be an expert on public transport, but not on foreign policy."\n     Cloudet wanted to ask, "do you think I will make the right decision?", but that was certainly more doubt than he should show to a commoner. He was supposed to be above that. So he didn't."
greifwald.29.a:0 ""Understandable""

greifwald.30.t:0 "The Day Approaches"
greifwald.30.d:0 "     Cloudet stood over the battle map that had been given to him by his generals. On one side, the eastern border of Greifwald. On the other, the nation of Adelart. His generals were confident that victory was possible within the constraints he had given them. Greifwald would get much of its population and the majority of its oil supply back, both of which meant a lot of money for the coffers. He was still uneasy. Adelart had seceded some years before he became the Count, and he had dreaded the day he did what he as leader was expected to do and declared war. A single stroke of the pen – but how many lives would he end? Would he be able to live with himself after being directly responsible for the violent deaths of thousands, the destruction of houses and the work of generations? He never knew.\n     His nation demanded, however, that he find out. Greifwald needed every advantage it could get to survive the events to come, and even if it didn't, the populace wanted the country to be whole again and shouted as much in the streets. He looked up and around at the officers around the room. "Begin the operation when ready."\n     Across the room, his eyes met with Petalbeak's. "You're doing the right thing", those two blue orbs said, but he wasn't sure he believed it."

greifwald.31.t:0 "Law and...Forgiveness?"
greifwald.31.d:0 "     Deadly outlaws. Dangerous revolutionaries. Anarchists, and bandits. None of them had stopped Greifwald on its march towards the conquest of Adelart.\n    Through forests and over rivers, our forces engaged the armies of the breakaway state with equally deceptive tactics as the ones they employed. Far from a traditional, frontline conflict, the abscence of information and general confusion led to one of the most chaotic, yet at the same time, least deadly wars in recent memory. It is for this reason, and his pre-concieved idealism, that Count Cloudet made the decision he did.\n    A full pardon, and welcome, to the bandits and citizens of Adelart, as if they were reuniting family. If that weren't enough to send pure shock throughout both sides, the added immediate imprisonment of the Sherrif, and subsequent address which blamed the conflict mostly upon his cruel past actions, brought the conflict to an anti-climatic, and confusing end.\n    Stepping out onto the street, Merlock Wood gave a glance to his surrounding comrades, all of them just certain of their execution, now free Griffons. They were even allowed to keep their guns. For the first time in his life, Merlock Wood asked;" #welcome back bandits, you're all pardoned. not you sheriff, you suck balls
greifwald.31.a:0 ""Well...Now what?""

greifwald.32.t:0 "Broken Record"
greifwald.32.d:0 "     Difficulty was to be expected. Minor resistance, sure. But the stubborn attitudes of the more nationalistic groups of Adelart was above all, demoralizing.\n    Count Cloudet paced the room, and if his claws had not been gripped to the floor out of nervousness, the twitching of his wings would have probably sent him hovering. Sure, he didn't expect all of Adelart to immediately fall under his control, but surely his strategy of winning hearts and minds had to count for something. \n    Making their way into the Count's room, Reinhold Grinfeather's entrance hardly broke the Count out of his trance. "Merciful is one attribute, sire. Naiive is another."\n    Lifting his head, Count Cloudet regarded Grinfeather with a shake of their head. "I can't give up on them now. If the province of Adelart truly is the rightful territory of Greifwald, then so too are their citizens ours." With a heavy sigh, Cloudet lowered their head once more. "...I won't be a tyrant." Their voice said, softer than before.  #i have pardoned a bunch of anti-government radicals and now they are agitating against the government. how could this happen?

greifwald.33.t:0 "Anarchist's Mistress Captured!"
greifwald.33.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]   Last night, as part of the initiative to clean up Greifwald's streets, the nation's police launched a series of coordinated raids against criminal gangs. The biggest target was the band of anarchist Morgan Bernier. The raids resulted in the seizure of hundreds of illegal weapons and nearly a ton of narcotics, while nearly a thousand arrests were made, including many of Bernier's top lieutenants and his mistress.\n   Bernier himself seems to have eluded capture once again, but his wing may be bent by these developments to prevent him from returning to his former strength." #well we didn't get morgan bernier but we got his girlfriend

greifwald.34.t:0 "Revalations"
greifwald.34.d:0 "     Smalltail knocked on the door nervously, and Cloudet motioned for him to enter with about as much confidence. The Count didn't know what the police cheif wanted to talk about but... well, with a face like that, it couldn't be good, right? "So remember how, forever ago, we had the police raid Morgan's anarchist bandits and destroyed them?"\n     Oh hell, this was absolutely not good. "Yes," Cloudet egged him on.\n     "And how we didn't nab Morgan himself, but we did get his mistress, and we've been keeping her in prison as a hostage?" Cloudet waved at him to continue. "We... uh... didn't get Morgan's mistress. We got Morgan... and didn't realize it was him... because he was wearing a dress... and no one recognized him."\n     Cloudet stared into Elva's eyes. "I-" He began. "Uh... you..." He turned his head down and carefully massaged his temples with his claws. "You know what? I do want to know. How did no one notice for a year, and how did you finally figure it out?"\n     "We didn't notice because he managed to dodge every physical. There's no excuse, the guards will be talked to. What finally clued us in that something was up was that all the male personnel had been moved away and prisoners were still getting pregnant."\n     "You put a male in a women's prison and didn't notice for a year. Yeah, wow, you're right. There is no excuse for this level of incompetance. You..." Cloudet stopped himself. Elva's head bowed in shame. "I'm sorry." He began again. "I saw her... him... too, and I didn't catch it. We all made mistakes. Just... don't make me have to hear about Morgan again, alright?" Elva sighed and nodded, and left." #turns out we got morgan bernier

"None of us knew what to do with you, but Maar came to me in a dream and told me the way forwards, and it was good." The old griffon raked a talon from Grover's forehead down to the front of his beak with enough force to hurt but not enough to draw blood.\n     "Am I going to die or not?" Grover muttered dejectedly.\n     Archon Ebonwing chuckled. "Everyone dies, my son. But you, well, you just did... Jaspar Swingwing." Grover cocked his head at the old griffon and looked around the cell for hints. When he saw how his guards were looking at him, he looked about his own body and saw his coat of golden feathers turning pale green, a discoloration spreading from where Ebonwing had scraped him. The terror gave way to simple confusion and energy returned to his eyes. The new Archon continued. "Yes, Maar felt there was no purpose to an end with no beginning. And you had no beginning or end, you were a servant of your bloodline and your bloodline was a servant of Boreas and when your physical form died you would live on forever in the history books and monuments and in the legacy that Boreas and your bloodline gave you. You were born owing more and being owed more than any creature can comprehend. Now, Maar has claimed you as his own. Your life has begun. In thirty or forty years, the enchantment will fade, and we will find you, and then your life will end."\n     Grover's mind raced to try and grasp what was happening. "You're going to kill me in thirty years? What kind of nonsense is that?"\n     Ebonwing patted the youth on the head. "It's a gift. By tomorrow, you will be on the streets as your own creature, and you'll know how little time you have for you to waste as you create the life you want.""

greifwald.69.d:0 "     The kindly old priest entered the room, the illusion of certainty in his steps. Besides the Count's bed was a doctor and a court lawyer, who had been summoned for the situation was dire. They stepped aside. Inside the bed, Count Cloudet himself laid, sickly and withered, feathers discoloring. He smiled weakly. "This is familiar to you, isn't it?" He joked, but none laughed. Some years ago, a plague had claimed Ostrick de Cloudet's father and mother in a similar manner, and Ebonwing had been there for them too, although he was not a Prelate at that time. His predecessor was being taken by that same outbreak then.\n     "There are other times I would rather re-live." Ebonwing replied. "Have you thought about what I always said?"\n     Cloudet stared at the ceiling in the bedroom, the opulence hidden by the curtains drawn to avoid disturbing the monarch's now-sensitive eyes. Had he not seen it before, that this was the work of a fortnight would shock him. "This can't be what it was all leading up to. Looking back, I can't find anywhere I could have found the time to do the things I wish I had done."\n     "And if you had, what would you have done?" The priest asked.\n     Cloudet waved in the air dully. "Spent more time with my friends, I think. Maybe found a wife. But I can't bear to trade the long nights spent trying to do right by my country."\n     In his talons, Ebonwing's own soon grasped. "What a tragedy. A monarch who gave up his own happiness for his subjects and never regretted it, taken too soon. I'm sure actors will fight over who gets to play you on stage."\n     At that, Cloudet did laugh, despite his condition. "You're taking this well, old friend."\n     "I've done it before." Ebonwing tried to look peaceful for his comrade of so long. "When your parents were taken from us, you asked to hear about the world beyond. Shall we repeat that, also?"" #why is cloudet sick

greifwald.70.t:0 "The Blasphemer"
greifwald.70.d:0 "     It was deep into the evening when Ebonwing returned to his home. It was good that he was no longer a young griffon, for otherwise he would have left scars in the furnishings where he raked his claws against them. For many decades he had listened to the woes and triumphs of others and his heart had been hardened, and he had begun to fear that he could no longer feel with the energy he had once upon a time, but no longer. He regretted his past wishes, and although he knew that such pains were simply the flipside of the great joys which were also bestowed, in this moment he wanted nothing more than to go back to feeling little.\n     The Count would die soon. The doctors thought it was merely probable, but Ebonwing had a special connection with those who determined these matters, and he had been told that the Count was near the end of his life. Ostrick had done nothing to deserve the end he was receiving except to fail to conform to a plan he was never to be told about, and for the first time in Prelate Ebonwing's entire life, he cursed his heavenly patron.\n     It was only for a moment, but he cursed, and he hated, and he looked at the porcelain figurine on his end table and considered throwing it with all his might that it may be smashed against the wall. Then he realized his error and threw himself to the ground, prostrating and apologizing. Yet when he looked up, he felt the gaze of that small icon, and he heard the words, and they said that to love or hate of the way of heaven was irrelevant, and that to follow regardless was the thing which should be chased with all one's soul.\n     Thus, Ebonwing sat on his bed, head slumped into his claws, and he cried for the things he could not change." #f you, dad!

### National Focuses ###
AET_anarchy:0 "Anarchy in Greifwald"
AET_anarchy_desc:0 "The griffons of Greifwald have long lacked any strong opinions on matters one way or the other, but how can they continue like that when there's still a state that might take a position on events? The only solution is revolution! Morgan Bernier, a notorious guerrilla fighter, is already forming plans to topple the Count's rule."
AET_attack_falcon:0 "Raid Falcontown"

AET_worker_control_desc:0 "No hierarchies, or else! That is the motto of the GFT, and to achieve that goal we must tear down the hated oppression of 'the boss.' Once the factory owners are six feet under the workers will form cooperatives and be free to run the factory as they see fit."
AET_anarch_infta:0 "Volunteer Infrastructure Program"
AET_anarch_infta_desc:0 "Our now dead oppressors never bothered to build proper roads and bridges in the countryside. Now we must do what they never did and get to work. We must do this together, for the greater good of us all, but no one has to help if they do not wish to do so."

AET_liberate_HEL:0 "Liberate Adelart"
AET_liberate_HEL_desc:0 "As long as a single hierarchy exists anywhere anarchy is threatened. It is for that we reason that we must liberate our neighbours from their governments, starting with Adelart. There is no 'or else.' There is only war."

AET_liberate_AVI_desc:0 "Long have Avian griffons suffered under the terrible tyranny of nobles and bureaucrats, but not much longer. The Black Army marches east, and with it comes true freedom for all!"

AET_spread_anarchy:0 "Mother Anarchy and Her Sons"
AET_spread_anarchy_desc:0 "Mother Anarchy is the griffonisation of our movement. It's time we started to use her on our banners and flags as a symbol of the revolution. Let her inspire us to greater deeds, so ultimately all of griffonkind can be freed!"
AET_develop_arms:0 "Arm the Workers"
AET_develop_arms_desc:0 "The workers of the world must be granted arms, so they can protect their precious freedom. Thus we will seize the armouries of the authoritarian scum we have beaten and distribute weapons for all."
AET_expand_school_system:0 "Expand the Education System"
AET_expand_school_system_desc:0 "It has become clear that the stateless state needs more teachers to instruct children on how they shouldn't listen to their parents. The education system will thus to expanded to allow more research by our ingenious part-time scientists."
AET_liberate_POM:0 "Free the People of Pomovarra"
AET_liberate_POM_desc:0 "Pomovarrans have not tasted freedom in so long they must have forgotten what it is like. Soon they shall rediscover its wonder as the Black Army arrives, smashing their oppressors and breaking their shackles."

AET_expand_POM:0 "Integrate the Pomovarran Councils"
AET_expand_POM_desc:0 "The Pomovarrans have set up workers' councils during the occupation. We will invite these democratic units into the anarchic fold, so we can cooperate and share our wealth."
AET_liberate_FLO:0 "Fight for Flowena's Freedom"

AET_black_army_formation_desc:0 "The new Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Greifwald, otherwise known as RIAG or simply as the Black Army, shall form the backbone of the revolution. Morgan Bernier will be its figurehead and workers and peasants will voluntarily join its ranks. Liberty or death!"


AET_realpolitik:0 "Between Giants"
AET_realpolitik_desc:0 "Greifwald sits between two of the largest powers on the continent: The Kingdom of Aquileia and the old Griffonian Empire. It is of the utmost importance that we maintain good relations with both. We cannot let Greifwald fall into the claws of extremists, as it is likely that such a change would put us on the path to war with one or more powers on the Griffonian continent."
AET_complete_neutrality:0 "A Policy of Neutrality"
AET_complete_neutrality_desc:0 "We must maintain complete and utter neutrality in our dealings with both the Aquileians and the Imperials. To this end, we will instruct all echelons of power in Greifwald that the highest priority of the State is the preservation of the status quo. Greifwald shall be a beacon of stability in a world full of extremists."
AET_appease_neither:0 "Independence"
AET_appease_neither_desc:0 "The Empire would not accept us as a truly independent vassal, and Aquileia would not do so either. To maintain control over our affairs, foreign and domestic, we must take a hard stance for our own way of life. This will satisfy neither power, but they are led by wise rulers who will understand the necessity of this act and accept it for the show of character that it is."
AET_welfare_program:0 "Economic Relief Effort"
AET_welfare_program_desc:0 "Our economy is in shambles and there is widespread poverty among the people for a variety of reasons, but leveraging our natural resources and re-investing in the populace will quickly bear fruit."
AET_align_imperial:0 "Work with the Imperials"
AET_align_imperial_desc:0 "The Empire has been the greatest power in Griffonia for centuries. Even though it's power has declined under Grover V, it is very likely that the Griffonian Empire shall remain a large player on the world stage. Therefore, we should align ourselves more closely with the Imperial Sphere of Influence."
AET_imperial_politics:0 "Align with the Empire"
AET_imperial_politics_desc:0 "We must align our politics to closely match those of the Griffonian Empire. This will make it clear to our people that we stand with the Imperials, and that the powers that have shaped this continent for centuries are here to stay."
AET_imperial_arms:0 "Import Imperial Weaponry"
AET_imperial_arms_desc:0 "Our industrial base is very small when compared to that of the Empire. Purchasing some of the Imperial Arsenals Weapons will allow us to arm more griffons for any potential conflict."
AET_imperial_adivosrs:0 "Imperial Military Mission"
AET_imperial_adivosrs_desc:0 "The Imperial military is very well structured and uses advanced tactics and doctrines. By sending some of our officers to study Imperial military strategy, we should be able implement many new tactics and doctrines into our armed forces."
AET_imperial_industry:0 "Invite Imperial Industrialists"
AET_imperial_industry_desc:0 "Our economy is poor and underdeveloped, and most foreign investors have little interest in Greifwald. Owing to our diplomatic ties with the Empire, we may be able to persuade some prominent Imperial industrialists to not only invest in Greifwald, but perhaps even serve as advisors for our government. This will not solve all of our economic problems, but it should allow our economy to recover to some degree."
AET_imperial_economic_help:0 "Request Imperial Economic Aid"
AET_imperial_economic_help_desc:0 "Although the Greifwaldian economy has improved thanks to our Imperial friends, there is still a lot of room for improvement. The Empire may be willing to provide significant economic relief to us if we increase our diplomatic efforts and pledge to support the Empire in the future."
AET_develop_imperial:0 "Imperial Development"
AET_develop_imperial_desc:0 "The Griffonian Empire has agreed to launch an industrial development plan for Greifwald, including significant investments into our industry and scientific base. Not only will this improve the light and heavy industry of the nation, but it should also allow us to make significant progress in many scientific fields."
AET_imperial_guarantee:0 "Friends in the Palace"
AET_imperial_guarantee_desc:0 "The Griffonian Empire has done much for our economy, and we have openly stated our political support. Until now however, the Empire has not made any official proclamations of support with Greifwald. It may be time to ask the Imperials to change this, with the Empire officially guaranteeing our independence. "
AET_imperial_forts:0 "The Enemy to the South"
AET_imperial_forts_desc:0 "With our close ties to the Griffonian Empire, it is sadly quite possible that we may be drawn into a conflict with the Kingdom of Aquileia and her allies. Fortifying our southern border with bunkers, walls and trenches could prove to be an investment into the continuing sovereignty of Greifwald."
AET_align_aquileia:0 "Work with the Aquileians"
AET_align_aquileia_desc:0 "The Griffonian Empire may have been the strongest power on the continent once, but those days are long gone. It is very likely that the Kingdom of Aquileia will become the dominant power in Griffonia, and so we should seek cooperation with the Aquileians."
AET_aquileian_arms:0 "Import Aquileian Weaponry"
AET_aquileian_arms_desc:0 "As the Greifwaldian industrial base is quite small, it may be in our best interest to purchase some weapons from the Aquileians. This will allow us to arm more griffons for any potential conflict. Importing a large stockpile of small arms and a few artillery pieces seems to be the most sensible course at the moment."
AET_aquileian_adivosrs:0 "Aquileian Military Mission"
AET_aquileian_adivosrs_desc:0 "The Aquileian Military is one of the most advanced in the world. It may be possible to organise a joint military mission with the Aquileian high command. We would be able to learn a lot of new tactics and doctrines for our own military."
AET_aquileian_politics:0 "Align With the Aquileians"
AET_aquileian_politics_desc:0 "Aligning ourselves more closely with the Aquileian sphere of influence is our best hope for the future. It is clear they are the new major power on the Griffonian continent, and strengthening our ties with them is sure to be beneficial."
AET_aquileian_industry:0 "Invite Aquileian Industrialists"
AET_aquileian_industry_desc:0 "While it might be difficult to convince Aquileians to invest into Greifwald, it would not only improve our economy, but also bind us closely to Aquileia. This would help our diplomatic and political standing on the world stage."
AET_aquileian_economic_help:0 "Request a Loan from Aquileia"
AET_aquileian_economic_help_desc:0 "The Aquileian economy is much larger than that of Greifwald. Due to our recent leanings into the Aquileian sphere of influence, we may be able to convince them to loan us a large amount of money at a token interest rate. This would allow us to improve our economy and industry, and reduce the poverty amongst our population."
AET_develop_aquileian:0 "Aquileian Development Assistance"
AET_develop_aquileian_desc:0 "Our heavy industry is still lacking, despite all our efforts. But now that we have close ties to the Aquileian economy, we are in a position to change this. We should request a sizeable Aquileian investment into our heavy industry, as this would most likely improve both our economies."
AET_aquileian_guarantee:0 "A Friendship with the Eagles of the West"
AET_aquileian_guarantee_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Aquileia and her allies are more then capable of protecting the sovereignty of Greifwald from any foreign power. The Aquileians may be willing to sign a formal decree guaranteeing the independence of Greifwald from any would-be invaders."
AET_aquileian_forts:0 "The Enemy in the North"
AET_aquileian_forts_desc:0 "We are now formally in the Aquileian sphere of influence, and as such, the possibility of conflict with the Griffonian Empire looms over our heads. Fortifying our northern border will allow us to stop any Imperial incursion into Greifwald before it even begins."
AET_conquer_HEL:0 "Reclaim Adelart"
AET_conquer_HEL_desc:0 "The territories of Lissay and Eagleton, now composing the nation of Adelart, have been an integral part of Greifwald for centuries, before they were taken from us less than 20 years ago. Many griffons living there are still loyal to the Greifwaldian nation as their government is descending into extractionism... and our government needs the money from their oil fields."
AET_core_HEL:0 "Reintegrate Adelart"
AET_core_HEL_desc:0 "Now that we have secured all of the former territories of Adelart, we should begin to re-integrate the population there into Greifwald. The region has been terribly mismanaged under the Adelartian leadership, and the sooner we fix this, the better."
AET_develop_country:0 "Rebuild the Nation"
AET_develop_country_desc:0 "All of Greifwald is united now, at least on paper. But sadly, the former Adelartian lands of Lissay and Eagleton are lagging behind in most fields. With a significant investment, it should be possible rebuild the industry of our nation to it's former glory, before we were separated."
AET_new_country:0 "Springtime for Greifwald"
AET_new_country_desc:0 "The Unification of Greifwald has had a tremendous effect on our nation: for the first time in decades, the griffons of Greifwald can be proud of their nation, and support for our government is at an all-time high. We must capitalise on this, and lead the Greifwaldian people into a new age of happiness and prosperity."
AET_new_army:0 "Form the Greifwaldian National Army"
AET_new_army_desc:0 "Since the successful war of unification, support for the military is at an all-time high, and many griffons are joining the military every day. Now that a true Greifwaldian nation exists, we can launch a significant expansion of our military. Greifwald shall never be divided again."
AET_new_science:0 "Offer Citizenship to Foreign Scientists"
AET_new_science_desc:0 "The World has grown very dangerous in the last decades, and many foreign scientists are looking for a stable nation in which they can take up residence. By extending offers of citizenship to scientists living in unstable and war-torn nations, we can significantly improve our scientific base."
AET_invite_scientists:0 "A Haven for the Sound of Mind"
AET_invite_scientists_desc:0 "Many scientists have taken up our offer of citizenship, but we can still improve upon this number. By granting significant subsidies to scientists and giving them more protection under the law, we can make Greifwald even more attractive to intelligent people looking for a safe haven."
AET_land_reform:0 "Massive Agricultural Reforms"
AET_land_reform_desc:0 "Our heavy industry has improved significantly, but our agriculture is still lagging behind in many fields. We must fix this as soon as possible and start a massive reform of our agriculture. This "Agricultural Revolution" will make our agricultural industry one of the most advanced on the continent."
AET_further_development:0 "An Industrial Heartland"
AET_further_development_desc:0 "The state of Twöchanerwald has the weakest industry in all of Greifwald, but this can be changed. The thick forest will allow us to establish a large lumber industry there, which should in turn attract more investors."
AET_immigration_act:0 "Loosen Immigration Laws"
AET_immigration_act_desc:0 "Many people, griffons and others, seek to emigrate their native land in search of a better place to live. We have the industry and agriculture to support a very large population, and so we could take advantage of thousands of immigrants. But first, a loosening of our immigration laws is in order."
AET_expand_armouries:0 "State Funded Armouries"
AET_expand_armouries_desc:0 "The recent recruitment drive has, sadly, created a new problem: Our ever-growing military needs more weapons and equipment than we are capable of producing at the moment. We should set up large armouries and expand our heavy industry to make sure our soldiers have all the equipment they need."


AET_archonate_help:0 "Request the Help of the Prelate"
AET_archonate_help_desc:0 "In times of trouble like this griffons turn to their faith for strength. Our government has no opinion on this one way or the other, but the local Prelate, Ludwig Ebonwing, certainly does. He seems to be proposing many interesting economic and political ideas. Perhaps we should take advantage of this."
AET_knighly_order:0 "Invite the Knights of Arcturius"
AET_knighly_order_desc:0 "The Knights of Arcturius have long been seen as an honourable force for good with not a hint of corruption among their various chapters. Indeed, the very idea of such griffons pledging themselves to evil is mind-boggling. Perhaps it's time we bring these fine fellows in to teach people a thing or two."
AET_paramilitaries:0 "Organise Militias"
AET_paramilitaries_desc:0 "Now that sterling noble griffons of unquestionable character and not a hint of heresy are backing the government it's time for the commoners to join in the new military. A militia of mighty griffons of valour shall be formed, and among them not a single cultist shall be found. This new divine military shall surely help us."
AET_church_help:0 "Economic Assistance from the Gods"
AET_church_help_desc:0 "Greifwald is primarily an agricultural nation and [Root.CurrentPatronDeity] is a deity heavily intertwined with natural life and with the nature of griffon-kind. Their teachings already focus on concepts adjacent to economics such as boom-and-bust cycles, but is there any other wisdom in their holy literature to enhance our understanding of policy?"
AET_church_jobs:0 "Godly Development Plan"
AET_church_jobs_desc:0 "Our nation's economic troubles are many, but although we do not worship any god of money, the road to prosperity can still be found in the teachings of great [Root.CurrentPatronDeity]. Who else but they can understand the cycles of passion which animate socities as sure as the individual?"
AET_regretful_sickness:0 "Cloudet's Tragedy"
AET_regreftul_sickness_desc:0 "Sadly, Count Ostrick de Cloudet will soon have fallen victim to a terrible illness, the same one which claimed his parents and the previous prelate of the region. It is all Ebonwing can do to make him comfortable and courageous in the face of what is likely his final days in this life."
AET_church_coup:0 "The Prelate Steps In"
AET_church_coup_desc:0 "With the tragic passing of Count Cloudet the Second, it falls to his closest confidant and designated heir, Prelate Ebonwing, to fulfill the late ruler's dream for Greifwald. It will be a long road, but worth it in the end."
AET_church_industry:0 "The Prelate's Industrial Plan"
AET_church_industry_desc:0 "Prelate Ebonwing's new economic development plan is the greatest possible for the nation, and so must be implemented unquestioningly."
AET_church_arms:0 "Temple Armouries"
AET_church_arms_desc:0 "Prelate Ebonwing has declared that temples must cease being means merely of peace, and must fully dedicate themselves to the task of national defence. Any disobedience by heretics who seek a non-violent solution shall be dealt with harshly."
AET_religious_schools:0 "Religious Schooling"
AET_religious_schools_desc:0 "It is an unfortunate fact that one of the most consistently literate social groups in the nation are the priesthood, who must be able to read for their work, yet this is a blessing also. Almost every griffon in the nation, especially the poor, sees the priest regularly. The skills of the future workforce can be taught by the church, according to the principles of [Root.CurrentPatronDeity]"
AET_church_research:0 "Godly Researchers"
AET_church_research_desc:0 "It's time for our scientists to face facts that they will never be as good as the divine, and so must submit to being their research in re-purposed temples or else. On the plus side for them, this will grant them more space for more experiments and indeed this is already happening. The mutations are a normal side effect of science, make no mistake."
AET_paramilitaries_2:0 "Expand the Militia System"
AET_paramilitaries_2_desc:0 "It's time to expand the militia system previously implemented, even if we have to scrape the bottom of the barrel to do it. Those brigands and convicts are sure to be turned into upstanding griffons, and make no mistake about it, they are not being used for some ulterior motive."
AET_destroy_HEL:0 "Destroy Adelart"
AET_destroy_HEL_desc:0 "Those confounded Adelartians with their stupid hats and their stupid smug grins have gone too far this time! We must destroy them, and annex their petty county too!"
AET_fatherland_calls:0 "Answer the Fatherland's Call"
AET_fatherland_calls_desc:0 "It is time to return to the Empire, integrating our county and its government into the larger whole. This is the end of the line for our independence, but it is for the best. After all, just imagine how far a loyal servant of the Empire can get into the halls of power..."
AET_madness_calls:0 "[Root.GetMadnessCallsFocusName]"
AET_madness_calls_desc:0 "[Root.GetMadnessCallsFocusDesc]"
AET_madness_calls_real:0 "Maar's Return"
AET_madness_calls_real_desc:0 "For centuries, the cultural elite of Greifwald have kept their traditions safe from the trinity. They have nurtured Maar's teachings under the guise of tradition, have spread Maar's word in the guise of an exotic Eyr. Maar loves adaptation and he loves death, and it is time for the trinity to die until their rebirth."
AET_madness_calls_fake:0 "Fight for Independence"
AET_madness_calls_fake_desc:0 "Faithful though the Griffonian Empire is, there is one Greifwald and so it should be. The imperial war of conquest of a fellow godly state is unacceptable and we shall stand against it alone if we must. It is a righteous cause we follow without hesitation. Even though we may fall, the world will know that Eyr's own stood for peace and tranquility."


AET_kill_knights:0 "Get Rid of the Arcturian Knights"
AET_kill_knights_desc:0 "Many of the chapter have come over to the Prelate's way of thinking, but there are still those amongst the Arcturian Knights who resist the true path. They must be eliminated."
AET_sacrafices:0 "Order Over All"
AET_sacrafices_desc:0 "The bandits must be exterminated by the hundreds with vicious abandon, publically and spectacularly. No house of justice or courtyard in the country is large enough for our grand show except for one - the plaza before the statue of Arcturius"
AET_mask_off:0 "Grim Work Begins"
AET_mask_off_desc:0 "The Prelate has been acting strangely sanguine as of late. Apparently his patron deity has been giving him divine inspiration more than usual, and has commanded him to spread the influence of Greifwald far and wide as the champion of the will of the gods."
AET_invade_AVI:0 "Destroy the Avian Heretics"
AET_invade_AVI_desc:0 "The foolish and small House of Avian thinks they can get away with the crime of existing outside our borders, but they are wrong. They shall become a part of our country, by force."
AET_take_AVI:0 "Burn the False Idols"
AET_take_AVI_desc:0 "In their arrogance, the Avian fools thought they could get away with worshipping anyone other than Maar, and for that time we shall burn their idols along with their homes."
AET_invade_POM:0 "Strike Down the Pomovarrans"
AET_invade_POM_desc:0 "Those dastardly Pomovarrans are seeking to destroy us. It is true! Ebonwing has seen it in a vision. We must strike first."
AET_take_POM:0 "Strike Down the Heretics"
AET_take_POM_desc:0 "Now that we have secured the land we must prevent the Pomovarrans from ever rising up against us. Orthodoxy is heresy, death is life, evil is good. They must learn to accept these truths."
AET_annex_FLO:0 "Burn Flowena"
AET_annex_FLO_desc:0 "The city-state of Flowena has long been praised for its beauty. With this compliment they insult our altars and sacrificial daggers, and so must be brought to heel. We shall turn the entire city into an altar and make them all pass through the fire."
AET_take_FLO:0 "Coerce the Heathens"
AET_take_FLO_desc:0 "To make sure the survivors know their place, we shall implement mandatory beatings and executions. The only clothes they will be permitted will be mud, and tears will be the only baths they shall get. The only reprieve from this shall be joining the military, and then they shall get all the drink and flesh they can stomach."

AET_the_icon:0 "Maar's Tomorrow"
AET_the_icon_desc:0 "The truth of the artefact is revealed - it is not an icon, but an idol. The idol. The Idol of Maar. It is his strongest gift to us and is the sign of the life of Maar's new empire. Praise him, ruler of life and death."


AET_industrial_1:0 "Begin Industrial Development Plans"
AET_industrial_1_desc:0 "The Greifwaldian industry is extremely lacking at the moment, and poverty is widespread. In order to fix the many issues the nation faces, we should begin drafting plans for the growth of our economy."
AET_infra_development:0 "Forest Roads"
AET_infra_development_desc:0 "Much of the nations countryside consists of forests, which are difficult to traverse. Constructing basic new roads going through the forests, we should be able to transport goods and materials more easily. This will increase our industrial and economic growth in the long run."
AET_oil:0 "Nationalise the Adelart Oil Fields"
AET_oil_desc:0 "Our newly acquired lands in Adelart are rich in oil, but the private sector is not exploiting this to it's fullest capacity. Bringing these oil fields under state control will allow us to maximise the amount of oil that is being extracted."
AET_oil_refineries:0 "Experiment With Synthetic Oil"
AET_oil_refineries_desc:0 "New advances in science may allow us to produce synthetic alternatives to oil. Needless to say, this would benefit our trade attractiveness and improve our industry drastically."
AET_oil_p:0 "Black Gold"
AET_oil_p_desc:0 "Our efforts to increase oil extraction have born fruit: Our oil industry is booming, and it doesn't show signs of stopping. It is believed that with increased funding, more synthetic oil can be produced. We will also be able to further expand the Adelart Oil Fields, and take advantage of any source that remains untapped. It is likely that the "Black Gold", as many griffons have named it, will continue to flow for many decades more."
AET_industrial_2:0 "Modern Industrial Methods"
AET_industrial_2_desc:0 "With the advent of heavy machinery in recent decades, new industrial methods are being devised by scientist and industrialists. We should take advantage of this, and implement revolutionary new methods of production. This would certainly benefit our industry as a whole."
AET_steel_and_tungsten:0 "Expand the Cloudguard Mines"
AET_steel_and_tungsten_desc:0 "The hills in Cloudguard have always been rich in all kinds of metal, but this has not yet been exploited to its fullest extent. We should fix this as soon as possible, and significantly expand the scale of our mining operations in Cloudguard."
AET_steel_road:0 "More Roads in the Forests"
AET_steel_road_desc:0 "Following the success of our new mining operations in Cloudguard, more materials are being transported all over the nation. We must now expand our forest road network again, in order to ease the strain on our infrastructure."
AET_more_steel:0 "Dig for Iron"
AET_more_steel_desc:0 "While doing construction work in Twöchanerwald for our recent infrastructure expansion, some engineers came across a small iron vein in the forest. If we can find the main vein, we should be able to construct mines there. This would allow us to increase our iron surplus and thus, our steel production. "
AET_radio_f:0 "Electronic Research"
AET_radio_f_desc:0 "Electronics is a relatively new field of science, but many great advances have been made recently. There are many potential applications for this technology, both civilian and military."
AET_mechanised_agriculture:0 "Mechanise Agriculture"
AET_mechanised_agriculture_desc:0 "Heavy machinery can not be used only for war. Using tractors and other machines in our agriculture will increase our food surplus, which may in turn stimulate our economy."
AET_factory_buildup:0 "Industrial Buildup"
AET_factory_buildup_desc:0 "With our recent industrial advances, our economy is looking better than ever before. We should capitalise on this by building several new, state-of-the-art factories. This should allow us to increase our industrial capabilities even further."
AET_arms_building:0 "Develop the National Arms Industry"
AET_arms_building_desc:0 "In recent decades the World has grown to be very dangerous. In order to secure our sovereignty, a military buildup is in order. Investing in heavy industry should allow us to produce all the equipment we need to arm our soldiers."
AET_modern_soc:0 "Modernise the Industrial Sector"
AET_modern_soc_desc:0 "Despite our recent industrial growth, we are still lagging behind in some areas. We should provide additional funds to scientists in order to create a truly modern industrial sector."
AET_army_1:0 "Begin Reforming the Army"
AET_army_1_desc:0 "After the third or forth time someone tried to kill our beloved ruler from so far away they were but a speck on the horizon it came to our attention that our military was behind the times. We shall fix that."
AET_army_2:0 "Modern Support Equipment"
AET_army_2_desc:0 "Modern support equipment is more than a cot and a campfire, it's bandages, radios, shovels, binoculars, trucks, repair kits, and the training to use all of that. We have binoculars, but we could have much more."
AET_army_3:0 "Modern Rifles"
AET_army_3_desc:0 "Smokeless powder is an amazing. Not only does it do exactly what it sounds like, produce thrust for a bullet without generating much smoke, but it also produces enough power to throw rounds out to unprecedented ranges. How did we skip on this innovation for so long?"
AET_army_4:0 "Cannons from Abroad"
AET_army_4_desc:0 "Sometimes signing a cheque for something is easier than designing it yourself. That's the case with Griefwald's artillery. Contracting a foreign actor to get our guns up to snuff shall do much to improve our position."
AET_army_5:0 "Recycle the Old Guns"
AET_army_5_desc:0 "As tempting as it is to throw away all our old weapons for the shiny new ones we should keep cost concerns in mind. If we can adapt an old blackpowder rifle for smokeless cartridges for half the cost of building a new rifle from scratch why not take it? If nothing else it should cut down on training time."
AET_army_6:0 "Guns of the West"
AET_army_6_desc:0 "Artillery, the backbone of modern war. We new and better variants of these formidable weapons. Of that there can be no doubt."
AET_army_7:0 "A Rifle in Every Claw"
AET_army_7_desc:0 "From the Amein town hall a scientist did proclaim to the crowd, "You get a gun! And you get a gun! And you get gun! Everyone gets a gun!""
AET_army_8:0 "Exempt Scientists From Military Service"
AET_army_8_desc:0 "Our military's continued success depends are newer and better technology. We must never again lag behind the curve. To that end we must allow our scientists to go about their business without fear of draft letters coming in the mail."
AET_army_9:0 "Develop a Doctrine"
AET_army_9_desc:0 "We have a lot of great guns, but that's only half the equation. Information is ammunition, after all. It's time we gained the knowledge of how to properly deploy our arms."
AET_army_10:0 "Luna Nova Experiments"
AET_army_10_desc:0 "A group of our finest scientist-mages recently travelled to the Luna Nova Academy in Equestria. There they participated in an experiment to create enchanted crystals to power a Light Amplification by Simulated Emission of Radiation device. They have since returned our lands and brought with them the knowledge of what they learned. Apparently believing in ourselves is our magic. Nice!"
AET_army_13:0 "Enchanting!"
AET_army_13_desc:0 "They were right! Believing in ourselves was our magic, and it's time we rediscovered exactly what that means. We shall forge a shining chariot to break through the heavens with our magic! ... Metaphorically, of course."
AET_army_11:0 "An Army on Wheels"
AET_army_11_desc:0 "While griffon-pulled carts are great for airborne operations they leave something to be desired when each member of an artillery team needs a dedicated chiropractor. Motorised units promise to resolve those issues. All we have to go is get griffons to accept moving on the ground."
AET_army_12:0 "Armoured Tractors and Tanks"
AET_army_12_desc:0 "The next evolution of vehicular combat is to put armour on-board to resist small arms fire. Of course, the obvious counter is to shoot them with big guns, like artillery. Therefor we must pre-emptively counter this counter with better engines and even more armour."
AET_army_14:0 "Establish the FMA"
AET_army_14_desc:0 "The Falcontown Military Academy has been proposed as the solution to the ever growing needs of our army to innovate. Perhaps it is time we do this. After all, knowing is half the battle."
AET_state_air:0 "Reclaim the Sky"
AET_state_air_desc:0 "For centuries Griffons have ruled the skies, but now our people are fat and lazy, and the sky is dominated by fantastic flying machines. We must reclaim out rightful place in the air, starting by building expanded airports to accommodate today's fixed-wing aircraft."
AET_air_1:0 "Hire New Pilots"
AET_air_1_desc:0 "Contrary to expectations, we can't just throw our overweight subjects into aircraft and tell them that its their new mobility scooter. We will actually have to hire griffons with specialised training to fly these things. Lesson learned there."
AET_air_6:0 "Rocket Propulsion Experiments"
AET_air_6_desc:0 "While current estimates say that they won't have a great effect on our air force directly, the field of large rocketry is growing in prevelance for its uses in long-range munitions and certain specialized designs. What's more, it may be a stepping stone to better things."
AET_air_7:0 "Jet Propulsion Experiments"
AET_air_7_desc:0 "The investigation into rockets revealed that if we could get similar performance from a less dangerous engine then we could be onto something impressive. Our engineers, in fact, explained this while bringing up just such an engine - the jet. This could very well be the future of aircraft design and we can't afford to be left behind."
AET_air_8:0 "Radical Engine Types"
AET_air_8_desc:0 "One of our more deranged engineers has proposed that we power planes using an element that is somehow related to that stuff we put in our glow-in-the-dark paint. Her proposal was 1200 pages long and featured no words shorter than four syllables, but the advisors who understood it say it's an interesting idea."
AET_air_2:0 "A New Pair of Wings"
AET_air_2_desc:0 "Light lighter aircraft are the most basic of combat capable aircraft that are actually meant to engage in combat, and it's time we invested into research for that."
AET_air_5:0 "Wings of Steel"
AET_air_5_desc:0 "Heavy fighters! Is there anything they can't do? Strategic bombing and dodging. Never mind that though, think of the versatility!"
AET_air_3:0 "A New Pair of Talons"
AET_air_3_desc:0 "It's time the ground griffs were given support from the air. What kind of support? Only the closest."
AET_air_4:0 "Talons of Steel"
AET_air_4_desc:0 "The time has come to remind our enemies what it feels like to have their cities reduced to ash. Granted, on this continent we're all pretty much used to it by now, but not being able to shoot back is a new experience!"
AET_navy_1:0 "Marry the Sea"
AET_navy_1_desc:0 "With our newfound access to the sea one thing is clear, we must do more than flirt with naval power. We must take it out to dinner, treat it right, and buy it a nice engagement ring. It's time we settle down to a lifetime commitment with the ocean."
AET_navy_10:0 "Expand the Dockyards"
AET_navy_10_desc:0 "It's time we applied all the new experience we got designing ships to expand the dockyards and make our navy even greater."
AET_navy_2:0 "A Small Fleet"
AET_navy_2_desc:0 "We love the ocean, is that not clear? However, it would be more advantageous take things slow. Let us buy an apartment first, then move on to something grander."
AET_navy_3:0 "Floating Fortresses"
AET_navy_3_desc:0 "Go big, or go home. We love the ocean, right? Well it's time we proved that by building the grandest fleet the world has ever known. Why buy a mansion when you can buy a palace, eh?"
AET_navy_4:0 "Deep Under the Sea"
AET_navy_4_desc:0 "Up on the shore they work all day. Indeed, out in the sun they slave away, and all while we're devoting full time to floating under the sea. Ain't the sub life grand?"
AET_navy_5:0 "A Surface Fleet"
AET_navy_5_desc:0 "Submarines are great at many things, but tracking other submarines is not one of them. To counter the enemy's sub we shall have to build up a destroyer fleet."
AET_navy_7:0 "Escort Buildup"
AET_navy_7_desc:0 "Torpedo capable fast moving vessels serve a wide variety of roles easily, and thus form the great majority of any fleet. It's time we joined the fun."
AET_navy_8:0 "Heavy Cruiser Experiments"
AET_navy_8_desc:0 "Heavy cruisers and battlecrusiers form a distinctive niche of vessels with large calibre guns that can actually move at a fair clip. We should get at least one new model of these vessels."
AET_navy_9:0 "A Storm of Steel"
AET_navy_9_desc:0 "Our shells shall blot out the sky, and shall be delivered by grand new battleships. None shall doubt our conviction to secure the seas."
AET_wave_one:0 "Friends From Across the Sea"
AET_wave_one_desc:0 "Across the sea, the Changeling Lands are not quite as confident in themselves as they seem. With our recent changes to immigration law, a number of wealthier changelings have started investing in our country under the expectation that, should they decide it prudent, they would find refuge here. Harboring them is distasteful... but not more so than harboring Republicans."
AET_changeling_fighters:0 "Bugs in the Sky"
AET_changeling_fighters_desc:0 "It is well known that the Changeling air force was one of the best in the world, prior to their defeat. There is a proposal to invite some of the former members of the changeling aeronautical forces to Greifwald. Not only would they bring valuable knowledge, but it may also be possible for them to acquire some high-quality bug-produced aircraft."
AET_strange_shipment:0 "Mysterious Shipments"
AET_strange_shipment_desc:0 "For a while now, huge crates of equipment have arrived by air in one of our military bases. This has lead to much confusion, as no one ordered anything of the like. Just a few moments ago, it was revealed that these shipments contain some former Changeling tanks, still in good quality! They were apparently ordered by a high-ranking Changeling exile. This is a great opportunity for us to improve our army."
AET_escape:0 "A Blind Eye"
AET_escape_desc:0 "Many Changelings are still on the run, having to flee their homeland because of simple ideological differences. And indeed, many of these bugs could be highly useful to the Greifwaldian nation. We should seek to set up ways to make it easier for "oppressed" Changelings to seek asylum in Greifwald. This will surely benefit our nation! After all, what could possibly go wrong?"
AET_army_leader:0 "Old Friends"
AET_army_leader_desc:0 "Following our great accommodation of the Changeling high command, even more former generals and soldiers have made their way to Greifwald in search of refuge. Our officer cadre is now composed of some of the greatest military minds the world has to offer, and we will benefit immensely by it, no doubt."
AET_changeling_science:0 "Invite the Scientists"
AET_changeling_science_desc:0 "Many brilliant Changeling researchers were forced to leave their home, simply because of their political views. We have already established ourselves as a haven for any and all free thinkers, provided they have talent. By inviting more bug scientists to Greifwald, we should be able to significantly improve our scientific base."
AET_definetly_legal_science:0 "Buggy Science"
AET_definetly_legal_science_desc:0 "Towards the end of the war, the changelings have made significant scientific advances in some fields that might be considered...unorthodox. We could capitalise on this, and perhaps uncover great potential for ourselves, but it will require some...bending of the laws of Greifwald. Of course, in the long run it will definitely be worth it."
AET_changeling_industrialists:0 "Invite the Entrepreneurs"
AET_changeling_industrialists_desc:0 "Many important Changeling entrepreneurs were forced to flee their home, but many managed to liquidate their assets, thus allowing them to retain most of their wealth. These bugs are now looking for new countries not only to settle in, but also to invest. This could be a golden opportunity for us to improve our industry."
AET_weird_lord:0 "A Change of Pace"
AET_weird_lord_desc:0 ""My fellow Griffons of Greifwald, I, Count Cloudet, am speaking to you today to ensure you all that any rumours of sudden changes in my demeanour are completely unfounded. I have simply been very busy lately, and it seems that the stress is getting to me. But fear not, due to our Changeling allies and their assistance, I am still able to fully administer our great nation. Worry not, citizens, for all will be well.""

AET_revanchism_desc:0 "Adelart was just as much a part of Greifwald as any other, and its loss is keenly felt - not least because revenues from oil had been a major part of the economy.

The second was the secret one, the nobility's own, the church of Maar. For the last five hundred years, these two organizations drifted closer and closer together until Ebonwing's ascension to the Archonate merged them completely. Eyr's church was little more than the publically-known version of Maar's, and thus was the one which was folded into the other. This meant that the Maarite prelate was the only remaining one, and thus, Aekold Helbrass, scion of the house of Amiens and lifelong devotee, became the second-highest priest in the land.\nHe might be a rampaging zealout harboring a multi-century grudge against the gods who destroyed his family's miniature empire, and he might be excessive in his prosecution of the disbelievers, but he is certainly good at getting the troops moving.\n§YPortrait By§!: Motley"

He has spent most of the last 350 thousand years wandering the continent, watching the progression of time and how his fellow beings shaped the landscape and the civilizations which grew up in it. Unlike many other natural forces, the Peripherie Westwind is calm before interacting with mortals and tempestuous over the ocean where no one can be harmed (Griffons were not meant to be sea-dwellers), and Barbas is accordingly sociable by demon standards. He is also associated with forgotten things and owns a portion of the domain of the cool evenings of Spring and Fall in which Griffons rest between bedtime and the day's work.\nHe has become a leader in the Greifwaldian Holy Army to learn more about the mortals he passes on his journey. With his knowledge of the once-known, he brings an important level of unpredictability to a nation normally known for having a strong orthodoxy in the officer corps. The fact that he's usually the size of a house has created some logistical challenges, but they are solvable.\n§YPortrait By§!: AnaStaFury"

greifwald.28.a:0 "Damn you, Trimmel!"

greifwald.29.t:0 "Fork In The Road"
greifwald.29.d:0 "     Count Ostrick de Cloudet walked the bustling streets of Falcontown. To be able to simply pop down to the stores and get a sandwich or a new hat, even as the leader of the whole nation, was his proudest achievement so far, although his security guards were not fans of it. At first the townsfolk had been shocked and the petty nobles scandilized, but after months, and then years, it was no longer spectacular that he took his daily walk outside the palace. Nowadays they paid attention to him, but they didn't bow as if he were his father or mother, or pester him with suggestions for political changes. "Good morning, Margueritte!" He called to an aged grocer. She was one of his closer acquaintances because she helped him hide from his court that he had a taste for cheap, fattening jerkey, and he didn't need the family doctor getting on him about his diet again.\n     "Good morning, Count Cloudet!" She called back. "It's so cold out there, are you sure you should be walking about?"\n     He placed a few idols on the counter. "It will be fine, this is a very nice coat." He leaned against one of the shelves as he took a few sticks of dried meat. "I've got a difficult decision coming up, and thought that a treat might make the answer clearer, or at least more palatable."\n     "Is it the kind of decision I can help you with?" Margueritte asked cheefully.\n     "I'm afraid not, although I wouldn't mind your opinion. Greifwald is between two countries which could become great powers, and both of them would want to annex us. Can we, as a country, remain independent? If not, which would be better to side with?" He looked at her and took a bite.\n     She shrugged. "I pretend to be an expert on public transport, but not on foreign policy."\n     Cloudet wanted to ask, "do you think I will make the right decision?", but that was certainly more doubt than he should show to a commoner. He was supposed to be above that. So he didn't."
greifwald.29.a:0 ""Understandable""

greifwald.30.t:0 "The Day Approaches"
greifwald.30.d:0 "     Cloudet stood over the battle map that had been given to him by his generals. On one side, the eastern border of Greifwald. On the other, the nation of Adelart. His generals were confident that victory was possible within the constraints he had given them. Greifwald would get much of its population and the majority of its oil supply back, both of which meant a lot of money for the coffers. He was still uneasy. Adelart had seceded some years before he became the Count, and he had dreaded the day he did what he as leader was expected to do and declared war. A single stroke of the pen - but how many lives would he end? Would he be able to live with himself after being directly responsible for the violent deaths of thousands, the destruction of houses and the work of generations? He never knew.\n     His nation demanded, however, that he find out. Greifwald needed every advantage it could get to survive the events to come, and even if it didn't, the populace wanted the country to be whole again and shouted as much in the streets. He looked up and around at the officers around the room. "Begin the operation when ready."\n     Across the room, his eyes met with Petalbeak's. "You're doing the right thing", those two blue orbs said, but he wasn't sure he believed it."
greifwald.30.a:0 "Please don't struggle..."

greifwald.31.t:0 "Law and...Forgiveness?"
greifwald.31.d:0 "     Deadly outlaws. Dangerous revolutionaries. Anarchists, and bandits. None of them had stopped Greifwald on its march towards the conquest of Adelart.\n    Through forests and over rivers, our forces engaged the armies of the breakaway state with equally deceptive tactics as the ones they employed. Far from a traditional, frontline conflict, the abscence of information and general confusion led to one of the most chaotic, yet at the same time, least deadly wars in recent memory. It is for this reason, and his pre-concieved idealism, that Count Cloudet made the decision he did.\n    A full pardon, and welcome, to the bandits and citizens of Adelart, as if they were reuniting family. If that weren't enough to send pure shock throughout both sides, the added immediate imprisonment of the Sherrif, and subsequent address which blamed the conflict mostly upon his cruel past actions, brought the conflict to an anti-climatic, and confusing end.\n    Stepping out onto the street, Merlock Wood gave a glance to his surrounding comrades, all of them just certain of their execution, now free Griffons. They were even allowed to keep their guns. For the first time in his life, Merlock Wood asked;" #welcome back bandits, you're all pardoned. not you sheriff, you suck balls
greifwald.31.a:0 ""Well...Now what?""

greifwald.32.t:0 "Broken Record"
greifwald.32.d:0 "     Difficulty was to be expected. Minor resistance, sure. But the stubborn attitudes of the more nationalistic groups of Adelart was above all, demoralizing.\n    Count Cloudet paced the room, and if his claws had not been gripped to the floor out of nervousness, the twitching of his wings would have probably sent him hovering. Sure, he didn't expect all of Adelart to immediately fall under his control, but surely his strategy of winning hearts and minds had to count for something. \n    Making their way into the Count's room, Reinhold Grinfeather's entrance hardly broke the Count out of his trance. "Merciful is one attribute, sire. Naive is another."\n    Lifting his head, Count Cloudet regarded Grinfeather with a shake of their head. "I can't give up on them now. If the province of Adelart truly is the rightful territory of Greifwald, then so too are their citizens ours." With a heavy sigh, Cloudet lowered their head once more. "...I won't be a tyrant." Their voice said, softer than before.  #i have pardoned a bunch of anti-government radicals and now they are agitating against the government. how could this happen?
greifwald.32.a:0 ""I just have to keep trying...""

greifwald.33.t:0 "Anarchist's Mistress Captured!"
greifwald.33.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]   Last night, as part of the initiative to clean up Greifwald's streets, the nation's police launched a series of coordinated raids against criminal gangs. The biggest target was the band of anarchist Morgan Bernier. The raids resulted in the seizure of hundreds of illegal weapons and nearly a ton of narcotics, while nearly a thousand arrests were made, including many of Bernier's top lieutenants and his mistress.\n   Bernier himself seems to have eluded capture once again, but his wing may be bent by these developments to prevent him from returning to his former strength." #well we didn't get morgan bernier but we got his girlfriend
greifwald.33.a:0 "Close enough!"

greifwald.34.t:0 "Revalations"
greifwald.34.d:0 "     Smalltail knocked on the door nervously, and Cloudet motioned for him to enter with about as much confidence. The Count didn't know what the police cheif wanted to talk about but... well, with a face like that, it couldn't be good, right? "So remember how, forever ago, we had the police raid Morgan's anarchist bandits and destroyed them?"\n     Oh hell, this was absolutely not good. "Yes," Cloudet egged him on.\n     "And how we didn't nab Morgan himself, but we did get his mistress, and we've been keeping her in prison as a hostage?" Cloudet waved at him to continue. "We... uh... didn't get Morgan's mistress. We got Morgan... and didn't realize it was him... because he was wearing a dress... and no one recognized him."\n     Cloudet stared into Elva's eyes. "I-" He began. "Uh... you..." He turned his head down and carefully massaged his temples with his claws. "You know what? I do want to know. How did no one notice for a year, and how did you finally figure it out?"\n     "We didn't notice because he managed to dodge every physical. There's no excuse, the guards will be talked to. What finally clued us in that something was up was that all the male personnel had been moved away and prisoners were still getting pregnant."\n     "You put a male in a women's prison and didn't notice for a year. Yeah, wow, you're right. There is no excuse for this level of incompetance. You..." Cloudet stopped himself. Elva's head bowed in shame. "I'm sorry." He began again. "I saw her... him... too, and I didn't catch it. We all made mistakes. Just... don't make me have to hear about Morgan again, alright?" Elva sighed and nodded, and left." #turns out we got morgan bernier
greifwald.34.a:0 "This country sucks sometimes."

greifwald.35.t:0 "The First GELA"
greifwald.35.d:0 "     On orders from the Count, the Greifwaldian Excellence in Literature Award has been created. Every few years, a panel of judges will read the most iconic and popular Greifwaldian books released and give the presigious decoration, plus a small sum of money, to whichever one they feel captures the 'Greifwaldian spirit' the best. It is hoped that this will promote Greifwald's culture to old and new citizens.\n     There are only a few real contenders for the prize. Among them is 'The Birds in Tights', about a heroic bandit leader who fights a farcical guerilla war against the corrupt Vice-Governor of Greifwald as the Governor campaigns with the Emperor elsewhere. While praised for its light-hearted and free spirit, less historically-literate readers struggled to tell where the fictionalized story of Merlock Wood ended and the pure invention began.\n     Another entrant is 'The Exiles', a thinly-veiled autobiography. The unnamed main character was too young to fight in the Republican Revolution and, in the chaos that followed, bounced from cause to cause for Greifwaldian independence. Despite how clueless and brazen the main character is, the book bursts with energy and captures the feeling of that time perfectly.\n     A novel not about Greifwald itself, 'Imperially Deranged' is a black comedy about a high-end minister in the Griffonian Empire who kills prostitutes to fill the hole in his soul from the petty games he plays to maintain his social status. Its biting satire of Imperial government culture is overshadowed by less-sophisticated readers seeing the protagonist's excessively curated pretend-personality and finding him charming rather than pathetic.\n     The final entrant is 'The Forest's Red Twilight', about a mercenary who joins a company hired to patrol Greifwald in the initial stages of its pacification. The band of outlaws and degenerates goes off the rails with bloodlust and is destroyed by every group in the region at once. One of the judges threw up while reading it from the extreme violence, yet the hauntingly beautiful descriptions of the natural world and the strange demon known as the 'Juror' are unforgettable." #what is the great greifwaldian novel?

greifwald.40.t:0 "The Strange Land"
greifwald.40.d:0 "     Cloudet sat behind his desk of fine wood and relaxed. He considered calling for a glass of wine or some other alcohol, but his dietitian insisted he had been drinking too much as of late, and besides, the decision ahead was sure to be a significant one. Even now he could faintly feel the weight on his brain and in his bones of that month spent traveling, and his job left him little time to let the tension work itself out. There were a dizzying array of ideas he had encountered on his journey, but he had sat on what he had heard for many weeks, and he now felt he had enough of a grasp of Republican politics to know what role it ought to play in his own nation.\n     Political technologies had turned so devilishly complicated in the universities. He had had no clue that Republicanism had so many wildly different sects split along lines of how to vote, to say nothing of for whom to vote and why. Rattling in his skull were democratic structures that were proven, unproven, were being tested, had worked centuries ago, and might work centuries hence. Back when Cloudet was growing up, and he was simply Ostrick, son of Governor Corbin, all you needed to know was that Republicanism would free you and/or let you rob your landlord. Not only was there so much more, but it was imperative that the solution be tailored to the population's willingness to learn the intricacies thereof.\n     He pulled a pen and set the tip against a piece of paper. He carefully scrawled out the boilerplate introduction to a new decree. As the “owner” of his entire nation, innumerable important leading positions were effectively his employees. A good place to start introducing true Republicanism was to have them be appointed by the public rather than his own household.

greifwald.46.t:0 "Meeting of the Minds"
greifwald.46.d:0 "     On one side of the old courthouse were dozens of priests, and at the head of their end of the table sat Archon Erion attempting to look imperial in the building despite how rustic and small it was. On the other end of the table, flanked by his advisors, was Count Cloudet, who was no more at ease, but not for the room. "My good Count, I must ask. Do you know what you are doing?" Erion opened. He had not explicitly said what this meeting was for, but Cloudet could guess.\n     "I am accepting your surrender, Father." Cloudet said.\n     Erion shook his head sadly. "No, I am pleading with you. You are destroying an ancient and holy empire with your actions. Surely, you can recognize that you are standing against Boreas's will."\n     Cloudet waited, and looked around the room. No one was laughing. Softly, he spoke. "Father, a few years ago Greifwald was a backwater warlord state split in two. We had little but ourselves and the teachings of Eyr. Now we are marching through the capital of the mighty Griffonian Empire. I do not pretend to know what Boreas's will is, or whether his gifts will remain where they are forever, but if he has placed his claws on the scales, he has not done it for you."\n     "Count Cloudet. I know you are not a holy griffon. Do not speak for the gods." The Archon asked, grimacing.\n     "Please, accept the ruling of fate gracefully, if not for the gods then for our soldiers. They are still dying." Cloudet begged.\n     "Do not speak for the gods! You know nothing of them!" The Archon demanded. The Count jumped back from the outburst before reaching into a briefcase and pulling out a battle map. He pointed at the Imperial positions as Erion watched. His face contorted into rage and his beak ground against itself. He stood up in his chair. "Why, you-" He began, waving a talon. "You, you... YOU..." As he balled his claws into a fist, a trickle of blood fell from his nose. He sat back down slowly and slumped forwards, drooling on the table." #we own griffenheim now?

greifwald.47.t:0 "The Next Emperor"
greifwald.47.d:0 "     In the opulent throne room of Griffenheim, a young child sat on his throne. Before him knelt many of the usual ministers and dignitaries, but also a visiting group of Greifwaldians who were settling into their new role as stewards of the palace. It was odd to the young bird that his Empire be conquered from underneath him, yet the conqueror still came to his mighty chair and bowed with reverence before the emperor. "I think you're supposed to be gloating." He mumbled to no one in particular.\n     "Emperor Grover, I harbor no ill will towards the Griffonian Empire." Count Cloudet began. Grover VI motioned and the leader rose. "I have merely done what I must as a fellow head of state to defend my people's freedom and independence from a rival power."\n     "What will happen to me?" The child asked.\n     Cloudet looked around. "We are still working it out." He admitted. "We did not expect to be in this position, in case you couldn't guess. We're trying to figure out how to manage the Empire to best maintain peace and stability in Greifwald. It's a process that will likely involve you, but we do not want to say anything definitive at this time."\n     "It's a process that won't involve the Archon, either, from what I hear." Grover commented.\n     "That is a different sort of issue." Cloudet nervously shifted on his claws. "On the name of my father, I swear that that was unintentional and I did not even realize it was possible. That being said, I hope that you will be less prone to solving problems with the bayonet.

greifwald.57.d:0 "The young emperor sat in his cell, flanked by guards and looking as dour as someone his age ever could. "It's today, isn't it?" He asked tiredly. "You're going to sacrifice me to Maar now."\n     "In a manner of speaking." Ebonwing smiled warmly. "None of us knew what to do with you, but Maar came to me in a dream and told me the way forwards, and it was good." The old griffon raked a talon from Grover's forehead down to the front of his beak with enough force to hurt but not enough to draw blood.\n     "Am I going to die or not?" Grover muttered dejectedly.\n     Archon Ebonwing chuckled. "Everyone dies, my son. But you, well, you just did... Jaspar Swingwing." Grover cocked his head at the old griffon and looked around the cell for hints. When he saw how his guards were looking at him, he looked about his own body and saw his coat of golden feathers turning pale green, a discoloration spreading from where Ebonwing had scraped him. The terror gave way to simple confusion and energy returned to his eyes. The new Archon continued. "Yes, Maar felt there was no purpose to an end with no beginning. And you had no beginning or end, you were a servant of your bloodline and your bloodline was a servant of Boreas and when your physical form died you would live on forever in the history books and monuments and in the legacy that Boreas and your bloodline gave you. You were born owing more and being owed more than any creature can comprehend. Now, Maar has claimed you as his own. Your life has begun. In thirty or forty years, the enchantment will fade, and we will find you, and then your life will end."\n     Grover's mind raced to try and grasp what was happening. "You're going to kill me in thirty years? What kind of nonsense is that?"\n     Ebonwing patted the youth on the head. "It's a gift. By tomorrow, you will be on the streets as your own creature, and you'll know how little time you have for you to waste as you create the life you want.""

Griffons whose talons were marked with needle spots would claw at the armed soldiers, not caring about the rifle pointed at their face. As they fell to the ground, the armed griffs noticed the strangest feature…a blacker-than-usual hue of blood dripping from their wounds.\n     The commander kicked open the door - into the orphanage which they were led to after a long trail of investigations. Armed with firearms and intent, they stormed the building as if it was full of hostiles, though there were only children and staff screaming as the burly soldiers stormed towards one in particular.  The child griffon was slender, with purple feathers and tired eyes. He screamed as he ran through the orphanage, but didn’t make it far as a griffon immediately tackled him.\n     “No! No! Leave me alone! Leave me alone!” Screamed the child as he started to claw with his talons at the soldier that tried to restrain him. The trooper shouted in pain as one lucky claw managed to swipe across his face, drawing blood. In retaliation, he felt no remorse as he balled his own talon into a fist, and smashed it right into the child’s beak, causing his black blood to splash onto his face.\n     The griffon immediately began screaming, recoiling as the blood of the suspect started to mix with his own. The commander was the last to arrive on site, where he saw his subordinate writhe and shout, first from pain... and then, rage.\n     “Idiot!” The commander screamed. “Take his gun away, now!” He barked out the order to his troops. The other armed griffons ran up to him, but his resistance was intense as he started to shove and punch his comrades away, then taking his gun…and pointing it at the group of terrified, cowering children and caretakers.\n     Only then, the black-blooded child pecked the mad griffon in his paw, distracting him…and allowing the commander to take the headshot with the pistol. Screams rang through the orphanage, including the young griffon who found himself covered in the red blood, which became black before their very eyes. As the commander approached, the child resisted. The commander was sure to be more careful, but the child continued to yell. “Stop! Don’t touch me! I’m cursed! I’m cursed, I’m--”\n     “Calm down! We’re here to help you, kid!” He shouted. Yet, the child shook his head, resisting as best he could. “We’ll cure you of this shit, just relax! Corporal, put the bag over his head and take him! HQ and their eggheads are gonna want to see this!”\n     The child kept crying and screaming, but refused to fight as he was dragged away. He knew well what could happen if his blood spread...

How could any Griffon of Boreas tolerate the crude pickaxes and shovels that were deconstructing the floors and walls of the ancient church? Even if this had revealed the strange stone door underneath the basement level, he could not remain calm when the mosaic of his God was defaced and ruined. They ventured deep into the vault, caring not for any artifact but the rolled up parchment that was found in a chained up box, quickly opened with the strike of a shovel.\n     “Is this it?” The commander asked the Maarite scholar, as he carefully passed away the dusty, coarse paper over to him. The scholar took careful note of the words written upon it, studying them closely. The commander knew that the screams of the priest indicated it was exactly what they were looking for.\n     “No, no!” The priest cried. “Why is it here!? Why did they bury it underneath this sacred place!?” He cried out. He tried to break away from the soldiers that held him, only to receive a swift butt of a rifle into his stomach.\n     “If you do not know what artifacts your temple holds, blasphemer…” The Maarite scholar murmured. “...Then this faith is not true to you. Yes, sir. These are the scrolls we’re looking for…Would you fancy to test them?”\n     “...Will it affect us?” Asked the commander, voice nearly drowning over the screams of the priest. \n     “...It’s a good thing we had placed Maar’s protective blessings upon ourselves before we came here, because I believe they may have already been activated.” Said the scholar, feeling the paper suddenly become warm. He had merely read the words to himself, and it was enough…The commander did not understand - not until the terrible sound of crashing was heard above. The soldiers promptly ran up the basement stairs…To see that in addition to the destruction they had already caused, more was being added. A brick was thrown through the stained glass, and it allowed the angered shouts of the mob to be heard. They ventured onto the streets…Where the once peaceful village had turned into hell in a manner of minutes, as villagers shouted bloody fury, fighting among themselves and the town itself. Windows were being broken, fistfights were breaking out, and anarchy reigned within sheer minutes.\n     “We got what we came for. Turn your safeties off and return to the transport.” The commander said. The priest was let go - and so he stood by himself in the church he loved so much…It didn’t take long before, with a cry of sheer fury and rage, he approached a statue that honored Boreas, and with incredible strength, toppled it - taking with it the candlesticks which spilled the hateful flames upon the carpet. The church was engulfed with flames, and the mad screams of the once-tranquil, once-pious Father." #we found revolutionary fervor

And the beast, with its tearing jaws idle, reclined on top of her building, and she felt a great terror. "What is that creature?" She cried.\n     Her friend who was there was Marionne Sterngauer and she said, "I heard the priest saying that these things are normal now."\n     "It's a Boreas-damned giant centipede!" Gertrude exclaimed as she motioned towards the great creature. "Why is it on my building?"\n     "I think it was always on your building. We just never saw it before." Marionne replied, thinking back to her recent church services. "Or that's what they told us, at least."\n     And Gertrude looked up at the behemoth that crawled along the ground and asked, "Well, can we get it off?", and Marionne shrugged, for she did not know. Yet Gertrude had heard her friend's words and knew them to be true. As the abyssal thing stretched out its neck and scraped its jaws, shaped as the crescent moon and as long as a griffon is tall, against the brick wall, Gertrude cautiously walked around its mass and entered her place of work, and Marionne passed her by to go to her own place of work." #why is there a giant horror on that building? has it always been there? oh, it has? huh...

Inside the bed, Count Cloudet himself laid, sickly and withered, feathers discoloring. He smiled weakly. "This is familiar to you, isn't it?" He joked, but none laughed. Some years ago, a plague had claimed Ostrick de Cloudet's father and mother in a similar manner, and Ebonwing had been there for them too, although he was not a Prelate at that time. His predecessor was being taken by that same outbreak then.\n     "There are other times I would rather re-live." Ebonwing replied. "Have you thought about what I always said?"\n     Cloudet stared at the ceiling in the bedroom, the opulence hidden by the curtains drawn to avoid disturbing the monarch's now-sensitive eyes. Had he not seen it before, that this was the work of a fortnight would shock him. "This can't be what it was all leading up to. Looking back, I can't find anywhere I could have found the time to do the things I wish I had done."\n     "And if you had, what would you have done?" The priest asked.\n     Cloudet waved in the air dully. "Spent more time with my friends, I think. Maybe found a wife. But I can't bear to trade the long nights spent trying to do right by my country."\n     In his talons, Ebonwing's own soon grasped. "What a tragedy. A monarch who gave up his own happiness for his subjects and never regretted it, taken too soon. I'm sure actors will fight over who gets to play you on stage."\n     At that, Cloudet did laugh, despite his condition. "You're taking this well, old friend."\n     "I've done it before."

It was good that he was no longer a young griffon, for otherwise he would have left scars in the furnishings where he raked his claws against them. For many decades he had listened to the woes and triumphs of others and his heart had been hardened, and he had begun to fear that he could no longer feel with the energy he had once upon a time, but no longer. He regretted his past wishes, and although he knew that such pains were simply the flipside of the great joys which were also bestowed, in this moment he wanted nothing more than to go back to feeling little.\n     The Count would die soon. The doctors thought it was merely probable, but Ebonwing had a special connection with those who determined these matters, and he had been told that the Count was near the end of his life. Ostrick had done nothing to deserve the end he was receiving except to fail to conform to a plan he was never to be told about, and for the first time in Prelate Ebonwing's entire life, he cursed his heavenly patron.\n     It was only for a moment, but he cursed, and he hated, and he looked at the porcelain figurine on his end table and considered throwing it with all his might that it may be smashed against the wall. Then he realized his error and threw himself to the ground, prostrating and apologizing. Yet when he looked up, he felt the gaze of that small icon, and he heard the words, and they said that to love or hate of the way of heaven was irrelevant, and that to follow regardless was the thing which should be chased with all one's soul.\n     Thus, Ebonwing sat on his bed, head slumped into his claws, and he cried for the things he could not change." #f you, dad!

The other one, a younger priestess, chuckled softly. The two had been going at it for over an hour and Lazare had long since decided that minimum wage was too little pay for him to get involved. When he had asked to be the new night shift fry cook at DiscretBurger’s, he had been hoping to avoid the terrible customers. At least the late hours had hardly any normal business, so there was no one to be driven away by the spectacle.\n     The priestess nodded piteously as she paced the dining area. She spoke in a sing-song rhythm. “Hmph! You’re embarrassing yourself. Only the stupid are so obsessed with knowledge. Maybe you should try a spirit board? That seems more your level... altar boy.” The older priest leapt to the side, but the priestess flicked her wrist and a gnarled stick appeared in her talons. A brief flash of light leapt from the tip and chains appeared from the table the priest had landed on and lashed him to the top. His own wand rolled across the ground. “See?” She continued. “Doddering geriatrics like you are all the same. Slow to think, slow to react. Not a drop of imagination. Get crushed to death and stop taking up the next generation’s air.”\n     The priest had hate in his eyes as he was twisted and strangled by the chains that continued to wrap around him. “Burn.” He commanded. The room flashed and Lazare fell backwards, his polo shirt and feathers blackened at the edge by the heat. When he stood up, his beak dropped open at the shreds of burning napkins dancing through the air, and at the dark scar on the tile floor. The priestess was a crumpled and lifeless heap in a crater her body had put into the fountain drink machine, soda washing over her burning robes.\n     Lazare nervously looked at the clock.

The banning of electricity, the ritual execution of her precious Badouin, something would happen that would set her off. It’s not like the horrid demons wandering the countryside were on the government’s side in any meaningful way.\n     Then the priestly class did something that threw a wrench in her ideas.

One day, she had taken stock of the symptoms and remembered an important talk she had had with her mother some years ago.

Morgan asked, slumping over into a chair that was far too large for such a small creature.\n     "Why do we need to release everyone?" Chouchoute interrogated. "Yeah, Erika is good at cleaning up messes, but most of the griffons in that prison aren't professionals. They're just thugs. Falcontown will be in chaos for weeks. That's not good for business.

There was a rumor spreading that Morgan had gotten his mother killed and forged her will to take over the Community. It was a terrible rumor, and not just because the latter part was true. "Do not talk about my mother that way." Morgan said, trying to cover up the tremble of anger and sorrow.\n     Chouchoute paused. "I'm sorry, Baroni."\n     "That's fine." Morgan replied.

Franc wished he had peace while making the gun...But soon, the grey griffon placed a talon on his shoulder. "You and I, Franc we are one in the same - we both want to live worthy lives. And as long as you and I are confined to these padded walls, our time rots. But now, time is ripe. After all - there is a light at the end of every tunnel."\n     "...Whatever you say, Zoran..." Sighed Franc. He just hoped...this would work.\n     ***\n     The guard screamed moments before his head exploded - for Zoran's makeshift shotgun made easy work of him. "Beyond these walls, freedom awaits us!" He cried out. The patients ran through the halls, and Zoran happily passed the rustic pipes - firearms made from garbage - to the angry uprisers. "Now show this scum - that no padding, no cells, no beatings can keep us down! Chaaaargeee!"\n     Franc followed, watching in terror as his creations, pieced from scraps, were killing guards by the dozen. As he ran outside with the makeshift pistol in his talons...He looked around himself. Maybe it was all for freedom, but he had made tools used for death today, and many of the asylum's inmates did belong here. The shock never wore off. Not when days later, Franc found himself among bandits. Zoran had rallied them to the life of banditry, and Franc had nowhere else to go. The prisoners were never meant to live any life. What was there - when they lived in a country like this?" #franc has become a bandit after a breakout from the institution

After all, he'd be paid more with more confirmed kills.\n     "Fantastic work, Franc!" Zoran cried out, laughing heartily. "Truly brilliant! What witchcraft have you placed upon our guns? They've never worked better!"\n     "I just... re-rifled the barrels." Franc muttered over the sound of a distant schizophrenic's agony, not sure if it was from within or without the poor soul's mind. Their weapons were in a sorry state, tethering between makeshift and too old. But he made it work - haphazardly improving the quality of the firearms. He knew this only enabled Morgan's cronies. After all, the griffons he fought alongside, once proud "independent" bandits, were given a choice. Join, or be hunted down.\n     "Let us move on!" Zoran exclaimed. "We've more outposts to weed out! Morgan's promised double, if he's honest this time!"\n     Franc knew all of this was just enabling suffering. He knew the griffons who made them fight were currently torturing prisoners, brutally and without remorse. He knew that his siblings-in-arms were waiting their turn. Sometime ago, Franc hoped he'd make amazing strides in engineering. To help lives. Improve the world.\n     Now, he realized he was just one of "them". Those who ruined the little this land had left. All he could do now was clutch his rifle as he looked up at the cloudy skies, hoping they'd clear so he'd see some sunshine. He only had one ambition at the moment. Get enough money to die peacefully - and definitely die outside of this wretched land...And he certainly could hope - because in the end - there was a light at the end of every tunnel.

The griffon turned his head away from the phone to look at another officer in the room. "Whazuuup girl - how did the tank newbies do?"\n     The officer in charge of tank training rocked back and forth on the floor, nostrils bleeding and pupils narrowed, powder all over her beak. "Crazy? I was crazy once...They put me in a room...A rubber room...A rubber room with--"\n     The griffon on the phone frowned. "Damn they got you the bad stuff, huh? O-oh, Baroni! Uh, yeah - she said they passed with flyin' colors, Baroni! I saw 'em in action, scary stuff! Oh, the assault brigade's training? Lemme check, Baroni!"\n     The griffon decided not to comment much, as the masculine and gruff leader of the assault brigade was currently giving a lap dance to a fire extinguisher. Baked but resourceful, the griffon instead took a peek at his reports. "All good Baroni! They takin' training objectives like hours earlier than before! So yea, it's all good here, Baroni!...Yep, thanks dad--uh, B-Baroni! Uhm, what we need? Can we uh, get a snack airdrop? N-No? O-Okay...Yes, Baroni! I'll be here!\n     The griffon let out a sigh of relief, leaning back in his chair. "That was a close call. But you couldn't tell I'm on the lettuce, especially not over the phone. Eh, Captain?" Laughed the officer, nudging the griffon who sat on the chair by his side, who had already died from overdose last night." #everyone's too busy being high to work but at least our soldiers are better

Public services are frozen, why should the doctors get out of bed after they'd used up the clinic's morphine supply?\n     The chemists and drug cultivators enjoy their status as essential workers, revered by the once productive citizens who were reduced to no-life junkies. Even those relatively sober enjoy the occasional smoke or powder. Sobriety in of itself has become a fable.\n     Perhaps when all this started, the griffons of Greifwald enjoyed the brief vigor from the narcotics. Any soldier became a killing machine with methamphetamine. Any actress became a star with cocaine. Any writer became a genius with sativa. In the end however, when all colors are mixed, the result is a muddy brown. Overindulgence, addiction, and tolerance have plagued Greifwald.\n     Many close their eyes and hope to wake up in Wonderland. Perhaps those who do not open them reach it, after all.\n     Morgan looked out the window and smiled. Greifwald was free to do what it wanted, who was he to deny them the right?

For if your name was on the board, it spelled your doom. Proscription, it was called. Morgan was inspired by this idea, something he heard of in ancient history. According to the will of the regional council, the name of a criminal - for various crimes - would be posted on this board. With that, any citizen no matter of status has the fully legitimate right to kill the owner of this name. Their reward? Before the council requisitions and redistributes the dissident's things, half goes to the killer. No questions asked. Kill a scumbag, get half.

It’s just what you said. The source of generations of oppression. No amount of red paint can hide that it’s a monument to greed, to vanity, to intellectual opium delivered en masse to the proletariat. The new era has no need of such vulgar displays of superiority. So we’ll destroy it.”\n     Murmurs rose. To some, the annihilation of such wealth was simply another sort of unthinkable excess in the name of power. But to others, there was no stronger symbol of not just triumph, but social progress. Of a future free of oppression.

The twin-engine plane sat in the distance as it reared to take flight again. Not a second after the stairs hit the asphalt, the newest gift from Equus stood exposed to the air. Ruby eyes surveyed the woods surrounding the small airport and found it beneath the officer as he walked down. He only saw what he needed to to keep moving towards Cloudet. As tall as the noblegriff yet far more slender, the bug’s face showed that his mind was in another world entirely, no, not IN one, FROM one. This reality held no interest to him, not a noblegriff, not the fat and overloaded porter struggling behind him, not the pilot or any living thing. Cloudet wondered if the rumors about Chrysalis's 'Great Red Dragon' were true.\n      “Welcome to Greifwald, Sir Trimmel.” Cloudet held a talon out. The changeling looked at him, at his talons, and walked past.\n     “Hey! Hey, he’s talking to us!” The panting porter ran behind, shouting over the whine of the engines. He stuffed an empty bag of peanuts into a pocket and shakily jammed his hoof into Cloudet’s palm. “My apologies, this is my comrade, General Vect. I’m the Sir Trimmel. At your service.” Trimmel attempted to bow without collapsing under the weight. He was a noticeably shorter creature than his companion, but the Count cocked his head at how a creature could be so wide, and also could carry his own weight in cargo, and also also could be a great nation’s highest military official at the same time.\n     Cloudet composed himself. “I am charmed to meet you, Hivesmarschall. And you too, General.” Vect tipped his hat at the appreciation. “My apologies, though. I saw you with all that luggage and assumed you were a porter.”\n     Trimmel beamed. “The soldiers love a leader who can do what he asks them to. Herr Vect just has a different style.

The royal dietician insists that alcohol is only good as medicine and I don’t know enough to contest him on that.”\n     “I just think it’s risky.” Trimmel admitted.\n     Cloudet leaned back. “Hm. Well, this meeting isn’t about anything you should worry about. I just wanted to see how you felt about the place now that you’ve worked here for a while. You confuse the general staff. You have no vices besides overeating.”\n     Trimmel took a deep breath. “Well, my accommodations are a downgrade. So is my authority. I won’t complain, though, losing a war isn’t supposed to be good for your career. I’ll get some victories and be back to where I was. This is a quaint little country, I’m not sure I’ll ever get used to it. As for my real vice, well, if you can believe it, it’s snuff.”\n     “Really?” Cloudet raised an eyebrow. “Isn’t that low-class, even for you?”\n     “Oh, not at all!” Trimmel replied energetically. “The few who shared my interest were all officers and politicians. Why, there were persistent rumors that certain Equestrian nobility partook. It can be devilishly expensive, as well, if you want quality. There were no good sources in the Changeling Lands, I had to go all the way to Tall Tale for a supplier who could meet my standards. Even then, he had to shutter after an incident, which was bizarre and somehow completely unrelated to his work, but it claimed the life of his lead actre-”\n     Cloudet held up his talon to stop the flood of information. “I already know that it’s not for me.”\n     “I figured as much.” Trimmel said. “Well, now that I’ve looked around, I have some ideas for the armed forces.

He ascended the steps to the throne while the Count and his fellows were distracted by discussion and stood before the young Emperor. "Hey, Little Kaiser." He began. "We meet again, only this time, for the first time. You know, Herr Synovial made you sound a lot smaller."\n     The little bird shifted. Normally, the Emperor is not addressed with 'Hey'.

I would like to promote some of them into high ranks in our military organization.”\n     “Not unreasonable,” Cloudet admitted, “But you know you don’t normally need to come to me directly about it.”\n     “You are correct. The Greifwaldian general staff is concerned about the amount of changelings I have recommended, which I do not blame them for. The other issue…” He sucked in through his teeth. “I hate to admit it, but these ones fled to escape justice for crimes I believe they truly did commit. That they have lost their homeland, their property, their dignity, and in many cases, their families, is punishment enough as far as I am concerned. However, I also believe that, if given the proper guidance and structure that they lacked under Chrysalis, they would not repeat their past mistakes.”\n     “Queen Chrysalis.” Cloudet corrected him.\n     “No, just Chrysalis.” Trimmel corrected back. “The one who deserved the title only existed in propaganda leaflets and on street corners. What the one on the throne deserved was a good stoning, and I’m not talking about the Elements of Harmony.” He laughed at the idea. The Count chuckled along politely, but he didn’t have Trimmel’s strange sense of humor. “Whatever the case, I felt this was something you should be warned about before I go ahead with it. I am willing to take full responsibility for any plundering or massacre that you find out of order.”\n     The Count rubbed his eyes. “That’s fine, and you may go ahead with it, but it does make me worry. I suppose I should have known that not every changeling would be unduly maligned. War brings out the worst of every society.

Count Cloudet had not known many socialists, but he had known a few, and as a national leader, he had different information than the commoners. What socialist states did exist were always of two faces, one of a perfect society with enough asterisks to crush a griffon to death, and one of simple delusion. It was a nice idea that reality couldn’t handle.\n     Rumors had long circulated that the new Marshall’s close acquaintance, one General Vect, had sympathies for socialist causes. His allies certainly didn’t and so Cloudet didn’t worry about it. Then Vect had done something unexpected; he came to Cloudet and asked for a favor.\n     The Count looked over the small sheaf of papers as Vect waited expectantly. Cloudet wondered what the changeling equivalent of a talons-up was, because Trimmel must have been doing it just beyond the door to encourage his ever-hesitant friend. Well, the plan was very “Vect” for lack of a better word. He wanted to run an experiment. Greifwald would take a state (Aiwle was the natural choice), give it some separation from the rest of the new empire, remove the old rulers, and replace it with a system of workers’ cooperatives. No terrorists, no international sanctions, just a few years to see if a poor state could be improved through an ultra-modern political philosophy. With the rest of the empire to serve as a safety net and an easy route back to normal governance, it couldn’t even implode the way so many revolutionary states had done before. Yet failure would still mean impoverishment.\n     Cloudet rubbed his temples. He was an emperor now. There was the means and even the expectation that he would spend big on vanity projects. He had no love of grand palaces or exotic metals. This idea, though, would prove something important no matter what happened. He grabbed his pen." #socialist state part 1

greifwald.117.t:0 "YEAR 3 REPORT"
greifwald.117.d:0 "     The Aiwle experiment has run for three years now, and it is not yet done bearing fruit, nor has its progress gone un-monitored. However, there have been many interesting developments, and it is my belief that now is a good time to explain what has happened ever since this began.\n     The good news: Economic efficiency is up, and higher levels of social cohesion and job satisfaction are consistently reported. Wealth inequality has shrunk dramatically. Most importantly, the average Griffon feels far less alienated from their society than before and increasingly strives to be an active participant in the political process.\n     That last point is also the source of much of the bad news. Consider the peasant class who, liberated from the whips of their landlords, have not become a model proletariat. Instead they simply left many of their fields fallow, growing enough to sustain their own communities and little else. The cities complained, so the patriarchs and matriarchs of the villages attempted to rope entire regions into, essentially, agricultural unions to maintain and abuse a monopoly on crops. A famine was only averted with dozens of arrests. This naked self-interest is only unusual in its scope, and tension exists constantly between state quotas and workers, between managers and their auditors across the hall, and between new technocrat-dictators and leadership realities. Efficiency is up, but output is down everywhere.\n     The theory for this is that, unlike a socialist revolution, there was no preexisting meritocratic structure that replaced the government. The top of society was simply removed. When given control over the means of production, the workers do with it what the barons and the crony capitalists did before – be petty and selfish, except now it’s a self-serving group rather than a self-serving individual.\n     This has itself a silver lining, though. Unlike most, this socialist state is obviously not run by terrorists and brigands." #socialist state part 2
greifwald.117.a:0 "Uh-oh"

greifwald.118.t:0 "YEAR 6 REPORT - END"
greifwald.118.d:0 "     The socialist experiment in Aiwle continued and, given more time, did not resolve its fundamental issues, merely learned to mitigate them while uncovering new ones. Increasingly, cooperatives competing for the system’s limited resources have turned to graft and nepotism to get ahead of their partner cooperatives, occasionally veering into outright crimes. Internal audits have been less reliable every passing year due to upper managers being bureaucratic cousins to state auditors. The technocrat overseers of the cooperatives have finally settled into their role properly, but in many cases this was enabled not by practice, but by cooperatives forming a parallel bureaucracy with a mandate to ignore all but the most unified workplace democracy as they dispassionately push through competent managers instead of ideological firebrands or eloquent idealists.\n     The most visible problem remains the rural/urban divide, which broke into protests, then counter-protests, and then riots and counter-riots as the farmers battled for the freedom to tend their farms with no regard to the food needs of the state. The barons were at least afraid enough of rebellion to limit their squabbles between each other, but the baron-collectives are of the masses, and the masses do not fear rebellion. While the Sterdamm killings of four councilors once shocked the nation for months, there have been five farmer’s riots in south Aiwle with at least as many fatalities. A few murders are also suspected to be assassinations related to cooperative politics.\n     Every economic and social issue makes prices and availability for commodities more unstable than they already are, and thus encourages theft and corruption to get ahead of the broken system, thus exacerbating the economic and social issues. Given time, Aiwle is unlikely to right itself. Any future experiments would be better off getting a fresh start, and although I will regret the termination of this program, it is the right choice." #socialist state part 3

A breeze ruffled Cloudet’s feathers as he took a minute to remember his childhood, when it was so much smaller. He felt a pang of mourning for the past, the homeland that no creature can ever return to. He turned and saw his houseguest, Marhsall-General Trimmel. That creature had no need for abstract loss – practical realities were so much harder to accept than the laws of physics, yet were hardly more movable.\n    War was a terrible thing.\n    “What do the changelings think of me?” The Count broke the silence.\n    Trimmel breathed in heavily. “They despise you, Count. They think you’re weak because you speak softly and don’t make hasty decisions. They want a leader who could snap your wing and throw you from this balcony, consequences be damned. To be brutally honest, if I didn’t fill that role on your behalf, they probably would have overthrown you. I don’t know what made you think it was a good idea to invite so many of us over, you’re lucky it wasn’t your undoing.”\n    “You have a high opinion of your fellows.” Cloudet mused.\n    Trimmel looked him dead in the eyes. “Cloudet, every bad thing you’ve ever heard about them is true.”\n    Cloudet scratched his beak. “Nice try, but I remember the Revolution and the secession of Adelart. I know for a fact that, of the comically, senselessly evil things the changeling upper ranks were said to have done, at most one percent happened, and with many asterisks. The things I’ve heard about you alone were shockingly absurd, and I say that as a bird who’s closest friend was once accused of smothering multiple children to death.”\n    Trimmel laughed, and laughed hard. “You are so naive! But don’t be confused, that’s a compliment. I think if more creatures thought like you, there’d be fewer reasons for creatures to think like me.”" #you're safe

greifwald.121.d:0 "    As leader, public relations work was never far away. The creatures of Greifwald all wanted to feel like Count Cloudet was looking out for them personally, and that meant not only the rich and the poor, the educated and the illiterate, the urban and the rural, but every once in a while, the Count was to break bread with the land’s newest minority – the changelings. It helped them to accept him as their new monarch, and the Greifwaldian griffons to accept them as their new co-nationals.\n    Normally, this came with a Griffonian flair to keep the new arrivals from feeling like they could be Changeling nationals abroad. Yet Trimmel had insisted on one piece of home being allowed to come with them, and on being seen with the Count as they experienced it for the cameras. It was odd since, normally, the Marshall-General normally let interviews and press releases do the heavy lifting.\n    Cloudet had once been impressed (terrified, even) by Trimmel effortlessly lifting his own body weight in lead bricks despite being so pudgy. “All warfare is based on deception”, the changeling had said wryly. He now saw something even more frightful, the other side of how such an active creature could be that fat. The Count took a hesitant bite of the titular food behind Chrysalis Fried Chicken and found it still bitter with salt and wet with grease, and was still unable to ignore the loud chewing and spatters of flesh as Trimmel snapped bones and tore apart a family-size bucket of the breaded meat, his body a temple to gluttony and unrestraint.\n    “Ifn't thif houf-licking goud?” The bug asked before bothering to swallow.  Cloudet muttered something and Trimmel chose to hear it as agreement. “Ah, yeah. Your royal dietician is a smart fellow but never enjoying yourself buys you so few days it might as well be a rounding error. Luckily, this is official business. DON'T say I never gave you anything.”\n    Cloudet felt like one more bite would cause him to have a heart attack." #hello, cloudet. i love you :)

Alas, when it became indisputable that Chrysalis was not who I was promised, I waited for someone else to pick up the torch for me when I should have taken it and given it to the right creature. So someone else picked her successor for me. What a disaster that was!” Trimmel rambled on about his life story. Cloudet was becoming uncomfortable. This trip wasn’t supposed to involve Trimmel. In fact, Trimmel wasn’t supposed to be in town at all, he was supposed to be overseeing the Aquileia Branch. And this drive was supposed to take ten minutes, not forty-five. And he really was worried about reports of fake orders being given in his name. Trimmel continued. “A good leader is harsh, but fair. They keep you on the right track, they say no to things that go against the overall objective. In a country, the overall objective is the soul of an entire people so it must be watched carefully. I’m not waiting for someone else to make the first move this time. If a leader must be replaced, then let it be so. I’ll work out the details later.”\n    “Trimmel, I’m a bit concerned by the direction this conversation is taking,” Cloudet interjected. Outside, the limousine was on a random side road now.\n    Trimmel stared at him dully, then rubbed his eyes as if he had suddenly become exhausted. “Sir, the time to be ‘a bit concerned’ was when I first arrived. The time to be scared was two months ago. Now is the time to be resigned.” The limousine slowly rolled to a stop.

We should set up large armouries and expand our heavy industry to make sure our soldiers have all the equipment they need."


AET_archonate_help:0 "Request the Help of the Prelate"
AET_archonate_help_desc:0 "In times of trouble like this griffons turn to their faith for strength. Our government has no opinion on this one way or the other, but the local Prelate, Ludwig Ebonwing, certainly does. He seems to be proposing many interesting economic and political ideas. Perhaps we should take advantage of this."
AET_knighly_order:0 "Invite the Knights of Arcturius"
AET_knighly_order_desc:0 "The Knights of Arcturius have long been seen as an honourable force for good with not a hint of corruption among their various chapters.

AET_boosted_special_forces:0 "The Greifwaldian Elite"

AET_militia_spam:0 "Mass Levies"
AET_militia_spam_desc:0 "The simple fact is that, in the trenches, even poor soldiers are better than no soldiers. In exchange for being able to lead them and to gain the glory and respect that that entails, the most influential Greifwaldians will be allowed to raise private armies for the temporary service of the state."
AET_foreign_advisors:0 "International Experience"
AET_foreign_advisors_desc:0 "One of Greifwald's most unique resources is its wide array of refugees and exiles, many of whom were rejected from their home countries for waging war against it.

AET_cash_injection:0 "Foreign Equipment"

AET_foreign_advisors_part_two_desc:0 "Not only are our exiles a diverse and well-travelled group, they have many distant friends and allies they can call upon to expand what they can do for our nation. We have no reason to believe they will do anything else when our defeat may mean they are brought back to the country they tried to destroy."
AET_paratroopers:0 "The Fallschirmjagers"
AET_paratroopers_desc:0 "To train a paratroper division only requires that you have access to planes with doors that can be opened in mid-air. To use them means being able to ignore Greifwald's universally poor roads and to strike anywhere in any neighboring nation at any time. This is why, even before the Greifwaldian Air Force became fully-fledged, we developed a deeply experienced airborne corps."
AET_artillery_buffs:0 "New-Generation Cannons"
AET_artillery_buffs_desc:0 "Artillery is the king of battle and in this day and age airplanes are the queen - airplanes which are defeated with other artillery. That it is so cheap to modernize means we have no excuse for lacking the state-of-the-art in cannons of all sorts."
AET_army_spirit:0 "The Greifwaldian National Army"

AET_integrated_forces_desc:0 "There are a myriad of creatures throughout Griffonia who, for one reason or another, slip through the cracks of the system and are deemed 'unfit for service' simply because no one knows what to do with them.

AET_free_heavy_tanks_desc:0 "It took a lot of scrounging, but we have managed to get hundreds and hundreds of heavy-class tanks that, with some work, some maintenance, and some creativity, can be the backbone of a new and devastating (if limited) force."
AET_total_cc_networks:0 "Total CC Networks"
AET_total_cc_networks_desc:0 "The battlefield is an unimaginably complex place, yet Greifwald is the land where every ounce of the continent's creativity and motivation has settled.

AET_air_1:0 "Hire New Pilots"

AET_maars_caars_one:0 "Cycles of Nature"
AET_maars_caars_one_desc:0 "It's simplistic to say that [Root.CurrentPatronDeity] is a deity of nature. The truth is that all things that move without moving and change without changing are theirs.

AET_navy_1:0 "Marry the Sea"

AET_escape:0 "A Blind Eye"
AET_escape_desc:0 "Many Changelings are still on the run, having to flee their homeland because of simple ideological differences. And indeed, many of these bugs could be highly useful to the Greifwaldian nation. We should seek to set up ways to make it easier for "oppressed" Changelings to seek asylum in Greifwald.

AET_army_leader:0 "Old Friends"
AET_army_leader_desc:0 "Following our great accommodation of the Changeling high command, even more former generals and soldiers have made their way to Greifwald in search of refuge.

AET_changeling_science:0 "Invite the Scientists"
AET_changeling_science_desc:0 "Many brilliant Changeling researchers were forced to leave their home, simply because of their political views.

AET_sturmgeschutz:0 "The Panzer Elite"
AET_sturmgeschutz_desc:0 "The Changeling soldiers who have come to us now number enough for us to constitute an entire Panzer Division!

AET_changeling_industrialists:0 "Invite the Entrepreneurs"
AET_changeling_industrialists_desc:0 "Many important Changeling entrepreneurs were forced to flee their home, but many managed to liquidate their assets, thus allowing them to retain most of their wealth.

AET_great_red_dragon:0 ""And Burn Again...""
AET_great_red_dragon_desc:0 "In truth, the moniker of 'Great Red Dragon' is entirely a Griffonian invention. Trimmel himself had never heard it until that fateful day on the tarmac.

AET_trimmel_end_1:0 ""Like Fires Do...""
AET_trimmel_end_1_desc:0 "The common changeling refugee in Greifwald is a productive member of society who, if they haven't already, is learning the local language and customs and the other things that make a good guest. It's the high-positioned changelings who make the decisions about what will happen next to the exiles, and specifically, the most conquerous one among them. Just as Chrysalis intended."

AET_trimmel_likes_cloudet_desc:0 "It seems that Marshal-General Trimmel has had his worse instincts significantly toned down by being around the good Count Cloudet. This transformation from bloodthirsty killer to mostly-normal citizen soldier has revealed that the Count truly is the father of his country, an example that all desire to imitate. That, or that the former Queen was an exceptionally poor influence."

AET_CLOUDET_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 19 Aug, 970 in Falcontown\n\n§YRank§!: Count of the Lands of Greifwald and the Good Creatures Therein\n\n§YBiography§!: Ostrick de Cloudet was the young son of an ambitious and devious provincial governor named Corbin and his equally ambitious wife. As he grew up, he witnessed the conditions that led to the Republican Revolution of 978, as well as the revolution itself, the aftermath, the crowning of his father as the Count of the province of Greifwald, the years of sectarian violence on either side of that event, the purges, the terror, the secession of Adelart and the failed attempts to bring it to heel, economic downturn, and finally, the deaths of his own two parents and much of his family by the plague in 1002. However, although his parents could be cruel and merciless, they were not small-minded despots, and they ensured that Ostrick de Cloudet would be shown uncountable perspectives from across the nation and the world in order for him to forge his own destiny when it became his time to rule.\nIt is truly remarkable that such good parents can come from such horrible creatures, although the new Count, despite how willing he is to break from their methods, would never say such a thing about them.\nAs a leader, he is moderate, restrained, open-minded, and soft-hearted, but he is also hesitant, fearful, light-handed, and soft-hearted.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Scroup"

AET_LUDWIG_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 1 Jan, 932 in Pulliers\n\n§YRank§!: High Priest of [Root.CurrentPatronDeity] in Consecrated Lands\n\n§YBiography§!: Although originally born to peasant farmers in an underdeveloped land, Ludwig Thierry Ebonwing turned out to be a precocious child and gained the attention of the head of the local church of Eyr. In those days, the church was the single road to education for the impoverished, and so the agnostic young griffon learned to be faithful in exchange for reading, writing, and all forms of knowledge. He wasn't deemed cut out for the priesthood, however, and became employed by the land's noble owners, who were particularly devout, and there his piety turned real. With a talon in every of Greifwald's social classes, he grew into a learned scholar, an excellent mediator, and passionate preacher.\nHe rejoined the church and, equally adept at resolving conflicts between verses and between griffons, became a beloved figure who swiftly rose through the ranks. Accusations of Maarite leanings and of noble interference slid off of him like water from a raincoat. His final superior in Greifwald's religious structure was claimed by the same plague that took much of the house of Cloudet, leaving Ludwig the highest priest in the land. A few years later, with no successors, a dying Count Ostrick de Cloudet placed his country into the talons of his lifelong friend and confidant, who has ruled it ever since.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Scroup"

AET_MORGAN_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 15 Mar, 987 in Pulliers\n\n§YRank§!: Baroni of the Amein Community\n\n§YBiography§!: Morgan Bernier was the bastard of a prostitute who walked the streets of Amein at night to pay the bills. She was not a freelancer, but acted under the umbrella of the largest local crime organization, the Amein Community. As Morgan grew up, the Community was also undergoing rapid expansion that created a host of new management positions that dear mother filled one after the other. Soon she was one of the trusted lieutenants of the then-Baroni. He retired and, her having defeated every new challenge in the last twenty years, she was named his replacement. Morgan watched as, year after year, stale bread was replaced with cake, the house became larger while the bug count became smaller, and trips to the library turned into weeklong vacations in places like Yale and Pridea.\nThen something odd happened a few years into her tenure. She died in a car accident, and despite the fact that the position of Baroni wasn't hereditary, her will stated that it should go to Morgan, barely-tested and barely even an adult. What's more, the Amein Community was a business, but Morgan wanted to use it as something grander. A movement, the center of a unified front to liberate the workers of the world. Now, that is what it has become - the role of Baroni is increasingly rarely-called-upon as anarchy sweeps the old order away.\nAnd anyone who questions it will meet either irresistable beauty or an angry mob.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: LittlePudel"

The second was the secret one, the nobility's own, the church of Maar. For the last five hundred years, these two organizations drifted closer and closer together until Ebonwing's ascension to the Archonate merged them completely. Eyr's church was little more than the publically-known version of Maar's, and thus was the one which was folded into the other. This meant that the Maarite prelate was the only remaining one, and thus, Aekold Helbrass, scion of the house of Amiens and lifelong devotee, became the second-highest priest in the land.\nHe might be a rampaging zealout harboring a multi-century grudge against the gods who destroyed his family's miniature empire, and he might be excessive in his prosecution of the disbelievers, but he is certainly good at getting the troops moving.\n§YPortrait By§!: Motley"

He has spent most of the last 350 thousand years wandering the continent, watching the progression of time and how his fellow beings shaped the landscape and the civilizations which grew up in it. Unlike many other natural forces, the Peripherie Westwind is calm before interacting with mortals and tempestuous over the ocean where no one can be harmed (Griffons were not meant to be sea-dwellers), and Barbas is accordingly sociable by demon standards. He is also associated with forgotten things and owns a portion of the domain of the cool evenings of Spring and Fall in which Griffons rest between bedtime and the day's work.\nHe has become a leader in the Greifwaldian Holy Army to learn more about the mortals he passes on his journey. With his knowledge of the once-known, he brings an important level of unpredictability to a nation normally known for having a strong orthodoxy in the officer corps. The fact that he's usually the size of a house has created some logistical challenges, but they are solvable.\n§YPortrait By§!: AnaStaFury"

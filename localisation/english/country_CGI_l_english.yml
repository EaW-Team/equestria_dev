CGI_diamond_road:0 "Diamond Road"
CGI_diamond_road_desc:0 "The diamond road is an ancient trade route connecting southern Zebrica with Zonicia. Besides the eponymous diamonds, other trade goods include gold, spices, textiles, and slaves. As the industrialisation progresses, manufactured goods also make up a larger and larger share of the trade. Our country profits from this trade route running through it, giving our government a healthy stipend and bringing new ideas into our nation."

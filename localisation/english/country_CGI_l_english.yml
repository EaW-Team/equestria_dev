### DECISIONS ###

CGI_the_diamond_road:0 "The $CGI_diamond_road$"
CGI_the_diamond_road_desc:0 "The so-called $CGI_diamond_road$ is an ancient trade route, running between south-eastern Zebrica and Zonicia, passing through Chisimbi, Camelkand and Quaggatai. Since time immemorial, the Quaggan trade zebras, in conjunction with the camels, have transported riches between the two sides of the continent, from gems – including the eponymous diamonds – to spices, gold, textiles and slaves. Since the industrialisation arrived, manufactured goods also make up a significant portion of the trade.\n\nAll of this trade leaves the government with a healthy stipend. With various investments, we might be able to increase our dividends, and in dire times we can confiscate what we need, although this would have long-term effects.\n\nCurrent Strength: §Y[?CGI.CGI_diamond_road_strength] points§!\n\nCurrently, our stipends from the $CGI_diamond_road$ are as follows:\n[CGI_diamond_road_civ_desc_dyn][CGI_diamond_road_mil_desc_dyn][CGI_diamond_road_manpower_desc_dyn][CGI_diamond_road_steel_desc_dyn][CGI_diamond_road_tungsten_desc_dyn][CGI_diamond_road_rubber_desc_dyn][CGI_diamond_road_gun_desc_dyn][CGI_diamond_road_arty_desc_dyn][CGI_diamond_road_support_desc_dyn][CGI_diamond_road_construction_desc_dyn][CGI_diamond_road_prod_eff_desc_dyn][CGI_diamond_road_trade_opinion_desc_dyn]"

### EVENTS ###

quaggatai.1.t:0 "The Khan"
quaggatai.1.d:0 "Khan Zaghu walked through the halls of the royal palace in Koltshgar. His grandmother, Khatun Malighu, had built it during shortly after she had been elected as khatun, as one of her first reforms. For the most part, it was a simple stone building. Only for the throne room, Malighu had bought expensive marble from Zonicia. Quaggatai wasn't a rich nation, and other investments had been more important.\n\nHe shook his head. For three hundred years, the Quagga had dominated northern Zebrica, and yet, there was little to show for it. They had collected tribute from all over Zonicia, but the every roaming clans had had little interest to invest their gains in marble and stone. And eventually, the hegemony had collapsed, and the Quagga had been banished back to the steppe. The world had moved on without them.\n\nOnly when his grandmother, Khatun Malighu, had united the Khanate once more, Quaggatai had embarked on the much needed journey for modernization. He remembered her fondly. His mother Ephighu had died during his birth, and so he had spent his foalhood with his grandmother. She had been resolute elderly mare, strong and determined, but the clans had opposed her efforts at any opportunity. She had died a little more than ten years ago, and the clans – despite some grumbles – had made him new Khan.\n\nIn these ten years, he had broadly continued her legacy. Cities like Koltshdar, Bucklan and Buckhara were growing, the ancient diamond road trade was thriving and slowly but surely the power of the clans gave way to a stronger central government. The storm king had been a nasty surprise, but ultimately almost useful... or at least as useful as a maniac looter was going to get. Luckily, he had vanished as quickly as he had arrived, and Zaghu's armies had managed to occupy Coltdar in the aftermath.\n\nKhan Zaghu finally made it to the throne room. It would be another busy day of ruling – consulting advisors, hearing petitions and preparing decrees. Quaggatai would need to modernize quickly. Coltdar had been a gamble, and this gamble would see its consequences sooner rather than later..."
quaggatai.1.a:0 "Those who fail to adapt will be swept away."

quaggatai.2.t:0 "The Prisoner"
quaggatai.2.d:0 "Farqeghu neighed in frustration and kicked out with his hind legs. There was a loud clank as his hooves hit the stone, but the walls of his cell didn't move. He kicked out a few more times, both with his front and hind legs to vent his frustration, until the guards came with hay and yogurt for his breakfast. They didn't even bat an eye over his antics. For a moment, he considered kicking these stooges in their stupid faces, but he knew all too well that it wouldn't improve his position.\n\nWith a sigh of resignation, he began slurping his yogurt. How could he have ever been so naïve as to think that Zaghu would be better than his grandmother? Malighu had vastly overstepped her role as Khatun often enough, but she had known limits. Her modernization efforts had infringed on the Quaggan way of life, but she had refrained from all to brazen meddling in the affairs of the other clans. It had been too much goodwill to elect her grandcolt as next Khan...\n\nDespite his initial reconciliatory efforts, Zaghu had soon proven to be even worse than Malighu. But that he would openly refuse to lead the Quagga clans against the Storm King! Not just that, but when the Torquai, Raltung and Muquarili stepped up to at least save the Quaggatai's honour, he betrayed them. In a shameful display of unending tyranny, Zaghu used the yeti garrison, tasked with "collecting tribute", to uproot the clan structure that had existed for thousands of years. Even more, he had taken Farqeghu prisoner, the clan leader of a fellow clan! And now, for almost a year, Farqeghu had been stuck here, while Zaghu could run rampant to dismantle the Quaggan way of life.\n\nBut this was not over! Surely, his loyal zebras already plotted to free him and overthrow the tyrant Khan. It was infuriating that the Khanate had not collapsed immediately under such unprecedented despotic behaviour from a Khan, but there had to be something... right? Farqeghu kicked out against the wall more time before, with another sigh, turning to eat his hay."
quaggatai.2.a:0 "For true Quagga, the clan comes first."

quaggatai.3.t:0 "The Buckharan"
quaggatai.3.d:0 "Eaghu put the letter beside her and stared into the fire. Ever since her sister married Zaghu and moved to the east, they had mostly communicated via mail. And since her brother-in-law had become Khan, even that had gotten sparse. Recently, she had written her again. And now Ohene had replied, with an almost five pages long letter. She twitched her ears, unsure on how to proceed.\n\nAll in all, the answer didn't satisfy her. Ohene had done little more than repeat the arguments that her husband used all the time – how Quaggatai needed to modernize, how it was necessary to embrace industrialization and that a stronger Khanate could guarantee the continued independence of the Quagga. This was not wrong, and Eaghu would have been perfectly fine if Zaghu would keep it at that.\n\nBut it was pretty clear to her that he wanted more. He wanted a proper monarchy, to guarantee his foals the right to succession and the continued dominance of the Maklai. Perhaps he also dreamed of conquests. The fact that he had occupied Coltdar in the aftermath of the Storm King certainly pointed in this direction. It was an open invitation to Colthage to declare war, and an even more welcome excuse for him to strengthen his position under the disguise of "mobilization". Was it true that war with Colthage was inevitable, who he – and now also her sister – claimed? It seemed far-fetched to her.\n\nWith the right moves, the Suniquai would earn a good place in the new state. Ohene surely would support that, she said so much in her letter. But was this the right move? Despite the influence of her sister, a stronger Khanate would mean more eastern dominance of Buckhara as well... An all-powerful Koltshgar felt like a step to much.\n\nShe twitched her ears again. The world didn't wait for the indecisive. If she acted now, she could make herself perhaps indispensable to the Khan. But was this really what she wanted?"
quaggatai.3.a:0 "In the end, we are all Quagga."

quaggatai.4.t:0 "The Caravaneer"
quaggatai.4.d:0 "Menuhe put the saddlebags down with a sigh of relief. It had been a long trip, from Zawara through Roam and Camelkand, but now they had made station in Zashi. It felt good to finally be on Quaggan soil again. It had been three years... Three years without seeing her foals. How much would they have grown? A lot, probably. Would Elohe still be so careless in combing her mane? Maybe Ranu had managed to civilize her... Ranu, her husband... How much she missed him! It would be one more month until the caravan would finally reach Koltshdar and she would be able to embrace him again. And her foals as well. She let her head hang low. One more month...\n\nStrange how times changed. When she grew up, she had always been part of her mother's caravan. In fact, she had not been born in Quaggatai at all, but in a small desert village in the middle of the camel lands. She had been with the caravan her whole foalhood, and never even a single moment would her mother thought of leaving her at home. They were trade zebras, and the little filly would just trot along with the caravan. At least they hadn't given her a saddlebag back then.\n\nAnd now? When she had married Ranu, he had first joined her caravan. But after she had born their first foal, he wanted to settle down. The city of Koltshdar had been growing rapidly at the time, and more and more jobs were available there. She had agreed to stay with him in Koltshdar as long as Elohe needed her milk, but she was a trader... She could not just settle down. Ranu had found good work, as a scribe for the growing palace bureaucracy, and so they parted. Not forever, never forever, but always for long.\n\nEven Quaggatai wasn't safe of modernity, it seemed. For her grandmother, the idea of a Quagga settling down would have been just preposterous. Well, grandma had always been a bit narrow-minded, condemning Malighu's reforms... but still. Koltshdar had now grown to be a true city, rivalling those in the north in Zonicia. Would all Quagga just become like the zebras in the north? Surely not – Quaggatai didn't have the farmland for that.\n\nWith one more sigh, she opened her saddlebags. Unpolished diamonds looked rather inconspicuous, but they would make a good price in Colthage. The caravan had bought a lot of goods in the south. Gems, gold, spices. In Roam they also had bought some slaves. Colthagian landowner would pay well for them. It was a long journey, time and time again, but it also sure was profitable..."
quaggatai.4.a:0 "And the caravan moves, restless, to keep the trade flowing."
quaggatai.4.a_tt:0 "The $CGI_diamond_road$ is an ancient trade route from southern Zebrica through Camelkand and Koltshdar to Zonicia.\n\nThe caravans passing through Quaggatai generate us a §Ghealthy profit§!, however, the benefits go beyond that - a strong $CGI_diamond_road$ can give us bonuses to §Ymodernization§! or §Yresearch§! as well as strenghening some focuses. We can also §Yexpoit§! the $CGI_diamond_road$ to gain short-term §Yresources§!, with the cost of §Rweakening§! future trade. As the §Ytrade zebras§! generally are in §Gfavour§! of a strong §YKhanate§!, §YKhan Zaghu§! might profit politically from a strong $CGI_diamond_road$."

quaggatai.5.t:0 "The Sole Republican"
quaggatai.5.d:0 "Telohe looked around in the room. It was rather shabby, with a few chairs, a bookshelf, a desk and a filing cabinet. All in all, it looked more like a book club rather than the head quarter of a political party. And if she was completely honest to herself, it probably wouldn't become more for a long time.\n\nShe sighed. When she founded the Quaggan Republican Movement five years ago, it had just been her. By now, she had a small group of friends, but it wasn't really a party by any metric – it really was little more literary coffee circle a fancy name. And even that name barely held together... Her friend Mohe, who served as the secretary, had argued multiple times that the Hippogriffs had made rather positive experiences with their monarchy. Telohe had answered that Quaggatai was missing the tradition of monarchical restraint that the Hippogriffs had. In the end, they had reached the compromise that they would accept a constitutional monarchy as an intermediate step towards Harmony. She shook her head. They really were a republican movement where half the members weren't even republican.\n\nA month ago, they had finally published their manifesto. And yesterday, she had received some mail from the government. At first, she had freaked out about it – as Khan Zaghu was not too gentle with dissidents – but the letter, to her complete surprise, had been rather positive. "In his efforts to strengthen Quaggatai's national identity, His Majesty has seen fit to support movements that promote a pan-Quaggan viewpoint." had the letter started. As a result, she now got a lump sum of Colthagian zhekels each month and also the room she was just standing in. It wouldn't be quite enough that she could give up her job and invest all her efforts into the movement, but it would help a great deal.\n\nAfter scratching her mane for a while, she decided that the first purchase from the new money would be some more comfortable club chairs to replace the wooden ones. She had seen a collection of old fauteuils at the market. And in the meeting next week, she would tell the others of their new income. Although, thinking about it, it was rather strange for a republican movement to get its funding from the monarchy it wanted to abolish..."
quaggatai.5.a:0 "Their ideas might seem outlandish, but they have their uses."

quaggatai.6.t:0 "The Heir"
quaggatai.6.d:0 "When Moghu trotted to his lectures this morning, he could barely hold his head straight. The cinder yesterday had not been a good idea. And neither had been the Macawian rum. But this had been yesterday. Today, he would need to learn about some intricacies of military logistics or similar nonsense. And if he wanted to avoid embarrassing himself before his sister, he would also need to not fall asleep. With how heavy his head felt, this was easier said than done.\n\nAlane was a little under two years younger than him and always organized, on time and frighteningly competent in every subject. He would have been very impressed, if it wouldn't be so annoying. He always felt so inadequate when talking to her. It would have been less of a problem if she had been older than him, but with him being the firstborn, this meant that he was the heir apparent. He had floated the idea with his father to make Alane the heir, but Zaghu had told him that his was not an option. The clans practised strict primogeniture, and he would just need to get his act together.\n\n"Hi Moghu!" The sudden voice of his sister made him jump a step to the side. "Have you remembered to write the essay on distributed supply networks?" He vaguely remembered that this had been a thing. At first, he wanted to flair his nostrils, but it would be of no avail – she would find out soon anyways. He slowly shook his head. "Thought so. Well, you still have around half an hour. Take this, but don't make it too obvious." She gave him some papers. It was her essay, for him to copy. That was perhaps the worst part – on top of all her qualities, she was also friendly and helpful. It only made him feel even more useless, especially because he knew very well that he didn't have a choice.\n\nAround twenty-five minutes later, he gave her the papers back. His essay wouldn't be as good as hers, but it would not have been fair to copy everything. His own ideas were lacking at best, and he knew it, but in total it would be enough to cover up that he had forgotten to write the essay in time. Why, by all things between Iszkarha's heavenly realm and Ilghunha's endless steppe, did he have to learn about distributed supply networks in the first place?"
quaggatai.6.a:0 "Let's hope he grows with his responsibilities."

quaggatai.7.t:0 "At The Crossroads"
quaggatai.7.d:0 ""Your plan seems risky." Ohene remarked.\n\nZaghu nodded slightly. The map before him showed the clans of Quaggatai, with figurines representing the various friends and enemies within each clan. "Things will come to a conclusion soon," he answered, "at the latest when Colthage moves." His muzzle scrunched when he looked to the top of the map. "They can't possibly ignore Coltdar forever. Until then the dominos must have fallen."\n\nHis wife stepped closer to the map. "Don't overtake yourself. The defeat of the Torquai and Muquarili has given you the upper hoof for now, but the clans are still strong. And they don't forget." She slightly tilted her head. "I have told you about the letter from my sister, right? She might be mostly loyal to your cause, but even she isn't free from doubts."\n\n"I know, I know." He stared intensely at the little figurine representing Eaghu, as if he tried to read her mind by proxy. "As long as she stays neutral... this is all I need. Farqeghu is secured in house arrest, and the Torquai are still licking their wounds. The Senar are our friends, and Opheghu knows very well that the Raltung have never forgiven them for seceding. But this is only one half of the equation anyways." He shuffled around some figures wearing saddlebags. "Here lies my real strength. The traders know that their future looks brighter in a unified Quaggan state. The cities as well. Times are changing."\n\n"But have they changed enough already?" Ohene asked. "And you might think you have masterfully outplayed the Storm King's armies against your opponents, but the cities remember the... tribute they had to pay. They haven't turned against you yet, but your submission to the Storm King came at a cost. Not that it was wrong." She sighed. "It would have been a folly to have everything we build so far destroyed. And yet, we have to tread carefully. I know you are ambitious, my Khan, but we need to secure our gains, slow and steady." She stretched her neck, trying to kiss him on his muzzle.\n\nZaghu didn't react, his eyes still locked on the map. "Quaggatai stands at the crossroads." he mumbled."
quaggatai.7.a:0 "The future in our hoofs."
quaggatai.7.a_tt:0 "As Quaggatai continues to §Gmodernize§!, §YKhan Zaghu§! and §Ythe clans§! are in a deadly powerstruggle for the §Yfuture of the Quaggan nation§!.\n\nOnce §RColthage attacks§! to reclaim §YColtdar§!, this tree will become §Runavailable§!. The future of our nation will then depend on the current value of the §Ybalance of power§!.\n"

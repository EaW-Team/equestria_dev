quaggatai.1.t:0 "The Caravaneer"
quaggatai.1.d:0 "Menuhe put the saddlebags down with a sigh of relief. It had been a long trip, from Zawara through Roam and Camelkand, but now they had made station in Zashi. It felt good to finally be on Quaggan soil again. It had been three years... Three years without seeing her foals. How much would they have grown? A lot, probably. Would Elohe still be so careless in combing her mane? Maybe Ranu had managed to civilize her... Ranu, her husband... How much she missed him! It would be one more month until the caravan would finally reach Koltshdar and she would be able to embrace him again. And her foals as well. She let her head hang low. One more month...\n\nStrange how times changed. When she grew up, she had always been part of her mother's caravan. In fact, she had not been born in Quaggatai at all, but in a small desert village in the middle of the camel lands. She had been with the caravan her whole foalhood, and never even a single moment would her mother thought of leaving her at home. They were trade zebras, and the little filly would just trot along with the caravan. At least they hadn't given her a saddlebag back then.\n\nAnd now? When she had married Ranu, he had first joined her caravan. But after she had born their first foal, he wanted to settle down. The city of Koltshdar had been growing rapidly at the time, and more and more jobs were available there. She had agreed to stay with him in Koltshdar as long as Elohe needed her milk, but she was a trader... She could not just settle down. Ranu had found good work, as a scribe for the growing palace bureaucracy, and so they parted. Not forever, never forever, but always for long.\n\nEven Quaggatai wasn't safe of modernity, it seemed. For her grandmother, the idea of a Quagga settling down would have been just preposterous. Well, grandma had always been a bit narrow-minded, condemning Malighu's reforms... but still. Koltshdar had now grown to be a true city, rivalling those in the north in Zonicia. Would all Quagga just become like the zebras in the north? Surely not – Quaggatai didn't have the farmland for that.\n\nWith one more sigh, she opened her saddlebags. Unpolished diamonds looked rather inconspicuous, but they would make a good price in Colthage. The caravan had bought a lot of goods in the south. Gems, gold, spices. In Roam they also had bought some slaves. Colthagian landowner would pay well for them. It was a long journey, time and time again, but it also sure was profitable..."
quaggatai.1.a:0 "And the caravan moves, restless, keeping the trade flowing."

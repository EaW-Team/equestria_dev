### FOCUS ###

## Starting Tree ##
CGI_the_battle_for_quaggatai:0 "The Battle For Quaggatai"
CGI_the_battle_for_quaggatai_desc:0 "The Storm King's empire has collapsed, but the true fight for Quaggatai has just begun. Khan Zaghu wants to continue his grandmother's legacy and centralize the state around himself, but the powerful clans oppose him at every opportunity. The battles of the coming years will shape the nation's future."

CGI_prepare_for_the_inevitable:0 "Prepare For The Inevitable"
CGI_prepare_for_the_inevitable_desc:0 "To the north stands [CTH.GetNameDef], our rival since time immemorial. For centuries, we thought to have them broken and subjugated under our rule, but in 825 ALB they rose up and drove us back to the steppes. Now, with the occupation of Coltdar in the aftermath of the Storm King's collapse, another war seems inevitable, thus preparations must be made."

CGI_strengthen_the_diamond_road:0 "Strengthen The Diamond Road"
CGI_strengthen_the_diamond_road_desc:0 "The diamond road is a valuable trade route flowing through our nation. Under the Storm King, it was thrown into disarray, but now the situation is improving again. As it is key to much of our nation's riches, we must protect and nurture it."

CGI_embracing_modernity:0 "Embracing Modernity"
CGI_embracing_modernity_desc:0 "It is undeniable that we have fallen behind our neighbours technologically, especially Colthage. Old craftszebraship is replaced with machinery, old wisdom with new science, and old swords and bows with firearms. We must adapt to not fall into obscurity."

CGI_dealing_with_the_clans:0 "Dealing With The Clans"
CGI_dealing_with_the_clans_desc:0 "Quaggan society has always relied on a strong clan system, with most Quagga holding more loyalty to their clan than the nation at large. Even after decades of state-building by Malighu and now Zaghu, the clans still hold many cards in their hooves. We need to play out ours carefully."

CGI_fortify_coltdar:0 "Fortify Coltdar"
CGI_fortify_coltdar_desc:0 "It is most likely that when war with our northern neighbours eventually breaks out, we will find ourselves on the back hoof for a while. Establishing well-placed fortifications can help us withstand the initial blow."

CGI_reinforce_karmanedgan:0 "Reinforce Karmanedgan"
CGI_reinforce_karmanedgan_desc:0 "Khan Zaghu ordered the occupation of Coltdar under the pretence of protecting its local Quagga population, but truth be told, for the majority of locals, we are just foreign occupiers. We must increase our presence in the region to keep it stable and reduce future troubles."

CGI_opportunities_in_zonicia:0 "Opportunities In Zonicia"
CGI_opportunities_in_zonicia_desc:0 "Colthage might be our rival in political terms, but we still have a flourishing trade relationship through the Diamond Road. To further bolster our trade, perhaps it is possible to make some mutually beneficial agreements – or alternatively, we could look for some other interested buyers."

CGI_patrol_the_caravan_ways:0 "Patrol The Caravan Ways"
CGI_patrol_the_caravan_ways_desc:0 "The steppe is vast, and the clans are always at odds with each other and the central government. Caravans can often find themselves in the middle of these complex struggles, leading to dangers or detours. By patrolling frequently used caravan ways, we can alleviate these issues and bolster trade."

CGI_workshops_to_factories:0 "Workshops To Factories"
CGI_workshops_to_factories_desc:0 "So far, Quaggatai has little industry to speak of, with the few factories restricted to the major cities. Much of our production still happens in small workshops, unchanged from centuries ago. Some government programs are needed to kickstart our development."

CGI_rebuild_the_economy:0 "Rebuild The Economy"
CGI_rebuild_the_economy_desc:0 "With Khan Zaghu realising early on that resisting the Storm King would be infeasible, we have suffered less under him than most of our neighbours. And yet, his harsh demands for tribute – some would call it looting – have caused much hardship and an economic downturn. We need to focus on rebuilding what was lost."

CGI_the_urban_clan_question:0 "The Urban Clan Question"
CGI_the_urban_clan_question_desc:0 "The emergence of cities is a relatively new phenomenon for Quaggatai. But in recent decades, urbanisation has come to us as well: slowly at first, but by now the urban zebras are able – and willing – to shake up the traditional political order. With clever politicking, we could take advantage of this shift."

CGI_friends_in_the_north:0 "Friends In The North"
CGI_friends_in_the_north_desc:0 "When the Senar clan broke off from the Raltung clan in the chaos following Khan Atanghu's death, the Maklai came to their aid and supported their place as the fifth eastern clan. Opheghu, their current clan leader, was crucial to secure Khan Zaghu's election and continues to be a friend and ally of his. We need to reinforce this alliance."

CGI_the_bucklan_redoubt:0 "The Bucklan Redoubt"
CGI_the_bucklan_redoubt_desc:0 "If we want to prepare fully for a war with Colthage, we have to consider the possibility that our lines might be broken and we have to retreat. In this case, the Bagraza River forms a natural defensive position. Some extra investments into a fort line – quickly dubbed the Bucklan Redoubt by our military planners – could enable us to effectively resist the Colthagians for a long time."

CGI_call_up_the_clans:0 "Call Up The Clans"
CGI_call_up_the_clans_desc:0 "Many of our warriors still primarily fight for their clan, under the command of their clan leader. Yet, in times of war – or war preparations – the Khan can call up the warriors from the clans. Considering the strenuous relationship with the clans, not everyzebra might heed the call, but perhaps we can compromise."

CGI_spying_traders:0 "Spying Traders"
CGI_spying_traders_desc:0 "Our caravans engage in lively trade with the north, and on their journeys they are able to see and hear a lot of information that would be valuable for our war preparations. Naturally, information is expensive, and even if we compensate our traders fairly, they encounter more difficulties during their next journey..."

CGI_reach_out_to_the_camels:0 "Reach Out To The Camels"
CGI_reach_out_to_the_camels_desc:0 "To our south are the camel nations. Our traders often cooperate with them on the long journey towards the Chisimbi region, and thus, few other nations are as involved in the Diamond Road as they are. After the Storm King vanished, their realm split in two, hampering our caravans, but perhaps a diplomatic mission could smooth over some of the difficulties we have encountered."

CGI_railways_to_buckhara:0 "Railways To Buckhara"
CGI_railways_to_buckhara_desc:0 "It is high time that railroads arrived in our nation. We have seen the marvels of progress they have brought to Colthage, but so far we have had difficulties laying our own tracks. The trains should make it much easier to transport goods and people across the country – something that will lower the costs of trade significantly."

CGI_sway_the_cities:0 "Sway The Cities"
CGI_sway_the_cities_desc:0 "The cities are some of the most fervent supporters of a stronger central government, as they see their interests threatened by the migratory clans. At the same time, they are fertile breeding grounds for new political ideas. With an investment in the right people, we can secure a strong and stable base of supporters for Khan Zaghu."

CGI_the_buckharan_connection:0 "The Buckharan Connection"
CGI_the_buckharan_connection_desc:0 "The western clans – the Buckharans – always had a special relationship with the rest of Quaggatai. Having formed their own Khanate multiple times in history, their traditions and language are just that slight bit different from the east. Khan Zaghu is relatively popular there, not least because of his wife Ohene, but before any serious attempts at centralization are possible, a political reassurance is necessary."

CGI_invest_in_the_royal_guard:0 "Invest In The Royal Guard"
CGI_invest_in_the_royal_guard_desc:0 "The royal guard was founded by Khatun Malighu, grandmother of Khan Zaghu, in order to be more independent from clan levies. By now, the royal guard serves as a professional core for our military, being our leader's closest military advisors. Providing additional funding would strengthen our position greatly – both internally and externally."

CGI_further_the_arms_trade:0 "Further The Arms Trade"
CGI_further_the_arms_trade_desc:0 "The Diamond Road offers many opportunities. Firearms have long been a staple good, along with the various materials and innovations to produce them. If we encourage the trade in war machinery, we can profit greatly from it, siphoning off the best goods for our own army."

CGI_ties_to_zarantia:0 "Ties To Zarantia"
CGI_ties_to_zarantia_desc:0 "Our western neighbour, Zarantia, is in a similar position to us as they maintain the Zebharan trade route. While our two trade routes are independent to some extent – focusing on different parts of the continent – there is, naturally, some flow between them. A mission to Zarantia is therefore a good opportunity to strengthen our trade."

CGI_mission_to_chisimbi:0 "Mission To Chisimbi"
CGI_mission_to_chisimbi_desc:0 "The southern end of the Diamond Road is in the Chisimbi region. Cities like Roam, Nieuw Rottendedam, and Zarawa offer a rich variety of wares which are highly sought after in the north. A mission to the region will have two targets: secure an advantageous political environment for our caravaneers, and look out for even more potential trade goods."

CGI_the_road_initiative:0 "The Road Initiative"
CGI_the_road_initiative_desc:0 "Quaggatai is a vast country with a relatively small population. Consequently, its road network is relatively underdeveloped. Khan Zaghu has announced the start of an initiative aimed at improving roads throughout the nation, although we can hardly invest everywhere at once."

CGI_strengthen_the_palace_bureaucracy:0 "Strengthen The Palace Bureaucracy"
CGI_strengthen_the_palace_bureaucracy_desc:0 "The foundation of any modern state is a functioning bureaucracy, which is able to enforce the will of the central government across the country. In the ongoing power struggle with the clans, such a bureaucracy is a key enabler of centralization."

CGI_placate_the_raltung:0 "Placate The Raltung"
CGI_placate_the_raltung_desc:0 "The Raltung clan has long been a rival of the Maklai clan, and by extension, Khan Zaghu. But their position in the north of Quaggatai also means that they have the closest ties to the Quagga in Coltdar. While we can't hope to overcome decades of animosity in an instant, we will stretch out a hoof to let old conflicts rest for a while."

CGI_form_the_military_investigation_office:0 "Form The Military Investigation Office"
CGI_form_the_military_investigation_office_desc:0 "To gain an edge in the coming conflicts, it is necessary that we gather as much intelligence on our enemies as we can. Forming a dedicated agency for this purpose will greatly enhance our abilities."

CGI_adjust_combat_tactics:0 "Adjust Combat Tactics"
CGI_adjust_combat_tactics_desc:0 "We Quagga are natural fighters, having fought our neighbours – and at times even ourselves – since time immemorial. Naturally, such a warrior culture comes with numerous tried and tested battle tactics. And yet, the modern battlefield has seen many innovations that we have not yet caught up with. We need to adjust."

CGI_the_marketplace_of_ideas:0 "The Marketplace Of Ideas"
CGI_the_marketplace_of_ideas_desc:0 "It would be wrong to reduce trade to a mere exchange of goods. It is always also an exchange of ideas and innovations. The Diamond Road is no exception to that, and with the right investments, we can use it to accelerate our research and development."

CGI_diversify_the_trade_goods:0 "Diversify The Trade Goods"
CGI_diversify_the_trade_goods_desc:0 "The Diamond Road is a major factor in our economy, providing us with many of the staples we need. And yet, our military experts have pointed out some goods not yet traded in significant numbers, which would help our military build-up. With the right investments, we might get a stable and cost-effective supply of the resources we need."

CGI_invest_in_arms_production:0 "Invest In Arms Production"
CGI_invest_in_arms_production_desc:0 "The modernization of our economy has given rise to various new businesses as industrial-scale production slowly becomes standard in our nation. Building on this, we should invest in new factories that can produce military goods and strengthen our domestic arms sector."

CGI_organize_the_tax_codes:0 "Organize The Tax Codes"
CGI_organize_the_tax_codes_desc:0 "A clear and fair system of taxation, enforced by a professional bureaucracy, is a simple necessity in the modern world. Only with a steady flow of income can we maintain our various obligations. In addition, centralizing taxation away from the clans can give us a much-needed boon in our ongoing power struggle."

CGI_deploy_a_mobile_reserve:0 "Deploy A Mobile Reserve"
CGI_deploy_a_mobile_reserve_desc:0 "In the past, Quaggan warriors were famous for their reliance on mobility and hit-and-run tactics. The advent of new warfare methods has eroded this advantage. However, the introduction of automobiles in our nation has now given rise to the opportunity to once again deploy a mobile reserve – although a full motorization of our army is obviously a long way off."

CGI_improve_the_drill_standards:0 "Improve The Drill Standards"
CGI_improve_the_drill_standards_desc:0 "Our royal guard might be the glory of the nation, but the vast majority of our army is made up of levies, simple clanzebras called to arms. And while in the past our warrior culture might have ensured that our fighters were well-trained and ready to fight, the new realities on the battlefield require a more systematic approach."

CGI_trading_in_artillery:0 "Trading In Artillery"
CGI_trading_in_artillery_desc:0 "While hoofarms have been traded on the Diamond Road since their invention, artillery has not seen the same fate. Being too heavy to transport, as well as being mostly useful for professional armies, has hindered attempts to introduce it as a trade good. But the Storm King left many weapon caches, and governments across the continent are gearing for war. With the right incentives, the time might be ripe."

CGI_merchants_to_capitalists:0 "Merchants To Capitalists"
CGI_merchants_to_capitalists_desc:0 "With trade in the Diamond Road increasing again and our nation on track to modernize, we should encourage merchant zebras to invest their newfound wealth in our domestic industry. Trade is a lucrative business, but at times it doesn't hurt to be a bit more self-sufficient..."

CGI_implement_two_year_plans:0 "Implement Two Year Plans"
CGI_implement_two_year_plans_desc:0 "The industrialization of the Quaggan economy is increasing steadily, and our aggressive modernization programs are starting to show results. However, there is no reason to stop now. Instead, we will start to draft two-year plans aimed at helping us catch up with our neighbours."

CGI_build_up_koltshgar_university:0 "Build Up Koltshgar University"
CGI_build_up_koltshgar_university_desc:0 "As our oldest city, Koltshgar has long been the cultural and spiritual centre of the Quaggan people. However, it had no institution of higher learning until Khatun Malighu founded Quaggan National University in 967 ALB. The number of enrolled students has increased continuously, but it is still too small for our needs. Time to change that."

CGI_promote_religious_reform:0 "Promote Religious Reform"
CGI_promote_religious_reform_desc:0 "The Quaggan religion is extremely decentralized, with shamans having each their own interpretation. These personal interpretations are then passed down from shaman to acolyte throughout the generations, leading to significant variation among herds and clans. Let us gather an assembly of important shamans in Koltshgar to harmonize at least some aspects of worship."

CGI_dawn_of_a_modern_army:0 "Dawn Of A Modern Army"
CGI_dawn_of_a_modern_army_desc:0 "Our army reforms have started to show positive effects on combat effectiveness and troop count, yet the main problem remains that we lag behind of our adversaries in technology. Targeted programs to upgrade the most important aspects of our army can help us gain the winning edge."

CGI_utilizing_the_surplus:0 "Utilizing The Surplus"
CGI_utilizing_the_surplus_desc:0 "The Diamond Road provides our country with great profits, whether in gold, resources, or innovation. And yet, in preparation for future conflicts that might interrupt our trade, we should consider turning some of the profits into domestic investment."

CGI_build_up_the_pan_quaggan_movement:0 "Build Up The Pan-Quaggan Movement"
CGI_build_up_the_pan_quaggan_movement_desc:0 "Traditionally the Quagga identified with their clan first and foremost, with any pan-Quaggan feelings being secondary. In recent decades that slowly began to change, as urbanization and a strong central government aided the development of a proper national identity. However, the loyalties of most Quagga are still at least divided, and so much work yet lies before us."

CGI_prepare_the_war_plans:0 "Prepare The War Plans"
CGI_prepare_the_war_plans_desc:0 "War with Colthage is all but certain. We should develop plans for the outbreak of open hostilities. While we can’t hope to predict how the campaign will unfold in the long run, these preparations could give us the chance to weaken their forces right away."

CGI_ready_the_nation:0 "Ready The Nation"
CGI_ready_the_nation_desc:0 "Over the past few years, we have dug ourselves out of our long isolation and backwardness. Now the time has come to reinvigorate our spirit. When the Quagga horde gallops, legends of old will come true again!"

CGI_restore_our_hegemony:0 "Restore Our Hegemony"
CGI_restore_our_hegemony_desc:0 "For 300 years, Quaggatai has enjoyed its rightful status as hegemon over northern Zebrica. Then our empire collapsed, and we had to retreat to the steppes. No longer! We are ready once more to strike terror in our foes. Let the Quagga horde gallop, so that we may restore what was lost in 825 ALB."

### DECISIONS ###

CGI_the_diamond_road:0 "The $CGI_diamond_road$"
CGI_the_diamond_road_desc:0 "The so-called $CGI_diamond_road$ is an ancient trade route, running between south-eastern Zebrica and Zonicia, passing through Chisimbi, Camelkand and Quaggatai. Since time immemorial, the Quaggan trade zebras, in conjunction with the camels, have transported riches between the two sides of the continent, from gems – including the eponymous diamonds – to spices, gold, textiles and slaves. Since the industrialisation arrived, manufactured goods also make up a significant portion of the trade.\n\nAll of this trade leaves the government with a healthy stipend. With various investments, we might be able to increase our dividends, and in dire times we can confiscate what we need, although this would have long-term effects.\n\nCurrent Strength: §Y[?CGI.CGI_diamond_road_strength] points§!\n\nCurrently, our stipends from the $CGI_diamond_road$ are as follows:\n[CGI_diamond_road_civ_desc_dyn][CGI_diamond_road_mil_desc_dyn][CGI_diamond_road_manpower_desc_dyn][CGI_diamond_road_steel_desc_dyn][CGI_diamond_road_tungsten_desc_dyn][CGI_diamond_road_rubber_desc_dyn][CGI_diamond_road_gun_desc_dyn][CGI_diamond_road_arty_desc_dyn][CGI_diamond_road_support_desc_dyn][CGI_diamond_road_construction_desc_dyn][CGI_diamond_road_research_desc_dyn][CGI_diamond_road_trade_opinion_desc_dyn]"

### EVENTS ###

quaggatai.1.t:0 "The Khan"
quaggatai.1.d:0 "Khan Zaghu walked through the halls of the royal palace in Koltshgar. His grandmother, Khatun Malighu, had built it during shortly after she had been elected as khatun, as one of her first reforms. For the most part, it was a simple stone building. Only for the throne room, Malighu had bought expensive marble from Zonicia. Quaggatai wasn't a rich nation, and other investments had been more important.\n\nHe shook his head. For three hundred years, the Quagga had dominated northern Zebrica, and yet, there was little to show for it. They had collected tribute from all over Zonicia, but the every roaming clans had had little interest to invest their gains in marble and stone. And eventually, the hegemony had collapsed, and the Quagga had been banished back to the steppe. The world had moved on without them.\n\nOnly when his grandmother, Khatun Malighu, had united the Khanate once more, Quaggatai had embarked on the much needed journey for modernization. He remembered her fondly. His mother Ephighu had died during his birth, and so he had spent his foalhood with his grandmother. She had been resolute elderly mare, strong and determined, but the clans had opposed her efforts at any opportunity. She had died a little more than ten years ago, and the clans – despite some grumbles – had made him new Khan.\n\nIn these ten years, he had broadly continued her legacy. Cities like Koltshgar, Bucklan and Buckhara were growing, the ancient diamond road trade was thriving and slowly but surely the power of the clans gave way to a stronger central government. The storm king had been a nasty surprise, but ultimately almost useful... or at least as useful as a maniac looter was going to get. Luckily, he had vanished as quickly as he had arrived, and Zaghu's armies had managed to occupy Coltdar in the aftermath.\n\nKhan Zaghu finally made it to the throne room. It would be another busy day of ruling – consulting advisors, hearing petitions and preparing decrees. Quaggatai would need to modernize quickly. Coltdar had been a gamble, and this gamble would see its consequences sooner rather than later..."
quaggatai.1.a:0 "Those who fail to adapt will be swept away."

quaggatai.2.t:0 "The Prisoner"
quaggatai.2.d:0 "Farqeghu neighed in frustration and kicked out with his hind legs. There was a loud clank as his hooves hit the stone, but the walls of his cell didn't move. He kicked out a few more times, both with his front and hind legs to vent his frustration, until the guards came with hay and yogurt for his breakfast. They didn't even bat an eye over his antics. For a moment, he considered kicking these stooges in their stupid faces, but he knew all too well that it wouldn't improve his position.\n\nWith a sigh of resignation, he began slurping his yogurt. How could he have ever been so naïve as to think that Zaghu would be better than his grandmother? Malighu had vastly overstepped her role as Khatun often enough, but she had known limits. Her modernization efforts had infringed on the Quaggan way of life, but she had refrained from all to brazen meddling in the affairs of the other clans. It had been too much goodwill to elect her grandcolt as next Khan...\n\nDespite his initial reconciliatory efforts, Zaghu had soon proven to be even worse than Malighu. But that he would openly refuse to lead the Quagga clans against the Storm King! Not just that, but when the Torquai, Raltung and Muquarili stepped up to at least save the Quaggatai's honour, he betrayed them. In a shameful display of unending tyranny, Zaghu used the yeti garrison, tasked with "collecting tribute", to uproot the clan structure that had existed for thousands of years. Even more, he had taken Farqeghu prisoner, the clan leader of a fellow clan! And now, for almost a year, Farqeghu had been stuck here, while Zaghu could run rampant to dismantle the Quaggan way of life.\n\nBut this was not over! Surely, his loyal zebras already plotted to free him and overthrow the tyrant Khan. It was infuriating that the Khanate had not collapsed immediately under such unprecedented despotic behaviour from a Khan, but there had to be something... right? Farqeghu kicked out against the wall more time before, with another sigh, turning to eat his hay."
quaggatai.2.a:0 "For true Quagga, the clan comes first."

quaggatai.3.t:0 "The Buckharan"
quaggatai.3.d:0 "Eaghu put the letter beside her and stared into the fire. Ever since her sister married Zaghu and moved to the east, they had mostly communicated via mail. And since her brother-in-law had become Khan, even that had gotten sparse. Recently, she had written her again. And now Ohene had replied, with an almost five pages long letter. She twitched her ears, unsure on how to proceed.\n\nAll in all, the answer didn't satisfy her. Ohene had done little more than repeat the arguments that her husband used all the time – how Quaggatai needed to modernize, how it was necessary to embrace industrialization and that a stronger Khanate could guarantee the continued independence of the Quagga. This was not wrong, and Eaghu would have been perfectly fine if Zaghu would keep it at that.\n\nBut it was pretty clear to her that he wanted more. He wanted a proper monarchy, to guarantee his foals the right to succession and the continued dominance of the Maklai. Perhaps he also dreamed of conquests. The fact that he had occupied Coltdar in the aftermath of the Storm King certainly pointed in this direction. It was an open invitation to Colthage to declare war, and an even more welcome excuse for him to strengthen his position under the disguise of "mobilization". Was it true that war with Colthage was inevitable, who he – and now also her sister – claimed? It seemed far-fetched to her.\n\nWith the right moves, the Suniquai would earn a good place in the new state. Ohene surely would support that, she said so much in her letter. But was this the right move? Despite the influence of her sister, a stronger Khanate would mean more eastern dominance of Buckhara as well... An all-powerful Koltshgar felt like a step to much.\n\nShe twitched her ears again. The world didn't wait for the indecisive. If she acted now, she could make herself perhaps indispensable to the Khan. But was this really what she wanted?"
quaggatai.3.a:0 "In the end, we are all Quagga."

quaggatai.4.t:0 "The Caravaneer"
quaggatai.4.d:0 "Menuhe put the saddlebags down with a sigh of relief. It had been a long trip, from Zawara through Roam and Camelkand, but now they had made station in Zashi. It felt good to finally be on Quaggan soil again. It had been three years... Three years without seeing her foals. How much would they have grown? A lot, probably. Would Elohe still be so careless in combing her mane? Maybe Ranu had managed to civilize her... Ranu, her husband... How much she missed him! It would be one more month until the caravan would finally reach Koltshgar and she would be able to embrace him again. And her foals as well. She let her head hang low. One more month...\n\nStrange how times changed. When she grew up, she had always been part of her mother's caravan. In fact, she had not been born in Quaggatai at all, but in a small desert village in the middle of the camel lands. She had been with the caravan her whole foalhood, and never even a single moment would her mother thought of leaving her at home. They were trade zebras, and the little filly would just trot along with the caravan. At least they hadn't given her a saddlebag back then.\n\nAnd now? When she had married Ranu, he had first joined her caravan. But after she had born their first foal, he wanted to settle down. The city of Koltshgar had been growing rapidly at the time, and more and more jobs were available there. She had agreed to stay with him in Koltshgar as long as Elohe needed her milk, but she was a trader... She could not just settle down. Ranu had found good work, as a scribe for the growing palace bureaucracy, and so they parted. Not forever, never forever, but always for long.\n\nEven Quaggatai wasn't safe of modernity, it seemed. For her grandmother, the idea of a Quagga settling down would have been just preposterous. Well, grandma had always been a bit narrow-minded, condemning Malighu's reforms... but still. Koltshgar had now grown to be a true city, rivalling those in the north in Zonicia. Would all Quagga just become like the zebras in the north? Surely not – Quaggatai didn't have the farmland for that.\n\nWith one more sigh, she opened her saddlebags. Unpolished diamonds looked rather inconspicuous, but they would make a good price in Colthage. The caravan had bought a lot of goods in the south. Gems, gold, spices. In Roam they also had bought some slaves. Colthagian landowner would pay well for them. It was a long journey, time and time again, but it also sure was profitable..."
quaggatai.4.a:0 "And the caravan moves, restless, to keep the trade flowing."
quaggatai.4.a_tt:0 "The $CGI_diamond_road$ is an ancient trade route from southern Zebrica through Camelkand and Koltshgar to Zonicia.\n\nThe caravans passing through Quaggatai generate us a §Ghealthy profit§!, however, the benefits go beyond that - a strong $CGI_diamond_road$ can give us bonuses to §Ymodernization§! or §Yresearch§! as well as strenghening some focuses. We can also §Yexpoit§! the $CGI_diamond_road$ to gain short-term §Yresources§!, with the cost of §Rweakening§! future trade. As the §Ytrade zebras§! generally are in §Gfavour§! of a strong §YKhanate§!, §YKhan Zaghu§! might profit politically from a strong $CGI_diamond_road$."

quaggatai.5.t:0 "The Sole Republican"
quaggatai.5.d:0 "Telohe looked around in the room. It was rather shabby, with a few chairs, a bookshelf, a desk and a filing cabinet. All in all, it looked more like a book club rather than the head quarter of a political party. And if she was completely honest to herself, it probably wouldn't become more for a long time.\n\nShe sighed. When she founded the Quaggan Republican Movement five years ago, it had just been her. By now, she had a small group of friends, but it wasn't really a party by any metric – it really was little more literary coffee circle a fancy name. And even that name barely held together... Her friend Mohe, who served as the secretary, had argued multiple times that the Hippogriffs had made rather positive experiences with their monarchy. Telohe had answered that Quaggatai was missing the tradition of monarchical restraint that the Hippogriffs had. In the end, they had reached the compromise that they would accept a constitutional monarchy as an intermediate step towards Harmony. She shook her head. They really were a republican movement where half the members weren't even republican.\n\nA month ago, they had finally published their manifesto. And yesterday, she had received some mail from the government. At first, she had freaked out about it – as Khan Zaghu was not too gentle with dissidents – but the letter, to her complete surprise, had been rather positive. "In his efforts to strengthen Quaggatai's national identity, His Majesty has seen fit to support movements that promote a pan-Quaggan viewpoint." had the letter started. As a result, she now got a lump sum of Colthagian zhekels each month and also the room she was just standing in. It wouldn't be quite enough that she could give up her job and invest all her efforts into the movement, but it would help a great deal.\n\nAfter scratching her mane for a while, she decided that the first purchase from the new money would be some more comfortable club chairs to replace the wooden ones. She had seen a collection of old fauteuils at the market. And in the meeting next week, she would tell the others of their new income. Although, thinking about it, it was rather strange for a republican movement to get its funding from the monarchy it wanted to abolish..."
quaggatai.5.a:0 "Their ideas might seem outlandish, but they have their uses."

quaggatai.6.t:0 "The Heir"
quaggatai.6.d:0 "When Moghu trotted to his lectures this morning, he could barely hold his head straight. The cinder yesterday had not been a good idea. And neither had been the Macawian rum. But this had been yesterday. Today, he would need to learn about some intricacies of military logistics or similar nonsense. And if he wanted to avoid embarrassing himself before his sister, he would also need to not fall asleep. With how heavy his head felt, this was easier said than done.\n\nAlane was a little under two years younger than him and always organized, on time and frighteningly competent in every subject. He would have been very impressed, if it wouldn't be so annoying. He always felt so inadequate when talking to her. It would have been less of a problem if she had been older than him, but with him being the firstborn, this meant that he was the heir apparent. He had floated the idea with his father to make Alane the heir, but Zaghu had told him that his was not an option. The clans practised strict primogeniture, and he would just need to get his act together.\n\n"Hi Moghu!" The sudden voice of his sister made him jump a step to the side. "Have you remembered to write the essay on distributed supply networks?" He vaguely remembered that this had been a thing. At first, he wanted to flair his nostrils, but it would be of no avail – she would find out soon anyways. He slowly shook his head. "Thought so. Well, you still have around half an hour. Take this, but don't make it too obvious." She gave him some papers. It was her essay, for him to copy. That was perhaps the worst part – on top of all her qualities, she was also friendly and helpful. It only made him feel even more useless, especially because he knew very well that he didn't have a choice.\n\nAround twenty-five minutes later, he gave her the papers back. His essay wouldn't be as good as hers, but it would not have been fair to copy everything. His own ideas were lacking at best, and he knew it, but in total it would be enough to cover up that he had forgotten to write the essay in time. Why, by all things between Iszkarha's heavenly realm and Ilghunha's endless steppe, did he have to learn about distributed supply networks in the first place?"
quaggatai.6.a:0 "Let's hope he grows with his responsibilities."

quaggatai.7.t:0 "At The Crossroads"
quaggatai.7.d:0 ""Your plan seems risky." Ohene remarked.\n\nZaghu nodded slightly. The map before him showed the clans of Quaggatai, with figurines representing the various friends and enemies within each clan. "Things will come to a conclusion soon," he answered, "at the latest when Colthage moves." His muzzle scrunched when he looked to the top of the map. "They can't possibly ignore Coltdar forever. Until then the dominos must have fallen."\n\nHis wife stepped closer to the map. "Don't overtake yourself. The defeat of the Torquai and Muquarili has given you the upper hoof for now, but the clans are still strong. And they don't forget." She slightly tilted her head. "I have told you about the letter from my sister, right? She might be mostly loyal to your cause, but even she isn't free from doubts."\n\n"I know, I know." He stared intensely at the little figurine representing Eaghu, as if he tried to read her mind by proxy. "As long as she stays neutral... this is all I need. Farqeghu is secured in house arrest, and the Torquai are still licking their wounds. The Senar are our friends, and Opheghu knows very well that the Raltung have never forgiven them for seceding. But this is only one half of the equation anyways." He shuffled around some figures wearing saddlebags. "Here lies my real strength. The traders know that their future looks brighter in a unified Quaggan state. The cities as well. Times are changing."\n\n"But have they changed enough already?" Ohene asked. "And you might think you have masterfully outplayed the Storm King's armies against your opponents, but the cities remember the... tribute they had to pay. They haven't turned against you yet, but your submission to the Storm King came at a cost. Not that it was wrong." She sighed. "It would have been a folly to have everything we build so far destroyed. And yet, we have to tread carefully. I know you are ambitious, my Khan, but we need to secure our gains, slow and steady." She stretched her neck, trying to kiss him on his muzzle.\n\nZaghu didn't react, his eyes still locked on the map. "Quaggatai stands at the crossroads." he mumbled."
quaggatai.7.a:0 "The future in our hoofs."
quaggatai.7.a_tt:0 "As Quaggatai continues to §Gmodernize§!, §YKhan Zaghu§! and §Ythe clans§! are in a deadly powerstruggle for the §Yfuture of the Quaggan nation§!.\n\nOnce §RColthage attacks§! to reclaim §YColtdar§!, this tree will become §Runavailable§!.

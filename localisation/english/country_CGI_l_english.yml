### EVENTS ###

quaggatai.1.t:0 "The Khan"
quaggatai.1.d:0 "Khan Zaghu walked through the halls of the royal palace in Koltshgar. His grandmother, Khatun Malighu, had built it during shortly after she had been elected as khatun, as one of her first reforms. For the most part, it was a simple stone building. Only for the throne room, Malighu had bought expensive marble from Zonicia. Quaggatai wasn't a rich nation, and other investments had been more important.\n\nHe shook his head. For three hundred years, the Quagga had dominated northern Zebrica, and yet, there was little to show for it. They had collected tribute from all over Zonicia, but the every roaming clans had had little interest to invest their gains in marble and stone. And eventually, the hegemony had collapsed, and the Quagga had been banished back to the steppe. The world had moved on without them.\n\nOnly when his grandmother, Khatun Malighu, had united the Khanate once more, Quaggatai had embarked on the much needed journey for modernization. He remembered her fondly. His mother Ephighu had died during his birth, and so he had spent his foalhood with his grandmother. She had been resolute elderly mare, strong and determined, but the clans had opposed her efforts at any opportunity. She had died a little more than ten years ago, and the clans – despite some grumbles – had made him new Khan.\n\nIn these ten years, he had broadly continued her legacy. Cities like Koltshdar, Bucklan and Buckhara were growing, the ancient diamond road trade was thriving and slowly but surely the power of the clans gave way to a stronger central government. The storm king had been a nasty surprise, but ultimately almost useful... or at least as useful as a maniac looter was going to get. Luckily, he had vanished as quickly as he had arrived, and Zaghu's armies had managed to occupy Coltdar in the aftermath.\n\nKhan Zaghu finally made it to the throne room. It would be another busy day of ruling – consulting advisors, hearing petitions and preparing decrees. Quaggatai would need to modernize quickly. Coltdar had been a gamble, and this gamble would see its consequences sooner rather than later..."
quaggatai.1.a:0 "Those who fail to adapt will be swept away."
quaggatai.1.a_tt:0 "As Quaggatai continues to §Gmodernize§!, §YKhan Zaghu§! and §Ythe clans§! are in a deadly powerstruggle for the §Yfuture of the Quaggan nation§!.\n\nOnce §YColthage§! attacks to reclaim §YColtdar§!, this tree will become §Runavailable§!. The future of our nation will then depend on the current value of the §Ybalance of power§!.\n"

quaggatai.2.t:0 "The Prisoner"
quaggatai.2.d:0 "Farqeghu neighed in frustration and kicked out with his hind legs. There was a loud clank as his hooves hit the stone, but the walls of his cell didn't move. He kicked out a few more times, both with his front and hind legs to vent his frustration, until the guards came with hay and yogurt for his breakfast. They didn't even bat an eye over his antics. For a moment, he considered kicking these stooges in their stupid faces, but he knew all too well that it wouldn't improve his position.\n\nWith a sigh of resignation, he began slurping his yogurt. How could he have ever been so naïve as to think that Zaghu would be better than his grandmother? Malighu had vastly overstepped her role as Khatun often enough, but she had known limits. Her modernization efforts had infringed on the Quaggan way of life, but she had refrained from all to brazen meddling in the affairs of the other clans. It had been too much goodwill to elect her grandcolt as next Khan...\n\nDespite his initial reconciliatory efforts, Zaghu had soon proven to be even worse than Malighu. But that he would openly refuse to lead the Quagga clans against the Storm King! Not just that, but when the Torquai, Raltung and Muquarili stepped up to at least save the Quaggatai's honour, he betrayed them. In a shameful display of unending tyranny, Zaghu used the yeti garrison, tasked with "collecting tribute", to uproot the clan structure that had existed for thousands of years. Even more, he had taken Farqeghu prisoner, the clan leader of a fellow clan! And now, for almost a year, Farqeghu had been stuck here, while Zaghu could run rampant to dismantle the Quaggan way of life.\n\nBut this was not over! Surely, his loyal zebras already plotted to free him and overthrow the tyrant Khan. It was infuriating that the Khanate had not collapsed immediately under such unprecedented despotic behaviour from a Khan, but there had to be something... right? Farqeghu kicked out against the wall more time before, with another sigh, turning to eat his hay."
quaggatai.2.a:0 "For a true Quagga, the clan comes first."

quaggatai.3.t:0 "The Caravaneer"
quaggatai.3.d:0 "Menuhe put the saddlebags down with a sigh of relief. It had been a long trip, from Zawara through Roam and Camelkand, but now they had made station in Zashi. It felt good to finally be on Quaggan soil again. It had been three years... Three years without seeing her foals. How much would they have grown? A lot, probably. Would Elohe still be so careless in combing her mane? Maybe Ranu had managed to civilize her... Ranu, her husband... How much she missed him! It would be one more month until the caravan would finally reach Koltshdar and she would be able to embrace him again. And her foals as well. She let her head hang low. One more month...\n\nStrange how times changed. When she grew up, she had always been part of her mother's caravan. In fact, she had not been born in Quaggatai at all, but in a small desert village in the middle of the camel lands. She had been with the caravan her whole foalhood, and never even a single moment would her mother thought of leaving her at home. They were trade zebras, and the little filly would just trot along with the caravan. At least they hadn't given her a saddlebag back then.\n\nAnd now? When she had married Ranu, he had first joined her caravan. But after she had born their first foal, he wanted to settle down. The city of Koltshdar had been growing rapidly at the time, and more and more jobs were available there. She had agreed to stay with him in Koltshdar as long as Elohe needed her milk, but she was a trader... She could not just settle down. Ranu had found good work, as a scribe for the growing palace bureaucracy, and so they parted. Not forever, never forever, but always for long.\n\nEven Quaggatai wasn't safe of modernity, it seemed. For her grandmother, the idea of a Quagga settling down would have been just preposterous. Well, grandma had always been a bit narrow-minded, condemning Malighu's reforms... but still. Koltshdar had now grown to be a true city, rivalling those in the north in Zonicia. Would all Quagga just become like the zebras in the north? Surely not – Quaggatai didn't have the farmland for that.\n\nWith one more sigh, she opened her saddlebags. Unpolished diamonds looked rather inconspicuous, but they would make a good price in Colthage. The caravan had bought a lot of goods in the south. Gems, gold, spices. In Roam they also had bought some slaves. Colthagian landowner would pay well for them. It was a long journey, time and time again, but it also sure was profitable..."
quaggatai.3.a:0 "And the caravan moves, restless, to keep the trade flowing."
quaggatai.3.a_tt:0 "The §Cdiamond road§! is an ancient trade route from southern Zebrica through Camelkand and Koltshdar to Zonicia.\n\nThe caravans passing through Quaggatai generate us a §Ghealthy profit§!, however, the benefits go beyond that - a strong §Cdiamond road§! can give us bonuses to §Ymodernization§! or §Yresearch§! as well as strenghening some focuses. We can also §Yexpoit§! the §Cdiamond road§! to gain short-term §Yresources§!, with the cost of §Rweakening§! future trade. As the §Ytrade zebras§! generally are in §Gfavour§! of a strong §YKhanate§!, §YKhan Zaghu§! might profit politically from a strong §Cdiamond road§!.\n"

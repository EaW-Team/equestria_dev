CGI_khan_zaghu:0 "Khan Zaghu"
CGI_khan_zaghu_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 6th of April, 865\n\n§YBiography§!: Zaghu, Great Khan of Quaggatai. Many words have been used to describe this stallion: ambitious, ruthless, shrewd, visionary, despotic. For his supporters, he is the one to drag Quaggatai out of the mud, kicking and screaming if necessary, while for his opponents, he is the most existential threat to the Quaggan way of life.\n\nHis birth in 965 ALB was overshadowed by tragedy, when his mother Ephighu, then heir apparent to Khatun Malighu, died mere days after. As a result, he grew up in the court of his grandmother, who took great personal interest in his education. She personally taught him about Quaggan history, traditions, and martial arts. She also hired Colthaginian professors to educate young Zaghu in science, mathematics, economics, and foreign languages.\n\nWhen he was two years old, his grandmother organized a betrothal with Ohene, the daughter of her close friend and allied clan leader Teqghu. However, during his foalhood, it had little relevance to him, and even though Ohene moved to Koltshgar when he was eight years old, the seven-years-older filly rather enjoyed the developing cultural life in the capital. For some years, it looked like the betrothal would go nowhere, yet, when Zaghu turned twenty, their feelings had changed. He liked her calm and collected personality, while she had grown fond of the attractive young stallion. Since their marriage, their relationship has grown ever closer, and nowadays Ohene is his closest advisor. Together, they also had two foals, Moghu and Alane.\n\nWhen Khatun Melighu died in 996 ALB at the venerable age of 85, she left Zaghu with a successful, but still ongoing reform program. Her political alliances guaranteed his election to the position of Khan, and at first he merely continued her policies. However, over time, he showed more and more of his true ambitions – curtailing the old clan system, reforming Quaggatai into a proper monarchy, and restoring lost greatness. Unsurprisingly, this has made him controversial amongst the Quagga, and it remains to be seen how many of his plans he can bring to fruition.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Kessel"

CGI_ohene:0 "Ohene"
CGI_ohene_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 16th of June, 858\n\n§YBiography§!: Ohene is the younger sister of Eaghu, the clan leader of the Suniquai. Born in 958, three years after her sister, to the then clan leader Teqghu and his wife Eastene, she grew up during the early reign of Khatun Malighu. Her father was one of the leading voices in favour of joining the re-emerging Khanate of Quaggatai, and continued to support Malighu's efforts to modernize the nation. While she was only second in line for clan leader after Eaghu, her parents organized a comprehensive education for her. As a result of that, Ohene speaks five languages, in addition to Quaggan, she also speaks Colthaginian, Hippogriffian, Macawian and Camelian.\n\nIn 965, when Ephighu, daughter of Khatun Malighu and heir to the reigning Maklai clan, died in foalbirth, Malighu looked to increase support for her new-born grandson and now heir Zaghu. Two years later, the Khatun and Teqghu organized a betrothal between Ohene and Zaghu. At fifteen, she moved to the court in Koltshgar, now growing up beside her future husband. However, during those years she showed little interest in the seven-years-younger colt, instead spending time in the rapidly evolving capital. For a few years, it looked like the betrothal would be dissolved, but in 985, Zaghu had grown into a handsome young stallion, and the two agreed to marry.\n\nDespite the obvious political nature of the marriage, it turned out very well. Zaghu came to see her as his closest advisor and relied on her calm nature to mitigate his sometimes impulsive outbursts. Together, they had two foals – Moghu and Alane – guaranteeing the line of succession for the Maklai clan and, according to Zaghu's plans, also for Quaggatai. Though they have now been married for over twenty years, they are still very close, and Ohene enjoys widespread support as Khatun-consort.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Motley"

## Starting Tree ##
CGI_the_battle_for_quaggatai:0 "The Battle For Quaggatai"
CGI_the_battle_for_quaggatai_desc:0 "The Storm King's empire has collapsed, but the true fight for Quaggatai has just begun. Khan Zaghu wants to continue his grandmother's legacy and centralize the state around himself, but the powerful clans oppose him at every opportunity. The battles of the coming years will shape the nation's future."

CGI_prepare_for_the_inevitable:0 "Prepare For The Inevitable"
CGI_prepare_for_the_inevitable_desc:0 "To the north stands [CTH.GetNameDef], our rival since time immemorial. For centuries, we thought to have them broken and subjugated under our rule, but in 825 ALB they rose up and drove us back to the steppes. Now, with the occupation of Coltdar in the aftermath of the Storm King's collapse, another war seems inevitable, thus preparations must be made."

CGI_strengthen_the_diamond_road:0 "Strengthen The Diamond Road"
CGI_strengthen_the_diamond_road_desc:0 "The diamond road is a valuable trade route flowing through our nation. Under the Storm King, it was thrown into disarray, but now the situation is improving again. As it is key to much of our nation's riches, we must protect and nurture it."

CGI_embracing_modernity:0 "Embracing Modernity"
CGI_embracing_modernity_desc:0 "It is undeniable that we have fallen behind our neighbours technologically, especially Colthage. Old craftszebraship is replaced with machinery, old wisdom with new science, and old swords and bows with firearms. We must adapt to not fall into obscurity."

CGI_dealing_with_the_clans:0 "Dealing With The Clans"
CGI_dealing_with_the_clans_desc:0 "Quaggan society has always relied on a strong clan system, with most Quagga holding more loyalty to their clan than the nation at large. Even after decades of state-building by Malighu and now Zaghu, the clans still hold many cards in their hooves. We need to play out ours carefully."

CGI_fortify_coltdar:0 "Fortify Coltdar"
CGI_fortify_coltdar_desc:0 "It is most likely that when war with our northern neighbours eventually breaks out, we will find ourselves on the back hoof for a while. Establishing well-placed fortifications can help us withstand the initial blow."

CGI_reinforce_karmanedgan:0 "Reinforce Karmanedgan"
CGI_reinforce_karmanedgan_desc:0 "Khan Zaghu ordered the occupation of Coltdar under the pretence of protecting its local Quagga population, but truth be told, for the majority of locals, we are just foreign occupiers. We must increase our presence in the region to keep it stable and reduce future troubles."

CGI_opportunities_in_zonicia:0 "Opportunities In Zonicia"
CGI_opportunities_in_zonicia_desc:0 "Colthage might be our rival in political terms, but we still have a flourishing trade relationship through the Diamond Road. To further bolster our trade, perhaps it is possible to make some mutually beneficial agreements – or alternatively, we could look for some other interested buyers."

CGI_patrol_the_caravan_ways:0 "Patrol The Caravan Ways"
CGI_patrol_the_caravan_ways_desc:0 "The steppe is vast, and the clans are always at odds with each other and the central government. Caravans can often find themselves in the middle of these complex struggles, leading to dangers or detours. By patrolling frequently used caravan ways, we can alleviate these issues and bolster trade."

CGI_workshops_to_factories:0 "Workshops To Factories"
CGI_workshops_to_factories_desc:0 "So far, Quaggatai has little industry to speak of, with the few factories restricted to the major cities. Much of our production still happens in small workshops, unchanged from centuries ago. Some government programs are needed to kickstart our development."

CGI_rebuild_the_economy:0 "Rebuild The Economy"
CGI_rebuild_the_economy_desc:0 "With Khan Zaghu realising early on that resisting the Storm King would be infeasible, we have suffered less under him than most of our neighbours. And yet, his harsh demands for tribute – some would call it looting – have caused much hardship and an economic downturn. We need to focus on rebuilding what was lost."

CGI_sway_the_cities:0 "Sway The Cities"
CGI_sway_the_cities_desc:0 "The cities are some of the most fervent supporters of a stronger central government, as they see their interests threatened by the migratory clans. At the same time, they are fertile breeding grounds for new political ideas. With an investment in the right people, we can secure a strong and stable base of supporters for Khan Zaghu."

CGI_friends_in_the_north:0 "Friends In The North"
CGI_friends_in_the_north_desc:0 "When the Senar clan broke off from the Raltung clan in the chaos following Khan Atanghu's death, the Maklai came to their aid and supported their place as the fifth eastern clan. Opheghu, their current clan leader, was crucial to secure Khan Zaghu's election and continues to be a friend and ally of his. We need to reinforce this alliance."

CGI_the_bucklan_redoubt:0 "The Bucklan Redoubt"
CGI_the_bucklan_redoubt_desc:0 "If we want to prepare fully for a war with Colthage, we have to consider the possibility that our lines might be broken and we have to retreat. In this case, the Bagraza River forms a natural defensive position. Some extra investments into a fort line – quickly dubbed the Bucklan Redoubt by our military planners – could enable us to effectively resist the Colthaginians for a long time."

CGI_call_up_the_clans:0 "Call Up The Clans"
CGI_call_up_the_clans_desc:0 "Many of our warriors still primarily fight for their clan, under the command of their clan leader. Yet, in times of war – or war preparations – the Khan can call up the warriors from the clans. Considering the strenuous relationship with the clans, not everyzebra might heed the call, but perhaps we can compromise."

CGI_spying_traders:0 "Spying Traders"
CGI_spying_traders_desc:0 "Our caravans engage in lively trade with the north, and on their journeys they are able to see and hear a lot of information that would be valuable for our war preparations. Naturally, information is expensive, and even if we compensate our traders fairly, they encounter more difficulties during their next journey..."

CGI_reach_out_to_the_camels:0 "Reach Out To The Camels"
CGI_reach_out_to_the_camels_desc:0 "To our south are the camel nations. Our traders often cooperate with them on the long journey towards the Chisimbi region, and thus, few other nations are as involved in the Diamond Road as they are. After the Storm King vanished, their realm split in two, hampering our caravans, but perhaps a diplomatic mission could smooth over some of the difficulties we have encountered."

CGI_railways_to_buckhara:0 "Railways To Buckhara"
CGI_railways_to_buckhara_desc:0 "It is high time that railroads arrived in our nation. We have seen the marvels of progress they have brought to Colthage, but so far we have had difficulties laying our own tracks. The trains should make it much easier to transport goods and people across the country – something that will lower the costs of trade significantly."

CGI_the_urban_clan_question:0 "The Urban Clan Question"
CGI_the_urban_clan_question_desc:0 "The emergence of cities is a relatively new phenomenon for Quaggatai. But in recent decades, urbanisation has come to us as well: slowly at first, but by now the urban zebras are able – and willing – to shake up the traditional political order. It is time to openly discuss the question of urban clans."

CGI_the_buckharan_connection:0 "The Buckharan Connection"
CGI_the_buckharan_connection_desc:0 "The western clans – the Buckharans – always had a special relationship with the rest of Quaggatai. Having formed their own Khanate multiple times in history, their traditions and language are just that slight bit different from the east. Khan Zaghu is relatively popular there, not least because of his wife Ohene, but before any serious attempts at centralization are possible, a political reassurance is necessary."

CGI_invest_in_the_royal_guard:0 "Invest In The Royal Guard"
CGI_invest_in_the_royal_guard_desc:0 "The royal guard was founded by Khatun Malighu, grandmother of Khan Zaghu, in order to be more independent from clan levies. By now, the royal guard serves as a professional core for our military, being our leader's closest military advisors. Providing additional funding would strengthen our position greatly – both internally and externally."

CGI_further_the_arms_trade:0 "Further The Arms Trade"
CGI_further_the_arms_trade_desc:0 "The Diamond Road offers many opportunities. Firearms have long been a staple good, along with the various materials and innovations to produce them. If we encourage the trade in war machinery, we can profit greatly from it, siphoning off the best goods for our own army."

CGI_ties_to_zarantia:0 "Ties To Zarantia"
CGI_ties_to_zarantia_desc:0 "Our western neighbour, Zarantia, is in a similar position to us as they maintain the Zebharan trade route. While our two trade routes are independent to some extent – focusing on different parts of the continent – there is, naturally, some flow between them. A mission to Zarantia is therefore a good opportunity to strengthen our trade."

CGI_mission_to_chisimbi:0 "Mission To Chisimbi"
CGI_mission_to_chisimbi_desc:0 "The southern end of the Diamond Road is in the Chisimbi region. Cities like Roam, Nieuw Rottendedam, and Zarawa offer a rich variety of wares which are highly sought after in the north. A mission to the region will have two targets: secure an advantageous political environment for our caravaneers, and look out for even more potential trade goods."

CGI_the_road_initiative:0 "The Road Initiative"
CGI_the_road_initiative_desc:0 "Quaggatai is a vast country with a relatively small population. Consequently, its road network is relatively underdeveloped. Khan Zaghu has announced the start of an initiative aimed at improving roads throughout the nation, although we can hardly invest everywhere at once."

CGI_strengthen_the_palace_bureaucracy:0 "Strengthen The Palace Bureaucracy"
CGI_strengthen_the_palace_bureaucracy_desc:0 "The foundation of any modern state is a functioning bureaucracy, which is able to enforce the will of the central government across the country. In the ongoing power struggle with the clans, such a bureaucracy is a key enabler of centralization."

CGI_placate_the_raltung:0 "Placate The Raltung"
CGI_placate_the_raltung_desc:0 "The Raltung clan has long been a rival of the Maklai clan, and by extension, Khan Zaghu. But their position in the north of Quaggatai also means that they have the closest ties to the Quagga in Coltdar. While we can't hope to overcome decades of animosity in an instant, we will stretch out a hoof to let old conflicts rest for a while."

CGI_form_the_military_investigation_office:0 "Form The Military Investigation Office"
CGI_form_the_military_investigation_office_desc:0 "To gain an edge in the coming conflicts, it is necessary that we gather as much intelligence on our enemies as we can. Forming a dedicated agency for this purpose will greatly enhance our abilities."

CGI_adjust_combat_tactics:0 "Adjust Combat Tactics"
CGI_adjust_combat_tactics_desc:0 "We Quagga are natural fighters, having fought our neighbours – and at times even ourselves – since time immemorial. Naturally, such a warrior culture comes with numerous tried and tested battle tactics. And yet, the modern battlefield has seen many innovations that we have not yet caught up with. We need to adjust."

CGI_the_marketplace_of_ideas:0 "The Marketplace Of Ideas"
CGI_the_marketplace_of_ideas_desc:0 "It would be wrong to reduce trade to a mere exchange of goods. It is always also an exchange of ideas and innovations. The Diamond Road is no exception to that, and with the right investments, we can use it to accelerate our research and development."

CGI_diversify_the_trade_goods:0 "Diversify The Trade Goods"
CGI_diversify_the_trade_goods_desc:0 "The Diamond Road is a major factor in our economy, providing us with many of the staples we need. And yet, our military experts have pointed out some goods not yet traded in significant numbers, which would help our military build-up. With the right investments, we might get a stable and cost-effective supply of the resources we need."

CGI_invest_in_arms_production:0 "Invest In Arms Production"
CGI_invest_in_arms_production_desc:0 "The modernization of our economy has given rise to various new businesses as industrial-scale production slowly becomes standard in our nation. Building on this, we should invest in new factories that can produce military goods and strengthen our domestic arms sector."

CGI_organize_the_tax_codes:0 "Organize The Tax Codes"
CGI_organize_the_tax_codes_desc:0 "A clear and fair system of taxation, enforced by a professional bureaucracy, is a simple necessity in the modern world. Only with a steady flow of income can we maintain our various obligations. In addition, centralizing taxation away from the clans can give us a much-needed boon in our ongoing power struggle."

CGI_deploy_a_mobile_reserve:0 "Deploy A Mobile Reserve"
CGI_deploy_a_mobile_reserve_desc:0 "In the past, Quaggan warriors were famous for their reliance on mobility and hit-and-run tactics. The advent of new warfare methods has eroded this advantage. However, the introduction of automobiles in our nation has now given rise to the opportunity to once again deploy a mobile reserve – although a full motorization of our army is obviously a long way off."

CGI_improve_the_drill_standards:0 "Improve The Drill Standards"
CGI_improve_the_drill_standards_desc:0 "Our royal guard might be the glory of the nation, but the vast majority of our army is made up of levies, simple clanzebras called to arms. And while in the past our warrior culture might have ensured that our fighters were well-trained and ready to fight, the new realities on the battlefield require a more systematic approach."

CGI_trading_in_artillery:0 "Trading In Artillery"
CGI_trading_in_artillery_desc:0 "While hoofarms have been traded on the Diamond Road since their invention, artillery has not seen the same fate. Being too heavy to transport, as well as being mostly useful for professional armies, has hindered attempts to introduce it as a trade good. But the Storm King left many weapon caches, and governments across the continent are gearing for war. With the right incentives, the time might be ripe."

CGI_merchants_to_capitalists:0 "Merchants To Capitalists"
CGI_merchants_to_capitalists_desc:0 "With trade in the Diamond Road increasing again and our nation on track to modernize, we should encourage merchant zebras to invest their newfound wealth in our domestic industry. Trade is a lucrative business, but at times it doesn't hurt to be a bit more self-sufficient..."

CGI_implement_two_year_plans:0 "Implement Two Year Plans"
CGI_implement_two_year_plans_desc:0 "The industrialization of the Quaggan economy is increasing steadily, and our aggressive modernization programs are starting to show results. However, there is no reason to stop now. Instead, we will start to draft two-year plans aimed at helping us catch up with our neighbours."

CGI_expand_koltshgar_university:0 "Expand Koltshgar University"
CGI_expand_koltshgar_university_desc:0 "As our oldest city, Koltshgar has long been the cultural and spiritual centre of the Quaggan people. However, it had no institution of higher learning until Khatun Malighu founded Quaggan National University in 967 ALB. The number of enrolled students has increased continuously, but it is still too small for our needs. It is time to change that."

CGI_promote_religious_reform:0 "Promote Religious Reform"
CGI_promote_religious_reform_desc:0 "The Quaggan religion is extremely decentralized, with shamans having each their own interpretation. These personal interpretations are then passed down from shaman to acolyte throughout the generations, leading to significant variation among herds and clans. Let us gather an assembly of important shamans in Koltshgar to harmonize at least some aspects of worship."

CGI_promote_religious_reform_clans:0 "Promote Religious Reform"
CGI_promote_religious_reform_clans_desc:0 "The traditions of worship of the Gods differ significantly between Quaggan clans, and oftentimes even between shamans of the same clan. Previously, Zaghu wanted to control our traditions as a means to increase his control, but after his overthrow we can now enshrine our religious freedom."

CGI_dawn_of_a_modern_army:0 "Dawn Of A Modern Army"
CGI_dawn_of_a_modern_army_desc:0 "Our army reforms have started to show positive effects on combat effectiveness and troop count, yet the main problem remains that we lag behind of our adversaries in technology. Targeted programs to upgrade the most important aspects of our army can help us gain the winning edge."

CGI_utilizing_the_surplus:0 "Utilizing The Surplus"
CGI_utilizing_the_surplus_desc:0 "The Diamond Road provides our country with great profits, whether in gold, resources, or innovation. And yet, in preparation for future conflicts that might interrupt our trade, we should consider turning some of the profits into domestic investment."

CGI_build_up_the_pan_quaggan_movement:0 "Build Up The Pan-Quaggan Movement"
CGI_build_up_the_pan_quaggan_movement_desc:0 "Traditionally the Quagga identified with their clan first and foremost, with any pan-Quaggan feelings being secondary. In recent decades that slowly began to change, as urbanization and a strong central government aided the development of a proper national identity. However, the loyalties of most Quagga are still at least divided, and so much work yet lies before us."

CGI_prepare_the_war_plans:0 "Prepare The War Plans"
CGI_prepare_the_war_plans_desc:0 "War with Colthage is all but certain. We should develop plans for the outbreak of open hostilities. While we can't hope to predict how the campaign will unfold in the long run, these preparations could give us the chance to weaken their forces right away."

CGI_ready_the_nation:0 "Ready The Nation"
CGI_ready_the_nation_desc:0 "Over the past few years, we have dug ourselves out of our long isolation and backwardness. Now the time has come to reinvigorate our spirit. When the Quagga horde gallops, legends of old will come true again!"

CGI_restore_our_hegemony:0 "Restore Our Hegemony"
CGI_restore_our_hegemony_desc:0 "For 300 years, Quaggatai has enjoyed its rightful status as hegemon over northern Zebrica. Then our empire collapsed, and we had to retreat to the steppes. No longer! We are ready once more to strike terror in our foes. Let the Quagga horde gallop, so that we may restore what was lost in 825 ALB."

## War Tree ##

CGI_rally_clans_war:0 "Rally the Clans"
CGI_rally_clans_war_desc:0 "Colthage has once again risen to challenge us, determined to subdue our people. As the defenders of the Quagga, it is our duty to defend against this new threat."

CGI_first_quag_war_effort:0 "The First Quaggan War Effort"
CGI_first_quag_war_effort_desc:0 "If there is one thing that these past decades have taught us, it is that Quaggan is not just a categorical term, it is who we are. For the first time, the Quaggan nation will march to war, not as an alliance of clans, but as one people!"

CGI_khans_army:0 "The Khan's Army"
CGI_khans_army_desc:0 "Khan Zaghu's reforms have been widely successful, laying the seeds for the creation of a modern military force. Now that war has broken out with Colthage, it is time to reap the fruits of our efforts and truly establish the Quaggan army."

CGI_unified_for_struggle:0 "Unified For Struggle"
CGI_unified_for_struggle_desc:0 "Regardless of the petty squabbles of the past, the time has come for Quaggatai to stand united in the face of foreign threat. Colthage seeks to subdue us, to bring down the Quagga, but we will show them the error of their ways."

CGI_new_ideas:0 "New Ideas"
CGI_new_ideas_desc:0 "While the Quagga have a legendary past, the world has moved on. If we are to survive the current struggle with Colthage, we must modernize not just our weapons but our doctrines as well."

CGI_study_captured_guns:0 "Study Captured Guns"
CGI_study_captured_guns_desc:0 "Our clashes with the Colthaginians have seen us capture parts of their arsenal. While most will be put straight into the hooves of our forces, or into the reserve, we should send some back to the cities so that the blacksmiths and philosophers can study them and find out how they tick."

CGI_study_captured_artillery:0 "Study Captured Artillery"
CGI_study_captured_artillery_desc:0 "It turns out that artillery is much more deadly on the battlefield than we first thought, a lesson we have learned first-hoof thanks to the Colthaginians. While we likely won't be able, or even want, to field a full artillery corps, they can at least help defend fortified positions or perhaps help create flying columns..."

CGI_mobilize_khans_stronghold:0 "Mobilize Koltshgar"
CGI_mobilize_khans_stronghold_desc:0 "[CGI.CGI_Mobilize_koltshgar_loc]"
CGI_mobilize_khans_stronghold_khan_desc:0 "As Khan Zaghu's seat of power, and a claimant to the title of "clan", it is necessary for Koltshgar to prove its worth in the face of the doubtful traditionalists. Let's flex those new economic muscles and show the Quagga just what modernity can do."
CGI_mobilize_khans_stronghold_clans_desc:0 "As the former stronghold of Zaghu, Koltshgar has much to do if it wants to prove its worth to the Quagga. Let the former City of Cities prove its might and worthiness to be called a "clan" in the war with Colthage."

CGI_logistics:0 "Motorized Logistics"
CGI_logistics_desc:0 "The biggest hurdle in the way of modern warfare is logistics, an unfortunate fact that heavily restricts our traditional ways of fighting. If we were to motorize our logistical tail, however, we would be able to vastly speed up the flow of supplies, and thus the flow of our zebras."

CGI_wreck_the_frontier:0 "Wreck The Frontier"
CGI_wreck_the_frontier_desc:0 "The Colthaginians have elected to try and completely subjugate us, meaning that we must hold nothing back in return. We shall turn Coltdar and Zrumqi into wastelands, causing them to get bogged down by supply issues and open to counterattack before they even reach the heart of Quaggatai."

CGI_war_to_the_knife:0 "War To The Knife"
CGI_war_to_the_knife_desc:0 "As the war continues to rage, it becomes clear that we are at a disadvantage in terms of population, industry, and overall efficiency compared to the Colthaginians. Yet the difference isn't insurmmountable, and can be overcome by Quaggan tenacity. We just need to dig deep and use everything on hoof. Fight to the last cartridge, then unsheath your knife. That is how we win."

CGI_renew_propaganda_campaigns:0 "Renewed Propaganda Campaigns"
CGI_renew_propaganda_campaigns_desc:0 "As war fervor flags among our people, it is imperative that we maintain the homefront's morale. Certainly there's a massacre, real or imagined, somewhere we could use, right?"

CGI_commit_to_the_war_effort:0 "Commit To The War Effort"
CGI_commit_to_the_war_effort_desc:0 "As the war continues to drag on, one thing that is heavily felt is the constant lack of bodies to put into the line. The clans might not like it, the cities might not like it, and the economy definitely won't like it, but we need more zebras. Send out another round of drafts, this war isn't over until we win."

CGI_cannibalize_the_road:0 "Cannibalize The Diamond Road"
CGI_cannibalize_the_road_desc:0 "The Diamond Road is many things, but right now the only thing that matters is its ability to supply us. Even if it might alienate some of our partners, we can utilize it to get much-needed equipment to our armies. We can rebuild it after victory, but right now we need to win."

CGI_nomadic_fighters:0 "Nomadic Warriors"
CGI_nomadic_fighters_desc:0 "Despite the modernization efforts of the past few decades, Quaggan warfare remains entrenched in the nomadic style. Emphasizing light infantry and small squad tactics, it pushes us to move fast, carry little, and never give the enemy respite."

CGI_ancestral_knowledge:0 "Knowledge Of The Ancestors"
CGI_ancestral_knowledge_desc:0 "Even as technology marches on, the lessons of the past endure for a reason. If asking for tips on fighting from the clans helps soothe their concerns over abandoning the past, even better."

CGI_diamond_road_uses:0 "Utilize The Diamond Road"
CGI_diamond_road_uses_desc:0 "With the shift of the clans to a wartime footing, it is necessary for the Diamond Road to shift as well. We must expand its efforts to supply us and ensure the flow of equipment along it is as strong as possible."

CGI_increase_road_imports:0 "Increase Imports Along The Road"
CGI_increase_road_imports_desc:0 "The Diamond Road remains our strongest line of supply, and must be treated accordingly. The Road must be expanded, our ties with our partners downroad further strengthened."

CGI_urban_conscription:0 "Urban Conscription"
CGI_urban_conscription_desc:0 "While traditionally urban populations have been in an awkward position in terms of what clans they belong to, today is the day they can prove themselves. The cities will provide troops, and in doing so give their inhabitants the chance to prove that they are worthy of being considered clans of their own."

CGI_back_to_colors:0 "Back To The Colors"
CGI_back_to_colors_desc:0 "There exists thousands of veterans within Quaggatai that have elected not to rejoin the fight, doubtlessly due to not having the organizational skills. Fortunately, we can utilize our new bureaucracy to deliver their draft notice straight to their tents and do the boring work for them. Let them rejoice that they can fight for their clans once again."


### IDEAS ###
CGI_diamond_road_modifier:0 "The $CGI_diamond_road$"
CGI_diamond_road_modifier_desc:0 "The Diamond Road is an ancient trade route between Zonicia in the north and Chisimbi in the south, running through Quaggatai and Camelia. Many goods are transported on the road, besides the eponymous diamonds also spices, clothing, gold, slaves and – increasingly – industrial goods. For the relatively poor and underdeveloped Quaggatai, the Diamond Road is an important part of the economy, and a source of materials the nation lacks.\n\nDue to the Storm King's invasion, trade on the Diamond Road collapsed. But with his shackles gone, trade is slowly recovering, while trader zebras work hard to restore it to its former glory. Khan Zaghu also has a heightened interest in its revival, as the taxes from the trade form an important part of government revenue, and the trader zebras are a key base of support for a stronger Khanate."

Since the industrialisation arrived, manufactured goods also make up a significant portion of the trade.\n\nAll of this trade leaves the government with a healthy stipend.

### EVENTS ###

quaggatai.1.t:0 "The Khan"
quaggatai.1.d:0 "Khan Zaghu walked through the halls of the royal palace in Koltshgar. His grandmother, Khatun Malighu, had built it during shortly after she had been elected as khatun, as one of her first reforms. For the most part, it was a simple stone building. Only for the throne room, Malighu had bought expensive marble from Zonicia. Quaggatai wasn't a rich nation, and other investments had been more important.\n\nHe shook his head. For three hundred years, the Quagga had dominated northern Zebrica, and yet, there was little to show for it. They had collected tribute from all over Zonicia, but the every roaming clans had had little interest to invest their gains in marble and stone. And eventually, the hegemony had collapsed, and the Quagga had been banished back to the steppe. The world had moved on without them.\n\nOnly when his grandmother, Khatun Malighu, had united the Khanate once more, Quaggatai had embarked on the much needed journey for modernization. He remembered her fondly. His mother Ephighu had died during his birth, and so he had spent his foalhood with his grandmother. She had been resolute elderly mare, strong and determined, but the clans had opposed her efforts at any opportunity. She had died a little more than ten years ago, and the clans – despite some grumbles – had made him new Khan.\n\nIn these ten years, he had broadly continued her legacy. Cities like Koltshgar, Bucklan and Buckhara were growing, the ancient diamond road trade was thriving and slowly but surely the power of the clans gave way to a stronger central government. The storm king had been a nasty surprise, but ultimately almost useful... or at least as useful as a maniac looter was going to get. Luckily, he had vanished as quickly as he had arrived, and Zaghu's armies had managed to occupy Coltdar in the aftermath.\n\nKhan Zaghu finally made it to the throne room. It would be another busy day of ruling – consulting advisors, hearing petitions and preparing decrees. Quaggatai would need to modernize quickly. Coltdar had been a gamble, and this gamble would see its consequences sooner rather than later..."
quaggatai.1.a:0 "Those who fail to adapt will be swept away."

quaggatai.2.t:0 "The Prisoner"
quaggatai.2.d:0 "Farqeghu neighed in frustration and kicked out with his hind legs. There was a loud clank as his hooves hit the stone, but the walls of his cell didn't move. He kicked out a few more times, both with his front and hind legs to vent his frustration, until the guards came with hay and yogurt for his breakfast. They didn't even bat an eye over his antics. For a moment, he considered kicking these stooges in their stupid faces, but he knew all too well that it wouldn't improve his position.\n\nWith a sigh of resignation, he began slurping his yogurt. How could he have ever been so naïve as to think that Zaghu would be better than his grandmother? Malighu had vastly overstepped her role as Khatun often enough, but she had known limits. Her modernization efforts had infringed on the Quaggan way of life, but she had refrained from all to brazen meddling in the affairs of the other clans. It had been too much goodwill to elect her grandcolt as next Khan...\n\nDespite his initial reconciliatory efforts, Zaghu had soon proven to be even worse than Malighu. But that he would openly refuse to lead the Quagga clans against the Storm King! Not just that, but when the Torquai, Raltung and Muquarili stepped up to at least save Quaggatai's honour, he betrayed them. In a shameful display of unending tyranny, Zaghu used the yeti garrison, tasked with "collecting tribute", to uproot the clan structure that had existed for thousands of years. Even more, he had taken Farqeghu prisoner, the clan leader of a fellow clan! And now, for almost a year, Farqeghu had been stuck here, while Zaghu could run rampant to dismantle the core of Quaggan identity.\n\nBut this was not over! Surely, his loyal zebras already plotted to free him and overthrow the tyrant Khan. It was infuriating that the Khanate had not collapsed immediately under such unprecedented despotic behaviour from a Khan, but there had to be something... right? Farqeghu kicked out against the wall more time before, with another sigh, turning to eat his hay."
quaggatai.2.a:0 "For true Quagga, the clan comes first."

quaggatai.3.t:0 "The Buckharan"
quaggatai.3.d:0 "Eaghu put the letter beside her and stared into the fire. Ever since her sister married Zaghu and moved to the east, they had mostly communicated via mail. And since her brother-in-law had become Khan, even that had gotten sparse. Recently, she had written her again. And now Ohene had replied, with an almost five pages long letter. She twitched her ears, unsure on how to proceed.\n\nTruth be told, the answer didn't satisfy her. Ohene had done little more than repeat the arguments that her husband used all the time – how Quaggatai needed to modernize, how it was necessary to embrace industrialization and that only a stronger Khanate could guarantee the continued independence of the Quagga. This was not wrong, and Eaghu would have been perfectly fine if Zaghu would keep it at that.\n\nBut it was pretty clear to her that he wanted more. He wanted a proper monarchy, to guarantee his foals the right to succession and the continued dominance of the Maklai. Perhaps he also dreamed of conquests. The fact that he had occupied Coltdar in the aftermath of the Storm King certainly pointed in this direction. It was an open invitation to Colthage to declare war, and an even more welcome excuse for him to strengthen his position under the disguise of "mobilization". Was it true that war with Colthage was inevitable, how he – and now also her sister – claimed? It seemed far-fetched to her.\n\nWith the right moves, the Suniquai would earn a good place in the new state. Ohene surely would support that, she said as much in her letter. But was this the right move? Despite the influence of her sister, a stronger Khanate would mean more eastern dominance of Buckhara as well... An all-powerful Koltshgar felt like a step to much.\n\nShe twitched her ears again. The world didn't wait for the indecisive. If she acted now, she could make herself indispensable to the Khan. But was this really what she wanted?"
quaggatai.3.a:0 "In the end, we are all Quagga."

quaggatai.4.t:0 "The Caravaneer"
quaggatai.4.d:0 "Menuhe put the saddlebags down with a sigh of relief. It had been a long trip, from Zawara through Roam and Camelkand, but now they had made station in Zashi. It felt good to finally be on Quaggan soil again. It had been three years... Three years without seeing her foals. How much would they have grown? A lot, probably. Would Elohe still be so careless in combing her mane? Maybe Ranu had managed to civilize her... Ranu, her husband... How much she missed him! It would be one more month until the caravan would finally reach Koltshgar and she would be able to embrace him again. And her foals as well. She let her head hang low. One more month...\n\nStrange how times changed. When she grew up, she had always been part of her mother's caravan. In fact, she had not been born in Quaggatai at all, but in a small desert village in the middle of Camelia. She had been with the caravan her whole foalhood, and never even a single moment would her mother have thought of leaving her at home. They were trade zebras, and the little filly would just trot along with the caravan. At least they hadn't given her a saddlebag back then.\n\nAnd now? When she had married Ranu, he had first joined her caravan. But after she had born their first foal, he wanted to settle down. The city of Koltshgar had been growing rapidly at the time, and more and more jobs were available there. She had agreed to stay with him in Koltshgar as long as Elohe needed her milk, but she was a trader... She could not just settle down. Ranu had found good work, as a scribe for the growing palace bureaucracy, and so they parted. Not forever, never forever, but always for long.\n\nEven Quaggatai wasn't safe of modernity, it seemed. For her grandmother, the idea of a Quagga settling down would have been just preposterous. Well, grandma had always been a bit narrow-minded, condemning Malighu's reforms... but still. Koltshgar had now grown to be a true city, rivalling those in the north in Zonicia. Would all Quagga just become like the zebras in the north? Surely not – Quaggatai didn't have the farmland for that.\n\nWith one more sigh, she opened her saddlebags. Unpolished diamonds looked rather inconspicuous, but they would make a good price in Colthage. The caravan had bought a lot of goods in the south. Gems, gold, spices. In Roam they also had bought some slaves. Colthaginian landowner would pay well for them. It was a long journey, time and time again, but it also sure was profitable..."
quaggatai.4.a:0 "And the caravan moves, restless, to keep the trade flowing."

quaggatai.5.t:0 "The Sole Republican"
quaggatai.5.d:0 "Telohe looked around in the room. It was rather shabby, with a few chairs, a bookshelf, a desk and a filing cabinet. All in all, it looked more like a book club rather than the head quarter of a political party. And if she was completely honest to herself, it probably wouldn't become more for a long time.\n\nShe sighed. When she founded the Quaggan Republican Movement five years ago, it had just been her. By now, she had a small group of friends, but it wasn't really a party by any metric – it really was little more than a literary coffee circle a fancy name. And even the name barely held together... Her friend Mohe, who served as the secretary, had argued multiple times that the Hippogriffs had made rather positive experiences with their monarchy. Telohe had answered that Quaggatai was missing the tradition of monarchical restraint that the Hippogriffs had. In the end, they had reached the compromise that they would accept a constitutional monarchy as an intermediate step towards Harmony. She shook her head. They really were a republican movement where half the members weren't even republican.\n\nA month ago, they had finally published their manifesto. And yesterday, she had received some mail from the government. At first, she had freaked out about it – as Khan Zaghu was not too gentle with dissidents – but the letter, to her complete surprise, had been rather positive. "In his efforts to strengthen Quaggatai's national identity, His Majesty has seen fit to support movements that promote a pan-Quaggan viewpoint." had the letter started. As a result, she now got a lump sum of Colthaginian zhekels each month and also the room she was just standing in. It wouldn't be quite enough that she could give up her job and invest all her efforts into the movement, but it would help a great deal.\n\nAfter scratching her mane for a while, she decided that the first purchase from the new money would be some more comfortable club chairs to replace the wooden ones. She had seen a collection of old fauteuils at the market. And in the meeting next week, she would tell the others of their new income. Although, thinking about it, it was rather strange for a republican movement to get its funding from the monarchy it wanted to abolish..."
quaggatai.5.a:0 "Their ideas might seem outlandish, but they have their uses."

quaggatai.6.t:0 "The Heir"
quaggatai.6.d:0 "When Moghu trotted to his lectures this morning, he could barely hold his head straight. The cinder yesterday had not been a good idea. And neither had been the Macawian rum. But this had been yesterday. Today, he would need to learn about some intricacies of military logistics or similar nonsense. And if he wanted to avoid embarrassing himself before his sister, he would also need to not fall asleep. With how heavy his head felt, this was easier said than done.\n\nAlane was a little under two years younger than him and always organized, on time and frighteningly competent in every subject. He would have been very impressed, if it wouldn't be so annoying. He always felt so inadequate when talking to her. It would have been less of a problem if she had been older than him, but with him being the firstborn, this meant that he was the heir apparent. He had floated the idea with his father to make Alane the heir, but Zaghu had told him that his was not an option. The clans practised strict primogeniture, and he would just need to get his act together.\n\n"Hi Moghu!" The sudden voice of his sister made him jump a step to the side. "Have you remembered to write the essay on distributed supply networks?" He vaguely remembered that this had been a thing. At first, he wanted to flair his nostrils, but it would be of no avail – she would find out soon anyways. He slowly shook his head. "Thought so. Well, you still have around half an hour. Take this, but don't make it too obvious." She gave him some papers. It was her essay, for him to copy. That was perhaps the worst part – on top of all her qualities, she was also friendly and helpful. It only made him feel even more useless, especially because he knew very well that he didn't have a choice.\n\nAround twenty-five minutes later, he gave her the papers back. His essay wouldn't be as good as hers, but it would not have been fair to copy everything. His own ideas were lacking at best, and he knew it, but in total it would be enough to cover up that he had forgotten to write the essay in time. Why, by all things between Iszkarha's heavenly realm and Ilghunha's endless steppe, did he have to learn about distributed supply networks in the first place?"

quaggatai.7.d:0 ""Your plan seems risky." Ohene remarked.\n\nZaghu nodded slightly. The map before him showed the clans of Quaggatai, with figurines representing the various friends and enemies within each clan. "Things will come to a conclusion soon," he answered, "at the latest when Colthage moves." His muzzle scrunched when he looked to the top of the map. "They can't possibly ignore Coltdar forever. Until then the dominos must have fallen."\n\nHis wife stepped closer to the map. "Don't overtake yourself. The defeat of the Torquai and Muquarili has given you the upper hoof for now, but the clans are still strong. And they don't forget." She slightly tilted her head. "I have told you about the letter from my sister, right? She might be mostly loyal to your cause, but even she isn't free from doubts."\n\n"I know, I know." He stared intensely at the little figurine representing Eaghu, as if he tried to read her mind by proxy. "As long as she stays neutral... this is all I need. Farqeghu is secured in house arrest, and the Torquai are still licking their wounds. The Senar are our friends, and Opheghu knows very well that the Raltung have never forgiven them for seceding. But this is only one half of the equation anyways." He shuffled around some figures wearing saddlebags. "Here lies my real strength. The traders know that their future looks brighter in a unified Quaggan state. The cities as well. Times are changing."\n\n"But have they changed enough already?" Ohene asked. "And you might think you have masterfully outplayed the Storm King's armies against your opponents, but the cities remember the... tribute they had to pay. They haven't turned against you yet, but your submission to the Storm King came at a cost. Not that it was wrong." She sighed. "It would have been a folly to have everything we build so far destroyed. And yet, we have to tread carefully. I know you are ambitious, my Khan, but we need to secure our gains, slow and steady." She stretched her neck, trying to kiss him on his muzzle.\n\nZaghu didn't react, his eyes still locked on the map. "Quaggatai stands at the crossroads." he mumbled."

quaggatai.8.t:0 "A Free Horde?"
quaggatai.8.d:0 "Khan Zaghu let himself drop into his chair. It was one of the boring but necessary tasks of a modern Khan to read the reports of his various informants, especially if he wanted to get the clans under control. The Khanate employed many informants – some were highly official magistrates fulfilling their entrusted duties and reporting back to the capital, others were trader zebras who visited many herds, getting a picture of public sentiment in the process, and even others were loyalists willing to work with the government against potential traitors. All of them sent letters upon letters, which needed to be read, sorted, and – at times – acted upon. To get the workload under control, most letters first went to trusted advisors, who compiled them into reports for Khan Zaghu to read. It was still way too much reading for his taste, he thought as he tried to make himself comfy with the folders before him.\n\nBut not much later, he was entirely absorbed into the reports. It seemed the anti-clan and pan-Quaggan propaganda had borne an unexpected result. As more and more Quagga questioned the authority of the clan leaders, not all turned to the Khan for leadership. Instead, the "Free Horde Movement" was spreading in some herds. The characterization given was vague and at times contradictory. The movement was described as being opposed to both clans and Khan, rejecting any notion of leadership by birthright. While some described it as pan-Quaggan, others characterized it as extremely decentralized and focused on the herds. Moreover, all reports agreed that the movement had no single leader, although it remained unclear if this was a genuine feature or simply a lack of organization.\n\nKhan Zaghu flicked his ears. At the moment, the Free Horde seemed entirely irrelevant, and fighting it would be both costly and – due to its decentralized nature – nigh impossible. And even more, in its current form, it bound the resources of clan leaders much more than those of the central government. He flared his nostrils. Perhaps some tacit support..."

quaggatai.9.t:0 "Inquiries About The Free Horde"
quaggatai.9.d:0 "When the "Free Horde Movement" first appeared in government reports, Khan Zaghu had not thought much of it. They were outliers at the edge of political discourse, with strange ideas, as turbulent times so often bred. Since then, they had shown up again from time to time, and he had become curious enough to inquire further into their beliefs.\n\nAccording to his sources, the "Free Horde" rejected the clan system as well as the Khanate. Instead, they wanted Quaggatai to be a collection of free-roaming herds, united only by some sort of assembly. Any notion of leadership – whether by birthright or by election – was eyed with suspicion, instead, every herd, or even every zebra, was to be given maximal freedom to act as they pleased. The movement was pan-Quaggan only as far as it was anti-clanist, and cared little for the traditions or even the Gods. Furthermore, most in the movement also wanted to abolish personal property beyond the immediate belongings, and showed a disdain for consumption of any kind.\n\nSurprisingly, Khan Zaghu had found the movement in both the nomadic clans and the cities, although there were some deviations between the two. While both were against singular leadership and authority in general, the nomadic side of the movement was more interested in decentralization and limiting any interference by a government, the urban side focused instead on the abolition of private ownership.\n\nTrue to the beliefs of its members, the movement had no organized leadership, instead relying on a few signals with which members identified each other, and its spread seemed to be driven by muzzle-to-muzzle propaganda. Due to this, the clan leaders, already embattled by the centralization efforts, had reacted with blind panic, sometimes trying to coax back their followers while at other times unleashing violent suppression. For Khan Zaghu, these developments had played right into his hoof. The only remaining question was how far he was willing to go in exploiting this opportunity."

quaggatai.10.t:0 "A Letter From The Khan"
quaggatai.10.d:0 "Opheghu all but knew what Khan Zaghu had written to her before even opening the letter. In the current political climate, it didn't take a lot of effort to come to the right conclusions – he would speak of the friendship between their clans and ask for her help. She shook her head and took his letter into her hoof. The only question remaining was how much help he would ask for, and how much she was willing to give him. \n\nAfter reading the letter herself, she decided to show it to her shaman. The Khan's demands had stayed reasonable – some warriors for the royal guard, her support for a few royal decrees and some officers send to the royal war academy for training. But it was clear that they would not stay this way. Zaghu wanted more, much more, and expected the Senar clan to go along with it, perhaps even to act as an example for the other clans to follow.\n\nShe found Kehir, her shaman, in his tent, where he was receiving the sick and wounded. He greeted her with a nod, gesturing for her to wait. After having given out many balms and herbs, he closed his tent, and without a further word, she hooved him the letter. As he read it, his ears flicked and tail swished, but he stayed quiet.\n\nWhen he was finished, he closed his eyes for a few seconds. At last, he spoke with a calm voice: "You require divine council? There is nothing to be done. Fulfil the demands of the Khan, and don't brood over what you could do. The times are changing, for the gods don't value the complacent. He has their favour, for now. If he stays humble and devout, he will keep it. Yes, the clans will lose much of their autonomy, and perhaps in a few years, Quaggan society will be unrecognizable. As you know, the Senar are the smallest clan, and our ascension was much contested. But now, it can be our strength – as we can't lay claim to national leadership, our best bet is to secure a good position in whatever is coming next."\n\nOpheghu bowed her head. Much of what Kehir had said had already been on her mind. But why was it so hard for her to act accordingly?"

quaggatai.11.t:0 "A Train Trip"
quaggatai.11.d:0 "The train arrived with a loud whistle. It chugged through the landscape, roaring, as if it wanted to announce the changing times. Hene waited at the freshly opened train station in Koltshgar, along many other zebras, most of whom, like her, saw a train for the first time in their lives. How often had she galloped to Buckhara? How many caravans had she been part of, making the arduous trek, five days long, and with heavy saddlebags? And how often had she cursed during those journeys through the endless steppes, be it about the weight, the heat or the strong winds?\n\nBut now... She should be enthusiastic, she told herself. From five days down to not even one day, and without a saddlebag at that! A single train transported more goods than an entire caravan, and with comparatively low costs at that. No weight, no heat, no wind. Now she could spend her days at the markets, getting better prices for her wares, or simply at home with her family. Well, she continued her thought, it wasn't quite as easy yet, as the train stopped in Buckhara. To get the staples to Agzhat or Tobuck they would still need a caravan. But the tracks were laid, both literally and figuratively, and the future belonged trains, not for caravans.\n\nShe had never thought of herself as a nostalgic zebra. What had she laughed at clanzebras when they complained about their waning autonomy, calling them backwards and lost in the past. But it seemed that in every zebra's life there was something that was considered so utterly natural that seeing it challenged was most difficult. Progress might have come for the clans first, but now it had come for her.\n\nHene boarded the train, together with more than two hundred other zebras. The guard provided them with hay, yogurt and water. Through the window, she could see the grasslands passing by. Occasionally, she could spot a zebra herd on the outside, although never a caravan. What moving times we live in, she thought."

quaggatai.12.d:0 ""You have called, Khan, and my troops are ready." Ianeghu, leader of the Usoken clan, stood before Zaghu's throne. "It seems you have finally found a war worth fighting," he added with a slight smile. The Khan decided not to respond to this tease, but rather just gave a dismissive nod. Flicking his tail in annoyance, the clan leader continued: "As is tradition, I will lead my warriors to war."\n\nThis time, Zaghu responded: "This is indeed your right and duty. As is also tradition, I will be the supreme commander of the Quagga horde when it gallops to war. Therefore, you are invited to join the meetings of the general staff. I expect your troops to train alongside the rest of ours, and I'm sure they will meet our expectations."\n\nIaneghu waved his hoof dismissively. "My loyal clanszebras are the best fighters in Quaggatai, and will put the royal guard you build up – on state coffers, I might add – to shame. After I have inspected the quarters of my warriors, I shall join your council. As much as we might disagree on matters of policy, Colthage must be destroyed."\n\nThe Usokene turned around and trotted out of the room. Zaghu's eyes lingered on him, pondering how to proceed. Ianeghu was, just like the other clan leaders, displeased by the increasing centralization of the realm. His attitude and lack of respect showed that he still tried to treat the Khan as a primus inter pares, as some claimed the old Khans had been. Many of the other clan leaders had responded similarly to his request. Ebighu, leader of the Torquai clan, had preferred not to answer at all, and Farqeghu of the Muquarili still rotted in his cell. Integrating all of these troops would not be easy, but it was a necessary evil."

quaggatai.13.d:0 "Telohe put down the letter and stared into the distance. She should have known something like this was coming. Why else would Khan Zaghu fund her "party"? Even she herself found it difficult to apply this label, as it really felt more like a political book club with occasional ventures into writing pamphlets or petitions. But without more zebras to join the cause...\n\nAnd now this. Zaghu wanted to hold a grant ceremony to grand the city of Koltshgar the status of its own clan, and for this ceremony she was invited. Not only that, he even "gave her the honour" – in other words: demanded of her – to give a speech, which unsurprisingly she was to send in beforehoof to get it checked by his advisors. Of course, she could refuse. She could try to decline the invitation, or at least the speech, as friendly as possible, and hope that it would not cause trouble. But despite what the government claimed about funding Pan-Quaggan movements, she knew that the real motive of the Khan was probably more to strengthen his positions in the city, and to appeal to all those unsatisfied with the status quo.\n\nThe open question was how much he would actually be able to achieve. While he could accept Koltshgar as its own clan in his capacity as leader of the Maklai, the other seven clans would never agree to this, and there was little he could do to force them. Not only that, but Koltshgar didn't even have a dominant family to be elevated to clan leader. The mayor didn't traditionally follow a family line, and none of them had attempted to claim a royal name. Even if Zaghu pressured the current mayor, such a move would simply provoke fears and envy from other important families in Koltshgar, hence why the Khan was unlikely to even push for it.\n\nShe sighed. In the end, it was all sound and fury. A lot of words, but little real change. Accepting the inevitable, she grabbed a pen and started writing her speech. The only thing left to figure out was how much call for reform was expected of her, and how much would land her in a dungeon."

quaggatai.14.t:0 "From Slave To Soldier"
quaggatai.14.d:0 "The sun peeked over the hills in the distance. The drill sergeant shouted something, prompting Loyiso to sling the gun over his shoulder. His hoof was still shaking slightly, as he had cried tears of joy since yesterday evening: He had been brought free by the Khan, to serve in the royal guard.\n\nFor two years, he had worn an iron collar, signifying his status as a slave, ever since he had been captured by Roaman slave hunters during a raid on his home village. He had eaten mostly dry hay since, only occasionally being able to graze some fresh grass. His flanks were marred by scars, having tasted the whip all too often as the slave traders treated him and his fellows barely differently from livestock. He had been bought by Quaggan merchants, and brought northward through the Camelian desert. The trip had been pure torture, under the scorching hot sun, packed as tightly like the lowest mule and on scarce rations of hay and water. Three days ago they had arrived in Koltshgar, and he had seen no future for himself any more other than to toil on the fields of a Colthaginian landowner until his early death.\n\nBut yesterday evening, his fortunes had changed again. A bulky-looking Quagga had arrived at the merchant's quarter and bought up many slaves, including him. Afterwards, he was given his first real meal in two years, fresh hay, plenty of flavourful herbs, and, true to the local cuisine, lots of fresh yogurt. During the meal, the bulky Quagga had explained to him and the other former slaves that they had been selected in Khan Zaghu's latest plan to bolster the royal guard, and that training would start tomorrow.\n\nThe drill sergeant continued to bellow commands in Quaggan, forcing Loyiso to imitate his peers as he couldn't understand the language. They marched across the training field, causing his mind to wander. Ultimately, he decided, he was still little more than a slave, having been bought to serve in the military of a foreign nation. But over the soft bed this night and the good breakfast in the morning – even if it was very early – he was willing to take it. What more could he hope for in this cruel world?"

quaggatai.15.d:0 "Abizaal Zeugorid looked around in his new room. It was small, but more comfortable than he had imagined these savages to be capable of. When Menuhe had invited him to come to Koltshgar, he had been very reluctant. Leaving his comfortable office job in Zur to travel to foreign lands? No thanks! But she had insisted and increased the price, and in the end it had been a matter of Zhekels.\n\nAnd now he was here, to teach the rowdy nomads about economics and modern bookkeeping. Admittedly, Koltshgar had not looked as bad as the stories in Colthage made it seem. The merchant's quarters even had a certain charm to them, and showed off an impressive level of wealth. Perhaps it was time that they learned to keep their books in order…\n\nCertainly, he was the right zebra to teach them, he thought proudly. Twenty-five years he had worked for Zur's largest dockyard, having climbed the ranks from minor clerk all the way to head accountant. Purchases, sales, tax accounts, shareholder dividends – everything had gone over his desk. And of course, he had collected and published the quarterly reports for the stock market.\n\nThe next day, Abizaal wandered through the city. It was in many ways a city of contradictions. On one hoof, there were plenty of primitive workshops, displaying the primitive nature of Quaggan society, but on the other hoof there was certainly a developing industrial presence. He also saw a surprising number of Colthaginian faces on the streets. At lunch in a restaurant, he took the opportunity to speak to several of the other Colthaginians present. All of them were specialists, often recruited similarly to him, ranging from mathematicians, engineers and doctors to teachers and philosophers. It seemed, he thought, as though the Quaggan savages were at least eager to modernize."

Since the start of his tenure, he had supported Pan-Quaggan organisations of all kinds, both secretly and overtly, and had ramped up such operations after the Storm King had left. And the data his administration had gathered showed that it was working. In the cities especially, the zebras identified more with Quaggatai as a whole than with their city or clan.\n\nOver the past few weeks, he and his advisors had identified even more potential supporters. The newly established University of Koltshgar had spawned the "Historical Society", a group of professors and interested individuals researching and promoting the past glory of Quaggatai. Many of them were already sympathetic to Zaghu, and with a bit more funding he could ensure that they spread his reading of history.\n\nOf course, they were not the only ones. Newspapers had been unknown for a long time in Quaggan society, but they had expanded in popularity recently. Unsurprisingly, they were most spread in the cities, and a large variety of newly-minted journalists and essayists had started to spread their wide variety of opinions. While Zaghu had been quick to issue censorship laws to stop any serious anti-government propaganda from gaining traction, even among the remaining newspapers it would be advantageous to make sure some were more successful than others.\n\nAfter half an hour of reading, Khan Zaghu scribbled some notes on the reports, before hoofing them to a servant to take them back to his subordinates.

The timing was also most unfortunate, as the other clan leaders had become increasingly agitated with his rule. Perhaps he had relied on their goodwill too much, or given too much autonomy, but power seemed to slip from his hooves.\n\nAnd Farqeghu would make all of this quite a bit worse. He had never had a good relationship with the Muquarili leader, as the pesky stallion seemed to criticise every move he made. Of course, there was a long history behind this. The Muquarili thought of themselves as the natural leaders of the western – Buckharan – clans, something that the Suniquai very much opposed. By marrying Ohene, sister of the Suniquai's clan leader Eaghu, Farqeghu had become his natural rival.\n\nAll of that had been amplified because of the Storm King's invasion. While Zaghu had bided his time, seeing the folly in trying to oppose the mad yeti, Farqeghu had rallied his zebras, and together with Teaghu, then clan leader of the Torquai, tried to incite a rebellion. It had not gone well for either of them: Teaghu had died and Farqeghu had fallen into the Khan's hooves. As a prime opportunity to make real progress in centralizing Quaggatai, he had eagerly exploited their failure, but of course this was under the assumption that the Torquai and Muquarili would not be able to oppose him anymore.

Even though you have cowardly thrown away Quaggatai's honour before the Storm King, it is clear for everyzebra to see that you yourself tried to provoke a war with Colthage by occupying Coltdar. What other reason can you give? It is nothing but a political ploy to justify interference in the affairs of clans other than your own. Your tyranny ends now, and Iskarha willing, Quaggatai can go back to its good old days."\n\nZaghu seemed more than ready to give a strong reply, but Ianeghu was quicker: "Quiet, Farqeghu! In your prison cell, you have lost sight of the situation we find ourselves in. The occupation of Coltdar is not the reason we are here today, and its status will be discussed at a later time. For now, the clan council will act as a group. For now, I would suggest adjourning the meeting to a later date." Turning to the former Khan, he added: "Thank you for your services."\n\nNozebra in the room looked like to have any gratitude in mind, but most nodded to meet later.

With a sigh, she added: "Mother was right."\n\nMoghu's mind wandered to a conversation two days ago. After his father's forced abdication, they had quickly moved out of Koltshgar and joined a roaming herd of the Maklai clan. It had been an unusual, but refreshing experience for the young prince to sleep in a tent rather than a bedroom, but apart from that, he hadn't thought much of it yet. Father was still leader of the largest clan, so even if some plans of his didn't come to pass, there was little to worry about. Two days ago, he and Alane had overheard their parents discuss. The first meeting of the council of clans had been scheduled, and Ohene begged Zaghu to not go, to make whatever excuses he needed. But Father had not listened, insisting that he would continue to represent the interests of the Maklai.\n\nIt had been a trap. It didn't even matter who exactly ordered the assassination. Farqeghu was the most likely candidate, but the other clan leaders were not exactly on good terms with Zaghu either, save for Opheghu or Eaghu maybe. Nor was there any chance the mystery would ever be solved, or bear consequences, Moghu thought bitterly. Instead, Alane was right as always. He would now need to hide before assassins, or perhaps they all needed to hide.\n\nHe could hear Alane trying to comfort Ohene. Without a word, he trotted towards their tent.

However, as Colthage was fighting internally, unwilling or unable to start the war, Zaghu ultimately had to pull the trigger himself.\n\nThese thoughts and more flashed through the Khan's mind as he stood at the war table. Ohene stood by his side, this time not as his wife, but as his general. Her expression was stern, but occasional ear flicks showed her nervousness. Other generals, like Onuk and Aiene, showed their emotions more openly. Onuk was especially eager to kick the Colthaginians in their flank – something he emphasized by occasionally kicking his hind legs. Aiene was the polar opposite, crunching her muzzle in doubt about the feasibility of the war plan.\n\nZaghu flicked his tail. It wouldn't matter, the plan was there and all generals would do their part. Operation Ivaghu was now in full swing, and it would only end in Colthage."
quaggatai.21.d_clans:0 ""Well, Farqeghu, it seems like you have been outvoted." Ianeghu looked over at the fuming clan leader of the Muquarili. "The war plans are ready, and any more waiting would be a waste of time. We might have expected Colthage to attack, but it seems they got caught up in internal matters. We shall give them a rude awakening." After a short pause, he continued: "And I have to admit, I don't entirely get your stance. You were so eager to fight the Storm King that you galloped straight into your doom. And now you refuse outright?"\n\nLashing his tail in anger, Farqeghu answered: "The Storm King was here to plunder, and Zaghu had no better idea than to hoof him all our riches for free. This here is a war of aggression. We should be happy that Colthage is too busy to care about Coltdar, and instead we will unite them against us. If the Storm King had not finished us, this surely will, and we will have nozebra to blame but ourselves."\n\nThe other clan leaders looked uncomfortable between the two stallions. Besides Farqeghu, only Ebighu had voted against the war, but it seemed the others who had voted in favour did not quite share Ianeghu's enthusiasm. Roghu had made a case of cold pragmatism, a war to secure Zaghu's gains as long as the Zonicians fought amongst themselves. The other northern clan leaders, Opheghu, Eaghu, and Esighu's regent Asene had joined her reasoning, decisively swinging the vote. Eventually, ignoring the increasingly loud voices of Ianeghu and Farqeghu, Roghu spread out the war planning map. The commanders were briefed and the troops were ready. There was no going back now."

quaggatai.22.t:0 "Diamond Road Trade Collapses"
quaggatai.22.d:0 "The news of the war reached the traders' quarter mere hours after fighting broke out along the northern border. Immediately, the zebras broke out into a frenzy, trying to salvage their investments, recall caravans heading towards the war zone or save their stocks already in Colthage. After the initial chaos died down, more concerted efforts began. Most traders agreed that with the northern cities – for the time being – unreachable, the western route over Buckhara and Zarantia towards Tobuck was the next best chance.\n\nNonetheless, as government reports showed, the impact on the Diamond Road was severely damaging. Zarantia and Tobuck had their own trade routes, mostly through the Zebharan desert, and the Buckharan link could not handle the additional cargo. Early estimates concluded a loss of a third of the volume, and half of the profits of the Diamond Road. Additionally, Colthage had seized much of the stock present in their territories, causing massive depreciation of assets for Quaggan merchants. Among the trader communities, hopes were high that it could eventually be rebuilt after the war was over, but for the moment, both they and the government would need to reel from much-shrunken margins."

quaggatai.23.t:0 "A New Royal Oracle"
quaggatai.23.d:0 "For fifty years, Aitene had stood as an institution at the court. As royal oracle, she had always been present, offering advice and guidance in both spiritual and temporal matters. Oracles, the interpreters of the divine will, already played an important role in Quaggan culture, their duties combining those of priest, doctor, and scholar. But Aitene had had an even greater role than most. She had served as the closest personal advisor to Zaghu's grandmother, Khatun Melighu. As royal physician, she had acted as midwife during Zaghu's birth, and although she couldn't save the life of Zaghu's mother, she at least saved his. She had been there throughout Zaghu's foalhood, and she had been there still when he took the throne. She knew everyone and everything at the court, no secret being safe from her.\n\nAnd now she was dead.\n\nA servant had informed the Khan early in the morning of her death, slipping quietly into the room, as if afraid to speak the news aloud. And yet, her death could hardly be said to be surprising. She had been over eighty years old, and lately quite often unwell, delegating more and more tasks to her acolyte. For a long time, she had been stubborn about this point as well: normally, an oracle was expected to take an acolyte to pass on their knowledge. Upon the death of the oracle the acolyte would become the new oracle and take a new acolyte, continuing the cycle. However, Aitene had refused to take an acolyte for a long time, after her first acolyte had died from a fever many decades ago. Only a few years ago, as she had felt more and more clearly the weight of age creeping up on her, she had finally relented, taking a colt named Arteq as her acolyte.\n\nAnd by the divine rules of the Quaggan gods, Arteq was now the new royal oracle. He was barely twenty years old, very eager to learn and full of admiration for Aitene. Zaghu knew him quite well. It would not be hard to secure Arteq's loyalty, and despite his youth he had already learned a substantial amount. Of course, he lacked much of the stature Aitene had at the court, but that was not necessarily a drawback."

There had been looting, but he had made sure it had been an organized affair, the confiscation of assets and their redistribution. His troops would get their share, but afterwards he needed Colthage intact. He had plans for the city, for its people.\n\n"My Khan, I trust you will keep your word?" Asene of the Morituq asked as she sidled up next to Zaghu. "Our warriors have fought hard for this victory, and faced the brunt of many a Colthaginian raid."\n\nZaghu smiled and nodded. "Of course, my friend. While Quaggatai may see great change, I remember those who supported me. Morituq lands will be formally extended into Ispardur, and your warriors will be richly rewarded with plunder. Perhaps you would like to loot the Zarca estates yourself?"\n\nAsene's tail flicked excitedly at the prospect, the Morituq regent clearly relishing the prestige she had earned both for and within her clan. "It would be my pleasure, my Khan."\n\nZaghu once again nodded as Asene trotted off, returning his attention to the streets as he came down to the docks of Colthage. As the sparkling blue water of the Round Harbour reflected the sunlight, he saw the great ships of the former Colthaginian Navy. His knees buckled, only sheer force of will keeping him from collapsing. Despite months of increasingly favorable reports, of surrendering Colthaginian units, of the fall of city after city, it had never felt quite real to him. But here, in the heart of Colthaginian power with their famous fleet before him? Where the seemingly infinite ocean met the Bay of Zam? Now it felt real. He let out a heavy sigh, forcing his knees to straighten as he looked into the sky. He wasn't the most religious Quagga, but he still knew a divine blessing when he saw it.\n\n"O Furious Aramahe, O Resolute Ilghunha, O Iszkarha, Highest Upon High, I give praise to thee!""

quaggatai_camelia.1.t:0 "The Situation In Camelia"
quaggatai_camelia.1.d:0 "As long as the Diamond Road has existed, our camels have been the partners and friends of our trade zebras. Oftentimes, caravans are made up of zebras and camels in equal parts, and no caravan can hope to cross the Camelian desert without camel support. That is not to say that our history was free of struggles – in the old days, especially in times without a Khan, the southern clans, particularly the Usoken, fought with the camels over land and resources, and also to collect tribute from the caravaneers. However, these times are long gone, and Khatun Malighu as well as Khan Zaghu have tried to foster friendship to our southern neighbours.\n\nBut as is so often the case, the Storm King's ravaging has left nothing but chaos in Camelia. In Camelkand, the traditional capital of Camelia, a former Storm King general with the name of Boltrus has proclaimed a kingdom bearing his name. In south-western Camelia, some camels under High Chieftess Dromedar have seceded, and it seems only a matter of time until the fate of the camels is decided by arms.\n\nThis situation leaves our traders in a pickle. The main trade routes go through Camelkand, and therefore through what is now the Boltrian Kingdom. But while Boltrus has established himself as a relatively peaceful and just ruler, many in Quaggatai – and in fact most of the Storm King's former subjects – distrust the yeti. We could push forward with a diplomatic mission to dispel some of this distrust. From that, we could expect our main trade route to run more smoothly, which should boost the Diamond Road nicely. On the other hoof, we can be sure that High Chieftess Dromedar will not forget our betrayal, in case the free camels triumph over Boltrus.\n\nThe other approach is to throw our support behind the free camels. This would be easier to justify, both domestically and abroad, but the benefits to our current trade route would be minor. But if the free camels manage to win with our support, we could be sure to have built a lasting and very profitable friendship."

quaggatai_camelia.2.d:0 "In a surprising turn of events, our northern neighbour Quaggatai has reached out to us. For a long time, they have been vocal critics of our King Boltrus, decrying him as a continued yeti occupier – something that could not be further from the truth. Now, however, it seems that they have realized that our kingdom isn't going anywhere, and so are asking for a rapprochement.\n\nTheir primary concern is the Diamond Road, an important trade route which runs through Camelkand. Camels and Quaggan zebras have often formed caravans together, and this continues to this day. Therefore, they want to ensure that we treat these caravans kindly and freely allow our camel traders to participate.\n\nOn the surface, the deal they offer us seems rather good. The expected increase in trade would benefit our fiscal coffers too, not to mention our upcoming struggles with the Free Camel Tribes, which we had so far expected the Quagga to support. But we still have a choice – perhaps sometimes it is better to stand alone."

Of course, despite the lofty name, the friendship exists largely on paper, and many Quagga have already started to question this diplomatic U-turn. But despite these remaining difficulties, we can expect trade on the Diamond Road to increase significantly, which of course was our goal.\n\nNow, the question remains whether we want to go a step further, and actually support the Boltrians against the Free Camel Tribes to secure the deal we have just gained. Considering the still lingering distrust, this would come at severe political costs, but sometimes pragmatism has to trump all feelings."

Or, as one of our envoys put it while kicking out with his hind legs in anger, "the stupid yeti was just not feeling it". Suffice it to say, the news was not taken too well at court, and those who warned of sending a mission to the Boltrian Kingdom in the first place saw their opinion validated.\n\nWhile the whole affair was something of an embarrassment, there is now only one logical course of action, namely, to send a mission instead to the Free Camel Tribes. Our immediate benefits will not be as large, but if they manage to triumph over the Boltrians, we might have a much friendlier neighbour to the south than King Boltrus would ever have been."

The camels and steppe zebras can look back on a long history of cooperation, especially with regard to the Diamond Road, a trade route running from Chisimbi in the south through Camelkand and Koltshgar towards Zonicia. For centuries, the Diamond Road has been a cornerstone of our economy, just as much as it was for the Quagga. When the Storm King invaded, trade collapsed, and even now it is still only slowly rebounding. But while our nation lies shattered and our capital is occupied by a Yeti – one that claims to speak for all camels no less – Quaggatai has been hard at work to restore the trade route.\n\nOur division left the Quagga in a difficult position, as the main trade route runs through occupied Camelkand. But luckily, they have seen reason and realized that negotiating with the Yeti would do them no good. Instead, the envoy now brings an offer of support and cooperation, something that will surely benefit both of our nations."

But at the same time, we should not get distracted, as to our north the zebras of Zonicia still prepare for war with us. Only time will tell how much we can afford to spend on our camel friends."

Yet, among the wider public, there was little reaction – while most had accepted the rapprochement with the yeti, few had come to like it.\n\nOver the following days, a little delegation was send to Camelkand, congratulating Boltrus on his victory. Amid diplomatic pleasantries, the earlier treaties were reinforced with new agreements, although the effect was expected to be minor.

In the market halls where caravans would organize themselves, one could observe frantic negotiations, as the prices for trade goods previously transported in large quantities shot up.\n\nIn light of these developments, various petitions reached the government, both for emergency relief and for diplomatic negotiations to salvage Quaggatai's relationship with the camels.

These dreams had now proven themselves to be built on sand, and the profits would never come.\n\nYet, as much as some dreams might have gotten shattered, the impact on trade would likely not be overly dramatic. Yes, Camelkand was in Boltrus' hands, but this was nothing new, and caravans had gotten used to it. There would perhaps be some be slightly more distrust between the new and old king and Quaggatai, but considering the prior mediocre relationship, it wouldn't make much of a difference.

Not only had Zaghu's ambitions not been his downfall, he had somehow led Quaggatai to victory and had conquered Colthage. If what his guards said was true, even now he was planning a ceremony to crown himself king. Farqeghu huffed again. If he did that, the Quagga as they had been for centuries would truly be dead. Traditional Quaggan culture would be gone.\n\nHe was brought out of his reverie, the sound of hushed voices where his guards stood watch filtering into his prison.

The Khan's personal army, alongside the Morituq, Raltung, and Senar, took heavier losses than the clans further away from the battlefield. Rumors abound that some of the clans, such as the Muquarili and Torquai, maneuvered for this to happen to weaken the Khan's position, although no evidence has been found. Regardless, the issue of honors has become another point of contension between the pro-Khan forces of Quaggan society and its opposers.

quaggatai_history.1.t:0 "History Of The Maklai Clan"
quaggatai_history.1.d:0 "Current Clan Leader: Zaghu\n\nThe Maklai clan prides itself on being the oldest existing clan of the Quagga, and indeed its origins are shrouded in legend and mystery. The clan leaders of the Maklai claim decent from the mystical Parcaghu, son of Iszkarha, god of sky and thunder, and Aramahe, goddess of strength and warfare. The legends surrounding the founding of the Maklai clan are a well-liked part of the Quaggan legendarium, yet there exist multiple variations differing in the details.\n\nNonetheless, archaeological evidence has proven that the first recorded Khan of Quaggatai, Molghu, was from the Maklai clan, ruling in the 6th century BLB. Due to its proximity to Koltshgar, the long-time spiritual centre of the Quagga, as well as its large size, the Maklai clan was always one of the more influential clans, yet only few a Khans of the Maklai are recorded.\n\nDue to their historic rivalry with the Torquai, the Maklai suffered greatly when Khatun Elitghu unified Quaggatai in 454 ALB. The following period of Torquai dominance, coinciding with the invasion of Zonicia under Elitghu's daughter Ivaghu, saw the Maklai pushed to the side of Quaggan politics. In 601 ALB, the Maklai played a central role in toppling the Torquai's status and helped the new Khatun Melighu from the Suniquai clan to extend her rule over all of Quaggatai. In the following years, when rivalries between clans were common, the Maklai fought with almost all of their neighbours. In the more decentralized rule over the Zonician tributaries, they collected tribute from various Coltvan cities.\n\nAfter the collapse of Quaggan hegemony in North Zebrica in the Zonician war of independence (825-831 ALB), the Maklai clan helped the newly forming Senar clan to maintain its independence against the Raltung from whom they had split. They also blocked several attempts to elect a new Khan in Quaggatai, while Buckhara had an independent Khanate (856 – 934 ALB). In 911, Ionghu from the Torquai clan could eventually claim the title of Khan again, but his invasion of Buckhara in 934 ALB was deeply disliked by the Maklai and most other Khans.\n\nIn 957, a Maklai Khatun, Malighu, was elected after centuries without a Maklai on the Quaggan throne. She immediately started an ambitious reform program. Unlike Ionghu before her, she negotiated with the western clans to join her rule peacefully, relying particularly on Teqghu, clan leaders of the Suniquai at the time. Clever politicking allowed her to lead the Maklai to dominance in a way that only the Torquai had managed several centuries prior. The death of her daughter and heir Ephighu was a setback for her plans, but she managed to have her grandfoal and new heir Zaghu to be elected Khan after her."

quaggatai_history.2.d:0 "Current Clan Leader: Ianeghu\n\nThe Usoken clan is the southernmost of the eastern clans. Their origin reaches back at least to the 4th century BLB, when Khan Arighu from the Usoken clan is recorded to have ruled as Khan of Quaggatai. They see Ilghunha, the god of fate and the afterlife, as their protector, something that has occasionally caused suspicion from other clans, as Ilghunha is seen as a rather unreliable and dangerous god.\n\nDue to their exposed position, the Usoken have long maintained close relationships with the camels to the south and the llamas to the east. However, this relationship was not always friendly – raids and looting were just as common as cooperation and trade. In addition, being directly on the main roads of the Diamond Road, the Usoken have a long-running difficultly with the trader zebras from whom they have for a long time levied various tolls.\n\nWhen Elitghu unified Quaggatai in 454 ALB after a long time of disunity, the Usoken welcomed her rule, giving them a break from ongoing conflicts with the Muquarili and Maklai. Yet, when Elitghu's daughter Ivaghu invaded Zonicia in 525 ALB, the Usoken profited the least from the tributes. Nonetheless, their support for the Khanate persisted until Iamaghu was overthrown in 603 ALB and Melighu from the Suniquai became new Khatun of Quaggatai. As the authority of the Khanate weakened and the clans divided the collection of tribute between them, the Usoken ended up emptyhooved, due to their location being the furthest away from the subjugated cities. Instead, the Usoken focused once more on the camels and llamas, ignoring the declining Khanate. The downfall was eventually made official when in 831 ALB Atanghu died in the battle of Zur during the Zonician war of independence and no new Khan was chosen.\n\nIn 911 ALB, the Usoken supported Ionghu's bid for Khan, hoping to stave off the Maklai to the north once more. However, after his unpopular invasion of Buckhara in 934 ALB, the Usoken jumped ship, and in 957 ALB, after a historic treaty of friendship with the Maklai clan leader Malighu, supported her as the new Khatun. While not exactly supportive of her reforms to modernize and centralize Quaggatai, the current clan leader Ianeghu decided to support her grandfoal Zaghu as the new Khan. In light of Zaghu's submission to the Storm King, their relationship has become strained, but so far Ianeghu has stopped just short of rejecting Zaghu as Khan."

quaggatai_history.3.t:0 "History Of The Torquai Clan"
quaggatai_history.3.d:0 "Current Clan Leader: Ebighu\n\nAccording to legend, the Torquai clan came into existence from the unification of two other clans, when their respective clan leaders, named Belighu and Iqaghu, fell in love and decided to marry. Consequently, the Torquai see Mainu, god of the family, and Oszkune, goddess of fertility, as their protector gods, who, according to Quaggan myths, are also married. Archaeological evidence about the event remains inconclusive, but historians have found scripts showing that in the first century ALB the Maklai and Raltung clans devastated the lands of smaller clans in the area, making the story widely believed to have a historical core.\n\nIn the 5th century ALB, the Torquai clan had grown rich and powerful, and its clan leader Elitghu was able to unify Quaggatai after a long period of disunity through both strategic alliances and military successes. Her daughter Ivaghu, who followed her as Khatun, led the Quagga to victory over Colthage, beginning three centuries where the Quagga collected tribute from the Zonicians. Successive Torquai Khans would lead Quaggatai into a golden age, until a civil war broke out in 601 ALB after Khan Merghu's early death. His daughter Iamaghu, a three-year-old filly at the time, was overthrown and replaced by Melighu from the Suniquai clan.\n\nThe end of Torquai rule also saw the end of the Quaggatai's golden age, as the following clan leaders no longer had the authority anymore to keep the nation truly united. In the years following, the Torquai participated in the struggles for the title of Khan, and sometimes their clan leaders could claim the title, but only briefly. After the Zonician war of independence (825 – 831 ALB) and the death of Khan Atanghu, however, no new clan leader was chosen, and Quaggatai had no Khan again for a little over a century.\n\nIn 911 ALB, the Torquai clan leader Ionghu could gather enough support to be elected Khan. However, the western clans had formed the Khanate of Buckhara for over fifty years by this point. Ionghu's ambitions to reunify all of Quaggatai would be his downfall, and although his invasion of Buckhara in 934 ALB was successful, it was also deeply unpopular and guaranteed that his heir would not succeed him. Instead, in 954 ALB Melighu from the Maklai clan was chosen as new Khatun, much to the Torquai clan's dismay.\n\nWhen the Storm King invaded and Zaghu submitted, Ionghu's granddaughter, then clan leader Teaghu, led a rebellion against both Zaghu and the Storm King. During the defeat of the rebellion, Teaghu died and her daughter Ebighu became new clan leader. While the influence of the Torquai clan was much diminished in the aftermath, the rivalry with the Maklai clan and its leader, Khan Zaghu, very much remains."

quaggatai_history.4.t:0 "History Of The Senar Clan"
quaggatai_history.4.d:0 "Current Clan Leader: Opheghu\n\nThe Senar clan is by far the youngest of the Quaggan clans, having split from the Raltung clan in 831 ALB. The Zonician war of independence (825 – 831 ALB) had led to the death of Khan Atanghu in the Battle of Zur, which disgruntled parts of the Raltung clan took as an opportunity to declare independence under their leader Isinghu. The new clan leader of the Raltung, Astighu, fought to contest their secession, but with the help of the Maklai clan, the secessionists secured their independence, forming the Senar.\n\nHowever, the new clan remained the smallest of all Quaggan clans. In the decades afterwards, they had to repel multiple attempts from the Raltung to reconquer them, but friendly relations with the Maklai, Suniquai and Torquai ensured their independence. The Raltung eventually conceded when they accepted Isinghu's great-grandson, Uanghu, joining the council of clans in 909 ALB, shortly before the election of Ionghu from the Torquai clan as the new Khan of Quaggatai in 911 ALB.\n\nHowever, Ionghu's invasion of Buckhara about twenty years later soured the relations with the Torquai, as the Senar didn't want to see other clans being subjugated. Instead, they focused again on their friendly relations with the Maklai clan, and strongly supported Malighu's ascent to Khatun in 954 ALB. Uanghu died shortly afterwards, but his son continued the policy of close relations with the Maklai, even though Malighu's reforms centralized Quaggatai, on the grounds that at least now every clan was treated equally.\n\nThe current clan leader, Opheghu, came to power in 960 ALB after her father's early death. Her aunt, who acted as regent, was a close friend of Teqghu, then clan leader of the Suniquai, and a powerful advisor to Khatun Melighu. After the end of the regency, Opheghu half-heartedly continued the policy of positioning the Senar as supporters of the Khanate, yet also tried to mend ties with the Torquai and Raltung to hedge her bets in case the Khanate was to fall."

quaggatai_history.5.t:0 "History Of The Raltung Clan"
quaggatai_history.5.d:0 "Current Clan Leader: Roghu\n\nThe Raltung clan is the northernmost of the eastern clans. Their founding is shrouded in mystery, and in contrast to most other clans, there are no legends retelling their origin. Archaeological evidence has proven the existence of a Khanate of Bucklan during the second to first century BLB under a Khan Imarnaghu from the Raltung clan, but the title has not been used since. Living close to the Bagraza River, they often pray to Elkhane, goddess of rivers.\n\nTheir close proximity to the Zonicians to the north has often led them into conflict – one of their first recorded stories is the failed siege of Kazil-Zeb by Imarnaghu. Rivalries also existed with the Torquai clan to their south, after the latter emerged in the first century ALB, ending unopposed Raltung dominance in the north.\n\nWhen Elitghu from the Torquai clan unified Quaggatai in the 5th century ALB, the Raltung initially opposed her. However, during the invasion of Zonicia by Elitghu's daughter Ivaghu, the Raltung were at forefront of it, and played a crucial role in stabilizing Quaggan rule afterwards. The clan expanded northwards into Coltdar and built communities in cities like Karmanegdan, thereby guaranteeing the region's integration into Quaggatai. After Torquai rule fell in 603 ALB, the Raltung were again able to take advantage of this, leveraging their proximity to the Zonician cities to gain many as direct tributaries. In the following struggles for the throne, the Raltung also showed some success, as several of their clan leaders would become Khan.\n\nHowever, the waning of the Khan's powers ultimately led to the downfall of Quaggan hegemony. It was under the Raltung Khan Atanghu that in 825 ALB the Zonician war of independence began, and it ended in 831 with the death of the Khan in the battle of Zur. The aftermath saw the Raltung clan split, with disgruntled herds forming the Senar clan. Multiple attempts of reconquering the Senar clan failed, due to it being supported by the Maklai, Suniquai, and Torquai. Relations between the Raltung and the other clans soured greatly, but in 909 ALB the Raltung eventually conceded.\n\nIn 911 ALB, Ionghu from the Torquai clan was elected new Khan, with support of the Raltung hoping to improve their strategic situation. However, his invasion of Buckhara in 934 ALB cost him much support. Instead, in 954 ALB the Maklai clan leader Malighu was elected new Khatun. Distrust between the Maklai and Raltung is still strong, but their new clan leader Roghu has taken a stance of cautious neutrality. Recently, the occupation of Coltdar by Khan Zaghu has improved relations considerably, due to many Quagga from the Raltung clan living in the region."

quaggatai_history.6.t:0 "History Of The Muquarili Clan"
quaggatai_history.6.d:0 "Current Clan Leader: Farqeghu\n\nThe Muquarili clan is the largest and most powerful of the three western clans. Its history dates back to at least the fourth century BLB, with the clan leader at the time, Aineghu, being credited with founding the city of Buckhara. In the third century BLB, Muquarili clan leader Maroghu is recorded to have been the first Khatun of Buckhara, although her rule over her northern neighbours was likely superficial. The Khanate of Buckhara continued for a while, and some scholars claim it only ended in the first century BLB, although most of its rulers are lost to history.\n\nWhen Elitghu from the Torquai clan united Quaggatai in 454 ALB after a long period of disunity, the Muquarili clan accepted her rule after she brought down the Maklai clan, making them the first of the western clans to do so. Elitghu was followed by Ivaghu in 498 ALB, who launched an invasion of Zonicia in 525 ALB. While the Muquarili followed her in war, some, particularly eastern sources claim that Evighu, clan leader at the time, held his troops back from battle. Still, Ivaghu won and secured the Quagga the hegemony over North Zebrica for the next three centuries.\n\nDuring the time of Torquai rule, the Muquarili followed along, but when Melighu from the Suniquai clan overthrew them in 603 ALB, they secured themselves the tribute from the Zarantian tribes and most importantly Warzena. When the Suniquai could not hold on to the title of Khan after Melighu's death, the Muquarili participated in the power struggles for the throne, but only Aveghu could secure herself the title of Khatun for a short period between 670 ALB and her death three years later.\n\nEventually, the Khanate of Quaggatai came to an end when Khan Atanghu died in the Battle of Zur in 831 ALB and no new Khan was chosen. The western clans would band together and proclaim Taighu from the Suniquai clan as Khatun of Buckhara in 856 ALB. However, as early as 878 ALB, the Muquarili were able to claim the title from them, until the Khanate was destroyed in 934 ALB by an invasion from the east.\n\nWhen the eastern clans proclaimed Malighu from the Maklai clan as the new Khatun in 954 ALB, the Muquarili remained consequently quite reserved. Yet, only three years later Malighu had negotiated with the Suniquai and Morituq to swear fealty, all but forcing the Muquarili to go along with it. The reforms of her and her grandfoal Khan Zaghu have led the city of Buckhara to grow rapidly, quickly creating tensions with the clan surrounding it. When the Storm King invaded in 1006, Farqeghu led the resistance against the Khan's wishes, and after his defeat, he was imprisoned, leaving the Muquarili without a leader to fight for their interests."

quaggatai_history.7.d:0 "Current Clan Leader: Eaghu\n\nThe Suniquai clan emerged in the fourth century ALB when an ambitious herd elder split off from the Muquarili clan and conquered two smaller Buckharan clans. She adopted the regal name of Equeghu and spent the rest of her years warring both the Muquarili to her south and the Morituq to her north. As, according to legend, Equeghu was given a divine mission to form her clan by Kuhinae, goddess of the night, the Suniquai see her as their protector goddess.\n\nWhen Elitghu from the Torquai clan united Quaggatai after a long period of disunity, the Suniquai followed her lead readily, having recently lost squabbles with the Muquarili clan. They were also loyal followers during Ivaghu's invasion of Zonicia in 525 ALB. In the following years of Torquai rule, they supported the Khanate, until in 601 ALB Khan Merghu died and only left a three-year-old filly as heir. When Iamaghu's uncle Oalati proclaimed her new Khatun, the then clan leader of the Suniquai, Merghu, saw an opening to overthrow the increasingly overbearing rule of the Torquai. In the following two-year civil war, she remained victorious, becoming the first Khatun from a western clan to rule all of Quaggatai. However, she was not able to pass on her rule to her foals, and the throne of Quaggatai remained thereafter contested between the clans without dynastic continuity.\n\nNonetheless, the Suniquai flourished, securing Hippone and the surrounding region as their tributaries. Yet, as the Khanate continued to weaken, it was ultimately in this city that the Quaggan hegemony over North Zebrica collapsed. In 825 ALB, a rebellion broke out in Hippone, and six years later Quaggatai had lost the war. After the initial shock, the clan leader of the Suniquai, Taighu, tried to use their wealth to re-establishing the Khanate of Buckhara in 852 ALB, yet after her death in 874 ALB, control of the Khanate slipped to the Muquarili. This Khanate came to an end in 934 ALB with an invasion from the east under Khan Ionghu from the Torquai clan.\n\nEverything changed again when in 957 ALB Malighu from the Maklai clan was elected Khatun of Quaggatai by the eastern clans. Teqghu, then clan leader of the Suniquai, was friends with Malighu, agreeing with her on the need for Quaggatai to rapidly modernize. He organized for the western clans to peacefully join Malighu's rule and became a close advisor to her. His second daughter, Ohene, ultimately married Malighu's grandcolt and heir Zaghu, who became the new Khan of Quaggatai in 996 ALB. The Suniquai continue to have good relations with the ruling Maklai clan, although Teqghu's heir Eaghu, who followed him as clan leader in 997 ALB, seems to be a bit more reserved about it."

quaggatai_history.8.t:0 "History Of The Morituq Clan"
quaggatai_history.8.d:0 "Current Clan Leader: Esighu\n\nThe Morituq clan is the northernmost of the western clans, and by far the poorest. Their history goes back to at least the first century BLB, but in contrast to other clans, there is not much archaeological evidence about their history. It is unclear if the Morituq were already part of the first Khanate of Buckhara in the third century BLB, but most historians argue against it.\n\nThe relative poverty of the Morituq is explained by their territory being poor in quality, with considerable parts of it being in the desert or desertic steppes. Additionally, little trade runs through their territory, leaving them without the option to impose tolls or duties like other clans. Consequently, they have often become the subject of ridicule from other clans, and in some parts of Quaggatai, "grazing like a Morituq" is a saying for being too poor to afford hay or yogurt.\n\nWhen Elitghu from the Torquai unified Quaggatai in 454 ALB, the Morituq, after some initial hesitation, joined her willingly. As the Torquai ruled over Quaggatai for the next 150 years, the Morituq profited from this time of relative peace, although they profited little from the invasion of Zonicia by Elitghu's daughter Ivaghu. Consequently, they regarded the overthrowal of Torquai rule by the Melighu, clan leader of the Suniquai, sceptically. As the North Zebrican tributaries were distributed amongst the clans, they could only secure control over relatively poor regions around Zapsa, and in the power struggle over the Quaggan throne, they were little more than bystanders.\n\nIn 831 ALB, the Khanate of Quaggatai ended, and the Morituq were left to fend for themselves once more. An incursion into Raltung territory after the latter had been weakened by the Senar secession ended poorly, and so they welcomed it when Taighu from the Suniquai clan restored the Khanate of Buckhara in 854 ALB. The Khanate lasted until 934 ALB, when it was destroyed in an invasion by the Quaggan Khan Ionghu.\n\nIonghu was not directly followed by another Khan, but in 957 ALB, the eastern clans elected Melighu, leader of the Maklai clan, as the new Khatun. Reactions from the Morituq were cautious at first, but after the Suniquai's leader Teqghu appeared to join Melighu's Khanate peacefully, they followed suit, so as to not be excluded. As Melighu focussed on modernizing the nation and strengthening the powers of the Khanate, the Morituq were more positive about it than most other clans, as they had been on the losing side of inter-clan struggles far too often during their history. This has continued after Zaghu became Khan, meaning the Morituq are more accepting of his ambitions than other clans."

quaggatai_history.9.d:0 "Koltshgar is the largest city in Quaggatai, and by far the oldest. In fact, with a founding date before 1000 BLB, it is the oldest part of Quaggan civilization, surpassing the earliest historically proven Khanate by several hundred years. For most of its existence, it was also the only genuinely urban settlement in Quaggatai, in part because the lands surrounding Koltshgar are among the few suitable for agriculture in the country.\n\nHowever, Koltshgar also had an important role in the cultural and spiritual life of Quaggan culture. While most gods in the Quaggan pantheon had some sort of holy site, they were usually natural landmarks. In contrast, Koltshgar was – and continues to be – the home of the temple of Iszkarha, god of sky and thunder and the highest of the Quaggan gods. In addition, it was also the traditional meeting place of the council of clans when it assembled, and the seat of the Khanate.\n\nNonetheless, for most of its history, it was still relatively small. This only started to change at the start of the 10th century, and accelerated after Melighu was chosen as Khatun in 954 ALB. In her effort to modernize the nation, she invested massively in Koltshgar, creating entirely new districts, founding the first Quaggan factories, and constructing a new royal palace. In 900 ALB, Koltshgar had less than 20,000 inhabitants; in 950 ALB, it had already grown to 50,000, and by the present day the city has reached a population of more than 250,000 zebras.\n\nWith increasing numbers also came a whole new social class of urbanites, something previously unknown to Quaggatai. The urban zebras are mostly supportive of Melighu and her successor Khan Zaghu, seeing the Khanate as key to securing their interests against the clans."

According to legend, it was founded in the fourth century BLB by Aineghu, the first known clan leader of the Muquarili. When in 334 BLB Maroghu declared the Khanate of Buckhara, she took the town as both namesake and capital, and surviving records seem to indicate that she intended for it to rival Koltshgar.\n\nHowever, this didn't come to pass. The Khanate soon weakened, and in the second century BLB Buckhara had likely already lost its status as capital. Instead, Buckhara fell into the hooves of the tradezebras, who used it as a supply hub for their caravans travelling from Koltshgar westwards into Zarantia. In the following centuries, the relationship between the city, now dominated by merchants, and the surrounding clans was contentious. Nonetheless, the city served a few more times as capital of a Buckharan Khanate, the last time in 934 ALB.\n\nThe fate of Buckhara changed when in 957 ALB Melighu was chosen as Khatun of Quaggatai, and in 960 ALB the Muquarili joined her Khanate. Soon enough, Melighu started to invest in the city, hoping to gain a political stronghold in the west. Her ambitious modernization program brought the city a burgeoning industry as well as staggering population growth, turning from what could be reasonably described as an overgrown caravansary into a proper urban settlement.\n\nYet, the question of national identity is not quite so easy. While the urban zebras of Buckhara generally share the anti-clanist sentiment from their eastern counterparts, the city has seen the rise of groups – albeit small ones – opposing the Pan-Quagganism of Melighu or her successor Zaghu on nationalist grounds."

quaggatai_history.11.t:0 "History Of Bucklan"
quaggatai_history.11.d:0 "Bucklan is the third-largest city in Quaggatai. Its origins remain contested: The Maklai clan claims it was founded by Molghu, the first Khan of Quaggatai, as a northern border fort. The Raltung instead insist that it was founded much later by Imarnaghu, who proclaimed herself Khatun of Bucklan in the first century BLB.\n\nRegardless of its founding date, Bucklan remained a relatively insignificant town for most of its history, mainly used as a port by trading zebras on their way to Colthage. The Raltung clan, which for most of its history surrounded the city, did not add contribute its development, instead imposing tolls on the merchants. This encirclement ended when the Senar split from the Raltung in 831 ALB, allowing Bucklan to moderately prosper as northern supply hub on the Diamond Road.\n\nWhen Melighu was chosen as Khatun of Quaggatai in 954 ALB, she quickly realized the potential of the already growing city. She designated the city once more as the stronghold of the north, building fortifications as protection against a possible invasion from the north. She also supported the construction of factories around the city, although with less success than in Koltshgar or Buckhara. Nonetheless, Bucklan has grown significantly, and for her and her successor Zaghu the city has proven a valuable base to secure their rule in the north."

quaggatai_history.12.t:0 "But What Is A Buckharan, Really?"
quaggatai_history.12.d:0 "If you ask three Buckharans this question, you will get five answers and a brawl.\n\nThe question of national identity among the western clans is a delicate one, and doesn't lend itself to easy answers. Several times in history, a Khanate of Buckhara existed, sometimes in parallel to Quaggatai, at other times without a Quaggan Khan. And yet, the western clans always engaged in Quaggan politics, and some managed to claim the title of Quaggan Khan or Khatun.\n\nBuckharan, the language spoken in Buckhara, is closely related to Quaggan. Most scholars, particularly those funded by Khan Zaghu, claim it is a dialect of Quaggan, based on the fact that the two are usually mutually intelligible. Yet there are also those who point to distinct features of Buckharan to argue that it is a separate, albeit sister, language.\n\nLikewise, Buckharan culture shares many features with its eastern counterpart. They have the same pantheon – although Iszkarha tends to play a less dominant role – and many of the same legends. Traditionally being nomads just like the eastern clans, their social structure is also similar, as is their economy. However, some claim the western clans are more skilled at desert warfare, as at their western borders the steppes give way to the Zebharan desert.\n\nBut regardless of similarities or differences, national identity is a question of belief more so than any other factor. In that respect, most zebras of the west feel a dual identity, and being Quagga and Buckharan is not mutually exclusive for them. The details remain hotly debated – in some circles, "asking about Buckhara" has become proverbial for a topic that leads to hooves flying."

quaggatai_history.13.t:0 "The Quaggan Social Structure"
quaggatai_history.13.d:0 "The Quagga are a nomadic society, which shapes their societal organization. Their social structure is dominated by four layers – family, herd, clan and nation.\n\nThe family describes all zebras living in one tent, usually led by its oldest member. Families usually consist of the nuclear family, so parents with their foals and occasionally grandfoals. While the oldest foal inherits the family tent, the younger foals either join the tent of their spouse – Quagga practise monogamy – or found a new tent with their spouse, if neither is the eldest foal. In these cases, new families are given some starting wealth by their – now former – families, mostly in the form of livestock, which forms the basis of the Quaggan economy.\n\nMultiple families form a herd, which refers to the wandering nomadic camps. Herds are headed by a chief, responsible for finding fertile lands. Families in a herd are often related to each other, and a herd can be understood as the extended family, but intermarriage between herds is common and to some extent expected.\n\nA clan is a collection of herds, headed by a clan leader. Traditionally, the clan is where the loyalties of Quaggan zebras really lie, taking much priority above the nation as a whole. The clan leaders are determined by strict primogeniture along a family line. The herds in a single clan are expected to stay relatively close together geographically, so that the clan leader can call up their warriors in times of need.\n\nLastly, there is the Quaggan nation – Quaggatai as a whole. The ruler of Quaggatai is called a Khan or Khatun and elected by the clan council. In contrast to clan leaders, there is not as much precedent for dynastic continuity. The authority of a Khan has historically fluctuated greatly, and there have been times without a Khan altogether.\n\nAt the margins – or even outside – the clan structure are the trade zebras of the Diamond Road. They form caravans, often together with the camels to the south, to make the year-long journeys. Because of that, they are not part of any herd, and some of them are also not part of any clan. The clans often demand tolls for crossing through their lands from the merchants, which leads the merchants to be among the few reliable supporters of a stronger Khanate.\n\nA relatively new phenomenon is the rise of city dwellers, shaking up the nomadic societal structure. While the city of Koltshgar is old, only in recent times have more and more zebras started to settle down. The increased emergence of towns and cities has given rise to another supporting group for a unified, stronger Khanate, and some might claim that the time is ripe for a shift in government."

quaggatai_history.14.t:0 "Overview Of The Quaggan Pantheon"
quaggatai_history.14.d:0 "Quagga pray to their gods in various ways, both privately and in public. Prayers can involve offerings of food or valuables, although they are usually reserved for the most important occasions. Every herd has an oracle – a priest – who also performs medical tasks. Clan leaders' oracles are often among their most important advisors.\n\nThere are ten main gods in the Quaggan pantheon, accepted by all Quagga.\n- Iszkarha is the god of the sky and thunder, and is regarded as the highest of the gods. He has a large temple in Koltshgar.\n- Ilghunha is the god of fate and afterlife. Considered a fickle and dangerous god, he is responsible for rewarding pious Quagga in the eternal steppes, while punishing evil ones.\n- Mainu is the god of the family and livestock. As livestock forms the basis of the nomadic economy, he is often prayed to. He is married to Oszkune.\n- Oszkune is the goddess of fertility. Those hoping for foals pray to her, as do pregnant mares hoping for a smooth birth. She is married to Mainu.\n- Paszakha is the god of love. Single mares and stallions are often spotted leaving him offerings, but old couples also pray to him to rekindle their love. He is the son of Mainu and Oszkune.\n- Kuhinae is the goddess of the night. Few worship her but the Suniquai, yet her being the daughter of Mainu and Oszkune makes her part of the core pantheon.\n- Elakhane is the goddess of rivers and oceans, although few Quagga have seen the latter. Always in motion like her rivers, she is considered unpredictable.\n- Beliae is the goddess of philosophers and scholars. Few legends tell of her, but in the growing cities she has won an increasing number of worshippers.\n- Rhugoneph is the god of the desert and merchants. The trade zebras have shrines for him in almost every caravansary they visit, but most other Quagga give him little thought.\n- Aramahe is the goddess of warfare and prowess. Her story is special, as she was born a mortal with the name of Oramaghu, before elevated to godhood by Iszkarha himself."

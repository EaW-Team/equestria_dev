 ########## focus localisation ######

 SPL_Political_Boredom:0 "Shaking the Apathy"
 SPL_Political_Boredom_desc:0 "The peasants are displeased... again. That's not much of a surprise, the llamas are always complaining but every few years the deer add their voices to the crowd; that’s when the Jharl has to actually take the complaints a little seriously. A few token changes and overdue reforms will quiet them back down for another few years."
 SPL_Speak_with_deer_nobles:0 "Negotiate with the Houses"
 SPL_Speak_with_deer_nobles_desc:0 "Major issues with the counts and countesses of Stagpal are rare, and when they do cause problems they rarely affect the whole realm. However, a few have been especially lax as of late and need to be personally reminded of their duties."
 SPL_the_tax_of_the_taxdeers:0 "Revaluating the Tax Strategy"
 SPL_the_tax_of_the_taxdeers_desc:0 "When Stagpal was conquered the only deer in the country were the mercenaries Mahaan had brought with him. Promises of preferential tax treatment and subsidies lead to substantial deer immigration, but after two decades immigration has slowed to a trickle and the tax breaks remain in place."
 SPL_a_ballot_for_them:0 "A Grand Feast"
 SPL_a_ballot_for_them_desc:0 "Every new batch of ‘reforms’ is topped off by a grand feast, which every noble or town representative can attend. At the end of every feast is an open forum, where each attendee can submit a single grievance, personally, to the Jharl himself on the behalf of their constituency."
 SPL_LLamats_Propaganda:0 "Convincing the Llamas"
 SPL_LLamats_Propaganda_desc:0 "Twenty years under a foreign ruler has left the majority llama population embittered and uncooperative. But they can be placated and coerced like anyone else, though it takes a bit more than just stamping a few papers."
 SPL_improving_a_shithole:0 "Cleaning Up the Neighborhood"
 SPL_improving_a_shithole_desc:0 "Drop someone in the middle of a Stagpali city and they wouldn’t struggle to find where the affluent deer district ends, and the impovrished llama ghetto begins. Communal attempts to improve infrastructure and always poorly planned and funded. They may need some outside help."
 SPL_recruiting_some_recruits:0 "Expanding the Ranks"
 SPL_recruiting_some_recruits_desc:0 "While tactics, terrain, and elite training have served our nation well, rampant draft dodging by the llama population has left our forces severely lacking. As the nations around us modernize and tactics begin to change, the need for more soldiers has become increasingly dire. A change in recruitment tactics is in order."
 SPL_A_Oligarchy:0 "A Council of Nobles"
 SPL_A_Oligarchy_desc:0 "The future should rest in the hands of more than one being. The position of Jharl shall be abolished, and instead a new organization headed by the new deer and former llama nobles, all acting in Stagpal’s best interests will be the surest and fairest way of improving the country, hopefully mending the rift between the deer and llamas in the process."
 SPL_the_Dukedom_never_ends:0 "The Jharl’s Heir" 
 SPL_the_Dukedom_never_ends_desc:0 "A wise leader with a steady hoof is the surest way forward. The nobles are already concerned with their own lands, what interest would they have in the rest of the country? Only a Jharl, handpicked and groomed for the position, can ensure Stagpal is strong and prosperous for all."

To get them and the support they need into the right place we will have to apply the principles of V.T.D. to our transport trucks."
 SPL_Military_Destroy_the_enemys_Supplies:0 "Long-Range Assault"
 SPL_Military_Destroy_the_enemys_Supplies_desc:0 "There is nowhere our enemies will be able to hide. No matter the distance we will rain devastation on them and by targeting their supplies and manufacturing centres we will eliminate their ability to resist our advance. They can’t dig trenches without shovels."
 SPL_Military_Better_mountain_Equiptment:0 "Situational Kit"
 SPL_Military_Better_mountain_Equiptment_desc:0 "Standardised equipment exists for a reason; it’s easy to mass produce and maintain but it does have its problems. In a landscape as varied as ours, it’s not practical to equip our low-altitude troops with the same kit as the high-altitude ones. We need several loadouts to match the changing needs of the army."
 SPL_Military_fighters_of_the_skies:0 "Supporting the Bombers"
 SPL_Military_fighters_of_the_skies_desc:0 "Our bombers will need escorting on their way to the targets, but we currently lack the expertise to design and produce the fighters for the task. By purchasing some older designs, we can study them and create designs for modernising our planes."
 SPL_Military_Mountain_tanks:0 "The Pride of Our Nation"
 SPL_Military_Mountain_tanks_desc:0 "Our V.T.D. projects are proving their worth and have become something of a symbol of pride for what Stagpal can achieve if we put our minds to a task. Our tanks and trucks are even starting to have toys produced for the fawns and cria; they do seem to have ignited the public spirit."
 SPL_Military_support_our_bombers:0 "Clearing the Way"
 SPL_Military_support_our_bombers_desc:0 "With modern fighters, we can clear the sky of our enemies’ defensive aircraft and give our bombers free reign over their territory. They’ll be able to take their time and pinpoint their targets in peace and do as much damage as possible."
 SPL_Military_Aggressiv_Implementering:0 "Rolling Assault"
 SPL_Military_Aggressiv_Implementering_desc:0 "The principles of aggression have been proven time and again throughout history, attack before your enemy is prepared and victory is assured. Adopting a war policy of continuous assault with waves of soldiers will keep the enemy on the backhoof whilst giving our troops time to recover."
 SPL_Military_Military_science:0 "Military Science"
 SPL_Military_Military_science_desc:0 "Technological development never moves faster than in wartime. Setting up a new research facility to broaden our capacity will keep us ahead of the foe with advanced weapons and production, with the bonus of spilling into improvements in civilian industry and everyday life."
 SPL_Military_the_llama_way_of_warfare:0 "Camelid Warfare"
 SPL_Military_the_llama_way_of_warfare_desc:0 "The mountains which hold our nation are hard and unyielding, keeping any outsiders foolish enough to attempt to breach them at bay. Our approach to warfare should erk these mountains, letting our would-be attackers break against our lines like the wind against the mountains. Once they have expended themselves, we can advance with ease."
 SPL_Military_defend_our_air:0 "Our land, Our Skies"
 SPL_Military_defend_our_air_desc:0 "The hills and mountains of Stagpal regularly breach the clouds, the blue skies themselves just out of reach. Had we wings of our own we could’ve claimed the skies long ago, but the modern world has provided a solution. We will defend our skies as fiercely as our mountains."
 SPL_Military_tank_plan:0 " Defensive Vertical Terrain Design"
 SPL_Military_tank_plan_desc:0 "Tanks are impractical for driving around in the mountains under their current designs. By tailoring our engines for low gears and high torque instead of speed, we lose the edge in mobility, but our heavier tanks will be able to reach overwise inaccessible firing positions. They will also be easier to maintain due to their reduced top speed putting less pressure on the suspension under all that armour."
 SPL_Military_Break_incoming_treaths:0 "Blot Out the Sun"
 SPL_Military_Break_incoming_treaths_desc:0 "As our foes descend upon our defences they will try and rain down destruction on us with their air forces. We will meet them as they come, filling the air with such a hail of shrapnel and flak that it blackens the sky."
 SPL_Military_Allround_planes:0 "Blunting the Charge"
 SPL_Military_Allround_planes_desc:0 "As we prepare for enemy charges, we should use every tool in our arsenal to support our defending soldiers. By boasting our close air ability, we can use our air force to break the back of an assault before it reaches our lines."
 SPL_Military_a_good_groundwork:0 "Unbreakable Spirit"
 SPL_Military_a_good_groundwork_desc:0 "Nothing unites the spirit of a nation like the threat of an external aggressor. When some creature comes to take your home and your family away, you will give all you have to defend them. We do not need to remind our citizens of this, we just need to stoke it a little."
 SPL_Military_LLamas_companies:0 "No Retreat"
 SPL_Military_LLamas_companies_desc:0 "We will hold our ground come what may. Whilst our soldiers train to stand and defend support companies will be trained just as hard to provide the best aid they can. New trench designs for the engineers will keep the troops at the front, while multi-purpose tools for maintenance will mean our vehicles don’t have to be sent back to workshops for repairs."
 SPL_Military_The_new_age_of_LLamas_Tactics:0 "The Hooves of the Llama"
 SPL_Military_The_new_age_of_LLamas_Tactics_desc:0 "The native llamas of Stagpal are known for their sure hooves and strong backs, able to hold their ground come rain, snow, or mountain storms. Making a point of expanding our recruitment from their number will boast our armies and lend itself nicely to our defensive war strategy."
 SPL_Military_mountain_roads:0 "Unwavering Defence"
 SPL_Military_mountain_roads_desc:0 "Stagpal does not shy away from combat, but neither do we blindly run towards it. Our enemies are fools, unenlightened to their fragility as they hurl themselves against our defences, breaking their strength. Once they have defeated themselves utterly, we advance."
 SPL_Military_rockets:0 "The Wind of the Mountains"
 SPL_Military_rockets_desc:0 "The advancement of fuel processing and aerodynamic theory has allowed the creation of a new type of long-range warfare. For the first time, we will be able to strike at our foes without having to endanger our forces."
 SPL_Military_rockets_nuclear_dream:0 "Shaking the Core"
 SPL_Military_rockets_nuclear_dream_desc:0 "Continued development in rocketry has proven that unorthodox plans and ideas can yield great results. There is also talk of the potential benefits of nuclear research, but that would require some further setup of dedicated labs."

 SPL_Economics_Mountain_farms_desc:0 "At first glance, the mountains do not appear suitable for agriculture. With a little creative engineering though we can reshape the slopes and valleys into the perfect terraced farms, at last, giving us proper fields and paddies."
 SPL_Economics_Mountain_factories:0 ""Up and Over" Industry"
 SPL_Economics_Mountain_factories_desc:0 "Flat land and plateaus are hard things to find in these mountains and this land must be set aside for housing. There is nothing to say that factories need to be outside though. By tunnelling and using blasting we can build our industry into the side of the very mountains themselves."
 SPL_Economics_Resource_Site:0 "Wealth of the Mountains"
 SPL_Economics_Resource_Site_desc:0 "We sit atop a gold mine, literally. There are deep seams of resources just under our hooves waiting to be cracked open. With a full-scale survey of the mountains, we might also reveal some seams closer to the surface which we can exploit straight away."
 SPL_Economics_A_Self_sufstaining_Mountanside:0 "A Home and Haven"
 SPL_Economics_A_Self_sufstaining_Mountanside_desc:0 "Isolated as we are from the world, we need self-sufficiency, but where others merely survive, we thrive. These mountains can provide everything we need. Food, shelter, jobs, and resources, we want for nothing here and have enough to spare."
 SPL_Economics_Science_of_stagpal:0 "The Hike to Modernity"
 SPL_Economics_Science_of_stagpal_desc:0 "The world has moved on without us. This part of Zebrica was never on the cutting edge of advancement and within these mountains, we have fallen even further behind. It will be a long uphill struggle to modernise Stagpal but one we must undertake."
 SPL_Economics_Resources_technology:0 "Roots of the World"
 SPL_Economics_Resources_technology_desc:0 "There are many minerals within these mountains that we just can’t get our hooves on. They’re buried too deep, and we lack the tools to make the most of them. By setting aside funds to finance mining development we will finally be able to crack open these veins and benefit hugely in the long run."
 SPL_Economics_Electricity_connects_us:0 "Lightning in a Bottle"
 SPL_Economics_Electricity_connects_us_desc:0 "Electricity is a miracle of the modern age. The mountains are a dangerous place at the best of times but at night they are lethal.

 SPL_Economics_Past_Luxus_is_todays_standart_desc:0 "As we move towards a modern state the quality of life for the average citizen is improving.

 SPL_elitist_army:0 "Limited Draft"
 SPL_elitist_army_desc:0 "Stagpal was founded by Deer warriors, and it needs a large caste of Deer warriors to ensure the peace is kept. On top of that, the Llamas have absolutely no intention of fighting and dying for foreign conquerers, and almost always manage to evade the draft with help from llama locals. As a result Stagpal’s army has no choice but to be a small elite force."

 stagpal.0.t:0 "The Beginning of the Jharldom"
 stagpal.0.d:0 "Over two decades ago the Tsenpo of Llamabet died. His sons, dissatisfied with their given inheritances, rallied their forces and allies to seize each others. In the bloody war that followed, some sought refuge from the conflict by declaring neutrality, supporting neither side until the wars conclusion.\n\nIn the region of Gujadoe in the Doelhi Confederacy, Mahaan Ghanusson was having his own inheritance crisis. As the sixth son of a minor noble family, Mahaan stood to gain almost nothing after his father’s death. However, once the war broke out and what is now Stagpal declared neutrality, Mahaan decided to create his own inheritance, hiring mercenaries and rallying nobles in similar situations, Mahaan would go on to conquer Stagpal, declare himself Jharl, and defend his realm from the reunited Llamabet.\n\nUnfortunately, after years of Jharl rule, Stagpal has stagnated. What few changes occur are made with the sole purpose of appeasing the lesser nobles and peasantry, and not for the growth and health of the country as a whole."

Living lavishly while the original rulers are destitute and powerless? It’s quite hard to not sound like the bad guy in such a story. But sometimes the Jharl descends from his high tower, and as a show of humility, walks down the streets on his own four hooves, conversing with the locals and buying merchant wares just like any other being. It’s generally quite a good show, if time consuming. The next could just be a simple outting like all the ones prior, but with some preperation we could make a real show out of it instead."

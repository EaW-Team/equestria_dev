MSS_free_tribes_desc:0 "The Mozzi do not bend to anyone. Our kingdoms have been free for centuries, defying our neighbours who wished to subjugate us. Yet we do not simply sit and wait for our foes to come to us. Our warriors are known as fierce and fearless raiders who strike deep into enemy territory. And above all, we maintain the traditions of our ancestors, caring little for foreign influences."

 MSS_melee_equipment_0:0 "Iron-Tipped Bows & Spears"
 MSS_melee_equipment_0_short:0 "Bows & Spears"
 MSS_melee_equipment_0_desc:0 "The humble spear and the composite bow have been the traditional weapons of choice for warriors in the Great Lakes region. The spears and arrows usually have tips of sharpened well-forged iron, capable of piercing the most commonly used protection, padded armour and wooden shields, effectively. Additionally, arrows are often coated in deadly poisons created by potion-makers, meaning even a minor wound can be lethal."
 MSS_melee_equipment_1:0 "Mazwian Matchlock Musket"
 MSS_melee_equipment_1_short:0 "Mazwian Musket"
 MSS_melee_equipment_1_desc:0 "The matchlock musket was a revolutionary weapon in the Great Lakes. With their extensive gold reserves, the Mazwians imported thousands of firearms from abroad and eventually learned to make them by themselves. This weapon was instrumental in their rapid expansion which led to the domination of the Imperial Mazwi for two centuries."
 MSS_infantry_equipment_0:0 "Rifle-Musket"
 MSS_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "Rifle-Musket"
 MSS_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "Rifled barrels started appearing in the Great Lakes only when foreign rifles were imported from abroad. While initially used alongside traditional smoothbore weapons, the barrels of muskets were gradually replaced with rifled ones. These transitional weapons were rather crude as local blacksmiths were still learning the rifling process and the creation of conical hollow bullets that made rifles more effective than muskets."
 MSS_infantry_equipment_1:0 "Harmattan Rifle"
 MSS_infantry_equipment_1_short:0 "Harmattan Rifle"
 MSS_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "Timbucktuan artisans were the first to fully reverse-engineer foreign rifles and create their own domestic design, while the alchemists of the university of Timbucktu unraveled the secret of gunpowder. This made Timbucktu the first place in the Great Lakes that was self-reliant in weapons, albeit the rate of production was limited. The rifle design that spread across the region was named "Harmattan" after the harsh eastern desert wind of the dry season, a regular phenomenon in Timbucktu and northern Great Lakes in general."
 MSS_infantry_equipment_2:0 "Hemlock Repeating Rifle"
 MSS_infantry_equipment_2_short:0 "Hemlock Rifle"
 MSS_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "During the Unification Wars, gunsmiths in the city of Zao constantly experimented with improved weapon designs with generous government support. This led to the creation of a repeating rifle able to maintain high rates of fire with decent accuracy. As Zar-Hay warriors had a habit of coating the bullets of the weapon in poison from the hemlock plant, the rifle soon earned its ominous nickname."
 MSS_infantry_equipment_3:0 "Hippopotamus Rifle"
 MSS_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "Hippopotamus Rifle"
 MSS_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "As the Great Lakes modernized, the gunsmiths designed improved weapons. Their crowning achievement is a near-entirely metallic battle rifle with an adjustable rate of fire. It was a modular weapon consisting of multiple steel parts that were assembled together, making it easier to maintain and produce. Its grey appearance and fearsome reputation on the battlefield earned it the nickname "hippopotamus"."
 MSS_infantry_equipment_x:0 "AR 19"
 MSS_infantry_equipment_x_short:0 "AR 19"
 MSS_infantry_equipment_x_desc:0 "With organization of arms production improving, rifle designs were patented and given official designations. The most popular domestically produced assault rifle model was a weapon that had little to no influences from the older generations of weapons. As such, it resembled a foreign pony or griffon rifle more than anything. The weapon had larger clips, better rate of fire, higher accuracy, improved reliability... yet when soldiers held it in their hooves, they felt like they were holding a foreign import."
 MSS_infantry_equipment_x_2:0 "AR 25"
 MSS_infantry_equipment_x_2_short:0 "AR 25"
 MSS_infantry_equipment_x_2_desc:0 "The long-awaited AR 25 is superior in every way to the older models. It is the culmination of years of ceaseless arms development, a bold, visionary steps towards a more secure future. Compared to AR 19, it has a high-capacity magazine, improved metallurgical quality of the barrel and a better gun sight. Aesthetics have also been taken into account, with sleek ivory-coloured plastic casing. With this weapon, the Great Lakes will remain united forever. Shall we sign the contract?"
 
 MSS_magical_equipment_1:0 "Godbolt Sniper Rifle"
 MSS_magical_equipment_1_short:0 "Godbolt Rifle"
 MSS_magical_equipment_1_desc:0 "Magical crystals are a rare commodity in the Great Lakes, yet some Timbucktuan gunsmiths experimented nevertheless with the creation of a crystal-powered personal rifle. While prone to malfunction, it was surprisingly accurate and thus turned into a markszebra's weapon with a large scope. It was said that being hit by the weapon was like being struck by God's thunderbolt from heaven."
 MSS_magical_equipment_2:0 "Godstorm Sniper Rifle"
 MSS_magical_equipment_2_short:0 "Godstorm Rifle"
 MSS_magical_equipment_2_desc:0 "Demand for an improved design led to the creation of an improved crystal-powered rifle, which retained its accuracy but was less prone to exploding. It had a larger caliber, being even more powerful than its predecessor. Its shots were no longer had the power of mere thunderbolts, but of entire thunderstorms."
 MSS_magical_equipment_3:0 "Magical Sniper Rifle 19"
 MSS_magical_equipment_2_short:0 "MSR 19"
 MSS_magical_equipment_3_desc:0 "Rather than being the work of individual skilled artisans who decorated their crafts, the Magical Sniper Rifle was mass produced in workshops. It had a standardized patented design and condensed crystal capacitors. The wide barrel allowed a large amount of energy to be unleashed at once, meaning at best the weapon could even penetrate armoured vehicles."
 MSS_magical_equipment_4:0 "Magical Sniper Rifle 25"
 MSS_magical_equipment_2_short:0 "MSR 19"
 MSS_magical_equipment_4_desc:0 "We heard you loud and clear. MSR 19 was rather inaccurate and quickly drained of energy. So today we present its successor, MSR 25, which will be produced alongside the AR 25. Its improved crystal capacitor can hold a huge amount of magical power, while its improved barrel releases it in a more focused manner. The sight has been upgraded with improved lasers, with an experimental laser projector available as an upgrade. What are you waiting for? Just sign the contract, and your soldiers will thank you later!"
 
 MSS_artillery_equipment_0:0 "Iron Cannons"
 MSS_artillery_equipment_0_short:0 "Iron Cannons"
 MSS_artillery_equipment_0_desc:0 "As zebras in the Great Lakes acquired artillery from abroad, they primarily used them on war canoes to dominate the many rivers and lakes of the region. This gave waterborne vessels impressive firepower and greatly increased their importance in warfare. Of course, sometimes it was necessary to use such cannons on land. In such cases cannons were mounted on wheels dragged by a group of slaves."

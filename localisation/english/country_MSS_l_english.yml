MSS_free_tribes:0 "The Free Tribes"
MSS_free_tribes_desc:0 "The Mozzi do not bend to anyone. Our kingdoms have been free for centuries, defying our neighbours who wished to subjugate us. Yet we do not simply sit and wait for our foes to come to us. Our warriors are known as fierce and fearless raiders who strike deep into enemy territory. And above all, we maintain the traditions of our ancestors, caring little for foreign influences."

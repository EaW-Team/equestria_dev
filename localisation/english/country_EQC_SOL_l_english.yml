 EQC_SOL.1.t:0 "Solarist Coup"
 EQC_SOL.1.d:0 "Following recent developments in Equestria, several groups within our military and society have started to sympathise with the new rule of "Daybreaker". Our intelligence suggests that a large group of officers, lead by General Candy Garden, is planning to overthrow our government in a coup d'état. It appears we're running out of time. The fate of New Mareland could very well depend on our choice of action."
 EQC_SOL.1.a:0 "Plotters are found hours before the coup!"
 EQC_SOL.1.b:0 "Military arrests the Congress in a bloodless coup!"
 EQC_SOL.1.c:0 "Side with Solarists."
 EQC_SOL.1.e:0 "Side with Loyalists."
 
 EQC_SOL.3.t:0 "Death of the Shadowbolt Society"
 EQC_SOL.3.d:0 "Sour Sweet watched as gunfire lit up the building across the street, the sound of bullets filling the air. When their last informants in the government had gone dark, she knew that the Society was coming to an end. Ever since the new Solar government had taken over, they had fought back against the new authority, but to no avail. It was not because of any sort of loyalty to Nightmare Moon; the only ponies who still believed in that were the old guard of the society who were being gunned down in the building right now. No, it was because they knew that no matter what, they would be on the chopping block as heretics eventually.\n\nThis setback was no temporary one either. Sour Sweet had convinced most of the new members and her personal friends like Sunny Flare and Indigo Zap to flee while they had the chance, and as far as she knew was the only one left still in New Mareland. They had all agreed that it was too risky to stick together, and that they should likely never see each other again. It was a shame, really, considering that she had actually liked working with a few of them.\n\nSmoke filled the air as their former headquarters began to burn, and the Solar soldiers began streaming out of the front door. It was time to go. Putting her hood up, she moved back into the alleyway behind her and didn't look back. Sour Sweet already had her ticket for a one way trip out of New Mareland to elsewhere in Griffonia; it was time to start a new life there.\n\nThe Shadowbolt Society was dead, and it was never coming back."
 EQC_SOL.3.a:0 "Good riddance."
 
 solarempire.35.t:0 "Solarism in New Mareland"
 solarempire.35.d:0 "New Mareland has once again vowed to serve us, under the Empress. While this is good news to us all, some elements of our military and government suspect that New Mareland's government could still secretly hold strong ties to our old enemies, such as Luna. As such, they have suggested that we "remove" [solar_EQC.GetLeader] from power and install a more faithful and loyal pony in their stead.\n\nShould we keep the current government in charge and let them continue their relatively successful reign, or is it time for a change of regime?"
 solarempire.35.a:0 "[EQC.GetLeader] has done an alright job."
 solarempire.35.b:0 "Send one of our loyal ponies to ensure compliance."
 solarempire.36.t:0 "Imperial Support"
 solarempire.36.d:0 "Following the recent developments within our nation, there have been many rumours surrounding the "legitimacy" and "loyalty" of our government to the Empire. The Empress herself heard of these concerns and suspicions, though there doesn't seem to be anything to fear. She has made it clear to both us and her advisors that we are faithful enough for our job, and that our reign of "relative success" may continue on. While only a little bit insulting, this is good news, overall."
 solarempire.36.a:0 "We get to keep our heads, thankfully."
 solarempire.36.b:0 "We have no need for her dictates."
 solarempire.37.t:0 "Imperial Intervention"
 solarempire.37.d:0 "Following our struggle for power and submission to the new Empire, there have been many talks and rumours both in New Mareland and in the Empire surrounding our government's legitimacy and "loyalty" to the Empress. Unfortunately, the Empress herself has caught wind of this intrigue, and she fears that we might not be as loyal as we claim, saying that we still have much sentiment for the enemies of the Empire. Her plan is to remove our current government from power and to install a loyalist pony from the Empire as our new ruler. This would not be received well by anyone but the Imperials across the sea, but do we even have a say against the behemoth that is the Empire?"
 solarempire.37.a:0 "If that's her wish..."
 solarempire.37.b:0 "This is too much, we refuse!"

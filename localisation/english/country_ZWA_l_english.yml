ZWA_muwa_mungu_desc:0 "Deeply intelligent with boundless courage and relentless ambition, Muwa Mungu would have been a prime candidate for UCTA leadership in Ugabi, but the tides of fade did not see it as such.\n\nBorn in what is now the [SLC.GetName], Mungu had old familial ties to Ugabi, where his family fled following a dangerous encounter with Yeti warlords. He was recruited into the Ugabi Central Territorial Army, or UCTA, soon after. He rose the ranks speedily enough, but was undone by a incident of sheer barbarity; after a scuffle with a promising young officer, he departed to enter a fresh imported tank and promptly ran over the officer. When his distant cousin Kijambiya, desperately seeking fresh officers, offered him a place in Aoranda, the pursued Mungu had no choice but to bring his sadism and brutality to the Aorandan Republican Army. Sadly, he was right at home."

ZWA_the_ambassador_desc:0 "Perhaps the finest buckball player to ever come out of Maregypt, the greatest title Astifi Amar ever held was his famous '84 Appleloosa Open victory. Now, he finds himself amidst a herd of republican warlords deep in the Great Lakes, with a very different title to his name.\n\nOriginally a Maregyptian envoy to the Mazwi Empire, chosen for his percieved international appeal and language skills, Amar happened to find himself amidst the markets of Aoranda on the date of the Storm King's invasion, and was soon recruited by the Ugabians. His stay as an Ugabian envoy lasted only a few years, as he soon found himself captured by Republican forces. Imprisoned as a spy, Amar offered to turn coat and provide the Republicans with not only Ugabian intelligence, but that of Maregypt and the entire Great Lakes. President Mbonyu gave him even more than what he asked for, promoting him to the positions of foreign minister, international emissary, and even spymaster.\n\nNo one, most especially himself, is entirely sure how Astifi Amar made it to the military republic of Aoranda, let alone how he became its foremost diplomatic force, but he is a cosmopolitan at heart, and deeply acquainted with harmonic thought. Perhaps the old athlete can win a different glory... that of a prosperous republic with his hoofprints all over it."

### ideas ###

ZWA_young_republic:0 "The Young Republic"
ZWA_young_republic_desc:0 "In the fires of chaos that followed the Storm King's invasion and the collapse of Mazwian authority, the Republic was forged. Led by political idealists influenced by foreign ideologies, it is the first truly republican government in the history of the Great Lakes - albeit one can hardly call it democratic, at least for now. The ultimate ambition of the Republic's leaders is a Great Lakes unified under their rule."
ZWA_divided_tribes:0 "Divided Tribes"
ZWA_divided_tribes_desc:0 "Not all welcomed the new Republic. In fact, most zebras didn't. Traditional tribal chieftains cling on to their power and slaveowners are threatened by the Republic's emancipatory rhetoric. The Republic has many different tribes within its borders and most of them barely tolerate one another, let alone the government. Not only that, but the deposed Mwami of eponymous Aoranda, Nyiragonez, leads an organized resistance against the Republic."
ZWA_army_modifier:0 "Army of Incorrigibles"
ZWA_army_modifier_desc:0 "Instead of apolitical and honorable officials, our military is comprised of the worst of the worst. Deserters from Ugabi's UCTA hold most officer positions, and as such are prone to abuses, corruption, patronage, and brutality, the very same actions that saw them leave or worse, be expelled from, such a prestigious military force. If Uwineza ever wishes to enshrine a true republic in the Great Lakes, she must keep these bandits, looters, and scoundrels on her side, or risk the death of her movement entirely."

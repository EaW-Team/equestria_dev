### character descriptions ###

ZWA_uwineza_mbonyu_desc:0 "Years out from the beginning of the Great Lakes' own Republican Revolution, Uwineza Mbonyu stands more a puppet than a pawn, her destiny charted for her by the warlords, vipers, and scoundrels that surround her and her makeshift republican government. Some day in the past, some time years ago, when her generals first marched into Aoranda and raised the banner of republicanism, there was a dream, a dream that looked all so real, but that dream is dead now. The warlords of the Great Lakes have turned it into a nightmare.\n\nAs Mbonyu finds more and more of her loyal advisors replaced and more and more of her populace turns against her, it is pertinent to look at where she began. Born in Ugabi, Mbonyu was a perfect fit for leadership - charismatic, compassionate, and driven, she rose the ranks of the UCTA and secured a position as officer. With her newfound rank came a visit to Saddle Arabia, where she dabbled in politics and most importantly, republicanism.\n\nShe took her newfound ideological fervour with her back to Ugabi, and when the Storm King struck, Mbonyu did not look back. She and her brigade moved into Aoranda and established the first true republic in the Great Lakes - the Republic of Aoranda, bolstered by a substantial military apparatus filled with deserters from UCTA and ideological comrades. The former, though, began to win out, and commanders like Ale Kijambiya and Muwa Mungu began to replace long-time underlings. Powerless to stop the rise of strong military commanders, Mbonyu has failed to resist the degeneration of the republican dream in Aoranda and the Great Lakes; can she still convince the warlords of the dream, or at least convince them to look the other way on matters of ideology as they march forward in unification? Or must they die so that they cannot corrupt her movement and vanish the republican dream for centuries more? Whatever the choice, Mbonyu must make it, and face the consequences."

ZWA_ale_kijambiya_desc:0 "Ale Kijambiya does not fit the stereotype of a Zebrican warlord. Anything but a stocky, well-groomed, charismatic war hero like the legendary 'Bandolier' Zidon, Kijambiya appears gluttonous, uncouth, and outright silly, more cartoon character than model military zebra. What he suffers in charm, though, he more than makes up for in sheer ambition.\n\nBorn in Ugabi under the control of the Mazwi, Kijambiya wanted for little as part of a merchant family, yet always lacked direction in life. After a series of odd jobs and failed business ventures, Kijambiya finally decided to join the UCTA. As if taking pity on him, his parents practically bankrolled his admission into an immediate leadership rule, so he would not have to prove his physical capabilities.\n\nKijambiya found himself a skilled leader, though, and developed a deep fascination and expertise for tactics and strategy. Convinced of the inadequacy of his peers and superiors in such fields, who he believed to be thuggish followers of central military authority, Kijambiya ran afoul of leadership, and eventually, the circumstances behind his corrupt admission were discovered, along with a whole slew of administrative mishaps in his brigade. Facing expulsion from the military, Kijambiya and his fiercely loyal zebras, who he lavished with wealth, gifts, and priveleges, deserted Ugabi soon after, and found themselves in the midst of another desertion; that of Uwineza Mbonyu.\n\nTo save his hide, Kijambiya joined the republicans, and began expanding his influence across all of Aoranda, becoming one of the most important commanders in the entire country and superseding the political influence of many a local governor. His ambition boundless and his troops firmly under his control, the warlord is perhaps in the best position of all to emerge victorious in Aoranda, yet will there be enough concessions to satisfy an ever-increasing military and the populace which they claim to defend?"

ZWA_muwa_mungu_desc:0 "Deeply intelligent with boundless courage and relentless ambition, Muwa Mungu would have been a prime candidate for UCTA leadership in Ugabi, but the tides of fade did not see it as such.\n\nBorn in what is now the [SLC.GetName], Mungu had old familial ties to Ugabi, where her family fled following a dangerous encounter with Yeti warlords. She was recruited into the Ugabi Central Territorial Army, or UCTA, soon after. She rose the ranks speedily enough, but was undone by a incident of sheer barbarity; after a scuffle with a promising young officer, she departed to enter a fresh imported tank and promptly ran over the officer. When her distant cousin Kijambiya, desperately seeking fresh officers, offered her a place in Aoranda, the pursued Mungu had no choice but to bring her sadism and brutality to the Aorandan Republican Army.\n\nSadly, she was right at home."

ZWA_jeje_zowan_desc:0 "Perhaps the most humane warlord in Aoranda (although that isn't saying much), no one is quite sure how Jejema "Jeje" Zowan ended up in a leadership position at all.\n\nParadoxically to his current position, Zowan had little interest in the UCTA as a child in Bonomane, in stark contrast to his peers, pursuing the lifestyle of a fashionable socialite and curious student as opposed to that of a classical military zebra. Social and financial incentives, finally convinced Zowan to let go of his dream of wealth outside the UCTA and pursue a military career after all. When republican deserters arrived at his station, Zowan found it convenient to desert to their cause, and helped bring down the Bonomane garrison with them. Kijambiya took a liking to the bright, charismatic officer, but most importantly, saw him for what he was - unambitious as far as military matters were considered and as a result, utterly loyal to his superiors.\n\nSome zebras will themselves to power. Zowan, it seemed, had just happened into it."

ZWA_the_ambassador_desc:0 "Perhaps the finest buckball player to ever come out of Maregypt, once upon a time the greatest title Astifi Amar ever held was his famous '84 Appleloosa Open victory. Now, he finds himself amidst a herd of republican warlords deep in the Great Lakes, with a very different title to his name.\n\nOriginally a Maregyptian envoy to the Mazwi Empire, chosen for his percieved international appeal and language skills, Amar happened to find himself amidst the markets of Aoranda on the date of the Storm King's invasion, and was soon recruited by the Ugabians. His stay as an Ugabian envoy lasted only a few years, as he soon found himself captured by Republican forces. Imprisoned as a spy, Amar offered to turn coat and provide the Republicans with not only Ugabian intelligence, but that of Maregypt and the entire Great Lakes. President Mbonyu gave him even more than what he asked for, promoting him to the positions of foreign minister, international emissary, and even spymaster.\n\nNo one, most especially himself, is entirely sure how Astifi Amar made it to the military republic of Aoranda, let alone how he became its foremost diplomatic force, but he is a cosmopolitan at heart, and deeply acquainted with harmonic thought. Perhaps the old athlete can win a different glory... that of a prosperous republic with his hoofprints all over it."

ZWA_rami_zayan_desc:0 "Formerly of a Re'emite enclave in the Great Lakes, Rami Zayan has served as the personal page and aide of Uwineza Mbonyu since her arrival in Aoranda. Dutiful and bright, Rami has done his best to support the President and her closest advisors as best he can, yet a deep naïveté prevents him from supporting drastic measures against warlordism. A devout harmonist, Rami believes all zebra can change if they accept faith in their hearts, and tells Uwineza as much, but the President is less convinced of this harmonic idealism, especially when it comes to those as brutal as the warlords.\n\nThis does not stop the young Re'emite from trying, though."

ZWA_nehle_zuri_desc:0 "Adjuntant to Uwineza Mbonyu, Nehle Zuri has served with the President since the time when both were in the UCTA, and although as devoted to republican ideals as the zebra she serves, Nehle has a much different outlook on the future of the Great Lakes. Bitter and cold, Zuri lost faith in the revolution as it stands years ago, and has grown distinctly cynical about the prospects of liberty in her lifetime. Uwineza motivates her well enough, but away from the military and her superior, Zuri rarely cracks a smile.\n\nRelease me on the warlords, my President, she thinks, and my zebra will tear them apart in only a moment."

ZWA_nyiragonez_desc:0 "It has been said that even an anthropologist with all the resources of the Equestrian Education Association, the knowledge of all the schools of Timbucktu, and the expertise of a thousand Re'emite missions could not even hope to detail even half of the tribes in the Great Lakes region. Nyiragonez may be the only living soul with the abillity to challenge that claim.\n\nBorn on the border of Benzugu and Bonomane, Nyiragonez was born into a Mazwi family with deep ties to tribes and traditions in Ugabi and Aoranda, and as a result developed a cultural tolerance many of her creed always lacked. Her wit and ambition, coupled with the right heritage, saw Nyiragonez catapulted to the very court of the Manza. A deep curiosity for foreign culture and a vast knowledge of the Great Lakes, spurred by her diverse upbringing, led her to become a royal surveyor in the Manza's very own command. Nyiragonez's own brigade, strikingly cosmpolitan by Mazwi standards, would arrive at villages across the country, compile the tally of vital resources, and make sure local leaders were both working within Mazwi legal code, with force if necessary. Hospitable yet authoritative, and a brilliant listener to boot, the expert negotiator that was Nyiragonez would find it hard to understand the hatred that burns in her heart today.\n\nManza Sini's re-organisation of the royal bureaucracy brought an end to the reign of Nyirgonez and her surveyors, yet she did not remain jobless for long - the old Mwami of Aoranda, Ramelu, a handsome and affable administrator, newly-widowed, offered Nyiragonez a place as his lawfully wedded wife. Nyiragonez' stewardship in Aoranda grew prosperous; cultural exchanges were stable, the authority of the Mwami remained absolute, and her experience brought an end to many an ancient feud.\n\nAnd then it all collapsed. Ramelu died without heir, and only days later, Republican warlords in Bonomane swooped into claim Aoranda. Now in revolt in Ramelu's name, Nyiragonez has abandoned the ethnic rule of the Mazwi in favor of a model that harkens back to her days as a surveyor - thousands of homogenous tribal communities, heavily traditionalist and devoutly nationalist, under a wholly decentralized apparatus commanded by a figurehead with the experience only a Nyiragonez could bring. One Re'emite adivsor of hers sneers and calls it "national anarchism". The new Mwami simply calls it common sense."

ZWA_young_republic:0 "The Young Republic"
ZWA_young_republic_desc:0 "In the fires of chaos that followed the Storm King's invasion and the collapse of Mazwian authority, the Republic was forged. Led by political idealists influenced by foreign ideologies, it is the first truly republican government in the history of the Great Lakes - albeit one can hardly call it democratic, at least for now. The ultimate ambition of the Republic's leaders is a Great Lakes unified under their rule."

ZWA_young_republic_cooler:0 "The New Republic"
ZWA_young_republic_cooler_desc:0 "In the fires of chaos that followed the Storm King's invasion and the collapse of Mazwian authority, the Republic was forged. Led by political idealists influenced by foreign ideologies, it is the first truly republican government in the history of the Great Lakes - and perhaps, in time, it will be the first truly democratic government in the Great Lakes. Forwards, towards unification!."

ZWA_cooler_republic:0 "Republic of Strength"
ZWA_cooler_republic_desc:0 "In the fires of chaos that followed the Storm King's invasion and the collapse of Mazwian authority, a Republic was forged. A fragile republic, a false republic, a fraudulent republic. President Kijambiya has built a new republic, one free from standing committees and congressional plenums - one of meritocracy, and strength!"

ZWA_divided_tribes:0 "Divided Tribes"
ZWA_divided_tribes_desc:0 "Not all welcomed the new Republic. In fact, most zebras didn't. Traditional tribal chieftains cling on to their power and slaveowners are threatened by the Republic's emancipatory rhetoric. The Republic has many different tribes within its borders and most of them barely tolerate one another, let alone the government. Not only that, but the deposed Mwami of eponymous Aoranda, Nyiragonez, leads an organized resistance against the Republic."

ZWA_army_modifier:0 "Army of Incorrigibles"
ZWA_army_modifier_desc:0 "Instead of apolitical and honorable officials, our military is comprised of the worst of the worst. Deserters from Ugabi's UCTA hold most officer positions, and as such are prone to abuses, corruption, patronage, and brutality, the very same actions that saw them leave or worse, be expelled from, such a prestigious military force. If Uwineza ever wishes to enshrine a true republic in the Great Lakes, she must keep these bandits, looters, and scoundrels on her side, or risk the death of her movement entirely."

ZWA_bailing_out_landowners:0 "Bailing Out Landowners"
ZWA_bailing_out_landowners_desc:0 "Although we are no longer subsidizing the adaucious appetities of our warlords, the abolition of slavery has left us with new necesities for which to allocate our budget towards."

ZWA_legacy_of_the_republic_desc:0 "Uwineza Mbonyu may have failed to carry out her dream, but we still remember. Many may disagree with her methods, but her ideal of a Great Lakes, unified, secure, free will be restored... or we will die trying."

ZWA_legacy_of_the_tyrant:0 "Never Another Uwineza"
ZWA_legacy_of_the_tyrant:0 "With the help of vicious warlords, Uwineza Mbonyu turned a prosperous, fertile, and peaceful country into her own playground for republican ideals. She is gone now, but her scars linger, and our people's memory is yet strong of the warlords who sent them into chaos. Never again."

ZWA_pp_loss_spirit:0 "Political Concessions"
ZWA_pp_loss_spirit_desc:0 "An appointment here, an appointment there... tribals and popular resistance groups are being placated, at the cost of our own political power."

# General Note to Horseworders: I like describing these descriptions in a lot of detail to help you, but I really do not care how much you actually use from them. Use your own ideas! Just fit them with the general theme.

aoranda.1.t:0 "#TODO EVENT NAME" #Toasted Butter
aoranda.1.d:0 "#TODO, Uwineza and co. (the charismatic yet washed-up ambassador, the hard military zeeb Nehle Zuri, and her idealist page Rami Zayan) and  assess the situation in the great lakes and the possibility of military unification in the future, but realize a major issue in terms of actually building a military to unify - the warlords: their opinions and notes on everything should be an intro to the warlords and what they're doing to the country (economic, political influence etc. that they hold, brutality, unprofessionalism, etc.)"
aoranda.1.a:0 "We must reign them in, and fast."

aoranda.2.t:0 "The Ringleader"
aoranda.2.d:0 "#TODO, Uwineza meets with the first of the generals in order to explain to him the necesity for him to get him and his soldiers' act together in order to crush the traitors and unify the great lakes. this serves as an introduction to the character of Ale Kijambiya, a big doofus, a silly, uncouth, gluttonous zebra adorned with badges in his mansion outside the capitol, adorned with military finery, exotic pets, hunting trophies, and other expensive things you could think of. Still, he is tactically adept, and his buffoonery matters little to his commanders, who he grants gifts and concessions a plenty to keep in line, mostly out of the public pocket. Some important things that could be (but don't have to be) touched on in the intro event are as such: Ale is using enforcers like Mungu to terrorize the populace, Ale is lavishly spending for the benefit of himself and his soldiers instead of the actual maintenance of the ARA and his units in particular in it, Ale is putting on a facade of an idiot to disguise from the fact he's centralizing power into his own hands. #gluttonous lavish charlatan warlord"
aoranda.2.a:0 "A farce of a general for a farce of a republic..."

aoranda.3.t:0 "The Madmare"
aoranda.3.d:0 "#TODO, Uwineza meets with the second of the generals, but with a much more hostile attitude ahead of the discussion - this one's particularly foul, and has practically spat on republican authority and any ideas of unification, preparing to loot and raid, even holding de-facto slaves in her estate that she promises will be phased out after full abolitionism. This is in the introduction to Muwa Mungu, a generally insane motorized commander who has expelled from the UCTA, the ugabian military, after she ran over another zebra with a tank. Things Uwineza could discuss with her include incidents of bruality toward peasants supposedly under the control of her army, proto-slavery even in areas where abolitionism is supposed to be in beginning stages, or just general things that makes sense in terms of brutality. Mungu is completely uninterested in talking with Uwineza and openly insults and challenges her - she'll be one to get in line, and fast, but in this meeting Uwineza leaves a bit defeated, and scared. #crazy tank waifu warlord"
aoranda.3.a:0 "Too crazy even for even Kijambiya to tolerate..."

aoranda.4.t:0 "The Stooge"
aoranda.4.d:0 "#TODO, Uwineza meets with the third of the generals, but with a much more friendly attitude ahead of the discussion - this one's particularly stupid, and also a complete stooge for the rest of the band. a socialite and a charismatic leader, Jejema "Jeje" Zowan has little to no understanding of tactics, although he is an alright enough commander, but is loyal to the warlords who recruited him and is a perfect "diplomat" for their activities. Uwineza visits Zowan in a palacial estate stocked with servants and filled with various members of high society, religious figures, fortune tellers, numerous wives (he follows an obscure religious sect of God which sees polygamy as of uptmost virtue) and general spiritualist stuff -  he likes Uwineza well enough but has no interest in taking her offer to betray the warlords from within and admits he can do little to either bolster his own brigade's position in terms of the upcoming war of unification or that of his allies. #stupid socialite patsy warlord"
aoranda.4.a:0 "And he still sides with them..."

aoranda.5.t:0 "The House of the Umutera"
aoranda.5.d:0 "#TODO, Uwineza comes to the House of the Umutera, the Umutera being Macharomancy diviners. The Ambassador, prgamatic and Zuri, protective, encourage her not to base her decisions on the warlords on such a stupid practice, especially something as dumb as ceremonial lance throwing and telling fortunes based on the spot the lance picks, but Uwineza is deeply unsure herself of the decisions to take with the warlords, and needs a bit of randomness to decide... Rami voices faith in this, and believes God will show her the way to destroy the warlords (He must, right?). The event ends with Uwineza entering the house, a sprawling, rune adorned apparatus in the capital filled with devotees - the head bows her head and gestures Uwineza to come forth"

ZWA_army_management_desc:0 "The Aoranda Republican Army was founded upon the creation of our maiden Republic from a disparate group of deserters, idealists, foreign volunteers, and even those of Re'emite enclaves. Now, however, these groups have been slowly marginalized, and today's ARA can be characterized by one faction - the warlords. We must keep them in line to secure our Republic, while balancing their power with that of our very own President Uwineza Mbonyu.\n\nThe loyalty of the ARA to Uwineza is currently §Y[?ZWA_army_loyalty]%§!.\n\nThe power of Uwineza Mbonyu is currently §C[?ZWA_power_of_uwineza]%§!.\n\nEffects that influence these variables may coincide with updates to the §YArmy of Incorrigibles§! national spirit."

ZWA_war_support_for_power_desc:0 "Our military prescence has gone too far to the point that it disturbs local development and sets our populace against Uwineza. Demobilisation may harm our support for further war with Ugabi, but it is necessary to rekindle our support among the common zebra."

ZWA_party_popularity_for_power:0 "Approve Dissident Gatherings"
ZWA_party_popularity_for_power_desc:0 "Dissident gatherings have largely been suppressed by the military government, an action that spits in the face of true republicanism. Let all have a say, and let the President judge their actions on merit, not what organisation they happen to be a member of."

ZWA_political_power_for_power_desc:0 "Tribal assemblies are perhaps the only form of democracy left here in Aoranda.

ZWA_young_republic:0 "The Young Republic"
ZWA_young_republic_desc:0 "In the fires of chaos that followed the Storm King's invasion and the collapse of Mazwian authority, the Republic was forged. Led by political idealists influenced by foreign ideologies, it is the first truly republican government in the history of the Great Lakes - albeit one can hardly call it democratic, at least for now. The ultimate ambition of the Republic's leaders is a Great Lakes unified under their rule."
ZWA_divided_tribes:0 "Divided Tribes"
ZWA_divided_tribes_desc:0 "Not all welcomed the new Republic. In fact, most zebras didn't. Traditional tribal chieftains cling on to their power and slaveowners are threatened by the Republic's emancipatory rhetoric. The Republic has many different tribes within its borders and most of them barely tolerate one another, let alone the government. Not only that, but the deposed Mwami of eponymous Aoranda, Nyiragonez, leads an organized resistance against the Republic."

 ZWA_melee_equipment_0_short:0 "Bows & Spears"
 ZWA_melee_equipment_0_desc:0 "The humble spear and the bow have been the traditional weapons of choice for warriors in the Great Lakes region. The spears and arrows usually have tips of sharpened well-forged iron, capable of piercing the most commonly used protection, padded armour and wooden shields, effectively. Additionally, arrows are often coated in deadly poisons created by potion-makers, meaning even a minor wound can be lethal."
 ZWA_melee_equipment_1:0 "Mazwian Matchlock Musket"
 ZWA_melee_equipment_1_short:0 "Mazwian Musket"
 ZWA_melee_equipment_1_desc:0 "The matchlock musket was a revolutionary weapon in the Great Lakes. With their extensive gold reserves, the Mazwians imported thousands of firearms from abroad and eventually learned to make them by themselves. This weapon was instrumental in their rapid expansion which led to the domination of the Imperial Mazwi for two centuries."
 ZWA_infantry_equipment_0:0 "Rifle-Musket"
 ZWA_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "Rifle-Musket"
 ZWA_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "Rifled barrels started appearing in the Great Lakes only when foreign rifles were imported from abroad. While initally used alongside traditional smoothbore weapons, the barrels of muskets were gradually replaced with rifled ones. These transitional weapons were rather crude as local blacksmiths were still learning the rifling process and the creation of conical hollow bullets that made rifles more effective than muskets."
 
 ZWA_artillery_equipment_0:0 "Iron Cannons"
 ZWA_artillery_equipment_0_short:0 "Iron Cannons"
 ZWA_artillery_equipment_0_desc:0 "As zebras in the Great Lakes acquired artillery from abroad, they primarily used them on war canoes to dominate the many rivers and lakes of the region. This gave waterborne vessels impressive firepower and greatly increased their importance in warfare. Of course, sometimes it was necessary to use such cannons on land. In such cases cannons were mounted on wheels dragged by a group of slaves."

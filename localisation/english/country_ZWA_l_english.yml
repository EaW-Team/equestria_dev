### character descriptions ###

ZWA_uwineza_mbonyu_desc:0 "Years out from the beginning of the Great Lakes' own Republican Revolution, Uwineza Mbonyu stands more a puppet than a pawn, her destiny charted for her by the warlords, vipers, and scoundrels that surround her and her makeshift republican government. Some day in the past, some time years ago, when her generals first marched into Aoranda and raised the banner of republicanism, there was a dream, a dream that looked all so real, but that dream is dead now. The warlords of the Great Lakes have turned it into a nightmare.\n\nAs Mbonyu finds more and more of her loyal advisors replaced and more and more of her populace turns against her, it is pertinent to look at where she began. Born in Ugabi, Mbonyu was a perfect fit for leadership - charismatic, compassionate, and driven, she rose the ranks of the UCTA and secured a position as officer. With her newfound rank came a visit to Saddle Arabia, where she dabbled in politics and most importantly, republicanism.\n\nShe took her newfound ideological fervour with her back to Ugabi, and when the Storm King struck, Mbonyu did not look back. She and her brigade moved into Aoranda and established the first true republic in the Great Lakes - the Republic of Aoranda, bolstered by a substantial military apparatus filled with deserters from UCTA and ideological comrades. The former, though, began to win out, and commanders like Ale Kijambiya and Muwa Mungu began to replace long-time underlings. Powerless to stop the rise of strong military commanders, Mbonyu has failed to resist the degeneration of the republican dream in Aoranda and the Great Lakes; can she still convince the warlords of the dream, or at least convince them to look the other way on matters of ideology as they march forward in unification? Or must they die so that they cannot corrupt her movement and vanish the republican dream for centuries more? Whatever the choice, Mbonyu must make it, and face the consequences."
ZWA_ale_kijambiya_desc:0 "Ale Kijambiya does not fit the stereotype of a Zebrican warlord. Anything but a stocky, well-groomed, charismatic war hero like the legendary 'Bandolier' Zidon, Kijambiya appears gluttonous, uncouth, and outright silly, more cartoon character than model military zebra. What he suffers in charm, though, he more than makes up for in sheer ambition.\n\nBorn in Ugabi under the control of the Mazwi, Kijambiya wanted for little as part of a merchant family, yet always lacked direction in life. After a series of odd jobs and failed business ventures, Kijambiya finally decided to join the UCTA. As if taking pity on him, his parents practically bankrolled his admission into an immediate leadership rule, so he would not have to prove his physical capabilities.\n\nKijambiya found himself a skilled leader, though, and developed a deep fascination and expertise for tactics and strategy. Convinced of the inadequacy of his peers and superiors in such fields, who he believed to be thuggish followers of central military authority, Kijambiya ran afoul of leadership, and eventually, the circumstances behind his corrupt admission were discovered, along with a whole slew of administrative mishaps in his brigade. Facing expulsion from the military, Kijambiya and his fiercely loyal zebras, who he lavished with wealth, gifts, and priveleges, deserted Ugabi soon after, and found themselves in the midst of another desertion; that of Uwineza Mbonyu.\n\nTo save his hide, Kijambiya joined the republicans, and began expanding his influence across all of Aoranda, becoming one of the most important commanders in the entire country and superseding the political influence of many a local governor. His ambition boundless and his troops firmly under his control, the warlord is perhaps in the best position of all to emerge victorious in Aoranda, yet will there be enough concessions to satisfy an ever-increasing military and the populace which they claim to defend?"
ZWA_muwa_mungu_desc:0 "Deeply intelligent with boundless courage and relentless ambition, Muwa Mungu would have been a prime candidate for UCTA leadership in Ugabi, but the tides of fade did not see it as such.\n\nBorn in what is now the [SLC.GetName], Mungu had old familial ties to Ugabi, where her family fled following a dangerous encounter with Yeti warlords. She was recruited into the Ugabi Central Territorial Army, or UCTA, soon after. She rose the ranks speedily enough, but was undone by a incident of sheer barbarity; after a scuffle with a promising young officer, she departed to enter a fresh imported tank and promptly ran over the officer. When her distant cousin Kijambiya, desperately seeking fresh officers, offered her a place in Aoranda, the pursued Mungu had no choice but to bring her sadism and brutality to the Aorandan Republican Army.\n\nSadly, she was right at home."
ZWA_jeje_zowan_desc:0 "Perhaps the most humane warlord in Aoranda (although that isn't saying much), no one is quite sure how Jejema "Jeje" Zowan ended up in a leadership position at all.\n\nParadoxically to his current position, Zowan had little interest in the UCTA as a child in Bonomane, in stark contrast to his peers, pursuing the lifestyle of a fashionable socialite and curious student as opposed to that of a classical military zebra. Social and financial incentives, finally convinced Zowan to let go of his dream of wealth outside the UCTA and pursue a military career after all. When republican deserters arrived at his station, Zowan found it convenient to desert to their cause, and helped bring down the Bonomane garrison with them. Kijambiya took a liking to the bright, charismatic officer, but most importantly, saw him for what he was - unambitious as far as military matters were considered and as a result, utterly loyal to his superiors.\n\nSome zebras will themselves to power. Zowan, it seemed, had just happened into it."
ZWA_the_ambassador_desc:0 "Perhaps the finest buckball player to ever come out of Maregypt, once upon a time the greatest title Astifi Amar ever held was his famous '84 Appleloosa Open victory. Now, he finds himself amidst a herd of republican warlords deep in the Great Lakes, with a very different title to his name.\n\nOriginally a Maregyptian envoy to the Mazwi Empire, chosen for his percieved international appeal and language skills, Amar happened to find himself amidst the markets of Aoranda on the date of the Storm King's invasion, and was soon recruited by the Ugabians. His stay as an Ugabian envoy lasted only a few years, as he soon found himself captured by Republican forces. Imprisoned as a spy, Amar offered to turn coat and provide the Republicans with not only Ugabian intelligence, but that of Maregypt and the entire Great Lakes. President Mbonyu gave him even more than what he asked for, promoting him to the positions of foreign minister, international emissary, and even spymaster.\n\nNo one, most especially himself, is entirely sure how Astifi Amar made it to the military republic of Aoranda, let alone how he became its foremost diplomatic force, but he is a cosmopolitan at heart, and deeply acquainted with harmonic thought. Perhaps the old athlete can win a different glory... that of a prosperous republic with his hoofprints all over it."

### ideas ###

ZWA_young_republic:0 "The Young Republic"
ZWA_young_republic_desc:0 "In the fires of chaos that followed the Storm King's invasion and the collapse of Mazwian authority, the Republic was forged. Led by political idealists influenced by foreign ideologies, it is the first truly republican government in the history of the Great Lakes - albeit one can hardly call it democratic, at least for now. The ultimate ambition of the Republic's leaders is a Great Lakes unified under their rule."
ZWA_divided_tribes:0 "Divided Tribes"
ZWA_divided_tribes_desc:0 "Not all welcomed the new Republic. In fact, most zebras didn't. Traditional tribal chieftains cling on to their power and slaveowners are threatened by the Republic's emancipatory rhetoric. The Republic has many different tribes within its borders and most of them barely tolerate one another, let alone the government. Not only that, but the deposed Mwami of eponymous Aoranda, Nyiragonez, leads an organized resistance against the Republic."
ZWA_army_modifier:0 "Army of Incorrigibles"
ZWA_army_modifier_desc:0 "Instead of apolitical and honorable officials, our military is comprised of the worst of the worst. Deserters from Ugabi's UCTA hold most officer positions, and as such are prone to abuses, corruption, patronage, and brutality, the very same actions that saw them leave or worse, be expelled from, such a prestigious military force. If Uwineza ever wishes to enshrine a true republic in the Great Lakes, she must keep these bandits, looters, and scoundrels on her side, or risk the death of her movement entirely."

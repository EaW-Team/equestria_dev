###------> Artillery   <><> <><> <><> <><> <><>
 artillery_a:0 "Refined Loading Mechanisms"
 artillery_a_desc:0 "Improved shell loading and ejection for all of our artillery pieces allow for a quick and seamless manual cycle that allows for continuous firing for our light and medium guns. Even the heavier pieces can output several shells a minute with this new loading system."
 artillery_c:0 "Streamlined Fire Coordination"
 artillery_c_desc:0 "When an artillery spotter is present, it is paramount that communication between the spotter and the responding battery is smooth and accurate. New language and terminology specifically designed to eliminate misunderstandings and to reduce the time between spotting and firing can be implemented, along with better radio integration between the spotter and gunner."
 artillery_d:0 "Grid Bearing Sighting"
 artillery_d_desc:0 "Resolving the azimuth of firing solutions was previously done by adjusting firing data based on the 'zero' of the orientated gun. By instead using the actual bearing to the target by grid bearing, we can reduce calculation errors ensure that the artillery battery is correctly laid."
 artillery_f:0 "Prism Paralleloscopes"
 artillery_f_desc:0 "An improvement over previous plain-mirror paralleloscopes, a prism improves the indirect firing capabilities by functioning as an aiming point in the horizontal plane during barrages. It is also particularly useful at night, as it does not require aiming points with lights attached to them."
#-<><><>
 rocket_artillery_a:0 "Additional Launch Rails"
 rocket_artillery_a_desc:0 "At times, a simple solution is the most effective one. The addition of more launch rails and racks increases the overall ordenance launched by a single rocket launcher carriage, promising more intensive barrages per launch."
 rocket_artillery_b:0 "Rocket Control Mechanisms"
 rocket_artillery_b_desc:0 "With the introduction of new control mechanisms for each rocket, such as self-stabilising fins, our rockets are far less likely to fly off course and instead shall hit their target more often."
# rocket_artillery_c:0 "X"
# rocket_artillery_c_desc:0 "X"
 rocket_artillery_d:0 "Specialised Rockets"
 rocket_artillery_d_desc:0 "Sometimes there is a circumstantial need for greater or lower area-of-effect on the battlefield, and a 'universal' rocket will not be as effective. Smaller and more numerous rockets can expand the area of fire whereas larger, more sophisticated ammunition can be more discriminate to tighten the bombardment zones."
 rocket_artillery_e:0 "High Octane Rocket Fuel"
 rocket_artillery_e_desc:0 "Elsewhere, our technical experience in both ballistic missile and rocket technology has introduced new specially-prepared rocket fuel that is incredibly high octane that improves on the flight characteristics of our ammunitions."
#-<><><>
 antiair_a:0 "Ballistic Computers"
 antiair_a_desc:0 "With the rise of jet aircraft, trajectory calculations by gunners are too slow for our anti-air guns to be effective. Integrating rudimentary computerised ballistic calculators, we can more correctly track and down fast enemy aircraft."
 antiair_b:0 "Gun Laying Radar"
 antiair_b_desc:0 "Miniaturisation of radar systems allow for individual guns to use their own radar domes or dishes to better detect and track aircaft, eliminiating the need of a more extensive and expensive radar relay that which would have previously coordinated with dozens of guns."
# antiair_c:0 "X"
# antiair_c_desc:0 "X"
 antiair_d:0 "Autoloaders"
 antiair_d_desc:0 "To maintain the competitive edge of our anti-aircraft guns, larger rounds are required, which interfere with the sustained rate of fire of lower calibres. Introducing mechanical autoloaders, AA gun crews can more readily maintain similar rates of fire of prior calibres while throwing heavier ordinance skywards."
 antiair_e:0 "Analogue Directors"
 antiair_e_desc:0 "Though somewhat impractical for smaller gun carriages, a dedicated electronic auxiliary predictor capable of quick trigonometric firing solutions drastically improve the efficacy of our heavier anti-aircraft guns, as jetcraft continues to break new speed records. It is thanks to these cumbersome directors that our conventional AA is still relevant in this new age."
#-<><><>
 antitank_a:0 "Plastic Explosive Ammunition"
 antitank_a_desc:0 "The introduction of High-Explosive Squash Head (HESH) or High-Explosive Plastic (HEP) ammunition was somewhat overshadowed by HEAT. However, refinements in the plastic explosive have made HESH and HEP rounds deadly due to improved spalling properties."
 antitank_b:0 "Fin-Stabilised Ammunition"
 antitank_b_desc:0 "With the simple addition of fin stabilisers to the core of our anti-tank rounds, our anti-tank rounds will lose far less speed when travelling to their intended targets, reducing dispersion as well as increasing their penetrative capacity."
# antitank_c:0 "X"
# antitank_c_desc:0 "X"
 antitank_d:0 "High-Low Pressure System"
 antitank_d_desc:0 "Utilising the pressure differential between the high pressure gases of ignition and the low pressure of the chamber, we can drastically cut down on equipment and ammunition weight while maintaining the same ballistics as those of a conventional design. This will enable massive upscaling of the calibre of our ammunition, further improving our dedicated anti-tank batteries."
 antitank_e:0 "Nightvision Integration"
 antitank_e_desc:0 "Improvements in nightvision technologies have eased the integration of these devices on our weapon platforms, significantly improving the efficacy of our anti-tank guns in low-light conditions. In many circumstances, our gunners will be able to hit a fast moving vehicle in the dead of night!"


###------> Infantry   <><> <><> <><> <><> <><>
 infantry_at_a:0 "Infantry Anti-Tank III"
 infantry_at_a_desc:0 "Out of every possible means of delivering ordinance against armoured targets, rocket-based weapons have shown to be the most effective. Arming our soldiers with these anti-tank rockets will make them a deadly foe to enemy armour."
 infantry_at_b:0 "Infantry Anti-Tank IV"
 infantry_at_b_desc:0 "Refinements of our anti-tank rocket launchers have crystallised to the recoilless platforms that are lightweight, can be shouldered, and provide the greatest caliber of ordinance against enemy targets. There is nothing more terrifying to a tanker than a soldier lying in wait with such a weapon."
#-<><><>
 advanced_infantry_weapons_a:0 "Improved Infantry Equipment IV"
 advanced_infantry_weapons_a_desc:0 "New efforts in standardisations for personal kits will allow us to focus on only certain firearms for further design improvements such as select-fire for assault rifles and better handling to make our soldiers even deadlier."
 advanced_infantry_weapons_c:0 "Improved Infantry Equipment V"
 advanced_infantry_weapons_c_desc:0 "With newer light-weight weaponry introduced with more modern weapons, soldier kits can allow for other equipment such as MREs, additional grenades or ammunition, all of which lengthens the staying power of our soldiers before they must withdraw."
 advanced_infantry_weapons_d:0 "Improved Infantry Equipment VI"
 advanced_infantry_weapons_d_desc:0 "A new generation of modern firearms may just be beyond the horizon, but that doesn't mean that further refinements of our current generation cannot be made. New modular designs improve ease of maintenance, all in service to making the lone soldier capable of fighting for as long as possible without support."
#-<><><>
 paratroopers_a:0 "Paratroopers IV"
 paratroopers_a_desc:0 "Special transport plane modifications that enable our troops to repel and exit from their transports more quickly will allow for smoother operations in harsh conditions."
 paratroopers_b:0 "Paratroopers V"
 paratroopers_b_desc:0 "Compact weaponry and lightweight equipment increases the mobility of our paratrooper units, allowing them to carry more gear when a specialized mission demands it."
 paratroopers_c:0 "Paratroopers VI"
 paratroopers_c_desc:0 "Further training enhancements designed to help our air assault units during night-time operations will make these missions more viable and lower the risk associated with them."
#-<><><>
 marines_a:0 "Marines IV"
 marines_a_desc:0 "Unconventional stealth and close combat techniques, learned and honed by our forces during past conflicts, will be taught to our special forces to ensure that the knowledge is not lost."
 marines_b:0 "Marines V"
 marines_b_desc:0 "Night-time operations are becoming increasingly viable thanks to new technologies. Night vision scopes and goggles allow our marines to operate just as well in the dark as they do in the light."
 marines_c:0 "Marines VI"
 marines_c_desc:0 "Amphibious operations are a mess of difficult environmental, physical, and psychological challenges that put to doubt the resolve of even the most seasoned soldier. Our only hope for our marines is to remove this hesitation to the point where they'd gladly charge against these obstacles and to overcome them every time."
#-<><><>
 mountaineers_a:0 "Mountain Infantry IV"
 mountaineers_a_desc:0 "It is often times simply not enough to train our specialised mountaineers to survive in their designated combat zones. We must instil into these hardened soldiers a fighting will so ardent and so stubborn, that even the mountains upon which they fight in would find difficult to break."
 mountaineers_b:0 "Mountain Infantry V"
 mountaineers_b_desc:0 "While our troops have been trained to survive and thrive in arduous conditions, their weapons must also be handle sub-zero temperatures. Making special weapon variants for our mountaineers may prove beneficial."
 mountaineers_c:0 "Mountain Infantry VI"
 mountaineers_c_desc:0 "Helicopters capable of being used in high altitudes and vehicles that can traverse treacherous mountain terrain are key to making sure that our mountaineering units are as mobile and advanced as possible."
#-<><><>
 support_weapons_a:0 "Support Weapons V"
 support_weapons_a_desc:0 "Despite some notable drawbacks and ethical questions, infantry flamethrowers can be highly effective provided they are used in the correct environment and circumstances."
 support_weapons_b:0 "Support Weapons VI"
 support_weapons_b_desc:0 "Specialised grenades, including incendiary, smoke, and tear gas variants, are normally only used by special forces. Outfitting our standard infantry units with these grenades may give our soldiers a tactical advantage in certain scenarios."
 support_weapons_c:0 "Support Weapons VII"
 support_weapons_c_desc:0 "Assault rifles have changed the dynamic of the infantry squad, and though there aren't enough of these new rifles to arm every squad member, even having a single soldier designated as the chosen riflecreature necessitates changes in how infantry squads operate. Dedicated assault and defence squads with the appropriate weapons improve their combat ability in their respective roles and enhance our army's staying power in battle."
 support_weapons_d:0 "Support Weapons VIII"
 support_weapons_d_desc:0 "It is time to update our light and heavy machine guns, as new techniques and technologies have become available that can be used to produce more effective heavy weaponry."
 support_weapons_e:0 "Support Weapons IX"
 support_weapons_e_desc:0 "Making internal improvements to our support weapons will help to increase their lifespan by reducing wear and tear, allowing them to fire for longer before needing a barrel replacement."
 support_weapons_f:0 "Support Weapons X"
support_weapons_f_desc:0 "Trials done with newly developed anti-personnel mines have shown them to be more effective than the current models, with a smaller signature and larger blast radius."

#-<><><>
 night_vision_a:0 "Night Vision III"
 night_vision_a_desc:0 "The ability to see the enemy while they cannot is paramount. This new technology helps us toward that goal."

###------> Electronics   <><> <><> <><> <><> <><>
 future_radar:0 "Thaumaturgically Focused RADAR"
 future_radar_desc:0 "A significant breakthrough in crystal application into transmitter RADAR arrays dramatically improves the clarity and focus of sent signals. When calibrated correctly, the spell matrix enables the RADAR signal to phase through adverse weather conditions with little signal degradation and to self-correct the reflected signal when the detected object causes a phase shift. Though incredibly complex, this system overcomes many of the issues of previous generations of RADAR."
 future_radar_2:0 "Thaumaturgic Bistatic RADAR"
 future_radar_2_desc:0 "Somewhat unexpectedly to most proponents of monostatic RADAR, bistatic RADAR still shows much promise with further development. Though more complex due to the distant arrays for signal transmission and reception, we've found that this system can detect objects with low reflection properties when augmented with specialised crystals. This makes well-prepared bistatic RADAR arrays exceptionally suited for detection at very long ranges."
 future_radar_3:0 "RADAR Imaging and Mapping"
 future_radar_3_desc:0 "Development in interferometry crossed over into the field of RADAR, as mathematicians have discovered a way of creating two-dimensional images with a specialised synthetic-aperture RADAR (SAR). The SAR device processes the RADAR pulse echoes it receives to create pictures of the target scene. Usually mounted on aircraft, SAR can produce accurate maps and images from afar, unlike typical aerial photography."
 future_radar_4:0 "Airborne Early Warning"
 future_radar_4_desc:0 "The development of dedicated Airborne Early Warning planes allows us to locate enemy ships and planes even without radar arrays, drastically improving our performance over hostile airspace. However, the technology is still in its infancy and requires further developments."
#-<><><>
 future_computing_machine:0 "Room-Sized Digital Computers"
 future_computing_machine_desc:0 "As of right now, the only way to increase the computational power and speed of existing digital computers is, much like how some tanks are designed, to add more of everything: more function tables, panels, vacuum tubes, and ring counters. The addition of these components make such computers unwieldy and expensive, but the benefits of thousand-cycles-per-second operation times and functionality outweigh the costs."
 future_computing_machine_2:0 "Early Random-Access Memory"
 future_computing_machine_2_desc:0 "The sequential access system limits existing computer memory, needlessly slowing down data processing in digital computers. However, a breakthrough experiment with cathode ray tubes that can display a grid of dots has created a fast random-access memory (RAM) system that cycles far faster than acoustic delay line memory systems. As such, new computers that use the RAM system will process stored data at unprecedented speeds."
 future_computing_machine_3:0 "Magical Electron Tubes"
 future_computing_machine_3_desc:0 "Hot cathodes used in vacuum tubes are prone to burnouts when overloaded with high currents, sometimes blowing out the electron tube itself. However, new insight into thaumaturgic materials has created a vacuum tube capable of cold thermionic emission with no decrease in electric output. These magical cathodes can resist higher electric charges, allowing our new computers to operate at increased speeds."
 future_computing_machine_4:0 "Early Transistor Computers"
 future_computing_machine_4_desc:0 "The invention of bipolar transistors will usher in a whole new generation of electronic computers. Now entirely comprised of integrated circuit boards, future computers have better scalability to reduce their overall size without losing their computational power. Some experts believe that the 'chips' of the circuit boards will continue to shrink in size, suggesting that in the future, we might even see consumer computers more powerful than what we currently use!"
#-<><><>
 future_encryption:0 "Magically Marked Cyphers"
 future_encryption_desc:0 "We could do much more to advance non-magical encryption, but we can immediately apply a layer of defence via markers. Much like how each firearm has its unique identifying markings, we can introduce a transcribed matrix of a predetermined magical crystal in our messages. To further confuse foreign intelligence gatherers, we can use multiple transcriptions matrices that denote critical messages from the fake ones used in our counter-intelligence operations."
 future_encryption_2:0 "Unstable Sorting Algorithms"
 future_encryption_2_desc:0 "If specially set up, we can program computers to sort lists of digits randomly. With cypher machines adapted to displace and sort coded messages in a binary format, this additional layer of encryption strengthens our communications even further. We can trust our machines to turn our messages into unreadable gibberish for everyone except us."
 future_encryption_3:0 "Continuous Thaumaturgic Scrambling"
 future_encryption_3_desc:0 "Developments made in enchantments have produced a self-contained spell that can automatically apply itself to messages. The magic itself is not overly complex, continually jumbling the signal until a receiver enchanted with the appropriate crystal receives it. Pairing crystals for this purpose used to be costly and time-consuming, but we've found a way to mass-produce this process to incorporate for most in the cypher machines in our use."
 future_decryption:0 "Thaumaturgic Tracking and Imprinting"
 future_decryption_desc:0 "Thaumaturgic tracking has been used in the past to trace physical messages to gather the locations of senders and receivers. Radio signals proved difficult to apply this technique, but specialised spell matrices attuned to radio waves allow us to track messages. Once we have the trail, we can magically imprint different spells to gather additional information beyond the message itself."
 future_decryption_2:0 "Brute-Force Calculators"
 future_decryption_2_desc:0 "With new, larger, and more powerful computers, cyphers that were previously nigh-impossible to attack directly by pure guesswork are now possible to crack. In addition, dedicated brute-force calculators are enchanted to distinguish likely messages from the millions of unusable results. The enchantment is still unintelligent, and the thousands of results that it produces will require a pair of eyes to find the actual messages, but the time and effort saved is invaluable."
 future_decryption_3:0 "Limited Scrying Methods"
 future_decryption_3_desc:0 "Following our efforts in perfecting the thaumaturgic imprinting of encoded signals, we've refined a complex scrying spell that can temporarily spy on the immediate area of a cypher machine receiving the tracked signal. Though somewhat prone to not firing and only producing a window that lasts seconds to reduce the chance of detection, successful scryings can reveal an encoder's workstation, a treasure trove of information."

 future_encryption_lar:0 "Magically Marked Cyphers"
 future_encryption_lar_desc:0 "We could do much more to advance non-magical encryption, but we can immediately apply a layer of defence via markers. Much like how each firearm has its unique identifying markings, we can introduce a transcribed matrix of a predetermined magical crystal in our messages. To further confuse foreign intelligence gatherers, we can use multiple transcriptions matrices that denote critical messages from the fake ones used in our counter-intelligence operations."

###------> Industrial    <><> <><> <><> <><> <><>
 streamlined_line_a:0 "Streamlined Assembly Lines"
 streamlined_line_a_desc:0 "Further simplification of the workers' tasks can be achieved by offloading most of the more arduous and mind-numbing jobs to machines. This additional automation reduces most of the workers to simply keeping the automated devices working as intended, but it does leave them at a disadvantage should the factories have to switch production. Still, this massive leap of productivity is worth the inflexibility of our assembly lines."
 flexible_line_a:0 "Additional Worker Training"
 flexible_line_a_desc:0 "Unexpected failures are a constant worry of our factory supervisors. It has become evident that the assembly line workers are the most adaptive aspect of our assembly lines. New training regimens specifically aimed to expand the range of workers' skills beyond their assigned workstations can better prepare them for unexpected shifts in factory productions. They're not experts in any of their fields but far more versatile."
 streamlined_line_b:0 "Continuous Production"
 streamlined_line_b_desc:0 "Our manufacturing capabilities and processes have changed significantly in the last decade, and we have seen numerous methods to increase our production output. However, with ever-growing demands, we must prepare our assembly lines to churn out the products we will need in the coming years. As always, our military needs are always tremendous, and only through continuous manufacturing will we meet that demand."
 streamlined_line_c:0 "Lean Production"
 streamlined_line_c_desc:0 "The continued pursuit of increased efficiency has crystallised it into a singular process. Accurate and expert forecasts of potential demands help diminish the wastage of material and inventory costs by procuring only what is necessary to meet those demands. Our workers may chafe at stringent conditions and added stress, but the massive reduction in production costs makes up for it."
 streamlined_line_d:0 "Industrial Robots"
 streamlined_line_d_desc:0 "The proliferation of transistor-based computers has made programmable machines far more cost-efficient, and their implementation a required course in the developing world of modern manufacturing. These machines, colloquially known as 'robots', are still somewhat limited in their functions, such as simple pressing or welding, but experts believe their roles in heavy industry will only grow."
#-<><><>
 concentrated_industry_a:0 "Industrial Towns"
 concentrated_industry_a_desc:0 "Further centralisation of manufactories requires a wholly different layout to how we plan and build complexes. Logistics and accommodations must be taken into consideration if we intend to continue expanding existing factories. With commercial and residential blocks, these mega-complexes are starting to look like entire towns, and with good reason!"
 concentrated_industry_b:0 "Singular Industrial Integration"
 concentrated_industry_b_desc:0 "Drawing from previous lessons of factory line integrations, we've learned that we can expand on this design philosophy by further integrating fundamental aspects of an industry into a single mega-complex. For example, we can incorporate all automotive, aviation, navy, and arms industries into their designated mega-factories to expand and streamline overall production."
 concentrated_industry_c:0 "Literal Vertical Integration"
 concentrated_industry_c_desc:0 "As we learn from new construction methods on building taller and more land-efficient skyscrapers, we can apply these lessons to our factories. Vertically integrated specific production lines reduce overall land use, making factory expansions more viable and overall less land-intensive. As such, our industries can grow further and increase production output."
 concentrated_industry_d:0 "Integration of Air Transports"
 concentrated_industry_d_desc:0 "The logistics chain that feeds our industry is essential, and must function regardless of circumstance. Transport planes and now helicopters are not perfect, but it has become clear that they are an excellent supplement to existing transportation methods. From moving materials to personnel, it has become evident that this particular aspect of transportation will only grow more efficient and more reliable. We should take steps to begin their integration."
 
 dispersed_industry_a:0 "Integrated Worker Towns"
 dispersed_industry_a_desc:0 "One of the most significant causes of information leakage is loose lips from workers, even when sworn to secrecy. We can keep them away from possible enemy agents by bringing them to our isolated complexes and have them live there."
 dispersed_industry_b:0 "Reinforced Facilities"
 dispersed_industry_b_desc:0 "We can add a layer of subsurface concrete for our more hidden and more critical facilities that adds further protection and stability. This permits us to expand the facilities in question significantly while keeping their overall secrecy and security from enemy attacks."
 dispersed_industry_c:0 "Distributed Self-Sufficiency"
 dispersed_industry_c_desc:0 "Our isolated facilities still need material collection and food for our worker that comes from external sources. Suppose we can make it so that the facilities themselves can provide for themselves. In that case, our transportation links will be far less vulnerable as they become supplementary rather than necessary."
 dispersed_industry_d:0 "Countrywide Dispersion"
 dispersed_industry_d_desc:0 "Every possible acre of our land is an opportune place to have some instance of industry. Even the backyards of people's homes can be turned into tiny furnaces or workshops should we encourage our citizenry to do so. We have at least ten redundant ones for every line, and the only way to destroy our industry would be by razing our entire country."
#-<><><>
 construction_a:0 "Reorganised Work Teams"
 construction_a_desc:0 "Overall, a construction worker doesn't require much training to be effective at their job. However, with new specialised equipment and machinery, it is easy for a disorganised team to flounder in its job. Regimentalisation and better group structuring of the workers will help workers focus on their duty and increase their efficiency."
 construction_b:0 "The Finite Element Method"
 construction_b_desc:0 "A widely used method for solving differential equations, the finite element method (FEM) is incredibly useful in structural analysis. It subdivides large systems into smaller, simpler parts via discretisation of the dimensions. This extremely intensive analysis provides a powerful tool for the safe design of massive steel structures with complex geometries. This is of great use in constructing safe buildings that previously would have been impossible to imagine, let alone build!"
 construction_c:0 "Prefabricated Buildings"
 construction_c_desc:0 "Sometimes permanent structures are unnecessary for what is required. Often times, inexpensive housing can be assembled on-site for quicker and cheaper construction. These structures are not as valuable nor as lasting as more permanent buildings. However, they offer a suitable alternative for domiciles and warehouses."
 construction_d:0 "Modern High-Rise Construction"
 construction_d_desc:0 "High-rise buildings, such as skyscrapers or tower blocks, have been a staple of modern urban cities for quite some time. However, current methods can be significantly advanced with the 'tube' system, which can resist lateral loads, unlike previous designs. This cutting edge engineering, combined with the new rationalist architectural style that embraces repetitive modular forms, will bring forth a new era of massive megastructures the likes that have never been seen before."

 excavation_a:0 "Stope and Fill"
 excavation_a_desc:0 "Where large bulk ore bodies are to be mined at great depth, or where leaving pillars of ore is uneconomical, the open stope is filled with backfill, usually a cement and rock mixture, a cement and sand mixture or a cement and tailings mixture. This method is efficient as the refilled stopes provide support for the adjacent stopes, allowing total extraction of economic resources."
 excavation_b:0 "Geochemical Prospecting"
 excavation_b_desc:0 "A step above traditional pickaxe and metal detecting prospecting, geochemical prospecting involves analyzing the chemical properties of rock samples, drainage sediments, soils, surface and ground waters, mineral separates, atmospheric gases and particulates, and even plants and animals. Properties such as trace element abundances are analyzed systematically to locate anomalies and, potentially, new veins and resources."
 excavation_c:0 "Long Hole Stoping"
 excavation_c_desc:0 "Long hole stoping uses holes drilled by a production drill to a predetermined pattern. It is a highly selective and productive method of mining and can cater for varying ore thicknesses and dips. Unlike manual techniques such as timbered and shrinkage, as once the stope has begun the blasting phase, long hole stopes cannot be accessed by personnel. For this reason, the blasted rock is removed remotely with a radio-controlled or enchanted vehicle."
 excavation_d:0 "Specialised LHD Machines"
 excavation_d_desc:0 "Load, haul, dump (LHD) loaders are similar to conventional front end loaders but developed explicitly for the toughest of hard rock mining applications, keeping overall production economy, safety, and reliability in consideration. They have powerful prime movers, making these massive modern loaders extremely rugged, highly manoeuvrable, and exceptionally productive."

 semi_modern_landing_craft:0 "Dock Landing Ships"
 semi_modern_landing_craft_desc:0 "Once our forces establish a beachhead, we must keep them supplied to maintain amphibious operations. Previously, we either pressed smaller watercraft or slow barges to sustain the supply chain. However, new specialised dock landing ships with integrated bow doors solve this issue can launch smaller landing craft and vehicles and transport supplies directly onto a beach."
 modern_landing_craft:0 "Early Landing Platform Helicopters Ships"
 modern_landing_craft_desc:0 "Experiments in helicopters provide a whole new possibility in enhancing our amphibious operations. With specialised landing platform helicopter (LPH) ships, we can integrate airborne assaults with the landing efforts upon a coastline. This, of course, opens up a new front from which our forces can assault the enemy shoreline, enabling wholly new operations that specially trained commandos can carry out. "

 nuke_naval:0 "Nuclear Naval Power"
 nuke_naval_desc:0 "We've theorized that our largest and most powerful ships can be given nuclear reactors. Hopefully with time we can find a way to make this a reality."
 nukes_2:0 "Thermonuclear Experiments"
 nukes_2_desc:0 "Designs have been laid out for a bomb that uses fission to produce an even more powerful fusion reaction. With this, we should be able to significantly increase our yields."
 nukes_3:0 "Miniaturized Nukes"
 nukes_3_desc:0 "Further developments in nuclear weapons design permits for extremely small, linear implosion type weapons that can fit within suitcases. Such terrifying weapons are made possible by deeper understanding in producing more effective fissile materials, that also conversely improves the yields of our other conventional nukes."

 semi_modern_rocket_engines:0 "Early ICBMs and Crystal-Rocket Engines"
 semi_modern_rocket_engines_desc:0 "Massive breakthroughs in multi-phase rocket designs and crystal-rocket engines have resulted in a genuinely awe-inspiring ballistic missile capable of unprecedented ranges. Launched high into the sky, well into the stratosphere, there is no hope of interception, and there are few places this class of missiles cannot reach."
 guided_missile_equipment_4:0 "Early Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles"
 guided_missile_equipment_4_desc:0 "Massive breakthroughs in crystal-rocket engines have resulted in a somewhat reliable interceptor. Combined with multi-phase rocket designs, we can now create truly awe-inspiring ballistic missiles. Launched high into the sky, well into the stratosphere, there is no hope of interception, and there are few places this class of missiles cannot reach."
 
 modern_rocket_engines:0 "True Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles"
 modern_rocket_engines_short:0 "True ICBMs"

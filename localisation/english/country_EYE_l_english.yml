##Initial Tree##

EYE_pack_your_bags:0 "Pack Your Bags"
EYE_pack_your_bags_desc:0 ""EMERGENCY ADVISORY TO ALL PACT PERSONNEL: The situation is untenable. Evacuate the island immediately. Should the Mandate be dissolved, YOU WILL BE ON YOUR OWN.""

EYE_fight_for_your_futures_desc:0 "TODO"
EYE_kill_for_your_past:0 "Kill For Your Past"
EYE_kill_for_your_past_desc:0 "The records show that the height of yeti nature is the will to power, to discharge that power upon others. Kravash Thundercrusher and his hyper-reactionary clique echo these bygone sentiments, though perhaps not as eloquently."
EYE_all_thats_been_stolen:0 "All That's Been Stolen"
EYE_all_thats_been_stolen_desc:0 "Our land, our rights, our identity: no matter which way you cut it, the Pact has stripped us of these core traits, without which we may as well be aimless drifters in the seven seas. We must reclaim them."
EYE_all_weve_been_given:0 "All We've Been Given"
EYE_all_weve_been_given_desc:0 "TODO"
EYE_all_well_take_back:0 "All We'll Take Back"
EYE_all_well_take_back_desc:0 "The foreigners' "kind hearts" are a thin veneer to mask their thirst to pillage and vanquish; their promises of liberty, a meagre excuse to hack away at the very idea of yetidom. This humiliation will not stand."
EYE_new_friends:0 "New Friends"
EYE_new_friends_desc:0 "TODO"
EYE_new_masters:0 "New Masters"
EYE_new_masters_desc:0 "How the mighty have fallen! Are we truly sons of the Storm King if we were so easily cowed by a pack of dogs and devils? Let them know, let the whole world know: this "Mandate" is under new management."

EYE_take_back_the_streets_desc:0 "TODO"
EYE_dont_let_them_escape:0 "Don't Let Them Escape"
EYE_dont_let_them_escape_desc:0 "The monsters turn tail, and the slave-minded seek to flee with them! We'll fight them if they get away, so rev up the trucks and put the cages in the back: time to restart our ancient tradition of slavery!"
EYE_chase_away_what_remains:0 "Chase Away What Remains"
EYE_chase_away_what_remains_desc:0 "TODO"
EYE_shoot_to_kill:0 "Shoot To Kill"
EYE_shoot_to_kill_desc:0 "Apparently, we don't have enough cages and we don't have enough shelters to store as many indentured servants we need. Shoot the rest, both the Pact and the "yetis" too scared to stand on the right side of history."
EYE_to_right_what_is_wrong:0 "To Right What Is Wrong"
EYE_to_right_what_is_wrong_desc:0 "TODO"

##Curadka's Tree##

EYE_the_call_of_tomorrow:0 "The Call Of Tomorrow"

EYE_back_from_the_brink:0 "Back From The Brink"
EYE_back_from_the_brink_desc:0 "Our economy is in tatters. To make up for all the damage that's been done, new workshops and factories will be propped up wherever possible to breathe some life into our society."

EYE_master_the_basics:0 "Master The Basics"
EYE_master_the_basics_desc:0 "We cannot jump the gun and rush for advanced technologies before first perfecting what's already been made. Simple studies on contemporary techniques are what is required right now; the futurism can come later."
EYE_construct_a_stable_present:0 "Construct A Stable Present"
EYE_construct_a_stable_present_desc:0 "Can we claim to strive for a perfect future if we abandon the present? Of course not. Tomorrow cannot come without today, and so today shall be made as worthwhile as possible."
EYE_our_greatest_minds:0 "Our Greatest Minds"
EYE_our_greatest_minds_desc:0 "Many of the Eye's most brilliant yetis have been abandoned by the Mandate and the devastation its corpse left behind. Let us find these lumps of coal, that they might be turned into diamonds."
EYE_faded_scars:0 "Faded Scars"
EYE_faded_scars_desc:0 "After so long in a slump, things seem to finally be looking up. Unemployment is at an all-time low and poverty is at a minimum. Let's keep this upward trend going for a long, long time."
EYE_stormlands_quality_assured:0 "Chidhoruban Quality Assured"
EYE_stormlands_quality_assured_desc:0 "What shall the creatures of Chidhoru be known for? For their loyalty, their devotion, their beauty? No, they'll be known for making the best damn luxury goods you've ever had the pleasure of laying eyes on, that's what!"
EYE_an_economy_for_the_ages:0 "An Economy For The Ages"
EYE_an_economy_for_the_ages_desc:0 "Genius that he is, Curadka has thought of a way for collectivism to be perfected without disrupting all that's been built. A two-layer economy, with small private businesses allowed and large state-owned properties existing alongside each other."
EYE_cultivation_of_the_mind:0 "Cultivation Of The Mind"
EYE_cultivation_of_the_mind_desc:0 "Cheap words and fiery speeches are not enough to unchain the minds of the citizens. While few may care for philosophy and other less-than-tangible aspects of higher learning, some watered down versions of these topics can help the average yeti think about the world on a deeper level."
EYE_return_to_the_mainland:0 "Return To The Mainland"
EYE_return_to_the_mainland_desc:0 "The rule of bandits and petty warlordism must come to an end. Curadka has rid the Eye of their kind, and now he will do the same to the mainland. Our time of exile is over!"
EYE_enrichment_of_the_soul:0 "Enrichment Of The Soul"
EYE_enrichment_of_the_soul_desc:0 "There can be no point to liberation if the citizens of the new regime are not fulfilled. Aid from the state will help to revitalize entertainment and recreation, giving people tangible evidence of the benevolence and wisdom of their new ruler."
EYE_stormlander_futurism:0 "Stormlander Futurism"
EYE_stormlander_futurism_desc:0 "The Stormland isle is experiencing an explosion of culture and science never before seen. An artistic style merging aspirations of the future with abstract imagery has emerged, bringing everything it touches to life."
EYE_meet_with_the_family:0 "Meet With The Family"
EYE_meet_with_the_family_desc:0 "The most important part of Curadka's vision for the future lies with reintegration of the zebras of the land. The first step begins here, with the Uzerasi. If he can convince them to peacefully join us it could be the key to success."
EYE_teach_them_the_way:0 "Teach Them The Way"
EYE_teach_them_the_way_desc:0 "The disease has been removed, but its stain still lingers. Pillaged towns, emptied vaults, and refugees still mark the land. We must show the yetis of the Windborn region that life is better with us than without."
EYE_faults_of_the_past:0 "Faults Of The Past"
EYE_faults_of_the_past_desc:0 "To look upon the past is to see failure. All previous leaders of the Rainband failed in nearly every aspect, even in war. Their failures have led to the current situation of chaos and disunity. Curadka will be different - he has to be."
EYE_architectural_renewal:0 "Architectural Renewal"
EYE_architectural_renewal_desc:0 "The unique style now iconic of the Stormland isle should be brought to the rest of the rainband. Embedding new buildings and public places with elements from this style will tell everyone that the future is here!"
EYE_from_on_high:0 "From On High"
EYE_from_on_high_desc:0 "The oligarchs and chiefdoms of these new microstates can never stand up to the might of a greater power. It's only a matter of time until someone comes for them - it may as well be us. We're sure to be better to them than anyone else would be, anyways."
EYE_consent_of_the_governed:0 "Consent Of The Governed"
EYE_consent_of_the_governed_desc:0 "Curadka is no autocrat, despite the power he wields. By opening the door to those failed by past regimes the state will solidify and bring security from within. It will also allow Curadka to begin his grand project in earnest..."
EYE_negotiate_for_the_buffer:0 "''Negotiate'' For The Valley"
EYE_negotiate_for_the_buffer_desc:0 "Despite our leader's respect for the dervishes of Hyenia, the sword must come down on the monarchs they've sold themselves to. They will come to regret their hubris, and the people of Stormcloud will be reunited with their brethren once again."
EYE_mechanized_to_perfection:0 "Mechanized To Perfection"
EYE_mechanized_to_perfection_desc:0 "For the sake of our future, food scarcity must be permanently eliminated. With broad implementation of cutting-edge technology, our farms will yield quantities unthinkable just a decade ago. Hunger will become a thing of the past!"
EYE_enlightened_collectivism:0 "Enlightened Collectivism"
EYE_enlightened_collectivism_desc:0 "The working yetis and zebras must not be forgotten on our march to the future, for they are the lifeblood of civilization. They should take in the wealth they create, as the oligarchs and kings of the past once did, as the primary beneficiaries of the nation."
EYE_hoof_to_hand:0 "Hoof To Hand"
EYE_hoof_to_hand_desc:0 "To hate another's race is to be stuck in the past. The distrust between zebras and yetis ends here and now. We are friends, neighbours, and family. No more shall there be a divide between us!"
EYE_new_state_apparatus:0 "New State Apparatus"
EYE_new_state_apparatus_desc:0 "Over three million creatures live in the Stormcloud Valley, and they have been treated like pawns to be taken advantage of without any concern. We will make sure they are cared for, not left to the wolves like those before."
EYE_culture_shock:0 "Culture Shock"
EYE_culture_shock_desc:0 "We cannot exist as a unified society while many still think of anyone outside of their immediate circle as ‘’the other.’’ There will be coexistence and mutual understanding amongst our citizens, whether they want it or not."
EYE_two_becomes_one:0 "Two Becomes One"
EYE_two_becomes_one_desc:0 "It's time for the next step. To not just erase distrust but the very lines between races has never been done before, but how could it if it's never been tried? From now on, we will never again be anything other than two halves of one whole."
EYE_nationalist_ideals:0 "Nationalist Ideals"
EYE_nationalist_ideals_desc:0 "The concept of Chidhoru is amorphous and vague to anyone outside of Curadka's direct circle. It's time to change that. Chidhoru is a nation, a state, a place, and a people, not just an idea."
EYE_secure_the_future:0 "Secure The Future"
EYE_secure_the_future_desc:0 "With all other threats taken care of, our gaze falls to the north. The zebras of the lakes have been taken for a ride by a number of tyrants and false liberators. It's time to set the record straight and secure the future - *our* future."
EYE_from_the_ground_up:0 "From The Ground Up"
EYE_from_the_ground_up_desc:0 "For all his many strengths, the one thing Curadka knows nothing of is war. But he shall learn, and his knowledge will not be tainted by errors of the past, no - his expertise shall be built from the ground up. He might need some help to get there, though."
EYE_what_they_got_right:0 "What They Got Right"
EYE_what_they_got_right_desc:0 "Despite the many faults of the Storm King and his wannabe successors, the one thing they nailed was technological superiority. The grit and perseverance of a foe just cannot best a hulking metal vehicle with a cannon."
EYE_all_for_his_vision:0 "All For His Vision"
EYE_all_for_his_vision_desc:0 "TODO"
EYE_sciences_of_the_future:0 "Sciences Of The Future"

EYE_proclaim_the_greater_union_desc:0 "Victory! At long last, our greatest trial is over, and the final phase of Curadka's vision can now be enacted."
EYE_the_broken_dream:0 "The Broken Dream"
EYE_the_broken_dream_desc:0 "The great nation of Ugabi is no more, but it's people remain. Directionless and without purpose, we can take them by the hoof and show them all the path forward."
EYE_fly_the_banner:0 "Fly The Banner"
EYE_fly_the_banner_desc:0 "While Chidhoru does encompass the southernmost parts of the Great Lakes, we do not seek to subjugate the remainder of the region. Let us work with them rather than against them."
EYE_brothers_and_sisters:0 "Brothers And Sisters"
EYE_brothers_and_sisters_desc:0 "The Hayzeb are no strangers to us. We have already welcomed millions of Hayzeb zebras into Chidhoru, and the rest will follow - even if they have to be persuaded a bit harsher than their southern family."
EYE_in_with_the_old:0 "In With The Old"
EYE_in_with_the_old_desc:0 "An uncivilized yeti would insist that the powerful zebras of the past should be thrown in jail or even executed, but Curadka is anything but. He knows how to get the rich and powerful to think like him, and he can do it again."
EYE_show_of_unity:0 "Show Of Unity"
EYE_show_of_unity_desc:0 "How can we show our new Chidhoruban citizens that we only want what's best for them? Parades, letters to influential leaders, perhaps a tax break or two? Why not try it all?"
EYE_center_of_governance:0 "Center Of Society"
EYE_center_of_governance_desc:0 "Now that our internal borders are as safe as they've ever been, we can finally think of relocating the capital. The Eye is a relic, not fit for the center of Chidhoruban society. Let's shift focus away from it for good."
EYE_no_master_but_one:0 "No Master But One"
EYE_no_master_but_one_desc:0 "There are many Hayzeb zebras that seem to be under the impression that Curadka is just like all the rest: an autocrat who respects no other power. Let's show them how wrong they are!"
EYE_chiefs_to_mayors:0 "Chiefs To Mayors"
EYE_chiefs_to_mayors_desc:0 "There's no reason to remove all the talented creatures already leading small villages and towns, but the position they hold has to be kept up with modern standards. Some renovations are certainly in order!"
EYE_chat_with_the_guerillas:0 "Chat With The Guerillas"
EYE_chat_with_the_guerillas_desc:0 "Some Mozzi rabble have taken up arms and refuse to integrate into Chidhoruban society. This doesn't mean they're enemies, necessarily. Let's see what they have to say before making our move."
EYE_protect_our_interests:0 "Protect Our Interests"
EYE_protect_our_interests_desc:0 "Despite our many victories, there are still things our great nation lacks. Security, for one. The horses to the west reek of the past - let's put their names in the history books where they belong."
EYE_cut_away_the_vestiges:0 "Cut Away The Vestiges"
EYE_cut_away_the_vestiges_desc:0 "The blight upon our army some call ''Gel Frostwind'' has been left to his own devices for too long. He was needed when our Great Leader needed any ally he could get, but he has served his purpose. It's time to take out the trash."
EYE_break_the_chains_of_modernity:0 "Break The Chains Of Modernity"
EYE_break_the_chains_of_modernity_desc:0 "For years, the Hayzeb languished under slavery before bravely liberating themselves under the leadership of The Chainbreaker. Now, there is another chain to break... the chain of modernity."

EYE_we_have_but_one_life_desc:0 "All this struggle, all this pain... is it worth it? To bite the hand that feeds you, over and over again? Let us show you that it's not worth wasting your time over. You only have one life, don't waste it fighting for a dead nation."
EYE_doorway_into_arabia:0 "Doorway Into Saddle Arabia"
EYE_doorway_into_arabia_desc:0 "Now that our most precarious border is secured, we can establish our own government there that is more amenable to Chidhoruban interests. Oh, and let's not forget to keep a piece for ourselves."
EYE_our_last_enemy:0 "Our Last Enemy"
EYE_our_last_enemy_desc:0 "None quite embody the ways of old like the Hestrayans. Savage tribes of horse warriors and crumbling dynasties of ponies are all that populate the peninsula. Let us bring them into the future, for their sake more than ours."
EYE_hestrayan_renovation:0 "Hestrayan Renovation"
EYE_hestrayan_renovation_desc:0 "Perhaps the best lesson we can teach the Hestrayans is that racial unity is not just possible, it's preferable. For the first time, they will be united under one banner. They can thank us later."
EYE_freedom_worth_living_for:0 "Freedom Worth Living For"
EYE_freedom_worth_living_for_desc:0 "Freedom! The poor sods think they ever truly had it. Sometimes adequate teaching requires repetition. Let us show that the life they live under our great leader is the best they have ever had, and the best they ever will have."
EYE_arms_of_authority:0 "Arms Of Authority"
EYE_arms_of_authority_desc:0 "Now that construction of the nation is coming to a close, our great leader has deemed it necessary to codify into law what his relationship with the armed forces will be, now and forever."
EYE_rites_of_succession:0 "Rites Of Succession"
EYE_rites_of_succession_desc:0 "The method of succession for the nation of Chidhoru has been left on the table while other matters took stage. Now, it is time to solve this riddle once and for all. The last mistake of the Storm King's memory will finally be rectified."
EYE_a_legacy_to_be_proud_of:0 "A Legacy To Be Proud Of"
EYE_a_legacy_to_be_proud_of_desc:0 "Chidhoru stands tall. Curadka has overcome all obstacles that came his way, and now the results of his labor have come to fruition. A nation, a people, a unified identity. A legacy that will stand the test of time."

##Kravash's Tree##

EYE_the_age_of_yetikind:0 "The Age Of Yetikind"
EYE_the_age_of_yetikind_desc:0 "The Age of Yeti-Kind is upon us, the age when we show the world that only the strongest of races will rule it! The Storm King revealed our might to the world, and Kravash will demonstrate that we can do it again - raise the banners, ready the airships, for our era has come!"
EYE_the_best_we_ever_had:0 "The Best We Ever Had"
EYE_the_best_we_ever_had_desc:0 "Do you know how big the Storm King’s empire was before his defeat? The biggest in the world, in all of history! In a few years we yetis had gone from fighting ourselves to the whole continent! Imagine how powerful we could be if we kept expanding for a decade? What about three decades? A century? Forever?"
EYE_just_make_more_stuff:0 "Just Make More Stuff"
EYE_just_make_more_stuff_desc:0 "Kravash is sick of all these reports - ‘reliability concerns,’ ‘lack of resources,’ ‘hazardous working conditions’. What nonsense. All that matters is that our soldiers have a weapon. If their gun jams, or breaks, or runs out of bullets, so what? Any true yeti will hold it at the other end and use it as a club."
EYE_being_dumb_is_smart:0 "Being Dumb Is Smart"
EYE_being_dumb_is_smart_desc:0 "The difference between a yeti and some wisezebra? The yeti is much stronger, of course! Why should we care so much about being intelligent if it can’t help us crush our enemies? "Ah," heckles the naysayer, "smart people make things like weapons, and they can be used in a fight," but we'll just beat them up then steal their inventions!"
EYE_anyone_can_be_a_soldier_as_long_as_youre_a_yeti:0 "Anyone Can Be A Soldier (As Long As They're A Yeti)"
EYE_anyone_can_be_a_soldier_as_long_as_youre_a_yeti_desc:0 "Ultimately, the one thing a soldier needs to have is strength. And which race is the strongest? It’s no wonder the Storm King won every battle he fought (Ain Trotgourait doesn’t count, they cheated with magic), because yetis are simply the strongest soldiers in the world."
EYE_marvel_at_his_majesty:0 "Marvel At His Majesty"
EYE_marvel_at_his_majesty_desc:0 "The Storm King's Empire had coasts on three oceans. It was larger than both Equus and Griffonia. The King revolutionised airship warfare, and won more battles than anyone in history! Can such a majestic figure's power be put into words?"
EYE_wonder_at_his_wondrosity:0 "Wonder At His Wondrosity"
EYE_wonder_at_his_wondrosity_desc:0 "Let's put it into words! In fact, more than that. I want ten marching songs singing about his military might by tomorrow. Get the little yetis still in school to swear an oath to try to be as strong as him. Build a statue of the Storm King in every town with a population of over one thousand. If he doesn't deserve it, who does?"
EYE_our_best_friends:0 "Our Best Friends"
EYE_our_best_friends_desc:0 "The Storm King might've been the most powerful creature who's ever lived, but he didn't do it alone! He had friends—er, ALLIES! Not everyone's survived, but we can raise a new breed of doers!"
EYE_learn_how_to_kill_good:0 "Learn How To Kill Good"
EYE_learn_how_to_kill_good_desc:0 "To be nice to the eggheads for once, some of this military technology is damn impressive. For instance, these new cannons can kill enemies on the other side of a hill - we definitely need a few of those. Some of the generals probably don't want to change the doctrine of 'going straight at them,' but sometimes winning requires these sacrifices."
EYE_beat_up_all_the_bad_people:0 "Beat Up All The Bad People"
EYE_beat_up_all_the_bad_people_desc:0 "You'd be surprised how easily problems can be solved with violence. Rebels? Just wallop 'em. Draft dodgers? Just wallop 'em. Pact sympathisers? Just wallop 'em. A lot of big thinkers from the other side of the world spend so much time justifying violence, saying how violence is bad unless it’s somehow good. But here? Here we just beat up the bad people. Simple!"
EYE_recreate_his_genius:0 "Recreate His Genius"
EYE_recreate_his_genius_desc:0 "It’s hard to explain why the Storm King was so brilliant, and it’s even harder to replicate it. But Kravash is a great yeti too, and he's learning fast! The strategic genius, the understanding of the great yeti spirit; all these things are present in Kravash - how lucky are we to have two great yetis in such a short time?"
EYE_no_hooves_only_hands:0 "No Hooves, Only Hands"
EYE_no_hooves_only_hands_desc:0 "Zebras have stubby things called "hooves!" How do they hold guns? Actually, no, just get that hands-only policy going! Ban hooves! They should've been born with these hands if they're thinking about holding anything!"
EYE_beat_your_way_to_the_top:0 "Beat Your Way To The Top"
EYE_beat_your_way_to_the_top_desc:0 "Want to get rewards? Want to prove yourself! Do it on the BATTLEFIELD! Actually, no. Do it ANY OTHER PLACE, because if you die on the battlefield, you know corpses can't get strong!"
EYE_good_old_fashioned_pillaging:0 "Good Old Fashioned Pillaging"
EYE_good_old_fashioned_pillaging_desc:0 "The problems with the Storm King's love of sacking wasn't the sacking itself, it was the fact that he didn't really need the wealth and it wasted time. We're absolutely going to start pillaging the pushovers again, but this time we'll hand the loot over to the warriors who need it – we're real generous like that."
EYE_hit_the_books_really_really_hard:0 "Hit The Books Really, Really Hard"
EYE_hit_the_books_really_really_hard_desc:0 "Did you know that the brain is a muscle, too? Too soft to stop a bullet, but research shows that bigger brains means better ideas! Nerds get mandatory schooling! Memorize and innovate for us! The gun smacked in your face will be great motivation!"
EYE_show_off_your_huge_muscles:0 "Show Off Your Huge Muscles"
EYE_show_off_your_huge_muscles_desc:0 "Are you yeti enough? What, do you think we'll let wimps kill themselves when they see how scrawny little zebras crawling on all fours can also get buff? Stop whining and get to the government-mandated gym! MUSCLES guarantee SERVICE guarantee CITIZENSHIP!"
EYE_our_worst_enemies:0 "Our Worst Enemies"
EYE_our_worst_enemies_desc:0 "The enemies have captured our innocent brothers and sisters on the continent! But their liberation is at hand—the weaklings will understand that, in this world, the strong are never defeated! The strong only bide and wait until the time to strike."
EYE_every_yeti_for_themselves:0 "Every Yeti For Themselves"
EYE_every_yeti_for_themselves_desc:0 "We follow the Storm King because he's our role model! Since he was a king, that means we should all be our own kings, independent and needing no one else! We don't accept that "gimmie-more" slave mentality here!"
EYE_make_everyone_else_do_the_work:0 "Make Everyone Else Do The Work"
EYE_make_everyone_else_do_the_work_desc:0 "Are we brutes, willing to stoop to the level of mindlessly putting things on conveyor belts in factories? Let other creatures handle this! See their muscles deflate while we take care of what really matters in life!"
EYE_let_the_lesser_races_think_for_you:0 "Let The Lesser Races Think For You"
EYE_let_the_lesser_races_think_for_you_desc:0 "Too many yetis at the gym, not enough for the science places, but not our problem! Captured slaves can read and write and invent! Zebras and horses, look at these microscopes and tell us what you see!"
EYE_be_proud_of_your_pride:0 "Be Proud Of Your Pride"
EYE_be_proud_of_your_pride_desc:0 "We politely kidnapped some old Storm King veterans! Just because they're years older than us doesn't mean they're out of the fight! They might have even talked with the mighty Storm King so they can pass his wisdom down to us!"
EYE_just_like_the_good_old_days:0 "Just Like The Good Old Days"
EYE_just_like_the_good_old_days_desc:0 "The sun is shining, the birds are singing, the villages are burning, and the ashes smell good! Creatures scream for their lives—so beautiful! All while we scoop up their belongings! This is the glory they've taken from you, fellow yetis, but you can take it back!"
EYE_convince_them_to_love_it:0 "Convince Them To Love It"
EYE_convince_them_to_love_it_desc:0 "Our future slaves might be afraid of a terrible life, but for them, it's not so bad. We're the ones doing the fighting, the ruling, yada-yada. Harsh living isn't meant for them—they'll be secure under a strong master, and if it gets boring... maybe some bloodsports would shake things up."
EYE_never_doubt_again:0 "Never Doubt Again"
EYE_never_doubt_again_desc:0 "Silence the haters! The world thought we were dead when our first king fell, but that was nothing! What doesn't kill us makes us stronger, and the whole civil war and being occupied thing... so, now we're here, and here to stay!"
EYE_to_those_bereft_of_faith:0 "To Those Bereft Of Faith"
EYE_to_those_bereft_of_faith_desc:0 "Guess who's back! The Storm King! With a fresh new face, he's stronger than ever, and he's got a spring in his step, and the storm clouds are only beginning to roll! Watch out, everyone... this case of "bad weather" has only just begun! YETIS ARE GREAT AGAIN!"
EYE_live_like_youre_already_dead:0 "Live Like You're Already Dead"
EYE_live_like_youre_already_dead_desc:0 "In fights, creatures die. In war, they die all around you. The wimps will whine about how it's disgusting, but we yetis are born to die! We're smarter than everyone because we know it's part of living! So, go, enjoy the treasures you've stolen! Kravash's not gonna stop you!"

EYE_banging_rocks_together:0 "Banging Rocks Together"
EYE_banging_rocks_together_desc:0 "It shouldn’t need to be said, but Yetis aren't stupid. That aside, a lot of science is stupid. Why should we care about stuff like crop research and theoretical physics? Going forward, research will be focussed exclusively on military R&D... and maybe a bit of industry and electronic stuff."
EYE_modern_methods_of_conquest:0 "Modern Methods Of Conquest"
EYE_modern_methods_of_conquest_desc:0 "Walking hundreds of miles on foot doesn't really fit our doctrine of rapid attacks — that and it's really boring, so let's get some yetis working on some heavy trucks. As for tanks, a mobile blasting platform's damn useful, but let's rotate who gets to sit in them so they don’t get complacent under all that armour."
EYE_dedicated_chemical_weapons_squads:0 "Dedicated Chemical Weapons Facilities"
EYE_dedicated_chemical_weapons_squads_desc:0 "Everyone likes a fair fight. Well, every yeti likes a fair fight, but unfortunately a lot of the punier races don’t fight fair, so when they fight dirty, we can fight dirtier. Hopefully, a bit of mustard gas should teach 'em to conduct themselves more honourably."
EYE_mild_pragmatism:0 "Mild Pragmatism"
EYE_mild_pragmatism_desc:0 "We're conquerors, not murderers. Why should we kill a bunch of zebras that aren't fighting back? There’s no challenge or honour in it, and frankly, it's not strategic. We'll keep spooking the locals, remind them who's in charge, but let's keep the pummelling to the actual resistance."
EYE_the_place_of_the_weak:0 "The Place Of The Weak"
EYE_the_place_of_the_weak_desc:0 "The weak suffer, we endure. Whenever anyone is born, at any time, in any place, to whatever race, they are faced with a choice: be strong, or be weak. The Yeti Dominion is the consequence of taking the lazy way out. We won't kill them, but they will know who their masters are."
EYE_the_best_of_the_worst:0 "Best Of The Worst"
EYE_the_best_of_the_worst_desc:0 "Overall, hyenas are a pretty puny race. How quickly did they capitulate after the invasion again? But putting the past aside, they can pull their finger out when they really want to. And some of them are almost – ALMOST – as strong as a yeti. Let's hand some of the power to a few of the tougher-looking collaborators. They've proved their potential, and it's not like they actually pose a threat anymore."
EYE_racial_stratification:0 "Impartial Stratification"
EYE_racial_stratification_desc:0 "We aren't going to badmouth anyone who wants to fight for us – the more the merrier. That being said, the other races are weaker. That's just reality. Going forward, all races will have their own units that will supplement the tough yeti core. Maybe get zebras on recon, hyenas on artillery, that kind of thing."
EYE_introduction_of_the_psuedoyetis:0 "Introduction Of The Psuedo-yetis"
EYE_introduction_of_the_psuedoyetis_desc:0 "If you look at them from far enough away, and the centaur is standing straight-on and the gargoyle has their wings folded in, you could probably mistake them for us. Yetis are stronger, obviously, but they're similar enough that we can consider them cousins and try and get them into the family."

EYE_everything_is_burning:0 "Unintended Consequences"
EYE_everything_is_burning_desc:0 "Everything is burning. Kravash followed his idol to the very end: an early death and an abandoned empire. There can be no next grand campaign, at least not while turmoil snaps at us from all sides."
EYE_reality_check:0 "Reality Check"
EYE_reality_check_desc:0 "The strong do have advantages over the weak, but Kravash failed to see strength as more than a muscle-measuring contest. The Storm King himself rose to power with the help of intelligence, innovation, and cunning—skills we'll get back to rewarding yetis for."
EYE_clean_up_his_damn_mess:0 "Clean Up His Damn Mess"
EYE_clean_up_his_damn_mess_desc:0 "Kravash was too stupid to slow down and consolidate. Fighting is indeed glorious; the policing and peacekeeping of angry subjects, not so much. We're not about to let go of our precious chunk of Zebrica, though, even if it means sending the army to sternly tell all non-yetis to shut up or else."
EYE_put_the_brutes_in_their_places:0 "Put The Brutes In Their Place"
EYE_put_the_brutes_in_their_places_desc:0 "Even when we were led by a complete idiot, we yetis somehow took control of a great part of Zebrica again, yet the zebras never do learn, stirring unrest once more—the Mozzi head among them. We'll make their latest attempt at insurrection a short and painful teaching moment."
EYE_reward_the_subservient:0 "Reward The Subservient"
EYE_reward_the_subservient_desc:0 "For an empire to be stable, it must appeal to as many creatures as possible. While the captive population we have aren't happy about their lot, they don't need to survive in barely liveable conditions. The mere promise of moving up the ladder will be enough to ward off thoughts of uprising."
EYE_sabotage_camel_resistance:0 "Sabotage Camel Resistance Efforts"
EYE_sabotage_camel_resistance_desc:0 "From the woodwork, all sorts of creatures watch the chaos for an opportunity to rid themselves of our yoke. While the camels lay in the far reaches of the Storm King's old empire, that doesn't give them the freedom to run from us a second time."
EYE_reinforce_ovingoland:0 "Reinforce Ovingoland"
EYE_reinforce_ovingoland_desc:0 "There is only so much fleeing one can endure before their will to rebel is snuffed out, warped into a servile husk of their former selves. The Ovingolanders had their years of freedom. No more—and never again."
EYE_cogs_in_a_machine:0 "Cogs In A Machine"
EYE_cogs_in_a_machine_desc:0 "Mindless hacking and slashing will be a thing in the past. Our officers will be free once again to put in more thought to our plans than "loot and pillage," and for that to happen, rigid discipline must return to our rank and file."
EYE_codify_the_katabatian_ideal:0 "Codify The Katabatian Ideal"
EYE_codify_the_katabatian_ideal_desc:0 "If there's one advantage that Kravash’s insane leadership provided, it's how easy it is to recontextualise everything he's done. As long as the final product helps us in the Eye, the Katabatian ideal is anything we want it to be..."
EYE_declare_the_rule_of_elites:0 "Declare The Rule Of Elites"
EYE_declare_the_rule_of_elites_desc:0 "Autocracy clearly isn’t working. We've tried it twice and it's failed miserably when it comes to actually holding territory. To prevent another catastrophe, a council of warlords, industrialists and every other yeti inclined to coup us will help with our reign."
EYE_create_a_new_history:0 "Create A New History"
EYE_create_a_new_history_desc:0 "To justify the blood we've shed, brute force alone won't be enough. Kravash's excuse of a country couldn't withstand the test of time, so he must give way to a stabler foundation that is yet eager to overturn all that the old world knew. How else could we consolidate an empire of corpses?"

EYE_denounce_the_barbarian:0 "Denounce The Barbarian"
EYE_denounce_the_barbarian_desc:0 "Had Kravash lived, we would've been living in an idiocracy by now, but even in death, he's doomed us all. The revolters certainly agree, so this provisional government will lambaste him as we try to "fix" this mighty mess we find ourselves in...."
EYE_digestable_insanity:0 "Digestible Insanity"
EYE_digestable_insanity_desc:0 "Like it or not, Katabatia was founded on an ethos of all brawn and no brain, which is terrible for national cohesion. However, we can spin this off as incomplete ideas spoken by an imperfect creature. Maybe what is best in life is to be like Kravash's best self: actualizing our potential in exciting ways!"
EYE_a_page_out_of_hailstorms_book:0 "A Page Out Of Hailstorm's Book"
EYE_a_page_out_of_hailstorms_book_desc:0 "If there's a perfect role model for turning anarchy into industry, it's Ikvus Hailstorm who, in those early post-Storm King days, built corporations on the ruins of a fallen empire. Whatever his successes were, we certainly need them now to reignite our blasted economy."
EYE_tradition_off_the_assembly_line:0 "Tradition Off The Assembly Line" #Comma

EYE_it_really_is_that_easy_desc:0 "TODO"
EYE_deify_thundercrusher:0 "Deify Thundercrusher"
EYE_deify_thundercrusher_desc:0 "How did he do that voice? Ahem. "Oh great yetis! Children of the Storm! Thundercrusher may be gone, but our work for the great leader continues!" Nope, still too flowery..."
EYE_measured_sacrifices:0 "Measured Sacrifices"
EYE_measured_sacrifices_desc:0 "It's understandable that not many modern states perform sacrifices on sentient beings anymore, but you'd be surprised just how many birds it kills with one stone. Useless citizens? Dead. Traitors on death row? Their executions just got a lot more exciting. Rebellious subjects? No better way to spook them. Gullible populace? What a way to increase fanaticism!"
EYE_enshrine_the_warrior_cult:0 "Enshrine The Warrior Cult"
EYE_enshrine_the_warrior_cult_desc:0 "Usually, nations realise that continuously attacking while ignoring casualties is a rather stupid way to prosecute a war. However, after all those years under Kravash, we've gotten surprisingly good at these "tactics" – all that's needed is a nudge towards the worship of aggression and we'll have the greatest offensive army in the world."
EYE_the_eternal_yeti_messiah:0 "The Eternal Yeti Messiah"
EYE_the_eternal_yeti_messiah_desc:0 ""As yetis continue to charge into the sacred bloodshed and glory of war, who must lead us? Gel is her name, and Gel is the only yeti capable of shepherding the children of Kravash into greater glories. Only She has the mind, brawn and soul to hold our highest office and raise our greatest banners.""
EYE_unlimited_power:0 "Unlimited Power"
EYE_unlimited_power_desc:0 "Some of our more exotic technology isn’t about helping us win, it's more about preventing a loss and saving our warriors from embarrassment. The nuke is the ultimate iteration of these trump card technologies – Kravash's meat-headed principles would've hated such things, but frankly, that's an endorsement."
EYE_their_souls_yet_live:0 "Their Souls Yet Live"
EYE_their_souls_yet_live_desc:0 ""Do not grieve for your fallen brothers and sisters! They died as warriors, there is no better path! If you can fight, fight! If you cannot fight, work! When the storm howls, their voices roar in the name of your glory!""

EYE_something_out_of_nothing:0 "Something Out Of Nothing"
EYE_something_out_of_nothing_desc:0 "The Eye is great, and with all the looting we've done it's looking as good as the days of the Storm King. However centralisation has its limits, especially with a dominion as big as ours. Now we certainly aren't about to contract, but devolving power to regional despots should help keep the peace. Well, not peace, but at least stability."
EYE_pick_up_the_slack:0 "Pick Up The Slack"
EYE_pick_up_the_slack_desc:0 "Truth be told, there's nothing wrong with expansionism. Kravash's problem was that it was horrendously rushed and, on the whole, terribly organised. Let's neaten up the borders a little, and then we can finish what he started. If Kravash could do it, how hard can conquering a continent really be?"
EYE_commit_to_the_bit:0 "Commit To The Bit"
EYE_commit_to_the_bit_desc:0 "Once upon a time, the Karkadannistanis served us as a useful tool to keep Hestraya at bay while the Storm King happily journeyed north. Now, we're once again asking for their support to be a stopgap against the far western ponies as we try to put the pieces back together."
EYE_independence_is_a_fantasy:0 "Independence Is A Fantasy"
EYE_independence_is_a_fantasy_desc:0 "It's not the zebras' fault that they built their kingdoms within a stone's throw of the Eye, but the consequences are what they are. As long as the mighty yetis have their empire, the zebras must become their subjects. It's up to them how good or bad their servitude is, but independence is not on the table."
EYE_back_to_the_time_before_time:0 "Back To A Time Before Time"
EYE_back_to_the_time_before_time_desc:0 "According to Kravash, Katabatia is the modern fruit of primeval seeds, being the realisation of a mythical warrior-realm millennia in the making – a sacred empire of bloodshed and might made manifest in material reality. A childish fantasy to be sure... but not useless as an idea..."
EYE_blessings_of_the_cosmos:0 "Blessings Of The Cosmos"
EYE_blessings_of_the_cosmos_desc:0 "Weather control isn't actually that hard for modern yeti states, and it’s damn useful for optimising flight conditions, but not everyone knows how easy it is, which is something we can use to our advantage. "Nay, this is not the work of a few meteorologists, this is proof the yetis’ divinity! The great tempests roil in our blood!""
EYE_strip_them_for_all_they_are_worth:0 "Strip Them For All They Are Worth"
EYE_strip_them_for_all_they_are_worth_desc:0 "Let's be clear: the autonomous fiefs are still entirely Katabatian – that autonomy is solely due to the ease it provides to the administration. But everything of worth in those territories is ours: their resources, their industry, their riches. It's time to make sure everyone's pulling their weight."
EYE_at_long_last:0 "At Long Last"
EYE_at_long_last_desc:0 "It seems that this house of cards has finally become stable. And yes, the credit goes to us, this has all happened in spite of Kravash’s legacy, not because of it. We could say it's a thankless job... but we're not in this to be thanked. Let's have a toast to the Katabatian golden age: may it last slightly longer than our lifetimes!"
EYE_hell_frozen_over:0 "Hell Frozen Over"
EYE_hell_frozen_over_desc:0 "Kravash may have wept, for there were no more worlds to conquer.\nBut Kravash is gone. \nWe remain.\nAnd we smile..."

mandate_anarchy.1.t:0 "Forget About Free Mandates"
mandate_anarchy.1.d:0 "No amount of ragged suits or broken glasses could hide the fact that Waqooyi was a hyena, which had lately turned into a death sentence. Huddled in the last cramped bus for the foreseeable future, hiding in a circle of fleeing yetis, stoked dread within and the few gargoyles and centaurs coming along on the bumpy ride to the port. There would be found the fiendishly overcrowded piers with ships pressing passengers in like sardines in a can. Blend into the chaos: that was Waqooyi's plan.\n\nThe bus soon rolled past destroyed bricks and arches. Apart from the main thoroughfares, nearly every street was empty, seemingly abandoned, with empty security stations bearing the Pact's emblems but none of their personnel.\n\nEars pierced, cracked glass flying out the windows, the force shoving him down under the weight of a dozen busmates. Muffled shouting up front preceded the dull thuds of kicks and punches. Foreign yelling houting signalled the vehicle's new management. A gargoyle translated things to Waqooyi in a whisper: bandits, seeing if they were hiding treasure underneath the seats and in the engine. Paws tore away the fallen bodies that kept him a secret.\n\nA pull, a shot, the bandit leader down, Waqooyi's pistol smoking. His legs moved on their own. Sped past the trail of fellow escapees cowering for cover behind broken windows. Bullets had concrete flying; their whistling through the air welcomed the wailing of a city-wide alarm.\n\nFrom the roadblock ahead, several yeti heads pop up, guns across their chests, pointed at Waqooyi locked in a panicked refugee stampede."
mandate_anarchy.1.a:0 "Beyond, over screaming alarms, the port gates began to close."

mandate_anarchy.2.t:0 "His Face"
mandate_anarchy.2.d:0 "Upon the crags flew a tattered Storm King flag and a hope nearly erased. Furred hands lofted it high, a beacon of remembrance, of who they once were.\n\nTheir sacred home, their home isle, a defiled cage whose iron bars twisted into the forms of the outsiders who had whispered, "This is what your thousands of slaves felt like!" So much for a considerate police force, confiscating books, breaking weapons in two, incinerating Storm King merchandise to burn away any sense of self and dignity. A prison island this was, of containment and no rehabilitation. No hope.\n\nGraffitied slogans painted the numbers of a debt they could not pay, the inmates running free. Banners of the Storm King's face unfurled from the towers about a time they could say they were one, the jailed ones waving flags of liberation. Images of Pact brutality rained from the balconies, of yetis herded around like cattle to designated areas. The unshackled and the unchained streamed through dirt paths and paved avenues, converging at the city's centre.\n\nTreacherous terrain bogged down their march. The remaining Pact battalions were ordered to hold the governmental palace at all costs. The thousand-strong crowd was slow but armed, slow but determined, slow yet never stopping for anyone nor anything.\n\nFrom the arches and the rooftops, if only for a day, the yeti who could not be named, the censored creature, the Storm King—his face blessed the skies, shining upon the land with one core memory:"

mandate_anarchy.7.d:0 "His sophisticated scent announced his presence to the crowded, smelly plaza. It had been difficult, cleaning the stench of the fighting out, so for this occasion, he'd taken a suit and some stolen cologne to stand out before he even appeared. By the platform, with a dozen banners of his face and the Storm King's old flag flying true, he needed not any gesture for them to turn to him.\n\n"Today!" he boomed, with a rifle held high. He savoured in the moment, already many vying for him. "Yes, you all! Today is a glorious occasion." A great banner unfurled behind him, showing off the old King's smug visage. Eruptions of applause struck him with pride. "But enough talk! Let's have at them, like the Storm King would've wished!"\n\nHe hopped off the stage, picked up a rifle, and his side of the city followed in a disorganised procession through the streets. The Storm King's face, hung on large cheap fabric, signalled their arrival to every major corner, the loud orator crying out, "How shall we be strong? Like the Storm King! How shall we be free? Like the Storm King! And how shall we regain our trampled down glory as the old lords of Zebrica? Like the Storm King!"\n\nHe never said his name. Word would spread either way, of a single Kravash pulling every disheartened yeti back on their feet and into his fast expanding march of armed adherents, of a single Kravash scaring away the Pact peacekeepers with a simple phrase:"

mandate_anarchy.9.t:0 "To be a Successor"
mandate_anarchy.9.d:0 "Their final base, up in flames. Dancing in the smoulders, Kohrak had been trading punches with Kravash, the latter's soldiers hooting and waving pictures of their dear leader. He'd chipped away at Kohrak's territory, swooping in like a thief in the night; by the time Kohrak was on their way, he would receive the news: too late, everyone was routed, retreat and recover. Kravash's lightning-fast speed never wavered, his influence never waning until the last, until the melee Kohrak found themselves unable to win.\n\nWhen they first saw Kohrak, his loud and brash reputation had preceded him. Here was a yeti who shouted and beat his chest at everything and everyone then expected the whole world to blindly follow along. Crude and crass was he... leading the charge, staying by his warriors' side, doing the dirty and dangerous work of fighting on the ground. Just like the Storm King: leading a great raid to eclipse all others, streaking through the continent, taking on the noble death of a fighter by the mystical hippogriffs. None of these lily-livered "successors" who sat on their thrones all day while sibling killed sibling hundreds of miles away.\n\nThe action stopped. The rowdy cheers disappeared into the crackling of burning homes. The automatic movement of their fists had vanished. Kravash's fist had given way to an open palm. "It's a waste to kill off good talent. The Storm King would've been proud of you. You now to get help me retake everything we've lost. But first, you need to work on those muscles. My rougher boys'll make fun of scrawny you."

mandate_anarchy.11.d:0 "The next stopping point for Kikru and his clique of armed gangsters that could be inaccurately called a regiment: some coastal settlement with a small port, one of the last exits to the Zebrican mainlands. Kravash had told him to crash the party on top of some strategic objectives. Details didn't matter; Kravash's promise did: the return of everything the Storm King gained.\n\nThe days-long celebration was pockmarked by bullets and shells cutting the air in their name. He fired several pistols to the sky, getting opposing forces wondering and the non-combatants fleeing. The other city factions discovered their buildings melting into rubble without discrimination and at the slightest provocation. This was interspersed by lunch breaks, where Kikru's underlings swapped stolen guns and ordinances, decorating them with paints and markers to truly "own" their weapons and to guess how much they could sell these "designer skins" for cold hard cash. This proved to be good small talk over shackling the non-yetis and herding them into cages.\n\nThe city would fall into Kikru's paws by the third night, which called for a feast. Every structure that survived was their home, their base, their multi-storey dining hall draped over with Kravash's flag and likeness. Bonfires lit the place like a true inferno, fuelled by useless junk like carpets and paintings, their comfy crackling a soundscape to verbal contests over who had the most kills. The last night ended with blood sport, martial arts of the near lethal variety, their sparring forms casting sharp wall-sized shadows from the flames.\n\nKikru sat back and drank some well-needed beer, seated on a pile of wood shavings and bullets: a throne of gunpowder."

mandate_anarchy.13.t:0 "A Voluntary Culling"
mandate_anarchy.13.d:0 "Waqooyi had bided his time in an abandoned wharf within Tempest Shores, escaping notice by the area's decrepit appearance, a working radio station of amateur proportions. The Pact's remnants found here, disguised as wandering fishercreatures, spoke of a treacherous trip to historically Karkadannistani lands or beyond.\n\nThe transmissions he could pick up painted the lightning-fast take-over of the island with the broad and rough strokes of Kravash's crass ideas. "Yetis of all stripes," the madyeti had been heard through crackling speakers, "tonight, another wayward band of brigands has been shooed out, leaving us lands that were never theirs! Starting tomorrow, to all the freed slaves that used to be under those unworthy pirates, you will be making yourselves useful! Lend us your muscle, your strength and might! Our taskmasters should be more than competent to lead you, but if they show weakness? Revolt! Become the taskmaster! That's how the Storm King wanted it! His slaves were slaves that thought for themselves, produced great ideas and proved them by the fist! So be the greatest slave you can be for us!..."\n\nThis and other madnesses, Waqooyi turned off with a turn of the knob, rubbing his eyes and groaning into his paws. A child-let with an army of his own was a volatile mix. A petulant wannabe impressed by duels and weightlifting, the yeti set to restore order here, no matter how fatal that "order" would end up being?\n\n"Come in," cracked another radio. "Ready the boats. Yeti vehicles coming our way." Reflection upon some loudmouth restarting the Storm King's reign could come some other time. Waqooyi took his bags, unplugged the radio sets, then took off to a once-marooned boat."

mandate_kravash.1.t: "Now, Where Were We?"
mandate_kravash.1.d: ""This is not the dawn of a new age, my warriors," Kravash began, his booming voice filling the partially ruined plaza, its many occupants looking up at him with toothy grins "It is the continuation of our years of gold and steel, past the blip of weakness created by self-serving generals and panicked outsiders! Our golden age began at the start of the millennium, and it will last thousands of years more! \n\n"Some among us - perhaps those of you who scare easy - may think that we, the indomitable yetis, cannot hope to fight against the Pact and their puppets. 'After all,' they say, 'we lost to them before, and now we are just an island!' Of course, they forget small important details. I have them here..." \n\nKravash then produced a long piece of paper, and proceeded to read its contents in a dull monotone. Inconsistent training regimens, substandard airship materials, a few tactical blunders - many yetis in the crowd were frowning, confused by their leader’s sudden change in style, but others smirked, sensing an approaching punchline. After half a minute, however, Kravash's speech suddenly flipped from beige prose to a furious roar.\n\n"...AND OUR LEADERS WERE WEAK, SNIVELLING TRAITORS! THEY WISHED TO TAKE THE KINGDOM AND TURN IT INTO SOME NEW-AGE EGO-TRIP! THE STORM KING WAS THE PERFECT YETI, YET THEY REFUSED TO FOLLOW HIS EXAMPLE! THE STORM KING CRUSHED ZEBRICA WITH HALF OF WHAT WE HAVE NOW! WE ONLY NEED TO DO AS HE DID, AND THE CONTINENT WILL BE OURS ONCE MORE!""

mandate_kravash.6.d: "Glyd looked down at her blueprints with childlike glee. The company, or rather the group of designers loosely organised under her command, had just one more week to present their project for Kravash's approval. It had been, in her opinion, the most enjoyable nightmare of her life. The team was busy almost all the time, and the stress was clearly getting to some of them, but the complete lack of regulations or even bullet points as to what the vehicle should do was wonderfully liberating. She and the team could flex their full engineering creativity. \n\nThe blueprints of what the others had taken to calling 'Mister Sputter' were likely indecipherable to outsiders and as a whole were extremely messy. But it worked. Well, the blueprints did, everyone on the team could read them, and she hoped Mister Sputter would be the same. What a handsome chap the thing was - Clawbeak suspension on a half-track, modular armouring and a massive engine visible to any passengers. With part of the engine's cover taken off you could cook marshmallows on it. Probably. Above the cab was a big question mark, as the team hadn't decided what to put there. Glyd herself had suggested a good old machine gun, but others had swayed her with anti-tank guns, grenade launchers and even rocket launchers. Mister Sputter was a mess of wacky ideas, and it was beautiful. Neither Glyd nor the team were daft enough to believe that this was the most effective APC they could build, but that was hardly the point. It was good enough. \n\n Ah, 'good enough'. What an amazing pair of words. This vehicle would be noisy, ugly and unreliable, but it would pass Kravash's sniff test with flying colours. Part of her worried about the poor field mechanics who would constantly be needed to fix the damn things, but another part of her knew just how popular it would be with the troops, what with all its toys and barbaric charm. It was far from the best thing she'd made, but this one had a bit of her soul in it. Tired but happy, she picked up the paper, gave it a smooch, then carried it into the next room."

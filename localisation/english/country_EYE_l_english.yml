##Initial Tree##

EYE_pack_your_bags:0 "Pack Your Bags"
EYE_pack_your_bags_desc:0 ""EMERGENCY ADVISORY TO ALL PACT PERSONNEL: The situation is untenable. Evacuate the island immediately. Should the Mandate be dissolved, YOU WILL BE ON YOUR OWN.""
EYE_fight_for_your_futures:0 "Fight For Your Future" #Comma
EYE_fight_for_your_futures_desc:0 "On this island lays a struggle on a cosmic level for the battered soul of yetikind. Rallying under the banner of one Curadka, an armed movement has joined the fray questioning the very basis of yeti identity..."
EYE_kill_for_your_past:0 "Kill For Your Past"
EYE_kill_for_your_past_desc:0 "The records show that the height of yeti nature is the will to power, to discharge that power upon others. Kravash Thundercrusher and his hyper-reactionary clique echo these bygone sentiments, though perhaps not as eloquently."
EYE_all_thats_been_stolen:0 "All That's Been Stolen"
EYE_all_thats_been_stolen_desc:0 "Our land, our rights, our identity: no matter which way you cut it, the Pact has stripped us of these core traits, without which we may as well be aimless drifters in the seven seas. We must reclaim them."
EYE_all_weve_been_given:0 "All We've Been Given" #Comma
EYE_all_weve_been_given_desc:0 "We have been beset with calamity after calamity. The Pact and its failures are no exception. And yet, we are not powerless, are not without gifts..."
EYE_all_well_take_back:0 "All We'll Take Back"
EYE_all_well_take_back_desc:0 "The foreigners' "kind hearts" are a thin veneer to mask their thirst to pillage and vanquish; their promises of liberty, a meagre excuse to hack away at the very idea of yetidom. This humiliation will not stand."
EYE_new_friends:0 "New Friends" #Comma
EYE_new_friends_desc:0 "Amid great strife, what will unite a sundered land can be something as small and as simple as sympathy. Should we devote ourselves to one another even in dark days, we shall come out mightier than the world's assembled armies."
EYE_new_masters:0 "New Masters"
EYE_new_masters_desc:0 "How the mighty have fallen! Are we truly sons of the Storm King if we were so easily cowed by a pack of dogs and devils? Let them know, let the whole world know: this "Mandate" is under new management."
EYE_cut_off_their_exits:0 "Cut Off Their Exits" #Comma
EYE_cut_off_their_exits_desc:0 "Some bleeding hearts may decry the idea, but we cannot allow the remains of the Pact to make things harder for us by catching up with their superiors on the mainland."
EYE_take_back_the_streets:0 "Take Back The Streets" #Comma
EYE_take_back_the_streets_desc:0 "Behold the broken boulevards of our dreams, tattered by conflict! Despite these horrors, however, let us endure in reclaiming what was lost not only so that they may never leave our side again but that they may blossom into something more..."
EYE_dont_let_them_escape:0 "Don't Let Them Escape"
EYE_dont_let_them_escape_desc:0 "The monsters turn tail, and the slave-minded seek to flee with them! We'll fight them if they get away, so rev up the trucks and put the cages in the back: time to restart our ancient tradition of slavery!"
EYE_chase_away_what_remains:0 "Chase Away What Remains" #Comma
EYE_chase_away_what_remains_desc:0 "The hyenas, centaurs, and gargoyles, however well-meaning they think they are, will try to hold onto this piece of land for as long as they can. No matter how well hidden they may be or no matter how desperate their escape may become, we will give them no quarter."
EYE_shoot_to_kill:0 "Shoot To Kill"
EYE_shoot_to_kill_desc:0 "Apparently, we don't have enough cages and we don't have enough shelters to store as many indentured servants we need. Shoot the rest, both the Pact and the "yetis" too scared to stand on the right side of history."
EYE_to_right_what_is_wrong:0 "To Right What Is Wrong" #Comma
EYE_to_right_what_is_wrong_desc:0 "The Stormlands have chosen their avatar of liberation. To them is opened vast storehouses of charged emotions, of bottled up dreams and nightmares. To them lies the responsibility of charting another—and final—future for yetikind."

##Curadka's Tree##

EYE_the_call_of_tomorrow:0 "The Call Of Tomorrow"
EYE_the_call_of_tomorrow_desc:0 "The Mandate is no more. Our liberator Curadka has freed us from servitude and promises a grand reawakening. Heed his call, and walk proudly into tomorrow!"
EYE_back_from_the_brink:0 "Back From The Brink"
EYE_back_from_the_brink_desc:0 "Our economy is in tatters. To make up for all the damage that's been done, new workshops and factories will be propped up wherever possible to breathe some life into our society."
EYE_prosperity_from_within:0 "Prosperity From Within" #Comma
EYE_prosperity_from_within_desc:0 "The means of production may make for bland reading in foreign schools, but they often hide a joyful truth: we turn nothings into somethings, turning barren lands into industrial powerhouses. That power of transformation lies within all of us, not just Curadka and his inner circle, and under him, using that power will not go unrewarded."
EYE_master_the_basics:0 "Master The Basics"
EYE_master_the_basics_desc:0 "We cannot jump the gun and rush for advanced technologies before first perfecting what's already been made. Simple studies on contemporary techniques are what is required right now; the futurism can come later."
EYE_construct_a_stable_present:0 "Construct A Stable Present"
EYE_construct_a_stable_present_desc:0 "Can we claim to strive for a perfect future if we abandon the present? Of course not. Tomorrow cannot come without today, and so today shall be made as worthwhile as possible."
EYE_our_greatest_minds:0 "Our Greatest Minds"
EYE_our_greatest_minds_desc:0 "Many of the Eye's most brilliant yetis have been abandoned by the Mandate and the devastation its corpse left behind. Let us find these lumps of coal, that they might be turned into diamonds."
EYE_faded_scars:0 "Faded Scars"
EYE_faded_scars_desc:0 "After so long in a slump, things seem to finally be looking up. Unemployment is at an all-time low and poverty is at a minimum. Let's keep this upward trend going for a long, long time."
EYE_stormlands_quality_assured:0 "Chidhoruban Quality Assured"
EYE_stormlands_quality_assured_desc:0 "What shall the creatures of Chidhoru be known for? For their loyalty, their devotion, their beauty? No, they'll be known for making the best damn luxury goods you've ever had the pleasure of laying eyes on, that's what!"
EYE_an_economy_for_the_ages:0 "An Economy For The Ages"
EYE_an_economy_for_the_ages_desc:0 "Genius that he is, Curadka has thought of a way for collectivism to be perfected without disrupting all that's been built. A two-layer economy, with small private businesses allowed and large state-owned properties existing alongside each other."
EYE_cultivation_of_the_mind:0 "Cultivation Of The Mind"
EYE_cultivation_of_the_mind_desc:0 "Cheap words and fiery speeches are not enough to unchain the minds of the citizens. While few may care for philosophy and other less-than-tangible aspects of higher learning, some watered down versions of these topics can help the average yeti think about the world on a deeper level."
EYE_return_to_the_mainland:0 "Return To The Mainland"
EYE_return_to_the_mainland_desc:0 "The rule of bandits and petty warlordism must come to an end. Curadka has rid the Eye of their kind, and now he will do the same to the mainland. Our time of exile is over!"
EYE_enrichment_of_the_soul:0 "Enrichment Of The Soul"
EYE_enrichment_of_the_soul_desc:0 "There can be no point to liberation if the citizens of the new regime are not fulfilled. Aid from the state will help to revitalize entertainment and recreation, giving people tangible evidence of the benevolence and wisdom of their new ruler."
EYE_stormlander_futurism:0 "Stormlander Futurism"
EYE_stormlander_futurism_desc:0 "The Stormland isle is experiencing an explosion of culture and science never before seen. An artistic style merging aspirations of the future with abstract imagery has emerged, bringing everything it touches to life."
EYE_meet_with_the_family:0 "Meet With The Family"
EYE_meet_with_the_family_desc:0 "The most important part of Curadka's vision for the future lies with reintegration of the zebras of the land. The first step begins here, with the Uzerasi. If he can convince them to peacefully join us it could be the key to success."
EYE_teach_them_the_way:0 "Teach Them The Way"
EYE_teach_them_the_way_desc:0 "The disease has been removed, but its stain still lingers. Pillaged towns, emptied vaults, and refugees still mark the land. We must show the yetis of the Windborn region that life is better with us than without."
EYE_faults_of_the_past:0 "Faults Of The Past"
EYE_faults_of_the_past_desc:0 "To look upon the past is to see failure. All previous leaders of the Rainband failed in nearly every aspect, even in war. Their failures have led to the current situation of chaos and disunity. Curadka will be different - he has to be."
EYE_architectural_renewal:0 "Architectural Renewal"
EYE_architectural_renewal_desc:0 "The unique style now iconic of the Stormland isle should be brought to the rest of the rainband. Embedding new buildings and public places with elements from this style will tell everyone that the future is here!"
EYE_from_on_high:0 "From On High"
EYE_from_on_high_desc:0 "The oligarchs and chiefdoms of these new microstates can never stand up to the might of a greater power. It's only a matter of time until someone comes for them - it may as well be us. We're sure to be better to them than anyone else would be, anyways."
EYE_consent_of_the_governed:0 "Consent Of The Governed"
EYE_consent_of_the_governed_desc:0 "Curadka is no autocrat, despite the power he wields. By opening the door to those failed by past regimes the state will solidify and bring security from within. It will also allow Curadka to begin his grand project in earnest..."
EYE_negotiate_for_the_buffer:0 "''Negotiate'' For The Valley"
EYE_negotiate_for_the_buffer_desc:0 "Despite our leader's respect for the dervishes of Hyenia, the sword must come down on the monarchs they've sold themselves to. They will come to regret their hubris, and the people of Stormcloud will be reunited with their brethren once again."
EYE_mechanized_to_perfection:0 "Mechanized To Perfection"
EYE_mechanized_to_perfection_desc:0 "For the sake of our future, food scarcity must be permanently eliminated. With broad implementation of cutting-edge technology, our farms will yield quantities unthinkable just a decade ago. Hunger will become a thing of the past!"
EYE_enlightened_collectivism:0 "Enlightened Collectivism"
EYE_enlightened_collectivism_desc:0 "The working yetis and zebras must not be forgotten on our march to the future, for they are the lifeblood of civilization. They should take in the wealth they create, as the oligarchs and kings of the past once did, as the primary beneficiaries of the nation."
EYE_hoof_to_hand:0 "Hoof To Hand"
EYE_hoof_to_hand_desc:0 "To hate another's race is to be stuck in the past. The distrust between zebras and yetis ends here and now. We are friends, neighbours, and family. No more shall there be a divide between us!"
EYE_new_state_apparatus:0 "New State Apparatus"
EYE_new_state_apparatus_desc:0 "Over three million creatures live in the Stormcloud Valley, and they have been treated like pawns to be taken advantage of without any concern. We will make sure they are cared for, not left to the wolves like those before."
EYE_culture_shock:0 "Culture Shock"
EYE_culture_shock_desc:0 "We cannot exist as a unified society while many still think of anyone outside of their immediate circle as ‘’the other.’’ There will be coexistence and mutual understanding amongst our citizens, whether they want it or not."
EYE_two_becomes_one:0 "Two Becomes One"
EYE_two_becomes_one_desc:0 "It's time for the next step. To not just erase distrust but the very lines between races has never been done before, but how could it if it's never been tried? From now on, we will never again be anything other than two halves of one whole."
EYE_nationalist_ideals:0 "Nationalist Ideals"
EYE_nationalist_ideals_desc:0 "The concept of Chidhoru is amorphous and vague to anyone outside of Curadka's direct circle. It's time to change that. Chidhoru is a nation, a state, a place, and a people, not just an idea."
EYE_secure_the_future:0 "Secure The Future"
EYE_secure_the_future_desc:0 "With all other threats taken care of, our gaze falls to the north. The zebras of the lakes have been taken for a ride by a number of tyrants and false liberators. It's time to set the record straight and secure the future - *our* future."
EYE_from_the_ground_up:0 "From The Ground Up"
EYE_from_the_ground_up_desc:0 "For all his many strengths, the one thing Curadka knows nothing of is war. But he shall learn, and his knowledge will not be tainted by errors of the past, no - his expertise shall be built from the ground up. He might need some help to get there, though."
EYE_what_they_got_right:0 "What They Got Right"
EYE_what_they_got_right_desc:0 "Despite the many faults of the Storm King and his wannabe successors, the one thing they nailed was technological superiority. The grit and perseverance of a foe just cannot best a hulking metal vehicle with a cannon."
EYE_all_for_his_vision:0 "All For His Vision" #Comma
EYE_all_for_his_vision_desc:0 "Though the means of achieving inter-species brotherhood will be swift and rough, it is sweetened by someone who we can all get behind. There is an understanding, then, that every shell and bullet made is with the hope that they shall never be made again."
EYE_sciences_of_the_future:0 "Sciences Of The Future" #Comma
EYE_sciences_of_the_future_desc:0 "The work of technology ought not to be an esoteric matter restricted to a select few. The capacity to create and reshape is inherited by every soul. All we need are the facilities in which these minds can seize the moment."
EYE_march_as_one:0 "March As One" #Comma
EYE_march_as_one_desc:0 "From the shores to the heart of the land, every able and willing creature is rejuvenated by a passion not to renew history but to surpass it. A campaign will be waged not to recite the Storm King's legacy but to wipe the slate clean as beings grounded by an unshakable belief in a singularly just society."
EYE_armor_we_can_be_proud_of:0 "Armor We Can Be Proud Of"
EYE_armor_we_can_be_proud_of_desc:0 "Having updated our tank designs, it's now time to elevate them. Our armored corps will be the pride of the army and the sharpest spear our great leader wields."
EYE_loyal_and_united:0 "Loyal And United" #Comma
EYE_loyal_and_united_desc:0 "When fighting is no longer about revenge but about giving your life to others, your judgment is no longer clouded. It is instead opened to the possibilities of improvement in everything, even the very action of fighting itself. Wouldn't it be wasteful, after all, to not do all you can before your time here ends?"
EYE_an_army_of_the_new_age:0 "An Army Of The New Age" #Comma
EYE_an_army_of_the_new_age_desc:0 "The Storm King would've cemented his successes had he and his generals simply reflected on what to do—both morally and strategically—after the pillaging was over. Fortunately, officers of a new, more pure-hearted order will be deliberate. No more suicidal charges, no more thoughtless raids, for they've been replaced by a long-term plan for what happens long after the conquest."

EYE_the_start_of_something_beautiful:0 "The Start Of Something Beautiful" #Comma
EYE_the_start_of_something_beautiful_desc:0 "Stashed away in the southernmost part of the world, our bloodletting may be overshadowed by "more important" news. But why compete with the press when we have bigger fish to fry? A fully fledged documentary detailing the ongoing transformation of Stormland society will be a special presentation for all to see."
EYE_its_an_art:0 "It's An Art" #Comma
EYE_its_an_art_desc:0 "A song is weaved through everyone in the Union. Unconstrained by arbitrary rule, an explosion of cultural expression is incoming, but it is not something to be afraid of. This—on a national scale—is transcendence."
EYE_propoganda_like_never_before:0 "Propaganda Like Never Before" #Comma
EYE_propoganda_like_never_before_desc:0 "For those keeping their heads down back at home, it is easy to lose sight of the Chidhoruban dream. Empowered by the productive might of so many square miles of fertile land, constant reminders shall stir them up by things that never were... and things that should be."
EYE_new_source_of_pride:0 "A New Source Of Pride" #Comma
EYE_new_source_of_pride_desc:0 "The average movie requires an army to complete: directors, producers, actors, scriptwriters, prop guys... the list never ends. In this quality, however, lies an opportunity: an intentional program to gather families, tribes, and towns to herald the very act of movie-making as a time-honored tradition."
EYE_it_all_comes_back_around:0 "It All Comes Back Around" #Comma
EYE_it_all_comes_back_around_desc:0 "Culture is invaluable because it is, pragmatically speaking, a valuable. An exportable thing. Good business can be made from the works of our appendages, and it doesn't have to be an essential good. Thus, creatures around the world will flock to us and buy what we sell because they see the very essence of ourselves that we've poured into them."
EYE_restore_points_of_contact:0 "Restore Points Of Contact" #Comma
EYE_restore_points_of_contact_desc:0 "To dwell on the past? It's foolishness, and Curadka knows it, bearing no ill intent for the Pact despite the damage they've inflicted upon an entire generation. As he journeys east to meet with Jawharad and her allies, however, a question lingers: What would Curadka's idea of justice be against such a backdrop of evil?"
EYE_not_so_far_away:0 "Not So Far Away" #Comma
EYE_not_so_far_away_desc:0 "Violence breeds violence. Resentment does the same. Curadka knows this, so a radical plan shall be unveiled: Nothing. No punishment, no reparations apart from what Jawharad and others shall give from the goodness of their hearts. By Curadka's example, no Chidhoruban shall follow their wrath."
EYE_forgive_but_dont_forget:0 "Forgive, But Don't Forget" #Comma
EYE_forgive_but_dont_forget_desc:0 "Ideals don't live in a vacuum, and that statement burdens Curadka. A great future cannot be maintained if justice is not upheld, and he knows blanket forgiveness is no justice. What the Pact squandered wasn't petty wealth but precious lives: for that, they must pay the cost..."
EYE_define_the_cultural_border:0 "Define The Cultural Border" #Comma
EYE_define_the_cultural_border_desc:0 "...and the cost is closed borders. Although the measure will likely not last for many centuries, it shall still stand as a harsh mirror to the Pact's cruel misdeeds: just as they've closed their hearts to creatures they should've cared for, so those same creatures shall do the same to them."
EYE_the_pen_and_the_sword:0 "The Pen And The Sword" #Comma
EYE_the_pen_and_the_sword_desc:0 "When all is said and done, when all the glad-handing and pictures are taken with the press, Curadka will have accomplished a rare feat: an international pardon. Enforced by the army, yes, but with every chance for emotions to run hot and negotiations to break down, the Union has come out the better for it."
EYE_proclaim_the_greater_union:0 "Proclaim The Greater Union"
EYE_proclaim_the_greater_union_desc:0 "Victory! At long last, our greatest trial is over, and the final phase of Curadka's vision can now be enacted."
EYE_the_broken_dream:0 "The Broken Dream"
EYE_the_broken_dream_desc:0 "The great nation of Ugabi is no more, but it's people remain. Directionless and without purpose, we can take them by the hoof and show them all the path forward."
EYE_fly_the_banner:0 "Fly The Banner"
EYE_fly_the_banner_desc:0 "While Chidhoru does encompass the southernmost parts of the Great Lakes, we do not seek to subjugate the remainder of the region. Let us work with them rather than against them."
EYE_brothers_and_sisters:0 "Brothers And Sisters"
EYE_brothers_and_sisters_desc:0 "The Hayzeb are no strangers to us. We have already welcomed millions of Hayzeb zebras into Chidhoru, and the rest will follow - even if they have to be persuaded a bit harsher than their southern family."
EYE_in_with_the_old:0 "In With The Old"
EYE_in_with_the_old_desc:0 "An uncivilized yeti would insist that the powerful zebras of the past should be thrown in jail or even executed, but Curadka is anything but. He knows how to get the rich and powerful to think like him, and he can do it again."
EYE_show_of_unity:0 "Show Of Unity"
EYE_show_of_unity_desc:0 "How can we show our new Chidhoruban citizens that we only want what's best for them? Parades, letters to influential leaders, perhaps a tax break or two? Why not try it all?"
EYE_center_of_governance:0 "Center Of Society"
EYE_center_of_governance_desc:0 "Now that our internal borders are as safe as they've ever been, we can finally think of relocating the capital. The Eye is a relic, not fit for the center of Chidhoruban society. Let's shift focus away from it for good."
EYE_no_master_but_one:0 "No Master But One"
EYE_no_master_but_one_desc:0 "There are many Hayzeb zebras that seem to be under the impression that Curadka is just like all the rest: an autocrat who respects no other power. Let's show them how wrong they are!"
EYE_chiefs_to_mayors:0 "Chiefs To Mayors"
EYE_chiefs_to_mayors_desc:0 "There's no reason to remove all the talented creatures already leading small villages and towns, but the position they hold has to be kept up with modern standards. Some renovations are certainly in order!"
EYE_chat_with_the_guerillas:0 "Chat With The Guerillas"
EYE_chat_with_the_guerillas_desc:0 "Some Mozzi rabble have taken up arms and refuse to integrate into Chidhoruban society. This doesn't mean they're enemies, necessarily. Let's see what they have to say before making our move."
EYE_protect_our_interests:0 "Protect Our Interests"
EYE_protect_our_interests_desc:0 "Despite our many victories, there are still things our great nation lacks. Security, for one. The horses to the west reek of the past - let's put their names in the history books where they belong."
EYE_cut_away_the_vestiges:0 "Cut Away The Vestiges"
EYE_cut_away_the_vestiges_desc:0 "The blight upon our army some call ''Gel Frostwind'' has been left to his own devices for too long. He was needed when our Great Leader needed any ally he could get, but he has served his purpose. It's time to take out the trash."
EYE_break_the_chains_of_modernity:0 "Break The Chains Of Modernity"
EYE_break_the_chains_of_modernity_desc:0 "For years, the Hayzeb languished under slavery before bravely liberating themselves under the leadership of The Chainbreaker. Now, there is another chain to break... the chain of modernity."
EYE_we_have_but_one_life:0 "We Have But One Life"
EYE_we_have_but_one_life_desc:0 "All this struggle, all this pain... is it worth it? To bite the hand that feeds you, over and over again? Let us show you that it's not worth wasting your time over. You only have one life, don't waste it fighting for a dead nation."
EYE_doorway_into_arabia:0 "Doorway Into Saddle Arabia"
EYE_doorway_into_arabia_desc:0 "Now that our most precarious border is secured, we can establish our own government there that is more amenable to Chidhoruban interests. Oh, and let's not forget to keep a piece for ourselves."
EYE_our_last_enemy:0 "Our Last Enemy"
EYE_our_last_enemy_desc:0 "None quite embody the ways of old like the Hestrayans. Savage tribes of horse warriors and crumbling dynasties of ponies are all that populate the peninsula. Let us bring them into the future, for their sake more than ours."
EYE_hestrayan_renovation:0 "Hestrayan Renovation"
EYE_hestrayan_renovation_desc:0 "Perhaps the best lesson we can teach the Hestrayans is that racial unity is not just possible, it's preferable. For the first time, they will be united under one banner. They can thank us later."
EYE_freedom_worth_living_for:0 "Freedom Worth Living For"
EYE_freedom_worth_living_for_desc:0 "Freedom! The poor sods think they ever truly had it. Sometimes adequate teaching requires repetition. Let us show that the life they live under our great leader is the best they have ever had, and the best they ever will have."
EYE_arms_of_authority:0 "Arms Of Authority"
EYE_arms_of_authority_desc:0 "Now that construction of the nation is coming to a close, our great leader has deemed it necessary to codify into law what his relationship with the armed forces will be, now and forever."
EYE_rites_of_succession:0 "Rites Of Succession"
EYE_rites_of_succession_desc:0 "The method of succession for the nation of Chidhoru has been left on the table while other matters took stage. Now, it is time to solve this riddle once and for all. The last mistake of the Storm King's memory will finally be rectified."
EYE_a_legacy_to_be_proud_of:0 "A Legacy To Be Proud Of"
EYE_a_legacy_to_be_proud_of_desc:0 "Chidhoru stands tall. Curadka has overcome all obstacles that came his way, and now the results of his labor have come to fruition. A nation, a people, a unified identity. A legacy that will stand the test of time."

##Kravash's Tree##

EYE_the_age_of_yetikind:0 "The Age Of Yetikind"
EYE_the_age_of_yetikind_desc:0 "The Age of Yeti-Kind is upon us, the age when we show the world that only the strongest of races will rule it! The Storm King revealed our might to the world, and Kravash will demonstrate that we can do it again - raise the banners, ready the airships, for our era has come!"
EYE_the_best_we_ever_had:0 "The Best We Ever Had"
EYE_the_best_we_ever_had_desc:0 "Do you know how big the Storm King’s empire was before his defeat? The biggest in the world, in all of history! In a few years we yetis had gone from fighting ourselves to the whole continent! Imagine how powerful we could be if we kept expanding for a decade? What about three decades? A century? Forever?"
EYE_just_make_more_stuff:0 "Just Make More Stuff"
EYE_just_make_more_stuff_desc:0 "Kravash is sick of all these reports - ‘reliability concerns,’ ‘lack of resources,’ ‘hazardous working conditions’. What nonsense. All that matters is that our soldiers have a weapon. If their gun jams, or breaks, or runs out of bullets, so what? Any true yeti will hold it at the other end and use it as a club."
EYE_being_dumb_is_smart:0 "Being Dumb Is Smart"
EYE_being_dumb_is_smart_desc:0 "The difference between a yeti and some wisezebra? The yeti is much stronger, of course! Why should we care so much about being intelligent if it can’t help us crush our enemies? "Ah," heckles the naysayer, "smart people make things like weapons, and they can be used in a fight," but we'll just beat them up then steal their inventions!"
EYE_anyone_can_be_a_soldier_as_long_as_youre_a_yeti:0 "Anyone Can Be A Soldier (As Long As They're A Yeti)"
EYE_anyone_can_be_a_soldier_as_long_as_youre_a_yeti_desc:0 "Ultimately, the one thing a soldier needs to have is strength. And which race is the strongest? It’s no wonder the Storm King won every battle he fought (Ain Trotgourait doesn’t count, they cheated with magic), because yetis are simply the strongest soldiers in the world."
EYE_marvel_at_his_majesty:0 "Marvel At His Majesty"
EYE_marvel_at_his_majesty_desc:0 "The Storm King's Empire had coasts on three oceans. It was larger than both Equus and Griffonia. The King revolutionised airship warfare, and won more battles than anyone in history! Can such a majestic figure's power be put into words?"
EYE_wonder_at_his_wondrosity:0 "Wonder At His Wondrosity"
EYE_wonder_at_his_wondrosity_desc:0 "Let's put it into words! In fact, more than that. I want ten marching songs singing about his military might by tomorrow. Get the little yetis still in school to swear an oath to try to be as strong as him. Build a statue of the Storm King in every town with a population of over one thousand. If he doesn't deserve it, who does?"
EYE_our_best_friends:0 "Our Best Friends"
EYE_our_best_friends_desc:0 "The Storm King might've been the most powerful creature who's ever lived, but he didn't do it alone! He had friends—er, ALLIES! Not everyone's survived, but we can raise a new breed of doers!"
EYE_learn_how_to_kill_good:0 "Learn How To Kill Good"
EYE_learn_how_to_kill_good_desc:0 "To be nice to the eggheads for once, some of this military technology is damn impressive. For instance, these new cannons can kill enemies on the other side of a hill - we definitely need a few of those. Some of the generals probably don't want to change the doctrine of 'going straight at them,' but sometimes winning requires these sacrifices."
EYE_beat_up_all_the_bad_people:0 "Beat Up All The Bad People"
EYE_beat_up_all_the_bad_people_desc:0 "You'd be surprised how easily problems can be solved with violence. Rebels? Just wallop 'em. Draft dodgers? Just wallop 'em. Pact sympathisers? Just wallop 'em. A lot of big thinkers from the other side of the world spend so much time justifying violence, saying how violence is bad unless it’s somehow good. But here? Here we just beat up the bad people. Simple!"
EYE_recreate_his_genius:0 "Recreate His Genius"
EYE_recreate_his_genius_desc:0 "It’s hard to explain why the Storm King was so brilliant, and it’s even harder to replicate it. But Kravash is a great yeti too, and he's learning fast! The strategic genius, the understanding of the great yeti spirit; all these things are present in Kravash - how lucky are we to have two great yetis in such a short time?"
EYE_no_hooves_only_hands:0 "No Hooves, Only Hands"
EYE_no_hooves_only_hands_desc:0 "Zebras have stubby things called "hooves!" How do they hold guns? Actually, no, just get that hands-only policy going! Ban hooves! They should've been born with these hands if they're thinking about holding anything!"
EYE_beat_your_way_to_the_top:0 "Beat Your Way To The Top"
EYE_beat_your_way_to_the_top_desc:0 "Want to get rewards? Want to prove yourself! Do it on the BATTLEFIELD! Actually, no. Do it ANY OTHER PLACE, because if you die on the battlefield, you know corpses can't get strong!"
EYE_good_old_fashioned_pillaging:0 "Good Old Fashioned Pillaging"
EYE_good_old_fashioned_pillaging_desc:0 "The problems with the Storm King's love of sacking wasn't the sacking itself, it was the fact that he didn't really need the wealth and it wasted time. We're absolutely going to start pillaging the pushovers again, but this time we'll hand the loot over to the warriors who need it – we're real generous like that."
EYE_hit_the_books_really_really_hard:0 "Hit The Books Really, Really Hard"
EYE_hit_the_books_really_really_hard_desc:0 "Did you know that the brain is a muscle, too? Too soft to stop a bullet, but research shows that bigger brains means better ideas! Nerds get mandatory schooling! Memorize and innovate for us! The gun smacked in your face will be great motivation!"
EYE_show_off_your_huge_muscles:0 "Show Off Your Huge Muscles"
EYE_show_off_your_huge_muscles_desc:0 "Are you yeti enough? What, do you think we'll let wimps kill themselves when they see how scrawny little zebras crawling on all fours can also get buff? Stop whining and get to the government-mandated gym! MUSCLES guarantee SERVICE guarantee CITIZENSHIP!"
EYE_our_worst_enemies:0 "Our Worst Enemies"
EYE_our_worst_enemies_desc:0 "The enemies have captured our innocent brothers and sisters on the continent! But their liberation is at hand—the weaklings will understand that, in this world, the strong are never defeated! The strong only bide and wait until the time to strike."
EYE_every_yeti_for_themselves:0 "Every Yeti For Themselves"
EYE_every_yeti_for_themselves_desc:0 "We follow the Storm King because he's our role model! Since he was a king, that means we should all be our own kings, independent and needing no one else! We don't accept that "gimmie-more" slave mentality here!"
EYE_make_everyone_else_do_the_work:0 "Make Everyone Else Do The Work"
EYE_make_everyone_else_do_the_work_desc:0 "Are we brutes, willing to stoop to the level of mindlessly putting things on conveyor belts in factories? Let other creatures handle this! See their muscles deflate while we take care of what really matters in life!"

EYE_let_the_lesser_races_think_for_you_desc:0 "Too many yetis at the gym, not enough for the science places, but not our problem! Captured slaves can read and write and invent! Zebras and horses, look at these microscopes and tell us what you see!"
EYE_be_proud_of_your_pride:0 "Be Proud Of Your Pride"
EYE_be_proud_of_your_pride_desc:0 "We politely kidnapped some old Storm King veterans! Just because they're years older than us doesn't mean they're out of the fight! They might have even talked with the mighty Storm King so they can pass his wisdom down to us!"
EYE_just_like_the_good_old_days:0 "Just Like The Good Old Days"
EYE_just_like_the_good_old_days_desc:0 "The sun is shining, the birds are singing, the villages are burning, and the ashes smell good! Creatures scream for their lives—so beautiful! All while we scoop up their belongings! This is the glory they've taken from you, fellow yetis, but you can take it back!"
EYE_convince_them_to_love_it:0 "Convince Them To Love It"
EYE_convince_them_to_love_it_desc:0 "Our future slaves might be afraid of a terrible life, but for them, it's not so bad. We're the ones doing the fighting, the ruling, yada-yada. Harsh living isn't meant for them—they'll be secure under a strong master, and if it gets boring... maybe some bloodsports would shake things up."
EYE_never_doubt_again:0 "Never Doubt Again"
EYE_never_doubt_again_desc:0 "Silence the haters! The world thought we were dead when our first king fell, but that was nothing! What doesn't kill us makes us stronger, and the whole civil war and being occupied thing... so, now we're here, and here to stay!"
EYE_to_those_bereft_of_faith:0 "To Those Bereft Of Faith"
EYE_to_those_bereft_of_faith_desc:0 "Guess who's back! The Storm King! With a fresh new face, he's stronger than ever, and he's got a spring in his step, and the storm clouds are only beginning to roll! Watch out, everyone... this case of "bad weather" has only just begun! YETIS ARE GREAT AGAIN!"
EYE_live_like_youre_already_dead:0 "Live Like You're Already Dead"
EYE_live_like_youre_already_dead_desc:0 "In fights, creatures die. In war, they die all around you. The wimps will whine about how it's disgusting, but we yetis are born to die! We're smarter than everyone because we know it's part of living! So, go, enjoy the treasures you've stolen! Kravash's not gonna stop you!"

EYE_banging_rocks_together:0 "Banging Rocks Together"
EYE_banging_rocks_together_desc:0 "It shouldn’t need to be said, but Yetis aren't stupid. That aside, a lot of science is stupid. Why should we care about stuff like crop research and theoretical physics? Going forward, research will be focussed exclusively on military R&D... and maybe a bit of industry and electronic stuff."
EYE_modern_methods_of_conquest:0 "Modern Methods Of Conquest"
EYE_modern_methods_of_conquest_desc:0 "Walking hundreds of miles on foot doesn't really fit our doctrine of rapid attacks — that and it's really boring, so let's get some yetis working on some heavy trucks. As for tanks, a mobile blasting platform's damn useful, but let's rotate who gets to sit in them so they don’t get complacent under all that armour."
EYE_dedicated_chemical_weapons_squads:0 "Dedicated Chemical Weapons Facilities"
EYE_dedicated_chemical_weapons_squads_desc:0 "Everyone likes a fair fight. Well, every yeti likes a fair fight, but unfortunately a lot of the punier races don’t fight fair, so when they fight dirty, we can fight dirtier. Hopefully, a bit of mustard gas should teach 'em to conduct themselves more honourably."
EYE_mild_pragmatism:0 "Mild Pragmatism"
EYE_mild_pragmatism_desc:0 "We're conquerors, not murderers. Why should we kill a bunch of zebras that aren't fighting back? There’s no challenge or honour in it, and frankly, it's not strategic. We'll keep spooking the locals, remind them who's in charge, but let's keep the pummelling to the actual resistance."
EYE_the_place_of_the_weak:0 "The Place Of The Weak"
EYE_the_place_of_the_weak_desc:0 "The weak suffer, we endure. Whenever anyone is born, at any time, in any place, to whatever race, they are faced with a choice: be strong, or be weak. The Yeti Dominion is the consequence of taking the lazy way out. We won't kill them, but they will know who their masters are."
EYE_the_best_of_the_worst:0 "Best Of The Worst"
EYE_the_best_of_the_worst_desc:0 "Overall, hyenas are a pretty puny race. How quickly did they capitulate after the invasion again? But putting the past aside, they can pull their finger out when they really want to. And some of them are almost – ALMOST – as strong as a yeti. Let's hand some of the power to a few of the tougher-looking collaborators. They've proved their potential, and it's not like they actually pose a threat anymore."
EYE_racial_stratification:0 "Impartial Stratification"
EYE_racial_stratification_desc:0 "We aren't going to badmouth anyone who wants to fight for us – the more the merrier. That being said, the other races are weaker. That's just reality. Going forward, all races will have their own units that will supplement the tough yeti core. Maybe get zebras on recon, hyenas on artillery, that kind of thing."
EYE_introduction_of_the_psuedoyetis:0 "Introduction Of The Psuedo-yetis"
EYE_introduction_of_the_psuedoyetis_desc:0 "If you look at them from far enough away, and the centaur is standing straight-on and the gargoyle has their wings folded in, you could probably mistake them for us. Yetis are stronger, obviously, but they're similar enough that we can consider them cousins and try and get them into the family."

EYE_everything_is_burning:0 "Unintended Consequences"
EYE_everything_is_burning_desc:0 "Everything is burning. Kravash followed his idol to the very end: an early death and an abandoned empire. There can be no next grand campaign, at least not while turmoil snaps at us from all sides."
EYE_reality_check:0 "Reality Check"
EYE_reality_check_desc:0 "The strong do have advantages over the weak, but Kravash failed to see strength as more than a muscle-measuring contest. The Storm King himself rose to power with the help of intelligence, innovation, and cunning—skills we'll get back to rewarding yetis for."
EYE_clean_up_his_damn_mess:0 "Clean Up His Damn Mess"
EYE_clean_up_his_damn_mess_desc:0 "Kravash was too stupid to slow down and consolidate. Fighting is indeed glorious; the policing and peacekeeping of angry subjects, not so much. We're not about to let go of our precious chunk of Zebrica, though, even if it means sending the army to sternly tell all non-yetis to shut up or else."
EYE_put_the_brutes_in_their_places:0 "Put The Brutes In Their Place"
EYE_put_the_brutes_in_their_places_desc:0 "Even when we were led by a complete idiot, we yetis somehow took control of a great part of Zebrica again, yet the zebras never do learn, stirring unrest once more—the Mozzi head among them. We'll make their latest attempt at insurrection a short and painful teaching moment."
EYE_reward_the_subservient:0 "Reward The Subservient"
EYE_reward_the_subservient_desc:0 "For an empire to be stable, it must appeal to as many creatures as possible. While the captive population we have aren't happy about their lot, they don't need to survive in barely liveable conditions. The mere promise of moving up the ladder will be enough to ward off thoughts of uprising."
EYE_sabotage_camel_resistance:0 "Sabotage Camel Resistance Efforts"
EYE_sabotage_camel_resistance_desc:0 "From the woodwork, all sorts of creatures watch the chaos for an opportunity to rid themselves of our yoke. While the camels lay in the far reaches of the Storm King's old empire, that doesn't give them the freedom to run from us a second time."
EYE_reinforce_ovingoland:0 "Reinforce Ovingoland"
EYE_reinforce_ovingoland_desc:0 "There is only so much fleeing one can endure before their will to rebel is snuffed out, warped into a servile husk of their former selves. The Ovingolanders had their years of freedom. No more—and never again."
EYE_cogs_in_a_machine:0 "Cogs In A Machine"
EYE_cogs_in_a_machine_desc:0 "Mindless hacking and slashing will be a thing in the past. Our officers will be free once again to put in more thought to our plans than "loot and pillage," and for that to happen, rigid discipline must return to our rank and file."
EYE_codify_the_katabatian_ideal:0 "Codify The Katabatian Ideal"
EYE_codify_the_katabatian_ideal_desc:0 "If there's one advantage that Kravash’s insane leadership provided, it's how easy it is to recontextualise everything he's done. As long as the final product helps us in the Eye, the Katabatian ideal is anything we want it to be..."
EYE_declare_the_rule_of_elites:0 "Declare The Rule Of Elites"
EYE_declare_the_rule_of_elites_desc:0 "Autocracy clearly isn’t working. We've tried it twice and it's failed miserably when it comes to actually holding territory. To prevent another catastrophe, a council of warlords, industrialists and every other yeti inclined to coup us will help with our reign."
EYE_create_a_new_history:0 "Create A New History"
EYE_create_a_new_history_desc:0 "To justify the blood we've shed, brute force alone won't be enough. Kravash's excuse of a country couldn't withstand the test of time, so he must give way to a stabler foundation that is yet eager to overturn all that the old world knew. How else could we consolidate an empire of corpses?"

EYE_denounce_the_barbarian:0 "Denounce The Barbarian"
EYE_denounce_the_barbarian_desc:0 "Had Kravash lived, we would've been living in an idiocracy by now, but even in death, he's doomed us all. The revolters certainly agree, so this provisional government will lambaste him as we try to "fix" this mighty mess we find ourselves in...."
EYE_digestable_insanity:0 "Digestible Insanity"
EYE_digestable_insanity_desc:0 "Like it or not, Katabatia was founded on an ethos of all brawn and no brain, which is terrible for national cohesion. However, we can spin this off as incomplete ideas spoken by an imperfect creature. Maybe what is best in life is to be like Kravash's best self: actualizing our potential in exciting ways!"
EYE_a_page_out_of_hailstorms_book:0 "A Page Out Of Hailstorm's Book"
EYE_a_page_out_of_hailstorms_book_desc:0 "If there's a perfect role model for turning anarchy into industry, it's Ikvus Hailstorm who, in those early post-Storm King days, built corporations on the ruins of a fallen empire. Whatever his successes were, we certainly need them now to reignite our blasted economy."
EYE_tradition_off_the_assembly_line:0 "Tradition Off The Assembly Line" #Comma
EYE_tradition_off_the_assembly_line_desc:0 "In a realm deprived of knowledge about their real history, how can the average yeti get up to speed? Merchandise! Imagine toys, books, music, clothes, heirlooms, trading cards—all topped off with tips and trivia about our shared heritage!"
EYE_ancestry_you_can_buy:0 "Ancestry You Can Buy" #Comma
EYE_ancestry_you_can_buy_desc:0 ""Yetis! You've been bred into a long line of brave warriors, but how do we know this? Which conquerors were you descended from? Our sponsors at Cloud Seed have uncovered extensive family trees dating to the beginning of written history! For a small subscription fee, you can....""
EYE_it_really_is_that_easy:0 "It Really Is That Easy" #Comma
EYE_it_really_is_that_easy_desc:0 "What Kravash unveiled was an attitude that the common creature could grasp. Gods and ideologies are abstract concepts, but displays of strength? Stuff with price tags? Literal groups of flesh-and-blood creatures? That goes to show that this country is founded on basic—and useful—realities."
EYE_deify_thundercrusher:0 "Deify Thundercrusher"
EYE_deify_thundercrusher_desc:0 "How did he do that voice? Ahem. "Oh great yetis! Children of the Storm! Thundercrusher may be gone, but our work for the great leader continues!" Nope, still too flowery..."
EYE_measured_sacrifices:0 "Measured Sacrifices"
EYE_measured_sacrifices_desc:0 "It's understandable that not many modern states perform sacrifices on sentient beings anymore, but you'd be surprised just how many birds it kills with one stone. Useless citizens? Dead. Traitors on death row? Their executions just got a lot more exciting. Rebellious subjects? No better way to spook them. Gullible populace? What a way to increase fanaticism!"
EYE_enshrine_the_warrior_cult:0 "Enshrine The Warrior Cult"
EYE_enshrine_the_warrior_cult_desc:0 "Usually, nations realise that continuously attacking while ignoring casualties is a rather stupid way to prosecute a war. However, after all those years under Kravash, we've gotten surprisingly good at these "tactics" – all that's needed is a nudge towards the worship of aggression and we'll have the greatest offensive army in the world."
EYE_the_eternal_yeti_messiah:0 "The Eternal Yeti Messiah"
EYE_the_eternal_yeti_messiah_desc:0 ""As yetis continue to charge into the sacred bloodshed and glory of war, who must lead us? Gel is her name, and Gel is the only yeti capable of shepherding the children of Kravash into greater glories. Only She has the mind, brawn and soul to hold our highest office and raise our greatest banners.""
EYE_unlimited_power:0 "Unlimited Power"
EYE_unlimited_power_desc:0 "Some of our more exotic technology isn’t about helping us win, it's more about preventing a loss and saving our warriors from embarrassment. The nuke is the ultimate iteration of these trump card technologies – Kravash's meat-headed principles would've hated such things, but frankly, that's an endorsement."
EYE_their_souls_yet_live:0 "Their Souls Yet Live"
EYE_their_souls_yet_live_desc:0 ""Do not grieve for your fallen brothers and sisters! They died as warriors, there is no better path! If you can fight, fight! If you cannot fight, work! When the storm howls, their voices roar in the name of your glory!""

EYE_something_out_of_nothing:0 "Something Out Of Nothing"
EYE_something_out_of_nothing_desc:0 "The Eye is great, and with all the looting we've done it's looking as good as the days of the Storm King. However centralisation has its limits, especially with a dominion as big as ours. Now we certainly aren't about to contract, but devolving power to regional despots should help keep the peace. Well, not peace, but at least stability."
EYE_pick_up_the_slack:0 "Pick Up The Slack"
EYE_pick_up_the_slack_desc:0 "Truth be told, there's nothing wrong with expansionism. Kravash's problem was that it was horrendously rushed and, on the whole, terribly organised. Let's neaten up the borders a little, and then we can finish what he started. If Kravash could do it, how hard can conquering a continent really be?"
EYE_commit_to_the_bit:0 "Commit To The Bit"
EYE_commit_to_the_bit_desc:0 "Once upon a time, the Karkadannistanis served us as a useful tool to keep Hestraya at bay while the Storm King happily journeyed north. Now, we're once again asking for their support to be a stopgap against the far western ponies as we try to put the pieces back together."
EYE_independence_is_a_fantasy:0 "Independence Is A Fantasy"
EYE_independence_is_a_fantasy_desc:0 "It's not the zebras' fault that they built their kingdoms within a stone's throw of the Eye, but the consequences are what they are. As long as the mighty yetis have their empire, the zebras must become their subjects. It's up to them how good or bad their servitude is, but independence is not on the table."
EYE_back_to_the_time_before_time:0 "Back To A Time Before Time"
EYE_back_to_the_time_before_time_desc:0 "According to Kravash, Katabatia is the modern fruit of primeval seeds, being the realisation of a mythical warrior-realm millennia in the making – a sacred empire of bloodshed and might made manifest in material reality. A childish fantasy to be sure... but not useless as an idea..."
EYE_blessings_of_the_cosmos:0 "Blessings Of The Cosmos"
EYE_blessings_of_the_cosmos_desc:0 "Weather control isn't actually that hard for modern yeti states, and it’s damn useful for optimising flight conditions, but not everyone knows how easy it is, which is something we can use to our advantage. "Nay, this is not the work of a few meteorologists, this is proof the yetis’ divinity! The great tempests roil in our blood!""
EYE_strip_them_for_all_they_are_worth:0 "Strip Them For All They Are Worth"
EYE_strip_them_for_all_they_are_worth_desc:0 "Let's be clear: the autonomous fiefs are still entirely Katabatian – that autonomy is solely due to the ease it provides to the administration. But everything of worth in those territories is ours: their resources, their industry, their riches. It's time to make sure everyone's pulling their weight."
EYE_at_long_last:0 "At Long Last"
EYE_at_long_last_desc:0 "It seems that this house of cards has finally become stable. And yes, the credit goes to us, this has all happened in spite of Kravash’s legacy, not because of it. We could say it's a thankless job... but we're not in this to be thanked. Let's have a toast to the Katabatian golden age: may it last slightly longer than our lifetimes!"
EYE_hell_frozen_over:0 "Tartarus Frozen Over"
EYE_hell_frozen_over_desc:0 "Kravash may have wept, for there were no more worlds to conquer.\nBut Kravash is gone. \nWe remain.\nAnd we smile..."

mandate_anarchy.1.t:0 "Forget About Free Mandates"
mandate_anarchy.1.d:0 "No amount of ragged suits or broken glasses could hide the fact that Waqooyi was a hyena, which had lately turned into a death sentence. Huddled in the last cramped bus for the foreseeable future, hiding in a circle of fleeing yetis, stoked dread within and the few gargoyles and centaurs coming along on the bumpy ride to the port. There would be found the fiendishly overcrowded piers with ships pressing passengers in like sardines in a can. Blend into the chaos: that was Waqooyi's plan.\n\nThe bus soon rolled past destroyed bricks and arches. Apart from the main thoroughfares, nearly every street was empty, seemingly abandoned, with empty security stations bearing the Pact's emblems but none of their personnel.\n\nEars pierced, cracked glass flying out the windows, the force shoving him down under the weight of a dozen busmates. Muffled shouting up front preceded the dull thuds of kicks and punches. Foreign yelling houting signalled the vehicle's new management. A gargoyle translated things to Waqooyi in a whisper: bandits, seeing if they were hiding treasure underneath the seats and in the engine. Paws tore away the fallen bodies that kept him a secret.\n\nA pull, a shot, the bandit leader down, Waqooyi's pistol smoking. His legs moved on their own. Sped past the trail of fellow escapees cowering for cover behind broken windows. Bullets had concrete flying; their whistling through the air welcomed the wailing of a city-wide alarm.\n\nFrom the roadblock ahead, several yeti heads pop up, guns across their chests, pointed at Waqooyi locked in a panicked refugee stampede."
mandate_anarchy.1.a:0 "Beyond, over screaming alarms, the port gates began to close."

mandate_anarchy.2.t:0 "His Face"
mandate_anarchy.2.d:0 "Upon the crags flew a tattered Storm King flag and a hope nearly erased. Furred hands lofted it high, a beacon of remembrance, of who they once were.\n\nTheir sacred home, their home isle, a defiled cage whose iron bars twisted into the forms of the outsiders who had whispered, "This is what your thousands of slaves felt like!" So much for a considerate police force, confiscating books, breaking weapons in two, incinerating Storm King merchandise to burn away any sense of self and dignity. A prison island this was, of containment and no rehabilitation. No hope.\n\nGraffitied slogans painted the numbers of a debt they could not pay, the inmates running free. Banners of the Storm King's face unfurled from the towers about a time they could say they were one, the jailed ones waving flags of liberation. Images of Pact brutality rained from the balconies, of yetis herded around like cattle to designated areas. The unshackled and the unchained streamed through dirt paths and paved avenues, converging at the city's centre.\n\nTreacherous terrain bogged down their march. The remaining Pact battalions were ordered to hold the governmental palace at all costs. The thousand-strong crowd was slow but armed, slow but determined, slow yet never stopping for anyone nor anything.\n\nFrom the arches and the rooftops, if only for a day, the yeti who could not be named, the censored creature, the Storm King — his face blessed the skies, shining upon the land with one core memory:"
mandate_anarchy.2.a:0 "That they shall be divided and broken no more."

mandate_anarchy.3.t:0 "Disorientation 1" #Comma
mandate_anarchy.3.d:0 "Trapped in his office with two other bureaucrats like him (they'd been hogging the room ever since they discovered it was the safest spot in the entire building), hyena Hibeen peeked out the window: yetis smashing windows, pilfering garbage bins, and most importantly, never looking up. They always seemed to be in a hurry; a mid-level commercial floor wouldn't interest them if it never showed signs of life.\n\nThe gargoyle Gahist was tying her shotgun via rope to the ceiling to while the time away. Tie it to the door, have some unsuspecting nutjob open it, dish out a nasty bloody surprise.\n\nBut Yansagusi, the centaur, got their attention by clearing his table from the maps and notes he'd drawn. "Again, they've blocked our food shipments, all the major thoroughfares are closing, and we've got no word on our money from our own superiors. We can't wait the natives out."\n\n"Finally." And Gahist cocked another shotgun. "We're taking the fight to them now?"\n\n"So they'll kill us?!" Hibeen yelled as loud as a whisper possibly could yell. "There has to be some way to placate them. They're only protesting because things have gone horribly wrong! We'll push for... foreign aid or promise them autonomy!"\n\n"Too little too late," said the centaur. "If we want to preserve our lives, the best option is to leave."\n\n"But what about the Mandate? Self-rule? All of our promises?"\n\n"Let them rule themselves without us—Gahist, stop your grumbling. Think of it this way: you'll get to kill them later if you don't get over your newfound bloodlust. Come on, everyone, pack whatever you can...""
mandate_anarchy.3.a:0 "Order waning with time..."

mandate_anarchy.4.t:0 "Musical Chairs"
mandate_anarchy.4.d:0 "The doors of the throne room creaked open, and Curadka entered along with a band of yeti and storm creature followers. There was no one inside, as the former occupants of the Storm King's old palace had completely abandoned it. The room had been stripped of anything valuable, so the only object of note was the throne itself.\n\nCuradka stopped in front of it as his followers spread out to secure the room and ensure it really was empty. He stared at the vacant seat of black stone in thought. It had changed hands from the Storm King to the claimant regent Ikvus Hailstorm, then to the hyenas, and now, it was finally his to take. He mused to himself that he might've been the last chance the yetis would get for a better future, then chuckled. How bad things must have gotten that he, of all the yetis, was the one who the people of Stormland had turned to in their darkest hour?\n\nHe turned his gaze away from the throne where tyrants had once sat, and realized the other yetis in the room were not looking at the empty seat, but at him, with hope and admiration gleaming in their eyes."
mandate_anarchy.4.a:0 "This throne belongs to all of us, not just me."

mandate_anarchy.5.t:0 "End of Expedition" #Comma
mandate_anarchy.5.d:0 "Less than a hundred steps left, then he would rule. Kravash had slaughtered through the ancient halls that stood between him and the Storm King's throne; before that, his gun and blade had whetted their appetite for blood.\n\nThere in the royal chamber lay the soft underbelly of the Mandate: politicians and more politicians, brooking no real defense left save pistols and random sharp objects. A bullet anywhere but to the head was their fate—they could still be of use, Kravash reasoned. They could be witnesses to a change of power, to a powerful statement, that the storm would conquer them all up to their final waking moments.\n\nOnly the gurgling of blood violated the silence after the near-massacre. Vomit and spittle and other bodily fluids stained the cold stone floor, colonizers' beautiful blood stains marring their choice-cut suits. On the other side, the Storm King himself sat there smiling from above albeit only in the depths of Kravash's wired-up imagination. Each step towards the throne was a victory lap he savored, licking his lips as his reign begun.\n\nWhen he turned around to sit down, it was as if the world had been divided to two types of people: the healthy and the living yetis and storm creatures who'd be bountifully rewarded, and the dying coming in by the wheelbarrows, bodies piling up into little pyramids, moaning, bleeding out. A barely living, barely breathing audience."
mandate_anarchy.5.a:0 "Rejoice."

mandate_anarchy.6.t:0 "The Orator"
mandate_anarchy.6.d:0 "In a shadowy alley in the city of Boltport, a hyena dervish named Raacsan was hiding. Though he had com here in an effort to teach the Six Principles to the yetis of the island, he had since found himself on the run from them. But without any access to a boat or ship, there is no way to escape.\n\nJust as he sighs in exhaustion and desperation, he hears a voice coming from the street. Moving nimbly and quietly like a true dervish, he sneaks to take a peek out of the alleyway. There, he saw a yeti unlike most he had seen: lithe and soft spoken, but with a voice full of conviction. This yeti spoke of the past, the present, and the future of the yetis. He spoke to an enraptured audience about what had to happen for yetikind to pick itself up out of the mud and unleash the potential that had been suppressed by their past tyrant kings and fickle overlords, to break the cycle of ignorance and hatred that had kept their species chained for so long.\n\nIn spite of himself, Raacsan took a deep breath to gather his courage and emerged from the alley, joining the crowd that had formed around the speaker. To Raacsan, this yeti's words seemed to illuminate the space around him, and he realized to his disbelief that there had been no need for him to spread the Six Principles here at all - the yetis already had one of their own doing it for him. No, Raacsan realized he was here for a different reason. He was here to serve the yeti in front of him - a yeti by the name of Curadka."
mandate_anarchy.6.a:0 "Perhaps everything wasn't bad as he had feared."

mandate_anarchy.7.t:0 "Return Stroke"
mandate_anarchy.7.d:0 "His sophisticated scent announced his presence to the crowded, smelly plaza. It had been difficult, cleaning the stench of the fighting out, so for this occasion, he'd taken a suit and some stolen cologne to stand out before he even appeared. By the platform, with a dozen banners of his face and the Storm King's old flag flying true, he needed not any gesture for them to turn to him.\n\n"Today!" he boomed, with a rifle held high. He savoured in the moment, already many vying for him. "Yes, you all! Today is a glorious occasion." A great banner unfurled behind him, showing off the old King's smug visage. Eruptions of applause struck him with pride. "But enough talk! Let's have at them, like the Storm King would've wished!"\n\nHe hopped off the stage, picked up a rifle, and his side of the city followed in a disorganised procession through the streets. The Storm King's face, hung on large cheap fabric, signalled their arrival to every major corner, the loud orator crying out, "How shall we be strong? Like the Storm King! How shall we be free? Like the Storm King! And how shall we regain our trampled down glory as the old lords of Zebrica? Like the Storm King!"\n\nHe never said his name. Word would spread either way, of a single Kravash pulling every disheartened yeti back on their feet and into his fast expanding march of armed adherents, of a single Kravash scaring away the Pact peacekeepers with a simple phrase:"
mandate_anarchy.7.a:0 "Like the Storm King!"

mandate_anarchy.8.t:0 "Kohrak"
mandate_anarchy.8.d:0 "As Curadka led an armed mob of his loyalists in the streets of the Eye of the Storm, he suddenly stopped and raised his arm, signalling his group to stop. A lone, hulking storm creature was approaching them. Some of Curadka's yetis raised their weapons and muttered curses, but he called them off, allowing the silent storm creature to come closer. With each step, he could hear his followers become quieter as the tension rose.\n\nThen, a glaive held in its paws, the storm creature stopped right in front of Curadka and stared up at the taller yeti. Without blinking or breaking eye contact, he stared back down intensely. In his peripheral vision, he could see one of his followers aiming a rifle at the creature's head. Finally, it raised its weapon...\n\n...And slammed it down into the pavement, cracking the surface. The storm creature dropped to one knee and lowered its head in submission. Seeing this, Curadka smiled and slowly placed a gentle hand on the storm creature's shoulder. "You may rise," he said. The storm creature did so. "You are welcome to our ranks. A bright future lies ahead of us all, and you've made the right choice joining our cause.""
mandate_anarchy.8.a:0 "The storm creature nodded."

mandate_anarchy.9.t:0 "To be a Successor"
mandate_anarchy.9.d:0 "Their final base, up in flames. Dancing in the smoulders, Kohrak had been trading punches with Kravash, the latter's soldiers hooting and waving pictures of their dear leader. He'd chipped away at Kohrak's territory, swooping in like a thief in the night; by the time Kohrak was on their way, he would receive the news: too late, everyone was routed, retreat and recover. Kravash's lightning-fast speed never wavered, his influence never waning until the last, until the melee Kohrak found themselves unable to win.\n\nKravash had to admit that Kohrak was a fierce combatant, not afraid to get its paws dirty. Always leading the charge, staying by his warriors' side in battle. It reminded Kravash much of himself. But much to his surprise, Kohrak did not fight until the bitter end.\n\nInstead, the storm creature simply surrendered and kneeled before Kravash, acknowledging his superiority and bowing its masked head in silent respect. When Kravash saw this, he grinned widely. His fist gave away to an open palm as he offered his hand to the defeated warrior. "It's a waste to kill off good talent. The Storm King would've been proud of you. You now to get help me retake everything we've lost. But first, you need to work on your skills and strength. You can lose to me, but you can only serve me if you never lose to our enemies. Got it?""
mandate_anarchy.9.a:0 "A raw, unfiltered Storm King in the making, then, they'll serve."

mandate_anarchy.10.t:0 "Disorientation 2" #Comma
mandate_anarchy.10.d:0 "Typhoon City couldn't live up to its name since it was just a glorified trade post facing the peaceful side of the ocean, but it'd been the farthest outpost of Mandate control, or so Yansagusi and his crew could gather. That was the sole reason why they'd crammed themselves in a centaur car for the trip. "Like I said, that vanity project from one of my bosses," Yansagusi continued: "he drained the creeks to create an artificial canal. They never finished the job, but they got far enough to make a dry bed. Problem was, they drained it too quick, ended up stranding some fishing boats. That was a week ago."\n\n"So we just push a boat to the sea?" Hibeen whined. "Why didn't you tell us sooner about this stupid plan of yours!?"\n\n"Because you'd complain the whole trip," Yansagusi shot back. "Hibeen... Hibeen! This is no time to be shaking in your boots!"\n\n"Wh-why isn't anyone shooting at us?"\n\n"Maybe because it's truly abandoned?" Gahist piped up, pumping her shotgun to scare the coward. "Who's gonna shoot an old beat-up car here anyway? A bunch of brain-dead bas—"\n\nSharp, the world shook and turned all over, cracked windows shooting shards in what Hibeen could only now register as an explosion, flying out and every limb, every single painful limb and fur, crying, squelching out blood, scars screaming pus, other fluids, and he was aware, too aware, nightmares morphing into horrific reality: death. Wished it was all over, fading into darkness, into grace, into a quick end, but a foreign language he'd studied to be closer to the race of his would-be murderers... he heard, he listened, only mumbles in his damaged ears, but the silhouettes walked, extensions out of their claws: guns, his heart pounding, saying please, please, please, spare me—"

mandate_anarchy.11.t:0 "It's a Party in the M.o.E."
mandate_anarchy.11.d:0 "The next stopping point for Kikru and his clique of armed gangsters that could be inaccurately called a regiment: some coastal settlement with a small port, one of the last exits to the Zebrican mainlands. Kravash had told him to crash the party on top of some strategic objectives. Details didn't matter; Kravash's promise did: the return of everything the Storm King gained.\n\nThe days-long celebration was pockmarked by bullets and shells cutting the air in their name. He fired several pistols to the sky, getting opposing forces wondering and the non-combatants fleeing. The other city factions discovered their buildings melting into rubble without discrimination and at the slightest provocation. This was interspersed by lunch breaks, where Kikru's underlings swapped stolen guns and ordinances, decorating them with paints and markers to truly "own" their weapons and to guess how much they could sell these "designer skins" for cold hard cash. This proved to be good small talk over shackling the non-yetis and herding them into cages.\n\nThe city would fall into Kikru's paws by the third night, which called for a feast. Every structure that survived was their home, their base, their multi-storey dining hall draped over with Kravash's flag and likeness. Bonfires lit the place like a true inferno, fuelled by useless junk like carpets and paintings, their comfy crackling a soundscape to verbal contests over who had the most kills. The last night ended with blood sport, martial arts of the near lethal variety, their sparring forms casting sharp wall-sized shadows from the flames.\n\nKikru sat back and drank some well-needed beer, seated on a pile of wood shavings and bullets: a throne of gunpowder."
mandate_anarchy.11.a:0 "I get paid to shoot 'em up!"

mandate_anarchy.12.t:0 "A Daring Raid"
mandate_anarchy.12.d:0 "Raacsan, now fully a part of Curadka's liberation army, had offered to take part in an operation that Curadka and his growing mass of followers were executing on a Pact storage compound. Using his skills learned as a dervish that fought to liberate Hyenia nearly a decade ago, Raacsan took the group of armed yetis he had been tasked with leading away from danger and detection and reached a warehouse in the middle of the compound\n\nRaacsan checked the yetis behind him, making sure that Curadka, who was amongst them, was doing fine. He wondered for a moment why a yeti such as Curadka felt the need to join such operations personally, but then admonished himself for thinking less of the one he now followed. Raacsan reminded himself of the faith being placed in him and with determination, quietly opened the door to the warehouse. Though the lights were on, no Pact personnel were inside, and he motioned for the rest of his group to follow him in. They did so, Curadka last among them, and just as Raacsan stepped forward to speak with him, a gargoyle armed with a rifle stepped out from the door they had entered from and pointed it at the closest target: Curadka.\n\nMind racing, Raacsan lunged towards the yeti, tackling him to the ground as two shot were fired, one after the other. A sharp pain bursted through Raacsan's shoulder, and he looked up to see the gargoyle had already been downed by one of his comrades. He looked down to see Curadka below him, unharmed and smiling. The last thing Raacsan thought before blacking out was that he was going to be a burden for his team, as they'd have to carry him for the rest of the operation."

mandate_anarchy.13.d:0 "Waqooyi had bided his time in an abandoned wharf within Tempest Shores, escaping notice by the area's decrepit appearance, a working radio station of amateur proportions. The Pact's remnants found here, disguised as wandering fishercreatures, spoke of a treacherous trip to historically Karkadannistani lands or beyond.\n\nThe transmissions he could pick up painted the lightning-fast take-over of the island with the broad and rough strokes of Kravash's crass ideas. "Yetis of all stripes," the madyeti had been heard through crackling speakers, "tonight, another wayward band of brigands has been shooed out, leaving us lands that were never theirs! Starting tomorrow, to all the freed slaves that used to be under those unworthy pirates, you will be making yourselves useful! Lend us your muscle, your strength and might! Our taskmasters should be more than competent to lead you, but if they show weakness? Revolt! Become the taskmaster! That's how the Storm King wanted it! His slaves were slaves that thought for themselves, produced great ideas and proved them by the fist! So be the greatest slave you can be for us!..."\n\nThis and other madnesses, Waqooyi turned off with a turn of the knob, rubbing his eyes and groaning into his paws. A child-let with an army of his own was a volatile mix. A petulant wannabe impressed by duels and weightlifting, the yeti set to restore order here, no matter how fatal that "order" would end up being?\n\n"Come in," cracked another radio. "Ready the boats. Yeti vehicles coming our way." Reflection upon some loudmouth restarting the Storm King's reign could come some other time. Waqooyi took his bags, unplugged the radio sets, then took off to a once-marooned boat."

mandate_curadka.1.d:0 "Curadka stood among a crowd of Yetis, Kohrak by his right side and Raacsan by his left. It was strange for a king to need bodyguards so close to him; whispers of weakness spread among the crowd. As if unaware of it all or simply uncaring, the frail yeti started to speak.\n\n"Many of you may not have heard from me before and doubt my abilities. That is all fine." Curadka smiled, warm and content. "In the past leadership was decided by just being on top; all that mattered was strength and a crown. I do not wish to be another Storm King; in fact, I wish to be no King at all." As murmurs grew louder, the large yeti by his right seemed to steel himself for conflict, only to be dissuaded by a hand upon his shoulder. "I wish to be one you can choose to follow, to prove myself to all creatures, to prove Yetikind is not defined by blood and violence, but it can be free to choose another path." Kohrak seemed to relax his grip, the crowd's rage fading into a murmur.\n\n"Our kind has long been despised as warmongers, hated and feared... I was not exempt from such prejudice." The hyena by his left grew uncomfortable, until a cautious hand was placed on his shoulder. "But I learned that any creature can change. That all have the right to live and love. 'Grant your fellow creature the chance to enjoy comforts they have never known.' This excerpt from the Crystal Sutra, proselytized by a hyena with hope in their eyes touched my heart. Although I am no dervish, it taught me we have much to learn from others, to love our neighbour as our own kin." A smile grew on Raacsan's face.\n\n"I beg of you not to follow blindly, but to hope—as that Hyena once did, as I do now, and as I truly believe all of yetikind may one day hope. Not for want or war, but simple peace. I thank you all for listening." As Curadka left his podium alongside his companions, the crowd was not taken by fervor or passion, but by a much more complex feeling: quiet contemplation. Not a murmur or whisper could be heard."

Was this truly the agitator who stirred the entire Mandate under his banner, with an army that'd ride or die for him? "Curadka," Agajolexi began, "let's be straightforward today: You are very bold to ask of us to join your country when it wasn't long ago that we have been ravaged by your fellow creatures."\n\n"Is it wrong for me to be bold?" Curadka even sounded naive! "Bold as it may be, it is but a request. You are free to decline."\n\nThe opportunity to just opt out stunned the high-ranking zebras. Ibutuzam worried about the lack of statecraftship Curadka seemed to be showing. It was almost pitiable. He had to give him a bone. "We can't decline a request we haven't fully heard of. What is it?"\n\nHe laid out his hands, stretched them out bare for the both of them to see the extent of his sincerity. "A confederation of equals. In eliminating the borders between us—both literal and not—we can come to each other's aid. The Uzerasis will lead as co-rulers. From there, it is up to you to excel not only in skill but in morality which I believe you will... you will certainly have an easier time than those of us with a much more violent past." If anything, his finishing smile was disarming.\n\n"You are sincere," Agajolexi surmised. A tinge of horror, a tincture of relief. "Naive? Not when your words are backed by a thousand weapons, but you are mercifully straightforward." A nod from Ibutuzam was all he needed to continue. "You must know that what you are asking is a very tall order, so we will need your co-operation. I must warn you, this will not be easy to fulfill.""

Our golden age began at the start of the millennium, and it will last thousands of years more! \n\n"Some among us - perhaps those of you who scare easy - may think that we, the indomitable yetis, cannot hope to fight against the Pact and their puppets. 'After all,' they say, 'we lost to them before, and now we are just an island!' Of course, they forget small important details.

Inconsistent training regimens, substandard airship materials, a few tactical blunders - many yetis in the crowd were frowning, confused by their leader’s sudden change in style, but others smirked, sensing an approaching punchline. After half a minute, however, Kravash's speech suddenly flipped from beige prose to a furious roar.\n\n"...AND OUR LEADERS WERE WEAK, SNIVELLING TRAITORS!

The company, or rather the group of designers loosely organised under her command, had just one more week to present their project for Kravash's approval. It had been, in her opinion, the most enjoyable nightmare of her life. The team was busy almost all the time, and the stress was clearly getting to some of them, but the complete lack of regulations or even bullet points as to what the vehicle should do was wonderfully liberating. She and the team could flex their full engineering creativity. \n\nThe blueprints of what the others had taken to calling 'Mister Sputter' were likely indecipherable to outsiders and as a whole were extremely messy. But it worked. Well, the blueprints did, everyone on the team could read them, and she hoped Mister Sputter would be the same. What a handsome chap the thing was - Clawbeak suspension on a half-track, modular armouring and a massive engine visible to any passengers. With part of the engine's cover taken off you could cook marshmallows on it. Probably. Above the cab was a big question mark, as the team hadn't decided what to put there. Glyd herself had suggested a good old machine gun, but others had swayed her with anti-tank guns, grenade launchers and even rocket launchers. Mister Sputter was a mess of wacky ideas, and it was beautiful. Neither Glyd nor the team were daft enough to believe that this was the most effective APC they could build, but that was hardly the point. It was good enough. \n\n Ah, 'good enough'. What an amazing pair of words. This vehicle would be noisy, ugly and unreliable, but it would pass Kravash's sniff test with flying colours. Part of her worried about the poor field mechanics who would constantly be needed to fix the damn things, but another part of her knew just how popular it would be with the troops, what with all its toys and barbaric charm. It was far from the best thing she'd made, but this one had a bit of her soul in it. Tired but happy, she picked up the paper, gave it a smooch, then carried it into the next room."

##Initial Tree##

EYE_pack_your_bags:0 "Pack Your Bags"
EYE_pack_your_bags_desc:0 ""EMERGENCY ADVISORY TO ALL PACT PERSONNEL: The situation is untenable. Evacuate the island immediately. Should the Mandate be dissolved, YOU WILL BE ON YOUR OWN.""

EYE_fight_for_your_futures_desc:0 ""
EYE_kill_for_your_past:0 "Kill For Your Past"
EYE_kill_for_your_past_desc:0 "The records show that the height of yeti nature is the will to power, to discharge that power upon others. Kravash Thundercrusher and his hyper-reactionary clique echo these bygone sentiments, though perhaps not as eloquently."
EYE_all_thats_been_stolen:0 "All That's Been Stolen"
EYE_all_thats_been_stolen_desc:0 "Our land, our rights, our identity: no matter which way you cut it, the Pact have stripped us of these core traits, without which we may as well be aimless drifters in the seven seas. We must reclaim them."
EYE_all_weve_been_given:0 "All We've Been Given"
EYE_all_weve_been_given_desc:0 ""
EYE_all_well_take_back:0 "All We'll Take Back"
EYE_all_well_take_back_desc:0 "The foreigners' "kind hearts" are a thin veneer to mask their thirst to pillage and vanquish; their promises of liberty, a meagre excuse to hack away at the very idea of yetidom. This humiliation will not stand."
EYE_new_friends:0 "New Friends"
EYE_new_friends_desc:0 ""
EYE_new_masters:0 "New Masters"
EYE_new_masters_desc:0 "How the mighty have fallen! Are we truly sons of the Storm King if we were so easily cowed by a pack of dogs and devils? Let them know, let the whole world know: this "Mandate" is under new management."
EYE_cut_off_their_exits:0 "Cut Off Their Exits"

EYE_dont_let_them_escape_desc:0 "The monsters turn tail, and the slave-minded seek to flee with them! We'll fight them if they get away, so rev up the trucks and put the cages in the back: time to restart our ancient tradition of slavery!"
EYE_chase_away_what_remains:0 "Chase Away What Remains"
EYE_chase_away_what_remains_desc:0 ""
EYE_shoot_to_kill:0 "Shoot To Kill"
EYE_shoot_to_kill_desc:0 "Apparently, we don't have enough cages and we don't have enough shelters to store as many indentured servants we need. Shoot the rest, both the Pact and the "yetis" too scared to stand on the right side of history."
EYE_to_right_what_is_wrong:0 "To Right What Is Wrong"
EYE_to_right_what_is_wrong_desc:0 ""

##Curadka's Tree##

EYE_the_call_of_tomorrow:0 "The Call Of Tomorrow"

EYE_back_from_the_brink:0 "Back From The Brink"
EYE_back_from_the_brink_desc:0 "Our economy is in tatters. To make up for all the damage that's been done, new workshops and factories will be propped up wherever possible to breathe some life into our society."

EYE_prosperity_from_within_desc:0 ""
EYE_master_the_basics:0 "Master The Basics"
EYE_master_the_basics_desc:0 "We cannot jump the gun and rush for advanced technologies before first perfecting what's already been made. Simple studies on contemporary techniques are what is required right now; the futurism can come later."
EYE_construct_a_stable_present:0 "Construct A Stable Present"
EYE_construct_a_stable_present_desc:0 "Can we claim to strive for a perfect future if we abandon the present? Of course not. Tomorrow cannot come without today, and so today shall be made as worthwhile as possible."
EYE_our_greatest_minds:0 "Our Greatest Minds"
EYE_our_greatest_minds_desc:0 "Many of the Eye's most brilliant yetis have been abandoned by the Mandate and the devastation its corpse left behind. Let us find these lumps of coal, that they might be turned into diamonds."
EYE_faded_scars:0 "Faded Scars"
EYE_faded_scars_desc:0 "After so long in a slump, things seem to finally be looking up. Unemployment is at an all-time low and poverty is at a minimum. Let's keep this upward trend going for a long, long time."
EYE_stormlands_quality_assured:0 "Chidhoruban Quality Assured"
EYE_stormlands_quality_assured_desc:0 "What shall the creatures of Chidhoru be known for? For their loyalty, their devotion, their beauty? No, they'll be known for making the best damn luxury goods you've ever had the pleasure of laying eyes on, that's what!"
EYE_an_economy_for_the_ages:0 "An Economy For The Ages"
EYE_an_economy_for_the_ages_desc:0 "Genius that he is, Curadka has thought of a way for collectivism to be perfected without disrupting all that's been built. A two-layer economy, with small private businesses allowed and large state-owned properties existing alongside each other."
EYE_cultivation_of_the_mind:0 "Cultivation Of The Mind"
EYE_cultivation_of_the_mind_desc:0 "Cheap words and fiery speeches are not enough to unchain the minds of the citizens. While few may care for philosophy and other less-than-tangible aspects of higher learning, some watered down versions of these topics can help the average yeti think about the world on a deeper level."
EYE_return_to_the_mainland:0 "Return To The Mainland"
EYE_return_to_the_mainland_desc:0 "The rule of bandits and petty warlordism must come to an end. Curadka has rid the Eye of their kind, and now he will do the same to the mainland. Our time of exile is over!"
EYE_enrichment_of_the_soul:0 "Enrichment Of The Soul"
EYE_enrichment_of_the_soul_desc:0 "There can be no point to liberation if the citizens of the new regime are not fulfilled. Aid from the state will help to revitalize entertainment and recreation, giving people tangible evidence of the benevolence and wisdom of their new ruler."
EYE_stormlander_futurism:0 "Stormlander Futurism"
EYE_stormlander_futurism_desc:0 "The Stormland isle is experiencing an explosion of culture and science never before seen. An artistic style merging aspirations of the future with abstract imagery has emerged, bringing everything it touches to life."
EYE_meet_with_the_family:0 "Meet With The Family"
EYE_meet_with_the_family_desc:0 "The most important part of Curadka's vision for the future lies with reintegration of the zebras of the land. The first step begins here, with the Uzerasi. If he can convince them to peacefully join us it could be the key to success."
EYE_teach_them_the_way:0 "Teach Them The Way"
EYE_teach_them_the_way_desc:0 "The disease has been removed, but its stain still lingers. Pillaged towns, emptied vaults, and refugees still mark the land. We must show the yetis of the Windborn region that life is better with us than without."
EYE_faults_of_the_past:0 "Faults Of The Past"
EYE_faults_of_the_past_desc:0 "To look upon the past is to see failure. All previous leaders of the Rainband failed in nearly every aspect, even in war. Their failures have led to the current situation of chaos and disunity. Curadka will be different - he has to be."
EYE_architectural_renewal:0 "Architectural Renewal"
EYE_architectural_renewal_desc:0 "The unique style now iconic of the Stormland isle should be brought to the rest of the rainband. Embedding new buildings and public places with elements from this style will tell everyone that the future is here!"
EYE_from_on_high:0 "From On High"
EYE_from_on_high_desc:0 "The oligarchs and chiefdoms of these new microstates can never stand up to the might of a greater power. It's only a matter of time until someone comes for them - it may as well be us. We're sure to be better to them than anyone else would be, anyways."
EYE_consent_of_the_governed:0 "Consent Of The Governed"
EYE_consent_of_the_governed_desc:0 "Curadka is no autocrat, despite the power he wields. By opening the door to those failed by past regimes the state will solidify and bring security from within. It will also allow Curadka to begin his grand project in earnest…"
EYE_negotiate_for_the_buffer:0 "''Negotiate'' For The Valley"
EYE_negotiate_for_the_buffer_desc:0 "Despite our leader's respect for the dervishes of Hyenia, the sword must come down on the monarchs they've sold themselves to. They will come to regret their hubris, and the people of Stormcloud will be reunited with their brethren once again."
EYE_mechanized_to_perfection:0 "Mechanized To Perfection"
EYE_mechanized_to_perfection_desc:0 "For the sake of our future, food scarcity must be permanently eliminated. With broad implementation of cutting-edge technology, our farms will yield quantities unthinkable just a decade ago. Hunger will become a thing of the past!"
EYE_enlightened_collectivism:0 "Enlightened Collectivism"
EYE_enlightened_collectivism_desc:0 "The working yetis and zebras must not be forgotten on our march to the future, for they are the lifeblood of civilization. They should take in the wealth they create, as the oligarchs and kings of the past once did, as the primary beneficiaries of the nation."
EYE_hoof_to_hand:0 "Hoof To Hand"
EYE_hoof_to_hand_desc:0 "To hate another's race is to be stuck in the past. The distrust between zebras and yetis ends here and now. We are friends, neighbours, and family. No more shall there be a divide between us!"
EYE_new_state_apparatus:0 "New State Apparatus"
EYE_new_state_apparatus_desc:0 "Over three million creatures live in the Stormcloud Valley, and they have been treated like pawns to be taken advantage of without any concern. We will make sure they are cared for, not left to the wolves like those before."
EYE_culture_shock:0 "Culture Shock"
EYE_culture_shock_desc:0 "We cannot exist as a unified society while many still think of anyone outside of their immediate circle as ‘’the other.’’ There will be coexistence and mutual understanding amongst our citizens, whether they want it or not."
EYE_two_becomes_one:0 "Two Becomes One"
EYE_two_becomes_one_desc:0 "It's time for the next step. To not just erase distrust but the very lines between races has never been done before, but how could it if it's never been tried? From now on, we will never again be anything other than two halves of one whole."
EYE_nationalist_ideals:0 "Nationalist Ideals"
EYE_nationalist_ideals_desc:0 "The concept of Chidhoru is amorphous and vague to anyone outside of Curadka's direct circle. It's time to change that. Chidhoru is a nation, a state, a place, and a people, not just an idea."
EYE_secure_the_future:0 "Secure The Future"
EYE_secure_the_future_desc:0 "With all other threats taken care of, our gaze falls to the north. The zebras of the lakes have been taken for a ride by a number of tyrants and false liberators. It's time to set the record straight and secure the future - *our* future."
EYE_from_the_ground_up:0 "From The Ground Up"
EYE_from_the_ground_up_desc:0 "For all his many strengths, the one thing Curadka knows nothing of is war. But he shall learn, and his knowledge will not be tainted by errors of the past, no - his expertise shall be built from the ground up. He might need some help to get there, though."
EYE_what_they_got_right:0 "What They Got Right"
EYE_what_they_got_right_desc:0 "Despite the many faults of the Storm King and his wannabe successors, the one thing they nailed was technological superiority. The grit and perseverance of a foe just cannot best a hulking metal vehicle with a cannon."
EYE_all_for_his_vision:0 "All For His Vision"
EYE_all_for_his_vision_desc:0 ""
EYE_sciences_of_the_future:0 "Sciences Of The Future"

EYE_the_broken_dream:0 "The Broken Dream"
EYE_the_broken_dream_desc:0 "The great nation of Ugabi is no more, but it's people remain. Directionless and without purpose, we can take them by the hoof and show them all the path forward."
EYE_fly_the_banner:0 "Fly The Banner"
EYE_fly_the_banner_desc:0 "While Chidhoru does encompass the southernmost parts of the Great Lakes, we do not seek to subjugate the remainder of the region. Let us work with them rather than against them."
EYE_brothers_and_sisters:0 "Brothers And Sisters"
EYE_brothers_and_sisters_desc:0 "The Hayzeb are no strangers to us. We have already welcomed millions of Hayzeb zebras into Chidhoru, and the rest will follow - even if they have to be persuaded a bit harsher than their southern family."
EYE_in_with_the_old:0 "In With The Old"
EYE_in_with_the_old_desc:0 "An uncivilized yeti would insist that the powerful zebras of the past should be thrown in jail or even executed, but Curadka is anything but. He knows how to get the rich and powerful to think like him, and he can do it again."
EYE_show_of_unity:0 "Show Of Unity"
EYE_show_of_unity_desc:0 "How can we show our new Chidhoruban citizens that we only want what's best for them? Parades, letters to influential leaders, perhaps a tax break or two? Why not try it all?"
EYE_center_of_governance:0 "Center Of Society"
EYE_center_of_governance_desc:0 "Now that our internal borders are as safe as they've ever been, we can finally think of relocating the capital. The Eye is a relic, not fit for the center of Chidhoruban society. Let's shift focus away from it for good."
EYE_no_master_but_one:0 "No Master But One"
EYE_no_master_but_one_desc:0 "There are many Hayzeb zebras that seem to be under the impression that Curadka is just like all the rest: an autocrat who respects no other power. Let's show them how wrong they are!"
EYE_chiefs_to_mayors:0 "Chiefs To Mayors"
EYE_chiefs_to_mayors_desc:0 "There's no reason to remove all the talented creatures already leading small villages and towns, but the position they hold has to be kept up with modern standards. Some renovations are certainly in order!"
EYE_chat_with_the_guerillas:0 "Chat With The Guerillas"
EYE_chat_with_the_guerillas_desc:0 "Some Mozzi rabble have taken up arms and refuse to integrate into Chidhoruban society. This doesn't mean they're enemies, necessarily. Let's see what they have to say before making our move."
EYE_protect_our_interests:0 "Protect Our Interests"
EYE_protect_our_interests_desc:0 "Despite our many victories, there are still things our great nation lacks. Security, for one. The horses to the west reek of the past - let's put their names in the history books where they belong."
EYE_cut_away_the_vestiges:0 "Cut Away The Vestiges"
EYE_cut_away_the_vestiges_desc:0 "The blight upon our army some call ''Gel Frostwind'' has been left to his own devices for too long. He was needed when our Great Leader needed any ally he could get, but he has served his purpose. It's time to take out the trash."

EYE_we_have_but_one_life_desc:0 "All this struggle, all this pain… is it worth it? To bite the hand that feeds you, over and over again? Let us show you that it's not worth wasting your time over. You only have one life, don't waste it fighting for a dead nation."
EYE_doorway_into_arabia:0 "Doorway Into Saddle Arabia"
EYE_doorway_into_arabia_desc:0 "Now that our most precarious border is secured, we can establish our own government there that is more amenable to Chidhoruban interests. Oh, and let's not forget to keep a piece for ourselves."
EYE_our_last_enemy:0 "Our Last Enemy"
EYE_our_last_enemy_desc:0 "None quite embody the ways of old like the Hestrayans. Savage tribes of horse warriors and crumbling dynasties of ponies are all that populate the peninsula. Let us bring them into the future, for their sake more than ours."
EYE_hestrayan_renovation:0 "Hestrayan Renovation"
EYE_hestrayan_renovation_desc:0 "Perhaps the best lesson we can teach the Hestrayans is that racial unity is not just possible, it's preferable. For the first time, they will be united under one banner. They can thank us later."
EYE_freedom_worth_living_for:0 "Freedom Worth Living For"
EYE_freedom_worth_living_for_desc:0 "Freedom! The poor sods think they ever truly had it. Sometimes adequate teaching requires repetition. Let us show that the life they live under our great leader is the best they have ever had, and the best they ever will have."
EYE_arms_of_authority:0 "Arms Of Authority"

EYE_a_legacy_to_be_proud_of_desc:0 "Chidhoru stands tall. Curadka has overcome all obstacles that came his way, and now the results of his labor have come to fruition. A nation, a people, a unified identity. A legacy that will stand the test of time."

# Copy and paste!
#mandate_anarchy.1.t:
#mandate_anarchy.1.d:
#mandate_anarchy.1.a:


mandate_anarchy.1.t:0 "Forget About Free Mandates"
mandate_anarchy.1.d:0 "No amount of ragged suits or broken glasses could hide the fact that Waqooyi was a hyena, which had lately turned into a death sentence.  Huddled in the last cramped bus for the foreseeable future, hiding in a circle of fleeing yetis, stoked dread within and the few gargoyles and centaurs coming along on the bumpy ride to the port. There would be found the fiendishly overcrowded piers with ships pressing passengers in like sardines in a can. Blend into the chaos: that was Waqooyi's plan.\n\nThe bus soon rolled past destroyed bricks and arches. Apart from the main thoroughfares, nearly every street was empty, seemingly abandoned, with empty security stations bearing the Pact's emblems but none of their personnel.\n\nEars pierced, cracked glass flying out the windows, the force shoving him down under the weight of a dozen busmates. Muffled shouting up front preceded the dull thuds of kicks and punches. Foreign yelling houting signalled the vehicle's new management. A gargoyle translated things to Waqooyi in a whisper: bandits, seeing if they were hiding treasure underneath the seats and in the engine. Paws tore away the fallen bodies that kept him a secret.\n\nA pull, a shot, the bandit leader down, Waqooyi's pistol smoking. His legs moved on their own. Sped past the trail of fellow escapees cowering for cover behind broken windows. Bullets had concrete flying; their whistling through the air welcomed the wailing of a city-wide alarm.\n\nFrom the roadblock ahead, several yeti heads pop up, guns across their chests, pointed at Waqooyi locked in a panicked refugee stampede."
mandate_anarchy.1.a:0 "Beyond, over screaming alarms, the port gates began to close."

mandate_anarchy.2.t:0 "His Face"
mandate_anarchy.2.d:0 "Upon the crags flew a tattered Storm King flag and a hope nearly erased. Furred hands lofted it high, a beacon of remembrance, of who they once were.\n\nTheir sacred home, their home isle, a defiled cage whose iron bars twisted into the forms of the outsiders who had whispered, "This is what your thousands of slaves felt like!" So much for a considerate police force, confiscating books, breaking weapons in two, incinerating Storm King merchandise to burn away any sense of self and dignity. A prison island this was, of containment and no rehabilitation. No hope.\n\nGraffitied slogans painted the numbers of a debt they could not pay, the inmates running free. Banners of the Storm King's face unfurled from the towers about a time they could say they were one, the jailed ones waving flags of liberation. Images of Pact brutality rained from the balconies, of yetis herded around like cattle to designated areas. The unshackled and the unchained streamed through dirt paths and paved avenues, converging at the city's centre.\n\nTreacherous terrain bogged down their march. The remaining Pact battalions were ordered to hold the governmental palace at all costs. The thousand-strong crowd was slow but armed, slow but determined, slow yet never stopping for anyone nor anything.\n\nFrom the arches and the rooftops, if only for a day, the yeti who could not be named, the censored creature, the Storm King—his face blessed the skies, shining upon the land with one core memory:"
mandate_anarchy.2.a:0 "That they shall be divided and broken no more."

mandate_anarchy.7.t:0 "Return Stroke"
mandate_anarchy.7.d:0 "His sophisticated scent announced his presence to the crowded, smelly plaza. It had been difficult, cleaning the stench of the fighting out, so for this occasion, he'd taken a suit and some stolen cologne to stand out before he even appeared. By the platform, with a dozen banners of his face and the Storm King's old flag flying true, he needed not any gesture for them to turn to him.\n\n"Today!" he boomed, with a rifle held high. He savoured in the moment, already many vying for him. "Yes, you all! Today is a glorious occasion." A great banner unfurled behind him, showing off the old King's smug visage. Eruptions of applause struck him with pride. "But enough talk! Let's have at them, like the Storm King would've wished!"\n\nHe hopped off the stage, picked up a rifle, and his side of the city followed in a disorganised procession through the streets. The Storm King's face, hung on large cheap fabric, signalled their arrival to every major corner, the loud orator crying out, "How shall we be strong? Like the Storm King! How shall we be free? Like the Storm King! And how shall we regain our trampled down glory as the old lords of Zebrica? Like the Storm King!"\n\nHe never said his name. Word would spread either way, of a single Kravash pulling every disheartened yeti back on their feet and into his fast expanding march of armed adherents, of a single Kravash scaring away the Pact peacekeepers with a simple phrase:"
mandate_anarchy.7.a:0 "Like the Storm King!"

mandate_anarchy.9.t:0 "To be a Successor"
mandate_anarchy.9.d:0 "Their final base, up in flames. Dancing in the smoulders, Kohrak had been trading punches with Kravash, the latter's soldiers hooting and waving pictures of their dear leader. He'd chipped away at Kohrak's territory, swooping in like a thief in the night; by the time Kohrak was on their way, he would receive the news: too late, everyone was routed, retreat and recover. Kravash's lightning-fast speed never wavered, his influence never waning until the last, until the melee Kohrak found themselves unable to win.\n\nWhen they first saw Kohrak, his loud and brash reputation had preceded him. Here was a yeti who shouted and beat his chest at everything and everyone then expected the whole world to blindly follow along. Crude and crass was he... leading the charge, staying by his warriors' side, doing the dirty and dangerous work of fighting on the ground. Just like the Storm King: leading a great raid to eclipse all others, streaking through the continent, taking on the noble death of a fighter by the mystical hippogriffs. None of these lily-livered "successors" who sat on their thrones all day while sibling killed sibling hundreds of miles away.\n\nThe action stopped. The rowdy cheers disappeared into the crackling of burning homes. The automatic movement of their fists had vanished. Kravash's fist had given way to an open palm. "It's a waste to kill off good talent. The Storm King would've been proud of you. You now to get help me retake everything we've lost. But first, you need to work on those muscles. My rougher boys'll make fun of scrawny you."
mandate_anarchy.9.a:0 "A raw, unfiltered Storm King in the making, then, they'll serve."

mandate_anarchy.11.t:0 "It's a Party in the M.o.E."
mandate_anarchy.11.d:0 "The next stopping point for Kikru and his clique of armed gangsters that could be inaccurately called a regiment: some coastal settlement with a small port, one of the last exits to the Zebrican mainlands. Kravash had told him to crash the party on top of some strategic objectives. Details didn't matter; Kravash's promise did: the return of everything the Storm King gained.\n\nThe days-long celebration was pockmarked by bullets and shells cutting the air in their name. He fired several pistols to the sky, getting opposing forces wondering and the non-combatants fleeing. The other city factions discovered their buildings melting into rubble without discrimination and at the slightest provocation. This was interspersed by lunch breaks, where Kikru's underlings swapped stolen guns and ordinances, decoarting them with paints and markers to truly "own" their weapons and to guess how much they could sell these "designer skins" for cold hard cash. This proved to be good small talk over shackling the non-yetis and herding them into cages.\n\nThe city would fall into Kikru's paws by the third night, which called for a feast. Every structure that survived was their home, their base, their multi-storey dining hall draped over with Kravash's flag and likeness. Bonfires lit the place like a true inferno, fuelled by useless junk like carpets and paintings, their comfy crackling a soundscape to verbal contests over who had the most kills. The last night ended with blood sport, martial arts of the near lethal variety, their sparring forms casting sharp wall-sized shadows from the flames.\n\nKikru sat back and drank some well-needed beer, seated on a pile of wood shavings and bullets: a throne of gunpowder."
mandate_anarchy.11.a:0 "I get paid to shoot 'em up!"

mandate_anarchy.13.t:0 "A Voluntary Culling"
mandate_anarchy.13.d:0 "Waqooyi had bided his time in an abandoned wharf within Tempest Shores, escaping notice by the area's decrepit appearance, a working radio station of amateur proportions. The Pact's remnants found here, disguised as wandering fishercreatures, spoke of a treacherous trip to historically Karkadannistani lands or beyond.\n\nThe transmissions he could pick up painted the lightning-fast take-over of the island with the broad and rough strokes of Kravash's crass ideas. "Yetis of all stripes,"  the madyeti had been heard through crackling speakers, "tonight, another wayward band of brigands has been shooed out, leaving us lands that were never theirs! Starting tomorrow, to all the freed slaves that used to be under those unworthy pirates, you will be make yourselves useful! Lend us your muscle, your strength and might! Our taskmasters should be more than competent to lead you, but if they show weakness? Revolt! Become the taskmaster! That's how the Storm King wanted it! His slaves were slaves that thought for themselves, produced great ideas and proved them by the fist! So be the greatest slave you can be for us!..."\n\nThis and other madnesses, Waqooyi turned off with a turn of the knob, rubbing his eyes and groaning into his paws. A child-let with an army of his own was a volatile mix. A petulant wannabe impressed by duels and weightlifting, the yeti set to restore order here, no matter how fatal that "order" would end up being?\n\n"Come in," cracked another radio. "Ready the boats. Yeti vehicles coming our way." Reflection upon some loudmouth restarting the Storm King's reign could come some other time. Waqooyi took his bags, unplugged the radio sets, then took off to a once-marooned boat."
mandate_anarchy.13.a:0 "Might makes right and rightfully makes refugees."

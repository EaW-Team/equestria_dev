 colthage_other.999.d:0 "The pony's strength was gone for days afterwards. He could barely stay conscious and was carried along as he was no longer able to stand. Only hazy memories remained of that time. He remembered descending down and screaming in agony. The Sun being raised and lowered, the same being done with the Moon afterwards. Stars swirling. A train, a ship, a caravan. Heat and cold. Dark and light. All mixed together in his mind into dull darkness and gloomy orange. The Eye looked upon him.\n\nHe was back in the ruins. They had brought him there without him even realizing. It explained the heat. It had been so long, yet he could still recognize the monoliths of dark stone, which now seemed oddly ominous and terrifying. He was carried deep within the ruins, to a familiar room.\n\n"The tomb is a lie," the familiar donkey guide said to him. "He who never died needs no tomb. No, this is an altar."\n\nIt became dark as the sun set once more. "The alignment is about to commence!" Giles shouted. "Prepare the ritual!"\n\nThe bell tolled. The pony was placed upon a slab. The occultist drew out a curved knife. Bleating began. The bell tolled. The knife entered the pony's chest. He had no strength to scream. Blood spilled everywhere as the heart was pulled out. The bell tolled. The occultist consumed the heart. The bell tolled. The stars aligned. The Eye watched.\n\nRuins began to shift and change. Dunes began to vanish. Fallen pillars stood again. Collapsed roofs repaired themselves. §RTAMBELON§! had returned to the primary dimension, after being banished for so long. The Father smiled as His summoners prostrated themselves before His presence and offered Him the Bewitching Bell."

SON_zonni_zolon:0 "Zonni Zolon"
SON_zonni_desc:0 "Zonni Zolon is a scion of a minor aristocratic family that was never particularly influential in Zar-Hay. During the years of Mazwian rule, the family developed a negative reputation of collaboration with the oppressors, and Zonni's father even married a Mazwian mare. Zonni has carried this burden of shame his entire life and has done everything he could to prove he was a true Zar-Hay zebra. He rallied disgruntled warriors and staged an uprising against Mazwian rule as news arrived of Storm King's victory in the south. He proved to be an astute strategist and drove off the Mazwian garrison with minimal casualties. Afterwards he was hailed as a hero by the common castes, yet the tribal chiefs distrusted him still. As it seemed Zonni needed to do more to earn their respect, he accepted the title of Regent and intends to lead his tribe to greatness. Once he has vanquished all the enemies of Zar-Hay, perhaps the Zolon family will finally be redeemed."

SON_azkhai_zughe:0 "Azkhai Zughe"
SON_nyaberi_zargey:0 "Nyaberi Zargey"

SON_azkhai_desc:0 "The Zughe family, once the rulers of Zar-Hay, were kept hostage in Ziani for many generations. They were allowed to live peacefully in relatively good conditions, but were forbidden from ever leaving the capital of the Imperial Mazwi. Therefore ever since Azkhai was a young colt, his world was small, not extending beyond the heavily guarded walls of his home.\n\nEverything changed when the Storm King attacked.\n\nAzkhai had grown into a wise stallion of respectable age, eager to get out of the glorified prison and return to his true homeland. When Ziani burned, he saw his opportunity to escape. As his home was left unguarded, he escorted his family through a burning city, evading the pillaging yeti warriors and escaping to the countryside with the help of Euzegoar of Alwani, who had also been kept hostage. He finally entered the wider world, leading his family on a dangerous journey to a safe haven in Re'em which openly welcomed refugees from the collapsing Mazwi Empire.\n\nOnce his family had a safe home in Re'em, Azkhai prepared to return to Zar-Hay and claim his rightful throne. However, he heard of the ambitions of the half-Mazwian Regent, who he did not trust in the slightest. Therefore he chose to be more cunning, remaining in hiding until the time was right and gathering support from warriors and commoners alike. Eventually, he finally revealed himself, ready to embrace his destiny."
SON_nyaberi_desc:0 "Nyaberi was born to a family of merchants, and thus her fate was chosen at birth, as was tradition in Zar-Hay. However, Nyaberi soon realized other zebras looked down upon her due to merchants being outcasts in the Zar-Hay caste system. When she was old enough to go on trading missions by herself, she travelled further and further away from her repressive and traditionalist home.\n\nInevitably she visited places that were far more technologically and societally advanced than anywhere she had been before. She saw the astounding wonders of modernity, the towering buildings and the speed of the cars. Here she also learned about exotic political ideas which did not exist in her backwards homeland, which inspired her to formulate a radical ideology of her own.\n\nOnce she returned home, she immediately started making contacts and using her profits from trade missions to establish a domestic revolutionary movement that was loyal to her. One way or another, she would fulfill her fantasies of a utopia unchained by traditions and hierarchies."

Eventually, she used it to overthrow the old and corrupt government and usher in a new age of revolutionary change. She used the state itself as a tool to forcefully modernize all of the Great Lakes, then discarded it when it was no longer necessary. Now her own utopia has become a reality: a society ruled by the merchants, where any zebra can become rich."
SON_dongo_desc:0 "Once, Zanda Dongo was nothing more than a common peasant. His family owned a small amount of land, enough to make a living, and it seemed like he would inherit the farm once he grew older. However, as he aged he developed a volatile personality, lashing out at everyone around him. He often lost his temper and became violent. Soon enough his family grew weary of his antics decided to kick him out. Now being alone, Zanda Dongo felt lost, and wandered the countryside, getting into fights with random strangers. But one of these strangers was a warrior in the army of Zar-Hay, who was impressed by his ferocity. She recommended Zanda to her superior, who accepted Zanda into the ranks of his company. It did not take much time for Zanda to become a distinguished and brave combatant who channelled his inner anger at the enemy. He rose through the ranks and inevitably became a general of the Imperial Army."
SON_zuwa_meynsata_desc:0 "Over the years, Meynsata became Zonni's trusted right hoof mare, advising him in important matters and aiding him on the battlefield. As such, it was not surprising that she became Zonni's successor. However, she did not expect it herself. She is first and foremost a warrior, not a ruler, so she feels uncertain if she is ready to take up the mantle of Zuwa. Only time will tell if she will be able to keep the Imperial Realm of Zar-Hay intact."

SON_famed_griot:0 "Fassa Balleke"
SON_famed_griot_desc:0 "The Balleke family had once served the Zar-Hay kings and queens as court griots, yet after the Mazwian subjugation they had no choice but to go into exile, becoming wandering entertainers. The youngest scion of the family, Fassa Balleke, has now returned to her homeland to serve in the court once more. She is a talented molo player and has fully memorized the most important Zar-Hay mythologies and historical records. She has proven to be quite popular, and oftentimes commoners gather outside the palace to listen to her performances."
SON_chief_quaggo:0 "Chief Quaggo"
SON_chief_quaggo_desc:0 "Quaggo is the most prominent chief of Zairbanda. His family is old and respected, surviving Mazwian rule mostly intact despite harbouring deep hatred for the foreign overlords. While they have lost much of their wealth and power over the years, their prestige remains high and thus Quaggo's voice has more weight than that of most chieftains. Quaggo himself is known to be paranoid of foreigners and is especially distrustful of Zonni Zolon, the half-Mazwian regent. He eagerly anticipates the return of the rightful pure-blooded King to the throne of Zar-Hay."
SON_chieftess_amzina:0 "Chieftess Amzina"
SON_chieftess_amzina_desc:0 "Coming from the Anzongo tribe, Amzina's family rose from obscurity in recent decades thanks to savvy trade policies which made them exceptionally prosperous. Unlike more conservative tribes who remain stuck in the past, Amzina and her relatives have embraced change and rapidly adapted. Now Anzongo, once a rural province, has thriving proto-industry mostly thanks to cooperation with the local Re'emite minority. Amzina has ensured the Neighle trade route remains secure, her war canoes patrolling the waterways and gathering lucrative tolls from merchants in return."
SON_chief_faran:0 "Chief Faran"
SON_chief_faran_desc:0 "Chief Faran of Zarabara is the son of a powerful sorcerer and has followed in his hoofsteps. While his tribe is rather poor, he is still honoured as a skilled potion brewer and a master of the arcane arts. Little is known about him as he lets his deeds speak on his behalf. It is a mixture of both fear and respect that makes Faran a very influential zebra in Zar-Hay."
SON_reemite_advisor:0 "Yaniv Litzhol"
SON_general_zanda:0 "Zanda Dongo"
SON_ndebi_political:0 "Fari Ndebi"
SON_ndebi_political_desc:0 "Ndebi is the Fari, commander, of the Royal Army of Zar-Hay, and was one of the leaders of the revolt against the Mazwians. Unfortunately, his accomplishments were entirely shadowed by Zonni Zolon, who received all the credit for "saving" Zar-Hay. Despite being disgruntled by this, Ndebi is still willing to fulfill his duties faithfully. He is a grizzled veteran, having formerly served in the army of the Imperial Mazwi, deserting it after it was crushed by the Storm King."

SON_chieftess_meynsata:0 "Chieftess Meynsata"
SON_meynsata_full_name:0 "Meynsata Nyame"
SON_chieftess_meynsata_desc:0 "The Zibiridugu tribe are considered strange in the rest of Zar-Hay, due to their different culture and bizarre dialect. Yet they insist to be proud subjects of Zar-Hay, having been part of the Kingdom for centuries before the rise of Imperial Mazwi. While Mazwi had annexed their lands directly, separating it from Zar-Hay, Chieftess Meynsata led a fearsome resistance to drive out the garrison and reunite with the Kingdom. Meynsata is known to be a capable warrior, having slain many foes with her spear. Zonni Zolon holds particularly deep respect for her abilities."
SON_captain_zaghe:0 "Kan-fari Zage"
SON_captain_zaghe_desc:0 "Zage is the Kan-fari, head of the royal retinue, usually responsible for the safety of the King. When there is no King, it is their duty to guard the Regent instead. Zaghe knows the shame of his predecessors in the past who failed to save Queen of Zar-Hay from becoming a Mazwian hostage, and is determined to redeem the stained honour of his position."
SON_chief_monzon:0 "Baga-Tarkhan Monzon"
SON_chief_monzon_desc:0 "Before the rise of Zekuris, the False Prophet, Monzon's father was the Baga-Tarkhan of Macigena, a local ruler serving the Mazwian Manza. He had tried to stop the inflammatory speeches of Zekuris, but this only resulted in a large uprising which ended in his death. His son, Monzon, managed to escape and organized a small resistance movement against the wrathful zealots. When Zonni Zolon led his armies into Macigena, he welcomed them as liberators and did what he could to aid them, hoping that he could regain control of his father's chiefdom. Indeed, his hopes have been fulfilled and he is now willing to serve the Kingdom - but his loyalty is questionable, as he'd rather be an independent, sovereign ruler than a subject."
SON_zogon:0 "Drillmaster Zogon"
SON_zogon_desc:0 "A harsh zebra, yet only as harsh as it is necessary to be. Zogon is feared by the common soldier and respected by the commanding officers. A former slavemaster, he has plentiful experience from whipping disobedient zebras back into shape. Zonni recognized his skills and realized their usefulness in the military, thus offering him a position in his army."
SON_ndebi:0 "Fari Ndebi"
SON_ndebi_desc:0 "Ndebi is the Fari, commander, of the Royal Army of Zar-Hay and was one of the leaders of the revolt against the Mazwians. Unfortunately, his accomplishments have been entirely overshadowed by Zonni Zolon, who received all the credit for "saving" Zar-Hay. Despite being disgruntled by this, Ndebi is still willing to fulfill his duties faithfully. He is a grizzled veteran, having formerly served in the army of the Imperial Mazwi, deserting it after it was crushed by the Storm King."
SON_foreign_advisor:0 "New Model"
SON_foreign_advisor_desc:0 "New Model is an Equestrian earth pony who once served in the Royal Guard. She was always looking for improvements in the armed forces of her homeland, but quickly learned how hesitant Equestrians were about any kind of radical change. Her proposals for drastic changes to the army were rejected, which left her disillusioned. She resigned from the Guard and began travelling around the world, offering her services as a military advisor. Perhaps other countries would see the value of reformation in this age of rapid technological development."

SON_commie_general_1:0 "Zaberi Ganji"
SON_commie_general_1_desc:0 "Zaberi Ganji was born as a slave in Zar-Hay. Rather than live a life of oppression, he managed to escape and fled to Timbucktu. Now a free zebra, he earned a living by working as a cleaner at the library of the University of Timbucktu. While there, a kind scholar taught him how to read, and Zaberi proved himself to be a quick learner. Soon enough he was promoted to an assistant who spent much of his time reading books, especially political ones that advocated for the creation of an egalitarian society one way or another. Eventually, he became obsessed with the works of Caramel Marks and Fire Angel who theorized that a communist world revolution was inevitable.\n\nAfter Zar-Hay conquered Timbucktu, he fled the city, fearing his former enslavers. He hid in the countryside, doing odd jobs and hauling around his collection of borrowed books. Eventually, he met Nyaberi Zargey, a merchant who wanted to organize a radical revolutionary movement. He decided to help and soon became Nyaberi's right-hoof stallion. He remains a rather orthodox communist who believes that education will empower the masses and create a truly equal society. When the revolution broke out, he was promoted to general not because he had any military skills, but because he was a fervent ideologue who knew how to lead others."

There, he could see the sheer opulence of the Mazwian zebras who adorned themselves with shining gold from the mines of Buckure. As hostages, he and his family were not allowed to partake in this luxury, which made it all the more tempting to the young zebra. Since then, Muza has had an obsession with all golden things. He desires to hoard wealth above anything else, sometimes even resorting to stealing from others, despite his father punishing him whenever he did so.\n\nBesides his greedy streak, Muza is known to be a quiet and reclusive person. He is well educated thanks to his father's efforts and is fond of reading books and scrolls. However, he has little interest in statecraft and, much to his father's dismay, he only wants to become King so he can become richer and acquire more wealth."

Since foalhood, they had a sibling rivalry that was little more than friendly competition. Azkhai and Zin would wrestle, compete in musical contests and pull pranks on the Mazwians. Even after they became adults, they continued to compete. Zin always bragged how she had managed to manipulate the Mazwians in some way, while Azkhai was amused by her lack of literacy.\n\nThings changed after the Storm King attacked and Azkhai decided to lead his family to freedom. While they had been hostages, they had cared little for the fact that Azkhai was older and thus the legitimate claimant to the Zar-Hay throne. But after their escape, a real possibility appeared that Azkhai would become a prestigious King, while Zin would be nothing more than a courtier. The relations between the two soured, and she grew increasingly jealous of her brother as he amassed followers among the Zar-Hay military. In turn, she began making contacts among the chieftains, often secretly travelling away from Re'em without Azkhai's knowledge.\n\nAfter Azkhai accomplished his goals and became the King, Zin began to weave an intricate plot to overthrow him and end their rivalry once and for all, in her complete and final victory."

Neglected in foalhood and left at the mercy of an abusive Mazwian caretaker, he also grew up with some kind of mental illness that made him behave in unusual ways. As a result he was prone to being bullied, ignored or taken advantage of. This made him withdrawn and increasingly bitter at others. He resorted to escapism and religion to cope with his situation. Instead of helping him, his relatives thought of him as the black sheep of the family, further pushing him towards insanity.\n\nWhen the chance to escape Mazwi arrived, Azkhai took all his relatives with him - even Bene. He tagged along, and while living in Re'em claimed to have had a prophetic vision that he was infact an avatar of God who would smite all those who had mocked or abused him. Surprisingly, some actually believed him, or at least humoured him. This growing following only convinced him that his delusions were real, and that he could become King if he wanted to."

SON_harakoy_zughe:0 "Harakoy Zughe"
SON_harakoy_zughe_desc:0 "Harakoy is the oldest daughter of Azkhai, but still younger than his firstborn son, Muza. As such, she never received preferential treatment and wasn't expected to succeed to the throne - that is, until Muza grew up to be a greedy brat. Then Azkhai realized that he had neglected his daughter when she was possibly the only hope for a proper successor to his throne. Wanting to atone for his mistake, Azkhai formed a close bond with Harakoy, spending much of his free time with her. After the escape from Mazwi, Azkhai had to leave her behind, but promised that he would not forget her. In the meantime she received high quality Re'emite education and proved to have a sharp mind. By the time the Zughe family returned to Zao, Harakoy had grown into a confident mare, but lacked the ambitions of her other relatives who craved to have the throne for themselves. Instead, she decided to wait patiently, knowing her turn would eventually come, and that her namesake guardian spirit, Harakoy Dizzo, would protect her, and that her father would always be on her side. King or not."

SON_kingdom_with_no_king:0 "Kingdom Without A King"
SON_kingdom_with_no_king_desc:0 "The Zar-Hay were once ruled by kings and queens of the Zughe dynasty. Under their protection the city of Zao prospered and the kingdom grew wealthy. But Mazwi saw this prosperity and wanted to seize it, invading the kingdom, slaying its ruling queen and taking her foals hostage. Almost two centuries later, Mazwi suffered divine punishment delivered by the evil Storm King, yet it is widely believed the royal family of Zar-Hay perished in the chaos. We once had hope for a triumphant return of our long-lost rulers, but there has been no sign of them. The throne remains vacant and none dare seize it, fearing that the vengeful ghosts of the Zughe dynasty will curse them."

SON_fire_the_forges_desc:0 "The Storm King swept aside his pathetic foes with the might of his armaments, which were more advanced than anything the Zar-Hay had seen. A new age of war is upon the world and Zar-Hay must be quick to adapt if it wishes to prevail. Thankfully, with how unstable Zebrica is nowadays, it is easy to acquire weaponry as long as you contact the right individuals."
SON_protector_of_reemites:0 "Protector Of The Re'emites"
SON_protector_of_reemites_desc:0 "The Re'emites are horses with a strange religion who have long been the neighbours of Zar-Hay. They value peace and progress and thus have advanced and prosperous cities. However, they have often been persecuted by others who see their faith as heresy. Zonni knows they would be more useful as an ally than an enemy, and has an interesting idea..."
SON_an_offering_to_spirits:0 "An Offering For The Spirits"
SON_an_offering_to_spirits_desc:0 "Aside from the Sky Stallion, the Supreme God of Heaven and Earth, the Zar-Hay worship many lesser gods of the world. If Zonni wishes to succeed in his campaigns, he must gain the unwavering support of the Holle, especially those who are associated with war. For this, he must choose a fitting sacrifice worthy of the Spirits."
SON_beat_drums_war:0 "Beat The Drums Of War"
SON_beat_drums_war_desc:0 "More warriors are needed if Zonni wishes to fulfill his dreams of conquest. Therefore the free zebras of the Kingdom shall be mobilized and levies organized. It has been many years since this has been done, but Zonni has made sure that the raising of the levies will go smoothly."
SON_rebuild_the_fleet:0 "Rebuild The Fleet"
SON_rebuild_the_fleet_desc:0 "During the rebellion against the Mazwian occupiers, Zonni used war canoes to great effect, liberating Zao with a daring attack from the lake. Now, he has ordered the Zar-Hay fleet to be expanded, so it would be restored to its former glory. Zargitau would be proud, as he was the creator of the canoe and often used it against his prey and his enemies."
SON_cast_down_false_prophet:0 "Cast Down The False Prophet"
SON_cast_down_false_prophet_desc:0 "In Macigena, an evil spirit possessed a zebra who has been preaching falsehoods to others. He has amassed a shockingly large following and now wishes to impose his corrupt ways upon the other tribes of the Great Lakes. This cannot be allowed to happen! Zonni has proclaimed the Prophet's rule illegitimate, justifying the subjugation of Macigena."
SON_mercy_for_warriors:0 "Mercy For The Warriors"
SON_mercy_for_warriors_desc:0 "Some of those who fought for the false prophet were not fanatics blinded by their zealotry, but regular warriors who were loyal to their tribes. These warriors simply fulfilled their duty and Zonni respects their skills at fighting. Now he shall offer to spare them if they swear oaths of loyalty to him, and him alone."
SON_burn_the_zealots:0 "Burn The Zealots"
SON_burn_the_zealots_desc:0 "He who led zebras astray has been captured, along with his most prominent followers. They will now be dealt with and punished for their misguided actions. Without their leader, the mad cultists will become disorganized and their cause will waver. Thus, they should threaten anyone no longer."
SON_religious_freedom:0 "Freedom Of Faith"
SON_religious_freedom_desc:0 "The dogmatists tried to force all zebras of Macigena to practice their religion in a single, unified way, persecuting and punishing those who refused to do so. Now that the reign of the deceiver is over, Zonni has announced that everyone can worship the gods in whatever way they wish, without having to fear for their lives."
SON_governor_of_macigena:0 "Restore The Tarkhans"
SON_governor_of_macigena_desc:0 "The time has come to integrate the tribes of Macigena into the Kingdom of Zar-Hay. They are welcome in the Kingdom, and Zonni will fully restore the power of the Tarkhans who were repressed by the mad fanatics. In return, they shall swear oaths of loyalty to the throne, acknowledging the Regent as their rightful ruler."
SON_the_fallen_kingdom:0 "The Fallen Kingdom"
SON_the_fallen_kingdom_desc:0 "To the north, the King of Alwani attempted to restore his broken realm after the end of Mazwian rule, but the city of Timbucktu defied him and refused to bend the knee. Alwani is clearly a mere shadow of its former self and should be easily crushed by Zonni's army, while controlling wealthy Timbucktu will bring great prosperity to Zar-Hay."
SON_city_of_misguided:0 "The City Of Misguided Scholars"
SON_city_of_misguided_desc:0 "The intellectuals and merchants of Timbucktu defied the King of Alwani when he returned from exile, wishing to remain independent. Now they may defy Zar-Hay as well, despite suffering a total military defeat. Tradition dictates that they should recognize their rightful superiors, but they are eager to break sacred traditions. Let them face the consequences."
SON_fate_of_the_king:0 "The Fate Of The King"
SON_fate_of_the_king_desc:0 "As the warriors marched into Alwani, they managed to capture King Euzegoar. The monarch had tried to re-establish his sundered realm, but had met with failure. Now he is disgraced and powerless, yet Zonni must decide if he is worthy to keep his life, or if he should be executed to break the spirit of his supporters."
SON_desert_tribes:0 "Recruit The Desert Warriors"
SON_desert_tribes_desc:0 "King Euzegoar's army was bolstered by savages from the Zubian desert, but Zonni quickly learned to respect their fighting skills. While they were highly loyal to the King, this has changed after his defeat. They could be convinced to fight for a new master and provide their knowledge of warfare to the Zar-Hay army."
SON_governor_of_north:0 "Appoint The Zubia-Farma"
SON_governor_of_north_desc:0 "The lands of the former Kingdom of Alwani are too vast to be directly administered, and it is not possible to simply subjugate local chiefs. Many remain loyal to the former King and Timbucktu has always had its own form of government. Therefore, a new title must be created for the zebra who will govern the north on behalf of the Kingdom of Zar-Hay."
SON_subjugate_south:0 "Subjugate The South"
SON_subjugate_south_desc:0 "In the south lie the heartlands of the Great Lakes, with fertile soil and prosperous cities. Control of the entire region cannot be secured without first seizing these lands. The Mazwians knew this as it was the first place they conquered. The upcoming war will not be easy, so Zonni must ensure he is well prepared before casting the die."
SON_eternal_no_more:0 "Eternal No More"
SON_eternal_no_more_desc:0 "The Zefuwa dynasty of Gelon-Zornu is respected, to the point where even the Mazwians left them alone. Yet they had no mercy on the other kings of the Great Lakes. The Zefuwa should not expect to get preferential treatment from those who lost their royalty while they fattened themselves on food under Mazwian protection."
SON_the_golden_fields:0 "The Golden Fields"
SON_the_golden_fields_desc:0 "The lands around the lakes are very fertile, producing plentiful amounts of sorghum and millet. Indeed, Ugabi and Aoranda were the breadbasket of the Imperial Mazwi, feeding its thriving cities. The new Zar-Hay dominion will also take advantage of this, but demanding less taxes than the Mazwians did, thus gaining the favour of the locals."
SON_haughty_city_states:0 "The Haughty City-States"
SON_haughty_city_states_desc:0 "After being subjugated, the city-states of Hayzebland immediately began demanding privileges and autonomy in exchange for loyalty, as they had been spoiled under Queen Bamina's rule. Their arrogance frustrated Zonni, and while his advisors recommend granting them autonomy, he would much rather deal with them in another way..."
SON_governor_of_south:0 "Appoint The Lake-Farma"
SON_governor_of_south_desc:0 "The heart has been seized, and with it, Zonni now controls the bloodflow of the Great Lakes. Any trade passing north, south, east or west must go through Zar-Hay. The golden fields of Ugabi and Aoranda will feed any hungry mouths in the kingdom. The cities of Hayzeb will produce all that is needed. Only one question remains: Who shall govern all of this?"
SON_revenge:0 "Revenge"
SON_revenge_desc:0 "Mazwi must be destroyed."
SON_search_for_royal_family:0 "Search For The Royal Family"
SON_search_for_royal_family_desc:0 "Now that the Zar-Hay army has secured control of Mazwi, a thorough search for the missing hostages of the royal family can be conducted. If even a single member of the Zughe dynasty could be found, the throne of Zar-Hay would no longer be vacant. To prove that Zonni wants no power for himself, he will support the search wholeheartedly."
SON_sack_ziani:0 "The Sack Of Ziani"
SON_sack_ziani_desc:0 "Zao was once a prosperous and great city, before the Mazwians came. Now Zar-Hay shall enact its vengeance upon the accursed Mazwians and lay waste to their capital. This lesson of humility should teach them to never oppress other nations ever again! Ziani shall burn, its citizens shall be slain, its industry shall be destroyed."
SON_crush_savages:0 "Enslave The Savages"
SON_crush_savages_desc:0 "The Mozzi are proud zebras, and thus defied Zonni until the bitter end. He will teach them the price of disobedience. Their strongest and most capable stallions and mares will be enslaved and forced to fight under their new master, Zonni Zolon. Those who refuse to accept this new life of slavery will be beaten to death."
SON_governor_of_west:0 "Appoint The Mazwi-Farma"
SON_governor_of_west_desc:0 "When Zar-Hay was subjugated and its royalty taken hostage, a cruel Mazwian chieftain was appointed as governor. He heavily taxed the populace, draining it from wealth. Now the tables have turned. Mazwi shall suffer like their subjects did, under the rule of a heartless governor. Truly, can any greater humiliation be brought upon them?"
SON_the_coronation:0 "The Coronation"
SON_the_coronation_desc:0 "The sons and daughters of Zargitau have triumphed! All of the Great Lakes now kneel before them and acknowledge them as their rightful masters. Once, the Zar-Hay were humiliated slaves, but never again! On this most glorious day, Regent Zonni Zolon shall proclaim a new empire, standing proud upon the ruins of Imperial Mazwi."

SON_lessons_from_battles:0 "Lessons From Battles"
SON_lessons_from_battles_desc:0 "Zonni Zolon knows that every battle against the enemy is a chance to refine the art of war. Mistakes must be learned from and successes need to be repeated. The enemy's tactics need to be analyzed as well so weaknesses can be found and exploited. Doing all this, the army's military strategies will slowly be honed to perfection."
SON_meritocratic_promotion:0 "Meritocratic Promotion"
SON_meritocratic_promotion_desc:0 "The warriors should be commanded by those who are capable, not those who earned their position through familial connections or tribal allegiances. Zonni seeks to always promote the most distinguished soldiers into higher ranks, so they can use their combat experience to improve the army."
SON_ceaseless_drilling:0 "Ceaseless Drilling"
SON_ceaseless_drilling_desc:0 "Drilling has always been vital to warfare. Moreso in the past, when units fought in formation, but even now in the age of guns drilling can be used to improve the discipline of the army and the maneuverability of infantry. Constantly training the soldiers to march orderly and obey commands will enhance their performance."
SON_foreign_military_advisors:0 "Hire Foreign Advisors"
SON_foreign_military_advisors_desc:0 "While some may be sceptical of foreigners and their bizarre ways, there is no doubt that their methods of waging war and making weapons are far more advanced than anything in the Great Lakes. Using loot from conquests to hire experts from abroad would help greatly in modernizing the nation."
SON_formalized_recruitment:0 "Advanced Conscription Methods"
SON_formalized_recruitment_desc:0 "In modern war, every citizen is a soldier. The old methods of tribal levies and voluntary recruitment are simply too inefficient. With the help of foreign advisors, free zebras of the nation will be given basic training and drafted into the reserve pool, ready to replace casualties when needed."
SON_supply_logistic_crap:0 "Supply And Logistics"
SON_supply_logistic_crap_desc:0 "Every good commander knows that it is logistics that decide the outcome of wars. Unfortunately, the foreign advisors have discovered that the supply chains of the Zar-Hay army are archaic at best, incapable of supporting a full-scale modern force. Properly organized and well-planned logistics will help greatly in supplying the warriors."
SON_retrain_royal_guard:0 "Retrain The Royal Retinue"
SON_retrain_royal_guard_desc:0 "The most loyal warriors of the Kingdom serve the throne directly and are among the most capable fighters in all of Zar-Hay. Yet recent battles have proven that their tactics and equipment are outdated. They could be greatly improved with some rigorous training and refinement of strategies."
SON_artillery_experimentation:0 "Experimentation With Artillery"
SON_artillery_experimentation_desc:0 "So far the use of artillery in the army has been limited, but there is no doubt that long-range heavy weaponry has immense potential on the battlefield. New and more modern designs for big guns should be adopted by the gunsmiths so the infantry can have proper fire support."
SON_royal_gun_workshop:0 "Royal Cannon Workshop"
SON_royal_gun_workshop_desc:0 "While the gunsmith guilds work hard to supply the army, it is not enough. Zonni Zolon has decreed that a workshop dedicated to producing weaponry needs to be established in Zao. Unlike a traditional guild, it will employ unskilled workers to boost production rates, at expense of quality."
SON_meet_with_sorcerer:0 "Meet With The Sorcerer"
SON_meet_with_sorcerer_desc:0 "The enigmatic Chief of the Zarabara tribe, Faran, has so far shown only token support for Zonni's cause. Because he is a renowned sorcerer, his abilities could be of great use to the Kingdom. A meeting must be arranged so his aid can be secured."
SON_anti_resistance_crap:0 "Crush Resistance Movements"
SON_anti_resistance_crap_desc:0 "The defeated must learn to accept defeat instead of continuing to foolishly resist their new masters. Zonni will authorize his warriors to conduct brutal reprisals on anyone who opposes the new Zar-Hay hegemony over the Great Lakes. Under Mazwian rule, the Zar-Hay suffered greatly; now others must experience the same."
SON_support_crap:0 "Dedicated Support Units"
SON_support_crap_desc:0 "Not all warriors have to fight, as Zonni has learned. Some warriors are better off fulfilling supporting roles, such as reconnaisance or engineering, which indirectly aid their comrades. Thus specialized support companies should be formed and integrated into the army."

# Civil war 

SON_the_rightful_zuwa:0 "The Rightful Zuwa"
SON_the_rightful_zuwa_desc:0 "Azkhai Zughe may claim to be the rightful king of Zar-Hay, but he has no right to claim hegemony over the Great Lakes! Zonni is the one who led his warriors to victory, so he is the one who deserves to rule! Azkhai will either learn to bend the knee or die, like the other petty kings Zonni subjugated."
SON_question_identity:0 "Question His Identity"
SON_question_identity_desc:0 "How can anyone know for sure if Azkhai truly is a scion of the Zughe family? A mere signet ring alone proves nothing. There is a lack of convincing evidence and testification about him being the royal heir to the throne. A propaganda campaign must be launched where the truth is exposed for all to see!"
SON_appeal_to_warriors:0 "Appeal To Warriors"
SON_appeal_to_warriors_desc:0 "While many soldiers ended up being more loyal to the pretender King than the Zuwa, there are some who are more hesitant. They feel oblidged to follow the King, but in truth their loyalties lie with the brave leader who led them into countless victories. Appealing to these soldiers might convince them to switch sides again."
SON_put_slaves_to_work:0 "Put The Slaves To Work"
SON_put_slaves_to_work_desc:0 "A substantial number of slaves have been gained from the recent wars, as many prisoners of war were enslaved. Yet this expanded workforce has not yet been fully utilized. Now, during this civil war, the army must be fully supplied, so the slaves must be pressed to work harder."
SON_aid_from_advisors:0 "Aid From Advisors"
SON_aid_from_advisors_desc:0 "The foreign advisors who were hired earlier will now prove useful. Zonni will order them to the front, aiding the commanders and ensuring the loyalist forces are well organized. Their expertise will be a boon for the army, though they demand extra payment in return."
SON_forced_conscription:0 "Forced Conscription"
SON_forced_conscription_desc:0 "More soldiers are needed to decisively crush the rebellion. Yet there is a lack of experienced warriors, so once again regular zebras will have to be pressed into service to fill in the gaps in the ranks. Victory must be guaranteed at any cost."
SON_fear_campaign:0 "Fear Campaign"
SON_fear_campaign_desc:0 "Fear is what keeps rebels and traitors in check. Despite the terrible things Zonni had done, many weren't afraid enough of him and joined the King in his rebellion. Clearly, he simply didn't go far enough. New acts of terror must be conducted to teach the enemies what will happen to those who resist."
SON_he_shall_not_be_it:0 "He Shall Not Be It!"
SON_he_shall_not_be_it_desc:0 "The King should've accepted Zonni's offer. He was trying to be reasonable, but the King was hungry for total power, wanting to seize control of Zonni's Empire. But he shall not be King for much longer! Nobody has survived Zonni's wrath so far. Why would he be the exception?"

SON_the_rightful_king:0 "The Rightful King"
SON_the_rightful_king_desc:0 "If you are reading this, you used console commands. However, you don't deserve punishment. As an easter egg treat, I will explain the answers to Brodfeld's mystery events in the descriptions of these foci!"
SON_spread_news:0 "Spread The Word"
SON_spread_news_desc:0 "The first event is rather simple. It uses a Caesarean ROT cipher. There is a hint in the last capitalized word CLAW, which corresponds to OXMI. Using this, you can find the correct ROT cipher and use it to translate the text and the responses."
SON_liberate_prisoners:0 "Liberate Prisoners Of War"
SON_liberate_prisoners_desc:0 "The second event is more complex, using an affine cipher. What looks like a mathematical formula is actually the cipher key which can be used to decode the text. You only really need the A and B coefficients from the key to decrypt the text using a website or program."
SON_promise_freedom:0 "Promise Freedom To Slaves"
SON_promise_freedom_desc:0 "The third event confuses a lot of people despite not having encryption. This is because the riddle is extremely difficult unless you are a big astrophysics nerd, and even then it might be confusing. It describes the formation of Uranium in a supernova and the decay series of its isotopes. The answer is the mode of the final decay into lead."
SON_amnesty_for_scholars:0 "Amnesty For Scholars"
SON_amnesty_for_scholars_desc:0 "In contrast to the previous one, the fourth event is more of a simple trick question. The correct answer is quite obvious. The fifth event requires basic familiarity with the MLP franchise. When you know the characteristics and the backstories of the three princesses, the answer is once again fairly obvious."
SON_united_against_tyranny:0 "United Against Tyranny"
SON_united_against_tyranny_desc:0 "The sixth event uses various languages which need to be translated. The easiest way to do so is to simply use an online translator program, though some of the languages used are somewhat obscure. The seventh event's answer is clear if you keep in mind Kloseu is blindfolded."
SON_expose_his_crimes:0 "Expose His Crimes"
SON_expose_his_crimes_desc:0 "The eighth event is a riddle, and somewhat of a trick question. While it might seem like all answers fit, only one of them does. As a fun fact, it is based on a real Freemason legend. The theme for the allegory is the same as the answer to the parable."
SON_long_live_the_king:0 "Long Live The King!"
SON_long_live_the_king_desc:0 "By the time you reach the ninth event, you have solved all puzzles, yet are given one last chance to simply return to the normal Brodfeld path. These focus descriptions did not give direct answers, but hopefully the hints should be enough to figure everything out."

# Supremacy path

SON_the_four_oaths:0 "The Four Oaths"
SON_the_four_oaths_desc:0 "After the civil war, the undying loyalty of the Zuwa's subjects must be guaranteed. All those who serve the greatest zebra nation on Zebrica must be required to swear four fundamental oaths. These oaths summarize the primary objectives of the entire nation as a whole. Pursuing these goals will bring greatness to the Great Lakes!"
SON_prosperity_to_the_nation:0 "Prosperity To The Nation"
SON_prosperity_to_the_nation_desc:0 ""With God as my witness, I solemnly swear to dedicate my life to diligent, productive labour to further the development of my glorious Imperial homeland. I shall obediently give a portion of my wealth to the Zuwa, so he may use it wisely for the common good of the nation.""
SON_negotiate_with_reem:0 "Negotiate With Re'em"
SON_negotiate_with_reem_desc:0 "While Re'emite aid has been a great boon to the nation, the economy of Zar-Hay remains underdeveloped. More of their assistance is needed, and Zonni must guarantee continued cooperation. Therefore he shall visit Re'em and ensure the current mutually beneficial relationship is maintained."
SON_urban_commercialization:0 "Urban Commercialization"
SON_urban_commercialization_desc:0 "Re'emite cities thrive thanks to a system of free trade, private ownership and economic competition. A similar economic system should be adopted in the urban centers of the Great Lakes. The Zuwa has decreed the end of tariffs in cities, the breakup of guilds and the establishment of a legal framework of property rights."
SON_rural_collectivization:0 "Rural Collectivization"
SON_rural_collectivization_desc:0 "The Re'emite countryside is divided into numerous collective communities. They share the land and work on it together, sharing the produce among themselves. Gradually adopting a similar system in the Great Lakes would fit the traditional system of clan ownership while incentivizing agricultural cooperation."
SON_striving_for_self_suffiency:0 "Striving For Self-Sufficiency"
SON_striving_for_self_suffiency_desc:0 "Exclusively relying on others is weakness, and Zar-Hay must be strong. The importance of strategic resources increases as the military is modernized, so with Re'emite aid, mines and other production facilities need to be expanded and improved. While total autarky is impossible, domestic supply is always more reliable than foreign."
SON_imperial_railway:0 "The Imperial Railway"
SON_imperial_railway_desc:0 "Railroads are the transportation method of the future. Re'emites already have experience with building them, so with their assistance a grand railway connecting Timbucktu and Zano can be constructed. It shall be a monument to the ever growing development of the Imperial Realm!"
SON_imperial_guilds:0 "The Imperial Guilds"
SON_imperial_guilds_desc:0 "The artisan caste of Zar-Hay has traditionally been divided into various craft guilds, each specializing in producing a different kind of product. But these organizations are too small and archaic for the modern age. New, state-owned and nation-wide Imperial Guilds shall be established to manage skilled labour in the name of the Zuwa."
SON_question_of_slavery:0 "The Question Of Slavery"
SON_question_of_slavery_desc:0 "A rigid caste system has always been part of Zar-Hay society, and thus slavery is an ancient tradition. Yet in these times of rapid change, the institution of slavery is being questioned. Re'em further pressures the Zuwa to abolish the "barbaric" practice. How will he resolve this difficult problem?"
SON_renovation_of_zao:0 "Renovation Of Zao"
SON_renovation_of_zao_desc:0 "Before the rise of Mazwi, Zao was a glimmering capital of the Kingdom, with thriving markets, wide streets and tall houses. Over the two centuries of foreign rule, it became a mere shadow of its former self. Now Zonni shall restore its lost glory and make it a capital worthy of an Empire!"
SON_grand_burial_mound:0 "A Grand Burial Mound"
SON_grand_burial_mound_desc:0 "It is customary for members of the aristocratic caste to construct burial mounds for themselves and their family. The one built by Zonni's father is rather small, as he was not wealthy. It is not worthy of his family name any longer, and the Zuwa has decided to construct a new burial mound, the largest one ever seen in the Great Lakes."
SON_offer_they_cant_refuse:0 "An Offer They Can't Refuse"
SON_offer_they_cant_refuse_desc:0 "The ties between Zar-Hay and Re'em have become very close over the years. So close, in fact, that there is no reason for the two to remain as separate nations. As a final culmination of this most productive relationship, Re'em will be offered the irresistible opportunity to be annexed into the Imperial Realm."
SON_loyalty_to_the_zuwa:0 "Loyalty To The Zuwa"
SON_loyalty_to_the_zuwa_desc:0 ""With God as my witness, I solemnly swear to dedicate my life to serving the Imperial Zuwa.

I shall obey the commands of my superiors without question, knowing their wisdom to be greater than mine.""
SON_reward_the_loyal:0 "Reward The Loyal"
SON_reward_the_loyal_desc:0 "The civil war was only won thanks to the valiant efforts of those who refused to betray their Zuwa. Many gave their lives in the fight against the traitors. Those who survived however deserve to be honoured just like the spirits of those who fell. Let it be known that Zonni is generous and kind to those who serve him."
SON_council_of_generals:0 "The Council Of Generals"
SON_council_of_generals_desc:0 "The Zuwa cannot rule alone. He needs competent advisors by his side. Who could better fulfill such a role than the officers who fought by Zonni's side? They have proven themselves to be loyal and competent zebras. By establishing an advisory council of military commanders, Zar-Hay's security will be guaranteed."
SON_service_guarantees_citizenship:0 "Service Guarantees Citizenship"
SON_service_guarantees_citizenship_desc:0 "The concept of being a subject of Zar-Hay should be refined and formalized into a status of citizenship. Being an Imperial citizen would grant all basic rights and protections of the law. However, attaining it would require several years of active military service. This way, zebras will be strongly encouraged to join the army."
SON_arms_industry_crap:0 "The Imperial Arsenal"
SON_arms_industry_crap_desc:0 "To supply the ever growing Imperial Army, improved production and storage facilities will be needed for all the modern equipment required. For that purpose a grand arsenal shall be built in Anzongo. Its pre-existing industrial base will provide an excellent foundation for such a facility."
SON_reshape_identity:0 "Reshaping Identity"
SON_reshape_identity_desc:0 "Traditionally, being a Zar-Hay meant being a descendant of Zargitau. But would the tribe not be stronger if it welcomed all into its ranks? Mazwi failed because it was one tribe subjugating other tribes. Zar-Hay shall thrive, because it will be one tribe uniting all others under one banner."
SON_cultural_synthesis:0 "Cultural Synthesis"
SON_cultural_synthesis_desc:0 "The culture of the Zar-Hay cannot be allowed to stagnate or become isolated. To truly forge a greater identity, elements of other strong cultures of the Great Lakes should be integrated, so that the Zar-Hay may grow stronger as a tribe. This will make assimilation far easier as well."
SON_language_standardization:0 "Language Standardization"
SON_language_standardization_desc:0 "The Great Lakes have hundreds of languages, and even in Zar-Hay proper, there are numerous local dialects. For the sake of administration, a single official language must be established: The Zao dialect of Zar-Hay. This standardized language shall then be taught at schools across the realm."

SON_death_to_the_traitors_desc:0 ""With God as my witness, I solemnly swear to dedicate my life to ensure the security of the realm.

SON_police_force:0 "The Assara-Munidios"
SON_police_force_desc:0 "The recent chaos in the Great Lakes resulted in rampant crime, and honest zebras had to live in fear of ruthless criminals. Now that there is peace, there must be order as well. The Imperial Enforcers, Assara-Munidios, shall ensure laws are obeyed and evildoers are punished."
SON_some_spy_shit_idk:0 "Eyes Of The Zuwa"
SON_some_spy_shit_idk_desc:0 "The pretender King fooled Zonni and took him by surprise. In secret, he had prepared an uprising against him. This cannot be allowed to happen ever again! Spies will infiltrate society and search for any signs of treason. They will guard against foreign espionage as well. Let it be known the Zuwa has more than two eyes!"
SON_religious_pluralism:0 "Religious Pluralism"
SON_religious_pluralism_desc:0 "The Great Lakes are home to many diverse beliefs and ways of worship. Already, Zonni proclaimed tolerance, but now the equality of all religions shall be enshrined in law. Even the strange Re'emite faith shall be fully tolerated and their communities integrated."
SON_mass_education:0 "Mass Education"
SON_mass_education_desc:0 "Identity construction requires compulsory education for all citizens and their offspring. Not only that, but to truly be a strong and developed nation, countless skilled workers are needed, and the only way to acquire them is through education. Attending state-schools will be mandatory under the threat of whipping."
SON_diminished_persecution:0 "Diminished Anti-Intellectualism"
SON_diminished_persecution_desc:0 "Zuwa Zonni has been distrustful of scholars ever since the learned zebras of Timbucktu conspired against him. His advisors have constantly tried to convince him of the benefits of supporting intellectuals, yet their pleas fell on deaf ears. Until now. Zonni has finally agreed to ease up on them, to some extent."
SON_fate_of_the_caste_system:0 "Fate Of The Caste System"
SON_fate_of_the_caste_system_desc:0 "Societies of the Great Lakes have traditionally been divided into endogamous classes, as marriage between different groups was frowned upon. The caste system ensured societal harmony and maintained a rigid hierarchy, yet now its usefulness is in doubt. Perhaps it does more harm than good for the Imperial Realm?"
SON_imperial_academy:0 "The Imperial Academy"
SON_imperial_academy_desc:0 "Meritocratic promotion alone does not guarantee a large enough supply of capable individuals.

SON_glory_to_the_army_desc:0 ""With God as my witness, I solemnly swear to dedicate my life to defending the nation against any foreign incursions. I shall answer the call when I am needed on the front. I shall never desert the army or surrender to the enemy, fighting to the death if necessary.""
SON_new_model_army:0 "New Model's New Model Army"
SON_new_model_army_desc:0 "Imperial Mazwi fell because it failed to adapt. This is why the Storm King's modern army swept it aside. New Model, a foreign officer from the distant land of Equestria, has proposed various drastic reforms to transform the Imperial Army into a truly modern fighting force, capable of repelling any invader."

SON_recruit_ugabi_officers_desc:0 "Before being utterly crushed by Zonni's army, the Ugabians had invested greatly into modernizing their military, even establishing an armoured brigade. The knowledge of former UCTA officers is valuable, and thus they should be offered redemption. Their experience with armoured warfare will be most useful."
SON_establish_air_force:0 "Flying Zebras"
SON_establish_air_force_desc:0 "A key factor in the Storm King's military success was his use of air power. Airships are already being obsoleted by new technologies which Zar-Hay should be quick to adopt. Planes need to be built, pilots need to be trained and an air base established. The new Imperial air force will soon provide vital support for the army."
SON_first_trial:0 "First Trial Of The New Army"
SON_first_trial_desc:0 "The reforms of New Model are well underway, yet the new army has yet to be tested in practice. To the east, a yeti warlord carved out a realm of his own in the chaos following the collapse of Mazwi and the death of the Storm King. Securing the eastern border of Zar-Hay would be an excellent military exercise for the army."
SON_land_of_dervishes:0 "The Land Of The Dervishes"
SON_land_of_dervishes_desc:0 "To the east remain the successors of the once mighty realm of Hyenia, who suffered under the Storm King much like Mazwi did. Yet they have rebuilt their strength and pose a potential threat to the eastern border of the Imperial Realm. They must submit under Zonni's authority. Otherwise, the dogmatic desert dogs cannot be trusted."
SON_fortify_borders:0 "Fortify The Borders"
SON_fortify_borders_desc:0 "With all the land the Zuwa has rightfully taken, Zar-Hay now borders many foreign nations that may become enemies. The new frontiers must be secured, so they are not lost as easily as they were seized. Thousands of labourers will be put to work to construct countless defensive structures across the Imperial border."
SON_elixir_of_life:0 "Elixir Of Life"
SON_elixir_of_life_desc:0 "The Imperial Realm has been built entirely around the Zuwa. Yet he is not immortal, and has no heir. He fears that all the work he has done will be reduced to ashes, if his future children squabble over inheritance. But if he would never perish, then such a thing would never happen. Surely there is a cure for death?"
SON_pacify_the_south:0 "Pacify The South"
SON_pacify_the_south_desc:0 "The successors of the Storm King were embroiled in a civil war for many years. This made them weak and disunited, unable to pose a threat to their neighbours. But it would not last forever. The rise of another despoiler like the Storm King must be prevented at all costs! The yeti must be crushed swiftly before it is too late."
SON_demand_ovingoland:0 "Demand Ovingoland"
SON_demand_ovingoland_desc:0 "During the chaos of Mazwi's collapse, thousands upon thousands of refugees fled northward from the Great Lakes region. They settled in the sparsely populated land known as Ovingoland. They have no interest in going back to their homes, but this does present an excellent justification to secure Zar-Hay's northern frontier."
SON_secure_the_west:0 "Secure The West"
SON_secure_the_west_desc:0 "The Imperial Realm's western land border has become long, yet it could be made much shorter. It is a strategic necessity to invade the Saddle Arabian splinter states of the Riseian peninsula, before they fall under the control of potentially hostile powers. The west must be secured, so the Realm is safe from all cardinal directions."
SON_create_navy_crap:0 "Establish The Imperial Navy"
SON_create_navy_crap_desc:0 "Once Zar-Hay was a landlocked state, but no more. Vast stretches of coastline have been acquired and naval trade routes established, which now need to be defended from potential enemy attacks. Mere river canoes are no longer enough: A proper oceanic navy is needed, with modern vessels made of steel."
SON_ozymandias:0 "Look On My Works, Ye Mighty, And Despair!"
SON_ozymandias_desc:0 "Zuwa Zonni has made his mark on the history of the world. He took the small and impoverished realm of Zar-Hay and forged it with fire and blood into a mighty and vast Imperial Realm, becoming one of the major powers of Zebrica. He can rest well knowing that his legacy will endure for countless generations."

# Post-Zonni epilogue tree

SON_crush_the_rebels:0 "Crush The Rebels"
SON_crush_the_rebels_desc:0 "Unlike Zonni, Meynsata is a warrior of honour. But even she has little tolerance for traitors and rebels, especially when they see her as a weakling. While she understands their bitterness about Zonni's reign, she hoped they would've given her a chance. But they did not. Now, they shall regret it."
SON_promise_reform:0 "Promise Reform"
SON_promise_reform_desc:0 "Despite some token reforms such as abolishing slavery, the conditions for the lower classes remained poor. Meynsata intends to improve their situation, not only out of empathy but to secure the stability of her uncertain reign. She will promise widespread social reforms to curb revolutionary support."
SON_reform_admin:0 "Reorganize Administration"
SON_reform_admin_desc:0 "The system of governorates established by Zonni proved to be cumbersome, and gave far too much power and influence to the appointed governors. A more sustainable system needs to be created. The large governorates will be carved up into numerous smaller provinces. The current governors will all be dismissed."
SON_end_repression:0 "End The Repression Of Scholars"
SON_end_repression_desc:0 "Ever since the conquest of Timbucktu, Zonni distrusted scholars and saw them as enemies of the state. Now that he is gone, there is no need to be excessively paranoid. The Zuwa commands that all unjust prosecution of intellectuals shall be ended immediately. She also formally apologizes for their previous treatment."
SON_reemite_autonomy:0 "Grant Autonomy To Re'em"
SON_reemite_autonomy_desc:0 "The Re'emites did much to help the Imperial Realm, yet received nothing in return. Instead, Zonni took away their precious liberty and annexed them directly into his personal domain. This injustice shall now be undone, and the Re'emites will be rewarded for their faithful service to Zar-Hay."
SON_revise_the_oaths:0 "Revise The Oaths"
SON_revise_the_oaths_desc:0 "The four oaths that formed the backbone of Zonni's rule were regarded as draconian and authoritarian. While their core principles were not flawed, the wording of the oaths was often criticised. The oaths should be revised so the Zuwa's subjects are more willing to fulfill them."
SON_trade_policy:0 "Formalize Trade Policy"
SON_trade_policy_desc:0 "Zonni never cared much for economic legislation and left most such matters to his advisors. As such, a clear national policy on trade with foreign countries was never established. Meynsata seeks to revise this, despite lacking any economic knowledge as well. She will consult her advisors before making a decision."
SON_end_the_experiment:0 "End The Experiment"
SON_end_the_experiment_desc:0 "Zonni had a grand ambition of uniting the disparate tribes of the Great Lakes into a single superculture, and he was partially successful. Yet policies of forced cultural assimiliation have angered many Imperial subjects, and appeasing them is necessary to maintain integrity of the realm. Therefore no further programs of social engineering shall be conducted."
SON_estates_of_the_realm:0 "Form The Great Assembly"
SON_estates_of_the_realm_desc:0 "The Imperial Mazwi of the past had a deliberative assembly, the Gbara, where leading members of Mazwian clans could vote on political matters. A similar governmental body would be very useful to Meynsata, so she can leave drafting of policies to the nobility, while she herself can focus on defending the nation."
SON_zonnis_legacy:0 "Zonni's Legacy"
SON_zonnis_legacy_desc:0 "With Meynsata's reforms, more and more zebras dare to speak out negatively about Zonni and his deeds. He has become a controversial figure, and his legacy is being questioned. How should he be remembered by the future generations? It is up to Meynsata to decide how history books will be written."

# Harmony path

SON_back_home:0 "Back Home"
SON_back_home_desc:0 "After all these years of longing and waiting, the King and his royal family have finally returned back to their tribe in Zar-Hay. Now is the time for great jubilation and elation, as the Kingdom has its King once again."
SON_golden_tablets_of_zao:0 "The Golden Tablets"
SON_golden_tablets_of_zao_desc:0 "The anarchy that has reigned in the Great Lakes during the past decade must come to an end. The King's servants shall promulgate a new set of laws which are carved upon golden tablets and are inspired by the Gulu tablet of Ugabi. They will abolish slavery and form a rock-solid foundation for a fair and just society."
SON_continue_cooperation_with_reem:0 "Continue Cooperation With Re'em"
SON_continue_cooperation_with_reem_desc:0 "The former regent Zonni developed a rather close relationship with Re'em. While he is no longer in charge, we have no reason to sever our productive relationship with the horses. In fact, we should make our two nations even closer to each other through peaceful diplomacy and trade."
SON_support_the_scholars:0 "Support The Scholars"
SON_support_the_scholars_desc:0 "During Zonni's reign, scholars faced extensive and unjust persecution. This has come to a swift end after the change of power, but it is not enough. To show the educated zebras of the Great Lakes that the King is a lover of learning and wisdom, a new organization will be founded dedicated to supporting scholarly ventures."
SON_a_professional_army:0 "Professionalization Of The Army"
SON_a_professional_army_desc:0 "Zonni made no distinction between soldiers and civilians. To him, everyzebra was a potential warrior. But the Royal Army shall be different. Only the very best will be accepted into its ranks, and they will be dedicated full-time soldiers, paid straight from the royal treasury."
SON_secure_trade_routes:0 "Secure Trade Routes"
SON_secure_trade_routes_desc:0 "Trade was once the lifeblood of the Great Lakes, but many years of conflict greatly reduced commerce as trade routes became too dangerous. Now that there is peace and order once again, but Azkhai will go even further. Garrisons will be built along trade routes, roaming bandits will be hunted down and new trade agreements will be made with other countries."
SON_import_machinery:0 "Import Industrial Machinery"
SON_import_machinery_desc:0 "Machines are the key to this new "industrial revolution". They allow for far more efficient production of goods, which brings greater prosperity to society as a whole. However, there are few zebras in the Great Lakes who know how to build such machinery. Thankfully, Re'emites are happy to provide us not only with the expertise, but with the machines themselves."
SON_educate_every_zebra:0 "Education For Every Zebra"
SON_educate_every_zebra_desc:0 "Traditionally in the Great Lakes, education has been a privilege of the wealthy zebras of the upper castes. But Azkhai wants this to change. He believes every zebra has a right to education, and that this will greatly improve society as a whole. He will recruit the scholars of Re'em and Timbucktu to aid with this monumental task."
SON_build_a_bureaucratic_machine:0 "Build A Bureaucratic Machine"
SON_build_a_bureaucratic_machine_desc:0 "The King rules Zar-Hay, but ultimately he has to delegate the execution of his laws to officials. After Zonni's conquests, Zar-Hay has become a vast realm. To govern all of it, the royal government must extent its reach by expanding its bureaucracy to unprecedented size with the help of the scholars."
SON_royal_air_force:0 "Found The Royal Air Force"
SON_royal_air_force_desc:0 "One of the factors that led to Mazwi's collapse was the lack of any air force, which allowed the Storm King to use his airships to great advantage. The skies of Zar-Hay shall be protected not only by the Sky Stallion, but by our brave pilots too."
SON_refurbish_royal_guard:0 "Reform The Royal Retinue"
SON_refurbish_royal_guard_desc:0 "The Royal Retinue continued to exist even without their King. In return for their undying loyalty, King Azkhai will not only give them all the resources they need, but also order a series of reforms to expand their ranks, improve their training and update their equipment. With all this, they will become the strong core of the Royal Army."
SON_abolish_guilds:0 "Abolish The Guild System"
SON_abolish_guilds_desc:0 "Guilds, associations of skilled artisans, have existed in the Great Lakes for a long time. But we live in an age where old traditions and their usefulness are reconsidered. Guilds hinder trade, innovation and proliferation of skills. They benefit nozebra except those who belong in them. Thus, they shall be disbanded."
SON_canal_network:0 "Build A Canal Network"
SON_canal_network_desc:0 "The Great Lakes are a region of not only lakes, but also many rivers. They contain plentiful water which can be used to irrigate farms. Building a network of irrigation canals would require plenty of effort, but would be worthwhile in the end as it would greatly increase farm yields and thus improve rural productivity, allowing fewer farmers to feed more mouths."
SON_royal_railways:0 "The Royal Railways"
SON_royal_railways_desc:0 "Railways are the transportation method of tomorrow. Zebras will no longer have to pull heavy wagons along roads, as instead wheeled machines with engines can pull huge loads along tracks of steel. With the help of our Re'emite friends, a new railway company will be founded, with the goal to connect every major city in the Kingdom."
SON_a_center_of_learning:0 "A Center Of Learning"
SON_a_center_of_learning_desc:0 "The university of Timbucktu is famous, but is also the only one of its kind in the Great Lakes. With royal patronage, a new university shall be established in the capital of the Kingdom itself. Intellectuals from across the region and Re'em will be invited to teach there, and students will be welcomed with open hooves."
SON_administrative_reform:0 "Administrative Reform"
SON_administrative_reform_desc:0 "The governorates established by Zonni felt like a hasty, temporary affair. They are far too large and cumbersome to continue to exist. Therefore, in his wisdom, the King has decreed that the governorates will be abolished, and the Kingdom reorganized into smaller provinces, whose governors will have greatly reduced autonomy."
SON_royal_armory:0 "The Royal Armory"
SON_royal_armory_desc:0 "Firepower is the key to modern warfare, and the Kingdom lacks heavy guns. To alleviate the shortage of weapons, the King has decreed the establishment of a royal armory in Zao, which will be dedicated to producing and stockpiling armaments based on foreign designs."
SON_army_motorization:0 "Motorize The Army"
SON_army_motorization_desc:0 "Wagons powered by combustion engines, so-called trucks, can carry heavy loads across moderate distances, even in rough terrain. They can carry far more supplies than zebras can alone. Ensuring the royal army knows how to operate and maintain these trucks will be a boon to the logistics of the army. It is said an army marches on its stomach, but our army will drive on wheels."
SON_march_to_the_east:0 "March Into The Zebhara"
SON_march_to_the_east_desc:0 "Following the collapse of both Imperial Mazwi and the Storm Kingdom, a mad yeti warlord carved an empire of his own in the eastern desert. While Azkhai prefers to avoid war, there is no denying that [CZR.GetNameDef] would be better off as part of the Kingdom of Zar-Hay. Therefore, the royal army shall go to the east and occupy that land."
SON_coca_cola:0 "Support The Kola-Cola Company"
SON_coca_cola_desc:0 "With recent economic developments, many new private companies are being established to replace the guilds of old. One of these is the Kola-Cola company, founded by a zebra who invented a new type of soft drink made from kola nuts. This drink is proven to be very delicious and popular, and the King himself is fond of it. Let everyone enjoy the flavour of Kola-Cola!"
SON_royal_charity:0 "Royal Charity"
SON_royal_charity_desc:0 "As the King of Zar-Hay, Azkhai is a wealthy zebra. But he has little need for riches as he lives a relatively humble life. He wishes for his subjects to enjoy prosperity too, and plans to initiate a program of royal charity, where the poor and needy get a share of his wealth."
SON_planned_urbanization:0 "Planned Urbanization"
SON_planned_urbanization_desc:0 "As Zar-Hay develops into a modern country, its cities grow rapidly with all the zebras moving into them from the countryside. If this growth is not carefully managed, then squalid slums will grow like mushrooms in rain. The government must ensure there's paved streets, proper housing and plumbing so the cities grow in an orderly manner."
SON_cultural_pluralism:0 "Cultural Pluralism"
SON_cultural_pluralism_desc:0 "Zar-Hay is a kingdom of many peoples, not just the Zar-Hay themselves. Diversity is our strength, not our weakness. While Zar-Hay is first among equals, the traditions and languages of other cultures will be respected. This will make them more eager to serve their King, even if he is a foreigner to them."
SON_kill_yeti:0 "Crush The Yeti"
SON_kill_yeti_desc:0 "Ever since its formation, the Storm Kingdom has been a menace to its neighbours, enslaving zebras and sacking everything valuable. Even Zao was not spared from their barbarity. The yeti must be militarily defeated once and for all so they never again threaten other races. Only then can we have peace here in southern Zebrica."
SON_approach_qaylids:0 "The Qaylidi Question"
SON_approach_qaylids_desc:0 "The dervishes of the east are mysterious folk and little is known about them. They practice a strange religion and the only thing we share in common is hatred of the yeti. Our relations do not need to be hostile however, but only if they are open to diplomacy. Otherwise, we'll have no choice but to see them as a threat."
SON_resolve_ovingoland:0 "Welcome Back Ovingoland Refugees"
SON_resolve_ovingoland_desc:0 "During the Storm King's rampage in the Great Lakes, hundreds of thousands of zebras fled north into the lands of Maregypt. They formed their own identity, that of "Ovingoland", and stirred trouble in their new home. Now that there is peace and security in the Great Lakes once more, the refugees can return home. All we have to do is ask [766.owner.GetNameDef] to let them go."
SON_phase_out_castes:0 "Phase Out The Caste System"
SON_phase_out_castes_desc:0 "The caste system is an old part of Zar-Hay culture, but in this new age, there is an incentive to increase class mobility. Allowing zebras to choose their profession rather than have it dictated by birth will enable more and more zebras to rise from destitution. Of course, there's the possibility that this will anger the upper castes who jealously guard their power..."
SON_expand_canal_network:0 "Expand The Canal Network"
SON_expand_canal_network_desc:0 "Rivers and lakes are used extensively for transport, yet they were made by nature, and thus don't always make for efficient travel routes. By digging even more artificial canals, the flow of water can be redirected and new, safe highways made for ships. This will shorten travel times and expenses considerably and help the Kingdom prosper."
SON_cult_of_sky_stallion:0 "Cult Of The Sky Stallion"
SON_cult_of_sky_stallion_desc:0 "The zebras of the Great Lakes share little in common, except for one thing: A concept of a God who is above both ancestors and Spirits. If a cult is created around this entity, which in Zar-Hay is known as the Sky Stallion, then the subjects of the Kingdom can be united by a single faith. The misguided Prophet of Macigena had a similar idea, but we will not force it upon anyzebra."
SON_develop_zwahile:0 "Develop Zwahile"
SON_develop_zwahile_desc:0 "The region of Zwahile Coast suffered under yeti rule for about a decade. It was once a prosperous and developed land under Mazwian rule, but the yetis ruined it, driving thousands into misery and poverty. Now that Zar-Hay has liberated Zwahile, it can be restored to its former glory with the aid of King Azkhai."
SON_royal_navy:0 "Found The Royal Navy"
SON_royal_navy_desc:0 "Zar-Hay technically already had a navy, consisting of river canoes and smaller vessels. The new Royal Navy however will be a proper oceanic military force, now that the Kingdom finally owns some coastline. Its duty will be to guard the coasts and the vital shipping lanes to the rest of the world."
SON_steel_chariots:0 "Self-Propelled Steel Chariots"
SON_steel_chariots_desc:0 "Long ago, chariots were used by the zebras of the Great Lakes for waging war. Now, chariots are making a return, but in a very different form. Known abroad as "tanks", these vehicles are made of steel, have a large gun and use engines and tracks to move forward at great velocity. They would make a fine addition to the arsenal of the Royal Army."
SON_worker_protection:0 "Protect The Workers"
SON_worker_protection_desc:0 "The economy of Zar-Hay went through growing pains, but it has now matured. There is no need to withhold proper salaries from hard-working labourers who were the true architects of modernity. By official decree, the King will ensure every worker receives their due. Those employers who take advantage of them or abuse them will be punished."
SON_universal_education:0 "The Royal Library"
SON_universal_education_desc:0 "King Azkhai wants Zar-Hay to be a truly civilized Kingdom. As such, he plans to establish a new grand library in Zao with the support of the scholars. Literature of all kinds will be acquired from abroad, translated and stored there for any zebra to read freely. Knowledge is not a privilege for the few, but a right for all."
SON_secure_the_borders:0 "Secure The Borders"
SON_secure_the_borders_desc:0 "Every zebra in Zar-Hay wishes for everlasting peace, but that can only be possible if the borders are secured. Any hostile regimes should be dealt with swiftly, while diplomatic negotiations should be held with the more reasonable governments."
SON_my_work_here_is_done:0 "My Work Here Is Done"
SON_my_work_here_is_done_desc:0 "King Azkhai The Great has done much for Zar-Hay, ruling with wisdom and benevolence. Yet no zebra can rule forever. He is old, and time is deteriorating his body. It is becoming clearer and clearer that he cannot remain as King. He has therefore decided to abdicate, and allow one of his heirs to succeed him."

SON_get_rid_of_pretenders_desc:0 "There are two claimants to the throne who seek to claim it from the rightful heir of Azkhai The Great, [Root.GetLeader]. They are endangering the stability of the Kingdom with their misguided and treacherous behaviour. Getting rid of them is the only way to ensure peace and order. It is always a shame when close relatives have to resort to violence..."

SON_money_desc:0 "Now that Muza is King, he has the right to tax his subjects. And tax them he will, to his heart's content. There won't be a single transaction or hidden hoard in the Kingdom that will go untaxed. Only when Muza will become the richest zebra in the world, will he be happy. No, the richest creature..."

SON_prospect_for_gold_desc:0 "It is well known that the gold in Buckure mines is running dangerously low. But surely there are more deposits of this valuable resource, hidden deep underground? The King will do everything in his power to support extensive prospecting of the area. Surely they will find a very rich vein of the precious yellow metal."
SON_turning_lead_into_gold:0 "Turning Lead Into Gold"
SON_turning_lead_into_gold_desc:0 "There is a legend of an alchemical trick that can turn lead into gold. But what if this legend could be made into reality? The King will generously fund the Kingdom's potion brewers so they can try and discover the secret formula of great prosperity. Of course, if their experiments end up unveiling other kinds of potions that can be useful too."
SON_beginning_of_golden_age:0 "Beginning Of A Golden Age"
SON_beginning_of_golden_age_desc:0 "King Muza has established solid foundations for his reign. Now he can fully embrace his new role as the supreme ruler of the Great Lakes. He is young, so he is expected to rule it for many decades to come. Great wealth and prosperity are expected to bless the Kingdom, and especially the King himself."
SON_feudalism_basically:0 "Reward Supporters"
SON_feudalism_basically_desc:0 "Zin swayed many zebras to her side by whispering sweet promises into their ears. Now that she is Queen, these promises must be fulfilled.

SON_a_splendid_court:0 "A Splendid Court"
SON_a_splendid_court_desc:0 "A proper Queen should have a resplendent court, filled with interesting and influential individual who flock around her Majesty.

SON_glorify_the_queen_desc:0 "Every zebra in the Kingdom should know that Zin is an even better ruler than Azkhai ever was. He was called "the Great" but soon she will be known as "the Greatest"! Propaganda will be widely distributed to make sure all her subjects know what a wonderful ruler she is, and in every way superior to her brother, who even managed to lose his throne. How embarrassing!"
SON_overshadowing_azkhai:0 "Overshadowing Azkhai"
SON_overshadowing_azkhai_desc:0 "Zin's reign will be glorious. Many zebras praise Azkhai and have fond memories of him, but he was nothing compared to his sister!

SON_proclaim_godhood:0 "Proclaim Godhood"
SON_proclaim_godhood_desc:0 "Bene is not only the King of Zar-Hay, but God himself. All must know of his divine status and become his faithful followers! Those who deny his divinity, those who doubt his prophecies, will not survive the dimensional merge when it inevitably comes."

SON_enforce_the_cult_desc:0 "There are many who do not believe the words of the King. How dare they doubt him? He is a prophet blessed by wisdom, who can see the future.

SON_prepare_for_dimensional_merge_desc:0 "The Dimensional Merge is an apocalyptic metaphysical event that has been foretold by the great prophet, Bene Zughe.

SON_a_harmonious_society_desc:0 "Despite being made out of many different cultures and many different social classes, the kingdom of Zar-Hay prides itself on its peaceful society.

SON_form_alliance:0 "Form The Grand Alliance"
SON_form_alliance_desc:0 "It is not enough to simply protect neighbouring states. They should be invited into a true, formal cooperative alliance.

SON_rally_labourers_desc:0 "What keeps the lower castes servile and dormant? Their lack of greater consciousness and inability to organize.

More is needed, but thankfully our enemy has stockpiled plenty of weapons. And the zebras who work in the warehouses are more often than not eager to help our soldiers with "borrowing"..."

SON_forward_unto_modernity_desc:0 "The former rulers of Zar-Hay claimed to be modernizing the Great Lakes, but in truth were only implementing surface-level changes that did not bring true change to society. The revolution cannot be complete until the old ways are uprooted thoroughly. To accomplish this, much work needs to be done."
SON_civilize_the_masses:0 "Civilize The Masses"
SON_civilize_the_masses_desc:0 "The old order was maintained by the ignorant majority of the population. True modernity requires elevation of consciousness, not just in terms of class awareness.

SON_the_new_generation_desc:0 "The former leadership of the army of Zar-Hay comprised of aristocrats and loyalists to the old order.

SON_urbanization_desc:0 "With increased automation, many zebras in the countryside are left without work. They can now be relocated to urban centers to work in factories and provide services. Countless new homes will be made, mass produced on an industrial scale. Mudhuts will be torn down, and blocks of concrete and glass will rise like mushrooms in the rain."
SON_cultural_rebirth:0 "Cultural Rebirth"
SON_cultural_rebirth_desc:0 "It is time to leave our barbaric past behind, and instead look onwards to a bright future, lit by incandescent light bulbs! We should strive to emulate more advanced nations of the world in every way, embracing their way of living fully. Mass media, twelve-hour shift work, asphalt streets, latest fashion, smoke of tobacco... we need to have it all."
SON_wings_of_steel:0 "Wings Of Steel"
SON_wings_of_steel_desc:0 "Uncivilized zebras can only dream about flying, but advanced nations can make it a reality. A modern aerodrome will be constructed in Zano, an air force founded as part of the military, and a state-owned commission established to organize production of aircraft. Nothing will be beyond the reach of our revolution."
SON_avalanche_of_steel:0 "The Roar Of Engines"
SON_avalanche_of_steel_desc:0 "Wars are no longer won by masses of infantry, but by an overwhelming amount of machines armed with the latest weaponry. As such, it is vital that the nation develops a capability to produce them and train the soldiers of the Revolutionary Army to use them."
SON_coca_cola_2:0 "The Drink Of The Proletariat"
SON_coca_cola_2_desc:0 "Alcohol is poison, there is no doubt about that. As a healthier alternative, a war veteran zebra has proposed a carbonated soft drink made from kola nuts. Nyaberi has personally approved of its flavour, so the state will acquire the patent for the drink and begin its mass production. Bright red bottles will hopefully encourage the workers to drink it."

SON_cult_of_the_machine_desc:0 "The world has been transformed into a single, monstrous fantastic perpetually moving machine, into a single huge non-animal automatic organism.

SON_our_former_benefactors:0 "Our Former Benefactors"
SON_our_former_benefactors_desc:0 "The Re'emites previously provided some support to our movement, albeit they did so in secret. They wanted us to overthrow the regime that ruled over the Great Lakes, and we did so. Yet for some reason, they thought we wouldn't overthrow their own government in return. Their lands are highly developed and would make a fine addition to the state."
SON_kill_czr:0 "Liberate The East"

SON_lingua_franca:0 "A Common Language"
SON_lingua_franca_desc:0 "There are hundreds of languages spoken in the Great Lakes, but to facilitate exchange of information, various trade tongues have traditionally been used. One of them, Mazwian, reached widespread usage during the rule of the Imperial Mazwi. By making it an official state language that is taught in schools, we will unite the disparate peoples of the Great Lakes."
SON_kill_yeti_com:0 "Liberate The South"
SON_kill_yeti_com_desc:0 "The despicable yeti are inherently reactionary, backwards and violent. They can never be trusted after what they did to half of Zebrica. As such, they must be crushed before it is too late. The zebras of the south yearn for freedom, and we shall give it to them."
SON_country_roads:0 "Speeding Towards The Future"
SON_country_roads_desc:0 "Roads of dirt or gravel are not sufficient for motor vehicles. Paved asphalt roads are needed, crossing the country and connecting all major settlements. Such a large construction project will provide thousands of jobs and, upon completion, will make the lives of the common zebra that much easier."
SON_the_flame_bearers:0 "The Flame Bearers"
SON_the_flame_bearers_desc:0 "A group of artists and writers has been formed known as "The Flame Bearers" who advocate for Great Lakes to abandon its backwards past and embrace influences from industrialization, urbanization and modern art. Their motto is "Windows open to Equestria" and their works are imbued with machine romanticism, exoticism and vitalism."
SON_kill_mgy:0 "Secure The Neighle"
SON_kill_mgy_desc:0 "Much of the Neighle river is already under our control, except for the most important part: its estuary. Seizing it will open a new trade route directly to the northern oceans, allowing us to directly connect with the modern world. Not only that, but Maregyptian industry will make a fine addition to the economy."
SON_crystallization:0 "Crystallization"
SON_crystallization_desc:0 "Magical crystals are rare in the Great Lakes, but a source of them can be found in the Anega ridge. With these crystals, many wondrous technological applications become possible. No time should be wasted in expanding the exploitation of crystals."

SON_resources_desc:0 ""Resources exist to be consumed. And consumed they will be, if not by this generation then by some future.

Prospectors will be sent across the Great Lakes and new state-owned mining corporations will be established."
SON_mass_media:0 "Anything And Everything, All Of The Time"
SON_mass_media_desc:0 "What is modernity without a thriving entertainment industry? With widespread usage of the radio and establishment of cinemas in major cities, the foundations are laid out for companies to provide an endless stream of content that can be consumed during free time."
SON_com_navy_crap:0 "A Navy Of Two Seas"
SON_com_navy_crap_desc:0 "With the perfectly justified seizure of Maregypt, the state now spans from one sea to another. This will require the foundation of two fleets under one navy, so both coasts can be guarded. Not only that, but it is vital to secure the trade routes and overseas connections to the advanced nations of the world."
SON_rocket_shit:0 "Pierce The Skies"
SON_rocket_shit_desc:0 "It was once believed that the Sky Stallion resided above the clouds. If this is true, then he will be very surprised when the latest technological marvels, high-velocity rockets, rise far above the clouds and into the upper stratosphere. Eventually, these rockets will allow us to travel beyond our planet, but for now they function perfectly as long-range weapons."
SON_abyssinian_question:0 "The Abyssinian Question"
SON_abyssinian_question_desc:0 "Abyssinia is a land rich in resources yet prone to mismanaged exploitation by the current owners. Clearly, Abyssinia would be better off as part of the Revolutionary State. Unfortunately, they might not be able to comprehend our proposal, and as such we need to prepare for war."
SON_withering_away:0 "Withering Away Of The State"
SON_withering_away_desc:0 ""The interference of the state power in social relations becomes superfluous in one sphere after another, and then ceases of itself. The government of persons is replaced by the administration of things and the direction of the processes of production. The state is not "abolished", it withers away.""

SON_in_marks_we_trust:0 "In Marks We Trust"
SON_in_marks_we_trust_desc:0 "Caramel Marks was a brilliant philosopher and political theorist who understood the grand narratives of history. What Nyaberi Zargey has done is a subversion of her theories, an attempt to enforce an early revolution and then exploit it to implement her own twisted vision of "socialism". Thankfully, Nyaberi sits behind bars and our future is safe."
SON_close_the_borders:0 "Protect Domestic Workers"
SON_close_the_borders_desc:0 "To quote Marks: "The bourgeoisie [...] has set up that single, unconscionable freedom – free trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation". We can no longer allow foreign traders to take advantage of the precious labour of the working class!"
SON_collectivization:0 "End Private Ownership"
SON_collectivization_desc:0 "Nyaberi's government never explicitly banned private ownership, despite transfering most property to state-owned companies. Nationalization is not enough: we must proceed with the socialization of the economy. It is vital that surplus product is distributed fairly to the workers and that workplace hierarchies are swiftly eroded."
SON_eat_the_rich:0 "Butcher The Bourgeoisie"
SON_eat_the_rich_desc:0 "Nyaberi was unable to set her personal biases aside and thus spared her relatives who were merchants. We will not be so merciful. As Marks wrote: "there is only one way in which the murderous death agonies of the old society and the bloody birth throes of the new society can be shortened, simplified and concentrated, and that way is revolutionary terror.""
SON_rational_management:0 "Rational Management"
SON_rational_management_desc:0 "A truly modern economy does not rely on the market to decide the worth of commodities and individuals, but on calculation based on labour theory of value. Hard work will be rewarded, allowing exceptional persons to thrive, while others still get everything they need to live a comfortable life."
SON_free_public_services:0 "Free Public Services"
SON_free_public_services_desc:0 "For now, the state must exist for the simple reason of redistributing surplus value to those who need it most - the sick, the young, the disabled and the elderly. Only a society that takes care of all its members can truly prosper."
SON_scientific_socialism:0 "Scientific Socialism"
SON_scientific_socialism_desc:0 "A government that gains its sovereignty not through force or monopoly on violence, but through reason, justice, and equality, its a truly advanced government. As such, the peak of the intellectual development of a society is scientific socialism, which we must now seek to implement."
SON_proletarian_democracy:0 "Proletarian Democracy"
SON_proletarian_democracy_desc:0 "True democracy abolishes hierarchy in the workplace and sees communism as the true embodiment of itself. As Marks did not outline the exact form of a revolutionary society, we must democratically decide it ourselves, allowing history to take its natural course."
SON_state_atheism:0 "The Soul Of Soulless Conditions"
SON_state_atheism_desc:0 "Marks famously called religion "the opium of the masses", and she was right about it. Religion is a coping mechanism of the poor, and a tool of the rich used to oppress them. All temples shall be torn down or repurposed. Illusory happiness of the people will be replaced with real happiness."
SON_path_to_pure_communism:0 "The Path To Pure Communism"
SON_path_to_pure_communism_desc:0 "With full automation of all means of production, public ownership can be replaced with common ownership, allowing communism to crystallize and form naturally. With a superabundance of goods, everything can be freely distributed based on the need of individuals. A true utopia of sapient flourishing finally becomes possible."

All they have to do is accept the changes that are taking place."
SON_shareholder_principle:0 "The Shareholder Principle"
SON_shareholder_principle_desc:0 "As there is no state, there is no such thing as citizenship. However, companies are offering shares at a cheap price which provide similar privileges, as shareholders will be able to vote on any decisions made in the company. Of course, there is no limit to how many shares an individual can purchase. Why would there be?"

SON_corporate_security_forces_desc:0 "With the Revolutionary Army and the Guardians Of The Revolution no longer having an owner, they are being auctioned off to the highest bidder.

The soldiers and officers will be happy to know their salaries will rise dramatically."
SON_great_neighle_dam:0 "The Great Neighle Dam"
SON_great_neighle_dam_desc:0 "Damming the Neighle river might sound like an insane idea, but what is truly insane is the amount of energy that could potentially be produced.

SON_port_of_rataphet_desc:0 "The city of R'ataphet, located in the Neighle delta, is our gateway to the wider world. It is vital to expand its port facilities to facilitate ever increasing amounts of international trade. It will also become a fine base for the company commerce protection fleets. Once the locals see the benefits of corporate rule, they will happily embrace it."
SON_striving_for_perfect_competition:0 "Striving For Perfect Competition"
SON_striving_for_perfect_competition_desc:0 "Modernity is driven by innovation, which is driven by competition, which is driven by scarcity. A society where everyone gets what they need to survive is a stagnant one. We must never stop striving for ideal market conditions, even if they are never actually reached, so we can maximise allocative and productive efficiency."
SON_moar_land:0 "Forceful Land Acquisition"
SON_moar_land_desc:0 "With economic long-term strategy in mind, it is vital to gain access to the Arabian Sea and secure control of the rivers which flow down from Abyssinia. Using corporate security forces to seize the vital natural harbors of Assur, Farasrah and Mane'a will be worth all the expenses."

SON_efficient_guys:0 "Work Smarter, Not Harder"
SON_efficient_guys_desc:0 "Good performance at work should be rewarded, while laziness, inefficiency, corruption and so on should be punished.

SON_bad_guys_desc:0 "Let's be honest here for once, we don't give a buck about the employees or anyone else. We only care about one thing: profit. Sweet, ambrosian, shining profit. To cook an omelette, you have to break a few eggs. But we are cooking the mother of all omelettes here, so we'll have to break a lot of eggs. That is a sacrifice we are more than willing to make."
SON_a_bright_future:0 "A Bright Future"
SON_a_bright_future_desc:0 "There is no doubt that company rule has led to the beginning of a new golden age, far more resplendent than the despotic reigns of Zar-Hay or Mazwi. We are finally considered one of the most wealthy and advanced nations in the world, even without a state to run things.

### Events ###

zarhay.1.t:0 "The Chiefs Arrive"
zarhay.1.d:0 "Chief Quaggo arrived at the capital of Zao accompanied by his retinue of advisors and servants. He comfortably lied on his palanquin as his slaves carried it through the busy streets of the capital. He was not the only chief in town, clearly, as he saw many other chiefs and their entourages on his way to the Royal Palace.\n\nAfter they arrived, Quaggo got down from his seat and ordered his servants to do what he had told them to do earlier. The courtyard of the palace, located on the shore of Lake Zao, was filled with the many chiefs of Zar-Hay who were all chattering with one another. Soon enough, Quaggo himself would chatter as he saw his good friend, Chieftess Amzina. They exchanged formal pleasantries before engaging in more serious discussion.\n"What do you think the Regent is up to?" Quaggo asked from the mare adorned in gold.\n"He'll gather us in a room so he can kill us all at once, then seize total control," Amzina said with a smirk.\nQuaggo narrowed his eyes. "Very funny. I wanted to have a serious talk with you."\n"Fine then. To be honest, I'm not sure what to expect. One way or another, he will want to secure his rule."\n"I suppose we shall see. Earlier, I told my servants to do some investigating, just in case Zonni is plotting something God-forsaken."\n"You're being paranoid, silly. As always."\n"How can we trust him? He is half-Mazwian."\nAmzina rolled her eyes. "Let's just go to the meeting and see what happens, alright?""
zarhay.1.a:0 "Wonder what he's up to?"

zarhay.2.t:0 "Zonni's Dream"
zarhay.2.d:0 "A royal slave came out of the palace, beating a djembe drum with his hoof. The chiefs in the courtyard went silent and turned to look. Then Zonni appeared, eyeing at the crowd of chiefs closely, as if he was trying to read their thoughts, and walked up to a raised dais in front of the palace. There was a golden seat on it, but only Kings and Queens could sit there, so Zonni simply stood alongside it. He then addressed the gathered aristocrats.\n\n"Esteemed chiefs of Zar-Hay! I have summoned you here for a good reason. I have a dream, and to fulfill it, I need your unquestionable loyalty. It is not just any dream, but a dream of making Zar-Hay a truly mighty Kingdom! Long have we been subjugated, treated like slaves no matter what caste we belonged to, extorted and robbed by foreigners. We have lost our glory, our wealth and even our royalty. All this is disheartening, but I refuse to be disheartened! We should not simply sit idly as a golden opportunity presents itself. The Sky Stallion has paved the way to redeem ourselves; all we must do is walk down this sacred path. That is what I intend to do.\n\nThe Mazwian Empire has collapsed. The Storm King is no more. Now there is a power vacuum in the Great Lakes, which lies fractured and weak. Now is our chance to strike with our warriors, to forge a mighty empire surpassing Mazwi in its glory. This way, the Zar-Hay will no longer be slaves, but masters forever!"\n\nThe chiefs looked at each other quietly. Then, one of them began stomping the ground with their hooves. This began to spread as more and more chiefs showed their support for Zonni and his dream. In the end, even sceptics like Quaggo couldn't help but follow the herd and do the same.\n\nWhen Zonni saw this, he grinned. Finally, the chiefs were on his side."
zarhay.2.a:0 "We shall become great!"

zarhay.3.t:0 "A Wandering Warrior"
zarhay.3.d:0 "It seemed word of Zonni's ambitions had spread quickly, because a warrior claiming to come from a distant land requested audience with the Regent. Zonni, always in need of capable soldiers, agreed to meet him.\n\nThe warrior introduced himself as Ture Sylla and said he had fought under many rulers over the years in return for pay. Now he offered his experience and skill to Zonni, because he believed he would be victorious in the coming wars of unification, and wanted to be on the winning side.\n\nZonni was very tempted by this offer, but he wondered what the chiefs would think if he allowed a foreigner to lead their troops into battle? Perhaps it wasn't worthwhile, as he didn't want to lose their trust. Then again, a competent leader like Ture Sylla was just what he needed to aid him in his conquests."
zarhay.3.a:0 "He will be useful to us."
zarhay.3.b:0 "We have no need for him."

zarhay.4.t:0 "Ancestral Shame"
zarhay.4.d:0 "The speech had been successful and Zonni had gained the loyalty of the chiefs. As long as he would lead the army into battle to subjugate Zar-Hay's neighbours, the chiefs were willing to support him.\n\nAfter the feast following the meeting, Zonni left the city proper and travelled alone to a large field. There were many grassy mounds there, where the Kings and Queens and mighty chiefs lied entombed forever. He walked past them, to the burial ground of lesser chiefs, to the grave of his late father.\n\nHe sat on the ground and mumbled a quiet prayer to his ancestors, then began to speak to his father.\n"It appears as if I have finally gained their trust, father. But I know I have not. They are merely giving me another chance to prove that I truly am a Zar-Hay. But it is ridiculous, is it not? I had to promise so much to gain so little. And even if I succeed, will they accept me? Or will they still reject me, refusing to trust me because of my mother?"\nHe let out a deep sigh. "Sometimes I wonder why you married a Mazwian mare. It has brought our family nothing but shame and trouble. Perhaps it was just blind, foolish love. Or a gamble, which would've paid off had the Mazwian Empire not utterly collapsed. Either way, I do not judge you, father. I just wish I knew why, that is all."\nThere was a gust of wind. His father was answering, but he wasn't sure he understood. Perhaps his father was ashamed to tell the full truth?\n"I apologize for my curiosity. Don't feel pressured to answer. I will still love you, father, no matter what happens. And I promise to you, I will restore our family's lost honour. I will bring judgement upon our enemies. Our family won't have petty chiefs anymore but... an Emperor."\nWind howled in the darkness as the sun set. Zonni took this as a warning. "I will be careful, don't worry. I am no weakling anymore. Once I have gained total victory, I will return. I promise."\nHe humbly prostrated himself before the grave, and the wind calmed, becoming a pleasant breeze."
zarhay.4.a:0 "Once I come back, I will be a true Zar-Hay."

zarhay.5.t:0 "The Praise-Singers"
zarhay.5.d:0 "Fassa Balleke was a famed griot, whose ancestors had been in the court of the Zar-Hay monarch. But ever since the Mazwian invasion, they had lived in exile, wandering the land and entertaining countless chiefs and petty kings. When the Regent of Zar-Hay offered her a position in his court, she was at first sceptical, as griots traditionally served rulers, not mere regents. But in these tumultuous times, she couldn't simply refuse a job offer like that.\n\nWhen she arrived at the Royal Palace, she quickly realized she wasn't the only griot who had been invited there. Some of the griots she recognized, yet others appeared obscure and unpopular. The Regent had cast a very wide net in his search for griots.\n\nThen Zonni came out to meet them. "Greetings, honoured griots, and welcome to the Royal Palace! These walls have not heard your music or song in so many years, yet this shall now change. I know some of you may be wondering why a mere Regent would have a need for you. No, I do not intend to become King. However, I do need your aid. You see, I need popular support for my grand unification campaigns which I have planned. I need talented speakers and entertainers like you to spread the word among the commoners, glorifying my rule, drumming up support for my cause and recording my deeds for the future generations. In return, I will offer you a generous share of the spoils of war. I swear on the Spirits that you will become rich."\n\nTo some it might have seemed like an unpleasant job, but for Fassa it was nothing out of the ordinary. Such was the usual duty of the griot caste. However, in her heart she feared that the Regent's gamble would fail, that he would be defeated and his griots enslaved. But as she looked around the Palace, she felt like she was finally back home. She prayed to God, and stepped forth to accept Zonni as her new patron."
zarhay.5.a:0 "Our fates are now entwined."

zarhay.6.t:0 "The Wind-Singers"
zarhay.6.d:0 "Zonni uncovered his head as he entered a hallowed sanctuary of the Wind-Singers. The white-robed priests inside nodded in greeting. "We have expected you, scion of Zolon," the eldest of the priests said.\nZonni raised an eyebrow. "How? I did not inform you of my arrival."\n"The Spirits told us. They also said you've come to see the future."\n"Yes. If the Spirits told you that, then clearly I can trust you to conduct a divination and reveal my fate to me."\nOne of the other priests shook her head. "Fate is fickle. Visions are unclear. Future is always in flux."\n"The further away we look, the harder it becomes to see," the eldest priest added. "But perhaps the Spirits are in a generous mood today."\n"I pray it is so," Zonni replied. "Please, tell me if my dream is doomed to fail, if I should bother waging war in the first place. That is all I wish to know."\nThe priests looked at one another, then nodded. "Then come, to conduct a proper divination we must do so in the open," the eldest said.\n\nThe zebras left the sanctuary and walked to a nearby open field. They spread out a pure white cloth with painted markings and symbols on the grass. One of the priests had brought with him a pouch, which he gave to the eldest Wind-Singer. The priests stood and waited for the wind to pick up, and when there was a gust of wind, the priests hummed and the eldest one threw out the contents of the pouch into the wind. Bone fragments, gemstones, amulets and carved dice were scattered by the wind onto the cloth. As the wind died down, so did the humming of the priests. The eldest one then sat down in front of the cloth and began to study the pattern created by the objects.\n"What do you see, elder?" Zonni asked, curious and eager.\nThe eldest furrowed his brow. "I see... a dead lion," he said and pointed at several items on the cloth. "And a white-backed vulture, swooping in to feast on its flesh."\nZonni's eyes widened. "I see what this means. The lion is Mazwi and I am the vulture!"\nThe eldest narrowed his eyes. "But then a hidden hunter appears from the bush and scares the vulture away, claiming the lion's remains."\nZonni frowned. "Hrm. Sounds like I need to be careful, or I will lose it all."\n"You are interpreting the signs well enough," the eldest said. "But remember what was said. The future is not set in stone. The vulture may yet feast on the lion."\nZonni nodded, and smiled confidently."
zarhay.6.a:0 "It is a good sign, thank God."

zarhay.7.t:0 "New Tools Of Death"
zarhay.7.d:0 "Gunsmiths were among the most respected members of the artisan caste, capable of assembling intricate weaponry from metal. Before, they had made fine swords of steel, but in recent decades they had learned to make muskets instead. In this time of rapid change, they would have to adapt yet again.\n\nZonni entered the courtyard of the gunsmith's workshop, where the local guild masters and their students were already waiting. On his back, Zonni carried a weapon which immediately attracted the attention of the smiths. He stopped in front of the audience members, who bowed in respect, and took out the gun. "Greetings, esteemed gunsmiths. Do any of you know what this is?"\nThe gunsmiths looked at each other in doubt. "Is it some kind of musket?" one of them asked.\nZonni chuckled. "Almost correct. This, my friends, is a rifle. Allow me to demonstrate how it works." He motioned to his servants who brought out a blindfolded female prisoner into the courtyard, guiding it to stand in front of a mudbrick wall. It was a slave who had tried to kill its owner and had thus been condemned to death.\n\nZonni stood up on his hind legs, loaded the rifle, took aim and fired. A loud bang echoed in the courtyard as the slave dropped dead in an instant. The gunsmiths looked in awe, their mouths wide open. Zonni smiled as he turned to face them again. "As you can see, it is far more accurate than a musket and produces less smoke. I have spent a fortune acquiring these from a dealer in Tobuck. Your task will be to dismantle and study this weapon, so we may learn to make it ourselves. I trust you will do a fine job in service to the Kingdom, and receive a handsome reward in return." Zonni gave the rifle to the nearest gunsmith, who prostrated herself on the ground, deeply grateful."
zarhay.7.a:0 "May God bless these weapons."

zarhay.8.t:0 "Zonni Zolon Vows To Protect Re'emites"
zarhay.8.d:0 "In a strange turn of events, Zonni Zolon, the Regent of the Kingdom of Zar-Hay, has sworn to protect Re'emites from any outside aggression. This pledge of protection extends to any Re'emite minorities living within territory under Zar-Hay control.\n\nHowever, he was quick to make it clear that he is not doing this out of the goodness of his heart, and said Re'em would have to provide his nation aid in return. This help did not have to be military in nature, as Re'em could help develop the underdeveloped country in return and work to eliminate poverty. [Root.GetLeader] has accepted this, as Re'em has already done much to aid the zebras of the Great Lakes. Besides, if Zonni grows stronger, he will be a powerful ally for Re'em, ensuring its survival in the future."
zarhay.8.a:0 "Thank you..?"

zarhay.9.t:0 "A Worthy Sacrifice"
zarhay.9.d:0 "Zonni had ordered a sacrificial ceremony to be held by the priesthood of Zao in preparation for the wars he was about to wage. The Wind-Singers got to work and Zonni assumed he did not need to get involved himself. However, one of the priests approached him and requested him to decide what would be sacrificed. Traditionally, it had been the decision of the Kings and Queens, but as Zonni was the royal regent, the responsibility was now on his shoulders.\n\nZonni pondered deeply, for the decision was vital. If the right sacrifice was not made, the spirits would be displeased and cast a curse on him. On the other hoof, if he chose correctly, then the spirits would bless his ambitions and further ensure he'd prevail on the battlefield. The most important spirits to appease were Zabera, grandfather of war, Muawri, god of the hunt, and Zargitau, the founder of Zao and the progenitor of Zar-Hay.\n\nThe custom offering consisted of fresh kola nuts, divided into four lobes. Zabera was known to be especially fond of the bittersweet seeds. But Zonni was unsure if this was a fitting sacrifice, as the coming wars weren't a mere skirmish or raid, and possibly required a greater sacrifice. Dogs were favourite animals of Zargitau and close companions of Muawri, so they'd be pleased by such a offering. Yet even this did not feel like enough. Perhaps a grand sacrifice was in place, to truly impress the spirits and show them that Zonni was in great need of their blessing? For that, 444 slaves would suffice. It was a sacred number and ritual killings of slaves were acceptable in Zar-Hay society. But perhaps it was too much...\n\nEventually, Zonni finally made the decision and revealed it to the Wind-Singers."

zarhay.10.d:0 "As far as Zonni was concerned, every capable zebra in the Kingdom was a potential soldier. As the clouds of war were gathering, so too would the levied troops of Zar-Hay. They would provide crucial support for the more professional royal retinue and the chieftains' personal armies. Zonni had done much work in preparation to organize the mustering of soldiers, hiring administrators, establishing a regional command hierarchy and bribing the right zebras to ensure it would go smoothly. He was not inventing everything new, of course, just renovating the old levy system of the Kingdom that had not been used since before the Mazwians had ended their independence centuries ago.\n\nSoon, the war drums were beaten across the nation and zebras were called to arms. Many began gathering in the centers of their towns and villages where Zonni's commanders were overseeing the mustering. Each zebra brought their own equipment and rations, many armed with crude muskets, swords, spears or bows. Units were formed and the conscripts were assigned officers from the ranks of the aristocracy. Then these units would march to Zao, where the levies would swear allegiance to the Regent.\n\nZonni was proud to see thousands of soldiers gathering in the capital. The mustering had gone well, and while many villages had now lost able-bodied workers, they'd be back home eventually. Dead or alive. What mattered to Zonni was that his army was now strong enough to face the challenges ahead of them."

Unlike them, however, the prophet did not seem afraid. His face was emotionless, his eyes determined. This stallion did not fear death, it seemed.\n\nZonni approached him, looking at the fanatic with disdain. "Speak if you will, for soon you will no longer be able to do so."\n"I have nothing to say to you; but I ask God to forgive you for your sins, for you are misguided."\n"Misguided? You are the one who is misguided! You wished to force the zebras of the Great Lakes to all follow your ways of worship, regardless of their own traditions."\nThe prophet ignored him as he closed his eyes. "I have nothing to fear. The flames cannot hurt me. I am with God, and God is with me."\nThe Regent grimaced, almost in disgust. "If God was with you, then why did you lose?"\n\nHe received no response as the prophet continued to mumble his prayers. Zonni rolled his eyes and turned to his warriors, who were holding lit torches. "The time has come! Let us get rid of these lost souls. They are beyond redemption."\n\nThe soldiers nodded and ignited the piles of dry branches at the base of each stake. The fires spread quickly, engulfing the prophet and his followers. One by one, they each began screaming from pain, except for the prophet who was completely silent even as his coat began burning. But in the end, he too screamed and begged for Zonni's forgiveness. The Regent simply glared back. Now he was the one who refused to respond."

One of Faran's servants advised him to cover his muzzle while he was inside, as the Chief had recently been brewing potions. The Regent did so and followed the servant as she guided him to the meeting chamber.\n\nThere, Faran was already waiting, seated on a cushion with a stoic face. Zonni sat down in front of him and the Chief offered him kola nuts, a traditional gift of hospitality. The Regent humbly accepted.\n"You know why I come here, so let us bypass the formalities. How can I convince you to provide your skills of sorcery in service to the Kingdom?"\nFaran said nothing, simply glaring at him. Zonni frowned and almost took it as an insult, before Faran suddenly burst into laughter. "He who asks, shall receive!"\nZonni blinked in confusion, then regained his composure. "Well, that is what I am doing now."\n"But what do you ask for? I have many skills that can be used in many ways. Are you in need of my potions, or my knowledge of the arcane?"\nZonni raised an eyebrow. "Can you not provide both?"\n"Do not be greedy, despite your status. You may ask for one thing, and you shall receive it. What will it be?" Faran grinned.\n\nThe Regent pondered for a while before answering. Faran's potions would be greatly useful, empowering the warriors of the army, but his abilities as a sorcerer could be used to instead empower the state. Part of him wanted to simply demand both, but even he did not dare to arouse the wrath of a zebra who could cast a curse to break his back."

Pamphlets were spread among the literate populace, exposing Zonni Zolon as an illiterate, half-Mazwian tyrant, claiming he also dabbled in forbidden sorcery.\n\nWhen Zonni heard of this, his blood began to boil. While the claim about him being a sorcerer was a lie, everything else was truth. The foolish scholars used the truth as a weapon, striking him where it hurt. As a result of the campaign, the populace of Timbucktu were encouraged to resist the foreign occupier and threaten the newly established peace in the region.\n\nZonni would not stand for this. No one could mock him without facing the consequences. In his fury, he ordered the teachers and professors of the university to be rounded up and imprisoned for inciting a revolt against him. The most prominent scholars would be tortured or executed, while the university's printing presses were to be shattered with hammers and the city's libraries burned with fire. The wealth of the merchants would be confiscated so they would become beggars, unable to fund any resistance. Zonni's faithful warriors obeyed and carried out his commands. A dark pillar of smoke soon rose from the heart of Timbucktu.\n\nIf they wanted him to be a monster, then he'd become one."

zarhay.14.d:0 "Chieftess Meynsata of the Zibiridugu tribe was above all a warrior, but even she had a code of honour. Therefore she treated prisoners of war well and was merciful upon the defeated. When Zonni Zolon launched his reprisals against the zebras of Timbucktu, Meynsata couldn't help but question his actions. Zonni was fond of her, so she was not afraid of potentially angering him.\n\nWhen Meynsata met with him and asked why he was so ruthless against the Timbucktuans, Zonni sighed and said he'd tell a story from his youth.\n"When I was a mere colt, I was weak and pathetic. Other foals saw my weakness and thus abused me, making fun of my mixed blood and trampling me with their hooves. When I told my parents about this, my Mazwian mother said that I should turn the other cheek so the Sky Stallion would see my moral superiority. Of course, that did nothing. When I returned with a bloodied muzzle, my Zar-Hay father told me to strike back with twice the fury. Even if I was weak, it did not matter. I had to show them that mistreating me would have consequences.\n\n"So I faced the bullies again, but when they mocked me I mocked them back, calling them sons and daughters of donkeys. They beat me, and I struck back. While I was weak, they saw I was no longer a pushover. Their bullying continued for a while until they realized that it wasn't worth it. Slowly, they even began to fear and respect me. No one has dared to bully me ever since. This is why I strike back with twice the fury at anyone who mocks me or conspires against me. The bullies learned this, and now the Timbucktuans did, too."\n\nMeynsata nodded slowly. "But are the Timbucktuans not the ones being bullied? You conquered their city, after all."\nZonni clenched his jaw as if she had just punched him. "That does not justify their lies and mockery!"\n"Please, try to empathize with your new subjects and temper your ego," Meynsata said, and tried to offer a smile. "Our enemies may have more in common with us than you admit."\nHe said nothing in response."

zarhay.15.d:0 "Zonni was in Zongola, seated on the throne of the King of Alwani. He looked down upon Euzegoar as he was brought before him in chains. The zebra's spirit was broken, yet Zonni could sense a tiny flame of defiance as Euzegoar glared at him. The Regent stood up.\n"Your majesty, it is unfortunate that I cannot let you go free, as your supporters are... hesitant to accept defeat. Therefore I have to deal with you to dissuade their resistance."\n"Such audacity," Euzegoar spat out. "First you subjugate my subjects, then you plan to commit regicide to secure your unjust rule?"\n"My rule is just, as I have secured it with the strength of my army. Mighty empires are forged with violence and their right to rule comes from victory. As for 'regicide', well, that would require you to still be a King, wouldn't it?"\nEuzegoar's face twisted in hatred. "Truly, you have Mazwian blood in your veins, as you are bent on oppression and subjugation. Fine then, deal with me as you see fit. The Storm King would be proud of your lack of mercy."\nZonni narrowed his eyes. He felt an urge to behead him immediately with his sword, but at the same time he questioned if that was the right thing to do. Killing Euzegoar would create a martyr and possibly incite further resistance. Taking him as a hostage would just make him seem even more like a Mazwian, but what about being merciful? He could spare him on the condition that he would order his supporters to lay down their arms, and could further appease him by making him governor of the north. However, Zonni was unsure if he could truly trust Euzegoar. Perhaps it'd be best to simply kill him and be done with it."

The annexation of Macigena had already brought dozens of additional chieftains into the ranks of the nation's aristocracy, and doing the same to the entire north would result in a decentralized administrative nightmare. No, instead, Zonni knew he'd unfortunately have to do what the Mazwians had done and assign a regional governor to manage local administration.\n\nWhile the officials did the necessary paperwork, Zonni had to decide who should receive the title of Zubia-Farma, governor of the north. It should be somezebra he could trust, who wouldn't revolt at the first sign of his weakness, but also a zebra who was competent enough to handle the management of such a large area. This narrowed down the list of potential candidates greatly, as Zonni did not trust many zebras.\n\nIn the end, he seriously considered only two possible candidates: One was Zogon, the drillmaster of the army and a former master of slaves, while the other was Chieftess Amzina, known for making her tribe prosper. Zogon was loyal beyond any doubt, but wasn't as competent of a manager as Amzina would be. Meanwhile Amzina's power and influence was already great, so empowering her even more was potentially a bad idea.\n\nAfter a while, Zonni made the final decision and hoped he would not regret it."

zarhay.17.d:0 "After Zonni's brave warriors had captured the Gelon-Zornu royalty, he had considered to simply take them hostage, as he had no interest in keeping them around as puppets like the Mazwians had. When Mazwi was weak, they had simply seized the opportunity to declare independence, so they clearly could not be trusted. Yet as the word spread, zebras in Zao began to talk how Zonni was now acting like a Mazwian, taking subjugated rulers hostage, drawing comparisons to what had happened to Zar-Hay's royal family. This made Zonni's blood boil as despite refusing to leave the Zefuwa family alone, he was still being compared to the Mazwians. It's like the zebras refused to forget his heritage.\n\nIn a fit of anger, he changed his plans. If he could not keep hostages from the ancient Zefuwa dynasty, he would simply have to extinguish their bloodline to prevent any revolts or conspiracies against him. Yet he felt pity on the former Mai, Gounama, who was a very old zebra. Therefore he decided to leave him alone, and instead get rid of all his possible heirs. The imprisoned zebras were still kept in the city of Zornu, where Zonni soon arrived.\n\nThe members of the Zefuwa family were dragged out of their dungeons in chains and brought to a public square in the center of the city. Zar-Hay soldiers then herded hundreds, or even thousands of local slaves there. When the vast ocean of black-and-white saw their former oppressors in chains, it reacted with a mixture of joy and fury. Zonni spoke to the crowd: "Slaves of Zornu! While I cannot grant you freedom like that harlot of Hayzeb, I present to you a gift. Here is the family that abused you and treated you like cattle, not recognizing your value! Now, I permit you to do whatever you want with them. Nozebra shall be punished!" All of Gounama's sons, daughters, cousins and other close relatives were then thrown into the ferocious crowd of slaves, which proceeded to stomp them to death with their hooves.\n\nIt was said Gounama mourned for seven days before passing away, his heart broken from sorrow."

It was truly outrageous. Zonni immediately began preparations to raze the prosperous cities, but was stopped by his advisors, who suggested he should consider accepting the demands.\n\nChieftess Meynsata said that doing so would appease the city-states and ensure their loyalty, proving to everyone that Zonni had a merciful side as well. She said that while the city-states would be less exploitable due to an autonomous status, less effort would need to be made to quell local resistance.\n\nAs Zonni trusted Meynsata, he seriously considered doing what she asked. But in his heart burned a fire of vengeance, as he felt like he had been insulted. If he would not punish them, wouldn't that just encourage more zebras to insult him? It was a choice between rationality and emotion, and Zonni struggled to decide what to do."

zarhay.19.t:0 "Blessed Of Baru Koda"
zarhay.19.d:0 "With the south, Zonni faced the same problem as with the north: He needed a governor to lead the administration of the region. However, the northern region of Zubia was smaller, had less population and the only notable urban center was Timbucktu. The south was different. It was larger, had much more population, and many prosperous and influential cities. Any governor would have to be not only competent, but loyal, as a rebellious governor could easily use the vast resources of the region to organize a revolt. The south was also blessed by Baru Koda, the Spirit of millet, and thus only a worthy individual could rule the land in Her divine name.\n\nWhile Zonni considered Zogon and Amzina again, as he had before, he also thought of another option. Through his Re'emite contacts, he learned of a royal prince of Ugabi known as Amanyi. He had studied soil chemistry in Re'em for many years and did not care much for being a ruler, lacking any ambition. When Zonni learned of this, he immediately sent his most loyal zebras of the royal retinue to find and retrieve Amanyi, as he felt like he could be the perfect governor.\n\nEventually, the prince was brought before Zonni and made kneel before him.\n"Prince Amanyi, it is good to see you in one piece! I was afraid you'd resist my warriors, but it seems you are willing to comply when necessary."\nAmanyi stood back up, but did not lift his head much and sighed. "Indeed. What do you want from me? Have I committed some crime?"\nZonni laughed. "No, no, you've done nothing wrong! But you can do many things right. You see, I am in need of a capable zebra who can govern your homeland in my stead. And you would fulfill this duty admirably, I believe."\nAmanyi seemed hesitant. "While... I am honoured by this offer, I do not share your belief. I am a student first and foremost. Besides, I would rather live as a free zebra than as a servant to a foreign conqueror."\nZonni's smile vanished. "I see. In that case, I have other options for the position as well. Governors who will make sure Ugabi is drained out of anything valuable."\nAmanyi remained silent. He knew Zonni's ghastly reputation. If he refused the offer, Ugabians would suffer. Would he accept a life of servitude for the sake of his homeland?"

There were few clues about their fate: After the Storm King had sacked Ziani, any captives in the Imperial Palace had broken free. It is known that King Euzegoar of Alwani had escaped this way. However, some of the captives were recaptured and even slain by Mazwian guards. A mass grave of killed prisoners was found, containing only bleached bones and tattered rags, but there was no evidence that any of them had been part of the Zughe dynasty.\n\nThere was no sign of the Royal Signet Ring either. It was a golden heirloom of the Zar-Hay monarchy that functioned both as a seal for the authentification of documents and as a way to identify the monarch. It is possible that the Storm King had taken the treasure, like he had taken so many other valuables, but King Euzegoar still had his crown as he escaped. If the Zughe family had been killed, then it is possible one of the Mazwians had stolen the ring and sold it to someone.\n\nWith a heavy heart, Zonni announced the results of the investigation to his subjects: The Regency would continue indefinitely as none of the members of the Zughe family had been found. Nevertheless, they would not yet abandon hope as no conclusive evidence had proven they were dead either."

Yet in the years since, rebuilding had begun, and already the signs of the previous devastation were few.\n\nMazwians were tenacious like cockroaches.\n\nZonni knew he'd have to do a more thorough job than what the Storm King had done. Only then would the perfidious Mazwians learn their place in the world. His warriors were frustrated by the lack of loot in the city and thus eagerly obeyed his command to set it aflame. Soon enough, ravenous fires spread, and Zonni's soldiers slew anyone who tried to put out the flames. Thousands of zebras fled the city to the countryside, leaving behind the sick and the elderly who were left to perish in the fire. Many others failed to escape in time. The fire spread to the workshops, to the estates of the local aristocracy, to the Imperial Palace. Everything burned with equal intensity. As Zonni gazed upon the flames, he could've sworn he saw Zargitau galloping among them, trampling on burning Mazwians.\n\nIt was a beautiful sight."

Soon enough, Zonni was informed that his soldiers were unearthing and defacing the burial mounds of the Mazwian nobility. Among them was the grave of his mother.\n\nZonni immediately travelled to the scene and saw that it was true. The soldiers were busy at work, digging up graves with their shovels and loading up wooden carts full with burial treasures. It was sacrilegious. Not even the Mazwians had dared to disturb the graves of Zar-Hay chieftains. Yet Zonni did not tell them to stop. Instead, he kept walking, trying to find his mother's grave.\n\nIt was not hard to find. Her burial mound was large because she had once been a high-ranking noble. This also meant that it was among the first ones to be looted, and had already been fully emptied of anything precious. Only his mother's naked bones remained. Even the silk clothes that had covered them were now gone.\n\nZonni stood quietly. While he had little fondness for his mother, deep in his heart, he still felt outraged. He wanted to order his warriors to put back every single item they had taken and restore the burial mound. Yet he hesitated. For years he had tried to convince everyone that his Mazwian heritage did not matter. If he now suddenly displayed affection for his mother, then who would believe his words?\n\nThe wind was blowing loudly. He could hardly hear his own thoughts."

This way his lineage and lack of a claim would be irrelevant. The throne of the Kingdom of Zar-Hay would remain vacant, but that did not matter any longer. The age of Imperial Zar-Hay had begun.\n\nThus a lavish ceremony was prepared in Zao, where Zonni would officially be proclaimed as the Zuwa of Zar-Hay, crowned by the Wind-Singers themselves. A grand parade was held, where the soldiers triumphantly marched through the streets, displaying war trophies, loot and enslaved enemies. Every chief and governor in the new Imperial Realm was invited to the grand capital to attend the ceremonies and to swear fealty to their hegemon by kissing his hooves. While some, like Chief Quaggo, were hesitant, all of them eventually did so. In the end, Zonni was enthroned upon a resplendent golden throne made by the finest goldsmiths in Zao, and a crown made out of purple cloth by the most skilled weavers was placed upon his head.\n\nA gentle breeze outside convinced Zonni that his father was proud.

The perfect candidate was Zogon, of course, the former master of slaves and current drillmaster in the army. He had considered appointing him to govern other regions before, but that had been foolish. The west was the perfect governorship for him. Zogon would whip the Mazwians into shape, make them extract all the wealth from Buckure's mines and demand taxes that were as high as the ones the Zar-Hay had once paid to their Mazwian masters.\n\nPerhaps now the Mazwians would realize how terrible they and their ancestors had been. Only by tasting their own medicine would they learn that actions have consequences, and that retribution is inevitable."
zarhay.26.d_no_zogon:0 "When it came time to appoint a zebra to govern the western lands, Zonni realized his foolishness. Zogon would have been the perfect candidate, yet had already been appointed to govern another region. By now, Zogon had established himself and was doing a fine job as a governor. Changing his governorship would result in disloyalty and disarray. It was a shame, as Zogon was the only zebra cruel enough to rival the former Mazwian governor of Zar-Hay.\n\nInstead, Zonni turned to his loyal second-in-command and advisor, Chieftess Meynsata. In the many battles of the unification wars she had proven her loyalty and capability, and Zonni was convinced he could entrust her with the task of governing. Unfortunately, Meynsata was honourable and would treat the Mazwian subjects much better than Zogon would have. Yet Zonni still hoped her militaristic rule would keep the Mazwians in line."

zarhay.26.b:0 "She will do a fine job."

zarhay.27.t:0 "Rallying Supporters"
zarhay.27.d:0 "After Zonni had said the faithful words, Azkhai had stormed out of the Palace without saying anything in response. Zonni was tempted to tell the guards to arrest him, but knew that would risk a mutiny.\n\nA mutiny soon happened regardless.\n\nThousands of Zonni's soldiers defected to join the King. Even some of the most loyal warriors and officers betrayed him. The Zuwa was shocked, as he had fought alongside them for years, yet now they all flocked to the King whose return they had waited for so long. After the initial shock subsided, Zonni was enraged, yet determined. He would have to teach all these traitors a lesson. Those who remained loyal were his most trusted warriors, and he knew they'd follow him to the gates of Tartarus if need be. All he had to do was rally them to him and encourage them to fight against their former comrades.\n\nZonni gathered his loyal troops at [Root.Capital.GetName], where he would hold a speech for them. Afterwards, they would head straight back to the newly formed frontlines. He climbed atop a pedestal and addressed his soldiers, who were standing in formation in the central market square. For the first time, a microphone and a loudspeaker imported from abroad had been put in place so every zebra could hear his voice.\n"My most trustworthy warriors! All of us hoped for peace, longing to return to our homes and families, but alas that was not to be. Our brothers and sisters have betrayed us, and the absent King proved to be a treacherous snake. Now the Empire we forged together has been sundered!\nBut what was broken can be remade. Hope is not yet lost. All that we must do is put down this rebellion and restore order. Then, we can finally have everlasting peace in the Great Lakes. So I ask you, my warriors, join me one last time to fight the final fateful battle! We will bring justice to the traitors or die trying. With your courage and experience, victory is assured. Zargitau is with us! Let us go forth and gain glorious victory!"\n\nThe cacophonous cheers of the soldiers echoed louder than any sound a loudspeaker could produce. Zonni smiled proudly."
zarhay.27.a:0 "Death to the traitors!"

zarhay.28.t:0 "The Triumphant Zuwa"
zarhay.28.d:0 "After the final capitulations of the False King's loyalists, Zonni was quick to deliver justice upon them. Many lower ranking officers and commoners were simply ordered to be executed, while more high-ranking zebras received individual judgement from Zuwa Zonni himself. Each of them would be ordered to kneel before him and acknowledge him as their rightful sovereign. Refusal would result in a mercifully swift death.\n\nChief Quaggo was among the last ones brought before him. He was quick to defect to the False King's side when he had appeared, and had never been particularly fond of Zonni. The Zuwa felt regret for ever trusting him with anything. As the Chief was thrown down onto the floor in chains, Zonni sneered at him.\n"Your betrayal has finally brought us here, so you can face justice for your actions. Yet I have learned the value of mercy; bend the knee and I shall spare you. But do not expect me to grant you any position of authority in my Imperial Realm."\nQuaggo spat at his hooves. "I would rather die than live under your reign, arch-traitor and tyrant! Since I first saw your half-blooded face, I knew you couldn't be trusted with the position of Regent. Oppression and brutality is part of Mazwian heritage, that much is obvious. You have proven it to be true more than anyone else. Now be quick and end me, so I do not have to suffer from your presence."\nFor a while, Zonni said nothing. Quaggo was defiant until the end, and insulted him in the worst ways possible. The Zuwa was tempted to simply trample him to death with his own hooves. Yet he wondered. How many other prejudiced zebras shared Quaggo's thoughts? He had seen how deeply ingrained tribal divisions were in the Great Lakes. Despite his best attempts to appease his subjects, they would possibly never forget about his heritage. Comprehensive changes were needed to truly unify the many tribes of the region.\nZonni smiled thankfully to Quaggo. "Your words have given me food for thought. I am grateful. So grateful, in fact, that I shall spare you from sharing the grisly fate of your False King. Go, and be free."\nQuaggo stared at him in shock as the guards unshackled him. "No!" he shouted. "I will not live as a subject of a Mazwian ever again!" He galloped to the nearest window and jumped out, leaping to his doom.\nZonni lifted an eyebrow, then shrugged. "Bring the next prisoner.""

zarhay.29.t:0 "Rebellious Slaves"
zarhay.29.d:0 "A caste system had always been in place in the Great Lakes, one that tolerated widespread slavery. It was tradition, and no one dared to question it. But times were changing, and Zonni's enemy, King Azkhai, took advantage of this. He spread emancipatory rhetoric, promising to end slavery in the Great Lakes. He made sure the word spread into lands under Zonni's control, too.\n\nSoon enough, the Zuwa received reports of large-scale slave uprisings in several areas. Somehow, the slaves had gotten weapons and had formed fighting units. Yet for Zonni it was hardly a mystery. Azkhai was endangering the societal order by arming the slaves and inciting them to revolt. He was playing a dangerous game. Did he not realize that if he won the civil war, the slaves would simply turn against him?\n\nZonni was certain the slaves could be crushed easily. But Azkhai had possibly sowed the seeds of rebellion into the hearts of slaves. Seeds that might one day grow into something terrible."
zarhay.29.a:0 "Put them in their place!"

zarhay.30.t:0 "Slanderous Allegations"
zarhay.30.d:0 "When Zonni repressed those he had defeated, he never did so in secret. Yet knowledge of these acts of terror was mostly spread in rumours, which were embellished and twisted into fantastical stories about Zonni being the Scourge of God. Yet not all acts were equally notable and some rumours were entirely fabricated, so it was difficult to tell what Zonni had actually done to his enemies.\n\nThings changed with King Azkhai. Through cooperation with the victims and survivors, he learned the full truth of what Zonni had done, and began spreading the information with the help of griots, who travelled from village to village and recited everything that was known about Zonni's actions. He was exposed as a mass murderer, Kingslayer, tyrant. Evidence was made clear for all to see, leaving no doubt of the truth. Yet at the end of these speeches was a hopeful message that Zonni would face justice for his actions, if not from Azkhai, then from God.\n\nZonni was furious when he heard of this. Once again, truth was used as a weapon against him. Azkhai would pay for this, but in a way, he was thankful. Perhaps Azkhai's supporters would grow fearful of Zonni and surrender, rather than resist and face his wrath. He hoped that would be the case."
zarhay.30.a:0 "Curse him!"

zarhay.31.t:0 "Revisitation"
zarhay.31.d:0 "As soon as he was able, Zonni took a break from fulfilling his duties as Zuwa and returned to the windy fields outside Zao, to the burial mound of his father. He was proudly wearing his full regalia and was even carrying treasures stolen from distant lands. He presented the loot to his father and sat down on the ground, smiling.\n"As I promised, I have returned at long last. Not as a mere warrior-noble or Regent, but as Zuwa, Emperor of the Great Lakes!" he proclaimed.\n\nThe wind was silent.\n\nZonni's grin faltered. "No one dares to mock our family anymore, father. Our enemies faced swift justice. The honour that was lost is now fully restored!"\n\nThe wind was silent.\n\nZonni grew increasingly frustrated. "Why do you say nothing? I have done what few could ever even hope to accomplish! Chronicles now bear the name of our family which was once fading into irrelevance! What more could I possibly do?"\n\nThe wind was silent.\n\nZonni let out a deep sigh. "I understand. Conquering is easy. Ruling is not. I have to avoid sharing the fate of the Storm King. I have to create a lasting legacy for our family. And... I must unite the tribes. Now I realize, father, why you married a Mazwian mare. You did not care for petty tribal divisions. You wished for peace between the tribes, not bloodshed... I have punished the Mazwians for what they did to us, and the debt is repaid. There should no longer be a feud between us. I will make sure of it."\nThe grass around him rustled from a gentle breeze. The mighty Zuwa humbly prostrated himself before the grave."
zarhay.31.a:0 "Zar-Hay or not, it shall not matter."

zarhay.32.t:0 "A Meeting In Re'em"
zarhay.32.d:0 "While Zuwa Zonni had proclaimed himself to be the protector of Re'emites years ago, he had never visited Re'em itself. Until now. A grand procession departed Zao, travelling westwards, and crossed the border into Re'em. The Zuwa was escorted by hundreds of guards and courtiers, as well as many slaves who were carrying valuable gifts for the Re'emites.\n\nWhen the local horses saw this grand caravan, they appeared unenthusiastic. They seemed to be especially bothered by the zebra slaves, who were forced to carry heavy loads on their backs. Zonni saw this, and hoped to appeal to them by freely distributing nuggets of gold from the Buckure mines. When this appeared to have little effect, Zonni muttered a curse and ordered the caravan to continue on its way.\n\n[REE.GetLeader] and his entourage welcomed Zonni to the capital of Re'em. A ceremony was held and the two national leaders exchanged generous gifts with one another. Hospitality was important to Re'emites, so [REE.GetLeader] was more friendly to the visitors than the commoners had been. After a meal with traditional Re'emite cuisine such as wheat bread, figs, pomegranates and plentiful wine, Zonni initiated negotations with the Re'emite leader.\n\nThe Zuwa told him of the devastation caused by the recent wars and the economic underdevelopment of his nation. He was deeply grateful for previous Re'emite aid, but wanted the cooperation to not only continue, but expand. His new Imperial Realm had plenty of wealth to share with foreign friends. [REE.GetLeader] was hesistant however, and asked if Zar-Hay would continue to protect the Re'emites. Zonni assured him that was the case. Then [REE.GetLeader] asked about Zonni's questionable actions, and the continued practice of slavery, and said he wasn't sure if he wanted to help such a ruler. Zonni felt insulted, yet remained calm. He appealed to his emotions, saying how every passing minute a zebra foal died of hunger. [REE.GetLeader] said nothing. Then Zonni became frustrated, and said "Fine! We shall abolish slavery eventually. But only if you promise to aid us!"\n\nThus a deal was signed and the two leaders shook hooves. However, the tensions between the two were clear for all to see."
zarhay.32.a:0 "Together we shall prosper!"

zarhay.33.t:0 "Regarding The "Protector""
zarhay.33.d:0 "After the tense meeting with the Zuwa of Zar-Hay, [ROOT.GetLeader] couldn't help but feel like the relationship between the two nations was unequal. There was even some guilt about helping Zar-Hay in the first place, as it had committed many atrocities and was now dominating the region. Re'em needed protection from Zar-Hay more than anything. If they refused to aid the tyrannical Empire, then they would be swiftly crushed by a furious Zuwa and his mighty army.\n\n[REE.GetLeader] still wanted to help the common populace of Zar-Hay, as they should not suffer for the actions of their monarch. But something had to be done to topple the despotic regime, before Re'em would outlive its usefulness to it.\n\n[REE.GetLeader] ordered his most trusted agents to find some kind of resistance figure who could oppose Zonni's government. Soon enough, they found a Zar-Hay mare called Nyaberi Zargey who was amassing a small but dedicated following. She was a radical and dangerous ideologue, and thus the perfect weapon to use against Zonni Zolon. After she was secretly contacted, she quickly agreed to work together with Re'em to ensure the downfall of the regime. With the newfound support, she would establish a proper political party in her homeland which would strive for the liberation of the populace from tyranny."
zarhay.33.a:0 "Let's hope she doesn't disappoint..."

zarhay.34.t:0 "A Dangerous Demagogue"
zarhay.34.d:0 "The internal security forces of the Imperial Realm recently reported of unusual activity among the lower castes. The labourers and slaves were becoming more organized and started to demand better treatment from their superiors. Some of them were accused of breaking their oaths and arrested, yet this only seemed to cause further unrest.\n\nIt appeared some zebra had been inciting the lower castes with dangerous ideas of social and economic equality. Multiple interrogations revealed the name of "Nyaberi Zargey", yet little else was known about the zebra. A country-wide search for this individual was then initiated. The Zuwa was concerned that if the head of the red snake wasn't cut quickly, it would bite and inject the nation with cursed poison."
zarhay.34.a:0 "Find this zebra at once!"

zarhay.35.t:0 "Promoting The Brave"
zarhay.35.d:0 ""If this is true, then Zanda Dongo is truly an exemplary warrior, displaying all martial virtues of the Zar-Hay," Zonni told Meynsata.\n"I assure you it is true," she said. "He always fought near the frontlines, leading his comrades into bold charges. He also looked for turncloaks in his unit and reported them to his superiors. Zargitau would be proud of him."\n"I will have him promoted at once. Such courageous and loyal zebras deserve to be rewarded."\nMeynsata nodded, satisfied with Zonni's decision. "Thank you. While he has not asked for promotions, I am sure he will rejoice. I shall tell the news to him at once."\n"Wait, Meynsata, before you go," Zonni said just as she was about to leave. "I wished to inquire about something."\n"What is it, my Zuwa?" she asked.\n"When the claimant King revealed himself... did you consider betraying me? I know you do not agree with my harsh actions against my enemies. Maybe you thought he would've been a better ruler than me."\nMeynsata was taken aback, and for a while didn't know what to say. "My Zuwa, I..."\n"You can be honest with me, Meynsata," Zonni said with a rare smile.\n"Well then. Briefly, I did. I remembered your justification, that harsh responses to anything you interpret as a personal attack are a way to guarantee you are not attacked again. The intent is to make yourself feared. But... I think you only make others hate you more."\nNow it was Zonni who was silent for a while. "Then... why did you remain loyal?"\n"Because I know that inside you, there is a stallion devoted to honour and justice. Cruelty of life has twisted him and made him cruel in turn, but he is not beyond redemption. No one is.""
zarhay.35.a:0 "Zonni was speechless."

zarhay.36.t:0 "Increased Internal Migration"
zarhay.36.d:0 "Through various reforms and improved internal security, the Zuwa encouraged migration between different parts of the Empire. Economic disparity motivated many zebras to move from poorer rural areas to richer urban ones, especially as the country continued to slowly modernize. Freedom of movement and safe travel routes further facilitated migration. Migrants from distant provinces were even welcomed in Zao, as hostility towards fellow subjects of the Zuwa had been forbidden by law.\n\nWhile initially, there were tensions between migrants and locals in many areas, many families successfully settled down in unfamiliar societies. Unfortunately, many of these migrant groups formed their own communities and clung to their tribal identities even after migrating. One district in Zao occupied by Mazwian migrants even became known as "Mazwitown". Such ethnic enclaves clash against Zonni's plans of integration, so more work has to be done if the tribes are to be united."
zarhay.36.a:0 "Progress is made, at least."

zarhay.37.t:0 "Increased Tribal Intermarriage"
zarhay.37.d:0 "Ancient taboos on marrying "foreigners" from other tribes were abolished, and thus Wind-Singers and other religious authorities across the nation were allowed to bless marriages between any citizen of Zar-Hay. This quickly lead to a sharp increase in the number of marriages between zebras from different tribes, creating many multi-ethnic mixed families. This was especially common between migrants and locals. The foals of these new couples would be the ones most easy to integrate, so within one generation the nation would already be much more united.\n\nHowever, majority of marriages remained contained within individual ethnic groups, and there was little Zonni could do as he could not force his subjects to marry. While he had the legal power to do almost anything, he knew the folly of forced marriages. Integration had to be voluntary for it to be truly effective. Therefore, further measures to encourage integration needed to be taken."
zarhay.37.a:0 "Not to mention some of the marriages produce no offspring..."

zarhay.38.t:0 "Engineering National Identity"
zarhay.38.d:0 "With increasing state power, came increasing ability of social engineering. For that, however, Zonni had to reluctantly ally with intellectuals from Timbucktu who had pan-Great Lakes ideas of their own. They would be tasked with creating various national symbols for Zar-Hay that would represent the various cultures of the Great Lakes. The purpose was to create a sense of shared identity among the subjects of the Zuwa. These symbols could be anything: Flags, songs, animals, traditions, holidays and so on. As long as they could be used for the purpose of nation-building, it was good enough for Zonni.\n\nSoon enough, the intellectuals had created various proposals. Several flag designs had been made, a traditional song had been adapted into an anthem, a dress used in some isolated rural area was chosen as the national dress, and so on. Zonni picked the ones he thought were suitable and officialized them as national symbols. Finally, these symbols would become known to the population through schools and national festivals. With these shared symbols, a shared identity would be fostered over time. Slowly but surely, the tribes of the Great Lakes were putting their differences aside."
zarhay.38.a:0 "One flag, one nation, one tribe!"

zarhay.39.t:0 "Amalgamation Of A Culture"
zarhay.39.d:0 "While the Zuwa encouraged cultural exchange in general, he decided to make a focused effort to assimilate a single notable culture into the Zar-Hay. There were countless tribes in the Great Lakes, some small and others large, each with their own special traits that had developed over centuries. Zuwa Zonni considered this list to be too vast, and thus narrowed it down to three interesting cultures which could in some way empower the Zar-Hay and the Great Lakes as a whole.\n\nThe first of these was the culture of the savage tribes who lived in the arid fringes of the region. Their population was small, but they were known for their ferocity. They were adopted to the heat of the desert and guarding of the trans-Zebharan trade routes had given them plentiful military experience. Some tribes had already sworn fealty to Zonni, and he respected their abilities greatly. Zar-Hay warriors could learn much from these zebras.\n\nThe second culture of interest was that of Hayzebland. The zebras of Hayzeb had many prospering cities and a vast population. Despite their historical lack of political unity, they were fairly culturally homogenous. Above all, they were industrious and mercantile folk. They were certainly an inspirational model for the Zar-Hay.\n\nThe last culture belonged to the former rivals of Zar-Hay, the Mazwians. Zonni knew it was a controversial option, but he also felt obliged to mend the rift between the tribes of his parents. Perhaps by mixing the two with one another would encourage peace and reconciliation? Nevertheless, Mazwians were capable miners and administrators, being one of the most civilized tribes in the region.\n\nEventually, Zonni finally decided on what culture would form a vital part of the reforged identity of the Zar-Hay."
zarhay.39.a:0 "Our thundering hooves will bring about a sandstorm!"
zarhay.39.b:0 "Zar-Hay should embrace their mercantile heritage."
zarhay.39.c:0 "Two former enemies, united as one!"

zarhay.40.t:0 "Abolitionist Pressure"
zarhay.40.d:0 "For millenia, no zebra had questioned the practice of slavery in the Great Lakes. It was seen as normal and justified for the indebted, the criminals and the prisoners of war to be servile property of their rightful masters. Slaves were the lowest caste, below freezebras and even merchants. Those who were enslaved would doom their offspring to perpetual slavery as well, thus ensuring the caste remained in existence. Slaves usually worked as servants or manual labourers and were owned by either wealthy landowners or the Kingdom. The rest of the Great Lakes had diverse societies, some of which had abolished slavery while others had a system that was almost identical to the one in Zar-Hay. With the unification of the region, the Zar-Hay societal structure was imposed upon the entire region, and thousands of prisoners of war from conquered states were enslaved.\n\nBut there was ever growing pressure to outlaw the practice of slavery, to ban the treatment of individuals as property. The strongest arguments weren't ethical, but economical: As free subjects, former slaves could contribute more to the economy. They could do any jobs they wished, attain education and move to cities. Slaves were dead weight, it was argued. Most importantly though, Zonni had made a promise to Re'emites. In exchange for their aid, he had sworn to eventually abolish slavery. Zonni might've been cruel, but so far he had been a zebra who held true to his word.\n\nThe pressure was becoming overwhelming. Zonni had to decide what to do about slavery. He was the only zebra in the Great Lakes with the power to dismantle it once and for all, if he wanted to."
zarhay.40.a:0 "Slavery is our ancient tradition!"
zarhay.40.b:0 "Slavery will be gradually abolished."
zarhay.40.c:0 "Slavery shall be banned at once!"

zarhay.41.t:0 "Gradual Emancipation"
zarhay.41.d:0 "In fear of angering the slaveowners of his Imperial Realm, Zonni had decided to take a more careful approach to abolishing slavery. First he had instated freedom of the womb, meaning any offspring of slaves would become free zebras at birth. Next he had forbidden the act of enslavement from anyone except state officials, who he never ordered to do so anyways. Then he had emancipated different kinds of slaves one by one, starting with the indebted and ending with the prisoners of war. Finally, before some had even realized, the institution of slavery had been torn down.\n\nHowever, not all former slaves became free. Prisoners of war continued to be subjected to forced labour. Slaves who had been servants continued to serve, earning a meagre wage that was barely enough for sustenance. And lastly, outlawing slavery did not simply erase it, as some continued to keep slaves in secret. State officials often turned a blind eye when they discovered such cases.\n\nZonni had cared little for these issues. What mattered to him was that the abolitionists and the Re'emites had finally gone quiet and left him alone."
zarhay.41.a:0 "Freedom is a rare privilege."

zarhay.42.t:0 "Reunion"
zarhay.42.d:0 "Zonni walked in the windy plains outside of Zao yet again, carrying a bag on his back. But this time he did not come alone. A hundred labourers followed him, bringing shovels and various other tools.\n\nHe stopped at his father's tomb. "Father, I have returned," he said to it. "I have done as I promised. The rifts between the Zar-Hay and the Mazwians are slowly but surely being healed. The two tribes shall be united, like you and mother were." Near him, the workers began their work and dug into the father's mound with their shovels. Zonni grabbed the bag from his back. "And now, you two shall be united once more." He opened the bag, and revealed that it was full of bleached bones. "You should've always been buried together. This shall be an everlasting symbol of the union of the tribes."\n\nAfter several hours, the work was complete. The mound had been re-opened, the bones of Zonni's mother had been placed next to the bones of his father, and the mound was closed again. As the workers began to depart, headed back to their homes, Zonni looked at the mound wistfully and sighed. He could feel the wind blowing on his cheeks, as if it was kissing him gratefully."
zarhay.42.a:0 "Rest in peace now."

zarhay.43.t:0 "Zar-Hay's Ultimatum"
zarhay.43.d:0 "An emissary sent by the Zuwa of Zar-Hay, Zonni Zolon, arrived in [Root.Capital.GetName], accompanied by hardened zebra warriors. She requested an audience with [Root.GetLeader] to discuss an important and urgent matter. Her wish was granted, and soon the two met in private.\n\nThe emissary relayed the message of her master, which was revealed to be an ultimatum. Zuwa Zonni was demanding that [Root.GetName] recognize his supreme authority and submit themselves under his personal protection. He would entrust them with the duty of guarding his Imperial Realm's eastern border from outside threats. If this ultimatum was not accepted, then the dervishes could not be trusted and would have to be... "subjugated by force".\n\nThe ultimatum received a cold reception. They weren't being given much choice: Submit or die. Yet the dervishes did not fear death, and possibly valued their hard-earned freedom even more. [Root.GetLeader] had to quickly decide how to respond to the threat. Would they accept a life of servitude, or die as free hyenas?"

Unfortunately, they did not realize how merciful and generous his offer had been. Their refusal to recognize Zonni's authority made them an enemy of the Imperial Realm, and he would not tolerate an enemy on his border.

In return for guarding the eastern border of the realm, they will fully maintain their internal autonomy. Zonni was pleased with this news, as he had fully expected the dervishes to refuse. The Imperial Army was thus demobilized and ordered to stand down -- for now, at least."
zarhay.45.a:0 "They shall serve him faithfully."

zarhay.46.t:0 "Zwahile-Farma"
zarhay.46.d:0 "The newly integrated southern region of Zwahile is distant from the capital, and covers a large geographical area. Therefore a new governorate needs to be established to administer local affairs. [Root.GetLeader] does not have many options, as most of the good governor candidates have already been assigned other regions to govern. The nature of the south as a more of a frontier region however did present the possibility of assigning a zebra with a military background. For this purpose, [Root.GetLeader] considered appointing Fari Ndebi, a faithful officer who had served the Kingdom for many years. He, if anyone, would be able to ensure that the locals remain loyal to Zar-Hay and that defences will be ready against any threats from the west or east. However, as he is so militarily minded he is not perhaps the best possible option for the position of governor, as he would likely neglect civilian matters."

If this ultimatum was not accepted, then he would seek "alternate methods" of taking control of the region.\n\nThe ultimatum received a cold reception.

zarhay.58.d:0 "There were hundreds of burial mounds in the grassy fields near Zao, belonging to myriad families of noble descent. Out of all of them, the one belonging to Zonni's father was likely the smallest. It had always been humiliating for Zonni, and something other aristocrats had mocket him for, but that would now change. Soon, he'd be the one having the last laugh.\n\nThousands of workers arrived in the fields, carrying with them tools and construction materials. They would begin work on creating the grandest burial mound Zar-Hay - and all of the Great Lakes - had ever seen. Stone foundations were set for numerous large rooms which would be filled to the brim with burial goods, most of which was loot from Zonni's conquests: Mazwian gold, Aorandan grain, bronze jewelry from Hayzebland and intricate pottery from Timbucktu. In the passages that connected them, artificial rivers of liquid mercury would flow, representing Zonni's love for rivers. In the entrance, a grand army of clay zebras would guard the mound from grave robbers. Countless workers perished during the construction in accidents, especially during the final phase when the tomb complex was buried with earth. Some of the workers had also tried stealing burial goods, so Zonni ordered them to be buried alive.\n\nWhen construction was finally completed and the bones of his family moved inside the new underground mausoleum, Zonni inspected the finished work and was pleased. Never again would anyone mock him or his family - not that they dared to do so anyways, knowing retribution would be swift."

It does not matter if the ultimatum is accepted or refused, the end result is likely the same. But refusal would at least be an act of defiance, and a slim opportunity to retain freedom by fighting back against tyranny.\n\nHow shall we respond?"

In fact, with this act they have proven themselves to be enemies. Zuwa Zonni has officially stated that the Re'emite citizens are eager to join Zar-Hay, yet their treacherous leaders planned to stab their zebra allies in the back.

zarhay.62.t:0 "A Remnant Of The Past"
zarhay.62.d:0 "With mass education, economic development and meritocracy in the army, more and more subjects of the Zuwa began to question the necessity of having a caste system. In multiple governorates, and even in Zar-Hay proper, zebras were protesting for the abolishment on restrictions of marriage between castes, and for repealing any laws which limited social mobility. In practice, the caste system had already ceased to exist in the largest cities, where market forces pulled individuals from one occupation to another. Before, the son of a potter was destined to be a potter, but in many places, that was no longer the case.\n\nZonni himself had disdained the existence of a martial warrior caste, even though he had been a member of it. He was an ardent advocate of meritocracy, promoting officers based on skill and not heritage. In the Imperial Army, soldiers came from all kinds of castes. Yet such meritocracy had not extended beyond the military. His advisors reasoned that taking action to repeal the caste system would strengthen the economy as zebras could seek any occupation they wanted. Some, however, warned that forcefully doing such a fundamental societal transformation would be difficult, requiring considerable effort. Especially the upper castes, the aristocrats, would do anything they could to oppose any change to the societal hierarchy.\n\nZonni had the final word, as always. All he had to do was to decide if change was necessary, or if things were fine as they were."
zarhay.62.a:0 "The caste system is a sign of backwardness!"
zarhay.62.b:0 "If it isn't broken, don't fix it."

zarhay.63.t:0 "Secrets Of Life And Death"
zarhay.63.d:0 "Zuwa Zonni arrived in Zarabara with his escort of servants and guards, and saw that the town had changed much over time. The Chief's hut had been replaced with a large modern laboratory, where hundreds of underpaid workers laboured day and night to mass produce magical potions. They were for the most part sold to the Imperial Army, and profits from the sales made the town thrive. It had wide paved streets, tall houses and even a sewage system.\n\nZonni entered the laboratory, having already informed the Chief of his arrival beforehoof. Yet he did not come to meet him, and his servant simply requested him to come to the meeting room. While Zonni was insulted by this, he knew it was unwise to anger the sorcerer. He left his escort behind and entered the room where Chief Faran was waiting. Zonni sat down opposite him and accepted an offer of kola nuts as a gift. "You must know why I have come here, so let us get straight to the point," Zonni said.\n"I know. But I cannot give you what you want."\nZonni frowned. "Excuse me? Surely, the greatest potion brewer in the Great Lakes knows the recipe of a potion that can prolong one's life?"\n"It would be useless. You are not far from death."\nZonni's frown deepened, twisted by anger. "What? Are you threatening me?"\nFaran shook his head and pointed at a small lump in Zonni's neck. "You have a tumour right here. If it's malignant, you won't last much longer."\nZonni blinked in shock and touched the round outgrowth. He hadn't paid much attention to it, but he felt like it had gotten larger over time. "W-what? Is there no cure for this?"\n"For cancer? No, and I doubt there ever will be. Maybe in a century or so."\nShock was swiftly replaced by anger. "Surely you can some up with some way to keep me alive! Or are you a mere fraud, instead of a true sorcerer?"\n"The only creatures immune to cancer are alicorns and dragons. You appear to be neither, so you are doomed."\nZonni clenched his teeth. "Is there anything I can do, then?"\nFaran nodded slowly. "Write a testament. Inform the heir. Make sure the Great Lakes does not fall into anarchy again when you die."\n"But I have no heirs! No close relatives, nothing!"\n"Then appoint one. You have absolute power, do you not?"\nZonni let out a deep sigh, deeper than the abyss of Tartarus."
zarhay.63.a:0 "Who will inherit his legacy?"

zarhay.64.t:0 "Appointing An Heir"
zarhay.64.d:0 "Zonni Zolon was still relatively young, and few cared that he had no official heir yet, except for some of his advisors. But if the sorcerer was right, he had to appoint one as soon as possible, to avoid a disastrous succession crisis from tearing his Imperial Realm apart. He would not allow his family's legacy to be erased by selfish fools. Yet no one was informed that he would die soon. No one except for one zebra, the only one Zonni trusted.\n\nChieftess Meynsata was requested to meet with the Zuwa, and she arrived as quickly as she could. She was never late for anything. When she entered Zonni's throne room, he barked at his servants to leave them alone. Once the room emptied, he sighed deeply. "Meynsata, there is something I must tell you."\n"What is it, my Zuwa?"\n"I am a doomed stallion. Chief Faran said I have cancer, and I have no reason to doubt his words."\nMeynsata's eyes widened in shock. "W-why are you telling me this? Shouldn't you tell everyzebra?"\n"No! They will become like vultures, circling around my dying body. No, it must remain secret. I told you because I want you to inherit the Realm."\nSomehow, Meynsata's eyes widened even more. "Me? Do you really trust me that much?"\n"Yes. Meynsata, I... if things had gone differently, I would've liked for you to be my spouse. You are a mare of valour and honour. I was never... brave enough to tell you that. But it doesn't matter now. I am certain you will do a fine job as the ruler. You will be far more just than I ever was."\nMeynsata stared at him for a while, processing everything he had just said. She then closed her eyes and sighed deeply. "I understand you, Zonni. I also wish things could've gone differently. But life is rarely predictable." Her eyes opened and she put her hoof on his. "I swear, when the time comes, I will not disappoint you."\nA bittersweet smile formed on Zonni's lips. "I know. You never have.""
zarhay.64.a:0 "The Imperial Realm shall prevail."

zarhay.65.t:0 "Ozymanedias"
zarhay.65.d:0 "Zonni's condition worsened rapidly. Mere days ago, he was a strong stallion, lean and muscular, full of ferocious energy. Now, he was a rapidly decaying wreck, suffering from constant pain that was ever worsening. The lump on his throat was now accompanied by other lumps elsewhere in his body. He was bedridden, and it became clear to every zebra in his court that his death was near. Like he had predicted, the vultures began to circle around him, only to be disappointed to learn that he had appointed Meynsata as his heir.\n\nIn his final moments of clarity and consciousness, he told he wished to be buried next to his parents and said he wanted a grand stone epitaph to be erected in the center of Zao. It would read:\n\n"You wail about the loss of life, yet you have lived your lives in safety due to my labours.\nYou speak of tyranny, yet you have been spared the lash of hunger, the dagger of disease, the sword of fire, thanks to my stability.\nYou claim to live in fear, yet can you not wander the streets and the roads, safe from brigands and bandits thanks to my armies?\nYou bleat about lack of trust, yet I have forged unity and made a thousand bickering tribes into one people.\nYou whine about what was taken from you, yet you are wealthier than you or your ancestors ever were!\nYou cry and moan, saying I'm a monster, yet that very same monster guards your doors from all that which would hurt you!\nYou rave about what was lost, when I gave you everything!"\n\nHe fell into a coma on the following day and despite the best efforts of the doctors, passed away within a week. Meynsata was by his side the entire time."
zarhay.65.a:0 "Nothing beside remains."

zarhay.66.t:0 "Uprising In Macigena!"
zarhay.66.d:0 "For a while, Zonni's passing was kept secret from the wider populace in fear of a revolt. Zonni's body was not yet buried and was kept in the palace, and his servants acted like he was still alive. In the meantime Meynsata ensured the Imperial Army was ready for any potential internal unrest. Finally, one week after his death, the truth was revealed to the public.\n\nThe news spread like wildfire across the Imperial Realm. In Zar-Hay, zebras were overtaken by shock and grief, and countless thousands flocked to attend his grand funeral where he was entombed within the burial mound he had constructed. Elsewhere in the Imperial Realm, the mood was more mixed. While many zebras had grown to respect Zonni and accept his rule, they did not necessarily want to remain as subjects of the Imperial Realm. Loyalty was shaky especially among the local sycophantic aristocrats which Zonni had never deposed or weakened. Yet despite these tensions, nothing happened and the country remained calm.\n\nThen a spark lit a bushfire in Macigena.\n\nBaga-Tarkhan of Macigena, Monzon, showed his gratitude to Zonni by launching a well-organized uprising soon after he heard the news of his death. It quickly became clear he had been preparing for it, and a scandal erupted among the Eyes of the Zuwa for failing to prevent the rebellion. He had raised a small army seemingly out of nowhere and expelled any administrators and soldiers loyal to the Imperial Realm of Zar-Hay. His goal was apparently to restore Macigena's independence.\n\nUltimately, his action seemed suicidal. Even with his small personal rebel host, he stood no chance against the might of the Imperial Army, despite his skills in guerilla warfare. Clearly, his only hope was to inspire other uprisings elsewhere. The fate of the Imperial Realm hung in the balance."
zarhay.66.a:0 "Any rebellions will be swiftly taken care of."

zarhay.67.t:0 "Uprising In Zubia!"
zarhay.67.d:0 "Even before Macigena's rebellion, the Eyes of the Zuwa had reported of suspicious activity in the north. Convoys of supplies were moved to strategically vital locations and there was tension in the air. When news of what had happened in Macigena arrived, all Tartarus broke loose.\n\nZubia-Farma Euzegoar seized control of the local garrison with the aid of his own loyalists, and arrested those who did not join his side. Then, he proclaimed that he, as the King of Alwani, was no longer a servant of Zar-Hay. Soon thousands of zebras joined his revolt. Timbucktu, which had previously defied him, now accepted him as their rightful ruler and pledged allegiance to him.\n\nWhen Meynsata heard of this, she remembered how Zonni had spared Euzegoar's life in exchange for his loyalty. Now that he was dead, there was no reason for Euzegoar to continue to serve Zar-Hay. She realized that if Zonni had been true to his nature, instead of being honourable like her, this could've been avoided.\n\nPerhaps Zonni had been right. Being just and merciful wasn't always the right thing to do. Meynsata would remember this when she'd next time meet with Euzegoar, the traitor king."
zarhay.67.a:0 "Death to the traitors!"

zarhay.68.t:0 "Uprising In Ugabi!"
zarhay.68.d:0 "There had always been uneasiness between the Lake-Farma, Amanyi, and the central government. He did not always fully comply with orders and insisted on being able to garrison his own governorate with his own troops. Some concessions were made, but generally Zonni had kept him in a tight leash, threatening to punish him for disobedience.\n\nWhen Zonni died, it was therefore not surprising that Amanyi was much more actively working against Zar-Hay. The Eyes of the Zuwa reported of weapons being smuggled and former UCTA soldiers defecting from the Imperial Army. An arrest warrant was finally issued on Amanyi, but it was too late. With his military force, Amanyi seized personal control of his governorship and declared independence from the Imperial Realm. He urged locals to join his rebellion against a "tyrannical monarchy". With the great prosperity and size of his new breakaway realm, he was able to muster a strong army to secure its independence.\n\nMeynsata couldn't help but feel sorry for Amanyi. Zonni had coerced him to become a governor against his will. A revolt was therefore only a matter of time. It was unfortunate she was the one who was now burdened with the responsibility of dealing with it."
zarhay.68.a:0 "He will be dealt with eventually."

zarhay.69.t:0 "Uprising In Mazwi!"
zarhay.69.d:0 "Under Zogon's governorship, Mazwi had suffered terribly. Harsh taxes were imposed on the local populace, crimes were punished most severely and thousands were arrested, suspected of treason. Despite being half-Mazwian, Zonni had done little to improve the situation. So when he died, it was unsurprising that they would depose Zogon.\n\nThe zebras rallied behind a figure who called himself Manza Maghad, the rightful successor of the late Manza Mahud. He waged a campaign of insurgency, driving out the Zar-Hay garrison with terrible efficiency. Soon, he had gathered a proper army under his banner of liberation. However, he also made promises to restore the Imperial reign of Mazwi over the Great Lakes.\n\nMeynsata found irony in the situation. Maghad reminded her of Zonni back in the day, when he had led a rebellion against Mazwian oppression. Now the tables had turned and it was the Mazwians' turn to do the same. Yet it did not amuse her in the slightest. This appeared like an unending cycle of violence. She would have to stop it, permanently."
zarhay.69.a:0 "Zar-Hay's revolt succeeded, but theirs will fail."

zarhay.70.t:0 "The Imperial Army Swears Loyalty"
zarhay.70.d:0 "After the initial shock of the uprising in Macigena and its ripple effects elsewhere in the Imperial Realm, the commanding officers of the Imperial Army reassured their loyalty to the new Zuwa. The soldiers of the army had fought alongside Meynsata for many years and thus knew she would be a capable ruler of Zar-Hay. They went to action to suppress unrest, especially in areas of direct military control such as protectorates. Afterwards the Imperial Army prepared to crush the rebels who had broken free of Zar-Hay dominion.\n\nMeynsata's determination grew, though she still felt like she could never surpass Zonni's prowess as a military leader. But surely she was more than capable enough of dealing with an army of traitors?"
zarhay.70.a:0 "March to victory!"

zarhay.71.t:0 "The [GetMonth] Revolution"
zarhay.71.d:0 "There comes a point where popular unrest reaches a critical threshold. Once it is reached, the only way to restore order is through violence.\n\nAs the central government of Zar-Hay was unable to calm the rebellious commoners and soldiers who sympathised with them, the situation quickly went out of hoof. Soon, armed militants were roaming the streets of major cities and government buildings were seized one by one. The situation had deteriorated so completely that there was no choice but to mobilize the army. A civil war was inevitable.\n\nMeanwhile, Nyaberi Zargey lit a cigar from Puerto Caballo as she waited for the news. So far, everything had gone according to plan, but plans had an unfortunate tendency to backfire. She lifted her gaze as a zebra entered her makeshift office. "So, how did it go, General Zaberi?" she asked from him.\nThe zebra saluted her. "We have successfully secured control of the capital. However, we were unable to capture the leader."\nNyaberi let out an exasperated sigh. "Of course. Oh well, could've gone worse. I guess we've still got work to do then, eh?"\n"Yes, comrade."\n"What are you waiting for, then? There's reactionaries to shoot. Go!"\nThe general nodded and left. Nyaberi relaxed on her uncomfortable seat. Soon enough, she'd be sitting in a proper modern office with a leather chair."
zarhay.71.a:0 "Death to the old order!"
zarhay.71.b:0 "Death to the rebel scum!"

zarhay.72.t:0 "The New Oaths"
zarhay.72.d:0 "The original oaths had been dictated by Zonni himself. As he had been illiterate, a scribe had accurately written down his words. Yet Zonni was a warrior who demanded military discipline from all of his subjects. While Meynsata was a warrior as well, she knew that she could not treat soldiers and commoners alike. Therefore she entrusted a court official to rewrite the oaths to be less strict. The revised four oaths were:\n\nWith God as my witness, I solemnly swear to dedicate a part of my life to diligent, productive labour to further the prosperity of my household. I shall obediently give a small portion of my wealth to the Zuwa, so she may use it wisely for the common good of the nation.\n\nWith God as my witness, I solemnly swear to dedicate a part of my life to community service. I shall not conspire against the rightful government, for the sake of peace and order in the realm. I shall obey the commands of my superiors and only question them if they are unreasonable.\n\nWith God as my witness, I solemnly swear to dedicate a part of my life to public security. I shall not aid any potential spies or criminals, instead reporting them to my superiors so they may be dealt with.\n\nWith God as my witness, I solemnly swear to dedicate a part of my life to defending the nation against any foreign incursions. I shall answer the call when I am needed on the front. In battle, I shall only retreat or surrender when the sole other alternative is death."
zarhay.72.a:0 "The Zuwa is fair and just."

zarhay.73.t:0 "On The Matter Of Trade"
zarhay.73.d:0 "Meynsata was not particularly fond of policymaking, but it was a necessary evil for a ruler like her. She had inherited this burden from a stallion whom she had respected, perhaps even admired. She wanted to make Zonni's spirit proud while it still roamed the land. But she couldn't help but admit that she'd rather fight with her spear than with a pencil.\n\nShe summoned two trustworthy advisors: Chieftess Amzina and Yaniv Litzhol. Both knew much more about economic matters than she did, and she asked them to explain what trade policy would be best for the Imperial Realm. Amzina spoke first, and was quick to explain how a liberal, open economy was the best for both the common folk and the government. If goods were allowed to flow freely, the economy would grow faster, ultimately resulting in more taxes and increased prosperity. The Re'emite horse had a completely different opinion, however. He reasoned that Zar-Hay was such a large nation that they were largely self-sufficient in many resources. If they allowed unlimited exports, not only would they lose all the potential tariffs, but raw resources would flow out of the country. It would be better to keep them within the national market, so they could be refined locally, thus driving economic development and lowering prices of refined goods.\n\nMeynsata did not really understand anything what was said, but had to decide which advisor was the more reasonable one."
zarhay.73.a:0 "Yaniv is right."
zarhay.73.b:0 "Amzina is right."

zarhay.74.t:0 "Everywhere At The End Of Time"
zarhay.74.d:0 "Not long had passed since Zonni's unexpected death, but the memory of him was already fading, shifting and warping. Some zebras remembered him as a merciless tyrant who ruled with force, while others admired him as the greatest hero of Zar-Hay since Zargitau. Thousands blamed him for the deaths of their loved ones, and thousands celebrated him as the Uniter of the Great Lakes. It soon became clear that these two contrasting interpretations of the past could not co-exist. One would have to dominate the other, and ultimately it was the duty of the state-sponsored chroniclers and griots to choose what narrative would prevail.\n\nMeynsata invited a certain famous griot to a personal meeting at a rather unusual location: Near the tomb of the deceased Zuwa. She accepted the invitation after initial hesitation. Once she arrived, Meynsata was already waiting there, alone.\n"Fassa Balleke, I presume?" the Zuwa asked.\nThe griot nodded and bowed. "Yes. It is an honour to speak with your majesty."\n"Spare me the formalities. I wished to speak to you about an important matter."\n"What is it?" She looked at the grass-covered burial mound. "Does it have something to do with my former employer?"\n"Yes. I have a simple question: How do you think he should be remembered?"\nFassa frowned and pondered. "Well, he was a... complicated stallion, to say the least. He was generous to his allies and ruthless to his enemies. I became rich thanks to him, but I know fellow griots who lost their heads for making fun of him."\n"Answer the question, please."\nFassa sighed. "We griots sing what others want us to sing, I am afraid. We do not choose our narratives ourselves, for it is a breach of our duty. We merely record oral tradition."\n"Allow me to rephrase my question, then. How would you tell Zonni's story?"\nShe took a deep breath. "I think I would say that...""
zarhay.74.a:0 ""...Zonni was a national hero who restored the glory of Zar-Hay.""

zarhay.75.t: "Out With The Old"
zarhay.75.d: "Nyaberi Zargey walked across the central market square of Zao, escorted by loyal armed soldiers who mere months ago had been farmers and crafters. Usually, this was the busiest hour at the market, but now it was near empty, except for a group of prisoners and their guards. It was deadly silent.\n\nNyaberi stopped in front of the prisoners and took out a cigar from the pocket of her suit, put it in her mouth, took out a shining modern steel lighter, flicked it with her hoof and ignited the cigar. All this time, the prisoners stared at her in horror and confusion.\n"Right, there we go. Now what do we have here?" she said and examined each prisoner. "A bunch of high and mighty zebras. Lovers of monarchy! Hierarchy! Tradition! Lovers of oppression and enemies of modernity and civilization." She motioned at the buildings around the square. "Look at this place. Everything is built out of wood and mud. 'Traditional architecture' or some nonsense. Disgusting. You fillies and gentlecolts ever seen Manehattan? Skyfall? Places with actual civilization? They don't even have 'markets', they have shopping malls. Towers made of glass and steel! People wearing fine suits, not some ancient rags. That's what one day Zao will look like." She saw how displeased the prisoners were with this, and grinned. "And this is why I need you out of the picture. To stop you from dragging every zebra downwards just so you can be on top, to stop you from judging others based on who their parents were. I hereby sentence you all to die, and quickly too. Guards, kill them all."\n\nShe deeply inhaled the smoke of her cigar and smiled as the prisoners wailed and begged for mercy, before they were all silenced by bullets to the skull.\n\nIt was a beautiful sight."

zarhay.76.t:0 "Traitors Among Us!"
zarhay.76.d:0 "Despite swearing oaths of eternal loyalty to [Root.GetLeader], many suspicious soldiers were ultimately ready to betray them and switch sides. These soldiers were unhappy for various reasons: cruel officers, low pay, neglect from the government. But the revolutionaries promised them many great things, and some foolishly believed them to be honest. They genuinely thought that joining the enemy was reasonable, but justified, that they would fight for a greater cause and bring about a new golden age to the Great Lakes.\n\nIt is unfortunate some soldiers are this delusional, but thankfully their number is relatively small. Nevertheless, this will weaken the [Root.GetAdjective] military and prolong the bloody civil war."

zarhay.77.d:0 "It soon became apparent to every zebra that the old order had lost. More and more cities and villages were occupied each day and morale was low, with loyalist soldiers surrendering in droves. Soon enough, the "legitimate" government had no way to enforce its rule anywhere, and was forced to go into exile.\n\nThose who had surrendered were officers and soldiers, but the former could not expect any mercy. Nyaberi Zargey despised the leaders of the army, many of whom came from aristocratic families. She saw them as loyal hounds of narrowminded oppressors and abusers of their own soldiers. So when she was asked what should be done with them, she gave a simple response.\n\n"Shoot them all. If you don't have enough bullets, then stab them all."\n\nThe soldiers of the revolution did not like them much more than she did. Across the Great Lakes, they could be seen executing their former superiors, with only a few doing so hesitantly. Of course, this meant that the army now had a severe lack of experienced officers, but Nyaberi cared little. What mattered was that the opposition was crushed, and she could now fulfill her vision freely."

Workshops have been burned down, bridges blown up and trains derailed. The fact that this happened simultaneously in so many places at once makes it clear that rebel sympathisers were behind this senseless campaign of destruction. Repairing the damage will take a considerable amount of effort, and in the meantime it will hamper the effort to crush the rebellion."

zarhay.79.d:0 ""They are coming," Chieftess Aminata muttered to her family and loaded her rifle. "Quick, run away while I distract them!"\nHer daughter didn't seem happy with this order. "Mum, just come with us!"\n"No! They will chase us down otherwise. I will give you time. Now go! Once you reach the forest, you'll be safe!"\nThe daughter nodded, tears in her eyes, and left. Her brothers soon followed, leaving Aminata alone.\n\nShe looked out of the window again as the gang of armed peasants approached the house. Some of them carried torches even as the sun shone brightly above, making it clear what their intent was. One of the peasants knocked on the door roughly with his hoof. "Open up, Chieftess! We know you're in there!"\n\nRather than reply, she pointed her rifle out of the window and shot the zebra. He fell down on the spot. His comrades scattered in surprise and fear, diving for cover and dropping their torches. Aminata reloaded and shot again, but missed. By now, the peasants were returning fire, and a battle had begun.\n\nIt lasted for several minutes, with dozens of gunshots echoing in the spacious courtyard of Aminata's adobe home. While she was reloading, one of the peasants grabbed a torch and threw it at the window. It landed inside, and she cursed loudly as it set the floor on fire. She retreated, and when the peasants realized this, they rushed to break down the door.\n\nAminata was running low on bullets and figured she had given enough of a delay to her family. She went down the stairs and decided to go after her foals while the peasants were busy getting inside. But when she came out of the backdoor, she stopped in shock and almost dropped her rifle.\n\nGeneral Zaberi Ganji of the revolutionary army was standing before her, with all her foals being held hostage by armed peasants. Zaberi grinned. "Thought you could trick us so easily, huh? I had your home surrounded from all directions. And this is what my brave soldiers caught."\n"Let them go!" Aminata screamed and pointed her rifle at the general.\nZaberi was unfazed and shrugged. "Sure, if you drop your weapon."\nSeeing her crying foals, Aminata gritted her teeth and obeyed.\n"Good! See, even a Chieftess can learn to take orders from a former slave!" Zaberi said, laughed, and shot Aminata in the head with her pistol."

zarhay.80.d:0 "The wandering warrior and mercenary, Ture Sylla, has proven to be skillful and capable. Not only that, but the soldiers he leads have nothing but good things to say about him. He is a wise and just leader, punishing those who misbehave and rewarding those who not only fulfill his orders, but innovate and outsmart the enemy. It appears he has extensively studied military strategy and tactics, forming elaborate plans that impress even Zonni.\n\nEven the chiefs who distrusted foreigners began to like him. Some even claimed he was an honorary Zar-Hay and thus deserved their respect. Zonni was pleased with this news and felt proud of his general. He even considered giving a rare gift of kola nuts. After all, while he was ruthless to his enemies, he was generous to his allies. However, he was displeased to hear that the general actively discouraged his soldiers from being harsh on the enemy populace, sometimes even disobeying Zonni's explicit orders. Nonetheless Ture was too good of a general to lose, so Zonni tolerated this behaviour. At least for now, while he needed him."

All of them wore fine clothes, even if they were traditional ones.\nNyaberi saw their nervousness and chuckled. "What's wrong? To celebrate my return home, I offer you drinks, free of charge! Do you reject my gifts?"\n"N-no no," one of the zebras replied. "We just... haven't drank this before. Can't we have palm wine? Or... millet beer?"\nNyaberi shook her head and took another sip. "Come on, nobody drinks those outside of the Great Lakes. You call yourselves merchants! Shouldn't you all try to be more cosmopolitan? Abyssinian coffee is popular around the world."\nA few of the zebras hesistantly tasted the coffee. It looked like they didn't like it much.\nNyaberi frowned and put down her cup. "Alright alright, let's cut to the chase. I know you all have heard of revolutions abroad. Ones where they take all the rich folk and hang them. Or cut off their heads. Or just shoot them."\nThey stared at her.\n"But I haven't forgotten my kin. My fellow merchants, outcasts of society. How could I forget? You raised me as a merchant, taught me how to trade and barter, sent me out into the world. How could I not be forever grateful?" She smiled subtly.\n"So... we're safe?"\n"Of course." She paused and her smile faded. "But I'm afraid I have one condition. You'll need to contribute a substantial portion of your wealth to the revolutionary movement."\nHer family broke the silence and protested and argued.\nNyaberi sighed and finished drinking her coffee.

"The gates are wide open for you, and I have prepared a grand celebration."\nSeventeen of them approached, greeting him and expressing their gratitude, escorted by numerous servants and bodyguards. But three other relatives stood out from the rest, as they merely nodded to Azkhai when they passed him. They were Muza, his young son who looked at his regalia with greedy eyes, Zin, his sister who struggled to hide her jealousy, and Bene, his cousin (the less said about him, the better).\n\nAzkhai's smile faded as he turned to follow his family to the royal palace. Those three concerned him, as they were all claimants and potential successors, and he doubted if they were content to simply wait for him to die so they could take the throne for themselves. Somehow, he'd have to appease them, or he'd go into a burial mound earlier than he had hoped."

The King took a deep breath before knocking on the door with his hoof. He didn't even remember when he had last spoken with his cousin. Each year, Bene became worse and worse, so he feared what he was like now.\n\nThe door was opened by a chubby middle-aged zebra with a messy mane and wide open eyes. He glared at Azkhai for a moment, as if examining him. Then he barked: "And what brings you here, cousin?"\n"I... I merely wished to ask you something. Nothing more, nothing less."\nBene narrowed his eyes. "Of course. Nozebra would want to spend time with me or anything. What do you want me to say?"\n"What would... make you more content with life? Or happier, even."\nIn response, Bene raised an eyebrow. "Nozebra has... ever asked that before." He pondered for a while, leaving Azkhai to stand in awkward silence. "I know what you could do! Bring me into your court. Make me... a royal advisor. Yes, that would please me."\nAzkhai suddenly felt like all of this was a bad idea. "Erm... I will seriously consider it."\nBene grinned. "I'll help the Kingdom prepare for the dimensional merge. The day is coming, you know. And with me, a literal God, by your side, you will be safe, and our enemies will be destroyed."\nAzkhai had an urge to quickly leave. "Yes, that sounds... wonderful. But now I must go attend urgent royal duties. Until we meet again, Bene."\n"My name is Beghe, now. I merged my first and last names.

zarhay.87.d:0 "While Muza rarely spent his wealth as he preferred to amass it, sometimes he was willing to do so. Especially if expending gold could result in earning more gold. In his mind, hiring expensive mercenaries and bribing soldiers to aid with a coup was worth it as he could gain practically endless wealth through taxation as the King of Zar-Hay.\n\nThe palace was a place of security and peace for Azkhai. Here, he could relax, knowing that he'd be safe in the trusted hooves of his retinue and court. Unfortunately, his trust proved to be misplaced as some members of the Royal Retinue barged into his bedroom in the middle of the night, put a gag in his mouth and carried him away. The gag was only removed when he was dropped in front of his son, who stood on the shore of the Lake Zao near the palace. Moonlight glittered on his shining jewelry as he looked down at his father with a strange smile.\n"M-Muza?" Azkhai muttered in shock. "What is the meaning of this?"\n"You are old, father. Is it not time for you to retire, and let someone more youthful take charge of the country? You can live in security and peace far from any danger."\nAzkhai's face contorted as it tried to display too many emotions at once. "How could you do this! I raised you! You are my son, not some traitor! What would your mother say if she was still alive?!"\n"You raised me to be your heir. I thought you'd be happy to let go of your power and finally let me take the reins."\n"I know the truth! I know you better than anyzebra else. You've let your lust for gold consume you. All you want is taxes in your own coffers!"\nMuza rolled his eyes. "I am an adult now, father. No need to yell at me like at some dumb foal. You must realize this change is for your own good."\nAzkhai tried to contain his fury and sighed as he realized it was all in vain. "Fine. If I cannot convince you to stop this madness, then allow me to say this: Put your subjects ahead of yourself and your greed. Take good care of them."\n"I will, father. Do not worry," Muza said, still smiling as if nothing bad had happened.\nAzkhai tried to smile back, but couldn't.\n\nThe Royal Retinue put him on a canoe and set off to an island in the lake, infested with mosquitoes and toads, where a small cottage had been prepared for him.

Here, he could relax, knowing that he'd be safe in the trusted hooves of his retinue and court. Unfortunately, his trust proved to be misplaced as much of the court unexpectedly marched into the throne room, led by Zin herself. Even the Royal Retinue did not intervene in this dramatic entrance.\n"Zin," Azkhai muttered and narrowed his eyes. "What are you up to now, sister?"\nZin narrowed her eyes as well, starting a staring contest between the two. "You know well what is happening. I have decided that it's my turn to be on the throne." She presented a scroll to him that had the royal seal on it, but had not yet been signed. "This document will validate your abdication. All you need to do is press your signet ring on this seal, and this is over. You can go retire to a safe island in Lake Zao and live there in peace."\nAzkhai stood up. "And why would I sign it?"\nZin shrugged. "Well, then you'll have a revolt in your hooves. All these chieftains with me have vowed to support me."\n"They also vowed to be loyal to me."\n"Well, actions speak louder than words, do they not, brother?" she said and smiled.\nAzkhai tried to contain his fury and sighed as he realized it was all in vain. "Fine. If I cannot convince you to stop this madness, then allow me to say this: Put your subjects ahead of yourself and your jealousy. Take good care of them."\nZin chuckled. "Sure, I don't really care as long as I win and finally get to be Queen." Zin's smile widened into a triumphant and smug grin.\nAzkhai blinked, and lost the staring contest. Their sibling rivalry was over.\n\nHe signed the scroll with his ring and gave it to his sister.

Here, he could relax, knowing that he'd be safe in the trusted hooves of his retinue and court. Unfortunately, when he heard of what was happening at the entrance his illusions were shattered. He rushed outside and saw a huge crowd of religious fanatics in the courtyard led by none other than Bene. The Royal Retinue had been unable to stop them from entering due to their numbers and lack of willingness to shoot at unarmed zebras.\n"By God, what are you doing, Bene?!" Azkhai exclaimed.\nBene raised his head proudly and walked up the steps towards him. "I am going to take my place at the head of my people. The dimensional merge is coming. There is no time to waste."\n"What on earth are you talking about?"\n"Step aside, cousin!" Bene barked. "Or the crowd will tear you apart, limb from limb. I'm done listening to your empty platitudes and pleasantries. You don't actually like me at all, I know that. You've always just tried to appease me so I wouldn't try to... do this."\n"Bene, no, I... you're my cousin. We're family. And I strive to treat all my relatives well."\n"You never did. You never truly cared about me as I was the 'black sheep of the family' and all that. You saw what the Mazwians did to me and you did nothing. And now you lie and think I'll believe you? I might be naïve, but I am also God. And I can read your thoughts."\n"No, Bene, this is lunacy! You are just a zebra like everyone else!"\nHe appeared offended. "I've never been like everyone else. That was always the problem. But I don't care. I've turned it to my strength. Now give up your Royal Signet Ring, or I'll pry it from your cold dead hooves!"\nAzkhai tried to contain his fury and sighed as he realized it was all in vain. "Fine. If I cannot convince you to stop this madness, then allow me to say this: Put your subjects ahead of yourself and your ego."\nBene snorted angrily and said nothing as he forcefully pulled the ring from Azkhai's leg.

When Azkhai opened it and saw it, he asked "Did you really deliver this down the hallway? His room isn't that far away from mine."\nThe courier nodded, saluted him and went away.\nAzkhai sighed, put on his reading glasses and read the scroll. It said:\n\nDear Father,\n\nI am humbly requesting you to grant me the position of royal treasurer. The zebra who currently holds the position once served under the dreaded despoiler Zonni Zolon. I do not believe he can be trusted, and instead, you should entrust the duty to me. I have recently read several tomes about economics and managing funds, so I am well prepared for this task.

It was not easy to detect, but somewhere along the way from the taxpayer to the coffers, a lot of wealth has inexplicably gone missing. The King swiftly ordered a thorough investigation to root out suspected corruption. Unfortunately, the trail ultimately led to none other than the royal treasurer himself: Muza Zughe, the King's son.\n\nIt seems Muza can no longer be trusted to handle large quantities of gold and other treasure as he seemingly claims it for himself and hides it away. Having royal blood, he is unlikely to receive a harsh punishment, but he should at the very least lose his position. However, if that is done he will likely be very upset and claim to be innocent, even if there is concrete evidence of his misdeeds. Does the King really want to anger his beloved son?"

She's already made Chieftess Amzina into a close ally and was lately seen talking to Chief Quaggo as well, who's one of the King's most loyal subjects. While on the surface all this seems innocuous, Azkhai is well aware of the purpose. Zin is building up her support base to rival his own, and might one day use it to overthrow him. After all, she has a strong claim on the throne thanks to being his little sister.\n\nOf course, Zin has done nothing against the law, so there is little that can be done about this. One option is to leverage the king's political influence to sway his subjects and ensure their loyalty. This would require a considerable amount of time and effort. It might be fine to simply ignore Zin's actions for now and wait until she crosses some red line that can be used as an excuse to contain her ambitions."

So after he arrived in Zao, he started going out to the city and interacting with the inhabitants. At first, he was seen as a strange person, and was soon publicly mocked and shunned. But something strange happened: Bene began angrily rambling on the city square about how he was God and warned everyone about the upcoming "dimensional merge", whatever that meant. And some zebras listened to him and were fascinated by what he said.\n\nSoon his audience grew. Some zebras were there because they found him amusing, but a worrying number of zebras especially from the lower castes took his words seriously and saw his erratic behaviour as a sign of a divine blessing. A genuine religious cult was forming around him, who saw Bene as some kind of prophet. He was more than happy about this as he thought his beliefs were validated and his inflated ego was soothed.\n\nWhen Azkhai heard of this, he was very concerned. He thought these "Devotees of Beghe" were little more than enablers and soothsayers who are reinforcing Bene's delusions and worsening his mental illness. He felt like he had to intervene in some way and encourage zebras to stop supporting Bene. However, he was also well aware that this would anger his cousin and deteriorate their relationship. Perhaps what mattered most was the fact that Bene seemed to be much happier now."

It was a bold and unexpected move, wiping away centuries old traditions within a moment. While abolitionists and former slaves celebrated and the zebras of Ugabi, Macigena, Hayzebland and Timbucktu were happy with the news, many others had the opposite reaction.\n\nThose zebras who participated in slave trade or employed large numbers of slaves in their mines and farms were dismayed by the change. They were now forced to stop buying or selling slaves and had to start paying salaries to their former slaves. This instantly drove thousands of zebras into sudden poverty and bankruptcy. In addition, many slaves lost their jobs upon emancipation and were now unemployed, no longer even receiving free housing and food like they previously had.\n\nWhile it was clear that slavery would not be reinstated, a few zebras still decided to agitate for it, or at least protest that the abolition had been done too fast. There were even rumours of a group of radical reactionaries who would use violence and coercion to maintain slavery even if it was illegal. The fallout from the abolition concerned Azkhai, and he pondered if he had to do something to alleviate its effects, even if it meant helping former slave owners."

Spoke sweet things and promised the world if I abandoned you, my King, and supported her claim to the throne. I pretended that I was interested, but you know well that I would never betray you!"\nAzkhai nodded. "I know all this.

Do you mean... take care of them as in murder them?"\nAzkhai's face contorted in both shock and anger. "What?! No, never! I would never mean it that way."\nQuaggo tilted his head. "Why not? Just hire a competent assassin and secure your rule. You have better relatives further down the line of succession, like your daughter. She's a real sweetheart."\n"No, Quaggo, no. They're all my family, and I love them despite their flaws. I would rather strike myself down than hurt them in any way."\n"I... see. Well, it's painful to admit, but I worry you may be too soft in this regard. Sentimentality might lead you to lose your throne."\n"So be it.

However, as much as he wished to personally revisit Re'em, he was afraid to leave the country as then one of his relatives could overthrow him while he was away. Instead, he sent a group of envoys and aristocrats, who arrived with an entire caravan full of gifts.\n\nThe horses and zebras of Re'em received them with great jubilation, especially as they freely distributed nuggets of gold from the Buckure mines. Relations had warmed up after slavery had been swiftly abolished by King Azkhai and the Re'emites viewed his representatives positively. [REE.GetLeader] held a ceremony and the two sides exchanged gifts. As a sign of hospitality, the Zar-Hay zebras were invited to enjoy a traditional meal consisting of wheat bread, figs, pomegranates and plentiful wine.\n\nAfter the formalities, negotiations were held and many hooves were shaken. Multiple treaties were signed, and Re'em agreed to not only continue economic assistance but to expand it. They even agreed to a treaty where both nations guaranteed each other's independence, without formally allying militarily. The diplomacy was productive, and as a result Re'em and Zar-Hay were closer to each other than ever before."

His health had rapidly deteriorated in the recent weeks, but he refused to leave his soldiers and died on his bed in a barracks building. He left behind no living relatives. A medical inspection was made on his body by Re'emite doctors and they determined that the cause of his death was cancer. They found a large malignant tumour in his neck that had ultimately killed him.\n\nBecause he had no family, there was no one to claim his remains. Due to his importance as a person, [Root.GetLeader] ultimately claimed the body so they could decide what to do with it. Chieftess Meynsata, who had fought alongside him previously, asked for him to be buried next to his father's burial mound outside Zao. However, Chief Quaggo protested and said it would create a pilgrimage site for his more radical supporters who had approved of his violent methods. Rather, Zonni's body should simply be cremated and the ashes scattered into the sacred wind, and any mentions of him erased from historical records. It is known he had held personal disdain towards Zonni, so his suggestion was biased. Nonetheless, it's true many of Zonni's followers were ruthless zebras who had executed his orders without question.\n\n[Root.GetLeader] held mixed feelings about him. While it is true he had been a cruel half-blood despot, ultimately he had stepped down from his throne and allowed [Root.GetLeader] to claim what was rightfully theirs. Clearly, Zonni had had some sense of honour. Perhaps he deserved a proper burial? Or maybe he just deserved to be forgotten."

Not only that, but it is widely seen as a bad omen, doubly so if a King is in question.\n\nSo far Azkhai had been able to keep his secret rather well, but unfortunately he stumbled on some stairs in the Palace right in front of his court. Not only that, but some servant had leaked the fact that he uses reading glasses whenever he has to read documents. It did not take long for rumours to spread like wildfire and many soon believed the King was becoming blind.\n\nWhen Azkhai's relatives heard of this, they realized the King's legitimacy was now quickly eroding. They used this to their advantage, gathering their supporters and asserting their claims to the throne. After all, if the King was becoming blind, he'd have to abdicate, and that meant he urgently needed an heir."

zarhay.99.t:0 "A New Ideology"
zarhay.99.d:0 "With the new import of industrial machines came a need for workers to operate them. Many zebras (especially former slaves, who now had the freedom to move wherever they wished) began migrating from impoverished countryside villages into cities that offered many new jobs. Unfortunately, the managers of the industrial machinery thought they could increase profits by offering low salaries for their workers. The work was hard and dangerous, but the compensation was minimal, and as a result some workers were upset.\n\nOne zebra saw this unhappiness and sought to exploit it. She was a proponent of a dangerous ideology that was clearly inspired by foreign ideas of revolution and communalization of property. Travelling from one city to another and holding rousing speeches in each, she quickly built up her own organization which was called the Revolutionary Liberation Front. Some of her speeches openly opposed the monarchic rule of Azkhai, yet he did not persecute her, thinking it would do little to help. Clearly something would have to be done about the unrest among the workers, but it would take a while. In the meantime, the revolutionary movement would continue to grow."

The King wisely appointed all of them, picking trusted zebras who he knew were competent. One of them was his oldest daughter, Harakoy Zughe, who was appointed as Timbucktu-Farma, the governor of the newly created Timbucktu province. It was a coveted position as the city was prosperous and famous, even if governors themselves only had limited powers. Nevertheless, the ability to tax the local trade routes was a lucrative prospect. But it also invited corruption, so Azkhai had chosen his beloved daughter who could be trusted.\n\nUnfortunately, Harakoy's older brother and the primary heir to the throne, Muza Zughe, was upset with this. He claimed that the governorship belonged to him, and that Azkhai was foolish not to give his oldest offspring any governorates to rule over. He claimed that it would allow him to hone his skills as a ruler, which would be important for the future. Yet Azkhai sensed his true motivation: Gold. If he would swap Harakoy with Muza, it was likely that some tariffs would go missing on their way to Zao and the royal treasury. Muza was still right about needing experience in rulership, so it was a hard decision to make. Could he really trust Muza with such an important position?"

He has secured control of much of his former governorate, which happens to include all the lands which once belonged to Alwani. He seems to have little interest in diplomacy and has refused any requests to negotiate. King Azkhai even offered his position as governor back, but it was too little, too late.\n\nIt appears violence is the only solution to regain control of the vital northern regions of the Kingdom.

The King turned to look at him with a puzzled look. "What brings you here, Muza? Allow me to guess: Something to do with all this?" he asked and motioned towards the servants.\nMuza nodded. "Yes, father. You are very generous to the lower castes and their miserable zebras. But do not forget your kin. Is family not important to you? I think we deserve some of your wealth too."\nAzkhai sighed. At least his son was honest this time. "I... understand, but you live lives of luxury, do you not? I don't think you need anything as much as my more unfortunate subjects do."\n"Wouldn't it be more fair to give every zebra their fair share, father? Perhaps we can receive less than the needy ones, but still, everyone has their needs, rich or not. The poor have need for food and clothing and so do the rich. It's just different types of food and clothing, is it not?"\nAzkhai rolled his eyes and wished he wasn't such a kind-hearted person. Then he could smack Muza on the face with his hoof."

They had escaped captivity and sought refuge in Re'em, which was granted to them. The eldest member of the family and the legitimate successor to the Zar-Hay throne, Azkhai Zughe, soon left Re'em, leaving his family behind. He promised that he'd reclaim his throne when the time was right.\n\nThis promise was finally fulfilled and Azkhai is now the King of Zar-Hay. He sent a letter to Re'em, asking his family to come to Zao now that it is safe. They heeded this request, gathered their belongings and prepared to leave.

While their privileges remained, now it was possible for any zebra to become a bureaucrat or a chieftain as long as they were qualified for it. Not only that, but lower castes or even zebras formerly outside the caste system could now more easily gain societal status. Merchants were the most prominent example, as they were wealthy but had been seen as outcasts due to not belong to any caste. Now they threatened to become the new dominant political class in Zar-Hay.\n\nZin Zughe, the King's sister, saw this paranoia and dissatisfaction and sought to take advantage of it. She contacted many members of the upper caste and with their cooperation wrote a formal demand for Azkhai. A courier presented it to the King, and it read:\n\nYour Majesty,\n\nThe recent abolishment of the caste system threatens the very foundations of Zar-Hay society. The traditional hierarchy ensured order and that every zebra knew their place. Now, due to your changes, the merchants see themselves as the new masters of the nation, despite lacking any pure and sacred blood of the upper castes. This threatens societal balance and might cause new conflicts and rivalries to erupt. As your sister, my King, I beseech you to reconsider your actions. If you do not wish to reinstate the caste system, then at least decree that the former lower castes should still respect their superiors.

Now, he felt more ready than ever to face the inevitable dimensional merge."

Then soldiers began deserting from the ranks of the Royal Army, disappearing in a similar fashion. Rumours spread like wildfire and a certain restlessness defined the common mood of the Kingdom. [Root.GetLeader] ordered an investigation to find out what was happening, but it was already too late.\n\nViolence broke out in the west, and loyalists were either convinced to pledge allegiance to Muza or were simply killed. Soon enough, most of the western Kingdom was out of control of the government in Zao. Now it was sky-clear what was happening. Muza was planning to take the throne by force, and was influential enough to rally a large number of supporters behind him."

Unfortunately, many chieftains in the Kingdom appeared to agree with her and declared their support for her claim to the throne. Tensions were rising rapidly and provincial governors soon had to declare their allegiance either to the King or to the claimant. Many of them did not remain loyal. Then came the army, as aristocratic officers also rallied behind Zin, taking their soldiers with them. Finally, Zin presented an ultimatum to [Root.GetLeader]: Surrender or die."

Even during the coronation ceremony, they had protested outside the palace, chanting "Justice for Bene!" and "The dimensional merge is coming!". The royal retinue had quickly dispersed the protesters, but this served only to further radicalize Bene's supporters. They preached to the populace, appealed to governors and soldiers, and generally rallied support for Bene. Apparently, Bene himself was not involved in any of this. But he had enough fanatic supporters for a grassroots movement to spread and sow the seeds of civil war. After initial hesitation, Bene declared that he was the rightful God-King of the World and that all should kneel before him. This signalled the beginning of a brutal uprising that had to be subdued by force."

zarhay.123.t:0 "A Scandal"
zarhay.123.d:0 "Word has spread recently about scandalous deeds done by Bene Zughe, the King's infamous cousin. Several mares have accused him of harassing them and generally acting improperly. When Azkhai heard of this, he was not surprised as he was already aware of his cousin's ill-fated quest to find a wife. His unusual mannerisms and inability to handle social situations with any kind of grace meant he usually alienated every zebra around himself, including potential partners.\n\nChief Quaggo however had an interesting proposition. This scandal could be used to weaken Bene's support base. If his followers heard of this, they would become disillusioned with him and stop supporting him. Of course, Bene would not be happy with this and his mental health might worsen, but it would be a cunning way to secure the throne."

zarhay.124.t:0 "A Couple Of Deaths"
zarhay.124.d_muza:0 "Muza was not a person who socialized much, preferring to spend time with his books and treasures. He therefore had no special attachment to most of his relatives - least of all Zin and Bene, who saw themselves as the rightful heirs of Azkhai. That was nonsense, of course: Muza was Azkhai's oldest offspring and therefore the primary heir. The claims of his aunt and cousin once removed were spurious at best. Nevertheless, he knew they'd continue to cause trouble in his Kingdom if he did not do something about them before it was too late.\n\nFirst he decided to take care of Zin, as he saw her as the bigger threat. She had formed many ties with the leading figures of Zar-Hay society and could leverage this to her advantage, but Muza had something even more powerful than relationships: Money. He secretly sent funds to many of Zin's primary allies, accompanied by a note that the King would be very happy to see her dead. So happy, that he might share some of his immense wealth. This worked, and within a week Zin had died after drinking a poisoned cup of palm wine.\n\nNext came Bene, the buffoon. He thought gold would not sway him at first, but later realized that it of course could. He sent him a substantial gift and a message that said he should use the wealth to convince some mare to marry him. He even recommended Chieftess Amzina. Then, he contacted Amzina and bribed her to arrange an assassination of Bene when he would inevitably come and visit her. This worked; Bene travelled to Anzongo to meet her, displaying his newfound wealth as much as possible and asked her to go out on a date. Then he had an "accident" as a nearby tree conveniently fell on top of him. Muza rewarded Amzina with additional funding so she could invest it in developing Anzongo."
zarhay.124.d_zin:0 "Zin always tried to socialize with all her relatives at least once, just to see if useful relationships could be formed. Two of her relatives, however, had proven to be utterly unapproachable. Muza, her nephew, was a withdrawn greedy hermit who clearly had no interest in even talking to her, while Bene was a degenerate lunatic who was not above flirting with his cousin. She could therefore not employ her charisma to convince the claimants to drop their claims to the throne. She'd have to find another way to solve this problem of meddlesome family members.\n\nFirst she decided to take care of Muza, as she saw him as the bigger threat. He was fond of accumulating wealth, which could be used to bribe any zebra in the Kingdom. But greed could also prove to be his downfall. Zin contacted some wealthy merchants she knew personally, like those of the Zargey family. They owed her a favour for her recent lobbying, and now she would ask for something in return. The merchants would send Muza a gift of golden treasures, claiming to support his cause. The treasure would, of course, be laced with ouabain poison. Muza fell for the trap and was soon found dead in his room in the palace.\n\nNow came Bene's turn. Zin knew he was strongly disliked by the Wind-Singers due to his unorthodox quasi-religious ramblings. So she contacted the ones she knew personally and arranged for Bene to be condemned as a witch. While Bene's followers protested, most zebras now hated him. Inevitably, a group of religious peasants ambushed him and burned him alive."
zarhay.124.d_bene:0 "Bene could still hardly believe he was King, but at the same time, it appeared natural and unsurprising. This was clearly his destiny, and to fulfill it, he'd just have to deal with some final obstacles in his way. These were Muza, who in some ways was similar to him but cared only about wealth, and Zin, a crone who liked to pretend to be his friend but had rejected all of his advances, showing her true face as a heartless monster. These two wanted to seize his throne away from him and denied his right to Godhood. They were enemies, and he would destroy them.\n\nFirst came a series of public threats against the two. Bene proclaimed that he would "personally deliver them to Tartarus" using his godly powers. He then ordered two dolls to be made depicting Muza and Zin. After they were finished, he pierced them with needles, stomped on them and tore them to shreds with his teeth. Unfortunately, this did not have any effect of them, much to Bene's surprise. He then drew a series of crude drawings of them dying extremely brutal and violent deaths and put them on public display. This didn't work either. He refused to doubt his divine abilities and figured they had made pacts with demons to protect themselves from his powers. This was enough of an excuse for him to order them to be arrested and executed by drowning in Lake Zao. Despite Muza's attempts at bribery and Zin's attempts at persuasion, this order was carried out by the Royal Retinue. Bene was proud that he had outsmarted the demons by using his temporal powers and relaxed, content in his glorious victory."

Soon, he was excited as well.\n"My King, I am happy to tell you that the prospectors have been successful in their search for valuable minerals!"\n"Oooh? Really? Tell me, how big are the veins of gold? How many tonnes can we expect to mine?"\nThe mare's excited expression was replaced with a frown. "Gold? Oh, no, we did not find any economically exploitable traces of gold. No, what we found was tungsten! Huge, easily mineable deposits of it! Not just in Buckure, but in Zairbanda too!"\nMuza visibly deflated. "Oh. Well, um, good, I guess? Are you sure you did not find any precious metals? Even silver would be nice."\n"No, your majesty. Just a huge amount of tungsten, that's all."\n"I... see. Thank you for this, information. You are dismissed."\nThe mare nodded, then slowly turned to leave.

The Kingdom of Zar-Hay was now firmly in their hooves, and nozebra could take it away.\n\nWhile preparing to issue a royal proclamation, a sudden invitation arrived at the palace. Chief Quaggo, one of the prominent chieftains of Zar-Hay's central heartland, wished to speak with [Root.GetLeader] in private, at their personal residence in Zairbanda. Apparently, it was urgent and required utmost secrecy. It was possible Quaggo had discovered some insidious plot to overthrow the ruling monarch. Concerned with this possibility, [Root.GetLeader] assembled the most loyal members of the Royal Retinue to escort them to Zairbanda.\n\n[Root.GetLeader] arrived at Chief Quaggo's manor, rushing inside to learn more about the mysterious threat. Inside they saw Chief Quaggo, who was waiting for them, but he was not alone. Beside him stood Harakoy Zughe, one of Azkhai's daughters.\n"What is she doing here?"

"Don't worry, I both paid and persuaded them enough to ensure they are on my side."\n"You?!" the monarch shouted at their relative. "You planned this! This is a coup!"\n"You could call it that.

At the center of it all sat Queen Zin, sitting patiently as an artist sketched an image depicting her.\n\nA member of the royal retinue approached her, whispering into her ear. Zin groaned, apologized to the artist and followed the zebra to the gates of the palace. There, a group of commoners had gathered. Zin did not recognize a single moon-lit face, so none of them were important figures.\n"Why have you gathered here?" she asked them.\n"Your majesty, we unfortunately have struggled to sleep due to all the noise coming from your magnificent palace. Could you ask your court to be more quiet, oh magnanimous Queen?"\nThe Queen frowned. "And this is why you saw fit to bother me? I was busy, you know."\nThe commoner appeared mortified. "Your m-majesty, forgive me, we did not mean to-"\n"If you have trouble sleeping, just cover your ears with something!

"May I enter?" asked a gentle, young and feminine voice.\n"Of course," Azkhai replied, and the zebra pulled back the curtain. It was Harakoy, his daughter, with a stack of papers in her hooves.\n"Here's the financial report you asked for, I compiled it as quick as I could," she said and placed the stack on the floor, where Azkhai was sitting on a cushion and working.\nAzkhai smiled warmly. "Ah, thank you. You always do your best to make me proud," he said, chuckled, but then frowned and remained still.\nHarakoy noticed this and tilted her head.

zarhay.129.d:0 "The queen's boat landed on the marshy shore of a small islet on lake Zao. It was covered in thick vegetation and had a single building on it, a small wooden cottage. Azkhai had lived here ever since he had abdicated, in a state of quasi-exile.\n\nAfter Queen Harakoy disembarked, she walked to the cottage, but found it to be empty. She could see that it was well-maintained and even had a little garden at the front. Thankfully the island's size meant that it was easy to find Azkhai. He was standing in the water amongst reeds, apparently picking up lake weeds from underwater so he could prepare a meal out of them. Harakoy's arrival seemed to go unnoticed for him. "Father!" she called out, and Azkhai swiftly turned to look at her in surprise. His eye pupils were pale grey, and it appeared that he could hardly see her. However, he clearly recognized her voice.\n"H-harakoy? What are you doing here?"\nShe ran into the water, not caring that her regal clothes got wet, and embraced her father. He dropped the weeds in his hooves and hugged her back.\n"What happened?" Azkhai asked in a concerned, frail voice. He appeared far too old to be doing any physical work.\n"I deposed your relative and claimed the throne for myself! You can go home now!"\nAzkhai blinked, then stared blankly. "Home... yes, I think I remember that. It was called Saao, yes?"\nHarakoy's smile faded slightly. "Zao. It's called Zao."\n"Oh, right, yes. Hold on, let me... finish gathering weeds..."\n"Don't be foolish! We have plenty of food at the Royal Palace!"\n"Oh, we do? That's good.

She tried talking to Azkhai many times, but he hardly spoke back, only mumbling incoherent words.

The queen was quickly summoned to meet him.\n"F-father? You're standing on all fours!"\nAzkhai cackled. "Felt like taking a stroll one last time!"\nHarakoy's eyes teared up and she galloped up to him so she could embrace him.\nAzkhai was taken aback by this, but nevertheless hugged her back. "I assume you've been taking good care of our kingdom?"\nShe nodded, sobbing into his robes.\n"Good, good. You make your ancestors proud. And more importantly, you make me proud. A stallion can pass away in peace, knowing his lineage and his life's work are secure." He chuckled. "Now, Harakoy, I'm sure you have a lot of work to do.

"Do you think Zar-Hay was a capitalist society before our revolution? No, it was so backwards that it was still mired in feudalism, so the bourge-whatever weren't the main enemy that needed to be eliminated. This is a dual revolution, a working-class revolution against capitalism and a capitalist revolution against feudalism. And no, I do not particularly want to shoot my family. Not psychopathic enough for that just yet." She let out a dry chuckle.\n"At least you know some of Marks' theory," Zaberi mumbled.\n"Yeah, I can read. Anyways, let's get to work!"

You know, how about we just talk things out and resolve our differences?"\nZaberi narrowed his eyes. "Go on."\n"Like, lemme just meet all the orthodox marksists, I'm sure we can come to some sort of agreement. And in case you fear it's some kind of trap, don't worry! You'll be allowed to bring guns.

I would rather die than bring shame upon myself by disobeying the King's order."\nThe messenger sighed and nodded.

Thankfully I came prepared."\nEveryone else's eyes widened as they suddenly realized they were feeling faint. Within moments, some of them fell unconscious. Zaberi realized what was happening. "This is a trap! I knew it! You're a traitor to the revolution!" he shouted and pulled out his weapon.\n"Oh, oh, what took you so long, idiot?" Nyaberi replied. There was a sudden bang as her concealed miniature pistol unloaded lead into Zaberi's body.\n\nWithin five minutes everyone in the room was dead, except for Nyaberi.

There's a coup going on!"\nNyaberi leaped out of bed, pushed her out of the way and rushed outside, wearing nothing but a sleeping gown.

Guess I'm under arrest or something. Now, why did you do this?"\n"You know well why I did this. It's not like I didn't warn you. I am doing what I must to save the revolution, before you ruin it completely with your unorthodoxy."\nNyaberi rolled her eyes. "I'm sure Marks would've been very proud of you if she was still alive."\n"Indeed." Zaberi turned to his soldiers. "Put hoofcuffs on her and take her away.

There, she saw the zebras were already hard at work preparing the smelters and heating them up to the right temperature for melting gold. She also saw the materials needed to make ingots of gold and other valuable metals, which would then be used to import vital industrial machinery from abroad. Most notably, there were the Royal Signet Ring of King Azkhai, the royal regalia of Queen Bamina, Mai Gounama and the Manza of Mazwi, as well as the crown of King Euzegoar and the jewelry of the Nnabakyala of Ugabi. In addition there was an innumerable amount of baubles from various chieftains and such. All the gems encrusted in them had already been removed, of course.\n\nShe was glad to see it all put to better use. All these trinkets were symbols of senseless waste and vanity. She thought about how many tonnes of rock underpaid miners had to excavate, how much raw ore had to be processed by underpaid metallurgists, how much underpaid craftszebras had worked to craft the items themselves. All this time and effort spent just so these zebras could look special, even though the only special thing about them was their royal or aristocratic heritage.\n\nAfter the crowns and such were placed in the roaring furnace, they began to melt rapidly.

"What the hay- you can't just barge into my office like that! Why didn't you contact my secretary and arrange a meeting?"\nZaberi seemed to ignore her and sat down in front of her desk. "Nyaberi, we need to talk. And as your second-hoof zebra, I feel like we can talk at any time."\n"I'm a busy zebra, you know!" She let out an exasperated sigh, then took out a cigar and a lighter. "Okay fine whatever, tell me what's bothering you."\n"One of the first goals of any communist revolution should be socialization of the economy and imposition of rational management upon it. Yet despite establishing companies owned by the proletarian state, the economy remains unregulated and unplanned."\nNyaberi chuckled. "Oh I get it. You want to eliminate the spectre of capitalism and market forces. News flash: commodity trading remains common as commercialization barely has a hoofhold here."\n"I don't see that as an obstacle to implementing rational planning of use-values-"\n"You quoting Marks? Sure sounds like it. Look, I get it, you're a real idealist, with this image in your head of a happy utopia of every creature holding appendages together and dancing in a circle. But I am a realist, and the reality is that we need to build a modern economy from scratch. Got it?"\nZaberi seemed somewhat offended by this, but nodded slightly. "Fine. I suppose you're right. As long as your goal remains achieving true communism." He stood up. "Deviate from the path to communism too much, however, and you'll hear from me again."\n\nWith that, he left the office.

On the streets, zebras appeared to have followed the new mandatory clothing decree which had banned traditional clothes. She was pleased to see the locally mass-produced standardized dresses and suits being used. The motorcade passed by the former sanctuary of the Wind-Singers which now served as a public park.\n\nThey finally arrived at their destination: a new public library whose opening ceremony was about to begin. As Nyaberi got out of the car, she thought the library looked like something right out of Manehattan, which was of course exactly what she had wanted. However, she hadn't wanted to see Zaberi Ganji among the crowd. He spotted her and quickly approached, so Nyaberi groaned. "I'm gonna need another cigar..."\n\n"I was waiting for you," he said. "I need to ask you to reconsider your ban on domestic literature."\n"Really? Right now? I gotta hold a speech you know, and cut the ribbon."\n"Now would be the perfect opportunity to announce the reversal of the ban."\n"Why do you care about those dusty old books, full of reactionary ideas?"\n"There were many important cultural works in that list of banned books.

Now that we are no longer barbarian savages, we can fully embrace modernity. And what does that mean? Well, as far as I am concerned modernity is what was built in Equestria, what I saw back in Manehattan. A society that has embraced progress, that has realized that competition drives innovation, where the economy is largely run by entrepreneurs and businessponies. There are some who reject this vision of modernity, but they are fools. The truth is, modernity IS capitalism. Socialism was just a transition phase.

"You have not only brought prosperity to the Zargey family, but to all merchants."\n"Yeah, she has made us proud!" another, younger zebra said.\n"I propose a toast to Nyaberi!" a third even younger zebra said, raising her cup. "And a toast to tomorrow!"\nThe entire family cheered in response and raised their cups. Nyaberi appeared flustered. "Aww, you guys are making me blush." Finally, she stood up and raised her own cup as well. "A toast to tomorrow!""

zarhay.163.d:0 "After the state had been dismantled and the formerly state-owned companies had formally taken over the role of governance, some had expected a massive revolt to break out. However, rebelling against corporate rule would've meant losing any chance of employment in the future, and very few wanted to take the risk. Besides, in practice nothing had changed anyways. Companies had already dominated life before the dissolution of the state, and the economy largely relied on market transactions. They had simply stopped pretending to care about building a communist utopia, and the only other ones who cared were fervent ideologues who were very few in number, especially after the mysterious disappearance of Zaberi Ganji and other Marksist leaders. Almost everyone in the Great Lakes simply shrugged and moved on with their mundane lives.\n\nBut not Ezhe Babangida.\n\nThe abolition of the state had been a wake up call. He was sick of his life, and he wanted change. Not revolutionary change, as the revolution had clearly failed. But he knew he could make things better, not just for himself, but for everyone else, so he sought out like-minded folks who were displeased with the situation. One of them proposed that they should found trade unions and recruit members, so eventually they could reduce the twelve-hour workday to ten or even eight hours, while increasing their salaries. It was ambitious, but great things started from small acts.\n\nTherefore, during a short break, he approached one of his co-workers. "Hello there," he said with a friendly smile. "Would you like to join a union?""
zarhay.163.a:0 "For the union makes us strong..."

zarhay.164.t:0 "Bitter Memories"
zarhay.164.d:0 "With the end of the persecution of intellectuals came a tidal wave of new publications, many of which had been forbidden from being published before due to their controversial contents. While some sought to contribute to science, others were little more than emotionally charged polemics. It seemed like the educated zebras of the realm had waited for a long time to finally vent out all their frustrations.\n\nOne notable example was a chronicle written by a Timbucktuan scholar, who recorded the life and deeds of Zonni Zolon. His text was far from being unbiased and it was clear the scholar wanted to make sure history would remember every terrible deed ever done by Zonni. When Meynsata heard of this, she was tempted to ban the text, but knew doing so would cause an uproar, so she left it alone.\n\nIn the introduction of the chronicle, Zonni is introduced with a memorable list of cognomens, epithets and bynames: "Zonni the merciless, the tyrant, the oppressor, the degenerate, the accursed, the great tyrant, the arrogant one, the accursed, Zonni the Godless, the profligate, cold-hearted, the despotic one, the shedder of blood, the notorious evil-doer, the killer of so many people, that only God the most high knows the number.""

zarhay.165.t:0 "How The Mighty Have Fallen"
zarhay.165.d:0 "Zonni Zolon marched at the head of a column of soldiers down a gravel road that led to the capital of Ziani, which shone on the horizon as flames consumed it. Next to the road, he saw some old and decrepit mare quenching her thirst by drinking water from a ditch. At first he paid little attention to this lowly creature, but as they got closer he frowned. His hoof rose and the column stopped, allowing him to step aside and examine the zebra closer. The mare seemed to care more about the dirty water she was drinking than him.\n\n"...You're not Zagmandir, are you?" Zonni asked.\n"I am," the mare croaked and drank some more.\nThe regent of Zar-Hay couldn't contain his amusement. "I barely recognized your features. Why is the former garrison commander dressed in torn rags and acting like an animal?"\n"Long story."\nZonni chuckled. "Remember those negotiations about your surrender? Where I swore God would deliver His punishment upon you?"\n"I do. Gloat all you want, I care not."\n"Truly, Mazwi has fallen from grace. I should bring you to justice for all the crimes you committed against my noble people, but it seems my words came true, may God be praised. Now I feel naught but pity for you."\n"Your pity is worthless to me."\nZonni sighed, then went back to his column. He soon came back with some cloth and a waterskin. "Here, at least appear and act like a zebra, not an animal."\nThe mare finally looked up at him from the ditch, her eyes wide open in shock, her dirt-covered lips quivering."

zarhay.166.t:0 "The Traitors' Due"
zarhay.166.d_no_execution:0 "The prison building in Mzizima was now more crowded than ever, and during the day its courtyard was filled to the brim with prisoners, who had been allowed to get some fresh air under the watching eyes of the guards.\n\nA zebra mare was sitting and suckling on a twig, pretending it was a cigarette, when a group of other prisoners approached her. "Hey, what are you doing here all by yourself?" a tall and muscular stallion asked.\nShe frowned at them and didn't reply.\n"We're looking for new members for our little... association of friendly fellows. Only the toughest thugs get to join. What're you in here for? They don't send any petty thieves or such here, so must've been a pretty big deal." He chuckled to himself, as if he was proud about something horrible he had done.\n"Treason. I've been accused of collaborating with the yeti."\nThe stallion's smile faded. "You serious?"\nShe shrugged.\n"Okay, first of all, no yeti-lovers in my dang gang. Second of all, no God-forsaken yeti-lovers in this prison!" In almost an instant, he had turned around and tried to kick her. Her eyes widened and she reacted just quickly enough to avoid it, but by then the rest of the gang had descended upon her, trampling and kicking her with their hooves. As other prisoners saw the action, they hollered, cheered and even joined in, while guards quickly approached with batons prepared.\n\nAn hour later, the mare was lying in the prison's hospital, her breathing raspy and weak as her broken ribcage had punctured her lungs. "I didn't... do anything... wrong..." she muttered to herself, choosing them to be her last words."
zarhay.166.d_execution:0 "The narrow streets of Mzizima were swarming with zebras, all headed to the central square that was quickly filling up with a crowd. Zonni looked at them, eyes narrowed with suspicion, as he stood on a raised platform, accompanied by bodyguards, a small hoofful of prisoners in chains, and a grim-faced zebra armed with a large and sharp axe. "Everything is ready, my liege," the executioner said.\n"Good. Let's get this over with quickly, then," Zonni replied quietly, then raised his voice to speak to the gathered crowd.\n\n"Zebras of Mzizima! Long have you suffered under the weight of the yeti yoke, so I believe you have earned some relief, a reward to compensate for all those years of servitude. Here have I gathered those who warmly welcomed the yeti conquerors and saw them as an ally. What use do I have for such willing traitors? What zebra lord would want subjects who see his enemies as their allies? The judges condemned these zebras to be banished, but I think that is far too lenient. They deserve nothing less, nothing more, than death. Let this be a lesson to everyone here!"\n\nHe let his words sink into the audience. The traitors on the platform were either sobbing, staring blankly and smoking, or angrily glaring at Zonni. The new master of Mzizima simply glared back. "You may now carry out the sentences, executioner," he said. The axe-wielder grinned wickedly."
zarhay.166.a:0 "They got what they deserved."

SON_kingdom_with_no_king:0 "Kingdom Without A King"
SON_kingdom_with_no_king_desc:0 "The Zar-Hay were once ruled by kings and queens of the Zughe dynasty. Under their protection the city of Zao prospered and the kingdom grew wealthy. But Mazwi saw this prosperity and wanted to seize it, invading the kingdom, slaying its ruling queen and taking her foals hostage. Almost two centuries later, Mazwi suffered divine punishment delivered by the evil Storm King, yet it is widely believed the royal family of Zar-Hay perished in the chaos. We once had hope for a triumphant return of our long-lost rulers, but there has been no sign of them. The throne remains vacant and none dare seize it, fearing that the vengeful ghosts of the Zughe dynasty will curse them."

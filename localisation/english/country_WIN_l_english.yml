WIN_special_command_desc:0 "To supplement our new police forces, Generals Pillar and Beep have put a suggestion before the council. A singular unit derived from the most loyal and experienced soldiers of the rest of our forces, equipped and supplied like the elite special forces of the rest of the world. Called S.W.A.T., it shall fall under Beep's command and be the new face of Winggarden's defense."
WIN_a_new_general_command:0 "The Winggarden General Defence Council"
WIN_a_new_general_command_desc:0 "Now that our military command, as well as our rule over the city, have been solidified, we can afford to formalize our military into one cohesive whole. No longer are we a collection of mercenaries and police units, now we are the General Defense Council, the sole body responsible for the city's protection, and the one thing stopping anarchy from taking over."
WIN_local_arms_production:0 "Armament Production Optimisation"
WIN_local_arms_production_desc:0 "We can not afford to continuously bring in foreign weapons. Seriously. The budget can't fit it. In order to solve this, the Legation has sanctioned a local gunsmith open to working with us to open new industrial arms manufacturing facilities to supply the garrison's forces. This should hopefully keep our units supplied and ready to combat any insurgency."
WIN_the_legation_volunteer_force:0 "Bolster the Legation Volunteer Force"
WIN_the_legation_volunteer_force_desc:0 "The Winggarden military forces are not a conventional volunteer or even a conscripted army.

WIN_urban_warfare_expertise:0 "Urban Warfare Training"
WIN_urban_warfare_expertise_desc:0 "If we are to resist the calls of "democracy" and "freedom" from our population, we are going to need to know how to fight against any armed rising that may occur. For this, we need our troops to be expertly trained in urban warfare. Training shall be conducted in mock urban environments across North Zebrica in order to ensure our effectiveness."

WIN_chiropterran_fighters:0 "The Legation Shadowbolts"
WIN_chiropterran_fighters_desc:0 "The Chiropterran Shadowbolts are the heirs to Nightmare Moon's aerial legacy, and they pride themselves on being some of the best pilots in the world. And so, they have been polite enough to grant us our own regiment of these pilots for our city's defense."

WIN_the_air_cavalry_desc:0 "Quick response military units are always of need when one of your chief goals is resistance suppression. And for us, the providers are the elite Paratroopers of the 1st Winggarden Air Cavalry, who will form the core of our elite forces for the foreseeable future."

WIN_expand_airport_desc:0 "The Winggarden airport, once the premier civilian airfield of the Hippogriffian south, is now under Legation control.

WIN_air_fortifications:0 "Anti-Air Fortifications"
WIN_air_fortifications_desc:0 "Our air warfare capabilities will always be outshone by those of our benefactors, and even those of the Hippogriffs, so in order to defend our skies we must fight fire with ice.

We must never let the Hippogriffs take it back!"

WIN_a_forum_for_peace_desc:0 "The prime architect of the Legation, Gilippo Gappi, sees this place as a "Forum of Peace", where the powers involved can all gain something, and any creature who wants a chance to rise higher can do it here. The Chiropterrans and Colthaginians have... a different view. But since it was Gappi who formed this government, his vision will win out for now."
WIN_a_stratified_bureaucracy:0 "Stratify the Bureaucracy"
WIN_a_stratified_bureaucracy_desc:0 "The majority of the low-level bureaucrats that make Winggarden state run smoothly are from Colthage, and thus they have strong influence over the day to day running of the Legation. They have thus introduced a bill that officializes their control, establishing quotas for the national origin of certain officials, and ensuring they come out on top."
WIN_improve_trade_relations:0 "The Gappi Plan"
WIN_improve_trade_relations_desc:0 "Gappi has recently proposed another plan to the legation council, it will virtually abolish all trade tariffs within Winggarden, allowing goods and commerce to flow freely under the Legation's watchful eye. Considering the Legation's position, this will be of clear benefit to us, but it will also benefit the free trade interests of the Wingbardian representatives, increasing their influence over Legation policy."
WIN_balance_the_council:0 "Balance The Interests"
WIN_balance_the_council_desc:0 "Things have gotten a bit hectic down here in the legation, we're losing control, and our benefactors are starting to get suspicious of one another, thankfully we have one chance to make this right. Article 43b of the Winggarden Legation charter has a contingency where we can completely wipe clean our government and call on the benefactors to hash out a new one. But they won't stand for this more than once."
WIN_tighten_the_grip:0 "Tighten The Grip"
WIN_tighten_the_grip_desc:0 "Now that the Legation has formed itself into a "nation" and not just a motley crew of foreigners, we can begin to further exert our influence on this land. The Twelve Concessions are extremely vague when it comes to how much control we have, and we can use that to our advantage. Applying more pressure on Hippogrifia, we can gain more of an advantage over them, and further pressure them into decline."
WIN_an_intelligence_agency:0 "The Legation Security Service"
WIN_an_intelligence_agency_desc:0 "The Legation security service is a compound effort between all three of our benefactors. While run mainly by bats, this is a truly collaborative effort to crush all resistance to the Legation's governance through more secretive means. The Security Service's job is to ensure that our new status quo holds, and that this city thrives away from Hippogriff control."
WIN_hippogriff_volunteers:0 "The Hippogriff Volunteer Department"
WIN_hippogriff_volunteers_desc:0 "Now that our government has settled in, and the immediate threat of armed rebellion has passed, we have decided it is time to begin recruiting select locals into our police force and military.

WIN_underwater_antipartisan_operations_desc:0 "Roughly half of the Legation's de jure territory lies beneath the water's surface. It's inhabitants are seaponies, the "other half" of the Hippogriffian realm and it has presented a... unique issue for our administration. None of the three species holding guard over the Legation can breathe underwater, meaning we are having to resort to... unique methods to halt resistance to our rule in this territory."
WIN_the_joint_marine_force:0 "The Winggarden Marine Corps"
WIN_the_joint_marine_force_desc:0 "We will never be on the same level as the natives when it comes to amphibious warfare adaptations. But hopefully, by training up a foreign funded marine brigade, we can come as close as possible to evening the playing field."

WIN_the_tram_system_desc:0 "Winggarden already has an extensive tram system, even if it has not aged with grace.

WIN_the_development_bank:0 "The Winggarden Development Fund"

WIN_AGWP_investments:0 "AGWP Contracts"
WIN_AGWP_investments_desc:0 "The Wingbardian delegate has been in contact with one of the premier Wingbardian petrochemical companies, and they've signalled their interest in establishing themselves in the city. Not only would it mean Winggarden becomes the center of a world-class oil refinery, it would also be a fine feather in representative Gappi's hat."
WIN_develop_the_arsenal:0 "The Winggarden Arsenal"
WIN_develop_the_arsenal_desc:0 "Prosperity begets envy, and if Winggarden is to ensure that the prosperity built up within her city limits remains in her hooves, she must be ready to defend it. None has questioned this particular point, and for once the three representatives put equal enthusiasm into arranging for Winggarden's military industrial complex to grow."
WIN_setup_chiropterran_homes:0 "Chiropterran Military Towns"
WIN_setup_chiropterran_homes_desc:0 "Ocean Spray has argued quite fervently for the adoption of the Chiropterran system of military towns. While it would put certain quarters of the city beyond the other representatives' grasp, it would also, undoubtedly, help to fortify Winggarden in case of an attack."
WIN_seize_hippogriff_companies:0 "Nationalise Hippogriff Companies"
WIN_seize_hippogriff_companies_desc:0 "The local Hippogriff companies are a security risk, one that must be dealt with. While they've by and large played by the rules set forth, they are obvious vectors for the Hippogriffs to attempt to reassert themselves, or at least introduce spies into the city. It'll cause a stir, but they should be nationalized and placed under our control."
WIN_import_experts:0 "Invite Financial Experts"
WIN_import_experts_desc:0 "Many times, the sound advice of financial experts will get hampered by political necessity, but thankfully Winggarden offers more freedom than that. Our far-reaching control along with our sound business laws mean that economic reforms will not only be tolerable, but welcome. It's time we let the world's top financial minds know this."
WIN_the_city_on_the_hill:0 "The City On A Hill"
WIN_the_city_on_the_hill_desc:0 "Winggarden has become something rarely seen before in this world; a place where competition can reign supreme.

WIN_develop_fuel_stores:0 "The Legation Municipal Fuel Reserve"
WIN_develop_fuel_stores_desc:0 "The ever belligerent Ocean Spray has lobbied quite fervently for the creation of a municipal fuel reserve, arguing that if we are cut off from our trade partners we must be able to rely on our own fuel reserves. This 'dagger to our necks' must be addressed he insists, and of course the fact that it will advance his own goals is surely merely a coincidence." 
WIN_develop_steel_milling:0 "Develop Steel Milling"
WIN_develop_steel_milling_desc:0 "The number one metal of the modern world is not gold or silver, but steel, and Winggarden has the potential to master this metal as well as well.

WIN_high_rises:0 "The Mile High Club"
WIN_high_rises_desc:0 "Winggarden is a small place, and real estate is hard to come by. The solution is simple; build upwards! Winggarden will become a mountain range of high-rises reaching up against the sky, and in this we will become the very image of the future city, even if we have to expropriate some locals' residences to achieve it."

WIN_the_legaiton_secured:0 "The Free City"
WIN_the_legaiton_secured_desc:0 "The great game of dominance in Winggarden has come to an end not with a bang, but by grinding to a halt.

WIN_the_biggest_port:0 "The Staple Port Of Zebrica"
WIN_the_biggest_port_desc:0 "Winggarden can be the gateway to Zebrica, if she only has the space for it. With further expansions of the harbor, our tonnage capacity will be unrivalled. The future looks bright, after all, and we need to prepare for it."
WIN_underwater_hotels:0 "Vertical Development"
WIN_underwater_hotels_desc:0 "Space remains a luxury in our city, and we have already built upwards. It is time to learn from the Hippogriffs and build downwards, into the ocean. Imagine!

WIN_naval_aviation_department:0 "The Winggarden Naval Aviation Department"
WIN_naval_aviation_department_desc:0 "As part of our efforts to secure the trading lanes for both us and for our trading partners, Winggarden has acquired a large amount of long distance naval bombers which will let us protect and intervene along the lanes wherever needed."

WIN_legation_mechanisation_desc:0 "The most technologically advanced city in the world should have a military to match. Instead of slogging along by hoof, our soldiers will be able to arrive on the scene in moments, mounted in armored vehicles and striking faster than their enemies can react."
WIN_expand_volunteer_forces:0 "Unite The Volunteer Departments"
WIN_expand_volunteer_forces_desc:0 "Thanks to the legates' bickering, the myriad foreign volunteers have been organized in different, sometimes competing formations. It's a mess, but thankfully we are now in a position where we can try to unravel this twisty knot."
WIN_expand_the_council:0 "Open Up the Council"
WIN_expand_the_council_desc:0 "With the great game no longer being carried out in the halls of power, the time has come to open them to the Hippogriffs as well. There's no point in alienating the local elites, not when they are our neighbors and competitors."
WIN_permit_gatherings:0 "Permit Public Gatherings"

WIN_allow_political_parties_desc:0 "The power of the legates isn't going anywhere, it's just changing form. The recent unrest meant that reform was needed, but the power is simply moving into the shadows, from which Winggarden's original purpose can still be carried out, only in a more palatable form."
WIN_renegotiate_concessions:0 "Negotiate With the Hippogriffs"
WIN_renegotiate_concessions_desc:0 "Hippogriffia is still resenting the loss of Winggarden. This resentment will not magically vanish, but maybe we can offer them a deal?

WIN_further_urban_development:0 "Sky High"
WIN_further_urban_development_desc:0 "We're building higher and higher, and it seems like every day the tallest building in the city changes. This is our pride and joy, our finest monument to Winggarden's prosperity.

WIN_rubber_development:0 "The Winggarden Rubber Plant"
WIN_rubber_development_desc:0 "One of Winggarden's strengths is its openness to foreign business, and the newfound stability has brought investors both new and old to our shores. Among these, rubber is one of the hot new commodities. If Winggarden corners the market on synthetic rubber, we will have a product everyone will need."
WIN_legation_CAS:0 "The Legation Bomber Fleet"
WIN_legation_CAS_desc:0 "Winggarden's metropolitan landscape makes it tricky for airplanes to find their targets in case of an attack, but more easily manoeuvred light bombers or attack planes can manoeuvre around the skyscrapers if need be, and the boulevards can serve as runways if needed."
WIN_rocketry_development:0 "Changeling Ingenuity"
WIN_rocketry_development_desc:0 "We are a city that welcomes the ambitious, and the Changelings are no exception. It's strange how few are giving them a chance, but their loss is our gain, especially when some of these changeling expatriates turn out to be rocket scientists."
WIN_just_like_pegas:0 "The Las Pegasus Of Zebrica"
WIN_just_like_pegas_desc:0 "Winggarden is a centre of commerce, but its entertainment industry is booming as well. The trade will flow either way, so maybe it would behoove us to focus on making sure that all of North Zebrica knows that Winggarden is the place to come to for a good time?"
WIN_just_like_skyfall:0 "The Skyfall Of Zebrica"
WIN_just_like_skyfall_desc:0 "Any merchant worth their salt knows how Skyfall has become a cliché when speaking of a successful business centre. We can at least aim to spare Zebrica from the constant nattering about Skyfall, and we shall do so by supplanting it as the heart of international commerce across North Zebrica."
WIN_the_atomic_age:0 "The Age Of the Atom"
WIN_the_atomic_age_desc:0 "The new frontier of scientific development is in the atom, and the applications for this new technology are countless. And after all, what is Winggarden if not a haven for the experimental and the modern? Time to start experimenting on atomic level as well."

WIN_advisors_not_rulers_desc:0 "The Hippogriffs will never accept Wingbardian rule, and without Chiropterran muscle, we can never keep true control as kings in all but name. So we need to find a willing pawn, someone who can run the state for the Legation. Perhaps a local fascist will do?"

WIN_fascist_propaganda_desc:0 "Winggarden is still in a state of chaos, the citizens are looking for something to turn to, an idea to grasp onto.

WIN_integrate_the_seadwellers_desc:0 "The vast undersea has an abundance of natural resources that could be used to serve the national interest.

WIN_scaling_taxation:0 "From Each For All"
WIN_scaling_taxation_desc:0 "The old tax system of the legation completely excluded the financial classes from the burdens of taxation in the service of commercial interests.

In short, we need money—badly. Zahummid is willing to do whatever it takes to get that money, and if some "creative accounting" is required, then so be it!"
WIN_take_out_loans:0 "A Small Loan"
WIN_take_out_loans_desc:0 "Good news! Zahummid has received a letter from an eccentric pony named Coffee Bean, owner of the mercenary company Bean Security, in which he expressed his willingness to give us a loan. This in itself is exciting, but the possibility of further collaboration with Bean Security is even more promising."
WIN_bribe_local_leaders:0 "The Power Of Money"
WIN_bribe_local_leaders_desc:0 "As if we didn't have enough headaches, local hippogriff leaders are stirring up trouble among the populace and inciting citizens against us. However, there is a very simple and effective way to get them on our side and put a stop to these vicious attacks. All it requires is greasing a few claws..."
WIN_hire_the_mercs:0 "Partner Up With Bean Security"
WIN_hire_the_mercs_desc:0 "The sad fact is that we are incapable of maintaining order in the city with our own meagre forces. Fortunately, a solution has presented itself: if we hire him, Coffee Bean has offered to come to Winggarden along with a sizeable force of Bean Security mercenaries. With these well-trained soldiers on our side, we will have nothing to fear!"
WIN_our_position_secured:0 "The Colthago Nuovo Project"
WIN_our_position_secured_desc:0 "Now that our position has been secured, we can finally stop scrambling around addressing crisis after crisis, and start turning our eyes towards the future: towards Colthago Nuovo, and the glorious destiny that awaits us. After all, Zahummid has grand designs, and he's only just getting started..."

WIN_marketplace_of_ideas_desc:0 "We're going to make this place somewhere where any creature can come in with an idea, and walk out with either a no strings attached pile of cash to make it happen, or squat. If it's a good enough idea, we'll take it, we need everything we can get to fight against this world of tyrants."
WIN_foreign_ties:0 "Foreign Business Ties"
WIN_foreign_ties_desc:0 "Over my years in the business I've known a lot of wealthy creatures, never cared for most of them, but they have the bits. And now that I own this city, well I'm in a better contract negotiating position than I've ever been in before. Time to open up the gates of commerce."
WIN_actual_plasmids:0 "The Plasmid Project"
WIN_actual_plasmids_desc:0 "A Kirin biologist from Yale showed me this paper he wrote a good few years ago, when I was contracting some mercs for the Empire. He swore to me that there were these little genetic blips all over our bodies that gave us the abilities we say are "magical." I think the bucker called 'em "plasmids" or something dumb like that. I think he's still kicking, let's invite him home."

WIN_gateway_to_zebrica_desc:0 "There's only one place that deserves to be Zebrica's staple port. And that's Winggarden, we've got the freest markets, the freest people, and the best investors. Whether you're transporting fruit or trafficking weapons, my city's the place to do it. Just make sure to pay for security."
WIN_urban_redevelopment:0 "Urban Renewal"
WIN_urban_redevelopment_desc:0 "Damn, those Legates really bucked this place up. All full of barracks and forts, like they can try to control a free people. Well, it falls to me and the guys to fix this place up. I want real estate and development companies on the line ASAP, I have great ideas for this place, I'll call it Coffee Street."
WIN_abolish_the_business_tax:0 "The Single Tax Policy"
WIN_abolish_the_business_tax_desc:0 "Taxes are dumb, I've always known that, and gods willing, I could be done with them forever. But I need to run a country now, so I'll keep it simple. If you own land in Winggarden, I can tax you for that. Nothing else. Go wild and let the market guide y'all." #You have one single tax, the tax for being a citizen 
WIN_social_liberation:0 "Social Liberalisation"
WIN_social_liberation_desc:0 "A restrained market comes from a restrained citizenry. I've been all over the world, and anywhere creatures suffer from poverty and a lack of freedom, it's always because the government tells them how to live their lives. Well to Tartarus with that! Thou shalt do what thou wilt! I couldn't care less."
WIN_nightwatch_state:0 "The Nightwatchgriff State"
WIN_nightwatch_state_desc:0 "We want the market to judge who is fit to prosper here in Winggarden, the issue is that those who fail in this regard often get a bit uppity and decide to beat the snot out of whoever was simply better than them. If there's only one thing this little government I'm setting up should do, it's prevent that."
WIN_harmonise_laws:0 "The Libertarian Charter"
WIN_harmonise_laws_desc:0 "All the work we've done is fine and dandy, but we need to put it all in writing. I've worked for a solid... three hours on writing our governing charter, and then I've been bored out of my mind for the last sixteen while my associates "make it make sense," a bunch of bums they are. But as long as it stays true to my ideas, it'll work great."
WIN_regulations_begone:0 "Economic Deregulation"
WIN_regulations_begone_desc:0 "Monitoring how businesses operate is useless. You either stifle their profits and force creatures into poverty, or you make them angry, and they start doing "crimes." As long as the local butcher isn't murdering his neighbour in the streets, we have no reason to regulate business practices. Their money is their own to make."
WIN_allow_vice:0 "Drugs, Sex And Rock And Roll"
WIN_allow_vice_desc:0 "Drugs, alcohol, music, and all the lovely things that come with it. These have been probably the most lucrative trades throughout all of history. Some even say the first trades. The regimes of the world fear their power and influence, because they control the people through flimsy moral codes and legal regulations. Here in Winggarden, we don't fear these things. We enjoy them a lot—all of them."
WIN_the_right_to_happiness:0 "The Principle Of Equality"
WIN_the_right_to_happiness_desc:0 "This one's pretty simple. Every creature in Winggarden is equal to every other creature. I don't care who the buck you are, I care if you want to pay me or not."
WIN_the_great_city:0 "A Truly Free City"
WIN_the_great_city_desc:0 "Well, I did it. The city's bustling like never before, and I've made a whole lot of money. I'm pretty bucking good at this now that I think about it. I should reward myself with a nice drink down at the new club, make some new mare friends. Try to enjoy myself for a bit. Since there's a lot more work still to be done."
WIN_the_open_door_policy:0 "Land Of Opportunity"
WIN_the_open_door_policy_desc:0 "In Winggarden, anyone can be at home. If you can make it here, you can damn well make it anywhere. Why would I ever try to stop you? The market decided you were good for my city, so I'm going to let you stay."
WIN_the_libertalia_experiment:0 "The Dream Of Libertalia"
WIN_the_libertalia_experiment_desc:0 "This'll be the big test, if everything I've accomplished is going to work. I'm bored with just this city, I want something more. The Hippogriffs are suffering, they lost the war against the leatherwings and their allies, and their government couldn't do anything to help them. They should see by now that we're the better option. We can give them real freedom. For Libertalia!" #*snorts line of cocaine* It's bucking go time baby.
WIN_work_with_the_hippogriffs:0 "Abolish The Invisible Ceiling"
WIN_work_with_the_hippogriffs_desc:0 "The Legates and their tyrant daddies feared the hippogriffs, they feared their fighting spirit, their want for freedom. They're creatures just the same as the rest of us, and with the failure of their Queen and Equestrianist """harmony""" it'll be easy to make them come around to our way of thinking. They'll make great business partners too."
WIN_non_interventionism:0 "Set The Market Free"
WIN_non_interventionism_desc:0 "We don't want to intervene in the market. That's boring and obstructive. The will of the market is the best way to run an economy, and us having any hoof in it is just going to make it worse."
WIN_freedom_of_information:0 "Freedom Of Information"
WIN_freedom_of_information_desc:0 "Press censorship is the step before market regulation. Control the information, and the people will never know how free they can truly be. So, I'm going to make sure the reporters and the whistleblowers will never be silenced. And maybe start a newspaper while I'm at it."
WIN_decentralized_education:0 "Notchian Education"
WIN_decentralized_education_desc:0 "Education mandated by a government is a stupid idea. A citizen isn't allowed to wake up one morning and say "I want to work with my hooves and my heart" and go off and be a construction worker or something. So we're going to make a new education model. You don't need to go to school, but if you do, you need to show what you're worth. Then a company can sponsor your studies. I swear it's perfect."
WIN_abolish_the_volunteer_force:0 "Abolish The Legation Volunteer Force"
WIN_abolish_the_volunteer_force_desc:0 "The Legation "volunteers" were tools of foreign dictatorships. Not a native Winggardener among them, and they had the gall to try and keep the citizens down. Idiots. All of them. Military service is an investment in your future, all us mercs know that. So service in... service... of our... not-state will be on a volunteer only basis.\nGods I need a drink."
WIN_expand_bean_presence:0 "Bean Security Proliferation"
WIN_expand_bean_presence_desc:0 "If we're to guard our little experiment here, we need some more bodies. I'll call in all my trusted associates. Taffy, Hans, even du Trot. I'll call them all and they'll bring their boys. We'll protect this place by the market and for the market. Just need to make sure my bank account stays full."
WIN_localised_militias:0 "The Right To Bear Arms"
WIN_localised_militias_desc:0 "Freedom from tyranny does not mean freedom from threat. All our citizens deserve to have the absolute right to self-defence, and this includes all weapons from antique Lake City katanas to a nuke for all I care. For recreation or defence, it's all allowed. Hopefully, they'll enjoy this freedom, and be ready to take up arms when the time comes. For the right price of course."
WIN_mercenary_expertise:0 "Soldiers Of Fortune"
WIN_mercenary_expertise_desc:0 "I've worked with a lot of other merc firms over the years. All fine folks, except the ones that aren't. But that doesn't matter now. What matters is we need guns, ammo, creatures, and creatures with guns. And these contacts are going to get them all for me."
WIN_quality_over_quantity:0 "In The Defence Of Liberty"
WIN_quality_over_quantity_desc:0 "These mercs we've been calling in are starting to settle down. It's easy to see why they like it here, a city built by a merc for people like us. And these creatures, from young to old, know what they fight for. The fight to do whatever we damn well please. That's patriotism right there, and there ain't nothing better."
WIN_bean_mechanical_corps:0 "The Bean Mechanized Security Corps"
WIN_bean_mechanical_corps_desc:0 "Alright, it's time to bring in the big guns. I had a R&D gig over in a black site in Klugetown working on some stolen changeling cockroach tech. It's up and running now and I can unveil it in my new home. Gods this place is great."
WIN_private_military_industry:0 "Private Defence Contracts"
WIN_private_military_industry_desc:0 "To defend Winggarden against all those nasty tyrants who want to steal our freedom, we're gonna need guns, and lots of them. Since we can't make enough ourselves, we'll just contract private sector firms to help out. And hey, once we've got a surplus, we can export some to foreign countries. Sounds like a win-win!"
WIN_the_winggarden_airport:0 "Refurbish The Winggarden Airport"
WIN_the_winggarden_airport_desc:0 "Have you seen the airport recently? What a joke! That place is falling apart and is clearly strained beyond capacity. We've got to fix those design problems right away and modernise it. A good redevelopment plan should make the place much more efficient."
WIN_private_aircraft_fleet:0 "The Winggarden Aerial Defence Force"
WIN_private_aircraft_fleet_desc:0 "Creatures with guns are our bread and butter, but advancements in warfare necessitate that we get eyes on the ground. If the next big theatre of war is the air then we've got to keep pace, and I've got a couple of old friends I can pump for knowledge and contacts, that'll let us get the aeronautic industry jump started. "
WIN_parrarel_development:0 "Unmothball The Legation Fleet"
WIN_parrarel_development_desc:0 "When those Legation clowns high-tailed it out of here, they sure left behind a lot of stuff. I mean, there's a whole fleet of perfectly good boats just sitting around collecting dust! Let's take those warships out of storage and start using them: it's just common sense."
WIN_underwater_cities:0 "Vertical Urban Development"
WIN_underwater_cities_desc:0 "Winggarden is great but hampered in terms of expansion. I have all these plans I've thrown at the wall and they all come back to one thing. Build out, or build up. Since out isn't an option, we'll build upwards. I've got a few favours owed so I'll call in a low cost construction company, get some vertical construction underway and see how much more space that brings me to use."
WIN_underwater_volunteer_corps:0 "Seapony Integration"
WIN_underwater_volunteer_corps_desc:0 "Seaponies are amazing! Not only are they incredibly useful when it comes to carrying out combat operations in maritime environments, they're also helpful when you need to get important packages into the country without the authorities getting on your flank about it."

WIN_the_politics_of_power:0 "Wrangling The Reins Of Power"
WIN_the_politics_of_power_desc:0 "Huh, turns out running a country is even more complicated than running a city. Now that we've completely wrecked the foundations of the old Hippogriff state, we have to replace it with... something. This is gonna be a pain."
WIN_court_of_public_opinion:0 "Complete Judicial Decentralisation"
WIN_court_of_public_opinion_desc:0 "I've always been sceptical of the so-called "justice system." Why should some fancy judge get to decide what's right or wrong just because they have a law degree? The only court that needs to matter is the court of public opinion. Let them decide!"
WIN_pay_for_citizenship:0 "The Pay For Citizenship Program"
WIN_pay_for_citizenship_desc:0 "Last night it came to me. Folks will buy anything if they want it enough, right? "Well buck me!" I thought. "Why not let them buy the right to live here?" Make a thriving place where somecreature can start with nothing and the only limit is themselves, their entrepreneurial skill and their imagination. It's a brilliant idea. Gods, I'm a genius."
WIN_the_shining_city_on_a_hill:0 "The Shining Gem Of Zebrica"
WIN_the_shining_city_on_a_hill_desc:0 "Let's be honest: most countries in the world aren't great to live in. If your government isn't oppressing you, they're robbing you blind. But Libertalia is different, we're a refuge of liberty! A land of free creatures proving that science, liberty, happiness, and prosperity can all exist in peace. Now how's that for a sales pitch? Pretty damn good, if I do say so myself."
WIN_complete_equalisation:0 "Libertarian Egalitarianism"
WIN_complete_equalisation_desc:0 "Libertalia is a land of opportunity for all. I've said it before: I don't give a buck who you are. Male or female. Pony, zebra, hippogriff, or changeling really doesn't matter. Sure, we're all different, but everycreature is equal when it comes to their right to make a boatload of money!"
WIN_protect_natural_rights:0 "Ensure Natural Rights"
WIN_protect_natural_rights_desc:0 "I'll admit I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer, but even I know there are certain rights that all creatures are born with, and that no government can take away. We need to make sure every one of our citizens knows that, too. Maybe then they'll calm down a bit..."
WIN_coopt_hippogriff_institutions:0 "Coopt Hippogriffian Institutions"
WIN_coopt_hippogriff_institutions_desc:0 "Since trying to run this place on my own is giving me a migraine, it might be a good idea to bring more hippogriffs with actual administrative experience into the fold. Once we've got them working for us, things should run much more smoothly around here, hopefully netting me more free time."
WIN_the_libertalian_identity:0 "The Libertalian Identity"
WIN_the_libertalian_identity_desc:0 "Being a Libertalian isn't about what race you are, it's an idea. It's being respectful of each individual's right to personal security, personal liberty, and private property. It's having a go-getting, entrepreneurial spirit. It's loving freedom, and fighting like Tartarus against any tyrants who try to steal it away!"
WIN_chamber_of_corporations:0 "The Chamber Of Corporations"
WIN_chamber_of_corporations_desc:0 "This is getting to be a headache, and I haven't got time for that. The guys I picked to give me advice are... really bad, honestly. I'm firing them and going to go with a new idea of mine. I'll institute an advisory board of the companies that operate in Libertalia. They'll know the best things to do to keep trade flowing and the markets stable, and I can keep an ear in on what they're doing."
WIN_corporate_centralism:0 "Corporate Cartelisation"
WIN_corporate_centralism_desc:0 "Power's gotta be concentrated somewhere, what better place than in an association of companies? This coalition of corporations will promote the mutual interest of all citizens. And if it doesn't, who cares? I'm outta here soon anyway."
WIN_the_new_libertalian_economy:0 "The Invisible Claw"
WIN_the_new_libertalian_economy_desc:0 "Lemme tell you the magic of a free market system: a bunch of creatures, each acting in their own self-interest, compete with each other and in the end everycreature benefits, like there's an invisible claw guiding everything. Just don't let the government get in the way, and that claw's gonna take us to paradise!"
WIN_project_ARPANET:0 "Project ARPANET"
WIN_project_ARPANET_desc:0 "For Libertalia to keep on thriving, we need to be competitive with the electronic advancements and technologies made in other countries. It seems smart to found a multicorporate joint research collaboration and assistance project, in order that Libertalia remains on top of other states. This'll allow our eggheads to work better and give us an edge over our neighbours, and any edge is a good edge."
WIN_integrate_hippogriffian_inteligentista:0 "Integrate The Hippogriffian Inteligentista"
WIN_integrate_hippogriffian_inteligentista_desc:0 "Now that the dust has settled and things are on the up, we can take stock of the locals and weed out the useful ones. The smart hippogriffs can surely see the benefit of what we're doing here. We've just got to get them on board with a few juicy tidbits, and the rest will follow. Plus, it'll help keep them in line which will improve things no end."
WIN_recomepnsate_big_bussiness:0 "Shake Hooves With Big Business"
WIN_recomepnsate_big_bussiness_desc:0 "Now I've shown the potential here, a couple of old contacts reached out and showed interest. Useful thing is, they're all able to get more business investing into Libertalia. Either that, or they know someone who wants to invest or get involved. Now nobody can deny that system works, and I can use that to make opportunities. More opportunities means more contacts, and more money makes me happy."
WIN_replace_soothing_song:0 "The Vigor Project" #Refining the Plasmids with a new formula that has lower chances of killing people
WIN_replace_soothing_song_desc:0 "Reports from Soothing Song's research teams indicate that the 'plasmid' advancement is progressing. However, the attrition rate in test subjects isn't the best. Survivors of the initial procedure have a high chance of developing mental or physical issues. Refining the formula involved to make it 'safer' should reduce this. We'll call it 'Vigor' because that sounds healthy, strong and cool."
WIN_private_nuclear_programs:0 "The Bean Security Nuclear Research Department"
WIN_private_nuclear_programs_desc:0 "Looks like there's a buncha countries out there researching nuclear weapons—it's time I got in on the action. Apparently these nukes make for a pretty good deterrent, so you can be damn sure that once Libertalia's got one, nobodys gonna tread on us. I'll start a private nuclear programme and hire the best and brightest, they'll have it done in a flash."
WIN_abolish_state_ownership:0 "Mass Privatisation"
WIN_abolish_state_ownership_desc:0 "Government-run industries always get bogged down in bureaucratic hooey. I'm sick of it: the state should take its hooves out of the economy. We're gonna sell off public ownership in everything, completely abolishing state ownership. After all, private companies'll have an incentive to do things better to increase profits."
WIN_increase_merc_pay:0 "Expand The Soldiers Without Borders Program"
WIN_increase_merc_pay_desc:0 "The plan to advertise our mercs has gone great so far. Next step, do more but better. More troops, more guns, more training and everything else. Doesn't do the program any favors if our troopers can't hit the broad side of a barn, though. It surely won't hurt if the grunts advertise their services proactively, too. That should bring in more contracts."
WIN_develop_magical_equipment:0 "Magical Deterrence"
WIN_develop_magical_equipment_desc:0 "So mercs on the ground is great, but holding land or fulfilling contracts without excessive bloodshed is a pain. We need guns that don't kill but discourage resisting. If we fund development into those, it'll pay out when we get 'policing actions' to do. The optics for leaving bodies doesn't sit well with the market. After all, a troublemaker today is a potential client tomorrow, and business is good."
WIN_expand_private_contracts:0 "Commission Hippogriffian Defence Contractors"
WIN_expand_private_contracts_desc:0 "I just had a brilliant idea: let's make deals with Hippogriff companies to buy products for our mercs. It might get a bit awkward, since they're the same manufacturers who made the guns that were shooting at us not too long ago, but that's all water under the bridge! When you sell weapons, it doesn't matter who's using them, as long as you're making a profit."
WIN_libertalian_territorial_guard:0 "The Libertalian Territorial Guard"
WIN_libertalian_territorial_guard_desc:0 "Having a world class mercenary program is well and good, but it won't hurt to dedicate some effort towards defence here at home. A lot of trade goes through here and we need creatures with guns ready in the event they have to stand to and protect it, providing the payment clears. Of course, we'll make sure that they spread the good word as much as possible, because a kid today is a future soldier tomorrow."
WIN_standardise_the_contracts:0 "Standardise PMC Contracts"
WIN_standardise_the_contracts_desc:0 "Deployments of the enhanced merc program have been productive. Feedback has been positive for the most part. However, our analysts advise that it would be better if clients are given template contracts with additions for specialist duties as required. The faster I get the troops out there, the faster I make money."
WIN_special_forces_proliferation:0 "The Tip Of The Spear"
WIN_special_forces_proliferation_desc:0 "Now that the contracts are flying thick and fast, we need to make our mercs even more formidable. It isn't just their hides on the line, but my reputation and the reputation of Libertalia. Having the meanest, roughest and toughest personnel who can handle the stickiest situations with relative ease just means we can charge more for their services."
WIN_the_paratrooper_corps:0 "Air Cavalry Tactics"
WIN_the_paratrooper_corps_desc:0 "My analyst guys say that there's a gap in the market for clandestine missions. Real sneak 'em up work, fast and dirty operators. They've come up with slogans, the basics for an advance training regimen, the works. Hit 'em hard, hit 'em fast. Shock and awe, that good stuff. It'll look great on recruitment posters, and we can jack up the contract pay for elite troopers and hazardous missions."
WIN_open_up_the_ports:0 "Open Up The Ports"
WIN_open_up_the_ports_desc:0 "Libertalia is a land of freedom for all. Everycreature is welcome to come here and start a new life, and we're not gonna demand a passport, no police goons are gonna hassle you, and you can be damn sure the government ain't gonna meddle in your affairs. All that matters is your talent, energy, and perseverance, so come on over!"
WIN_libertarian_homesteading:0 "Libertalian Homesteading Act"
WIN_libertarian_homesteading_desc:0 "I just noticed, we've got all this government land just sitting around not being put to productive use. Why don't we let creatures apply for a land grant to get a piece? There's more than enough to go around, and it'll allow loads of new independent farmers to own and operate their very own farms: sounds like freedom to me."
WIN_outline_settlement_regions:0 "Outline Settlement Zones"
WIN_outline_settlement_regions_desc:0 "Ok, so, the homesteading plan is gonna need some refinement. The whole point of this thing is to grant land for agriculture, but it looks like creatures are scrambling and grabbing areas that are too hostile to farm viably. But that's fine, we'll just point future applicants towards the best places to settle down."
WIN_fill_the_silver_reserve:0 "Fill Up The Silver Reserves"
WIN_fill_the_silver_reserve_desc:0 "Whilst looking between the lines, I've seen a lot of scope for my own investment opportunities into some resources in Libertalia. It'll be easy for me to just make a couple of shell companies, use them to buy up a buckload of silver or something, then sit on it until I'm free and clear and far away from here."
WIN_clear_out_the_jungles:0 "Jungle Clearance"
WIN_clear_out_the_jungles_desc:0 "This thick jungle and overgrowth is a nightmare. The land is ripe for harvesting and exploitation, but we need to deal with the hundreds of acres of trees and undergrowth first. Thankfully, I know some guys who wouldn't say no to a little 'slash and burn' operation. Once they've taken care of that, we can move people there and make good commercial use of the land, as well as fully utilise the resources."
WIN_cash_crop_plantations:0 "Coffee Bean's Coffee Beans Inc."
WIN_cash_crop_plantations_desc:0 "With formerly jungle areas cleared, I've taken another look at the land and found it to be optimal for commercial agriculture. Apparently, that coffee stuff that some creatures like will grow well here. I'll get a head start and found a company here and dedicate it to production and distribution of coffee at a premium. Should turn a tidy profit in doing so, since there's all this labour force needing utilised."
WIN_the_freest_trade:0 "A Truly Free Market"
WIN_the_freest_trade_desc:0 "Well horseapples, we've really done it. In Libertalia, the full potential of a free market has truly been unleashed. I'm talking zero government intervention: we've got the freest trade this world has ever seen! I've also made a ton of money for myself, but it's what I deserve. After all, none of this would've been possible without me."
WIN_a_farewell_to_libertalia:0 "Farewell To Libertalia"
WIN_a_farewell_to_libertalia_desc:0 "It's time for me to get out of here. Everything is in place for my exit, and nocreature seems the wiser. I've got assets and funds set aside, a few shell companies happily pumping me a cut of the pie and importantly, made a bigger name for myself. That'll be useful for the next project. For now though, I'm thinking a beach somewhere quiet, somewhere with pretty mares and booze that flows freely."

### Events ###
legation.1.t:0 "The Birth Of The Legation City"
legation.1.d:0 "As he lit up a cigar and leaned back in his comfy chair, Gilippo Gappi could hardly keep himself from smiling. Puffs of smoke drifted upward, and the griffon mentally pat himself on the shoulder.\n\nHe deserved it, after all. His ingenious idea, Winggarden, an international city of unlimited potential, his legacy to future generations, had actually come to fruition.\n\nHe had had to call in all the favours he'd accumulated over the years so to have a seat at the negotiating table, that was true, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs back in Karthin had been timid at first to the idea. Those bureaucrats saw little to be gained from a continued involvement in Zebrica. Unless it was Abyssinia, of course.\n\nGappi scoffed contemptuously. Why waste energy and blood in bringing an arid land to heel when Aris was just there, bloodily beaten and ripe for the taking? The fame that Winggarden was about to shower him with would outshine anything else, and the wealth extracted from it would silence all the nay-sayers.\n\nGlancing down upon his desk, his wandering eyes caught the two dossiers laying there. He realized he shouldn't have done so, as his good mood waned a bit. Sharing his project with somegriff else had not seemed like anything to worry about at first, but now? That might prove a problem in the long run. He would need to tread carefully from now on, but Gappi was confident. With some luck and skill, the Legation could work.\n\nAfter all, there would doubtlessly be plenty of money for all those involved. And if experience had taught him anything, was that money was an excellent incentive to keep things stable.\n\nShaking his head, Gappi went back to enjoying his expensive Sicameon-made cigar. He refused to let those thoughts ruin his perfectly good mood; instead, the griffon focused his attention to the promising future that waited for him.\n\nHe had already received overtures from many Wingbardian companies, so that they could tap into the novel market that was the Legation City.\n\nAnd, as the soon-to-be Legate, he could afford himself to be choosy."
legation.1.a:0 "Let the money flow!"

legation.2.t:0 "The Start Of Something Beautiful"
legation.2.d:0 ""Absolutely no! I don't care how sensible you may believe it is, I will not allow it. And that's the end of it!" Zillquat Zaladid snarled, eyes narrowed in fury. He was standing now with both hooves planted firmly upon the roundtable. If Sonar Beep was to take a guess from the way his eyebrow kept on twitching, the Colthaginian was on the brink of smashing it.\n\nSo, she wisely decided to remain silent, waiting for Zaladid's anger to subside. Eventually, it worked. The stallion sat back in his chair with a tired sigh and took another sip from his teacup.\n\n"He's right, you know," Gevese said. The griffon took one last pull from his cigarette before smothering it in an ashtray.\n\n"It's not that I don't see the necessity of it, mind you. Unlike dear Zaladid here, I find it quite reasonable. In fact, I would be in favour to it." He feigned not to notice the ugly look thrown his way by the Colthaginian. "However, I'm afraid that a centralized command it's not applicable at the moment. My own troops will refuse following a foreigner, no matter what the chain of command says. Especially after last week."\n\nDespite her disappointment, Sonar Beep made an effort to nod solemnly. It had been a long shot anyway. There was little hope in trying to implement a system of command and control similar to the Chiropterran one, no matter how much Ocean Spray insisted. The military forces in the city were simply too heterogenous and would not accept being placed under a unified command.\n\nEspecially Ocean Spray's.\n\n"I understand the issue. If this is your final answer, then I will not push it any further," Sonar Beep said. Then, she smiled politely. "I do however propose a compromise. A more decentralized structure, combined with a joint council of all high-ranking military personnel. It would be flexible, and a good foundation for further improvement."\n\nHer Colthaginian and Wingbardian colleague seemed to mull over the proposition for a bit. Gevese was the first to answer, "That is acceptable. Just please, make sure that legate of yours doesn't order us to shell protesters with mortars again. I nearly got a mutiny on my claws.""
legation.2.a:0 "It's a start..."

legation.3.t:0 "A Night Out"
legation.3.d:0 "Zillquat took another long sip from his blonde beer, before loudly putting it back down with a smack. How that poor glass has survived that much mistreatment for the last two hours, none could be really sure.\n\n"So, there we were," Zillquat continued, eyes bright with elation, "cut off from the main body, short on ammunition, and with the bloody Coltvans closing in from all sides. Quite the situation, eh? And if that wasn't enough, our commanding officer had decided to be a complete moron and order a full-on frontal assault, because no matter the situation, it can always get worse."\n\nSonar Beep listened carefully, eyes wide, her own drink forgotten by her side. Not in a million years would she have expected this, but there it was. The usually rough-mannered and reserved Colthaginian could get quite talkative after a drink or two and by the Nightmare, he really didn't want to stop anytime soon.\n\n"What did you do then?" Gevese asked, before taking another pull from his cigarette.\n\nZillquat smiled impishly. "Well, given the situation, I decided that drastic action was required. So, I bucked the idiot right in the head. And you'll never guess, the little bastard wet himself too!"\n\nRaucous laughter exploded around the table. Even the usually stone-faced Marble Pillar smiled, only for a brief moment though. "So anyway, that's the story of how I got my first command. General Beep, it's your turn."\n\n"Really? I thought it was Gevese's."\n\n"Oh no," the griffon shook his head. "Mine is the embarrassing one, so we are leaving the best for last, as we've agreed."\n\nSonar Beep nodded. "I guess that's fair." She took a long sip from her beverage as an encouragement, then she began. "Alright so, first of all, I want to point out that what I'm about to say it's one-hundred percent true. Ask Marble Pillar here if you don't believe me."\n\n"Oh dear Nightmare," the mare groaned, "You want to tell them about that time, don't you?" That gained the attention of every creature at the table.\n\nSadly, when the Winggarden General Staff woke up the next morning, half of them with a splitting headache, none could quite remember what the story was about. That proved to be not that big of an issue though; they would all agree afterward that, whatever the subject was, it had been probably hilarious."
legation.3.a:0 "Thank the Nightmare we're here!"

legation.4.t:0 "My Chemical Romance"
legation.4.d:0 "Deep within the tunnels below Winggarden, a group of military officers runs down a dimly lit hallway. Once one of the city's defensive redoubts against invasion, this tunnel network now serves as the paths by which the Legation military quickly moves about the city. And storming down corridor 3c, with papers in hoof, comes generals Marble Pillar and Sonar Beep. Inbound on room 14, also known as "The Nightmare Chamber," the office of Ocean Spray.\n\nEntering the room with a slam of the door, the figures already in the room turn to face them. Generals Zaladid and Gevese had already arrived and were speaking with Ocean Spray, after a couple of quick salutes the Chiropterrans place down the papers they'd been holding. Detailed maps of what was going on in the city. For the first time in the Legation's history, there was an organized mass protest on the streets. The shock of losing the war had kept the Hippogriffs tame for a while, but now they were back and angry.\n\nGeneral Pillar began, "They've occupied some of the main boulevards, the port, and the plaza around city hall. Gilippo is under siege in there and needs to be relieved. We've been preparing for this day for a while now, and we need to act fast. His guards can only hold out so long. I, for one, favor a strike operation to get him out, followed by a conventional surround tactic up Lunar Road and starving the protest out. They'll back down eventually. Zaladid then spoke up, "These protesters will be at our necks if we let them stay around any longer. We need to march a single column up the street, and they will part and let us through to Gappi. Or we will make them."\n\nThe commanders debated for a minute, not quite coming to a consensus before Ocean Spray himself lifted a hoof, "Gentlecreatures, the solution here is simple. A few days ago, I received a personal gift from my Lady Commander Emerald Light, which we can use to sort out this issue nice and quick." The commanders around Spray leaned in, intrigued what the Chiropterran representative had received. "We have been blessed by the Nightmare," Spray triumphantly declared, "with a shipment of methylphosphonofluoridate."\n\nThe generals stood for a moment, unsure what Ocean Spray meant. Reading the room, he explained, "Also known as sarin gas." At this, the room exploded, general Gevese spit out the coffee and began to curse wildly in his native tongue. Zaladid slammed his hoof on the desk and exclaimed, "Are you insane! Are you recommending we unleash a nerve agent on the population of the city! In the middle of the government district!" "By the Nightmare, I am general!" Spray responded. As their voices rose, a crack shot up in the air as General Sonar Beep fired a blank out of his pistol into the air. "Representative Spray! You are not a military officer, the use of sarin gas on the population will not be authorized. Though if I remember, you also received tear gas in that shipment. Something much more appropriate for the situation. We must act fast, I move we authorize the police to use this tear gas to disperse the protestors, and then we move in to get Gappi out of there. All in favor?"\n\nAll in the room besides Spray raised their hooves and claws. "Passed. Now let's get moving.""
legation.4.a:0 "Did somepony give him his pills for the day?"

legation.5.t:0 "On Patrol"
legation.5.d:0 "The two massive police officers - one griffon and one thestral - slowly strode down the street, both of them clad in heavy combat armor and carrying massive twelve milimeter rifles. Neither of them seemed overly encumbered by it either, and as they approached, hippogriffs, ponies and zebras all got out of the way in fear. The street market had been bustling, but now it was near empty, with only the occasional stall owners trying desperately to pack their wares up and step out of the way. One of the stall owners dropped a box of fruits, one of them rolling over the pavement and coming to a stop right in front of the leading griffon, who stopped and stared the shall owner down before picking up the orange.\n\n"Your papers, citizen?" the griffon asked, his voice rumbling inside the massive armor. The hippogriff backed away in fear at first, but the sight of the massive weapons made him dismiss any thought of fleeing, and he slowly walked behind the stall and took out his papers, which the thestral took and looked over, putting the orange back in the box.\n\n"These permits are due for renewal," the thestral informed him, the hippogriff stammering out an apology before being cut off. "Also, while you apply, make sure to ask for a AV-11 permit regarding fresh fruit, it was only signed into law a week ago, and may have missed it."\n\n"I-um... yes..." the Hippogriff began, trailing off.\n\n"Make sure to inform your fellow salescreatures of this as well," the griffon told him, "This market has done a lot of good for the local community, and it would be a shame to see it closed down. We will be patrolling here regularly, so do not hesitate to ask us if you have any questions. We are based at 5th Claw and Beak, and all relevant forms can be found there. Is there anything else you need, citizen?"\n\n"I don't think so?" the hippogriff didn't know what to think of this entire thing. The two officers simply nodded in response.\n\n"Good day, citizen," the thestral said as they began down the street again, leaving the market goers and stall owners to peek out from their hiding spots after the pair."
legation.5.a:0 "That was unexpected... but why the anti-tank rifles?"

legation.6.t:0 "Special Winggarden Assault Teams"
legation.6.d:0 ""You are the hammer that will crush all that stand before the legation authorities!" The thestral thundered as he walked back and forth in front of the black-clothed, heavily armored police officers, "Like a dagger, you will cut to the very heart of those who stand defiant, wreaking such havoc that-"\n\nBAP! his voice was cut off as the baton hit his leg and he gasped in pain, clutching his leg as he hobbled to the side, revealing the police chief that had come up behind him.\n\n"What he MEANT TO SAY..." the police chief said patiently, glaring at the police captain as he nursed his bruised leg, "Is that as part of our policing strategy, we aim to keep the regular officers for regular police work, and deploy the elite - you - for situations that exceed their capacities. Hostage situations, armed robberies, crazed mages, and so forth." The captain had recovered by now and came up to continue.\n\n"And to this end, you must be ready to wreak the ultimate violence upon all that stand before you. Give neither quarter nor mercy, for-"BAP!\n\n"He MEANS that you must above all else be disciplined and predictable in the field. Those who resist must be subdued, those who use lethal force must be neutralized, those who comply must be safe. There cannot be any doubt among the citizenry about what will lead to what. If they play along, they are safe, if they don't, they will be dealt with."\n\n"And above all else!" The captain began again, "Remember that you are instruments of vengeance-"BAP!\n\n"Of law and order..." the chief sighed. "When you are deployed, you are still police officers, and a successful deployment will not only deal with the issue at hoof, but it will also impress the population and show them just how capable the WPD is. This will inspire confidence, and confidence in the police will-"BAP! The captain had barely even opened his mouth this time. "-lead to trust. Each and every one here will have the highest standards placed on them for that reason. The eyes of the world will be upon you, and if we do well, we will be the vanguard of a new era. Good luck, officers.""
legation.6.a:0 "Yes ma'am!"

legation.7.t:0 "The Meeting"
legation.7.d:0 ""Very well, mares and gentlecolts. Listen up," Marble Pillar began, on hoof pointed on the map spread across the table. The most prominent members of the newly established Defence Council had been summoned there and, much to Marble Pillar satisfaction, they had answered it without hesitation.\n\n"Through various means, the Security Service managed to pinpoint the location of one of the most prominent resistance hubs in the city. The targets are various warehouses near the waterfront, and we suspect they're currently being used to house imported weaponry."\n\n"What's the enemy strength?" Gevese asked from his seat, eyes never leaving the map. "I mean numbers and equipment as well. Who are we dealing with?"\n\n"Sonar Beep?" Marble glanced toward her colleague.\n\n"Yes, of course. The group seem to be quite heterogenous; hippogriff nationalists, harmonists, communists, you name it. I believe some local libertarians as well. Total strength is around forty to fifty fighters, according to our most conservative estimates. Weaponry is varied, but they shouldn't have any heavy weapons."\n\nFrom the opposite side of the table, Zaladid nodded solemnly. Then he spoke, "I propose a decisive assault. A couple of my Chargers teams should be more than enough to get inside, and the rest of our forces can follow shortly after. If we hit quickly, they won't have the time to form a cohesive defence."\n\n"Agreed," Gevese said. He produced a pencil and proceeded to highlight some spots on the city map, all of them around the target. "From here and here, I can have clear lines of fire for my specialists. If any of them tries so much as peaking their ugly mug outside, they'll get a crater through the head."\n\n"Boxed in like rats, uh?" Zaladid chuckled. "Fitting. I like your way of thinking."\n\n"Yes, but please keep in mind that our is a police action, not a military one," Sonar Beep pointed out quickly. "Our foremost concern should be to subdue them, if possible. I'm sure that precious intel can be extracted once they're in my custody." Then, she grinned. "My colts from the S.W.A.T. will help in the operation and perform clearing actions together with your troops."\n\nThe Colthaginian nodded. "Fine by me." From nearby, Gevese nodded as well, then smiled. "I always wanted to see your department in action anyway. It'll be interesting for sure."\n\n"Very well, enough of the chatter." Marble Pillar announced, glancing to each member of Defence Council in turn. "We have a target and a decided course of action. Now, let's go. We've got a job to do.""
legation.7.a:0 "Hey! We're finally getting on!"

legation.8.t:0 "The Arrival Of The Volunteers"
legation.8.d:0 "Marble Pillar stood still, her face an unreadable mask; the only indication that she was in fact not a stone statue was the occasional movement from her eyes. Aside from that, she was utterly silent as the newly arrived Wingbardian contingent marched down the docks, the griffons coming to a perfectly-executed, synchronized stop before her, weapons by their side.\n\nHer glances were however directed not only to them, but also to the colleague beside her. Unlike Marble, Gevese had his beak split into a wide excited grin as he observed the assembled troops.\n\nOfficially, Marble Pillar was there to prove the 'Chiropterran unwavering commitment to the security and stability of Winggarden'. Unofficially, however, Ocean Spray distrusted anypony that wasn't his own (more or less) and had ordered both her and Sonar Beep to keep an eye close to the incoming volunteers, so to gauge their readiness as allies and, should the worst indeed come to pass, potential enemies. Much to her surprise, Gevese didn't seem to mind of her being there.\n\nA cadre of officers from the contingent approached the two, stopping a few steps short and snapping to attention. Marble Pillar saluted back, and hers was a perfect one, born from years of experience. Gevese mimicked her gesture ... and then, to Pillar's absolute horror, he hugged the leading officer of the group.\n\n"Giovanni! Good to see you and the others here," he exclaimed with evident delight. "It has been a long time, hasn't it?"\n\nThe griffon officer grinned back. "Yessir, it has been. My congratulations on your promotion, by the way. Though many of the guys and gals still miss their old commander."\n\n"Promotion?" Gevese barked a laugh. "Oh, I wish it was that, trust me! Still, Winggarden is not too bad. Better than Abyssinia, that's for sure."\n\nTilting his head toward the mare, he added, "May I present you my colleague, General Marble Pillar of the Chiropterran contingent. I'm confident you'll show her the same courtesy you do to me."\n\n"Of course, sir. Ma'am," Giovanni said, snapping to attention a second time. Still a bit bewildered by the sudden disregard of protocol, Marble Pillar settled herself to a quick, stiff nod as an answer.\n\n"But enough with formalities. I'll leave you and the lads some time to settle in. After that, how about we grab something to drink, and you tell me what you've been up to since Falcor?" His grin widened. "First round on me, of course."\n\nEvery creature present agreed quite enthusiastically on the idea. Of course, every creature aside from a very confused, and mildly infuriated, Marble Pillar."
legation.8.a:0 "Welcome to Winggarden lads!"

legation.9.t:0 "The Flycolts"
legation.9.d:0 ""Why is his bigger?"\n\nWithin the vast hangar, the question echoed much louder than anycreature would have liked. Sonar Beep immediately looked up from her clipboard in shock, a shade of pink on her face. Gevese, who had been conversing with some of the newly arrived pilots but a moment before, stopped dead in his track. He turned around, not quite believing what he had just heard.\n\nMarble Pillar was the first to break the uncomfortable silence, a disapproving frown on her face. "General Zillquat, would you please repeat that?" Somewhere behind, a few from the bomber crew snickered.\n\n"Of course I will," Zillquat replied. He raised an accusing hoof toward his Wingbardian colleague. "Why is his bigger than mine?" The chuckles from the aircrews present got a bit louder.\n\nGevese blinked, slowly. "I ... my apologies. I was just not expecting to hear that from you." The griffon shrugged and let out a soft chuckle. "Admittedly, I do hear such comments once in a while." Some distance away, Sonar Beep let out a soft wheeze, only to get silenced by a stern look from Pillar.\n\nUnfazed, Zillquat beckoned to the twin-engine bomber occupying most of the hangar. "I mean, look at this! I thought we'd all agreed that the Legation Air Force needed light aircrafts. Light, as in 'not too expensive, with a modest profile and easy to maintain', which Colthage could have easily provided at a reasonable price, by the way." He scowled. "And yet what we have here? Something that's twice as big, probably consumes twice as much fuel too, and for what? So that some Wingbardian company can get a contract?"\n\nEventually, he finally realized the look every creature was giving him. "Well, what's the matter? Did I say something wrong? It's true though! He's got a bigger-"\n\n"Zillquat!" Marble Pillar snapped, eyes narrowing to slits. "Shut up. Now." It was too late though, as Sonar Beep had already broken down into an uncontrollable fit of giggles. Meanwhile, if the grin slitting his beak was any indication, Gevese was clearly having way too much fun.\n\nSomewhere behind, one of the Wingbardian bomber pilots took the chance to slip by his Colthaginian colleague -a stallion of course- and quietly deliver the kind of predictable pun one could have seen coming from miles away. Unsurprisingly, he would not find that very amusing."
legation.9.a:0 "Mine is bigger than yours!"

legation.10.t:0 "The Sit Down"
legation.10.d:0 "If the many years as a military griffon -and a diplomat too, even if a bit later- had taught Gappi anything, was that you should always get the measurement of the creatures you're supposed to work with. Preferably as soon as possible. The results so far, however, were mixed.\n\n"Stop treating this like it's your personal backyard!" Ocean Spray hissed from across the table. "We are now in hostile territory, and we must treat it as such! Do you truly think that Aris won't try and take back Winggarden if they get the chance? A fight is coming, and we must be ready!"\n\nFrom the other side of the table, Azizelqart raised an eyebrow, clearly unimpressed. "The memo hasn't reached you yet, Legate? The war is over. What you are proposing right now is the equivalent of reigniting hostilities, and may I remind you that attracting capital is particularly difficult if the city becomes a warzone. We can gain much more through free trade than violence."\n\n"Capital? Trade?" The Chiropterran Legate rose from his seat, fangs bared, his face vivid with fury. "Are you insane?!"\n\n"Alright, gentlecreatures. I think this is quite enough. Constant discussion is clearly bringing us nowhere." Gappi quickly cut in the argument. He took a sip from his cup, savouring it. Equestrian tea was truly something special.\n\n"The problem I see right now," Gappi began, "is that each one of us has a different vision for Winggarden. In doing so however, we have forgotten one common element we all share; for all of us, you see, the Legation is but the steppingstone to something greater back to our respective homes."\n\n"I will not ask you why you're here. Your reasons are your own, but please keep this in mind; the chance that has been granted us is unprecedented. Winggarden is a blank sheet, ready to be filled as we see fit. Now, we can squander this opportunity by constant arguing and backstabbing, or we can collaborate for the time being, so that the wealth gathered here will be the foundation of our respective careers."\n\nGappi lifted his teacup high as if for a toast, grinning to each in turn. "So, what do you believe is the best outcome?""
legation.10.a:0 "Come all! And share in the wealth!"

legation.11.t:0 "Anger And Annoyance"
legation.11.d:0 "No creature knew who had called it into the effect. If they had any suspicion, none of the three Legates said a word, and simply decided to go along as if it was perfectly normal. Except, of course, there was nothing normal about Article 43b. It was supposed to be an extrema ratio to be used, amongst other things, in case of insurrection or foreign meddling inside the Legation. Whatever plan any of the three had, all the careful work and manoeuvre done to gain an advantage over the others, it was thrown into complete jeopardy for the following months.\n\nAfter a brief -and quite heated- evening meeting, each Legate went back to their respective office to deal with new development in a different way.\n\nOcean Spray summoned Marble Pillar, Sonar Beep, and the rest of the Chiropterran officials, and then proceeded to scream at them for fifteen minutes; Azizelqart withdrew to his quarters in silence and buried himself in work until well after midnight; Gappi would attempt to enjoy a fine bottle of expensive red wine, only to barely drink half of it. Said bottle ended up smashed on the wall, thrown into a fit of rage uncharacteristic of the otherwise calm griffon.\n\nNone of them had any illusion on what was to come. If 43b had been called into action, it meant that the gloves were off now. The struggle for the control of Winggarden city would only become fiercer in the coming days. But that was in the future.\n\nFor now they rested, and drew up new plans."
legation.11.a:0 "It will pass."

legation.12.t:0 "The Money Flows"
legation.12.d:0 ""I must admit, Azizelqart, I wasn't expecting you to be so ... bloodthirsty," Gappi noted.\n\nThe Colthaginian Legate looked up from his notes, giving him a sceptical glance. "I would hardly call myself that. I'm simply assuring a bright future for Winggarden, for both ourselves and our benefactors."\n\n"And does that include bashing the Hippogriffs even more than we've already done?"\n\nAzizelqart shrugged. "That is such a hostile way of putting it. We're merely abiding by the Twelve Concessions, precisely as they were written. Besides, I thought you said that the Legation City must be open to business. Well, there you are. Soon, riches will pour into the city coffins. And if the Hippogriffs do disagree, then they're free to write a formal protest."\n\n"For some reason, I'm not so certain they'll limit to that," Gappi pointed out.\n\n"So what if they don't?" The sudden outburst came from Ocean Spray, rising from his seat to loom over the table. "Our security forces have been preparing for this moment. Winggarden's defensive network is now a mighty bulwark, and we'll use it to drown the Hippogriffs in a sea of blood! Let Aris come, for the forces of the Nightmare stand ready!"\n\nAzizelqart shot him a perplexed look at first, but then he nodded, although tentatively. "Ah ...yes, something like that. Though I doubt Aris is in any shape for an armed struggle; so, we can use these fortunate circumstances to apply more leverage and ... Gappi, why are you grinning?"\n\nThe griffon shook his head. "Oh please, don't mind me. Go ahead. I'm just so proud of you two finally agreeing on something." Gappi mimicked wiping away a tear from his eyes. "Quite touching I must say."\n\nA look of horrified realization appeared on both Azizelqart and Ocean's faces. They exchanged a glance to one another, a disgusted one at that."

legation.13.d:0 "Wind Flow placed a hoof over the book held before her by an elderly-looking constable. "I do solemnly swear allegiance to the Legation City of Winggarden, to uphold its laws and maintain order within its boundaries."\n\nThe older hippogriff shrugged. "Good enough. Go into the next room and another officer will issue you your uniform and the initial gear. We'll have a briefing in one hour where you'll get your first assignment. Next!"\n\nWind nodded, stone-faced. She struggled to keep the disgust on her face from showing as she stepped out of the line of soon-to-be constables, just as another hippogriff stepped forward to take the oath, similarly to her.\n\nA newly-ironed uniform was pushed into her arms by a bored-looking bat, together with a belt and a short baton. No firearm though. Her blood boiled once her gaze fell upon the badge standing out on top of the bundle.\n\nWind Flow had never considered herself much of a patriot or a nationalist, and yet joining up the Volunteer Department -effectively helping the occupiers- left a bitter taste in her mouth.\n\nStill, what other choice did she seriously have? Commerce with the rest of Aris had effectively ceased once the Legation City had been established. And as cheaper goods begun to come in, her small shop had quickly gone under. Nearly forty years of family tradition weren't worth much, not anymore at least.\n\nAt least the wage was good though; at least now she didn't have to worry about what to put on the dinner table for her kids."

legation.14.d:0 "Effective law enforcement was built on trust, both between officer and citizen, and between officers. A key part of the latter was faith in your superiors. If you didn't trust them, you still had to carry out their orders, and the best thing an officer could do was to believe, and to trust.\n\nCaptain Galbo reminded himself of this again and again as the furious banging on the walls of his submarine began once more. Twelve years in the Wingbardian navy, several commendations and a chance to serve abroad in Zebrica, and yet this was where he had ended up?\n\n"Deploy the divers," he ordered quietly, and one of his officers moved as fast as she could over the by now padded floors and towards the diving lock, where she silently gave a signal to the six officers who had spent eight hours inside their wetsuits, waiting for this moment. Closing the hatch, they silently filled it with water from the ballast tanks so that it would not be noticed from the outside, and the officers all quietly put the masks over their faces, using the new Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatuses to be able to breathe even as the lock filled with water.\n\nWhen the airlock finally opened, his divers shot out of it as fast as their artificial fins could propel them, out at the seaponies that had clustered around the submarine to vandalize it, as they did every time. Not this time though, with their new gear, his officers would be almost as fast as the seaponies.\n\nOr they would be, if the seaponies had not come prepared with nets, and all his officers had for their rapid deployment was swimming straight into the nets like panicked fishes. With the seaponies descending on them, tearing off their fins and covering them in sea life, all Captain Galbo was left with was four humiliated officers coming back through the diving lock covered in starfishes and clams just as the knocking began again."

legation.15.d:0 "The public opening ceremony was a rather quick and modest affair, and that suited Azizelqart just fine. Operating behind the scenes and away from the public's eye was something he had long since grown accustomed to back in Colthage; that's where the real work was done, after all.\n\nConvincing the other two legates to support the complete renewal of the extensive Winggarden tram system had proven to be considerably easier than expected. Gappi had been enthusiastic about it, of course, and had immediately gone ahead to contact specialized engineers from Wingbardy to put to work on the project. Ocean Spray had, on the other hoof, grumbled for a bit, wondering why all that money wasn't being used to strengthen the city defences, but had eventually come around after some heated discussion. He did however request for a couple of those rail lines to be reserved to military use only. Azizelqart didn't know why he needed them and hardly cared, so long as he had the thestral's approval.\n\nAnd so the project went ahead, with universal support no less. As for Azizelqart, he got exactly what he wanted. Such great work would not only prove an immediate benefit in drawing companies to Winggarden, but also act as a great showcase to the rest of the world. The Legation City was putting the scars of the war behind and finally opening back to business.\n\nOh, and Winggarden's citizens could get a modern, functioning tram system for moving around; that one too."

Therefore, the zebra legate took care to visit the city's docks and greet personally the incoming executives from his homeland. All in all, it was quite the friendly affair; Zahummid smiled, shook a couple of hooves, even cracked a joke or two.\n\nAfter that, he had them escorted to an already booked, five-stars hotel and parked for a couple of days there, so that they could enjoy the city and doing a bit of sightseeing. Or rather, Zahummid made sure to instruct the security detachment to steer his compatriots towards what he wanted them to see.\n\nThey would eat in the best restaurants, go shopping in the fanciest boutiques, and enjoy the kind of night-time entertainment that only a city as Winggarden could offer. Some would call it coaching; Zahummid preferred the term "readying the terrain".\n\nTo the surprise of nopony, the following meeting went exceedingly well; saying that the executives were enthusiastic about his proposition would have been a massive understatement. The Colthaginian consortiums would find a city welcoming them with open hooves. And the Legate would gain a great asset in the form of a considerable chunk of the local industry placed under Colthage's control."

legation.17.d:0 ""Saddle Arabia?"\n"I beg your pardon?" Gappi raised an eyebrow. Gattei didn't answer immediately, instead taking his time to stir the drink in his glass.\n\n"The painting behind your desk. I guessed it from the colours, mostly." Gappi smiled politely, then nodded. "Why, yes. You have quite the eye, I must admit. It is in fact from Saddle Arabia. A little treat I gave myself before the place decided to implode. I wasn't aware you had such knowledge on art history."\n\n"A griffon ought to have a hobby or two," Gattei replied with a shrug. He chuckled. "Believe it or not, I dreamed of being an artist when I was younger. Took a few drawing lessons too back in Karthin. Instead, I found myself becoming "Beakolini's oil guy", as some within the party are fond of calling me." He shook his head.\n\n"I'll try and be honest with you, Legate Gappi," Gattei began, and the other griffon's ears immediately perked up in interest. Up to that point they had been chatting amicably in his office, almost like two old friends, but that was over now. If Gattei was now addressing him by his title, it meant it was finally time to conduct business.\n\n"The AGWP has been finding itself in a bit of a pickle as of late. You see, the official party line is that Abyssinia has been utterly pacified. Unfortunately, this has proven again and again not to be the case. The government won't send more troops there, for it would mean admitting that the Duce was wrong. On the other claw though, investors get understandably more and more agitated when they hear AGWP refineries have gotten repeatedly firebombed by enraged natives." Gappi nodded solemnly, eyebrows furrowed. "That does sound quite bothersome."\n\n"Oh it is, I assure you. Sadly, the Duce seems to care little as long as the oil and gas keeps flowing, which might not be all that long. And when that happens, well, it will be my head on the chopping block."\n\n"I see. Well, what kind of proud patriot would I be if I were to leave a fellow countrygriff without help?"\n\nGattei let out a small chuckle. "Wingbardy is truly lucky to have you here, Legate Gappi. I suppose you already have a few ideas on how to help me that you'd like to discuss." A wide smile made its appearance on Gappi's face. He quickly decided that calling for another bottle of red wine would be appropriate. He felt this was but the beginning of a most beautiful partnership."

And yet there he was, his mouth twitching into something that, after some squinting, could be called a smile. Or something similar, anyway.\n\nThe civil engineer by his side, a zebra mare, was still talking, occasionally pointing and waving her hoof around so to illustrate where the current project would take place. Ocean Spray had stopped listening to her a few minutes ago, thanks in no small part to the ruckus of labouring crews and roar of construction engines. Still, he made the effort to look interested and nod once in a while, but his mind was elsewhere.\n\nGappi and Azizelqart were both fools, he had long since decided. They were so busy running Winggarden like their personal project that they had forgotten the Hippogriff threat still out there. The military towns being built weren't just a petty attempt to seize the best city quarters for his own, but they would act as mighty bulwarks against the incoming tide.\n\nNarrow streets that could function as chokepoints; reinforced concrete walls; flat rooftops sturdy enough to support the weight of heavier weapons. And of course, dedicated shrines for the Nightmare.\n\nThe military towns weren't just a home away from home for the Chiropterrans, but veritable fortresses, a coiled trap ready to spring into action and bleed the invaders, or insurgents, dry.\n\nBesides, they were a fond reminder for Ocean Spray of where he had grown up. The grin on his face grew just a little."

Azizelqart Zahummid, for example, saw it as a pristine white sheet; and while he was more than ready to fill it as he saw fit, that was not a task he could accomplish on his own.\n\nLuckily, Zahummid's work was bearing fruits and, through the right investments, the fame of Winggarden had spread into the right circles, all the way to Griffonia and Equus. Over the course of several weeks, the Legate's cabinet would grow exponentially with new arrivals, something that did not escape his colleagues' notice. Still, none of them did more than raising an eyebrow.\n\nGappi was too busy refining what he still considered "his" project, while Ocean Spray was ... well, he wasn't really sure what the thestral was doing. Still, that was fine by him.\n\nAnd as Zahummid look across from his desk at the young and sharp minds gathered before him, he couldn't help but smile proudly. They were all there because he had invited them. He hadn't coaxed them with money or, at the very least, not just money. No, he was selling much more than that.\n\nHe was proposing to them an environment fully under their control, where their counsel and economic expertise would unshackle Winggarden's full economic potential and propelled it to heights never seen before. All without pesky bureaucracy or boring politics getting in the way.\n\nHe had sold them an idea, and in exchange they would help him making it a reality."

legation.20.d:0 "As the great game continues between the three legates, tension has been building steadily throughout Winggarden. Winggarden has had no shortage of ambitious and dedicated creatures to fill the ranks beneath the legates, yet when the ones meant to be their superiors kept squabbling instead of governing, it wasn't long before people began to whisper. Calling it a conspiracy might be far-fetched, it was more like a series of changes throughout each of their organizations. Officials were no longer personally loyal to the legates, but instead their respective departments, and the big three's bickering became more and more of a hassle that needed to be dealt with. Thus, bit by bit, the great game found itself grinding to a halt, and by the time the legates realized what had happened it was too late.\n\nThere was no insurrection and no drama, just a sudden realization for all of them that their respective offices no longer supported them. And what were they meant to do? Call their respective homelands and say that their subordinates weren't being obedient? At best, they'd get laughed at, at worst they'd cause an international incident as any foreign meddling would lead to the other parties intervening.\n\nThus, only a slow surrender was left for them, and they all handled it differently. Gappi slowly resigned himself to his fate and took a week off work. Ocean Spray barricaded himself in his office and and screamed through the window that they would all pay for this for several hours, until a squad of soldiers kicked the door down and forcibly escorted him home to cool off. In contrast though, Zahummid has not only taken the news well but seemed outright overjoyed, at least if his enthusiastic treating of the office to his personal liquor and cigarres was any indication.\n\nWith the legates either sidelined or persuaded, a new dawn is rising for Winggarden, a Winggarden that has managed to rise to stand on her own four legs!"

When the Chiropterran legate didn't answer, he simply looked to Gilippo, who at least could talk. "You were saying?"\n\n"I... have been in contact with some of the hippogriff business leaders," the Wingbardian sighed, looking as though somecreature had sucked out his soul. "They have reacted well to the proposal, and they're planning to put forth a candidate to serve on the Legation Council."\n\n"Fantastic!" Azizelqart said enthusiastically, taking his mug of tea and sipping from it. "It's Golden Shore, isn't it?" he added as he was done, Gappi nodding.\n\n"It is, so thank Boreas for small blessings, at least."\n\n"What blessing is there even to be had here?!" Ocean Spray suddenly snapped, Azizelqart thinking to himself that the name was really fitting, considering how much the Chiropterran spat when he screamed. "Are you both utterly insane?! Why are we even entertaining this?! We should each be requesting aid from our homelands to crush this whole insurrection! But no, suddenly we are capitulating to the natives?!"\n\n"And I thought a military pony like you would understand the necessity of reform," Azizelqart commented airily. "Our purpose is to make sure money flows from Winggarden. If political liberalization helps in that, then why not?"\n\n"If giving control to the creatures we conquered helps us maintain it?" Ocean Spray asked. "Are you insane! Do you seriously think making a hippogriff a legate will aid in anything?"\n\n"We're not making one a legate, we're making one a president." Azizelqart replied mildly, watching as Ocean Spray seemed to swallow his tongue in disbelief."

Our dilligence and our hard work is the bedrock of Winggarden, and we are building towards a future where every hippogriff will be the queen or king of this city, free and more prosperous than we ever could have imagined! I believe in a united and prosperous Winggarden: will you all continue to build with me?!" he asked, the crowd cheering enthusiastically.\n\nComing off the stage, he smiled widely as he shook claws with the people he just had addressed, listening idly to their concerns and giving them comforting little words. As he spotted the journalists with their cameras, he leaned in to one of the females that had come up to him, poking the little chick she was carrying with her in the stomach.\n\n"Well aren't you the cutest little thing?" he said merrily, "What can such a fine little boy be called, then?"\n\nAs the mother told him the name he made an affirmative noise and made sure the cameras caught him playing with the fuzzy little thing. "A fine name indeed. I hope we'll both be able to continue working for his future as well!" He said, drawing enthusiastic cheers from the hippogriffs around him. Still, he made sure to keep some distance from the fuzzball in case it decided to puke or something."

It had been a stunning victory for him - of course it had - and he waved to the crowds gathered in front of the legates' office - now the presidential residence - to watch his inauguration. With one claw raised, he put his claw on the law book and solemnly swore the presidential oath. He couldn't quite stop smiling, especially not as the sash was placed across his chest, and as he greeted the crowd, the smile was near blinding.\n\n"Today is a new day for Winggarden!" he said loudly, "My fellow Winggardians, how proud can we not all be this day?! Today, we have taken a great step towards making Winggarden, and Winggarden only, the shining city on the hill that we all know that she can be!"\n\nAs he spoke, Azizelqart sat in the background, smiling politely as he envisioned the string-pull on Golden Shore's back. Mentally, he reached out and imagined pulling it, and he had to stop his grin as Golden Shore's topic switched as if on a cue.\n\n"And I tell you all, my fellow Winggardians, that we are not done yet, and that we must continue to fight to ensure that the brave new world that has arisen in this city can remain an inspiration to all! Whatever was, we are Winggardians now, no less and no more, for what more could any creature ask for, than to be part of this great project? I swear to you, my fellow citizens, that I will not let Winggarden be threatened by anyone! Together, we will prevail, we will remain prosperous, and we will remain the envy of the world!"\n\nAzizelqart nodded to himself. Golden Shore really had been a good investment."

The city has elected its own leader and has moved to distance itself from its old. The new "president" of Winggarden, a hippogriff named Golden Shore, has contacted us with an offer of rapprochement.\n\nThe offer would let us access the Winggardian markets and enjoy the wealth that had built up there - something we sorely lack after recent events, yet in doing so we would not only give up our claim on the city, but we would also need to surrender the surrounding state South Aris to it. The area in question would serve as in part a buffer zone, but also to ensure Winggarden, and thus the wealth it would provide us, can continue to grow.\n\nThe city is still under Chiropterran, Wingbardian and Colthaginian control, and our prospects of retaking it by force is slim to say the least. This, at least, would give us something for all the pain, but can we truly give up the city?"

"You will not regret this, I can assure you of that! Hippogriffia is stepping into the future, to become one more claw holding the ladle that stirs the great melting pot!"\n\n"Yes, it will be reassuring for everyone that we are finally normalizing relations," the Ambassador said evenly, seeming more than a little uncomfortable. "We all hope that this will help us build towards a better future..."\n\n"Oh it will, it most certainly will!" Golden Shore exclaimed with a wide, slick smile.

"Also, why are you two pestering me at breakfast of all times?"\n\n"Because you have a nice taste in cafés if nothing else," Azizelqart responded from across the table before taking a bite out of the daisy sandwich. He really hadn't known what to think of this Equestrian-style sandwich at first, but he had decided he liked it. "But as much of a shame as it is, it won't matter too much in the long run. Hippogriffia decided to place national pride before cutting their losses and improving their economy. That is their loss."\n\n"At least Golden Shore made the effort," Gilippo commented, "and the locals will remember that. They really do have good food here though," he admitted to Ocean Spray.

By the time the griffon had begun to understand the true nature of the situation bubbling beneath the surface of normalcy, it was already too late; the bullets had already started flying, and Winggarden, his dream, was burning before his eyes. The only option left for Legate Gappi was to rush to his office, losing half of his bodyguards just to get there, and try to establish contact with whatever loyal elements were in the city.\n\nThankfully, there were many. Even better, General Gevese was fully aware of the situation and ready to act accordingly. What followed was a ten-hour-long bloodbath as Winggarden's streets run red with blood; the Colthaginian quarter was firebombed and then stormed by Wingbardian Arditi assault teams through copious amounts of grenades. The Chiropterrans proved to be a tougher nut to crack, their Legionnaires being some of the best soldiers in the whole world. Still, Gevese had learned much about them and their tactics in the previous weeks, and he was ready to thoroughly destroy their aura of invincibility. Through superior Wingbardian numbers, the Chiropterrans were pushed back into their barracks, which were promptly levelled by artillery.\n\nAs the dust settled, Gilippo Gappi stood as the only surviving legate of Winggarden, left to pick up the pieces of what had been his crowing achievement. Yet, there was no time to rest; both [CTH.GetNameDef] and [BAT.GetNameDef] would be enraged as soon as the reality of the situation became apparent, while [WNG.GetLeader] as well would soon demand an explanation on what had just happened. And, of course, there was [HIP.GetNameDef] to deal with; the Hippogriffs were surely plotting already.\n\nGappi leaned back in his chair as he glanced around at what remained of his office.

With enough time, patience and a plan that was as carefully laid out as it was utterly sociopathic, Winggarden had fallen under the control of the legionnaires and Chiropterra proper.\n\nAlmost immediately the sycophant scientist began to reestablish communications with the outside world; first to homeland and second to the Hippogriffians to make sure that they didn't swoop in or flap gormlessly out of the sea in a vain attempt at restoring their long-lost honour. The Wingbardians and the Colthaginians then heard from Chiropterra that their concession was now under the control of the a thestral and his cronies. Of course both objected, but there was little they could do beyond speculate and gesticulate. After all, neither [CTH.GetNameDef] nor [WNG.GetNameDef] truly wanted a war with the mighty legions, try as they might to regain any semblance of control in the city that was supposed to repay three nations' worth of war debts.\n\nFor the first time in months, Ocean Spray simply sat in his office and watched as the remaining dissidents were rounded up and shot; knowing that the griffons and zebras would only know so much as what he said.

Most of them had connections to Colthaginian consortiums who would benefit greatly from what he had done. Instead of three, Winggarden now had only one master, and it was them.\n\n"Good riddance to those leeches!" Zahummid exclaimed, earning shouts of approval. He was positively giddy. It hasn't been easy, but by using all of his cleverness, and by pulling countless strings behind the scenes, he had managed to sideline the other Legates before engineering the dissolution of the Legation Council itself, leaving him alone in complete control.\n\nNaturally Chiropterra and Wingbardy were furious, but there was nothing they could do when presented with the fait accompli. After all, he had maintained close contact with [CTH.GetLeader] throughout all of his machinations, and he had the full support of Colthage. In such circumstances, the other two nations simply weren't going to risk making a move that might provoke war.\n\nZahummid's eyes gleamed with unbound avarice. Now that those fools no longer stood in the way, he wouldn't have to worry about pesky politics anymore. Winggarden was now his playground: a place where his new vision of society could be tested and perfected.

It's not clear exactly what is going on at the moment, but reports from citizens tell of a city in chaos, and of a fierce power struggle for control.

However, thanks to unexpected developments, that balance has been broken, and the future of Winggarden changed irrevocably.\n\nTensions between our three nations have been rising within the city for weeks, increasing proportionally with Wingbardian influence, until finally they boiled over. Our volunteers engaged in fierce fighting in the streets of Winggarden with Colthaginian and Chiropterran forces yesterday. Thanks to our griffon on the scene, General Gevese, Wingbardian forces emerged victorious in these skirmishes, leaving Gappi the only Legate still in the city: Winggarden is now under full Wingbardian control.\n\nHow long this state of affairs will last, though, is unclear. The collapse of the Legation has left the city in chaos, and it is doubtful that the denizens of the city will be very happy with a Wingbardian ruling over them directly. Fortunately, Gappi has a plan to salvage things. He intends to elevate an ideologically committed hippogriff to take the reins as a figurehead and win the locals over. With any luck, Winggarden will be stabilised and brought fully into the Wingbardian sphere of influence."

Here he was, running an entire statelet all by himself; having managed to perfectly execute a brutal takeover through various nefarious means.\n\nWhen the top brass read the reports of his success, most of them were as disgusted as they were impressed by his brutal efficiency. Taking over Winggarden had required a considerable amount of many things that he had slowly imported, by the sheer quantity of dangerous chemicals that Ocean Spray had used in his takeover was indication enough that he had well and truly dealt with any potential opposition.\n\nUnfortunately that means [Root.GetNameDef] will have to cover for his heinous crimes, but many are praising his takeover without the knowledge of the details. After all, he has expanded the realm of the Nightmare through his endeavours. Besides, it's not as though the administration can't make use of this sudden turn of events."

Fortunately for us, recent developments have upended the balance of power within the concession, altering things drastically in our favour.\n\nOur Legate in Winggarden—Azizelqart Zahummid—managed to orchestrate a complete takeover, sidelining the other Legates before dissolving the Legation Council itself. Naturally Chiropterra and Wingbardy are furious, but we are offering Zahummid our full support and protection. [Root.GetLeader] is ecstatic, as Winggarden has fallen into our lap. The city is no longer under joint control, and is now essentially a colony of Colthage.\n\nAzizelqart is a zebra with grand plans. He has long dreamed of a place to put his economic theories into practice: what he calls the Colthago Nuovo Project. Now in control of Winggarden, he intends to transform the city into a bastion of free market economics and unshackle its full potential, propelling it to new heights of prosperity.

We are still taking stock of the damage," Gappi said, his eyes never leaving the hippogriff as he stepped inside the legate's office. Zephyr Silversliver did not wait for Gappi's permission before taking a seat; a small slight that Gappi decided to ignore for the time being. He needed the hippogriff after all. "I think a drink is in order, yes? Would you like some coffee? A tea, perhaps."\n\n"Nothing of the sort," Silversliver cut in brusquely. "The wheels of history are moving right now, and only those ready to seize the moment can put themselves at the helm of the coming change." Gappi raised an eyebrow, momentarily confused. The hippogriff went on undisturbed. "And now that the Colthaginians and the Chiropterrans are finally gone, together with their decadent influence, we can finally start building a new and pure fascist society. We won't let any other creature chain us through backward religion or slavery. Now it's the time to seize our destiny!" he proclaimed, eyes shining with elation behind his glasses.\n\nIn the meantime, Gappi nodded, slowly. He was regretting choosing him already, but it wasn't as if there were many other figures charismatic and malleable enough for the role. The Legate would have to just swallow the poisoned pill for the time being. "Yes, of course," he said. "I couldn't have put it better myself. A new management is precisely what Winggarden needs. Sadly, as you have probably noticed yourself, there are many hippogriffs that would oppose such vision." Then, he added. "Some would even prefer to re-join Hippogriffia."\n\n"Fools!" Silversliver snarled, slamming his fist on the desk. "We have the greatest chance in our claws, the possibility to chart a path toward the future, yet they would prefer to return to the rotting traditions that led to our ruin! We cannot allow this infection to fester any further!"\n\nGappi nodded, careful to conceal the growing smile on his beak. This was proving to be easier that he had initially thought. The Legate only half-listened to him from that point on. By the end of the day, Winggarden would have its Commandant." #AAAAAAH

For the time being, most seems to be content watching from the side-lines and see what happens next. Many are still hoping for a quick military intervention from Hippogriffia, so to finally put an end to the humiliation that was the Legation City.\n\nAs our current forces within the city are not enough to frustrate a serious intervention should that happen, we must know rely on other means to maintain control, which in this case means to rely on the newly-appointed Commandant and his local Blackwings. Silversliver has offered to employ his newspaper, "The Action", as an instrument to spread our influence and truth across the city, especially if we make sure his newspaper is the only one available. Still, our funds are limited at the moment; we must therefore decide if to divert our resources and efforts to stabilize the situation within the city through a normalization campaign of the new institutional order, or to build up a base of support and enlarge the ranks of the local fascist chapter.\n\nWhatever the choice, we must act quickly before the hippogriffs take the chance to move against Winggarden." #AAAAAAH

All of the hippogriffs present stood at attention with pride, their uniforms cleaned and shining, their meagre weaponry by their side. The sight might have not been all that intimidating, but those very militants had hardened their bones during the city's takeover. They had earned their place through sweat and blood, many of them considered by now veterans within the organization.\n\nIt was for that very reason, Fresh Wave imagined, that they were being graced with Commandant Zephyr Silversliver's own presence. The hippogriff paced up and down the line, a couple of assistants trailing behind, as he glanced at each in turn. "Does any of you know," the Commandant began quietly, "why we lost?" None spoke.\n\n"No? Not even a try?" Silversliver chuckled, before finally coming to a stop in front of a surprised Fresh Wave. He lowered his sunglasses, his eyes boring into him. "How about you? Do you know why we lost?"\n\nFresh Wave hesitated for a moment, then barked out, "Sir! We lost because we were too weak. Because the chain of traditions had forced us into bondage, serving a corrupt monarchy with rotting and weak ideals! Defeat was but the consequence of our weakness, sir!" His worry eased as he saw the Commandant nodding enthusiastically.\n\n"Yes, exactly!" He then turned to the gathered hippogriffs and addressed them as well. "But those times end today and here! For those gathered before me shall be the irresistible vanguard of the fascist revolution, the torchbearers of valour, honour, and strength, carriers of the flame through the entirety of Hippogriffia! From this day on, you are no longer common citizens of Winggarden, no. You are Blackwings!" The answer came as a deafening roar from a hundred throats, Fresh Wave's included." #AAAAAAH

And yet, as he watched the crowd gathered in Wingsington Square, a veritable sea of black-cladded hippogriffs waving flags, chanting songs, and rising their right arms in salute, Gappi had to admit that he was feeling a little uneasy. The idea had appeared sensible on paper, yet as he saw the results...\n\nHe shook his head. There was no going back now. He had promised himself to salvage his project, his legacy, no matter the cost, and this would be the small price to pay, hopefully. Gappi paid only little attention as Zephyr Silversliver, the Commandant, climbed to the stage amidst a cacophony of applause, and ignored most of his speech. All of that was but sham. The crowd; the waving flags; the camera crews; the speech itself; it had all been staged from the beginning to impress the spectators and the rest of the city, to make it look like a genuine grassroot movement.\n\nGappi ignored what Zephyr was now saying, all that stuff about national rejuvenation and what not, about regaining new strength after the failures of the past. He had an entire team preparing the speech, and he had heard them trying it enough times that he knew the gist of it. Still, he was troubled. Zephyr knew how to work a crowd into a frenzy, even if he was no Beakolini. That kind of griff could get... specific ideas on who he wanted around and in his inner circle. And as he heard the raging crowd shouting Zephyr's name, Gappi could only hope that his choice had not simply delayed the death of the Legation." #AAAAAAH

Branding of that kind was always good for business. As such, receiving an invitation for an economic forum at Winggarden of all places was not something he had expected. The city belonged to Hippogriffia no longer, and rumours would surely spread if he were to attend. Still, despite the burning defeat, the war had allowed his company to make a killing producing clothing for the army and, with the coming civil strife, maybe a change of scenery was in order.\n\nThe forum itself was a rather modest affair, yet to the point. Gappi, the only remaining Legate of the Legation City, took the stage immediately and held it for a couple of hours. And High Tide had to admit, the griffon knew how to speak to a crowd. With Wingbardy in full control of the Legation, he explained, a few changes were going to occur, mostly regarding public safety.\n\nHe also explained that the ultimate goal was the creation and full implementation of a corporativist system, transforming radically Winggarden's economy in a form much similar to the Wingbardian model. High Tide had little idea about what that meant, but he did like the idea of not having to deal with unions any longer, even if he would probably need to throw a bone to his workers. And even if all those Blackwings moving around the place had a certain brutish appearance to them, he guessed it was but a small sacrifice to assure the safety of his property. And he had a lot of property that needed to be protected.\n\nBy the end of the day, as he enjoyed his stay in one of Winggarden's hotel, High Tide decided with some excitement that this new venture was going to prove very profitable." #AAAAAAH

You do have a fine taste, if I may be so bold."\n\n"You are too kind, Ambassador, but I'm afraid you may have misinterpreted my request," Gappi said, taking a sip from his own glass. "See, Beakolini's attention directed elsewhere is actually for the better. What he have here, is a strong market ready to be tapped by Wingbardian corporations. The only thing I just need right now though, is but a little incentive for these companies to consider investing here. And if they decide to do so, they'll have a direct incentive in Winggarden continuous stability." The ambassador nodded slowly, a sly grin on his beak. \n\n"Oh, I see. Yes, that would be a nice boost to your project, Legate, and a far more practical goal as well. I'm sure that any contribution to such project, such as having a few words with a few friends back in Karthin, would be... well recompensed, yes?" Gappi grinned. He knew he had it now. "But of course, it is only natural. There happen to be a few profitable high-rises in need of a new owner. I'm sure than advantageous price can be arranged. Hypothetically of course."\n\n"Of course.

Apparently, there were a lot.\n\nThe griffon gave the mass of papers a fleeting glance, a frown forming on his face. He was no newbie on that line of work; he had hardened his bones working for the Wingbardian SIM, uprooting communist underground networks. Unfortunately, the situation was pretty different from back home. They could usually count on ample resources and personnel, and right now he had neither of those.\n\nIn fact, the only thing he had was a long list of targets, and a direct request from the Legate to pacify Winggarden in whatever way possible and through any means. Easier said than done, but Gavello didn't have the time to complain, and he had a job to do. He opened one of the dossiers, flipped a couple of pages, and his settled on one target in particular.

Yet, it wasn't like he had much in the ways of options right now, his resources being still rather limited. A new way to handle the unrest however had to be found. "What about Zephyr's Blackwings? We can use them for pacification."\n\n"You're still planning on shooting the protesters? How's that supposed to fix the situation?" In response, Gappi shook his head. "Not like that! I was planning on making them do some good public relations on our behalf. If the citizens see them actually helping them, like through food distribution or something similar, then that should calm them down a bit. Furthermore, we can pull a few strings and make sure that only Blackwings members get priority for job assignments."\n\nGevese nodded. "That would increase their numbers, yes. I see your point.

"We have never discussed about 'following our own road towards fascism' or whatever that was. Do you know how such speeches could be interpreted back in Wingbardy?"\n\nZephyr scoffed. "And why should we care about what they think? Winggarden is ready to stand on his own without Hippogriffia interference. And Wingbardy has bigger worries at the moment." It was then that Gappi's eyes narrowed to slits, the griffon fuming. "Careful there, Zephyr. That was not our agreement. And I'm still calling the shots here; it is still my project."\n\n"Is it?" Zephyr grinned before breaking out in a fit of chuckles. "You sure about that? It seems to me that my organization is currently in control of much of Winggarden. My Blackshirts patrol the streets after all, and the corporations turn to us to keep their workforce in line."\n\nGappi opened his beak to answer but nothing came out. His eyes narrowed on the snake dressing as a hippogriff before him. "I believe we're done here," Zephyr said as he made his way for the door. "Enjoy your project, Legate Gappi.

In fact, by a count of the bodies floating in the sea, they made up approximately eighty percent of the corpses that were being disposed of. Not that it mattered of course, there was no escaping his reign over Winggarden and the continued support from the mainland was proving to be more than enough to keep their enemies at bay.\n\nHe scribbled one last approval on a request from his generals and stood up, walking over to his highrise window in order to take in the vista.\n\nJust outside of the hotel he had selected as his headquarters, a new division was being prepared to root out another resistance stronghold.

Needless to say that with the sharp decline of competent commanders, the precision involved in the stings was hardly necessary any more.\n\nProjections stipulated that another month or so of similar strikes would utterly wipe out any chance of unified resistance forming.

Many came down to greet their fellow chiropterrans using appropriate ranks, being cordial and so on; but there was an emptiness behind their eyes. Their uniforms were as much dirt as it they fabric and almost all of them had a gas mask haphazardly strung around their necks which had clearly seen heavy use. They were the veterans of whatever it was that Ocean Spray was putting them through, and it was miracle that they'd managed to survive this long without reinforcements.\n\nIt wasn't long before the expeditionaries were copying the methods of the division that had first been here, making the most of their equipment and keeping everything necessary on hoof.

Massive stacks of food had been sent, with every other box containing weapons or other much needed equipment; and that was without mentioning the 'FRAGILE' boxes. Those were the really fun ones that were just for Ocean Spray and his schemes, which meant that they were likely as problematic as they were capable of problem solving.\n\nWhen the legionnaires saw that they were chock full of Venomous Agent X nerve gas, their theories were proven to be entirely correct.

After all, Ocean Spray hardly needed to worry about the competence of his own troops and needed to worry even less about decapitating the various resistance groups with how things had been going.\n\nAll the same, his generals had asked him to pick one; much to his dismay. Something about efficiency and risk negation.\n\nThe thestral sighed and pulled his desk chair over to the window for the second time that day so that he could watch the well-oiled machine of the forward operating base work its magic in what had once been a city green below.\n\nThough he hadn't actually taken the time to inspect the documents properly, he knew there was an option for each piece of paper.

How do you plead?" The thestral - tasked with judging without even knowing the names of those that were being judged - demanded of the defendant.\n\nThe hippogriff was barely able to look up as he spoke, "N-not... Guilty..."\n\nHe rolled his eyes at that, "As you can provide no evidence to the contrary of these charges and have otherwise been testified against by," Hard Gavel leaned over to inspect the documents in front of him for a moment, "Three different camp guards and one of your peers, I have no choice but to find you guilty and sentence you to death."\n\nAs the guards sauntered over to drag the creature away and out of the back of the courtroom, the thestral sighed; annoyed for having to check the papers.\n\n"Next!""

This wasn't a night of raiding, nor was it a night of summary executions; at least not in the typical quantities. No, this was a night of slaughter - as all dissidents and heretics deserved.\n\nUnlike those in the internment camps however, these were the most barbarous of hippogriffs; those who could not be permitted to live even through a lifetime of labour and repentance.\n\nEven Ocean Spray lay awake in his bed that night, having given the order to finish the job once and for all. He could hear it all from his hotel room: the pleas, the gunfire cutting them off and howls of pain that followed. He could hear sub machine guns run dry as his legionnaires dumped entire magazines into their hapless enemies. When he got up for a drink he could see the incredible number of bodies floating in the sea steadily grow, every other hour.\n\nIf there was one thing that the thestral was envious of, it was their eternal sleep. After all, it wasn't as though he would be getting any with all this constant noise; acclimatised to gunfire or otherwise. Most would have described it as trauma inducing and the legionnaires would have described it chilling at the very least, but Ocean Spray merely considered it a necessity."

Even the consistently billowing smoke from buildings that had been torched was no longer rising from fire, only from the ashes that had once sustained a blaze.\n\nOcean Spray had managed to put an end to the chaos in its entirety. There was no more resistance to shoot back at, just more prisoners to move into the internment districts.\n\nJust in front of the hotel he was staying in, the legionnaires had organised a small parade. Most were too exhausted to participate, but new arrivals and some of the more hardy soldiers made a point of celebrating their victory. After all, this was just the beginning of a new era for Chiropterra and for Hippogriffia; the former for further prosperity and the latter for imminent submission. There was no greater honour than to serve the homeland in such glorious and promising times as these.\n\nAnd yet, for all his success thus far, Ocean Spray simply sat on his bed and rested. His work was far from over and - though he was no warrior - the thestral needed time to rest. He had spent hours upon hours every single day in an attempt to plug the holes in what could have been a sinking ship, just so that a seemingly efficient plan could be fully realised.\n\nThere was still more to be done.

The group might have looked intimidating, if not for the business attire and nervous expressions they wore. They were all civil servants summoned to hear a mandatory address from their boss: Azizelqart Zahummid. A cloud of fear hung over the assembled creatures. Despite Zahummid's ascendancy, they were all still besieged by hostile locals, only now there weren't any Chiropterran Legionaries around to keep them safe.\n\nZahummid cleared his throat. "State employees—humble, diligent zebras, hear my words. You all are the beating heart of Winggarden, you all keep the machine running. Without you, there is no government. Without you, there is no order, only chaos!" He raised a hoof. "And order is what we are fighting to preserve, in the face of the ignorant and ungrateful masses who are too blind to see that our actions are in their long-term interest."\n\nLooking at the faces of his audience, Zahummid saw a sea of blank stares. He gulped. "I implore you, in these uncertain days, do not give in to despair. Be fearless! Simply do your jobs, work hard, and we will achieve our dreams; never underestimate the power of good administration!" A few zebras cheered out of pity more than anything, but most of them looked decidedly uninspired.\n\nBeads of sweat began to drip down his face, but he tugged on the collar of his shirt and ploughed ahead. "If you ever have any doubts, just remember what we are working towards: a new society, more profitable than any seen before in this world. This wondrous future is attainable only if you give it your all. Do your jobs, and do your part to help this city. Choose peace and prosperity over anarchy and decay!" His voice cracked. "You are Winggarden's only hope!"\n\nZahummid held his breath in the aftermath of his imploration, but was disappointed instantly. The crowd was silent, except for a few half-hearted whistles and hoofstomps, mostly from senior managers. When it was clear that his speech was over, the employees all rushed to get back inside the building and out of the sun."

Ever since the departure of all Chiropterrans and Wingbardians from the Legation Volunteer Force, his government's ability to maintain order had been left in shambles. The situation was so desperate that he was forced to resort to recruiting local Winggardeners to supplement the police.\n\nThe auxiliaries were shabby and wore mismatched uniforms leftover from the war, but at least it was a start. Zahummid felt something like hope swelling up inside him. He walked up to one of the recruits who looked particularly promising and shook his claw. "Winggarden thanks you. Tell me, are you prepared to serve your city?"\n\n"Yes, sir, but I had a question," The hippogriff replied sheepishly. "When do we get paid?"\n\nThe feeling of hope subsided, and Zahummid sighed."

They all had deep pockets and connections with him going back years, and they all owed him.\n\nIt was humiliating to have to beg them for funds, but the Colthaginian government was playing it slow, withholding resources while they waited to see how the situation panned out. That was why he had been forced to look elsewhere for support. "Short sighted buffoons," he groused.\n\nIt was not an easy demand and it had required all his charm. After all, it was difficult to sell his vision for Winggarden when there was no hiding the precarious state of the city. It was complete chaos, and he could not prevent it from collapsing without help from the outside.\n\nZahummid got some help, but it just wasn't enough. The funds that came in amounted to barely enough to scrape by. Worst of all, this was all he would be getting from them for the foreseeable future.

"This is a surprisingly reasonable agreement." She smiled politely, extending a claw.\n\nZahummid laughed heartily. "What can I say? I am a reasonable zebra." He adjusted his glasses before shaking her claw. It was a successful outcome by any measure. However, for him it was only a temporary reprieve—he was already dreading the next time she might decide to visit Winggarden.\n\nIn truth, he had given in to most of [HIP.GetNameDef]'s demands, as he was fearful of the consequences of pushing back too much. He made the only deal he could realistically make, given the circumstances. He just had to keep the Hippogriffs off his back for long enough to stabilise the city.

He was racking his brain trying to find a solution to his predicament, but it was impossible. "Even Baltazar Zakbar himself couldn't salvage this mess," he muttered. To stabilise Winggarden, he needed money, but he couldn't raise money until Winggarden was stable! The situation was becoming desperate. No, it was already desperate.\n\nAnd there was no way out. It was so frustrating that Zahummid wanted to shout, but surrender was not an option. He couldn't give up, not when he was so close to his lifelong dream; so close to Colthago Nuovo. He steeled himself. If all that could save him was the impossible, then he needed to make the impossible happen. "Yeah... if I just use some creative techniques," he reasoned out loud, "I can make the funds appear instantly."\n\nIt was a novel solution, definitely not standard accounting practice, and he knew the bill would come due sometime down the road, but it was his only real option. The city was in crisis right now, and that was a problem for the future! Besides, it was all for the greater good. Zahummid adjusted his glasses before grabbing a pen.

When all hope seemed lost, a saviour had appeared offering him a helping hoof. Winggarden would not fall—salvation had arrived in the form of a loan from Bean Security.\n\nThis would provide the injection of cash he so desperately needed. Things were finally looking up. "Coffee Bean, I could kiss you!" he erupted with glee. Just thinking of all the things he could do with those funds made his head spin. It was a new lease on life; he would have to write back immediately to express his gratitude.\n\nThe only thing that made him pause was thinking of how he was going to pay it back.

We're all adults here: you have concerns, and I have a way to address them." He punctuated his words by placing a black briefcase on the table, before opening it up to reveal that it was stuffed full of bits.\n\n"Cold hard cash," he said, stating the obvious. A wise zebra had once told him that self-interest is a more powerful motivator than any lofty ideal. "You could each go home with a case of your own. All I ask in exchange is that you stop stirring up the rabble and putting seditious thoughts in their heads. Sound like a fair deal?"

The vessel carried Coffee Bean himself, who was first to disembark, escorted by a pair of heavily-armed mercenaries. If there was any question, the "BEAN SECURITY" printed on their armour made it clear who they answered to.\n\nZahummid rushed forward to greet him but was interrupted immediately. "There's my number one zebra!" Coffee Bean exploded, taking his hoof and giving him a strong hoofshake. He wore an impossibly wide grin, and Zahummid's first impression of him was of a pony positively overflowing with energy. Less a pony, and more a force of nature. This fool could prove very useful indeed, he thought to himself.\n\n"Mr. Bean, allow me to explain our situation: the departure of all Wingbardian and Chiropterran volunteers has left us... short-hooved to say the least." Zahummid gave Coffee Bean an honest assessment. "At the moment, the only forces we have to call on are auxiliaries of questionable loyalty and a few small police units."\n\n"Sounds like the place has really gone to Tartarus in a hoofbasket," Coffee Bean laughed, bringing a lit cigarette to his mouth while his mercenaries unloaded crates filled with equipment. After taking a long drag, he blew smoke into the zebra's face.\n\n"You could say that." Zahummid winced. "However, your troops will be vital in restoring order. The Municipal Council is glad to have your support in this endeavour." He recovered his polite demeanour and tried once again to ingratiate himself with this new arrival.\n\n"Don't you worry, my fine striped friend!"

Judging by the sounds of the ocean, they must have taken him near the harbour.\n\nJust then, his abductors tore off the hood, revealing a single stallion standing in front of a dilapidated ferry. "Mr. Bean?" He wheezed in disbelief. Coffee Bean grinned like he was greeting an old friend, but there was a sinister gleam in the pony's eyes. "Look, if this is about money, I-I can arrange an alternative method of compensation!" Zahummid desperately pleaded.\n\n"No need, it's already been arranged." Coffee Bean stomped his hoof on the ground. "You see, this is a nice city, but it's a real shame what you've done to it." His face contorted into a look of pure disgust. "I actually think it's better off in my hooves than yours."\n\nThe terrified and overwhelmed Zahummid sputtered. He wanted to object, but he was unable to form a single word, let alone a coherent sentence.\n\n"Yeah, you're not really in a position to argue, huh?" Coffee Bean smirked, leaning in close to the zebra. "Listen, I got a fantastic deal for you: you get on that boat, and I'll let you go with all your parts still attached." By this point, Zahummid was in a state of delirium. "How does that sound?"\n\nWordlessly, Zahummid slowly nodded before stumbling onto the boat that would take him back to Colthage."

Winggarden has tumbled out of our hooves.\n\nSince returning home to [Root.Capital.GetName] in disgrace, Azizelqart Zahummid has struggled to explain what exactly happened. As best we can tell, the main cause of this disaster seems to have been his incompetence. In the chaos following the collapse of the Legation, he chose to bring in Bean Security mercenaries to maintain order. However, these mercenaries proved to be less trustworthy than he had anticipated, and it did not take long for their leader — Coffee Bean — to betray him and take over the city.\n\nWith a well-armed and well-trained force of mercenaries behind him, this eccentric pony is now in total control of Winggarden.

His words dripped with decades worth of resentment.\n\n"In the end, my father and I were barely able to escape with our lives." Driving Iron's hoof clenched.

However I can no longer stand seeing the parasites benefit undeservedly from ponies like me."\n\n"Damn, that's rough." Coffee Bean tried to sound sympathetic. In truth, he was having a hard time paying attention—he was crashing hard. I knew I should have planned this day out better, he thought.\n\n"Mr. Bean, I am intrigued by your invitation. Winggarden truly sounds like a place where I can get away from the parasites: it could very well grow into a paradise of freedom and prosperity!"

Blood never interested him, it could get in his fur, and that was a messy cleanup. It was the worst bodily fluid to try and bleach out.\n\n"Ah ah yes, Mr. Bean, Soothing Song simply had a bit of a run-in with a paid head collector on my way here." Coffee Bean groaned; he remembered how much the kirin's self-referential speech annoyed him. Then, something set in. "Wait, paid head collector... bounty hunters are looking for you? And you came to my safehouse?!" Coffee Bean grunted loudly and began shutting all the windows in the house, why did this need to happen to him? He specifically went to this meeting unarmed to try to court the kirin, and now he brought a serious threat of danger. Soothing Song spoke calmly, "No no Mr. Bean! Soothing Song dispatched them both already. It only took a pistol and some Plasmid powers."\n\nCoffee Bean settled down at this, and took his seat at the table in the center of the room, inviting Soothing Song to do the same. "Alright, alright that's good doctor. So you're still working on those plas-mid things? I remember that paper you showed me all those years ago, clever idea to use poison joke in that way." Soothing Song sat and nodded, "Yes Mr. Bean. But work has been slow for Soothing Song. The governments of the world are afraid of this research, what it could do to their societies. They ban Soothing Song from getting research money, and expel me. Thought Kiria would be better, Soothing Song was excited when the silence was lifted, thought research would be freed. Turned out to be more of the same."\n\nCoffee Bean nodded, "So, about these Plasmids. I'll give you all the cash you could ever need, but I'd like a demonstration if possible.

Shellstacker, on the other hoof, obviously still had some serious doubts.\n\n"Now right off the bat, I want to let you know I don't want to get in the way of hard working innovators like you making money. In fact, I want to help you!" He decided to start by appealing to Golden Shore. "If you decide to work with me, I can promise that our partnership will be very lucrative for you." Golden Shore's eyes lit up with possibilities as a grin appeared on his face.\n\nOne down, Coffee Bean thought.\n\n"Hold on, promises of wealth aren't enough to win me over," Shellstacker interrupted. "My primary concern is the well being of all Winggardeners, which I question your commitment to." She held up a claw. "If you convince me of that, then I'll work with you."\n\n"Come on, you don't seriously think I want to oppress the citizens of this city, do you?" Coffee Bean asked. "The bad old days of the Legation are long gone and I've already restored all political rights to hippogriffs, what more do you want?" He gave an exasperated sigh. "In fact, right now Winggardeners have more rights than those who live in [HIP.GetNameDef]! I want the same things the two of you want: freedom and prosperity for all. So come on, enrich yourselves!"

The security forces met him at the exit, and escorted him to a hurriedly makeshift podium to make the proclamation he'd drawn up on a napkin just moments prior. \n"Good citizens." He began, peering between the haze to try and read the smudged doodles on the now damp piece of paper. "The war's over. My guys tell me that we've got complete control over every major thoroughfare and like, yeah. It's all good." Staring over at the assembled crowd, he took a moment. This was one of those grand moments, something that would go down in history. He had to make a point. Besides, a groundbreaking speech would surely boost stock values, on top of today's breakthrough.\n"Today, we've shown that the market decides who wants what, and what it wants right now is to be free, as we all do. Freedom for all, equality for all and at market dictated price. Is there anything more pure, more wholesome in the world? I don't think so, mares and colts, I don't think so." Yeah, his 'pick-me-up' was starting to hit. "So with this stunning display, I bring you a declaration. Today, right here, right now, I hereby declare this land to be Libertalia, the freest place in the whole world. The place where anyone can get anything, where I guarantee you there'll be no meddling or state interference. We've shown here and now just what the determined can do, and we've got more to come.

Silversliver scoffed. One had to look no further than Stalliongrad, or Brodfield for that matter, to see the cities ruined by famine and war. By looking at history through mere materialistic lenses, the reds had forgotten that only the strength within one's sprit could allow them to achieve unprecedented results.\n\nSilversliver had no intention of implementing a middle way, for the simple fact that there could no be any middle way between the two.

It was a lovely place, filled with trees, sprinkling fountains and blossoming flowerbeds amidst a small river; it had quickly become the students' favourite gathering spot.

It felt like yesterday he had been manning a barricade near the Colthaginian quarter, fighting for hours in the streets with nothing but some old bold-action rifles and improvised grenades, halting a Colthaginian column until Wingbardian regulars had come to relieve him and his comrades. Fighting had been hard, many friends had been killed, yet Fresh Wave felt proud of those moments. It was then he had realized to be a warrior, a proper Blackwing.\n\nNow, he wasn't just a warrior, but a leader as well. He was amongst those hippogriffs chosen by the organization's higher-ups to train the new wave of volunteers into a proper military force, or something close to it anyway. Fresh Wave's thoughts on the matter were ambivalent; on one claw, it meant that he was now considered a veteran within the ranks, and that idea filled him with delightful pride; on the other claw though, those in front of him had failed so far to impress him. They were weak, soft, too accustomed to comforts. He frowned; just like he had been.\n\nLuckily, that would end today. "Atten-tion!" Fresh Wave snapped. "Listen well, you bloody sea-weed eaters! You think you know what it takes to be an actual Blackwing?" His beak twisted into a vicious smile as none replied. "Well, we will see. I'm Sergeant Fresh Wave, and the next eight weeks are gonna be the worst of your entire life!"" #AAAAAAH

Leaning back in his chair, he pulled out a box of cigarettes and lighted one for himself, before offering them to his guests. They both declined. "Before we begin, however, tell me something. I was under the impression that Winggarden's elite wanted nothing to do with the NUHF, that they considered us only useful brutes. Why are you here then?"\n\nGuff Roughtalon shrugged. "Some are smarter than the rest. The truth is, Commandant, sir, that times are changing, but those fools simply refuse to change with them. They would rather maintain the same system that led us to defeat in the first place!" He hissed in frustration, then shook his head. "You have promised not to just carry Hippogriffia back to a victorious past, but towards a bright future. If that's the case, then we formally ask you for a place in your ranks." By his side, his colleague Tempest Galefringe nodded in affirmation, before adding, "If you would accept us, of course."\n\nZephyr grinned broadly, smothering his cigarette in a nearby ashtray before rising from his chair. "There is always a place for those with skills within our ranks. And it so happens that we are in dire need of good commanding officers for our new army. After all, our march to liberate Hippogriffia cannot be carried by words alone. So, given the task I'm setting before you, gentlegriff, do you still accept?"\n\nThe two former hippogriff officers exchanged a brief glance between themselves before finally nodding together. "You will not regret it, Commandant," Roughtalon stated." #AAAAAAH

legation.99.t:0 "The Fascist Triumph"
legation.99.d:0 "There was one simple truth known to all those well-acquitted with fascist theory: blood alone moved the wheels of history. And, as he walked down the corridors of the old royal palace within Mount Aris, Zephyr Silversliver couldn't help but think on how much truth was hidden behind those words.\n\nHe grinned as he passed by the portraits of the kings and queens of old. Theirs had been a triumphant march from the very beginning, their enemy offering only a token resistance. It was obvious in hindsight; their government had failed them once already, so why would they want to die for them? They lacked conviction, they had no spirit, and his fascist vanguard cut through their ranks like a hot knife through butter. The storming of the palace itself had been harsher than expected, but that was the blood price to pay for the final liberation of Hippogriffia from its past decadence.\n\nNow though, as he walked down the ruined and abandoned halls and finally set his eyes on the visage of the old order, Zephyr could only feel scorn. How could Hippogriffia break the chains of from the past when it was celebrated and revered at any opportunity? Truly, the defeat in the North Zebrica War had been a national catastrophe, but a necessary one. It now allowed Zephyr to restore the Equino-Avianic spirit, to reforge Hippogriffia anew.\n\nScowling, he glanced at those pompous portraits one last time, now with a newly-found grin. Once the pyre was ready, they would burn nicely together with all the symbols of the old order. And from very ashes, like a phoenix, Hippogriffia would soar on fascist wings." #AAAAAAH

There were a few sceptical glances thrown his way, but he mostly ignored those.\n\n"I wasn't aware a fancy dress was all it took to buy your loyalty," Stratus Skyranger commented dryly from his side of the table, eyes narrowing. Sky Beak simply scoffed in response, before adding, "Perhaps it is. Though, one can't help but wonder what your own price was. You are sitting at this table as well, after all, aren't you?"\n\nStratus glared daggers. "There wasn't any. They offered me a place here and I accepted it. I wasn't going to entrust command of my own troops to any of those lunatics anyway." There was of course a little more than that, but Stratus was not going to divulge his reasons, especially not there. His eyes narrowed to none in particular. Two catastrophic defeats in a few short years; the army of Hippogriffia had been humiliated twice and the signs were clear; thorough reforms were desperately needed.\n\n"Whatever the reason may be," his colleague Tempest Galefringe cut in. "I say to let it rest for now. As you have probably noticed, we have quite a few vacancies in our ranks that have to be filled as quickly as possible. I believe then that a new round of promotions is in order. Are we all in agreement on this?" They all nodded.\n\n"Yes, we are," Stratus nodded. "We'll need to bring in a few hippogriffs from the Blackwings though. They have showed some good promise on the field, and it will take time before the next batch of proper officers comes out from the academies anyway. I say we use them for the time being." He noticed Tempest sending a smirk his direction, but Stratus decided to ignore that. Whatever the price, the army had to be rebuilt from the ground up. And they needed the Commandant and his griffs for that." #AAAAAAH

legation.101.d:0 "The Commandant couldn't help himself, sometimes. When he'd heard that Crack Lightning's plane had went down, he simply had to gloat over the reactionary fool. So when Crack Lightning was dragged before him, bruised and battered from his plane crash and the rough handling of his captors, Zephyr was wearing a huge grin. "You know I actually used to admire you, Crack."\n\n"What?" was Lightning's only response.\n"Yes, yes. The daring fighter ace, the devil-may-care attitude, it was quite inspiring. I even wrote an ode to your exploits. Not that it ever saw publication. When you returned from Wingbardy and started your pseudo-fascist wing of Aris First, I even thought that maybe you would be our Duce! But no. Instead you chose to champion reaction, embrace political opportunism. You even denied being a fascist!"\n\nDuring his monologue, Crack's eyes had focused on him and he'd blinked away at least some of his wooziness. "Oh shut up," he half-snarled, half-slurred, "You are a collaborating traitor and you don't know the first thing about fascism. I've met Beakolini, I've spoken to him. He doesn't care about your 'Equino-Avianic spirit' or your 'National Revolution,' he just wants a useful idiot to keep control of Aris for him."\n\nZephyr blinked. "You're not just a traitor, you're a clown. The Wingbardian Blackwings dye their wings to honour the victorious dead of the Falcorian War; they're meaningless on a hippogriff! All they say is that you love Wingbardy more than your own nation."\n\nZephyr scoffed, gestured for his griffs to drag him away. Crack was so parochial, so shortsighted. He was nothing like Beakolini. There was of course, no question as to his fate. He and his 'Phalanx' had siphoned energy from the National Revolution in the most insidious way. One less opportunist standing in the way of fascism."

legation.102.t:0 "The Annulment"
legation.102.d:0 "Two Blackwings pushed the set of doors open, admitting Zephyr into what had once been the palace's royal quarters. Finding the royal family had been fairly easy, all in all; those who had once been the monarchy's stalwart supporters had given them up almost immediately, just to court the Commandant's favour. It had not helped them in the end.\n\nLooking up from her place in the living room, Skystar was the first one to notice the newcomer's presence. Her eyes grew wide, as if the realization had suddenly dawned on her on what was about to happen. "M-Mom? It's-"\n\n"I know, dear. I know." Former queen Novo rose from her seat. There were bags beneath her eyes and lines across her face, yet those eyes carried the same energy, the same unbreakable spirit of years prior. Zephyr had to take a moment to collect himself. Never before he had felt the Equino-Avianic spirit in such tangible way.\n\n"So, the usurper finally shows himself," Novo spoke, her tone unusually placid. "I will assume that, now that you have taken my throne, you have no use for either of us, is that correct?" She let out an haughty scoff as Zephyr remained silent. "Unsurprising. How will it be then? A public affair or a shallow grave in the woods?" By her side, Skystar swallowed.\n\nZephyr, however, blinked in surprise. "Do I look like some crazy red or a republican? I'm a revolutionary, but I'm not going to start chopping heads because I feel like it!" He shook his head. "My fight was against the monarchy as a decadent institution, not against you nor your daughter. Indeed, you are free to leave whenever you want. The Grand Council has agreed to assign you both a private dwelling, where you may continue to live as private citizens."\n\nIt was Novo's turn to look surprised, even if for a brief moment. "Why? Are we to live on solely as a reminder of your great generosity? Is this nothing more than a vulgar PR move?"\n\n"I already stated my motivations," Zephyr pointed out. "In fact, I've been doing that since Winggarden. As for you, you may believe whatever you prefer, but the fact remains. You are free to join the new Hippogriffian society I'm now building, or to leave for wherever you want. No matter the choice, I wish both you and your daughter good luck." And then, much to Novo's surprise, Zephyr left without another word." #AAAAAAH

legation.103.d:0 "The office was deserted by now. The precious furniture had been moved and loaded onto the ship that very morning, ready to be shipped back home; what could not be brought for the trip had already been sold or destroyed. The only things that remained were a few cardboard boxes and some sensitive documents, already smouldering in the fireplace. Gappi leaned back in his chair on the balcony, savouring both the view and a fifth glass of wine in equal measure.\n\nThe sun was setting and, in a similar way, Gappi's dream was drawing to his conclusion as well. He scoffed; some might have found the comparison poetic, if they were in that sort of things. Gappi was not, and so he drank. The communication from Commandant Zephyr that Hippogriffia wouldn't be needing his, and the Wingbardian advisors', services any longer had arrived only a few days before, but Gappi had seen it coming from miles away. It was the inevitable conclusion of the power struggle that had been waged in Winggarden, one that he had lost. The Legation City had died a slow, yet unnoticed, death and Gappi had received the debatable honour of delivering the rotting remains in the claws of some other creature.\n\nThe griffon stirred the wine in his glass before taking another sip. He would have to report back to the Duce about his failure once he got back home; or maybe not. Maybe Beakolini wasn't even interested about the whole venture in North Zebrica, and would allow Gappi to fade away into obscurity, just like his project and promises. That was fine for Gappi; retirement could only do him some good.\n\nYet, there was another matter that gnawed at him, a worry giving him no respite. Gappi had landed years prior in a destroyed and ruined nation, one humbled by the combined powers of Colthage, Chiropterra and Wingbardy. But now? He was leaving behind a resurgent Hippogriffia, one that would eventually grow to challenge Wingbardy at sea once more.\n\n"I should have listened to Ocean Spray," he muttered, shaking his head. "We should have burned that blasted city to the ground."" #AAAAAAH

In a couple of weeks, I will have secured a couple of contracts with this new Commandant, or whatever title he wants to be called, and money will flow again. Nothing will fundamentally change; I can assure you."\n\nThe hippogriff nodded as he heard exactly what he wanted to hear from the other end. "Perfect. Next week then. I wish you a pleasant morning." Moonfeather placed the receiver back down and continued to enjoy his breakfast. It was not the first call he had done, but somegriff had to calm the investors. They got scared easily these days.\n\nAs he munched on some scrambled eggs, his gaze drifted nonchalantly along the pages of the newspaper in front of him. There was little interesting news and ... wait. Moonfeather made a double-take, nearly chocking on his breakfast. There had to be a mistake; surely, it was a mistake, or a very perfidious joke at the very least. According to the two-page-long article, Moonfeather was amongst the many industrialists who were to be arrested and have their own assets expropriated by the new fascist government. By direct edict of the Commandant!\n\nCold sweat run down Moonfeather's forehead. He had to move quickly, he decided. There had to be some creature, anyone, he could speak to. Perhaps even grease a palm or two like usual before ...\n\n"Forgive me, sir," his butler interrupted him, "but there are a few hippogriffs asking for you at the door.

She'd never expected to get out, but apparently somegriff with some strings to pull had liked what she had to say in her prison memoirs. Or perhaps the fascists had just wanted to make a display of generosity. Either way, she was out of prison, and her mind raced with thoughts of tracking down her old friends, figuring out who was alive, who was imprisoned, who had escaped, and who had died.\n\nFor now, she wandered aimlessly around Starfield, trying to shut her ears to the endless cacophony of their new music. Throughout her stay in prison, the fascists had experimented their dissonant creations on her and the other inmates. Initially she thought it was an exotic form of torture, but they actually liked it! All the shapes, the sounds, the colours of the new Aris were sharp, excessive, violent, migraine-inducing. Maybe it was different in Seaquestria, or out in the country?\n\nStopping to sit down on a park bench, Posada noticed a pair of Blackwings had been following her. Ah. This is why they let her out: to have her assassinated like Gatteotti. Posada resolved not to give them the satisfaction of coming quietly. As they got closer she noticed something odd about their uniforms: it wasn't the traditional vests of Aris First, nor the militaristic garb of Beakolini's goons. No, this was...\n\n"Posada!" one of the blackwings called jovially, his eyes obscured by dark sunglasses, "I'd heard you just got out of jail! So, how do you like it?"\nHe was wearing a tight, black uniform accented by neon red lines, and a round cap exactly like the one Posada had once sketched out for the Revolutionary Worker's Party. He even had a magnetic clasp with an atom design on it. Posada's eye twitched as the fascists paraded their uniforms -her designs!- in front of her and addressed her as if she'd always been a fashionista."

According to former Legate Gappi, Zephyr Silversliver has not only asserted himself over the city of Winggarden but has also lead a successful military campaign towards the subjugation of the whole island. By now resistance has ceased and the NUHF has full control over Hippogriffia. The whereabouts of the royal family are unknown at the moment.\n\nAs for the Duce, he has received the news with a mixed reaction. There's no doubt he would have preferred to maintain a weak Hippogriffia unable to challenge our supremacy at sea and, even if in theory the new government has ideological affinities with ours, Commandant Silversliver has made no secret of his objective being restoring Hippogriffia to the role of great power.\n\nAt the moment though, with our attention turned to the affairs on the continent, our options for intervention are either limited or, according more realist griffons, nearly non-existent.

Wingbardy had lost sight of true fascism; the flame, once bright as it was carried forward by Beakolini and his party, was dying.\n\nHow else could he describe it? The PNF was slowly but inevitable morphing into a grey, lifeless, bureaucratic system. Where was the strength? The shocking energy of futurism? The more he looked at Wingbardy, the more Zephyr saw the chains of reaction tightening around the nation. Was a slow death what waited fascism and Hippogriffia as well?\n\nThe hippogriff laid back in his chair, musing silently. He had thought about what Crack Lightning had told him and, on one single aspect, he had been right. Hippogriffia was not Wingbardy; it was a bright sun, a beating heart sustaining the strong and virile body of the national revolution. They no longer needed Wingbardy, nor Beakolini and his Blackwings. Their help had been precious, and Hippogriffia had been breathed life anew into its once rotting body, but now it was finally time for their paths to diverge. It was time for the hippogriffs to carry the torch of fascism towards new heights, free from the failures of the past.\n\nZephyr Silversliver rose from his chair with newly-found energy, and sent for his entire general staff. There was much to prepare, and armies to gather for the struggle that would soon commence. Hippogriffia would soar again, that had always been Zephyr's promise.

### Legation Advisors ###
WIN_advisor_1:0 "Gilippo Gappi"
WIN_advisor_1_desc:0 "If there is one creature within Winggarden that could be said to embody what the Legation means for the nations involved, it would be Gilippo Gappi. Once just a minor diplomat in Wingbardy's foreign service, Gappi played an immense role in getting the griffons to seize the chance offered by the Colthaginian and Chiropterran invasion of the Hippogriffs' continental mandate, seeing tremendous economic opportunity in the venture. He had known these lands for years before entering the diplomatic service, serving in the seas around Zebrica as a member of the Wingbardian Navy and Air Force, where he pioneered airship technology and added much of Zebrica to Wingbardian maps. So when Wingbardy needed a diplomat to head their new involvements in Zebrica, Gilippo's application was readily accepted, and he was sent once again to Zebrica to work out treaties with Wingbardy's new allies on the continent. Gilippo was also the griffon who sat at the negotiating table with the Hippogriffs and placed before them the now-infamous Twelve Concessions. With the Legation being a concession of his own inception. An international zone jointly ruled by the three nations.\n\nBut this is where Gappi faltered. He believed that the legation would be able to exist in perpetual peace. But now, with the reality of the Legation's situation clear to him, he has joined in its great game to ensure the interests of his nation come out on top.\n\n"
WIN_advisor_2:0 "Ocean Spray"
WIN_advisor_2_desc:0 "Ocean Spray was born to a couple of Silver Moon Legion Soldiers forty-four years ago, entering the service as quickly as he could, he slowly began to climb the Legion's ranks, but not in the way most did. He was not a military bat, but a pencil-pushing bureaucrat, though one adept at his job. In his early thirties, he signed up for the LMRD, serving to organize and structure their less savory business into a form more palatable by the rest of the Legions. This work gained him the attention of Emerald Light, who marked the Bat down for a higher position at a later time. That time came at Chiropterra's triumph over the Hippogriffs, when it and its allies established Winggarden. While the Council of Legions was looking for a bat to send, Emerald put Ocean Spray forth. He was competent, pious, and seemed like a good choice. But he was also personally loyal to his Silver Moon legion, a detail Commander Light was sure to leave out.\n\nPersonally, Spray is no kind soul. He is a harsh bat, and is only a bit nicer to his friends than enemies and only has a few hobbies. He holds a general disdain for the hippogriff and seapony populations, and is always preparing for a struggle against them. He often chides against his fellow representatives, continually wishing to assure his control over the Legation military, sometimes even against the other Chiropterran commanders' advice. Many question why someone as un-charismatic as him was placed as the Chiropterran representative.\n\nSecretly though, this is all part of Chiropterra's place in the great game of Winggarden. Once a month Ocean Spray receives two letters. One from the Legionary Council and Warmaster of Chiropterra, his "official" orders, and another delievered to him secretly, Operation Nightlight, Winggarden's place in Lunar dominance of Zebrica, and then, further beyond.\n\n§CHe serves Her Imperial Majesty, Nightmare Moon, and the Silver Legion above all other things, and he will not betray his duty.§!\n\n"
WIN_advisor_3:0 "Azizelqart Zahummid"
WIN_advisor_3_desc:0 "Azizelqart Zahummid is a name most in Colthage will know, but they can't tell you much about him. His whole life, he has been an economist working in the back rooms of Colthaginian government to guide its ship of state. A member of Zamilcar Zarca's favored Scientific Clique, he fled with Zalathel when the Storm King arrived and served in his cabinet when he reestablished his rule over Colthage, earning him a high place in the economics ministry. In this regard, many would be content to stop there, sit on their rear end, and make a happy and healthy living. And Azizelqart was content for a long time, until he read Gappi's documents regarding the opportunities in establishing the Legation. It made something burn deep within him, an opportunity to try his economic theories in a land where he had near-total control of the economic sphere. So, he drafted his proposal to Zalathel and submitted it, requesting the spot as Colthage's representative in the Legation, and promising great things should his efforts be supported. And so he was sent to Winggarden with a blank cheque. To do as he sees fit, and to bring prosperity to Colthage.\n\n§gFor the good of all its citizens.§!\n\n"

### Leader Descriptions ### 
WIN_GILIPO_GAPPI_DESC:0 "If there is one creature within Winggarden that could be said to embody what the Legation means for the nations involved, it would be Gilippo Gappi. But now that mission has failed, and he sits atop a shadow of what Winggarden once was. Once just a minor diplomat in Wingbardy's foreign service, Gappi played an immense role in getting the griffons to seize the chance offered by the Colthaginian and Chiropterran invasion of the Hippogriffs' continental mandate, seeing tremendous economic opportunity in the venture. He had known these lands for years before entering the diplomatic service, serving in the seas around Zebrica as a member of the Wingbardian Navy and Air Force, where he pioneered airship technology and added much of Zebrica to Wingbardian maps. So when Wingbardy needed a diplomat to head their new involvements in Zebrica, Gilippo's application was readily accepted, and he was sent once again to Zebrica to work out treaties with Wingbardy's new allies on the continent. Gilippo was also the griffon who sat at the negotiating table with the Hippogriffs and placed before them the now-infamous Twelve Concessions. With the Legation being a concession of his own inception, he now sees that vision has failed.\n\nSo now he has a new job, find a Hippogriff who can adopt his Leader's ideology. And pray to the Trinity that it will keep the city stable."
WIN_OCEAN_SPRAY_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 20th of April, 960 in Batsby\n\n§YBiography§!: Ocean Spray was born to a couple of Silver Moon Legion soldiers; entering the service as quickly as he could he slowly began to climb the Legion's ranks, but not in the way most did. He was not a military bat, but a pencil-pushing bureaucrat, though one adept at his job. In his early thirties, he signed up for the LMRD, serving to organize and structure their less savory business into a form more palatable by the rest of the Legions, eventually rising to be the Chiropterran Legate in Winggarden. But recently, things have changed.\n\nPersonally, Spray is no kind soul. He is a harsh bat, and is only a bit nicer to his friends than enemies and only has a few hobbies. He holds a general disdain for the hippogriff and seapony populations, and is always preparing for a struggle against them.\n\nBut now he has hit a new height. The Warmaster now sends him new orders. No longer is the plan to be careful subversion and maintaining control, now it shall only be absolute domination. Ocean Spray has seized his chance and has upended Chiropterran policy in Hippogriffia. He intends to use his position for the good of the nation and aim a "Dagger at Mount Aris" as he regularly says to his assistants.\n\nOcean Spray is in control of Winggarden now. And Nightmare help any creature who stands in his way. \n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
WIN_AZIZELQUART_ZAHUMIND_DESC:0 "Azizelqart Zahummid is a name most in Colthage will know, but they can't tell you much about him. His whole life, he has been an economist working in the back rooms of Colthaginian government to guide its ship of state, and now the guardian of a new nation, the Colthago Nuovo Project. A member of Zamilcar Zarca's favored Scientific Clique, he fled with Zalathel when the Storm King arrived and served in his cabinet when he reestablished his rule over Colthage, earning him a high place in the economics ministry. In this regard, many would be content to stop there, sit on their rear end, and make a happy and healthy living. And Azizelqart was content for a long time, until he read Gappi's documents regarding the opportunities in establishing the Legation. It made something burn deep within him, an opportunity to try his economic theories in a land where he had near-total control of the economic sphere. He just never expected to be leading it. After the fall of the Legation, Zahummid has done his best to save many aspects of the previous system. And with this, he has had even more freedom to implement his economic ideas. He has declared that his Colthago Nuovo will be a bastion of free market economics, proving that a nation can run itself off of the power of capital alone. But only time will show if he can succeed."
WIN_COFFEE_BEAN_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 18th of September, 965 in Bridlepolis\n\n§YBiography§!: Born the youngest of four foals to a well-off family, Coffee Bean's early years were chaotic but happy. After graduating from high school, he and his father toured the world together, visiting cities across all the continents. These trips made a big impression on the young pony, and exposed him to a wide variety of creatures and cultures.\n\nAfter receiving a bachelor's degree in economics, he founded a private military company: Bean Security. His company provided contract security services to the Equestrian government and received massive amounts of money in the process. However, he was soon dogged by controversy, suspected of being involved in illegal activities including unlicensed drug manufacturing, smuggling, and tax evasion—this unreliable reputation led Equestria not to renew their contract with Bean Security.\n\nGiven his strained relationship with the Equestrian government and various legal issues, Coffee Bean decided to turn his gaze elsewhere and began offering security, logistics, and transportation services to any nation that could pay. A true adventure seeker, he never shied away from sending his mercenaries anywhere in the world, no matter the danger.\n\nCoffee Bean has been married three times and is currently divorced. His personal interests include golfing, poetry, meditation, water skiing, and recreational drug use.\n\nA libertarian to his core, Coffee Bean distrusts government and advocates the decriminalisation of drugs, a free market economy which does not redistribute wealth, and upholding free trade. Now in total control of Winggarden, he finally has a place to transform into the liberty-loving utopia he's always dreamed of.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
WIN_COFFEE_BEAN_LIBERTALIA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 18th of September, 965 in Bridlepolis\n\n§YBiography§!: Few who hear the name Coffee Bean can resist becoming fascinated by the stallion and his improbable journey. After leaving Equestria, he travelled across the world leading a courageous band of mercenaries to the shores of every continent, amassing fame and fortune in the process. In Winggarden, when he saw citizens suffering under the unjust hoof of foreign tyrants, he kicked them out and freed the city, turning it into a stronghold of liberty.\n\nBut his exploits did not end there. Against all odds he struck down Hippogriffia and formed Libertalia from the ashes, a place where everycreature can live their life as they please, free from government oppression. Coffee Bean: visionary, conqueror, and founder of a new nation. Now he is happy, finally able to relax and revel in his victory.\n\nThat's what was supposed to happen, at least.\n\nThe unfortunate reality is that, for a pony who craves adventure, having to deal with the realities of running a country is... exhausting to say the least. No matter how hard he tries, there is no avoiding the daily slog of administration. It's safe to say the novelty of Libertalia has worn off, and Coffee Bean is already bored with the project. What he now desires more than anything is simply peace and quiet, and an escape from the weighty responsibilities that have fallen on his shoulders.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"

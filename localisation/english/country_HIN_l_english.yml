doelhi_news.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The Jeweled Maharaja, Rucerva, has at last unified Hindia under a disparate coalition of princes, merchants, agrarian revolutionaries, with just a little help from the world's friends of democracy. Rucerva's efforts at unifying the Southern Hindians into a confederation under the princely rule of Doelhi will make him an ideal candidate to do the same to the subcontinent at large, as a new order predicated upon self-rule and self-determination emerges with him at its head. The unification of Hindia with Doelhi front-and-center spells the end of the era of the Vikingar and the beginning of an independent Hindian confederacy."

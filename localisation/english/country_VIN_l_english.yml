### Focuses
## Starting AOA tree
VIN_the_AOA_debate:0 "The AOA Debate"
VIN_the_AOA_debate_desc: "Due to competition from Strawberry, Francistria, and even from Equestria, wine trade is at an all time low. The capital is thinking of a new law to put hidden tarrifs on foreign wines by forbidding the sale of foreign products under the name of traditional Aquileian ones. No more will the market be flooded with cheap Karthinian wine called Traditional Vinovian Wine, and money should go back in the pocket of our peasants. We just need to see how to implement this plan first."
VIN_listen_to_the_small_producers:0 "Listen to the Small Producers"
VIN_listen_to_the_small_producers_desc: "As expected, the small wine producers are delighted by this change. Low nobles and small farmers, who were the most struck by the current market situation have been advocating for such a change for years, and they are more than happy to learn that it'll apply to their fellow cheesmakers too."
VIN_the_grand_domains_argument:0 "The Grand Domains Arguments"
VIN_the_grand_domains_argument_desc: "In an unexpected turn of event rich landowners have banded together to push back against the AOA project. The fact is that they have been adapting to the market, and are now part of the problem, selling a cheap wine called the Pinard in high quantities themselves. Worst of all, it seems like republicans stand behind them, saying that the AOA is an elitist project that will deny the common people the ability to buy wine and other common products, under the pretext it has been made in the wrong village. We must find a settlement if we don't want a full blown revolution striking us over such an important issue."

VIN_an_unlikely_opinion:0 "An Unlikely Opinion"
VIN_an_unlikely_opinion_desc: "There is one high noble that has been supporting the AOA plan from the begining, the baron Pierre de Skyluzzo, despite his vast domains, has been quite found of the idea of preserving the purity of Aquileian wine, and have refused to adapt like his peers have done. If we were to secure his support by promising him to preserve the purity of our wine, we could actually flip the political ballance and have a gateway into negociating with the other landowners."
VIN_solve_AOA_debate:0 "Solve the debate"
VIN_solve_AOA_debate_desc: "Not every problem need a complex solution, by simply adding the Pinard as an umbrella term into the list of traditional wines produced in Vinovia, not only we could let our own producers do whatever they want, but we can also stop foreign producer from flooding our market with pinard, forcing them to come up with new name that Aquileian customers aren't familiar with. Of course foreign producers won't be happy about that, but, unlike us, it's unlikely that they'd go to war for a bottle of wine."
VIN_economic_renivesments:0 "Economic Reinvestments"
VIN_economic_renivesments_desc: "The AOA plan went beyond our first expectations, to a point where Vinovian economy is starting to go up surprizingly fast. By reinvesting that surplus into our local producers, we could multiply this effect and ."

VIN_the_duke_in_his_castle_desc:0 "While Vinovia is still relatively calm, it would be foolish to not see the writing on the wall. Whichever way the wing blows, the time of absolutism is over. The duke has conveyed a council with all the Vinovians peers of Aquileia to write a liberal Constitution, promising sweeping reforms to his beloved commoners. Some says that this assembly has no legitimate power and is a direct attack to the royal authority, but if Moriset wanted his kingdom to be united, maybe he shouldn't have made it fall apart."

He then wrote the Edict of Skyaluzzo that is still today ensuring the stability of the region, but greatly limits the Duke's ability to crack down on republicans, forcing him to cooperate with them instead, to the ire of his nephew, the king Moriset."

By promoting local cultures, he convinced the population that he wasn't yet another disconected Aquilan noble. This policy however turned in a promise race with the Duke biggest competitor, the republican Cécile Geaudreau, which has been benefiting of the edict of Skyaluzzo to make her own promise on how the local way of life would be protected if the Republican were to take power again."

### Events

vinovia.1.t:0 "The AOA Project"
vinovia.1.d:0 "#TODO An event about the fact the Duke is learning about a project that might help Vinovian dire situation. The AOA project which is a protectionist policy on that will limit foregn wine export, which should help the Vinovian economy. The envoy from Aquila asks him if Vinovia is in, and the Duke says that he first have to meet with the faction within Vinovia, as his power relly on the fragile balance between them. "
vinovia.1.a:0 "That's a good news... I think."

vinovia.2.t:0 "Meeting With the Peoples"
vinovia.2.d:0 "#TODO the Duke is secretly meeting envoys of the three big republican factions in a backroom. The AOA is popular within the little wine producers because they make quality wine, the Knight of Fidelity envoy is happy to see such an upholding tradition measure, however SIE says that it bears the risk of making wine the beverage of the rich but they are still pleased of how it will screw over the big estates." 
vinovia.2.a:0 "It went better than expected"

vinovia.3.t:0 "An Incident at the Court"
vinovia.3.d:0 "#TODO As the Duke is holding court, a Baron that hold a big estate call out the Duke about the rumors about the AOA. The big producers, who just happens to be the nobles who support the Duke are pretty pissed off because they recently switched to producing cheap wines, affectively called Pinards, which is very popular amongst soldiers and workers all across Aquileia. Since none of the Pinards brand will get included within the AOA, they fear that their estates will completely fall behind and that with no more cheap wine produced in Aquileia, the plan will backfire horibly and let the foreign producer completely take over the wine market."
vinovia.3.a:0 "I have a letter to send"

vinovia.4.t:0 "An Excentric Noble"
vinovia.4.d:0 "#TODO Now that the Duke is unsure about Vinovia even participating in the AOA, the count Robert of Skyaluzzo approach him saying that his estates never switched to cheap wines, and that other nobles will only get the punition they deserve for distording old Vinovian traditions like that. He is clearly deranged and speaks about wine almost as a divine being that shouldn't even exist in such an impure form. He says he will gladly support the duke if he ever was to support this agreement."
vinovia.4.a:0 "Now that's interesting"

vinovia.5.t:0 "Keeping our Promisses"
vinovia.5.d:0 "#TODO, an advisor is informing the Duke that the crisis have passed, and while they had a hard time, it seems he have managed to regain support from both the nobility and the small producer. While this support is still a bit fragile, he could probably discard the Promisses made to the count of Skyluzzo, as he is no longer as important as before. That is, of course if no crisis challenge the Duke's power again in the following weeks."
vinovia.5.a:0 "Let's play safe"
vinovia.5.b:0 "To Tartarus with him!"
vinovia.5.b.tt:0 "§rNothing ever happens...§! \nThis would make you flip to fascism, but I will make this path last"

vinovia.6.t:0 "A Call for Revolution"
vinovia.6.d:0 "Yvette Lefebvre tended to her farm in the Vigovian countryside; the work had become harder now that her grandgriffs had moved to Aquila for better job opportunities. Despite her advanced age, Yvette was just as active as ever. She was busy ploughing the fallow fields for the growing season before a car parked in front of her farm, and a young griff hopped out of the driver's seat.\n\n"Bonjour, Madame. The storms are brewing, and the corruption of the Discrets go deep. Too many common griffs like you suffer under his self-serving policies," he introduced, showing a flyer to the elderly griff. Yvette frowned as her eyes scanned through the flyer – it had the tricolor of the former Republic on top, with a subversive cartoon of Moriset strapped to a guillotine. "If you wish, I can-"\n\n"Not interested!" Yvette interrupted with a grunt. She crumpled the flyer into a ball and threw it back at the griff. \n\nThe republican blinked and forced a smile. "Madame, the Discrets are no better than the Herzlanders who ruled over us long ago. We have to fight for a better future – monarchism is on its deathbed, and we only need to see the Griffonian Empire as an example."\n\n"I still remember the First Revolution and all the bloodshed and chaos it brought here. Bandits stole our crops and burned down our farmhouse. And now you expect me to help you once more?" Yvette laughed mockingly. "Take your flyers to griffs who are interested. I will not risk the lives of my chicks and grandchicks for another war.""
vinovia.6.a:0 "Not every griff accepted the call."

### Ideas
VIN_edit_de_skyaluzzo:0 "Edit de Skyaluzzo"
VIN_edit_de_skyaluzzo_desc:0 "When during the first revolution the Duke Gadifer dissembarked with a group of faithfull ponies in Skyaluzzo, he promissed a Ducal pardon to all Republicans that would lay down arms. He then wrote the Edict of Skyaluzzo that is still today ensuring the stability of the region, but greatly limits the Duke's ability to crack down on republicans, forcing him to cooperate with them instead, to the ire of his nephew, the king Moriset."
VIN_pascifist_tendancy:0 "Moult Me Tarde"
VIN_pascifist_tendancy_desc:0 "\"Many awaits for me at home\", Vinovian motto\nThis sentence encapsulate the whole pacifist tendancy that always existed in the Vinovian culture. The Vinovian never viewed war as a glorious affair, but as a dirty duty that only brings ruin and death."
VIN_promotion_of_local_culture:0 "Promotion of Local Cultures"
VIN_promotion_of_local_culture_desc:0 "Vinovia is not Aquila, just like Skyaluzzo and Vigovia have different cultures as well, and the Duke understands it well. By promoting local cultures, he convinced the population that he wasn't yet another disconected Aquilan noble. This policy however turned in a promise race with the Duke biggest competitor, the republican Cécile Geaudreau, which has been benefiting of the edict of Skyaluzzo to make her own promise on how the local way of life would be protected if the Republican were to take power again."
VIN_the_wine_crisis_1:0 "The Wine Crisis"
VIN_the_wine_crisis_1_desc:0 "In addition to the interupted Coltbert reforms, Vinovia is currently struck by an unprecedented crisis on the Wine trade. Cheap wines from Wingbardy are flooding the market while high quality wines from Francistria, Strawberry and even New Mareland are directly competeing with our finnest Chateaux. Small wineries that made up the bulk of our economy are closing one after the other against more organized foreign producers that they simply cannot compete with."
VIN_the_wine_crisis_2:0 "The AOA System"
VIN_the_wine_crisis_2_desc:0 "Establishing the AOA has allowed our economy to soar once more and our wineries are now registering profit that weren't seen since the previous generation. With a small push we should be able to get our economy back on track for the generation to come."

### Events

vinovia.1.t:0 "The AOA Project"
vinovia.1.d:0 "#TODO An event about the fact the Duke is learning about a project that might help Vinovian dire situation. The AOA project which is a protectionist policy on that will limit foregn wine export, which should help the Vinovian economy. The envoy from Aquila asks him if Vinovia is in, and the Duke says that he first have to meet with the faction within Vinovia, as his power relly on the fragile balance between them. "
vinovia.1.a:0 "That's a good news... I think."

vinovia.2.t:0 "Meeting With the Peoples"
vinovia.2.d:0 "#TODO the Duke is secretly meeting envoys of the three big republican factions in a backroom. The AOA is popular within the little wine producers because they make quality wine, the Knight of Fidelity envoy is happy to see such an upholding tradition measure, however Amis de ABC says that it bears the risk of making wine the beverage of the rich but they are still pleased of how it will screw over the big estates." 
vinovia.2.a:0 "It went better than expected"

vinovia.3.t:0 "An Incident at the Court"
vinovia.3.d:0 "#TODO As the Duke is holding court, a Baron that hold a big estate call out the Duke about the rumors about the AOA. The big producers, who just happens to be the nobles who support the Duke are pretty pissed off because they recently switched to producing cheap wines, affectively called Pinards, which is very popular amongst soldiers and workers all across Aquileia. Since none of the Pinards brand will get included within the AOA, they fear that their estates will completely fall behind and that with no more cheap wine produced in Aquileia, the plan will backfire horibly and let the foreign producer completely take over the wine market."
vinovia.3.a:0 "I have a letter to send"

vinovia.4.t:0 "An Excentric Noble"
vinovia.4.d:0 "#TODO Now that the Duke is unsure about Vinovia even participating in the AOA, the count Robert of Skyaluzzo approach him saying that his estates never switched to cheap wines, and that other nobles will only get the punition they deserve for distording old Vinovian traditions like that. He is clearly deranged and speaks about wine almost as a divine being that shouldn't even exist in such an impure form. He says he will gladly support the duke if he ever was to support this agreement."
vinovia.4.a:0 "Now that's interesting"

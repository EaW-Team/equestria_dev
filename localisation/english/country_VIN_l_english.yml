VIN_edit_de_skyaluzzo:0 "Edit de Skyaluzzo"
VIN_edit_de_skyaluzzo_desc:0 "When during the first revolution the Duke Gadifer dissembarked with a group of faithfull ponies in Skyaluzzo, he promissed a Ducal pardon to all Republicans that would lay down arms. He then wrote the Edict of Skyaluzzo that is still today ensuring the stability of the region, but greatly limits the Duke's ability to crack down on republicans, forcing him to cooperate with them instead, to the ire of his nephew, the king Moriset."

VIN_pascifist_tendancy_desc:0 "\"Many awaits for me at home\", Vinovian motto\nThis sentence encapsulate the whole pacifist tendancy that always existed in the Vinovian culture. The Vinovian never viewed war as a glorious affair, but as a dirty duty that only brings ruin and death."
VIN_promotion_of_local_culture:0 "Promotion of Local Cultures"
VIN_promotion_of_local_culture_desc:0 "Vinovia is not Aquila, just like Skyaluzzo and Vigovia have different cultures as well, and the Duke understands it well. By promoting local cultures, he convinced the population that he wasn't yet another disconected Aquilan noble. This policy however turned in a promise race with the Duke biggest competitor, the republican Cécile Geaudreau, which has been benefiting of the edict of Skyaluzzo to make her own promise on how the local way of life would be protected if the Republican were to take power again."

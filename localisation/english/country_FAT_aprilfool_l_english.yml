 chaos.1.title:0 "The Sin of Weakness" #sweet
 chaos.1.desc:0 "For decades, these supposed 'revolutionaries' had cowered up here in the north, setting up their little fiefdoms and playing at democracy. It disgusted him, knowing that these bleating sheep may well try to oppose him, even as they long since had lost the right to it. Merely the idea of them remaining made bile spill up in his throat, and giving the order was the easiest thing he could ever had done. More than that, it was exhilarating, like something was put right.\n\nAs his Void Knights moved out into the city, kicking down the doors of any of those who had had a leading role in the the old government. Further outside Cloudbury, other groups of knights were striking in all other cities as well. They, their families, their friends and everycreature who were close to them, all rounded up and sent to the stockyards outside Cloudbury.\n\nWith the chaos and starvation that had raged across the north, their failure was clear. Decades had passed, and they had nothing to show fore it. They were worse than useless, parasites on what was now his realm, and he was their judge." 
 chaos.1.a:0 "And yet, they may still be part of the solution."

 chaos.2.title:0 "A Mysterious Bounty" #sweet
 chaos.2.desc:0 "Dawnclaw grabbed the leg of meat in front of him, tearing into it with pleasure. His generals - lining the sides of the great table in front of him, enjoyed their feast as well. All of them except one, and Dawnclaw paid close notice to the figure far down the left side of the table as they stared at the plate in front of them where a bounty of meat awaited.\n\n"Getting a little fussy are we?" he drawled as he stared him down. "The famine is abating, and we're feasting to celebrate that nogriff goes hungry. What's wrong?" An entire table filled with void knights, traitor generals and bandits who had flocked to his side all turned to stare him down. Rising from his seat, Dawnclaw lumbered over to him and leaned in over him. "Are you not enjoying the feast I provided for you?" he asked, his transformation and the armor he wore both making him tower above Rosewing. Rosewing sat silent, staring down at the plate. He knew where the meat came from... was he going to actually push it?\n\n"Come on Claus," another voice chimed in from the other side of the table as Reinhart Suntail leaned forward. "In a few weeks Dawnclaw did more than Kemerskai could do in decades. And besides we're committed already. For once in your life suck it up and enjoy the spoils of our triumph." Suntail was a good one. He had fallen in line eagerly, and Dawnclaw could tell there was nothing he wouldn't do if it would give him victory. Rosewing, however, was trapped in delusions still. Would he have to die? Thankfully, he wouldn't, as he grabbed the hunk of meat and tore into it aggressively, eating in silence as Dawnclaw grinned. Stepping back to his seat, Dawnclaw grabbed his wine glass and raised it high to toast them."
 chaos.2.a:0 "To victory and vengeance, no matter the coast!" 

 chaos.3.title:0 "The Cry for Vengeance" #sweet
 chaos.3.desc:0 "How fiercely does not the rage that has festered in these lands for decades burn? These revolutionaries were promised liberty only to be given exile and starvation as their leaders bickered and schemed. Who threw everything away for a cause that produced only bitter defeat and shame. How hot is not the fury of those who see all that they were supposed to fight for rot away and who end up with nothing? Decades of anger, of resentment and disappointment... and as they finally, truly, lose hope, they see what lies beyond their hopes and dreams. Hate... hate... hate towards their false leaders, towards the preening emperor and his lapdogs, and towards the world who would deny them what they were promised.\n\nSo hate, my war birds, hate as fiercely as you can, and you will claim what is yours! The Herzland sits fat and happy in the south, denying you your rightful place, and the corpse they now worship would presume to be your new god!? You already know there will never be peace, only death. There will be no justice but the one won in blood! There will be no vindication of your ideals other than the one that you force the world to accept at bayonet point. There will be no reconciliation, only the futile struggles of your enemies as you drown them and their false corpse-god in their own blood! "
 chaos.3.a:0 "Cast down the idols! Destroy the temples! Slay the priests! Show these fools that they worship nothing more than a rotting corpse!"

 chaos.4.title:0 "Dealing with the Local Tongues" #sweet
 chaos.4.desc:0 "Decades in these lands, and yet the revolutionaries could not even cow the locals to speak a language that makes sense. They thought they would conquer the Herzland when they couldn't even conquer the waggling tongues of the locals. It had served as an endless source of amusement, and the hilarity of the situation came to its peak when some of them decided to actually speak their gibberish in Dawnclaw's presence. They paid the price, as the Warmaster reached out and snapped their necks without a moment's hesitation before dumping their bodies in the streets as a warning to the rest of the locals.\n\nThe Cloudburians will learn to speak a proper language, and they will do so posthaste as we will simply cut out the tongue of anyone caught speaking their local dialect, and if they think to rise up in retaliation we will simply massacre every last of them as well as everygriff they ever loved. Destiny awaits us, and these pathetic issues are unworthy of our time."
 chaos.4.a:0 "They can learn, they just need motivation."

 chaos.5.title:0 "Rottendedam is Ours!" #sweet
 chaos.5.desc:0 "Our forces have stormed the city of Rottendedam, and the streets run red with blood! The Feathisians' access to the sea is cut off, and we'll slowly begin strangling the Herzland as the road to Skyfall lies open as well."
 chaos.5.a:0 "First this city, then all of the Herzland!"

 chaos.6.title:0 "The Weaklings Fight Back!" #sweet
 chaos.6.desc:0 "Despite the efforts of our warriors, the Feathisians have managed to repel us! The preening swamp crows think they have beat us, but we will soon return."
 chaos.6.a:0 "We will be back!"

 chaos.7.title:0 "Northern Assaults" #sweet
 chaos.7.desc:0 "The forces of Ferdinand Dawnclaw attempted to storm Rottendedam, and only the fierce efforts of our soldiers could repel them and their strange new knights. We saved the city for now, but we would be foolish to believe he will let this be the end of it."
 chaos.7.a:0 "They will come again, so be ready!"

 chaos.8.title:0 "Loc needed. event happens after the defense of Rottendedam has failed, feathesia event" #sweet
 chaos.8.desc:0 "The forces of Ferdinand Dawnclaw has stormed Rottendedam, and despite our best efforts to defend it, the city has fallen. Overwhelming our defences with mad fury and these strange new knights, they are now engaging in a bloody orgy of destruction throughout the city."
 chaos.8.a:0 "Gods help us..."

 chaos.9.title:0 "Storming Readwetter" #sweet
 chaos.9.desc:0 "Despite the efforts of the Grand Duchess, our forces have seized control of her capitol, and they are now swarming into her palace to drag her kicking and screaming before the warmaster!"
 chaos.9.a:0 "Come out, come out, wherever you are!"

 chaos.10.title:0 "The Weaklings Fight Back!" #sweet
 chaos.10.desc:0 "The pampered fops of the Strawberry Duchy has resisted our forces! Though we came without eyesight of Readewetter, the Grand Duchess simply stood on the balcony to taunt our forces with a toast as we were beaten back!"
 chaos.10.a:0 "Enjoy your wine, hag, for soon you will taste blood!"

 chaos.11.title:0 "A Storm from the North" #sweet
 chaos.11.desc:0 "The mad cultists that have infested Cloudbury struck against us without warning, and they have poured into the duchy to try to seize Readewetter. Thankfully, our forces beat them back, and to raise the spirits of the city, the Grand Duchess publicly taunted them from her balcony as they retreated."
 chaos.11.a:0 "Now begone, crazed vultures!"

 chaos.12.title:0 "The Duchy Bleeds" #sweet
 chaos.12.desc:0 "It is a dark day for our realm, as the mad cultists of Ferdinand Dawnclaw has managed to not only break through our defenses, but even capture the city of Readewetter. There is chaos in the streets, as the attackers show neither mercy nor restraint, and the people are fleeing in panic."
 chaos.12.a:0 "Smuggle the Grand Duchess out through the sewers, get her out of here!"

 chaos.13.title:0 "Rottendedam has Fallen" #sweet
 chaos.13.desc:0 "The treasonous Ferdiand Dawnclaw has struck from the north and managed to capture the port city of Rottendedam. What news reach us from the city speak of chaos and death, and the audacious attack has proven that the threat from the north is now much greater than it ever was before."
 chaos.13.a:0 "Enjoy your victories while you can, traitors!"

 chaos.14.title:0 "Readewetter has Fallen" #sweet
 chaos.14.desc:0 "The capitol of the Strawberry Duchy burns tonight, as the forces of Ferdinand Dawnclaw struck fast and hard and managed to seize it. The whereabouts of Gabriela Eagleclaw is still unknown, but we may well have to fear the worst."
 chaos.14.a:0 "Enjoy your victories while you can, traitors!"

 chaos.20.title:0 "Indulgence is the Right of Kings" #sweet
 chaos.20.desc:0 "Ferdinand Dawnclaw had never cared for religion. It had always seem like trite moralising meant to deny you the pleasures in life. When you celebrated life with food and drink, some tiresome old priest would come and crow at you about moderation. When you indulged in the pleasures of the flesh you'd be shamed for it. When you sampled the wonders that the flowers and plants of the natural world or the chemicals produced by the brilliant minds of science could produce you were a pathetic addict. Again and again they sought to deny you any pleasure 'for your own good', and what existence was even that? A grey, hollow one bereft of all the things that made life worth living.\n\nWhen he strangled that miserable little scientist and took his blueprints for himself, Dawnclaw realized he had finally opened a door for himself. He was the master of the rebellion against the corpse in Griffenheim, and he would break that weakling in the end. Why wouldn't he enjoy himself however he could? Was that not what every king and emperor had done, indulge themselves? Did they not live the best life, surrounded by all the wealth and pleasure that life could offer them? Did they not feast and revel in all the pleasures they could? Pleasure was the right of the mighty, and he was unsurpassed, the warmaster who would break all of Griffonia... so why would he not delight in every pleasure he could find?"
 chaos.20.a:0 "Yeeeesssss... you undersssssstand..."

 chaos.21.title:0 "Beyond the Meaningless World" #sweet
 chaos.21.desc:0 "The esoteric had always had a strange fascination for him. When he entered into the military, this fascination had had to fall by the wayside as politics and military hierarchy had become his world. A straight-laced, pragmatic understanding of the world that recently had become so unbearably stifling. He looked at the troops marshalled under his command, the simpering governors and local leaders desperate to do his bidding, the wealth that he had amassed, and it all felt hollow.\n\nWas this everything there was? This trite marshalling of petty griffs back and forth, these meaningless political chess games, was this where it all culminated? No, there had to be more to everything, and he had recently indulged himself in this old hobby.\n\nYet what he had found was not a hobby, but an obsession. He had diverted more and more resources to gathering lore of the more esoteric kind. Diving into books smuggled out of places like the Dread Peninsula or Barrad, books that would have drawn the ire of church and law both, he found himself sleeping less and less. There would be time for sleep when he was dead, the mad insights of these forbidden books were too compelling to leave aside, and left his mind expanding more and more."
 chaos.21.a:0 "Beyond madnessssss liessss enlightenment."

 chaos.1.title:0 "The Sin of Weakness" #sweet
 chaos.1.desc:0 "For decades, these supposed 'revolutionaries' had cowered up here in the north, setting up their little fiefdoms and playing at democracy. It disgusted him, knowing that these bleating sheep may well try to oppose him, even as they long since had lost the right to it. Merely the idea of them remaining made bile spill up in his throat, and giving the order was the easiest thing he could ever had done. More than that, it was exhilarating, like something was put right.\n\nAs his Void Knights moved out into the city, kicking down the doors of any of those who had had a leading role in the the old government. Further outside Cloudbury, other groups of knights were striking in all other cities as well. They, their families, their friends and everycreature who were close to them, all rounded up and sent to the stockyards outside Cloudbury.\n\nWith the chaos and starvation that had raged across the north, their failure was clear. Decades had passed, and they had nothing to show for it. They were worse than useless, parasites on what was now his realm, and he was their judge." 
 chaos.1.a:0 "And yet, they may still be part of the solution."

 chaos.2.title:0 "A Mysterious Bounty" #sweet
 chaos.2.desc:0 "Dawnclaw grabbed the leg of meat in front of him, tearing into it with pleasure. His generals - lining the sides of the great table in front of him, enjoyed their feast as well. All of them except one, and Dawnclaw paid close notice to the figure far down the left side of the table as they stared at the plate in front of them where a bounty of meat awaited.\n\n"Getting a little fussy are we?" he drawled as he stared him down. "The famine is abating, and we're feasting to celebrate that nogriff goes hungry. What's wrong?" An entire table filled with void knights, traitor generals and bandits who had flocked to his side all turned to stare him down. Rising from his seat, Dawnclaw lumbered over to him and leaned in over him. "Are you not enjoying the feast I provided for you?" he asked, his transformation and the armor he wore both making him tower above Rosewing. Rosewing sat silent, staring down at the plate. He knew where the meat came from... was he going to actually push it?\n\n"Come on Claus," another voice chimed in from the other side of the table as Reinhart Suntail leaned forward. "In a few weeks Dawnclaw did more than Kemerskai could do in decades. And besides, we're committed already. For once in your life suck it up and enjoy the spoils of our triumph." Suntail was a good one. He had fallen in line eagerly, and Dawnclaw could tell there was nothing he wouldn't do if it would give him victory. Rosewing, however, was trapped in delusions still. Would he have to die? Thankfully, he wouldn't, as he grabbed the hunk of meat and tore into it aggressively, eating in silence as Dawnclaw grinned. Stepping back to his seat, Dawnclaw grabbed his wine glass and raised it high to toast them."
 chaos.2.a:0 "To victory and vengeance, no matter the cost!"

 chaos.3.title:0 "The Cry for Vengeance" #sweet
 chaos.3.desc:0 "If you only could feel the anger and frustration of these revolutionaries. Decades of frustration and inaction in these lands... it has festered in them. These revolutionaries who were promised liberty only to be given exile and starvation as their leaders bickered and schemed. Who threw everything away for a cause that produced only bitter defeat and shame. They were supposed to fight for rot away and instead end up with nothing. Decades of anger, of resentment and disappointment... and as they finally, truly, lose hope, they see what lies beyond their hopes and dreams. Hate... hate... hate towards their false leaders, towards the preening emperor and his lapdogs, and towards the world who would deny them what they were promised.\n\nSo hate, my war birds, hate as fiercely as you can, and you will claim what is yours! The Herzland sits fat and happy in the south, denying you your rightful place, and the corpse they now worship would presume to be your new god!? You already know there will never be peace, only death. There will be no justice but the one won in blood! There will be no vindication of your ideals other than the one that you force the world to accept at bayonet point. There will be no reconciliation, only the futile struggles of your enemies as you drown them and their false corpse-god in their own blood!"
 chaos.3.a:0 "Show these fools that they worship nothing more than a rotting corpse!"

 chaos.4.title:0 "Dealing with the Local Tongues" #sweet
 chaos.4.desc:0 "Decades in these lands, and yet the revolutionaries could not even cow the locals to speak a language that makes sense. They thought they would conquer the Herzland when they couldn't even conquer the waggling tongues of the locals. It had served as an endless source of amusement, and the hilarity of the situation came to its peak when some of them decided to actually speak their gibberish in Dawnclaw's presence. They paid the price, as the Warmaster reached out and snapped their necks without a moment's hesitation before dumping their bodies in the streets as a warning to the rest of the locals.\n\nThe Cloudburians will learn to speak a proper language, and they will do so posthaste as we will simply cut out the tongue of anyone caught speaking their local dialect, and if they think to rise up in retaliation we will simply massacre every last of them as well as everygriff they ever loved. Destiny awaits us, and these pathetic issues are unworthy of our time."
 chaos.4.a:0 "They can learn, they just need motivation."

 chaos.5.title:0 "Rottendedam is Ours!" #sweet
 chaos.5.desc:0 "Our forces have stormed the city of Rottendedam, and the streets run red with blood! The Feathisians' access to the sea is cut off, and we'll slowly begin strangling the Herzland as the road to Skyfall lies open as well."
 chaos.5.a:0 "First this city, then all of the Herzland!"

 chaos.6.title:0 "The Weaklings Fight Back!" #sweet
 chaos.6.desc:0 "Despite the efforts of our warriors, the Feathisians have managed to repel us! The preening swamp crows think they have beat us, but we will soon return."
 chaos.6.a:0 "We will be back!"

 chaos.7.title:0 "Northern Assaults" #sweet
 chaos.7.desc:0 "The forces of Ferdinand Dawnclaw attempted to storm Rottendedam, and only the fierce efforts of our soldiers could repel them and their strange new knights. We saved the city for now, but we would be foolish to believe he will let this be the end of it."
 chaos.7.a:0 "They will come again, so be ready!"

 chaos.8.title:0 "Rottendedam Burns" #sweet
 chaos.8.desc:0 "The forces of Ferdinand Dawnclaw has stormed Rottendedam, and despite our best efforts to defend it, the city has fallen. Overwhelming our defences with mad fury and these strange new knights, they are now engaging in a bloody orgy of destruction throughout the city."
 chaos.8.a:0 "Gods help us..."

 chaos.9.title:0 "Storming Readwetter" #sweet
 chaos.9.desc:0 "Despite the efforts of the Grand Duchess, our forces have seized control of her capitol, and they are now swarming into her palace to drag her kicking and screaming before the warmaster!"
 chaos.9.a:0 "Come out, come out, wherever you are!"

 chaos.10.title:0 "The Weaklings Fight Back!" #sweet
 chaos.10.desc:0 "The pampered fops of the Strawberry Duchy has resisted our forces! Though we came without eyesight of Readewetter, the Grand Duchess simply stood on the balcony to taunt our forces with a toast as we were beaten back!"
 chaos.10.a:0 "Enjoy your wine, hag, for soon you will taste blood!"

 chaos.11.title:0 "A Storm from the North" #sweet
 chaos.11.desc:0 "The mad cultists that have infested Cloudbury struck against us without warning, and they have poured into the duchy to try to seize Readewetter. Thankfully, our forces beat them back, and to raise the spirits of the city, the Grand Duchess publicly taunted them from her balcony as they retreated."
 chaos.11.a:0 "Now begone, crazed vultures!"

 chaos.12.title:0 "The Duchy Bleeds" #sweet
 chaos.12.desc:0 "It is a dark day for our realm, as the mad cultists of Ferdinand Dawnclaw has managed to not only break through our defenses, but even capture the city of Readewetter. There is chaos in the streets, as the attackers show neither mercy nor restraint, and the people are fleeing in panic."
 chaos.12.a:0 "Smuggle the Grand Duchess out through the sewers, get her out of here!"

 chaos.13.title:0 "Rottendedam has Fallen" #sweet
 chaos.13.desc:0 "The treasonous Ferdinand Dawnclaw has struck from the north and managed to capture the port city of Rottendedam. What news reach us from the city speak of chaos and death, and the audacious attack has proven that the threat from the north is now much greater than it ever was before."
 chaos.13.a:0 "Enjoy your victories while you can, traitors!"

 chaos.14.title:0 "Readewetter has Fallen" #sweet
 chaos.14.desc:0 "The capitol of the Strawberry Duchy burns tonight, as the forces of Ferdinand Dawnclaw struck fast and hard and managed to seize it. The whereabouts of Gabriela Eagleclaw is still unknown, but we may well have to fear the worst."
 chaos.14.a:0 "Enjoy your victories while you can, traitors!"

 chaos.15.title:0 "A Demand for Submission"
 chaos.15.desc:0 "The Most Glorious and Supreme Commander, Warmaster Dawnclaw, hereby submits demand that the government of [TRD.GetName] be disbanded and all state assets, land and population be surrendered and considered true and proper vassals of his. This demand must be satisfied within a short while, as our warriors hunger to sup the blood of the fallen. Our military forces greatly outnumber and outmatch your own, and to resist is merely prolonging suffering. Warmaster Dawnclaw offers that surrendering now will at least preserve some lives, rather than render all those who oppose him as chattel. This notice will not be repeated, nor will this offer of surrender be extended. Sacrifice to Maar awaits those who prevaricate."
 chaos.15.a:0 "We will never surrender"
 chaos.15.b:0 "We cannot survive their assault..surrender it is."

 chaos.16.title:0 "Skyfall Rejects. It is war"
 chaos.16.desc:0 "The bloated idiots in Skyfall have rejected our demands for submission. They have chosen the hard path, and are to be slaughtered like the mewling cattle that they are. Deploy the infantry, send in the Void Knights, but now we must ensure that they are ground into paste, as an example to all others that refusing the Warmaster will lead to death, wrack and ruin. Their pitiful warriors will not stand in our way, nor will their flimsy defenses protect them from our aircraft and ground assaults. Ah, today is a good day to reap some skulls and souls. We must make it last long enough to truly savour the suffering!"
 chaos.16.a:0 "DEATH, DEATH AND SLAUGHTER."

 chaos.17.title:0 "Skyfall submits"
 chaos.17.desc:0 "An official notice of submission has been received from the government of [TRD.GetName] today. It seems that their pathetic politicians could not offer even the most meagre, simple fight for their lives and chose to capitulate like children. Whilst our warriors are surely disappointed at the lack of chance to dig their blades into some foes today, they can be rest assured that the opportunity will present itself in the near future. After all, there are a great many lands around us, and some surely have the faintest flame of a fight in them. The only positive from this is that the lack of slaughter will allow us to gain a better accounting of their resources and assets a lot easier, so that we may distribute them intact rather than piecemeal."
 chaos.17.a:0 "Ah, perhaps the slaughter will be another day."

 chaos.18.title:0 "Whispers in the Dark" #Nurgle
 chaos.18.desc:0 "Despair was a strange thing, and yet he had more and more started to be amused by it. Some fell into despair so easily. As the things they had worked so hard towards fell apart they collapsed, weeping and raging. As they were ravaged by age, by disease, and by injury they resented it, trying to escape the thoughts of their weakness and their upcoming death. And yet it was there all the same, ticking away slowly, slowly.\n\nWhy not simply laugh at it? Trials and tribulations came and went, and why not savour it all? You lived in either case, and what was life if not foetid, twisted and perverse? Wasn't that the key to life, to celebrate the grime in which they all lived instead of the meaningless concept of 'purity'? To fall into despair only to rise from it? The worse things got ,the better they could only get, and the truly broken would be those who were truly blessed, if they only could see it!\n\nHe had found himself smiling more, even laughing, as he saw all the horrors that they wove around them. Oh it was all for a reason of course, but at the same time... there was such a gift in it for those broken and battered griffs he left in his wake, and he so hoped they would learn."
 chaos.18.a:0 "What a blessssssinggg indeeeed..."

 chaos.19.title:0 "The Creeping Darkness" #Dawnclaw unveils his plans for the imperium's destruction
 chaos.19.desc:0 ""My lord.. The republicans and Cloudburians are both broken, and now march beneath your banner." Grim Darktalon kneeled in front of Dawnclaw, having presented him with the head of the last republican leader who had dared to opposed them. "They are coming around to the truth, and will fight when you call them. Give us the order, and we will march on the Herzland."\n\n"Fool," Dawnclaw drawled. Standing in front of the strategic map that covered most of the wall, he stared up at it.  "Had the pathetic wretches of these lands been enough, the republicans would have tried their luck a long time ago. It will not be enough to take on the entirety of the Herzland. Before we strike, we must expand."\n\n"Order us and we will march, my lord. Shall we seize the Vedinan lands of the east?"\n\n"Vedina, the northern tribes, The Sunstriker mountains, anywhere we can go. And also..." he looked at the northern reaches of the Herzland, towards Rottendedam and Readewetter. "If we strike, we will bite off one piece at a time...""
 chaos.19.a:0 "...and slowly choke the Herzland."

 chaos.20.title:0 "Whispers in the Dark" #sweet
 chaos.20.desc:0 "Ferdinand Dawnclaw had never cared for religion. It had always seem like trite moralising meant to deny you the pleasures in life. When you celebrated life with food and drink, some tiresome old priest would come and crow at you about moderation. When you indulged in the pleasures of the flesh you'd be shamed for it. When you sampled the wonders that the flowers and plants of the natural world or the chemicals produced by the brilliant minds of science could produce you were a pathetic addict. Again and again they sought to deny you any pleasure 'for your own good', and what existence was even that? A grey, hollow one bereft of all the things that made life worth living.\n\nWhen he stabbed that miserable little scientist and took his blueprints for himself, Dawnclaw realized he had finally opened a door for himself. He was the master of the rebellion against the corpse in Griffenheim, and he would break that weakling in the end. Why wouldn't he enjoy himself however he could? Was that not what every king and emperor had done, indulge themselves? Did they not live the best life, surrounded by all the wealth and pleasure that life could offer them? Did they not feast and revel in all the pleasures they could? Pleasure was the right of the mighty, and he was unsurpassed, the warmaster who would break all of Griffonia... so why would he not delight in every pleasure he could find?"
 chaos.20.a:0 "Yeeeesssss... you undersssssstand..."

 chaos.21.title:0 "Whispers in the Dark" #sweet
 chaos.21.desc:0 "The esoteric had always had a strange fascination for him. When he entered into the military, this fascination had had to fall by the wayside as politics and military hierarchy had become his world. A straight-laced, pragmatic understanding of the world that recently had become so unbearably stifling. He looked at the troops marshalled under his command, the simpering governors and local leaders desperate to do his bidding, the wealth that he had amassed, and it all felt hollow.\n\nWas this everything there was? This trite marshalling of petty griffs back and forth, these meaningless political chess games, was this where it all culminated? No, there had to be more to everything, and he had recently indulged himself in this old hobby.\n\nYet what he had found was not a hobby, but an obsession. He had diverted more and more resources to gathering lore of the more esoteric kind. Diving into books smuggled out of places like the Dread Peninsula or Barrad, books that would have drawn the ire of church and law both, he found himself sleeping less and less. There would be time for sleep when he was dead, the mad insights of these forbidden books were too compelling to leave aside, and left his mind expanding more and more."
 chaos.21.a:0 "Beyond madnessssss liessss enlightenment."

 chaos.22.title:0 "An Impending Attack"
 chaos.22.desc:0 "An envoy has been received from former Republican lands demanding our submission. It is likely that the festering heartland of the fallen tricolour will increase their demands if we bow down, but there is also a chance that this sudden resurgence may be more than we are able to take care of, and if our soldiers are unable to fend off the enemy, we may be subject to being made a vassal - or worse. It appears that we do not have long to choose, as scouts have reported the raving horde are clearly mobilising and readying to assault us. The time to make a choice is upon us." #Mara
 chaos.22.a:0 "We must resist."
 chaos.22.b:0 "Perhaps submission is better."

 chaos.23.title:0 "Sunstriker Rejects. It is war"
 chaos.23.desc:0 "Our warriors have erupted into rapturous glee, for the foolish idiots in the Sunstriker lands have rejected the Warmaster's demand for submission. Now our great army and airforce may mobilise and crush them under withering might. Let the hounds of slaughter be unleashed, let great poxes and ruin run rampant in their streets, their homes, their hovels. Let all who reside there cry out and wail in misery and desperation. Let them curse and gnash their former leader's names, bemoaning that surrender wasn't given to us. Such glorious slaughter will cause new rivers of blood to run and stain the land forever in Maar's name."
 chaos.23.a:0 "Today is a good day for them to die."

 chaos.24.title:0 "Sunstriker submits"
 chaos.24.desc:0 "The Warmaster's influence grows, and his merciless reputation has preceeded him. Our demand for submission to the bandits has been agreed to. Indeed, they were most pathetic and grovelled for their lives. Some tried to position themselves above others, to argue that they should retain their places of responsibility as a form of liason or go-between. How utterly naive they are to think that they have any place other than slaves when placed before the Warmaster and Maar's glory." #Mara
 chaos.24.a:0 "More meat for the grinder."

 chaos.25.title:0 "The Other Lord of Chaos"
 chaos.25.desc:0 ""I already told you, I'm not getting involved."\n\n"But you're the Lord of Chaos!"\n\nBefore the lounging draconequus stood a bloodstained, spike-wearing griffon. Said griffon's beak was agape with shock, as he had been trying for hours to convince Discord to aid in Dawnclaw's cause.\n\n"Please! I've come all this way! As a humble servant of Dawnclaw's Chaos, I beseech-"\n\n"Oh please, you wouldn't know Chaos even if the developers programmed you to."\n\n"I... what does that even mean?!"\n\n"Precisely," chuckled Discord.\n\nThe griffon merely stared dumbfounded at Discord, who had begun to juggle his eyeballs out of boredom. "But... you have to! It is in your nature to-"\n\nWith a snap of his claw, Discord vanished and reappeared towering over the bloody griffon. "Let me make this clear: I'm not a pawn in your little game, or anyone else's for that matter. The reason I am saying this is so that you will stop asking. Now run along and tell your Warmaster, and especially Maar, that I don't work for cheap knockoffs."\n\nWith another snap of the draconequus' claw, the griffon found himself back in Cloudbury."
 chaos.25.a:0 "Well, we tried."

 chaos.26.title:0 "Whispers in the Dark" #Khorne
 chaos.26.desc:0 "The Empire had been built upon strength, and it had been maintained by the same. Grover I had gone to war, and crushed any and all that stood against him. His son had done the same, only to be crushed by the strength of the Riverponies in the east. The most intricate and overcomplicated systems could be reduced to nothing by brute force. Was that not what he had done here? He had crushed the bickering republican weaklings and reforged them with one promise; strength and violence.\n\nThe more time had gone on, the more Dawnclaw had found himself revolted on a deep personal level by the corpse emperor: a weakling in life suddenly endowed with divine powers and now pretending to be strong. HE was the one who had remained strong when the Mist came, HE was the one who had kept the military together, and the corpse had known that. That was why he had been denied the Star Knight enhancements, and shuffled off to be irrelevant. No matter how many fancy words you threw on it, the weak feared the strong, and would do anything to undermine them. \n\nHe was so achingly eager to go to war with the corpse-emperor, to throw him down from his throne and crush him like the bug he was. All their forces would be marshalled against each other, and they would hurl themselves into a battle unlike any other. Blood would flow in rivers, the corpses would pile up in mountains, and in the end only the strong would remain. He would remain!"
 chaos.26.a:0 "Sssstrength isssss all that matterssssssss."

 chaos.27.title:0 "Blood for the Dark God" 
 chaos.27.desc:0 "'KILL.' The pounding fury raged in him as he charged towards the enemy. His bolzengewehr was long since thrown to the side, only a long, jagged knife in one claw. Bullets clanged uselessly against his armour as he saw the whites in the eyes of his enemies - nay prey. They screamed something but he didn't care, he wanted blood, blood, BLOOD!\n\n'KILL.' Leaping through the air with the speed of a tiger and the fury of a hurricane, he landed claws first against one of them and smashed him against the rocks they had been hiding amongst. A sickening crack echoed through the air, making his entire body shiver with delight as he looked towards the others and pounced. One of them tried to attack him with a bayonet only to have their throat slit with one swing of his jagged blade. Grabbing the soldier and violently tossing him aside, he dove for the others.\n\n'KILL... KILL... KILL' Screams and the clash of steel filled the air, soon joined by the smell of gore. Soldier after soldier died, some fighting, some backing away, some pleading. He didn't care, they all died the same! Yet when a grenade went off right behind him he was left thrown to the side, dazed for a second as he saw a couple last stragglers try to use the confusion to get away.\n\n'KILLKILLKILLKILLKILLKILL!' He simply leaped at them, even his knife discarded now as he tore them to pieces with his bare claws. The blood and death around him just kept whipping him into a frenzy from which he never wanted to wake up. Nothing mattered. Not the past, not the future, not whatever he was fighting for."
 chaos.27.a:0 "All that mattered was the blood"

 chaos.28.title:0 "Out of Every Dark Pit"
 chaos.28.desc:0 "Darkness never went away. It didn't matter how bright the light was, it would only cause even darker shadows to be cast. Maybe the light source would be free from it, but in the fringes, far away? Oh there were shadows aplenty there. As his forces marched victoriously across the north, more and more of these shadows were coming out of their hidey-holes, shadows of a kind that you usually only whispered about.\n\nBlack Knights from Vedina, long since disillusioned with the hollow notions of 'chivalry' and now dedicated to the only thing that mattered; strength. Witches that had hidden in the far fringes of the Northern Tribes, where their arts had made them hated by pony and griffon both, but who gladly cast their vile spells for the Heresy. Cultists of any number of strange and twisted sects that had found refuge in the sunstriker mountains - some of who had even whispered in the eye of the infamous Eriviar Sunstriker.\n\nOn their own they were each little more than filth, insignificant gnats whom he easily could have crushed, but taken together they were worthy to march under his banners. Their shadows only added to the darkness that grew in the north, the darkness that soon would spill out and blanket all of Griffonia. Every pit and every crevice held long forgotten darkness, and when it reached its climax..."
 chaos.28.a:0 "...the light would be extinguished forever"

 chaos.29.title:0 "A new entrant into the Heresy"
 chaos.29.desc:0 "Upon hearing of our recent ascendancy, a hidden maarite from the distant land of Abyssinia has crossed the ocean to join us. While not quite as viscious or brutal as the fodder we've already armed, a dark, sinister energy eminates from him, making his power obvious to those with a connection to Maar. "
 chaos.29.a:0 "He'll fit right in with the rest."

 FAT_coastal_defense_turhamn_desc:0 "The coast of Turhamn is a potential target for invasion which we must fortify. It is not that we do not wish to fight; far from it. However, allowing an assault to come that we are not prepared for is foolish and a waste of resources."

 FAT_warmaster_dawnclaw_desc:0 "Ferdinand Dawnclaw was never someone who would accept being denied what he felt entitled to. When the Emperor seemingly died, he had hoped to use the remnants of the Imperial Army to carve out his own realm. His quick return to the Emperor's side was driven by a will to ingratiate himself with what he could tell was a force without equal. And yet he was still snubbed, seeing the imperial army become secondary to the Star Knights and being denied the honor of becoming one himself.\n\nAttacking the Archrector Dominus and seizing the formula himself along with a group of traitorous Star Knights, Dawnclaw fled north to use the formula on himself before seizing control over the republican army in the north. With it, he plans to contest the emperor and carve out the realm he deserves.\n\nWithout the careful precision of the Archrector however, his use of the formula has given him result perhaps, but it has left a toll on his already fraying sanity. Whispers in the dark are calling to him, beckoning him to sink deeper and deeper into brutal depravity, offering power in return.\n\nSome slide slowly into darkness, Ferdinand Dawnclaw leaped head first into it, and the world will burn in his wake."

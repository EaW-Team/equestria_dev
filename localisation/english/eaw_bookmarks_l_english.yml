 #GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A new era has dawned. Fear and uncertainty spreads amongst ponies as the world around them changes rapidly in front of their very eyes. Equestrian leadership is concerned about their neighbours, Stalliongrad and Changelings alike. While the communists in Stalliongrad rapidly industrialise, Queen Chrysalis has managed to centralise her realm around her. Equestria, while concerned about these developments, faces plenty of internal conflicts and problems. A storm is brewing in Equestria, one that friendship alone might not be able to tame."# moved to replace folder

 EQS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Equestria has lived in Harmony for over a millennium under the guidance of Princess Celestia. The nation has faced many minor threats in the recent past, and has prevailed with the power of friendship and forgiveness. However, circumstances seem to be changing, as Equestria's enemies have roused themselves and are now a credible threat. The peace-loving nation of ponies now finds itself in a new world with foes at their borders, but also among their numbers. How will Equestria approach the troubling times ahead, and will Friendship and Harmony still be its mantra?"
 CHN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Not too long ago, Queen Chrysalis and her Changelings launched a daring invasion to take over Equestria and its capital of Canterlot. Fortunately for the Equestrians, it was met with disaster. This defeat only intensified the Changelings' hatred of ponies. Using this anger, Chrysalis has successfully gathered near-universal support for her cause, and unified all of the hives to her rule alone. Under her reign, the army has seen radical and rapid modernisation with the introduction of modern firearms, vehicles and tactics. The time is ripe for a new war, and this time the Changelings may finally achieve their ultimate victory over their enemies."
 DED_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Dread League has brought fear into the hearts of the Arcturian Order for hundreds of years, but few outside of it remember the existence of this far away realm filled with the living dead and the practitioners of the dark arts. The Dark Mages of Magehold have recently found some 'interesting' literature in the depth of the ancient fortress, and these became the center of a sort of... 'cultural rebirth' for the League.\n\nSoon, the World will remember the Dark Realm of the North. And soon, they will see its Truth."
 STG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Soviet Republic of Stalliongrad, comprising of the Equestrian north-east provinces, had only recently split off from Equestria and the Crystal Empire in the hopes of forming a new society in which all ponies are equal. Unfortunately the Stalliongrad of today is far from the what had been envisioned in its founding. Rapid industrialisation has failed, and food has become scarce. With Equestrian sanctions, the threat of famine is very real. The ruling Communist Party, crippled by a leadership crisis, is incapable. Only after the following election, once the party has a clear leader, will Stalliongrad be able to face the oncoming storm."
 OLE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Home of the deer, the Kingdom of Olenia is an old nation. It had long been the leading trading power in its region, but in recent times political instability and corruption have caused plenty of problems. The lower classes of society suffer the most and unrest is spreading quickly. The situation had only gotten worse following the rise of King Johan 'Djävulen', an unlawful and incredibly corrupt leader. The current rightful heir to the throne, Queen Velvet, has drawn up plans to retake the throne, but requires help to do so. Will the Equestrians help the Queen in need? Will the fires of revolution engulf the streets of Hjortland? Will the deer survive the changeling threat to the north?"
 CRY_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Crystal Empire is a new nation in the world stage. Long ago, it had disappeared following the defeat of the evil tyrant, King Sombra, who had cast a curse on it. The Empire reappeared only recently, as did Sombra, but it was ultimately freed with aid from Equestria. Now under the rule of the Equestrian princess, Mi Amore Cadenza, many wonder how the Crystal Empire will proceed in these troubled times. Will the Crystal Ponies stay loyal to Equestria, or will darkness return once more?"
 YAK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The proud race of the yaks have always made it a priority to keep their traditions alive. Due to this, they have never shared much interest in politics, whether that be foreign and domestic. However, young Prince Rutherford recently ended their long isolation and befriended Equestria, which dissatisfied the traditionalist jaks of the Jaki-Clan. They abandoned him and instead supported his brother Prince Bradford who now leads the rebellious jaks and wishes to seize the kingdom for himself. The divided yaks must unite before it is too late, for a blizzard forms in the dark horizon. Will their Way of Life endure, or will this new age bring along a new reign?"

 GRF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the collapse of the griffon's ancient Empire nearly 30 years ago Nova Griffonia has found itself independent for the first time after 200 years. However due to Nova Griffonia's over-reliance on Imperial industrial goods and military protection she has found herself suffering heavily in the recent years. Her armies are comprised of militias barely held together by their commanders, the economy has practically collapsed, to top it off the many dissidents the old Empire sent to her shores have become more active and violent than ever. The only thing keeping the country together is Governor Teafeather's sheer force of will, but no one lives forever..."
 GFF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Although an unrecognised state by everyone but Nova Griffonia, the Griffon Frontier enjoys some amount of autonomy from its master. The country is far from content, however, as its virtually non existent budget is unable to fund its industry, army or infrastructure. And now, like all the years before, it is about time for Governor Muck to visit Weter, the capital of Nova Griffonia, and ask for funds once more. He would better return with good news, as he has many enemies back at home who would love to take his place..."

 WNG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "30 years ago, Wingbardy seceded from the Empire and took the whole south with it. The King promised them a future of continued economic growth and prosperity. This couldn't have been further from the truth.\nOnce the richest lands in the Empire, Wingbardy now sees itself in crisis. The ailing economy, failed parliament after parliament and a costly war with Falcor has lead to the rapid growth of political extremism. Fascists under Guiliou Beakolini prepare to march on Karthin and seize power from the failed government, while the anti-fascists prepare to oppose them. But the King still holds all the cards in his talons..."
 GRI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Griffonian Empire, once stretching across most of the continent, has long been known as "The sick Bird of Griffonia". Revolution and corruption took hold of the empire and its vast lands, breaking it apart one by one. Today, the Empire is left with nothing but a fraction of its territory, filled with dissatisfied nobles and commoners. The current Emperor, Grover V, is not expected to have long left until death claims his life. With his only heir to the throne being underage, the Empire is soon to face crisis once more. Will the Empire survive this new age? Or will internal conflict shatter it once and for all? Or perhaps the former glory of the Empire can be restored..."
 AET_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The County of Greifwald has for long been a nation that has mastered the art of balancing between many powers on the griffon continent, as it's located directly in the middle between the Kingdom of Aquileia and The Griffonian Empire. The current establishment of Greifwald has ruled for long already, but the County is troubled by many problems. It's citizens are poor, it's army and industry greatly obsolete. And while the current regime tries it's best to keep everything stable, there exists a small but hardworking anarchistic party there, that could pose a great threat to the government. But more worryingly, there are whispers in the dark of Prelate Ebonwing's great ambitions and plans..."
 JER_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Aquileia is one of the oldest nations on the Griffonian continent. It was around when the Empire was unified for the first time, and it was also one of the first nations who left it. But after that happened, Aquileia itself suffered a coup where it was transformed into a republic, but just like with the Empire, it didn't last. However, the republic burns bright in the memory of the griffons. And that isn't the only problem Aquileia faces, as ever since Aquileia left the Empire, it has been a sort of rival to it, and if the Empire ever tries to revitalise itself, Aquileia would be the first barrier in their way. But would Aquileia be strong enough to face them?"
 GRW_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Griffon Liberation Army movement was born in the Kingdom of Brodfeld. Sparked by brutality of the king the revolutionary spirit of the griffons of Prywhen inspired an organisation of the resistance against the bourgeoisie. It managed to capture the popular support of peasants and workers throughout the country. For two years a devastating civil war is going on, more characterised by guerrilla warfare and raids than a full-scale war. But now the peasants and the proletariat have picked themselves up to make the final push into the royalists' nest of vipers. From there on, Prywhen will finally have a chance to decide their own destiny."
 MNC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Eriviar and his Sunstriker Bandits have ruled the Whitetail Mountains for years, becoming rich off raiding and pillaging their pony and griffon neighbours. Having become such an issue, the Emperor was forced to deal with them himself. The Emperor and Eriviar thus struck a pact in which the Bandits would receive weapons, griffonpower and funding from the former in exchange for swearing fealty to the Empire and keeping the Republicans and the Ponies busy. However, many political dissidents and opponents have used this opportunity and moved into Whitetail. A clash between these forces might be unavoidable."
 FAT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Griffonian Republic was born in the chaotic year of 978, when anger at the corrupt and debauched regency council boiled into outright revolution. Rallying behind marshal Alexander Kemerskai, it soon assumed power over the Imperial City, though after a short and bloody struggle with the Emperor's supporters the new Republican regime was crushed and driven north to the former Duchy of Cloudbury. Although beset by intra-party conflict and a chaotic countryside ravaged by warlords, all hope for the Republic is not yet lost. Liberty, prosperity, and democracy shall come to Griffonia once more!"
 HLR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Arcturian Order is an ancient holy order founded around the faith and ideals of the Twelve Temples dedicated to the sanctity of The Holy Light. The Arcturian Order was created for the sole purpose of protecting the living from the foul denizens from the east. Ever since that fateful day nine hundred years ago, they have done their job. Recent years have written a different story however, as something is amiss in the Dread Peninsula. Border raids have increased in frequency and unicorns in the Order have felt dark energies accumulate beyond the borders. The Twelve Temples believe themselves ready to weather the storm. The question is though, are they really ready for this?"
 BAN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Blackrock Bandits are criminals and mercenaries that have formed together to ransack villages, pillage farms and rob unsuspecting enemies. At the top of the bandit food chain stands Blackrock herself. But not all is sunshine and flowers within the Bandit Queendom of Blackrock. To the east, there is a new communist power emerging in Prywhen. To the southwest, Wingbardy is gathering power and could strike towards Blackrock at a moment's notice. And if the Empire to the north ever manages to re-emerge as the great power it once was... then this might be the early death of the Blackrock Bandits. But bandits do not cry or shiver, for they fight on 'til the bitter end!"
 FAL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Ravaged by a devastating war that ended nearly two decades ago, Falcor lies in a precarious position nested between other great powers. The ruling Princess and her husband do their best to placate an angry populace, but the desire for revenge against the hated Wingbardians trumps all reason and logic. With meager resources and little potential allies, the griffons of Falcor will need to provide an exceptional effort if they wish to see their nation survive the looming storm."
 ARA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The small Barony of Arantiga is home to a rich history. It was the birthplace of an ancient empire which stretched most of Griffonia. Led by Arantigos Featherin, the Arantigans ruled much of the world. However, the Empire collapsed and the Barony is all that's left. It has managed to weather the economic hardship of the Groverian Empire's collapse by tying itself to Wingbardy, but with the southern Kingdom now failing itself, Arantiga must decide if it should remain dependent on the south. Politically, some want to reform the barony into a normal state, based on ideology. However, Dorotheos, a promising general and descendant of the great Featherin, dreams to recreate the ancient Empire."
 FRE_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Nestled among the mountains of South East Griffonia, the Ponies of the Long House live simple lives of peace and harmony. An alliance of many small pony Clanns and holy monasteries, Pònaidhean has little interest in the outside world, but the newly elected Crimson nic Heart sees storm clouds gathering over Griffonia.\n\nWith an uncertain future, Pònaidhean must modernise or be left behind. But Pònaidhean and Crimson knows that any change risks upsetting the supernatural forces that also call their hills home."
 LCT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The frontline against the Griffons, Lake City has always had a tumultuous history. Lake City was once the capital of a united River Lands, however years of internal unrest and griffon attacks have worn down the great city to a battle-hardened and bitter nation. But all is not well within the nation. Grand Mayor Springtime Frost took power after his predecessor was assassinated by disgruntled army officers, yet another victim of the division that runs deep through Lakeish society. With the upcoming elections, the ponies of Lake City hope it will be a time for change, but there are those who see the elections as an opportunity to further their own goals."
 NCH_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Greneclyf is a harmonious land of changelings, led by Queen Gytha of Clann Leamhan. The latest of an 800-years-old dynasty, Gytha has adhered to the old philosophies adopted since the times of the First Sharing. These have ensured a peaceful, if monotonous rule.\n\nBut there is change in the air, and the Queen can sense it approaching fast. Her people are ill-prepared for the oncoming storm, and Greneclyf is in need of new relationships with the continentals. The ponies of the River Coalition should be good allies, but having never met changelings before, Greneclyf must put its best hoof forward..."
 WIT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "An ancient Kingdom of unicorns and magic, Wittenland is proud of its meritocratic tradition, where the monarch is selected by a magical duel and not inheritance. Yet over the centuries the Kingdom stagnated and became a mere shadow of its former self, its mighty mage-nobles content to live in their mountain castles. But times are changing, and Wittenland must change as well. Everypony has different ideas on how exactly it should change, so the reigning Queen and reformer, White Star, must navigate the perilous intrigues of Wittenlandic politics if she hopes to save her nation from ruin."
 NIM_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since ancient times, Nimbusia has been a democracy ruled by a pegasus warrior class. These stalwart ponies are some of the best trained soldiers in Griffonia, but require a large class of helots to produce for them. The democratic nation has reached turbulent time. Split between those who seek reform, those who want to abolish democracy and those who defend tradition. A smart and wellspoken politician will be able to take advantage of the situation to win over the hearts of the Nimbusians."
 DMT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The vaults of the King of Diamond Mountain are empty, having been robbed clean by griffon knights. The nation of dogs must rebuild, so that King Rover Diamondshield can seek revenge against the thieves. However, trouble is brewing in the underground as slaves seek to revolt. How the dogs of Diamond Mountain deal with this unrest might change their society forever..."
 LUS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The griffons of Lushi have long held on to their backwards ways. The country is divided between powerful lords, who rule over their serfs. These serfs are still tied to their land and largely uneducated. However, the young prince, Elias, seeks to reform the principality by dealing with the lords and setting the serfs free. But his brother Gerar has other plans for the nation, if he can come to power..."
 HLQ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Stalwart defenders of the eastern frontier, the knights of Hellquill have stood long as the Empire's protectors against the Riverpony incursions. But these oaths broke after the Empire's collapse 30 years ago, and now the Hellquillians stand independent, closely tied to their allies in Longsword. The current Grand Master of the Order is old and set to retire soon, and with it, change might come to Hellquill, for the better or worse..."
 LNS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "A staunch ally of Hellquill, the small County of Longsword has weathered many assaults from the Riverponies, but they've stood together against the tide, as battle brothers in their separate Knightly Orders. But since they've gained their independence from the Empire, Longsword has enjoyed relative stability until Count Pallas Dusktalon invited members of the Reformisten, a radical group from Hellquill, for assistance against the ponies. Slowly, they've gained power across the entire nation, and now they've begun the cleansing of Longswordian lands from anyone deemed impure, especially ponies..."
 RCT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Grand Princess Soft Water was the last monarch of Rijekograd. She had no heir and wished to avoid a succession crisis, so she granted all her powers to a democratic parliament. After her death in 814, Rijekograd became the River Republic. Since then the nation has enjoyed an age of peace and prosperity: It was the founder of the Coalition and became a trading hub of the Riverlands, protected by mountains on all sides. In 1001 a young unicorn named River Swirl became Chancellor. During her first term she modernized the Republic, making it into the most developed member of the Coalition. However, growth comes with a price, and socialists led by Nova Whirl are quickly gaining strength..."
 BRF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of Brodfeld is a young nation whose recent history is full of suffering. From the Great Famine of 995 to the present civil war against communist revolutionaries, griffons of Prywhen have endured much hardship. Some seek salvation from the King and the Gods that aid him while others hope for reforms that will turn the Kingdom into a constitutional monarchy, yet both fight together against the Red Menace that seeks to undo all that they hold dear. Only if they are victorious can they have any hope of seeing their country rise from the ashes like a golden Phoenix."
 SRS_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In the frigid, snowy tundras of the Griffonian far north, the Socialist Republic of Skynavia stands as a shaky bastion of egalitarianism, liberty, and socialism in a world that grows darker by the day. Created upon stolen pony territory by exiled socialists in the aftermath of the failed First Griffonian Revolution, the Socialist Republic must strive to maintain their hard-fought freedoms and liberties at home, whilst protecting the dream of a socialist Pan-Griffonia from the forces of reaction that surround and threaten the Republic on every front. Will the Republic finally achieve their utopian ideals in the years to come, or will it crumble under pressure from within and without?"
 VED_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Vedina is a nation with a hard-fought independence, having long kept both Imperial influence and revolutionaries at bay through careful political maneuvering. Its famous knightly institutions that have been a part of Vedina since it's birth have always been ready to defend the borders of their Kingdom. But problems arise as a succession crisis pokes its head into Vedina. King Wingstrom's daughter is not fully ready to rule and she must prove herself if she wishes to become the Queen of Vedina. But what type of Queen will she be? That remains to be seen."
 GRU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "It has not been long since the free towns of Gryphus regained their golden liberty from the despotic Empire, but already internal strife threatens the country and its treasured freedom. Both fanatical knights from Herzland and a Sicameonese merchant company strive to gain more power, caring little for the desires of the towns themselves. Something must be done soon, ere prized liberty is once again lost..."
 CYA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Once loyal servants of the Empire, Cyanolisia is now stranded, its duty of keeping the minotaurs in check inside and outside their borders growing more difficult each day. The Countess is confident her loyal soldiers will not give up, even as conspiracy spreads among their ranks. Across the gulf, revanchist Asterion gears for war, and Cyanolisia must do everything it can to prepare."
 MIT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The minotaurs of Asterion have grown tired of serving under despots and tyrants and have broken their shackles. Yet the Restoration War failed to claim the mainland, where hundreds of thousands of minotaurs still suffer. Decades have passed since the war and some have turned to more radical ideas as an unusual coalition forms between fascists and communists, yet all minotaurs still agree on one thing: Death to monarchists!"
 SIC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The federation of Sicameon is a country of free griffons, with not a single noble or knight in sight. Nevertheless they have managed to found a stable and prosperous nation, with solid democratic foundations. But they are militarily weak, and as a tropical storm gathers, everyone in Sicameon knows something must be done. But what exactly? No agreement has been made so far, and it must be done soon as elections slowly approach."
 
 STW_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Strawberry Duchy is a place of wine and culture to much of the Griffonian elite, and its ruling family has long been second only to the Imperial lineage of the Grovers. It is the fiefdom of Duchess Gabriela Eagleclaw, and was one of the great champions of the empire during the revolution. Still, not all is well in the Duchy in these days. The Duchess has spent more and more time away from her fiefdom to be in Griffenheim, and some among her subjects wonder if she's forgotten about them. Maybe the time has come for Strawberry to assert itself beyond the duchess' reach? Or maybe dark clouds will gather and Strawberry once again will rise to be the bastion of loyalty it always has been?"
 ANG_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Angriver, located in the vast Scheißwald Forest, has always been one of the poorest and most backward regions in the Empire. The dense forest provides refuge for monsters and bandits, as well as impeding development in the region. During the Revolution of 978, Baron Leer remained in control thanks to the support of Großmarschall Stoiber, but since then the two have grown distant, with Stoiber coming to disdain Leer's cruelty. Today, the Baron's grip over his land is threatened by Republican remnants, Anarchist rebels, and other shadowy conspirators. With so many groups straddling for power, Angriver's path forward is far from certain."
 PYT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The farmlands of Greifenmarschen were once ruled by a despotic Duke, who was overthrown by the local peasants. Because he had been Emperor Grover I's enemy, they were rewarded with autonomy as long as they remained loyal to the Empire. Thus the Peasants' Republic was born and has continued to exist to this day without much change. A direct democracy with elections every 3 months and referendums held on everything possible, it is highly democratic but also cumbersome. Yet so far, Greifenmarschen has had no need to rapidly change or adapt and has remained content in its rural paradise. That will soon change. Permanently."
 BRZ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "It is said that the only beings the emperor can trust are the dogs of Bronzehill. In 792, Emperor Grover II granted the Bronze Mountains to a group of ex-slaves fleeing Diamond Mountain. Since then the County of Bronzehill has grown and prospered as a loyal subject of the Empire. The dogs of Bronzehill are peaceful, hardworking, and freedom-loving. While they are still Loyal to the Emperor, there are many who now recognise that powerful griffons have been exploiting them. The Collapse of the Empire and the republican uprisings of 978 have further shaken their world view. With dark clouds looming, the hounds of Bronzehill are anxious for what the future might hold."
 KAT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Though situated nearly in the empire's backyard, Katerin is a place struggling to stay afloat in the modern era. What blessings they once had were undone by two great ills. First was the revolution of 978 that saw nearly all of the ruling von Katerinburg family killed as well as much of the city of Katerinburg destroyed, and second was the sole surviving heir to the throne, the crazed Diellza von Katerinburg, whose capricious and brutal reign has left the nation teetering on the brink. Will Katerin rise above its dark past, or will it be choked under the iron claw of its mad princess?"
 YAL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Yale is a nominal vassal of the Griffonian Empire. Having served as the academic centre of the Empire for generations, with Yale's Rectors eventually taking over the nation. However, as the Griffonian Empire declined over recent years, friction has emerged in the Yale Rectorate. Yale lacks a strong national identity and with the Emperor sicklier than ever, societal divides are deepening. The country's leader, Rector Mikusian, seeks to lead a moderate course, while revolutionary and reactionary universities try to mobilise the discontent in Yalish society for their own purposes. Will the light of Yale shine bright in the darkness, or will it be snuffed out like so many places of learning before it?"
 FEA_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Troubling times have come to the Duchy of Feathisia. Currently ruled by Duke Gerlach IV, who brought about constitutional reforms and prosperity to the nation, disaster hit with the collapse of the great Griffonian Empire and the war that followed. The final blow was struck when Skyfall drove the Feathisian companies out of their markets, leaving the economy in shambles. With poverty rising throughout the country and confidence in the status quo at an all time low, radical socialist and nationalist groups have been gaining power in the turmoil. Can the situation be returned to normal, and Feathisia remain the nation it is? Or will drastic measures need to be taken?"
 ROU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The city of Romau has for the longest time been an area of political neutrality. As the last remaining Imperial Free City, Romau enjoys greater amounts of economic freedom and military protection than other vassals of the Griffonian Empire. This has caused the City to also become quite dependent on the Empire, however, and its political structure might not survive any further troubles in their main investor and protector. Dark times loom over the Empire, and its fate could very well become the fate of small, little Romau."
 TRD_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In the Trade Federation of Skyfall, the wealthy dominate and pay little heed to the Empire, their former overlord. Its ruler, Iron Chancellor Guichard, has ruled the federation since its foundation, having driven out the Imperial garrison and seized the Imperial Navy. But Guichard is an old griffon, and it is clear he doesn't have much longer to live. The oligarchs see their chance to succeed him, the oppressed workers prepare of revolution, his young niece dreams of democracy, and in the shadows others conspire with the Archons of Griffenheim..."
 FEZ_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Like neighbouring Skyfall, Fezera is a prosperous trade port in western Griffonia and birthplace of the iconic Griffonian Fez. However, unlike its rich and famous neighbour, its choice of independence during the Griffonian Revolution didn't produce a golden age. Rather, the city decayed, mired in political turmoil and mobster activities from the penose with only the tireless Fezeraanse Politie preventing total chaos. But one griff rose to the occasion, the Skyfall-born Gwenaël Godard. Following a tumultuous election, he promised to restore Fezera to greatness. Of course, he has absolutely no ties to the smugglers and penose himself despite what some in the Politie claim."
 FLO_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The small but immensely wealthy city of Flowena has managed to secure its independence from both Aquileia and the Empire. Rich bank-owning patricians rule the city with little regard to the common workers, choosing the mayor from amongst themselves. The current mayor, in fact, does very little ruling and a great amount of partying. But recently something has changed about him. He now has greater ambitions, and plans to reveal them to his fellow citizens soon..."
 AVI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "House Avian was once part of the much larger Duchy of Verenia. Its rule was relatively prosperous despite linguistic issues. However the Griffonian Revolution devastated Verenia, leaving many of its members dead and leading to a succession crisis between the House Eyrie and Erie branches of the Duchy. Lady Katrina Avian chose to stay out of the conflict and broke off with what is now known as House Avian. Unfournately this left the succession crisis in a stalemate and the linguistic divide only grew deeper. Will House Avian manage to unite the divided realam and survive through the upcoming storms? Or will it remain a footnote of history in the rise of some greater realm?"
 HAU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Haukland is one of the numerous splinter-states born out of the Griffonian Empire's collapse. Lead by the eccentric flying ace Hermann Meyer, it stands at the Crossroad between Griffonia and Equus and has become a hotbed of piracy, pirates with air-support no less. Despite his status as a warlord, Meyer rules the nation as a benevolent dictator, content to let people be as long as they don't interfere with his authority and allow him his antics. For years, he has let Haukland go with the flow, secure and thriving in its unique and rudimentary way but now, he seems bored with the status quo. And the Hauklandish know that Meyer is never as dangerous and unpredictable as when he is bored."
 LAK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The tiny island Barony of Rumare is considered by many to be a paradise rich with history, having avoided the devastation wrought by the collapse of the Empire. But the culture and language of the locals may soon become part of that history, becoming a fading memory as the Herzlandish culture overtakes them. The new Baron, Alaric, a former mercenary who has returned to his home to succeed his late father, is determined to save his dying heritage before it is too late and restore his nation to its former glory. Rumare am byth!"
 NCR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "War. War never changes.\n\nA world untouched by the horrors that had befallen the Earth. A true paradise. That is what Equestria is to the NCR. The portal that links these two worlds was only recently discovered but the NCR was quick to seize upon securing this land. Now, the NCR Expedition is a prized jewel in a republic that spans two worlds. But their arrival isn't welcomed by all. Blood was spilt for this land and many strange new ideas come with the travelers through the gate."
 
 BAK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Along the northeastern shore of Griffonia, the ponies of Bakara sail the seas, trading with their neighbours and collecting the ocean's bounty as they have for countless generations. Beyond taking pride in their mastery of the waves, Bakarans are proud of their ancestral homeland for being one of the oldest Republics in the world, standing as a beacon for democracy and justice. However, this year's upcoming election has become highly contentious, with the campaign already having seen unprecedented levels of political violence. Will Bakara stay on its course, or is it time to break from the past and forge a new order for the Riverlands?"
 BAR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The cursed land of Barrad is ruled over by Ambrosius, a pony fattened by decadence and luxury, but who tired of such conventional extravagance and turned to dark magic to sate his curiosity. After a horrific and inexplicable cataclysm ravaged Barrad, there were none able to challenge the rule of the self-proclaimed Count Ambrosius, and now the Mad Count torments his subjects for his own entertainment, aided by four ambitious travelers tempted by his offers of power and forbidden knowledge. Together they form the Pentarchy, and they conduct their research and experimentation with no ethical strings attached."
 OLV_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Austurland lies in the eastern reaches of Griffonia, and holds the distinction of being the only deer majority country on the continent. A land of berserkers and Vikings, Austurland has remained at an effectively feudal state for centuries. But such a situation cannot last forever, and dire reform is needed if Austurland hopes to become anything more than a rump state on the edges of the continent. The ascension of the new Jarl, Ygritte, has brought an opportunity for reform, but her personality and background remain a mystery."
 ZES_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Born out of a slave revolt, the Kása Free State has existed on the shores of southeastern Griffonia for nearly a century. Ready to defend their hard-won liberty hoof and tooth, Kása has stood as a haven for Wittenlandic serfs, Austurlandic thralls and Gryphussian indentured servants alike. With its venerable leader, Mansu Erba, growing old, the question has risen of who will take charge of this sanctuary state when she no longer is there for it. Can the beacon of freedom keep shining, or will it be extinguished in the darkness of the coming age?"
 
 FRN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The County of Francistria has always found itself between two spheres of influence, those of Aquileia and Wingbardy. Founded by a member of the Discret dynasty, the nation has nevertheless formed close ties with the Karthinian Pact. After the fall of the Empire, Francistria took advantage of the alliance and the Aquileian revolution to seize Tarrin, a land they had claimed for a long time. But after the Falcor War everything went downhill. The Count died and his heir became a puppet of the nobility, Wingbardy is in crisis and Tarrinians resist the occupation fiercely. Can the small nation survive these dark times, or will it be swallowed up by greater powers?"
 TAL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Since time immemorial, the Talousians have been safeguarded by their mountains, which have kept out countless invaders and foreign influences. When Wingbardy seceded, Talouse was quick to join them, and the Karthinian Pact seemed to promise endless prosperity. However, the Falcor War, and its fallout, shattered that belief. The economy, once one of the most prosperous in Griffonia, is now in a seemingly endless decline, and the population grows more radical by the day, as both the socialists and the Fetivolists clamor for their attention. As the situation grows ever more out of control, will Talouse manage to come out of hiding and face the world, or will it perish from its cowardice?"

NVA_BEGIN:0 "South Of Mellifluve"
NVA_BEGIN_desc:0 "In the southern land the Vermillion Dynasty failed to conquer, there lived a hundred tribes and city-states. Even as their nations faced repeated destruction and reconstruction over numerous invasions, the creatures of the South persisted in resistance, where their identity was born."

NVA_INTRO:0 "The Crown Of Lotus"
NVA_INTRO_desc:0 "As the capital of Sen Kinh and the most powerful city-state among the Zaikirians, Lotus once led the ancient Kingdom of Baiyan. Even now, long after the fall of Baiyan, Lotus's pervasive influence continues to assert dominance over Sen Kinh. The Lotus King rules the kingdom on his throne, for now, and perhaps, forever."

NVA_politicy_intro:0 "Political Upheavals"
NVA_politicy_intro_desc:0 "With the new millennium, the political situation of the kingdom has changed. With the newly crowned King Rankin displaying a lack of care for actual governance, various factions have begun to move. Power struggles, endless bribes and damaged administration systems might push Sen Kinh off the deep end."

NVA_milita_economoy_intro:0 "The Paused Industrialization"
NVA_milita_economoy_intro_desc:0 "Sen Kinh had started its industrialization by accepting those intellectuals and capitalists who escaped from Kiria and its Silence. Unfortunately, the issues of land enclosure as well as a severe lack of resources has torpedoed the kingdom's efforts."

NVA_culture_intro:0 "A Multinational State"
NVA_culture_intro_desc:0 "Throughout the reign of the Kingdom of Baiyan and its successor state of Sen Kinh, diverse ethnicities and pluralism consistently characterized the fabric of society here. On one hoof, this diversity can greatly boost the nation's development; on the other hoof, it can also be a potential threat to stability."

NVA_delegate_from_vermilion:0 "A Dying Kingdom"
NVA_delegate_from_vermilion_desc:0 "The nation is on the edge of being torn apart by political turmoil, economic downturns, and cultural conflicts. We must find a way to save our country from the endless chaos before it's too late."

NVA_choose_path:0 "First Meeting Of The New Year"
NVA_choose_path_desc:0 "It is the royal court's first meeting, or perhaps the last meeting of the new year. The King and the Council of The Wise must decide a path for Sen Kinh, no matter if it leads to glory or tragedy. With all our hope, Sen Kinh lives!"


### National Focuses section 2 Blossom Harmony ####

NVA_blossom_path:0 "Lonesome Road" 
NVA_blossom_path_desc:0 "We have made our choice: the untrustworthy king leaves his domain in turmoil, letting the Council of Wise step in to pick up the pieces. As the chancellor of the Council, Zeyshan will transform Sen Kinh into a modern beacon of freedom and equality through the magic of friendship and a true heart of kindness."

NVA_blossom_politik_reform:0 "Political Reformation" 
NVA_blossom_politik_reform_desc:0 "The king has always been the linchpin of the kingdom's political apparatus. With the central government Lotus now headless, Sen Kinh's bureaucracy has been torn asunder. A reorganisation of as many ministries and departments is in order." 

NVA_blossom_weak_the_king:0 "Weaken The Monarch" 
NVA_blossom_weak_the_king_desc:0 "Though we have already taken most of Rankin's power, the title of King remains with him - as does formal ownership of our nation. We cannot allow his crown to bear any weight that could bar us from our dream of a better, peaceful, and united Sen Kinh. Let us review the legal code, and draw the line of a monarch's power."

NVA_blossom_weaken_generals:0 "Army Reorganisation" 
NVA_blossom_weaken_generals_desc:0 "Following the resolution with King Rankin, we must turn to the matter of his adopted son, An Rokh the War Master. His power grants him leadership of perhaps half of our army - and were he to betray us - it would cost Sen Kinh heavily. Let us reorganize our ranks, and help each soldier understand what values we defend." 

NVA_blossom_reform_council:0 "Rectify The Council of The Wise" 
NVA_blossom_reform_council_desc:0 "The Council of The Wise originates from the aristocratic democracy of the Baiyan Kingdom. Wisdom, however, also lies in the diversity of ideas and perspectives. More brilliant minds from more corners of the world must become part of this Council - for Sen Kihn is for all, not for one." 

NVA_blossom_get_laws:0 "The Three Standards" 
NVA_blossom_get_laws_desc:0 "The current law system is a complex and perhaps haphazard amalgamation of the Kingdom's old legal system, the chaotic statute law, and the customary laws. It will take time to discuss, draft, and implement a more streamlined, comphrenesible, modern law system. Until then, we shall give Sen Kinh three standard rules to stabilize society." 

NVA_blossom_economi_reform:0 "Save Our Pockets" 
NVA_blossom_economi_reform_desc:0 "Money is not everything, yet we cannot live without it. Financial stability is a must, along with it being an attractive promise, a tangible catalyst of hope for many. As such, we must multiply the cogs of our growing industry, consolidate our disparate resources into manageable companies and co-operatives." 

NVA_blossom_domestic_development:0 "Self Reliance" 
NVA_blossom_domestic_development_desc:0 "How can we enter the lucrative global market when we have nothing to bargain with? The southern lands provide our answer, teeming with soil untouched by modern-day machinery - there is bound to be a bounty for us to uncover… and should we fail, we can at least prop our own economy up with the fruits of this initiative." 

NVA_blossom_international_trade:0 "Revive Naval Trade" 
NVA_blossom_international_trade_desc:0 "From before Kiria's Silence, Blossom maintained favourable trade with the many nations of Griffonia. This aquatic "Road of Blossom" once brought us great fortune, and while it has certainly declined, nothing is stopping us from sending our ships along it once more to reconnect with the wider world." 

NVA_blossom_stable_economi:0 "Stabilize The Economy" 
NVA_blossom_stable_economi_desc:0 "Our economy's exemplary recovery has delivered Sen Kinh from the brink. While the economy is only one facet of the many issues that plague the kingdom, we can rest easy today, for every creature here need not fear a recession. Their hard-earned funds are safe." 

NVA_blossom_revive_manufacto:0 "Manufacturing Revival" 
NVA_blossom_revive_manufacto_desc:0 "Lotus and Blossom were projected to reach the status of world-class ports, heralding cargo and traders from across the continents, bolstered by a complex of brand-new factory districts to cope with substantial demand. That sadly did not come to fruition, but the plans are still lying around here somewhere, ready to realize a manufacturing giant." 

NVA_blossom_bread_basket:0 "Bread Basket Of East" 
NVA_blossom_bread_basket_desc:0 "As 80% of our land is fertile and capable of producing food, we are no doubt the rice basket of the East. However, sickles and shovels can only get our farmers so far. Introducing our farms and paddies to modern farming machinery will unlock the full potential of our bountiful land." 

NVA_blossom_employment_armia:0 "Get Yourself A Job" 
NVA_blossom_employment_armia_desc:0 "Jobs, everyone needs a job to make their living, and faking our employment rate reports will only make the people our enemy. Fortunately, as we undergo industrialization, factories require a larger workforce. Meanwhile, there is a need for fresh recruits to bolster the army." 

NVA_blossom_cultural_reform:0 "Ethnicity Issues" 
NVA_blossom_cultural_reform_desc:0 "While Kirin constitutes the majority race in Sen Kinh, the country is also home to numerous other minority races and ethnicities like zebras or griffons. Caution is essential in handling ethnicity issues to prevent unnecessary conflicts among our people." 

NVA_blossom_expand_metrot:0 "Rely On Metrots" 
NVA_blossom_expand_metrot_desc:0 "Originally, the term "Metrots" referred to Kirin and zebras who had embraced each other's ways of living, evolving into the second-largest ethnicity in the nation. Thus, broadening the identity of Metrots has the potential to bring together and unite more minority groups." 

NVA_blossom_do_nothing_plz:0 "Doing Nothing Is Doing Everything" 
NVA_blossom_do_nothing_plz_desc:0 "The Kingdom has kept this diversity of ethnicities for centuries. We didn't do any prevention proactively in the past, and there's no need to do anything proactively in the future. The people have their ways to solve issues and the government should not intervene." 

NVA_blossom_stable_culture_conflicts:0 "Transfer The conflicts" 
NVA_blossom_stable_culture_conflicts_desc:0 "While our efforts have yielded significant results, waiting for every aspect to be fully resolved is not a luxury we can afford. Shifting people's attention to a common foe, for example, can greatly unite and strengthen our nationality." 

NVA_blossom_migration_issues:0 "Immigration And Refugees" 
NVA_blossom_migration_issues_desc:0 "Sen Kinh is not an immigration country, but we cannot ignore those immigrations and refugees from other nations. Guided by the teachings of the Scrolls of the Elders, we are reminded to care for everyone, including minorities. " 

NVA_blossom_generation_gap:0 "New Culture Movement" 
NVA_blossom_generation_gap_desc:0 "Industrialization is more than just building factories, it's equally important to build up our thoughts and minds. As most of our citizens remain uneducated, we need to teach them knowledge to contribute to not only industrialization but also society and technology." 

NVA_blossom_religion_issues:0 "Religion And Greed" 
NVA_blossom_religion_issues_desc:0 "Whether during the era of the Baiyan Kingdom or under the current regime, we always kept the Freedom of Religion as our society's principle. Nevertheless, some counsellors express concerns about the potential lack of cohesion arising from this freedom..." 

NVA_blossom_pre_consitution:0 "Prepare For A Constitution" 
NVA_blossom_pre_consitution_desc:0 "While the nation is ruled by the Council of The Wise instead of King Rankin, Sen Kinh however, is still a Kingdom on paper. As industrialization progresses, the demand for replacing the monarchy is growing increasingly louder. It is time to make some changes." 

NVA_blossom_safe_for_now:0 "We are Safe, For Now" 
NVA_blossom_safe_for_now_desc:0 "After dealing with tons of boring political affairs for a long time, Sen Kinh is saved from the brink of collapse. Finally, we have a moment to turn our attention to our neighbours and make decisions for the future."

lotus.4.a:0 "Is it a gift, or a curse?"

lotus.5.t:0 "The Art of Not Being Governed"
lotus.5.d:0 "Another line of poetry had been brushed down in his magic, on the tattered scroll hanging against the midnight breeze. Blood-red lanterns coloured the near-empty garden like an ancient sunset, marring a patio that hung over a clear-crystal pond. This place of respite reeked of  strong rice alcohol, littered by fallen jewellery and garments indicating a hasty retreat, reminiscent of an overdue new year's festivity.\n\nAgainst a wall of costly timber, two shadows moved, cast by the ambient lights. The palace might as well have been abandoned, devoid of any other presence.\n\nThe one who stood was the kingdom's War Master, overseer of every iron-clad warrior who would lead every creature here out of misery spear by spear, bullet by bullet. Dazed and dejected under his hoof sat the other, the poet-king of all Sen Kinh, the alleged heart of kindness uncovered in one more night of revelling: wooed as many mares as he could acquire with his mastery over the written word, the sheer weight of his position, or the promise of royal booze.\n\nHe'd been caught. Again. That, more than anything, sank his world.\n\n"Enough, Father," rumbled out of War Master An Rokh. "I am governing you, our king, and so reality has been reversed. A fool leads the wise, has been for so long... so all I ask is that you pay heed and watch after your subjects. Be with us while we march together to a slow demise."\n\nAn Rokh walked away, his shadow lengthening until it joined the darkness outside, leaving King Rankin's form to flicker listlessly against the lanterns."
lotus.5.a:0 "Walled off from a life of virtue."
NVA_lotus_5_a_tt:0 "§RWho knows whether the prodigal son will return?§!\n"


lotus.6.t:0 "In Wisdom's Wake"
lotus.6.d:0 "Vast sunlight funnelled through a hole in the roof, turning into heavenly rays gracing Zeyshan in the Palace of Wisdom, the home of the Council of the Wise. Under the cool shade of miniscule trees, the Council sat, ears turned up to pay attention to his ending spiel. "...this freedom is the basis of all good civilisation. It is only when we are responsible to our own selves and to everyone as a whole can we be liberated, can every single one of our interests be defended from any tyranny!"\n\nHis time up, Zeyshan sat down, back in the shade, letting An Rokh arise to the sunlit spot. "What you suggest again is untenable. When our sovereign and supreme representative is an ever-shifting face, changing sides and cliques every few years, muddying his hooves in petty politicking, what then? The highest and most enviable position of power is cheapened! It can finally be attained by anyone should one have the cut-throat cunning to cheat his way to the throne!"\n\nZeyshan thrust out of his seat, charged into the sunlight. For how long can we be contained by the whim of an unchecked king? I can't—"\n\n"Silence," boomed an arbiter, a bearded kirin coming from the depths of the seats. Zeyshan froze, An Rokh kept stoic. "We have retreaded this old ground very lengthily. It is clear that your points cannot be reconciled with each other, not under this light." To the Council, "You yourselves have had much time to ruminate over these."\n\nWith the sunlit patch evacuated, it would be surrounded by a throng of torn scroll pieces, each detailing an answer and a reason. Not long after, the consensus would be announced through his mouth, to the joy of one and the dismay of another:"
lotus.6.a:0 "'The king will soon enlighten us.'"

lotus.7.t:0 "The Beginning of Persistence"
lotus.7.d:0 "Harsh sunlight beamed through the Palace and onto Zeyshan again, fresh off his confirmation as Grand Secretary: a zebra of the creatures, a path to a newer and kinder kingdom—no, a republic. "My esteemed brethren, thank you for your precious decisions! It is clear that our prior rule has devoured our way of life—"\n\n"With what guarantee will yours not do the same?" asked Khandor. His crinkled robed visage made evident his age; the semicircle of leery Wisecreatures made evident his sway; his seeming right-hoof stallion An Rokh himself, his threat.\n\nZeyshan cocked his head. "But have you not voted on me?"\n\n"You've convinced us that the alternative of letting Rankin continue is worse than this. Not much else." A little growl had darkened the mention of his own student.\n\n"The Council must recognise that I've collected enough strands of thought from across the world for the sake of building as perfect of a government as possible—"\n\n"Is our dear Sen Kinh represented in these strands?" Khandor asked. Probably unknown to the old kirin, the faint glow of magic surrounded An Rokh's sword. It shone the War Master's colour, that of eyes trained on Zeyshan—he couldn't have missed it. "Restart here," continued Khandor, "and collect our own creatures' strands of thought before you prove your ideas in the battleground of governance."\n\nThe Council split off prematurely, ending the session. For Zeyshan's part, his heart stirred; the steps down back to the flower-laden entrance had it tremble like in a typhoon. Almost a misstep, almost a trip and a fall flat to the face. His blood on that sword wasn't hard to imagine. A single miscalculation..."
lotus.7.a:0 "Another step forward, he must take."


lotus.8.t:0 "The Noble Parasites"
lotus.8.d:0 "(plot event, medium length, around 300 words)Zeyshan begins to reform the kingdom's political system, replacing the old bureaucrats with new republicans.\n\nScene one, in a teahouse, Zeyshan talks with the 'advocate', the leader of the communist party (throught the even, the 'advocate' just sits there, listening and nodding to Zeyshan's words, sometimes he would talk, but not much, no need to give the advocate detailed descriptions). \n\nZeyshan explains that the old seniors and lords in the system have become a parasite class that drinks blood from both people and the nation, and thus, they must be replace by new blood. To establish a republic and waken the people, the country must do it step by step, and the first thing they should do, is reforming the old bureaucrats.\n\nScene two, the advocate agrees, and said even if their ideologies are completely different, they are still friends and have a lot in common, especially in dealing with the noble parasites"
lotus.8.a:0 "New blood, new future."


lotus.9.t:0 "Golden Liberty"
lotus.9.d:0 "Rankin looked at the text before him, eyes dashing left and right. Not that he cared about what was written, he merely tried to look interested.\n\n"Your Majesty." Zeyshan coughed. "We need to make sure you understand the terms. Could you please read back the four points of the King’s Articles?"\n\nRankin folded his hooves. "One - the state is a republic under the presidency of the King, in which he will reign, but shall not govern. Two - The Council of the Wise shall directly govern the state, and the election of its members cannot be influenced by the King. Three - Political Rights may only be held by councilors and senior noble conservatives. Four - All councilors, whether republican or noble conservatives, shall be equal on all rights."\n\nZeyshan smiled, hiding his tension behind manners and good will. "Perfect, Your Majesty. Now, I ask you to sign it." He said, placing the scroll on the table ahead of Rankin.  The king looked at the paper skeptically, then at Zeyshan. It all happened like a shot at the doctor’s - quick, and over before it was expected. Just like that, Rankin ran his quill across the bottom of the document. Zeyshan blinked in surprise.\n\n"...What?" Rankin scoffed at the Zebra, rolling the scroll up before hoofing it over to him. "Oh. Surprised? Heh. You’re the one who’s willingly taking the weight off my shoulders. I only read the paper to make sure you didn’t give me more responsibilities." The king smiled, leaning back in his seat. "It is a curse, having government power. Take it, be my guest. I’ve been buried in administrative work and papers. If you think the Wise can lead Sen Kinh better, try your luck. Either way, you’ve helped me focus more on my muse." He said…then frowned. "And you’ve also taken my time. Leave - I’m onto a very good verse…Servants! I need a cup of wine now before my inspiration wanes!"\n\nZeyshan picked up the scroll, and silently left Rankin to his poetry. As the Zebra walked through the hallways of the palace, he was deep in thought. It didn’t feel like a total victory. Even if Rankin could no longer dictate Sen Kihn, the power was still far from the hooves of the common folk. A monarchy was traded for an oligarchy tonight. But progress was progress. Stepping out through the gates of the palace, Zeyshan fondly looked at the sun. Sen Kihn was a step closer to becoming a true, democratic republic."
lotus.9.a:0 "The residence behind his garden wall is the King's equal."


lotus.10.t:0 "Father's Favourite Son"
lotus.10.d:0 "Rankin raised his cup, smiling proudly at the guests. The grand feast was in full swing, and all the important figures of Sen Kinh reveled. "A moment, everyone!" Rankin exclaimed. The guests turned to him, silent and letting the king speak. "I'd like to make a toast! To a young, good lad! The most brilliant, bravest War Master of Sen Kinh! I could not have asked for a greater son. To you, An Rokh!"\n\nProudly smiling at the attention, An Rokh raised his chin, and the guests around him raised their cups with cheers, before taking hearty gulps. Then, a familiar figure approached. "Zeyshan!" An Rokh smirked. "What brings you to my side of the table?"\n\n "Good tidings, An Rokh. You look energetic as always. As for why I'm here..." Zeyshan leaned in close. "We have to talk. I see you’re enjoying being called “warmaster”, but you’re a grown Kirin now. This is the adult world, so we’re doing things seriously now. These little political ‘games’ you’re playing? They’re done the moment you get up from this chair. You’re no longer going to involve yourself in the politics of Sen Kinh. You can stay a military leader, but you don’t get to tell our people how to live. You can forget your idea of turning our country into your personal plaything." \n\nThe whole time, An Rokh stared at him with wide, bewildered - and furious eyes. "Zeyshan, do you have any idea who you are talking to? My father will--"\n\nZeyshan only needed to gesture to Rankin, who happily ate and drank his worries away, Khandor looking no more interested in An Rokh than his adoptive father was. While An Rohk stared in disbelief, Zeyshan whispered in his ear. "Before you go Nirik, know this - you can kill me any time you want, or not accept my demands. But if you do that, if you do not stand down when Sen Kinh needs the peace and harmony it deserves, you are done. Maybe your plane will crash. Maybe a meal will be your last. Maybe one night you’ll fall asleep, never to wake up. Do you understand?"\n\n Silently, nervously...An Rokh shakily nodded. Zeyshan's deep stare turned into a kind smile. "Wonderful. I hope you enjoy the feast, An Rokh! Our chefs really did amazingly tonight, didn't they?"

lotus.12.d:0 "(flavour event, short, around 200 words) On the plaza of Blossom city, Zeyshan speaks to the people.Scene one, Zeyshan stands on the stage and attracts a lot of creatures, Kirin, zebras and even a few griffons and ponies.\n\nScene two, Zeyshan delivers a speech about the laws. Considering the nation is undergo a reform, the kingdom's old law system needs time to be reformed. Thus, to keep the stability and avoid unexpected Nirik transformations, the old laws will all be removed and there will only have three basic standards that all creatures must follow: 1. creatures who kill others must be slained too; 2. creatures who hurt or steal others must pay the same amount money for their crime; 3. No racism, all creatures must be treated equally and not get judged by their blood."

lotus.13.d:0 "(flavour event, medium length, around 200 words) In a crowded teahouse, Zeyshan discusses the upcoming ethnicity policy reform with the 'advocate'.\n\nScene one, Zeyshan and the 'advocate' enjoys their hot Longjing tea. Then suddenly, an argument disrupts them. Two Kirin are criticizing one zebra who shares the same table with them because they don't want to sit with a different creature. Zeyshan quietly comments with the 'advocate' that he's quite worried about such racism actions or prejudices during the ethnic reform.\n\nScene two, a Kirin kid who aged 7 interrupts Zeyshan's murmuring. After witnessing the argument, the kid asks his mother why zebras are different from them. His mother answers that the gods created different shaped creatures to make the world more lively, so they shouldn't make prejudices on creatures who are different from them. After seeing this, Zeyshan is relieved and he believes though there will be obstacles, the futures is bright. "

lotus.14.t:0 "A Mixed Culture"
lotus.14.d:0 "(flavour event, short, around 150 words, pure narration) The Metrot community had existed long before the establishment of Baiyan Kingdom in 500 ALB. In the later 500 years, the influence of Metrots kept expanding as more and more Zebras and Kirin walked into each other's lives. It was the magic of love and tolerance that made everything possible. Once in a while, Metrot was just one of ethnic minorities, but as time went by, it's more likely to be an universal concept instead of one single ethnicity. For now, every creature can identify themselves as one Metrot as long as they believe in the concept of Metrots. Thus, by expanding the identity of Metrots, we're able to unite more ethnicities together."

lotus.15.d:0 "(flavour event, short, around 150 words, pure narration) One of the Scrolls of the Elders goes, the society is made by harmony, the harmony between creatures and nature. The society will take care of itself, just like nature. The more we interrupt the rules of the society, the worse end we will suffer. The Scrolls of the Elders forms a government of caring and guiding, not reigning or suppressing. Just like our elders, we are here to care for everyone, not asking them to obey strict rules. While it seems the government is doing nothing, we're actually doing everything by respecting the natural rules of the society."

lotus.16.d:0 "(flavour event, short length, around 100 words, pure narration) After publishing our latest ethnicity laws, we can do nothing except for waiting for them to play their parts. Anyway, we shouldn't let people focus on one reform, which would only maximize all the smallest flaws. Instead, we should let citizens focus on something else, something more important than ethnicity issues, like immigrations, refugees and national education (relate to event 37 and 38)"

lotus.17.d:0 "(flavour event, medium length, around 225 words) On the dockyard of Blossom, Zeyshan watches the busy creatures.\n\nFirst scene, the busy creatures are working on delivery and shipping affairs. Some of them are complaining about the decrease of the domestic wheat and their worry for the upcoming reformation, which may interrupt their poor but stable lives.\n\nSecond scene, Zeyshan stares at the ships, knowing that he must do something to save the economy if he wants people to put their faith in his reforms. At this moment, the best way is to continue the paused industrialization."
lotus.17.a:0 "Let the engine roar once more!"


lotus.18.t:0 "Working with Nature"
lotus.18.d:0 "(flavour event, short, around 150 words, pure narration) After King Leethui's crownation in 940 ALB, the balance between domestic market and foreign trade has changed. King Leethui focused on our bases, turning the natural resources into fuels that the industrial engine needs. We should learn from King Leethui's method, boosting our industrialization with our domestic resources.

We exported our wheat and natural resources to Prywhen, Equestria and other nations. All the ships were departed from Blossom, and this shipping road was named as 'The Road of Blossom' by a Griffonheim Griffon historian. Though the trade of Blossom has greatly decreased, it's time to revive it and let our name be known to the world once more. We have two options, whether slow our steps and try to reform the naval trade moderately, or push the industrialization with all costs."

lotus.34.t:0 "Jaded Vermillion"
lotus.34.d:0 "I'm sorry," Zeyshan choked out, letting go of an orphan filly. Depleted farms and villlages with never enough hooves on the field, overpopulated cities vomiting smog to a crowd of poor, armies of widows and orphans,: this was the Grand Gallop Onward's masterpiece. The simple carriage trip to Vermilion felt insanely rich when conditions on the ground shouted out the pain of an entire Realm uprooted from its shell, spat into the wider world with only hope on top, backstabbing underneath.\n\n"Who did the Matriarch assemble?" he had mentioned in passing not long ago. "A hermit monk scared at anything more advanced than a fork, a foreigner businesskirin content with turning Kiria into a national sweatshop, a wayward priestess who'd 'purify' her revolution through any means possible... and who headed these three? An idealist untouched by experience. No wonder..."\n\nSuch reminiscing left him once the Vermilion Palace came into view. Metal mutedly clashed against metal; the city's old guards, faithful to the Matriarch, were resigned to join Concord soon in a good death. That Sen Kinh would send them there, Zeyshan had no answers to, not for him nor for the train of kirin that had followed him like a mystery to chase. They could not be ignored.\n\nHe hopped off the carriage, ready for a swarm of kirin hungry for answers. "If you are expecting some grandiose speech, now is not the time!" He took the robe around his head off and waved it, a sign of some courtesy, some greeting. The reply was a modest, unsure wave of cheers from humble bungalows to sky-high balconies. "A sensible government is what this realm needs! Let us dream, but let us not overstep ourselves! Have a good day, and I will see you again shortly!"

Second scene, someone reminds Zeyshan that they should change the country's name to 'Mellifluve Federation', using Mellifluve river as a bond to combine Kiria and Zaikiria together (referencing Danubian Federation) because they now have to govern both Kiria and Zaikiria and thus, they should care for everyone (taking Kiria as a terrible example that cares shit about its people)"

NVA_zeyshan_desc:0 "§YBorn§!:March 28th, 977 ALB, in Blossom\n\n§YBiography§!:The Father is a Metrot Zebra farmer, and the mother is an indigenous nobility in Blossom, Zeyshan already had everything at the moment when he was born.\n\nYet, Zeyshan didn't enjoy his noble living. Instead, he first went to Eastern Griffonia with the Blossom merchants in 999. Setting sail from the port of Blossom, he first made a stop at Fragrance in North Kiria, then proceeded to Ostkranbi in Hindia, Kizil-Zeb in Coltva, Aster's Landing in Asterion, Riaportu in Gryphus, and finally reached Seguro in Kasa, where he encountered his own kind in Griffonia for the first time. Following that, he journeyed through Evi Valley, passing through Kivessin in Prywhen to Griffing in Angriver, ultimately arriving at his destination, Greenback in Yale.\n\nIt was in Yale where he first studied in the House of Cyrusval for 5 years, getting friends of communists from all over the world.\n\nThough he was not sure about the path of communism and revolution, he's a sociable and charismatic zebra who can be friends with all creatures. In 1004, he departed from Yale and made his way to Aquileia. It was in Rila where he became captivated by the ideologies of the Republicans and the harmonists.\n\nAfter years of travelling abroad and studying, it was the Scrolls of the Elders that made him realize his people cannot be saved by either communism or capitalism, only kindness and friendship can remove the bias between creatures.\n\nSo, he returned with Wingbardian merchants to Blossom in late 1006, becoming one of the freshers in the Council of the Wise, assisting King Rankin with the nation's future.\n\nWhen Kiria ends the Silence, Zeyshan understands that Sen Kinh will undergo profound changes, presenting him with the perfect opportunity to bring to his people and all creatures.\n\nAs a Metrot in Blossom, Zeyshan firmly believes that friendship is the key to building a harmonious society, and he is committed to playing his part in achieving it.\n\n§YPortrait By§!:qwq233"

NVA_rankin:0 "Rankin"
NVA_rankin_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: April 24th, 965 ALB, in Lotus\n§YBiography§!:As the second child in the family, the only reason the Council of the Wise selected Rankin for the throne after his father's death was his susceptibility to manipulation compared to his older brother. His real interests made it obvious, as he spent much of his free time mastering the art of poetry and funding the creative arts in Sen Kinh like a hyper-rich patron, letting the Council call the shots in the halls of governance.\n\nBut when Rankin adopted Grand General An Rokh in 1000 as a foster son, the kingdom already on the edge of a Council-led coup, Rokh became the spine that his godfather sorely needed. Should the Council succeed and destabilize the kingdom, Sen Kinh would become easy prey to the barbarians of Lan Kir and more. That wake-up call snapped Rankin back to the reality of his royal position and the responsibility he had to his creatures. With Rokh serving as the brawn to Rankin's brains, the kind king navigated through the Council's political machinations with some of his old authority regained, albeit with a tearful leave from his pursuit of poetry.\n\nUnfortunately, Rankin's best efforts to be wise and talented like his father have fallen short. His negligence of the social sciences during his upbringing (not to mention him being the second child would've kept him away from the proper training an heir needed) have rendered him blind to the intricacies of the North-South struggle and Sen Kinh's stillborn modernization efforts. How, of course, would he know enough about the clash of classes and religions without having been on the ground with the kirin who bore the brunt of these conflicts first-hoof, having instead squirrelled away in some grandiose study hall to write a pair of pretty rhymes?\n\nDespite all this, he can at least bank on his kind heart for all creatures. On this, he will not give in. He claims that he may not have the answers now, but can a kirin like him not change for the better? To be all the wiser?"

He was born in a poor peasant family, who's supposed to experience a simple life, but his ambition won't allow that. He starts from a hoove soldier, upgrading his ranks step by step, and ends up as the youngest Grand General of the kingdom in 999. His swift rise in rank earns him favour from King Rankin, who later becomes his godfather in 1000.\n\nRankin grants him the title of "War Master", letting An Rokh lead the kingdom's army. To his father's satisfaction, An Rokh defeated the Nirik invaders of Lan Kir many times.\n\nTo achieve more, he helps his father reclaim the power stolen by the counsellors of the Council by force. While some counsellors are convinced that An Rokh may pose a greater threat to the king, Rankin is confident that his foster son will never turn against him.An Rokh shares the same belief as his father. He is unwavering in his loyalty to the nation and to his father, who appears to be exceedingly kind, or even weak to all..\n\n§YPortrait By§!:qwq233"

This difficult childhood made him profoundly detached from everyone else, and it was in this feeling that he disobeyed his parents, who wanted him to take over the family store and join the prestigious Wingbardy Officer School instead.\n\nWith rather good results, despite observations of his occasional brutality, Midnight Hooves formed and hardened during his years of study. It was only years later, through the networks of the vast Kirin diaspora, that he learned an opportunity to return to his native continent to serve in Sen Kinh's army, which was then seeking to modernize its officer corps. He quickly made a name for himself with his unorthodox but effective methods and became one of the most respected and feared generals in the army.\n\n§YPortrait By§!:AnaStaFury"

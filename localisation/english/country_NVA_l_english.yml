NVA_culture_intro_desc:0 "Throughout the reigns of both the Baiyan Kingdom and its successor, the Sen Kinh Kingdom, diverse ethnicities and pluralism consistently characterized the societal fabric.

NVA_zeyshan:0 "Zeyshan"
NVA_zeyshan_desc:0 "§YBorn§!:March 28th, 977 ALB, in Blossom\n\n§YBiography§!:The Father is a Metrot Zebra farmer, and the mother is an indigenous nobility in Blossom, Zeyshan already had everything at the moment when he was born.\n\nYet, Zeyshan didn't enjoy his noble living. Instead, he first went to Eastern Griffonia with the Blossom merchants in 999. Setting sail from the port of Blossom, he first made a stop at Fragrance in North Kiria, then proceeded to Ostkranbi in Hindia, Kizil-Zeb in Coltva, Aster's Landing in Asterion, Riaportu in Gryphus, and finally reached Seguro in Kasa, where he encountered his own kind in Griffonia for the first time. Following that, he journeyed through Evi Valley, passing through Kivessin in Prywhen to Griffing in Angriver, ultimately arriving at his destination, Greenback in Yale.\n\nIt was in Yale where he first studied in the House of Cyrusval for 5 years, getting friends of communists from all over the world.\n\nThough he was not sure about the path of communism and revolution, he's a sociable and charismatic zebra who can be friends with all creatures. In 1004, he departed from Yale and made his way to Aquileia. It was in Rila where he became captivated by the ideologies of the Republicans and the harmonists.\n\nAfter years of travelling abroad and studying, it was the Scrolls of the Elders that made him realize his people cannot be saved by either communism or capitalism, only kindness and friendship can remove the bias between creatures.\n\nSo, he returned with Wingbardian merchants to Blossom in late 1006, becoming one of the freshers in the Council of the Wise, assisting King Rankin with the nation's future.\n\nWhen Kiria ends the Silence, Zeyshan understands that Sen Kinh will undergo profound changes, presenting him with the perfect opportunity to bring to his people and all creatures.\n\nAs a Metrot in Blossom, Zeyshan firmly believes that friendship is the key to building a harmonious society, and he is committed to playing his part in achieving it."

NVA_rankin:0 "Rankin"
NVA_rankin_desc:0 "§YBorn§!:April 24th, 965 ALB, in Lotus\n\n§YBiography§!:As the second child in the family, the only reason for Rankin's ascension to the throne is the belief among the powerful counsellors of the Council of The Wise that he is more susceptible to manipulation than his older brother.\n\nAs a Kirin devoted to mastering the art of poetry, Rankin proves to be ill-suited for the role of a proficient ruler of the kingdom. Instead of giving orders to the Council of The Wise, he leans towards fostering and supporting the realms of arts and poetry. This leads to the Council gaining more power than ever before, allowing those influential counsellors to hold the nation.\n\nWhen Rankin adopts An Rokh in the year 1000 ALB, the kingdom is on the edge of being usurped by the counsellors of the Council. With the help of his foster son, Rankin successfully regains some of his power and begins to rule his nation seriously.\n\nUnfortunately, even if Rankin tries his best to be a wise and talented King like his father, he always fails every attempt. No matter the conflicts between the North and the South or the stopped industrialization, all the problems are beyond his ability.\n\nHe's not a good king, but he has a kind heart for all creatures. Anyway, Rankin will not give in. He believes that with increased effort, he can become the wise king that his people need someday..."

This difficult childhood made him profoundly detached from everyone else, and it was in this feeling that he disobeyed his parents, who wanted him to take over the family store and join the prestigious Wingbardy Officer School instead.\n\nWith rather good results, despite observations of his occasional brutality, Midnight Hooves formed and hardened during his years of study. It was only years later, through the networks of the vast Kirin diaspora, that he learned an opportunity to return to his native continent to serve in Sen Kinh's army, which was then seeking to modernize its officer corps. He quickly made a name for himself with his unorthodox but effective methods and became one of the most respected and feared generals in the army.\n\n§YPortrait By§!:AnaStaFury"

NVA_A_Pluralistic_Society:0 "A Pluralistic Society"
NVA_A_Pluralistic_Society_desc:0 "Even though Sen Kinh is not an immigration country and has Kirin as its major ethnic group, there are Zebra Indigenous and Metrots who cannot be ignored. Over centuries of living together, a new identity of “Metrots” has formed, referring to those Zebras and Kirin who have learned to accept each other's culture and ways of living. The nation is filled with different thoughts, cultures, languages, races and religions, but all creatures can share a land here as long as they can respect each other. This multicultural society, however, can be a gift of technology and society development, or a curse of turmoil, the two sides of a coin."

NVA_The_Heart_of_Kindness:0 "The Heart of Kindness"
NVA_The_Heart_of_Kindness_desc:0 "'The Heart of Kindness' is a fundamental teaching of the indigenous religion known as the Scrolls of the Elders. It believes that every creature was born with a good nature and therefore, a heart of compassion can lead to benevolence and a heart of shame can lead to righteousness. For centuries, the spirit of being kind and righteous has always been remembered by the creatures of Sen Kinh. It's the heart of kindness that established the pluralistic society and the Kingdom of Baiyan and its successor, the Kingdom of Sen Kinh. No matter who is the ruler, they must bear kindness in their hearts if they wish to maintain their reign. If the ruler chooses to defy it, persisting in an unjust war or a brutal reign, the people will no longer rally behind him, just as the teaching of Scrolls of The Elders goes, 'The water can both carry and overturn the boat. '"


NVA_Lands_Enclosure:0 "Lands Enclosure"
NVA_Lands_Enclosure_desc:0 "As Sen Kinh strides towards modernization and industrialization, the need for a great number of resources is steadily increasing, which leads to massive enclosures of lands. On one hoove, wealthy landlords contribute more resources to support our industrialization; on the other claw, this emerging capitalism in Blossom and Lotus poses a great threat to traditional society. The problem is very clear, as a nation that has more than 80% of the land being used by the traditional farming class, the rapid enclosure greatly weakens the King's reign. The conflicts between landlords and farmers are destroying stability in rural areas, impeding further development in industries."

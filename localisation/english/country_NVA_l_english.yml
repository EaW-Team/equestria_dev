NVA_blossom_politik_reform:0 "Political Reformation"

NVA_blossom_generation_gap:0 "New Culture Movement" 
NVA_blossom_generation_gap_desc:0 "Industrialization is more than just building factories, it's equally important to build up our thoughts and minds.

NVA_blossom_religion_issues:0 "Religion and Greed"

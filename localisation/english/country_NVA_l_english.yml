# Outdated
NVA_blossom_conquer_west:0 "A Journey To The West"
NVA_blossom_conquer_west_desc:0 "Throughout history, tyrannical powers gained their territory by conquering smaller, divided nations. Sen Kinh and Khamrin are under the constant threat of invasion. If Zaikiria as a whole wishes to strand strong against tyranny, then first we must seek total unity and co-operation."
NVA_blossom_conquer_khamer:0 "Our Southern Brother"
NVA_blossom_conquer_khamer_desc:0 "Khamrin is one of the city-states to gain its independence after the fall of the Baiyan Kingdom. Unlike Lan Kir, we have much in common with Khamrin, such as our history and our relationship. It should be no surprise then that many citizens are calling for a personal union with our southern brother."
NVA_blossom_conquer_lankir:0 "Put Down The Horde"
NVA_blossom_conquer_lankir_desc:0 "Following Vermillion's retreat from Zaikiria, the old Banners occupied Lan Kir and established their brutal reign on the land. The bandits have been raiding us for many years, bringing sorrow to many families. It's time to free our siblings in Lan Kir from the tyranny of the Twenty Banners."
NVA_blossom_reclaim_baiyan:0 "Strength Of A Hundred"
NVA_blossom_reclaim_baiyan_desc:0 "Since 500 ALB, our northern territory has been lost, and our children there had to live under foreign rule for hundreds of years. The 'Azure Hollow', once called 'Kerin County', is the last missing part of our motherland. It is time to reconnect our descendants with their home."
NVA_blossom_core_zaikiria:0 "13 Provinces Of Zaikiria"
NVA_blossom_core_zaikiria_desc:0 "The first king of the Baiyan Kingdom established a provincial system based on the 100 Zaikirian tribes that existed at the time. After centuries of chaos, Zaikiria is once again united by the successors of Baiyan, and we finally have the chance to modernize this ancient, administrative system."
NVA_blossom_get_resource:0 "Provincial System Improvements"
NVA_blossom_get_resource_desc:0 "The ancient system based on the thirteen provinces is useful and sustainable - yet, it cannot keep up with the peace of our central government's needs as we unite more of Zaikiria, and face new issues. As we head towards modernization, the provincial system must be revised accordingly to modern needs."
NVA_blossom_get_factories_from_friends:0 "Allies From The West"
NVA_blossom_get_factories_from_friends_desc:0 "For a long time, the resources of West Zaikiria were locked away behind treacherous mountains and terrain. Now, with modern machinery, reaching the West is no longer a pipe dream. Our industry will benefit from such a boon."
NVA_blossom_get_faction:0 "The Art Of Politics"
NVA_blossom_get_faction_desc:0 "A teaching in the Scrolls of The Elders states: 'Befriend those far away, while you fight those nearby'. There's no telling how Kiria will react to us reaching out to nations further West, but there is wisdom in the Scrolls. We must ally with them - one way...or another."
NVA_blossom_faction_zeblu:0 "The Spear Of Zeblu"
NVA_blossom_faction_zeblu_desc:0 "The Zebluans are great, and noble warriors. If the going gets tough, having such an ally standing by our side would be paramount. However, seeking this alliance entices both risk and reward, so we must be prepared for any outcome - even conflict."
NVA_blossom_faction_zongo:0 "The Power Of Faith"
NVA_blossom_faction_zongo_desc:0 "The Zongolese are faithful and peaceful creatures, but they are also able to protect their way of life, and are known to triumph against any threat that challenges their existence. An alliance between us shall be established on common faith, rather than conflict."
NVA_blossom_faction_kaiser:0 "The House Always Wins"
NVA_blossom_faction_kaiser_desc:0 "Kaiser Augustus Umqobi, a naive zebra who thought himself to be Kaiser, a humorous nod to the Griffons. We've sent a courier to him, with the message that he has one last chance to cease this offensive cosplay. Let's hope that not even the world's strongest headache will stop this courier."
NVA_blossom_faction_stronk:0 "In Harmony, We Unite"
NVA_blossom_faction_stronk_desc:0 "We've made great strides journeying West, and many new ethnicities have become part of our nation. Unfortunately, not all agree with our reign. Our mission as of this moment is to prove to them that Sen Kinh is an open-minded nation, one that welcomes all, and treats all kindness."
NVA_blossom_republik_thoughts:0 "Not A Wise King"
NVA_blossom_republik_thoughts_desc:0 "Were all kings wise, there'd be no need for republics. Fortunately for us, Rankin is anything but wise. However, the Senkinese have gotten used to being led by some “saint” for centuries, and that contradicts democratic thought. It is time to show that the people are masters of their own fate - not some king, no matter how wise he may be."
NVA_blossom_the_way_to_republik:0 "Towards The Republic"
NVA_blossom_the_way_to_republik_desc:0 "It is long overdue for us to form a republic - not only because the monarchy restrains out potential, but because this is the way for a brighter and more hopeful future for all. The road to a republic may be long and arduous, and many issues will need addressing - but what great feats have been achieved easily? 'Step by step, I'm sure the dream of a real republic will come true', Zeyshan said."
NVA_blossom_remove_king:0 "For The Good Of All"
NVA_blossom_remove_king_desc:0 "Hypocrites have justified history's greatest atrocities with a simple phrase - 'For the good of all'. We, however, are going to prove that we understand, and value the true meaning of this statement. Sen Kihn shall be for everyone - a land free of prejudice. For the good of all!"
NVA_blossom_threat_from_north:0 "Threat From The North "
NVA_blossom_threat_from_north_desc:0 "We've taken notice of the Grand Gallop Onwards, a project of our northern neighbor. Kiria is gathering its strength, now that it has been freed from the chains of Silence. Once again, there is a growing fear in Zaikiria over the threat of conquest. We must plan our measures accordingly."
NVA_blossom_slow_the_steps:0 "Slow The Reforms"
NVA_blossom_slow_the_steps_desc:0 "Without the restraint of the Silence, the modernizing Kiria has become a greater threat to Zaikiria than ever before. To protect our newborn republic from this threat we must, unfortunately, abate our reforms, and focus on our ability to defend ourselves first."
NVA_blossom_march_north:0 "To The North"
NVA_blossom_march_north_desc:0 "Our troops take the rifles. They sit behind the wheels of war machines. They march north, to Mellifluve. This fight is not for glory. This is for our families, our home. This battle is one we cannot afford to lose. We must stand together, or not at all."
NVA_blossom_win_north:0 "Cleave The Waves"
NVA_blossom_win_north_desc:0 "Victory, the glory for which we've given our all. The children of Baiyan have reclaimed their land, and their honour. The battle of the century is finally over. We've proven to the world and to history - that glory can be brought not by an iron fist, but a heart of kindness!"

It is also designated to manage security and relief missions to allow for the eventual integration of the provinces of Renjiang (formerly Razorgrain Frontier) and Lan Tsao (formerly Orchid Bushwood).

This difficult childhood made him profoundly detached from everyone else, and it was in this feeling that he disobeyed his parents, who wanted him to take over the family store and join the prestigious Wingbardy Officer School instead.\n\nWith rather good results, despite observations of his occasional brutality, Midnight Hooves formed and hardened during his years of study. It was only years later, through the networks of the vast Kirin diaspora, that he learned an opportunity to return to his native continent to serve in Sen Kinh's army, which was then seeking to modernize its officer corps. He quickly made a name for himself with his unorthodox but effective methods and became one of the most respected and feared generals in the army.\n\n§YPortrait By§!:AnaStaFury"

NVA_chai_yik_wing_desc:0 "Fate and circumstance are formidable obstacles. Many born into hardship and poverty often die within it. Yet, whoever has the opportunity to crawl out of that pit would do well to take full advantage of the climb. Chai Yik-wing intends to go high enough to never see the bottom ever again.\n\nAlthough his family’s roots trace to Lan Kir, they’d been settled in Sen Kinh long enough to adopt the new national identity over several generations. Higher education was not on the table for the impoverished Kirin until his family saw a glimmer of hope in the youth. Money was chipped in to get young Chai into university, where he excelled. Yet, the image of his uncle working overtime at his store for his sake, or the image of his grandmother sacrificing portions of her pension just to get him to where he was always haunted him.\n\nAs Sen Kinh’s Chief of National Police, these images are still burned into his mind. He seeks to serve the nation, yet he is unwilling to forget the debt before his family, as much as they urge him to. Beneath his excellent results-driven leadership and superb management skills as chief lie strings of nepotistic deeds. Promoted nephews, aunts in mansions - taxpayer funds have somehow found themselves in the pockets of those who invested in a young, hopeful Kirin who loved to dress in a police uniform.\n\nThe upwards climb does not end. Knowing that a potential occupation of Lan Kir would see great need for him as a police governor, he steels himself for great opportunities and the power that comes with them. There’s much work to do and he does not intend to neglect it, but surely nobody will notice if some riot equipment is of less than stellar quality. Sacrifices must be made for those who have sacrificed, after all."

### Intro Events ###

senkinh_intro.1.t:0 "Good Morning, Sen Kinh"
senkinh_intro.1.d:0 "The mists drape over hills both sharp and smooth, like a shawl. The humidity graces the myriads of colorful flowers and blesses their beauty forevermore. The rivers run far, the pristine drops banded in billions to sing their song of rushing flow. The rising sun waves to the land from the coast, the godrays cast through the thick canopies - it kisses the people of Sen Kinh to bestow them with another day. The towns and villages are nearly swallowed by mother nature, but she respects these souls and gives them their havens. On the coast, the sheet of azure clashes with the sun's light, an intertwining and dazzling dance, gracing its spectators with brilliant sparkles cast by the reflection.\n\nThe sun rises, and Sen Kinh opens its eyes to greet another morning. Despite the clear skies however, the giant shadow of change looms over the rolling valleys and the impenetrable jungles. Anxieties and insecurities arise from the limbo of awkward industrialization, muddled feudalism, and the iron smell of blood as Lan Kir's spears sharpen.\n\nAs the Kirin and Zebras tend to the fields and factories, they wonder - is today the day this shadow will finally begin to dispel?"
senkinh_intro.1.a:0 "It's time to rise."
senkinh_intro.2.t:0 "Crisp Air"
senkinh_intro.2.d:0 "A king should be careful, to take care of his own life and stay safe. Yet, King Rankin couldn't help but be allured by the crisp, outside air - gently leaning into the stone railing of the balcony that oversaw the jewel he reigned over. Lotus, great and opulent, one of Sen Kinh's two beating hearts. He ruled over them both, and now saw the citizens on the street below. Their lives were in his hooves, but...\n\nOh, how his hooves ached. The multitude of problems was not as crushing as the implication that the slightest mistake could ruin a life that entrusted him as King of Sen Kinh. Any error would not only reflect on his image, but the image of his own father. Respite was elusive, and to be content was a past luxury. That is why he was here, taking deep breaths of the cleanest air despite the risk of falling over and surprising the common folk with a final, impromptu visit.\n\nYet, gazing down to realize he was so above, it all reminded him who he was. Fate has granded him a one-in-billions chance to be King of Sen Kihn. How much could a monarch wallow? Was that the fate he wanted? The legacy he wanted for himself? For his father? He had more than a privilege to be on this balcony, for destiny had chosen him. No. Something's got to give.\n\nHe looked at his hooves. He was the instrument of change, and if he wanted to be more than a footnote, he knew he had to sharpen the core of his soul, to cut right through history and wear the title proudly...the King of Sen Kinh."
senkinh_intro.2.a:0 "Breath in, and go back in."
senkinh_intro.3.t:0 "Chatterboxes"
senkinh_intro.3.d:0 "The zebra had two ears. Now he wished he had neither. Not that the two figures beside him made bad points - but they were drilling them so hard into his head that he was sure he'd go deaf. Zeyshan's aunt to his right, and his best friend Lee Yiu Lou to the left. In-front of him, papers of information gathered by them both. Evidence to prove their plan had merit and plausability.\n\n"Buddy - I want you to see the big picture. The big, big picture." Lee Yiu Lou wrapped a hoof around the zebra, smirking ear to ear. "We can't let stagnation be our status quo, friend! I'm not saying we do something feisty and overhaul the government, but we gotta sit down with the King and...talk, you know! Plus, with you giving us a hoof on the Commission, we'll get Sen Kinh's movers and shakers to move and shake. We can modernize cities, finish poverty, accelerate our logistics! Or--"\n\nGently, Zeynin wrapped her hoof around her nephew, and pulled him in a little close, away from the kirin much to his annoyance. "Ahem. Lee seems to be excited - but he has an understandable reason. Zeyshan, sweetie, I...No, we think you have what it takes. You are an experienced stallion, you've seen the world and most importantly you have fresh ideas. The time is long overdue for us to change this country for the better. Freedom, efficiency...Zeyshan, you're special, and your knowledge and experience is invaluable to us if we want this better Sen Kinh. If anyone can show Rankin some fresh ideas, it's you. There's no pressure at all, but just think on it. There's not a soul I'd trust more than my own kin, nephew. And besides, you have me backing you in-case you fall down." She sweetly smiled.\n\nZeyshan's ears flickered once again. All these facts, all these ideas...There was pressure, there was uncertainty, and there certainly was risk. But both Lee and Zeynin were right. Sen Kihn needed a new tomorrow, and if he had to bring it himself, then so be it."
senkinh_intro.3.a:0 "There is truth in the yapping."
senkinh_intro.4.t:0 "The Way of the Warrior"
senkinh_intro.4.d:0 "The foals pointed sticks at one another, making the funniest gunfire noises with their mouths. They rolled around and argued about who was hit and who wasn't. On the same street, the elders smiled, sipped tea, and reminisced about the army. Medals and funny incidents, then somber moments too. Between the line of too young and too old were ready zebras and kirin performed who drills, shouting patriotically as they spun their weapons in their hooves, then stood at attention.\n\nPride, bravery, security. Every nation needed its defenders. The military's admiration knew no age, nor gender. All looked up to the uniform, those too young daydreaming and those too old reminiscing about being part of Sen Kinh's army. After all, cultural artifacts of Sen Kinh had no shortage of heroic warriors who felled demons and invaders. There was nothing more admirable than a fighter protecting their loved ones, and the land they cherished.\n\nAnd while the uniformed youths sacrificed sleep and health, government officials slept more soundly. With an army devoted to the state, nobody would dare endanger the establishment, neither a rebel nor an ambitious politician. After all, how mighty could a pen be when a dozen sharpened swords surrounded it?"
senkinh_intro.4.a:0 "All for Sen Kinh."
senkinh_intro.5.t:0 "The Intertwined Tree"
senkinh_intro.5.d:0 "Among one of Sen Kinh's strengths and beauties is the harmony between its races and ethnicities. It is not merely a home for kirin, but also zebra who have natively lived in the south, many of whom reside in the city of Blossom. This feat has its roots in history, one of the core reasons Sen Kinh had developed a culture unique from Kiria.\n\nThe ultimate testament to this is the existence of Metrots - kirin and zebra who have reached such levels of synergy and harmony that they developed their own unique identity, down to the language and customs.\n\nFriendships, marriages, family, camaraderie, of all factors that could limit these, race and culture has simply never been one of them.  This cultural merge stands tall to show the essence of Sen Kinh's people. They are united, hence they know they are strong - for this bond is the true source of strength for the souls so proud to meet the world's challenges hoof-in-hoof.\n\nThough, many are blind to the tide of time. What few regarded was long-term change. What tradition in Sen Kinh came from a core native of Zaikiria? What was made by independent brain, not a union? What came from who? Sen Kinh was not always this way, was it? The natives who remember dwindle, and their knowledge and memory fades away with them...with the tide of time. Returning to the soil, and being absorbed into the great, intertwined tree that was Sen Kinh."
senkinh_intro.5.a:0 "The roots grow into themselves."
senkinh_intro.6.t:0 "What To Do, What To Do?"
senkinh_intro.6.d:0 "Freedom and self-determination are great feats, yet they are made of great effort. Good countries carve their borders on the map - great countries keep them. Although all seek peace, it cannot be achieved without the ability to fight for it. One of the few points both the Commission and Sen Kinh's military leadership agree on is their stance on their neighbors.\n\n The elephant in the room is the Realm of Kiria, for its fate will send ripples across all of Eastern Zebrica. There is an uneasy notion that the unrest within may either lead to an amicable state willing to let bygones be bygones, or one led by a tyrant eager to once again annex the North, if not go further. Whatever fate befalls the Vermillion Dynasty, the Commission of Sages and the Sen Kinh military have plans both diplomatic and martial.\n\nLess complicated is the position of Lan Kir - or rather, the position against it. Multiple raids and military ambitions have solidified the strongest point of agreement within Sen Kihn's leadership that a constant military presence on the borders was paramount, lest forests and farms would burn and innocents would perish. Perhaps one day the warmongers will choose to calm the raging fire - but until that day comes, the border guards must sleep with one eye open.\n\nWith the very volatile nature of the region, Sen Kihn's leadership keeps an ear to the ground as winds blow and sands shift - but to defend the way of life in Sen Kihn was the bottom line. After all - what great feat existed without great effort?"
senkinh_intro.6.a:0 "With neighbors like these..."
senkinh_intro.7.t:0 "A Mad, Mad Orchestra"
senkinh_intro.7.d:0 "Shouting. Barking. Groaning. It was the worst, most discordant orchestra of an otherwise harmonious nation. The Commission of Sages. Sitting at the largest seat was King Rankin, albeit he had no control over this mad choir. This conductor had no baton.\n\n"I'd like to make it clear - it took effort to treat the proposal as anything but a jest." Sighed Fine Print, one of the older members of the Commission. "I wish to remind Marshal An Rokh that we are leading a nation, not an oversized military base. I would also like to remind him this room is the Commission's conference room, not the war room."\n\n"Am I to be shamed for seeking Sen Kihn's strength and sovereignty!?" Marshal An Rokh barked, contrasting her quiet calm. "This isn't Equestria, pony! I'm not going to let Sen Kihn's military become impotent in the face of all the threats looming over the horizon!"\n\nFine Print was so furious that were she a Kirin, she'd become a Nirik. Yet, all she did was flick her glasses. "My passport must be forged then, for spelling 'Equestria' as 'Sen Kinh'. Marshal, I did not know throwing petty insults and tantrums was a way a Sage conducted himself." She calmly spoke. As An Rokh was about to hurl a harsh insult, someone else's shout prevented him.\n\n"CEASE THIS." King Rankin shouted, the fact he chose to act more silencing than the raised voice alone. "I would like to remind you that this proposal does not only count with you two. I see we have differing opinions and I can see some of you can't stand being in this room, but as it stands, everyone here can affect the lives of over four million citizens. Please let's return to doing this the civilized, streamlined way, and you can all get home for supper."\n\nThrough the murmurs, there was an understanding. The dozens of Sages resigned to calm voting. Shouts were replaced by murmurs, and an occasional cough of a parched throat."
senkinh_intro.7.a:0 "He found the baton, for now."

NVA_blossom_conquer_west_desc:0 "Throughout history, tyrannical powers gained their territory by conquering smaller, divided nations. Sen Kinh and Khamrin are under the constant threat of invasion. If Zaikiria as a whole wishes to strand strong against tyranny, then first we must seek total unity and co-operation."
NVA_blossom_conquer_khamer:0 "Our Southern Brother"
NVA_blossom_conquer_khamer_desc:0 "Khamrin is one of the city-states to gain its independence after the fall of the Baiyan Kingdom.

It should be no surprise then that many citizens are calling for a personal union with our southern brother."
NVA_blossom_conquer_lankir:0 "Put Down The Horde"
NVA_blossom_conquer_lankir_desc:0 "Following Vermillion's retreat from Zaikiria, the old Banners occupied Lan Kir and established their brutal reign on the land.

NVA_blossom_reclaim_baiyan:0 "Strength Of A Hundred"
NVA_blossom_reclaim_baiyan_desc:0 "Since 500 ALB, our northern territory has been lost, and our children there had to live under foreign rule for hundreds of years.

NVA_blossom_core_zaikiria:0 "13 Provinces Of Zaikiria"
NVA_blossom_core_zaikiria_desc:0 "The first king of the Baiyan Kingdom established a provincial system based on the 100 Zaikirian tribes that existed at the time. After centuries of chaos, Zaikiria is once again united by the successors of Baiyan, and we finally have the chance to modernize this ancient, administrative system."
NVA_blossom_get_resource:0 "Provincial System Improvements"
NVA_blossom_get_resource_desc:0 "The ancient system based on the thirteen provinces is useful and sustainable - yet, it cannot keep up with the peace of our central government's needs as we unite more of Zaikiria, and face new issues. As we head towards modernization, the provincial system must be revised accordingly to modern needs."
NVA_blossom_get_factories_from_friends:0 "Allies From The West"
NVA_blossom_get_factories_from_friends_desc:0 "For a long time, the resources of West Zaikiria were locked away behind treacherous mountains and terrain. Now, with modern machinery, reaching the West is no longer a pipe dream. Our industry will benefit from such a boon."
NVA_blossom_get_faction:0 "The Art Of Politics"
NVA_blossom_get_faction_desc:0 "A teaching in the Scrolls of The Elders states: 'Befriend those far away, while you fight those nearby'. There's no telling how Kiria will react to us reaching out to nations further West, but there is wisdom in the Scrolls. We must ally with them - one way...or another."
NVA_blossom_faction_zeblu:0 "The Spear Of Zeblu"
NVA_blossom_faction_zeblu_desc:0 "The Zebluans are great, and noble warriors. If the going gets tough, having such an ally standing by our side would be paramount. However, seeking this alliance entices both risk and reward, so we must be prepared for any outcome - even conflict."

NVA_blossom_faction_stronk:0 "In Harmony, We Unite"
NVA_blossom_faction_stronk_desc:0 "We've made great strides journeying West, and many new ethnicities have become part of our nation. Unfortunately, not all agree with our reign. Our mission as of this moment is to prove to them that Sen Kinh is an open-minded nation, one that welcomes all, and treats all kindness."
NVA_blossom_republik_thoughts:0 "Not A Wise King"
NVA_blossom_republik_thoughts_desc:0 "Were all kings wise, there'd be no need for republics. Fortunately for us, Rankin is anything but wise. However, the Senkinese have gotten used to being led by some “saint” for centuries, and that contradicts democratic thought. It is time to show that the people are masters of their own fate - not some king, no matter how wise he may be."
NVA_blossom_the_way_to_republik:0 "Towards The Republic"
NVA_blossom_the_way_to_republik_desc:0 "It is long overdue for us to form a republic - not only because the monarchy restrains out potential, but because this is the way for a brighter and more hopeful future for all. The road to a republic may be long and arduous, and many issues will need addressing - but what great feats have been achieved easily? 'Step by step, I'm sure the dream of a real republic will come true', Zeyshan said."
NVA_blossom_remove_king:0 "For The Good Of All"
NVA_blossom_remove_king_desc:0 "Hypocrites have justified history's greatest atrocities with a simple phrase - 'For the good of all'. We, however, are going to prove that we understand, and value the true meaning of this statement. Sen Kihn shall be for everyone - a land free of prejudice. For the good of all!"
NVA_blossom_threat_from_north:0 "Threat From The North "
NVA_blossom_threat_from_north_desc:0 "We've taken notice of the Grand Gallop Onwards, a project of our northern neighbor. Kiria is gathering its strength, now that it has been freed from the chains of Silence. Once again, there is a growing fear in Zaikiria over the threat of conquest. We must plan our measures accordingly."
NVA_blossom_slow_the_steps:0 "Slow The Reforms"
NVA_blossom_slow_the_steps_desc:0 "Without the restraint of the Silence, the modernizing Kiria has become a greater threat to Zaikiria than ever before. To protect our newborn republic from this threat we must, unfortunately, abate our reforms, and focus on our ability to defend ourselves first."
NVA_blossom_march_north:0 "To The North"
NVA_blossom_march_north_desc:0 "Our troops take the rifles. They sit behind the wheels of war machines. They march north, to Mellifluve. This fight is not for glory. This is for our families, our home. This battle is one we cannot afford to lose. We must stand together, or not at all."
NVA_blossom_win_north:0 "Cleave The Waves"
NVA_blossom_win_north_desc:0 "Victory, the glory for which we've given our all. The children of Baiyan have reclaimed their land, and their honour. The battle of the century is finally over. We've proven to the world and to history - that glory can be brought not by an iron fist, but a heart of kindness!"

It was only years later, through the networks of the vast Kirin diaspora, that he learned an opportunity to return to his native continent to serve in Sen Kinh's army, which was then seeking to modernize its officer corps.

Yet, whoever has the opportunity to crawl out of that pit would do well to take full advantage of the climb. Chai Yik-wing intends to go high enough to never see the bottom ever again.\n\nAlthough his family’s roots trace to Lan Kir, they’d been settled in Sen Kinh long enough to adopt the new national identity over several generations. Higher education was not on the table for the impoverished Kirin until his family saw a glimmer of hope in the youth. Money was chipped in to get young Chai into university, where he excelled. Yet, the image of his uncle working overtime at his store for his sake, or the image of his grandmother sacrificing portions of her pension just to get him to where he was always haunted him.\n\nAs Sen Kinh’s Chief of National Police, these images are still burned into his mind. He seeks to serve the nation, yet he is unwilling to forget the debt before his family, as much as they urge him to. Beneath his excellent results-driven leadership and superb management skills as chief lie strings of nepotistic deeds. Promoted nephews, aunts in mansions - taxpayer funds have somehow found themselves in the pockets of those who invested in a young, hopeful Kirin who loved to dress in a police uniform.\n\nThe upwards climb does not end. Knowing that a potential occupation of Lan Kir would see great need for him as a police governor, he steels himself for great opportunities and the power that comes with them. There’s much work to do and he does not intend to neglect it, but surely nobody will notice if some riot equipment is of less than stellar quality. Sacrifices must be made for those who have sacrificed, after all."

Centuries of both races living together formed a new ethnicity known as "Metrots", referring to both kirin and zebras who've learned to accept each other's culture. Though greatly diverse in thought, language, and religion, all creatures can live together as long as they can respect each other.

These qualities helped establish the old Kingdom of Baiyan, blessing it with the pluralism that continues to this day, even up to informing the king or queen of how they must rule.

Many acres of land have thus been acquired by industrialists to transform them into factory districts, but while they massively help us catch up with the our neighbors, they also pose a great threat to our society. For a kingdom whose land has been directly owned by farmers and nobles since the days of Baiyan, these purchases of land have strengthen tensions between classes, destroying stability in rural areas and impeding our development."

### Intro Events ###

senkinh_intro.1.t:0 "Good Morning, Sen Kinh"
senkinh_intro.1.d:0 "The mists drape over hills both sharp and smooth, like a shawl. The humidity graces the myriads of colorful flowers and blesses their beauty forevermore. The rivers run far, the pristine drops banded in billions to sing their song of rushing flow. The rising sun waves to the land from the coast, the godrays cast through the thick canopies - it kisses the people of Sen Kinh to bestow them with another day. The towns and villages are nearly swallowed by mother nature, but she respects these souls and gives them their havens. On the coast, the sheet of azure clashes with the sun's light, an intertwining and dazzling dance, gracing its spectators with brilliant sparkles cast by the reflection.\n\nThe sun rises, and Sen Kinh opens its eyes to greet another morning. Despite the clear skies however, the giant shadow of change looms over the rolling valleys and the impenetrable jungles. Anxieties and insecurities arise from the limbo of awkward industrialization, muddled feudalism, and the iron smell of blood as Lan Kir's spears sharpen.\n\nAs the Kirin and Zebras tend to the fields and factories, they wonder - is today the day this shadow will finally begin to dispel?"
senkinh_intro.1.a:0 "It's time to rise."
senkinh_intro.2.t:0 "Crisp Air"
senkinh_intro.2.d:0 "A king should be careful, to take care of his own life and stay safe. Yet, King Rankin couldn't help but be allured by the crisp, outside air - gently leaning into the stone railing of the balcony that oversaw the jewel he reigned over. Lotus, great and opulent, one of Sen Kinh's two beating hearts. He ruled over them both, and now saw the citizens on the street below. Their lives were in his hooves, but...\n\nOh, how his hooves ached. The multitude of problems was not as crushing as the implication that the slightest mistake could ruin a life that entrusted him as King of Sen Kinh. Any error would not only reflect on his image, but the image of his own father. Respite was elusive, and to be content was a past luxury. That is why he was here, taking deep breaths of the cleanest air despite the risk of falling over and surprising the common folk with a final, impromptu visit.\n\nYet, gazing down to realize he was so above, it all reminded him who he was. Fate has granded him a one-in-billions chance to be King of Sen Kihn. How much could a monarch wallow? Was that the fate he wanted? The legacy he wanted for himself? For his father? He had more than a privilege to be on this balcony, for destiny had chosen him. No. Something's got to give.\n\nHe looked at his hooves. He was the instrument of change, and if he wanted to be more than a footnote, he knew he had to sharpen the core of his soul, to cut right through history and wear the title proudly...the King of Sen Kinh."
senkinh_intro.2.a:0 "Breath in, and go back in."
senkinh_intro.3.t:0 "Chatterboxes"
senkinh_intro.3.d:0 "The zebra had two ears. Now he wished he had neither. Not that the two figures beside him made bad points - but they were drilling them so hard into his head that he was sure he'd go deaf. Zeyshan's aunt to his right, and his best friend Lee Yiu Lou to the left. In-front of him, papers of information gathered by them both. Evidence to prove their plan had merit and plausability.\n\n"Buddy - I want you to see the big picture. The big, big picture." Lee Yiu Lou wrapped a hoof around the zebra, smirking ear to ear. "We can't let stagnation be our status quo, friend! I'm not saying we do something feisty and overhaul the government, but we gotta sit down with the King and...talk, you know! Plus, with you giving us a hoof on the Commission, we'll get Sen Kinh's movers and shakers to move and shake. We can modernize cities, finish poverty, accelerate our logistics! Or--"\n\nGently, Zeynin wrapped her hoof around her nephew, and pulled him in a little close, away from the kirin much to his annoyance. "Ahem. Lee seems to be excited - but he has an understandable reason. Zeyshan, sweetie, I...No, we think you have what it takes. You are an experienced stallion, you've seen the world and most importantly you have fresh ideas. The time is long overdue for us to change this country for the better. Freedom, efficiency...Zeyshan, you're special, and your knowledge and experience is invaluable to us if we want this better Sen Kinh. If anyone can show Rankin some fresh ideas, it's you. There's no pressure at all, but just think on it. There's not a soul I'd trust more than my own kin, nephew. And besides, you have me backing you in-case you fall down." She sweetly smiled.\n\nZeyshan's ears flickered once again. All these facts, all these ideas...There was pressure, there was uncertainty, and there certainly was risk. But both Lee and Zeynin were right. Sen Kihn needed a new tomorrow, and if he had to bring it himself, then so be it."
senkinh_intro.3.a:0 "There is truth in the yapping."
senkinh_intro.4.t:0 "The Way of the Warrior"
senkinh_intro.4.d:0 "The foals pointed sticks at one another, making the funniest gunfire noises with their mouths. They rolled around and argued about who was hit and who wasn't. On the same street, the elders smiled, sipped tea, and reminisced about the army. Medals and funny incidents, then somber moments too. Between the line of too young and too old were ready zebras and kirin performed who drills, shouting patriotically as they spun their weapons in their hooves, then stood at attention.\n\nPride, bravery, security. Every nation needed its defenders. The military's admiration knew no age, nor gender. All looked up to the uniform, those too young daydreaming and those too old reminiscing about being part of Sen Kinh's army. After all, cultural artifacts of Sen Kinh had no shortage of heroic warriors who felled demons and invaders. There was nothing more admirable than a fighter protecting their loved ones, and the land they cherished.\n\nAnd while the uniformed youths sacrificed sleep and health, government officials slept more soundly. With an army devoted to the state, nobody would dare endanger the establishment, neither a rebel nor an ambitious politician. After all, how mighty could a pen be when a dozen sharpened swords surrounded it?"
senkinh_intro.4.a:0 "All for Sen Kinh."
senkinh_intro.5.t:0 "The Intertwined Tree"
senkinh_intro.5.d:0 "Among one of Sen Kinh's strengths and beauties is the harmony between its races and ethnicities. It is not merely a home for kirin, but also zebra who have natively lived in the south, many of whom reside in the city of Blossom. This feat has its roots in history, one of the core reasons Sen Kinh had developed a culture unique from Kiria.\n\nThe ultimate testament to this is the existence of Metrots - kirin and zebra who have reached such levels of synergy and harmony that they developed their own unique identity, down to the language and customs.\n\nFriendships, marriages, family, camaraderie, of all factors that could limit these, race and culture has simply never been one of them.  This cultural merge stands tall to show the essence of Sen Kinh's people. They are united, hence they know they are strong - for this bond is the true source of strength for the souls so proud to meet the world's challenges hoof-in-hoof.\n\nThough, many are blind to the tide of time. What few regarded was long-term change. What tradition in Sen Kinh came from a core native of Zaikiria? What was made by independent brain, not a union? What came from who? Sen Kinh was not always this way, was it? The natives who remember dwindle, and their knowledge and memory fades away with them...with the tide of time. Returning to the soil, and being absorbed into the great, intertwined tree that was Sen Kinh."
senkinh_intro.5.a:0 "The roots grow into themselves."
senkinh_intro.6.t:0 "What To Do, What To Do?"
senkinh_intro.6.d:0 "Freedom and self-determination are great feats, yet they are made of great effort. Good countries carve their borders on the map - great countries keep them. Although all seek peace, it cannot be achieved without the ability to fight for it. One of the few points both the Commission and Sen Kinh's military leadership agree on is their stance on their neighbors.\n\n The elephant in the room is the Realm of Kiria, for its fate will send ripples across all of Eastern Zebrica. There is an uneasy notion that the unrest within may either lead to an amicable state willing to let bygones be bygones, or one led by a tyrant eager to once again annex the North, if not go further. Whatever fate befalls the Vermillion Dynasty, the Commission of Sages and the Sen Kinh military have plans both diplomatic and martial.\n\nLess complicated is the position of Lan Kir - or rather, the position against it. Multiple raids and military ambitions have solidified the strongest point of agreement within Sen Kihn's leadership that a constant military presence on the borders was paramount, lest forests and farms would burn and innocents would perish. Perhaps one day the warmongers will choose to calm the raging fire - but until that day comes, the border guards must sleep with one eye open.\n\nWith the very volatile nature of the region, Sen Kihn's leadership keeps an ear to the ground as winds blow and sands shift - but to defend the way of life in Sen Kihn was the bottom line. After all - what great feat existed without great effort?"
senkinh_intro.6.a:0 "With neighbors like these..."
senkinh_intro.7.t:0 "A Mad, Mad Orchestra"
senkinh_intro.7.d:0 "Shouting. Barking. Groaning. It was the worst, most discordant orchestra of an otherwise harmonious nation. The Commission of Sages. Sitting at the largest seat was King Rankin, albeit he had no control over this mad choir. This conductor had no baton.\n\n"I'd like to make it clear - it took effort to treat the proposal as anything but a jest." Sighed Fine Print, one of the older members of the Commission. "I wish to remind Marshal An Rokh that we are leading a nation, not an oversized military base. I would also like to remind him this room is the Commission's conference room, not the war room."\n\n"Am I to be shamed for seeking Sen Kihn's strength and sovereignty!?" Marshal An Rokh barked, contrasting her quiet calm. "This isn't Equestria, pony! I'm not going to let Sen Kihn's military become impotent in the face of all the threats looming over the horizon!"\n\nFine Print was so furious that were she a Kirin, she'd become a Nirik. Yet, all she did was flick her glasses. "My passport must be forged then, for spelling 'Equestria' as 'Sen Kinh'. Marshal, I did not know throwing petty insults and tantrums was a way a Sage conducted himself." She calmly spoke. As An Rokh was about to hurl a harsh insult, someone else's shout prevented him.\n\n"CEASE THIS." King Rankin shouted, the fact he chose to act more silencing than the raised voice alone. "I would like to remind you that this proposal does not only count with you two. I see we have differing opinions and I can see some of you can't stand being in this room, but as it stands, everyone here can affect the lives of over four million citizens. Please let's return to doing this the civilized, streamlined way, and you can all get home for supper."\n\nThrough the murmurs, there was an understanding. The dozens of Sages resigned to calm voting. Shouts were replaced by murmurs, and an occasional cough of a parched throat."
senkinh_intro.7.a:0 "He found the baton, for now."

lotus.5.t:0 "The Art of Not Being Governed"
lotus.5.d:0 "Another line of poetry had been brushed down in his magic, on the tattered scroll hanging against the midnight breeze. Blood-red lanterns coloured the near-empty garden like an ancient sunset, marring a patio that hung over a clear-crystal pond. This place of respite reeked of  strong rice alcohol, littered by fallen jewellery and garments indicating a hasty retreat, reminiscent of an overdue new year's festivity.\n\nAgainst a wall of costly timber, two shadows moved, cast by the ambient lights. The palace might as well have been abandoned, devoid of any other presence.\n\nThe one who stood was the kingdom's War Master, overseer of every iron-clad warrior who would lead every creature here out of misery spear by spear, bullet by bullet. Dazed and dejected under his hoof sat the other, the poet-king of all Sen Kinh, the alleged heart of kindness uncovered in one more night of revelling: wooed as many mares as he could acquire with his mastery over the written word, the sheer weight of his position, or the promise of royal booze.\n\nHe'd been caught. Again. That, more than anything, sank his world.\n\n"Enough, Father," rumbled out of War Master An Rokh. "I am governing you, our king, and so reality has been reversed. A fool leads the wise, has been for so long... so all I ask is that you pay heed and watch after your subjects. Be with us while we march together to a slow demise."\n\nAn Rokh walked away, his shadow lengthening until it joined the darkness outside, leaving King Rankin's form to flicker listlessly against the lanterns."

lotus.6.t:0 "In Wisdom's Wake"
lotus.6.d:0 "Vast sunlight funnelled through a hole in the roof, turning into heavenly rays gracing Zeyshan in the Palace of Wisdom, the home of the Council of the Wise. Under the cool shade of miniscule trees, the Council sat, ears turned up to pay attention to his ending spiel. "...this freedom is the basis of all good civilisation. It is only when we are responsible to our own selves and to everyone as a whole can we be liberated, can every single one of our interests be defended from any tyranny!"\n\nHis time up, Zeyshan sat down, back in the shade, letting An Rokh arise to the sunlit spot. "What you suggest again is untenable. When our sovereign and supreme representative is an ever-shifting face, changing sides and cliques every few years, muddying his hooves in petty politicking, what then? The highest and most enviable position of power is cheapened! It can finally be attained by anyone should one have the cut-throat cunning to cheat his way to the throne!"\n\nZeyshan thrust out of his seat, charged into the sunlight. For how long can we be contained by the whim of an unchecked king? I can't—"\n\n"Silence," boomed an arbiter, a bearded kirin coming from the depths of the seats. Zeyshan froze, An Rokh kept stoic. "We have retreaded this old ground very lengthily. It is clear that your points cannot be reconciled with each other, not under this light." To the Council, "You yourselves have had much time to ruminate over these."\n\nWith the sunlit patch evacuated, it would be surrounded by a throng of torn scroll pieces, each detailing an answer and a reason. Not long after, the consensus would be announced through his mouth, to the joy of one and the dismay of another:"

NVA_lotus_6_b_tt:0 "§YWe will follow Zeyshan's brave but dangerous steps, endeavouring to create an ideal harmonious country free from prejudice against any creature.§!\n"  

lotus.7.t:0 "The Beginning of Persistence"
lotus.7.d:0 "Harsh sunlight beamed through the Palace and onto Zeyshan again, fresh off his confirmation as Grand Secretary: a zebra of the creatures, a path to a newer and kinder kingdom—no, a republic. "My esteemed brethren, thank you for your precious decisions! It is clear that our prior rule has devoured our way of life—"\n\n"With what guarantee will yours not do the same?" asked Khandor. His crinkled robed visage made evident his age; the semicircle of leery Wisecreatures made evident his sway; his seeming right-hoof stallion An Rokh himself, his threat.\n\nZeyshan cocked his head. "But have you not voted on me?"\n\n"You've convinced us that the alternative of letting Rankin continue is worse than this. Not much else." A little growl had darkened the mention of his own student.\n\n"The Council must recognise that I've collected enough strands of thought from across the world for the sake of building as perfect of a government as possible—"\n\n"Is our dear Sen Kinh represented in these strands?" Khandor asked. Probably unknown to the old kirin, the faint glow of magic surrounded An Rokh's sword. It shone the War Master's colour, that of eyes trained on Zeyshan—he couldn't have missed it. "Restart here," continued Khandor, "and collect our own creatures' strands of thought before you prove your ideas in the battleground of governance."\n\nThe Council split off prematurely, ending the session. For Zeyshan's part, his heart stirred; the steps down back to the flower-laden entrance had it tremble like in a typhoon. Almost a misstep, almost a trip and a fall flat to the face. His blood on that sword wasn't hard to imagine. A single miscalculation..."
lotus.7.a:0 "Another step forward, he must take."

lotus.8.t:0 "The Noble Parasites"
lotus.8.d:0 "(plot event, medium length, around 300 words)Zeyshan begins to reform the kingdom's political system, replacing the old bureaucrats with new republicans.\n\nScene one, in a teahouse, Zeyshan talks with the 'advocate', the leader of the communist party (throught the even, the 'advocate' just sits there, listening and nodding to Zeyshan's words, sometimes he would talk, but not much, no need to give the advocate detailed descriptions). \n\nZeyshan explains that the old seniors and lords in the system have become a parasite class that drinks blood from both people and the nation, and thus, they must be replace by new blood. To establish a republic and waken the people, the country must do it step by step, and the first thing they should do, is reforming the old bureaucrats.\n\nScene two, the advocate agrees, and said even if their ideologies are completely different, they are still friends and have a lot in common, especially in dealing with the noble parasites"
lotus.8.a:0 "New blood, new future."

lotus.9.t:0 "Golden Liberty"
lotus.9.d:0 "Rankin looked at the text before him, eyes dashing left and right. Not that he cared about what was written, he merely tried to look interested.\n\n"Your Majesty." Zeyshan coughed. "We need to make sure you understand the terms. Could you please read back the four points of the King’s Articles?"\n\nRankin folded his hooves. "One - the state is a republic under the presidency of the King, in which he will reign, but shall not govern. Two - The Council of the Wise shall directly govern the state, and the election of its members cannot be influenced by the King. Three - Political Rights may only be held by councilors and senior noble conservatives. Four - All councilors, whether republican or noble conservatives, shall be equal on all rights."\n\nZeyshan smiled, hiding his tension behind manners and good will. "Perfect, Your Majesty. Now, I ask you to sign it." He said, placing the scroll on the table ahead of Rankin.  The king looked at the paper skeptically, then at Zeyshan. It all happened like a shot at the doctor’s - quick, and over before it was expected. Just like that, Rankin ran his quill across the bottom of the document. Zeyshan blinked in surprise.\n\n"...What?" Rankin scoffed at the Zebra, rolling the scroll up before hoofing it over to him. "Oh. Surprised? Heh. You’re the one who’s willingly taking the weight off my shoulders. I only read the paper to make sure you didn’t give me more responsibilities." The king smiled, leaning back in his seat. "It is a curse, having government power. Take it, be my guest. I’ve been buried in administrative work and papers. If you think the Wise can lead Sen Kinh better, try your luck. Either way, you’ve helped me focus more on my muse." He said…then frowned. "And you’ve also taken my time. Leave - I’m onto a very good verse…Servants! I need a cup of wine now before my inspiration wanes!"\n\nZeyshan picked up the scroll, and silently left Rankin to his poetry. As the Zebra walked through the hallways of the palace, he was deep in thought. It didn’t feel like a total victory. Even if Rankin could no longer dictate Sen Kihn, the power was still far from the hooves of the common folk. A monarchy was traded for an oligarchy tonight. But progress was progress. Stepping out through the gates of the palace, Zeyshan fondly looked at the sun. Sen Kihn was a step closer to becoming a true, democratic republic."
lotus.9.a:0 "The residence behind his garden wall is the King's equal."

lotus.10.t:0 "Father's Favourite Son"
lotus.10.d:0 "Rankin raised his cup, smiling proudly at the guests. The grand feast was in full swing, and all the important figures of Sen Kinh reveled. "A moment, everyone!" Rankin exclaimed. The guests turned to him, silent and letting the king speak. "I'd like to make a toast! To a young, good lad! The most brilliant, bravest War Master of Sen Kinh! I could not have asked for a greater son. To you, An Rokh!"\n\nProudly smiling at the attention, An Rokh raised his chin, and the guests around him raised their cups with cheers, before taking hearty gulps. Then, a familiar figure approached. "Zeyshan!" An Rokh smirked. "What brings you to my side of the table?"\n\n "Good tidings, An Rokh. You look energetic as always. As for why I'm here..." Zeyshan leaned in close. "We have to talk. I see you’re enjoying being called “warmaster”, but you’re a grown Kirin now. This is the adult world, so we’re doing things seriously now. These little political ‘games’ you’re playing? They’re done the moment you get up from this chair. You’re no longer going to involve yourself in the politics of Sen Kinh. You can stay a military leader, but you don’t get to tell our people how to live. You can forget your idea of turning our country into your personal plaything." \n\nThe whole time, An Rokh stared at him with wide, bewildered - and furious eyes. "Zeyshan, do you have any idea who you are talking to? My father will--"\n\nZeyshan only needed to gesture to Rankin, who happily ate and drank his worries away, Khandor looking no more interested in An Rokh than his adoptive father was. While An Rohk stared in disbelief, Zeyshan whispered in his ear. "Before you go Nirik, know this - you can kill me any time you want, or not accept my demands. But if you do that, if you do not stand down when Sen Kinh needs the peace and harmony it deserves, you are done. Maybe your plane will crash. Maybe a meal will be your last. Maybe one night you’ll fall asleep, never to wake up. Do you understand?"\n\n Silently, nervously...An Rokh shakily nodded. Zeyshan's deep stare turned into a kind smile. "Wonderful. I hope you enjoy the feast, An Rokh! Our chefs really did amazingly tonight, didn't they?"

Considering the nation is undergo a reform, the kingdom's old law system needs time to be reformed. Thus, to keep the stability and avoid unexpected Nirik transformations, the old laws will all be removed and there will only have three basic standards that all creatures must follow: 1. creatures who kill others must be slained too; 2. creatures who hurt or steal others must pay the same amount money for their crime; 3. No racism, all creatures must be treated equally and not get judged by their blood."

Then suddenly, an argument disrupts them. Two Kirin are criticizing one zebra who shares the same table with them because they don't want to sit with a different creature. Zeyshan quietly comments with the 'advocate' that he's quite worried about such racism actions or prejudices during the ethnic reform.\n\nScene two, a Kirin kid who aged 7 interrupts Zeyshan's murmuring. After witnessing the argument, the kid asks his mother why zebras are different from them. His mother answers that the gods created different shaped creatures to make the world more lively, so they shouldn't make prejudices on creatures who are different from them. After seeing this, Zeyshan is relieved and he believes though there will be obstacles, the futures is bright. "

In the later 500 years, the influence of Metrots kept expanding as more and more Zebras and Kirin walked into each other's lives. It was the magic of love and tolerance that made everything possible. Once in a while, Metrot was just one of ethnic minorities, but as time went by, it's more likely to be an universal concept instead of one single ethnicity. For now, every creature can identify themselves as one Metrot as long as they believe in the concept of Metrots. Thus, by expanding the identity of Metrots, we're able to unite more ethnicities together."

lotus.34.d:0 "I'm sorry," Zeyshan choked out, letting go of an orphan filly. Depleted farms and villlages with never enough hooves on the field, overpopulated cities vomiting smog to a crowd of poor, armies of widows and orphans,: this was the Grand Gallop Onward's masterpiece. The simple carriage trip to Vermilion felt insanely rich when conditions on the ground shouted out the pain of an entire Realm uprooted from its shell, spat into the wider world with only hope on top, backstabbing underneath.\n\n"Who did the Matriarch assemble?" he had mentioned in passing not long ago. "A hermit monk scared at anything more advanced than a fork, a foreigner businesskirin content with turning Kiria into a national sweatshop, a wayward priestess who'd 'purify' her revolution through any means possible... and who headed these three? An idealist untouched by experience. No wonder..."\n\nSuch reminiscing left him once the Vermilion Palace came into view. Metal mutedly clashed against metal; the city's old guards, faithful to the Matriarch, were resigned to join Concord soon in a good death. That Sen Kinh would send them there, Zeyshan had no answers to, not for him nor for the train of kirin that had followed him like a mystery to chase. They could not be ignored.\n\nHe hopped off the carriage, ready for a swarm of kirin hungry for answers. "If you are expecting some grandiose speech, now is not the time!" He took the robe around his head off and waved it, a sign of some courtesy, some greeting. The reply was a modest, unsure wave of cheers from humble bungalows to sky-high balconies. "A sensible government is what this realm needs! Let us dream, but let us not overstep ourselves! Have a good day, and I will see you again shortly!"

Huts had imitated the splendour of the former capital's architecture, culminating in a noodle bar that, for all its humble service in feeding mouths and nothing more, resembled the Matriarchs' palace. Not that that would stop a head of state from occupying this place, juggling noodle-slurping, report-reading, and question-taking from the locals who'd never seen a "savage" before, much less one well dressed as this zebra here.\n\n A not-so-elderly stallion poked him with a stick. "And what exactly is your plan here, young one?" His eyes on the noodles conveyed hurt pride: some foreigner eating their food..."This land," this Zeyshan said, letting go of his documents, "it is huge, very diverse. Many tongues speak and sing here, telling of many respectable cultures... so when we are so diverse, what do we stand for? Ah, I should've asked... what is your name, sir?"\n\n"Brist, but if I may?" He coughed, perhaps to get everyone else's attention. The slurps stopped. "We've lived here for so long... from before we settled, from before the Kirian Realm, this was our realm. Long before the Way of Fire, the Matriarch, we had each other. Each other and our precious Mellifluve."\n\nRecognition found itself in Zeyshan's eyes. They glimmered. "I've been looking for a name for this new country of ours, actually, but now that you've mentioned it, how far does the Mellifluve extend?"\n\n"Oh, from the Cradle of Kirinity to..."\n\nThe name of "Zaikiria" needed not be said.

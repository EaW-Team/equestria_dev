### Starting tree focuses ####

NVA_BEGIN:0 "South Of Mellifluve"
NVA_BEGIN_desc:0 "In the southern land the Vermillion Dynasty failed to conquer, there lived a hundred tribes and city-states. Even as their nations faced repeated destruction and reconstruction over numerous invasions, the creatures of the South persisted in resistance, where their identity was born."
NVA_INTRO:0 "The Crown Of Lotus"
NVA_INTRO_desc:0 "As the capital of Sen Kinh and the most powerful city-state among the Zaikirians, Lotus once led the ancient Kingdom of Baiyan. Even now, long after the fall of Baiyan, Lotus's pervasive influence continues to assert dominance over Sen Kinh. The Lotus King rules the kingdom on his throne, for now, and perhaps, forever."
NVA_politicy_intro:0 "Political Upheavals"
NVA_politicy_intro_desc:0 "With the new millennium, the political situation of the kingdom has changed. With the newly crowned King Rankin displaying a lack of care for actual governance, various factions have begun to move. Power struggles, endless bribes and damaged administration systems might push Sen Kinh off the deep end."
NVA_milita_economoy_intro:0 "The Paused Industrialization"
NVA_milita_economoy_intro_desc:0 "Sen Kinh had started its industrialization by accepting those intellectuals and capitalists who escaped from Kiria and its Silence. Unfortunately, the issues of land enclosure as well as a severe lack of resources has torpedoed the kingdom's efforts."
NVA_culture_intro:0 "A Multinational State"
NVA_culture_intro_desc:0 "Throughout the reign of Baiyan and its successor state of Sen Kinh, pluralism characterized the fabric of society here. On one hoof, this diversity embraces bright minds from everywhere; on the other hoof, this same diversity can and has prevented Sen Kinh from taking decisive action."
NVA_delegate_from_vermilion:0 "A Dying Kingdom"
NVA_delegate_from_vermilion_desc:0 "Political turmoil, economic downturn, and cultural clashes chip away at this dear kingdom. Classes and ethnicities have been proven unable to reach any sort of sufficient compromise. We must find a way to save our country from the endless chaos before it's too late."
NVA_choose_path:0 "First Meeting Of The New Year"
NVA_choose_path_desc:0 "It is the royal court's first meeting of the new year. Chances are, it may also be the last. The words of the King and the Council of Wise here will set the stage for Sen Kinh's future, for glory or for tragedy."


### Zeyshan's path ####

NVA_blossom_path:0 "Lonesome Road" 
NVA_blossom_path_desc:0 "We have made our choice: the untrustworthy king leaves his domain in turmoil, letting the Council of Wise step in to pick up the pieces. As the chancellor of the Council, Zeyshan will transform Sen Kinh into a modern beacon of freedom and equality through the magic of friendship and a true heart of kindness."
NVA_blossom_politik_reform:0 "Political Reformation" 
NVA_blossom_politik_reform_desc:0 "The king has always been the linchpin of the kingdom's political apparatus. With the central government Lotus now headless, Sen Kinh's bureaucracy has been torn asunder. A reorganisation of as many ministries and departments is in order." 
NVA_blossom_weak_the_king:0 "Weaken The Monarch" 
NVA_blossom_weak_the_king_desc:0 "Though we have already taken most of Rankin's power, the title of King remains with him - as does formal ownership of our nation. We cannot allow his crown to bear any weight that could bar us from our dream of a better, peaceful, and united Sen Kinh. Let us review the legal code, and draw the line of a monarch's power."
NVA_blossom_weaken_generals:0 "Army Reorganisation" 
NVA_blossom_weaken_generals_desc:0 "Following the resolution with King Rankin, we must turn to the matter of his adopted son, An Rokh the War Master. His power grants him leadership of perhaps half of our army - and were he to betray us - it would cost Sen Kinh heavily. Let us have a talk with him, and set our army straight." 
NVA_blossom_reform_council:0 "Rectify The Council of The Wise" 
NVA_blossom_reform_council_desc:0 "The Council of The Wise originates from the aristocratic democracy of the Baiyan Kingdom. Wisdom, however, also lies in the diversity of ideas and perspectives. More brilliant minds from more corners of the world must become part of this Council - for Sen Kihn is for all, not for one." 
NVA_blossom_get_laws:0 "The Three Standards" 
NVA_blossom_get_laws_desc:0 "The current law system is a complex and perhaps haphazard amalgamation of the Kingdom's old legal system, the chaotic statute law, and the customary laws. It will take time to discuss, draft, and implement a more streamlined, comphrenesible, modern law system. Until then, we shall give Sen Kinh three standard rules to stabilize society." 
NVA_blossom_economi_reform:0 "Save Our Pockets" 
NVA_blossom_economi_reform_desc:0 "Money is not everything, yet we cannot live without it. Financial stability is a must, along with it being an attractive promise, a tangible catalyst of hope for many. As such, we must multiply the cogs of our growing industry, consolidate our disparate resources into manageable companies and co-operatives." 
NVA_blossom_domestic_development:0 "Self Reliance" 
NVA_blossom_domestic_development_desc:0 "How can we enter the lucrative global market when we have nothing to bargain with? The southern lands provide our answer: teeming with soil untouched by modern-day machinery, there is bound to be a bounty for us to uncover… and should we fail, we can at least prop our own economy up with the fruits of this initiative." 
NVA_blossom_international_trade:0 "Revive Naval Trade" 
NVA_blossom_international_trade_desc:0 "From before Kiria's Silence, Blossom maintained favourable trade with the many nations of Griffonia. This aquatic "Road of Blossom" once brought us great fortune, and while it has certainly declined, nothing is stopping us from sending our ships along it once more to reconnect with the wider world." 
NVA_blossom_stable_economi:0 "Stabilize The Economy" 
NVA_blossom_stable_economi_desc:0 "Our economy's exemplary recovery has delivered Sen Kinh from the brink. While the economy is only one facet of the many issues that plague the kingdom, we can rest easy today, for every creature here need not fear a recession. Their hard-earned funds are safe." 
NVA_blossom_revive_manufacto:0 "Manufacturing Revival" 
NVA_blossom_revive_manufacto_desc:0 "Lotus and Blossom were projected to reach the status of world-class ports, heralding cargo and traders from across the continents, bolstered by a complex of brand-new factory districts to cope with substantial demand. That sadly did not come to fruition, but the plans are still lying around here somewhere, ready to realize a manufacturing giant." 
NVA_blossom_bread_basket:0 "Bread Basket Of East" 
NVA_blossom_bread_basket_desc:0 "As 80% of our land is fertile and capable of producing food, we are no doubt the rice basket of the East. However, sickles and shovels can only get our farmers so far. Introducing our farms and paddies to modern farming machinery will unlock the full potential of our bountiful land." 
NVA_blossom_employment_armia:0 "Get Yourself A Job" 
NVA_blossom_employment_armia_desc:0 "Work is a crucial aspect of life in a functional society, and fabricating the national employment rate like Rankin's government did to avoid shame is not the way. Putting effort into bolstering our employment and military recruitment rate will provide us with real numbers we can be proud of." 
NVA_blossom_cultural_reform:0 "Ethnicity Issues" 
NVA_blossom_cultural_reform_desc:0 "While Kirin constitute the majority in Sen Kinh, our land is home to many other minority races and ethnicities. By launching educational programs, media campaigns, and cultural events, we will show the value of harmony in diversity. Let the rainbows above our valleys be a reminder that Sen Kinh's soul cannot be painted with one colour." 
NVA_blossom_expand_metrot:0 "Rely On Metrots" 
NVA_blossom_expand_metrot_desc:0 "Originally, the term "Metrot" referred to Kirin and Zebra who united their lifestyles and cultures into one synergetic group. However, if we redefine the term and bring more minorities into the fold, we may increase the cohesion of our diverse society." 
NVA_blossom_do_nothing_plz:0 "Doing Nothing Is Doing Everything" 
NVA_blossom_do_nothing_plz_desc:0 "The Kingdom has kept the diversity of its ethnicities for centuries - yet, the government never had to enforce their coexistence, nor will it have to. Sen Kihn's creatures have their own way to live and solve problems, and there is no need for the state to intervene." 
NVA_blossom_stable_culture_conflicts:0 "Transfer The conflicts" 
NVA_blossom_stable_culture_conflicts_desc:0 "While our efforts have yielded significant results, there are many matters that can only be solved by waiting. However, time is a luxury we cannot afford. To unite and strengthen our diverse population, we will seek a common problem - or enemy - that no citizen of Sen Kinh will feel indifferent towards." 
NVA_blossom_migration_issues:0 "Immigration And Refugees" 
NVA_blossom_migration_issues_desc:0 "Sen Kinh may not have many immigrants at the moment, but we cannot ignore someone merely because they're an outsider. Guided by the teachings of the Scrolls of the Elders, we are reminded to care for everyone - whether or not they were born on the same land as us. These folk have chosen Sen Kinh as their home, and they are now our family." 
NVA_blossom_generation_gap:0 "New Culture Movement" 
NVA_blossom_generation_gap_desc:0 "Industrialization is more than construction and production - it is a matter of education and knowledge. Thus, to bolster this process, we must expand our educational system. A more intelligent population not only helps advance our industry, but so will it advance our society as a whole." 
NVA_blossom_religion_issues:0 "The Difficulty of Religious Diversity" 
NVA_blossom_religion_issues_desc:0 "Freedom of religion has always been protected within our borders since Baiyan's time. Such a buffet of faiths can be a source of confusion, as everyone's paths to kindness may crisscross or contradict with one another. A set of guidelines may, at least, keep everything cohesive for now." 
NVA_blossom_pre_consitution:0 "Prepare For A Constitution" 
NVA_blossom_pre_consitution_desc:0 "Though without a king, Sen Kinh remains a kingdom. The vestiges of the monarchy flail about headlessly, the imperial court hoping to hold out against the tide of change. They can do so unless we write into law the kingdom's abolishment." 
NVA_blossom_safe_for_now:0 "We are Safe, For Now" 
NVA_blossom_safe_for_now_desc:0 "Before empires existed, our ancestors breathed free and co-operated with one another as capable creatures. While much has changed in the millennia since, that spirit of liberty has blossomed today, rescued from the clutches of control. From this centre of freedom shall we enlighten our neighbours across the blessed hills and beyond." 


NVA_blossom_conquer_west:0 "A Journey To The West"
NVA_blossom_conquer_west_desc:0 "Throughout history, tyrannical powers gained their territory by conquering smaller, divided nations. Sen Kinh and Khamrin are under the constant threat of invasion. If Zaikiria as a whole wishes to strand strong against tyranny, then first we must seek total unity and co-operation."
NVA_blossom_conquer_khamer:0 "Our Southern Brother"
NVA_blossom_conquer_khamer_desc:0 "Khamrin is one of the city-states to gain its independence after the fall of the Baiyan Kingdom. Unlike Lan Kir, we have much in common with Khamrin, such as our history and our relationship. It should be no surprise then that many citizens are calling for a personal union with our southern brother."
NVA_blossom_conquer_lankir:0 "Put Down The Horde"
NVA_blossom_conquer_lankir_desc:0 "Following Vermillion's retreat from Zaikiria, the old Banners occupied Lan Kir and established their brutal reign on the land. The bandits have been raiding us for many years, bringing sorrow to many families. It's time to free our siblings in Lan Kir from the tyranny of the Twenty Banners."
NVA_blossom_reclaim_baiyan:0 "Strength Of A Hundred"
NVA_blossom_reclaim_baiyan_desc:0 "Since 500 ALB, our northern territory has been lost, and our children there had to live under foreign rule for hundreds of years. The 'Azure Hollow', once called 'Kerin County', is the last missing part of our motherland. It is time to reconnect our descendants with their home."
NVA_blossom_core_zaikiria:0 "13 Provinces Of Zaikiria"
NVA_blossom_core_zaikiria_desc:0 "The first king of the Baiyan Kingdom established a provincial system based on the 100 Zaikirian tribes that existed at the time. After centuries of chaos, Zaikiria is once again united by the successors of Baiyan, and we finally have the chance to modernize this ancient, administrative system."
NVA_blossom_get_resource:0 "Provincial System Improvements"
NVA_blossom_get_resource_desc:0 "The ancient system based on the thirteen provinces is useful and sustainable - yet, it cannot keep up with the peace of our central government's needs as we unite more of Zaikiria, and face new issues. As we head towards modernization, the provincial system must be revised accordingly to modern needs."
NVA_blossom_get_factories_from_friends:0 "Allies From The West"
NVA_blossom_get_factories_from_friends_desc:0 "For a long time, the resources of West Zaikiria were locked away behind treacherous mountains and terrain. Now, with modern machinery, reaching the West is no longer a pipe dream. Our industry will benefit from such a boon."
NVA_blossom_get_faction:0 "The Art Of Politics"
NVA_blossom_get_faction_desc:0 "A teaching in the Scrolls of The Elders states: 'Befriend those far away, while you fight those nearby'. There's no telling how Kiria will react to us reaching out to nations further West, but there is wisdom in the Scrolls. We must ally with them - one way...or another."
NVA_blossom_faction_zeblu:0 "The Spear Of Zeblu"
NVA_blossom_faction_zeblu_desc:0 "The Zebluans are great, and noble warriors. If the going gets tough, having such an ally standing by our side would be paramount. However, seeking this alliance entices both risk and reward, so we must be prepared for any outcome - even conflict."
NVA_blossom_faction_zongo:0 "The Power Of Faith"
NVA_blossom_faction_zongo_desc:0 "The Zongolese are faithful and peaceful creatures, but they are also able to protect their way of life, and are known to triumph against any threat that challenges their existence. An alliance between us shall be established on common faith, rather than conflict."
NVA_blossom_faction_kaiser:0 "The House Always Wins"
NVA_blossom_faction_kaiser_desc:0 "Kaiser Augustus Umqobi, a naive zebra who thought himself to be Kaiser, a humorous nod to the Griffons. We've sent a courier to him, with the message that he has one last chance to cease this offensive cosplay. Let's hope that not even the world's strongest headache will stop this courier."
NVA_blossom_faction_stronk:0 "In Harmony, We Unite"
NVA_blossom_faction_stronk_desc:0 "We've made great strides journeying West, and many new ethnicities have become part of our nation. Unfortunately, not all agree with our reign. Our mission as of this moment is to prove to them that Sen Kinh is an open-minded nation, one that welcomes all, and treats all kindness."
NVA_blossom_republik_thoughts:0 "Not A Wise King"
NVA_blossom_republik_thoughts_desc:0 "Were all kings wise, there'd be no need for republics. Fortunately for us, Rankin is anything but wise. However, the Senkinese have gotten used to being led by some “saint” for centuries, and that contradicts democratic thought. It is time to show that the people are masters of their own fate - not some king, no matter how wise he may be."
NVA_blossom_the_way_to_republik:0 "Towards The Republic"
NVA_blossom_the_way_to_republik_desc:0 "It is long overdue for us to form a republic - not only because the monarchy restrains out potential, but because this is the way for a brighter and more hopeful future for all. The road to a republic may be long and arduous, and many issues will need addressing - but what great feats have been achieved easily? 'Step by step, I'm sure the dream of a real republic will come true', Zeyshan said."
NVA_blossom_remove_king:0 "For The Good Of All"
NVA_blossom_remove_king_desc:0 "Hypocrites have justified history's greatest atrocities with a simple phrase - 'For the good of all'. We, however, are going to prove that we understand, and value the true meaning of this statement. Sen Kihn shall be for everyone - a land free of prejudice. For the good of all!"
NVA_blossom_threat_from_north:0 "Threat From The North "
NVA_blossom_threat_from_north_desc:0 "We've taken notice of the Grand Gallop Onwards, a project of our northern neighbor. Kiria is gathering its strength, now that it has been freed from the chains of Silence. Once again, there is a growing fear in Zaikiria over the threat of conquest. We must plan our measures accordingly."
NVA_blossom_slow_the_steps:0 "Slow The Reforms"
NVA_blossom_slow_the_steps_desc:0 "Without the restraint of the Silence, the modernizing Kiria has become a greater threat to Zaikiria than ever before. To protect our newborn republic from this threat we must, unfortunately, abate our reforms, and focus on our ability to defend ourselves first."
NVA_blossom_march_north:0 "To The North"
NVA_blossom_march_north_desc:0 "Our troops take the rifles. They sit behind the wheels of war machines. They march north, to Mellifluve. This fight is not for glory. This is for our families, our home. This battle is one we cannot afford to lose. We must stand together, or not at all."
NVA_blossom_win_north:0 "Cleave The Waves"
NVA_blossom_win_north_desc:0 "Victory, the glory for which we've given our all. The children of Baiyan have reclaimed their land, and their honour. The battle of the century is finally over. We've proven to the world and to history - that glory can be brought not by an iron fist, but a heart of kindness!"

lotus.5.t:0 "The Art of Not Being Governed"
lotus.5.d:0 "Another line of poetry had been brushed down in his magic, on the tattered scroll hanging against the midnight breeze. Blood-red lanterns coloured the near-empty garden like an ancient sunset, marring a patio that hung over a clear-crystal pond. This place of respite reeked of  strong rice alcohol, littered by fallen jewellery and garments indicating a hasty retreat, reminiscent of an overdue new year's festivity.\n\nAgainst a wall of costly timber, two shadows moved, cast by the ambient lights. The palace might as well have been abandoned, devoid of any other presence.\n\nThe one who stood was the kingdom's War Master, overseer of every iron-clad warrior who would lead every creature here out of misery spear by spear, bullet by bullet. Dazed and dejected under his hoof sat the other, the poet-king of all Sen Kinh, the alleged heart of kindness uncovered in one more night of revelling: wooed as many mares as he could acquire with his mastery over the written word, the sheer weight of his position, or the promise of royal booze.\n\nHe'd been caught. Again. That, more than anything, sank his world.\n\n"Enough, Father," rumbled out of War Master An Rokh. "I am governing you, our king, and so reality has been reversed. A fool leads the wise, has been for so long... so all I ask is that you pay heed and watch after your subjects. Be with us while we march together to a slow demise."\n\nAn Rokh walked away, his shadow lengthening until it joined the darkness outside, leaving King Rankin's form to flicker listlessly against the lanterns."
lotus.5.a:0 "Walled off from a life of virtue."
NVA_lotus_5_a_tt:0 "§RWho knows whether the prodigal son will return?§!\n"

lotus.6.t:0 "In Wisdom's Wake"
lotus.6.d:0 "Vast sunlight funnelled through a hole in the roof, turning into heavenly rays gracing Zeyshan in the Palace of Wisdom, the home of the Council of the Wise. Under the cool shade of miniscule trees, the Council sat, ears turned up to pay attention to his ending spiel. "...this freedom is the basis of all good civilisation. It is only when we are responsible to our own selves and to everyone as a whole can we be liberated, can every single one of our interests be defended from any tyranny!"\n\nHis time up, Zeyshan sat down, back in the shade, letting An Rokh arise to the sunlit spot. "What you suggest again is untenable. When our sovereign and supreme representative is an ever-shifting face, changing sides and cliques every few years, muddying his hooves in petty politicking, what then? The highest and most enviable position of power is cheapened! It can finally be attained by anyone should one have the cut-throat cunning to cheat his way to the throne!"\n\nZeyshan thrust out of his seat, charged into the sunlight. For how long can we be contained by the whim of an unchecked king? I can't—"\n\n"Silence," boomed an arbiter, a bearded kirin coming from the depths of the seats. Zeyshan froze, An Rokh kept stoic. "We have retreaded this old ground very lengthily. It is clear that your points cannot be reconciled with each other, not under this light." To the Council, "You yourselves have had much time to ruminate over these."\n\nWith the sunlit patch evacuated, it would be surrounded by a throng of torn scroll pieces, each detailing an answer and a reason. Not long after, the consensus would be announced through his mouth, to the joy of one and the dismay of another:"
lotus.6.a:0 "'The king will soon enlighten us.'"
lotus.6.b:0 "'Radiant will be the light of a new state.'"
NVA_lotus_6_b_tt:0 "§YWe will follow Zeyshan's brave but dangerous steps, endeavouring to create an ideal harmonious country free from prejudice against any creature.§!\n"  

lotus.7.t:0 "The Beginning of Persistence"
lotus.7.d:0 "Harsh sunlight beamed through the Palace and onto Zeyshan again, fresh off his confirmation as Grand Secretary: a zebra of the creatures, a path to a newer and kinder kingdom—no, a republic. "My esteemed brethren, thank you for your precious decisions! It is clear that our prior rule has devoured our way of life—"\n\n"With what guarantee will yours not do the same?" asked Khandor. His crinkled robed visage made evident his age; the semicircle of leery Wisecreatures made evident his sway; his seeming right-hoof stallion An Rokh himself, his threat.\n\nZeyshan cocked his head. "But have you not voted on me?"\n\n"You've convinced us that the alternative of letting Rankin continue is worse than this. Not much else." A little growl had darkened the mention of his own student.\n\n"The Council must recognise that I've collected enough strands of thought from across the world for the sake of building as perfect of a government as possible—"\n\n"Is our dear Sen Kinh represented in these strands?" Khandor asked. Probably unknown to the old kirin, the faint glow of magic surrounded An Rokh's sword. It shone the War Master's colour, that of eyes trained on Zeyshan—he couldn't have missed it. "Restart here," continued Khandor, "and collect our own creatures' strands of thought before you prove your ideas in the battleground of governance."\n\nThe Council split off prematurely, ending the session. For Zeyshan's part, his heart stirred; the steps down back to the flower-laden entrance had it tremble like in a typhoon. Almost a misstep, almost a trip and a fall flat to the face. His blood on that sword wasn't hard to imagine. A single miscalculation..."
lotus.7.a:0 "Another step forward, he must take."

lotus.8.t:0 "The Noble Parasites"
lotus.8.d:0 "(plot event, medium length, around 300 words)Zeyshan begins to reform the kingdom's political system, replacing the old bureaucrats with new republicans.\n\nScene one, in a teahouse, Zeyshan talks with the 'advocate', the leader of the communist party (throught the even, the 'advocate' just sits there, listening and nodding to Zeyshan's words, sometimes he would talk, but not much, no need to give the advocate detailed descriptions). \n\nZeyshan explains that the old seniors and lords in the system have become a parasite class that drinks blood from both people and the nation, and thus, they must be replace by new blood. To establish a republic and waken the people, the country must do it step by step, and the first thing they should do, is reforming the old bureaucrats.\n\nScene two, the advocate agrees, and said even if their ideologies are completely different, they are still friends and have a lot in common, especially in dealing with the noble parasites"
lotus.8.a:0 "New blood, new future."

lotus.9.t:0 "Golden Liberty"
lotus.9.d:0 "Rankin looked at the text before him, eyes dashing left and right. Not that he cared about what was written, he merely tried to look interested.\n\n"Your Majesty." Zeyshan coughed. "We need to make sure you understand the terms. Could you please read back the four points of the King’s Articles?"\n\nRankin folded his hooves. "One - the state is a republic under the presidency of the King, in which he will reign, but shall not govern. Two - The Council of the Wise shall directly govern the state, and the election of its members cannot be influenced by the King. Three - Political Rights may only be held by councilors and senior noble conservatives. Four - All councilors, whether republican or noble conservatives, shall be equal on all rights."\n\nZeyshan smiled, hiding his tension behind manners and good will. "Perfect, Your Majesty. Now, I ask you to sign it." He said, placing the scroll on the table ahead of Rankin.  The king looked at the paper skeptically, then at Zeyshan. It all happened like a shot at the doctor’s - quick, and over before it was expected. Just like that, Rankin ran his quill across the bottom of the document. Zeyshan blinked in surprise.\n\n"...What?" Rankin scoffed at the Zebra, rolling the scroll up before hoofing it over to him. "Oh. Surprised? Heh. You’re the one who’s willingly taking the weight off my shoulders. I only read the paper to make sure you didn’t give me more responsibilities." The king smiled, leaning back in his seat. "It is a curse, having government power. Take it, be my guest. I’ve been buried in administrative work and papers. If you think the Wise can lead Sen Kinh better, try your luck. Either way, you’ve helped me focus more on my muse." He said…then frowned. "And you’ve also taken my time. Leave - I’m onto a very good verse…Servants! I need a cup of wine now before my inspiration wanes!"\n\nZeyshan picked up the scroll, and silently left Rankin to his poetry. As the Zebra walked through the hallways of the palace, he was deep in thought. It didn’t feel like a total victory. Even if Rankin could no longer dictate Sen Kihn, the power was still far from the hooves of the common folk. A monarchy was traded for an oligarchy tonight. But progress was progress. Stepping out through the gates of the palace, Zeyshan fondly looked at the sun. Sen Kihn was a step closer to becoming a true, democratic republic."
lotus.9.a:0 "The residence behind his garden wall is the King's equal."

lotus.10.t:0 "Father's Favourite Son"
lotus.10.d:0 "Rankin raised his cup, smiling proudly at the guests. The grand feast was in full swing, and all the important figures of Sen Kinh reveled. "A moment, everyone!" Rankin exclaimed. The guests turned to him, silent and letting the king speak. "I'd like to make a toast! To a young, good lad! The most brilliant, bravest War Master of Sen Kinh! I could not have asked for a greater son. To you, An Rokh!"\n\nProudly smiling at the attention, An Rokh raised his chin, and the guests around him raised their cups with cheers, before taking hearty gulps. Then, a familiar figure approached. "Zeyshan!" An Rokh smirked. "What brings you to my side of the table?"\n\n "Good tidings, An Rokh. You look energetic as always. As for why I'm here..." Zeyshan leaned in close. "We have to talk. I see you’re enjoying being called “warmaster”, but you’re a grown Kirin now. This is the adult world, so we’re doing things seriously now. These little political ‘games’ you’re playing? They’re done the moment you get up from this chair. You’re no longer going to involve yourself in the politics of Sen Kinh. You can stay a military leader, but you don’t get to tell our people how to live. You can forget your idea of turning our country into your personal plaything." \n\nThe whole time, An Rokh stared at him with wide, bewildered - and furious eyes. "Zeyshan, do you have any idea who you are talking to? My father will--"\n\nZeyshan only needed to gesture to Rankin, who happily ate and drank his worries away, Khandor looking no more interested in An Rokh than his adoptive father was. While An Rohk stared in disbelief, Zeyshan whispered in his ear. "Before you go Nirik, know this - you can kill me any time you want, or not accept my demands. But if you do that, if you do not stand down when Sen Kinh needs the peace and harmony it deserves, you are done. Maybe your plane will crash. Maybe a meal will be your last. Maybe one night you’ll fall asleep, never to wake up. Do you understand?"\n\n Silently, nervously...An Rokh shakily nodded. Zeyshan's deep stare turned into a kind smile. "Wonderful. I hope you enjoy the feast, An Rokh! Our chefs really did amazingly tonight, didn't they?"

lotus.12.t:0 "Control Your Temper"
lotus.12.d:0 "(flavour event, short, around 200 words) On the plaza of Blossom city, Zeyshan speaks to the people.Scene one, Zeyshan stands on the stage and attracts a lot of creatures, Kirin, zebras and even a few griffons and ponies.\n\nScene two, Zeyshan delivers a speech about the laws. Considering the nation is undergo a reform, the kingdom's old law system needs time to be reformed. Thus, to keep the stability and avoid unexpected Nirik transformations, the old laws will all be removed and there will only have three basic standards that all creatures must follow: 1. creatures who kill others must be slained too; 2. creatures who hurt or steal others must pay the same amount money for their crime; 3. No racism, all creatures must be treated equally and not get judged by their blood."

lotus.13.d:0 "(flavour event, medium length, around 200 words) In a crowded teahouse, Zeyshan discusses the upcoming ethnicity policy reform with the 'advocate'.\n\nScene one, Zeyshan and the 'advocate' enjoys their hot Longjing tea. Then suddenly, an argument disrupts them. Two Kirin are criticizing one zebra who shares the same table with them because they don't want to sit with a different creature. Zeyshan quietly comments with the 'advocate' that he's quite worried about such racism actions or prejudices during the ethnic reform.\n\nScene two, a Kirin kid who aged 7 interrupts Zeyshan's murmuring. After witnessing the argument, the kid asks his mother why zebras are different from them. His mother answers that the gods created different shaped creatures to make the world more lively, so they shouldn't make prejudices on creatures who are different from them. After seeing this, Zeyshan is relieved and he believes though there will be obstacles, the futures is bright. "

lotus.14.d:0 "(flavour event, short, around 150 words, pure narration) The Metrot community had existed long before the establishment of Baiyan Kingdom in 500 ALB. In the later 500 years, the influence of Metrots kept expanding as more and more Zebras and Kirin walked into each other's lives. It was the magic of love and tolerance that made everything possible. Once in a while, Metrot was just one of ethnic minorities, but as time went by, it's more likely to be an universal concept instead of one single ethnicity. For now, every creature can identify themselves as one Metrot as long as they believe in the concept of Metrots. Thus, by expanding the identity of Metrots, we're able to unite more ethnicities together."

The Scrolls of the Elders forms a government of caring and guiding, not reigning or suppressing. Just like our elders, we are here to care for everyone, not asking them to obey strict rules.

lotus.34.t:0 "Jaded Vermillion"
lotus.34.d:0 "I'm sorry," Zeyshan choked out, letting go of an orphan filly. Depleted farms and villlages with never enough hooves on the field, overpopulated cities vomiting smog to a crowd of poor, armies of widows and orphans,: this was the Grand Gallop Onward's masterpiece. The simple carriage trip to Vermilion felt insanely rich when conditions on the ground shouted out the pain of an entire Realm uprooted from its shell, spat into the wider world with only hope on top, backstabbing underneath.\n\n"Who did the Matriarch assemble?" he had mentioned in passing not long ago. "A hermit monk scared at anything more advanced than a fork, a foreigner businesskirin content with turning Kiria into a national sweatshop, a wayward priestess who'd 'purify' her revolution through any means possible... and who headed these three? An idealist untouched by experience. No wonder..."\n\nSuch reminiscing left him once the Vermilion Palace came into view. Metal mutedly clashed against metal; the city's old guards, faithful to the Matriarch, were resigned to join Concord soon in a good death. That Sen Kinh would send them there, Zeyshan had no answers to, not for him nor for the train of kirin that had followed him like a mystery to chase. They could not be ignored.\n\nHe hopped off the carriage, ready for a swarm of kirin hungry for answers. "If you are expecting some grandiose speech, now is not the time!" He took the robe around his head off and waved it, a sign of some courtesy, some greeting. The reply was a modest, unsure wave of cheers from humble bungalows to sky-high balconies. "A sensible government is what this realm needs! Let us dream, but let us not overstep ourselves! Have a good day, and I will see you again shortly!"
lotus.34.a:0 "Let's carve your way."

lotus.35.t:0 "Upon the Waters"
lotus.35.d:0 "A creek babbled downstream from majestic Vermilion, tying up a village as one aquatic ribbon on the Mellifluve delta. Huts had imitated the splendour of the former capital's architecture, culminating in a noodle bar that, for all its humble service in feeding mouths and nothing more, resembled the Matriarchs' palace. Not that that would stop a head of state from occupying this place, juggling noodle-slurping, report-reading, and question-taking from the locals who'd never seen a "savage" before, much less one well dressed as this zebra here.\n\n A not-so-elderly stallion poked him with a stick. "And what exactly is your plan here, young one?" His eyes on the noodles conveyed hurt pride: some foreigner eating their food..."This land," this Zeyshan said, letting go of his documents, "it is huge, very diverse. Many tongues speak and sing here, telling of many respectable cultures... so when we are so diverse, what do we stand for? Ah, I should've asked... what is your name, sir?"\n\n"Brist, but if I may?" He coughed, perhaps to get everyone else's attention. The slurps stopped. "We've lived here for so long... from before we settled, from before the Kirian Realm, this was our realm. Long before the Way of Fire, the Matriarch, we had each other. Each other and our precious Mellifluve."\n\nRecognition found itself in Zeyshan's eyes. They glimmered. "I've been looking for a name for this new country of ours, actually, but now that you've mentioned it, how far does the Mellifluve extend?"\n\n"Oh, from the Cradle of Kirinity to..."\n\nThe name of "Zaikiria" needed not be said.

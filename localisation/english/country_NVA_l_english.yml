NVA_BEGIN:0 "South of Mellifluve"
NVA_BEGIN_desc:0 "In the southern land where the Vermillion Dynasty failed to conquer, there lived a hundred tribes and city-states. Throughout history, even as their nations faced repeated destruction and reconstruction during numerous invasions, the people of the South persisted in resistance, where their identity of ethnic was born."

NVA_INTRO:0 "The Crown of Lotus"
NVA_INTRO_desc:0 "As the capital of Sen Kinh and the most powerful city-state among all Zaikiria tribes, the ancient Kingdom of Baiyan was established by Lotus. Even in the present moment, after the fall of Baiyan, the pervasive influence of Lotus continues to assert dominance over the Kingdom of Sen Kinh. The Lotus King rules the kingdom on his throne, for now, and perhaps, forever."

NVA_politicy_intro:0 "Political Upheavals"
NVA_politicy_intro_desc:0 "When it comes to the new millennium, the political situation of the kingdom is a little bit changed.

NVA_culture_intro:0 "A Multinational State"
NVA_culture_intro_desc:0 "Throughout the reigns of both the Baiyan Kingdom and its successor, the Sen Kinh Kingdom, diverse ethnicities and pluralism consistently characterized the societal fabric.

NVA_delegate_from_vermilion:0 "A Dying Kingdom"
NVA_delegate_from_vermilion_desc:0 "The nation is on the edge of being torn apart by political turmoil, economic downturns, and cultural conflicts. We must find a way to save our country from the endless chaos before it's too late."

NVA_choose_path:0 "First Meeting of the New Year"
NVA_choose_path_desc:0 "It is the royal court's first meeting, or perhaps the last meeting of the new year. The King and the Council of Wise must decide a path for Sen Kinh, no matter if it leads to glory or tragedy. With all our hope, Sen Kinh lives!"

 sp_land_heavy_sam: "Heavy SAMs"
 sp_land_heavy_sam_desc: "With enemy bombers getting ever deadlier and faster, a strong response is required. Deploying the best anti-air missiles we have throughout our army will make striking our troops a truly daunting task."
 sp_land_hydropneumatic_suspension: "Hydropneumatic Suspension"
 sp_land_hydropneumatic_suspension_desc: "The ultimate in tank suspension, by using a combination of liquids and gasses we can create a reliable, fast, and stealthy system."
 sp_land_composite_armor: "Composite Armor"
 sp_land_composite_armor_desc: "As HEAT shells become more and more common, a new defense is required for our tanks. The idea of inserting silica glass between rolled steel is appealing, though it will likely prove expensive."
 sp_land_advanced_modern_turret: "Advanced Modern Turret"
 sp_land_advanced_modern_turret_desc: "As tanks continue to engage at farther and farther ranges, a modernized version of the modern turret is appealing. It would be able to mount even guns once restricted to super-heavy tanks, as well as allowing higher visibility."

 sp_nuclear_clean_nuclear_bomb: "Miniaturized Nuclear Bomb"
 sp_nuclear_clean_nuclear_bomb_desc: "A low-yield and relatively 'clean' bomb, still capable of vaporizing enemy tanks and airfields while not leaving excessive lingering radiation, has come to our attention. Ideal for tactical use, this would increase our versatility significantly."
 CLEAN_NUCLEAR_BOMB_TT: "When deploying an §YAtomic Bomb§!, §Gthe Nuclear Fallout will be shorter and less severe.§!\n\nAllows for deploying §YAtomic Bombs§! by Tactical Bomber!\n\n§GDoubles§! our production of §YAtomic Bombs§!!"

Such a weapon would expand its reach beyond the area targeted and irradiate a huge region. This weapon would grant tremendous clout to the one wielding it, though hopefully we'd never have to actually use it..."

 sp_rockets_anti_ballistic_missile_desc: "With the new, terrifying age of nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles, a daunting proposal has reached us: mounting nuclear warheads on our largest surface-to-air missiles. Theoretically, this would be able to vaporize enemy ICBMs before impact."
 sp_rockets_air_to_air_missile: "Air-to-Air Missile"
 sp_rockets_air_to_air_missile_desc: "As electronics become smaller, the once-absurd idea of a guided missile able to be carried by a fighter is in reach of becoming real. This would also open the door to other guided munitions."
 sp_rockets_anti_radiation_missile: "Anti-Radiation Missile"
 sp_rockets_anti_radiation_missile_desc: "While the destructive power of our strike aircraft remains unmatched, they have unfortunately become more and more vulnerable as they carry more and more weaponry. An interesting solution has been proposed: a missile that will home in on active radar signals and destroy them. This would give our pilots a large amount of breathing room!"
 sp_rockets_air_launched_cruise_missile: "Air-Launched Cruise Missile"

 sp_naval_hovercraft: "Hovercraft"
 sp_naval_hovercraft_desc: "The hovercraft aims to 'fly' just above any level surface - be it land or sea - essentially by pushing away from it with an air cushion. Currently our prototypes are capable of transporting troops across the water far faster than traditional landing craft whilst maintaining a low profile. Additionally, a mounted machine gun or grenade launcher may make this vehicle relatively formidable in an infantry support role during landing operations."

 sp_air_super_large_airframe: "Super Large Airframe"
 sp_air_super_large_airframe_desc:0 "The idea of a Super-Large Airframe has long been a dream of our more radical scientists: a bomber so massive it is virtually indestructable by anything short of an enemy nuclear anti-air missile, carrying so many bombs nothing can survive a bombardment."
 sp_air_radar_3: "AEW&C"
 sp_air_radar_3_desc: "An Airborne Early Warning and Control system, essentially a flying radar array, would allow for early detection of enemy nuclear strikes, thus providing precious time for our citizens to get to safety. It would also help with locating enemy planes in adverse weather."

 ### Generic Projects ###

 sp_magical_telekinetic_fields: "Induced Telekinetic Fields"
 sp_magical_telekinetic_fields_desc: "Inspired largely by the telekinetic abilities of several different species, the concept behind induced telekinetic fields - colloquially known simply as 'shield generators' - is very simple. The aim is to replicate the ability to create a solid shield out of magic in much the same way as a unicorn might and automate the process so that it can be implemented in vehicle systems where such a system's portability is less of a concern."

 tech_magical_telekinetic_field_ship: "Ship Shield Projectors"
 ship_shield_module: "Telekinetic Shield Projector"
 ship_shield_module_desc: "A shield generated by armour with imbued telekinetic energies that can be seen to ripple across a surface when hit. Expensive but valuable."

 plane_shield_module: "Telekinetic Shield Projector"
 plane_shield_module_desc: "A shield generated by armour with imbued telekinetic energies that can be seen to ripple across a surface when hit. Expensive but valuable."

 sp_magical_assisted_quarries: "Magic-Assisted Quarries"
 sp_magical_assisted_quarries_desc: "Mining is an awful business. Certainly there are some creatures who yearn for the dark and sooty pits that we call safe workplaces, but the vast majority are rightfully unwilling to delve into - let alone operate machinery inside - such an environment. It seems only sensible that these are some of the first places that we experiment with magical machinery on a mass scale, be it in augmented drills or some level of automation in bringing material to the surface."

 tech_magical_quarry: "Magitech Quarry Installations"

 sp_magical_supply_organisation: "Magical Supply Organisation"
 sp_magical_supply_organisation_desc: "Any soldier who has worked in maintenance will gladly inform you of the value of a properly organised stockpile, but there's only so efficient the vast majority of soldiers - especially conscripts - can realistically be. Having some variety of magically-assisted sorting machinery that does the time consuming organisation of surplus materiel and directs it to the correct individual or towards the appropriate storage location will make our lives considerably easier."

 tech_magical_depot_organisation_sf_supply_grace: "Hyper-Energy Bars"

 sp_magical_imperceptibility_studies: "Magic Imperceptability Studies"
 sp_magical_imperceptibility_studies_desc: "Although somewhat controversial, the idea of using spells to make soldiers and operatives more difficult to perceive even in plain sight is obviously a concept that garners a lot of interest. We have found ways of using spells to manipulate the way light travels towards and bounces off items of clothing which could present opportunities for the technology's practical implementation, although it has proven somewhat challenging to keep track of said clothes after their enchantment."

 tech_magical_imperceptibility_studies: "Thaumatic Agency Department"
 tech_magical_imperceptibility_studies_offensive: "Enchanted Operative Equipment"
 tech_magical_imperceptibility_studies_defensive: "Enchanted Detection Tools"

 sp_magical_thaumaturgical_encryption_keys: "Thaumaturgical Encryption Keys"
 sp_magical_thaumaturgical_encryption_keys_desc: "Using an encryption key to encode and subsequently ungarble what might otherwise look like utter nonsense is nothing new in the field of information warfare. What makes this particular project interesting is the application of unique low-energy magic that can be used to interpret and subsequently scramble coded messages using spells only known to select individuals. As of now it's not known whether a brute force method - even a machine assisted one - could ever be used to break such methods of encryption."

 tech_magical_thaumaturgical_encryption_keys_encryption: "Mind-Palace Abjuration Spell"

 sp_magical_force_multiplication: "Magical Force Multiplication"
 sp_magical_force_multiplication_desc: "For many, magical weaponry has already become the next logical step in modern warfare. Traditional firearms and support weapons remain more practical to produce en masse for the time being, but the introduction of especially potent battalion-level formations equipped with fully magirised materiel have proven to be effective force multipliers in the short-term. There is no doubt that this support element will provide a significant tactical edge on the battlefield."

 sp_magical_synthetic_mineral_growth: "Synthetic Mineral Growth"
 sp_magical_synthetic_mineral_growth_desc: "Synthetic crystal manufacturing has been a possibility since the 900s, but was never pursued on an industrial scale. In the past it was only done by small businesses - usually in an effort to pass off their products as real for quick profits - but now that we understand the true potential in crystals there are new reasons to pursue their mass manufacture. The trickiest part will be trying to induce the energies present in naturally occurring crystals, but with enough determination and several replaced blast shields we will find a way."

 sp_magical_thaumaturgical_diagnoses: "Thaumaturgical Diagnoses"
 sp_magical_thaumaturgical_diagnoses_desc: "Letting creatures diagnose themselves has always been problematic for doctors and general practitioners, if not for the almost constant inaccuracies then for the additional anxiety that said diagnoses typically cause. Pre-packaged diagnostic packages with instructions alongside a selection bewitched tools and substances will have a comparable impact to first-aid kits for both soldiers on the frontline and creatures at home, allowing our citizens to get accurate and detailed diagnoses from the comfort of their own home; or indeed from the discomfort of a trench."
 sp_thaumaturgical_diagnoses: "Mass-Scale Diagnostics & Treatment"
 tech_magical_thaumaturgical_diagnoses_pop_growth: "101-Diagnosises Home Kit"

 sp_magical_earth_shatter_crystal_projectiles: "Energy Shatter Crystal Projectiles"
 sp_magical_earth_shatter_crystal_projectiles_desc: "Although crystals typically carry a somewhat containable amount of energy which requires considerable effort to release, it seems as though it is possible - particularly with large crystals - to force additional energy inside them. The more energy contained, the more fragile the crystal and the greater propensity it has for detonating spectacularly. Perhaps unsurprisingly, some bright minds had the genius idea of turning these concerningly volatile crystals into projectile weapons that detonate shortly after impacting a surface like a HEAT or HESH shell."

 tech_magical_crystal_projectile_ship: "Crystalline Naval Battery"
 ship_light_crystal_projectile_module: "Light Crystalline Naval Battery"
 ship_light_crystal_projectile_module_desc:0 "A light naval battery equipped with a state-of-the art crystal projector. This additional firepower is low velocity, but there's nothing like watching up close as a giant crystal bolt embeds itself in enemy steel before detonating like a bomb many times its size."
 ship_medium_crystal_projectile_module: "Medium Crystalline Naval Battery"
 ship_medium_crystal_projectile_module_desc:0 "A medium naval battery equipped with a state-of-the art crystal projector. This additional firepower is low velocity, but there's nothing like watching up close as a giant crystal bolt embeds itself in enemy steel before detonating like a bomb many times its size."
 ship_heavy_crystal_projectile_module: "Heavy Crystalline Naval Battery"
 ship_heavy_crystal_projectile_module_desc:0 "A heavy naval battery equipped with a state-of-the art crystal projector. This additional firepower is low velocity, but there's nothing like watching up close as a giant crystal bolt embeds itself in enemy steel before detonating like a bomb many times its size."
 tech_magical_crystal_projectile_tank: "Crystalline Tank Ammunition"
 tank_light_crystal_projectile_module: "Light Crystalline Cannon"
 tank_light_crystal_projectile_module_desc:0 "A light tank cannon designed with crystalline ammunition in mind. This firepower is low velocity, but there's nothing like watching up close as a giant crystal bolt embeds itself in enemy steel before detonating like a bomb many times its size."
 tank_medium_crystal_projectile_module: "Medium Crystalline Cannon"
 tank_medium_crystal_projectile_module_desc:0 "A medium tank cannon designed with crystalline ammunition in mind. This firepower is low velocity, but there's nothing like watching up close as a giant crystal bolt embeds itself in enemy steel before detonating like a bomb many times its size."

 ### Pony Projects ###

 sp_cloud_carrier: "Cloud Based Naval Infrastructure"
 sp_cloud_carrier_desc: "Pegasus cloud cities are the pinnacle of pegasi engineering, and the concept of a cloud ships has entered popular fiction. We can make it into reality if we resolve the difficulties surrounding enchanted clouds carrying heavy aircraft and weapons. Carefully rethinking the cloud-walking spell and how to apply it to make a flying ships a viable concept."

 sp_pegasi_void_suit: "Pegasi High-Altitude Gear"
 sp_pegasi_void_suit_desc: "Pegasi are capable of incredible feats of flight, but their bodies have limits. The realities of high-altitude flight prevent even the most athletic pegasus from flying without the assistance of a closed-cockpit aircraft. The Pegasus Void Suit is a flight suit that maintains the user's temperature, oxygen, and pressure levels, protecting them from hostile atmosphere conditions and allowing previously impossible operations at extreme altitudes."
 tech_magical_pegasus_void_suit: "Pegasi High-Altitute Gear"
 pegasus_void_suit: "Pegasus Void Suit"
 pegasus_void_suit_0: "Pegasus Void Suit"
 pegasus_void_suit_desc: "Keeps the wearer's temperature, oxygen, and pressure levels within acceptable limits."


 ### Griffon Projects ###

 sp_heavy_knight_armor: "Magitech Knight Armour"
 sp_heavy_knight_armor_desc: "Despite its cultural significance and the many design iterations made over the years, current knight armour remains a largely traditional military uniform which is exactly as heavy and restrictive as it looks. In the modern era of tanks and mechanised infantry, the amount of protection this equipment can offer an individual is simply redundant; especially when weighed against its drawbacks. The time has come for something more protective, something that enhances a user's mobility and something that provides a platform to operate modern heavy weapons."
 tech_magical_heavy_knight_armor: "Magitech Knight Armour"
 griffon_knight_armor: "Heavy Knight Armor"
 griffon_knight_armor_0: "Heavy Knight Armor"
 griffon_knight_armor_desc: "Enchanted and fortified, this armor makes its wearer extremely hard to kill."



 sp_universal_translator: "The Universal Translator"
 sp_universal_translator_desc:0 "Griffons are perhaps the most linguistically diverse species on the entire planet. It is no surprise - for this and for other reasons - that historically we have relied more on conflict than conversation to resolve our disputes. To make some headway in rectifying this, scientists have proposed that a correctly enchanted radio headset and microphone could allow our kind to properly communicate regardless of their native language. Future miniaturisations of the technology could also produce a more compact device, but for now we'll settle for putting magitech inside our existing military radio equipment."
 sp_explain_universal_translator: "Adds the §YUniversal Translator§! dynamic modifier, which grants bonuses depending how many significant regional capitals in Griffonia you or your puppets own. The regional capitals are as follows:\n — Griffenheim, Herzland:\n  - Division Organisation: +5.00%\n\n — Aquila, Aquileia:\n  - Research Speed: +5.00%\n\n — Karthin, Southern Griffonia:\n  - Resource Gain Efficiency: +15.00%\n\n — Griffonstone, Central Griffonia:\n  - Daily Political Power: +0.10\n  - Stability: +10%\n\n — Sydia, Evi Valley:\n  - Monthly Population: +30.00%\n\n — Cloudbury, Northern Griffonia:\n  - Supply Consumption: -10.00%"

 griffon_universal_translator_modifier: "Universal Translator"
 griffon_universal_translator_modifier_desc: "Griffons are perhaps the most linguistically diverse species on the entire planet. It is no surprise - for this and for other reasons - that historically we have relied more on conflict than conversation to resolve our disputes. To make some headway in rectifying this, scientists have proposed that a correctly enchanted radio headset and microphone could allow our kind to properly communicate regardless of their native language. Future miniaturisations of the technology could also produce a more compact device, but for now we'll settle for putting magitech inside our existing military radio equipment."

 ### Zebra Projects ###

 sp_alchemical_toolbelt: "Alchemical Toolbelt"
 sp_alchemical_toolbelt_desc: "True to its name, this project is less one of theory and more one of application. Alchemical packs are a fairly common accessory for trained alchemists already, but for soldiers and untrained conscripts in particular it's much more challenging to create a toolbelt of regularly used concoctions and ingredients. Beyond its use we must also consider its safety as glass beakers that you might see in a more scientific setting tend not to enjoy the roughshod nature of combat. We'll have to draw up some new hardy and chemically unreactive containers."
 tech_magical_alchemical_toolbelt: "Alchemical Toolbelt"
 zebra_alchemical_toolbelt: "Alchemical Toolbelt"
 zebra_alchemical_toolbelt_desc: "A toolbelt of useful potions suited for combat."
 zebra_alchemical_toolbelt_0: "Alchemical Toolbelt"


 sp_starmetal: "Synthetical Starmetal Alloy"
 sp_starmetal_desc: "It seems that our scientists are becoming more and more confident that they can synthetically reproduce starmetal. The alloy - so named for its presence in meteorites and coveted for both its strength and rarity - was long thought to be impossible to create in a worldly environment for many years, but this appears to have been a false assumption. Thanks in no small part to recent thaumaturgical advancements, it is theorised that we may be able to reproduce the vacuous conditions of space that could enable the production of starmetal on an unprecedented scale."
 tech_magical_starmetal: "Starmetal"

 ### Hippogriff Projects ###

 sp_underwater_rail_infrastructure: "Underwater Rail Infrastructure"
 sp_underwater_rail_infrastructure_desc: "Although Seaquestria is far from underdeveloped, the realities of sea floor construction have traditionally made the implementation of transport networks very challenging. The ability to move in three dimensions through the water has alleviated the strain this restriction would otherwise put on city infrastructure, but it is clear that some kind of mass transit will be needed in the near future. It has been theorised that large boring machines could be used to create and seal up new tunnels a safe depth under the sea floor, providing a relatively dry space in which to construct a rail network."

 sp_diving_plane: "Submersible Aircraft"
 sp_diving_plane_desc: "Despite the seemingly oxymoronic name, a vehicle like this has shocking utility to a race of creatures that inhabits two different environments. In theory we have all the technological knowhow that would be needed to construct such a hybrid craft, but a capable design is not necessarily a practical one. Currently our engineers are attempting to figure out a way for the craft to smoothly transition between flight and underwater propulsion. Suggestions so far have ranged from explosive devices to break the water tension both ways to airbags or enormous parachutes for the descent."
 diving_plane_small: "Light Aeromarine Conversion"
 diving_plane_small_desc: "A total airframe conversion that allows this light aircraft to operate underwater in a primarily anti-ship capacity. Just don't forget to have the salt water washed off when your pilots return to base."
 diving_plane_medium: "Medium Aeromarine Conversion"
 diving_plane_medium_desc: "A total airframe conversion that allows this medium aircraft to operate underwater in a primarily anti-ship capacity. Just don't forget to have the salt water washed off when your pilots return to base."
 diving_plane_large: "Heavy Aeromarine Conversion"
 diving_plane_large_desc: "A total airframe conversion that allows this heavy aircraft to operate underwater in a primarily anti-ship capacity. Just don't forget to have the salt water washed off when your pilots return to base."

 ### Changeling Projects ###

 ### Kirin Projects ###

 sp_grand_astrological_orrery: "Grand Astrological Orrery"
 sp_grand_astrological_orrery_desc: "Astrology has long been employed by kirin to interpret the signs of the stars and the seasons, so it stands to reason that we would pursue the construction of a grand orrery with which to perform even more detailed predictions of the future. It will - of course - utilise the relevant and most up-to-date star charts, numerological and probability calculations in order to maximise the accuracy and utility of whatever answers we may find to our many burning questions."

 ### Changeling Projects ###

 sp_camo_cloak: "Camouflage Cloak"
 sp_camo_cloak_desc: "Creating a substance that has the capacity to visually adapt to its surroundings will be no easy task, but it is a concept worth pursuing. We have always enjoyed the ability to change visually into most creatures and objects at will, yet our equipment does not enjoy the same kind of instant visual protection. Moreover, even talented changelings cannot mimic things beyond or below certain sizes. If our scientists could identify the biological magic that allows us to visually camouflage ourselves and isolate it, subsequently applying the same magic to cloaks and tarpaulins could radically alter the way we utilise stealth on a tactical level."
 tech_magical_camo_cloak: "Camouflage Cloak"
 camo_cloak: "Camouflage Cloak"
 camo_cloak_0: "Camouflage Cloak"
 camo_cloak_desc: "This equipment allows its wearer or the objects that it covers to become nearly invisible. Nearly."


 
 sp_temporary_chitin_structures: "Temporary Chitinous Structures" 
 sp_temporary_chitin_structures_desc: "Changeling hives are not alive, but have often been described as such due to how reactive they can be to changeling magic, with tunnels closing and opening at a drone's will. Much of this is due to the chitin and mucal material biologically produced and used by changelings to construct hives and maintain their function and integrity. A recent proposal suggested that we experiment on this material through thaumaturgical genetic modification, potentially allowing a few changelings to establish a small hive quickly. This structure can then be used as a temporary forward operating base until it begins to deteriorate after a few weeks. This could provide our soldiers with a home away from home and a local love repository that will improve their morale and fighting capabilities for a short time."
 tech_magical_temporary_chitin_structures: "Tactical Temporary Hive"
 enables_temp_hive_ability_tt: "Enables $fm_leader$ ability: §Y$ABILITY_TEMP_CHITIN_FOB$§!.\nCommand Power Cost:\n  - Base cost: §Y0.20§! (each for §Y1§! battalion)\nDuration: §Y10 days§!\nCooldown: §Y10 days§!\n$MODIFIER_NO_SUPPLY_GRACE$: §G+240.0§! Hour(s)\nDeliver armies enough supply for §Y84§! Hours\n\nWill give an upgraded version if the $fm_leader$ has the §Y$logistics_wizard$§! trait."

 ### Deer Projects

 sp_spirit_grenades: "Spirit Grenade"
 sp_spirit_grenades_desc: "One of our spiritually unfortunate scientists recently proposed this concept as a joke and it has since spiralled into a plausible idea. Using angry spirits as a tool of chaos against enemy formations is not a new strategy on its own, but using unicorn-inspired telekinetics to trap them inside grenade-sized containers certainly is.

Instead it has been theorised that we can apply their visions to a grander strategy, collecting as many seers as possible in one place and collating the information provided in order to formulate a pinpoint plan for the future. It has been suggested that we could introduce a variety of stimuli to experiment with speeding up the process, but for now at least we shall be satisfied by developing a proper system of collective visionary documentation."

 ### Diamond Dog Projects

 sp_tunnel_drill: "Assault Tunnel Vehicle"
 sp_tunnel_drill_desc: "Although tank-mounted dozer blades have proven effective, it has become clear to us that these are not wholly effective in mountainous regions where our forces regularly operate. Not wanting to resign armoured fortification and fire support to combat only in flat terrain, engineers have presented a prototype that our scientists are now pouring over. The blueprinted 'Assault Tunnel Vehicle' aims to clean up the engineers' haphazard work for field testing, alongside a number of safety improvements and the introduction of a semi-crystalline engine to reduce exhaust buildup when tunnelling."

 sp_deep_rock_drill_desc: "There is nothing fundamentally unique about the so-called 'Deep Rock Drill' in concept. Using a colossal mining platform to extra resources on a large scale is unusual, but not unheard of. What makes the DRD special is its energy source and its ability to extract almost any resource no matter the location. Advances in magical engines have allowed our scientists to begin developing an almost exhaustless power pack that also has the capacity to sustain thaumaturgical gyroscopes which will stabilise the drill when in operation."

 # pony void suit
 sp_pegasi_void_suit_choice_reward: "Pockets, Protection and Performance"
 sp_pegasi_void_suit_choice_reward_desc: "Our research team has come to a crossroads regarding some design choices for the pegasi flight suits. Some engineers want the suit users to perform better by slimming down on the suit's weight and permitting more wing movement to increase their flight speed. Many want to add armour plates instead to offer better protection and pockets to carry extra equipment for an assault. One engineer even suggested making the suits as ergonomic and durable as possible, making life easier for the user and our logisticians. It seems that there is a deadlock to be broken."
 sp_pegasi_void_suit_speed_choice: "Lighten the suits."

 sp_heavy_knight_armor_choice_reward_desc: "Whilst the project is making quick progress, some questions have been raised during testing. Primarily, the special forces that have had the privilege of using the new equipment have been wondering about what role this new armour is pushing them towards on the modern battlefield. Their officers - talented as they may be - do not seem to be sure themselves, so we may have to push them in a particular direction with design alterations."

##### TAG SPECIFIC #######
 sp_future_infantry_rifle:0 "Project SALVO"
 sp_future_infantry_rifle_desc:0 "One of Terrafin's dearest desires is to see every infantrygriff carrying a weapon of the future. This has already manifested in the use of magical weaponry, but we must go further. Imagine recoil-dampening spells, weapons firing three times as fast as traditional rifles, guns that fire small explosive charges to effectively shoot around corners! Although the venerable slugthrower will be very hard to improve on, our scientists are surely up to the task."
 sp_land_reward_future_infantry_rifle_focus_preference:0 "Caseless or Flechettes?"
 sp_land_reward_future_infantry_rifle_focus_preference_desc:0 "We need to lock in our preferred type of rifle. Two proposals are before us. Caseless rifles would be logistically cheaper, simpler, and consistently reliable. Flechette rifles, on the other claw, would be capable of incredible performance."
 sp_land_reward_option_caseless:0 "Caseless is cheaper and less risky."
 sp_land_reward_option_flechette:0 "Flechettes have enormous potential."
 sp_future_tank:0 "Project SHATTER"
 sp_future_tank_desc:0 "Heavy tanks are obviously the future of armored warfare, but current heavies simply aren't powerful enough and run into problems with their transmissions and engines. A true super-heavy tank, not merely an upscaled heavy but a tank designed to kill them, will provide a powerful front-line advantage over heavy tanks and comfortable superiority against anything lighter.\n\nTo be properly useful, of course, it will have to be amphibious as well."
 sp_land_reward_future_tank_preference:0 "Conventional or Amphibious?"
 sp_land_reward_future_tank_preference_desc:0 "Terrafin has suggested that we take the extensive data from the project and apply it to a more traditional super-heavy tank, as without all the extra weight and complexity he could design a good tank, but some within the project insist that the concept is possible. In particular they point to the double-tread idea which performed well in models but has not been rigorously tested and would take extensive redesigning."
 sp_land_reward_option_conventional:0 "Go with Terrafin's idea and abandon the amphibious requirement."
 sp_land_reward_option_amphibious:0 "We believe in our scientists! They can do it!"

 sp_ground_effect_vehicle:0 "Project TIDALWAVE"
 sp_ground_effect_vehicle_desc:0 "Planes flying low over the water have reported a curious increase to their lift, dubbed the "ground effect". This may make possible larger plane/boat hybrids, capable of moving extremely fast and avoiding enemy RADAR by simply flying under it. Ideally such plane/boats would be able to hold missiles or torpedoes. Therefore, these "ground effect vehicles" must be investigated as soon as possible."
 sp_nuclear_naval_mines:0 "Project BARNACLE"
 sp_nuclear_naval_mines_desc:0 "While it may seem insane to leave nuclear weapons floating around in the ocean, the fact is that a single naval mine, if equipped with a nuclear payload, can sink entire flotillas of enemy vessels, and can effectively deny a much larger area to the enemy since enemy vessels those far away from the blast could be damaged or sunk."
 sp_nuclear_depth_charges:0 "Project BOTTOMFEEDER"
 sp_nuclear_depth_charges_desc:0 "Our current depth charges are effective, but due to their limited blast radius they often fail to disable their targets, particularly if the submarine detects the charge and changes depth before it goes off. The Exotic Weaponry Commission has come up with a solution to that problem which some are calling overkill: arming our depth charges with low-yield nuclear bombs, to kill every submarine in the area regardless of changing depth."
 sp_nuclear_air_to_air_rocket:0 "Project FALLOUT"
 sp_nuclear_air_to_air_rocket_desc:0 "A single strategic bomber can rightfully be called a "Flying Fortress," and an entire formation of them is extremely difficult for our fighters to engage. Project FALLOUT would see some of our fighters armed with unguided air-to-air rockets tipped with a low-yield nuclear warhead: the massive blast wave would turn enemy bomber's formations against them, downing an entire wing in a single fireball."
 sp_nuclear_land_mines:0 "Project TATZLWURM"
 sp_nuclear_land_mines_desc:0 "Our pioneer corps could benefit from the recent explosion of new uses for nuclear technology. If we could engineer a safe, reliable demolition charge with a nuclear payload, it would make collapsing large buildings and clearing out the biggest minefields so much easier. They could also serve quite well as area-denial weapons."
 sp_nuclear_rocket_artillery:0 "Project TANKBUSTER"
 sp_nuclear_rocket_artillery_desc:0 "Project TANKBUSTER aims to produce the smallest nuclear weapon yet: one capable of being fired out of a conventional rocket artillery system. The idea of equipping even our ground forces with nuclear weapons is tantalizing, although Terrafin is quick to point out the logistical and strategic limitations of such an endeavour. Still, if the project is successful its value in destroying armoured formations, area denial, attacking fortifications, and sheer Shock and Awe cannot be overstated."
 sp_personal_grenade_launcher:0 "Project BOMBTHROWER"
 sp_personal_grenade_launcher_desc:0 "An interesting request has come to us from below, from a commissar in an infantry battalion. She has raised issues with the range of rifle grenades, and has suggested a "personal grenade launcher", to be carried by one creature per platoon. More portable than a mortar, it would allow easy response to enemy situations and hefty firepower in a small package."
 sp_future_bomber:0 "Project STARFIRE"
 sp_future_bomber_desc:0 "Traditional bombers remain highly vulnerable to fighters and interceptors. To counter this threat and truly become a global power, we will have to design something radically different. Flying far faster and higher than traditional bombers, our Valkyrie will be virtually invulnerable to conventional AA as well as interceptors. While this may necessitate some compromises in other parts of the design, it will surely prove worthwhile once completed."


 HIP_sp_nuclear_torpedos_desc:0 "One obvious naval application of nuclear weapons is in torpedoes. A torpedo tipped with a nuclear warhead, even a low-yield one, could effortlessly sink even the heaviest warships. With our recent advances in nuclear technology, this formidable new weapon may finally be in reach."
 HIP_sp_air_helicopter:0 "Project SHOOTING STAR"
 HIP_sp_air_helicopter_desc:0 "Airplanes in the night sky are a powerful asset for the Air Force, but they're not enough. Rotary aircraft have the potential to totally change the nature of air-land battle. We must jump-start the helicopter age and gain supremacy over the supremacists of the world."
 HIP_sp_rockets_air_launched_cruise_missile:0 "Project STANDOFF"
 HIP_sp_rockets_air_launched_cruise_missile_desc:0 "The potential of air-launched cruise missiles to strike enemy silos and airbases cannot be overstated.

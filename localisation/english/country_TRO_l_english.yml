### Focuses ###
TRO_CTH_a1: "The War Of National Salvation"
TRO_CTH_a1_desc: "Colthage is, once again, burning. To save our home from tyrants and lunatics, we must take up arms. For the Republic!"
TRO_CTH_a2: "Raise War "Taxes""
TRO_CTH_a2_desc: "Money wins wars and we have little of that. As the rightful government, we shall tax our zebras for their defence. Wouldn't want your house hit by artillery now, would you? By enemy artillery, of course."
TRO_CTH_a3: "The Village Conscription System"
TRO_CTH_a3_desc: "Our zebras are tired of war, but war is not done with them. To ensure we can fight, every village must give a percentage of its inhabitants to the cause."
TRO_CTH_a4: "Organised Loot Distribution"
TRO_CTH_a4_desc: "Looting motivates our soldiers but also distracts them from combat. We need a simple system to keep them on track. Fight now, loot later. Let their battle cry be "Today, gods willing, we'll all be rich!""
TRO_CTH_a5: "Assure The Investors"
TRO_CTH_a5_desc: "The market is having a momentary blip, nothing more. Things will soon straighten out. Trust me, it's fine. Invest now in the Republic, the winning side, to guarantee future opportunities and tax cuts!"
TRO_CTH_a6: "Deepen Cartel Ties"
TRO_CTH_a6_desc: "Some of our weak-willed and cowardly politicians fear the cartels, but let's look at this objectively. They don't want to give up the power and influence they've gained, so if we work together, we can profit. Let's make them an offer they can't refuse."
TRO_CTH_a7: "Float The Zebinop Textile Industry" 
TRO_CTH_a7_desc: "The backbone of our finances is the fabric industry. Every zebra, from farmer to fighter, needs textiles. By providing generous terms, we can keep their businesses running and provide for our troops' requirements in the field."
TRO_CTH_a8: "The Merchants Of The Zebhara"
TRO_CTH_a8_desc: "Zebhara is a difficult place to account for. No zebra would think we'd be able to get guns across its inhospitable landscape. Still, with a little help, we might manage it."
TRO_CTH_a9: "Negotiate With The AGWP"
TRO_CTH_a9_desc: "Wingbardy may be just the kind of friend we need. For a short-term loan, they've promised to provide us with the means to push our enemies back."
TRO_CTH_a10: "Stoke Republican Nostalgia"
TRO_CTH_a10_desc: "By reminding the zebras of their glorious past, we can inspire them to fight harder for the future. It doesn't matter if we have to embellish a bit: no one will know the difference."
TRO_CTH_a11: "The Ever Cheap And Disposable Flayers"
TRO_CTH_a11_desc: "A smaller, motorised division can strike harder and faster into enemy territory. If they don't come back, at least they've bought us some time. Off you go, then."
TRO_CTH_a12: "The Always Reliable Holdbreakers"
TRO_CTH_a12_desc: "Quality over quantity. Let Hiram and Zanit expend themselves against us. We'll hold the line against all comers and drive them back when they're weakened."
TRO_CTH_a13: "The Gun Runners Of The Tiger Syndicate"
TRO_CTH_a13_desc: "Guns don't just fall off the back of a lorry. They have to be pushed. The Tiger Syndicate are the best gunrunners this side of Weter. If anyone can get us some guns on the side, it's them."
TRO_CTH_a14: "The Expertise Of The Abizaal Syndicate"
TRO_CTH_a14_desc: "For all of their hideous produce, the Abizaal are some of the most creative minds in the country. Sending a few "volunteers" their way could help our efforts in the long run, provided they stick to their end of the bargain."
TRO_CTH_a15: "Prioritise Agricultural Redevelopment"
TRO_CTH_a15_desc: "Fewer hooves working the fields means more hooves in the fight. A simple equation but one that will give us the edge in the ongoing struggle."
TRO_CTH_a16: "Prioritise Industrial Reconstruction"
TRO_CTH_a16_desc: "What use is a soldier with no weapon to fight with? We must make our industrial growth the top priority. If not, there won't be a nation left to fight for."
TRO_CTH_a17: "The Strike Against Tyranny"
TRO_CTH_a17_desc: "Colthage has seen tyrant after tyrant over the last few years. Self-styled heroes turned into what they sought to destroy. Through it all, we never gave up hope. We knew that our saviour would come, and Gerza is that saviour. We should know; we've followed a few."
TRO_CTH_a18: "The Slightly Less Ragged Banner Army"
TRO_CTH_a18_desc: "Our forces are still not what you'd call ideal, but they have improved notably. The size of the army has swollen, and most of our soldiers have a gun and a helmet. We'd rate it a solid "OK" out of ten. It'll have to do."
TRO_CTH_a19: "The Smugglers Of The Zapsa Syndicate"
TRO_CTH_a19_desc: "If you want it, the Zapsa Syndicate can get it, and gods know we want for an awful lot right now. We must hope the price isn't too high; we'll have to pay it, regardless. Perhaps we should remind them of what they stand to lose should the war go against us."
TRO_CTH_a20: "Utilise The Zurumilki Family"
TRO_CTH_a20_desc: "To fight a modern war, we must have oil. That means doing a deal with the Zurumiki and their ilk. With them being landowners in all but name, we'll have to lubricate discussions by fuelling fears of losing their grip on the wells they control."
TRO_CTH_a21: "Shake Hooves With The Zaga Brotherhood"
TRO_CTH_a21_desc: "The Zaga are weird, to say the least, for they're the most unsettling of the cartels, drug addicts in the guise of monks. But their insistence on dressing and acting like priests have their advantages: they can pass unseen by most. Strange though they are, they may be a godsend."
TRO_CTH_a22: "Optimise Wartime Production"
TRO_CTH_a22_desc: "We've got a solid foundation under our hooves. With the changes we've made, we can now gallop full speed into the final stages of the war. With one final effort, victory shall be ours."

TRO_CTH_b1: "The House Of Cards"
TRO_CTH_b1_desc: "The gamble has paid off. Whether it was a bluff or not doesn't matter anymore; all the challengers have folded and we've won the whole pot, so now we just have to keep it as new gamblers come to the table, looking for their share."
TRO_CTH_b2: "Bureaucratic Optimisation Initiative"
TRO_CTH_b2_desc: "There are some zebras in Colthage who – through some terrible madness – actually like doing paperwork and are quite suited for the job. If we give these disturbingly boring creatures exactly what they're after, we can keep them out of the way and improve our administrative efficiency in one swoop."
TRO_CTH_b3: "Maintain Bicameralism"
TRO_CTH_b3_desc: "The powers the Senate and the Popular Assembly have over each other ensure that one house cannot gain too much influence. That's how it's meant to work, at least. Things have been getting unstable, though, with the Patricians gaining ground. We'd best tighten things up."
TRO_CTH_b4: "Unitarian Jurisprudence"
TRO_CTH_b4_desc: "A solid system of laws is required for any civilised nation to function without descending into violence and anarchy... again. There must be one set of laws for all, one governing body of courts and no one will be above them."
TRO_CTH_b5: "Crack Down Upon "Hereditary" Positions"
TRO_CTH_b5_desc: "It's an age-old argument: "My mother held this position before me and her mother before her, etc." That might be true, but it doesn't mean any of them were good at their jobs. It's time to shake up the system and leave the dead weight behind."
TRO_CTH_b6: "Controlled Nepotism"
TRO_CTH_b6_desc: "Certain tasks require finesse, a lifetime of preparation and the character to produce the best results for the country. Officials like this cannot be trained, for they are grown, aged like fine wine into their positions. It is officials such as this that have made the Republic what it is today."
TRO_CTH_b7: "Federal Jurisprudence"
TRO_CTH_b7_desc: "The status quo cannot be demolished and rebuilt overnight. There are too many legal nuances throughout the nation, and successive civil wars have layered laws upon laws in ways we cannot begin to understand. Best to leave the provinces to handle their courts; that way, when they screw up, they'll take the blame."
TRO_CTH_b8: "Implement The Tricameral Senate"
TRO_CTH_b8_desc: "The two houses of the Senate and the Popular Assembly have become unstable with the Patricians gaining more and more power, letting the Assembly slip into obscurity. To redress the imbalance, we'll set up a new chamber of selected advisors to oversee the other two houses... appointed by Benoam Gerza, of course."
TRO_CTH_b9: "The General Bureaucrat Competency Exam"
TRO_CTH_b9_desc: "There is so much to do and very little time to do it under. Quantity will have to do over quality: we need more hooves in government to pick up the slack. As long as they can read, write and file paperwork, we'll give them a job and put them to work."
TRO_CTH_b10: "Lobbyist Background Checks"
TRO_CTH_b10_desc: "To work in the Senate or the Assembly requires a rigorous selection process of interviews, competency tests and background checks, yet any zebra with a lobbyist pass can just walk in. Do you know the type of creatures that wander these halls? We don't. It's time we find out."
TRO_CTH_b11: "Organise The Federal Police"
TRO_CTH_b11_desc: "A federal state requires federal enforcement, not some backwater sheriff who thinks he owns the place because he's got a badge and a gun. These jumped-up small-town dictators need to be put in their place and reminded that they answer to the law, not the other way around."
TRO_CTH_b12: "Universal Welfare Rates"
TRO_CTH_b12_desc: "The health of our creatures is one of the pillars of the state and it is every creature's right to have access to healthcare. This is not socialism; it's kindness, the care of the nation for its citizens. Also, we can work them that little bit harder if we cover any accidents that might arise."
TRO_CTH_b13: "The Zarcid Scare"
TRO_CTH_b13_desc: "Zarca: that terrible word inscribed upon the chariot of the storm. That family and their supporters linger on like a bad smell, with their quiet plots stretching their tendrils throughout our nation like weeds. Let us be rid of them once and for all."
TRO_CTH_b14: "Opium Growing Licenses"
TRO_CTH_b14_desc: "To grow anything on a major scale in the Republic requires a license, such as a farmer's one for corn and a merchant's for cotton and coffee. It ensures quality and that nothing goes astray to the black market. With the legalisation of opium, we'll extend the same rules to poppy."
TRO_CTH_b14_tt: "Will unlock a decision for §Gfriendly§! cartels which further increases the §Ypower§! of the cartels, §gin comparison to increasing their §Yrelations§! with us§!.\n\n"
TRO_CTH_b15: "State Controlled Opium Manufacturing"
TRO_CTH_b15_desc: "If the state is going to legalise opium, then the state will manage the growth, manufacturing and distribution of opium. We can reap the tax and sales income and ensure that only those we deem fit have a hoof in the process."
TRO_CTH_b15_tt: "Will unlock a decision for §Gfriendly§! cartels which further increases the §Yrelations§! of the cartels, §gin comparison to increasing their §Ypower§!§!.\n\n"
TRO_CTH_b16: "Curtail Patrician Opulence"
TRO_CTH_b16_desc: "What do the Patricians do? Sure, they hold seats in the Senate, but they just argue and talk in circles all day every day. They're overpaid and underworked layabouts who waste every zebra's time. Make them earn their keep: cut their wages, remove their privileges and no more wine with lunch."
TRO_CTH_b17: "Implement Welfare Brackets"
TRO_CTH_b17_desc: "Helping the needy is a noble cause - no zebra would deny that – but who exactly is needy? There are a lot of creatures out there looking to abuse the system for a free hoofout. Tying welfare benefits to household income will ensure only those who truly need help receive it."
TRO_CTH_b18: "Incentivise Private Security Companies"
TRO_CTH_b18_desc: "We cannot be everywhere all the time, and constantly funding a nationwide police force will cost far too much. What about when there isn't any crime? Just a waste of money. Setting up a network of bounty hunters will catch criminals when needed and will be much more efficient."
TRO_CTH_b19: "The Lobbyist "Tax""
TRO_CTH_b19_desc: "Lobbyists only want to make the Republic a better place but advising is a privilege and should come at a cost and there are many things they can help cover: stamp duty, window tax, swamp insurance, hen food, dog biscuits, cow ointment – the expenses are endless."
TRO_CTH_b20: "The Chamber Of The Qualified" #Scientists and the like
TRO_CTH_b20_desc: "Politicians are not scientists; they cannot be expected to keep up to date on the latest technological developments and adjust policy accordingly. An advisory committee formed from the Young Scientists shall fill the gaps in our knowledge with their expertise."
TRO_CTH_b21: "The Labour Standards Act" # Broad-reaching labour law reforms especially in regards to contracts, read up on Japanese labour laws for this one
TRO_CTH_b21_desc: "Workers have long been at the mercy of their employers, but it's a two-way street; the managers need the workers just as much, if not more. We won't allow socialism to creep in — no, no — but a mutually beneficial balance of power suits everyone. Give the workers a say in the business, and the managers can rely on them to turn up in the morning."
TRO_CTH_b22: "The Colthaginian Civic Religion"
TRO_CTH_b22_desc: "There are certain symbols and promises that have been given to the Republic by the gods, such as freedom in the constitution and our continued prosperity. When we turned away from them, we lost everything, but now we have a new chance and we should embrace it. The Republic makes no sense without a deeply held faith in the gods - and we don't care what it is."
TRO_CTH_b23: "Technocratic Guidance"
TRO_CTH_b23_desc: "One cannot make an informed decision without all the facts. "Winging it" provides exactly the uncertainty that led to the last civil war. We need a broad spectrum of intelligent minds from all walks of life to drive forward our development."
TRO_CTH_b24: "The Federal Land Reform Act"
TRO_CTH_b24_desc: "The laws regarding the distribution and usage of lands are outdated and corrupt, granting far too much power to landlords while leaving tenants and workers with little rights. We're not even certain who owns what parts of the country. It's time to overhaul the whole rotten system."
TRO_CTH_b25: "End The War On Drugs"
TRO_CTH_b25_desc: "Turns out the drugs won."
TRO_CTH_b25_trigger: "This focus will be automatically completed when all of the cartels have either been §Gsubjugated§! or §Reliminated§!\n\n"
TRO_CTH_b25_tt: "§gWe's done here.§!"
TRO_CTH_b26: "The Patrician Agricultural Parcelization Act"
TRO_CTH_b26_desc: "The Patricians have over time acquired far too much land and with it, too much power and influence. We're not even sure exactly how much land that is, but it must be lots, so we'll force them to parcel up their territories into small holdings then give them back to the state, which can then pass it to those who'll use it best."
TRO_CTH_b27: "Maintain Academic Elitism"
TRO_CTH_b27_desc: "Only the best of the best can be entrusted with the care of the Republic. Approved scholars and enlightened professors will handle the education of the nation, ensuring the stability we need for the future of our colts and fillies."
TRO_CTH_b28: "Full-blown Educational Secularisation" #This one also requires a bit of explanation the pretence of secularisation is going to be used to boot off any teachers and or professors who don't necessarily agree with the government
TRO_CTH_b28_desc: "The universities are full of professors spouting nonsense, filling the heads of our youth with lies and unrest. These dissidents will be removed from their posts immediately for... religious reasons... Yeah, that'll do. The state must be secular and these teachers are secretly priests."
TRO_CTH_b29: "Minimal Wage Regionalisation" #Minimum Wage is determined by the economic prosperity of X and or Y region
TRO_CTH_b29_desc: "Different parts of the country produce different things like cotton, steel, oil, etc. These items are of differing value, so the labour that goes into producing them is of differing value. Logically we should only be paying what the labour is worth and tie the minimum wage of the workers to the region's economic value."
TRO_CTH_b30: "The Chamber Of Corporations"
TRO_CTH_b30_desc: "The economy drives the Republic forward and makes everything that we do as a nation possible. Set up an advisory committee for the biggest business holders, and with their help, we'll push ourselves to ever greater heights."
TRO_CTH_b31: "Syncretist Economics" #Technocratic Economy for the sake of increasing the living standards of the people
TRO_CTH_b31_desc: "Money can either be made safe or made to work, not both. The financial security and safety of our citizens come before profit. A sovereign wealth fund will ensure every zebra's future."
TRO_CTH_b32: "Voter Competency Tests"
TRO_CTH_b32_desc: "There are some creatures who are – let's be honest – too thick to be allowed to vote. If they can't understand the issues at hoof, they shouldn't get a say in them. It'll protect them from being swayed by charisma rather than facts."
TRO_CTH_b33: "The Pan-Zebrican Academic Convocation"
TRO_CTH_b33_desc: "Zebrica is vast; its knowledge, expertise and skills are just as vast, and should not be constrained by national borders. By setting up a Pan-Zebrica convocation, we will bring these great minds together and ensure that, no matter what war strikes who, science will have a haven and a refuge."
TRO_CTH_b34: "AMO Boosted Agriculture" #Alchemically Modified Organism
TRO_CTH_b34_desc: "There is only so far we can push our crop yields before they peak. It's time to push the limits on the science of Alchemy and see what types of giant plants we can grow. Imagine it, a giant mango; the bats would pay through the snout for that."
TRO_CTH_b35: "The Cartels Tamed"
TRO_CTH_b35_desc: "They are criminals; there's no way around it. Murderers, smugglers, drug dealers, gun runners and tax dodgers — every single one of them. They will come to heel, or we'll drive them into the sea with all the force we can muster."
TRO_CTH_b35_trigger: "§YMore§! cartels have been §Reliminated§! than have been §Gsubjugated§! (>=3)"
TRO_CTH_b36: "A Necessary Evil"
TRO_CTH_b36_desc: "What is a crime? We define it by a code of laws, but what of the moral dimension? If a poor mare steals a loaf of bread, we overlook the crime. The cartels may break a few laws here and there, but the resources and money they bring into the economy help make every creature's lives better."
TRO_CTH_b36_trigger: "§YMore§! cartels have been §Gsubjugated§! than have been §Reliminated§! (>=3)"
TRO_CTH_b37: "Maintain The Plantation Economy"
TRO_CTH_b37_desc: "The Plantation System works. Sure, the patricians might be lazy, but they put good managers in charge of the land. Sure, the workers are overworked but they're paid – we think – and the cotton they grow drives a thriving export business. Hard work and good management are all we need here."
TRO_CTH_b38: "The Autonomous University Of Zonicia"
TRO_CTH_b38_desc: "The finest minds in the world can be found in the Republic, so why would we bother looking any further afield? All our efforts shall be focused on providing the best academic facilities to our citizens, not catering to foreigners who might end up using our research against us."
TRO_CTH_b39: "The Poll Tax"
TRO_CTH_b39_desc: "The local regional councils require funds to maintain roads, water pipes and the electrical grid. A fixed tax - charging all of the residents in the area the same amount - is a fair way to drum up the money needed."
TRO_CTH_b40: "Trickle-Down Economics"
TRO_CTH_b40_desc: "When those at the top get richer, everyone down the line benefits as the money flows downwards through the economy. Of course, the system works. Shut up."
TRO_CTH_b41: "The Curtain Call"
TRO_CTH_b41_desc: "The Republic has been reshaped and rebuilt – for better or worse – by Benoam. Who knows what the future holds? Whatever the answer may be, we're sure to get through it as long as we hold to our principles... whatever they may be on that particular day."
TRO_CTH_b42: "The Elephant In The Room"
TRO_CTH_b42_desc: "We made some hard choices to win the war and now we will have to reckon with them. The Cartels have come, looking to settle the debts we owe them for their help. The price will be high, and they will expect payment in full. We can only hope it was worth it."

TRO_CTH_c1: "Secretary Of Defence Jebzel Zoblos"
TRO_CTH_c1_desc: "Of all the officers and soldiers who fought for our freedom Jebzel is the example to be followed. Knowing determination in combat, restraint in peace, and how to put the lives of our citizens before profit, the task of organising a formal state army shall be put in her honourable hooves."
TRO_CTH_c2: "The Mercenary Naturalisation Act"
TRO_CTH_c2_desc: "Our liberators came from all corners of the world to fight for the Republic. Motivated by honour, glory, idealism or profit, it matters not, what matters is that many lost their lives here and more found a future within these lands. Offering citizenship to all who fought would be a fitting tribute to their sacrifice and provide a boost to the fledging army."
TRO_CTH_c3: "Tighten The Chain Of Command"
TRO_CTH_c3_desc: "During the war, there was very little structure to the army, officers were let off the leash to achieve their goals in whatever way they saw fit. To avoid confusion and rebuild discipline we will need to review the chain of command and remove any dead ends. Gone are the days when a zebra could promote themselves to any old rank."
TRO_CTH_c4: "Establish The Republican Air Force"
TRO_CTH_c4_desc: "The future of war lies in with the air force. Just one squadron of CAS can wipe out divisions of armour, a dozen bombers can make the sky fall on our enemies and clear the way for an infantry push. To ensure our full military capability we shall embrace the sky like a second home."
TRO_CTH_c5: "Fullscale Defensive Regionalism"
TRO_CTH_c5_desc: "The army should be broken down to regional branches for the defence of the Republic and a level of autonomy granted. These troops know the landscape of their homes like the back of their hoof and provide expertise which would be lacking in a more general defence structure."
TRO_CTH_c6: "The Military Contractor Compensation Act"
TRO_CTH_c6_desc: "A reorganisation is needed of the various military groups within the Republic. Legislation to regulate what mercenary groups can operate where will ensure they understand their tasks and are properly paid for their services. No more looting wherever they want, they work for a wage now."
TRO_CTH_c7: "The AHC Fireteam Theorem"
TRO_CTH_c7_desc: "Fools and idiots dream of being the hero behind the lines, Daring Do style. That mindset has no place in war and will get a lot of good soldiers killed. Attack, hold, consolidate, attack, hold consolidate, a simple strategy well executed will carry the day."
TRO_CTH_c8: "Industrial Scale Warfare"
TRO_CTH_c8_desc: "In times of war we must use every asset at our disposal to defend our nation and its citizens. Drawing up plans for how to bring our full industrial and military weight to bear, well in advance, will save lives in the event of a conflict."
TRO_CTH_c9: "Air To Land Coordination Tactics"
TRO_CTH_c9_desc: "Full co-operation between the army and the air force will improve the efficiency of both, turning any conflict quickly in our favour. A joint operations branch to share information between the two is being set up to provide support quickly and accurately, wherever it's needed."
TRO_CTH_c10: "The Republican Bomber Fleet"
TRO_CTH_c10_desc: "There are stories that, in days of old, armies would blot out the sun with storms of arrows. Times may have moved on, but the principle of irresistible force remains. We shall fill the sky with bombers and lay waste to any who would threaten us."
TRO_CTH_c11: "Strike Force Operations"
TRO_CTH_c11_desc: "The future of warfare lies in small precise units, carrying out surgical strikes against the enemy, crippling them before they get a chance to retaliate. Organising these units and providing the military contractors with the resources they need to complete such dangerous tasks should be our top priority."
TRO_CTH_c12: "Military Nimbusianism"
TRO_CTH_c12_desc: "The training standards of our troops are lacking when compared with other, more militaristic nations and while we do not seek to emulate such hardships there is truth in the saying, brutal training makes for easy battles."
TRO_CTH_c13: "Restore The Armoury System"
TRO_CTH_c13_desc: "What use is a gun with no bullet, or a tank with no fuel? By taking full account of every weapon in our army we can ensure that the needs of each soldier are met, be they driver, engineer or frontline fighter."
TRO_CTH_c14: "Infantry Kit Standardisation"
TRO_CTH_c14_desc: "Providing our troops with the equipment they need to react to any challenge will keep momentum on our side as we attack. No ambush, no trap, no counterattack or outflank will catch our soldiers unprepared. Come what may, they'll be ready."
TRO_CTH_c15: "The Feathered Serpents"
TRO_CTH_c15_desc: "The snake strikes, one sharp precise attack that lays low the mightiest beast in the jungle. Such power is to be emulated and, should we give our snakes wings, they will be able to strike at any beast before they reach our lands."
TRO_CTH_c16: "Infantry Kit Specialisation"
TRO_CTH_c16_desc: "To defend everything is to defend nothing. We need to give our soldiers what they need to get the job done and nothing more to avoid them becoming bogged down with unnecessary equipment."
TRO_CTH_c17: "Prioritise Troop Mechanisation"
TRO_CTH_c17_desc: "Fast mobile troops can respond to attacks or take the initiative and drive through the gaps in enemy lines. These small, independently operating divisions will sow chaos amongst any attackers, allowing our infantry to take advantage of the enemies weakness. Good old-fashioned hit-and-run tactics on modern wheels."
TRO_CTH_c18: "Infantry Support Tank Development"
TRO_CTH_c18_desc: "Armour is the next evolution of warfare but its use is still up for discussion. If we attached armoured companies to our infantry, they will be better protected as they advance, without risk of the tanks over-extending and becoming cut off."
TRO_CTH_c19: "The Medical Rapid Response Corps"
TRO_CTH_c19_desc: "Getting our soldiers home is amongst our top priorities. We will drill our rescue and recovery crews hard to bring back as many wounded soldiers from the front as possible. Compact folding stretchers, popup field hospitals and all the modern medical tools at our disposal shall be used to save our brave troops."
TRO_CTH_c20: "Airborne Logistical Optimisation"
TRO_CTH_c20_desc: "We should focus on getting supplies and weapons to the front lines quickly. The new developments in transport aircraft can assist in this, taking some of the burdens of the supply truck convoys crossing the battlefields. Push back the enemy, then we can see to securing the area."
TRO_CTH_c21: "The Manoeuvre Warfare Theorem"
TRO_CTH_c21_desc: "The force of an armoured charge is irresistible, cutting through the lines of troops and encircling them, breaking the back of any army before they can react. Strike first, strike hard, no mercy."
TRO_CTH_c22: "The Dare To Die Corps"
TRO_CTH_c22_desc: "Then out spake brave Zanyrious, the Captain of the gate:\n"To every Zebra of this world death cometh soon or late\nand how can we die better than facing fearful odds,\nfor the ashes of our fathers and the temples of our Gods.""
TRO_CTH_c23: "Mercenary Command Structure Integration"
TRO_CTH_c23_desc: "The honour, strength and force of our mercenaries have been proven time and again. They fight for the Republic and die for the Republic just as any other soldier. Their might shall be added to our own with the formal unification of command, and let no Zebra doubt their dedication to our freedoms."
TRO_CTH_c24: "The Always Loyal Army Of The Republic"
TRO_CTH_c24_desc: "Gone are the days of the ragged banner. The standards of our armies fly high and proud, reshaped and unfurled by Jebzel's expert hoof and careful planning. The glory of the Republic is restored and what foe could hope to snatch it from us again with armies such as these at our back."

TRO_CTH_d1: "The Zahummid Committee"
TRO_CTH_d1_desc: "Devastated does not begin to describe our economy. Successive civil wars have utterly destroyed our potential. If we are to recover from this, we'll need a body that can take whatever action is necessary to pull us back from the precipice, unbound by party and politics."
TRO_CTH_d2: "Selective Bailouts"
TRO_CTH_d2_desc: "The very basics of a functional state are about to collapse out from under us. We cannot allow our essential services to flatter - the zebra of the Republic must have water and power. By bailing out the utilities we can stabilise industries further down the supply chain in one decisive action."
TRO_CTH_d3: "The Agricultural Recovery Project"
TRO_CTH_d3_desc: "Famine is ripping through our country like a blowtorch through butter. With so many of our agricultural workers pulled away to war, many of whom never came back, there are not enough hooves in the field. With a drastic program of training and mechanisation, we can begin to reclaim our fallowed fields."
TRO_CTH_d4: "Consolidate The Sophoovene Oil Fields"
TRO_CTH_d4_desc: "The need for oil during the war led to anyone with a shovel setting up independent wells. We bought what we could from whoever we could out of desperation but now that peace has returned it's time to consolidate these independent wells into more efficiently run enterprises."
TRO_CTH_d5: "Prioritise Cash Crop Cultivation"
TRO_CTH_d5_desc: "An acre of wheat will feed a family, but an acre of cotton will turn enough of a profit to feed 5 families. By focusing on our exportable agriculture, we can use the profits to import food, feed our zebra and balance the budget at the same time."
TRO_CTH_d6: "Foreclose Unprofitable Assets"
TRO_CTH_d6_desc: "We cannot continue to support unprofitable enterprises; the state is nearly bankrupt with debt repayments from the wars. By allowing failed businesses to collapse we'll open up the market to new companies, spurring creativity and relieving the government of some of its burdens."
TRO_CTH_d7: "Incentivise Middle-Class Asset Growth"
TRO_CTH_d7_desc: "A modern nation needs a functioning middle class to help facilitate and run a growing economy. If we encourage the growth of this returning middle class we can become more economically flexible whilst increasing demand for the goods they require. Who said nothing good comes from middle mares."
TRO_CTH_d8: "Establish Credit Caps"
TRO_CTH_d8_desc: "Credit is an essential tool in economic development, it allows for the purchasing of goods without requiring full upfront payment, but It's a double-edged sword which can land the unprepared in debts they cannot cover. We'll have to keep a close eye on credit limits to protect our citizens from unscrupulous businesses."
TRO_CTH_d9: "Utilise The Natural Gas Deposits"
TRO_CTH_d9_desc: "There are large deposits of natural gas under Sophoovene. Mining it is an engineering challenge but if we're successful we can use it to support our growing fuel demands, freeing up more oil for military usage."
TRO_CTH_d10: "Experimental Fracking Methods"
TRO_CTH_d10_desc: "Fracking is a new, and somewhat controversial, technology that involves pumping chemicals into the ground to "crack" open gas deposits. It's an ingenious idea that opens up new resources to drive our economy. Perhaps a little investment would be worthwhile."
TRO_CTH_d11: "Falsify Colthage's  Credit Rating"
TRO_CTH_d11_desc: "The constant turmoil of the last few years has left no trust in our economic surety, thus few nations are willing to invest or lend us credit. This reputation will break us unless we engage in some "creative accounting". We cannot let our zebra suffer due to some numbers on a page."
TRO_CTH_d12: "Safeguard Patrician Assets"
TRO_CTH_d12_desc: "The Patricians are the single largest holders of wealth in the Republic. By offering protections on their assets we can encourage them to invest more of their money into the economy in the knowledge that their investments are safe."
TRO_CTH_d13: "Horizontal Economic Planning"
TRO_CTH_d13_desc: "Specialisation may be efficient but one mistake and the system collapses. By developing a wide range of economic fields, the Republic will be able to shrug off the worst a volatile market has to throw at us."
TRO_CTH_d14: "Incentivise The Estancia System"
TRO_CTH_d14_desc: "A stagnate agricultural sector will land us back where we started. Smaller holdings and privatised farming are flexible in a way that mass cultivation cannot be. The needs of our Zebra will change, and we must be able to change with them."
TRO_CTH_d15: "The Sophoovene Technical Institute"
TRO_CTH_d15_desc: "With our mining, drilling and processing facilities centred in Sophoovene it makes perfect sense to construct a new engineering institute nearby to train the next generation of experts. With adequate funds, we can sponsor a new RnD department and design the wells of the future in our backyard."
TRO_CTH_d16: "The Latifundium System"
TRO_CTH_d16_desc: "The demand for our products is starting to return and we should ensure that we can meet that demand. By collectivising smaller farms into a single entity our productivity will increase, and any excess can go into helping to feed our zebra."
TRO_CTH_d17: "The Invisible Hoof Of The Free Market"
TRO_CTH_d17_desc: "The market is too volatile to be controlled or influenced. Spending our efforts to try and protect ourselves has always proven a waste of time. If we are to succeed, we must learn to ride the rise and falls to always come out on top."
TRO_CTH_d18: "The United Colthaginian Utilities Company"
TRO_CTH_d18_desc: "A single company set up to provide for the power, water and communication needs of the Republic will guarantee no zebra is left in the dark. With the reach, resources and skills pool of the whole nation at its fingertips, we're sure to get the best of the best."
TRO_CTH_d19: "Standardise Bank Bailouts"
TRO_CTH_d19_desc: "A flat rate bailout available to all banks, should they get into difficulty, will keep the sector secure and fair. The savings of our citizens will not be put at risk, it's their hard work that makes the Republic a nation to be proud of."
TRO_CTH_d20: "May The Market Run Free"
TRO_CTH_d20_desc: "Regulation is safety but it will stop us from reaching our true economic potential, no zebra ever achieved greatness through safety. To make full use of our industrial might we shall deregulate the market and allow our citizens the chance to take their destiny into their hooves. Full steam ahead."
TRO_CTH_d21: "Regionalise The Public Utilities Network" #This one is a bit weird, but the basic gist is that Colthage establishes several private Utility Companies for each region of Colthage responsible for the distribution of utilities in the region - This 
TRO_CTH_d21_desc: "The needs of Republic vary from region to region and city to city. If we rely on one mega-company to deal with these demands' things will fall through the cracks. Allowing smaller, independent companies to service individual states will give us a choice of the best service in each region."
TRO_CTH_d22: "The Prosperous Society Theorem"
TRO_CTH_d22_desc: "The cycle of wealth continues to grow. Through proper education, regulation and grants, our businesses become more successful, creating more profits which feed back into the cycle. The steady hoof, the clear eye and the patient mind will come out on top while others fail and falter on the open market."
TRO_CTH_d23: "The Work For Bread Program"
TRO_CTH_d23_desc: "Through our reforms, the Republic has gone from ravaged poverty to rising industrial power, but not all of our zebra are fortunate enough to share in the rising wealth. We should make every effort to ensure they do not want. By offering food subsidies in exchange for labour, famine shall become a distant memory."
TRO_CTH_d24: "The Economic Miracle"
TRO_CTH_d24_desc: "Through hard work, patient planning and cutting-edge approaches to industry, the Republic has risen from the ashes of our destruction into an economic giant the envy of Zebrica. Truly Gerza was the leader we dreamed he'd be and more."

TRO_CTH_e1: "Open For Business"
TRO_CTH_e1_desc: "As the Republic begins to stabilise, we can start looking at building up a trading network. We sit on a crossroads of shipping lanes and have access to many quality produce the world will pay handsomely for."
TRO_CTH_e2: "Operation: Steppe Charger"
TRO_CTH_e2_desc: "We have not forgotten our time spent under Quaggatai Hooves. Now is the moment to settle that debt and we will be paid in full."
TRO_CTH_e3: "North Sea Diplomacy"
TRO_CTH_e3_desc: "Across the Alaudian and Kion seas the vast trade markets of Griffonia are waiting for our wares. They'll pay through the beak for our goods, all we need is a little careful diplomacy to get our hoof in the door."
TRO_CTH_e4: "Restore Order To Coltdar"
TRO_CTH_e4_desc: "The lands of Coltdar have a common history with us, they too suffered under Quaggatai. Offering full citizenship to them would be a nice gesture and - with our economic growth – there would certainly be a lot of takers."
TRO_CTH_e5: "A Barrel Of Bats, Fish and Idiots"
TRO_CTH_e5_desc: "You know what it's like to have difficult neighbours, always causing problems in the area, yelling and fighting all the time, invading next door's garden and annexing the barbeque. They're like foals and it won't stop unless we do something about it."
TRO_CTH_e6: "The Hindian Connection"
TRO_CTH_e6_desc: "Hindia has access to rare resources worth vast amounts on the international market. Often overlooked, this corner of Zebrica is just waiting for a little bit of investment and a helping hoof to get started."
TRO_CTH_e7: "Refudiate Marksist Oppression"
TRO_CTH_e7_desc: "Yes, wherever nations are threatened or menaced by Communism, the Republic is ready to stand as the bulwark of freedom and liberty. We too had to fight to cast off the chains of our oppressors and rise to the heights we have. Let us stand by those who cannot help themselves."
TRO_CTH_e8: "The Principle Of Diplomatic Pragmatism"
TRO_CTH_e8_desc: "There are times when it suits us to not help our friends. Likewise, there are times when it helps us to help those we call enemies. The world is a complicated place and to get the most out of it requires... flexibility."

### Events ###
trotkart_colthage.1.t: "The Generalissimo Who Never Won A Battle"
trotkart_colthage.1.d: "The cheers of the crowds rang in his ears as Benoam Gerza returned to his office, the adrenaline fading into his natural state of cold calculation. At last, his chance had come. Years of subtle diplomacy and political intrigue had placed him at the top of the fledgling republic; granted no one else had wanted the job but that mattered little to him. He'd built his life on exceeding expectations, just like his father before him. Rising from the rural lands of Coltva, they'd always been looked down on by the zebra of the capital and their ilk, forced to fight tooth and hoof for every scrap of influence and respect. Overlooked and ignored, their family had learned to use guile, subtlety and no small amount of cunning to rise through the ranks of politics.\n\nTaking his seat behind his desk he glanced over the military reports provided by his generals. It was obvious that they'd been dumbed down, draft numbers and arms shipments reduced to "need guns here" but he didn't care, he'd be the first to admit he wasn't much of a soldier. His time in the army was largely ceremonial but that was what his officers and mercenaries were for. They'd fight the battles, he just had to get them what they needed.\n\nHe was in the enviable position of being the political balance between the psychotic Hiram and the idealists of Zanit; with the fanatics removed both sides came running to his cause. Many of the old guard and industrialists flocked to him, promising financial support in exchange for protection. The youth of the Scientific Clique offered technology to give him the edge in the conflict. Even some of the more dubious, possibly criminal, elements of Colthaginian society came forward with offers of aid, in exchange for reasonable concessions of course. A bit could buy a gun and with enough Zhekels, he'd buy an army and take the Republic for himself. It was time for Gerza to demonstrate to the world what he could do.\n\nHe picked up a picture of his father from the desk."
trotkart_colthage.1.a: "I'll show them a country bumpkin..."

trotkart_colthage.2.t: "The Knights Of The Modern Era"
trotkart_colthage.2.d: "The Sloppy Stallion had never seen such good business. The door to the bar was now propped open to save the wear on the hinges as zebra came and went. The mercenaries that came through viewed each other with disdain through to downright hatred despite fighting on the same side, fighting for Gerza. They still needed a place to drink and spend their Zhekels without descending into a brawl though. That was where the owner, Tepid Pour, stepped in. He set up The Sloppy Stallion as neutral territory and started building his fortune.\n\nAll the Mercs drank here on their way through the region, Mad Mic, Raw Deal, even Jebzel Zoblos who'd been spotted a few times at the bar. Through this network of uneasy truces Tepid got all the news from the front, and even some Zhekels of info they'd no doubt shoot him over, as the leaders of each of the groups discussed their fortunes. Collecting some mugs and plates from the tables he overheard just such a conversation. A visibly battle-hardened zebra shares a table with a Pegasus.\n\n"Another few truckloads of Vultures heading for Colturubis tomorrow I heard. Let's hope they get slaughtered, more Zhekels in my bag when my guys go in to clean up the mess." The zebra drunkenly slurred.\n\n"Makes you wonder doesn't it." The Pegasus replied. Her getup had all the hallmarks of Nimbusia about it. The fighting brought in mercs from all over. "Where's Gerza getting the money from? I heard he gave the Fleet Hooves enough Zhekels to buy an island just for trying to take Zaptis."\n\n"He's got some deal going with the Tigers I heard. Either that or he craps gold."\n\n"Nah, Bodzathart, he's financing it all, I'm sure of it, not that I care. As long as the Zhekels keep coming, I'm happy. We'll prove our worth next week on the road to Colthage."\n\n"Better watch yourself." The old veteran replied, "One day you'll end up like the Vultures."\n\n"Ha, If I'm gonna die, I'll die drunk and rich. What more can a mare hope for." The Pegasus emptied her cider before staggering off to the bar for more.\n\n"Moron." Murmuring under his breath, the zebra leaned across and pulled some papers from the Pegasus' bag. "Good luck without any maps." The zebra emptied his mug and headed for the door. Tepid shook his head and collected the mugs. Same thing, different day."
trotkart_colthage.2.a: "To profit and a good death!"

trotkart_colthage.3.t: "Yet Another Cog"
trotkart_colthage.3.d: "The evening had passed in a fog of cigar smoke, whiskey and the clanking of the accounting machines. A stream of constant funds coming in from all over the country and beyond funnelled through and straight out again for the war effort, all added and deducted to come down to this, the final tally. In one column were the Zhekels the Republic still had in the bank, a nice round zero in black ink. In the other column was the total debt they owed, somewhere between eyewatering and soul-crushing, in red ink. Turns out wars are expensive. Feeding and equipping soldiers is breaking the back of the nation's finances and that was before they even thought about paying them.\n\nAzizelqart, Gerza's new financial advisor, had passed the point of despairing and come to a single conclusion. Gerza had to keep winning. As long as they kept pushing forwards they could loot the taken lands to pay their debt which, combined with the donations and contributions from the industrialists, should be able to keep them afloat. After finally winning the war the new state could get things under control and repay the loans at their own pace.\n\nIt was wishful thinking he knew but what else could he do? If the war went against them or even stalled out things would only get worse until they went bankrupt. He had to trust in Gerza's leadership and ability to prosecute the war – it was about five minutes later when Azize started planning to funnel money into an undersea account. If they lost he'd need a fallback. Hiram winning would be a disaster, at best he'd be able to flee the country, at worst he'd lose his head, but under Zanit there might still be a place for him. With some Zhekels in his account he could secure a position in the new state, everyone had their price, even Zanit.\n\nMarking the planned transfer as "Military surplus expenditure" he cleared any records that might tie the account to him, just in case any zebra might go snooping around. He was a survivor and no matter who won this war he was determined to come out on the winning side."
trotkart_colthage.3.a: "I managed to fix Zarishat's books..."

trotkart_colthage.4.t: "Sentimientos"
trotkart_colthage.4.d: ""That seems... respectable." Shama Zurumilki concurred as she drew a circle around Neigheris and the surrounding land. The map was covered in lines and circles, the newly agreed upon boundaries of the five cartels. Around the table were gathered the five heads of the most powerful crime families in Colthage, each there to carve up the state following the war. Zuan Abizaal of the Abizaal Syndicate had laid claim to the Amanesya region, the perfect spot of underground labs within easy reach of Quaggatai. Shama of the Zurumilki family had taken the oil wells around Neigheris. The Zaga Brotherhood, led by the mad monk Father Zisco, had been granted free passage through the provinces to preach their twisted version of faith, provided their debauched parties ran on Abizaal drugs of course. Zermelqart, founder and head of the Zapsa Syndicate had taken the Sivmareas and Zamitha provinces, easier access to the border crossings into Hippogriffia. With a little support from the Zaga Brotherhood, they'd also gotten the use of the rivers that ran throughout Colthage to move their wares. A smuggler's dream.\n\nLast, but by no means least, was Zicardo of the Tiger Syndicate. The most dangerous of the cartels, the Tiger ran guns up and down the length of the nation. More than once had they gotten carried away and used the very weapons they were meant to be selling. Only the combined strength of the other four cartels could bring Zicardo to the negotiating table. Unstable though he was, he wasn't stupid. He could see what was going on just as clearly as the others.\n\nGerza's push for power and the civil war had presented an opportunity they could not afford to pass up. If they supported his efforts and helped him secure his power then Colthage would be a playground for the cartels, they just had to ensure they didn't waste their strength fighting each other and give Gerza a chance to get rid of them when the war concluded. A pact had been struck in that empty warehouse on the waterfront, the Republic carved up and an agreement not to mess with each other's business was reached. Each of them around the table knew that gaining power was simple, keeping it was the real challenge. There was enough blood on their hooves to attest to that."
trotkart_colthage.4.a: "From the shadows, Colthage will be ours."

trotkart_colthage.5.t: "A Leech Among Leeches"
trotkart_colthage.5.d: ""And the risotto for you Sir." The waiter set the plate before the zebra.\n\n"Thank you kindly." He replied, adjusting his tie slightly. Zaalisillhek Bodzathart regarded the others around the table. Industrialists and landlords from all over Colthage that he'd called together – snakes and thieves the lot of them, couldn't trust them as far as you could throw them. The waiters departed having served each of those present, leaving Zaalis to begin with a smile mostly made of teeth, reciting his prepared speech.\n\n"My friends, firstly, thank you for joining me, it has been too long since we've seen each other. Of course, we've all been busy, building this wonderful country into something we could be proud of, alas, 'twas not to last. Anarchism has shredded any resemblance to order the Republic once held. We've all suffered, our business' vandalised, our interests –"\n\n"Get to the point!" A zebra interrupted; mouth full of gold teeth and half-chewed food.\n\n"As forthright as ever Zquard." Zaalis replied with gritted teeth. "The point is this: If Hiram or Zanit win the war, we've had it. Done, finished, foreclosed and spent without recourse. Our only option is to rally behind Gerza, that way we can keep and even expand on our interests. Being from Coltva, he's a zebra who can be manipula- who... can be professionally guided towards the right decisions. We here, the greatest industrial minds in the country, can help build this nation back into a prosperous one. Some might accuse us of having an agenda. Nonsense, absurd, It's just unfortunate that lifting our fellow zebra involves raising our status, the rising tide lifts all ships after all. This will require teamwork, a real partnership, so what do you say?"\n\n"Beautifully argued." Zquard agreed. "I see now we have a moral duty to help pull the Republic back from the brink in any way we can, and if we should be rewarded it will be no more than we've earned." He raised a glass to Zaalis.\nLifting his glass, Zaalis returned the gesture as the clink of crystal around the table signalled the agreement of those present. "Always nice to have these little chats amongst... friends.""
trotkart_colthage.5.a: "Ever greater riches await us."

trotkart_colthage.6.t: "A Port In The Storm"
trotkart_colthage.6.d: ""You need to rein it in." Gerza set the decanter down with a thump to emphasise his point. Crossing back across his office to take his seat at the desk, he passed one of the two glasses to Jebzel Zoblos.\n\n"How am I supposed to do that when my forces see the other mercs raiding, pillaging and getting rich whilst mine sit around struggling to get by? They haven't been paid for two months and it's getting harder to keep them in line." She sipped at her bourbon, the gentle burn strengthening her resolve.\n\n"Don't worry about the pay, I've sorted it. The trucks will drop off the money next week."\n\n"That's what you said last week."\n\n"It's sorted, trust me just..." Trailing off he sighed and emptied his glass in one go. "Ok, let me be frank with you, Jebzel, you're the only one I can trust out of those packs of bloodhounds and treasure hunters. This war won't last forever and when it does finally come to an end questions will be asked about who allowed those raids and atrocities to take place. I need it on the record that I tried to stop them, I cannot be held responsible or it's all for nothing. These bands of roving thugs call themselves soldiers but they're little more than gangs and they will be held accountable for what they've done, even wars have rules. Do you see what I'm saying? When the dust settles I need to be above reproach but I can't do that alone.\n\n"The Republic will need an army, a proper army, led by a professional, battle-hardened commander, not some jumped-up thug in an ill-fitting uniform. I want you to be that zebra and for that, you need to show that your soldiers are soldiers, not savages."\n\nJebzel turned the glass over in her hooves. "So you're allowing the other mercs to run loose so you can build up evidence against them, even whilst they help you win the war." She stated.\n\n"Sometimes a gift is not a gift." He returned to the decanter and refilled his glass. "Your team will have it hard yes, they'll see others getting rich while they fight but their reward will come and it will far outstretch some stolen Zhekels. I just need you to keep them disciplined. If anyone can do that it's you." He offered her a top-up to go with his truths. Nodding, she held out her glass."
trotkart_colthage.6.a: ""I'll do my best.""

trotkart_colthage.7.t: "Boundless Optimism"
trotkart_colthage.7.d: "Zuan smiled as he greeted the visitors, directing them to their seats in front of the stage, they'd have a good view of his talk. After the University had effectively shut down due to the successive civil wars he'd been cast adrift, unsure of what to do with himself – with the whole country tearing itself apart yet again there didn't seem much time for science and research. The only knowledge that seemed to matter was how to kill and wage war. That was when the party found him and reminded him that science was about more than progress for its own sake, it was about making life better for the common zebra.\n\nThe talks started soon after that, The Young Scientifics, as the group called themselves were the heirs to the Scientific Clique that collapsed during the previous wars. Whilst more idealistic than their predecessors they still held high standards for their members, with membership granted only through invitation. Zuan knew the honour he'd been given when his invitation came and he accepted at once, the chance wouldn't come again. They counted amongst their number engineers, doctors, chemists and more. They went from town-to-town teaching Zebra and ponies how to repair generators damaged by bombs, how to dress a shrapnel wound, and how to make basic herbal antiseptics. They took no payment for their time but were always warmly received, often the locals were happy just to talk about something other than the war. This approach allowed them to connect directly with the grassroots, and build up support they could wield in the political sphere.\n\nGerza himself had taken an interest in their movement, offered them a seat at the table in exchange for the expertise they could provide and Zuan was very keen to get his hooves into the task. Politics was where the problems were, the causes of the wars, but then their movement was about fixing problems, about helping make the Republic a better place. They could repair as many water pipes as they wanted but it wouldn't save the world, only repairing the political system would do that.\n\nPushing the thoughts from his mind he focused on the task at hoof, tonight he would give a talk on physics involved in repairing a building and how to ensure it didn't collapse in the process."

trotkart_colthage.8.d: "Peace at last. The cycle of war and destruction come to an end, again. The zebras of the Republic are happy and celebrating, but they've been here before. A great deal of work is required if they're going to trust the new government.\n\nGerza is just the zebra for that. He has proven himself more than capable of balancing the matters of state and war whilst steering the ship of the nation through civil strife. Some wonder though, is he a zebra of peace? Can he maintain the balance he has struck and rebuild the country into its former glory? Every citizen of the Republic hopes he can succeed, they're tired of war and want their old lives back, all that can be done now is to watch and wait."

trotkart_colthage.9.d: "The party was in full swing, the grand hall full of music and light, laughter in every corner, a banquet to feed hundreds and at the centre of it all Jebzel Zoblos. Cutting a dashing figure in her new uniform, she basked in the attention of every guest as they congratulated her. She knew it was all politics, every guest at the party had been carefully selected and vetted; there would be no awkward scenes tonight and everyone knew what was expected of them. In 3 months each of them would be back asking for a new defence contract, weapons deal or to look the other way when their brother got caught smuggling again, but she didn't care at all. The supreme commander of the Colthaginian armed forces enjoyed every moment of it and why shouldn't she, she'd earned this, her soldiers had suffered terribly during the war, restricted from their rightful plunder and spoils but now she could reward them and all her allies, Gerza approving of course.\n\nGerza watched on; he'd made a good choice in her, personally, of course, if she turned out to be good at her job then even better but that was less important. What mattered most was the loyalty of the army and with Jebzel in charge, they were in his back pocket. He'd won the war for the nation and now there was nothing to stop them.\n\n"How you pulled this off I'll never know." Azizelqart appeared at his shoulder "She should be in prison not in charge of the army, surely some zebra in the senate objected to this."\n\n"A few." Garza replied casually. "But when you've got them by the short hairs, their hearts and minds will follow." He raised his glass to Jebzel who smiled at him across the room."

The wood spat and crackled as the four mercenaries settled themselves again.\n"Anyway, get on with the story."\n\n"Well, I reversed the truck, clipped the building and the whole thing came down and buried me. Woke up 3 days later in a hospital and there she was sitting at my bedside. She'd dug me out while the rescue teams were still on the way and now, we're getting married in three months."\n"So, you're staying here then?" The pegasus put in. "You poor sod. First chance I get I'm on a ship back to Nimbusi. Got my family to think about."\n\n"Why not bring them here?" One of the two unicorns queried, swigging from a bottle. "My brother's coming over from Baltimare, he's going to set up a lumberyard, there's plenty of demand for rebuilding materials. Should be able to send some contracts his way once I'm a Major."\n"You been offered a commission in the new army too? I'm going to be a colonel. Got a stallion I'm sweet on over in Colthage, can't resist a uniform." The Zebra smirked as he tossed another log on the fire. "Might as well get the most out of it right, I mean, I got shot for this country."\n\n"You got shot because you were drunk, fell down the stairs and shot yourself in the leg. I'm still amazed you didn't blow your brains out."\nThe pegasus stared into the fire nursing her beer. "I could bring my two fillies across, take up that special forces commission, wouldn't take much, I'd just have to leave my pride behind in Nimbusi." she smirked.\n"Hah! Good, your pride nearly got us killed, I was at the battle of Colthage remember, I saw you trying to lead that charge through the weapons factory, talk about herding cats, I love that story go on, tell it."\n\nShe sighed with a smile and regarded the friends. They'd come here as soldiers looking for adventure, to fight for money and now, well, the future was uncertain. "Things went wrong before we started. Two nights before, while I was drinking in the bar, some bastard nicked my maps so we were already behind schedule. I said that looks like a shortcut over...""

trotkart_colthage.11.d: ""Reporting Sir." The Captain saluted as he stood to attention doing his best to hide a smile, finally, his moment had come. He'd been called to General Mad Mic's office in the early evening as the sunset cast the room into half shadow, he'd heard about the commissions in the new army being given out to mercs over the last few days and this appointment had to be a big one.\n\n"We've been going over your war record Captain." The General addressed him leaning back on her desk. "Quite frankly I am disgusted." The Captain's face dropped. "Your conduct has been appalling. Looting, arson, assaulting the locals, neglecting your duties, being drunk on active duty. We cannot and will not stand for this in the army of the Republic. You are hereby stripped of your rank and dishonourably discharged. Dismissed." The captain stood dumbfounded. He couldn't process what he was hearing. The General watched him. "Did I stutter?"\n\n"You can't be serious. The Defence secretary is a war criminal and I'm being fired for doing my job?! Yeah, I might have had a drink now and then but I didn't burn down a town!"\n"I said you're dismissed!"\n"You can't dismiss me, I know things, I'll take her down with me! I was at Gades, I know why it's not on the maps anymore. This is Gerza's doing! That bastard's protecting her. He's so crooked he sleeps in a spiral staircase. I'll take them all down, him and his piece of-" The General crossed the room and headbutted the former captain who crumpled to the floor with a shout, his cries cut off as Mad Mic put her boot in the shamed officer's gut.\n\n"Guards!" The door burst open as two earth ponies stormed in, guns at the ready. "Get this civilian off my base! Help him fall down some stairs and break his jaw, that'll teach him not to spread lies. Make sure it heals badly." The guards grabbed his legs and dragged him from the office, closing the door behind them as they went. General Mic sighed and leaned against her desk, turning to look into the shadows where Jebzel stood.\n\n"Who's next?" She smiled."

Don't want to get hauled in for filing the wrong thing again."\n"How was I to know that extortion and bribery were different forms? I'm a soldier, not a bureaucrat."\n\nThe Captain rolled his eyes as he finished sorting out the Zhekels on the table. In the old days, three officers counting Zhekels out of a sack on a table in a bar would have raised a few eyebrows, now it was all official and above board, every bit was accounted for and all transactions were out in the open. It was a simple system, the local defence forces would collect donations from businesses, farmers, factories, etc. They'd keep their cut for collecting the Zhekels and the rest would be sent up the chain, all fair and even-hoofed. The locals were even glad of the service, they got a receipt for their donations which they could use to claim back some tax and, unlike in the old days, they got the protection they paid for. Nothing like a tank shell to see off the timberwolves. Tepid Pour, the bar owner, was also glad of the extra business, on a good day the officers coming through would buy a few rounds for the bar.\n\nThe system worked. It might be corrupt but when every creature was corrupt they all benefitted. The rising tide lifts all boats."

The tailor worked his way around the battle-hardened zebra's leg, taking his time to take every measurement twice, only the finest quality work for the old war hero. The new suit would emphasise his scars, with a low-cut collar to show off the strength of his neck muscles, he could picture it all as he looked in the mirror. "I'll not complain, I've done my share of fighting and I'm going to enjoy the easy life I'm entitled to." He stepped out of the fitting room, the tailor finishing up his work and making some final notes.\n\n"I'll send the final design to you Sir." The veteran nodded as he re-joined his two comrades in the waiting area where they sipped whiskey awaiting his return. This was what it was all about, the high life and reward they'd fought for, no more battlefield looting or pillaging, Jebzel's reforms made them salaried soldiers, licensed by the Republic, and business was good.\n\n"All done? I got lunch with Zquard in an hour. He's trying to sell me on some contract spare parts for tanks." A laid-back unicorn said\n\n"We've not got any tanks in our division."\n\n"So? That doesn't mean we can't buy some. Either way, he's paying for lunch, I want to get my Zhekels worth." She said with a smirk.

Poker requires skill, talent and we all know how to play, so just deal."\n\nThe three soldiers, two zebra and a deer sat around the table in the guard post; they were the only ones on duty, not much call to protect a supply depot in the middle of the jungle. For the last three weeks, the only things that had come through were the trains carrying fuel and the trucks that needed it and none of them stayed long, why would they? The depot was as close to nowhere as it was possible to be and they were stuck in the middle of it, one stop on a long road to places that matter.\n\n"What are you going to do with your leave?" The deer asked dealing out the cards, he could do this with his eyes closed, three weeks of Appleloosa hold 'em burned the movement into muscle memory.\n"See my wife, eat 'til I can't stand and drink 'til I can't see. You?" The greying zebra sighed.\n"Much the same, it's a sensible plan, why ruin it." The bearded zebra replied. "Three weeks stuck here makes you appreciate the simple pleasures. 1 week of that then another 3 weeks of this hellhole."\n"Let's be honest, we're sick of everything here." The deer interrupted, sliding some Zhekels into the pot. "3 weeks of sitting in this shack watching convoys come and go with nothing but a deck of cards and that radio to stay sane and all it picks up is some Chital talk show, I'm amazed we haven't gone mad and shot each other. Hey did you feel that?" The deer looked at a glass of water on the table where slight ripples danced.\n\n"Feels like a convoy." The bearded zebra sighed climbing to his hooves and collecting his Zhekels. "Alright, you go check the fuel reserves, I'll get the trucks lined up, and you get the fuel hoses out.

The lieutenant stubbed out her cigar on the garage wall; she'd been waiting for the last hour for this truck and was long passed jokes.\n\n"What went wrong."\n"We blew a tyre 4 miles out." The driver, a young thestral private, said with a smile as he climbed out of the cab "Had to drive back on the flat. I did say we shouldn't have removed the spare."\n\n"We couldn't risk the weight. The truck might have gotten bogged down, but I take your point. We'll just take one less crate in future. Any other trouble?"\n"Nope, all went according to plan. We loaded up the gun crates, headed south on the usual patrol route, met Father Zisco and his goons near the border, gave him the crates, loaded up the coke and here we are, missus one wheel."\n"Good, I've declared the guns faulty and have listed them as being destroyed. Don't fix the wheel, take the truck over to the workshop and make sure they see the flat, tell them the spare was damaged." The lieutenant and private walked around the truck to find the three zebra had unloaded three bags of coke and one gun crate from the truck.\n\n"What in the name of all that is holy is that?!" The lieutenant pointed at the crate.\n"Relax, Zisco won't miss it, he was too high to count what we gave him and we can sell it on to someone else. Pure profit."\n"Well, I hope for your sake you're right because if he finds out you've screwed him over, he'll use you as a living cushion for his next party."

There was little point in sorting items into specific locations as it just made stealing them easier. The medics, a middle-aged unicorn and a young zebra not long out of university spent most of their day just keeping track of what had been pinched the previous day. They might as well have just put up a sign that said "If we don't see you take it, you can keep it." The only upside being replacement stock was easy to come by now the market was flooded with stolen drugs. Easy come, easy go, it would just be nice if some of those drugs found their way into patients now and again.\n\n"Here let me." The Unicorn's horn glowed as he sterilised the scissors with magic.

The noise in the plane was deafening as the wind ripped past the opening and the engines roared outside as a final thud sounded the doors closed and deadened the rumble. Treetops bending in their wake as they flew on, low to the ground to avoid radar detection; an off-the-record job, a few Zhekels on the side, who could it hurt? The bomb bay, lit by dim red light and which had once held the weapons to level a small town, held three large wooden crates suspended from a railing along the roof. The crates were void of markings or writing which might reveal their contents as they slide along the bomb rail, the next one taking its place over the bomb bay doors.\n\nThe air in the bomb bay could freeze the antlers off a deer, no creature would choose to willing spend time in there for fear of what else might drop off. Whoever had designed the plane deliberately made it as inhospitable as possible, as though they were guilty of having built a flying machine of death and didn't want anyone to use it. No bombs fell tonight, just nondescript packages for unknown owners but that would do little to appease their ultimate victims. A crate of guns here, drugs there, bathtub gin, poorly refined drums of oil, outdated medical supplies, their effect delayed but no less destructive than the bombs normally occupy the hold.\n\nThe alarm sounded again, the light went green and a package slid from the rail, disappearing into the night below.\n\nAnother heartbroken, another life shattered, another crate delivered."

The square before the senate thundered, rammed from end to end with every creature great and small, flags and banners held aloft in the wind, the force of stamping hooves cracking the paving stones. Beautiful patriotic chaos. Through the middle of it, all marched the ranks of The Sufrits' Chosen, the most renowned regiment of the new Republican army. The sun glinting off the brass buttons of their uniforms, they cut a noble figure as they marched. Behind them came The Republic's Anvil, the latest tank division deployed, kitted out with the latest designs. This was an army to be proud of. They've come a long way from the ragged banners of the civil war.\n\nGerza stood upon a dais taking the salute as the armed forces marched by, his voice carrying over the sound of the parade "The Republic has risen from the bonfire of its past. The armed farmer is now a trained soldier, our army, a professional elite force, our air force the envy of Zebrica, our navy rules from here to the Dragon Lands. For the first time in years, you are safe. You. Are. Protected. We have one Zebra to thank for this. One mare who put the needs of our Republic and our citizens before her own. A soldier of honour, a zebra of outstanding character, Jebzel Zoblos!" A squadron of bombers flew low overhead as the crowd erupted. JEBZEL! JEBZEL! JEBZEL! They chanted. Gerza inclined his head to her as she took the stand; a strong, noble yet humble figure.\n\n"Thank you Sufrit. This is not a day to honour me, well maybe a little, but today is for our service mares and stallions, to honour them and the sacrifices they have made to build our military to the force it is today."

The zebra had aged ten years in appearance; true he had not fought in the war but long nights trawling through financial reports and balancing the books had taken their toll. "Ah, Aziz, do come in and take a seat. I take this is about your..." He flicked through a stack of papers to find his notes "economic development plan." He smirked knowingly.\n\n"Yes, you see" closing the door behind him, he crossed the room and took a seat before the Sufrit "If we begin making some changes to our economic model we can relieve the ongoing famine and boast our economic growth at the same time. It's all there in my report." He gestured to a folder buried under a stack of similar folders. "I take it you've read it?"\n\nBenoam leaned back in his chair. "So, who are we scamming?" He smiled as the economist had the shame to look shocked and slightly insulted. "Aziz, I know you, I also know about the 'escape fund' you had stashed away during the war. When you're making money someone else is losing it."\n\n"Sufrit, it's not like that. I propose we set up several state-managed companies to rebuild and adjust the economy and then sell them when they become profitable, returning the funds to the treasury. This will allow us to reinvest while the original enterprise continues to operate, creating an ever-increasing pool of capital and industry for the nation. It just works. The profits from the sales of these companies would benefit the state-"\n\n"And as we are the state we stand to benefit?" Benoam cut in, an eyebrow raised. Aziz quietly nodded. "Hmm, interesting." He stroked his chin "Fine, you have my approval to implement your plan, but I want your signature on every deal; if this goes wrong it's on you." He pulled the proposal from the stack - ignoring the rest of the folders that tumbled to the floor – and placed his hoofmark on the signature line before passing it to the smiling accountant.

She mumbled as she staggered from the office to the canteen. The building was quiet at this time of night, only the most dedicated, boring, or miserable zebra still worked at this hour; she wasn't sure which category she fell into.\n\nThere were thousands of businesses in the Republic teetering on the edge of bankruptcy and she had to decide which ones to give bailouts to and which ones would be left to collapse. How do you even begin to decide that? There was no system for this. Use purely economic reasons? The barest essential services should be maintained and then any more advanced industries – which were profitable before the war – helped back to their hooves; but then what about the moral element? A lot of the applications were for small family businesses which might not be very profitable but provided work for local families and their communities. These applications were usually accompanied by a letter imploring the government for help and, despite being told not to read them, she couldn't stop herself going through the accounts of those about to collapse for want of support.\n\nThe whole task had left her emotionally drained and physically exhausted, there was no fair way to make these choices, for every one business she saved, ten went under. Head bowed as she returned to her desk she stared in defeat at the stacks of applications, the ticking of the clock on the wall the only company in this deary task.\n\n"I'd be better just picking at random." She grumbled. "You know what, sod it!" Picking up a clump of applications and laying them out on the table before her, she closed her eyes."

Is there something wrong with the training practices for the auditors? We really must investigate this." The mistakes in the paperwork were getting out of hoof. When Botrys had been appointed administrative supervisor he thought it'd be easy going. Make sure all the paperwork was in order before it was sent up the chain and he'd have an easy life, but there were so many mistakes in the reports he had to review that he didn't know where to begin.\n\nAuditors would be sent out to investigate a business, they report that the business was not profitable and return their findings to the office. The enforcement officers would then be sent out to close the business only to report that the auditors had made a mistake and the business was profitable. This happened 4-5 times a week and it was costing too many hours to correct these mistakes.\n\n"Sir there is one alternative. I..." The clerk glanced around making sure the door was closed. "I suspect corruption, Sir. The enforcement officers are being bribed to not shut these businesses. Demna just bought a new house, Sir, that's not possible with what we pay her."\n"Do you? Send her in a once." The clerk nodded and left the office in a hurry. Corruption, in this department, what a ghastly thought. The enforcement officer entered the room, a glint of concern in her eyes\n\n"You wanted to see me, Sir?" \n"Yes, I've heard reports of possible corruption in this office." The officer's face dropped; guilt written across her features. She didn't even try to deny it, she wasn't a good actor. He stared at her in shock, realising instantly that it was true.

"The plan is simple in concept and complex in execution. Every business - and I do mean every business; be it a factory or a bakery – will have 40% of its gross income taxed by the government. This will be placed in the 'national development and investment fund which is overseen by the development committee – an independent body not controlled by the government but accountable to them - and is to be reinvested into the economy through the distribution of the fund in an impartial and meditated way."

The markets were open. Watching the trading floor was like watching the roll of the tides. Some creature would rush into the room and shout "Sell!" and the wave would carry across as the shouts echoed the demand and the value of the stock went down. When a broker quietly bought stock, every creature who noticed thought they must know some trading secret and bought up stock as well, raising the value.\n\nThis was the way trading worked, by rumour and panic, but Pawly was savvy, and she had a plan. Running straight through the crowd she ran up to the trading window, shoved some papers through and shouted "SELL!" as loud as she could so those around her could hear. She'd just made a profit but there was more to come. Word spread like fire and soon the windows were crammed with brokers selling stock. Most of them didn't even know what she'd sold. As the value of 'Mareland cookies' crashed she ran back to her office and snatched up the phone.\n\nFive minutes later she'd bought up most of the stock that had just been sold at a massively deflated price. Now the tricky part. Walking back to the floor she gave the signal to her partner and the deer, Alv, a known trader of some success, "quietly" bought the last of the stock. Word quickly spread and the windows were once again flooded with attempts to buy back what had just been sold, but it was too late and as they realised their mistake the price of the stock went through the roof.\n\nPawly approached the window with Alv and together they sold their stock at the new inflated price and just like that the Republic gained a new millionaire. Pawly let all pretence drop and celebrated knowing full well that she'd probably lose it all tomorrow, but when you play the markets you've just gotta hold on and try not to get swept away."

That was last week though, this morning the grant had come through and his new machine had arrived.\n\nFinally, the work was fulfilling. No more evenings spent swearing at an engine up to his elbows in oil and spare parts, no more worrying about whether he could get the fields turned over fast enough to get everything planted, no more having to call in help during the harvest and no more spending the repair budget on parts for a tractor that hated him and refused to work, like some lay about unicorn. With the new equipment, he regained all the time he usually lost and had the ploughing done in half the time. She was a beauty of a machine he thought, deciding to name her Rosewater.\n\nAs he drove Rosewater back towards the farmhouse – having finished the lower fields in record time – he saw his wife waving from the porch, a jug of fresh lemonade in her hoof. He smiled, savouring the warm sunset on his face."
trotkart_colthage.24.a: "Nothing like a bit of lemonade after a day of hard work."

trotkart_colthage.25.t: "The Rolling Fields"
trotkart_colthage.25.d: "Gebal sighed. For ten minutes he'd been stuck in the queue to get down to his field, wedged between other tractors all waiting in turn. He could see past the three tractors ahead of him to where a harvester had broken down blocking the road and a group of farmers sucked their teeth and pointed at various bits of the engine without actually repairing any of it.\n\n"Same nonsense, different day," he muttered bitterly. When the state had started collectivising the local farms, they'd talked about providing equipment and boasting efficiency, the problem was the equipment kept breaking down and nobody could be bothered fixing it up right - If it wasn't their problem, why should they – and things just got worse until the machines broke down at awkward moments, like right now.\n\n"Screw it. I'm not losing pay over this." He mumbled as he climbed out of the cab. He had to have those fields farmed by the end of the day or the overseers would dock his wages again and that was not something he could afford. Stomping over to the harvester he shouted, "Have you checked the sparkplugs?" and joined the line of farmers scratching their chins."

trotkart_colthage.26.t: "Shaking Hooves And Making Friends"
trotkart_colthage.26.d: ""So it's a small community bank then Ms Solvik?"\n"I wouldn't say a bank necessarily more of a credit union." The deer replied, shifting nervously in her chair. "But it does provide funding to the local community. We set it up after the war when the big banks were still finding their feet and weren't lending to smaller businesses."\n"Hmm, I see." The banking zebra muttered, looking down at the financial reports in front of him through his thick bifocals. "And tell me, how did this credit union find itself in these financial woes?"\n\n"We invested in a community health centre as the nearest hospital is 30 miles away. We had it all planned out, put down the deposit on the equipment, the builders were ready to start and a few local doctors signed on the payroll when we got the news that the planning permission had been revoked. We're still not sure why that happened one minute we had it the next it was gone. We managed to recoup some of our losses but not enough."\n\n"And how was this health centre going to make a profit?" The banker enquired, setting his glasses on the mahogany desk.\n"It... it wasn't. the plan was to charge creatures at cost value. We wanted to help not make money." She suddenly felt very unsure of herself.\n"It's such a shame." The deer's face dropped hearing the zebra's reply. She knew these bankers were meant to be heartless but even this was a bit much.\n\n"It's... the savings we invested were from the community. Some of our members fought in the war, all they had was in our hooves. You see why we need your help." She quickly added, trying to stave off defeat.\n"All these local projects being shut down by outside interference when they could do some good. Breaks my heart." Her ears perked up. Maybe there was still hope. "It's little community projects just like this that we're looking to help Ms Solvik. You can consider the bailout approved." He smiled as he signed the transfer, the deer across from him beaming with joy and relief. "And good luck with the health centre.""
trotkart_colthage.26.a: "Glad the Sufrit looks out for the small colt!"

trotkart_colthage.27.t: "The Invisible Hoof"
trotkart_colthage.27.d: ""Ah Ms Solvik, just the deer I wanted to see, do come in and take a seat won't you." The zebra smiled warmly as he gestured to the chair on the other side of his desk. The deer returned the smile as she took a seat, feeling hopefully that the meeting would go in her favour. "I've been reviewing your proposal and I think we can help you. Now your community bank got into a little bit of bother, yes?"\n\n"Yes, we invested in a health centre, and it's fallen apart at the last minute because the planning permissions were revoked but with your support, we can get back on our hooves." She shifted a little, trying to get comfortable.\n"Good, good. Yes well, I'm glad to be able to say that we would like to help. You'll see there the agreement of transfer. "He passed her a contract. "We take over the outstanding debt and all the accounts previously held by your little bank and pull you all back from the brink."\n\nAs Ms. Solvik read through the contract her face slowly dropped from hopefully, passing through miserable and landing firmly in distraught. "This... this isn't a bailout contract, it's a buyout contract."\n"Yes, a standard buyout. We'll take over, cut the non-profitable investments and refocus the bank to better use the funds of your community."\n\n"But the whole point of the credit union was to help give the town things they needed, even if they weren't profitable. What about the health centre?" she replied, horrified.\n"First to go, of course, that's already proven to be a bad deal." He said, his smile never wavering.\n"You can't do this. I won't sign this contract!"\n\n"You'll forgive me for saying this Ms Solvik but you don't have a choice. You either accept the buyout or you go under and what will happen to your community then? All those poor creatures who will lose their savings; are you going to put some old war veterans out on the streets for the sake of your pride?" He offered her a pen."

trotkart_colthage.28.d: ""My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemares, please be upstanding for the Sufrit!" The speaker announced as Benoam descended the stairs to the great hall, fashionably late of course. The Gala was well underway with some of the country's leading social figures arrayed throughout the hall. He could spot Jebzel enjoying the champagne along with a few ordinary citizens invited for their outstanding work, and media purposes of course.\n\n"My Lords, Ladies and Gentlemares, please be upstanding for the stallion of the hour, Azizelqart Zahummid!" Benoam smirked as Aziz followed him down the stairway, the room taking his arrival as a signal to stand and stomp their hooves. The economist looked nervous, out of place at the centre of attention but the night was for him, to celebrate the success of his economic model and the "Colthage boom" as it had come to be known. Benoam waited for him, a glass of champagne offered to Aziz as he descended the stairs.\n\n"My friends." Benoam spoke, raising his voice over the crowd. "Please, join me in toasting Aziz and his great success." With glasses raised, and the toast made every eye in the room was back on Benoam again. The night may be in Aziz's honour, but everyone here knew who held the real power and that economist acted only at the Sufrit's discretion. In a way, this was all thanks to him and Benoam would make sure everyone knew about it.\n\n"Are these creatures all here for me?" Aziz asked, a bit shocked as he sipped his champagne.\n\n"Of course, they are my dear Aziz." The Sufrit smiled as he put a hoof across the nervous zebra's shoulders. "After all, you've given them and our nation that greatest of gifts.""

trotkart_colthage.29.t: "Finishing Off What Was Started"
trotkart_colthage.29.d: ""Are you seriously telling me that Ozid is still kicking around in my homeland?" Benoam didn't shout, he didn't let his anger get the best of him, he kept his voice calm, cold and restrained behind clenched teeth. "I assumed that he would have collapsed by now, or that your mercs would have done their job and seized Coltva."\n\nJungle Work glanced sideways at Black Jean. The Sufrit was widely known as not a real general, but he was still in charge, so they had to tread carefully here. "Our priorities lay elsewhere, Sufrit. We thought it best to focus on those we were already at war with rather than Ozid. With Hiram and Zanit dealt with, we could then swing our forces around and deal with him." The simplest arguments are usually the best.\n\n"Well, I am telling you I will not allow that retched communist enclave to last a second longer. I want them wiped off the face of my Republic. I want bombing runs, I want strafing runs, I want artillery fire, I want tank shelling, I want grenades, I want him gone."\n\n"That'll be tricky Sir, we've only got rifles and-"\n\n"Just! Bucking! kill him!""

trotkart_colthage.30.d: ""To place an application for a support grant you need a 25b form which you can't get anymore because they're out of circulation."\n\n"Another dead end. I suggest we scrap this process and build a new streamlined one."\n\n"Agreed." It was a strange sight; Zuan, a young zebra not long out of university – and the newest member of the Young Scientists' clique – chatting with the Sufrit about the tangles of bureaucracy, but who better to discuss it with than someone who just battled through it having come from university and joining politics. A stack of procedures and policies lay piled on the desk, all of them for the bin, a bureaucratic cull was in full swing.\n\nZuan had been sceptical when first asked for his opinion, but Benoam went through paperwork like a blowtorch through butter, clearing up old outdated systems and ridding them of complicated conditions. Granted this opened a few loopholes here and there but it was worth it for the sake of making every zebra's life easier.\n\nFor his part Zuan was happy to help make things simpler for students and activists by cutting the paperwork involved in grants applications and study visas and by the gods was it needed. They'd laughed when they found there were three separate ways of applying for planning rights all of which contradicted each other, but that was just the tip of the iceberg. There were so many old systems still to get rid of. It was going to be a long night."

trotkart_colthage.31.t: "Just Another Cog In The Machine"
trotkart_colthage.31.d: "Another strike of red ink through another question, even Zaalisillhek had to admit that 5 times 7 was too easy. Measuring the competency of any new applicants to the Republican Civil Service required a test, the problem was someone competent had to draft the test. See the issue here? Benoam and Zaal argued continuously over the different versions of the test each had produced with the industrialist claiming Benoam's questions were too hard and the Sulfrit explaining that Zaal's questions were too easy.\n\n"We can't just accept anyone; we need to have at least a basic grasp of the tasks required. An essay-based test would give better insight into the mindset of the applicants and where their possible career path may lead along with any possibly difficult personal leanings. More importantly, though, they need to have the right stuff to be able to survive the service. It's like a bear pit, worse than any battle I fought."\n\n"But you never f-" Zaal was cut off by a death stare from Benoam. "eh... I mean, yes, I see your point. We will need to set up a disputation system though, for those applicants who perhaps feel they were badly marked. Nothing major, just a small setup to sort the tests and deal with the relevant processing costs and extra staff coverage.""
trotkart_colthage.31.a: "A good way to make money if nothing else..."

trotkart_colthage.32.t: "Busting The Fundies"
trotkart_colthage.32.d: ""Thank you for your time, I know you're a very busy stallion these days Sufrit." Benoam recognised the Zebra, he was a patrician, one of the younger ones, not yet fully corrupted by that cesspit.\n\n"Indeed, but not so busy as to make time for a colleague. Do tell me what it is I can help you with." The Sufrit smiled. He was going to enjoy this.\n\n"I was trying to think of ways I can be of service to the Republic since the latest legislation I find myself a little underworked you see. Then I thought the Sufrit would be able to point me in the right direction I mean, you know the state inside and out. I want you to know if there is any way I can help, anyway at all you can think of I'm at your service." And there it was, a young stallion begging for a hoofout. The dismantling of the political dynasties had cost many patricians their family influence and their positions in turn; at least this one knew what side his bread was buttered on, coming as he had to Benoam, cap in hoof.\n\n"I think I know just the department looking for a stallion of your qualities. There's an opening in the fisheries that would suit you." He pulled some papers from a drawer in his desk and signed them. "Take these down to the harbour offices they'll get you sorted out, just don't go forgetting who gave you this chance when you're a big success." He half-joked. The young stallion took the papers eagerly, just happy to have any position at all. He even had the grace, or desperation, to give a little bow as he left the office."
trotkart_colthage.32.a: "Hopefully that'll teach them the meaning of meritocracy..."

trotkart_colthage.33.t: "Let Money Speak"
trotkart_colthage.33.d: "Benoam took a slow puff of his cigar as he regarded Zaalisillhek. The industrialist was after another subtle favour, a job for a useless family member, hardly worth the Sufrit's time but he did enjoy watching them squirm. The Gentlestallion's club was busy tonight, but the members knew a private conversation when they saw it and kept their distance.\n\n"It's not that he's thick, far from it, It's just that he doesn't respond well to written examinations. Oh, thank you." Zaalisillhek greeted the waiter as he lifted a glass of bourbon from the silver tray offered to him. "He's frightfully keen and dedicated oh yes, you'll be hard pressed to find a zebra more dedicated to the ideals of the Order and Progress, as his cousin I can vouch for that."\n\n"Well, if he's as dedicated as you say," Benoam sipped his whiskey, "I'm sure he'd be a great asset to the Republic. The only problem is there would be various administrative overheads that would need to be covered, monthly office costs and such. I cannot make exceptions for these just because he's a friend's relative now can I."\n\n"Oh well, that won't be a problem." Zaal smiled warmly, a slight twitch in his left eyebrow. "He has significant income from a monthly stipend, I'm sure that would more than cover such things. Do you have the details of the account the funds should be sent to?"\n\n"I'll have Azizelqart send you the details.""

trotkart_colthage.34.d: ""I feel this is a bit unnecessary you know. My wife is secretary to the general commissions' council, she holds a lot of influence amongst the right sort of zebra. We're rather known for our little soirées."\n\n"It's just standard procedure Sir." The clerk replied, settling himself across the counter. The senate offices were busy that morning and he had little time to go through the new background checks for lobbyists but the new bill demanded it and you could never be too thorough with security. "Thank you." His assistant passed him the file. "Let me see here now Sir." He extracted the one-page summary from the front, red ink marking up most of the text. "Hmm. You say you worked as an advisor to the Coltva local council?"\n\n"Yes, for three years."\n\n"And the general admissions watchdog in Trotkat for 2 more?" The Zebra opposite nodded firmly and smiled smugly. "I tell you what Sir, you look through this file and stop at any bit of information that's actually true. You see, we did the unthinkable and checked your application. The only truth here is that you worked in a sweetshop when you were 14. Based on this and some rather... unusual financial transactions I think we both know I'll have to reject your application for a lobbyist pass."\n\n"You... I..." The zebra looked like he'd been slapped with a haddock. "How dare you accuse me of lying!" He slammed his hoof on the counter. "You don't know class when you see it otherwise, you'd keep your mouth shut. Do you know who I am?! I have connections. My brother-in-law is very close to the Zurumilki Family!" He grabbed the file off the counter and threw it into the air, papers and pictures flying everywhere. "That's what I think of your silly background checks." By now everyone in the hall was looking to see what the fuss was as he leaned across the counter. "You might want to rethink your decision. I can make things very hard for you."\n\n"Security! Would you please escort this stallion off the premise?" Two large diamond dogs appeared on either side of the trouble maker and dragged him – rather roughly – from the hall whilst he thrashed and ranted."

Licensing costs, administrative fees, security checks, it's all in the paperwork we provided Sir. The final cost is 200 Sir." The clerk slid the bill across the counter to the zebra who read through the itemised bill for his pass.\n\n"I don't see why I should have to pay to offer my services. Here I am, providing my wisdom and insight into the development of mining equipment, taking my time out of my day, volunteering my years of experience and I am expected to pay to be able to help. I'm not doing this for any personal gain, it's for the spirit of the nation." He lied through his teeth.\n\nThe clerk stared at him; lids heavy with boredom. He saw this at least four times a day. Another zebra trying to wiggle their way out of the new fees, fortunately after a few confrontations he'd learned the best way of dealing with such individuals. Slowly he reached across and pulled the bill back to his side of the counter. Without taking his eyes off the zebra before him he reached into his pocket, produced a red pen, and changed the 2 on the bill to a 4 before sliding it back.\n\n"400, Sir."\n\nShocked and grumbling the zebra reached for his wallet before the price got any higher."

What next, they'd be taught to fight for the Republic? They should be focused on learning to read and write, not being morphed into good little patriots.\n\nThere was nothing she could do though; it was a new school policy. Every day had to start with the newly written pledge of allegiance given before the teacher and directed towards the flag. A few teachers had resisted the move and found themselves transferred to other schools or out of a job due to subversive behaviour.\n\nThe Republic was moving in a strange and frightening direction.

These were confirmed following a detailed survey of the local country concerning the landholdings as recorded in local offices.\n\nIt was discovered through these means that you had not declared 60% of your holdings. To clarify the issue and save you any concern about these holdings being considered a monopoly on agriculture in the region – which we're sure you were unaware of – the state shall begin formal confiscation of this land. By the time this letter reaches you the process should have been completed, a great weight off your mind I'm sure.\n\nI hope this letter finds you well\n\nAzizelqart\n\nThe letter slipped from his hoof and landed in the butter."
trotkart_colthage.44.a: "This is outrageous! This is unfair!"

trotkart_colthage.45.t: "Family Matters"
trotkart_colthage.45.d: "The account's report was very clear cut. It detailed every piece of land he owned from here to Trotkat with particular reference to those lands which he held under other names. How they'd found about those he had no idea.\n\n"What does this mean, for me in basic terms." He set spectacles on the table as he turned to his accountant, desperate for good news.\n\n"In basic terms, you've got two choices, either give anyway 40% of your land to smaller holdings or the state is going to come down and take a big wet bite out of your flank with a whopping great tax big enough to make you wish you'd given the land away." She stated, very matter-of-factly.\n\n"How do we do it then? I could give it all to my brother and take a div-"\n\n"Not going to work, they'll see through that. No, there's a procedure for this. Anyone within 4 miles of the land you're giving away can register their interest; their names go into a pot and then the names are chosen by lottery."\n\n"So, these random peasants get my land for free and I-"\n\n"Get to keep your rear intact.""

trotkart_colthage.46.t: "Vote On Merit"
trotkart_colthage.46.d: "She adjusted her tie as she paced back and forth in the waiting room. It was ridiculous, a mare of her standing, secretary to the general commissions' council, forced to take some silly voter competency test. To make matters worse she had to take the test and wait for the results alongside the factory workers. The smell was the worst of it, grease, sweat and manual labour.\n\nThe test itself was easy. What do you think of this issue or that issue, how many sources have you consulted on these matters, educational background? The whole thing was laughable; she'd breezed through it in half an hour while the others struggled and fretted over every answer.\n\nAn official entered through the main door, papers in hoof. One by one she read from the list and handed the results out. The labourer in front of her collected his results and with a nervous hoof read through the paper, a sigh of relief escaping him as he realised, he'd passed and been granted the right to vote.\n\nShe snorted; the test was so easy that even the proles could pass. Collected her results and smugly glanced through them she paid little attention until she read the words: Failed, voting rights denied."
trotkart_colthage.46.a: "This is preposterous!"

trotkart_colthage.47.t: "Money Makes The World Go Round"
trotkart_colthage.47.d: "The counting office was dark, the staff having departed to celebrate the completion of a long day's work. They'd earned it, voter count was up by 20% in the recent elections and they'd been hard pressed to get the counting finished in time but through hard work and diligence they'd managed it.\n\nThe count boxes rested on tables, divided up by the candidate they supported. There was one clear winner with double the number of boxes the second candidate had received, the table groaning under the weight of their popularity. The vast majority of those new voters supported the candidate, clearly their message reached a new younger audience of keen political minds.\n\nAmongst some of the discarded papers, spoiled ballots and other now useless materials scattered in corners or around the floor was a receipt of transfer. A small monetary sum moving between hooves, nothing major, of course, nothing to be concerned about. Perhaps one of those new voters - unfamiliar with voting practices - had accidental slipped it into the ballot box.\n\nThe fact that the name on the transfer receipt was the same as the candidate who'd just won the election was a little strange perhaps but it wasn't worth noting. There were just so many votes to count that the receipt had been discarded without further thought. It wasn't as though it mattered anyway, one vote, when thousands of new voters had supported them.\n\nThe system was worked, it was fair and all the votes legally cast. What more could anyone ask for."

trotkart_colthage.48.d: ""Have you had any weird lectures yet?"\n\n"Yeah, some pegasus came into the psychology lecture shouting about a nightclub and throwing leaflets around. The professor was furious. You?"\n\n"Nah, just trying to stay awake in sociology." The four friends, a zebra, a deer, a kirin and a thestral chuckled as they sat around the table in the café enjoying a cup and each other's company. The group was a welcome sight; The republic had become a melting pot since the wars had brought so many from all over the world to fight, but it was nice to see a group talk about things other than who they'd killed in what battle. The next generation was in safe hooves.\n\nThe Kirin reached down and lifted her tea with her left hoof, blowing gently on it before sipping. The deer across from her looked on in horror. "Something wrong?" She asked the young stag, surprised by his reaction.\n\n"That's how they drink tea in Barasingha. Anyone who drinks tea with their left hoof is an enemy."\n\n"Are you... are you being serious?" The bat asked.\n\n"Nah, I'm just screwing with ya, but you should have seen your face." The deer laughed as the group joined in. "I'm so glad I came to this country. So much potential for pranks.""
trotkart_colthage.48.a: "Marvelous!"

trotkart_colthage.49.t: "The Magic Of University"
trotkart_colthage.49.d: ""How are you finding things?"\n\n"It's much the same as Warzena, though the accent takes some getting used to. I was talking to one of my lecturers yesterday and I thought he was asking me about my last holiday. Turns out he wanted my report on the history of divergent cultures."\n\n"How did that turn out anyway?"\n\n"Well, I just said that Warzena has the best culture. Didn't get many marks." The four zebras sat around the table enjoying a quiet afternoon break from their studies. There was little to say that three of the four weren't from the Republic; only a keen eye would spot the differences in their mannerism and only a keen ear would pick up the difference in their accents. With the region being so uncertain many had taken up the offer of study in Colthage and come from Coltdar, Warzena and Zumidia. A little stability went a long way these days.\n\nWhat they gave in return was new insights into old problems. Though many of the new students had come from just over the border they brought their solutions to the issues that had been plaguing the region for years. The stagnation of the economy, the growing trade deficit, even some of the simple culture points like how to write a collective identity for the region; all from bright young minds ready to get stuck in."

trotkart_colthage.50.t: "Diplomatic Missive - Hippogriffia"
trotkart_colthage.50.d: "To whomever, it may concern,\n\nWe regret to inform you that the diplomatic corps of the Colthaginian Republic has chosen you to act as the chief diplomatic official to the Republic's negotiations with the perfidious Kingdom of Aris, may Za'al help your soul. Contained within this diplomatic missive are the talking points you shall be discussing with Aris' representative, one Violet Facade, make sure to study the talking points thoroughly before proceeding with the negotiations, which shall take place in Zapsa at exactly 18:00.\n\n1. The Hippogriffs, perfidious as they are, will doubtlessly request that Republic's unique relationship with the various criminal syndicates be thoroughly investigated. While the Sufrit sees no inherent issue with temporarily cooperating with the criminal elements of the Republic, the Arisians will doubtlessly push for their agents to be allowed to assist in curtailing said elements, as such, it is your goal to assure the Hippogriff representative that we are fully capable of handling the situation. However, if the Sufrit has chosen to curtail the vast majority of the criminal elements within the country it is advisable to simply let the Arisians have this small diplomatic victory.\n\n2. Minister of Defence Zoblos is a... Rather a controversial figure among certain emigrée circles. She has been accused of several, for the lack of a better term, war crimes by the ever treacherous Harmonites and Coltvans currently eeking out an existence suckling upon the teet of Aris. There are multiple ways to approach this situation - The first and most simple solution is simply denying the allegations, the second, by far more pointless solution is attempting to prove that all sides of the conflict were culpable for the crimes the emigrée community has brought up. There is also the wildcard solution of simply making all of the Republic's wartime records public. Ultimately the Sufrit truly does not care about what the fish think about Zoblos, so simply do whatever you think will give us a more advantageous position during the negotiations.\n\n3. Make sure to triple-read this one. The fact of the matter is that the Sufrit truly does not care if the Arisians see our government as amoral as long as the Republic is capable of reaping economic benefits from this deal. Thus, once you have appropriately wined and dined Miss Violet Facade, you are to bring up the matter of trade ties between our two nations. The Arisians will doubtlessly push back citing their desire to isolate themselves from the rest of North Zebrica. However, what they want does not matter. Push for full-blown free trade between our two nations, but only do so if you are quite sure that the concessions we have already given or intend to give in the following two points will be sufficient enough to sway them. If you are quite sure you will not be able to sway the Arisians to our way of thinking attempt to offer them a more limited trade deal.\n\n4. As you may already know, the Hippogriffs are a school of utterly insufferable fish with delusions of grandeur, as such, they had perceived their intake of Colthaginian refugees as some sort of duty they must uphold. With the Republic stabilised they will now demand that said refugees be taken back. To be quite frank, we have no issues with acquiescing to this demand. However, you are to make it so that Miss Violet Facade is given the impression that we are reluctant to give more weight to any concessions you might have already requested from the Arisians.\n\n5. To put it bluntly, neither the Sufrit nor the Senate cares about Zumidia, but the Hippogriffs don't know that. If need be throw the Zumidians to the sharks to get more benefits out of the Hippogriffs, that is all."
trotkart_colthage.50.a: "Affirmative."

trotkart_colthage.51.t: "The Matter Of The Syndicates"
trotkart_colthage.51.d: ""I can assure you that we have everything under control." The diplomat stated as they poured another cup of tea. The board room had been arranged for this meeting, the long table covered with reports and documents as Violet Facade and the Diplomat sat next to each other. The mediators were wanting in the other rooms in case things got heated, the runners were on standby for anything that might be required, and all angles were covered, excluding the talks themselves.\n\n"Really? Because my intelligence suggests that the cartels have free reign in your nation and in some instances, it looks like they're running the place. How can we begin to have any kind of diplomatic negotiations when these criminals can sabotage anything we agree to?" Violet Facade stated, looking up from the various notes that lay around her.\n\n"Very droll Violet but I think you're overblowing the issue. These "Cartels" as you call them, are nothing more than some gangs and the odd politician with perhaps too much influence. I don't know where your information is coming from, but I assure you it's not accurate." The diplomat reassured an almost pointless attempt but still.\n\n"Uh huh?" She asked eyebrow cocked, not buying the story for a moment. "Aris would like to be sure that these talks are stable and that fruitful. To that end I am authorised to offer you support in removing these blockages from our path, be it information or resources, we do happen to know quite a lot about the goings on in Colthage I assure you. It is to both of our benefits that these talks go as smoothly as possible." She smiled as sipped her tea."
trotkart_colthage.51.a: "Assure the Hippogriffs we have a handle on the situation."
trotkart_colthage.51.b: "How we handle the Syndicates is our own matter."
trotkart_colthage.51.c: "Allow the Hippogriffs to assist us in dealing with the Cartels."

trotkart_colthage.52.t: "The Matter Of Zoblos"
trotkart_colthage.52.d: ""Shall we turn to the question of the military, specifically the conduct of several of your officers during the most recent of your civil wars." Violet flipped through a few pages.\n\n"Could you narrow it down a bit? Quite a few officers were fighting in that war." The diplomat returned, trying to find the relevant information in their notes.\n\n"Jebzel Zoblos. The chief of defence, an interesting choice I might say considering her history."\n\n"It is because of her history that she was granted the position. She did not allow herself to be bound by traditional war tactics and doctrines and used innovative strategies to overcome the enemies of our Republic." A note of pride in the diplomat's voice.\n\n"By which you mean she slaughtered every creature in her path and burned several towns to the ground for not giving in to her demands."\n\n"Those rumours were never proven and the Sufrit would not allow a zebra like that to command the armed forces."\n\n"I have it on good authority. Our concerns are working with a commander of this calibre would make any military collaboration difficult to maintain. The Generals of Hippogriffia won't like working with a murderer." Violet gave the diplomat a pointed look.\n\n"Jebzel Zoblos won't be an issue, here's what we're gonna do.""
trotkart_colthage.52.a: "Assure them that Zoblos' conduct will be "thoroughly" investigated."
trotkart_colthage.52.b: "Flatly deny Zoblos' complicity."
trotkart_colthage.52.c: "Offer the Hippogriffs wartime reports from all sides."

trotkart_colthage.53.t: "The Matter Of Trade"
trotkart_colthage.53.d: ""The Republic has a lot to offer with many high-quality goods and sitting at the centre of the tri-continental shipping lanes it is perfectly placed to provide access to the markets that you're looking for." The diplomat offered a few financial reports to emphasise their point.\n\n"Yes and with a liberal interpretation of the mean on tariffs and embargoes. I can agree that the Republic does sit at the crossroads of trade but your industrial base is somewhat lagging behind our own. If you were to grant access to your ports, I'm sure we could provide some advice and guidance on straightening out your factories." Violet returned with her offer.\n\nThe Diplomat struggled to restrain themselves. Who was this soggy horse to insult the industrial might of the Republic?\n\n"I assure you that the industrial base of the Republic is more than a match for your own. I have it on good authority that our GDP is significantly higher than that of Hippogriffia."\n\n"It would be if your industries weren't run on bribes and underhoof dealings. Kilo for Kilo, we out-produce you, it is only because of the size of the Republic that you outproduce us and realistically you should be making three or four times more than what you are. We don't want any corruption to influence our factories you understand, we've had enough issues there already but access to the shipping lanes and in exchange for some advisors would help sort out your... problems.""
trotkart_colthage.53.a: "Push for a full-blown market cooperation."
trotkart_colthage.53.b: "Make a mental note to send a bribe to Moonfeather."
trotkart_colthage.53.c: "Acquiesce to a vastly limited trade agreement."

trotkart_colthage.54.t: "The Matter Of The Refugees"
trotkart_colthage.54.d: ""Now, onto a difficult subject, the issue of refugees. During the various civil wars which took place within the Republic, a large amount of zebra sought sanctuary within our lands. We had no issue with this but with the current situation, we are now encouraging these zebra to return to their homeland. Most are taking this up freely as I'm sure you're aware but we would like some guarantees that they will be allowed to return unmolested." Violet pressed forward with her list of requirements.\n\n"Well, of course, they are our citizens, we'll welcome them back with a warm embrace." The diplomat replied slightly insulted at the accusation that they would harm their zebra but remaining composed nonetheless.\n\n"Good but there is the issue of hippogriffs going the other way, you see, as the situation develops there are concerns that many of our citizens might seek refuge in the Republic's lands. We want the same guarantees that they will be able to settle in the Republic for the duration of the ongoing crisis and beyond should they choose."\n\nIn truth it wouldn't be much of a problem. The Republic was already a melting pot of different species as the wars had brought mercenaries from all over the world to settle down and bring their families. There was even a small population of hippogriffs within the republic already so it wasn't a big deal but it was still a good bargaining chip."
trotkart_colthage.54.a: "Tell the Hippogriffs that we are ready for them to send every refugee they have."
trotkart_colthage.54.b: "A limited plan for refugee reintegration should be put into place."
trotkart_colthage.54.c: "Reluctantly acquiesce to taking the refugees back."

trotkart_colthage.55.t: "The Matter Of Zumidia"
trotkart_colthage.55.d: ""Finally, we have the subject of Zumidia." Violet Facade turned to the last page of her notes. "This land is of course valuable territory but we're willing to concede that it is within the Republic's sphere of influence as a gesture of goodwill which we hope will be appreciated."\n\n"No no, we could not accept should a generous offer." The diplomat retorted, returning her polite urging. "My government insists that Zumidia be held within the Hippogriffian sphere, to show our respect for your nation."\n\n"While that is kind it is still the offer of Hippogriffia to the Colthaginian Republic and we would be rather disappointed to see it rejected, you see we'd hoped that this concession would be seen as a demonstration of our friendship." Violet responded, a slight tone under her carefully chosen words.\n\n"We have no intention of causing any offence, we simply do not wish to be seen as taking advantage of your generosity." The diplomat replied perhaps a little too forcefully. "We in the Colthaginian Republic believe that openness and trust with our neighbours is the best way forward and as a sign of that trust we insist you accept Zumidia."\n\nThey stared at each other, the mask of diplomacy doing little to hide their attempts to offload the territory to each other."
trotkart_colthage.55.a: "Push for the establishment of a nominal Colthaginian Protectorate after the war."
trotkart_colthage.55.b: "Affirm that Hippogriffia can dispose of Zumidia however they please."
trotkart_colthage.55.c: "Bluntly tell the Hippogriffs we don't care about Zumidia."

trotkart_colthage.56.t: "The Gerza Papers"
trotkart_colthage.56.d: "Following our diplomatic talks the following terms have been received from The Colthaginian Republic for our approval:\n\n1.[TRO.TRO_HIP_term1]\n2.[TRO.TRO_HIP_term2]\n3.[TRO.TRO_HIP_term3]\n4.[TRO.TRO_HIP_term4]\n5.[TRO.TRO_HIP_term5]"
trotkart_colthage.56.a: "We shall accept this proposal."
trotkart_colthage.56.b: "They can't be serious!"

trotkart_colthage.57.t: "Hippogriffia Refuses"
trotkart_colthage.57.d: "The reply has come from the Hippogriffs. They have considered our requests, taking into account the various points we raised and how they would fit into their designs.\n\nClearly they do not understand the gravity of their situation, or perhaps they think themselves better than us, either way, they have decided to reject our terms. Perhaps Violet Facade did not take our position seriously or her nation does not think we have anything to offer. Whatever the case insulted does not begin to describe the mood of the republic but they have made their beds, now they're gonna die in them."
trotkart_colthage.57.a: "Bah, I knew we should have gone with the Chiropterrans..."

trotkart_colthage.58.t: "Hippogriffia Accepts"
trotkart_colthage.58.d: "The reply has come from the Hippogriffs. They have considered our requests, taking into account the various points we raised and how they would fit into their designs.\n\nClearly they have understood the gravity of their situation, and realise that to get through the current crisis they will need our support for they have decided to accept our terms. Violet Facade must have done a fine job convincing her nation and the Republic had a lot to offer them in these difficult times."
trotkart_colthage.58.a: "Splendid! Now to wait for them to beat those dastardly Chiropterrans!"

trotkart_colthage.59.t: "Diplomatic Missive - Chiropterra"
trotkart_colthage.59.d: "To whomever, it may concern,\n\nWe regret to inform you that the diplomatic corps of the Colthaginian Republic has chosen you to act as the chief diplomatic officer concerning the Republic's negotiations with the rogue state of Chiropterra, may Za'al help your soul. Contained within this diplomatic missive are the talking points you shall be discussing with the Chiropterran representative, one Emerald Light, make sure to study the talking points thoroughly before proceeding with the negotiations, which shall take place in Hippone at exactly 18:00.\n\n1. Frankly speaking, the Chiropterrans, insane as they are, make for much better trade partners than the Hippogriffs. As such the first matter you shall be discussing with Lady Commander Light is the matter of Chiropterran arms manufacturers setting up shop within the Republic's borders. This matter can be resolved in whichever way you desire - Although it is advised that you feign pensiveness at the prospect of the deal to give further concessions more weight.\n\n2. The second matter is one of national security. It's no secret that the Chiropterrans possess an astonishing intelligence network with ties so extensive and lucrative we can only begin to speculate upon them. That being said, not every aspect of the Chiropterran Intelligence Community is of equal use. Lady Commander Light, being the leader of the infamous LMRD, will doubtlessly request that her pet organization is allowed to establish black sites within Colthage - Seeing as this would likely contribute to the destabilisation of the Republic were these sites ever discovered it is your duty to attempt to limit Chiropterra's influence within Colthage to an acceptable amount.\n\n3. Surveys of the area have revealed a rather considerable amount of oil and natural gasses underneath the dunes of Zarantia. The Chiropterrans currently do not possess the technical know-how, the resources or the tools to tap into said resources on more than a surface level. Fortunately for them, we do - As such, your goal is to attempt to wrangle the oil fields as compensation for our considerable contributions to the Chirropteran war effort. Whether this deal takes the form of joint ownership or full ownership is irrelevant, even if the Sufrit would vastly prefer that Colthaginian Oil companies have sole ownership of the Zarantia wells.\n\n4. The Chiropterrans, owing to their nature as a rogue state do not have any legal trading partners. However, with the sheer scope of their operations in North Zebrica that is bound to change. Additionally to this, not many nations are willing to trade with Chiropterra, to begin with, and as such the vast majority of their exports are counted as smuggled goods. Fortunately for the bats, the Sufrit has deemed that morality is a matter of personal opinion. Hence, your job is to convince the Chiropterrans to use our ports and ships to export their goods. This will have the natural side-effect of strengthening the Republic's economy... Even if it will drastically increase Chiropterra's revenue. It is important that you do not ask them for any sort of compensation for this act, play into their egotism and allow them to believe that we are a gaggle of dumb savages if need be.\n\n5. Neither the Sufrit nor the Senate cares about anything West of Zapsa. As such, should the matter of Zumidia or the treatment of the Zumidians come up during the negotiations, assure the Lady Commander that we have no intention of condemning any anti-terrorist operations Chiropterra may embark upon. However, if the negotiations have gone poorly up until this point or if the Chiropterran representative is looking pensive you are authorized to offer the Republic's assistance in dealing with any sort of Zumidian resistance against Chiropterra."
trotkart_colthage.59.a: "Affirmative."

trotkart_colthage.60.t: "The Matter Of Weapon Production"
trotkart_colthage.60.d: "The grand hall was lavishly decorated with the banners of both Chiropterra and the Colthaginian Republic lining the corridor and walls. It was important to make a good impression right off the bat and show the Thestrals that their traditions and culture were respected, not just here in Hippone but throughout the Republic. Truth be told it might have been a slight waste of time though as Emerald light seemed a little out of her depth.\n\n"Guns win wars and as our armed forces expand, we need more weapons to outfit them. With supply lines being what they are and the unlikely chance that we might lose territory, we want a secure base from which to produce our weapons. To this end, we'll need to step up workshops within the Republic from which to manufacture and ship guns. The Hippogriffs won't attack the republic's territory and thus we will have guns no matter what. We will of course offer payment for this."\n\nThe diplomat listened somewhat surprised by what they heard. Emerald was asking to rent land to make guns. This was better than they could have hoped. The Republic gets paid for leasing land they weren't using anyway, and the bats would do all the actual work by making the guns themselves. They hadn't even asked for some of the Republic's stockpiled weapons or the use of the existing arms factories. It was a win-win.\n\n"I'm certain we can come to terms about this. The only real point of discussion is our fee.""
trotkart_colthage.60.a: "Agree to allow Chiropterran Weapon manufacturers as long as they pay a premium tax for the first five years."
trotkart_colthage.60.b: "Agree to allow Chiropterran Weapon manufacturers to set up within Colthage with no extra concessions."
trotkart_colthage.60.c: "Agree to allow Chiropterran Weapon manufacturers to set up within Colthage as long as they provide an upfront one-time payment."

trotkart_colthage.61.t: "The Matter Of The Hoof"
trotkart_colthage.61.d: ""Shall we discuss your proposal for joint intelligence operations." The diplomat turned the page.\n\n"Indeed. As you are aware we pride ourselves on our intelligence services and research divisions, leading the way in the development of technology and keeping our citizens safe. The ongoing situation though requires an adjustment in our operations. With our finances somewhat stretched we require the Republics' support going forward. In exchange for allowing our agents to operate within your government's territory and allowing some LMRD labs to be established, we would be willing to share our resources in these areas."\n\nThe diplomat raised an eyebrow. "What do you mean by sharing your resources."\n"Well, we'll share our technology from the labs or help you find any individuals that might be causing you problems."\n\n"Let me get this straight. In exchange for allowing Chiropterran agents in and signing another few land leases you're going to give us tech and round up our dissidents for us?" The diplomat looked incredulously at Emerald who nodded in response. This couldn't be right, the Chiropterrans could not be as naive as this, they had to be building up to some massive request. Best to play along for the moment, it wouldn't do well to let them know we know what's up.\n\n"Again, these seem like very reasonable requests. I can see these talks are going rather well." The diplomat smiled."
trotkart_colthage.61.a: "Offer full cooperation with the LMRD in exchange for any useful research they conduct."
trotkart_colthage.61.b: "Offer assurance that the entire Chiropterran's Intelligence community will be able to set up shop in Colthage."
trotkart_colthage.61.c: "Request that only the Nightmare's Hoof be allowed to set up shop."

trotkart_colthage.62.t: "The Matter Of The Zarantian Oil Wells"
trotkart_colthage.62.d: ""If I might direct the discussions towards the topic of the Zarantian oil fields." Stamping their authority on the talks the diplomat pressed forward with the Republics' demands. "Our surveyors have told us there are substantial deposits under the sand, the only problem is there going to be tricky to get at."\n\n"Indeed. I've had the reports confirmed by our surveyors, unfortunately, we lack the equipment and expertise to get at it and until the situation improves, we're unlikely to get it." Emerald admitted.\n\n"Fortunately, the Republic does have the required expertise, and if our engineers were to operate the rigs you wouldn't have to be concerned about hippogriff attacks on the fields which is a nice bonus." Emerald pondered the idea, weighing up the benefit of access to a safe supply of oil against the downside of... well, there wasn't a downside as far as she could see.\n\n"You'll want a share of the output of course. How much of the oil does your government want?""
trotkart_colthage.62.a: "Offer to buy the Zarantian oil fields off Chiropterra outright."
trotkart_colthage.62.b: "Propose the formation of a joint Zarantian Trade Company."
trotkart_colthage.62.c: "Ask for joint ownership of the oil fields in Zarantia."

trotkart_colthage.63.t: "The Matter Of Chiropterran Trade"
trotkart_colthage.63.d: ""Now the issue is trade." The diplomat set aside their previous notes and collected a small stack of papers from across the table. Taking this brief interruption Emerald turned to one of her diplomatic aids.\n\n"Scarfy, pass me a mango would you please?" An earth pony quickly retrieved a mango from a fruit bowl and passed it to Emerald.\n\n"Very nice those Mangoes aren't they." The diplomat stated, turning to some financial figures. "Locally grown. Part of the Sufrit's policies to expand our trade goods. We can happily include them in the tariff exemptions if you like."\n\n"We're more interested in the black market that operates within your nation. Access to this network would enable us to move supplies and goods to boast our war chest without having to worry about possible blockades or embargoes. The free market isn't very free in a war."\n\n"Ah, I see, you want access to the government-sponsored designated trade zones which incorporate the tariff-free and inspection light policies to speed the shipment of valuable goods to private enterprises throughout the nation."\n\n"yeah, the black market.""
trotkart_colthage.63.a: "Explain that such operations will require compensation."
trotkart_colthage.63.b: "Assure the Chiropterrans they shall have full access to our shipping facilities."

trotkart_colthage.64.d: ""The Zumidian territories, the final item on your agenda. Would you be willing to expand on your government's intentions in this area?" The diplomat enquired. This had to be the moment the Chiropterrans were building to. All the bumbling diplomacy until now had to have been a ruse and now they'd spring some outrageous demands like land concessions or military support.\n\n"Zumidia is Chiropterran territory as we're sure you appreciate. We request that the Republic publicly recognises this territory as Chiropterran lands." As Emerald finished the diplomat waited for her to continue but as the silence began to become awkward the realisation started to take hold.\n"That's it?"\n\n"Yes." Emerald replied, her tone flat and her gaze confident. This couldn't be right, there was no big request, no dramatic revealing of unreasonable demands. It wasn't a ploy; they didn't know what they were doing. This entire discussion had been the thestrals giving the republic what it wanted without even knowing it. Shaking themselves out of the stupor the diplomat refocused on the task at hoof, regardless of how naive the Chiropterrans were being here there was still a job to be done.\n\n"There are a few details I would like to clear up.""
trotkart_colthage.64.a: "We will seek nominal "assurance" that the rights of the Zumidians shall be respected."

They have considered our requests, taking into account the various points we raised and how they would fit into their designs.\n\nAfter what was no doubt a lazy and half-hearted discussion on their end, they have decided to reject our terms. Clearly Emerald Light did not understand the position her nation represented when she came to Hippone and muddled the whole crux of our arguments and offers when she returned to her homeland."

Emerald Light grasped the position of her nation when she came to Hippone and how cooperation with the republic could benefit them during this time. Perhaps we misjudged her when she was here, she must have conveyed the real crux of our arguments and offers to her nation when she returned to her homeland."

trotkart_colthage.68.t: "The New Republic"
trotkart_colthage.68.d: "Benoam adjusted his chair as he took his seat at the table, the advisors arrayed around him. He was in a good mood this morning. Things were going very well throughout the Republic and these morning meetings - which once upon a time consisted of frantic reports of crisis and imminent disasters - had finally morphed into calm briefings about the general state of the country. The civil wars were a long-forgotten thing of the past and he could get on with running the state rather than putting out fires.\n\nTurns out running the republic was quite easy; having built a clean efficient system it practically ran itself from day to day; the only time he ever really had to do anything was to give the odd speech to get a bill passed; being the father of the nation had its benefits and one mention of his favour could sway an argument.\n\nThinking back to the civil war days it was incredible the things they had to do to get through those dark times. Not just him but Jebzel's military... innovations and Aziz's financial creativity might have been desperate and often dangerous but they had been necessary and had pulled the Republic through. They had done what they needed to do to hold the wolves from the door and build the future but that was all behind them now. The new Colthaginian Republic had flourished and under his care, it would continue to bloom into the crowning jewel of Zebrica."
trotkart_colthage.68.a: "Here's to another few decades!"

trotkart_colthage.69.t: "What Goes Around..."
trotkart_colthage.69.d: ""Zemkins, Zemkins!" Zaalisillhek called. Where was that butler? The industrialist shuffled around the dining room mortified at the idea that he might have to make his coffee this morning. It was most unlike Zemkins, normally the old butler was on top of such things, well trained and practised in the daily routine. Pondering the mystery Zaalisillhek trotted through the dining hall and into the drawing room where still Zemkins was nowhere to be found. How strange. Hearing a noise from the main hall he headed through and found a most unusual sight. His butler Zemkins was stood in the main hall with what appeared to be 40-50 federal agents.\n\n"Good morning Sir. You have guests."\n\nTwo hours later Zaalisillhek was in custody and his estate was being turned upside down in the search for evidence. It turns out that the drive by the Sufrit to reduce corruption had not been taken at face value and was being carried through by the local forces. Zaalisillhek's crookedness was well known even as far back as the civil war so building a case and getting an arrest warrant wasn't a challenge. The only problem seemed to be going through his papers. The old industrialist was at least thorough in his record keeping and there was a wealth of knowledge to go process. Surely some of this would point to further financial crimes amongst his associates and help to clean up the nation further."
trotkart_colthage.69.a: "Unhoof me you buffons!"

trotkart_colthage.70.t: "...Comes Around"
trotkart_colthage.70.d: "The knock at the door drew Benoam's attention away from the newspapers every one of which had the same story plastered across its front pages. The arrest of the noted industrialist Zaalisillhek and the ongoing investigation into his affairs. Looking up he found Zuan Khilletzbaal standing in the doorway. Crossing the office, the young politician took a seat opposite the Sufrit.\n\n"You've heard." The young politician stated, looking at the papers.\n"How bad is it?"\n\n"That's actually why I'm here. I have a friend that's working on the investigation. It turns out Zaalisillhek kept quite good records on just about everything and your name appears on quite a lot of them, it doesn't look good Benoam. Personally I... I'm shocked. I know that things were bad during the war and you had to take a few shortcuts here and there but this is intolerable." Zuan paused to let it sink in as Benoam leaned back on his chair, but – finding the silence intolerable – the young politician pressed forward. "They're going to impeach you. There's more than enough evidence and more will come out of the woodwork once this all kicks off, I'm sure Zaalisillhek isn't the only one with records."\n\n"What do you suggest?" Gerza asked, his voice strangely calm as he took in the news.\n"Resign. If you resign, they won't be able to impeach you or charge you with anything you've done during your time in office. You'll keep your reputation and escape prison. At least this way the good that you have done for the Republic won't be tarnished by the bad. It's best for every zebra."\n"Thank you for your advice and honesty Zuan, it's appreciated. I'll need some time to think if you don't mind."\n"Of course Benoam, eh, I mean, Sufrit.""
trotkart_colthage.70.a: "Gerza could almost feel a pang of pride at Khilletzbaal's actions."

trotkart_colthage.71.t: "The Radio Adress"
trotkart_colthage.71.d: ""Citizens of the Republic. I am speaking to you today not as Sufrit, not as a general, but as a humble stallion; from one citizen to another."\n\nBenoam felt a little uncomfortable reading the speech into the radio microphone, he was used to giving public open-air addresses, but this was the best way to reach every corner of the nation at once.\n\n"My message today is bittersweet. The road we have taken to this modern nation has been a long and, in some cases, harsh one. We have all had to make sacrifices and take actions which may be considered questionable but there has been one constant in our lives, one ideal for which we gave our all. Freedom, the freedom to decide our future and raise ourselves out of the mire.\n\nThere are some who have named me the Father of the Republic, but this is unjust. Every one of you is the mother and father of this nation through the blood, sweat and tears you have shed for your country. Who am I to take that from you, to hold such a title over any zebra else? The position of Sufrit should not be held out of reach.\n\nThe Colthaginian Republic has risen from the ashes into a safe and prosperous nation and it is time for me to break the last stranglehold of oppression and return the title of Sufrit to you. That is why, with a heavy heart, I announce my resignation and the foundation of free elections for the vacant position. I have served the Republic as best I can and it is time to step aside.""
trotkart_colthage.71.a: "And such, Gerza told one final great patriotic lie."

trotkart_colthage.72.t: "The Snap Election"
trotkart_colthage.72.d: "Election day came upon Colthage with a sense of quiet excitement. For many, this would be the first time they'd cast a vote and they looked forward to peacefully deciding the course of their future. Pamphlets had been sent to each home instructing any zebra over the age of 16 how to vote and how the first past the post system works; there was expected to be a high turnout.\n\nThis was a landmark moment. The idea of a democratic election had been a long-forgotten dream during the days of the Zarcaid dynasty. The civil wars that followed it further buried the idea that the common zebra would have any real say in their future when the nation was dominated by tyrants and warlords. Benoam Gerza had done it though, he had pulled the country back from the edge of oblivion, rebuilt it to its former glory and passed it back to the citizens. They would choose their own Sufrit and their future from here on out.\n\nEverything was running smoothly. There had been concerns that some zebras might cause trouble or try to disrupt some of the voting stations, but no such problems arose. There were no protests, no demands to return to the old systems or the ideals of the warlords, all dissent was expressed smoothly and democratically.\n\nIn the end though there can only be one winner and the new Sufrit of Colthage was:"
trotkart_colthage.72.a: "Zuan Khilletzbaal!"
trotkart_colthage.72.b: "Azizelqart Zahummid!"
trotkart_colthage.72.c: "Shama Zurumiki!"

trotkart_colthage.73.t: "Home Away From Home"
trotkart_colthage.73.d: "The chirping of crickets outside faded into the din as Benoam made his way to the casino floor. Groups of creatures from all over the world wandered around gambling, drinking, and eating, making the most of the holiday destination that was the Meridiennes to enjoy themselves and relax. Benoam had much the same intentions, enjoying the first few weeks of his long retirement to come he'd spent the day strolling through the town, taking in the countryside, and now savouring some of the local evening entertainment. Retirement was treating him well so far, but it was perhaps a little too relaxing.\n\nSettling himself down at a poker table he ordered a drink and took in his fellow gamblers. An old doe to his left, two griffons on a hen party, a zebr- wait. Is that Zarishat?! Sure enough, sat opposite him with a stack of chips and a smug grin sat Zarishat, his predecessor, former head of the Republic and present exile.\n\n"Sufrit." She greeted him.\n\n"Sufrit." He replied as the dealer slid his cards across the table to him."
trotkart_colthage.73.a: "Seriously!?"

trotkart_colthage.74.t: "Two Of A Kind"
trotkart_colthage.74.d: ""You know, your lapdog was a real pain for me to deal with. Killed a lot of good mercenaries during the civil war."\n\n"Oh please, you should know better than anyone that she gave up on me after I made my getaway."\n\nGerza and Zarishat both lounged back in their chairs, staring into the sunset on the white sandy beaches of Les Meridiennes.\n\nGerza turned over to Zarishat, "Well, yes, I know that, but she worked for you before. And you gave her command. So I still blame you. Could you pass the Macawian port?"\n\nZarishat reached over and handed the former Sufrit the bottle of wine. "If you think I made a mess of the place, you couldn't even run the circus that you set up. Ousted by a nerd with glasses bigger than he is tall."\n\nGerza laughed from his stomach, "Well, I still got a good pension out of the deal. You had to rob the entire country. All the money that's mine I at least made. Just don't ask how." Gerza winked while Zarishat snickered.\n\n"Well, I wouldn't have needed to rob the country if my donkey of a brother didn't go into that meeting with those allies of yours."\n\n"Are you telling me you regret me helping to kill your brother? They viewed all of us Coltvans as the same. I just had to show them I was a cut above the rest. Same thing I did with that fatty Ozid."\n\n"Oh no, no regrets here. Zesh got what was coming to him, and that whole nation got it too. I'm quite happy with my Casino and resort here, all that gold did wonder for my health, and my fur." The two shared another laugh.\n\n"Oh yes, I'm sure Colthage would be happy for you if they could see the 'Golden Bit Casino' or whatever you called it. Only took a famine and a half to get here."\n\n"Hey, at least I wasn't a crook.""
trotkart_colthage.74.a: "Somewhere out in the jungles of Coltva, a revolutionary just turned in an unmarked grave."

trotkart_colthage.75.t: "One Sufrit Above All"
trotkart_colthage.75.d: "Benoam reclined in his chair taking a moment to enjoy the peace of his office with a long slow drag of his cigar. Tapping the ash out on the ashtray next to him he exhaled and smiled to himself. This was how his morning went now; with the country running smoothly at long last he got plenty of time to do whatever he wanted, aside from the odd economic or military report.\n\nHe had come a very long way indeed, from Coltvan hick to Father of the Republic. Looking back on those early days when his family was discounted and dishonoured, looked down on by those in Colthage as some backwater yokel, the general who'd never won a battle. Look at him now; he'd won the war and rebuilt the entire country in his image and all those who'd looked down on him had been cowed, crawling on their knees for a chance of his favour.\n\nLooking at the photo of his father on the desk he sighed contentedly.\n\n"They said we weren't worth their time. Now they say nothing.""
trotkart_colthage.75.a: "A yokel no longer..."

trotkart_colthage.76.t: "An Old Friend"
trotkart_colthage.76.d: ""You run a tight ship here."\n\n"It helps when every zebra is terrified of you." Jebzel chuckled as she strolled at Benoam's side. The army base was on its best behaviour as always, Jebzel saw to that and no zebra would dare step out of line with her around, even if she hadn't been head of the armed forces rumours persisted about her... methods.\n\n"Terrified, I can't imagine why." Benoam laughed as they crossed the parade ground. "You're such a gentle mare deep down inside."\n\n"Oh?" She raised an eyebrow with a smirk. "Just like how you're a stallion who cares for the humble zebra of the land, your Coltva roots coming through maybe?"\n\n"You know only you get to make jokes like that." He smiled at her giving her a side-eye.\n\n"Of course, gotta take every opportunity I can, after all, I never know when you'll take my position away." She laughed.\n\n"Oh yeah. Tomorrow if you're lucky, I'll sign all the paperwork tonight, I'll blame all those atrocities, sorry I mean moments of tactical creativity."\n\n"Ha, and when I launch my coup, I'll blame all that money you stole, sorry I mean creatively invested."\n\n"What a pair we make, come on, let's get a drink.""
trotkart_colthage.76.a: "With a friend like this..."

trotkart_colthage.77.t: "The Levers Of Economics"
trotkart_colthage.77.d: ""As you can see it all balances out quite nicely, we could even have a surplus if we wanted but that makes no sense economically of course." Aziz set aside the papers into a small pile and continued to munch his sandwich.\n\n"It's nice to know the option is there." Benoam sipped on his milkshake. The café was quiet and they had nothing to hide, why would they; the Father of the Republic and the honourable treasurer were merely commenting on how well everything was going, and he was hungry. "It would be a shame" Benoam continued "for a surplus to go to waste. It should be properly invested into the correct causes."\n\n"Usual routes I suppose?" Aziz said around a mouthful of a sandwich as he made some notes.\n\n"Certainly. You know, there was a time when I'd have to twist your arm to get this done."\n\n"Things are different now." Aziz shrugged. "Like it or hate it your policies work. The economy is stronger and more predictable now than it has been in years because of the balance you've struck. Greasing a few hooves has greased the wheels of industry. If a few bits go missing here or there, what does it matter because clearly, it's working so let's make it happen." He finished, brushing some crumbs off the treasury papers."
trotkart_colthage.77.a: "Pleasure doing business with you."

trotkart_colthage.78.t: "In The Halls Of Power"
trotkart_colthage.78.d: "The meeting was informal; two senators and a colonel enjoying their drinks with the afternoon sun bathing Benoam's drawing room in pleasant warmth. He'd invited them to his manor – a rare privilege – to discuss a few small points of government business.\n\n"The position of secretary of defence needs to be carefully considered. The zebra who holds it needs to be able to work in tandem with the military and needs a good relationship with the chiefs of staff. That requires trust and respect, otherwise, the army, navy and air force will simply ignore your requests or actively frustrate you." The colonel insisted.\n\n"I can see the reasoning there and I'm all for cooperation. It just so happens that a post of junior secretary to the department is about to open; a bit of a cushy job with good pay but decent for a recent graduate, like your niece, say." The senator offered with a smile. Growing bored of the negotiations dancing round in circle Benoam spoke up.\n\n"Give her niece the job and in return, the colonel will tell the Generals you're the right zebra for secretary of defence." Benoam turned towards them, mild annoyance written across his as he brought the negotiations to an abrupt end. "Any further points?"\n\nNozebra said anything."
trotkart_colthage.78.a: "It's good to be the boss."

trotkart_colthage.79.t: "Retirement Plans"
trotkart_colthage.79.d: "The halls of Benoam's home were impressive; grand but modern, spacious, and airy, but there were times when it did feel a little too large, too empty and in truth, there were times when he felt a little lonely. The country was now running well, every crisis had passed, and life was easy; it would be the perfect time to settle down and start a family.\n\nHe had it all now, Father of the Republic, rich beyond measure, and trusted friends. The only things missing were a special some zebra and an heir. It was a nice thought, one he would most definitely have to follow up on, there were a few senators he had considered courting but had been too busy at the time, but as things were quiet now would be perfect.\n\nFor the moment though he'd just have to take somezebra under his wing, a young politician just starting maybe, someone he could show the ropes. That would certainly liven up his days a bit, having a protégé around would give him something to focus on and act as a nice excuse to revisit the glory days.\n\nThe country was his, the future was his."
trotkart_colthage.79.a: "The Gerza Era has only just started."

trotkart_colthage.80.t: "The Pauper's Crown"
trotkart_colthage.80.d: "Well, that's that then, there was nothing more Benoam could do but sit in the dark and wallow in his misery. He had climbed to the top of the ladder only to burn it down under him. The Republic was now so thoroughly corrupt he could no longer maintain his grip on power. Money was the new Sufrit and there were zebras with a lot more of it than him.\n\nHe had gotten it wrong. His ambition had far outstripped his ability and whilst trying to get as rich as possible he'd gone past the point of no return. He'd given away too much power and control in favour of cash and profit and now all the worst elements of the Republic were effectively running the place whilst he sat waiting for the end to come. It's only a matter of time now before the whole country collapses in on itself or another civil war arises to finish off what's left of his dream.\n\nReaching for the bottle, Benoam poured himself another glass of whiskey and planned how best to flee with as much money as possible."
trotkart_colthage.80.a: "Just one more drink."

trotkart_colthage.81.t: "The Deplorables"
trotkart_colthage.81.d: "The party was in full swing. Industrialists, market capitalists, traders, and bankers from all over the nation came together to celebrate and unwind in whatever way they saw fit; after all, money ruled the Republic now and they had all the money.\n\nThe corruption that had spread throughout the country had become such an ingrained part of the system that they no longer had to pretend to stay in line. The chief federal investigator was in the corner of the room snorting drugs off a stallion's back and this could be considered relatively restrained given some of the other activities going on in the hall.\n\nThis was the new norm, these zebra could do whatever they wished without repercussion. They could trot down the street and shoot some zebra and no one would bat an eye, not even under the Zarcaids had things been this bad, at least they'd been able to keep the illusion of order. The Lunatics have taken over the asylum and were running it into the ground."
trotkart_colthage.81.a: "Like jackals, they feasted on Colthage's corpse."

trotkart_colthage.82.t: "One Last Ploy"
trotkart_colthage.82.d: "This was intolerable.\n\nEvery document that Aziz looked through just brought more despair and frustration to the poor Zebra's mind in the early hours of the morning, the light flickering threatening another power cut in the city. Things had already gone from bad to worse and were heading decidedly in the direction of catastrophic; even the power companies couldn't function correctly due to disappearing coal and oil shipments and things were on the verge of total collapse.\n\nWhen Benoam had come along Aziz was sceptical of his ideas, but he had to admit that with such a force of personality and the flexibility that Benoam seemed to possess he might have been able to pull it off. Oh boy, was he wrong. Everything had gone to pot and the ship of state was now leaking from the top down, the hull rotting out from under their hooves. The entire country was about to fall into the abyss and there was only one last desperate option left.\n\nPicking up the phone Aziz began to dial up the one group who might be able to stop this from going any further.\n\nThe Zarcaids."

trot_drugs_prologue.1.desc: "The gentle tap of a teaspoon on the crystal glass attracted the attention of all within the ballroom. Every zebra who was any zebra was there to celebrate the end of the latest civil war, after a best of three, Gerza had finally come out on top and now the future was his for the taking.\n\n"My friends, thank you for joining me here today. It's been a long and difficult road, but our nation is once again whole. The revolving door of power struggles and dictators has come to an end, once and for all. Through your efforts, we have seized the future from the jaws of doom, but we still have a long way to go. With dedicated efforts and innovative policies, we'll rebuild our economy and fix the mistakes of the past. With discipline and loyalty to our new nation, our armed forces will become the elite team they should be. Together we shall build a stronger Colthage for all of us. Thank you."\n\nA round of hoof stamping filled the room accompanied by a few whoops and shouts from some of the Generals. Mad Mic and others were already in the middle of a few glasses of champagne. Mingling through the crowd, Benoam found himself between Jebzel and Aziz.\n\n"Enjoying yourself Sufrit? It's nice to finally be able to relax, no?" Jezbel said with a relaxed smile. Aziz stood awkwardly, looking uncomfortable in the crowd.\n\n"It is," Benoam nodded, "Finally we can put things in order as they should be. Though, I get the feeling that it'll all be uphill from here."\n\nAcross the country, in hidden basements and warehouses, bombed-out ruins and abandoned villages, the country was being divided up by the cartels. For them, this was no time to celebrate. For them, the war wasn't over. This was merely a hiatus, and the real fight for control of the Colthaginian Republic was about to begin."

War's over Zerm, and those lines we made dividing up the territories, they kept things balanced during difficult times but now, it's a free market. You gotta take the chances in front of you, ya see?" Shama said between mouthfuls. She'd invited Zermelqart down to her restaurant to discuss their partnership and the current state of the cartels.\n\n"And what about the others, have you told them? What is Zicardo going to do when you start creeping into this territory?" Zermelqart asked, trying to play the diplomat.\n\n"We got no issues with the Tiger, we sell them oil for their workshops. Anyways, he's too busy dealing with Abizaal. Nah, it's Zisco I'm after, that mad monk's been too smug for too long." Shama thumped her hoof on the table rattling the cutlery. She adjusted her suit a little, composing herself.\n\n"What about Benoam?" He asked, "Surely the Sufrit wouldn't like the Cartels running loose."\n\n"As long as he stays out of the way when the bullets start flying, he'll have no problems. He's smart, I'm sure we can cut some sort of deal. He's not gonna do anything, trust me."\n\n"And where do I fit into all this?" He set his cap on the table and smoothed his mane, aware of the switchblade in his hoof holster.\n\n"Zermy, we all know you're on the level. You're neutral, just stay that way. If Zisco comes to you looking for something, do business, yeah? Just make sure you tell him nothing about the Family, you understand? Things are gonna get bloody real quick and I like you.

trot_drugs_prologue.3.desc: "The reports started as a trickle that barely bothered any zebra, the odd break-in here, a mugging there, street crime that's easy to overlook in the aftermath of a war. There were bigger things to worry about and it would all settle down in time. Then a building blew up. It was reported as unexploded munitions that had been dislodged during repair works but the reality made Benoam sit up and take notice.\n\nDividing up territory sounds like a good idea; it sounds like a way to set boundaries and avoid disputes. The problem is that by setting a border you give something to fight over. The cartels had carved up the country between themselves but that was never going to be enough to satisfy them and already they were pushing back. In the last two weeks, the Zaga Brotherhood had released a bunch of documents proving that the Zurumilki Family's ownership of a pipeline was fraudulent, and the deeds forged. In return, the Zurumilki had used their influence to have a Zaga-owned brothel shutdown, burned to the ground and the owner fitted for concrete horseshoes.\n\nOn the opposite side of the country, the Tiger Syndicate had become involved in a near constant running battle with the Abizaal Syndicate. One might think that gunrunners and drug dealers would be natural allies but apparently not. Three Abizaal depots had been robbed in the last 10 days using guns sold by the Tiger thugs and the Tiger's workers kept getting hooked on Abizaal-supplied drugs.\n\nIn the middle of it all the Zapsa were running anything and everything under the radar at under market prices damaging the economy; bribing, corrupting or in some case killing the border guards and customs agents who were supposed to keep the country secure.\n\nThe dream of peacefully rebuilding the nation is going up in smoke and unless something is done soon things are going to get out of hoof very quickly."

Every morning the sun would rise, every evening the sun would set and at noon a new shipment of guns from the Tiger syndicate would arrive in the hooves of our zebras. Of all the cartels the Syndicate was the one most well-known amongst our soldiers with each gun stamped with the tiger's head. These weapons were often of superior quality to our productions with reports of soldiers trading their rations for the rifles.\n\nNow that the war is over, we face a difficult decision, the arms that they could continue to provide would give a real boost to the Republic's continued military development but a bunch of gun runners shipping weapons around the country would do little to help our stability and make our citizens feel safe."

trot_drugs.2.desc: "The Zaga Brotherhood is perhaps the strangest of the cartels. Using religious imagery and functions they can move throughout the country and gather information, whether it be through heartfelt confessions or drug-induced revelations. The Zaga's network of informants, infiltrators and dealers make them the finest source of information in the Republic.\n\nThis supply of ready knowledge is a double-edged sword.

When the front lines were deadlocked it was the Zapsa that got the supplies to the soldiers where they were needed. These zebra know every avenue, every farmer's trail and every cove from here to Saddle Arabia. There are even rumours of a network of tunnels stretching for miles across several borders.\n\nThe freedom this network could give us, being able to get around the trade tariffs, smuggle agents into our enemies' homelands, the skies – or rather the tunnels – are the limit. The problem though is we can never be sure what is coming the other way. With such a vast transport network it's impossible to keep tabs on who or what is crossing into our borders."

trot_drugs.4.desc: "Oil drives the engines of war. From greasing guns to the axels of transport trucks it is simply not possible to fight a modern conflict without access to oil and when peace does finally come to a nation that oil drives the engines of industry and fuels our homes. The Zurumilki family controls that flow of oil and through it, they have their hooves in most of the industrial base of the Republic. They are oil zebra, they feel that oil is a family business, and that is where it should stay, in their family.\n\nBy striving for friendly terms with them we'd be sure to get favourable rates on the oil and priority shipments but can we rely on the whims of one family when our entire industrial economy could be shut down by a family squabble."

These chemists and their creations saved the lives of many of our zebra during the war; it didn't matter where they were getting these drugs from.\n\nIn peace time we have started to hear rumours we perhaps did not wish to. Stories of kidnapped researchers, bombed labs and zebra experimentation have begun to filter through and are causing concern. We indeed stand to gain a lot from a friendship with the Abizaal driving our scientific development, but can we stand by and watch these vile experiments our zebra are being subjected to?

trot_drugs.6.desc: "The gunshot rang out, startling the birds in the nearby trees. Benoam grumbled under his breath; a little too far left, a little too low, the bullet hole in the target annoyingly off centre.\n\n"Try again." Zicardo growled at this shoulder, the natural harshness of his voice adding an edge to the otherwise supportive words. "Remember, breath out slowly when you fire and squeeze the trigger gently like it's a mare. You're jerking it, throwing your aim off." The zebra passed Benoam another bullet. Taking a breath, he reloaded the single-shot rifle and aimed. Exhaling he slowly squeezed the trigger, the gunshot ringing in his ears and the smoking bullet hole resting nicely between the mannequin's eyes. With a satisfied smirk, he climbed back to his hoofs.\n\n"Not a bad shot, if I do say so myself. You know, when you invited me to your private firing range, this wasn't quite what I expected." Benoam gestured around him to what appeared to be more of a warzone than firing range. Bullet casings lay scattered glinting in the grass, small craters marked the area and he could swear some of those bones were real.\n\n"Too untidy for you Sufrit?" Zicardo joked roughly. "I brought you here for business, not to comment on the sodding scenery." He stubbed out his cigar under his hoof. "Benoam, we've been pals now for a while. Don't you think it's time we worked together properly, all formal like? With paperwork and... badges, the type of thing you politicians love so much."\n\n"You assume I need you for anything. I have all the muscle I need."\n\n"I'm not talking about muscle; I'm talking about guns. Licensed and legal, all nice and shiny. Make it official, special advisors or whatever you wanna call it, and I'll make sure you get your cut. 70/30. Sound fair?""
trot_drugs.6.a: "Let's give it a shot."

trot_drugs.7.t: "Trust Between liars"
trot_drugs.7.desc: "The slow chime of bells echoed through the cloisters as the monks headed for their evening prayers; ostensibly at least. What they were doing was heading to share the latest batch of stolen secrets amongst themselves and sample their evening hallucinogens, just to add a little colour to the sunset. Benoam passed these shuffling groups as he made his way to Father Zisco's office. The well-lit and well-kept room smelled faintly of incense as Benoam entered, not bothering to knock.\n\n"Good evening Zisco."\n\n"Sufrit." The monk greeted him warmly, raising from his chair to shake his hoof. "Come in, come in, please do take a seat. I have so looked forward to this meeting." Benoam had not told Zisco he was coming, but of course, the monk knew about it anyway, it was his job to know.\n\n"You know why I'm here so let's just get down to it shall we?" He said, taking a seat.\n\n"Certainly. While the post of communications advisor to the Sufrit has been empty for some time and would most certainly be well filled by my good self you want some form of guarantee." A statement of fact, not a question. Strolling over to a cabinet Zisco produced a small key on a cord around his neck and unlocked the door, pulling a large stack of papers and files from within. He dropped them onto the table before Benoam with a thump. Curious, Benoam flipped open the first file and found a picture of himself looking up at him.\n\n"This is everything we have on you, well, every piece of proof at least, we can't account for what some zebra's got stored in their heads of course. It's yours to do with what you will and in return I hope to receive the official appointment papers delivered tomorrow morning.""
trot_drugs.7.a: "Our alliance need not be a secret."

trot_drugs.8.t: "The Honourable Thieves"
trot_drugs.8.desc: "The bar was small but cosy with an old-world feel to it, the type of place one might bring their grandmother for a Sunday lunch. It was here that Benoam found Zermelqart waiting for him, a small half-eaten salad resting before him.\n\n"Benoam, good to see you. Drink?"\n\n"Just water, thank you." The Sufrit replied settling himself down opposite Zermelqart. He had been genuinely looking forward to this meeting and found the zebra's company enjoyable. He was unique within the criminal circles of Colthage, a kind-hearted thief.\n"To what do I owe this pleasure? Need some more Chitali wine for the cellar?" the smuggler joked.\n\n"Not quite. Zermelqart, we've been friends now for a while and I know the efforts you put into keeping your network as clean as possible. Minus a few border skirmishes you don't threaten, murder, burndown homes or businesses, it's admirable, it is."\n"Benoam, I'm blushing. You don't have to flirt with me to get into my bed, I won't tell Jebzel." He joked with a wink.\n"We both know that's not gonna happen. No, Zermelqart, I mean the way you run your organisation should be used as an example to others. Criminal though it may be it's clean and organised, crime as a service; though perhaps not criminal for much longer." Zermelqart raised an eyebrow. "I'd like to offer you a role in government, official minister for import and exports."\n\n"That's... a rather tempting offer. I do like the thrill of flying under the radar but maybe it is time to settle down. I think I've earned a little bit of the quiet life." He relaxed back in his chair.\n\n"And you'll serve as a fine example to others. Bend the rules, don't break them and the rewards are there, what do you say?" Benoam produced a cigar and offered it to the Zermelqart."
trot_drugs.8.a: "Crime need not be criminal."

trot_drugs.9.t: "A Friend Of The Family"
trot_drugs.9.desc: ""Sit down, sit down there Sufrit." Shama pulled the chair out for him. The restaurant was busy for an early afternoon but a private table allowed them to talk frankly. Gerbaal, go tell Urumilk to make the risotto, my grandfather's recipe, you're going to love it., Gerbaal!", she banged on the table, "bring the wine, the good bottles, not that stuff you gave the mayor." Shama settled into her chair next to Benoam and a strangely heavily scarred waiter set two wine glasses on the table and poured from the bottle.\n\n"Thank you for the hospitality Shama, though I did come here for a conversation, not lunch."\n"We eat while we do business. You learn a lot about some zebra over lunch."\n"Surely we're past that now, we've been doing business for a while."\n\n"Exactly, you're basically family and family gets fed." Gerbaal returned with two steaming plates of risotto and set them before Shama and Benoam. "Eat, eat." She instructed as she dug into her meal. "The secret is we pick our wild mushrooms from outside the city. Takes 15 zebra 5 hours every weekend, but it's worth it, you can taste them, right?"\n"Yeah, I do actually." Benoam commented, a little unnerved by the interaction. Leaning back on her chair Shama continued.\n\n"Let me tell you why I think you're here. You're here because you want me to help you out. We've been in business for a while like I said and now you want to make it official, bring the family into the fold, well I tell you what I'm gonna do. Because we're such good friends, I'm gonna allow it, the Republic can have the services of the Zurukilki family, for a small fee."\n\n"Of course. I was going to offer you the position of minister for infrastructure."\n"Make it industry and you get a deal.""
trot_drugs.9.a: "Oiling the diplomatic wheels."

trot_drugs.10.t: "A Genius And A Monster"
trot_drugs.10.desc: ""And finally, here we have the PK results of the latest trial. The pharmacokinetic data is promising, 42 per cent diffusion into the bloodstream with a 34 per cent cellular uptake."\n"And how many of the test group survived?"\n"None, but that's the next hurdle to get over."\n\nBenoam sighed and shook his head. The lab was impressive true, a large network of underground tunnels and bunkers more modern than anything the state could call on, but the built-in furnaces for disposing of what was euphemistically called "testing material" were a real worry. The scientific advances that Zuan and his team had made were driving development throughout the Republic like nothing else, but the cost wasn't worth it.\n"Zuan I... how can I put this; I appreciate what you're doing here but it all seems a bit unsavoury. The zebra that are here, they have to know the chances of coming out alive are slim."\n"They sign all the appropriate forms and disclosures, and we only use Zebra who have no use elsewhere, drug addicts, debtors, the homeless and such."\n"Hmmm." Benoam grumbled, not convinced. "I'm still not happy about it."\n\n"You don't have to be. As long as the state funding starts coming in you can look the other way and pretend you've seen nothing, you know like you always do. In return the Republic will get all the patents we produce, lifesaving medication and medical knowledge, you name it. Some Zebra always has to die for progress, we're just speeding up the process."\n\nBenoam hated Zuan but there was little he could do. He needed the assets the chemist produced so he had no choice but to tolerate his activities.\n"You've... you've got a deal.""
trot_drugs.10.a: "It is deplorable, but inevitable."

trot_drugs.11.t: "Tiger Hunting"
trot_drugs.11.desc: "It was never going to be easy; the Tiger Syndicate were too well equipped and violent to go quietly. A dawn raid on their warehouse would reduce the casualties but still, some zebras were going to die during the firefight. The plan was simple in theory, kill Zicardo and the rest of the syndicate would collapse into infighting and destroy itself; it was only his ferocity that was holding the outfit together, but first, they had to get to him.\n\nThe explosion that blew open the doors alerted the guards and – as zebra who enjoyed violence and were well trained for it – they reacted quickly and the Battle of Colthage wharf began. The government forces had the building surrounded, there was nowhere for the Cartel to go, they'd fight tooth and hoof for every square inch. There was no grand strategy here, no cunning twists of tactical genius, just several hundred instances of vicious hoof-to-hoof combat as the bullets whistled overhead.\n\nFor several hours the battle raged, room by room, inch by inch. Once a relief force had tried to punch through the Republic's lines but had been driven back by rooftop rifles. The wounded were many as the fighting reached its peak, the sound of thumping explosions from deep within the warehouse until finally, the gunfire stopped.\n\nSifting through the wreckage would be a daunting task, there were many to bury, many wounded but the Battle of Colthage wharf spelt the end of the Tiger Syndicate, Zicardo's body riddled with bullets; he had fought till the very end."
trot_drugs.11.a: "One less psychopath to deal with."

trot_drugs.12.t: "Dissolution Of The Monasteries"
trot_drugs.12.desc: "The raid on the monastery was going surprisingly well. They had encountered little resistance as they made their way through the complex with most of the monks being out of their minds on a concoction of various drugs. What sober monks they had found seemed to give up very quickly, lacking the means or will to fight back and appearing to be in a slight state of shock. They simply couldn't believe that they'd been taken by surprise: the Zaga Brotherhood had not known the raid was coming. How was that even possible?\n\nFinally they managed to find Zisco's office in an obscure corner of the complex; they'd expected to find the monk scrabbling around to burn documents and destroy evidence but instead, the office was tidy and well organised. Several small stacks of documents sat on the desk with little notes on the contents of the stacks set on top. None of the drawers was locked, the safe lay open and searching it they found a detailed list of the contents. it was as though it had been set up to help them find what they wanted. One thing stood out above all others, a thin layer of dust lay across everything in the office. Zisco hadn't been here for weeks.\n\nA few days later Benoam received a blank postcard from Les Meridiennes."
trot_drugs.12.a: "At least he's gone."

trot_drugs.13.t: "Good Intentions Pave the Road to Tartarus"
trot_drugs.13.desc: ""No, he's a good guy. He should just get fined, not prison."\n"Ok, and this one?" The inspector placed a photo of a middle-aged zebra before Zermelqart.\n\n"Yeah, he's been involved in some skirmishes with the border guards. Prison for him but a short sentence." The process was long and thorough, but it was progressing well. Benoam sat in the corner of the interrogation room, watching the scene playout; there was something honourable about Zermelqart's conduct. He protected the members of the Syndicate who had done nothing more than ordinary smuggling and handed over info on any creature who'd been involved in violence.\n"Do you think you're betraying your zebra? Talking to the authorities like this?" The Sufrit asked, interrupting the interrogation.\n\nThe old smuggler replied with a tired smile. "I know about the plans to strengthen the borders, give new powers to inspect shipments, increase coastguard, you're going to shut us down and there's little we can do to stop it. I'm not a violent stallion and I have no desire to put any lives at risk. By coming forward now I can get fair terms. Staying silent would protect nothing but my pride and it's not worth the lives of my – or your - zebra."\n\n"And what do you think we should do with you?" The inspector asked with genuine curiosity, setting the remaining photos to the side for a moment. Zermelqart paused and took a drink from his coffee as he mulled the question.\n"If I were you," he began slowly, "I would make an example of me, life imprisonment and stripped of assets."\n"And... you'd be ok with that? Dying in prison whilst the rest get off light?"\n\n"Such is life." He sighed."
trot_drugs.13.a: "We can't make any exceptions."

trot_drugs.14.t: "Do You Have A Booking?"
trot_drugs.14.desc: ""Say hello to my little friend!" The doors to the office exploded. They'd been told that lunchtime would be the best time to go in. They'd been told that the restaurant would be busy with customers. They'd been told the Shama would be there with the kitchen and waiting staff only. The informant had been correct, all that was true and yet none of it stopped the simple arrest from descending into utter chaos. It turns out the waiting staff had all carried guns and after the police had tried to deliver the arrest warrant things went from tense to violent very quickly. With just enough time to call in backup the restaurant emptied like water through a sieve, as the tables flipped to become cover and the staff went to take their order and their lives.\n\nOnce that had been dealt with, they had tried to move through the kitchen but they found the chefs waiting for them. What followed could be described as a knife fight in a phone booth with blood, cooking fat and cutlery flying in all directions, the chefs demonstrating their knife skills to great effect while the officers did all they could to not end up on the menu. When the final bill was tallied and the chefs disposed of, the police had made their way to Shama's office and that was when the doors had exploded.\n\n"You think you can come into my restaurant you cockroaches! Into my business! You have no respect!" Through the smoke and dust, Shama emerged carrying a heavy assault. Without hesitation, she advanced on the police firing wildly in her rage. "No respect for me, for my business, for my family!" She stamped down on the head of one of the officers who'd been stunned by the explosion. "I am Shama Zurumilki! I own Sophoovene! You're nothing! You're insects! You'r-" she roared as she was cut down by a hail of bullets, and with her fell the Zurumilki family."
trot_drugs.14.a: "It's just business."

trot_drugs.15.t: "Ending The Experiments"
trot_drugs.15.desc: "The Abizaal Syndicate were not fighters, they had hired thugs of course but the higher-ups were all chemists and biologists not often exposed to direct conflict. So when the state forces arrived and kicked down the doors to their underground labs the first reaction was confusion, they weren't due a delivery for another 2 weeks, but as the reality of their situation became clear panic spread quickly. Strangely they'd been more concerned with burning their research notes to stop them from being stolen than escaping the labs themselves so most of the research staff were quickly rounded up. Zuan himself was found in one of the labs midway through some experiment. When confronted he simply said:\n\n"Do not disturb my chemicals."\n\nThe search of the labs revealed many horrors that had long been rumoured but not believed. Those lucky enough to have either survived or not been subjected yet to the tests and experiments of the chemists were released from the purpose-built prison block beneath the labs. The furnaces for disposing of "the waste" left many of the zebra who discovered them with night terrors for years to come.\n\nThe trials were swift. Those who had been kidnapped and forced to work against their will were treated lightly, given confinement in mental hospitals until they could recover from what they had seen and done. Zuan was hung within the week and the ashes from his body were thrown into the sea. The rest would serve life in prison at a minimum. There was no public celebration at the destruction of the Syndicate, just a quiet collective cultural shock that such a thing could have happened within the boundaries of the Republic."

In one corner we have a gaggle of self-important fish with delusions of grandeur, while in the other we have a flock of witless scoundrels obsessed with the dullest possible celestial body. Their stupidity, however, is our opportunity.\n\nPossible Points: §Y10§! - §Y30§!. Points within this category will be allotted depending on how well we do within the context of the conflict in North Zebrica:\n     - We ignored the conflict but one or both sides of it are hostile to us: §Y+5§!\n     - We ignored the conflict: §Y+10§!\n     - We ignored the conflict but both sides are run by ambivalent regimes: §Y+15§!\n     - We negotiated a deal that favours our newfound partner: §Y+15§!\n     - We negotiated a deal that favours neither party: §Y+20§!\n     - We negotiated a deal that favours Colthage: §Y+30§!\n\n§YThe War Against Communism§!:\nZarishat's short lived regime taught all of §gColthage§! just how dangerous §RCommunism§! and all of its adjacent ideologies truly are. Thus it is not enough that we simply safeguard ourselves from §RMarksist Oppression§!, but our entire political and economic sphere. The following nations fall within our economic sphere:\n     - §YAsterion§!\n     - §YSicameon§!\n     - §YCyanolisia§!\n     - §YFalcor§!\n     - §YWingbardy§!\n     - §YDoelhi§!\n     - §YChital§!\n     - §YMacawia§!\n     - §YKasa§!\n     - §YHirvimaa§!\nPossible Points: §Y5§! - §Y50§!. The following conditions will affect the amount of points gained from this category:\n     - Each fully independent non-Communist nation will grant: §Y+5§!\n     - Each non-sovereign or subjugated nation will grant: §Y+2.5§!\n\n§YExpanded Trade§!:\nTrade is, was and always shall be the lifeblood of §gColthage§!, and while venture capital start up trading companies have been sufficient enough at upholding our economic interests, it simply is not enough. Thus we must seek closer ties to the various powers within our economic sphere.\n\nPossible Points: §Y2§! - §Y20§!. Points within this category can be gained by completing the following focuses:\n     - §YNorth Sea Diplomacy§!\n     - §YThe Hindian Connection§!\n\n§YReward Ranges§!:\n§Y1§! - §Y25§!: No Reward\n§Y25§! - §Y50§!: Minor Reward\n§Y50§! - §Y75§!: Decent Reward\n§Y75§! - §Y100§!: Large Reward\n\nWe currently have: §Y[?TRO_CTH_geopolitics_points]§!

From the bygone knights in the Kingdom of Vedina to the stalwart warriors of Nimbusia, he spent many years learning from truly fascinating civilizations.\n\nHis worldwide adventuring was halted, however, when he met the mare who would become his wife, a scientist from the up-and-coming land of Kása. While they did travel together for some time, the two eventually decided to settle down in the city of Colthage in Zebrica after the birth of their beautiful daughter.\n\nHaving established a home for his new family, Stacked briefly resumed his tenure as a history professor in the University of Colthage, garnering a great following of students and fellow professors who enjoyed his lively personality, only to be blindsided like everyone else when Colthage descended into civil war. He eventually found his classroom being utilized by the general staff of the Constitutionalist Army, causing him some frustration when he overheard some of the poor strategies they were theorizing. Being an expert in history included military history, and he was quick to correct the general staff on blunders that might lead to their downfall.\n\nPerhaps it is because of that spur of the moment decision that he now found himself leading a portion of Gerza's forces. Stacked never imagined himself a military commander, yet if it meant protecting his family, then he would serve the Republic with all his might.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: BunnyShrubby"

TRO_CTH_BATNOAM_ZARZA_DESC: "§YBorn§!: 5th of May, 971 in Kizil-Zeb\n\n§YRank§!: Generalissimo Of The United Republican Front\n\n§YBiography§!: Benoam Gerza should not be where he is today. Nothing in his life has lead him to this moment, and no gods placed their favor on him. Everything he has gained has been down to pure personal guile and opportunism, and he wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nBorn to a middle class Coltvan landowner, Gerza spent his entire early life trying to escape the condition of his Coltvan birth. His father had tried for years to earn the respect given to any Colthaginian of his status, but he was looked down upon as nothing more than a country hick. Gerza would continue his father's objective by doing all the dirty deeds asked of him by the local Colthaginian government, eventually earning a reputation as a ruthless, and mildly competent fixer. He enrolled in a local military academy and received an officer's commission thanks to his work as a grunt, and a decently sized bribe.\n\nThe one time Gerza made use of his Coltvan heritage was when the Storm King invaded Colthage. He met up with general Zoblos and they hid in the jungles of the eastern province, committing horrid reprisals on Storm King and Coltvan rebel forces alike. Though it should be noted, he never won a battle he personally led.\n\nFollowing the liberation of Colthage, he returned to his simple fixer work in the eastern regions, until the revolt of Zeshmunazash Zeirutid. Working with the militarist forces, he helped plan the meeting that would turn into a death trap for the Coltvan rebel, which in his eyes, finally liberated him from the legacy of that jungle slum of a prefecture. However, he didn't see Zarishat coming.\n\nLeading a resistance against her regime, he managed to gather to him cartel and constitutionalist forces that he could use as a blunt weapon against the second Zeirutid sibling. Succeeding in toppling her regime, he could never have predicted the chaos that now engulfs his land. But as he always has, he'll come out on top by making a few more deals.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Egil"

TRO_CTH_tiger_syndicate_desc: "The oldest and the most dangerous of the five cartels, the Tiger Syndicate was incubated within the depths of the Zarcid era prison system, and subsequently greatly enlarged during the reign of Zarishat. They are known for their penchant for extreme violence and have historically been prolific arms runners. They have since expanded their operations into racketeering and equine smuggling."
TRO_CTH_zaga_brothers_desc: "The Zaga Brotherhood are without a doubt the strangest cartel among the five. Their proliferation within the Colthaginian underworld came about as a direct result of the Zarishatian oppression of religious institutions. As a result, the Brotherhood attempts to portray itself as a sort of grassroots charismatic religious movement that just so happens to employ various hallucinogenics as a part of their rituals. Consequently, they are the largest drug smugglers in Colthage, dominating the flow of cocaine, cannabis and opium within the country and beyond."
TRO_CTH_zapsa_syndicate_desc: "The Zapsa Syndicate are simply a natural evolution of Colthage's already prolific history of smugglers and border merchants. If there was one word to describe the Zapsa Syndicate it would be - Neutrality. They're on good terms with their fellow Cartels and consistently try to keep their muzzles clean when it comes to government affairs. Their business model is running what amounts to a transport mega company for both legal and illegal goods. Were it not for the fact that they frequently get into shootouts with both our and the Hippogriffian border guards, they would not even be on this list."
TRO_CTH_zurumilki_desc: "The Zurumilki Family are a rather peculiar sort. While criminal organizations have always existed in Colthage in some capacity they have rarely managed to amass enough raw power and influence to supplant the government. Based on a bastardized version of the Wingbardian mafia model, the "Family" are a localised federation of various racketeers, extortionists, gang leaders, legitimate businesszebras and petty robber barons who have managed to almost fully supplant the government in the Sophoovene region. They are the smallest of the Cartels territorially, but effectively the richest due to their control of the region's oil fields."
TRO_CTH_abizaal_syndicate_desc: "What is there to say about the Abizaal Syndicate? Their origins a mystery, their structure unknown, and their goals if they even have any completely alien - They are without a doubt the most perfidious of the five Cartels. Worse yet, they have firmly grasped the strings of Colthage's chemical industry, and have subsequently become the largest producers of synthetic drugs within the country. Unlike most of the other Cartels, they tend to shy away from violence, preferring instead to strike at their enemies from the shadows - Be that through assassination, plots or political ploys."

TRO_CTH_zicardo_bio: "§L§YBorn:§! 962\n\n§YBiography§!: One of the most dangerous zebra in the Republic, there are two words to describe Zicardo. Brutal and efficient. Growing up in the slums of Colthage taught the young zebra that the world was split in two; those who had a weapon to wield and those who did not. Every zebra was taking something from those who could not defend themselves. This happened once to Zicardo. Once.\n\nHe honed his skills for violence in Zayda prison, doing a stretch for murder and theft, building up a following of like-minded psychopaths. Shortly thereafter he came to an agreement with a local arms factory; they gave him 15% of the guns they produced, and he didn't burn down their factory, their homes and kill their families. All fair and square.\n\nZicardo put the guns to work and quickly expanded his influence throughout the Republic killing anyone zebra that challenged him and absorbing their network into his own. A zebra of few words he lets his actions speak for him and his bloody trail tells quite the tale.\n\n§YPortrait By:§! Neither§!"
TRO_CTH_father_zisco_bio: "§L§YBorn:§! 960-965\n\n§YBiography§!: Father Zisco's history has been buried and what little that is known is subject to rumour and suspicion. Not surprising for a stallion who makes it his business to deal in secrets. He appears to have joined a monastic order as a young stallion before running off to Las Pegasus with a sack of charity money. Following something known only as "The Black Rock incident" he resurfaced in Chital, working briefly with one Madame Hira before crossing back into Colthage.\n\nWhat is certain is he knows the value of information above everything else. He is said to travel under the guise of a monk moving through the nation unseen and acquiring information from all corners. Some confess their sins to him hoping for a blessing, others reveal their secrets in a drug fuelled daze; the fact that he supplies the drugs is neither here nor there. When a quiet word here or a brewing scandal there can bring down a government or start a war such secrets can - and do - fetch a high price.\n\n§YPortrait By:§! Neither§!"
TRO_CTH_zermelqart_bio: "§L§YBorn:§! 968\n\n§YBiography§!: The underhoofed nature of Zermelqart's work leads many to believe that his past is full of misfortune and mistakes, driving him into a life of crime but it is not so. Born to a comfortably wealthy family Zermelqart was well educated and taught the value of helping those less fortunate than himself, a philosophy he took a little too far in his later life. His smuggling started out more as a charitable effort to supply alternative goods to those who could not afford the market prices for rarer necessities; this led him into contact with black market suppliers.\n\nHe slowly built up a network of contacts gaining a reputation as a zebra who could get anything that was needed for a reasonable price, a fair stallion who paid on time and could be trusted; be it within Colthage or beyond its borders, having his first run in with the coastguard while shipping medicinal whiskey from Hippogriffia. Then the first civil war arrived, and the black market exploded. Unfortunately, so did many of the shipments, war taking little consideration of the smuggler's shipping attempts. The suppliers got skittish, unsure their goods would ever make it into the country so they called on a zebra they could trust, Zermelqart, and so the Zapsa syndicate was born.\n\nWith Zermelqart in charge the smugglers were forced to make a choice, join up with him or go out of business. To his credit he organised them well, made sure they got a good cut and refused to work with the worst of them. He now sits at the head of a vast network shipping lanes and smuggling roads.\n\n§YPortrait By:§! Neither§!"
TRO_CTH_shama_zurumilki_bio: "§L§YBorn:§! 954\n\n§YBiography§!: Shama Zurumilki is one of the few Cartel leaders who is open about her past and why wouldn't she be, she's proud of who she is and how far she's come, having raised her "family" up from nothing. Starting out as little more than a street thug Shama rose quickly to the top of the Zoea underworld through her innovative use of the protection racket. The threat of violence was often all she needed to get what she wanted but she did not shy away from the rougher tactics, bragging about having beaten 3 stallions to death with her bare hooves.\n\nWith money came power and respect and Shama began to present the image of the respectable business zebra, the gang slowly morphing into the family as it is now known. Looking for investment opportunities throughout the province she'd buy up a warehouse or factory at a reduced price after a small suspicious fire and make a killing on the ground rent. Trainlines, power cables, water mains, you name it Shama had a hoof in it; soon she'd amassed enough money and property to effectively takeover the running of Sophoovene but the goal was always the oil market. Seeing the control over industry that oil allowed she's been trying - with limited success - to extend her influence into the market but it is only through the civil wars that she finally has her hooves on the black gold.\n\n§YPortrait By:§!

TRO_CTH_zuan_abizaal_bio: "§L§YBorn:§! 978\n\n§YBiography§!: Zuan Abizaal is rather unique amongst the other cartel leaders. While all the others carved out their empires through hard graft, he was handed his first lab on a plate. From a young age he excelled at chemistry being granted a scholarship to study at Colthage university, but he quickly came to disputes with his tutors who argued against his more outlandish experiments in the manufacture of artificial chemicals. His attempts to produce a new type of artificial fertilizer resulted in the burning down of one of the university labs, his expulsion, and the heavy scars that he bares today.\n\nHe did not disappear into obscurity though and was soon picked up by one of the more organised drug running outfits of the Republic and given his first lab. From there his success only grew, quickly becoming the chief chemist for his innovative new strains of artificial drugs and – following a sudden and unexpected series of drug induced heart attacks – he took control of the runners, reforming them into the Abizaal Syndicate.\n\nHe expanded the labs, funnelling the money they made back into modernisation and making them the most advanced in the country and with the addicts and debtors their drugs produced he was never short of test subjects for new drugs.\n\n§YPortrait By:§!

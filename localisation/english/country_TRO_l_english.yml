### Focuses ###
TRO_CTH_a1:0 "The War Of National Salvation"
TRO_CTH_a1_desc:0 "Colthage is, once again, burning. To save our home from tyrants and lunatics we must take up arms. For the Republic!"
TRO_CTH_a2:0 "Raise War "Taxes""
TRO_CTH_a2_desc:0 "Money wins wars and we have little of that. As the rightful government we shall tax our zebra, for their own good. Wouldn't want your house hit by artillery now, would you? Enemy artillery of course."
TRO_CTH_a3:0 "The Village Conscription System"
TRO_CTH_a3_desc:0 "Our zebra are tired of war, but war is not done with them. To ensure we can fight, every village must give a percentage of its inhabitants to the cause."
TRO_CTH_a4:0 "Organised Loot Distribution"
TRO_CTH_a4_desc:0 "Looting motivates our soldiers but also distracts them in combat. We need a simple system to keep them on task. Fight now, loot later. Let their battle cry be "Today, gods willing, we'll all be rich!""
TRO_CTH_a5:0 "Assure The Investors"
TRO_CTH_a5_desc:0 ""The market is having a momentary blip, nothing more, things will soon straighten out soon. Trust me, it's fine. Invest now in the Republic, the winning side, to guarantee future opportunities and tax cuts.""
TRO_CTH_a6:0 "Deepen Cartel Ties"
TRO_CTH_a6_desc:0 "Some of our weak willed and cowardly politicians fear the cartels but let's look at this objectively. They don't want to give up the power and influence they've gained so, if we work together, we can both profit. Let's make them an offer they can't refuse."
TRO_CTH_a7:0 "Float The Zebinop Textile Industry" 
TRO_CTH_a7_desc:0 "The backbone of our finances is the fabric industry. Every zebra, from farmer to fighter, needs textiles. By providing generous terms we can keep their business' running and provide for our troops requirements in the field."
TRO_CTH_a8:0 "The Merchants Of The Zebhara"
TRO_CTH_a8_desc:0 "Zebhara is a difficult place to account for. No Zebra would think we'd be able to get guns across its inhospitable landscape. Still, with a little help we might just manage it."
TRO_CTH_a9:0 "Negotiate With The AGWP"
TRO_CTH_a9_desc:0 "Winbardy may be just the kind of friend we're in need off. For a short term loan they've promised to provide us with the means to push our enemies back."
TRO_CTH_a10:0 "Stoke Republican Nostalgia"
TRO_CTH_a10_desc:0 "By reminding the zebra of their glorious past we can inspire them to fight harder for the future. It doesn't matter if we have to embellish a bit, no one will know the difference."
TRO_CTH_a11:0 "The Ever Cheap And Disposable Flayers"
TRO_CTH_a11_desc:0 "A smaller, motorized division can strike harder and faster into enemy territory. If they don't come back at least they've bought us some time. Off you go then."
TRO_CTH_a12:0 "The Always Reliable Holdbreakers"
TRO_CTH_a12_desc:0 "Quality over quantity. Let Starfather and Zanit expend themselves against us. We'll hold the line against all comers and drive them back when they're weakened."
TRO_CTH_a13:0 "The Gun Runners Of The Tiger Syndicate"
TRO_CTH_a13_desc:0 "Guns don't just fall off the back of a lorry. They have to be pushed. The Tiger Syndicate are the best gunrunners this side of Weter. If anyone can get us some guns on the side, it's them."
TRO_CTH_a14:0 "The Expertise Of Abizaal Syndicate"
TRO_CTH_a14_desc:0 "For all of their hideous produce, the Abizaal are some of the most creative minds in the country. Sending a few "volunteers" their way could help our efforts in the long run, provided they stick to their end of the bargain."
TRO_CTH_a15:0 "Prioritise Agricultural Redevelopment"
TRO_CTH_a15_desc:0 "Less hooves working the fields means more hooves in the fight. A simple equation but one that will give us the edge in the ongoing struggle."
TRO_CTH_a16:0 "Prioritise Industrial Reconstruction"
TRO_CTH_a16_desc:0 "What use is a soldier with no weapon to fight. We must make our industrial growth the top priority. If not there won't be a nation left to fight for."
TRO_CTH_a17:0 "The Strike Against Tyranny"
TRO_CTH_a17_desc:0 "Colthage has seen tyrant after tyrant over the last few years. Self-styled heroes turned into what they sought to destroyed. Through it all we never gave up hope. We knew our saviour would come. Gerza is that saviour and we should know we've followed a few."
TRO_CTH_a18:0 "The Slightly Less Ragged Banner Army"
TRO_CTH_a18_desc:0 "Our forces are still not what you'd call ideal, but they have improved notably. The size of the army has swollen and most of our soldiers have a gun and a helmet. We'd rate it a solid "OK". Ok, will have to do."
TRO_CTH_a19:0 "The Smugglers Of The Zapsa Syndicate"
TRO_CTH_a19_desc:0 "If you want it, the Zapsa Syndicate can get it and gods know we want for an awful lot right now. We must hope the price isn't too high, we'll have to pay it regardless. Perhaps we should remind them of they stand to lose should the war go against us."
TRO_CTH_a20:0 "Utilise The Zurumilki Family"
TRO_CTH_a20_desc:0 "For fight a modern war we must have oil. That means doing a deal with the Zurumiki and their ilk. Landowners in all but name, we'll have to lubricate discussions by fuelling their fears of losing their grip on the wells they control."
TRO_CTH_a21:0 "Shake Hooves With The Zaga Brotherhood"
TRO_CTH_a21_desc:0 "The Zaga are weird to say the least. The most unsettling of the cartels. Drug addicts in the guise of monks, their insistence on being dressing and acting like priests has its advantages though. They can pass unseen by most. Strange though they are, they may be a god send."
TRO_CTH_a22:0 "Optimise Wartime Production"
TRO_CTH_a22_desc:0 "We've got a solid foundation under our hooves. With the changes we've made we can now full speed into the final stages of the war. With one final effort, victory shall be ours."

TRO_CTH_b1:0 "The House Of Cards"
TRO_CTH_b1_desc:0 "The gamble has paid off. Whether it was a bluff or not doesn't matter anymore, all the challengers have folded and we've won the whole pot; now we just have to keep it as new gamblers come to the table looking for their share."
TRO_CTH_b2:0 "Bureaucratic Optimisation Initiative"
TRO_CTH_b2_desc:0 "There are some zebra in Colthage who – through some terrible madness – actually like doing paperwork and are quite suited to the job. If we give these disturbingly boring creatures exactly what they're after we can keep them out of the way and improve our administrative efficiency in one swoop."
TRO_CTH_b3:0 "Maintain Bicameralism"
TRO_CTH_b3_desc:0 "Powers the Senate and the Popular Assembly have over each other ensure that one house cannot gain too much influence; that’s how it’s meant to work at least. Things have been getting a bit unstable though with the Patricians gaining ground so we’d best tighten things up."
TRO_CTH_b4:0 "Unitarian Jurisprudence"
TRO_CTH_b4_desc:0 "A solid system of laws is required for any civilized nation to function without descending into violence and anarchy... again. There must be one set of laws for all, one governing body of courts and no-one will be above them."
TRO_CTH_b5:0 "Crack Down Upon "Hereditary" Positions"
TRO_CTH_b5_desc:0 "It's an age-old argument, "my mother held this position before me and her mother before her, etc." That might be true but it doesn't mean any of them were good at their jobs. It's time to shake up the system and leave the dead weight behind."
TRO_CTH_b6:0 "Controlled Nepotism"
TRO_CTH_b6_desc:0 "Certain tasks require a finesse, a lifetime of preparation and the character to produce the best results for the country. Officials like this cannot be trained, they are grown, aged like a fine wine into their positions. It is officials such as this that have made the Republic what she is today."
TRO_CTH_b7:0 "Federal Jurisprudence"
TRO_CTH_b7_desc:0 "The status quo cannot be demolished and rebuilt overnight, there are too many legal nuances throughout the nation and successive civil wars has layered laws upon laws in ways we cannot begin to understand. Best to leave the provinces to handle their own courts, that way, whe-if they screw up, they'll take the blame."
TRO_CTH_b8:0 "Implement The Tricameral Senate"
TRO_CTH_b8_desc:0 "The two houses of the Senate and the Popular Assembly have become unstable with the Patricians gaining more and more power, letting the Assembly slip into obscurity. To redress the imbalance we’ll set up a new chamber of selected advisors to oversee the other two houses; appointed by Benoam Gerza of course."
TRO_CTH_b9:0 "The General Bureaucrat Competency Exam"
TRO_CTH_b9_desc:0 "There is so much work to do and very little time to do it in. We need more hooves in government to pick up the slack, quantity will have to do over quality. As long as they can read, write and file paperwork we'll give them a job and put them to work."
TRO_CTH_b10:0 "Lobbyist Background Checks"
TRO_CTH_b10_desc:0 "To work in the senate or the assembly requires a rigorous selection process of interviews, competency tests and background checks and yet any zebra with a lobbyist pass can just walk in. Do you know the type of creatures that wonder these halls? We don’t and it’s time we found out."
TRO_CTH_b11:0 "Organise The Federal Police"
TRO_CTH_b11_desc:0 "A federal state requires federal enforcement, not some backwater sheriff who thinks he owns the place because he’s got a badge and a gun. These jumped up small town dictators need to be put in their place and reminded that they answer to the law, not the other way round."
TRO_CTH_b12:0 "Universal Welfare Rates"
TRO_CTH_b12_desc:0 "The health of our creatures is one of the pillars of the state and it is every creature’s right to have access to health care. This is not socialism, it’s kindness and the care of the nation for its citizens. Also, we can work them that little bit harder if we cover any accidents that might arise."
TRO_CTH_b13:0 "The Zarcid Scare"
TRO_CTH_b13_desc:0 "Harmony, that terrible word inscribed upon the chariot of the storm. It spreads amongst us like insidious force, a quiet plot reaching its tendrils through our nation like the roots of weeds through the foundation of the state. We will put a stop to it before it starts."
TRO_CTH_b14:0 "Opium Growing Licenses"
TRO_CTH_b14_desc:0 "To grow anything on a major scale in the Republic requires a license; farmers for corn and merchants for cotton and coffee. It ensures quality and that nothing goes astray to the black market. With the legalisation of opium we’ll extend the same rules to the poppy."
TRO_CTH_b15:0 "State Controlled Opium Manufacturing"
TRO_CTH_b15_desc:0 "If the state is going to legalise opium, then the state will manage the growth, manufacturing and distribution of opium. We can reap the tax and sales income and ensure that only those we deem fit have a hand in the process."
TRO_CTH_b16:0 "Curtail Patrician Opulence"
TRO_CTH_b16_desc:0 "What do the Patricians actually do. Sure, they hold seats in the senate but they just argue and talk in circles all day every day. They’re overpaid and underworked lay abouts who waste everyzebra's time. Make them earn their keep; cut their wages, remove their privileges and no more wine with lunch."
TRO_CTH_b17:0 "Implement Welfare Brackets"
TRO_CTH_b17_desc:0 "Help the needy is a noble cause - no zebra would deny that – but who exactly is needy? There are a lot of creatures out there looking to work the system for a free handout. Tying welfare benefits to household income will ensure only those who truly need help receive it."
TRO_CTH_b18:0 "Incentivise Private Security Companies"
TRO_CTH_b18_desc:0 "We cannot be everywhere all the time and constantly funding a nationwide police force will cost far too much. I mean, what about when there isn’t any crime? Just a waste of money. Setting up a network of bounty hunters will catch criminals when needed will be much more efficient."
TRO_CTH_b19:0 "The Lobbyist "Tax""
TRO_CTH_b19_desc:0 "Lobbyists only want to make the Republic a better place but advising is a privilege and should come at a cost and there are many things they can help cover; stamp duty, window tax, swamp insurance, hen food, dog biscuits, cow ointment – the expenses are endless."

TRO_CTH_c1:0 "Secretary Of Defence Jebzel Zoblos"
TRO_CTH_c1_desc:0 "Of all the officers and soldiers who fought for our freedom Jebzel is the example to be followed. Knowing determination in combat, restraint in peace, and how to put the lives of our citizens before profit, the task of organising a formal state army shall be put in her honourable hooves."
TRO_CTH_c2:0 "The Mercenary Naturalisation Act"
TRO_CTH_c2_desc:0 "Our liberators came from all corners of the world to fight for the Republic. Motivated by honour, glory, idealism or profit, it matters not, what matters is that many lost their lives here and more found a life within these lands. Offering citizenship to all who fought would be a fitting tribute to their sacrifice and provide a boast to the fledging army."
TRO_CTH_c3:0 "Tighten The Chain Of Command"
TRO_CTH_c3_desc:0 "During the war there was very little structure to the army, officers were let off the leash to achieve their goals in whatever way they saw fit. To avoid confusion and rebuild discipline we will need to review the chain of command and remove any dead ends. Gone are the days when a zebra could promote themselves to any old rank."
TRO_CTH_c4:0 "Establish The Republican Air Force"
TRO_CTH_c4_desc:0 "he future of war lies in with the air force. Just one squadron of CAS can wipe out divisions of armour, a dozen bombers can make the sky fall on our enemies and clear the way for an infantry push. To ensure our full military capability we shall embrace the sky like a second home."
TRO_CTH_c5:0 "Fullscale Defensive Regionalism"
TRO_CTH_c5_desc:0 "The army should be broken down to regional branches for the defence of the Republic and a level of autonomy granted. These troops know the landscape of their homes like the back of their hoof and provide an expertise which would be lacking in a more general defence structure."
TRO_CTH_c6:0 "The Military Contractor Compensation Act"
TRO_CTH_c6_desc:0 "A reorganisation is needed of the various military groups within the Republic. Legislation to regulate what mercenary groups can operate where will ensure they understand their tasks and are properly paid for their services. No more looting wherever they want, they work for a wage now."
TRO_CTH_c7:0 "The AHC Fireteam Theorem"
TRO_CTH_c7_desc:0 "Fools and idiots dream of being the hero behind the lines, Daring Do style. That mindset has no place in war and will get a lot of good soldiers killed. Attack, hold, consolidate, attack, hold consolidate, a simple strategy well executed will carry the day."
TRO_CTH_c8:0 "Industrial Scale Warfare"
TRO_CTH_c8_desc:0 "In times of war we must use every asset at our disposal to defend our nation and its citizens. Drawing up plans for how to bring our full industrial and military weight to bear, well in advance, will save lives in the event of conflict."
TRO_CTH_c9:0 "Air To Land Coordination Tactics"
TRO_CTH_c9_desc:0 "Full co-operation between the army and the air force will improve the efficiency of both, turning any conflict quickly in our favour. A joint operations branch to share information between the two is being set up to provide support quickly and accurately, wherever it's needed."
TRO_CTH_c10:0 "The Republican Bomber Fleet"
TRO_CTH_c10_desc:0 "There are stories that, in days of old, armies would blot out the sun with storms of arrows. Times may have moved on, but the principle of irresistible force remains. We shall fill the sky with bombers and lay waste to any who would threaten us."
TRO_CTH_c11:0 "Strike Force Operations"
TRO_CTH_c11_desc:0 "The future of warfare lies in small precise units, carrying out surgical strikes against the enemy, crippling them before they get a chance to retaliate. Organising these units and providing the military contractors with the resources they need to complete such dangerous tasks should be our top priority."
TRO_CTH_c12:0 "Military Nimbusianism"
TRO_CTH_c12_desc:0 "The training standards of our troops is lacking when compared with other, more militaristic nations and while we do not seek to emulate such hardships there is truth in the saying, brutal training makes for easy battles."
TRO_CTH_c13:0 "Restore The Armoury System"
TRO_CTH_c13_desc:0 "What use is a gun with no bullet, or a tank with no fuel. By taking full account of every weapon in our army we can ensure that the needs of each soldier is met, be they driver, engineer or frontline fighter."
TRO_CTH_c14:0 "Infantry Kit Standardisation"
TRO_CTH_c14_desc:0 "Providing our troops with the equipment they need to react to any challenge will keep momentum on our side as we attack. No ambush, no trap, no counterattack or outflank will catch our soldiers unprepared. Come what may, they'll be ready."
TRO_CTH_c15:0 "The Feathered Serpents"
TRO_CTH_c15_desc:0 "The snake strikes, one sharp precise attack that lays low the mightiest beast in the jungle. Such a power is to be emulated and, should we give our snakes wings, they well be able to strike at any beast before they reach our lands."
TRO_CTH_c16:0 "Infantry Kit Specialisation"
TRO_CTH_c16_desc:0 "To defend everything is to defend nothing. We need to give our soldiers what they need to get the job done and nothing more to avoid them becoming bogged down with unnecessary equipment."
TRO_CTH_c17:0 "Prioritise Troop Mechanisation"
TRO_CTH_c17_desc:0 "Fast mobile troops can respond to attacks or take the initiative and drive through the gaps in enemy lines. These small, independently operating divisions will sow chaos amongst any attackers, allowing our infantry to take advantage of the enemies' weakness. Good old fashioned hit and run tactics on modern wheels."
TRO_CTH_c18:0 "Infantry Support Tank Development"
TRO_CTH_c18_desc:0 "Armour is the next evolution of warfare but it's use it still up for discussion. If we attached armoured companies to our infantry, they will be better protected as they advance, without risk of the tanks over-extending and becoming cut off."
TRO_CTH_c19:0 "The Medical Rapid Response Corps"
TRO_CTH_c19_desc:0 "Getting our soldiers home is amongst our top priorities. We will drill our rescue and recovery crews hard to bring back as many wounded soldiers from the front as possible. Compact folding stretchers, popup field hospitals and all the modern medical tools at our disposal shall be used to save our brave troops."
TRO_CTH_c20:0 "Airborne Logistical Optimisation"
TRO_CTH_c20_desc:0 "We should focus on getting supplies and weapons to the front lines quickly. The new developments in transport aircraft can assist in this, taking some of the burden off the supply truck convoys crossing the battlefields. Push back the enemy, then we can see to securing the area."
TRO_CTH_c21:0 "The Manoeuvre Warfare Theorem"

TRO_CTH_c23_desc:0 "The honour, strength and force of our mercenaries has been proven time and again. They fight for the Republic and die for the Republic just as any other soldier. Their might shall be added to our own with the formal unification of command, and let no Zebra doubt their dedication to our freedoms."
TRO_CTH_c24:0 "The Always Loyal Army Of The Republic"
TRO_CTH_c24_desc:0 "Gone are the days of the ragged banner. The standards of our armies fly high and proud, reshaped and unfurled by Jebzel's expert hoof and careful planning. The glory of the Republic is restored and what foe could hope to snatch it from us again with armies such as these at our back."

TRO_CTH_d1:0 "The Zahummid Committee"
TRO_CTH_d1_desc:0 "Devastated does not begin to describe our economy. Successive civil wars have utterly destroyed our potential. If we are to recover from this, we'll need a body that can take whatever action is necessary to pull us back from the precipice, unbound by party and politics."
TRO_CTH_d2:0 "Selective Bailouts"
TRO_CTH_d2_desc:0 "The very basics of a functional state are about to collapse out from under us. We cannot allow our essential services to flatter - the zebra of the Republic must have water and power. By bailing out the utilities we can stabilise industries further down the supply chain in one decisive action."
TRO_CTH_d3:0 "The Agricultural Recovery Project"
TRO_CTH_d3_desc:0 "Famine is ripping through our country like a blowtorch through butter. With so many of our agricultural workers pulled away to war, many of whom never came back, there are not enough hooves in the field. With a drastic program of training and mechanisation we can begin to reclaim our fallowed fields."
TRO_CTH_d4:0 "Consolidate The Sophoovene Oil Fields"
TRO_CTH_d4_desc:0 "The need for oil during the war led to anyone with a shovel setting up independent wells. We bought what we could from whoever we could out of desperation but now that peace has returned it's time to consolidate these independent wells into more efficiently run enterprises."
TRO_CTH_d5:0 "Prioritise Cash Crop Cultivation"
TRO_CTH_d5_desc:0 "An acre of wheat will feed a family, but an acre of cotton will turn enough of a profit to feed 5 families. By focusing on our exportable agriculture, we can use the profits to import food, feeding our zebra and balancing the budget at the same time."
TRO_CTH_d6:0 "Foreclose Unprofitable Assets"
TRO_CTH_d6_desc:0 "We cannot continue to support unprofitable enterprises; the state is nearly bankrupt with debt repayments from the wars. By allowing failed businesses to collapse we'll open up the market to new companies, spurring creativity and relieving the government of some of its burdens."
TRO_CTH_d7:0 "Incentivise Middle Class Asset Growth"
TRO_CTH_d7_desc:0 "A modern nation needs a functioning middle class to help facilitate and run a growing economy. If we encourage the growth of this returning middle class we can become more economical flexible whilst increasing demand for the goods they require. Who said nothing good comes from middle mares."
TRO_CTH_d8:0 "Establish Credit Caps"
TRO_CTH_d8_desc:0 "Credit is an essential tool in economic development, it allows for the purchasing of goods without requiring full upfront payment, but It's a double-edged sword which can land the unprepared in debts they cannot cover. We'll have to keep a close eye on credit limits to protect our citizens from unscrupulous businesses."
TRO_CTH_d9:0 "Utilise The Natural Gas Deposits"
TRO_CTH_d9_desc:0 "There are large deposits of natural gas under Sophoovene. Mining it is an engineering challenge but if we're successful we can use it to support our growing fuel demands, freeing up more oil for military usage."
TRO_CTH_d10:0 "Experimental Fracking Methods"
TRO_CTH_d10_desc:0 "Fracking as a new, and somewhat controversial, technology that involves pumping chemicals into the ground to "crack" open gas deposits. It's an ingenious idea that opens up new resources to drive our economy. Perhaps a little investment would be worthwhile."
TRO_CTH_d11:0 "Falsify Colthage's  Credit Rating"
TRO_CTH_d11_desc:0 "The constant turmoil of the last few years has left little trust in our economic surety, thus there are few nations willing to invest or lend us credit. This reputation will break us unless we engage is some "creative accounting". We cannot let our zebra suffer due to some numbers on a page."
TRO_CTH_d12:0 "Safeguard Patrician Assets"
TRO_CTH_d12_desc:0 "The Patricians are the single largest holders of wealth in the Republic. By offering protections on their assets we can encourage them to invest more of their money into the economy in the knowledge that their investments are safe."
TRO_CTH_d13:0 "Horizontal Economic Planning"

trotkart_colthage.1.t:0 "The Generalissimo Who Never Won A Battle"
trotkart_colthage.1.d:0 "The cheers of the crowds rang in his ears as Benoam Gerza returned to his office, the adrenaline fading into his natural state of cold calculation. At last, his chance had come. Years of subtle diplomacy and political intrigue had placed him at the top of the fledgling republic; granted no one else had wanted the job but that mattered little to him. He'd built his life on exceeding expectations, just like his father before him. Rising from the rural lands of Coltvan, they'd always been looked down on by the zebra of the capital and their ilk, forced to fight tooth and hoof for every scrap of influence and respect. Overlooked and ignored, their family had learned to use guile, subtly and no small amount of cunning to rise through the ranks of politics.\n\nTaking his seat behind his desk he glanced over the military reports provided by his generals. It was obvious that they'd been dumbed down, draft numbers and arms shipments reduced to "need guns here" but he didn't care, he'd be the first to admit he wasn't much of a soldier. His time in the army was largely ceremonial but that was what his officers and mercenaries were for. They'd fight the battles, he just had to get them what they needed.\n\nHe was in the enviable position of being the political balance between the psychotic Star father and the idealists of Zanit; with the fanatics removed both sides came running to his cause. Many of the old guard and industrialists flocked to him, promising financial support in exchange for protection. The youth of the Scientific Clique offered technology to give him the edge in the conflict. Even some of the more dubious, possibly criminal, elements of Colthaginian society came forward with offers of aid, in exchange for reasonable concessions of course. A bit could buy a gun and with enough bits he'd buy an army and take the Republic for himself. It was time for Gerza to demonstrate to the world what he could do.\n\nHe picked up a picture of his father from the desk."

trotkart_colthage.2.t:0 "The Knights Of The Modern Era"
trotkart_colthage.2.d:0 "The Sloppy Stallion had never seen such good business. The door to the bar was now propped open to save the wear on the hinges as zebra came and went. The mercenaries that came through viewed each other with disdain through to downright hatred despite fighting on the same side, fighting for Gerza. They still needed a place to drink and spend their bits without descending into a brawl though. That was where the owner, Tepid Pour, stepped in. He set up The Sloppy Stallion as neutral territory and started building his fortune.\n\nAll the Mercs drank here on their way through the region, Mad Mic, Raw Deal, even Jebzel Zoblos who'd been spotted a few times at the bar. Through this network of uneasy truces Tepid got all the news from the front, and even some bits of info they'd no doubt shoot him over, as the leaders of each of the groups discussed their fortunes. Collecting some mugs and plates from the tables he overheard just such a conversation. A visibly battle hardened zebra sharing a table with a Pegasus.\n\n"Another few truckloads of Vultures heading for Colturubis tomorrow I heard. Lets hope they get slaughtered, more bits in my bag when my guys go in to clean up the mess." The zebra drunkenly slurred\n"Makes you wonder doesn't it." The Pegasus replied. Her getup had all the hallmarks of Nimbusai about it. The fighting brought in mercs from all over "Where's Gerza getting the money from? I heard he gave the Fleet Hooves enough bits to buy an island just for trying to take Zaptis."\n"He's got some deal going with the Tigers I heard. Either that or he craps gold."\n"Nah, Bodzathart, he's financing it all, I'm sure of it, not that I care. As long as the bits keep coming, I'm happy. We'll prove our worth next week on the road to Colthage"\n"Better watch yourself." The old veteran replied. "One day you'll end up like the Vultures."\n"Ha, If I'm gonna die, I'll die drunk and rich. What more can a mare hope for." The Pegasus emptied her cider before staggering off to the bar for more.\n"Moron." Murmuring under his breath the zebra leaned across and pulled some papers from the Pegasus' bag. "Good luck without any maps." The zebra emptied his mug and headed for the door. Tepid shock his head and collected the mugs. Same thing, different day."

trotkart_colthage.3.t:0 "Yet Another Cog"
trotkart_colthage.3.d:0 "The evening had passed in a fog of cigar smoke, whiskey and the clanking of the accounting machines. A stream of constant funds coming in from all over the country and beyond funnelled through and straight out again for the war effort, all added and deducted to come down to this, the final tally. In one column were the bits the Republic still had in the bank, a nice round zero in black ink. In the other column was the total debt they owed, somewhere between eyewatering and soul crushing, in red ink. Turns out wars are expensive. Feeding and equipping soldiers was breaking the back of the nation's finances and that was before they even thought about paying them.\n\nAzizelquart, Gerza's new financial advisor, had passed the point of despairing and come to a single conclusion. Gerza had to keep winning. As long as they kept pushing forwards they could loot the taken lands to pay their debt which, combined with the donations and contributions from the industrialists, should be able to keep them afloat. After finally winning the war the new state could get things under control and repay the loans at their own pace.\n\nIt was wishful thinking he knew but what else could he do. If the war went against them or even stalled out things would only get worse until they went bankrupt. He had to trust in Gerza's leadership and ability to prosecute the war – it was about 5 minutes later Azize started planning to funnel money into an undersea account. If they lost he'd need a fallback. Starfather winning would be a disaster, at best he'd be able to flee the country, at worst he'd lose his head, but under Zanit there might still be a place for him. With some bits in his account he could to secure a position in the new state, everyone had their price, even Zanit.\n\nMarking the planned transfer as "Military surplus expenditure" he cleared any records that might tie the account to him, just in case any zebra might go snooping around. He was a survivor and no matter who won this war he was determined to come out on the winning side."
trotkart_colthage.3.a:0 "I managed to fix Zarishat's books..."

trotkart_colthage.4.t:0 "Sentimientos"
trotkart_colthage.4.d:0 ""That seems... respectable." Shama Zurumilki concurred as she drew a circle around Neigheris and the surrounding land. The map was covered in lines and circles, the newly agreed upon boundaries of the five cartels. Around the table was gathered the five heads of the most powerful criminal families in Colthage, each there to carve up the state following the war. Zuan Abizaal of the Abizaal Syndicate had laid claim to the Amanesya region, the perfect spot of underground labs within easy reach of Quaggatai. Shama of the Zurumilki family had taken the oil wells around Neigheris. The Zaga Brotherhood, led by the mad monk Father Zisco, had been granted free passage through the provinces to preach their twisted version of faith, provided their debauched parties ran on Abizaal drugs of course. Zermelqart, founder and head of the Zapsa Syndicate had taken the Sivmareas and Zamitha provinces, easier access to the border crossings into Hippogriffia. With a little support from the Zaga Brotherhood they'd also gotten the use of the rivers that ran throughout Colthage to move their wares. A smuggler's dream.\n\nLast, but by no means least, was Zicardo of the Tiger Syndicate. The most dangerous of the cartels, the Tiger ran guns up and down the length of nation. More than once had they gotten carried away and used the very weapons they were meant to be selling. Only the combined strength of the other four cartels could bring Zicardo to the negotiating table. Unstable though he was, he wasn't stupid. He could see what was going on just as clearly as the others.\n\nGerza's push for power and the civil war had presented an opportunity they could not afford to pass up. If they supported his efforts and helped him secure his power then Colthage would be a playground for the cartels, they just had to ensure they didn't waste their strength fighting each other and give Gerza a chance to get rid of them when the war concluded. A pact had been struck in that empty warehouse on the waterfront, the Republic craved up and an agreement not to mess with each other's business was reached. Each of them round the table knew that gaining power was simple, keeping it was the real challenge. There was enough blood on their hooves to attest to that."

trotkart_colthage.5.t:0 "A Leech Among Leeches"
trotkart_colthage.5.d:0 ""And for the risotto for you Sir." The waiter set the plate before the zebra.\n"Thank you kindly." He replied, adjusting his tie slightly Zaalisillhek Bodzathart regarded the others around the table. Industrialists and landlords from all over Colthage that he'd called together – snakes and thieves the lot of them, couldn't trust them as far as you could buck them. The waiters departed having served each of those present, leaving Zaalis to begin with a smile mostly made of teeth, reciting his prepared speech.\n"My friends, firstly, thank you for joining me, it really has been too long since we've seen each other. Of course, we've all been busy, building this wonderful country into something we could be proud of, alas, ‘twas not to last. Anarchism has shredded any resemblance of order the Republic once held. We've all suffered, our business' vandalised, our interests –"\n"Get to the point!" A zebra interrupted; mouth full of gold teeth and half chewed food.\n"As forthright as ever Zquard." Zaalis replied with gritted teeth. "The point is this. If Starfather or Zanit win the war, we've had it. Done, finished, foreclosed and spent without recourse. Our only option is to rally behind Gerza, that way we can keep and even expand on our interests. Being from Coltva he's a zebra who can be manipula - who... can be professionally guided towards the right decisions. We here, the greatest industrial minds in the country, can help build this nation back into a prosperous one. There are some who might accuse us of having our own agenda. Nonsense, absurd, It's just unfortunate that lifting up our fellow zebra involves raising our own status, the rising tide lifts all ships after all. This will require teamwork, a real partnership, so what do you say?"\n"Beautifully argued." Zquard agreed. "I see now we have a moral duty to help pull the Republic back from the brink in anyway we can, and if we should be rewarded it will be no more than we've earned." He raised a glass to Zaalis.\nLifting his own glass, Zaalis returned the gesture as the clink of crystal around the table signalled the agreement of those present. "Always nice to have these little chats amongst... friends.""
trotkart_colthage.5.a:0 "Ever greater riches await us"

trotkart_colthage.6.t:0 "A Port In The Storm"
trotkart_colthage.6.d:0 ""You need to rein it in." Gerza set the decanter down with a thump to emphasis his point. Crossing back across his office to take his seat at the desk, he passed one of the two glasses to Jebzel Zoblos.\n\n"How am I supposed to do that when my forces see the other mercs raiding, pillaging and getting rich whilst mine sit around struggling to get by. They haven't been paid for two months and it's getting harder to keep them in line." She sipped at her bourbon, the gentle burn strengthening her resolve.\n\n"Don't worry about they pay, I've sorted it. The trucks will drop off the bits next week."\n\n"That's what you said last week."\n\n"It's sorted, trust me just..." Trailing off he sighed and emptied his glass in one go. "Ok, let me be frank with you, Jebzel, you're the only one I can trust out of those packs of bloodhounds and treasure hunters. This war won't last forever and when it does finally come to an end questions will be asked about who allowed those raids and atrocities to take place. I need it on the record that I tried to stop them, I cannot be held responsible or it's all for nothing. These bands of roving thugs call themselves soldiers but they're little more than gangs and they will be held accountable for what they've done, even wars have rules. Do you see what I'm saying? When the dust settles I need to be above reproach but I can't do that alone.\n\nThe Republic will need an army, a proper army, led by a professional, battle-hardened commander, not some jumped up thug in an ill-fitting uniform. I want you to be that zebra and for that you need to show that your soldiers are soldiers, not savages."\n\nJebzel turned the glass over in her hooves. "So you're allowing the other mercs to run loose so you can build up evidence against them, even whilst they help you win the war." She stated.\n\n"Sometimes a gift is not a gift." He returned to the decanter and refilled his glass. "Your team will have it hard yes, they'll see others getting rich while they fight but their reward will come and it will far outstretch some stolen bits. I just need you to keep them disciplined. If anyone can do that it's you." He offered her a top up to go with his truths. Nodding, she held out her glass."

trotkart_colthage.7.t:0 "Boundless Optimism"
trotkart_colthage.7.d:0 "Zuan smiled as he greeted the visitors, directing them to their seats in front of the stage, they'd have a good view of his talk. After the University had effectively shut down due to the successive civil wars he'd been cast adrift, unsure of what to do with himself – with the whole country tearing itself apart yet again there didn't seem much time for science and research. The only knowledge that seemed to matter was how to kill and wage war. That was when the party found him and reminded him that science was about more than progress for its own sake, it was about making life better for the common zebra.\n\nThe talks started soon after that, The Young Scientifics, as the group called itself were the heirs to the Scientific Clique that collapsed during the previous wars. Whilst more idealistic than their predecessors they still held high standards for their members, with membership granted only through invitation. Zuan knew the honour he'd been given when his invitation came and had accepted at once, the chance wouldn't come again. They counted amongst their number engineers, doctors, chemists and more. They went from town-to-town teaching Zebra and ponies how to repair generators damaged by bombs, how to dress a shrapnel wound, how to make basic herbal antiseptics. They took no payment for their time but were always warmly received, often the locals were happy just to talk about something other than the war. This approach allowed them to connect directly with the grassroots, build up support they could wield in the political sphere.\n\nGerza himself had taken an interest in their movement, offered them a seat at the table in exchange for the expertise they could provide and Zuan was very keen to get his hooves into the task. Politics was where the problems were, the causes of the wars, but then their movement was about fixing problems, about helping make the Republic a better place. They could repair as many water pipes as they wanted but it wouldn't save the world, only repairing the political system would do that.\n\nPushing the thoughts from his mind he focused on the task at hoof, tonight he would give a talk on physics involved in repairing a building and how to ensure it didn't collapse in the process."

trotkart_colthage.8.t:0 "The End Of The Civil War"
trotkart_colthage.8.d:0 "Peace at last. The cycle of war and destruction come to an end, again. The zebra of the Republic are happy and celebrating but they've been here before. A great deal of work is required if they're going to trust the new government.\n\nGerza is just the zebra for that. He has proven himself more than capable of balancing the matters of state and war whilst steering the ship of the nation through civil strife. Some wonder though is he a zebra of peace? Can he maintain the balance he has struck and rebuild the country into it's former glory. Every citizen of the Republic hopes he can succeed, they're tired of war and want their old lives back, all that can be done now is watch and wait."
trotkart_colthage.8.a:0 "Liberty at last!"

trotkart_colthage.9.t:0 "Secretary Of Defence Jebzel Zoblos"
trotkart_colthage.9.d:0 "The party was in full swing, the grand hall full of music and light, laughter in every corner, a banquet to feed hundreds and at the centre of it all Jebzel Zoblos. Cutting a dashing figure in her new uniform, she basked in the attention of each and every guest as they congratulated her. She knew it was all politics, every guest at the party had been carefully selected and vetted; there would be no awkward scenes tonight and everyone knew what was expected of them. In 3 months each of them would be back asking for a new defence contract, weapons deal or to look the other way when their brother got caught smuggling again, but she didn't care at all. The supreme commander of the colthaginian enjoyed every moment of it and why shouldn't she, she'd earned this, her soldiers had suffered terribly during the war, restricted from their rightful plunder and spoils but now she could reward them and all her allies, Gerza approving of course.\n\nGerza watched on; he'd made a good choice in her, personally of course, if she turned out to be good at her job then even better but that was less important. What mattered most was the loyalty of the army and with Jebzel in charge they were in his back pocket. He'd won the war for nation and now there was nothing to stop them.\n\n"How you pulled this off I'll never know." Azizelquart appeared at his shoulder "She should be in prison not in charge of the army, surely some zebra in the senate objected to this."\n\n"A few." Garza replied casually. "But when you've got them by the short hairs, their hearts and minds will follow." He raised his glass to Jebzel who smiled at him across the room."

The wood spat and crackled as the four mercenaries settled themselves again.\n"Anyway, get on with the story."\n"Well, I reversed the truck, clipped the building and the whole thing came down and buried me. Woke up 3 days later in a hospital and there she was sitting at my bedside. She'd dug me out while the rescue teams were still on the way and now, we're getting married in three months."\n"So, you're staying here then?" The pegasus put in. "You poor sod. First chance I get I'm on a ship back to Nimbusi. Got my family to think about."\n,"Why not bring them here?" One of the two unicorns queried, swigging from a bottle. "My brother's coming over from Baltimore, he's going to setup a lumberyard, there's plenty of demand should rebuilding materials. Should be able to send some contracts his way once I'm a Major."\n"You been offered a commission in the new army too? I'm going to be a colonel. Got a stallion I'm sweet on over in Colthage, can't resist a uniform." The Zebra smirked as he tossed another log on the fire. "Might as well get the most out of it right, I mean, I got shot for this country."\n"You got shot because you were drunk, fell down the stairs and shot yourself in the leg. I'm still amazed you didn't blow your brains out."\nThe pegasus stared into the fire nursing her beer. "I could bring my two fillies across, take up that special forces position, wouldn't take much, I'd just have to leave my pride behind in Nimbusi." she smirked.\n"Hah! Good, your pride nearly got us killed, I was at the battle of Colthage remember, I saw you trying to led that charge through the weapons factory, talk about herding cats, I love that story go on, tell it."\nShe sighed with a smile and regarded the friends. They'd come here as soldiers looking for adventure, to fight for bits and now, well, the future was uncertain. "Things went wrong before we started. Two nights before, while I was drinking in the bar, some bastard nicked my maps so we were already behind schedule. I said, that looks like a shortcut over...""

trotkart_colthage.11.t:0 "Professionals Have Standards"
trotkart_colthage.11.d:0 ""Reporting Sir." The Captain saluted as he stood to attention doing his best to hide a smile, finally his moment had come. He'd been called to General Mad Mic's office in the early evening as the sunset cast the room into half shadow, he'd heard about the commissions in the new army being handed out to mercs over the last few days and this appointment had to be a big one.\n\n"We've been going over your war record Captain." The General addressed him leaning back on her desk. "Quite frankly I am disgusted." The Captain's face dropped. "Your conduct has been appalling. Looting, arson, assaulting the locals, neglecting your duties, being drunk on active duty. We cannot and will not stand for this in the army of the Republic. You are hereby stripped of your rank and dishonourably discharged. Dismissed." The captain stood dumbfounded. He couldn't process what he had hearing. The General watched him. "Did I stutter?"\n\n"You can't be serious. The Defence secretary is a war criminal and I'm being fired for doing my job?! Yeah, I might have had a drink now and then but I didn't burn down a town!"\n"I said you're dismissed!"\n"You can't dismiss me, I know things, I'll take her down with me! I was at Gades, I know why it's not on the maps anymore. This is Gerza's doing! That bastard's protecting her. He's so crooked he sleeps in a spiral staircase. I'll take them all down, him and his piece of-" The General crossed the room and headbutted the former captain who crumpled to the floor with a shout, his cries cut off as Mad Mic put her boot in the shamed officer's gut.\n\n"Guards!" The door burst open as two earth ponies stormed in, guns at the ready. "Get this civilian off my base! Help him fall down some stairs and break his jaw, that'll teach him not to spread lies. Make sure it heals badly." The guards grabbed his legs and dragged him from the office, closing the door behind them as they went. General Mic sighed and leaned against her desk, turning to look into the shadows where Jebzel stood.\n\n"Who's next?" She smiled."

Don't want to get hauled in for filing the wrong thing again."\n"How was I to know that extortion and bribery were different forms? I'm a soldier, not a bureaucrat."\n\nThe Captain rolled his eyes as he finished sorting out the bits on the table. In the old days three officers counting bits out of a sack on a table in a bar would have raised a few eyebrows, now it was all official and above board, every bit was accounted for and all transactions were out in the open. It was a simple system, the local defence forces would collect donations from business, famers, factories, etc. They'd keep their cut for collecting the bits and the rest would be sent up the chain, all fair and even handed. The locals were even glad of the service, they got a receipt for their donations which they could use to claim back some tax and, unlike the old days, they actually got the protection they paid for. Nothing like a tank shell to see off the timberwolves. Tepid Pour, the bar owner, was also glad of the extra business, on a good day the officers coming through would buy a few rounds for the bar.\n\nThe system worked.

The new suit would emphasise his scars, a low-cut collar to show off the strength on his neck muscles, he could picture it all as he looked in the mirror. "I'll not complain, I've done my share of fighting and I'm going to enjoy the easy life I'm entitled to." He stepped out of the fitting room, the tailor finishing up his work and making some final notes.\n\n"I'll send the final design on Sir." The veteran nodded as he re-joined his two comrades in the waiting area where they sipped whiskey awaiting his return. This was what it was all about, the high life and reward they'd fought for, no more battlefield looting or pillaging, Jebzel's reforms made them salaried soldiers, licensed by the Republic, and business was good.\n\n"All done? I got lunch with Zquard in an hour. He's trying to sell me on some contract spare parts for tanks." A laid-back unicorn said\n\n"We've not got any tanks in our division."\n\n"So?

For the last three weeks the only things that had come through where the trains carrying fuel and the trucks that needed it and none of them stayed long, why would they. The depot was as close to nowhere as it was possible to be and they were stuck in the middle of it, one stop on a long road to places that actually matter.\n"What are you going to do with your leave?" The deer asked dealing out the cards, he could do this with his eyes closed, three weeks of Appleosa hold ‘em burned the movement into muscles memory.\n"See my wife, eat ‘til I can't stand and drink ‘til I can't see. You?" The greying zebra sighed.\n"Much the same, it's a sensible plan, why ruin it." The bearded zebra replied. "Three weeks stuck here makes you appreciate the simple pleasures. 1 week of that then another 3 weeks of this hellhole."\n"Let's be honest, we're sick of everything here." The dear interrupted, sliding some bits into the pot. "3 weeks of sitting in this shack watching conveys come and go with nothing but a deck of cards and that radio to stay sane and all it picks up is some Chital talk show, I'm amazed we haven't gone mad and shot each other. Hey did you feel that?" The deer looked at a glass of water on the table where slight ripples danced.\n\n"Feels like a convoy." The bearded zebra sighed climbing to his hooves and collecting his bits. "Alright, you go check the fuel reserves I'll get the trucks lined up and you get the fuel hoses out.

The driver, a young thestral private, said with a smile as he climbed out of the cab "Had to drive back on the flat. I did say we shouldn't have removed the spare."\n"We couldn't risk the weight. The truck might have gotten bogged down, but I take your point. We'll just take one less crate in future. Any other trouble?"\n"Nope, all went according to plan. We loaded up the gun crates, headed south on the usual patrol route, met Father Zisco and his goons near the border, gave him the crates, loaded up the coke and here we are, missus one wheel."\n"Good, I've declared the guns faulty and have listed them as being destroyed. Don't fix the wheel, take the truck over the workshop and make sure they see the flat, tell them the spare was damaged." The lieutenant and private walked round the truck to find the three zebra had unloaded three bags of coke and one gun crate from the truck.\n"What the buck is that?!" The lieutenant pointed at the crate.\n"Relax, Zisco won't miss it, he was too high to count what we gave him and we can sell it on to someone else. Pure profit."\n"Well, I hope for your sake you're right, because if he finds out you've screwed him over, he'll use you as a living buckpost for his next orgy."

Tree tops bending in their wake as they flew on, low to the ground to avoid radar detection; an off the record job, a few bits on the side, who could it hurt. The bomb bay, lit by a dim red light and which had once held the weapons to level a small town, held three large wooden crates suspended form a railing along the roof. The crates were void of markings or writing which might reveal their contents as they slide along the bomb rail, the next one taking its place over the bomb bay doors.\n\nThe air in the bomb bay could freeze the antlers off a deer, no creature would choose to willing spend time in there for fear of what else might drop off.

Beautiful patriotic chaos. Through the middle of it all marched the ranks of The Sufrits' Chosen, the most renowned regiment of the new Republican army. The sun glinting off the brass buttons of their uniforms, they cut a noble figure as the marched.

A soldier of honour, a zebra of outstanding character, Jebzel Zoblos!" A squadron of bombers flew low overhead as the crowd erupted. JEBZEL! JEBZEL! JEBZEL! They chanted. Gerza inclined his head to her as she took the stand; a strong, noble yet humble figure.\n\n"Thank you Sufrit. This is not a day to honour me, well maybe a little, but really today is for our service mares and stallions, to honour them and the sacrifices they have made to build our military to the force it is today."

TRO_CTH_government_long:0 "§GColthaginian Government§!, with little to no cartel influence"

TRO_CTH_tiger_syndicate_desc:0 "The oldest and the most dangerous of the five cartels, the Tiger Syndicate was incubated within the depths of the Zarcid era prison system, and subsequently greatly enlarged during the reign of Zarishat.\n\nThey are known for their penchant for extreme violence and have historically been prolific arms runners. They have since expanded their operations into racketeering and equine smuggling."
TRO_CTH_zaga_brothers_desc:0 "The Zaga Brotherhood are without the doubt the strangest cartel among the five. Their proliferation within the Colthaginian underworld came about as a direct result of the Zarishatian oppression of religious instituions. The Brotherhood, as a result attempts to portray itself as a sort of grassroots charismatic religious movement that just so happens to employ various hallucinogenics as a part of their rituals. Consequently, they are the largest drug smugglers in Colthage, dominating the flow of cocaine, cannabis and opium within the country and beyond."
TRO_CTH_zapsa_syndicate_desc:0 "The Zapsa Syndicate are simply a natural evolution of Colthage's already prolific history of smugglers and border merchants. If there was one word to describe the Zapsa Syndicate it would be - Neutrality. They're on good terms with their fellow Cartels and consistently try to keep their muzzles clean when it comes to government affairs. Their business model is running what amounts to a transport mega company for both legal and illegal goods. Were it not for the fact that they frequently get into shoot outs with both our and the Hippogriffian borders guards they would not even be on this list."
TRO_CTH_zurumilki_desc:0 "The Zurumilki Family are a rather peculiar sort. While criminal organizations have always existed in Colthage in some capacity they have rarely managed to amass enough raw power and influence to supplant the government. Based on a bastardized version of the Wingbardian mafia model, the "Family" are a localised federation of various racketeers, extortionists, gang leaders, legitimate businesszebras and petty robber barons who have managed to almost fully supplant the government in the Sophoovene region. They are the smallest of the Cartels territorially, but effectively the richest due to their control of the region's oil fields."
TRO_CTH_abizaal_syndicate_desc:0 "What is there to say about the Abizaal Syndicate? Their origins a mystery, their structure unknown, and their goals if they even have any completely alien - They are without a doubt the most perfidious of the five Cartels. Worse yet, they have firmly grasped the strings of Colthage's chemical industry, and have subsequently become the largest producers of synthethic drugs within the country. Unlike most of the other Cartels, they tend to shy away from violence, prefering instead to strike at their enemies from the shadows - Be that through assassination, plots or political ploys."

Everything he has gained has been down to pure personal guile and opportunism, and he wouldn't have it any other way.\n\nBorn to a middle class Coltvan landowner, Gerza spent his entire early life trying to escape the condition of his Coltvan birth. His father had tried for years to earn the respect given to any Colthaginian of his status, but he was looked down upon as nothing more than a country hick. Gerza would continue his father's objective by doing all the dirty deeds asked of him by the local Colthaginian government, eventually earning a reputation as a ruthless, and mildly competent fixer. He enrolled in a local military academy and received an officer's commission thanks to his work as a grunt, and a decently sized bribe.\n\nThe one time Gerza made use of his Coltvan heritage was when the Storm King invaded Colthage. He met up with general Zoblos and they hid in the jungles of the eastern province, committing horrid reprisals on Storm King and Coltvan rebel forces alike. Though it should be noted, he never won a battle he personally led.\n\nFollowing the liberation of Colthage, he returned to his simple fixer work in the eastern regions, until the revolt of Zeshmunazash Zeirutid. Working with the militarist forces, he helped plan the meeting that would turn into a death trap for the Coltvan rebel, which in his eyes, finally liberated him from the legacy of that jungle slum of a prefecture. However, he didn't see Zarishat coming.\n\nLeading a resistance against her regime, he managed to gather to him cartel and constitutionalist forces that he could use as a blunt weapon against the second Zeirutid sibling. Succeeding in toppling her regime, he could never have predicted the chaos that now engulfs his land. But has he always has, he'll come out on top by making a few more deals.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Egil"

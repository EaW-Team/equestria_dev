 LSP_ball_and_chain:0 "Ball & Chain"
 LSP_ball_and_chain_desc:0 "A bygone relic of the pre-independence administration, nopony is quite sure how exactly Ball and Chain ended up in function. Perhaps, at one point, he indeed was a productive member of the cabinet that deserved his position as a political advisor. Whatever his history may be, however, it's become very clear in recent times that he is drastically unfit for his role in Las Pegasusian politics. The only thing still keeping him in his office chair is the sheer bureaucratic backlog the new state must comb through before they can even hope to find the time to kick him out. Until the infernal stacks of paperwork are sorted, or the incompetent pony finds himself killed somehow, Ball and Chain is free to keep dropping coffee over important documents, picking his nostrils at inappropriate times, burp during interviews, make snide, unfunny remarks to his coworkers and drag the country down further into the dirt as he pleases."

 ###IDEAS###
 LSP_fragile_food_supply:0 "Fragile Food Supply"
 LSP_fragile_food_supply_desc:0 "Las Pegasus is a large, thriving city - which relied upon imports from the rest of Equestria to ensure it could meet its food requirements. We have substantial stockpiles, but if we don't find some solution within a few moons, famine could be on the horizon..."

 LSP_catastrophic_famine_desc:0 "Everyone is starving."
 LSP_chaotic_army:0 "Shambolic Military"
 LSP_chaotic_army_desc:0 "Much of Las Pegasus' armed forces were loyal to Celestia, and were thus expelled from the new state by loyalist forces upon the declaration of independence. Our army is currently comprised of a rough admixture of National Guard units, members of the Socialist Citizen Liberation Army, and paramilitary units from "General" Pine Chest's fanatically anticommunist and paranoid Patriotic Citizen Army. Predictably, these armies do not function very well as a cohesive unit."
 LSP_chaotic_politics:0 "Political Chaos"
 LSP_chaotic_politics_desc:0 "Las Pegasus was not prepared for independence, and now nopony is quite sure who they should listen to or who should be in charge. Harmonists agitate for re-annexation into Equestria, while the Trade Unions go on strike and the Army remains on high alert. The Mayor's authority is recognised by very few. Celestia save us..."
 LSP_chaotic_politics_2:0 "Stabilization Underway"
 LSP_chaotic_politics_2_desc:0 "The system is starting to work, but there's still a lot of uncertainty going around."
 LSP_skunkworks:0 "Lightshow Avionics Limited"
 LSP_skunkworks_desc:0 "The mysterious Mr. Horse has funded an extremely advanced aircraft program, to turn Las Pegasus into the cutting edge of aviation. While his help is much appreciated, we must be cautious that his influence doesn't grow too large."

 ###TOOLTIPS###
 
 rokenhardesc:0 "Rokenhar had always been a competent civil servant, perfectly content with the repetitive, paper-pushing routine of his daily duties. He had risen to the position of Mayor of Las Pegasus, a position that, until recently, required very few actual skills beyond being able to make the occasional public speech. The enormous, entrenched, immovable inertia of the ancient Equestrian bureaucracy took care of practically all of the actual work.\n\nUnfortunately for Rokenhar, the fat cat business interests that ruled Las Pegasus from the shadows reacted with irrational and short-sighted alarm to the Civil War. Fearing that their assets would be seized and nationalised for the war effort, or that the newly-overhauled bureaucracy would expose the mountains of corruption that they stood upon, they more or less forced Rokenhar to declare independence from Equestria.\n\nNow, surrounded by enemies within and without on every side, this tired old stallion just doesn't know what to do. How is he supposed to deal with this?"
 rokenhardesc2:0 "Nopony would have thought it possible, but Rokenhar has finally done it. Whether he had always been a political genius underneath, or whether he was merely a public face supported by a legion of more competent advisors, none can deny that Rokenhar has crushed all of his opponents and become the undisputed ruler of Las Pegasus."
 splowdesc:0 "Starry Plough has spent years struggling to protect and organise the working ponies of Las Pegasus from the rapacious capitalists that have always ruled it, with moderate success. The Princesses, monarchs though they were, at least made some efforts to help the workers, but with the secession of Las Pegasus all such efforts ceased, and now the workers have finally broken free from their bread and circuses. Finally, they hold destiny within their own hooves, and Starry Plough will guide and protect them on their journey." 
 SugarSprinkleDesc:0 "Though Starry Plough is the most famous face of the socialist movement in Las Pegasus, his efforts would have amounted to little more than sound and fury had it not been for the grassroots networks of labor unions that were built up around him. Though Sugar Sprinkle was never as charismatic as Starry Plough, she was no less zealous in the cause of the workers, but she saw that trying to rebuild society from scratch was a foolish endeavor - trying to build something whose shape you don't even know is a recipe for failure. Instead, she advocated a reformed kind of democracy that could maximise the freedom and comfort of all. Now that the Congress has elected her as leader, her moderate policies will prevail, turning Las Pegasus into a shining island of prosperity in the sea of chaos around it."
 pcadesc:0 "Pine Chest has always been something of an eccentric sort. Born in Las Pegasus, his family moved around the world constantly, from Severyana to Bales to Manehattan, even spending time in Aquileia and Wingbardy across the ocean. It was during this tumultuous youth that he came into contact with the socialist movement as well as Beakolini's fascists. One day, his father's office was firebombed by a Wingbardian communist terrorist, leaving a permanent scar on the stallion's heart.\n\nReturning home to Las Pegasus, Pine Chest became famous for getting into fights with trade unionists by the docksides, even gathering a group of like-minded followers to help him "break up the dens of treason", as he put it. At this time he had a fervent zeal for the diarchy, but when Celestia refused to go to war to prevent the secession of Stalliongrad, he had a crisis of faith, concluding that Celestia must be a crypto-communist herself.\n\nNow firmly in control of the city, Pine Chest refuses to allow Communists and Communist sympathisers to destroy his homeland the way they did his father."

 horseDesc:0 "A reclusive and mysterious figure, Trotbert Horse never appears in public, preferring to make statements through mouthpieces and newspapers. Even when he does need to speak in person, he does so through a computer screen, refusing ever to show even the possibility of a hint of weakness. Chairpony and founder of the prestigious HorseCo. computer, machine tools, and radio company, as well as the owner of a chain of successful casinos, most would not have though of Horse as a capable leader. And yet, here he is, chosen to lead the city in its hour of darkness. Behind his screen, he grins slightly. Everything is proceeding exactly as planned."
 squildesc:0 "An unassuming advisor for most of her life, Sugarquill came into the confidence of Mayor Rokenhar after she played a key role in ensuring that the city survived the radical forces that sought to destroy it. Indeed, many suspected that she was the true genius behind the near-miraculous salvation of the City. Now that the venerable Mayor has passed from this world, Sugarquill rules the city that she helped to save. No matter what happens, she will not allow all that they fought so hard for to die."
 LSP_sharps_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 18th of March, 968 in Ponydena\n\n§YBiography§!: Born to an earth pony family in Ponydena, Sharp Shot gained a love for all things boat-shaped when his family went on an outing to the San Prancisco bay when he was 10 years old. Eventually, he joined the Royal Navy and toured the seas as a junior officer and retiring at the rank of Captain. His curious and unorthodox nature got him into as much trouble as it got him out of. Afterwards, still yearning for the seas, he took up a ranking position in the Las Pegasus Harbor Patrol. When Las Pegasus declared independence it wasn't hard to find somepony to defend her coasts. He believes that trade is the lifeblood of a nation, a belief that rings especially true in Las Pegasus.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Scroup"
 LSP_cherry_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 6th of April, 978 in Hayderson\n\n§YBiography§!: Born in Hayderson, a suburb of Las Pegasus, Cherry Soda is the middle of three siblings, although her brother would be keen to point out that she's only a few minutes older than him. From a young age, Cherry took an interest in all things related to flying, be it pulp tales of ponies flying to distant worlds or eagerly following the development of airplanes. Other than that, her life was notable only for how absolutely normal it was, in every sense of the term, she was a model Equestrian pony. She likely would have continued to lead an unremarkable life were it not for the rapid destabilization of her homeland and the declaration of independence issued by Las Pegasus' mayor. Although not a military mare by trade, she joined up with the newly formed Las Pegasus army, either at the request of her brother, or of her own desire to support him. Regardless of why she joined, it quickly became apparent that she had a knack for coordinating joint land and air operations, with a solid understanding of the ins and outs of both army and airforce bureaucracy.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
 LSP_blueberry_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 6th of April, 978 in Hayderson\n\n§YBiography§!: Born in Hayderson, a suburb of Las Pegasus, Blueberry Soda is the youngest of three siblings, a fact that never sat too well with him, especially with his twin sister Cherry acting like she was the more mature one, despite being only a few minutes older. Always striving to get out of the shadow of his older sisters, Blueberry grew to have a fierce independence streak, which quickly morphed into what most ponies would call arrogance and "being a downright jackass", although he always spun it as his overwhelming self-confidence. This desire to be more independent from his family led him to join the Las Pegasus guard at 17, rising through the ranks until the outbreak of the Equestrian Civil War, at which point his sister joined up alongside him, ready to face the oncoming storm.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"

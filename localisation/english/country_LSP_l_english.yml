 LSP_ball_and_chain_desc:0 "A bygone relic of the pre-independence administration, nopony is quite sure how exactly Ball and Chain ended up in function. Perhaps, at one point, he indeed was a productive member of the cabinet that deserved his position as a political advisor. Whatever his history may be, however, it's become very clear in recent times that he is drastically unfit for his role in Las Pegasusian politics. The only thing still keeping him in his office chair is the sheer bureaucratic backlog the new state must comb through before they can even hope to find the time to kick him out. Until the infernal stacks of paperwork are sorted, or the incompetent pony finds himself killed somehow, Ball and Chain is free to keep dropping coffee over important documents, picking his nostrils at inappropriate times, burp during interviews, make snide, unfunny remarks to his coworkers and drag the country down further into the dirt as he pleases."

 ###IDEAS###
 LSP_fragile_food_supply:0 "Fragile Food Supply"
 LSP_fragile_food_supply_desc:0 "Las Pegasus is a large, thriving city - which relied upon imports from the rest of Equestria to ensure it could meet its food requirements. We have substantial stockpiles, but if we don't find some solution within a few moons, famine could be on the horizon..."

 LSP_chaotic_army:0 "Shambolic Military"
 LSP_chaotic_army_desc:0 "Much of Las Pegasus' armed forces were loyal to Celestia, and were thus expelled from the new state by loyalist forces upon the declaration of independence. Our army is currently comprised of a rough admixture of National Guard units, members of the Socialist Citizen Liberation Army, and paramilitary units from "General" Pine Chest's fanatically anticommunist and paranoid Patriotic Citizen Army. Predictably, these armies do not function very well as a cohesive unit."
 LSP_chaotic_politics:0 "Political Chaos"
 LSP_chaotic_politics_desc:0 "Las Pegasus was not prepared for independence, and now nopony is quite sure who they should listen to or who should be in charge. Harmonists agitate for re-annexation into Equestria, while the Trade Unions go on strike and the Army remains on high alert. The Mayor's authority is recognised by very few. Celestia save us..."
 LSP_skunkworks:0 "Lightshow Avionics Limited"
 LSP_skunkworks_desc:0 "The mysterious Mr. Horse has funded an extremely advanced aircraft program, to turn Las Pegasus into the cutting edge of aviation. While his help is much appreciated, we must be cautious that his influence doesn't grow too large."

 ###TOOLTIPS###
 
 rokenhardesc:0 "Rokenhar had always been a competent civil servant, perfectly content with the repetitive, paper-pushing routine of his daily duties. He had risen to the position of Mayor of Las Pegasus, a position that, until recently, required very few actual skills beyond being able to make the occasional public speech. The enormous, entrenched, immovable inertia of the ancient Equestrian bureaucracy took care of practically all of the actual work.\n\nUnfortunately for Rokenhar, the fat cat business interests that ruled Las Pegasus from the shadows reacted with irrational and short-sighted alarm to the Civil War. Fearing that their assets would be seized and nationalised for the war effort, or that the newly-overhauled bureaucracy would expose the mountains of corruption that they stood upon, they more or less forced Rokenhar to declare independence from Equestria.\n\nNow, surrounded by enemies within and without on every side, this tired old stallion just doesn't know what to do. How is he supposed to deal with this?"
 rokenhardesc2:0 "Nopony would have thought it possible, but Rokenhar has finally done it. Whether he had always been a political genius underneath, or whether he was merely a public face supported by a legion of more competent advisors, none can deny that Rokenhar has crushed all of his opponents and become the undisputed ruler of Las Pegasus."
 splowdesc:0 "Starry Plough has spent years struggling to protect and organise the working ponies of Las Pegasus from the rapacious capitalists that have always ruled it, with moderate success. The Princesses, monarchs though they were, at least made some efforts to help the workers, but with the secession of Las Pegasus all such efforts ceased, and now the workers have finally broken free from their bread and circuses. Finally, they hold destiny within their own hooves, and Starry Plough will guide and protect them on their journey." 
 SugarSprinkleDesc:0 "Though Starry Plough is the most famous face of the socialist movement in Las Pegasus, his efforts would have amounted to little more than sound and fury had it not been for the grassroots networks of labor unions that were built up around him. Though Sugar Sprinkle was never as charismatic as Starry Plough, she was no less zealous in the cause of the workers, but she saw that trying to rebuild society from scratch was a foolish endeavor - trying to build something whose shape you don't even know is a recipe for failure. Instead, she advocated a reformed kind of democracy that could maximise the freedom and comfort of all. Now that the Congress has elected her as leader, her moderate policies will prevail, turning Las Pegasus into a shining island of prosperity in the sea of chaos around it."
 pcadesc:0 "Pine Chest has always been something of an eccentric sort. Born in Las Pegasus, his family moved around the world constantly, from Severyana to Bales to Manehattan, even spending time in Aquileia and Wingbardy across the ocean. It was during this tumultuous youth that he came into contact with the socialist movement as well as Beakolini's fascists. One day, his father's office was firebombed by a Wingbardian communist terrorist, leaving a permanent scar on the stallion's heart.\n\nReturning home to Las Pegasus, Pine Chest became famous for getting into fights with trade unionists by the docksides, even gathering a group of like-minded followers to help him "break up the dens of treason", as he put it. At this time he had a fervent zeal for the diarchy, but when Celestia refused to go to war to prevent the secession of Stalliongrad, he had a crisis of faith, concluding that Celestia must be a crypto-communist herself.\n\nNow firmly in control of the city, Pine Chest refuses to allow Communists and Communist sympathisers to destroy his homeland the way they did his father."

 horseDesc:0 "A reclusive and mysterious figure, Trotbert Horse never appears in public, preferring to make statements through mouthpieces and newspapers. Even when he does need to speak in person, he does so through a computer screen, refusing ever to show even the possibility of a hint of weakness. Chairpony and founder of the prestigious HorseCo. computer, machine tools, and radio company, as well as the owner of a chain of successful casinos, most would not have though of Horse as a capable leader. And yet, here he is, chosen to lead the city in its hour of darkness. Behind his screen, he grins slightly. Everything is proceeding exactly as planned."
 squildesc:0 "An unassuming advisor for most of her life, Sugarquill came into the confidence of Mayor Rokenhar after she played a key role in ensuring that the city survived the radical forces that sought to destroy it. Indeed, many suspected that she was the true genius behind the near-miraculous salvation of the City. Now that the venerable Mayor has passed from this world, Sugarquill rules the city that she helped to save. No matter what happens, she will not allow all that they fought so hard for to die."
 LSP_sharps_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 18th of March, 968 in Ponydena\n\n§YBiography§!: Born to an earth pony family in Ponydena, Sharp Shot gained a love for all things boat-shaped when his family went on an outing to the San Prancisco bay when he was 10 years old. Eventually, he joined the Royal Navy and toured the seas as a junior officer and retiring at the rank of Captain. His curious and unorthodox nature got him into as much trouble as it got him out of. Afterwards, still yearning for the seas, he took up a ranking position in the Las Pegasus Harbor Patrol. When Las Pegasus declared independence it wasn't hard to find somepony to defend her coasts. He believes that trade is the lifeblood of a nation, a belief that rings especially true in Las Pegasus.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Scroup"
 LSP_cherry_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 6th of April, 978 in Hayderson\n\n§YBiography§!: Born in Hayderson, a suburb of Las Pegasus, Cherry Soda is the middle of three siblings, although her brother would be keen to point out that she's only a few minutes older than him. From a young age, Cherry took an interest in all things related to flying, be it pulp tales of ponies flying to distant worlds or eagerly following the development of airplanes. Other than that, her life was notable only for how absolutely normal it was, in every sense of the term, she was a model Equestrian pony. She likely would have continued to lead an unremarkable life were it not for the rapid destabilization of her homeland and the declaration of independence issued by Las Pegasus' mayor. Although not a military mare by trade, she joined up with the newly formed Las Pegasus army, either at the request of her brother, or of her own desire to support him. Regardless of why she joined, it quickly became apparent that she had a knack for coordinating joint land and air operations, with a solid understanding of the ins and outs of both army and airforce bureaucracy.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
 LSP_blueberry_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 6th of April, 978 in Hayderson\n\n§YBiography§!: Born in Hayderson, a suburb of Las Pegasus, Blueberry Soda is the youngest of three siblings, a fact that never sat too well with him, especially with his twin sister Cherry acting like she was the more mature one, despite being only a few minutes older. Always striving to get out of the shadow of his older sisters, Blueberry grew to have a fierce independence streak, which quickly morphed into what most ponies would call arrogance and "being a downright jackass", although he always spun it as his overwhelming self-confidence. This desire to be more independent from his family led him to join the Las Pegasus guard at 17, rising through the ranks until the outbreak of the Equestrian Civil War, at which point his sister joined up alongside him, ready to face the oncoming storm.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
 
 ###EVENTS###
 
 lsp_old.29.t:0 "Famine Intensifies"
 lsp_old.29.d:0 "Time to tighten our belts, eh? Oh, dear, oh, dear... \n\nThe granaries in Waffleland are getting emptier rather than fuller. The grocery stores across the city get more barren by the day. Breadmakers have to start substituting flour with horse oats, ash and sawdust, even. Shepherds are completely out of animals after they've all been slaughtered for meat. \nPonies have already begun lining up for their rations. \n\nPine Chest's extravagant meals have been replaced with whatever canned garbage one can find nowadays. Starry Plough's firebrands find themselves too weak with hunger to revolt. The independence movement rages, stronger than ever, demanding to reunite with Equestria if only to get food back. \n\nThe sound of a growling stomach is a tune well-familiar to the atmosphere of Las Pegasus now. We have to fix this."
 lsp_old.29.a:0 ""Oh, dear, oh dear.""
 lsp_old.30.t:0 "Las Pegasus Begs For Food"
 lsp_old.30.d:0 "A diplomat arrived, today. From Las Pegasus, he says. \n\nOne says 'diplomat', but the pony in question hardly looked like he could pass for a valet, or a waiter. His clothes were nice, ironed and well-kept, but his figure was frail and thin - he didn't have much meat on his bones, and that was the topic he wished to the discuss. \n\nThe State of Las Pegasus, after their secession from Equestria during the civil war, has been struggling quite a lot, particularly with the issue of food. Unsurprinsgly, an urban center of that sized can't really survive with that little arable land - so they've come to ask to get on their knees and beg for more food, lest they all starve to death."
 lsp_old.30.a:0 "We have to help them!"
 lsp_old.30.b:0 "They've brought this upon themselves."
 lsp_old.31.t:0 "Food!"
 lsp_old.31.d:0 "Sacks of grain; crates of warm, ripe peaches and apples; baskets of bread, pastries and cake; a whole container full of eggs, for these trying times; a bucketful of dirt, for some reason. That's a whole lotta food! None of it, sadly, from our harvests however - but from the charity of those nations abroad, kind enough to show us mercy in our period of darkness. Once we've climbed out of this pit of famine, we should find a way to pay them back. \n\n Or not - the food's ours now, anyways. Hooray for charity!"
 lsp_old.31.a:0 "Hip-Hip-Hoorah!"
 lsp_old.32.t:0 "A Big Bag Of Nothing"
 lsp_old.32.d:0 "Well... that was all somewhat expected. It's still disappointing, though. \n\nApparently, a bag of rice, or a sack of grain, or a single sardine was simply too much to ask from our neighbours. Curse them, and their lack of charity - once we drag ourselves out of this, we'll be just as generous to them as they were to us. Not at all!"
 lsp_old.32.a:0 "A thousand stomachs growl in rhythm."
 lsp_old.33.t:0 "Las Pegasus Offers To Trade For Food"
 lsp_old.33.d:0 "Matters in the nation of Las Pegasus don't seem to be improving. From the looks of it, their food situation grows more and more precarious by the day. Bad harvests, poor food logistics, and a lack of arable land seem to be the main culprits of their current famine. \n\nBut, what it lacks in food, the Republic of Las Pegasus makes up for in industrial power. A large industrial center pre-civil war, their economy has only grown larger and larger, and their leaders appear more than willing to trade some of that production might in turn for some of our food. Shall we trade?"
 lsp_old.33.a:0 "Accept the offer."
 lsp_old.33.b:0 "Decline, politely."
 lsp_old.34.t:0 "Food, Food and Debts!"
 lsp_old.34.d:0 "Sacks of grain; crates of warm, ripe peaches and apples; baskets of bread, pastries and cake; a whole container full of eggs, for these trying times; a bucketful of dirt, for some reason. And... a giant stack of papers to clutter up the Town Hall, intricately detailing and keeping track of every single gram and kilo of sustenance sent our way, and how much we'll have to pay for it. \n\nAt least we won't starve - but at one point or another, we'll have to pay these debts back."
 lsp_old.34.a:0 "Yay...?"
 lsp_old.37.t:0 "It's Harvesting Season"
 lsp_old.37.d:0 "After the tireless efforts of our farmers these last few moons, we have finally seen some success. Farmers throughout Waffleland have been reaping bales of golden corn, and enough food has come in to sate the hunger of many, at least for a time."
 lsp_old.37.a:0 "This takes some of the pressure off, at least."
 lsp_old.38.t:0 "A Bumper Crop!"
 lsp_old.38.d:0 "Great news! We've had an exceptionally good harvest this year! Large amounts of wheat, corn, apples, and other foodstuffs are rolling into our food banks."
 lsp_old.38.a:0 "It is desperately needed."
 lsp_old.39.t:0 "A Weak Harvest"
 lsp_old.39.d:0 "Bad news has arrived. Despite our best efforts, weather and disease have conspired against us, and our efforts at agriculture have underperformed. Though we have still gained some extra food, this will not be nearly as much as we were hoping for."
 lsp_old.39.a:0 "We'll just have to cut rations again."
 lsp_old.123.t:0 "Successful Defense"
 lsp_old.123.d:0 "Soldiers crossing our border from Las Pegasus recently tried to capture territory from us, but thankfully, our army was able to easily throw them back. The Las Pegasus foreign office is staying silent on this matter, but it has been a cause for celebration among our people, especially among the military." 
 lsp_old.123.a:0 "And don't come back!"
 lsp_old.124.t:0 "Abandon Ship"
 lsp_old.124.d:0 "Las Pegasus soldiers have been attempting to seize land from us for the last few days, and our troops have been bravely resisting. Despite this, our high command has decided that the land isn't worth the cost in lives and resources, and has withdrawn our forces from the fight." 
 lsp_old.124.a:0 "They can have that worthless trash"
 lsp_old.125.t:0 "Disaster!"
 lsp_old.125.d:0 "Awful news! The forces of Las Pegasus have been able to drive our troops from the contested territory! Las Pegasusian troops are quelling dissent in the area, and the Las Pegasus Diplomatic Office has declared this a merely "temporary occupation" to "defend the lives of the local residents"." 
 lsp_old.125.a:0 "As if anyone would believe such an obvious lie..."

Even if the conflict will not sprawl into the next decade like most civil wars tend to do, the victorious side will stand upon nothing but a pile of ashes.

 LSP_anti_fascism_desc:0 "On the alleys frequented by PCA speakers, communist agitators begin to set their soapboxes. At every far-right rally, there's always a far-left counter-protest.

Mayor Rokenhar plans to play puppet-master, to destroy the opposition in its infancy. Rather than get his hooves dirty, he can simply get them to fight each other. The PCA is infamous for its extreme views - a perfect puppet."
 LSP_anti_communism:0 "Red Scare"
 LSP_anti_communism_desc:0 "Hospitals city-wide are reporting cases of communist speakers arriving with wounds after beatings by gangs of PCA supporters wielding a wide array of contraband weaponry (wink.). The police, however, has been instructed to remain silent. With red speakers growing wary of fascist lynching, communist popularity is fading. Let us hope word of our involvement doesn't get out."
 LSP_monarchist_communist_connection:0 "Pine Chest's Conspiracy"
 LSP_monarchist_communist_connection_desc:0 "The leader of the PCA is the target of moderate critique due to his insane theories and conspiracies. Of course they are nothing but the tirades of a madman, but creating false evidence for some of them could help us in the long term. The ones claiming Celestia a communist sympathiser for her reluctance to crush Stalliongrad could become a heavy blow to both reds and monarchists."
 LSP_fatcats_news_monopoly:0 "Allies in the News"
 LSP_fatcats_news_monopoly_desc:0 "Many wealthy news labels reside within Las Pegasus, and the people benefit from a wide variety of different papers. For a sum of money, many of the owners of the newspapers would have no problem with altering the truth ever so slightly, to make sure support for Mayor Rokenhar's regime rises and sympathy for Equestria lowers."
 LSP_military_parade:0 "Allow the PCA to Rally"
 LSP_military_parade_desc:0 "Ever since their party rose to power, fascist sympathizers within the PCA have been itching to hold an organized march through the city as a show of force, to prove their better, more robust command structure compared to the communists. Allowing them to hold a rally will more than likely greatly impact red morale."
 LSP_expanded_police_powers:0 "Strengthening Our Position"
 LSP_expanded_police_powers_desc:0 "The ink on Las Pegasus' constitution is still wet, and with the situation currently so chaotic, there's nothing stopping us from expanding the powers of our most loyal asset - the Metropolitan Police Force. A few extra privileges, rights and capabilities can go a long way in securing Mayor Rokenhar's position, and also in bringing order to Las Pegasus."
 LSP_leak_location_of_cells:0 "Gentle Encouragement"
 LSP_leak_location_of_cells_desc:0 "Communists throughout the city, in the wake of harsh battles fought in Las Pegasus' darker corners, have converted several abandoned warehouses into makeshift prisons for captured PCA fighters. Unbeknownst to them, the mayor has agents and informants everywhere. Leaking the locations of these prisons to the PCA could further encourage raids and violence."
 LSP_pass_strikebreaking_law:0 "Ban Worker Strikes"
 LSP_pass_strikebreaking_law_desc:0 "In spite of all of their armaments and fiery passion, the communists' biggest weapon against Las Pegasus were strikes. Industry has ground to a standstill, and the factory overseers and PCA economists are furious. Fortunately for them, a quick footnote added to the lawbook is all we must do to ensure a strikeless future. This will not only weaken the reds, but secure support from the industrial big-leagues."
 LSP_paramilitary_brigades:0 "The Blackhooves"
 LSP_paramilitary_brigades_desc:0 "Pine Chest has been rambling for the better part of Las Pegasus' existence about the strength of his elite forces in Waffleland. His only problem was the government holding him back from establishing his long-desired paramilitary. Until now. With a subtle nod from Mayor Rokenhar, the PCA will get the go-ahead to ship in a trainful of elite soldiers for their new militia. The Blackhooves."

 LSP_battle_on_the_big_boulevard_desc:0 "With loyalist agents well-rooted in the political activities of our enemies and with the communists and PCA having grown bloated with the support we've secretly offered, tensions in Las Pegasus are reaching a boiling point. Though confrontation seems inevitable, Mayor Rokenhar has ordered the police to stand down. Loyalist blood will not be shed in the battle - our enemies shall kill each other."
 LSP_lift_ban_on_public_meetings:0 "Lift The Ban on Public Meetings"
 LSP_lift_ban_on_public_meetings_desc:0 "With the constant threat of yet another city-burning riot, the government outlawed the practice of public meetings comprised of more than three people sometime ago.

 LSP_preserve_harmony_desc:0 "Lastly, there's New Mareland. Despite being across the sea, it is still a bastion of harmony in a sea of chaos. They have remained strong, even if the rest of the world crumbled around them. We should reach out to them to talk diplomacy. And maybe a little trade."

 LSP_poke_east:0 "Storm the Fields"
 LSP_poke_east_desc:0 "The belt of Equestria is responsible for supplying the entire nation with wheat, oats, and grain in general. The communists deserve to feel the same bite of hunger that stole the lives of countless mares, stallions and foals in our fair city. They brought the famine on us, now we will return the favor.

 LSP_free_housing:0 "Free Housing for Citizens"
 LSP_free_housing_desc:0 "In order to prevent homelessness, squalor, and possible resentment from unruly masses, there will be more space cleared for free housing for all citizens of Las Pegasus. This will make sure all citizens will have a home and will ensure more of their loyalty to me."
 LSP_ring_a_ding_ding:0 "Ring a Ding Ding"
 LSP_ring_a_ding_ding_desc:0 "With peace and order established, it is time I establish Las Pegasus as the city of progress and prosperity. I will first re-establish our casinos with the gangs leading them to remind the masses of their comforts they will receive again. Then I will put my security within the city to enforce order. Finally I will make sure to calm the people themselves and reassure them that things will get better under my rule. "
 LSP_technocratic_rule:0 "Technocratic Rule"
 LSP_technocratic_rule_desc:0 "With my enemies defeated, and order restored in my city, I can now make Las Pegasus a shining beacon of progress, technology, science, and prosperity. Instead of the thuggishness of fascist rule, the radical destructiveness of communism, or broken squabbling ineffectiveness of harmonic democracy, it will be the true strength of technocracy that will reign. The intelligent elite will rule and it will be ruled by science and logic."
 LSP_scientific_management:0 "Scientific Management"
 LSP_scientific_management_desc:0 "Politicians are useless and corrupted too much by moronic ambition. Instead, we will have various scientists lead not only the various research and industrial sectors of our nation, we will also have scientists lead each province and bureau of our new city through their scientific qualifications. The new management will make sure Las Pegasus and its surrounding areas are running smoothly."
 LSP_war_on_waste:0 "The War on Waste"
 LSP_war_on_waste_desc:0 "Las Pegasus has had a history of wasting valuable resources that could be salvaged and reused in order to help my industry and economy grow. It's time I fix that through the Recycling War program which will reduce industrial and trash waste enough to help our industry a bit more."
 LSP_little_bit_of_everything:0 "A Little Bit of Everything"
 LSP_little_bit_of_everything_desc:0 "Las Pegasus needs every resource it can for progress. From the most minor scraps of metals to the largest of industrial leftovers, it must be recycled. We will maximise the use of our resources and end up getting more resource production to strengthen our economic and industrial power."
 LSP_underground_factories:0 "Underground Factories"
 LSP_underground_factories_desc:0 "Las Pegasus has limited space for industrial expansion on the ground. This problem is coupled with the vulnerability of our concentrated factories, so now I will have my company create new factories underground. These factories will keep a small amount of industry safe from bombs when war eventually hits Las Pegasus."
 LSP_highrise_houses:0 "Highrise Houses"
 LSP_highrise_houses_desc:0 "The population in Las Pegasus is crowded, with not enough homes to suit my citizens. I will have new highrise housing complexes constructed to not only encourage more migration to my city of splendor, but to showcase how glorious it is in the skylines."
 LSP_overwhelming_force:0 "Overwhelming Force"
 LSP_overwhelming_force_desc:0 "My army must rely upon overwhelming firepower to win the day. War is not fought by merely plans or bodies, but by the best and most powerful weaponry to face the earth. It's time my army is reflected by that doctrine and will focus on pummeling my enemies with technological power."
 LSP_finest_of_weapons:0 "The Finest of Weapons"
 LSP_finest_of_weapons_desc:0 "My scientists will study to make the most advanced of rifles, artillery, and magical equipment possible. My infantry will become the most advanced and well equipped of all Equus and make every other savage bend the knee to me."
 LSP_streamline_production:0 "Streamlining the Production"
 LSP_streamline_production_desc:0 "The production line should also be streamlined in order to produce as much weapons as possible to supply the ever growing army in my nation. The more efficient the production is, the more guns in possession."
 LSP_preservation_of_manpower:0 "Preserve Ponypower"
 LSP_preservation_of_manpower_desc:0 "I cannot afford to lose a lot of troops in any war I am in. With the issue of ponypower at hoof for Las Pegasus, I will make sure to invest much research into support companies that can prevent as much permanent casualties as possible."
 LSP_more_conscription:0 "More Conscription"
 LSP_more_conscription_desc:0 "It's time to conscript more troops. I need as many able-bodied ponies as possible to fill the ranks in my army. There will plenty of wars to fight and the more troops I have, the more progress will win and succeed."
 LSP_army_of_the_future:0 "An Army of the Future"
 LSP_army_of_the_future_desc:0 "The future of warfare lies with machines. Once I invest in tanks and motorized vehicles for my army to use, I will be able to fight fast, powerful, and hard as my enemies will be cut off, disorganized, and broken. Speed and power win wars, not just strength anymore."
 LSP_armored_core:0 "An Armored Core"
 LSP_armored_core_desc:0 "In order for my mechanzied army to succeed. I will make sure my army will have an armored core of tanks that will be able to smash through enemy lines to enrcircle divisions with lightning speed. Horseco will be developing the newest and best of tanks to strengthen my army. "
 LSP_armor_assembly_lines:0 "Armor Assembly Lines"
 LSP_armor_assembly_lines_desc:0 "My army needs as much tanks and motor vehicles completed as possible. Horseco will be leading Las Pegasus in tank and motor vehicle production and make sure our armored divisions will be in full strength in preparation for war."

 LSP_only_the_finest:0 "Only the Finest"
 LSP_only_the_finest_desc:0 "My army should not just allow anyone to fight in it. I need the best and finest of ponies that can drive my machines and fight with fury against the enemies of progress. Conscription standards must be raised to accomodate that fury."
 LSP_into_the_world:0 "Into the World"
 LSP_into_the_world_desc:0 "It's time that Las Pegasus expands into the world. The dream of a technocratic utopia will begin with these wars. I will first start with taking over the border states belonging to our regressive enemies."
 LSP_the_fate_of_democracies:0 "The Fate of Democracies"
 LSP_the_fate_of_democracies_desc:0 "As it is seen through the window, Democracies are inefficient failures that will collapse in any sign of strife. The southern confederacy is no exception, if anything, a bigger insult as they hold onto pathetic traditions to impede progress. It's time to bring these yokels into the future."
 LSP_a_primitive_relic:0 "A Primitive Relic"
 LSP_a_primitive_relic_desc:0 "The biggest disgrace and most primitive of animals. The buffalo for too long have been suffering from the denial of progress, refusing to adapt and to move forward past their savage tribal ways. It's time we subjugate them and civilize these creatures."
 LSP_two_dogs_fighting_over_a_bone:0 "Two Dogs Fighting Over a Bone"
 LSP_two_dogs_fighting_over_a_bone_desc:0 "Both Lunarist and Solarist fools are fighting over scraps, a wartorn jungle with little prospect without the guiding hooves of a true visionary. It's time to end their destructive and childish war and bring peace to the South East."
 LSP_a_petty_minded_fool:0 "A Petty-Minded Fool"
 LSP_a_petty_minded_fool_desc:0 "Dr. Caballeron is such a petty-minded fool. He has little vision outside of his savage jungle that he pretends he belongs in and thinks he is a part of in his delusions. It's time to end his little archaelogical experiment and bring Aztlan under my control to modernize it."
 LSP_bulging_eyed_fanatics:0 "Bulging Eyed Fanatics"
 LSP_bulging_eyed_fanatics_desc:0 "Anarchists, communists, they are both the same. Just ignorant spoiled children thinking they know what it takes to run an economy, to create their tiny vision for the subjugated city of a once great Baltimare. It's time to bring civilization back to Baltimare and adults back to work."
 LSP_all_or_nothing:0 "All Or Nothing"
 LSP_all_or_nothing_desc:0 "This is the final moment. The endgame as some would call it. Equestria is the biggest obstacle to my vision for a land ruled by science instead of irrationality, instead of the nonsense of harmony and peace. It's time to fight and win and be the harbinger of progress, or die trying."
 LSP_outlived_her_usefulness:0 "Outlived Her Usefulness"
 LSP_outlived_her_usefulness_desc:0 "Despite the moronic militarism of the Changelings, they helped many Equestrians wake up to the failures of harmony, made them change, and helped distract them from putting their attention on me. They aren't useful to me anymore though so the Changelings must be squashed too like the insects they are."
 LSP_a_useless_experiment:0 "A Useless Experiment"
 LSP_a_useless_experiment_desc:0 "One of the most useless and fruitless experiments ever created by hoof, the ideology of Marks claimed to be the savior of the poor but in the end, that ideology only kept them ignorant and backwards. It's time to liberate Stalliongrad for the sake of progress and upwards mobility."
 LSP_ten_years_you_wont_recognise_equestria:0 "Ten Years, You Won't Recognize Equestria"
 LSP_ten_years_you_wont_recognise_equestria_desc:0 "The entire war is over. We have won. Harmony has died, Communism has died, and Fascism has died. It's time for the age of Technocracy to begin. The lands of Equus will be known as land of true progress and prosperity for all ponykind. It will be the epitome of civilization for all the world to know."
 LSP_subdue_the_pca:0 "Subdue the PCA"
 LSP_subdue_the_pca_desc:0 "WIth the use of these pointlessly brutish thugs having ended, it is time that this toxic faction gets put down for good. Their toxic ideology could possible ruin my plans for Las Pegasus and prevent progress for the city. We will hit every single part of the organization. From head, to toe. "
 LSP_disappear_pinechest:0 "Make Pine Chest Disappear"
 LSP_disappear_pinechest_desc:0 "Pine Chest is one of the most important figures for the PCA. His leadership keeps the organization together and in capable direction that can oppose my will of progress. I will make sure my agents make him disappear in order for the snake to become headless."
 LSP_infiltrate_lower_ranks:0 "Infiltrate the Lower Ranks"
 LSP_infiltrate_lower_ranks_desc:0 "Some more of my agents will be sent out to infiltrate the PCA paramilitary brigades. My infilitrators will be able to cause chaos and break up each of these brigades through subterfuge and sowing divisions. The breaking of the lower ranks will make sure the organization is weaker."
 LSP_dirty_laundry:0 "Dirty Laundry"
 LSP_dirty_laundry_desc:0 "The PCA loves to tout itself as an organization fighting for the moral core of Las Pegasus. Ha! That's a sad lie. I will make sure to showcase all the atorcious actions the PCA did and make sure the public knows how hypocritcal they are in their "patriotism". We have enough dirty laundry for their support to evaporate."
 LSP_threat_contained:0 "The Threat Contained"
 LSP_threat_contained_desc:0 "Pine Chest is gone, the PCA lower ranks is in chaos, and public support for the PCA has evaporated. Overall, I have succeeded in dismantling the PCA and leaving it in shambles and disarray. With the threat of the PCA gone, the people can finally start focusing on my vision that I have for Las Pegasus for its progress."
 LSP_the_mayor_triumphant:0 "Peace At Last"
 LSP_the_mayor_triumphant_desc:0 "Will an ear to the streets of Las Pegasus. Relish in the silence. No incessant communist prattling. No PCA screaming of a fake state. No monarchists begging for a crown. No gunshots as the police fights looters and loose criminals. No chaos, no more. Peace, at last, has come to Las Pegasus. Mayor Rokenhar has won."
 LSP_fire_ball_and_chain:0 "Fire Ball and Chain"
 LSP_fire_ball_and_chain_desc:0 "Alright, no more dawdling - now that we've brought some semblance of stability to the country, it's time we begun picking up the pieces. Our bureaucracy is, to say the least, bloated and inefficient. We've some pruning to do, put old politicians out to pasture, recalibrate the entire government to suit independence. And get rid of that damned Ball and Chain."
 LSP_address_the_food_issue:0 "The Food Issue"
 LSP_address_the_food_issue_desc:0 "One of the biggest issues of our independence is self-sustainability. We are a very populous nation in relation to the amount of arable land at our disposal. We didn't have time to stockpile food before we seceded, and with all commerce having to pass through Equestria... we need to find a solution before Las Pegasus starves to death."
 LSP_establish_trade_relations:0 "Trade Relations"
 LSP_establish_trade_relations_desc:0 "This should take out two birds with one stone - by establishing trade relations with other nations, we also place Las Pegasus on the world stage as a sovereign state. Emissaries were sent all over the continent - Olenia, the Changelings, the Yaks, Stalliongrad and even Equestria - though we don't know how much to expect from them."
 LSP_encourage_farming_in_waffleland:0 "Encourage Farming"
 LSP_encourage_farming_in_waffleland_desc:0 "Waffleland is not nearly as urbanized as Las Pegasus to the north, and that may be exactly what we need to combat the issue of food. Constructing irrigation systems and encouraging agriculture in the region will relieve a huge strain off of the country's food intake."
 LSP_ask_for_charity:0 "Asking for Help"
 LSP_ask_for_charity_desc:0 "However humiliating it may be, Las Pegasus cannot survive without the help of its neighbours. With rations growing more and more meagre by the day, and with the hungry populace starting to look across the border fence to the giant Equestrian food stores, it's time we sent out emissaries requesting help."
 LSP_high_yield_crops:0 "No More Grapes"
 LSP_high_yield_crops_desc:0 "To survive the food crisis, we must make the best out of our situation, by maximizing the amount of efficiency extracted from our limited soil. Areas like viticulture, fruticulture and pasturing are not at all efficient in relation to the amount of space they take up, so we must refocus on planting high-yield plants like grain and maize."
 LSP_safe_from_famine:0 "Safe From Famine"
 LSP_safe_from_famine_desc:0 "All our efforts are finally paying off. Food yield is in the green - we're producing more than we're consuming. Granted, only barely more than we're consuming, but as time goes on, yield will slowly rise. Yet another crisis has been averted, and for the first time in a long time, ponies of Las Pegasus can enjoy full, unrationed meals."
 LSP_restore_order:0 "The Restoration Of Order"
 LSP_restore_order_desc:0 "Enough mucking about. With the political situation stabilized and the food issue sorted out, it's time Mayor Rokenhar put his hoof down. We've braved the worst of the storm, and we're finally ready to reap the rewards of our determination. Rejoining Equestria is an idea of the past. Las Pegasus can finally stand on its own legs. Order, at last."
 LSP_seize_assets:0 "Punish the Opportunists"
 LSP_seize_assets_desc:0 "In the chaos of secession, several corporations believed the government would collapse and, therefore, they instead decided to support more radical opposition fronts. It's about time we got back at them, and made sure to establish a loyal industrial base. This can also be a great opportunity to seize the assets of some unsavory ponies, such as Pine Chest."
 LSP_clean_up_harmonists:0 "Deal With the Harmonists"
 LSP_clean_up_harmonists_desc:0 "With the thoughts of reunification having left the minds of most citizens, we can finally pinpoint our efforts on stomping out any last, stubborn anti-independence movement. Offer amnesty to those who agree to stand down, and prepare the court for treason charges against those who remain adamantly pro-Equestrian."
 LSP_increased_police_presence:0 "Call the National Guard"
 LSP_increased_police_presence_desc:0 "A cursory look at the streets of Las Pegasus is enough to show that crime is not dying down at pace we had hoped for. The police department is still struggling to cope with the wave of criminals from the days of anarchy, so we must call for backup, in the form of the National Guard, until criminal activities lower."
 LSP_the_mayors_las_pegasus:0 "The Mayor's Las Pegasus"
 LSP_the_mayors_las_pegasus_desc:0 "The last anarchic cells have surrendered. Protests are finally a rarity. The value of the currency is rising, and the amount of "down with the government!" graffiti has declined drastically. Every pressing issue that plagued the city at the onset of independence has been dealt with, and finally, Mayor Rokenhar can have a breath of peace."
 LSP_military_rebuilding:0 "Reorganising the Army"
 LSP_military_rebuilding_desc:0 "It's about time we looked at our armed forces. The army has been largely neglected. It was always a "we'll fix it later" issue - but later is now, and Las Pegasus can wait no longer. We are threatened by Equestria on the daily, and it's about time we established a proper, professional army for our defense."
 LSP_destroy_CLA_influence:0 "Integrate the Communists"
 LSP_destroy_CLA_influence_desc:0 "Though they tried to destroy our government, the CLA is still a political party in our government, and it'd be tyrannical to end them. So, if you can't beat them, make them join you. By enrolling the reds, we'll be making sure they remain under our constant supervision. And, if there's ever a war, at least they'll be the ones to die first." 
 LSP_destroy_PCA_influence:0 "Integrate the Fascists"
 LSP_destroy_PCA_influence_desc:0 "Though they tried to destroy our government, the PCA is still a political party in our government, and it'd be tyrannical to end them. So, if you can't beat them, make them join you. By enrolling the fascists, we'll be making sure they remain under our constant supervision. And, if there's ever a war, at least they'll be the ones to die first."
 LSP_expand_national_guard:0 "Expand the National Guard"
 LSP_expand_national_guard_desc:0 "As the needs of our police force rise steadily with our growing prosperity and our growing criminal underworld, the National Guard has made multiple requests for extra personnel. It's about time we answered those requests and offered our boys some well-deserved help."
 LSP_restore_officer_corp:0 "Restore the Officer Corps"
 LSP_restore_officer_corp_desc:0 "Even after the political chaos that plagued Las Pegasus for so long, there's still a multitude of skilled officers ready to offer their services. A few extra medals and some adequately-oversized cigars later, they almost look the part."
 LSP_the_army_of_las_pegasus:0 "The New Army"
 LSP_the_army_of_las_pegasus_desc:0 "Soldiers, check. Guns, check. Generals, check. A lack of inner strife, check-check. We have all the ingredients to begin proper work on our armed forces. As the sun sets over Equestria, in the bronze light of dusk, the new army of Las Pegasus stands strong, proud, and ready to serve."
 LSP_global_las_pegasus:0 "Global Las Pegasus"
 LSP_global_las_pegasus_desc:0 "We've already established formal relations with other nations through our earlier trade agreements back during the famine, but it's about time we've stepped up our game. It's time to push Las Pegasus out onto the world stage, in all its revitalized, rebuilt glory."
 LSP_collaborate_SCS:0 "Collaborate with the South"
 LSP_collaborate_SCS_desc:0 "The Southern Confederate States are in a pickle much like ours - whereas we were the ones to abandon the Canterlot government, they were abandoned by said government, therefore they seceded. As two nations born of the same bloated empire, we are sisters of the south, and we should work to improve relations and establish an alliance. "
 LSP_encourage_southern_migration:0 "Encourage Southern Migration"
 LSP_encourage_southern_migration_desc:0 "We have all that the south needs, and the south has all that we need - we have a thriving economy and infrastructure, they have the population to supply them. Encouraging migration into Waffleland would provide jobs for southerners, and extra ponypower for Las Pegasus."
 LSP_southern_army_influence:0 "Southern Military Training"
 LSP_southern_army_influence_desc:0 "The south has seen confrontation with Equestria far more fierce than we have. They have experience which Las Pegasus deeply lacks and knowledge of modern warfare that we need if we don't want to fall behind militarily-speaking. We should work to learn from them, to incorporate some southern tactics into the Las Pegasus army."
 LSP_mutual_resources:0 "Resource-Sharing"
 LSP_mutual_resources_desc:0 "Both of our nations have something that the other craves - the south has its vast fields of black gold, and Las Pegasus has its mighty working steel mills. Offering some of our resources to the other would be a great way to further intertwine our economies, and to greatly improve relations." 
 LSP_the_desert_rangers:0 "The Desert Rangers"
 LSP_the_desert_rangers_desc:0 "The southern gunslinger rangers are renowned for their battle-prowess and fierceness. Convincing the S.C.S. to offer us a few battalions would be a great boost for Las Pegasus' army."
 LSP_second_republic_of_the_greater_confederation:0 "The Second Republic"
 LSP_second_republic_of_the_greater_confederation_desc:0 "After such strides towards friendship, mutual understanding, and military assistance, it's about time we've established even closer relations with the S.C.S., by declaring Las Pegasus to the be the first addition to the Confederation. We will remain sovereign, but we will be closer politically, economically and militarily than ever."
 LSP_staunch_defiance:0 "Staunchly Defiant"
 LSP_staunch_defiance_desc:0 "Las Pegasus doesn't need allies - all of our strength, our might, we've acquired facing all hardships alone. We are ready to finally stand on our own hooves, separate from any other power, ruled by a single will, governed by a single destiny. Las Pegasus stands alone, determined and ready. A rock of stability in a sea of chaos."
 LSP_defensive_mindset:0 "A Defensive Mindset"
 LSP_defensive_mindset_desc:0 "Las Pegasus, though strong, is dwarfed in size and population by its neighbours. We simply do not have the raw ponypower and resources needed to wage offensive warfare. Therefore, we will let our enemies come to us. Dig in. Prepare. Fight. And win. Let their blood fertilize our fields."
 LSP_the_lsp_rangers:0 "The Las Pegasus Rangers"
 LSP_the_lsp_rangers_desc:0 "Some officers of the National Guard and other facets of the military have shown a kind of ferocity, combat-excellence and superiority on the field that could match even Equestria's famed rangers. It's about time we established our own Ranger Corps. "
 LSP_creep_north:0 "Creep North"
 LSP_creep_north_desc:0 "Las Pegasus needs room to breathe. Though we arguably have room southwards into Waffleland, the city hugs the northern border uneasily. It's about time we stretched out a little."
 LSP_creep_south:0 "Creep South"
 LSP_creep_south_desc:0 "Much of Waffleland is dominated by agriculture to fuel the main city, but even now, the food situation is unsteady at best. The lands south are vast and fertile, and could provide great opportunities for more food."
 LSP_consolidate_our_grip:0 "Consolidate Our Grip"
 LSP_consolidate_our_grip_desc:0 "It's time to hang up the hatchet. We've carved the territory we need out of our neighbours, now the question is all about integrating it into Las Pegasus proper."
 LSP_collaborate_EQS:0 "Collaborate With Equestria"
 LSP_collaborate_EQS_desc:0 "We've had our ups and downs, yes, but Equestria is still our largest and arguably strongest neighbour. Perhaps it would be wisest for us to take back some of the less savory accusations we've made on the onset of independence and try to repair our relationship, ask for an alliance, and pray that they don't bomb the Tartarus out of us."
 LSP_equestrian_science_is_the_greatest_in_the_world:0 "Equestrian Science Collaboration"
 LSP_equestrian_science_is_the_greatest_in_the_world_desc:0 "While Las Pegasus is quite advanced, it still doesn't hold a candle to Equestria's sprawling research infrastructure. Patching into that network of universities, laboratories and research centers would boost the country's scientific base significantly."
 LSP_normalise_immigration:0 "Normalise Immigration"
 LSP_normalise_immigration_desc:0 "The enormous border fence between us and Equestria has been an eyesore ever since it was cobbled together on the onset of independence. It's about time we took it down, and established a more amiable, less hostile relationship with our neighbour in regards the immigration."
 LSP_request_investment:0 "Request Investments"
 LSP_request_investment_desc:0 "Though ravaged by civil war, the Equestrian economy is still flowering. Certainly they have a little bit of spare profit to invest into Las Pegasus. After all, a few bit of investments could go a long way, and can only work to further bridge the gap between us. Not to mention, you know, money."
 LSP_the_equestrian_rangers:0 "The Equestrian Rangers"
 LSP_the_equestrian_rangers_desc:0 "We have the National Guard, yes, but few soldiers can stand up against the famed Equestrian Rangers. Battlehardened from combat, they will make a fine addition to Las Pegasus' army, and Equestria would likely not mind having a tiny foothold of influence in Las Pegasus' army."
 LSP_request_recognition:0 "Request Recognition"
 LSP_request_recognition_desc:0 "We've come a long way, Equestria and Las Pegasus. From enemies, back to friends through circumstance. The wish to reunite is long gone, but that doesn't mean there should be any animosity between us. It's time to bury the hatchet - it's time to request recognition from our mother-nation."
 LSP_house_of_cards:0 "Reinforcing the House of Cards"
 LSP_house_of_cards_desc:0 "Though Las Pegasus is at last strong and stable, Mayor Rokenhar will not live long to see it. All of the chaos, the stress - it's taken a toll on the old pony. The days drag on, harder and harder, and it won't be long before he takes his last breath. Time is short. Las Pegasus was his dream, and he's all that holds the city together. Las Pegasus dies with Mayor Rokenhar. That cannot be allowed."
 LSP_post_military:0 "Ensure a Standing Army"
 LSP_post_military_desc:0 "The foundation of a strong military is set in place, though the troops are still green, and the officer core is still questionable. It's time to clean house - remove the corrupt officers, the incompetent generals, all of the consequences of earlier cronyism. Ensure Las Pegasus has a safe future."
 LSP_root_out_corruption:0 "Root Out Corruption"
 LSP_root_out_corruption_desc:0 "Much of Las Pegasus' army is comprised of ponies not particularly skilled, but which Rokenhar could trust at the time of its creation. Now that the threat of conflict is largely gone, we can afford a more diverse, and thus less corrupt, government. It's about time we've performed a general audit of the army's higher-ups - see who stays and who's got to go."
 LSP_dont_fight_for_me:0 "Fight for the City"
 LSP_dont_fight_for_me_desc:0 "We've been left with a strong core of competent, fiercely loyal officers. The only problem is who they are fiercely loyal to - Mayor Rokenhar. Once he leaves, the army will crumble back into corruption and croynism. We need to finally bring something to Las Pegasus - patriotism. Teach the soldiers to fight not for Mr. Rokenhar, but for the city. For the country. For its people. For Las Pegasus."
 LSP_post_industry:0 "Industrial Reform"
 LSP_post_industry_desc:0 "Las Pegasus is already a highly-urbanized and well-industrialized area, but that doesn't mean there's no room for improvement. Ensuring the people and entrepreneurs that the government hasn't forgotten about the economy will help the people have more faith in the market - and will give us more assets to work with, in the long term."
 LSP_fairer_taxation:0 "Fairer Taxation"
 LSP_fairer_taxation_desc:0 "It's about time we handled that issue. Yes, that issue. The big elephant in the room and the even bigger mountain of papers in the Ministry of Finance - taxation. Las Pegasus works on an Equestrian system which is ludicrously, almost comically unsuited for independence. Giving it a good overhaul will lead to overall fairer taxation, and thus a happier populace."
 LSP_reach_out_to_unions:0 "Reach out to the Unions"
 LSP_reach_out_to_unions_desc:0 "Though the communists were defeated, they still have a strong support base with the workers, unsurprisingly. Reaching out to them with promises of better worker conditions and pay could generously bridge the gap between them and the government, and finally disarm the ticking time-bomb attached to the economy that the trade unions have been."
 LSP_post_law:0 "Lay Down the Law"
 LSP_post_law_desc:0 "Though the police has been growing more and more efficient in handling the country's issues lately, it's still following a very crude, decentralized system of laws. Concentrating and assembling an easy-to-follow, strict-yet-fair law code will lift another stone off the country's back."
 LSP_actual_constitution:0 "An Actual Constitution"
 LSP_actual_constitution_desc:0 "Right now, Las Pegasus' "constitution" looks more like a school scrapbook than a government lawbook - full of scratches, footnotes, ink marks, parentheses and contraditions. Reforming it into a more concise book of fundamental laws and obligations for both the government and the population has been long overdue."
 LSP_proper_police:0 "Proper Police"
 LSP_proper_police_desc:0 "The Las Pegasus Metropolitan Police has served us well so far, but their days have finally come to an end. With a new constitution, independence, and a new law-code, it's time to throw out the old and bring out the new. The National Affairs Bureau - NAB. Coined by Rokenhar himself."
 LSP_post_heir:0 "Dark Times Ahead"
 LSP_post_heir_desc:0 "Las Pegasus can be as stable as Rokenhar can bring himself to make it - but if there's nobody to pick up the mantle after his death, all of that progress, that stability, that effort, will go to waste. Las Pegasus must not be allowed to fall into chaos again. In these uncertain times, an election is out of the question. We must find a suitable, competent heir."
 LSP_appoint_heir:0 "Appoint an Heir"
 LSP_appoint_heir_desc:0 "We have a lot of options to choose from. Everyone is eager to wield the reins of power, but there are only a few who are worthy. The more trustworthy civil servants are already combing through files and reports, and every possible candidate for the next mayor position goes through Rokenhar, first. Of course we're not going to call them "heir" - that'd put the monarchists in way too big a tizzy."
 LSP_ensure_smooth_succession:0 "Ensure a Smooth Succession"
 LSP_ensure_smooth_succession_desc:0 "We've found a good heir - loyal, fierce, and ready for the challenges Las Pegasus must face ahead. Now, we just need to make sure the people support them, and that they'll survive in the dog-eat-dog government. Thankfully, Mayor Rokenhar still has favours to cash in, and contacts he can call up, to ensure succession will be smooth, bloodless, and dramaless."
 LSP_post_personal:0 "Loose Ends"
 LSP_post_personal_desc:0 "Mayor Rokenhar has kept a family picture on his nighstand since Las Pegasus gained independence. For so long, the city has been his life. He's tried his best not to forget his family, his wife and son. But he never found time to return to them, with the city matters being so pressing. Now, in the twilight of his life, he can postpone them no longer. This may be his last chance to see them again."
 LSP_visit_family:0 "A Call To the Past"
 LSP_visit_family_desc:0 "He's been sending them letters, hoping for a reply. A message, a sign of life, anything. He's sent a new letter every single day, without a single sign. Until today. 'We miss you.' followed an address. At last, the passage of time seems less dreadful."
 LSP_bucket_list:0 "The Swan Song"
 LSP_bucket_list_desc:0 "There's a lot of things he wanted to try out, at one point. Gardening, for one. Or, well, learning to grow plants. Learning to play golf. Taking a trip to the Pinglands, at one point. The more the days wear on, the longer the list seems. Maybe he should tick off some of the items - make sure he leaves behind a legacy worth more than the city."
 LSP_expand_the_army:0 "Expand the Army"
 LSP_expand_the_army_desc:0 "After a cursory look, it's become very obvious that more ponies are needed to fill the ranks. A hoofful of recruits per trench won't do - we need artillerymen, snipers, shock-troops, riflemen, gunners, tankers. We have a long road ahead - but the journey from Las Pegasus to Canterlot begins with a single step."
 LSP_mayor_sup_fire:0 "Bomb the Tartarus Out of Them"
 LSP_mayor_sup_fire_desc:0 "Las Pegasus doesn't have the ponypower for heroic charges or grand tsunamis of soldiers crashing into enemy lines as seen in action movies. Our soldiers' lives are precious -  shells, however, are cheap. Why fight, when we can just bombard our enemy to smithereens?"
 LSP_shell_assembly_lines:0 "Shell Assembly Lines"
 LSP_shell_assembly_lines_desc:0 "We can't bombard our enemies with spit and rocks - if we want our artillery to do more damage than a light spring rain, we have to make sure we have the shells to fire. Investing in more adquate production lines for artillery pieces will make sure a lack of armament will not be an issue."
 LSP_thunder_bringer_battalion:0 "Bigger Gun, Better Performance"
 LSP_thunder_bringer_battalion_desc:0 "While Las Pegasus' artillery pieces are nothing to turn one's muzzle up at, it's wise to make sure we don't fall behind in the arms race. "Don't fix what ain't broke", as the old saying goes - but nothing stops us from improving our existing artillery."
 LSP_artillery_factories:0 "Artillery Factories"
 LSP_artillery_factories_desc:0 "As the army grows, the need for more artillery pieces to support our soldiers becomes apparent. Rather than putting undue strain on our other production centers, it'd be wiser to dedicate a whole new manufacturing sector for armament production."
 LSP_at_ap:0 "Eyes on the Sky"
 LSP_at_ap_desc:0 "We have big guns, yes - that's very good. But, those big guns are also immobile, and would be very easily targeted and destroyed by bombers or fast-moving tanks. Therefore, we should make sure that we don't leave them exposed by giving some attention to our anti-tank and anti-air capabilities."
 LSP_enhanced_rifles:0 "Improved Rifles"
 LSP_enhanced_rifles_desc:0 "As important as artillery is, it's still important that the soldier is ready and well-equipped. After all, the fire pieces only exist to soften up the enemy that the infantry must then fight - so we should make sure that said infantry only has access to the best weapons."
 LSP_not_one_wasted_life:0 "Not One Wasted Life"
 LSP_not_one_wasted_life_desc:0 "With our limited ponypower, it only makes sense that we make sure none of it goes to waste. Our soldiers should have access to the same care in the field that civilians get in the city, and that means mobile hospitals, field kitchens, intensive care units, better medicine - anything for the fighting pony."
 LSP_mayor_mob_war:0 "Outmaneuver the Tartarus Out of Them"
 LSP_mayor_mob_war_desc:0 "Las Pegasus doesn't have the ponypower to fight a drawn-out war of attrition, to let the days on the calendar drag on. In warfare, time is not on the smaller nation's side. If we are to win, we must make sure victory would be swift, unchallengeable, and uncounterable. We must strike fast, kill fast, and win fast."
 LSP_we_need_tanks:0 "Armoured Spearhead"
 LSP_we_need_tanks_desc:0 "Strength, firepower, and raw armoured might. The tank makes or breaks a mobile army, and we must make sure that our own armour is the best of the best, the strongest of the strongest, if we want to survive. Our tanks will punch a hole into the enemy lines that our infantry will then exploit."
 LSP_motorised_and_mechanised:0 "Motorised Spine"
 LSP_motorised_and_mechanised_desc:0 "If the armour is the tip of the spearhead, the motorized brigades will be the hilt and spine. Once the tanks break a hole in the enemy defenses, our motorized and mechanised divisions will rush through and exploit the defensive gap, and crush our enemies before they even have a chance of fighting back."
 LSP_armor_factories:0 "Armour Factories"
 LSP_armor_factories_desc:0 "Tanks, half-tracks, and trucks are useful, but costly to build. If we want adequate production numbers, we have to make sure a decent portion of our industry focuses on supplying the front lines with the needed equipment."
 LSP_and_planes_too:0 "Strike From the Heavens"
 LSP_and_planes_too_desc:0 "We cannot simply rely on our ground forces for a breakthrough. If we want to rule the battlefield, we must focus on ruling the skies above it, first. Aerial supremacy must not be ignored, and we must make sure our fighters, bombers and CAS are among the best if we don't want the spear to crumble against the defense."
 LSP_you_will_use_mechanised_dammit:0 "Armoured Reliance"
 LSP_you_will_use_mechanised_dammit_desc:0 "The average soldier can only take so many bullets - which is not many at all. Armoured cars, however, are faster, stronger and more defensible than ponies. Introducing them to our field operations will only increase success rate on the battlefield."
 LSP_make_everything_cheaper:0 "Overhauled Production Methods"
 LSP_make_everything_cheaper_desc:0 "The dusty, hard-hooved workers on the manufacturing front have become expert craftsponies in the field of armour-production. Utilizing recent breakthroughs in factory efficiency, combined with new workman-expertise will only mean cheaper, more reliable armoured fighting vehicles for Las Pegasus."
 LSP_mayor_battleplan:0 "Outsmart the Tartarus Out of Them"
 LSP_mayor_battleplan_desc:0 "War is more than a soldier sitting in a foxhole. War is maps, plans, production numbers, lists and logistics. The generals, officers and captains are just as important as the soldiers themselves, and victory will best be achieved not through mindless fighting, but through tactful planning."
 LSP_gbp_path_gotta_have_engineers:0 "The Engineer Corps"
 LSP_gbp_path_gotta_have_engineers_desc:0 "The engineers stand as the new foundation of modern warfare - they dig the trenches the rifleponies wait in, they lay the minefields the rifleponies defend, they set up the artillery that supports the riflemen. They are the cornerstone of every plan, and a weak engineer core means a weak army."
 LSP_spawn_more_horses:0 "A Stronger Guard"
 LSP_spawn_more_horses_desc:0 "The National Guard are some of the most elite units Las Pegasus has to offer - strong, determined, courageous and loyal. Making sure that our army is an elite one should be a top priority, and strengthening the National Guard will, in turn, strengthen our army."
 LSP_cement_factories:0 "Cement Factories"
 LSP_cement_factories_desc:0 "Cement is the material of warfare. Lead builds bullets, steel builds tanks, aluminum builds planes... but cement builds bunkers, trenches, defense strongpoints. If we let our enemies come to us, we should be ready to give them a cold, concrete welcome."
 LSP_elite_weaponry:0 "Elite Weaponry"
 LSP_elite_weaponry_desc:0 "We are ponies - magic flows through our blood, our flesh, our muscles. Our magic is not just a crutch, a novelty, though. It's our biggest, strongest weapon. We must hone our skills with this weapon if we want victory."
 LSP_magic:0 "Magesoldiers"
 Lsp_magic_desc:0 "There is a thin line between warfare and wizardry. Our pegasi can rule the skies in place of planes, our earth ponies can charge forward in place of motorized, our unicorns can blast enemies away with all of the might of artillery. We have all of the ingredients for an army of wizards - we must only combine them."
 LSP_every_family_a_soldier:0 "Every Family a Soldier"
 LSP_every_family_a_soldier_desc:0 "We are surrounded by enemies. We are surrounded by nations jealous of Las Pegasus' wealth, power, and beauty. We are a lone rock in the churning sea of violence. To survive, we must fight. To survive, all must play their part - and there exists no part to play more honourable than service."
 
 ##ECONOMY FOCUSES##
 LSP_autarky_economy:0 "Self-Sufficiency"
 LSP_autarky_economy_desc:0 "Surrounded by enemies, we are in no position to make demands. If Las Pegasus was to look outwards for economic benefit, it would find itself on the short end of the proverbial stick. Therefore, it must not look beyond its borders, but within. We are a nation of many virtues. Self-sufficiency is not a choice, but a necessity. The autarkic way is the way to go."
 LSP_expand_steel_industry:0 "The Steel Industry"
 LSP_expand_steel_industry_desc:0 "Steel is the backbone of a modern nation. Its uses range from civilian construction to military affairs, and one can never have enough of it. Ensuring that Las Pegasus has a steady supply of steel means ensuring resource independence in the long run."
 LSP_autarky_civs_1:0 "Encourage Civilian Industry"
 LSP_autarky_civs_1_desc:0 "The government alone should not be the one pushing for industrial growth. Private industry and entrepeneurs are the foundation of a healthy economy, and Las Pegasus should be no different."
 LSP_synthetic_security:0 "Synthetic Oil"
 LSP_synthetic_security_desc:0 "Las Pegasus' economy chugs petroleum like it's water, and our national reserves are likely not large enough to sustain further growth. Therefore, rather than trading for it with the outside world, why not synthesize our own?"
 LSP_national_development_plan:0 "National Development Plan"
 LSP_national_development_plan_desc:0 "Roads are the veins and arteries of states. They connect the production hubs that Las Pegasus could simply not function without. We should make plenty sure that our roads and highways are calibrated to support our rapidly-growing economy."
 LSP_economic_calibration:0 "Recalibrate the Economy"
 LSP_economic_calibration_desc:0 "With the prices steadily stabilizing, the mass-unemployment slowly dwindling and the lack of basic goods quickly dissipating, the people are beginning to have renewed hope in Las Pegasus' economy, and the negative effects of our sudden independence are rapidly being forgotten."
 LSP_digging_industry_waffleland:0 "Eyes Below"
 LSP_digging_industry_waffleland_desc:0 "Waffleland has been somewhat neglected so far, at least economically. The region has been shunned to simply being the nation's breadbasket and that little more, but after only a little bit of prospecting, we've unearthed a treasure trove's worth of natural resources waiting to be extracted."
 LSP_military_industrial_complex:0 "Military Industrial Complex"
 LSP_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "We have a steady civilian industry, but wars will not be won by flinging toasters or fine luxury cars at the enemy. Allocating some extra funds to military industry will make sure our soldiers don't happen to run out of bullets mid-fight."
 LSP_recycling_act:0 "The Recyling Act"
 LSP_recycling_act_desc:0 "Our resources are not infinite. They're very finite, in fact. Therefore, we must not let anything go to waste. One pony's rubbish is another pony's treasure, and nowhere should that ring truer than in Las Pegasus. We've got plenty of trash - plastic, paper, rubber... rather than chucking it all in the sea and killing the turtles, let's see if there's any way we can put it to better use."
 LSP_our_inner_magic:0 "Our Inner Magic"
 LSP_our_inner_magic_desc:0 "Industry, however powerful, still pales in comparison to the might of ponies. Magic is at our hooftips, and the world is simply our oyster. The horn of a unicorn is the perfect substitute for any level of fine machinery. The wings of a pegasus could beat any aircraft in a race. The mighty hooves of an earth pony work better than any mining equipment. We have everything we need within ourselves."
 LSP_autarky_research:0 "The Academy of Las Pegasus"
 LSP_autarky_research_desc:0 "At last, we haven't only survived our independence economically, but flourished because of it. The specialized, intelligent ponies of the new academy will leave their mark on Las Pegasus' research projects for the better, and their advancements will be remembered for generations to come."
 LSP_trading_economy:0 "Embracing Globalism"
 LSP_trading_economy_desc:0 "Las Pegasus is a bastion of potential growth. In the wartorn countryside left in the wake of the Equestrian Civil War, we stand tall and unscathed, the industrial machine ready to whirr the life with the force of an awoken tiger. We have everything others could want - why not give it to them? For a price, of course."
 LSP_connect_nation:0 "Connect the Nation"
 LSP_connect_nation_desc:0 "The dusty backroads of the labyrinthine spaghetti of highways across the nation - and especially in Waffleland - will simply not be enough for our plans of a vast, expansive trading economy. We need asphalt, railways, stations... we need to more properly connect Las Pegasus."
 LSP_tax_cut:0 "A Lil' Tax Cut"
 LSP_tax_cut_desc:0 "Money is the universal constant of growth - so Las Pegasus cannot grow if her citizens are spending all of their money on taxes. An itsy-bitsy tax cut will hardly impact our finances, and will in turn leave many entrepeneurs with just the financial surplus to kickstart new companies and industry."
 LSP_waffleland_resettlement_act:0 "Waffleand Resettlement Act"
 LSP_waffleland_resettlement_act_desc:0 "So many of the nation's newcomers head straight for the city and walk right by the sprawling, golden plains of Waffleland. A shame, really - it's a lovely place! New legislation should ensure that it will not end up barren, and that the economic gap between rural Waffleland and highly urbanized Las Pegasus will slowly be bridged."
 LSP_encourage_agriculture:0 "Encourage Agriculture"
 LSP_encourage_agriculture_desc:0 "The threat of famine is one long-conquered by Las Pegasus, and while the food stores are certainly not going to dry up anytime soon, it can never hurt to have a surplus, can it? Encouraging farming and agriculture will not only boost the economy, but also encourage population growth."
 LSP_economic_upswing:0 "Economic Upswing"
 LSP_economic_upswing_desc:0 "It was expected that we'd recover. After all, Las Pegasus is too large and finanfically well-off to be in the economic gutter for too long - but nobody quite expected such a quick and drastic upswing. It's safe to say, now, that the ponies have, at last, regained faith in the economy."
 LSP_expand_industrial_districts:0 "Expand the Industrial Districts"
 LSP_expand_industrial_districts_desc:0 "Unemployment is a thing of the past - now, companies are complaining about a lack of workers! Infrastructure projects to expand the industrial districts and to invite foreign labour will allow Las Pegasus to keep up with the ponypower demands."
 LSP_a_free_newspaper_industry:0 "Free Press"
 LSP_a_free_newspaper_industry_desc:0 "We have outgrown the red scare, or the PCA scare, or the-whatever-scare. Our ponies now have opinions the government doesn't need to be scared of, and we should allow them to speak their mind."
 LSP_arms_dealing:0 "Dealing in Arms"
 LSP_arms_dealing_desc:0 "Industry is more than refrigerators, radios, sports cars and typewriters. To some, it's bullets, machine guns, tanks and bombs. The economy runs on consumers during peace time, but should war come knocking on Las Pegasus' door, we'll have to make sure the enemy doesn't catch us with our pants down."
 LSP_booming_electronics_trade:0 "The Electronics Trade"
 LSP_booming_electronics_trade_desc:0 "As our understanding of electricity and circuits grow, we've come to understand that complex circuitry can have plenty of uses - from military applications in the form of radars and computers, to civilian goods like hairdriers, radios, etcetera. \n\nAnyone want a microwave?"
 LSP_trading_research:0 "Scientific Communities"
 LSP_trading_research_desc:0 "Embracing globalism has allowed Las Pegasus to procure specialized, trained ponies from every field and facet of society. From artists such as painters and musicians, to industrialists specializing in everything from car construction to armament production, and, of course, to scientists ready and eager to make the world a better place."
 LSP_gambling_economy:0 "A Shrewd Economy"
 LSP_gambling_economy_desc:0 "Though there are some that hiss at the concept of Las Pegasus becoming a gambling den, all proverbial roads point towards a gambling economy. We have it all - a beautiful vista, a beautiful city, the potential for riches... Las Pegasus' got it all, baby!"
 LSP_open_door_policy:0 "An Open Door Policy"
 LSP_open_door_policy_desc:0 "It would be somewhat detrimental if it was our own citizens gambling and getting drunk and rowdy - an open door policy would welcome plenty of rich foreigners with wide, open arms, and give our pubs, hotels and casinos a stable influx of visitors."
 LSP_power_of_private_sector:0 "The Private Sector"
 LSP_power_of_private_sector_desc:0 "The government has no place in this shrewd economic scheme - it's all about the private, entrepreneurial citizen. The most we can do is look the other way whenever something unscrupulous happens, and make sure the city remains functional and pretty. And collecting our due taxes, of course. Power... to the private sector!"
 LSP_city_tram_scheme:0 "New Tram Lines"
 LSP_city_tram_scheme_desc:0 "All of these pretty buildings are nothing but attractions on the city skyline if the ponies can't get to them. Connecting the city through a thorough yet easy-to-navigate network of trams, metros and buslines should allow our visitors to easily go (and spend money) from point A to point B."
 LSP_looser_labor_laws:0 "Looser Labour Laws"
 LSP_looser_labor_laws_desc:0 "Hey, to make an omelet, you've got to break a couple of eggs, and to ensure economic growth, you've got to break a couple of worker-safety laws. Good thing we handled the commies, or else the unions would've been all over us by now."
 LSP_economic_surge:0 "An Economic Surge"
 LSP_economic_surge_desc:0 "Profits were almost... instantaneous. All it took was some advertising and a good first impression to get the ball rolling. This whole scheme has worked brilliantly, and Las Pegasus grows more and more by the day. Not particularly renowned for a hearty manufacturing sector, the economy largely relies on services, which work hoof-in-hoof with the tourist sector."
 LSP_employ_the_huddled_masses:0 "Employ the Masses"
 LSP_employ_the_huddled_masses_desc:0 "Having a service-oriented economy is great for jobs, because not every employee has to be built like a fridge with hooves to survive the workplace. We've got plenty of open positions in all manner of sectors, and we've also got plenty of workers eager to make a living."
 LSP_private_arms_dealers:0 "Private Arms Dealers"
 LSP_private_arms_dealers_desc:0 "You know, why build our own armament factories when we can simply employ arms dealers from all over Equestria to do that facet of the industry for us? All of the expertise, knowledge and training without any of the drawbacks!"
 LSP_new_jobs_in_waffleland:0 "New Jobs in Waffleland"
 LSP_new_jobs_in_waffleland_desc:0 "We shouldn't let our rural neighbours in Waffleland get the short end of the stick, here. Las Pegasus is growing at an incredible rate, and we shouldn't leave our bretheren to starve. Investing in Waffleland farming will make sure Las Pegasus will never have to face the threat of famine ever again. And, it would also leave us with a surplus of pastries. A croissant, anyone?"
 LSP_reinvest_in_industry:0 "Reinvest in Industry"
 LSP_reinvest_in_industry_desc:0 "We've been neglecting the manufacturing sector a little too much, now. Trickleing some of the profits made from the services and gambling back into industry should make sure that Las Pegasus' economy doesn't become too lobsided."
 LSP_gambling_research:0 "The One Percent Research"
 LSP_gambling_research_desc:0 "Our lax immigration policies and general attractiveness has lead to Las Pegasus becoming a melting-pot for all sorts of ideas and projects. Scientists from all over the globe flock to participate in new R&D sectors popping up all over Las Pegasus. Who knew gambling and crime attracted so many nerds?"
 ###Navy and Air Focuses##
 LSP_air_begun:0 "Birth of the Las Pegasus Air Force"
 LSP_air_begun_desc:0 "This is the modern world. No armed force can never fight without planes to protect them from aerial bombardment. It's time for Las Pegasus Planes to be equipped for action."
 LSP_repurpose_docks:0 "Converting the Las Pegasus Shipyard"
 LSP_repurpose_docks_desc:0 "We don't need ships, we need planes, and as much as possible! Let's scrap these shipyards and convert as much material as possible into working airplane factories that can get this air force running pronto."
 LSP_build_runways:0 "Expanding the Las Pegasus Airport"
 LSP_build_runways_desc:0 "The Las Pegasus Airport needs an upgrade. We definitely can be putting more fighters to bolster our air force. Let's make more runaways so we can fit more planes to fight in the Las Pegasus skies."
 LSP_our_air_doctrine:0 "A New Doctrine for a New Air Force"
 LSP_our_air_doctrine_desc:0 "A new airforce means a need for new strategies for the air war. We will have all our pilots and air commanders convene to form a new doctrine that defines the actions of our air force."
 LSP_fighters:0 "New Fighters On the Strip"
 LSP_fighters_desc:0 "Without good fighters, the skies will never remain in our hooves. Let's make sure we have the best fighters we can create to outmatch and drive off the air forces of others."
 LSP_bombers:0 "New Bombers On the Strip"
 LSP_bombers_desc:0 "Without good bombers. Our forces will be much weaker against any hostile attacking our ground forces. Let's make sure we have the best bombers to support our ground troops the best they can."
 LSP_aviation_streamlining:0 "More Planes the Better!"
 LSP_aviation_streamlining_desc:0 "We should be able to make our plane production more efficient and cost less with our new streamlined assembly process. We will be able to churn out new planes that can fill up the ranks of our air force faster than ever."
 LSP_navy_begun:0 "Birth of the Las Pegasus Navy"
 LSP_navy_begun_desc:0 "Let's face it. Our new country is dependent on oceanic trade to both survive and prosper. We must strengthen our navy to not only protect our coastlines but to protect our shipping."
 LSP_bigger_naval_base:0 "Enlargening the Las Pegasus Port"
 LSP_bigger_naval_base_desc:0 "With our independence, we cannot rely on inland trade as much anymore. We need to expand the port to accomodate more ships and more convoys for our newly fledgling navy."
 LSP_expand_docks:0 "Expanding the Las Pegasus Shipyard"
 LSP_expand_docks_desc:0 "Las Pegasus needs a larger fleet in order to accomodate our new status. We should construct additional shipyards to account for the naval growth we are trying to achieve"
 LSP_our_naval_doctrine:0 "A New Doctrine For a New Navy"
 LSP_our_naval_doctrine_desc:0 "A new fleet means a need for new strategies for the naval war. We will have all our captains and admirals convene to form a new doctrine that defines the actions of our fleet."
 LSP_carrier:0 "A Modern Flagship"
 LSP_carrier_desc:0 "Battleships are not needed anymore. We need to incorporate air to accomodate for our new flagship. The aircraft carrier will lead the way for the Las Pegasus Fleet"
 LSP_battleship:0 "A Classic Flagship"
 LSP_battleship_desc:0 "The battleship is still an effective flagship to help our fleet survive. It is a symbol of power and will help defend our seas for the Las Pegasus Fleet."
 LSP_jewel_of_equus:0 "Jewel of Equus"
 LSP_jewel_of_equus_desc:0 "Our navy will be the jewel of the Equestrian seas! Our ship productions might soon be able to rival Skyfalls in enough time as we develop our fledging fleet."

#### FOCUS

EYR_fifth_onslaught:0 "The Fifth Onslaught"
EYR_fifth_onslaught_desc:0 "Our reliable sources have confirmed what we all dread: Vincent Erie, the self proclaimed Duke of Erie, is preparing a yet another attack against his rightful liege lord. The true ruler of Verenia must rally his soldiers, marshal his defences and prepare his people. House Eyrie does not bow before insurgents and mutineers."
EYR_sudden_death:0 "An Unexpected Passing"
EYR_sudden_death_desc:0 "After a sudden bout of illness, Captain Otto von Grieslein of the Verenian Guard has passed away. Though he was unable to break the stalemate, his tenacity and skills have ensured that the Aranti defence line remained strong. A new Guard-Captain will have to be chosen, but in the meantime, the Duke has requested a day of mourning."
EYR_take_control:0 "Take Matters Into Our Own Claws"
EYR_take_control_desc:0 "We must break this vicious cycle of war. No more will we be the defenders in Vincent's game. If we want things to change, we must go on the offence!"
EYR_empower_prelature:0 "Cooperate With The Prelature"
EYR_empower_prelature_desc:0 "Those who keep claiming that the Prelature is running a conspiracy with the foreigners, at the expense of Verenia, are clearly misguided and irrational. Though the paladins' defection years ago was treacherous, those who remained have clearly proved themselves to be trustworthy. Only with them standing by our side can we end the Struggle."
EYR_empower_merchants:0 "Cooperate With The Burghers"
EYR_empower_merchants_desc:0 "After the republican revolution, we placed several restrictions on merchant trade. Admittedly, this has hampered our economy and kept our country from growing. Though we haven't excused them of their guilt, we should consider giving them a bit more autonomy in exchange for their support."
EYR_invite_foreigners:0 "Invite Foreign Assistance"
EYR_invite_foreigners_desc:0 "Let us be honest: our soldiers are not the best. The constant battles have whittled down our best soldiers and our equipment has become faultier over the years. There must be griffs in the old Empire who still remember the days Verenia paid heed to their words."
EYR_overrule_hof:0 "With The Duke Or Against Him"
EYR_overrule_hof_desc:0 "The nobility have been obstructing, scheming and even disobeying Iovinus for too long. Let it be very clear from now on: they can either fall in line or they can end up like the secessionists west of the Aranti, and their family's possessions will be forfeit to the Duke."
EYR_press_paladins_into_service:0 "The Return Of The Paladins"
EYR_press_paladins_into_service_desc:0 "After the late Duke's death, most of the paladins joined Vincent in his rebellion. The remnant remained loyal to the Prelature, maintaining neutrality to protect the holy sites. If we can show our new resolve to the paladins in the Temple, they may join Iovinus in ending this war."
EYR_deal_with_flowena:0 "Flowena Backroom Deal"
EYR_deal_with_flowena_desc:0 "Flowena has benefited from playing both sides in our conflict, but even they must understand Vincent is a far worse choice. Grand promises and displays of sincerity will have to be made if we wish to earn their assistance. Then we can discuss clearing the debt that has been unfairly accrued on our behalf."
EYR_fuck_off_vincent:0 "The Restoration Of Righteous Rule"
EYR_fuck_off_vincent_desc:0 "Vincent Erie is but a pitiful mongrel, unworthy of even ruling the smallest patch of land, much less proud Verenia herself. For all the might he boasts of, it will inevitably crash against our strongholds, our gallant defenders. The song of war claims Verenia once more, and this time we shall be the victors without uncertainty."
EYR_new_captain:0 "Appease The Nobles"
EYR_new_captain_desc:0 "As unfortunate as his death is, we cannot leave Guard-Captain Otto's position vacant. Vincent's forces are mounting across the river as we speak. Desperate times call for desperate measures, and so we must cooperate with the more... warmongering side of the nobility."
EYR_convene_court:0 "A Meeting In Haste"
EYR_convene_court_desc:0 "Quickly! Gather the council! We cannot relax against the face of an invasion. Every aspect of our country will be affected, and if we ignore a single possibility, we will lose this war. We must plan accordingly for these next few months."
EYR_the_yearly_obligations:0 "Arms, Armour, Idols"
EYR_the_yearly_obligations_desc:0 "Waging war is all about supplies and logistics, for what good is a griffon if he has no weapon or uniform? Recent events necessitate a forced increase in the production of materiel, all paid for from the Duke's personal treasury. A small investment that pays great dividends for the continued survival."
EYR_fund_economist:0 "Adjusting The Books"
EYR_fund_economist_desc:0 "War is an economic torment for the Duke of Eyrie and his lands. Maintaining a standing army is incredibly expensive, and thus we are struggling to complete the mobilisation in face of this new attack. However, the House Treasurer is an incredibly gifted administrator and should be able to achieve such, though it will come at a considerable expense."
EYR_the_prelature:0 "Beseech The Prelature For Aid"
EYR_the_prelature_desc:0 "With the mobilisation experiencing many issues, it is clear we won't be able to bring our full strength against House Erie's assault. While our defensive position ensures that we can hold them off with inferior numbers, it would be good to even the odds with the help of the paladins. These gallant warriors, always prepared for war, will make up the deficit, but their help comes with a cost."
EYR_what_we_must:0 "In Defence Of Eyrie"
EYR_what_we_must_desc:0 "Soldiers, paladins, peasants, merchants, nobles - they all fight for House Eyrie, directly or indirectly. The time is right for them to be placed on high alert, to muster their capabilities, for a storm is coming, and we must all work together in all our capacity to weather it."
EYR_militias:0 "Peasant Militias"
EYR_militias_desc:0 "They grumble and complain, but the lowly have an obligation to their betters that is simply unavoidable. It is not exploitation, but rather a continuance of a social contract that has defined relations between griffons since ages past. To arms, peasants, for House Eyrie, for Verenia!"
EYR_defence_plan:0 "To Counter Their Plans"
EYR_defence_plan_desc:0 "The villainous Vincent is a crude oaf, but it is not he who decides strategy. His subordinates are far more competent and effective, no doubt hatching some ingenious plan, and we must decide on our own strategy to effectively counter any surprise they might have. The Duke will be holding a meeting with the new Guard-Captain and his officers."
EYR_holding_fast:0 "Surviving The Onslaught"
EYR_holding_fast_desc:0 "We've rallied as best as we could, and war is inevitable. It is certain that the other side of the riverline can see our stalwart defences, yet they remain committed to their attack. Let them break once more, and only then shall we surge forward to put an end to a Struggle so great that claimed to many lives."

EYR_stalemate_reigns:0 "Stalemate Reigns"
EYR_stalemate_reigns_desc:0 "The Duke is most displeased with his disobedient underlings. There was a clear plan, agreed by everygriff, and it was not followed. It's only the smallest of condolences that we're left with a ceasefire, as if nothing happened, though that's no satisfaction for all the perished souls. Something has to change in this broken house."

EYR_the_state_of_the_treasury:0 "Review Finances"
EYR_the_state_of_the_treasury_desc:0 "The House Treasurer is a griff of unparalleled ability when it comes to managing the idols. It's certain that without her, the soldiers would be reduced to wearing sacks instead of uniforms, and the economy would revert to bartering. Relying on her substantial abilities could result in House Eyrie prevailing in the Struggle without those unruly nobles."
EYR_the_local_economy:0 "Address The Road Problem"
EYR_the_local_economy_desc:0 "The constant usage of our infrastructure, primarily for military purposes, has resulted in their deterioration. There is simply little resources left for maintaining them, but recent developments have given us an opportunity to correct this. However, desires differ while there's only so many idols to go around..."
EYR_consoomer_goods:0 "Putting The Unsuitables To Work"
EYR_consoomer_goods_desc:0 "Serfdom continues to be a common sight in Verenia, for better or worse. It is simple and straightforward to build new factories, but the shortage of labour makes them produce much less than they could. Something has to be negotiated to allow these griffs without rights to put their labour into something far more valuable than plowing some fruitless field."
EYR_solving_resource_deficits:0 "Expand Mining Industry"
EYR_solving_resource_deficits_desc:0 "Abundant fields aren't the only quality Verenia possesses, but there are a number of promising veins where natural resources are plentiful. Though we are currently self-sufficient for all our domestic needs, unlike that incompetent stooge across the river, growing industry will demand a larger quantity of them. Best to preempt the problem."
EYR_funding_a_solution:0 "Supplementing Inadequancies"
EYR_funding_a_solution_desc:0 "Unbeknownst to most, the House Treasurer runs an illicit scheme. A most dangerous one, in arms dealing, which has been a decent source to supplement our middling production. The Duke has been considering expanding these operations, but they'll need a better cover, lest the nobles discover they are being shortchanged."
EYR_embargo_vincent:0 "Offering A Better Deal"
EYR_embargo_vincent_desc:0 "Even though most nations refuse to take any part in the Struggle, ordinary trade continues to flow. This is what allows Vincent to stay afloat despite completely neglecting the needs of his subjects. Perhaps, if those same nations were offered an incentive to cease their trade, House Erie will be in a far more disadvantageous position for the final battle."
EYR_better_weapons:0 "Firearm Modernisation Scheme"
EYR_better_weapons_desc:0 "From the humble musket to today's rifle, firearms have seen considerable advancement over the centuries. Freya has only a passing interest in them, but she knows that having the best weapon results in highest chance of success. Simple mathematics, as it is, which is why this is a pursuit that deserves funding."
EYR_devil_deal:0 "To Sell Pride And Blood"
EYR_devil_deal_desc:0 "Bankers love to present an united front, but some would be happy to work behind the backs of their colleagues for a good deal. Freya happens to be friends with some, and they could circumvent the blockade their banks unjustly exert on House Eyrie. Nothing comes free, however, but concluding the Struggle would be worth any price they name. As long as we don't end up selling Verenia to them as a result."

EYR_touring_the_barracks:0 "Tour The Barracks"
EYR_touring_the_barracks_desc:0 "Though the Guard-Captain is a griff of rough temperament, the soldiers readily follow him, whether out of fear or devotion. To reassure the troops that their liege lord does care for them, Iovinus shall take his time to visit the injured, and perhaps give out medals where appropriate. Of course, the primary goal is to define the new defensive plan, and prevent a repeat of recent events."
EYR_factory_expansion_project:0 "Industrial Expansion Project"
EYR_factory_expansion_project_desc:0 "Verenia is not the richest of regions, but that doesn't mean its production capabilities should be outsourced to some idol grubber from Rottendedam. Instead, we should provide incentives for our industrial magnates to expand their options, hire more workers, all those boring things. Some kickbacks are to be expected, but as long as House Eyrie benefits as a whole, it can be tolerated."
EYR_repair_forts:0 "Save What Can Be Saved"
EYR_repair_forts_desc:0 "What little fortifications we have are on the verge of crumbling, and much effort is placed into maintaining them as best as possible given scant resources. Many reasons prevent us from expanding them into a formidable structure that could keep Vincent's rabble at bay, but for now we should give them the attention they deserve."
EYR_tithes_and_tribute:0 "The Duke's Amazing Collection"
EYR_tithes_and_tribute_desc:0 "Like any proper noble, Iovinus has an extensive collection of artwork, coinage, apparel and precious metals. Such vast value that could fund entire regiments to fight on our side... if he could be convinced to part with any of it. Certainly, it could be bought again after the war... and if he's not victorious, then he'll have larger problems to worry about."
EYR_enact_conscription:0 "Replenish The Guard"
EYR_enact_conscription_desc:0 "It is difficult to ascertain how many griffs are currently serving in the Verenian Guard, for many reasons. Yet the most recent bloodshed has raised concerns that our effective strength is insufficient to resist the next attack. There is no doubt it is arriving, sooner or later, which is why the quotas must be expanded and new regiments raised for the Duke."
EYR_calm_the_nobles:0 "Having A Ball"
EYR_calm_the_nobles_desc:0 "In such uncertain times, we must turn to our traditions and reassure the most important griffs that everything is fine. The grand palace has not held a party since the days of peace, and don't our gallant nobility deserve a night to relax? The merchants and other such undesirables will not be allowed to attend, and they better not complain either!"
EYR_righteousness_of_our_cause:0 "Convincing The Peasants"
EYR_righteousness_of_our_cause_desc:0 "It comes without surprise that the Struggle is not a very popular concern for the people. After all, they have far more worries in their lives than fighting for some distant, uncaring lord... But perhaps a sufficient amount could be convinced otherwise. By word or reward, and some creative interpretation of truth, there could be more volunteers for the cause."
EYR_hold_court:0 "A Day In Court"
EYR_hold_court_desc:0 "One of the many obligations the Duke owes to his subjects is holding court on a yearly basis. There, they present their grievances and requests, after exhausting all other means of satisfaction, and the gracious ruler either obliges or dismisses their demands. Generosity can inspire the people, but choices made can have a long lasting consequence."
EYR_aerial_advantage:0 "Different Vector Of Attack"
EYR_aerial_advantage_desc:0 "Some nobles are proponents of technology, and realise that if we want an actual advantage, something has to change. Through their Herzland contacts, they could secure us aircraft that are beyond House Erie's ability to counter. The only issue is instructing griffs to operate these machines on a quick notice, but that could be corrected by simply hiring experienced ones."
EYR_officer_training:0 "Correcting Knowledge Gaps"
EYR_officer_training_desc:0 "The officers of the Verenian Guard, by requirement all nobles, are not bereft of skill in war, but combat is an always changing problem. With the knowledge gained over the decades of Struggle, we should devote some resources to teaching present and future ones how to perform more effectively. It may be crucial in the coming days..."
EYR_unassailable_defence:0 "Come And Take It, Vincent!"
EYR_unassailable_defence_desc:0 "The unruly ones have been restrained, and this time there shall be nothing going against the plan. The river Aranti shall choke with their dead, but the plan must be flexible. Like a cornered snake, there is no telling what sort of desperate gamble Vincent will perform. We need to be prepared for anything, and the Guard-Captain will ensure it is so."

EYR_the_temple_of_eyr:0 "Spiritual Respite"
EYR_the_temple_of_eyr_desc:0 "While many put distrust in the Verenian Prelate (and are rightfully afraid of her glare), Iovinus does not share this attitude. He understands that the resources under her control could be crucial for the unification, even if many others believe he's making a deal with Maar by doing so. Nonetheless, there is nothing that can prevent the Duke from attending a sermon."
EYR_look_for_the_poor:0 "Comfort For The Needy"
EYR_look_for_the_poor_desc:0 "The Struggle has left many griffs destitute, due to taxation, crippling injuries sustained in a battle or other unpleasant outcomes. Thus there's a large amount of homeless which even the Temple of Eyr struggles to provide for. If the Duke were to give them a claw, it would show his devotion to the Gods, and more importantly remove the loitering vagrants from the streets of Calembourg."
EYR_pleb_schools:0 "Spreading The Right Wisdom"
EYR_pleb_schools_desc:0 "Education is by tradition a luxury reserved for the more well-off, leaving many to rely on common folk "wisdom". Present circumstances are not favourable for enacting some sort of full scale mandatory schooling policy, but we could spare some idols in this direction. Of course, we'd make sure that the knowledge shared would be favourable towards us."
EYR_bless_the_fields:0 "Land's Bounty"
EYR_bless_the_fields_desc:0 "The many legends of Verenia credit Eyr for the plentiful miracles that have occurred in its long and storied history. While proving the influence of the divine is like trying to fight dragons bareclawed, the rituals provide griffs a sense of comfort and security that is hard to inspire otherwise. As always, the Prelate will be happy to perform them, if given the resources."
EYR_the_paladins:0 "The Proud Ones\nOf The Triarchy"
EYR_the_paladins_desc:0 "Continued cooperation with the Prelature is putting Iovinus in an unenviable position. The nobility are finding many excuses and loopholes to decrease their griffonpower contribution, convinced that the Duke is selling out Verenia to foreign interests. What ridiculous notions! Yet there is little other choice but to reintegrate the paladin remnants into the household forces."
EYR_tax_of_piety:0 "Eyr's Eleos"
EYR_tax_of_piety_desc:0 "Per the ancient laws since the days of Grover I, the temples do not collect any sort of taxation or tribute; they subsist by donations or their clergy's contributions. Laws can easily change with a ducal signature, and it would benefit the Prelature if they were allowed to take one tenth of the serfs' taxes. Some of it would find its way back into matters the Duke desires."
EYR_strike_fear:0 "Fear Of The Divine"
EYR_strike_fear_desc:0 "There are many a griff in Verenia who are quite lacking in basic erudition. Superstitious, frightful, quite easily cowed into believing something they shouldn't. The Prelate retains many contacts on the west side of the Aranti river, and if the right message were to spread... Vincent would have quite a scuffle on his claws."
EYR_archonate_friends:0 "Our Friends In Romau"
EYR_archonate_friends_desc:0 "While prelatures are mostly independent from the desires of the archonates, there are still certain niceties to be observed. With her contacts in Romau, Verena could decisively change the outcome of the Struggle in our favour. The only questions that remain is whether the nobility will accept this foreign interference, and the sort of price Erion XII would exact from us."

EYR_the_iron_duke:0 "The Iron Duke"
EYR_the_iron_duke_desc:0 "This farce has been put to an end, after such an extraordinary amount of time. No more shall imbecilic Vincent or naive Katrina stand in the way of Verenia's rightful ruler! Now comes the time to trample whatever is left of their petty schemes, quash any ideas of a revolt, and bring back the good times before 978. Never again shall the Struggle ruin lives."

EYR_loser_faggot_vincent:0 "Punish Vincent"
EYR_loser_faggot_vincent_desc:0 "The madgriff of Erie, in all his bluster and arrogance, certainly believed he would return to Calembourg! That he has, in irons and chains as he awaits the Duke's sentence. His fate is sealed, but it only remains to be seen what sort of humiliation will he suffer before that."
EYR_dealing_with_rebels:0 "And The Remainder"
EYR_dealing_with_rebels_desc:0 "There are a multitude of minor houses that followed Vincent and Katrina in their goals, and we have captured a majority of their members. Some have fled across the borders, abandoning their homes and families, but those are of little concern. Instead, it should be decided whether these rebels have any place in Verenia's future, or will they meet ignoble ends."
EYR_deal_with_katrina:0 "But Go Easy On Amelinda's Successor"
EYR_deal_with_katrina_desc:0 "Katrina has been a most puzzling conundrum. First she tried in vain to settle the Struggle with peace, then she allowed herself to be overruled by her supposedly loyal captains. The traitors have already been dealt with in a manner which they deserve, but the question remains what to do with this nearest blood relative. Could she be an asset, or simply trouble?"

EYR_praise_the_advisor:0 "On Merit And Competence"
EYR_praise_the_advisor_desc:0 "If history books ever dedicate themselves wholly to the Struggle, they'll write that one of the Duke's advisors played a key role in ending it. Honest service and dedication must be rewarded to encourage the lesser servants to continue striving for favour."

EYR_a_step_back:0 "Taking A Step Back"
EYR_a_step_back_desc:0 "The good Duke, spent from his many years of struggle and work, wishes to retreat from his obligations for a while. His most favoured advisor shall take a more active leadership role in Verenia while he takes a much deserved rest with his beloved family."
EYR_the_obliging_nobility:0 "The Obliging Nobility"
EYR_the_obliging_nobility_desc:0 "Do we not have an obligation to our subjects? It is no secret that Vincent and his clique were exploiting the peasantry to the bone with their taxes and quotas. To show that we are their rightful and just masters, the nobility will spend some of their hard earned idols into the wellbeing of common griffons."
EYR_stealing_vincents_junk:0 "Make Use Of Their Innovations"
EYR_stealing_vincents_junk_desc:0 "With defeat imminent, many who served the secessionists have abandoned their masters in great numbers. Of particular attention is one inventor named Fabrice, who was providing great innovations for the former lord of Erie. His whereabouts are unknown, but his factories and workshops remain, with their prizes left for us to take."
EYR_noblesse_oblige:0 "Poverty Solving Measures"
EYR_noblesse_oblige_desc:0 "While some believe that a peasant deserves nothing more than the clothes on their backs (and even that is too much), the truth is that a destitute griffon is a worthless one. With no hope or opportunities in life, they are nothing but vagabonds or loiterers. A bit of welfare would go a long way in preventing societal upheaval, as well."
EYR_militias_go_home:0 "Relieve The Militiagriffs Of Their Duty"
EYR_militias_go_home_desc:0 "Perhaps it is difficult to turn a rifle into a ploughshare, but what's certain is that we no longer have a need for the militias that were hastily raised in the climax of the Struggle. Let them return to their homes, tend to their families, and help us out in rebuilding Verenia."
EYR_digging_up_resources:0 "Prospecting For Resources"
EYR_digging_up_resources_desc:0 "Industrial development demands further base materials. For the most part we've done well with what was at our disposal, yet our continued growth means resource shortages will become inevitable. To avoid indebting ourselves to a foreign power, it would be better to conduct geographical surveys and figure where we can find the best return on investment from digging out metals."
EYR_lords_into_barons:0 "Noble Lords\nInto Robber Barons"
EYR_lords_into_barons_desc:0 "Who better to complete the industrial revolution than our best and noblest? They are the only ones with the capital to sustain these changes! Some have already pioneered the process but much has been prevented by the Struggle. Nonetheless, it is clear now that agriculture will never be as profitable as industry, and thus we must seize the opportunity before those thieving merchants."
EYR_dredge_river:0 "Harshest Scar Of The Struggle"
EYR_dredge_river_desc:0 "Beautiful Aranti has turned into an eyesore worthy of Maar. It is our obligation to restore it to its previous splendour, to clear out any remaining shells, and give anygriff still lying there a proper burial service. Only this way can the land become usable again, and the riverine trade shall flourish as well."
EYR_guard_professionalisation:0 "Guard Professionalisation"
EYR_guard_professionalisation_desc:0 "The Verenian Guard have shown their valour in the Struggle, but it remains an outdated force, unsuitable for anything more than protecting borders and cities. Now that tentative peace has settled for a while, the political will to push those sorely needed reforms has greatly risen, yet there will be plenty of debate on how to proceed."
EYR_about_feudalism:0 "The Debate On Serfdom"
EYR_about_feudalism_desc:0 "For many, efficiency is a key value. Much like how griffons abandoned slavery as an economic model many centuries ago (unlike the savages down below in Zebrica), serfdom is starting to show its age in a world where menial labour is pushed out by increased automatisation. Many nobles cannot afford to keep their serfs, but they will not give up on their privileged status."
EYR_jobs_jobs_jobs:0 "Nogriff Without Work"
EYR_jobs_jobs_jobs_desc:0 "Toil and labour, the essential part of anygriff. Continued development has created many jobs yet there are still shortages in our vital industries. The causes of this have been narrowed down to meagre wages and overly long working hours. It would be wrong to interfere in a free market too much, but some reforms are needed to remind the lower classes to be grateful we're giving them work."
EYR_defending_verenia:0 "Protecting Verenia"
EYR_defending_verenia_desc:0 "With reforms in place and the Guard growing in strength, we should establish preliminary plans for the defence of our homeland. Inevitably, somegriff will wish to enact their designs on beautiful Verenia, but we shall be prepared for what may come."
EYR_better_than_ever:0 "Business Can Only Grow"
EYR_better_than_ever_desc:0 "For the first time in a while, it can be accurately said that production has exceeded the amount of imports. What a milestone we've reached, indeed! Verenia is well on its way as a self-sufficient nation that won't depend on the capricious whims of foreign vultures. Still, a few more subsidies would do well in ensuring this positive state continues."
EYR_arts_culture:0 "Arts And Culture"
EYR_arts_culture_desc:0 "Iovinus has always had a reputation as a patron of the arts, and he has amassed a grand collection over the years. Some were sold to fund his victory, but he has recovered most of it and proclaimed his intentions to let everygriff culturally enlighten themselves (for a modest fee). It should certainly open up the lesser minds for greater ideas."
EYR_imperial_styled_warfare:0 "Cues From The Reichsarmee"
EYR_imperial_styled_warfare_desc:0 "The Imperial army was one of the most innovative forces, and that still holds true to this day. Truly, this should be a model to imitate for the Verenian Guard! Their latest doctrinal advancements will be studied and implemented in a suitable fashion."
EYR_peaceful_times:0 "Truly A Peaceful Verenia"
EYR_peaceful_times_desc:0 "Expectations were high all the way back in 978: it was believed Verenia would once more regain its prosperous status, if not for that thrice-cursed Republican Revolution! Nonetheless, the days of the Struggle are becoming a distant memory, and everygriff looks forward to the future, guided by their noble overlords."

EYR_remain_independent:0 "Verenia On Its Own"
EYR_remain_independent_desc:0 "Great powers play their own game, and Verenia shall not be a pawn in any. We have not fought so hard to heal this fractured land only to sell it off to the first bidder carrying a bag of idols. This is a strong and independent region, and it shall stay that way by our blood and pride."
EYR_simping_for_empire:0 "Adelina's Greatest Decision"
EYR_simping_for_empire_desc:0 "There is no shame in realising that you're simply outmatched. Indeed, the rising star of [GRD.GetNameDef] has led many to believe that if history should repeat itself, then it would be best to lay down our banner as Adelina did. But make no mistake: even servants can pursue their own agenda."
EYR_dynamic_exceptionalism:0 "Exhort Verenian Exceptionalism"
EYR_dynamic_exceptionalism_desc:0 "Is there any culture greater than ours? Who else can claim a longer legacy than beautiful Verenia, descendents of the firstborn? Certainly not those filthy Discrets, Grovers or any other griffs! Our citizens must know their history, so that they may take pride in their efforts for our country."
EYR_funding_intelligence_agency:0 "Intelligence Department"
EYR_funding_intelligence_agency_desc:0 "Planning relies on effective intelligence. Without foreknowledge of what could happen, we are left wandering in the dark, helpless as our rivals descend upon us. While espionage has always been a part of state activities, it now requires centralisation, focus, and no small amount of paperwork."
EYR_national_unity:0 "[Root.GetNationalUnityFocusName]"
EYR_national_unity_default:0 "In Service To Our Betters"
EYR_national_unity_alternate:0 "Imperial Development Aid"
EYR_national_unity_desc:0 "[Root.GetNationalUnityFocusDesc]"
EYR_national_unity_default_desc:0 "Though a servant's life can rightfully be described as full of toil, there is still pride in their work. Without devotion, their masters would not be as capable in making decisions, nor provide adequate rewards for their service. Instilling this mindset should be a rightful priority."
EYR_national_unity_alternate_desc:0 "Although our options are meagre, we are not useless. Fortunately, we have a powerful ally who can assist us in jump-starting our development. By showing our worth to [GRD.GetNameDef], they shall see it is worthwhile to share some of their industrial technology with us."
EYR_smash_arantiga:0 "Our Ancient Rivals"
EYR_smash_arantiga_desc:0 "Arantigans share our heritage of the firstborn, and as such relations have always been distrustful. Though Verenia has never had a great empire of its own to boast about, it would certainly provide us with great prestige to knock over the remainder of Arantigos' legacy."
EYR_buff_the_guard:0 "Verenian Guard Recruitment Expansion"
EYR_buff_the_guard_desc:0 "From frontline soldiers to uniform sewers, there are always available openings in the Verenian Guard. The past issue has been that we were unable to offer competitive salaries and benefits, but all that has changed with the end of the Struggle. A targeted campaign shall inspire many griffs to make use of themselves for a grand cause."
EYR_take_griffonstone:0 "Our Holy Birthplace"
EYR_take_griffonstone_desc:0 "Legends speak how our noble founder Kalem descended from the Hyperborean Mountains and settled the lands north of Lake Rumare.

It is a holy and righteous one, yet there are plenty who disagree on it being the best choice for Verenia as a whole.

Replenishment and recruitment of new regiments is quite difficult as a result, and the only reliable units are ones on the Duke's personal paycheck."

Due to a lack of evidence proving otherwise, this is held to be the truth, but few are concerned with its veracity. What is certain, however, is that Eyr has always favoured Verenia above all the other lands, with its abundant green fields and bountiful yields. Serene yet austere, the temple's clergy have served the griffons for centuries, and continue to be popular among the commonfolk for their charitable displays. It is also where most of the paladins live and ply their trade, resolute in their devotion to protect the holy sites."
EYR_verenia_holy_site_desc_435:0 "The Grand Temple of Arcturius in Rila has suffered greatly in recent decades. First taken over by republicans who made it a secular building dedicated to the "cult of reason", then taken over by the Discret dynasty that expelled the "hostile" Archonate from its home due to its close ties to the Griffonian Empire. The great fortress-temple has been stripped bare of anything valuable, but for the small number of clergy still living in it, this does not matter. Riches are but a distraction from their veneration of Arcturius, the god of war. Everything they've lost was merely a sacrifice in His name, one they were willing to make. As such, the temple now appears more like a military complex than a place of worship, knights guarding its gates, guns pointed at any who would disturb their peace again. With the new patronage of [EYR.GetNameDef], the Grand Temple can perhaps regain some of its lost power and glory."
EYR_verenia_holy_site_desc_674:0 "The Grand Temple of Eyr is hidden behind a large garden and covered in thick foliage, so its true size remains hidden from view. It is a large structure, one of the largest ones in Romau, home to the Archon of Eyr and hundreds of clergygriffons. Dedicated to the goddess of fertility, it is said that if all of Romau ran out of food, the Temple would still be able to feed itself thanks to its bountiful gardens. Romauans say there is a simple way to discover the well-being of the citizenry: in times of trouble, all griffons flock to the temple to get free bread. Attached to the building is also a huge maternity hospital, where thousands of griffons are born every year."
EYR_verenia_holy_site_desc_382:0 "The Grand Temple of Boreas stands in the middle of the vast city of Griffenheim, near the Imperial Palace. While the latter occupies more space, it consists of multiple structures. The Grand Temple is a single building, and by far the largest one in the entire metropolis. It is adorned with gilded domes shimmering in the sun, vast towers reaching high into the sky, and gargantuan statues of Boreas, the head of the griffon pantheon, the king of the gods. The Temple is not only the home of the Archon, but also of many leading figures of the cult of Boreas. Hundreds of clergygriffons work there, assisted by thousands of servants."
EYR_verenia_holy_site_desc_531:0 "Solarspike juts out like a massive claw of stone, reaching for the sun itself. Legend says that griffons first appeared on the slopes of this very mountain. First, Eyr gave them bodies, then Arcturius gave them the strength needed to use it, then Boreas gave them intelligence, elevating them from mere animals. Lastly, the fallen god Maar gave them souls, the gift of sapience which made them self-aware and capable of understanding the concept of death. Griffons hated Maar for this so-called gift and the other gods cast him down from the mountain, forbidding him from ever returning. Whether this legend is true or not, no one is allowed to climb or fly to the top of the holy mountain, as it is a sacred place where no mortal can go. Those who have tried were never seen again."
EYR_verenia_holy_site_desc_389:0 "Griffonstone is the oldest griffon city, built on the branches of a massive dead tree that grew on top of a mountain. It is so old, in fact, that it predates the written word and details of its foundation are unknown. The city is regarded as a residence of the three holiest griffon gods and as such is the second holiest site in the griffon faith after Solarspike. The Grand Temple of Boreas was once located here, before being moved to the new imperial capital of Griffenheim. This has done little to reduce the vast numbers of pilgrims who visit the city. Though suffering from disrepair and poverty after the collapse of the Griffonian Empire, Griffonstone has since been restored to its former grandeur."

Whether they felt that way out of misplaced pride or genuine contempt, none of them have held the honour of leading the Verenian Guard... until now.\n\nRoman considers himself a very pragmatic griffon. He sees a problem, and solves it in the most efficient way. He has little patience for the Duke's stalling strategy, and he has made that clear on many occasions. Even now, as the Captain of the Guard, he is forced to follow those orders, much to Roman's dismay. If he just could have been in charge when the whole rebellion started, it wouldn't have lasted for more than a year, or so he likes to think.\n\nNonetheless, the Guard-Captain is a capable leader, though not a creative one. His intense drilling standards ensure the common soldier is prepared for anything, who certainly don't need any poncy paladins! Perhaps, if Roman proves himself worthy by overcoming the vile secessionists, there could be a new rising star in Verenia.\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!: Bunnyshrubby"

It is widely believed that Eyr blessed the fields of Verenia, giving them an abundant bounty.\n\nPerhaps Eyr watched over Verena as well, given her unlikely rise to the respectful position of prelate. She never knew her parents, her only relation was a sister that disappeared in the chaos of 978. Subsisting purely on eleos of the local temple, her only comfort in life was dedicating herself to the Triarchy. A good and righteous cause, for in a world full of misery, it was the duty of all griffons to bring comfort to the weary.\n\nHer assignment in Verenia was only meant to be a temporary one, but local conditions made her stay permanent. Time and again, she championed for the cause of peace and reconciliation between the Three Houses, but her pleas and prayers were routinely ignored. Additionally, as the Prelature is officially in control of the Paladin Order, many of the local nobility distrust her, believing she's pursuing an agenda of her own. Already a stern and uncompromising griff of the robe, this treatment has steeled Verena's faith further. Only a scant few are righteous enough to pass her test of purity, and woe betide anygriff who end up the target of her admonishing gaze.\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!: Rari"

Now the proud paladin has been greatly humbled and turned into a tool of his former enemies. The great Cyrille would have preferred death over dishonour, yet somehow he was convinced to turn coat.\n\nHis new paladins-in-arms have not been overly kind to him, nor his masters in the Prelature. This coldness has only served to isolate him entirely, the previously warm and kind griff turned sour, bitter and not quite there with his rational senses. If there is one thing Cyrille still indulges in heavily, it is his love for battle, charging even more recklessly into the fray. Perhaps the only reason he still remains useful to the Knight-Commander.\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!: KaiserSauce"

If nothing else, she has endured them in spite of everything.\n\nWhen the revolution of 978 occurred, Sigrid was but a middle ranking paladin tasked with suppressing the riots. She had her disagreements with the actions, but ultimately the orders were followed. This earned Sigrid her first scars. What was going to be her crowning achievement — promotion to the exclusive ranks of the paladin-captains — turned sour as most of the Proud Ones followed Vincent Erie in his unlawful secession. Sigrid was the highest paladin remaining in the service of House Eyrie, which led to her ascension as commander... with very few of the benefits.\n\nDistrusted by the local nobility and restrained by the Prelature, the once proud paladin turned dour as she was consigned to sitting at a desk, unable to take the field as befitting of a warrior. If only something would change. However, she has found a measure of comfort in her friendship with the Prelate of Eyr, and the two of them are rarely seen separately.

Whereas others throw money like it grows on trees, and not even on actually useful things, she uses every legal and illegal trick in the book to keep the economy going.

EYR_Paladin_Commander_desc:0 "This individual leads the remnants of the Eyrian Household Paladins. For all the mistrust and suspicion given to them, they are still peerless in the art of warfare, leading knights like the heroic figures of old. However, they must still contend with limited resources and thus cannot lead as many companies as they would prefer."
EYR_Paladin:0 "Paladin von Eyrie"
EYR_Paladin_desc:0 "This foreigner leads one of the smaller paladin companies. Brave, dedicated and loyal, they can be counted on to provide their best in service to the Gods, but do not have the capabilities or resources to lead more than only a few infantry regiments."
EYR_guard_commander:0 "Wachhauptgreif"
EYR_guard_commander_desc:0 "This individual, while nominally only the "Captain of the Verenian Guard", is the household's overall leader of its armed forces. The modest title is a simple reflection of Verenian love for tradition, but does not make them any less capable of a commander, even with the limited resources at their disposal."
EYR_guardsgriff:0 "Wachoffizier"
EYR_guardsgriff_desc:0 "This individual is one of the officers of the Watch, otherwise known as the Verenian Guard. Ordinarily they would be little more than overseers for a city-based militia, but the demands of the Struggle had led them to command increasingly larger forces, yet still smaller compared to nations with more professionalised militaries. These officers are almost all of noble birth, their rank purchased with a commission."
EYR_Paladin_Commander_postwar:0 "Paladin-Kommandant von Verenia"
EYR_Paladin_Commander_postwar_desc:0 "This proud griffon leads the paladins of Verenia, now restored from their previously diminished form. Though they occasionally get into disputes with the Verenian Guard, there is little doubt of the sheer authority this individual has."
EYR_Paladin_shackled_Cyrille:0 "Paladin von Erie"
EYR_Paladin_shackled_Cyrille_desc:0 "Broken and captured, the former leader of the mutineering paladins has been conscripted for the righteous side. He does not appreciate his fate, and his habit of endangering griffs through reckless actions has only become more common."
EYR_Paladin_postwar:0 "Paladin von Verenia"
EYR_Paladin_postwar_desc:0 "One of the foreign knights that came in Verenia's greatest need, this griffon has embraced the paladins' proud traditions and leads their regiments to battle."
EYR_guard_commander_postwar:0 "Wachhauptgreif"
EYR_guard_commander_postwar_desc:0 "With the reunification of Verenia, the Guard-Captain has considerably expanded his reach over the armed forces. His title will remain humble, but his capabilities are far above his rank."
EYR_guardsgriff_postwar:0 "Wachoffizier"
EYR_guardsgriff_postwar_desc:0 "The officers of the Watch have received substantial reforms, allowing them to lead forces comparable in size to their peers. More surprisingly, the practice of purchasing commissions has been entirely abolished, a sense of merit creeping into their ranks."

duke_eyrie_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 9th of October, 957 in Calembourg\n§YTitle§!: Herzog von Eyrie\n\n§YBiography§!: As the wealth and splendour of Verenian dukes grew, so too did the size of their family. The children and siblings of the ruling duke would vie for favour, seeking to inherit the largest share of the estates, for under the old style of griffon inheritance, those not in the direct line of succession would receive a pittance, not enough to sustain a comfortable lifestyle as expected of noblegriffs. This cadet branch of House Eyrie would become known as House Erie over the years. The two branches co-existed in relative peace until the revolution of 978.\n\nIovinus was the only direct trueborn descendent from the late duke, Aldebrant, to survive the uprising. The years of war and stalemate have been very hard on him, turning what was once a carefree chick into a melancholic fatalist obsessed with duty. If he could, he would have left Verenia for a private city manor near Skyfall long ago. It is there where his wife and children reside, safe from Vincent's rebel armies. Nonetheless, Iovinus tries to do his best to keep the commonfolk happy, while keeping his unruly nobles in line. With patience and care, he knows he can make Verenia whole again.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
duke_eyrie_2_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 9th of October, 957 in Calembourg\n§YTitle§!: Herzog von Verenia\n\n§YBiography§!: At long last, the wealth and splendour of Verenian dukes has been restored! Iovinus Eyrie, the true heir of his father's legacy, has ousted his rivals and united the realm under his evenclawed rule. A return to normalcy he has desired for so very long, yet he has grown rather tired of rulership.\n\nBut not all is as Iovinus would like. Though the Struggle has ended, the problems that wrapped themselves around Verenia have scarcely vanished. The nobles scheme, the peasants gripe, and his family demand attention he has denied them for a rather long time. While he has entrusted a good deal of management to his most trusted advisor, it will take decisive leadership to preserve Verenian independence.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Kleowolfy"
EYR_archduke_eyrie_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 9th of October, 957 in Calembourg\n§YTitle§!: Erzherzog von Reich\n\n§YBiography§!: Iovinus Eyrie always considered himself to be a humble griff, not wanting for more (besides his love of the aesthetic), yet circumstances have conspired to give him everything he never wanted. Once Verenia lowered their banners to the Grovers, now the Verenian banners fly over the palace in Griffenheim. A most spectacular achievement, worthy of a new Arantigos!\n\nYet precious little has changed in his life. Responsibilities were delegated to those trustworthy, and while he has accepted a splendid title reflecting his success, Iovinus has no intent to claim the imperial throne. With all the excitement he's had in the past thirty years, he believes firmly that the Archduke could use some rest and indulgence, but should his bliss be interrupted, he won't hesitate to restore the proper order.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Kleowolfy"

Not that it terribly bothered him, for he had always considered himself to be a better leader than the Duke. With his conspiring clique comprised of officers and browbeaten nobles, he'll show Iovinus that Verenia can be far better and stronger.\n\nOr so he likes to think. His position is a tenuous one and already undermined by opportunistic nobility who see this as a prime chance to seize more power for themselves. Should the so-called Great Captain fail to corral the scheming griffs who were his recent allies, they will not hesitate to enact their preferred choice of order. And nothing would be worse than another Struggle over Verenia.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Bunnyshrubby"
duke_eyrie_gen_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 9th of October, 957 in Calembourg\n§YTitle§!: Herzog von Eyrie\n\n§YBiography§!§L: As the wealth and splendour of Verenian dukes grew, so too did the size of their family. The children and siblings of the ruling duke would vie for favour, seeking to inherit the largest share of the estates, for under the old style of griffon inheritance, those not in the direct line of succession would receive a pittance, not enough to sustain a comfortable lifestyle as expected of noblegriffs. This cadet branch of House Eyrie would become known as House Erie over the years. The two branches co-existed in relative peace until the revolution of 978.\n\nToo focused on running the matters of state, Iovinus only provides an advisory function when it comes to military leadership. He has an acceptable grasp of strategy, and he has certainly read The Conquests of Arantigos like any good ruler, but Iovinus prefers to delegate the responsibility to the Captain of the Verenian Guard and the Paladin-Commander of House Eyrie.\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

gretel_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 31st of January, 959 in Calembourg\n\n§YBiography§!: One could have asked the merchants of Calembourg why did they persist staying in a region that was so hostile to their trade, and the simple answer was stubbornness. Gretel Birne was one of them, doing her part as a griffon chasing the next opportunity, and it came in the form of the Republican Revolution of 978. It was something of a gamble, but what everygriff could agree is that they would definitely be better off without the oppressive nobility filching their profits.\n\nAs everygriff knows, the gamble was a failure and most of them paid the ultimate price, not carrying a single idol they've earned to Tartarus. Gretel was one of the few lucky ones to escape, doing her best to lay low, which unfortunately included having to sell most of her valuables as a peasant with finery would be too conspicuous. This only served to increase the bitterness she felt for the ruling classes, not helped by witnessing all her friends and revolutionaries be cut down.\n\nNow those same elites have made their last mistake, and Gretel led those who remained from the initial revolt, as well as a new generation of disgruntled peasants to a vengeance that was long in the making.\n\n§YPortrait By§!:"

It was I who should have succeeded to rulership after the horrid republican uprising, which left many family members dead, but he would not concede to the fact that it is House Erie that is subservient to House Eyrie.\n\nNow, there's been little peace, and even less respite. I watched many young and promising griffons march to the riverfront, only to learn that they've perished. It is their duty to serve their liege lord, yes, but I do not wish to throw lives away. None of this should have happened. Lady Amelinda, she helped with her surprising defection, but remained a mystery with her intentions. Her daughter Katrina will have to see reason in the end. It is my Gods given right to rule Verenia, and restore her splendour to how it was.\n\nThe commoners despise us, yet more backlash comes from my supposedly subservient nobles. Instead of wisely digging in, time and again they've wasted our power on futile attacks. Worse still, they distrust the paladins, Verenia's sworn guardians.\n\nThis story has been dragged on for too long. How will it end? Nobody but the Gods know, and they don't talk."

eyrie.2.t:0 "Defence Of The Realm"
eyrie.2.d:0 "Iovinus was not pleased with the situation he ended up in. Yes, the impending attack was most worrisome, but he was far more happier with Guard-Captain von Grieslein, who had dutifully followed his attrition strategy, than the new Guard-Captain Eitelkeit, who was among the most vocal ones clamouring for a decisive strike. In spite of the fact that all previous attempts had failed, they continued insisting... and now one of them was in charge of the war planning.\n\n"Let us hear what you have prepared, Guard-Captain." While the Duke could overrule his subordinates, it would undoubtedly cause unnecessary friction. This was not a time for arguments, and they would either work together or die together.\n\nIn his tightly fitting uniform, the Guard-Captain looked very much like an imposing force that was not to be crossed with. Nodding wordlessly, he would stand up to present his strategy over the detailed map of the Aranti riverline. "Mein Herzog, with the limited time and resources at our disposal, there is little other recourse but to continue using our existing plans. However, with the help from our informants on the other side, orders have been prepared to reinforce areas we expect to bear the brunt of their attack." It was short, brief and to the point.\n\nIt was a surprisingly... reasonable course, and Iovinus could not offer any protests in the matter. The other, lower ranking officers of the Guard more or less agreed with their Captain, and only thing left was clearing some minor concerns. The Duke dearly hoped there would be no insubordination this time. He still remembered the last one."
eyrie.2.a:0 "Endure, we shall once more."

eyrie.3.t:0 "Overstretched Demands"
eyrie.3.d:0 "It was a straightforward plan: have the rabble crash themselves upon the riverline defences, then strike back once they were sufficiently weakened with losses and peasant grumbling.\n\nYet it turned out almost not at all as intended! Certainly, no plan survives first contact with the enemy, but as soon as they had the opportunity, the Watch Officers reneged on it. He dearly wondered what he had done to deserve such contempt and disrespect. What was going on in their thick bird skulls to act contrary to his well laid tactics?\n\nThus Iovinus was forced into making an act himself, and through his contacts west of the Aranti, he knew Vincent would be willing to accept another ceasefire. What a farce this whole conflict turned out to be! The comforts of his warm room turned out to be less than pleasing as he awaited for his so-called loyal retinue to arrive, for their well-needed and much deserved scoldings."
eyrie.3.a:0 "Humiliation is the best teacher."

eyrie.4.t:0 "A Ceasefire Offer"
eyrie.4.d:0 "Vincent was not pleased in the slightest to have yet another invasion bogged down in a stalemate, but a gift from Boreas would show up at his doorstep today: that idiot Iovinus decided he was tired of playing war and wanted a ceasefire. Now ordinarily that would earn him a firm and sound rejection, but the sad truth that he heard yesterday from Cyrille was that House Erie was not doing too well either.\n\nEven better, there was an indemnity promised in this! Despite gaining nothing from this but a long list for burial, it sated his spite. However, things would have to change for next time, and Vincent resolved to take decisive action. First order of business was to get his underlings in order: undoubtedly they did a fair share of their own mistakes."
eyrie.4.a:0 "Take that, Iovinus! Sheepherding reprobate!"

eyrie.5.t:0 "Invasion Repulsed!"
eyrie.5.d:0 "Iovinus believed his plan to be satisfying, and for the most part it did: Erian attacks amounted to nothing, yet counterattacks fizzled out just as much. Many meetings were held with his command staff, but nothing could be decisively concluded as to why Vincent's rabble resisted so fiercely. Fortunately, a way out of this mess presented itself today.\n\nHis "dearest" sibling was tired of war and wanted yet another ceasefire, and offered a great deal of idols to make it so. If he were in a better position, it would be laughed out of the room, yet this would have to suffice for the time being. The warmongers would complain, but even they would have to concede that the situation is untenable. Now he would have to debrief with his officers and determine what could they have done better... undoubtedly they committed a fair share of their own mistakes."
eyrie.5.a:0 "Another spectacular failure from Vincent."

eyrie.6.t:0 "On A Minute's Notice"
eyrie.6.d:0 "When the previous dukes moved from the fortress outside of Calembourg to the ostentatiously named "grand palace" (more of a fancier manor home, really) inside the city, they intended to keep it purely as a private residence. Practicality, however, resulted in a different outcome, and now Iovinus was taking a leisurely stroll to where Freya, the house treasurer, oversaw a small army of idol counters that kept his state fiscally solvent.\n\nThe large hall, dubbed the "administration quarter", was full of overly busy griffs. Desks were full of papers, and in some cases idols, assisted by primitive machinery that helped lessen the burden of mathematical calculations. If only everygriff could work so tirelessly and efficiently for his cause. Iovinus was quick to find the lady in charge, helpfully standing in the middle of the room.\n\n"How you manage this on a daily basis is most impressive, Freya. Where would House Eyrie be without you?" Large requests needed a decent amount of praise, of course.\n\nThe neatly dressed griff looked away from her clipboard, beaming with joy at her Duke. "Why thank you kindly, Iovinus!" He appreciated that she was comfortable enough to be informal. "There's nothing quite like fixing issues and trying to make them better. It's an endless chore, but the satisfaction is worthwhile. Now, what brings you here? Not much time for idle chat."\n\nShort sigh. "War's coming again, Freya. The mobilisation isn't happening quickly enough and I need you and your abilities to make it happen. My sources in House Erie say there's but a few weeks left." Why waste words trying to hide things.\n\nHer enthusiasm momentarily faltered, but she would turn around and pick up a few forms. "You should have come to me earlier, my Duke, but it won't be an issue. I trust I'm allowed to make the necessary expenditures?" If there's anygriff he trusted to spend money, it was Freya."
eyrie.6.a:0 "A real miracle maker."

eyrie.7.t:0 "At The Summit Of Eyr"
eyrie.7.d:0 "The disused fortress was the highest point near Calembourg, but within the city itself, the place of honour belonged to Eyr's temple which stood upon a hill. This was where Iovinus was headed today, despite the protests of his vassals: he wanted the paladins to help repulse Vincent's assault, and he simply couldn't mobilise enough of the regular forces in time.\n\nThe interior was ascetic in accordance with divine mandate, yet comforting in a way that was difficult to describe. Iovinus would briefly close his eyes and exhale, his worries briefly fading, before looking around for the griff on his mind. It was easy to find her, with that distinct circlet and hood, as he passed between several attendees who paid their Duke no heed.\n\nBut the prelate was occupied in conversation with her paladin protector, who sensed a figure approaching and turned her head around. "It seems we have an important visitor, Verena." Said paladin lowered her head deferentially, moving next to Verena, who regarded Iovinus with her usual cold gaze.\n\n"That we do, Sigrid. What can the Prelature do for our Herzog von Eyrie today?" Unlike her companion, Verena did not offer any sort of respectful gesture. It didn't bother him in the slightest for Iovinus was used to her unyielding behaviour.\n\n"There'll be another invasion soon, Prelate. I need the paladins to rebuff this attack." Short and to the point, as he always liked it. The pair exchanged glances and whispered between themselves, but he could tell Sigrid was welcoming the prospect of battle. Quickly would Verena address Iovinus again.\n\n"Are you prepared to meet the recent requests, mein Herzog?" A small nod. "Even knowing there will be displeasure at the court?" A more hesitant nod. "Then we are prepared to serve in the defence of your cause.""

eyrie.8.d_helped_before:0 ""What you've accomplished last time was nothing short of spectacular, Freya. What good would all my soldiers be if they didn't show up for battle?" Indeed, Iovinus was most pleased with her work. Even though it felt very much like a cruel, twisted joke that the conflict petered out before it could ever properly begin, the only actual difference being how many memorial services occurred in the past few weeks. At least somegriffs were doing their job.\n\nThe good administrator smiled at the well deserved praise, holding her delicate glasses in a claw. "My Duke, I'm just doing what you're paying me to do. Although I do not deny that the effort required is great... it all turned out good in the end. If you can call the current situation 'good', that is." The spectacles found their way back to the tired expression.\n\n"I assure you, once this is all done and settled, we are all going on a vacation. I feel no less weary than you..." Long exhale, followed by a shake of his head. "Now then, I believe you had some good news for me, Freya?"\n\n"That is correct, Iovinus, the tax collectors and other assorted idol makers have concluded their rounds, and we have money to work with again. I've already deducted the amount needed for necessary future expenses, but there is still a sizeable amount remaining to be spent at your leisure." A paper containing several underlined numbers was passed, and the Duke briefly indulged a daydream what he would do with such a generous sum. First, the cold reality."
eyrie.8.d_no_help:0 "Iovinus felt slightly guilty over not giving more time for his favourite advisor, but circumstances simply got in the way. Nonetheless, he was always more than happy to be sitting in Freya's private office, sharing a fresh cup of tea and scones together. It always gave him a slight chuckle as he noticed that the room was hastily ordered into something more presentable.\n\n"I am no fan of carnage or violence, but I have to admit it was quite the sight to witness our paladins marching through the city streets, and out to war." As always, Freya multitasked her conversations with doing paperwork. "Please accept my apologies again for not meeting the mobilisation quotas in time, my Duke."\n\nIndeed, the paladins were quite spectacular in their armour, and of course their performance. Yet it did nothing to dissuade the nobility that they shouldn't look down on them. "And again, Freya, it was not your fault. Personally, I could have done much better myself to spread the information around, and give you plenty of time needed. Still, it turned out good enough, even if nothing has changed in the end." And that hurt the most. Trapped, with nowhere to go.\n\n"Very well, Iovinus, I will accept your word as the truth. The reason I've called for you today is quite simple: our idol gatherers have done their work, and we have funds to work with, even after reserving the necessary amounts for future expenses. How it shall be spent, I leave the choice to you." A paper containing several underlined numbers was passed, and the Duke briefly indulged a daydream what he would do with such a generous sum. First, the cold reality."

eyrie.9.t:0 "The Divine's Representative"
eyrie.9.d_helped_before:0 ""Turn your gaze, Verena, for our noble guest returns." Iovinus briefly wondered if these two were joined at the wing, given how rare it was to not see them together. "I shall return to my duties post-haste." With a servile bow, Sigrid brushed past the Duke and left the temple. If she suffered any exertions from the recent battle, the Knight-Commander did not show it.\n\n"Eyr's blessings upon you, mein Herzog. Did the paladins' performance impress you? It is such a pity that the righteous and just are considered untrustworthy by the envious." The reasons why the nobility wanted nothing to do with the knightly order was more nuanced than simple grudges, although it did seem petty like that at times.\n\n"We owe them our freedom, and may they recuperate well in the following days. Please extend me an invitation for the upcoming festival, but there is a more pressing matter at claw." The prelate's stern expression only allowed a brief change. "I like the current situation as much as you do. We can't persist in this Struggle forever, and I am willing to disregard the opinions of the 'envious', as you say, if it means putting an end to this farce. May I count on your and the paladins' support in the coming days?" It was as much pleading as Iovinus could allow himself.\n\nThe response didn't take long. "What you ask is unnecessary. The Prelature has always been at your beck and call, it is merely the unfortunate circumstances that prevent us from working together. To show our commitment, I will arrange for a donation to your cause. Make best use of it, for Eyr does not appreciate those who squander." This was... far better than Iovinus expected, but he needed to make sure none of his dealings were heard back at the court."
eyrie.9.d_no_help:0 "Iovinus could not recall the last time he visited the temple, and that fact shamed him; considering himself a rather reverent griff, he could do better. Nonetheless, the cold stone floors and the faint scent of fragrant smoke put his mind at ease. He should definitely spend more time here, away from all the worries and nagging.\n\nThere, the hooded figure waited for him, alongside a paladin in shining armour. To the business at claw, then. "My gratitude for agreeing to meet at such short notice, Prelate. I think we can both agree that the current situation cannot continue, lest we have a repeat of 978. Furthermore, I am keenly aware there are difficulties preventing our cooperation... but that can be circumvented. Can I count on your support in the upcoming difficult days?" If they were surprised by how quickly Iovinus got to his demands, they weren't showing it. After a short while, he would get the prelate's response.\n\n"We welcome your change of heart, mein Herzog, though it certainly seemed that you had no need for our assistance thus far. Regardless, the Prelature is committed to the success of the true heirs to the Verenian legacy, and to that end I will prepare a donation to your cause. Do not allow the wicked and envious to squander this generosity." Could it truly be this easy? "However, if you expect further support, we expect in return a proper show of dedication." The previously silent Knight-Commander, gleaming in her panoply, nodded in agreement with her superior.\n\nIt was never straightforward."

eyrie.10.t:0 "Inspecting The Verenian Guard"
eyrie.10.d:0 "All things considered, the losses in the scuffle were not all that debilitating. The wounded were tended to, fortifications restaffed, and usable equipment from the fallen was scavenged. The most pressing concern, however, was giving the soldiery a much needed morale boost. To that end, Iovinus organised several inspections with the Guard-Captain (which he did not relish, given recent events), but the appearance of unity was paramount.\n\nThus they walked together past lines and lines of soldiers, standing at attention with their rifles raised. Iovinus had to admire their discipline, their resolve, and of course their stylish dress uniforms. Too bad they did little good at the frontline... "At ease, griffons!" The practised tone of a disciplinarian had the order produce a satisfying effect. With that, Roman turned to face him for a word in private.\n\n"Edler Herr, the Verenian Guard is a trained and professional force. It does not need foreigners or paladins to achieve our goals." If only its commanders were equally restrained in their judgement. Nonetheless, he accepted the fact that the regular forces were more than capable, given how they bravely stood their ground recently."

eyrie.11.t:0 "Simpleminded Superstition"
eyrie.11.d:0 "An average peasant possesses enough smarts to live about their daily business, but when it comes to nuance, they're sadly lacking in this regard. In recent times, many reports have been received about the rabble claiming ominous portents, that "the end is nigh", and even cases of mass hysteria, which has negatively resulted on productivity. As it is plain to see, the world is still here, and Maar's fires have not enveloped the sky.\n\nWho is behind spreading this panic remains unclear, but some whispers talk about the local priesthood agitating the crowd during sermons. However, there are plenty of other leads available, meaning it will take some time before this farce can be dispersed."

eyrie.12.d:0 ""My Duke, you know it, I know it, everygriff knows it. Infrastructure maintenance is one of the lowest priorities in these holds, and the roads are full of holes. On rainy days they turn to mud." Freya decided not to mince words. "I understand that our claws are full of expenses, but is there absolutely nothing that can be spared to alleviate the issue by at least some margin?"\n\nIn truth Iovinus wouldn't know anything about the condition of roads given that he hadn't left Calembourg for at least over a year, but this did sound quite alarming. But before he could issue his agreement, the Guard-Captain offered a rebuttal.\n\n"Let us not be so hasty, noble lord!" And you could have some better manners, Roman. "What our treasurer says is correct. However, your larger concern should be our railways and trains. Warfare as it is these days depends heavily on quick transportation of forces, and even in our static situation it cannot be disregarded. I feel regret that our populace has to rely on such poor roads—" Did he truly feel that way? "—but you have my personal promise that I'll fund their improvement after our final victory." With that, he raised a claw to his chest, making a pledging gesture.\n\nTime was short, idols were short, and decisions had to be made quickly. Iovinus ruminated on his options."

How could this happen, I thought everything was under control?! How will we maintain our war measures if we can't even feed our peasants?" While the Duke didn't know much about international commerce or production line capacities, it was painfully clear an embargo was very bad news, especially for his impoverished lands.\n\n"W-we don't know! Nothing has changed in our agreements, this must be Iovinus' scheme..."\n\nVincent's eyes narrowed as he immediately charted a very rational and reasonable conclusion how that scoundrel could have plotted this. Of course it's all Iovinus' fault! "Get back to work, servant, and figure out some way to fix this." Just like that, the griff scampered, leaving him to brood and ponder an even more cruel vengeance once he got east of the Aranti..."

Undoubtedly somegriff will be complaining about her presence. With a claw pressed to his forehead, he began:\n\n"Guard-Captain Eitelkeit... I hope there is some very good reason for why I had to intervene and stop this conflict before a riot broke outside these walls. What sort of excuse do you have for yourself and your underlings?" He couldn't quite match the tone his wife made when she lectured their children, but it would have to suffice for the time being.\n\nOne could hear nary but the whistling of the wind, before eventually a response came. "Noble Duke, your strategy was flawed. Sitting and waiting wouldn't have done us any good, and we were running out of ammunition for our artillery, thus doing nothing would have only resulted in—"\n\nBut Iovinus would have none of it. "Do you consider me ignorant, Guard-Captain? This is precisely why my orders were to stand down and let them break ourselves at the river crossings. We didn't mobilise enough griffs or equipment for attacks, and we have nothing to show for these three months besides a casualty list that's almost as bad as theirs." He expected much more pushback, yet this time all were left stunned and speechless. The less guilty ones looked in his direction, apprehension in their features. "Let it be a lesson for you all: I have nothing but the best interests of my House in mind, and I will not tolerate further acts of disloyalty.

Nogriff wanted this Struggle, yet they were all chained by it, seemingly forever, the burden of responsibility crushing even the most resolute griff.\n\nBut he didn't despair yet. What kept Iovinus' thoughts steady were his dearest wife's words, written on fine vellum. He went over them so many times, he could recite it by heart, recall with perfection the subtle quirks in her griffonage. The contents were most mundane, but it pleased him to no end knowing she and their chicks were safe and sound. Lothra and Lorien... his daughters were his greatest treasure, far more than anything in this accursed Verenia.\n\nThey were so far away, though.

At least such a hesitation did not occur when justice was being dispensed: lawbreakers were guilty not just in the eyes of their betters, but the Gods as well.\n\nThus he took a seat at the throne of his father, the chamber filled and awaiting his word. Roman stood by his side, the immaculate uniform firmly pressed as always, acting as his advisor in all matters of state and justice. It was Iovinus' choice to have him make decisions in his stead, and he tended to leave what he perceived as less popular outcomes to the Markgraf.\n\n"All rise! The Duke of Eyrie and the liege lord of all Verenia has declared this session of the court to be open. Petitioners will approach one by one and present their requests." Roman's booming baritone stiffened anygriff who seemed to be dozing off, before he turned to Iovinus and continued in a more sotto voce. "The griffs were pre-approved in advance to avoid a repeat of last time, but there is still a sizeable number waiting. If you feel this to be beneath your dignity, I shall carry on with the proceedings in your name."\n\nIovinus peered ahead and confirmed that yes, there were plenty of both commoners and upper crusts waiting. As much as he wished to slip away from this droll doldrum, it was not a good idea to depend on Roman too much. Publicly overriding his decisions could result in further disobedience, yet nogriff would question their Herzog in this very room."

Iovinus already pitied the ragged appearance, but the appearance of impassivity was paramount. Roman continued where the herald left off. "He stands guilty of having stolen from the ducal granaries, and attempted to flee and resist arrest. The punishment for stealing from the crown is death, but Konrad has used his right to plead for mercy and lenience." Those last few words came out like an insult from Roman's beak.\n\n"This appears to be an issue without a mystery. Konrad, what do you have to say in defence of your actions?" What will it be this time.\n\n"M-mercy, your lordship! My family was starving as our harvest failed this year. We have nothing to eat, please spare me!" The broken griff dropped to the floor as he cried and begged in-between unintelligible words. Iovinus looked around as all the high and mighty looked with faces of disgust, but proper bearing prevented them from voicing their displeasures.\n\n"Spare yourself some dignity, Konrad, for I have made my decision." One last hopeful look from the miserable being."

With a bow, the finely dressed griff introduced himself.\n\n"On behalf of the Merchant's Guild, I thank you for allowing me this opportunity to present our plea. My Duke, as you are well aware, the stringent tariffs placed on all mercantile activity has severely hampered any growth and thus led to the current sorry state. We understand that you require the funds for the war effort, but if these taxes were lowered, it would be a benefit to Verenia as a whole." As the idol pincher began to inundate the conversation with statistics and economic theory, he was cut off by Roman.\n\n"I would advise against this petition, my Duke. The tariffs are meant to protect our feeble industry from foreigners and their unequal deals, even at the expense of our domestic growth. This could be discussed again after we crush the secessionists, but now is not the time."\n\n"Or perhaps our obliging nobility could pay a larger share to the treasury." The merchant quipped in a very helpful and sarcastic manner, earning a glare from most of the room's occupants. Iovinus had to admit he considered the idea from time to time, but he knew it would be resisted at every pawstep.\n\n"That'll be enough, Arvin. Here is what the Court has decided." So many eyes staring at him."

eyrie.22.d:0 ""The Court will be hearing a dispute between House Weingut and House von Geisslerg, loyal vassals of House Eyrie." Important names, thus all the more important decision. Two griffs, in all their finery, took place before the Duke, glaring daggers at each other all the while. Iovinus accepted their well-meaning words and motioned for the left griff to begin.\n\n"My lord and duke of Eyrie, I urge you to resolve this issue once and for all. My family, the House of Weingut, have served yours for many years, and we only wish to continue doing so." Quite the effort for flattery, yes. "House von Geisslerg has promised ours a parcel of land as part of a dowry, but they have reneged on their agreement. We only ask you to uphold a fair and honest agreement."\n\nCould it really be so simple? "What does House von Geisslerg say to this?"\n\nThe right griffon, who was having the most incredulous look for a while, spoke. "The words are true, but what my equal forgot to mention is that their bride turned out to be a liar and a cheater with no respect for marital vows. We do not consider ourselves bound to an agreement where one side is blatantly disho—"\n\n"How dare you speak of my sister like this! I'll have your feathers plucked!" But before the adoring rivals could swing claws at each other, Roman's harsh tone turned them into meek chicks. What to do? The Geisslergs were one of the less problematic vassals, yes, but they were poorer compared to the Weinguts. However, the latter were obvious lackeys of the Eitelkeits, and Roman didn't need more influence in this court."

eyrie.23.t:0 "Soldier's Duty"
eyrie.23.d:0 ""The Court will be hearing a case against Wilfried, a soldier of the Guard accused of desertion." Peculiar. Why was this brought before him, instead of having the Guard-Captain resolve it himself? The bound griffon did not seem particularly frightened. Roman took over from the herald. "Noble lord, Wilfried was found in uniform, roughly four days of walking distance away from his post. He did not offer resistance when confronted, and confessed to abandoning his station. The penalty for desertion are the gallows." It's a harsh society we live in, thought Iovinus as he allowed the guardsgriff to explain himself.\n\n"Your majesty—" Wrong form of address, but irrelevant. "—I was not deserting. After the last war, I heard that my family's home was torched by Erian marauders. I simply had to reassure myself that it was not the case, and thank Boreas it wasn't. I asked several times for a leave and it was denied each time, there was no intention to desert." At least, Vincent didn't ruin this griff's life, but that hardly alleviated the gruff captain.\n\n"You dishonour everygriffon who serves the Sunlight Shield, Wilfried. Do you think you're alone in having family?" But before the accused could retort, another quipped in.\n\n"Do we not know the meaning of mercy? It cannot be forgotten even during times of war." Verena in her distinctive garb raised voice from beyond Iovinus' sight. "Our soldiers must be given the opportunity to tend to their loved ones."\n\n"This does not concern you, Prelate—", harsh was Roman's tone, "—and you have no right to meddle in temporal affairs. I would suggest that you keep to your proselytising elsewhere." Iovinus was quick to defuse the argument, as this was a place of dignity, and declared his judgement."

eyrie.24.d:0 "Something was amiss. The vassals always had the right of convening the Ducal Court, but it was something they weren't fond of doing, lest they received another browbeating from Iovinus. But today was different and thus he was waiting in the grand palace's throne room as it slowly filled up. In the crowd he saw many important griffs, the heads of houses Bördsdorff, Freud, zu Falkendorff, Weingut... and of course, house Eitelkeit.\n\nThe mystery didn't take long to unravel as the Guard-Captain took the stand. "Edler Herr, we the Adel are severely concerned with your recent actions. Thus we are giving you one chance to correct this mistake: follow our advice or there'll be blood." The rest stood together, their expressions stern and not at all interested in a compromise.\n\nWords failed to leave Iovinus' beak. It didn't seem there was a way out of this, and if there was any support for him, it was not present in the room. He wished, he sorely wished, in a grand display of anger and spite, to put their threat to a test... but he hated Vincent more than he was angry at these traitors right now. To say nothing of the impact this will have in the future, if they actually prevailed in the Struggle. Sad as it was, there was no choice but to agree."

eyrie.25.d:0 "Just when the Duke was starting to get restless from sitting so much on his backside, there finally came relief. "This session of the Ducal Court has come to an end." Thus loudly proclaimed the herald, and relieved expressions could be seen far and wide. Except on those who didn't reach the front of the line, and ended up being roughly escorted from the premises. They'll have to try again in a few months.\n\nAll in all, Iovinus felt mostly satisfied with the outcomes. He did what he considered to be most just, and there was no commotion like the dreaded last time. The memory still lingered painfully in the mind... But enough of that, there was a most splendid roast waiting in the dining hall, his favourite! Just what he needed after a long day of work, and there were plenty more of those to come."

eyrie.26.t:0 "Our Valuable Possessions"
eyrie.26.d:0 "The Duke of Eyrie was many things, but that which he took pride in was his love of aesthetics. Paintings, sculptures, coinage, ancient instruments, and even jewellery: whatever pleased the eye was precious to Iovinus. Of course, he was aware of not letting his weakness control him and thus only spent on such when he could reasonably afford them. Most of the time...\n\nThus it made it all harder that he was now deciding what to pack away to be sold. Iovinus hoped it would set an example for the others, but the sad truth was that the conflict needed to be funded one way or the other. This particular one was simply the least demanding for the others, but that didn't make it any easier for him as he placed a shroud over a particularly dusty painting, mentally beating himself for letting it lay forgotten in a basement.\n\nOne particular item caught his attention. It was a simple silver goblet, decorated with a tree motif over its surface, with a precious gemstone embedded in the middle. Hardly the most valuable piece of a dragon's hoard, but what made it so sentimental is that it was Corinna's gift for their ten years of marriage together. Oh the happier times...\n\nIt had to go, but maybe he could get it back later on. Iovinus was friends with a reputable dealer in arts, so perhaps she would keep it stashed till he could buy it again. But first, he had to decide on what exactly would he spend all these future idols into."
eyrie.26.a:0 "Invest in domestic capabilities."

eyrie.26.c:0 "There's a mercenary contract available..."

eyrie.27.t:0 "Spectacle At The Grand Palace"
eyrie.27.d:0 "Perhaps it was one of his many obligations, but Iovinus hated hosting parties for the nobility. It felt very much like a waste of his evening, he did not enjoy dancing in the slightest, the idols could be better spent elsewhere, and worst of all, there would be barely anything to eat! If it were up to the Duke, there would be a simple feast, yet expectations demanded otherwise.\n\nThus the dust and cobwebs of the great hall were cleared, invitations were sent, and everything was ready for a night of empty words and no small amount of debauchery. If there was one good thing about Vincent, it was the fact that his tantrum allowed Iovinus to indefinitely cancel these frivolities.\n\nStill, there was a sense of comfort, having a night where he didn't have to do anything but smile and offer compliments. As expected, all the nobles in their finery were attending, even the famously reclusive ones. Besides ensuring that his glass was always full, Iovinus had little of note to say about the evening. It went pretty much as he imagined, with the mingling and dancing, and thankfully the drinking gave him an excuse to retire early.\n\nIf only Corinna were here. She'd make it much more enjoyable."
eyrie.27.a:0 "It's good living, at least."

eyrie.28.t:0 "Vengeance Long In Making"
eyrie.28.d:0 "For quite some time, Gretel wondered why she still went to the secret meetings with her fellow "comrades". In truth she had very little affection for the tenets of "communism", regarding it at best as a means to an end, but it was certainly better than brooding alone in her squalid home. Plus, there were always luxuries in form of strong drink and warm meals.\n\nToday, however, was different. Fervour and dissatisfaction were growing and nogriff could ignore it. Thus the meeting was packed full, griffs Gretel could only scarcely recall seeing before, and the topic concerned itself with the uprising they were planning. It would seem that the beloved Duke was not so adored anymore, but she still remembered how the last revolt turned out, and thought all this to be very optimistic.\n\n"Gretel, you've been here longer than almost any of us. Will you lead the rebellion?" This clear question broke her out of the bored stupor she's been maintaining thus far, and she had to stop herself from instinctively nodding. Why her? Was everygriff so easily duped? On the other claw, this was the perfect opportunity. Revenge! Everything that was denied to her all those years ago! Base instincts took over, and Gretel readily agreed to be the people's champion."
eyrie.28.a:0 "The revolution will be avenged!"
eyrie.28.b:0 "Stop this racket! Immediately!"

eyrie.29.t:0 "Minor Disturbance"
eyrie.29.d:0 "Iovinus was still nursing a hangover after that awful evening (in truth it wasn't that bad, he simply hated wasting time) when he received a report from a scribe clamouring for his attention.\n\n"Forgive me for disturbing you, Lord Iovinus, but there's been a riot in the city and..."\n\nThe Duke was quick to interrupt even though it pained him, and he was still feeling the aftereffects. "What?! Send in the Watch, how could this happen, why was I not informed of this, who is behind this—"\n\n"Please calm yourself, mein Herzog!" Iovinus' reputation for stoicism made griffs fearful whenever he deigned to raise his voice. "You ordered not to be disturbed and we followed your demands. Somehow, the city dwellers found out about the party you were hosting and demanded to know why were the idols not invested in more productive matters." Ah, a like-minded griff. "One thing led to another, and well, they're not very happy with you, my lord."\n\nNow he was truly vindicated. Next occasion somegriff suggests this waste of money, they'll be thrown to the rabble! Yet after sufficiently calming down and thanking the good bureaucrat for his hard work, Iovinus wondered how exactly word of this got out in the masses. Special care was made to keep the event a secret, and still... Something to solve in a less troubled time."
eyrie.29.a:0 "What a bother."

eyrie.30.t:0 "Where Do The Supplies Come From?"
eyrie.30.d:0 ""War is a dreadfully expensive thing, my Duke. Even I can only do so much to alleviate the cost." Iovinus was receiving an update from his most capable advisor, as they strolled together down Calembourg's main street. It was good to get outside of the stuffy grand palace once in a while, and the armed guard ensured nogriff would try to accost them. However, there was still a sense of unease.\n\n"I do not blame you for this, Freya. You're doing all that you can." His eyes took notice of an abandoned manor home, its carcass picked clean of whatever valuables that once hid inside. At least, that's what all the broken windows suggested. A look askance confirmed that she saw the eyesore as well.\n\n"It's a shame our city is like this, but I hope we can one day together see it refurnished and beautiful. But before I get carried away, you were asking me about my... covert operations. I've only scratched the surface of this underground market and the firearms we're getting to supplement our production have been arriving on time. I can try digging deeper into it, but it would come at the expense of my regular responsibilities, and might not give fruit, either." She'd look down on the ground in contemplation.\n\nIovinus knew the troops were always lacking in weaponry, and having more of those would definitely boost his prospects. On the other claw, they could make do with what they already have, and instead instruct Freya to make some long term preparations for the benefit of Verenia."
eyrie.30.a:0 ""Focus on our future, Freya.""

eyrie.31.t:0 "Officer Training Program"
eyrie.31.d:0 "While the Proud Ones of the Triarchy, or simply the paladin order, had a had a long and storied history dating to the founding days of Verenia, the Verenian Guard was very much its unwanted relative, never particularly notable or special. Certainly, the Struggle had given it the opportunity to prove themselves in valorous combat, which they've certainly done, but its modernisation and expansion cannot occur on any major scale till the conflict is resolved.\n\nThus Iovinus decided to make the first step, and invite a few friends he had from Herzland. They've attended various military academies, and with a little compensation they would certainly be more than happy to teach his hotheaded commanders a few lessons in strategy. Of course, he would recuse himself from the event, as Iovinus felt he wasn't deserving of such honour, nor did he have the time.\n\nWith so little time left before Vincent struck again, the program had to be done in an accelerated fashion. The question was, who should receive the majority of the instructors' attention?"
eyrie.31.a:0 "Have them focus on the Guard-Captain."
eyrie.31.b:0 "Give everygriff their fair due."

eyrie.32.t:0 "Supporting The Divine Cause"
eyrie.32.d:0 "Iovinus had a startling realisation that he barely ever saw the Prelate outside of the temple. It didn't particularly impact him in any shape or form, but he found it food for thought while waiting in this poorhouse. As much he tried to suppress it, Iovinus was not fond to be near these hapless wretches. He did eschew the trappings of nobility to hide better amongst the commoners, but the same couldn't be said for Verena, whose blazing crimson robe was an easy catch for the eyes.\n\nEventually the line progressed to the point he could speak with her, who was not at all fooled by his "disguise". "Of all the things I could imagine, this was not one of them. I don't suppose you're here for the free meal, are you?" In what could be construed as a mocking fashion, she raised a bowl of... something brown. It looked barely appetising, and no amount of bread could save it.\n\n"That won't be necessary, Prelate, we need to urgently discuss how you could help—" But her gaze rebuked him into silence.\n\n"If my help is what you desire, help me first. Come behind the counter and assist me." The nerve! He was not some servant! But this was no time to make a scene and Iovinus begrudgingly obliged as he stood next to Verena, doing everything she said, which was thankfully not too much. Between this charitable work, he passed out his ideas and desires, and a lull gave her the opportunity to respond. "I do far more than just preach from the lectern, it is true, but if you desire to expand my mission, it shall be so. Or, you could give some helping claws to Sigrid, she's always starved for aid." The Duke felt very much starved himself surrounded by this culinary mediocrity..."

eyrie.32.b:0 "Give Sigrid what she needs."

eyrie.33.t:0 "The Bank Will Have Its Due"
eyrie.33.d_flowena:0 ""So tell me more about this Jean de Monei, Freya. Who is he that he can fund our war effort, and convince the banks of Flowena to lift their embargo? If I didn't know better I'd believe you were trying to swindle me." Indeed, Iovinus had little trust for those vile bankers. Somehow they blamed him for all of Vincent's frauds and most likely he would end up having to pay for them.\n\n"Jean is an old friend of mine from the university days, my Duke. He's a consummate professional and he'll convince the others that investing in our struggles is a worthwhile endeavour. Of course, they won't do so out of eleos, and we'll have a debt to pay, but... we simply can't do this on our own." She spoke with confidence, and Iovinus knew that if this was the best Freya could do, it was most worthwhile.\n\n"I... very well, Freya. There isn't much time left for us, and we'll worry about our future obligations when we get to them. Make contact with your colleague and inform him that House Eyrie is willing to negotiate a deal." He wouldn't be surprised if these leeches ended up sucking all of his blood, but another realisation struck him. "Wait, hold on for a moment. Why didn't this Jean help us out before? You've never mentioned him."\n\nAs always, Freya had an answer ready. "He's but one griff in their pyramid, Iovinus. He wasn't able to overturn the opinion of the majority, but now that we've considerably invested in our economy, he'll have much better chances of convincing them that we are the better option for business." It seemed all too convenient, but the Duke's trust in his treasurer was never misplaced."
eyrie.33.d_some_bank:0 ""So sorry to hear about your friend, Freya, but who could have seen what would have transpired in Flowena? At least they got out alive." And more importantly for Iovinus, with those leeching bankers bust, he wouldn't have to pay them anything. "Now what was this alternative method you mentioned recently?"\n\n"The world truly never sits still, my Duke. Anyway, the von Hochsklaue bank in Skyfall are no less prestigious, and certainly have just as deep coffers. In retrospect, they should have been my first choice, but you'll forgive me for a bit of bias on my part. And most importantly, they do not answer to any government, and their support will be guaranteed. With a bit of backing, of course." Never caught on the wrong wing, Freya calmed Iovinus' worries about relying on pesky foreigners.\n\n"I... very well, Freya. There isn't much time left for us, and we'll worry about our future obligations when we get to them. Make contact with these bankers and inform him that House Eyrie is willing to negotiate a deal." Thankfully, that vulture Guichard passed a little while ago. Iovinus could see him try to get his grabby claws on Verenia, somehow.\n\n"I'll have a message sent by the end of the day, Iovinus! When there's an idol to be made, these griffons work like they're chased by hydras." Such a shame the Duke had no hydras of his own to sic on Vincent. It would have made for a humorous sight."

eyrie.34.t:0 "Verenian Defence Plan"
eyrie.34.d:0 ""Cut to the summary, Guard-Captain. I appreciate the level of detail you've put into this, but time is short and we need to be prepared. There will not be a repeat of last year." Once more Iovinus sat across Roman and his subordinate officers, all peering together at a map overlaid with lines, arrows, figures representing force estimations and others. Supposedly, this sort of thing constituted a hobby for those with too much spare time, but that thought would be chased later.\n\n"As you wish, mein Herzog. Obviously, the lie of the land has not drastically changed so our defence concentrations remain the same. We are confident that we can outlast them, yet I have prepared a fallback plan." Uncharacteristic of the inflexible strategist. "An appearance of weakness can bait them in a most cunning trap. With their overextended forces cut off, we can launch a devastating counterattack, and finally put an end to this Struggle." All this was accompanied with gestures and adjustments on the map.\n\n"And what of contingencies? Who knows what that scoundrel could be planning." Iovinus knew that a cornered animal was most dangerous.\n\n"Intelligence is unfortunately scarce, so this is the best we can do given our resources. I have faith that the well-drilled Watch will perform admirably." Roman was perhaps a bit too arrogant in his assumptions, but it was not like Iovinus could summon lightning bolts to smite everything west of the Aranti. It would have to do, and the choice awaited."

eyrie.35.d:0 ""You talk of divine providence, but unless Eyr personally smites all lands west of the Aranti, I don't see how you intend to win this war, Prelate. We can't pray our problems away." If only! Iovinus spent many hours at the temple just doing such and it left him with a peaceful, if spiritually unfulfilling feeling. He would not be speaking to Verena with such candour normally, but her ambiguous statements were beginning to grate a nerve. The Struggle was about to continue.\n\nThankfully she did not give him a verbal lashing. "Have faith, mein Herzog. With all the support you have provided to the Prelature, keeping the rest of your kind away as well, I was able to make contact with my colleagues in Romau. Your enemies will experience holy wrath for themselves, as they righteously deserve." One could say there was a fire in her gaze, matching her words.\n\nThis revelation left Iovinus thinking for a moment. Yes, the knights of Romau would certainly be excellent warriors... but there were quite a few downsides unspoken. For starters, he could forget about any sort of actual help from his unruly vassals, and what if he ended up indebted to the Archon of Eyr? Certainly, the Duke had never met him in person, but reputations have a way of spreading whether one wished so or not. Yet it was too late to back off now, for there were too many bridges burned. He gave Verena the blessing to do what was needed."

eyrie.36.t:0 "Recollecting The Revolution"
eyrie.36.d:0 ""The memory of 978 remains sharp in my mind. I was but a humble third son, destined to be entirely unremarkable, probably given some minor commission to live my days in idyllic boredom. None of us could have seen what would happen in Calembourg. Most of the ducal guard was sent away on the western border, in anticipation of some incursion from Aquileia. The danger came from within, however.\n\nIt was no secret that the merchants have always chafed under the nobility here in Verenia, I freely admit that myself as a noble, but our reasons were good and fair. Regardless, with most of the city's garrison depleted, they staged a republican revolt, undoubtedly assisted by foreign elements, and killed so many of my family. Third son became first, and I was fortunate to escape the calamity with the remainder of the loyal troops. There was no time to grieve, and a perimeter was established around the city, as we waited for additional forces to arrive from Erie.\n\nThe insipid imbecile called Vincent was just as insufferable back then as he is now. Blaming his delays on partisan attacks (his younger sibling, Cyrille, told me that Vincent was more concerned about stopping at every noble's estate), he would try to wrest control of the siege and the war council for himself, for reasons I could not comprehend. It seemed like our bickering would break our efforts to restore control over Verenia, until somegriff suggested to simply bomb the insurgents into submission. I disliked greatly the idea of destroying beautiful Calembourg, but it was the only course of action everygriff agreed on.\n\nSeven days and seven nights, we battered the revolutionaries into dust, with justice brought to the merchant leaders after a bloody assault. Yet our hardships have only begun after we thought ourselves safe."\n\n—From the memoirs of Iovinus Eyrie, Herzog von Eyrie"

Year after year, she clung to her memories and swore that one day she would get her revenge on all those who ruined her life. There would be no peace or rest until then. Was Gretel at fault for her predicament? Perhaps, perhaps, but that was something she chose to ignore.\n\nWhat she couldn't ignore was the mobilisation notice in her claws. Maar would have to take her first before she served even one day in that farce called the "Verenian Guard". Everygriff knew how it would go: a bunch of birds would die for nothing, then the insensitive lordlings would declare yet another ceasefire, and the cycle of torment would continue. Gretel clung firmer to her winter coat, the one luxury she didn't forsake in some fashion from her wealthier days, as she stepped inside the conscription office.\n\nThe bored looking recruiter would be easily convinced. "I believe there is a mistake here with my order. See, I am exempt from service due to my poor health." She received a sceptical look, but before a response formed Gretel dropped a hefty pouch on the desk. "This should prove my condition sufficiently." Oh she hated throwing away her dwindling fortune, but there was a life to live in pursuit of something worthwhile. Thankfully, this griff proved to be of dubious morals.\n\nWith her task successful, Gretel would return to her previous intention, that being a secret meeting with the others who've been hiding much like her.

Legends state that Kalem chose it to represent his tribe after their descent from the Hyperborean mountains, after he saw both the sun's glow and the moon's reflection on the dawn's horizon. Thus it was passed on through his descendants and became one of the banners used by the Verenian dukes.\n\nA fanciful tale of great inspiration, certainly, but the boring truth is that the earliest historical reference to the Sun-and-Moon symbol in question dates to late 500s, and even then it only featured the sun. Available records show that the moon was added only after the cadet branch of House Erie became established, and its addition was not without controversy. Nonetheless, this same banner of today was present in all notable events, particularly when duchess Adelina voluntarily submitted to the rising Groverian dynasty.\n\nBut why the sun and the moon to begin with?

Instead, precious metals like gold, silver, bronze and others were preferred, giving them not only an aesthetic appeal but confirmed their role as a commodity. Those would in time be minted into coinage, and with money thus came the need to track debt record, and soon after followed the first banks, which are described in the following chapters.\n\nVarious currencies were known, such as the Aquileian aigle, the Wingbardian scudo and the Herzland idol. The eastern riverponies had a similar diversity, but theirs are not worth mentioning. One of Grover III's notable achievements is implementing the aforementioned idol as the standardised currency across the continent, which has persisted to this day despite the Revolution of 978.

I could not answer that myself. What I know for certain, and what I always knew, is that no plea remains unanswered. Do not worry yourself with it." Iovinus did not always readily agree with the Prelate, but he sure wished he had this unshakeable resolve of hers. It would be far better for his psyche than his usual sense of despondency."

Inscrutable as they are, the Gods have chosen their favoured, and the Struggle is concluded.\n\nOr so it would seem, leaving us in a precarious position. We could have intervened while they were fighting, but we were not ready in time. Katrina still remains closed from the world, and the commonfolk will begin to wonder if our scaremongering has any merit.\n\nThus we've decided to throw the die, and see who the Gods truly favour. Eyrian soldiers have been sighted near the borders, but are still mostly occupied putting down resistance in former Erian holds. Verenia can only be united with either their or our defeat, so we'll expedite this process. This surprise tactic will give us a necessary advantage over them, and a convenient excuse for the public.\n\nVerenia could be so much greater than what these regressive fools squabble over..."

Yet these reports received from the Guard-Captain said completely otherwise. Erian assault had completely failed, their resistance had collapsed quickly, the arrogant paladins were laid low, and Vincent himself was en route to Calembourg in a cage. Everything was exactly as he wanted, yet the Duke felt not a single bit of satisfaction.\n\nPerhaps it was the paranoia talking. Words like these didn't stay contained for long, and already there were impromptu celebrations across his holdings. Could it truly be so? Could the Struggle finally be over, and could he finally tell his beloved wife and daughters that they are allowed to return? Hopefully this wasn't some kind of... mass hallucination or something. Iovinus needed a drink.\n\nThen he could figure out how this happened. Did one of his advisors play a crucial role in this?"

eyrie.48.d:0 "It might have seemed awfully self-serving, but Iovinus had little opinion on serfdom. It was simply something that was always there, and while he was more than ready to punish cruel exploitation, he also knew some serfs lived just as good as their supposed masters. In recent times, however, manumission was becoming a common practice. Not because of any supposed benevolence from the nobles, mind you, but because they had too many and griffs just had to be let go.\n\nThus the Duke was discussing the issue with most of his inner council (the Prelate on principle refused to share a room with the Guard-Captain whenever possible), and Freya was eagerly explaining how there were plenty of factories that needed more helping claws. Certainly better than having them loitering around, but Iovinus wondered if those griffs would just be trading one personal Tartarus for another. It didn't take a rector of Yale to know that industrialisation didn't quite provide comfortable labour.\n\nThe Guard-Captain had some other ideas. "Herzog, economical development is certainly a fine thing, but the Verenian Guard continues facing shortages in numbers. While we have enough to fill our frontline regiments, auxiliary roles such as logistics, engineering and medical assistance are suffering. Please keep in mind that their role is just as important." Reasonable, very reasonable. Iovinus would be much more happier if he didn't end up often picking between two reasonable choices, but such was life."

eyrie.49.d:0 "As the ruling lord of all Verenia (or at least half of it), Iovinus received plenty of invitations to balls, parties, commemorations, openings and other such trite, but his busy schedule prevented him from attending most of them, except the most important ones, or whose organisers he didn't want to offend. Such was this occasion, as he witnessed the Prelate do her work.\n\nThe Duke had a vague recollection that these ceremonies weren't always so sombre and quiet. He could swear that the previous prelate made quite a spectacle of the proceedings, but Verena was a different kind. She had the face of a disappointed lecturer and woe befell anygriff who dared cause a commotion at her events. Still, watching as the votive offerings to Eyr were sacrificed gave a certain... peace to Iovinus. It was as if they did something right, and good fortune would follow them soon.\n\nOf course, only a small portion of the harvest was sacrificed, but he knew there was a plentiful bounty this year. Iovinus may have not owned or controlled every single grain of rye, barley or wheat, but he knew griffs who did, and he could do something with the surplus. If he were to listen to the Prelate, the Duke would be personally putting food in the claws of the poor (something he could at least delegate to some other griff), but he recalled Freya mentioning how they were always lacking in funds. Perhaps he would decide after he was done indulging in the ceremony's tranquillity."

I don't believe it, I'm always careful!\n\nYou asked me last time how I was progressing with my studies. Lorien teases me that I'm being lazy but don't believe her, Papa! I'm following the courses my lecturers set for me and we just finished going over griffon history from 800 to 900. Papa, could you ask Frau Hilde to stop scaring me with the ruler?

So much has been irretrievably spent and lost just to ensure this final victory, but the Duke allowed a small measure of celebration: everygriff in the standing forces got a small prize in idols (funded by whatever got pillaged from the vanquished rebels) and a commemorative ribbon. Hopefully it would have provided them some satisfaction, for Iovinus wanted nothing more than to forget as soon as possible everything about the Struggle.\n\nWork was far from over, however. Despite the defeat and capture of their ringleaders, sporadic acts of resistance continued in the former holds of Houses Erie and Avian. The latter was especially surprising, as many griffs were duped into serving a liar and a fraud, but the former was very much expected. For all his lack of intelligence, Vincent somehow inspired loyalty Iovinus never could.\n\nThus Iovinus' orders were simple.

Fortunately, he has been dealt with, extremely distant relative or not, but Katrina still remained, waiting for judgement. She was too pure and innocent for this cruel world.\n\n"Katrina... niece. Know that I am deeply sorrowful about Amelinda's passing." There was not a hint of irony in his words, even though he regarded Amelinda as a nuisance at best. "Nor am I overly happy with how everything turned out. Dare say I experienced a century of a lifetime in these past twenty five years. How are you holding up?"\n\n"I- thank you for your well wishes, uncle Iovinus. Must admit that it broke me, the succession of negative events, and I didn't know what to do with myself. You didn't have to be so harsh on uncle Trubach, though." Nonsense, he was trying to seize what was rightfully Iovinus', and for that he belonged in the same pile as Vincent.\n\n"There'll be no further need for harshness, I assure you. We finally have peace, even if it isn't in the way you envisioned, Katrina." The idea of even being in the same room as Vincent still made his feathers molt.

It gave him flashbacks to those visceral feelings back in 983, when everything fell apart over some rather minor squabble. He wasn't sure now why exactly was he so stubborn about it, besides not wanting Vincent to have a victory, but maybe, just maybe... Iovinus should have relented and given him that one.\n\nStill, there's no use dwelling on what could have been, and what didn't happen, for the present demanded attention. The Duke of Verenia could simply reintegrate them back into his fold, perhaps post some soldiers around to make sure they don't scheme again, and turn his attention elsewhere. However, the more hardliner elements (unsurprisingly pressed on by the Guard-Captain) voiced their concerns that they could not be trusted, and that if Iovinus wanted them as vassals, he should at least make an example of Vincent's most loyal supporters.\n\nHow much longer until Corinna returned?

Iovinus wondered how long would Vincent persist with his silent treatment, this one last act of spite from him. The Duke didn't mind for it was certainly better than listening to his vapid whining, but he had to admit this wasn't how his daydreams went.\n\nThus Iovinus broke the silence first. "I remember what you said that last time. That you'd be sitting on father's throne within the year." As part of their previous compromise, they both sat on smaller chairs next to it. "You've been persistent, I'll give you that, but everything you've worked for has turned to ash. You're a failure, Vincent." Oh how satisfying that felt.\n\nThe huddled figure trembled with what was certainly unbridled rage, but still no response. Once more unto the breach. "Thirty years later and you still act like a spoiled brat. What would father say..." Most likely he'd ask to be left alone with his wine. "If anything, I think this conclusively proves I'm his favourite son, and Verenia is mine." By every right and custom.\n\nThat appeared to have broken what little restraint Vincent kept going, and he would lunge for Iovinus' throat... if it weren't for the sturdy bars in the way. How absolutely pathetic he looked, frothing at the beak and swinging with his claws through them. "As if you ever cared for Verenia! You're doing all this because your wife is forcing you! And to buy tacky paintings and sculptures! Worthless hypocrite!"\n\nIt was true that Corinna had a lot of influence over him but that didn't need to be said openly.

Both were incredibly busy, and only today did he catch her for a leisurely walk through Calembourg, ostensibly to oversee the rebuilding of dilapidated manor homes. It gladdened his heart to keep one of his promises, and pleased his spite twofold to have funded it with Vincent's idols.\n\n"Things have changed so much since the last time we had one of these events, Iovinus." There would have been more of them if he wasn't so occupied constantly. "I am still somewhat in disbelief it is over, yet there is no doubt that the best griff for the task succeeded." Not like she ever said anything good about his sibling.\n\n"Many have told me I should quit being so stubborn, but those same griffs aren't telling me much now." Together they were observing as labourers cleared away debris. "But I will be honest with you, Freya: I am exceptionally tired after so long. I was hoping to ask you if you'd take up more of my responsibilities while I focus on Corinna and the chicks." Just a few weeks more.\n\nIt took the Duke a while to realise she did not immediately respond, turning in her direction to observe Freya having a mild panic attack. Only then did she formulate an answer: "A-are you sure about this, Iovinus? Is there no better griff for the task?"\n\n"Who better than the one who achieved this success? I can't think of anygriff else I'd prefer." Such praise convinced her to accept, and relieved Iovinus of worries he'd have to ask somegriff else."
eyrie.57.d_roman:0 "The Duke had to admit that the Verenian Guard proved themselves... capable. Yes, despite all the mercurial ruminating he has done in the past, he gave credit where credit is due: Roman and his officers did what they were told, gave Vincent's thugs a good trashing, and mostly avoided unnecessary adventures. Thus it made all the more difficult for Iovinus to make this request from the Guard-Captain, if the latter would finally cease with his pompous bragging.\n\n"...now you must see, mein Herzog, that the good and proper nobles are needed for a safe and prosperous Verenia. We've been keeping a tight claw on those who have chosen to accept your dominion, but we cannot proceed with the necessary changes if you insist on overseeing our every move. We need some autonomy in the matter." Iovinus could not decide if his Captain was powerhungry, or simply deluded into thinking he knew better than anygriff.\n\n"Perhaps you might be onto something, Markgraf." He could have sworn the warbird made a brief stumble. "You and the others seem to have everything under control, and I must admit, I've been wasting after all these years of struggling." Not entirely wrong, but the Duke's primary motivation was opening up free time for Corinna and the chicks. "Could Verenia's best and noblest lend a claw in healing this broken land? I fear I may not be able to—"\n\n"Rest assured, Herzog, that we'll fulfil your wishes to the letter." Could the supposedly brilliant strategist have been fooled with such basic flattery? Was Roman truly so desperate for approval, or simply grabbing the opportunity with both claws? Nonetheless, Iovinus just secured himself a vacation of indefinite length, and all the responsibilities hoisted on gullible saps. Some measures would have to be made to ensure they don't grow out of control, but the Duke was already looking forward to hearing what mess they'll create."

Looking down below on the courtyard from his lofty vantage point, the Duke wondered just many griffs were aware he had become a prisoner of his own court.\n\nBut in some sick, twisted fashion, he was glad it was so. Iovinus moulted too many neckfeathers over the years, stressing himself over this and that, and now that he had little else to do but read, stroll and imbibe tea he was left... content. Freya would occasionally play guest, sympathetic yet helpless to his plight, and what he heard from the usual gossipmongers was that the meddling conspirators hadn't burned Verenia to the ground... just yet.\n\nSo enjoy playing the Herzog, Roman! Iovinus continued to indulge on the nectar of his spite, convincing himself that they would still have plenty of troubles to untangle.

Alas, this wonderful spread which decisively proved that starvation never had a seat at this table failed to impress Verena, who was content with a simple plate of Verenian pastry pockets (how rustic!).\n\n"Will you not try anything else, Prelate? Eyr has given us Her gifts for us to appreciate." He almost felt guilty having all this for himself, but there was nothing a good glass of wine couldn't wash over. Even if he couldn't finish everything, Iovinus could just reward the servants for getting this done on a quick note.\n\n"It will suffice, Herzog, for you should rather praise Eyr for giving you the gift of peace." Always judging him, silently glaring... that bird probably never had her claw held in a tender way. And he was very grateful! Tired, of course, but grateful for giving Vincent the proper beating he always deserved. Iovinus decided it would be best to cut with the small talk.\n\n"Then perhaps Her greatest representative should preside over the peace in Verenia. You've already shown great resolve in concluding the Struggle, despite all the protests I've had to endure, and I believe you'll continue to perform admirably while I attend to matters closer to my heart." The ensuring silence made Iovinus hesitate taking the next bite.\n\nFinally, it came: "If that is what our Herzog thinks is best."

The Duke had no complaints to any of this, for he was very much in need of a leisurely moment after all the other tediums he went through.\n\n"I am certain you must be greatly overjoyed, Iovinus! You are free from the Struggle!" In a practised motion and bereft of her usual tight bun and glasses, Freya poured for her and her guest an amber liquid, before raising her glass in toast. "This is old Skyfall whiskey. Saved it just for this particular occasion." Whether that was a great restraint for a lover of the strong stuff Iovinus could not tell, but happily accepted the offering.\n\n"That I am, that I am, Freya! If I were a more irrational griff I'd say in some way that I'd miss the whole routine of gloom and doom... if only for an another opportunity to give Vincent's backside a good beating." That pleasant thought was drowned away with another gulp. "Ah, but we shouldn't dwell on that anymore. I've made arrangements for the others to take a more active role in rebuilding Verenia while I focus on Corinna and the chicks. You won't have any issues working with them, right?"\n\nIf one were to look closely, they could tell the Treasurer hasn't had many good nights lately, but the workflow would crawl to a more manageable size.

Not to mention, the new uniform he had commissioned for his victory (most certainly a rare indulgence for a lover of the aesthetic) looked far more opulent yet simply elegant, next to the plain outfit of a Guard-Captain.\n\n"...that being said, mein Herzog, we've had limited success with conscripting the remnants of their household forces. For better or worse, they have little interest in serving their former foes—", a rather understandable sentiment, "—but at least we were able to have them agree to return home and surrender any firearms they had." The Captain had to pick up the pace with his claws and paws.\n\n"That'll be quite alright, Guard-Captain. What's most important is that the realm is safe, sound and all those remaining troublemakers were put down as they deserved." For all their antipathy Iovinus had to admit Roman was a consummate professional, as long as he steered clear of those petty schemes. "Have you and the officers join me next week for an accolade ceremony. Everygriff did such a splendid job, I can afford to be generous."

Have you come to pay homage to your stalwart supporters?" Though Verena's words were seemingly innocuous and full of praise, her tone dripped with disappointment and no small amount of contempt. Truly spite outlived the spiteful, but that didn't put a damper on Iovinus' mood.\n\n"Hail to thee as well, Prelate of Eyr! I have indeed come to praise the Gods for our most glorious victory... and their representatives on this mortal plane." The glint of the sun reflected from her headpiece, making it difficult for the Duke to properly look up to her. Perhaps this was another of her petty intentions, but best not to assume the negative just yet.\n\nShe would tilt her head, frowning. "Your praise is welcome, yet it comes with little gratitude. Words in the wind, if you will." Her shuffling suggested she'd extend a wing, if it weren't for the restrictive garb. "Nonetheless, it is good that there is peace in fair Verenia once more, and now the Prelature will dedicate fully to its intended purpose. Pious seclusion from the world."

Right after he left the defeated imbecile to wail in the cell, the thoughts and plans rushed in his mind and he was more than eager to exact them. Iovinus was a learned griff and he knew all sorts of sadistic displays various cultures around the world inflicted on their vanquished foes. If only he could use more than one... yet, if word got out that the stoic ruler of Verenia was a cruel butcher, his subjects might start having second guesses.\n\nBesides, Corinna would be pulling the feathers off his wings and other such admonishing, which he didn't need.\n\nThus Iovinus settled for a rather subdued spectacle. Vincent and his stubborn lackeys, all gagged and blindfolded, were taken to the courtyard outside the grand palace. There'd be no grandstanding, no one last egomaniacal outburst, just a simple, quick execution by firing squad. It was perhaps more than what the wretch deserved, but at least nogriff could say it was brutal.\n\nAnd so they were all shoved to their places, loyal soldiers of the Watch waiting for the order. Their rifles were loaded with hollow point bullets, the one act of spite the Duke felt he could reasonably get away without anygriff protesting. Iovinus took one last gaze at his despicable half-sibling, and felt like he was born anew."
eyrie.61.a:0 "Thus end the claims of House Erie."

eyrie.62.t:0 "The Most Fair And Just Trial"
eyrie.62.d:0 "It was going to be a farce, of course, but Iovinus quite desired to sate that spiteful feeling he was brewing for the past few decades. To that end, he had ordered the scribes to quickly gather the appropriate paperwork and clean up one of the spare rooms for a trial.\n\nThe arranged day would quickly arrive and the Duke felt a great deal of self-satisfaction. He watched from his high podium as the chained and bound Vincent wildly lashed against the accusations heaped upon him by the similarly indulgent Guard-Captain.\n\n"Vincent Erie is accused of treason, embezzlement, forgery, disobedience, destruction of ducal property, conspiring to seize power..."\n\nWhile most of them were sincerely correct, some were overblown or reframed to paint Iovinus in a better light. He was most careful to absolve himself of any guilt he might have had for that accursed council in 983. Nonetheless, the theatrics pleased the noble crowd, who needed little convincing that the rebellious scum was in any way innocent, with Vincent and his followers quickly sentenced to death after only two hours of proceedings.\n\nBut the cur wouldn't let go without one last barb, as he was dragged away by burly watchgriffs. "IOVINUS! Maar awaits you at the gates of Tartarus! This was all your fault, if you stopped to listen for once—" His screeches would be drowned out in the distance as the victorious Duke adjusted in his lofty position. Not everygriff approved of his actions, yet even they couldn't resist enjoying the humiliation of a defeated foe."

In the past week, however, there's been plenty of talking regarding a troublesome duo. After the conflict in Verenia ended (a minor spat of no importance, only concerning to busybodies), there have been some exiles and refugees passing through, but nogriff expected that the leader of the defeated party would appear.\n\nUnlike most who didn't remain for too long, this Vincent Erie quickly proved to be a nuisance on the populace. Aside from loudly begging for idols (looked down upon by even the most devoted of Eyr), he made outrageous demands out of local councillors and overall disrupted the peace in general. This rag-wearing miscreant would have been on the receiving end of many beatings, were it not for the presence of his sibling Cyrille, a supposedly legendary "paladin" (Verenian knights were well known for their impressive arrogance), who defended him in each and every encounter. It has to be admitted that the old bird is an excellent fighter, at least.\n\nIn any case, the local police force ended up escorting these miscreants out of the city, after repeated complaints from the citizenry, wishing to avoid some sort of mob justice. Just another episode in the biggest little city in Griffonia."

The imbecile Vincent is set to be executed soon, and there is nothing that can stop that, I will strangle him with my own bare cla—" She raised a claw to interrupt the Duke's tirade.\n\n"Eyr's peace with you, Herzog! Keep your vengeance if it is so dear to your heart. I speak of his sibling, the paladin Cyrille. He is a servant of the Gods and he should be rehabilitated under the auspices of the Prelature. It would be only proper."\n\nThis gave Iovinus some pause. In truth he had no quarrel with this Cyrille, and he was only following Vincent on the chopping block for his devoted service. "To forgive is divine, Prelate, and we've certainly all heard stories of his gallantry and honour. But how can you be so sure Cyrille will not plot vengeance of his own, especially after we murder his liege lord?"\n\nVerena's expression was enigmatic as always.

The griff in question was impatiently waiting at the station, frequently flicking his tail and spreading his wings. Further away, the retinue made a protective perimeter but they were entirely forgettable and unimportant.\n\nHow long had it been since Iovinus last saw them? The answer eluded his thoughts, was it two, three or five years... The letters made it easy to forget, yet time was not kind to his memory or wellbeing. The Duke tried to steady his nerves. Everything was alright now, nothing could go wrong, this is what he had waited for so long.\n\nA shrill sound in the distance signalled the train's arrival. Were his feathers properly brushed? Did his clothes look tidy?!\n\nHis worries quickly dashed what little time remained, and Iovinus awaited with bated breath as a small crowd exited to mill past him, entirely unaware who the Duke was, as he suddenly felt two small bodies shove themselves against his chest. "Papa! Papa! We're home! We missed you so, so much!" Lothra! Lorien! Iovinus embraced his adorable chicks firmly, with a familiar voice calling out.\n\n"Iovinus! Darling! Why did you keep us away for so long? Do you have any idea how worried I was?! Vederstad is a complete hovel, and Skyfall was too crowded to visit on a regular basis, I had to..."

eyrie.77.t:0 "Last Remnant Of The Days Gone"
eyrie.77.d:0 "For once, Iovinus looked forward to the next session of the Ducal Court. The pressing matter concerned itself with the planned abolition of manorialism, vassalage and all those other trappings of ancient times. Of course, the abolition of nobility was not something that was ever on the daily plan, for reasons much obvious. It would have been very satisfying to be rid of this burden.\n\n"...myself and my colleagues can all agree, Edler Herr, that we do not need serfdom anymore. The winds of change are blowing fiercely, and while we still have loyal household soldiers upholding the order, what good are half starved peasants, whose minds are more occupied with home and family than duty?" The old warhawk, burgreif Landsgraf, argued with fierce passion, and much to Iovinus' surprise, a large part of the room was in agreement with her. Even Roman offered a terse nod, undoubtedly desiring a more motivated sort of griff for his precious Watch.\n\nIf he could, the Duke would have immediately concluded the hearing and went with the plan. To maintain some sort of stability, he promised long ago to the lower classes the abolishment of feudal relations if he were victorious in the Struggle, and scared them with mostly truthful stories of the exploitation Vincent would inflict. But nothing was ever so simple, his word alone couldn't change everything overnight, and he still remembered a small but very wealthy few of the nobles, who guaranteed a handsome reward if he were to simply... renegotiate the terms, as is. Would he be principled, or give in to his vices?"

I did not work my tail off for you to replace me with this, this... cheating shrew!" With one claw balled in a fist, the other one was accusingly pointed in Sigrid's direction, who regarded the Guard-Captain as a particularly bothersome chick. Good thing the other paladins present were keeping the discussion at an acceptable level of civility, and the other nobles kept their beaks shut.\n\nIovinus too felt rather tired, as a whisper from the side came. "He is not welcome here, mein Herzog. Look how he treats you, how he had always questioned your authority..." Yes, Verena knew exactly how he felt. She had been right all along.\n\n"The courtesy you've been offering me has been lessened as of late, Guard-Captain. I did not replace you, as you are claiming, but rather you are to share your duties with the Knight-Commander. Since you've proven yourself to be... inadequate in that task, compared to your predecessor." Iovinus still missed that old griff.\n\nRoman did not take this further insult to his pride lightly, snapping off the singular medal on his chest, before flinging it to the floor. "If the company of traitors and schemers is so dear to you, mein Herzog—", the stress on that honorific felt distinctively insulting, "—then I'll have no part of it. Let Verenia burn to the ground for all I care!" And just like that, Roman would storm off, never to be seen again in this great hall, as Iovinus exhaled in exasperation."

Just as he announced that the proceedings for today were done, a figure in purple carried himself across the room like a hawk after its prey.\n\nRoman stepped forward to intercept: "Have you not heard? The Duke has spoken that you must return tomo—", but Iovinus interrupted him with a raised claw. He knew who this was, a foreigner (for he was better dressed than most of the so-called nobility here) with some very unpleasant news.\n\nThe griff smiled sweetly, as if he were about to indulge in his favourite meal. "Beg pardon for intruding on your time, Duke of Verenia, but I've arrived from the bank—", which one needed no explanation, "—to deliver you the receipt for all the expenses you've incurred in your very successful campaign. May your reign be long and successful." Otherwise this vulture wouldn't be paid, yes. Iovinus passively observed as he gave a fuming Roman a long sheet of paper, which was promptly given to him.

Why did he go through all those hoops? "I suppose I simply believed we'd only need to use those funds in an emergency, and given how easily the conflict ended, there was no need for any of it." And because Iovinus read the fine print and knew that the process of repayment would be rather staggering and a drain on his coffers. Every coin kept in his purse, far away from the bankers, was supremely precious.\n\nThe Treasurer hemmed and hawed at the reasoning, but ultimately accepted it. "As you wish, as you wish. I would have preferred if we made use of their investments, but at least there is no debt now to worry about. Except the service fees, and some claw grease to reintegrate us into the wider economy. I trust it is alright if I resolve these issues myself?"\n\nThough Iovinus trusted Freya implicitly, he always appreciated being given a notice for them.

"Now, Iovinus, I know it looks horrible, but recall your words: either you'd be victorious or not be at all. Already my income forecasts are painting a bright picture, and not just because we've doubled our taxable population. It will take a year at minimum to clear the debt entirely, and then we can start building up our reserves."\n\nShort, simple and reasonable, like all of her explanations, but he would rest his cheek against an outstretched claw.

I considered it a great idea, if only to show to the others that Vincent was incompetent and only interested in wasting time and idols. It seemed to have worked and I did my best in management by sorting out disputes and the like.\n\nWhat would happen I could have never foreseen. There was a meeting over some minor budgetary issue, I cannot remember exactly what was it now as I write these words, but suddenly, Vincent rose up and demanded that I pack my belongings and leave, as 'this was his rightful land'. Completely dumbfounded and caught by surprise, I responded with a couple choice words I've been saving for a while, that are too undignified to put into paper.

What shocked me even more was that she would side with Vincent out of all griffons, but there were far greater concerns at the time than eccentric family members.\n\nIt seemed that this rebellion would not last long, but Vincent somehow convinced a large number of the lesser noble houses to join him, to say nothing that he had the majority of the paladins as well! How he accomplished that was beyond any scenario I could imagine, but the loyalist forces were no slouches when it came to repelling their attacks. Eventually, we politely agreed to take a break from the fighting.\n\nDuring that ceasefire Amelinda staged a second revolt and took about half of Vincent's stooges with her. Apparently he wasn't all that great in keeping griffs loyal, but we could not capitalise on this advantage because she continued insisting on making peace between the houses, completely forgetting all the bloodshed that had occurred.

"What's so good about the bluecaps?"\n\n"You'd choke on smoke in a factory, and the nobles beat us with canes. The Guard is a prestigious institution, dating to the founding days of Verenia!

Unlike most militia at the time, it was composed entirely of volunteers." He was very proud of that little history lesson.\n\n"Nice one, Lud. I'm sure they're looking to fill up the egghead company."

There, griffons as a whole first came into being, and the air feels different with the echo of divine presence lingering. Only the most ill-mannered brute would consider desecrating them.\n\nShould one seek a less austere surrounding, the grand temples of Boreas, Eyr and Arcturius, located in Griffenheim, Romau and Rila respectively, provide a spectacle for anygriff whose eyes are gladdened by beauty. The deeds of many great griffs are proudly displayed, inspiring the faithful towards new heights. While the archonates which guide the faithful from these locations are incredibly old, their power and influence only came with the Groverian Empire which organised the religion into a more functional state. Those lucky enough to arrive at the right moment may even see the archons themselves provide blessings!\n\nOf course, there are plenty of other temples which are no less inspiring, such as those in Calembourg, Kivessin or Thurnham, but those are primarily of interest for griffons who cannot afford to visit the most popular places.\n\n—From Pilgrim's Guide to the Triarchy"

Stuffed to the brim with meat, potatoes, and onion, they can keep a peasant going for hours, but one must avoid jostling them, lest the precious baked good loses its shape.\n\nTo create these pastries, you'll need two cupfuls of flour, a stick of cold butter and some salt for the dough. The filling will require diced potatoes and onions, ground beef and some salt, measured to one's preferences.\n\nFor preparation, take the flour and salt and sift it into a bowl. Gradually add the cold butter, cut into small pieces, complementing with cold water so the dough becomes firm enough to easily shape. Use a rolling pin to turn the dough as flat as possible, then fold the sides in toward the middle, fold again, and let it cool for a few minutes. While you wait, prepare the filling by simply combining all of its ingredients in a large bowl.\n\nOnce the dough has sufficiently chilled, roll it out as flat as possible, using a small sharp knife to cut small circles. Avoid pulling or stretching it. Arrange the dough circles on a baking tray, and set one to two spoons of the meat mixture in the centre of each circle. Moisten the edges of the dough with a bit of water, and fold inward around the sides, then press the "seams" firmly together with your clawtips to seal the pockets. Afterwards, have them bake for about thirty to forty minutes, and enjoy!\n\n—Recipe taken from The Verenian Cookery, first published in 872"

Stand aside, lower your banners, and we shall have peace and friendship for as long as our bloodlines live."\n\nAdelina was incredulous that anygriff would speak in such way with her, even if it were a rival: "Chosen by the Gods, pah! For a few coins I can find many such griffons in the gutters of Calembourg. They must have chosen poorly for they have only given you uncouth manners and arrogance beyond compare. Return from whence you came, lest my retainers give you a drubbing you shall not soon forget!"\n\nWith his next move Grover confirmed his might: "Behold! The greatest treasure of all griffons!" He showed the Idol, and all light grew dimmer around it, blessed as it was. "I seek no quarrel, no battle betwixt us! Join me and you shall share in its splendour."\n\nDivinity could not be a subject of falsehood, and Adelina saw it truly with her own eyes; from that day forward the House of Eyrie were true and trusted friends for the House of Greifenstein.\n\n—As attested by an anonymous page, historicity disputed"

His voice as even as it could be in this situation, the mystery guest was ushered in, and the Duke turned to face Freya. "Oh. What brings you here? I thought we concluded all our business earlier."\n\nOnly now did he notice she was carrying a small box. "With how glum you looked, Iovinus, you could peel the wallpapers with your misery. So I thought you'd appreciate if I stopped over for something more leisurable." She waved him over with a claw to the workdesk, and he took his place across, peeking with mild curiosity at the box.\n\n"Monopsony? Isn't that for—"\n\n"Chicks? Foals, as ponies say? I don't recall you complaining about that with your children." Anything for them. "Having fun is for everygriff! I also brought something more potent to drink." Now that was more Freya's style. Though truth be told, Iovinus had a hard time imagining Freya having... fun. Not with that tight bun, or prim glasses, though this game certainly fitted her character.\n\n"I shall concede to your logic, this time." She was quick in setting up the board and everything. Even if Vincent stood outside with all his armoured goons, torches in claws, Iovinus would at least turn ablaze in contentment."

eyrie_freya.5.d:0 ""Mon Duc,\n\nReports have emerged of foreign units fighting for House Eyrie.\nThis is something very much not in line with their disdain for assistance, but perhaps desperation has put aside those concerns. The foreigners have been identified by our scouts as mercenaries known to be frequently employed by the banker vultures, and further corroborated from the rat's infiltrators. Rest assured that these cowardly sellswords will not pose an issue for the brave paladins.\n—Paladin-Commandant Absolon Cyrille d'Amphitre""
eyrie_freya.5.a:0 "Is that all you can muster, Iovinus? Foreign scum?"

eyrie_freya.6.t:0 "The Treasurer"
eyrie_freya.6.d:0 "She felt like she hadn't had a good rest in forever.\n\nOf course, Freya was hardly the type to voice her problems out loud, which were certainly significant. Nothing that couldn't be solved with a good book and tea, of which she was indulging in greatly right now, coupled with her favourite chair. Calming, soothing, if but a simple distraction for some time.\n\nShe thought back to her employer's words. 'You have made this possible, Freya. There is nogriff else I can trust with this.' Iovinus was always such a darling and it was no surprise at all he had such a loving wife and family! She couldn't say no to him, and thus, Freya was now basically in charge of the whole realm. Feathers brushed against the soft surface as she slid deeper down into a more comforting pose.\n\nFreya was great at management. She was great at everything, if one believed the griffs around her. But this might be too much even for one of her talents. Disappointing Iovinus, however... was a far more worse option. With newfound encouragement, the brilliant treasurer took one of the napkins from the coffee table and began scratching a vague plan with a clawtip."
eyrie_freya.6.a:0 "Another puzzle to solve."

eyrie_freya.7.t:0 "Unsatisfying Sinecure"
eyrie_freya.7.d:0 "Freya could hardly see the family resemblance between Katrina and Iovinus. She believed she knew the Duke well, a sour griff who nonetheless had a charming, erudite side in his good mood, but his niece was something else entirely. Energetic, lively, and so cheerful she could give somegriff saccharine poisoning! Thus the Treasurer had a hard time keeping up with the joyful ball of feathers as she went on and on about a personal problem.\n\n"—and you see, uncle Iovinus said he'd give me something to do, but all I do week after week is tending to the manorial gardens. It's boring! Not that I don't like plants, but I was hoping for something more challenging, and when I asked this griff, he told me I should talk to you about it." Impressive how Katrina managed to say everything in one breath.\n\n"I... see. Your issue is that you don't have any actual work?" Perhaps Iovinus saw her enthusiasm and decided she was best out of everygriff's beaks. "What are you good at, what would you like to do?"\n\nThis seemed to take the wind out of Katrina's wings. "Weeeeeeell... I was given a great education, I know how to manage paperwork, estates, all that boring drivel." Freya took slight offence to that. "But I was always told how good I am with other birds, how I could have griffs get along and arrange a compromise between them." If that were the case, then the peace talks wouldn't have been summarily rejected. Still, Freya could see the earnest motivation behind her words, but maybe there was a good reason why Iovinus gave her nothing to do? The Duke shouldn't be bothered with something so trivial."
eyrie_freya.7.a:0 "Only empty promises and soft words."
eyrie_freya.7.b:0 "Katrina is given more duties."

eyrie_freya.8.t:0 "Grover's Law"
eyrie_freya.8.d:0 "Like any proper intellectual, the House Treasurer was greatly fond of reading, but what she was going through right now made her want to choke on feathers. Previously she didn't have to worry about unimportant things like laws and rules, oftentimes simply finding a loophole to exploit whatever she needed, but now it was a great concern of hers due to this... mess.\n\nOn surface it seemed simple. You had Grover's law which had been enforced since Verenia submitted to the old empire, and you had the "common law", which were various judgements made by historical dukes and officials that acted in their name. Issue was, the former was largely unchanged from the initial version while the latter grew increasingly larger and frequently contradictory with previous rulings. Freya wondered greatly how did Iovinus made sense of all this, or did he simply ignore it and make decisions based on whatever he felt was best?\n\nWhichever the case was, it was becoming a problem and it needed some resolution, particularly in regards with the reintegrated lands west of the Aranti which still used an undefined patchwork of Aquileian customs and things she could not recollect. Now, Freya had no formal legal training, but she was certain she could write an entire code by herself given enough time, but was that worth the stress when she could simply pay some griffs from the Herzland?"
eyrie_freya.8.a:0 "A group of legal minds is hired for the task."

eyrie_freya.9.d:0 ""Usually you're all business, Roman, but I'm always glad for our weekly meetups. A welcome escape from the endless list of chores, even if I enjoy working myself." And the strong spirits made everything a little bit easier. Freya considered from time to time to start adding a drop to her midday tea, but it would be poor form to become an alcoholic.\n\nThe Guard-Captain, bereft of his prim uniform, looked very much relaxed himself. In absence of tightly bound formality, more candid words could flow. "We're both hard workers, Freya, and we deserve time off. I certainly wouldn't invite you here just to whine and complain like an old bird." A hint of his usual gruff tone crept in. "Though, I'll admit there is a matter that's been bothering me lately."\n\nIn her tipsy state, the Treasurer hardly felt tired. "Mmm... since we're done gossiping for the night, why don't you indulge my curiosity about your issue?"\n\n"We are most definitely NOT gossiping." Though he punctuated it with a scoff, it was a very poor lie. "But alright. For quite some time, the logistics in the Guard have been sorely lacking. Every time I try to get rid of sutlers, camp followers and the assorted ilk, they somehow return, and present a drain on our resources. Quite the annoyance." The glass was emptied of its contents.\n\nSutlers, sutlers... oh right, those are griffs that follow armies and sell provisions. A true enterprising sort. "I believe I still owe you a favour for last time, Roman. Would you like if I took care of this problem?" He would backtrack, unwilling to hoist more burdens on her, but soon enough they settled the discussion. "
eyrie_freya.9.a:0 "Roman convinced her to back off."

eyrie_freya.10.d:0 ""Give to the Duke what belongs to him, and to the Gods what is theirs. I do not see where is the problem, Freya Schattenriss." There was a sense of finality in Verena's words, a tone that that did not brook further discussion, but Freya was hardly going to be dissuaded by a few harsh words. After all, she was doing the Duke's good work, and the Gods weren't paying her to the best of her knowledge.\n\n"Perhaps I misspoke, Prelate, I did not wish to accuse you or the clergy of embezzlement, it's just that your finances seem highly... irregular—", though a brief look around what could charitably be called Verena's office suggested she lived off bread and water, "—and I couldn't help but wonder if you needed any sort of assistance in the matter. Find out if there's any sort of issue."\n\nIf that appeasement warmed up Verena, it couldn't be said. "Once in a while, a griff takes more than they deserve from our donations, that is true. They are always caught and receive their just punishment. Otherwise, as I've already said, the Prelature subsists purely on gifts, as we follow Grover's law. There are no plots under my roof." Such was her faith in their honesty.\n\nFreya had to admit that she felt ashamed bringing her thoughts here, for the Prelate's character was well known around Verenia, and yet... what if there was something more? What if there is some secret plot even Verena is unaware of?"
eyrie_freya.10.a:0 "Verena stood her ground."

eyrie_freya.11.t:0 "Ambitious Scheme"
eyrie_freya.11.d:0 "Freya got her wings all tangled up finalising this, but it was surely worth it. Iovinus had to see how hard she worked, how well-thought-out her plan was! Said Duke, who looked far more well-rested and happier, seemed to have a hard time keeping up with her speech.\n\n"...and so you see, Iovinus, while it is a risky endeavour, it would be in the best benefit of Verenia. Think of the advances we could achieve, pull us out of the stagnation caused by the Struggle!" Her glasses got a bit tilted, but that was quickly corrected.\n\nShe felt rather frantic waiting for Iovinus' response, who was still occupied by sifting through the charts and papers she had provided him with. "I... see, Freya." Oh no, he wasn't satisfied! Where did she go so wrong?! "There is no doubt that you've discovered a good opportunity for us." Success! Boreas bless! "But I am rather worried about you. When is the last time you had a good night's sleep?" Clasping his claws beneath his beak, the Duke stared at her with apparent concern.\n\nThat made Freya catch a gasp, fluttering her wings in distress, even swaying her tail left and right. "I-I... my Duke, you've entrusted me to do business on your behalf, and I couldn't possibly disappoint you. It is like you said, remember? That you needed a break from everything stressful?" Hopefully that would convince him, even if he was... almost right.\n\nIovinus would only wearily sigh. "Doesn't mean you have to suffer instead of me." With that, he would tell her..."

eyrie_freya.12.d_good:0 ""You've done such an excellent job, and I could not be more prouder of you." Iovinus, the ever charming griff, invited Freya to join him for a celebratory dinner. "At some points, I thought I'd have to intervene, but that wasn't the case. Neither have I heard any complaints from the... usual suspects." Now there was a familiar tone in the old bird's words.\n\n"I'll admit myself, my Duke, there were many times where I despaired and doubted myself, but everything turned out alright. Sometimes, the best decision was to simply let the others do their job instead of hovering over them." Freya took a decent bite of her steak, cooked to ideal texture. "Even if most of the times, I know what's best." She would grin, and Iovinus chuckled at her playful arrogance.\n\n"Now you know how I felt all these years making the hard choices, yes. Dare say it was rather selfish of me to throw my burdens onto you, and it would be proper time I took them back. You won't mind that, would you?" The question was rhetorical, for he could do anything he wanted, but the Duke was a fan of courtesy.\n\n"Not at all, not at all, but what about your family? Don't they need you more?"\n\nHis gaze was enigmatic. "Have no worry about that, it's been settled." Iovinus raised the wine glass with much delight. "To your health, Freya, and may you continue doing what you do best!""
eyrie_freya.12.d_bad:0 "Deadlines. Obligations. Paperwork. The Guard needs more idols.\n\nFreya could not tell how long she had been lying with her beak to the table, thoughts melding together in a strangest sort of delirium. Curtains were draped over the windows, meaning she could not tell either whether this was all some sort of alcohol-induced dream, or was she being... tardy again. No! Not tardy! She was perfect! She did everything right, just as the Duke wanted!\n\nSharp knocks on her door briefly stumbled her out of the panic attack, but before she could articulate a proper response, it swung open, with Iovinus' figure passing through. Freya would blink in annoyance many times, adjusting for the light he just turned on. Was it really that dark in here?\n\n"Haaaa— g-good day, or evening, my Duke! Apologies for the office, I was just... busy." Her table never looked this bad, strewn with empty plates and disorganised papers. Not a problem, just a minor slip up. "How... may I help you?"\n\nHer worst fears turned to life as Iovinus gave her a rather cold glare. There was none of the usual warmth he had regaled her with. "I am disappointed in you, Freya. I know you have high standards, and I appreciate that, but you've shown yourself unable to do my responsibilities. I've heard a lot of complaints from the others, and not just from the griffs I don't like." No no no no no...\n\nSomething broke inside her, the beaming Treasurer reduced to a sobbing wreck. "P-please forgive me, Iovinus, I was just doing what I thought was best!" Her tight bun came apart long ago. "You always said how you hated everygriff obstructing you..."\n\n"There'll be no further discussion, Freya. Take. A. Vacation.""

eyrie_freya.13.d:0 "Freya stared at the delivered schematics like they were written down by the Gods, or something close to them. She didn't care much for the pious, but this result was just like one of their parables where the lowly humble griffon achieved a great task through sheer persistence and diligence. And who was better at working hard than the Treasurer?\n\nOf course, she understood Iovinus' concerns, but this time he'd have to concede he was in the wrong. Although... she had herself worried sick whether this scheme would work out at all, and could barely do her tasks in recent times. Perhaps a day off should be indulged in... just this once."

Your intentions were noble, Freya Schattenriss, but perhaps you should direct your suspicion towards somegriff more deserving." The familiar scowl made it clear who she was thinking of.\n\nFreya had to give it to her, this was pretty useless. And the Prelature had some really lousy recordkeeping, which is why it took so long to process this. "My apologies, Prelate, I shall have the clerks compensated for the effort I've made them do. Believe me I meant you no disrespect with my actions, and that even I can be in the wrong." Though that was still a very rare occurrence.\n\nVerena's eyes slightly softened, recognising her diligence. "I bid you a good day, Treasurer. Walk in the Gods' light.""

eyrie_freya.15.d:0 "Freya felt... good. Meridiennes was everything she needed to clear out that lethargy that climbed up to her neckfeathers. It took her a few days to stop trying to sink into her usual routine, but the rest, oh the rest... The sights, beaches, exotic food, and even the few museums they had, she almost didn't want to leave!\n\nBut she had made her promise to Iovinus it would be three months and not a day more, and there he was waiting for her as she was climbing out of the airplane. One had to generously praise the Schreiber brothers for their invention, for Freya would certainly not even cross a third of the way on her own wingpower. Brushing aside the marvels of technology, she would reach the Duke. "Iovinus, I've returned! Is Verenia still in one piece?"\n\nChuckling, he offered to take her bags. "Everything was fine without you, Freya. You are my hardest worker, but you've also created the atmosphere where griffs are diligent and able." It was almost a shame she was proven wrong, but you can't win every flip of the idol.\n\n"You win this one, Iovinus. Vacation was just what I needed... but I should get back to my duties tomorrow. Oh, I also brought you a little present I found there..." She passed him a package from one of her suitcases."

Opulent..." The letters were written down in a quick, practised fashion. The Verenian Times could be rightfully considered a rag in terms of newspaper quality, but at least they had a good crossword section.\n\nOne could forgive thinking that the ever busy House Treasurer had no time to relax, but in truth solving these puzzles were one of her few respites (always done after lunch, complemented with a steaming cup of tea). "Twelfth row, 'the dead Emperor's most noted quality'..." Now that was a peculiar clue, but at least it was short. "Weary it is, then." It was perhaps the only time she had for herself between dawn and dusk.\n\nStill, her thoughts frequently wandered to that vacation she's been meaning to have for a while. How good it would be to simply lounge on some beach and enjoy the sun, rather than the cold halls of the grand palace. "Third column, 'the infamous Iron Chancellor'." Though she was very fond of most birds here, even frigid and distant Verena, there was no substitute for a good rest. "Didn't get to meet Guichard before he passed away, but he was a good role model if I do say so myself."\n\nIt was fortunate nogriff shared the room with Freya, lest they consider her a bit delirious. Filling in the few remaining empty spaces, Freya took a satisfied look at the completed puzzle, particularly the coloured squares which revealed today's solution: 'JOIN THE VERENIAN GUARD'. She couldn't help but to roll her eyes at it, thinking that the rag's editors must have had a surly griff in an uniform visit them recently."

Always an impressive sight, and their parade steps seemed much more mechanical than before, but a dour feeling quickly arose when he remembered how many times he observed this. Sometimes, he had wished that it were him in the place of a griff who never returned home.\n\nFlanking his side, the stalwart Guard-Captain looked satisfied for once. "Do you see, mein Herzog? Our soldiers are an unmatched force and they'll make quick work of our troublesome pretender. Clearly, von Grieslein was coddling the griffs too much, and I did not allow them to grow slovenly and disorganised." He would punctuate it with a salute for the marching troops.\n\nIgnoring the biting remark against his late friend, the Duke would retort: "I dearly hope they know more than just following the cadence's rhythm, Guard-Captain. Has everything regarding the agreed upon plan been realised?" A short affirmation would make itself clear, and Iovinus was left alone to brood in his mercurial thoughts."

One last grand battle for the ages, to determine the future of beautiful Verenia! At least, that's what he was certain the poets and minstrels would sing about. To no surprise whatsoever, Verena refused to attend, leaving Iovinus only with Roman and Freya.\n\nThe candid tones they exchanged suggested that at least these two had a much more functional relationship. Every time Freya would ask of a technical detail, a small minutiae, or something entirely out of her domain, Roman would slowly and carefully explain, and she would take another note on her ever-present clipboard. Would that everygriff treated him in such a manner.\n\n"Iovinus, is there anything you'd like to add? The Guard-Captain just finished elaborating on his plan, and I must say I feel quite certain of our chances. I'll make sure that he has everything needed from my side." Admittedly, the Duke drifted away from the discussion and couldn't quite tell what was he supposed to say.\n\n"That won't be necessary, Freya, I believe that the good captain made a solid scheme for our success."

Daydreaming would have to wait, as now they had to be prepared for another assault.\n\n"Bördsdorffs, Eitelkeits, Landsgrafs and others, bravest of my captains, noblest of my courtiers. The hour is dark and we stand on the precipice of yet another invasion, the likes of which we cannot withstand divided. Will you fulfil your oaths and promises to House Eyrie and Verenia?" From his father's throne, Iovinus made his plea, all in accord with ceremony, and packed with lies.\n\nOne after another, all these griffons of high pedigrees, came forth to renew and swear their allegiances. At least they were smart enough not to cause a scene right now, yet after everything was said and done, Iovinus still had to negotiate with each and every griff to secure proper assistance. Some offered everything they could reasonably provide in idols and griffs, while the others refused to send anything more than a token force.

Now he and the Guard-Captain were poring over the map, tiny figures everywhere but primarily around the Aranti river, with a smaller bunch behind it.\n\n"What about the Weinguts? Are they sending their forces or not?" So much was at stake here for Iovinus.\n\n"Affirmative, Elke has confirmed two hours ago that their regiments are on the way." Roman would neatly move one of the figures closer towards the frontline. One less problem for the Duke.\n\n"Freifrau zu Falkendorff's estate is right next to the river, why hasn't she mobilised her griffs yet? Vincent won't be so courteous to announce his arrival by mail." On second thought that sounded just like his thing, that conniving thief.\n\n"Exactly why she refuses; she believes that it is better off trying to hold down a fortified area in the rear. Does not make much sense to me, but still better than desertion." A passing figure passed a report to the Captain, who would quickly digest this new information.\n\n"And the paladins? Will they do anything besides sitting in their temples?" Gods preserve us all.\n\n"Movement has been spotted, but uncertain so far." For once, he did not offer a sneer or taunt, too focused on the current situation. Iovinus could only sink deeper into the chair, hoping for the best."

Alas, nogriff came.\n\nIn fairness it was Iovinus' choice to sequester himself far from the others. The less suicidal officers of the Watch, Roman included, invited him to join at the war council, but the thought of spending any more time than necessary near them made his wingfeathers stand up. Curse their arrogant know-it-all hides. All these years they've second guessed him, constantly acting in contrary to his wishes... Let them have it, then. If their leadership results in victory then everything would be great, and if not, he was sure Vincent would be saving a noose for them as well.\n\nThe Duke dug up a bottle of something strong he was saving for a special moment.

Despite the stubborn hostility from his so-called benevolent and responsible liege lord, he had no choice but to put trust in Roman's master plan. It was not flawless, but it achieved everything that was needed: Verenia was liberated from traitors, and peace returned after almost 30 years.\n\nAnd now, the doddering Herzog bestowed upon him a great honour. The Struggle's stress had left a mark on Iovinus, and he desired to take a more claws-off approach to focus on his family, rather than the minutiae of statecraft. Nothing wrong with that, and the Markgraf could certainly spend more time in Angburg himself if it weren't for his duties. In his place, Roman would lead Verenia, ensure it was strong and vigilant, and have a free claw in correcting everything Iovinus was too lazy to fix. This was but the first of respects he very much deserved, and Roman was now on top in all but name. With further success, he would end up lauded to the point of antonomasia as the "Great Captain"! Surely he earned that much after defeating those worthless foppish paladins.\n\nDaydreaming would have to wait, however. There was much work to be done, and no time for slacking. Straightening his uniform, Roman gave one more look to the glass. Prim, proper and orderly, as everything should be."
eyrie_roman.5.d_coup:0 ""Congratulations, Roman, you're practically the Herzog now." Officer Berger raised her glass in toast.\n\n"Still just the Markgraf, Herjöna, but I'll take whatever praise I can get." The gesture was returned, and the Guard-Captain felt very satisfied about himself. Verenia was saved from traitors, the incompetent Duke was pushed aside, and now the good and noble griffons could get to work. The party's other attendants made similar comments, and everygriff felt they were very much justified and moral in their actions.\n\n"In fact, I don't see why are you keeping Iovinus around if we made this risky gamble." Officer Forsbergs interjected, already inebriated with spirits. That griff could never resist the liquor's call.\n\nMust everything be explained to intricate details? "Because, Alraune, we did not struggle for over 30 years just to usurp Verenia to ourselves. As much as I have my disagreements with our 'beloved' Herzog, he is a beacon of stability and presents a calming figure for the lowly masses. We shall simply work behind his coattails in making sure Verenia is strong and vigilant." Besides, not every noblegriff supported this coup and made it clear they would not tolerate replacing him. Additionally, Iovinus already made it clear he wanted more time with his family, so all this worked out in their favour. Shame Roman didn't have time for his, but that would be resolved later.\n\nThis reasoning sated the listeners, and quickly whispers and plots were made how to ensure that everything would be rigged in their favour, and most importantly, exclude those who were not in this scheme. The self-proclaimed "Great Captain" (much to Roman's dismay, the title hasn't quite caught on yet) had much to do."

eyrie_roman.6.d:0 ""Guard-Captain, there is something you must decide." How lovely those words felt to Roman. Now he was the bird making all the decisions and not that layabout Iovinus. With a rare smile on his beak, he'd turn to face Herjöna.\n\n"Yes, what is it, officer Berger? Is something wrong?" Pleasant, polite and courteous. Smartly saluting, she seemed less hesitant.\n\n"If you read this morning's edition of the Verenian Times you'd know that there's been an exposé over numerous members of the Guard abusing and exploiting the peasants. Way above the level we could cover up." She would take off her cap to hold it in claws. "It's always been a problem, and we tried punishing the worst, but your recent order to have the Guard assist in rebuilding Verenia hasn't turned out ideally. Apparently, there's also complaints from watchgriffs that they're not compensated enough."\n\nThat content expression quickly turned sour, and not just because Roman thought the Times were a rag only good for kindling. "If they are guilty, then simply punish them. You do not need my permission for everything." Something also had to be done about the meddlesome "free press", but later on that.\n\n"And we were about to do so, Guard-Captain, yet reviewing the list showed a large number of griffs are part of the logistics corps reform you wanted to enact for a while. Disciplining them would mean we'd have to delay it, or even scuttle it." It couldn't get worse, or so Roman thought. After a long exhale, he made his decision."

At first it was simply a few more papers to sign and orders to give around, but now it felt like every single griffon wanted Roman's time of the day to solve their problems. If he didnt know better, he would swear the Duke had arranged this just to make him suffer.\n\nBut the Captain was better than this. Perhaps he bought his commission like every other officer, but he understood that when the going gets tough, it's important to endure. Thus he measured his options with this latest conundrum in his claws.\n\nIt was almost time for the yearly festival of piety, with all the usual spiritual nonsense, and all that had to be done was approve the expenditures, divert a few of the Guard to watch over the proceedings, the boring drivel. However, a few days ago some Arcturian priests came along and asked if the celebration's main event could be shifted in favour of the war god.\n\nHe would have immediately agreed, having no real issue with the matter, but then he recalled that frightful, terrible bird in red. Roman would never admit it openly, and he tried to cover it up with his loud beak, but the Prelate of Eyr was one of his few fears. Sometimes he would swear she could smite anygriff with a bolt of red lighting if so desired. Those priests promised a great reward, but was it worth angering her?"

It's not that he didn't like the company, or the opportunity to dress nicely (Guard-Captain uniform, as always), but he would much rather be around smaller numbers. Such as his weekly meetings with the House Treasurer, who knew a thing or two about fine spirits...\n\n"Truly the event of the season, Markgraf!" Yes, yes it is, altgräfin Freud. Just like the one they have each month.\n\n"Who had Pocket Pastries ordered for the banquet? Such a rustic addition!" Gräfin von Geisslerg, you could stand to eat something that didn't cost a watchgriff's yearly salary, for once.\n\n"I am concerned about our Duke, he hasn't attended a party in a while..." Officer Forsbergs, married to the bottle, was already in high swing gossiping to whoever would listen to her.\n\n"I don't know who's going to afford it, but commercial automobiles are the vehicle of the future. Who's with me in this venture?" Freifrau zu Falkendorff had so far resisted collaborating with the Herzogswerke, perhaps this was an opening...\n\n"Herr Roman, terribly sorry for the bother, but we were wondering if you could assist us in this dispute..." Briefly stumbling as he realised this wasn't the place to say some empty words and move on, Roman was in the midst of tittering sycophants, their eyes over him, expecting a response. Only issue was that he had completely tuned off their droning, and said the first thing that came to his beak..."

How long did they intend to act so stubborn and recalcitrant? It wasn't like he was plucking feathers from chicks with his co-conspirators!\n\nOne of them, the Gräfin von Geisslerg, tapped a clawtip against a wineglass, raising to deliver a declaration. "I believe we should offer our compliments to our wonderful host, the Markgraf von Angburg." As it should be. "His respect for tradition and the rights of nobility means we can all sleep safe in our beds. His bravery and courage keep our borders defended." The hollowness of those words, the blatant mocking tone challenged Roman's honour in front of everygriff. That cheating, good for nothing—\n\nFortunately, the Landgräfin Weingut made a retort in his stead, suitably deflating that worthless accusation before the others got any ideas of their own. This was just the most recent thrust in the verbal battle that's been going on the entire evening; even the Guard-Captain was getting sick of it.

"Regardless of such, Freya, such a deal should have went through official channels. Even you have no knowledge of this business, do you now?" One could never trust merchants. First they burned down Calembourg in 978, would have probably done the same to the rest of Verenia, and Boreas knows what else they're doing! This time, the Guard-Captain caught wind of those idol filchers making arms deals without involving the Guard.\n\n"You are quite right, but it still presents an opportunity for us, wouldn't you agree? This deal seems quite lucrative, and the amount they are trading is nowhere near sufficient to attempt any sort of rebellion, that much I know from my... side ventures. We'll simply enact a little tax on their unexplained newfound income, and keep an eye out for anything suspicious." Roman liked many things about Freya, but her calculating mind was perhaps his favourite. If only he had more officers like such in the Watch.\n\n"I... suppose you are right, but I still do not like it."

Endless responsibilities.\n\nLandgräfin Weingut, one of his more trusted allies, withered before his gaze. "M-my apologies, Markgraf, but you must understand, resource prices are record high this year and we had to choose between skipping on quality or quantity. You've said before, it was most important that everygriff in the Guard had what they needed." Her claws kept shifting together as she nervously rubbed them.\n\nYes, well, what good was that when just this month there were plenty of accidents involving faulty materiel? "I understand."

Thus when the other nobles approached him, voiced their great dissatisfaction with Iovinus' action, he was more than happy to act the leader, as it naturally suited him. After all, his house was the most prestigious one following the Duke's, and there were scores to settle.\n\nThe Guard-Captain got what he wanted, but when did everything go wrong? When did his so-called allies started to question his every decision? When everygriff started trying to pull the blanket of power in their direction, offering even the most absurd solutions, just to make their voice sound the loudest? When did their sincere help start turning into a loan with huge interest rates? When did the authority of Guard-Caption start to crack at the base? Did it even exist or was it just an illusion that the lying nobles kept feeding to suit their purposes? What was he supposed to do now? Crawl back to Iovinus and tattle on them? The Duke made it clear Roman was in charge now, and already he hated it very much. To get stabbed on your own sword so quickly...\n\nSomething had to be done before this disobedience threatened Roman's position.

Primal instincts demanded of the Guard-Captain to take flight and flee, yet bravery failed him as the Prelate's form quickly appeared before him, clutching a thick tome. Gods save him!\n\n"One would think—", her tone was low and menacing, "—that a captain of the Guard would not demand help right after inflicting disrespect. So called nobility that only knows how to hold a fork and knife, with no manners whatsoever." The book was raised to forever crush Roman into paste.\n\n"WAIT!" It didn't matter to the Captain that he was about to painfully expire, but something had to be said in his defence. "I-I truly need your a-aid, a problem has arisen larger than both of—", but Verena had no mercy.\n\n"Problem, yes! I've heard plenty what you've caused with your glory seeking actions. You've done this to yourself, and I shall relish your doom once it transpires. Now leave before I summon Sigrid on your worthless hide."

It is for the good of Verenia."\n\n"Good for Verenia, or good for your hide?" She did not grace him with eye contact as the central brazier was stoked. "I've heard plenty about what you've caused.

"I did not agree with your actions against Iovinus, Roman... but I'll admit, you got results done. Pity you did not check your "allies'" more thoroughly. Now, could you explain more precisely who are plotting against you?" Freya's comfort was practised and reassuring.\n\nIn truth Roman did not know just how far deep this conspiracy against him went. It could be just a few of the most unscrupulous nobles, or everygriff west and east of the Aranti. What he did know is that idols went missing, important appointees would get sacked without reason, and the Ducal Court became a very hostile environment.

Only one could muster the bravery to respond. "Beg pardon, Markgraf, but you've insisted, quite strenuously, in fact, that we do not spare any cost on quality. Unless you are interested in pocket change, there are no available idols for your personal projects." Punished for basic demands!\n\nHe could only cover his face in claws. "Alright. Alright. Is there anything you can offer me then? What results can you give?"\n\nOne of the meeker birds spoke up. "We've just completed the improvements on the rifle model as you've requested." Sheets of paper would get passed along, Roman looking at them with disinterest. "The first series have already finished production, would you like us to continue in this effort?"\n\nRoman loved a good gun, but right now he only felt disappointment. "Fine. Now get back to work."

Brunhilda played partner for him, against the team of Alraune and Herjöna, while Kara was the umpire.\n\nAfter the umpire was finished with the setup, the game began. The objective of Roman's side was to secure a hill position from the enemy. While Roman was used to being on the defensive, he accepted the challenge and formulated a cunning plan with his teammate. Soon enough the two had given the umpire the first written orders for their units. To their enemies' surprise, the umpire moved Roman's units around the hill, rather than towards it. At the same time, Brunhilda's artillery battered the hill, inflicting heavy casualties after a roll of dice.\n\nFollowing the decisive opening, the game continued for a while. Roman continued to execute his strategy while Brunhilda suppressed and distracted the enemy. Then, during one of the enemy's turns, the umpire placed a unit on the map that had until now been hidden from sight.\n\nStunned, Roman stared at the map. His light infantry regiment that he hoped to use to envelop the enemy line in a pincer manoeuvre was about to get attacked by an entire company of knights. With it, he knew that his strategy would fail, and the opposing force would soon overrun his overstretched and thin positions. Looking up, Herjöna's proud smile was replaced by a more restrained or even fearful expression when she saw him.\n\n"That was... most excellent. A substantial improvement from last time."

From his lofty vantage point on the balcony, he admired their gleaming panoply and practised marching (but not overly so, lest the paladins grew jealous), firmly believing that victory would be at claw now.\n\n"All I have promised, and more. You never had any reason to doubt us, Herzog." He would note the Prelate's self-satisfied tone, yet his curiosity burned with the desire to know just how did Verena convince not one, but two minor knightly orders, with all their companies and heavy equipment, to march down here for what is most assuredly a conventional conflict.\n\n"Others do not share your sentiment, Prelate." Indeed, quite a few of the nobility have done everything they could to worm out of their contracts, leaving him with a much smaller force than he'd wish for, even with the knights. "But we do not need them with these impressive warriors. What are their terms of payment?" Always so few idols to go around...\n\nVerena would remain tightbeaked. "Sigrid has already resolved the matter." Focusing his gaze, the Duke could see the Knight-Commander with the foreign knightly leaders, and he couldn't help but think how yielding they seemed. At least some were compliant when they should be... as the battle for Verenia was about to begin."
eyrie_verena.4.d_war:0 "The day could not arrive sooner. Fighting was heavy already, and Iovinus was at a disadvantage as many of the nobles refused to relinquish their forces, and the foreign knights were not in their full numbers. His gloomy despondence was averted however, with Verena bringing the good news: "Sigrid has just informed me that the remainder of the Romauan knightly companies have crossed the border, Herzog. Their forced march has given results."\n\nIf the Prelate seemed concerned in any way, her tone did not suggest it. Of course, it was not her neckfeathers Vincent wanted to pluck, unless he was as much of a savage as Iovinus suspected. "Not a moment too soon! Have them join the other forces with great haste." Will it be enough? At least the knights weren't asking for any sort of compensation, though he didn't know that as Verena remained tightbeaked just how she convinced them to come down here. What he did notice, however, was how the Knight-Commander effortlessly pushed the foreign knightly leaders around.\n\nAlready some of the more cynical griffs ordered digging trenches around Calembourg.

That suited Iovinus just fine, who was quick to approach the central brazier, seeking contemplation on the cold floor, the dancing flames giving plenty of thought. Did he make the right choice? Would everygriff fall in line as they should?\n\n"Our Herzog shouldn't demean himself by sitting on the floor."\n\nA sideways glance caught the sight of the familiar voice, and Iovinus could barely hide his surprise seeing Verena without her circlet, and hood lowered. Yet she too would have a seat on the floor some distance from him. "This is not a social call, Prelate. Everygriff has their individual struggles and battles." Not just ones caused by illegitimate siblings.\n\nFor a moment the Prelate's stern expression seemed softer, more vulnerable, almost like somegriff more approachable. This weakness would not last for long. "All of us... are doing what they can. Struggling is a part of life sparsely enjoyed, but all too necessary. We must simply hold faith for the best, if not simply acceptable, outcome."\n\nHer words took his heart in a tight grip, and his thoughts wandered to Corinna and the others."

She was always of the firm belief that life was hard and unforgiving, and she extended the same kind of harshness to her decision making process. Verena used to be naive, she thought Verenia could be healed with words and compromise, but instead it had to be purified with fire and blood.\n\nThat was the simple part. Much to her surprise, the Duke had ordained her to continue with her reforms. Verena never sought power, but now she was the second most powerful griffon in the realm, and that was not without controversy. So much sickness to be cured, and difficult decisions will have to be made. The wicked and the corrupt will continue to oppose her at every step of the way.\n\nBut she would rise to the challenge. She would not falter in her unenviable task. Faith was all that was needed, and both her and the paladins proved themselves worthy of the Gods' attention. Verena resolved not to disappoint Them, nor Iovinus.\n\nSoft clinking of armour interrupted her thoughts. "Verena, it is time for our day's tasks."

This pleased Verena greatly, as it should, but the others were less pleased for rather... material reasons.\n\n"If they're going to use our hospitality, they should very well pay for it." So spoke Gräfin von Geisslerg, which Verena dismissed out of claw, yet as traffic increased so did the demands to enact some sort of tax, tariff, toll, tithe or tribute. Principles demanded from her to refuse this pressure, yet Verena had to admit that despite Iovinus' miserly policies, there was always a lack of idols.\n\nIt wasn't right, but... a small demand now could improve so much for Verenia later on. Didn't she owe that to everygriff?"

The recruit had nothing to say, playing more the part of furniture as he was observed by his two authority figures.\n\n"It was not my idea, Verena, it came from the Guard." The steely Knight-Commander was keen in finding imperfections in the recruit's form, yet there were none.\n\n"The Guard! Must they involve themselves with everything like a group of gossiping chicks. Paladins serve a grand purpose, and they are not servants to some cowardly bunch who could not shoot straight even if their life depended on it. What good would come from letting them be instructors for the Watch?" Undoubtedly they would come across corruptive influences...\n\n"Those 'cowards' could learn from them. And should they falter, the paladins will make sure they rise up again." Though Sigrid made good points, Verena could still not trust it. What if it was some noble scheme to subvert her authority? It would do her no good to antagonize them further, but they had to be brought to heel. Iovinus would want it just as much. The recruit was finally given permission to leave, as the Prelate made her choice."

At least, that's what Verena remembered from temple school, and when was prelate Waldemar ever wrong? Still, one could easily recognise how much of an influence one could hold over the chicks with the right lesson.\n\nThe idea of a standardised, compulsory education is somewhat novel in these lands. Those fortunate enough to be born wealthy could have all the tutors they wished, and those unfortunate enough to be orphans (like Verena) relied on eleos, but everygriff in between wildly varied in quality and scope of their erudite skills. It was her task to correct that, but there had been... debates on that recently.\n\nThe fools at the Ducal Court wanted to cut out most of the religious topics and let the chicks' heads be filled with various vacuous drivel. The nerve, the outrage! If griffs paid more attention to what mattered there would be no such rot like Stallionism or Kemerskainism pervading society. But, Verena was smart enough to consider not every battle was worth fighting, and that there were plenty of other options when it came to ensuring growing griffs would be pliable and amenable to her teachings."

Few things were as unpleasant as having to make requests before the Ducal Court, with these vultures staring down Verena as if she demanded their heads on a platter, as the ever impassive Iovinus observed. But just as he was about to state his opinion, one of the ponces interjected, and the cavalcade came loose.\n\n"I do not trust this Erion! This is a ploy to subvert Verenia from within!"\n"Erion canes chicks, steals from the needy, and is a very bad griff!"\n"We don't need foreigners! Verenia for Verenians!"\n"What if he doesn't want to leave? What if he steals our land?!"\n\nMany complaints, with very little substance. If she could, Verena would bring her claw to her beak in exasperation, but pride demanded that she stood tall and unrelenting. The rabble was soon quelled as the duke brought order through a tone that overwhelmed all the others. "That's enough, Vizegrafin! Were you not taught manners? Although I have my reservations about the proposal, the Prelate has not said anything about 'letting the Archon steal our idols', so discuss it properly!"\n\nWith her mood already greatly soured by the whole performance, the rote task of answering more reasonable inquiries proceeded in a much more composed fashion, though scepticism continued to abound.

eyrie_verena.11.d_exile:0 ""They should be made an example of! Clasped in irons! [674.owner.GetAdjective]s are defiling its sacred grounds, we must liberate Romau at once!" Verena was rarely furious, and even less so hasty, but some transgressions could not be tolerated in the slightest. Even if her memories of her time in Romau were less than pleasant, she had a principle to uphold and she had hoped Iovinus would see it too.\n\n"With respects, Prelate, this is not something we have the means to achieve." The ever taciturn Duke dashed all her hopes at once, leaving Verena to believe everygriff and everything was always against her. "Instead, may I suggest something more reasonable?"\n\nThe only thing reasonable would be leading a holy war to restore the rightful rule of the Eyrite Temple. Alas, it had to be recognised that Verenia was... far from a mighty realm that could exert its influence and force. There was something she could do, however. "I... yes, the Archon! We could shelter Erion and his retinue, and it would surely show that we are devoted to a higher purpose!" Zeal was never far from her mind, nor quick solutions. There was just the matter of arrangements to be made...\n\n"Let us not make this decision without considering the consequences. This is not a social call to be made lightly, the Archon's presence could stir some... resentment, both here and far away. It needs to be deliberated with the others, I have told about you about the necessity of compromising."

"It is good that you came to me with this, Prelate, but you know this isn't possible, right? Grover's law does not allow the Temples to collect tribute—"\n\n"The law is but letters on a paper. It can be changed." Verena herself did not care for idols, but there were plenty of others under her guidance that needed them to achieve her work. If only griffons could be taught to rely less on greed, but such was their endemic trait. One surprisingly not present on this idol counter.\n\nFreya would cross her claws on the desk in what Verena proclaimed as her "lecturing" pose. She did not like being lectured. "That is fine and true, however, the Duke had some insistence on what we could not do..."\n\nThere it was again. This constant obstruction she faced in everything!

Each and every success in our lives, is praise for the Gods: proof that we can arise above our struggles." With all her obligations, it would come as a surprise that Verena still had time to hold her sermons, yet it was something she would never neglect. The flock came first, and the rest second.\n\n"Look around you. Our land, once despoiled, at the brink of ruin: now a peaceful and prosperous realm. It was your effort and dedication that made it all possible." The attending griffs held their beaks high in a rare showcase of approval from their stern Prelate, but the praise was for Verena as well. Pride was Boreas' virtue, and how could she not feel proud after the Duke rewarded her for a task well performed? Even the nobles had to begrudgingly admit that.\n\n"Yet the labours never cease, and there is another obstacle to overcome. Look to proper guidance and you shall never stray from the righteous path." Yes, Verenia would have appropriate guidance, under the divine law... One followed by a pious society, one that Verena crafted through her efforts, where everygriff had a purpose and was not abandoned to uncaring whims. Shifting to adjust the burdensome headpiece, she would see Sigrid standing at the back of the temple, professing one of her rare smiles.\n\nIt was all just right."
eyrie_verena.13.d_bad:0 "Verena had never felt this much... exhaustion. The more she pressured, the harder they resisted, and the Duke's task was never quite near completion. What she has done was to protect Verenia from imbecility, time and again, but there was no praise for that. The nobles branded her a tyrant, but was there any other way? How easy it was to complain when you're sidelined. Such mercurial thoughts continued to occupy the Prelate's mind as she and a few chosen paladins, Sigrid included, marched their way to the grand palace. Iovinus summoned her, undoubtedly for much deserved accolades.\n\n"The way is barred, Verena. Some griffs stand in our way." Her Knight-Commander's remark barely registered, before raising her glance to the figures ahead. Such regal bearing could only mean nobles, and that made her seethe further. Pushing past the armoured procession, the Prelate demanded explanation: "What is the meaning of this? Out of my way, for I have a meeting with our good Duke."\n\nThose tittering sycophants, one and all, laughed in her beak. "Our most sincerest apologies, your highness! But you must understand, that we believe you've been wearing your britches a size too large." The group in the back chortled at the height of comedy.\n\nThe absolute nerve! The disrespect! Verena never wore britches to begin with! She got forward into... whoever it was, Graf Betrug's beak, and with a low growl continued: "Then I would sincerely suggest to stand aside before issues arise."\n\n"Or what? Who do you think you are, lowborn scum?" What followed was a shouting match between the two embittered parties, of unmatched enmity and spite. Verena gave as good as she got, more than a match for many, but she did not see the glint of a gun's barrel coming until it was too late. The next world did not come for her as a heavy claw shoved her to the ground, stunned as the previously inert paladins lunged against the cowards. In a haze, she would see Sigrid lying on the ground, unharmed yet her armour dented, and felt a surge of anger unlike any before. The Duke would understand."

This... snake would offer false niceties, and when her back was turned, Erion would exploit her clergy, disregard his responsibilities, and in general, did not act the way he preached.\n\n"Prelate Festfeder! We have a meeting with the Duke within the hour, present yourself at once!" And now she was reduced to playing the entourage. With much loathing and seething, she would emerge from the side-room, gracing the Archon's benevolent presence.\n\n"My apologies." There was a distinct lack of others in the room. "Have I not assigned you an attendant? I specifically instructed her not to leave you unless ordered." Though she would not punish the poor griff regardless.\n\n"You have shown me great hospitality, but it would seem others are not as faithfully loyal to me as you are. Small courtesies for a humble realm." But the matter that incensed Verena the most was the fact her noble rivals were entirely correct: inviting the Archon had no benefit whatsoever for anygriff, unless one enjoyed receiving passive-aggressive remarks. "Let us not tarry any further on the unimportant: I would hate to have your Duke wait on us. Perhaps he will show me the respect I deserve." Just like that, he already strode beside her, as if the paladins were waiting outside with a carpet extended.\n\n"As you wish." In truth the Prelate considered plenty already in the last two weeks whether could arrange for Sigrid to cause an "accident", but the consequences of such would be too great for Verenia to bear, even if it would've been extremely satisfying."

Unlike Sigrid, who insisted on her full panoply (sans the helmet) wherever she went. Dedicated, yes, but perhaps a bit too much.\n\n"You've grown quiet, Sigrid." It was met with an unamused stare. "More so than usual. Tell me, what goes on your mind? This is not a social call, you may speak freely." Awfully casual from the Prelate, but there was a need to unwind. As precious as they were, watching the chicks play in the grass could only amuse her for so long.\n\nThe paladin briefly stopped on the cobblestone path, undoubtedly planning to spend her few words in a very eloquent manner. "Ours is an unenviable task, Verena. How have you endured for so long?"\n\nWere it any other griff, the Prelate would brush it off and reaffirm her piety, but Sigrid was one of the very few who saw how fragile she could be. She took her time to collect an appropriate response. "I might be incredibly stubborn." The briefest of smirks crossed Sigrid's beak. "But in truth I did not have the most easygoing experience through life." To put it mildly. "I am aware my methods do not inspire much love, but if the end result means the griffons of Verenia have a better life than I did, then it will all be worthwhile."\n\n"Hm." Silence reigned between them, until at last, it broke: "There are few worthy of admiration, Verena. I do not agree with everything you do, but I firmly believe that your heart is in the right place. There is no path I won't follow you through." Truly, in this dismal world, Sigrid was her only friend, and her resolve was reinvigorated."

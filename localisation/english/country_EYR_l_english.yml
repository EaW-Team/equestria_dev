EYR_fifth_onslaught_desc:0 "Our reliable sources have confirmed what we all dread: Vincent Erie, the self proclaimed Duke of Erie, is preparing a yet another attack against his rightful liege lord. The true ruler of Verenia must rally his soldiers, marshal his defences and prepare his people. House Eyrie does not bow before insurgents and mutineers."

E_E_rivalry_eyrie_desc:0 "§gSun-and-Moon,\nonce united and now divided,\nas Eyr weeps for her children.§!\n\nThe bitter feud between the rival houses of Eyrie and Erie - both houses as irreconcilable to each other as the Sun and Moon, day and night - has led to decades of incessant internecine violence between the two heavily militarised houses. Both leaders of the houses claim to be the rightful and legitimate Duke of Verenia, and both of them refuse to negotiate with each other. The violence will likely continue until one side proves triumphant."

It is widely believed that Eyr blessed the fields of Verenia, giving them an abundant bounty.\n\nPerhaps Eyr watched over Verena as well, given her unlikely rise to the respectful position of prelate. She never knew her parents, her only relation was a sister that disappeared in the chaos of 978. Subsisting purely on eleos of the local temple, her only comfort in life was dedicating herself to the Triarchy. A good and righteous cause, for in a world full of misery, it was the duty of all griffons to bring comfort to the weary.\n\nHer assignment in Verenia was only meant to be a temporary one, but local conditions made her stay permanent. Time and again, she championed for the cause of peace and reconciliation between the Three Houses, but her pleas and prayers were routinely ignored. Additionally, as the prelature is officially in control of the Paladin Order, many of the local nobility distrust her, believing she's pursuing an agenda of her own. Already a stern and uncompromising griff of the robe, this treatment has steeled Verena's faith further. Only a scant few are righteous enough to pass her test of purity, and woe betide anygriff who end up the target of her admonishing gaze.\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!: Rari"

#### EVENTS

eyrie.1.t:0 "A Brief Recollection Of Events"
eyrie.1.d:0 "I am Iovinus, heir to the Verenian legacy and patriarch of the noble house Eyrie, who have ruled these lands for centuries. For many years, I have been locked in a dynastic dispute with my irresponsible older half-sibling Vincent. How I loathe his irrational, thoughtless behaviour. It was I who should have succeeded to rulership after the horrid republican uprising, which left many family members dead, but he would not concede to the fact that it is House Erie that is subservient to House Eyrie.\n\nNow, there's been little peace, and even less respite. I watched many young and promising griffons march to the riverfront, only to learn that they've perished. It is their duty to serve their liege lord, yes, but I do not wish to throw lives away. None of this should have happened. Lady Amelinda, she helped with her surprising defection, but remained a mystery with her intentions. Her daughter Katrina will have to see reason in the end. It is my Gods given right to rule Verenia, and restore her splendour to how it was.\n\nEven less fortunately, the commonfolk despises us, and I cannot blame them. Forced in a struggle they have little sympathy or understanding for, living in fear and uncertainty. I promised to myself to restore their well-being, but for now they must give their all. However, I can count on a few but reliable assortment of griffons in my quest, the most prominent among them being my newly minted commander of the Ducal Guard, Roman. His family carries little prestige, but I see great potential in him. There is also my dear Freya, a graduate from Yale whose economical knowledge carried the day many times, and the inscrutable prelate of Eyr, Verena. She is not on my payroll, and quite frightening, but helps keep the peasants in line a little longer. Amusing, how they fear the divine more than us.\nThis story has been dragged on for too long. How will it end? Nobody but the Gods know, and they don't talk."

eyrie.333.t:0 "Troubling Behaviour"
eyrie.333.d:0 ""Have you heard what Duke Iovinus did yesterday?" Greta, a scullery maid, spoke to her friend and colleague as they worked together to scrub the hallway's floor.\n\n"No, I was busy with my obligations till late at night. I had no time for listening to gossip." Ingrid retorted, with little joy in her labour.\n\n"Ah, see, I heard about this from the gamekeeper, who heard it from one of the noble's valets. Duke Iovinus and his entourage were having a dinner, the usual stuff us servants never get to see or have, when suddenly, he jumped on the table—"\n\n"Was this griff drunk? Duke Iovinus is a picture of impassivity, it's almost frightening how nothing bothers him."\n\n"No, no, he swore it happened. That the Duke, he climbed on the table, with madness in his eyes as he furiously waved his claws and spread his wings. The poncy nobles were all in shock, listening to their master ramble about 'being the one' and 'ending the cycle of despair'. I couldn't believe it myself until I had it checked with the others."\n\nIngrid was shocked, to say the least. She had no love for her station in life, but the Duke, he was a respectable employer and never did anything wrong, as far as she knew. "And then what?"\n\nGreta waved her claws in a shrugging motion. "His wife dragged him away before he could start throwing the main course. Kicked and screamed to resist, too.""
eyrie.333.a:0 "What's gotten into Iovinus?"

eyrie.666.t:0 "Where Everything Ends"
eyrie.666.d:0 "The air was cold and still within Iovinus' quarters. Another day spent making difficult decisions, another day spent wrangling with his subordinates, every day a little harder to bear. He had been hanging at the end of his rope, under the weight of anxiety he hid deep beneath a shroud of confidence and bravery. Spending much of the night unable to sleep, thinking about his family, his legacy, his beautiful Verenia. Sitting at his desk, writing a letter intended for his wife, he would finally succumb to his exhaustion.\n\nA quiet creak could be heard, followed by silence.\n\nThe soft noise would be enough to wake him up, but what he saw then exposed just how insignificant he was. A figure stood before him, black as the sky outside and as silent as the room around them. The shrouded griff looked off, almost blurry and unfocused, like it was trying to be multiple things at once. Its presence made the Duke feel warm and peaceful, yet nervous, frightened. It would reach with a long, desiccated arm, opening its claw to Iovinus. He looked at it with confusion, briefly glancing at the figure's face. There was nothing, just a slow nod and a whisper.\n\n"It could be your time."\n\nWhat time? He already spent most of his lifetime wasting under his burdens. If only it would all end already so he didn't have to worry anymore. His mind was telling him to reject anything the figure offered, but... He was so tired of everything."

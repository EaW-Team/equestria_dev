#### FOCUS

EYR_convene_court:0 "A Meeting In Haste"
EYR_convene_court_desc:0 "Our reliable sources have confirmed what we all dread: Vincent Erie, the self proclaimed Duke of Erie, is preparing a yet another attack against his rightful liege lord. The true lord of Verenia must rally his knights, marshal his defences and prepare his people. House Eyrie does not bow before insurgents and mutineers."
EYR_the_yearly_obligations:0 "Arms, Armour, Idols"
EYR_the_yearly_obligations_desc:0 "Waging war is all about supplies and logistics, for what good is a griffon if he has no weapon or ammunition? Recent events necessitate a forced increase in the production of materiel, all paid for from the Duke's personal treasury. A small investment that pays great dividends for the continued survival."
EYR_what_we_must:0 "In Defence Of Eyrie"
EYR_what_we_must_desc:0 "Soldiers, knights, peasants, merchants, nobles - they all fight for House Eyrie, directly or indirectly. The time is right for them to be placed on high alert, to muster their capabilities, for a storm is coming, and we must all work together in all our capacity to weather it."
EYR_assign_new_commander:0 "The Promising Candidates"
EYR_assign_new_commander_desc:0 "Previous week, the commander of the Ducal Guard passed away in his sleep, presumably spent from a lifetime of dutiful service. While his contributions will not be forgotten, and honoured properly, this leaves a gaping hole in our command structure that must be quickly rectified. There are noble griffons who would love to carry the mantle, but the Duke has his own plans already."
EYR_take_personal_command:0 "Assume Direct Control"
EYR_take_personal_command_desc:0 "Previous week, the commander of the Ducal Guard passed away in his sleep, presumably spent from a lifetime of dutiful service. While his contributions will not be forgotten, and honoured properly, Duke Iovinus has no choice but to personally exert his command over the armies of the Sunlight Shield, until a suitable replacement can be found."
EYR_militias:0 "Peasant Militias"
EYR_militias_desc:0 "They grumble and complain, but the lowly have an obligation to their betters that is simply unavoidable. It is not exploitation, but rather a continuance of a social contract that has defined relations between griffons since ages past. To arms, peasants, for House Eyrie!"
EYR_river_defence:0 "The Reliable Bulwark"
EYR_river_defence_desc:0 "The great river that divides House Eyrie from House Erie has long served as a focal defence point against Vincent's clumsy assaults, though the same could be said when we attempted to capitalise on his weakness and cross it ourselves. Nonetheless, our defensive doctrine relies on its impregnability, even if we are prevented from building larger scale fortifications."
EYR_defence_plan:0 "Surviving The Onslaught"
EYR_defence_plan_desc:0 "It doesn't take a new Arantigos to figure out how to improve our chances against Vincent's rabble, but the newly minted Commander of the Ducal Guard, Roman Eitelkeit, has a few additional strategies in mind. They must be thoroughly discussed and elaborated upon, if their implementation is to become a viability."
EYR_fuck_off_vincent:0 "Those Who Never Falter"
EYR_fuck_off_vincent_desc:0 "Vincent Erie is but a pitiful mongrel, unworthy of even ruling the smallest patch of land, much less proud Verenia herself. For all the might he boasts of, it will inevitably crash against our strongholds, our gallant defenders. The song of war claims Verenia once more, and this time we shall be the victors without uncertainty."

E_E_rivalry_eyrie:0 "War Of Two Houses"
E_E_rivalry_eyrie_desc:0 "§RTwo households, both alike in dignity,\nFrom ancient grudge break to new mutiny,\nWhere civil blood makes civil claws unclean.§!\n§W--------------§!\nThe bitter feud between the rival houses of Eyrie and Erie - both houses as irreconcilable to each other as the Sun and Moon, Day and Night - has led to decades of incessant internecine violence between the two heavily militarised houses. Both leaders of the houses claim to be the rightful and legitimate Dukes of Verenia, and both of them refuse to negotiate with each other. The violence will likely continue until one side proves triumphant."

#### EVENTS

eyrie.1.t:0 "A Brief Recollection Of Events"
eyrie.1.d:0 "I am Iovinus, heir to the Verenian legacy and patriarch of the noble house Eyrie, who have ruled these lands for centuries. For many years, I have been locked in a dynastic dispute with my irresponsible younger half-sibling Vincent. How I loathe his irrational, thoughtless behaviour. It was I who should have succeeded to rulership after the horrid republican uprising, which left many family members dead, but he would not concede to the fact that it is house Erie that is subservient to house Eyrie.\n\nNow, there's been little peace, and even less respite. I watched many young and promising griffons march to the riverfront, only to learn that they've perished. It is their duty to serve their liege lord, yes, but I do not wish to throw lives away. None of this should have happened. Lady Katrina, she helped with her surprising defection, but remains a mystery with her intentions. She will have to see reason in the end, as well. It is my Gods given right to rule Verenia, and restore her splendour to how it was.\n\nEven less fortunately, the commonfolk despises us, and I cannot blame them. Forced in a struggle they have little sympathy or understanding for, living in fear and uncertainty. I promised to myself to restore their well-being, but for now they must give their all. However, I can count on a few but reliable assortment of griffons in my quest, the most prominent among them being my newly minted commander of the Ducal Guard, Roman. His family carries little prestige, but I see great potential in him. There is also my dear Freya, a graduate from Yale whose economical knowledge carried the day many times, and the inscrutable prelate of Eyr, Verena. She is not on my payroll, and quite frightening, but helps keep the peasants in line a little longer. Funny how they fear the divine more than us.\nThis story has been dragged on for too long. How will it end? Nobody but the Gods know, and they don't talk."

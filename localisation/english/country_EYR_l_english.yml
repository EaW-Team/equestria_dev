#### FOCUS

EYR_fifth_onslaught:0 "The Fifth Onslaught"
EYR_fifth_onslaught_desc:0 "Our reliable sources have confirmed what we all dread: Vincent Erie, the self proclaimed Duke of Erie, is preparing a yet another attack against his rightful liege lord. The true ruler of Verenia must rally his soldiers, marshal his defences and prepare his people. House Eyrie does not bow before insurgents and mutineers."
EYR_sudden_death:0 "An Unexpected Passing"
EYR_sudden_death_desc:0 "After a sudden bout of illness, Captain Otto von Grieslein of the Verenian Guard has passed away. Though he was unable to break the stalemate, his tenacity and skills have ensured that the Aranti defence line remained strong. A new Guard-Captain will have to be chosen, but in the meantime, the Duke has requested a day of mourning."
EYR_take_control:0 "Take Matters Into Our Own Claws"
EYR_take_control_desc:0 "We must break this vicious cycle of war. No more will we be the defenders in Vincent's game. If we want things to change, we must go on the offence!"
EYR_empower_prelature:0 "Cooperate With The Prelature"
EYR_empower_prelature_desc:0 "Those who keep claiming that the Prelature is running a conspiracy with the foreigners, at the expense of Verenia, are clearly misguided and irrational. Though the paladins' defection years ago was treacherous, those who remained have clearly proved themselves to be trustworthy. Only with them standing by our side can we end the Struggle."
EYR_empower_merchants:0 "Cooperate With The Middle Class"
EYR_empower_merchants_desc:0 "After the republican revolution, we placed several restrictions on merchant trade. Admittedly, this has hampered our economy and kept our country from growing. Though we haven't excused them of the guilt, we should consider giving them a bit more autonomy in exchange for their support."
EYR_invite_foreigners:0 "Invite Foreign Assistance"
EYR_invite_foreigners_desc:0 "Let us be honest: our soldiers are not the best. The constant battles have whittled down our best soldiers and our equipment has become faultier over the years. If we want the upper claw, we need to reach out to more fortunate lands for help."
EYR_overrule_hof:0 "With The Duke Or Against Him"
EYR_overrule_hof_desc:0 "The nobility have been obstructing, scheming and even disobeying Iovinus for too long. Let it be very clear from now on: they can either fall in line or they can end up like the secessionists west of the Aranti, and their family's possessions will be forfeit to the Duke."
EYR_press_paladins_into_service:0 "The Return Of The Paladins"
EYR_press_paladins_into_service_desc:0 "After the late Duke's death, most of the paladins joined Vincent in his rebellion. The remnant remained loyal to the Prelature, maintaining neutralily to protect the holy sites. If we can show our new resolve to the paladins in the temple, they may join Iovinus in ending this war."
EYR_deal_with_flowena:0 "Flowena Backroom Deal"
EYR_deal_with_flowena_desc:0 "Being on the other side of House Erie's lands, Flowena would have a lot to gain – and lose – from the war. Perhaps they'd be willing to split with some gold and equipment, or even join our cause? We should reach out to them about an alliance."
EYR_fuck_off_vincent:0 "The Restoration Of Righteous Rule"
EYR_fuck_off_vincent_desc:0 "Vincent Erie is but a pitiful mongrel, unworthy of even ruling the smallest patch of land, much less proud Verenia herself. For all the might he boasts of, it will inevitably crash against our strongholds, our gallant defenders. The song of war claims Verenia once more, and this time we shall be the victors without uncertainty."
EYR_new_captain:0 "Appease The Nobles"
EYR_new_captain_desc:0 "As unfortunate as his death is, we cannot leave Guard-Captain Otto's position vacant. Vincent's forces are mounting across the river as we speak. Desperate times call for desperate measures, and so we must cooperate with the more... warmongering side of the nobility."
EYR_convene_court:0 "A Meeting In Haste"
EYR_convene_court_desc:0 "Quickly! Gather the council! We cannot relax against the face of an invasion. Every aspect of our country will be affected, and if we ignore a single possibility, we will lose this war. We must plan accordingly for these next few months."
EYR_the_yearly_obligations:0 "Arms, Armour, Idols"
EYR_the_yearly_obligations_desc:0 "Waging war is all about supplies and logistics, for what good is a griffon if he has no weapon or uniform? Recent events necessitate a forced increase in the production of materiel, all paid for from the Duke's personal treasury. A small investment that pays great dividends for the continued survival."
EYR_fund_economist:0 "Adjusting The Books"
EYR_fund_economist_desc:0 "War is an economic torment for the Duke of Eyrie and his lands. Maintaining a standing army is incredibly expensive, and thus we are struggling to complete the mobilisation in face of this new attack. However, the House Treasurer is an incredibly gifted administrator and should be able to achieve such, though it will come at a considerable expense."
EYR_the_prelature:0 "Beseech The Prelature For Aid"
EYR_the_prelature_desc:0 "With the mobilisation experiencing many issues, it is clear we won't be able to bring our full strength against House Erie's assault. While our defensive position ensures that we can hold them off with inferior numbers, it would be good to even the odds with the help of the paladins. These gallant warriors, always prepared for war, will make up the deficit, but their help comes with a cost."
EYR_what_we_must:0 "In Defence Of Eyrie"
EYR_what_we_must_desc:0 "Soldiers, knights, peasants, merchants, nobles - they all fight for House Eyrie, directly or indirectly. The time is right for them to be placed on high alert, to muster their capabilities, for a storm is coming, and we must all work together in all our capacity to weather it."
EYR_militias:0 "Peasant Militias"
EYR_militias_desc:0 "They grumble and complain, but the lowly have an obligation to their betters that is simply unavoidable. It is not exploitation, but rather a continuance of a social contract that has defined relations between griffons since ages past. To arms, peasants, for House Eyrie, for Verenia!"
EYR_defence_plan:0 "To Counter Their Plans"
EYR_defence_plan_desc:0 "The villainous Vincent is a crude oaf, but it is not he who decides strategy. His subordinates are far more competent and effective, no doubt hatching some ingenious plan, and we must decide on our own strategy to effectively counter any surprise they might have. The Duke will be holding a meeting with the new Guard-Captain and his officers."
EYR_holding_fast:0 "Surviving The Onslaught"
EYR_holding_fast_desc:0 "We've rallied as best as we could, and war is inevitable. It is certain that the other side of the riverline can see our stalwart defences, yet they remain committed to their attack. Let them break once more, and only then shall we surge forward to put an end to a Struggle so great that claimed to many lives."

EYR_stalemate_reigns:0 "Stalemate Reigns"
EYR_stalemate_reigns_desc:0 "The Duke is most displeased with his disobedient underlings. There was a clear plan, agreed by everygriff, and it was not followed. It's only the smallest of condolences that we're left with a ceasefire, as if nothing happened, though that's no satisfaction for all the perished souls. Something has to change in this broken house."

EYR_the_state_of_the_treasury:0 "Review Finances"
EYR_the_state_of_the_treasury_desc:0 "The House Treasurer is a griff of unparalleled ability when it comes to managing the idols. It's certain that without her, the soldiers would be reduced to wearing sacks instead of uniforms, and the economy would revert to bartering. Relying on her substantial abilities could result in House Eyrie prevailing in the Struggle without those unruly nobles."
EYR_the_local_economy:0 "Address The Road Problem"
EYR_the_local_economy_desc:0 "The constant usage of our infrastructure, primarily for military purposes, has resulted in their deterioration. There is simply little resources left for maintaining them, but recent developments have given us an opportunity to correct this. However, desires differ while there's only so many idols to go around..."
EYR_consoomer_goods:0 "Putting The Unsuitables To Work"
EYR_consoomer_goods_desc:0 "Serfdom continues to be a common sight in Verenia, for better or worse. It is simple and straightforward to build new factories, but the shortage of labour makes them produce much less than they could. Something has to be negotiated to allow these griffs without rights to put their labour into something far more valuable than plowing some fruitless field."
EYR_solving_resource_deficits:0 "Expand Mining Industry"
EYR_solving_resource_deficits_desc:0 "Abundant fields aren't the only quality Verenia possesses, but there are a number of promising veins where natural resources are plentiful. Though we are currently self-sufficient for all our domestic needs, unlike that incompetent stooge across the river, growing industry will demand a larger quantity of them. Best to preempt the problem."
EYR_funding_a_solution:0 "Supplementing Inadequancies"
EYR_funding_a_solution_desc:0 "Unbeknownst to most, the House Treasurer runs an illicit scheme. A most dangerous one, in arms dealing, which has been a decent source to supplement our middling production. The Duke has been considering expanding these operations, but they'll need a better cover, lest the nobles discover they are being shortchanged."
EYR_embargo_vincent:0 "Offering A Better Deal"
EYR_embargo_vincent_desc:0 "Even though most nations refuse to take any part in the Struggle, ordinary trade continues to flow. This is what allows Vincent to stay afloat despite completely neglecting the needs of his subjects. Perhaps, if those same nations were offered an incentive to cease their trade, House Erie will be in a far more disadvantageous position for the final battle."
EYR_better_weapons:0 "Firearm Modernisation Scheme"
EYR_better_weapons_desc:0 "From the humble musket to today's rifle, firearms have seen considerable advancement over the centuries. Freya has only a passing interest in them, but she knows that having the best weapon results in highest chance of success. Simple mathematics, as it is, which is why this is a pursuit that deserves funding."
EYR_devil_deal:0 "To Sell Pride And Blood"
EYR_devil_deal_desc:0 "Flowena's bankers present an united front, but some would be happy to work behind the backs of their colleagues for a good deal. Freya happens to be friends with one, and he could circumvent the blockade their banks unjustly exert on House Eyrie. Nothing comes free, however, but concluding the Struggle would be worth any price they name. As long as we don't end up selling Verenia to them as a result."

EYR_touring_the_barracks:0 "Tour The Barracks"
EYR_touring_the_barracks_desc:0 "Though the Guard-Captain is a griff of rough temperament, the soldiers readily follow him, whether out of fear or devotion. To reassure the troops that their liege lord does care for them, Iovinus shall take his time to visit the injured, and perhaps give out medals where appropriate. Of course, the primary goal is to define the new defensive plan, and prevent a repeat of recent events."
EYR_factory_expansion_project:0 "Industrial Expansion Project"
EYR_factory_expansion_project_desc:0 "Verenia is not the richest of regions, but that doesn't mean its production capabilities should be outsourced to some idol grubber from Rottendedam. Instead, we should provide incentives for our industrial magnates to expand their options, hire more workers, all those boring things. Some kickbacks are to be expected, but as long as House Eyrie benefits as a whole, it can be tolerated."
EYR_repair_forts:0 "Save What Can Be Saved"
EYR_repair_forts_desc:0 "What little fortifications we have are on the verge of crumbling, and much effort is placed into maintaining them as best as possible given scant resources. Many reasons prevent us from expanding them into a formidable structure that could keep Vincent's rabble at bay, but for now we should give them the attention they deserve."
EYR_tithes_and_tribute:0 "The Duke's Amazing Collection"
EYR_tithes_and_tribute_desc:0 "Like any proper noble, Iovinus has an extensive collection of artwork, coinage, apparel and precious metals. Such vast value that could fund entire regiments to fight on our side... if he could be convinced to part with any of it. Certainly, it could be bought again after the war... and if he's not victorious, then he'll have larger problems to worry about."
EYR_enact_conscription:0 "Replenish The Guard"
EYR_enact_conscription_desc:0 "It is difficult to ascertain how many griffs are currently serving in the Verenian Guard, for many reasons. Yet the most recent bloodshed has raised concerns that our effective strength is insufficient to resist the next attack. There is no doubt it is arriving, sooner or later, which is why the quotas must be expanded and new regiments raised for the Duke."
EYR_calm_the_nobles:0 "Having A Ball"
EYR_calm_the_nobles_desc:0 "In such uncertain times, we must turn to our traditions and reassure the most important griffs that everything is fine. The grand palace has not held a party since the days of peace, and don't our gallant nobility deserve a night to relax? The merchants and other such undesirables will not be allowed to attend, and they better not complain either!"
EYR_righteousness_of_our_cause:0 "Convincing The Peasants"
EYR_righteousness_of_our_cause_desc:0 "It comes without surprise that the Struggle is not a very popular concern for the people. After all, they have far more worries in their lives than fighting for some distant, uncaring lord... But perhaps a sufficient amount could be convinced otherwise. By word or reward, and some creative interpretation of truth, there could be more volunteers for the cause."
EYR_hold_court:0 "A Day In Court"
EYR_hold_court_desc:0 "One of the many obligations the Duke owes to his subjects is holding court on a yearly basis. There, they present their grievances and requests, after exhausting all other means of satisfaction, and the gracious ruler either obliges or dismisses their demands. Generosity can inspire the people, but choices made can have a long lasting consequence."
EYR_aerial_advantage:0 "Different Vector Of Attack"
EYR_aerial_advantage_desc:0 "Some nobles are proponents of technology, and realise that if we want an actual advantage, something has to change. Through their Herzland contacts, they could secure us aircraft that are beyond House Erie's ability to counter. The only issue is instructing griffs to operate these machines on a quick notice, but that could be corrected by simply hiring experienced ones."
EYR_officer_training:0 "Correcting Knowledge Gaps"
EYR_officer_training_desc:0 "The officers of the Verenian Guard, by requirement all nobles, are not bereft of skill in war, but combat is an always changing problem. With the knowledge gained over the decades of Struggle, we should devote some resources to teaching present and future ones how to perform more effectively. It may be crucial in the coming days..."
EYR_unassailable_defence:0 "Come And Take It, Vincent!"
EYR_unassailable_defence_desc:0 "The unruly ones have been restrained, and this time there shall be nothing going against the plan. The river Aranti shall choke with their dead, but the plan must be flexible. Like a cornered snake, there is no telling what sort of desperate gamble Vincent will perform. We need to be prepared for anything, and the Guard-Captain will ensure it is so."

EYR_the_temple_of_eyr:0 "Spiritual Respite"
EYR_the_temple_of_eyr_desc:0 "While many put distrust in the Verenian Prelate (and are rightfully afraid of her glare), Iovinus does not share this attitude. He understands that the resources under her control could be crucial for the unification, even if many others believe he's making a deal with Maar by doing so. Nonetheless, there is nothing that can prevent the Duke from attending a sermon."
EYR_look_for_the_poor:0 "Comfort For The Needy"
EYR_look_for_the_poor_desc:0 "The Struggle has left many griffs destitute, due to taxation, crippling injuries sustained in a battle or other unpleasant outcomes. Thus there's a large amount of homeless which even the Temple of Eyr struggles to provide for. If the Duke were to give them a claw, it would show his devotion to the Gods, and more importantly remove the loitering vagrants from the streets of Calembourg."
EYR_pleb_schools:0 "Spreading The Right Wisdom"
EYR_pleb_schools_desc:0 "Education is by tradition a luxury reserved for the more well-off, leaving many to rely on common folk "wisdom". Present circumstances are not favourable for enacting some sort of full scale mandatory schooling policy, but we could spare some idols in this direction. Of course, we'd make sure that the knowledge shared would be favourable towards us."
EYR_bless_the_fields:0 "Land's Bounty"
EYR_bless_the_fields_desc:0 "The many legends of Verenia credit Eyr for the plentiful miracles that have occurred in its long and storied history. While proving the influence of the divine is like trying to fight dragons bareclawed, the rituals provide griffs a sense of comfort and security that is hard to inspire otherwise. As always, the Prelate will be happy to perform them, if given the resources."
EYR_the_paladins:0 "The Proud Ones\nOf The Triarchy"
EYR_the_paladins_desc:0 "Continued cooperation with the Prelature is putting Iovinus in an unenviable position. The nobility are finding many excuses and loopholes to decrease their griffonpower contribution, convinced that the Duke is selling out Verenia to foreign interests. What ridiculous notions! Yet there is little other choice but to reintegrate the paladin remnants into the household forces."
EYR_tax_of_piety:0 "Eyr's Eleos"
EYR_tax_of_piety_desc:0 "Per the ancient laws since the days of Grover I, the temples do not collect any sort of taxation or tribute; they subsist by donations or their clergy's contributions. Laws can easily change with a ducal signature, and it would benefit the Prelature if they were allowed to take one tenth of the serfs' taxes. Some of it would find its way back into matters the Duke desires."
EYR_strike_fear:0 "Fear Of The Divine"
EYR_strike_fear_desc:0 "There are many a griff in Verenia who are quite lacking in basic erudition. Superstitious, frightful, quite easily cowed into believing something they shouldn't. The Prelate retains many contacts on the west side of the Aranti river, and if the right message were to spread... Vincent would have quite a scuffle on his claws."
EYR_archonate_friends:0 "Our Friends In Romau"
EYR_archonate_friends_desc:0 "While prelatures are mostly independent from the desires of the archonates, there are still certain niceties to be observed. With her contacts in Romau, Verena could decisively change the outcome of the Struggle in our favour. The only questions that remain is whether the nobility will accept this foreign interference, and the sort of price Erion XII would exact from us."

EYR_the_iron_duke:0 "The Iron Duke"
EYR_the_iron_duke_desc:0 "This farce has been put to an end, after such an extraordinary amount of time. No more shall imbecilic Vincent or naive Katrina stand in the way of Verenia's rightful ruler! Now comes the time to trample whatever is left of their petty schemes, quash any ideas of a revolt, and bring back the good times before 978. Never again shall the Struggle ruin lives."

EYR_loser_faggot_vincent:0 "Punish Vincent"
EYR_loser_faggot_vincent_desc:0 "The madgriff of Erie, in all his bluster and arrogance, certainly believed he would return to Calembourg! That he has, in irons and chains as he awaits the Duke's sentence. His fate is sealed, but it only remains to be seen what sort of humiliation will he suffer before that."
EYR_dealing_with_rebels:0 "And The Remainder"
EYR_dealing_with_rebels_desc:0 "There are a multitude of minor houses that followed Vincent and Katrina in their goals, and we have captured a majority of their members. Some have fled across the borders, abandoning their homes and families, but those are of little concern. Instead, it should be decided whether these rebels have any place in Verenia's future, or will they meet ignoble ends."
EYR_deal_with_katrina:0 "But Go Easy On Amelinda's Successor"
EYR_deal_with_katrina_desc:0 "Katrina has been a most puzzling conundrum. First she tried in vain to settle the Struggle with peace, then she allowed herself to be overruled by her supposedly loyal captains. The traitors have already been dealt with in a manner which they deserve, but the question remains what to do with this nearest blood relative. Could she be an asset, or simply trouble?"

EYR_praise_the_advisor:0 "On Merit And Competence"
EYR_praise_the_advisor_desc:0 "If history books ever dedicate themselves wholly to the Struggle, they'll write that one of the Duke's advisors played a key role in ending it. Honest service and dedication must be rewarded to encourage the lesser servants to continue striving for favour."

EYR_a_step_back:0 "Taking A Step Back"
EYR_a_step_back_desc:0 "The good Duke, spent from his many years of struggle and work, wishes to retreat from his obligations for a while. His most favoured advisor shall take a more active leadership role in Verenia while he takes a much deserved rest with his beloved family."
EYR_the_obliging_nobility:0 "The Obliging Nobility"
EYR_the_obliging_nobility_desc:0 "Do we not have an obligation to our subjects? It is no secret that Vincent and his clique were exploiting the peasantry to the bone with their taxes and quotas. To show that we are their rightful and just masters, the nobility will spend some of their hard earned idols into the wellbeing of common griffons."
EYR_stealing_vincents_junk:0 "Make Use Of Their Innovations"
EYR_stealing_vincents_junk_desc:0 "With defeat imminent, many who served the secessionists have abandoned their masters in great numbers. Of particular attention is one inventor named Fabrice, who was providing great innovations for the former lord of Erie. His whereabouts are unknown, but his factories and workshops remain, with their prizes left for us to take."
EYR_noblesse_oblige:0 "Poverty Solving Measures"
EYR_noblesse_oblige_desc:0 "While some believe that a peasant deserves nothing more than the clothes on their backs (and even that is too much), the truth is that a destitute griffon is a worthless one. With no hope or opportunities in life, they are nothing but vagabonds or loiterers. A bit of welfare would go a long way in preventing societal upheaval, as well."
EYR_militias_go_home:0 "Relieve The Militiagriffs Of Their Duty"
EYR_militias_go_home_desc:0 "Perhaps it is difficult to turn a rifle into a ploughshare, but what's certain is that we no longer have a need for the militias that were hastily raised in the climax of the Struggle. Let them return to their homes, tend to their families, and help us out in rebuilding Verenia."
EYR_digging_up_resources:0 "Prospecting For Resources"
EYR_digging_up_resources_desc:0 "Industrial development demands further base materials. For the most part we've done well with what was at our disposal, yet our continued growth means resource shortages will become inevitable. To avoid indebting ourselves to a foreign power, it would be better to conduct geographical surveys and figure where we can find the best return on investment from digging out metals."
EYR_lords_into_barons:0 "Noble Lords Into Robber Barons"
EYR_lords_into_barons_desc:0 "Who better to complete the industrial revolution than our best and noblest? They are the only ones with the capital to sustain these changes! Some have already pioneered the process but much has been prevented by the Struggle. Nonetheless, it is clear now that agriculture will never be as profitable as industry, and thus we must seize the opportunity before those thieving merchants."
EYR_dredge_river:0 "Harshest Scar Of The Struggle"
EYR_dredge_river_desc:0 "Beautiful Aranti has turned into an eyesore worthy of Maar. It is our obligation to restore it to its previous splendour, to clear out any remaining shells, and give anygriff still lying there a proper burial service. Only this way can the land become usable again, and the riverine trade shall flourish as well."
EYR_guard_professionalisation:0 "Guard Professionalisation"
EYR_guard_professionalisation_desc:0 "The Verenian Guard have shown their valour in the Struggle, but it remains an outdated force, unsuitable for anything more than protecting borders and cities. Now that tentative peace has settled for a while, the political will to push those sorely needed reforms has greatly risen, yet there will be plenty of debate on how to proceed."
EYR_about_feudalism:0 "The Debate On Serfdom"
EYR_about_feudalism_desc:0 "For many, efficiency is a key value. Much like how griffons abandoned slavery as an economic model many centuries ago (unlike the savages down below in Zebrica), serfdom is starting to show its age in a world where menial labour is pushed out by increased automatisation. Many nobles cannot afford to keep their serfs, but they will not give up on their privileged status."
EYR_jobs_jobs_jobs:0 "Nogriff Without Work"
EYR_jobs_jobs_jobs_desc:0 "Toil and labour, the essential part of anygriff. Continued development has created many jobs yet there are still shortages in our vital industries. The causes of this have been narrowed down to meagre wages and overly long working hours. It would be wrong to interfere in a free market too much, but some reforms are needed to remind the lower classes to be grateful we're giving them work."
EYR_defending_verenia:0 "Protecting Verenia"
EYR_defending_verenia_desc:0 "With reforms in place and the Guard growing in strength, we should establish preliminary plans for the defence of our homeland. Inevitably, somegriff will wish to enact their designs on beautiful Verenia, but we shall be prepared for what may come."
EYR_better_than_ever:0 "Business Can Only Grow"
EYR_better_than_ever_desc:0 "For the first time in a while, it can be accurately said that production has exceeded the amount of imports. What a milestone we've reached, indeed! Verenia is well on its way as a self-sufficient nation that won't depend on the capricious whims of foreign vultures. Still, a few more subsidies would do well in ensuring this positive state continues."
EYR_arts_culture:0 "Arts And Culture"
EYR_arts_culture_desc:0 "Iovinus has always had a reputation as a patron of the arts, and he has amassed a grand collection over the years. Some were sold to fund his victory, but he has recovered most of it and proclaimed his intentions to let everygriff culturally enlighten themselves (for a modest fee). It should certainly open up the lesser minds for greater ideas."
EYR_imperial_styled_warfare:0 "Cues From The Reichsarmee"
EYR_imperial_styled_warfare_desc:0 "The Imperial army was one of the most innovative forces, and that still holds true to this day. Truly, this should be a model to imitate for the Verenian Guard! Their latest doctrinal advancements will be studied and implemented in a suitable fashion."
EYR_peaceful_times:0 "Truly A Peaceful Verenia"
EYR_peaceful_times_desc:0 "Expectations were high all the way back in 978: it was believed Verenia would once more regain its prosperous status, if not for that thrice-cursed Republican Revolution! Nonetheless, the days of the Struggle are becoming a distant memory, and everygriff looks forward to the future, guided by their noble overlords."

EYR_remain_independent:0 "Verenia On Its Own"
EYR_remain_independent_desc:0 "Great powers play their own game, and Verenia shall not be a pawn in any. We have not fought so hard to heal this fractured land only to sell it off to the first bidder carrying a bag of idols. This is a strong and independent region, and it shall stay that way by our blood and pride."
EYR_simping_for_empire:0 "Adelina's Greatest Decision"
EYR_simping_for_empire_desc:0 "There is no shame in realising that you're simply outmatched. Indeed, the rising star of [GRD.GetNameDef] has led many to believe that if history should repeat itself, then it would be best to lay down our banner as Adelina did. But make no mistake: even servants can pursue their own agenda."
EYR_dynamic_exceptionalism:0 "Exhort Verenian Exceptionalism"
EYR_dynamic_exceptionalism_desc:0 "Is there any culture greater than ours? Who else can claim a longer legacy than beautiful Verenia, descendents of the firstborn? Certainly not those filthy Discrets, Grovers or any other griffs! Our citizens must know their history, so that they may take pride in their efforts for our country."
EYR_funding_intelligence_agency:0 "Intelligence Department"
EYR_funding_intelligence_agency_desc:0 "Planning relies on effective intelligence. Without foreknowledge of what could happen, we are left wandering in the dark, helpless as our rivals descend upon us. While espionage has always been a part of state activities, it now requires centralisation, focus, and no small amount of paperwork."
EYR_national_unity:0 "[Root.GetNationalUnityFocusName]"
EYR_national_unity_default:0 "In Service To Our Betters"
EYR_national_unity_alternate:0 "Imperial Development Aid"
EYR_national_unity_desc:0 "[Root.GetNationalUnityFocusDesc]"
EYR_national_unity_default_desc:0 "Though a servant's life can rightfully be described as full of toil, there is still pride in their work. Without devotion, their masters would not be as capable in making decisions, nor provide adequate rewards for their service. Instilling this mindset should be a rightful priority."
EYR_national_unity_alternate_desc:0 "Although our options are meagre, we are not useless. Fortunately, we have a powerful ally who can assist us in jump-starting our development. By showing our worth to [GRD.GetNameDef], they shall see it is worthwhile to share some of their industrial technology with us."
EYR_smash_arantiga:0 "Our Ancient Rivals"
EYR_smash_arantiga_desc:0 "Arantigans share our heritage of the firstborn, and as such relations have always been distrustful. Though Verenia has never had a great empire of its own to boast about, it would certainly provide us with great prestige to knock over the remainder of Arantigos' legacy."
EYR_buff_the_guard:0 "Verenian Guard Recruitment Expansion"
EYR_buff_the_guard_desc:0 "From frontline soldiers to uniform sewers, there are always available openings in the Verenian Guard. The past issue has been that we were unable to offer competitive salaries and benefits, but all that has changed with the end of the Struggle. A targeted campaign shall inspire many griffs to make use of themselves for a grand cause."
EYR_take_griffonstone:0 "Our Holy Birthplace"
EYR_take_griffonstone_desc:0 "Legends speak how our noble founder Kalem descended from the Hyperborean Mountains and settled the lands north of Lake Rumare.

Whether they felt that way out of misplaced pride or genuine contempt, none of them have held the honour of leading the Verenian Guard... until now.\n\nRoman considers himself a very pragmatic griffon. He sees a problem, and solves it in the most efficient way. He has little patience for the Duke's stalling strategy, and he has made that clear on many occasions. Even now, as the Captain of the Guard, he is forced to follow those orders, much to Roman's dismay. If he just could have been in charge when the whole rebellion started, it wouldn't have lasted for more than a year, or so he likes to think.\n\nNonetheless, the Guard-Captain is a capable leader, though not a creative one. His intense drilling standards ensure the common soldier is prepared for anything, who certainly don't need any poncy paladins! Perhaps, if Roman proves himself worthy by overcoming the vile secessionists, there could be a new rising star in Verenia.\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!: Bunnyshrubby"

It is widely believed that Eyr blessed the fields of Verenia, giving them an abundant bounty.\n\nPerhaps Eyr watched over Verena as well, given her unlikely rise to the respectful position of prelate. She never knew her parents, her only relation was a sister that disappeared in the chaos of 978. Subsisting purely on eleos of the local temple, her only comfort in life was dedicating herself to the Triarchy. A good and righteous cause, for in a world full of misery, it was the duty of all griffons to bring comfort to the weary.\n\nHer assignment in Verenia was only meant to be a temporary one, but local conditions made her stay permanent. Time and again, she championed for the cause of peace and reconciliation between the Three Houses, but her pleas and prayers were routinely ignored. Additionally, as the Prelature is officially in control of the Paladin Order, many of the local nobility distrust her, believing she's pursuing an agenda of her own. Already a stern and uncompromising griff of the robe, this treatment has steeled Verena's faith further. Only a scant few are righteous enough to pass her test of purity, and woe betide anygriff who end up the target of her admonishing gaze.\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!: Rari"

Could anygriff say they were wrong, given how far she has come? As one of the Duke's most trusted advisors, responsible for every idol in his purse, Freya has considerable leeway to act in the interest of her perfectionist tendencies. If it were her way, Verenia would be richer than Skyfall!\n\nUnfortunately, we all live in an imperfect world, and Freya constantly struggles with keeping the realm fiscally solvent. Whereas others throw money like it grows on trees, and not even on actually useful things, she uses every legal and illegal trick in the book to keep the economy going. Though with few loves in life besides work and fashionable outfits, Freya looks forward to the day when this mess is done with, the idea of a relaxing vacation on some distant island occupying her mind.\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!: Rari"

She had her disagreements with the actions, but ultimately the orders were followed. This earned Sigrid her first scars. What was going to be her crowning achievement — promotion to the exclusive ranks of the paladin-captains — turned sour as most of the Proud Ones followed Vincent Erie in his unlawful secession. Sigrid was the highest paladin remaining in the service of House Eyrie, which led to her ascension as commander... with very few of the benefits.\n\nDistrusted by the local nobility and restrained by the Prelature, the once proud paladin turned dour as she was consigned to sitting at a desk, unable to take the field as befitting of a warrior.

Gretel was one of the few lucky ones to escape, doing her best to lay low, which unfortunately included having to sell most of her valuables as a peasant with finery would be too conspicuous. This only served to increase the bitterness she felt for the ruling classes, not helped by witnessing all her friends and revolutionaries be cut down.\n\nNow those same elites have made their last mistake, and Gretel led those who remained from the initial revolt, as well as a new generation of disgruntled peasants to a vengeance that was long in the making.\n\n§YPortrait By§!:"

#### EVENTS

eyrie.1.t:0 "A Brief Recollection Of Events"
eyrie.1.d:0 "I am Iovinus, heir to the Verenian legacy and patriarch of the noble house Eyrie, who have ruled these lands for centuries. For many years, I have been locked in a dynastic dispute with my irresponsible older half-sibling Vincent. How I loathe his irrational, thoughtless behaviour. It was I who should have succeeded to rulership after the horrid republican uprising, which left many family members dead, but he would not concede to the fact that it is House Erie that is subservient to House Eyrie.\n\nNow, there's been little peace, and even less respite. I watched many young and promising griffons march to the riverfront, only to learn that they've perished. It is their duty to serve their liege lord, yes, but I do not wish to throw lives away. None of this should have happened. Lady Amelinda, she helped with her surprising defection, but remained a mystery with her intentions. Her daughter Katrina will have to see reason in the end. It is my Gods given right to rule Verenia, and restore her splendour to how it was.\n\nThe commoners despise us, yet more backlash comes from my supposedly subservient nobles. Instead of wisely digging in, time and again they've wasted our power on futile attacks. Worse still, they distrust the paladins, Verenia's sworn guardians.\n\nThis story has been dragged on for too long. How will it end? Nobody but the Gods know, and they don't talk."
eyrie.1.a:0 "The claw of fate guides us all."

eyrie.2.t:0 "Defence Of The Realm"
eyrie.2.d:0 "Iovinus was not pleased with the situation he ended up in. Yes, the impending attack was most worrisome, but he was far more happier with Guard-Captain von Grieslein, who had dutifully followed his attrition strategy, than the new Guard-Captain Eitelkeit, who was among the most vocal ones clamouring for a decisive strike. In spite of the fact that all previous attempts had failed, they continued insisting... and now one of them was in charge of the war planning.\n\n"Let us hear what you have prepared, Guard-Captain." While the Duke could overrule his subordinates, it would undoubtedly cause unnecessary friction. This was not a time for arguments, and they would either work together or die together.\n\nIn his tightly fitting uniform, the Guard-Captain looked very much like an imposing force that was not to be crossed with. Nodding wordlessly, he would stand up to present his strategy over the detailed map of the Aranti riverline. "Mein Herzog, with the limited time and resources at our disposal, there is little other recourse but to continue using our existing plans. However, with the help from our informants on the other side, orders have been prepared to reinforce areas we expect to bear the brunt of their attack." It was short, brief and to the point.\n\nIt was a surprisingly... reasonable course, and Iovinus could not offer any protests in the matter. The other, lower ranking officers of the Guard more or less agreed with their Captain, and only thing left was clearing some minor concerns. The Duke dearly hoped there would be no insubordination this time. He still remembered the last one."
eyrie.2.a:0 "Endure, we shall once more."

eyrie.3.t:0 "Overstretched Demands"
eyrie.3.d:0 "It was a straightforward plan: have the rabble crash themselves upon the riverline defences, then strike back once they were sufficiently weakened with losses and peasant grumbling.\n\nYet it turned out almost not at all as intended! The idea of holding the fort proved to be too much for some of the Watch Officers, who in their common disobedience started launching attacks against Erian holdings. To little surprise, it amounted to nothing and the current stalemate is a direct consequence of such. He dearly wondered what he had done to deserve such contempt and disrespect. What was going on in their thick bird skulls to act contrary to his well laid plans?\n\nThus Iovinus was forced into making an act himself, and through his contacts west of the Aranti, he knew Vincent would be willing to accept another ceasefire. What a farce this whole conflict turned out to be! The comforts of his warm room turned out to be less than pleasing as he awaited for his so-called loyal retinue to arrive, for their well-needed and much deserved scoldings."
eyrie.3.a:0 "Humiliation is the best teacher."

eyrie.4.t:0 "A Ceasefire Offer"
eyrie.4.d:0 "Vincent was not pleased in the slightest to have yet another invasion bogged down in a stalemate, but a gift from Boreas would show up at his doorstep today: that idiot Iovinus decided he was tired of playing war and wanted a ceasefire. Now ordinarily that would earn him a firm and sound rejection, but the sad truth that he heard yesterday from Cyrille was that House Erie was not doing too well either.\n\nEven better, there was an indemnity promised in this! Despite gaining nothing from this but a long list for burial, it sated his spite. However, things would have to change for next time, and Vincent resolved to take decisive action. First order of business was to get his underlings in order: undoubtedly they did a fair share of their own mistakes."
eyrie.4.a:0 "Take that, Iovinus! Sheepherding reprobate!"

eyrie.5.t:0 "Invasion Repulsed!"
eyrie.5.d:0 "Iovinus believed his plan to be satisfying, and for the most part it did: Erian attacks amounted to nothing, yet counterattacks fizzled out just as much. Many meetings were held with his command staff, but nothing could be decisively concluded as to why Vincent's rabble resisted so fiercely. Fortunately, a way out of this mess presented itself today.\n\nHis "dearest" sibling was tired of war and wanted yet another ceasefire, and offered a great deal of idols to make it so. If he were in a better position, it would be laughed out of the room, yet this would have to suffice for the time being. The warmongers would complain, but even they would have to concede that the situation is untenable. Now he would have to debrief with his officers and determine what could they have done better... undoubtedly they committed a fair share of their own mistakes."
eyrie.5.a:0 "Another spectacular failure from Vincent."

eyrie.6.t:0 "On A Minute's Notice"
eyrie.6.d:0 "When the dukes of the past moved from the fortress outside of Calembourg to the ostentatiously named "grand palace" (more of a fancier manor home, really) inside the city, they intended to keep it purely as a private residence. Practicality, however, resulted in a different outcome, and now Iovinus was taking a leisurely stroll to where Freya, the house treasurer, oversaw a small army of idol counters that kept his state fiscally solvent.\n\nThe large hall, dubbed the "administration quarter", was full of overly busy griffs. Desks were full of papers, and in some cases idols, assisted by primitive machinery that helped lessen the burden of mathematical calculations. If only everygriff could work so tirelessly and efficiently for his cause. Iovinus was quick to find the lady in charge, helpfully standing in the middle of the room.\n\n"How you manage this on a daily basis is most impressive, Freya. Where would House Eyrie be without you?" Large requests needed a decent amount of praise, of course.\n\nThe neatly dressed griff looked away from her clipboard, beaming with joy at her Duke. "Why thank you kindly, Iovinus!" He appreciated that she was comfortable enough to be informal. "There's nothing quite like fixing issues and trying to make them better. It's an endless chore, but the satisfaction is worthwhile. Now, what brings you here? Not much time for idle chat."\n\nShort sigh. "War's coming again, Freya. The mobilisation isn't happening quickly enough and I need you and your abilities to make it happen. My sources in House Erie say there's but a few weeks left." Why waste words trying to hide things.\n\nHer enthusiasm momentarily faltered, but she would turn around and pick up a few forms. "You should have come to me earlier, my Duke, but it won't be an issue. I trust I'm allowed to make the necessary expenditures?" If there's anygriff he trusted to spend money, it was Freya."
eyrie.6.a:0 "A real miracle maker."

eyrie.7.t:0 "At The Summit Of Eyr"
eyrie.7.d:0 "The disused fortress was the highest point near Calembourg, but within the city itself, the place of honour belonged to Eyr's temple which stood upon a hill. This was where Iovinus was headed today, despite the protests of his vassals: he wanted the paladins to help repulse Vincent's assault, and he simply couldn't mobilise enough of the regular forces in time.\n\nThe interior was ascetic in accordance with divine mandate, yet comforting in a way that was difficult to describe. Iovinus would briefly close his eyes and exhale, his worries briefly fading, before looking around for the griff on his mind. It was easy to find her, with that distinct circlet and hood, as he passed between several attendees who paid their Duke no heed.\n\nBut the prelate was occupied in conversation with her paladin protector, who sensed a figure approaching and turned her head around. "It seems we have an important visitor, Verena." Said paladin lowered her head deferentially, moving next to Verena, who regarded Iovinus with her usual cold gaze.\n\n"That we do, Sigrid. What can the Prelature do for our Herzog von Eyrie today?" Unlike her companion, Verena did not offer any sort of respectful gesture. It didn't bother him in the slightest for Iovinus was used to her unyielding behaviour.\n\n"There'll be another invasion soon, Prelate. I need the paladins to rebuff this attack." Short and to the point, as he always liked it. The pair exchanged glances and whispered between themselves, but he could tell Sigrid was welcoming the prospect of battle. Quickly would Verena address Iovinus again.\n\n"Are you prepared to meet the recent requests, mein Herzog?" A small nod. "Even knowing there will be displeasure at the court?" A more hesitant nod. "Then we are prepared to serve in the defence of your cause.""
eyrie.7.a:0 "The paladins march once more."

eyrie.8.t:0 "The Accountant's Thick Tome"
eyrie.8.d_helped_before:0 ""What you've accomplished last time was nothing short of spectacular, Freya. What good would all my soldiers be if they didn't show up for battle?" Indeed, Iovinus was most pleased with her work. Even though it felt very much like a cruel, twisted joke that the conflict petered out before it could ever properly begin, the only actual difference being how many memorial services occurred in the past few weeks. At least somegriffs were doing their job.\n\nThe good administrator smiled at the well deserved praise, holding her delicate glasses in a claw. "My Duke, I'm just doing what you're paying me to do. Although I do not deny that the effort required is great... it all turned out good in the end. If you can call the current situation 'good', that is." The spectacles found their way back to the tired expression.\n\n"I assure you, once this is all done and settled, we are all going on a vacation. I feel no less weary than you..." Long exhale, followed by a shake of his head. "Now then, I believe you had some good news for me, Freya?"\n\n"That is correct, Iovinus, the tax collectors and other assorted idol makers have concluded their rounds, and we have money to work with again. I've already deducted the amount needed for necessary future expenses, but there is still a sizeable amount remaining to be spent at your leisure." A paper containing several underlined numbers was passed, and the Duke briefly indulged a daydream what he would do with such a generous sum. First, the cold reality."
eyrie.8.d_no_help:0 "Iovinus felt slightly guilty over not giving more time for his favourite advisor, but circumstances simply got in the way. Nonetheless, he was always more than happy to be sitting in Freya's private office, sharing a fresh cup of tea and scones together. It always gave him a slight chuckle as he noticed that the room was hastily ordered into something more presentable.\n\n"I am no fan of carnage or violence, but I have to admit it was quite the sight to witness our paladins marching through the city streets, and out to war." As always, Freya multitasked her conversations with doing paperwork. "Please accept my apologies again for not meeting the mobilisation quotas in time, my Duke."\n\nIndeed, the paladins were quite spectacular in their armour, and of course their performance. Yet it did nothing to dissuade the nobility that they shouldn't look down on them. "And again, Freya, it was not your fault. Personally, I could have done much better myself to spread the information around, and give you plenty of time needed. Still, it turned out good enough, even if nothing has changed in the end." And that hurt the most. Trapped, with nowhere to go.\n\n"Very well, Iovinus, I will accept your word as the truth. The reason I've called for you today is quite simple: our idol gatherers have done their work, and we have funds to work with, even after reserving the necessary amounts for future expenses. How it shall be spent, I leave the choice to you." A paper containing several underlined numbers was passed, and the Duke briefly indulged a daydream what he would do with such a generous sum. First, the cold reality."
eyrie.8.a:0 "We could make use of this."

eyrie.9.t:0 "The Divine's Representative"
eyrie.9.d_helped_before:0 ""Turn your gaze, Verena, for our noble guest returns." Iovinus briefly wondered if these two were joined at the wing, given how rare it was to not see them together. "I shall return to my duties post-haste." With a servile bow, Sigrid brushed past the Duke and left the temple. If she suffered any exertions from the recent battle, the knight-commander did not show it.\n\n"Eyr's blessings upon you, mein Herzog. Did the paladins' performance impress you? It is such a pity that the righteous and just are considered untrustworthy by the envious." The reasons why the nobility wanted nothing to do with the knightly order was more nuanced than simple grudges, although it did seem petty like that at times.\n\n"We owe them our freedom, and may they recuperate well in the following days. Please extend me an invitation for the upcoming festival, but there is a more pressing matter at claw." The prelate's stern expression only allowed a brief change. "I like the current situation as much as you do. We can't persist in this Struggle forever, and I am willing to disregard the opinions of the 'envious', as you say, if it means putting an end to this farce. May I count on your and the paladins' support in the coming days?" It was as much pleading as Iovinus could allow himself.\n\nThe response didn't take long. "What you ask is unnecessary. The Prelature has always been at your beck and call, it is merely the unfortunate circumstances that prevent us from working together. To show our commitment, I will arrange for a donation to your cause. Make best use of it, for Eyr does not appreciate those who squander." This was... far better than Iovinus expected, but he needed to make sure none of his dealings were heard back at the court."
eyrie.9.d_no_help:0 "Iovinus could not recall the last time he visited the temple, and that fact shamed him; considering himself a rather reverent griff, he could do better. Nonetheless, the cold stone floors and the faint scent of fragrant smoke put his mind at ease. He should definitely spend more time here, away from all the worries and nagging.\n\nThere, the hooded figure waited for him, alongside a paladin in shining armour. To the business at claw, then. "My gratitude for agreeing to meet at such short notice, Prelate. I think we can both agree that the current situation cannot continue, lest we have a repeat of 978. Furthermore, I am keenly aware there are difficulties preventing our cooperation... but that can be circumvented. Can I count on your support in the upcoming difficult days?" If they were surprised by how quickly Iovinus got to his demands, they weren't showing it. After a short while, he would get the prelate's response.\n\n"We welcome your change of heart, mein Herzog, though it certainly seemed that you had no need for our assistance thus far. Regardless, the Prelature is committed to the success of the true heirs to the Verenian legacy, and to that end I will prepare a donation to your cause. Do not allow the wicked and envious to squander this generosity." Could it truly be this easy? "However, if you expect further support, we expect in return a proper show of dedication." The previously silent knight-commander, gleaming in her panoply, nodded in agreement with her superior.\n\nIt was never straightforward."
eyrie.9.a:0 "Would that Eyr smited our foes instead."

eyrie.10.t:0 "Inspecting The Verenian Guard"
eyrie.10.d:0 "All things considered, the losses in the scuffle were not all that debilitating. The wounded were tended to, fortifications restaffed, and usable equipment from the fallen was scavenged. The most pressing concern, however, was giving the soldiery a much needed morale boost. To that end, Iovinus organised several inspections with the Guard-Captain (which he did not relish, given recent events), but the appearance of unity was paramount.\n\nThus they walked together past lines and lines of soldiers, standing at attention with their rifles raised. Iovinus had to admire their discipline, their resolve, and of course their stylish dress uniforms. Too bad they did little good at the frontline... "At ease, griffons!" The practised tone of a disciplinarian had the order produce a satisfying effect. With that, Roman turned to face him for a word in private.\n\n"Edler Herr, the Verenian Guard is a trained and professional force. It does not need foreigners or paladins to achieve our goals." If only its commanders were equally restrained in their judgement. Nonetheless, he accepted the fact that the regular forces were more than capable, given how they bravely stood their ground recently."
eyrie.10.a:0 "We'll need more than just discipline, though."

eyrie.11.t:0 "Simpleminded Superstition"
eyrie.11.d:0 "An average peasant possesses enough smarts to live about their daily business, but when it comes to nuance, they're sadly lacking in this regard. In recent times, many reports have been received about the rabble claiming ominous portents, that "the end is nigh", and even cases of mass hysteria, which has negatively resulted on productivity. As it is plain to see, the world is still here, and Maar's fires have not enveloped the sky.\n\nWho is behind spreading this panic remains unclear, but some whispers talk about the local priesthood agitating the crowd during sermons. However, there are plenty of other leads available, meaning it will take some time before this farce can be dispersed."
eyrie.11.a:0 "There is no such thing! Discipline the rabble!"

eyrie.12.t:0 "Regarding Asphalt And Steel"
eyrie.12.d:0 ""My Duke, you know it, I know it, everygriff knows it. Infrastructure maintenance is one of the lowest priorities in these holds, and the roads are full of holes. On rainy days they turn to mud." Freya decided not to mince words. "I understand that our claws are full of expenses, but is there absolutely nothing that can be spared to alleviate the issue by at least some margin?"\n\nIn truth Iovinus wouldn't know anything about the condition of roads given that he hadn't left Calembourg for at least over a year, but this did sound quite alarming. But before he could issue his agreement, the Guard-Captain offered a rebuttal.\n\n"Let us not be so hasty, noble lord!" And you could have some better manners, Roman. "What our treasurer says is correct. However, your larger concern should be our railways and trains. Warfare as it is these days depends heavily on quick transportation of forces, and even in our static situation it cannot be disregarded. I feel regret that our populace has to rely on such poor roads—" Did he truly feel that way? "—but you have my personal promise that I'll fund their improvement after our final victory." With that, he raised a claw to his chest, making a pledging gesture.\n\nTime was short, idols were short, and decisions had to be made quickly. Iovinus ruminated on his options."
eyrie.12.a:0 "Fix those derelict roads already."
eyrie.12.b:0 "The supply of our forces comes first."

eyrie.13.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Requests Embargo"
eyrie.13.d:0 "Today comes an interesting request for our leadership: [From.GetNameDef], which are locked in a succession crisis with their sworn rivals, [ERI.GetNameDef], proposes that we cease all trading agreements with the latter. What's more interesting is that they are offering a sizeable amount of idols for this agreement, which is certainly more appreciable than empty promises. What shall be our response to the [From.GetAdjective] emissary?"
eyrie.13.a:0 "The sum covers our projected losses."
eyrie.13.b:0 "We will not involve ourselves in their Struggle."

eyrie.14.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Embargoes House Erie"
eyrie.14.d:0 "Silver words and calming gestures have paid their dividends: [From.GetNameDef] has agreed to cease trading resources and consumer goods with [ERI.GetNameDef]. Should a few more agree with our terms, Vincent shall have quite a conundrum on his claws to solve."
eyrie.14.a:0 "Victory is measured in many steps."

eyrie.15.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses To Embargo"
eyrie.15.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, [From.GetNameDef] has declined to participate in the embargo. They find their trade agreements worth more than our generous sum, leaving us with nothing for our time. Our effort to cause an economic crisis in [ERI.GetNameDef] has taken a turn for the worse, and might not be possible if further refuse."
eyrie.15.a:0 "It's never easy, is it?"

eyrie.16.t:0 "Sudden Economic Downturn"
eyrie.16.d:0 ""What do you mean, nogriff wants to trade with us? What is this nonsense?" Vincent was most perturbed by this sudden interruption of his quality free time, glaring at the stammering official as he rattled off words from a report.\n\n"W-what I mean is, y-your lordship, is that our foreign neighbours have cut us off entirely from their markets, suspending all shipments of resources, consumer goods, grain and..."\n\n"But we need those! How could this happen, I thought everything was under control?! How will we maintain our war measures if we can't even feed our peasants?" While the Duke didn't know much about international commerce or production line capacities, it was painfully clear an embargo was very bad news, especially for his impoverished lands.\n\n"W-we don't know! Nothing has changed in our agreements, this must be Iovinus' scheme..."\n\nVincent's eyes narrowed as he immediately charted a very rational and reasonable conclusion how that scoundrel could have plotted this. Of course it's all Iovinus' fault! "Get back to work, servant, and figure out some way to fix this." Just like that, the griff scampered, leaving him to brood and ponder an even more cruel vengeance once he got east of the Aranti..."
eyrie.16.a:0 ""IOOVINUUUUS! You utter vile scum!""

eyrie.17.t:0 "The Price Of Disobedience"
eyrie.17.d:0 "Silence reigned as Iovinus passively observed his commanders. Some of them had the shame to be looking at the floor, yet some stood proud and defiant in their expressions. That would have to be curbed soon enough. To the side, Freya was making notes while frightful Verena was glaring her own daggers for reasons best known to her. Undoubtedly somegriff will be complaining about her presence. With a claw pressed to his forehead, he began:\n\n"Guard-Captain Eitelkeit... I hope there is some very good reason for why I had to intervene and stop this conflict before a riot broke outside these walls. What sort of excuse do you have for yourself and your underlings?" He couldn't quite match the tone his wife made when she lectured their children, but it would have to suffice for the time being.\n\nOne could hear nary but the whistling of the wind, before eventually a response came. "Noble Duke, your strategy was flawed. Sitting and waiting wouldn't have done us any good, and we were running out of ammunition for our artillery, thus doing nothing would have only resulted in—"\n\nBut Iovinus would have none of it. "Do you consider me ignorant, Guard-Captain? This is precisely why my orders were to stand down and let them break ourselves at the river crossings. We didn't mobilise enough griffs or equipment for attacks, and we have nothing to show for these three months besides a casualty list that's almost as bad as theirs." He expected much more pushback, yet this time all were left stunned and speechless. The less guilty ones looked in his direction, apprehension in their features. "Let it be a lesson for you all: I have nothing but the best interests of my House in mind, and I will not tolerate further acts of disloyalty. From now on, I'll be taking a personal claw in the matter so that we may finally achieve victory after almost 30 years of this fighting.""
eyrie.17.a:0 ""Now begone, and remember your place.""

eyrie.18.t:0 "Beloved One's Letter"
eyrie.18.d:0 "Despondent and morose, Iovinus spent most of his recent days sequestered in his chambers, much like a punished chick. He left strict orders not to be disturbed, and the bliss of solitude helped to calm him after the most recent fiasco. Nogriff wanted this Struggle, yet they were all chained by it, seemingly forever, the burden of responsibility crushing even the most resolute griff.\n\nBut he didn't despair yet. What kept Iovinus' thoughts steady were his dearest wife's words, written on fine vellum. He went over them so many times, he could recite it by heart, recall with perfection the subtle quirks in her griffonage. The contents were most mundane, but it pleased him to no end knowing she and their chicks were safe and sound. Lothra and Lorien... his daughters were his greatest treasure, far more than anything in this accursed Verenia.\n\nThey were so far away, though. It broke Iovinus to do so, but he sent them away to their vacation home, at the outskirts of Skyfall. If anything happened to him... at least they would be safe, and he alone could suffer the consequences of failure."
eyrie.18.a:0 "Corinna... you'll come back soon, I promise."

eyrie.19.t:0 "The Court Of The Sunlight Shield"
eyrie.19.d:0 "Iovinus did not relish holding court. It was one of his obligations, yes, but it was difficult to make a decision which left both parties satisfied, and he always had to be mindful of how his courtiers would respond. At least such a hesitation did not occur when justice was being dispensed: lawbreakers were guilty not just in the eyes of their betters, but the Gods as well.\n\nThus he took a seat at the throne of his father, the chamber filled and awaiting his word. Roman stood by his side, the immaculate uniform firmly pressed as always, acting as his advisor in all matters of state and justice. It was Iovinus' choice to have him make decisions in his stead, and he tended to leave what he perceived as less popular outcomes to the Graf.\n\n"All rise! The Duke of Eyrie and the liege lord of all Verenia has declared this session of the court to be open. Petitioners will approach one by one and present their requests." Roman's booming baritone stiffened anygriff who seemed to be dozing off, before he turned to Iovinus and continued in a more sotto voce. "The griffs were pre-approved in advance to avoid a repeat of last time, but there is still a sizeable number waiting. If you feel this to be beneath your dignity, I shall carry on with the proceedings in your name."\n\nIovinus peered ahead and confirmed that yes, there were plenty of both commoners and upper crusts waiting. As much as he wished to slip away from this droll doldrum, it was not a good idea to depend on Roman too much. Publicly overriding his decisions could result in further disobedience, yet nogriff would question their Herzog in this very room."
eyrie.19.a:0 ""May the first griffon proceed at their leisure.""
eyrie.19.b:0 "Let Roman take care of everything. Pretend to be listening."

eyrie.20.t:0 "Farmer's Case"
eyrie.20.d:0 ""The Court will be hearing a case against Konrad, a petty farmer." Thus called the court herald's voice as a scrawny griff was brought before the Duke. Iovinus already pitied the ragged appearance, but the appearance of impassivity was paramount. Roman continued where the herald left off. "He stands guilty of having stolen from the ducal granaries, and attempted to flee and resist arrest. The punishment for stealing from the crown is death, but Konrad has used his right to plead for mercy and lenience." Those last few words came out like an insult from Roman's beak.\n\n"This appears to be an issue without a mystery. Konrad, what do you have to say in defence of your actions?" What will it be this time.\n\n"M-mercy, your lordship! My family was starving as our harvest failed this year. We have nothing to eat, please spare me!" The broken griff dropped to the floor as he cried and begged in-between unintelligible words. Iovinus looked around as all the high and mighty looked with faces of disgust, but proper bearing prevented them from voicing their displeasures.\n\n"Spare yourself some dignity, Konrad, for I have made my decision." One last hopeful look from the miserable being."
eyrie.20.a:0 ""Hang this griffon, as a deterrent for all thieves.""
eyrie.20.b:0 ""Have him flogged and given a month's ration of food.""
eyrie.20.c:0 ""Conscript him and his village into the militia.""

eyrie.21.t:0 "Merchant's Grumbling"
eyrie.21.d:0 ""The Court will be hearing a petition from Arvin Geldklaue, a Calembourgian merchant." Iovinus' eyes narrowed. What do the vultures want this time? Another city to burn, perhaps? With a bow, the finely dressed griff introduced himself.\n\n"On behalf of the Merchant's Guild, I thank you for allowing me this opportunity to present our plea. My Duke, as you are well aware, the stringent tariffs placed on all mercantile activity has severely hampered any growth and thus led to the current sorry state. We understand that you require the funds for the war effort, but if these taxes were lowered, it would be a benefit to Verenia as a whole." As the idol pincher began to inundate the conversation with statistics and economic theory, he was cut off by Roman.\n\n"I would advise against this petition, my Duke. The tariffs are meant to protect our feeble industry from foreigners and their unequal deals, even at the expense of our domestic growth. This could be discussed again after we crush the secessionists, but now is not the time."\n\n"Or perhaps our obliging nobility could pay a larger share to the treasury." The merchant quipped in a very helpful and sarcastic manner, earning a glare from most of the room's occupants. Iovinus had to admit he considered the idea from time to time, but he knew it would be resisted at every pawstep.\n\n"That'll be enough, Arvin. Here is what the Court has decided." So many eyes staring at him."
eyrie.21.a:0 ""Your request has been granted, for the time being.""
eyrie.21.b:0 ""At this time we cannot accept this.""
eyrie.21.c:0 ""Halve the tariff at the expense of a new tax for the nobles.""

eyrie.22.t:0 "Nobles' Dispute"
eyrie.22.d:0 ""The Court will be hearing a dispute between House Weingut and House von Geisslerg, loyal vassals of House Eyrie." Important names, thus all the more important decision. Two griffs, in all their finery, took place before the Duke, glaring daggers at each other all the while. Iovinus accepted their well-meaning words and motioned for the left griff to begin.\n\n"My lord and duke of Eyrie, I urge you to resolve this issue once and for all. My family, the House of Weingut, have served yours for many years, and we only wish to continue doing so." Quite the effort for flattery, yes. "House von Geisslerg has promised ours a parcel of land as part of a dowry, but they have reneged on their agreement. We only ask you to uphold a fair and honest agreement."\n\nCould it really be so simple? "What does House von Geisslerg say to this?"\n\nThe right griffon, who was having the most incredulous look for a while, spoke. "The words are true, but what my equal forgot to mention is that their bride turned out to be a liar and a cheater with no respect for marital vows. We do not consider ourselves bound to an agreement where one side is blatantly disho—"\n\n"How dare you speak of my sister like this! I'll have your feathers plucked!" But before the adoring rivals could swing claws at each other, Roman's harsh tone turned them into meek chicks. What to do? The Geisslergs were one of the less problematic vassals, yes, but they were poorer compared to the Weinguts. However, the latter were obvious lackeys of the Eitelkeits, and Roman didn't need more influence in this court."
eyrie.22.a:0 ""House Weingut shall have their land, as agreed.""
eyrie.22.b:0 ""House von Geisslerg will retain their land, and be given an indemnity.""
eyrie.22.c:0 ""House Eyrie will temporarily take control of this land.""

eyrie.23.t:0 "Soldier's Duty"
eyrie.23.d:0 ""The Court will be hearing a case against Wilfried, a soldier of the Guard accused of desertion." Peculiar. Why was this brought before him, instead of having the Guard-Captain resolve it himself? The bound griffon did not seem particularly frightened. Roman took over from the herald. "Noble lord, Wilfried was found in uniform, roughly four days of walking distance away from his post. He did not offer resistance when confronted, and confessed to abandoning his station. The penalty for desertion are the gallows." It's a harsh society we live in, thought Iovinus as he allowed the guardsgriff to explain himself.\n\n"Your majesty—" Wrong form of address, but irrelevant. "—I was not deserting. After the last war, I heard that my family's home was torched by Erian marauders. I simply had to reassure myself that it was not the case, and thank Boreas it wasn't. I asked several times for a leave and it was denied each time, there was no intention to desert." At least, Vincent didn't ruin this griff's life, but that hardly alleviated the gruff captain.\n\n"You dishonour everygriffon who serves the Sunlight Shield, Wilfried. Do you think you're alone in having family?" But before the accused could retort, another quipped in.\n\n"Do we not know the meaning of mercy? It cannot be forgotten even during times of war." Verena in her distinctive garb raised voice from beyond Iovinus' sight. "Our soldiers must be given the opportunity to tend to their loved ones."\n\n"This does not concern you, Prelate—", harsh was Roman's tone, "—and you have no right to meddle in temporal affairs. I would suggest that you keep to your proselytising elsewhere." Iovinus was quick to defuse the argument, as this was a place of dignity, and declared his judgement."
eyrie.23.a:0 ""You are sentenced to the gallows.""
eyrie.23.b:0 ""Forgiveness, and give all soldiers a day off.""
eyrie.23.c:0 ""His weekly wage is forfeit to the House.""

eyrie.24.t:0 "Daggers Gleaming"
eyrie.24.d:0 "Something was amiss. The vassals always had the right of convening the Ducal Court, but it was something they weren't fond of doing, lest they received another browbeating from Iovinus. But today was different and thus he was waiting in the grand palace's throne room as it slowly filled up. In the crowd he saw many important griffs, the heads of houses Bördsdorff, Freud, zu Falkendorff, Weingut... and of course, house Eitelkeit.\n\nThe mystery didn't take long to unravel as the Guard-Captain took the stand. "Edler Herr, we the Adel are severely concerned with your recent actions. Thus we are giving you one chance to correct this mistake: follow our advice or there'll be blood." The rest stood together, their expressions stern and not at all interested in a compromise.\n\nWords failed to leave Iovinus' beak. It didn't seem there was a way out of this, and if there was any support for him, it was not present in the room. He wished, he sorely wished, in a grand display of anger and spite, to put their threat to a test... but he hated Vincent more than he was angry at these traitors right now. To say nothing of the impact this will have in the future, if they actually prevailed in the Struggle. Sad as it was, there was no choice but to agree."
eyrie.24.a:0 ""Fine.""

eyrie.25.t:0 "Court Adjourned"
eyrie.25.d:0 "Just when the Duke was starting to get restless from sitting so much on his backside, there finally came relief. "This session of the Ducal Court has come to an end." Thus loudly proclaimed the herald, and relieved expressions could be seen far and wide. Except on those who didn't reach the front of the line, and ended up being roughly escorted from the premises. They'll have to try again in a few months.\n\nAll in all, Iovinus felt mostly satisfied with the outcomes. He did what he considered to be most just, and there was no commotion like the dreaded last time. The memory still lingered painfully in the mind... But enough of that, there was a most splendid roast waiting in the dining hall, his favourite! Just what he needed after a long day of work, and there were plenty more of those to come."
eyrie.25.a:0 "The law of the land, mettled."

eyrie.26.t:0 "Our Valuable Possessions"
eyrie.26.d:0 "The Duke of Eyrie was many things, but one of the things he took pride in was his love of the aesthetics. Paintings, sculptures, coinage, ancient instruments, and even jewellery: whatever pleased the eye was precious to Iovinus. Of course, he was aware of not letting his weakness control him and thus only spent on such when he could reasonably afford them. Most of the time...\n\nThus it made it all harder that he was now deciding what to pack away to be sold. Iovinus hoped it would set an example for the others, but the sad truth was that the conflict needed to be funded one way or the other. This particular one was simply the least demanding for the others, but that didn't make it any easier for him as he placed a shroud over a particularly dusty painting, mentally beating himself for letting it lay forgotten in a basement.\n\nOne particular item caught his attention. It was a simple silver goblet, decorated with a tree motif over its surface, with a precious gemstone embedded in the middle. Hardly the most valuable piece of a dragon's hoard, but what made it so sentimental is that it was Corinna's gift for their ten years of marriage together. Oh the happier times...\n\nIt had to go, but maybe he could get it back later on. Iovinus was friends with a reputable dealer in arts, so perhaps she would keep it stashed till he could buy it again. But first, he had to decide on what exactly would he spend all these future idols into."
eyrie.26.a:0 "Invest in domestic capabilities."
eyrie.26.b:0 "Invest in our foreign assets."
eyrie.26.c:0 "There's a mercenary contract available..."

eyrie.27.t:0 "Spectacle At The Grand Palace"
eyrie.27.d:0 "Perhaps it was one of his many obligations, but Iovinus hated hosting parties for the nobility. It felt very much like a waste of his evening, he did not enjoy dancing in the slightest, the idols could be better spent elsewhere, and worst of all, there would be barely anything to eat! If it were up to the Duke, there would be a simple feast, yet expectations demanded otherwise.\n\nThus the dust and cobwebs of the great hall were cleared, invitations were sent, and everything was ready for a night of empty words and no small amount of debauchery. If there was one good thing about Vincent, it was the fact that his tantrum allowed Iovinus to indefinitely cancel these frivolities.\n\nStill, there was a sense of comfort, having a night where he didn't have to do anything but smile and offer compliments. As expected, all the nobles in their finery were attending, even the famously reclusive ones. Besides ensuring that his glass was always full, Iovinus had little of note to say about the evening. It went pretty much as he imagined, with the mingling and dancing, and thankfully the drinking gave him an excuse to retire early.\n\nIf only Corinna were here. She'd make it much more enjoyable."
eyrie.27.a:0 "It's good living, at least."

eyrie.28.t:0 "Vengeance Long In Making"
eyrie.28.d:0 "For quite some time, Gretel wondered why she still went to the secret meetings with her fellow "comrades". In truth she had very little affection for the tenets of "communism", regarding it at best as a means to an end, but it was certainly better than brooding alone in her squalid home. Plus, there were always luxuries in form of strong drink and warm meals.\n\nToday, however, was different. Fervour and dissatisfaction were growing and nogriff could ignore it. Thus the meeting was packed full, griffs Gretel could only scarcely recall seeing before, and the topic concerned itself with the uprising they were planning. It would seem that the beloved Duke was not so adored anymore, but she still remembered how the last revolt turned out, and thought all this to be very optimistic.\n\n"Gretel, you've been here longer than almost any of us. Will you lead the rebellion?" This clear question broke her out of the bored stupor she's been maintaining thus far, and she had to stop herself from instinctively nodding. Why her? Was everygriff so easily duped? On the other claw, this was the perfect opportunity. Revenge! Everything that was denied to her all those years ago! Base instincts took over, and Gretel readily agreed to be the people's champion."
eyrie.28.a:0 "The revolution will be avenged!"
eyrie.28.b:0 "Stop this racket! Immediately!"

eyrie.29.t:0 "Minor Disturbance"
eyrie.29.d:0 "Iovinus was still nursing a hangover after that awful evening (in truth it wasn't that bad, he simply hated wasting time) when he received a report from a scribe clamouring for his attention.\n\n"Forgive me for disturbing you, Lord Iovinus, but there's been a riot in the city and..."\n\nThe Duke was quick to interrupt even though it pained him, and he was still feeling the after-effects. "What?! Send in the Watch, how could this happen, why was I not informed of this, who is behind this—"\n\n"Please calm yourself, mein Herzog!" Iovinus' reputation for stoicism made griffs fearful whenever he deigned to raise his voice. "You ordered not to be disturbed and we followed your demands. Somehow, the city dwellers found out about the party you were hosting and demanded to know why were the idols not invested in more productive matters." Ah, a like-minded griff. "One thing led to another, and well, they're not very happy with you, my lord."\n\nNow he was truly vindicated. Next occasion somegriff suggests this waste of money, they'll be thrown to the rabble! Yet after sufficiently calming down and thanking the good bureaucrat for his hard work, Iovinus wondered how exactly word of this got out in the masses. Special care was made to keep the event a secret, and still... Something to solve in a less troubled time."
eyrie.29.a:0 "What a bother."

eyrie.30.t:0 "Where Do The Supplies Come From?"
eyrie.30.d:0 ""War is a dreadfully expensive thing, my Duke. Even I can only do so much to alleviate the cost." Iovinus was receiving an update from his most capable advisor, as they strolled together down Calembourg's main street. It was good to get outside of the stuffy grand palace once in a while, and the armed guard ensured nogriff would try to accost them. However, there was still a sense of unease.\n\n"I do not blame you for this, Freya. You're doing all that you can." His eyes took notice of an abandoned manor home, its carcass picked clean of whatever valuables that once hid inside. At least, that's what all the broken windows suggested. A look askance confirmed that she saw the eyesore as well.\n\n"It's a shame our city is like this, but I hope we can one day together see it refurnished and beautiful. But before I get carried away, you were asking me about my... covert operations. I've only scratched the surface of this underground market and the firearms we're getting to supplement our production have been arriving on time. I can try digging deeper into it, but it would come at the expense of my regular responsibilities, and might not give fruit, either." She'd look down on the ground in contemplation.\n\nIovinus knew the troops were always lacking in weaponry, and having more of those would definitely boost his prospects. On the other claw, they could make do with what they already have, and instead instruct Freya to make some long term preparations for the benefit of Verenia."
eyrie.30.a:0 ""Focus on our future, Freya.""
eyrie.30.b:0 ""Freya, we need those guns.""

eyrie.31.t:0 "Officer Training Program"
eyrie.31.d:0 "While the Proud Ones of the Triarchy, or simply the paladin order, had a had a long and storied history dating to the founding days of Verenia, the Verenian Guard was very much its unwanted relative, never particularly notable or special. Certainly, the Struggle had given it the opportunity to prove themselves in valorous combat, which they've certainly done, but its modernisation and expansion cannot occur on any major scale till the conflict is resolved.\n\nThus Iovinus decided to make the first step, and invite a few friends he had from Herzland. They've attended various military academies, and with a little compensation they would certainly be more than happy to teach his hotheaded commanders a few lessons in strategy. Of course, he would recuse himself from the event, as Iovinus felt he wasn't deserving of such honour, nor did he have the time.\n\nWith so little time left before Vincent struck again, the program had to be done in an accelerated fashion. The question was, who should receive the majority of the instructors' attention?"
eyrie.31.a:0 "Have them focus on the Guard-Captain."
eyrie.31.b:0 "Give everygriff their fair due."

eyrie.32.t:0 "Supporting The Divine Cause"
eyrie.32.d:0 "Iovinus had a startling realisation that he barely ever saw the Prelate outside of the temple. It didn't particularly impact him in any shape or form, but he found it food for thought while waiting in this poorhouse. As much he tried to suppress it, Iovinus was not fond to be near these hapless wretches. He did eschew the trappings of nobility to hide better amongst the commoners, but the same couldn't be said for Verena, whose blazing crimson robe was an easy catch for the eyes.\n\nEventually the line progressed to the point he could speak with her, who was not at all fooled by his "disguise". "Of all the things I could imagine, this was not one of them. I don't suppose you're here for the free meal, are you?" In what could be construed as a mocking fashion, she raised a bowl of... something brown. It looked barely appetising, and no amount of bread could save it.\n\n"That won't be necessary, Prelate, we need to urgently discuss how you could help—" But her gaze rebuked him into silence.\n\n"If my help is what you desire, help me first. Come behind the counter and assist me." The nerve! He was not some servant! But this was no time to make a scene and Iovinus begrudgingly obliged as he stood next to Verena, doing everything she said, which was thankfully not too much. Between this charitable work, he passed out his ideas and desires, and a lull gave her the opportunity to respond. "I do far more than just preach from the lectern, it is true, but if you desire to expand my mission, it shall be so. Or, you could give some helping claws to Sigrid, she's always starved for aid." The Duke felt very much starved himself surrounded by this culinary mediocrity..."
eyrie.32.a:0 "Have Verena work more with the people."
eyrie.32.b:0 "Give Sigrid what she needs."

eyrie.33.t:0 "The Bank Will Have Its Due"
eyrie.33.d:0 ""So tell me more about this Jean de Monei, Freya. Who is he that he can fund our war effort, and convince the banks of Flowena to lift their embargo? If I didn't know better I'd believe you were trying to swindle me." Indeed, Iovinus had little trust for those vile bankers. Somehow they blamed him for all of Vincent's frauds and most likely he would end up having to pay for them.\n\n"Jean is an old friend of mine from the university days, my Duke. He's a consummate professional and he'll convince the others that investing in our struggles is a worthwhile endeavour. Of course, they won't do so out of eleos, and we'll have a debt to pay, but... we simply can't do this on our own." She spoke with confidence, and Iovinus knew that if this was the best Freya could do, it was most worthwhile.\n\n"I... very well, Freya. There isn't much time left for us, and we'll worry about our future obligations when we get to them. Make contact with your colleague and inform him that House Eyrie is willing to negotiate a deal." He wouldn't be surprised if these leeches ended up sucking all of his blood, but another realisation struck him. "Wait, hold on for a moment. Why didn't this Jean help us out before? You've never mentioned him."\n\nAs always, Freya had an answer ready. "He's but one griff in their pyramid, Iovinus. He wasn't able to overturn the opinion of the majority, but now that we've considerably invested in our economy, he'll have much better chances of convincing them that we are the better option for business." It seemed all too convenient, but the Duke's trust in his treasurer was never misplaced."
eyrie.33.a:0 "It is our best option."

eyrie.34.t:0 "Verenian Defence Plan"
eyrie.34.d:0 ""Cut to the summary, Guard-Captain. I appreciate the level of detail you've put into this, but time is short and we need to be prepared. There will not be a repeat of last year." Once more Iovinus sat across Roman and his subordinate officers, all peering together at a map overlaid with lines, arrows, figures representing force estimations and others. Supposedly, this sort of thing constituted a hobby for those with too much spare time, but that thought would be chased later.\n\n"As you wish, mein Herzog. Obviously, the lay of the land has not drastically changed so our defence concentrations remain the same. We are confident that we can outlast them, yet I have prepared a fallback plan." Uncharacteristic of the inflexible strategist. "An appearance of weakness can bait them in a most cunning trap. With their overextended forces cut off, we can launch a devastating counterattack, and finally put an end to this Struggle." All this was accompanied with gestures and adjustments on the map.\n\n"And what of contingencies? Who knows what that scoundrel could be planning." Iovinus knew that a cornered animal was most dangerous.\n\n"Intelligence is unfortunately scarce, so this is the best we can do given our resources. I have faith that the well-drilled Watch will perform admirably." Roman was perhaps a bit too arrogant in his assumptions, but it was not like Iovinus could summon lightning bolts to smite everything west of the Aranti. It would have to do, and the choice awaited."
eyrie.34.a:0 "A solid line nothing can overcome."
eyrie.34.b:0 "Give ground when necessary, then strike back."

eyrie.35.t:0 "Help From Above"
eyrie.35.d:0 ""You talk of divine providence, but unless Eyr personally smites all lands west of the Aranti, I don't see how you intend to win this war, Prelate. We can't pray our problems away." If only! Iovinus spent many hours at the temple just doing such and it left him with a peaceful, if spiritually unfulfilling feeling. He would not be speaking to Verena with such candour normally, but her ambiguous statements were beginning to grate a nerve. The Struggle was about to continue.\n\nThankfully she did not give him a verbal lashing. "Have faith, mein Herzog. With all the support you have provided to the Prelature, keeping the rest of your kind away as well, I was able to make contact with my colleagues in Romau. Your enemies will experience holy wrath for themselves, as they righteously deserve." One could say there was a fire in her gaze, matching her words.\n\nThis revelation left Iovinus thinking for a moment. Yes, the knights of Romau would certainly be excellent warriors... but there were quite a few downsides unspoken. For starters, he could forget about any sort of actual help from his unruly vassals, and it was well known that the Archon of Eyr is a demanding griff. Certainly, the Duke had never met him in person, but reputations have a way of spreading whether one wished so or not. Yet it was too late to back off now, for there were too many bridges burned. He gave Verena the blessing to do what was needed."
eyrie.35.a:0 "What other choice do we have?"

eyrie.36.t:0 "Recollecting The Revolution"
eyrie.36.d:0 ""The memory of 978 remains sharp in my mind. I was but a humble third son, destined to be entirely unremarkable, probably given some minor commission to live my days in idyllic boredom. None of us could have seen what would happen in Calembourg. Most of the ducal guard was sent away on the western border, in anticipation of some incursion from Aquileia. The danger came from within, however.\n\nIt was no secret that the merchants have always chafed under the nobility here in Verenia, I freely admit that myself as a noble, but our reasons were good and fair. Regardless, with most of the city's garrison depleted, they staged a republican revolt, undoubtedly assisted by foreign elements, and killed so many of my family. Third son became first, and I was fortunate to escape the calamity with the remainder of the loyal troops. There was no time to grieve, and a perimeter was established around the city, as we waited for additional forces to arrive from Erie.\n\nThe insipid imbecile called Vincent was just as insufferable back then as he is now. Blaming his delays on partisan attacks (his younger sibling, Cyrille, told me that Vincent was more concerned about stopping at every noble's estate), he would try to wrest control of the siege and the war council for himself, for reasons I could not comprehend. It seemed like our bickering would break our efforts to restore control over Verenia, until somegriff suggested to simply bomb the insurgents into submission. I disliked greatly the idea of destroying beautiful Calembourg, but it was the only course of action everygriff agreed on.\n\nSeven days and seven nights, we battered the revolutionaries into dust, with justice brought to the merchant leaders after a bloody assault. Yet our hardships have only begun after we thought ourselves safe."\n\n—From the memoirs of Iovinus Eyrie, Herzog von Eyrie"

Was Gretel at fault for her predicament? Perhaps, perhaps, but that was something she chose to ignore.\n\nWhat she couldn't ignore was the mobilisation notice in her claws. Maar would have to take her first before she served even one day in that farce called the "Verenian Guard". Everygriff knew how it would go: a bunch of birds would die for nothing, then the insensitive lordlings would declare yet another ceasefire, and the cycle of torment would continue. Gretel clung firmer to her winter coat, the one luxury she didn't forsake in some fashion from her wealthier days, as she stepped inside the conscription office.\n\nThe bored looking recruiter would be easily convinced. "I believe there is a mistake here with my order. See, I am exempt from service due to my poor health." She received a sceptical look, but before a response formed Gretel dropped a hefty pouch on the desk. "This should prove my condition sufficiently." Oh she hated throwing away her dwindling fortune, but there was a life to live in pursuit of something worthwhile. Thankfully, this griff proved to be of dubious morals.\n\nWith her task successful, Gretel would return to her previous intention, that being a secret meeting with the others who've been hiding much like her.

Thus it was passed on through his descendants and became one of the banners used by the Verenian dukes.\n\nA fanciful tale of great inspiration, certainly, but the boring truth is that the earliest historical reference to the Sun-and-Moon symbol in question dates to late 500s, and even then it only featured the sun. Available records show that the moon was added only after the cadet branch of House Erie became established, and its addition was not without controversy. Nonetheless, this same banner of today was present in all notable events, particularly when duchess Adelina voluntarily submitted to the rising Groverian dynasty.\n\nBut why the sun and the moon to begin with?

Instead, precious metals like gold, silver, bronze and others were preferred, giving them not only an aesthetic appeal but confirmed their role as a commodity. Those would in time be minted into coinage, and with money thus came the need to track debt record, and soon after followed the first banks, which are described in the following chapters.\n\nVarious currencies were known, such as the Aquileian aigle, the Wingbardian scudo and the Herzland idol. The eastern riverponies had a similar diversity, but theirs are not worth mentioning. One of Grover III's notable achievements is implementing the aforementioned idol as the standardised currency across the continent, which has persisted to this day despite the Revolution of 978. Small holdouts have persisted, though, with the most notable one being the Flowenan flowin, which sometimes presents a headache for clients and visitors.\n\n—From Idols and Gunpowder: the Ingenuity of Griffons"

Even if you personally could not influence history in a grand scale, it is your little acts that show your integrity."\n\n"Do not be so keen on trading your honour like it is a half-bent grover at the market. This, this weakness of will is what gives the Gods contempt for our kind, and not even a lifetime of prayer and supplication may turn Their gaze back to us in favour.

Fortunately, most griffs have recovered, and the equipment is safe from waterlogging.\n\nCuriously, it has only struck the western bank, and Eyrian positions are completely untouched.

If the Gods were really on his side, then They could be a little more helpful too, but that did foil Vincent's attack quite nicely.\n\n"Is there a rational explanation for everything? I could not answer that myself. What I know for certain, and what I always knew, is that no plea remains unanswered. Do not worry yourself with it."

Verenia can only be united with either their or our defeat, so we'll expedite this process.

Yet these reports received from the Guard-Captain said completely otherwise. Erian assault had completely failed, their resistance had collapsed quickly, the arrogant paladins were laid low, and Vincent himself was en route to Calembourg in a cage. Everything was exactly as he wanted, yet the Duke felt not a single bit of satisfaction.\n\nPerhaps it was the paranoia talking. Words like these didn't stay contained for long, and already there were impromptu celebrations across his holdings. Could it truly be so? Could the Struggle finally be over, and could he finally tell his beloved wife and daughters that they are allowed to return? Hopefully this wasn't some kind of... mass hallucination or something.

In recent times, however, manumission was becoming a common practice. Not because of any supposed benevolence from the nobles, mind you, but because they had too many and griffs just had to be let go.\n\nThus the Duke was discussing the issue with most of his inner council (the Prelate on principle refused to share a room with the Guard-Captain whenever possible), and Freya was eagerly explaining how there were plenty of factories that needed more helping claws. Certainly better than having them loitering around, but Iovinus wondered if those griffs would just be trading one personal Tartarus for another. It didn't take a rector of Yale to know that industrialisation didn't quite provide comfortable labour.\n\nThe Guard-Captain had some other ideas. "Herzog, economical development is certainly a fine thing, but the Verenian Guard continues facing shortages in numbers. While we have enough to fill our frontline regiments, auxiliary roles such as logistics, engineering and medical assistance are suffering. Please keep in mind that their role is just as important." Reasonable, very reasonable. Iovinus would be much more happier if he didn't end up often picking between two reasonable choices, but such was life."

Such was this occasion, as he witnessed the Prelate do her work.\n\nThe Duke had a vague recollection that these ceremonies weren't always so sombre and quiet. He could swear that the previous prelate made quite a spectacle of the proceedings, but Verena was a different kind. She had the face of a disappointed lecturer and woe befell anygriff who dared cause a commotion at her events. Still, watching as the votive offerings to Eyr were sacrificed gave a certain... peace to Iovinus. It was as if they did something right, and good fortune would follow them soon.\n\nOf course, only a small portion of the harvest was sacrificed, but he knew there was a plentiful bounty this year. Iovinus may have not owned or controlled every single grain of rye, barley or wheat, but he knew griffs who did, and he could do something with the surplus. If he were to listen to the Prelate, the Duke would be personally putting food in the claws of the poor (something he could at least delegate to some other griff), but he recalled Freya mentioning how they were always lacking in funds.

The Duke of Verenia could simply reintegrate them back into his fold, perhaps post some soldiers around to make sure they don't scheme again, and turn his attention elsewhere.

But how can you be so sure Cyrille will not plot vengeance of his own, especially after we murder his liege lord?"\n\nVerena's expression was enigmatic as always. "Sigrid will make sure of his loyalty.""

eyrie.65.d:0 "The telegram was sent well in advance: a train would be arriving in Calembourg within the hour. An entirely unremarkable occurrence, were it not for the fact that the Duke's beloved family was returning on it. The griff in question was impatiently waiting at the station, frequently flicking his tail and spreading his wings. Further away, the retinue made a protective perimeter but they were entirely forgettable and unimportant.\n\nHow long had it been since Iovinus last saw them? The answer eluded his thoughts, was it two, three or five years... The letters made it easy to forget, yet time was not kind to his memory or wellbeing. The Duke tried to steady his nerves. Everything was alright now, nothing could go wrong, this is what he had waited for so long.\n\nA shrill sound in the distance signalled the train's arrival. Were his feathers properly brushed? Did his clothes look tidy?!\n\nHis worries quickly dashed what little time remained, and Iovinus awaited with bated breath as a small crowd exited to mill past him, entirely unaware who the Duke was, as he suddenly felt two small bodies shove themselves against his chest. "Papa! Papa! We're home! We missed you so, so much!" Lothra! Lorien! Iovinus embraced his adorable chicks firmly, with a familiar voice calling out.\n\n"Iovinus! Darling! Why did you keep us away for so long? Do you have any idea how worried I was?! Vederstad is a complete hovel, and Skyfall was too crowded to visit on a regular basis, I had to..." But the Duke didn't pay much attention as he was too enraptured with Corinna's visage."

eyrie.77.d:0 "For once, Iovinus looked forward to the next session of the Ducal Court. The pressing matter concerned itself with the planned abolition of manorialism, vassalage and all those other trappings of ancient times. Of course, the abolition of nobility was not something that was ever on the daily plan, for reasons much obvious. It would have been very satisfying to be rid of this burden.\n\n"...myself and my colleagues can all agree, Edler Herr, that we do not need serfdom anymore. The winds of change are blowing fiercely, and while we still have loyal household soldiers upholding the order, what good are half starved peasants, whose minds are more occupied with home and family than duty?" The old warhawk, Burgreif Landsgraf, argued with fierce passion, and much to Iovinus' surprise, a large part of the room was in agreement with her. Even Roman offered a terse nod, undoubtedly desiring a more motivated sort of griff for his precious Watch.\n\nIf he could, the Duke would have immediately concluded the hearing and went with the plan. To maintain some sort of stability, he promised long ago to the lower classes the abolishment of feudal relations if he were victorious in the Struggle, and scared them with mostly truthful stories of the exploitation Vincent would inflict. But nothing was ever so simple, his word alone couldn't change everything overnight, and he still remembered a small but very wealthy few of the nobles, who guaranteed a handsome reward if he were to simply... renegotiate the terms, as is. Would he be principled, or give in to his vices?"

I had no time for listening to gossip." Ingrid retorted, with little joy in her labour.\n\n"Ah, see, I heard about this from the gamekeeper, who heard it from one of the Vizegrafin's valets. Duke Iovinus and his entourage were having a dinner, the usual stuff us servants never get to see or have, when suddenly, he jumped on the table—"\n\n"Was this griff drunk? The Duke is a picture of impassivity, it's almost frightening how nothing bothers him."\n\n"No, no, he swore it happened. That the Duke, he climbed on the table, with madness in his eyes as he furiously waved his claws and spread his wings. The poncy nobles were all in shock, listening to their master ramble about 'being the one' and 'ending the cycle of despair'. I couldn't believe it myself until I had it checked with the others."\n\nIngrid was shocked, to say the least. She had no love for her station in life, but the Duke, he was a respectable employer and never did anything wrong, as far as she knew. "And then what?"\n\nGreta waved her claws in a shrugging motion. "His attendant dragged him away before he could start throwing the main course. Kicked and screamed to resist, too.""

eyrie.666.d:0 "The air was cold and still within Iovinus' quarters. Another day spent making difficult decisions, another day spent wrangling with his subordinates, every day a little harder to bear. He had been hanging at the end of his rope, under the weight of anxiety he hid deep beneath a shroud of confidence and bravery. Spending much of the night unable to sleep, thinking about his family, his legacy, his beautiful Verenia. Sitting at his desk, writing a letter intended for his wife, he would finally succumb to his exhaustion.\n\nA quiet creak could be heard, followed by silence.\n\nThe soft noise would be enough to wake him up, but what he saw then exposed just how insignificant he was. A figure stood before him, black as the sky outside and as silent as the room around them. The shrouded griff looked off, almost blurry and unfocused, like it was trying to be multiple things at once. Its presence made the Duke feel warm and peaceful, yet nervous, frightened. It would reach with a long, desiccated arm, opening its claw to Iovinus. He looked at it with confusion, briefly glancing at the figure's face. There was nothing, just a slow nod and a whisper.\n\n"It could be your time."\n\nWhat time? He already spent most of his lifetime wasting under his burdens. If only it would all end already so he didn't have to worry anymore. His mind was telling him to reject anything the figure offered, but... He was so tired of everything."

eyrie.999.t:0 "Forces Beyond Comprehension"
eyrie.999.d:0 ""Your lordship, there is a letter for you." Now this was a surprise for Iovinus. He wasn't at all used to having Freya deliver him mail, when he had couriers for such a thing... nor was the concerned face of the Guard-Captain, clutching his cap in his claws, or the sterner than usual (was that even possible?) Verena's expression. The Duke looked up quizzically at his advisors, before reaching for the letter opener. Just a peek of the griffonage was enough to spoil Iovinus' mood.\n\n"Dear vile scum of a sibling,\n\nI've heard that you're a swindler and a cheat! By the rules of the game that entitles me to seize all your land and throw you out where you belong. Maybe next time you won't throw away everything on a single gamble, huh?\n\nWith hate and enmity,\nVincent"\n\nThis was... extremely confusing. What cheating? What was that imbecile thinking? He was right here, with his armies and vassals, ready to fight for Verenia! Standing up in fury from this insult, Iovinus turned to face the window, outside where his forces would be rallying... Except there were quite a few of those accursed paladins surrounding the grand palace."
eyrie.999.a:0 "Unfair! I've never done anything wrong!"

eyrie_freya.1.d_eyrie:0 "Iovinus still had second guesses about Freya's Flowenan scheme. Bankers were just a subtype of merchants, and everygriff around here knows that they cannot be trusted. His thoughts on the matter, as well as indulgence of warm tea, were interrupted as the aforementioned treasurer entered the lounge room. She was positively beaming, which was quite something considering she hardly ever appeared to be crestfallen or in distress.\n\n"Herzog! Jean has convinced the Flowenan Seigneurie to break their embargo! We will have everything that we need!" She would pull out a rather thick stack of papers from her satchel, which Iovinus figured out to be a contract, and continued: "It only requires your signature, and Flowena shall support us."\n\n"This comes as a rather welcome surprise, Freya, I didn't consider that... hold on." Iovinus wasn't much of a law expert (lawyers were about as despicable as merchants), but he was obligated to read everything he signed, and the terms and conditions for this agreement were quite... something. Like she said, he could ask for so many things from them: mercenaries, industrial development, subsidies, but each would carry a hefty repayment plan.\n\nOf course there was no such thing as free lunch, but Iovinus figured that there was no downside in the matter. Either he would reclaim Verenia, or he'd have no debt to worry about after Vincent forced him out. Freya graciously provided a pen to seal the deal."
eyrie_freya.1.d_flowena:0 "The influential griffons of Flowena, all wealthy bank owners, tried to ignore the neighbouring Verenian conflict that's been ongoing for seemingly forever. In the past some have tried to profiteer by selling weapons to both sides, which was moderately successful, until they stopped making their payments. Thus, the Seigneurie issued a blanket ban on all dealings with the frauds, and imprisoned any would-be thieves that tried to reclaim their assets.\n\nJean de Monei, one of our richest patricians, has proposed that we lift this embargo, in regards to House Eyrie. They represent the legitimate claimant in this succession war, and he has met their chief minister of economy. Jean has presented proof that despite their heavy spending on military matters, they have also tried their best to develop their lands. Furthermore, he argued that their victory would result in gratitude and friendly relations with [EYR.GetLeader], who'll most certainly guarantee Flowenan independence.\n\nThus the Seigneurie held a vote, with a qualified majority agreeing to issue a loan to the Eyrian claimant. Jean has accepted to act as the guarantor on their behalf, and the terms of this agreement were appropriately stacked in our favour."

#### FOCUS

EYR_fifth_onslaught:0 "The Fifth Onslaught"
EYR_fifth_onslaught_desc:0 "Our reliable sources have confirmed what we all dread: Vincent Erie, the self proclaimed Duke of Erie, is preparing a yet another attack against his rightful liege lord. The true ruler of Verenia must rally his soldiers, marshal his defences and prepare his people. House Eyrie does not bow before insurgents and mutineers."
EYR_sudden_death:0 "An Unexpected Passing"
EYR_sudden_death_desc:0 "After a sudden bout of illness, Captain Otto von Grieslein of the Verenian Guard has passed away. Though he was unable to break the stalemate, his tenacity and skills have ensured that the Aranti defence line remained strong. A new Guard-Captain will have to be chosen, but in the meantime, the Duke has requested a day of mourning."
EYR_take_control:0 "Take Matters Into Our Own Claws"
EYR_take_control_desc:0 "We must break this vicious cycle of war. No more will we be the defenders in Vincent's game. If we want things to change, we must go on the offence!"
EYR_empower_prelature:0 "Cooperate With The Prelature"
EYR_empower_prelature_desc:0 "Those who keep claiming that the Prelature is running a conspiracy with the foreigners, at the expense of Verenia, are clearly misguided and irrational. Though the paladins' defection years ago was treacherous, those who remained have clearly proved themselves to be trustworthy. Only with them standing by our side can we end the Struggle."
EYR_empower_merchants:0 "Cooperate With The Middle Class"
EYR_empower_merchants_desc:0 "After the republican revolution, we placed several restrictions on merchant trade. Admittedly, this has hampered our economy and kept our country from growing. Though we haven't excused them of the guilt, we should consider giving them a bit more autonomy in exchange for their support."
EYR_invite_foreigners:0 "Invite Foreign Assistance"
EYR_invite_foreigners_desc:0 "Let us be honest: our soldiers are not the best. The constant battles have whittled down our best soldiers and our equipment has become faultier over the years. If we want the upper hand, we need to reach out to more fortunate lands for help."
EYR_overrule_hof:0 "With The Duke Or Against Him"
EYR_overrule_hof_desc:0 "It is time for more... decisive actions. We will remove every griffon who calls for peace. We will execute any noble who disagrees with the Duke. We will be unified against the rebels, or we will die."
EYR_press_paladins_into_service:0 "The Return Of The Paladins"
EYR_press_paladins_into_service_desc:0 "After the late Duke's death, most of the paladins joined Vincent in his rebellion. The remnant remained loyal to the Prelature, maintaining neutralily to protect the holy sites. If we can show our new resolve to the paladins in the temple, they may join Iovinus in ending this war."
EYR_deal_with_flowena:0 "Flowena Backroom Deal"
EYR_deal_with_flowena_desc:0 "Being on the other side of House Erie's lands, Flowena would have a lot to gain – and lose – from the war. Perhaps they'd be willing to split with some gold and equipment, or even join our cause? We should reach out to them about an alliance."
EYR_fuck_off_vincent:0 "The Restoration Of Righteous Rule"
EYR_fuck_off_vincent_desc:0 "Vincent Erie is but a pitiful mongrel, unworthy of even ruling the smallest patch of land, much less proud Verenia herself. For all the might he boasts of, it will inevitably crash against our strongholds, our gallant defenders. The song of war claims Verenia once more, and this time we shall be the victors without uncertainty."
EYR_new_captain:0 "Appease The Nobles"
EYR_new_captain_desc:0 "As unfortunate as his death is, we cannot leave Guard-Captain Otto's position vacant. Vincent's forces are mounting across the river as we speak. Desperate times call for desperate measures, and so we must cooperate with the more... warmongering side of the nobility."
EYR_convene_court:0 "A Meeting In Haste"
EYR_convene_court_desc:0 "Quickly! Gather the council! We cannot relax against the face of an invasion. Every aspect of our country will be affected, and if we ignore a single possibility, we will lose this war. We must plan accordingly for these next few months."
EYR_the_yearly_obligations:0 "Arms, Armour, Idols"
EYR_the_yearly_obligations_desc:0 "Waging war is all about supplies and logistics, for what good is a griffon if he has no weapon or uniform? Recent events necessitate a forced increase in the production of materiel, all paid for from the Duke's personal treasury. A small investment that pays great dividends for the continued survival."
EYR_fund_economist:0 "Adjusting The Books"
EYR_fund_economist_desc:0 "War is an economic torment for the Duke of Eyrie and his lands. Maintaining a standing army is incredibly expensive, and thus we are struggling to complete the mobilisation in face of this new attack. However, the House Treasurer is an incredibly gifted administrator and should be able to achieve such, though it will come at a considerable expense."
EYR_the_prelature:0 "Beseech The Prelature For Aid"
EYR_the_prelature_desc:0 "With the mobilisation experiencing many issues, it is clear we won't be able to bring our full strength against House Erie's assault. While our defensive position ensures that we can hold them off with inferior numbers, it would be good to even the odds with the help of the paladins. These gallant warriors, always prepared for war, will make up the deficit, but their help comes with a cost."
EYR_what_we_must:0 "In Defence Of Eyrie"
EYR_what_we_must_desc:0 "Soldiers, knights, peasants, merchants, nobles - they all fight for House Eyrie, directly or indirectly. The time is right for them to be placed on high alert, to muster their capabilities, for a storm is coming, and we must all work together in all our capacity to weather it."
EYR_militias:0 "Peasant Militias"
EYR_militias_desc:0 "They grumble and complain, but the lowly have an obligation to their betters that is simply unavoidable. It is not exploitation, but rather a continuance of a social contract that has defined relations between griffons since ages past. To arms, peasants, for House Eyrie, for Verenia!"
EYR_defence_plan:0 "To Counter Their Plans"
EYR_defence_plan_desc:0 "The villainous Vincent is a crude oaf, but it is not he who decides strategy. His subordinates are far more competent and effective, no doubt hatching some ingenious plan, and we must decide on our own strategy to effectively counter any surprise they might have. The Duke will be holding a meeting with the new Guard-Captain and his officers."
EYR_holding_fast:0 "Surviving The Onslaught"
EYR_holding_fast_desc:0 "We've rallied as best as we could, and war is inevitable. It is certain that the other side of the riverline can see our stalwart defences, yet they remain committed to their attack. Let them break once more, and only then shall we surge forward to put an end to a Struggle so great that claimed to many lives."

EYR_stalemate_reigns:0 "Stalemate Reigns"
EYR_stalemate_reigns_desc:0 "The Duke is most displeased with his disobedient underlings. There was a clear plan, agreed by everygriff, and it was not followed. It's only the smallest of condolences that we're left with a ceasefire, as if nothing happened, though that's no satisfaction for all the perished souls. Something has to change in this broken house."

EYR_the_state_of_the_treasury:0 "Review Finances"
EYR_the_state_of_the_treasury_desc:0 "The House Treasurer is a griff of unparalleled ability when it comes to managing the idols. It's certain that without her, the soldiers would be reduced to wearing sacks instead of uniforms, and the economy would revert to bartering. Relying on her substantial abilities could result in House Eyrie prevailing in the Struggle without those unruly nobles."
EYR_the_local_economy:0 "Address The Road Problem"
EYR_the_local_economy_desc:0 "The constant usage of our infrastructure, primarily for military purposes, has resulted in their deterioration. There is simply little resources left for maintaining them, but recent developments have given us an opportunity to correct this. However, desires differ while there's only so many idols to go around..."
EYR_consoomer_goods:0 "Putting The Unsuitables To Work"
EYR_consoomer_goods_desc:0 "Serfdom continues to be a common sight in Verenia, for better or worse. It is simple and straightforward to build new factories, but the shortage of labour makes them produce much less than they could. Something has to be negotiated to allow these griffs without rights to put their labour into something far more valuable than plowing some fruitless field."
EYR_solving_resource_deficits:0 "Expand Mining Industry"
EYR_solving_resource_deficits_desc:0 "Abundant fields aren't the only quality Verenia possesses, but there are a number of promising veins where natural resources are plentiful. Though we are currently self-sufficient for all our domestic needs, unlike that incompetent stooge across the river, growing industry will demand a larger quantity of them. Best to preempt the problem."
EYR_funding_a_solution:0 "Supplementing Inadequancies"
EYR_funding_a_solution_desc:0 "Unbeknownst to most, the House Treasurer runs an illicit scheme. A most dangerous one, in arms dealing, which has been a decent source to supplement our middling production. The Duke has been considering expanding these operations, but they'll need a better cover, lest the nobles discover they are being shortchanged."
EYR_embargo_vincent:0 "Offering A Better Deal"
EYR_embargo_vincent_desc:0 "Even though most nations refuse to take any part in the Struggle, ordinary trade continues to flow. This is what allows Vincent to stay afloat despite completely neglecting the needs of his subjects. Perhaps, if those same nations were offered an incentive to cease their trade, House Erie will be in a far more disadvantageous position for the final battle."
EYR_better_weapons:0 "Firearm Modernisation Scheme"
EYR_better_weapons_desc:0 "From the humble musket to today's rifle, firearms have seen considerable advancement over the centuries. Freya has only a passing interest in them, but she knows that having the best weapon results in highest chance of success. Simple mathematics, as it is, which is why this is a pursuit that deserves funding."
EYR_devil_deal:0 "To Sell Pride And Blood"
EYR_devil_deal_desc:0 "Flowena's bankers present an united front, but some would be happy to work behind the backs of their colleagues for a good deal. Freya happens to be friends with one, and he could circumvent the blockade their banks unjustly exert on House Eyrie. Nothing comes free, however, but concluding the Struggle would be worth any price they name. As long as we don't end up selling Verenia to them as a result."

EYR_touring_the_barracks:0 "Tour The Barracks"
EYR_touring_the_barracks_desc:0 "Though the Guard-Captain is a griff of rough temperament, the soldiers readily follow him, whether out of fear or devotion. To reassure the troops that their liege lord does care for them, Iovinus shall take his time to visit the injured, and perhaps give out medals where appropriate. Of course, the primary goal is to define the new defensive plan, and prevent a repeat of recent events."
EYR_factory_expansion_project:0 "Industrial Expansion Project"
EYR_factory_expansion_project_desc:0 "Verenia is not the richest of regions, but that doesn't mean its production capabilities should be outsourced to some idol grubber from Rottendedam. Instead, we should provide incentives for our industrial magnates to expand their options, hire more workers, all those boring things. Some kickbacks are to be expected, but as long as House Eyrie benefits as a whole, it can be tolerated."
EYR_repair_forts:0 "Save What Can Be Saved"
EYR_repair_forts_desc:0 "What little fortifications we have are on the verge of crumbling, and much effort is placed into maintaining them as best as possible given scant resources. Many reasons prevent us from expanding them into a formidable structure that could keep Vincent's rabble at bay, but for now we should give them the attention they deserve."
EYR_tithes_and_tribute:0 "The Duke's Amazing Collection"
EYR_tithes_and_tribute_desc:0 "Like any proper noble, Iovinus has an extensive collection of artwork, coinage, apparel and precious metals. Such vast value that could fund entire regiments to fight on our side... if he could be convinced to part with any of it. Certainly, it could be bought again after the war... and if he's not victorious, then he'll have larger problems to worry about."
EYR_enact_conscription:0 "Replenish The Guard"
EYR_enact_conscription_desc:0 "It is difficult to ascertain how many griffs are currently serving in the Verenian Guard, for many reasons. Yet the most recent bloodshed has raised concerns that our effective strength is insufficient to resist the next attack. There is no doubt it is arriving, sooner or later, which is why the quotas must be expanded and new regiments raised for the Duke."
EYR_calm_the_nobles:0 "Having A Ball"
EYR_calm_the_nobles_desc:0 "In such uncertain times, we must turn to our traditions and reassure the most important griffs that everything is fine. The grand palace has not held a party since the days of peace, and don't our gallant nobility deserve a night to relax? The merchants and other such undesirables will not be allowed to attend, and they better not complain either!"
EYR_righteousness_of_our_cause:0 "Convincing The Peasants"
EYR_righteousness_of_our_cause_desc:0 "It comes without surprise that the Struggle is not a very popular concern for the people. After all, they have far more worries in their lives than fighting for some distant, uncaring lord... But perhaps a sufficient amount could be convinced otherwise. By word or reward, and some creative interpretation of truth, there could be more volunteers for the cause."
EYR_hold_court:0 "A Day In Court"
EYR_hold_court_desc:0 "One of the many obligations the Duke owes to his subjects is holding court on a yearly basis. There, they present their grievances and requests, after exhausting all other means of satisfaction, and the gracious ruler either obliges or dismisses their demands. Generosity can inspire the people, but choices made can have a long lasting consequence."
EYR_aerial_advantage:0 "Different Vector Of Attack"
EYR_aerial_advantage_desc:0 "Some nobles are proponents of technology, and realise that if we want an actual advantage, something has to change. Through their Herzland contacts, they could secure us aircraft that are beyond House Erie's ability to counter. The only issue is instructing griffs to operate these machines on a quick notice, but that could be corrected by simply hiring experienced ones."
EYR_officer_training:0 "Correcting Knowledge Gaps"
EYR_officer_training_desc:0 "The officers of the Verenian Guard, by requirement all nobles, are not bereft of skill in war, but combat is an always changing problem. With the knowledge gained over the decades of Struggle, we should devote some resources to teaching present and future ones how to perform more effectively. It may be crucial in the coming days..."
EYR_unassailable_defence:0 "Come And Take It, Vincent!"
EYR_unassailable_defence_desc:0 "The unruly ones have been restrained, and this time there shall be nothing going against the plan. The river Aranti shall choke with their dead, but the plan must be flexible. Like a cornered snake, there is no telling what sort of desperate gamble Vincent will perform. We need to be prepared for anything, and the Guard-Captain will ensure it is so."

EYR_the_temple_of_eyr:0 "Spiritual Respite"
EYR_the_temple_of_eyr_desc:0 "While many put distrust in the Verenian Prelate (and are rightfully afraid of her glare), Iovinus does not share this attitude. He understands that the resources under her control could be crucial for the unification, even if many others believe he's making a deal with Maar by doing so. Nonetheless, there is nothing that can prevent the Duke from attending a sermon."
EYR_look_for_the_poor:0 "Comfort For The Needy"
EYR_look_for_the_poor_desc:0 "The Struggle has left many griffs destitute, due to taxation, crippling injuries sustained in a battle or other unpleasant outcomes. Thus there's a large amount of homeless which even the Temple of Eyr struggles to provide for. If the Duke were to give them a claw, it would show his devotion to the Gods, and more importantly remove the loitering vagrants from the streets of Calembourg."
EYR_pleb_schools:0 "Spreading The Right Wisdom"
EYR_pleb_schools_desc:0 "Education is by tradition a luxury reserved for the more well-off, leaving many to rely on common folk "wisdom". Present circumstances are not favourable for enacting some sort of full scale mandatory schooling policy, but we could spare some idols in this direction. Of course, we'd make sure that the knowledge shared would be favourable towards us."
EYR_bless_the_fields:0 "Land's Bounty"
EYR_bless_the_fields_desc:0 "The many legends of Verenia credit Eyr for the plentiful miracles that have occurred in its long and storied history. While proving the influence of the divine is like trying to fight dragons bareclawed, the rituals provide griffs a sense of comfort and security that is hard to inspire otherwise. As always, the Prelate will be happy to perform them, if given the resources."
EYR_the_paladins:0 "The Proud Ones Of The Triarchy"
EYR_the_paladins_desc:0 "Continued cooperation with the Prelature is putting Iovinus in an unenviable position. The nobility are finding many excuses and loopholes to decrease their griffonpower contribution, convinced that the Duke is selling out Verenia to foreign interests. What ridiculous notions! Yet there is little other choice but to reintegrate the paladin remnants into the household forces."
EYR_tax_of_piety:0 "Eyr's Eleos"
EYR_tax_of_piety_desc:0 "Per the ancient laws since the days of Grover I, the temples do not collect any sort of taxation or tribute; they subsist by donations or their clergy's contributions. Laws can easily change with a ducal signature, and it would benefit the Prelature if they were allowed to take one tenth of the serfs' taxes. Some of it would find its way back into matters the Duke desires."
EYR_strike_fear:0 "Fear Of The Divine"
EYR_strike_fear_desc:0 "There are many a griff in Verenia who are quite lacking in basic erudition. Superstitious, frightful, quite easily cowed into believing something they shouldn't. The Prelate retains many contacts on the west side of the Aranti river, and if the right message were to spread... Vincent would have quite a scuffle on his claws."
EYR_archonate_friends:0 "Our Friends In Romau"
EYR_archonate_friends_desc:0 "While prelatures are mostly independent from the desires of the archonates, there are still certain niceties to be observed. With her contacts in Romau, Verena could decisively change the outcome of the Struggle in our favour. The only questions that remain is whether the nobility will accept this foreign interference, and the sort of price Erion XII would exact from us."

EYR_ducal_guard_leader:0 "Roman Eitelkeit"
EYR_ducal_guard_leader_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 12th of July, 963 in Angburg\n§YRank§!: Hauptgreif der Verenianischen Garde\n§YTitle§!: Graf von Angburg\n\n§YBiography§!§L: The Eitelkeits have been a fixture in Verenia since its founding days, and though they've held many influential positions over the years, they always considered themselves to be snubbed by the ruling family. Whether they felt that way out of misplaced pride or genuine contempt, none of them have held the honour of leading the Verenian Guard... until now.\n\nRoman considers himself a very pragmatic griffon. He sees a problem, and solves it in the most efficient way. He has little patience for the Duke's stalling strategy, and he has made that clear on many occasions. Even now, as the Captain of the Guard, he is forced to follow those orders, much to Roman's dismay. If he just could have been in charge when the whole rebellion started, it wouldn't have lasted for more than a year, or so he likes to think.\n\nNonetheless, the Guard-Captain is a capable leader, though not a creative one. His intense drilling standards ensure the common soldier is prepared for anything, who certainly don't need any poncy paladins! Perhaps, if Roman proves himself worthy by overcoming the vile secessionists, there could be a new rising star in Verenia.\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!: Bunnyshrubby"

EYR_prelate_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 15th of November, 964 in Romau\n§YOccupation§!: Prälat von Verenia\n\n§YBiography§!§L: The Gods watch over all griffonkind, but They have their favourites, too. It is widely believed that Eyr blessed the fields of Verenia, giving them an abundant bounty.\n\nPerhaps Eyr watched over Verena as well, given her unlikely rise to the respectful position of prelate. She never knew her parents, her only relation was a sister that disappeared in the chaos of 978. Subsisting purely on eleos of the local temple, her only comfort in life was dedicating herself to the Triarchy. A good and righteous cause, for in a world full of misery, it was the duty of all griffons to bring comfort to the weary.\n\nHer assignment in Verenia was only meant to be a temporary one, but local conditions made her stay permanent. Time and again, she championed for the cause of peace and reconciliation between the Three Houses, but her pleas and prayers were routinely ignored. Additionally, as the prelature is officially in control of the Paladin Order, many of the local nobility distrust her, believing she's pursuing an agenda of her own. Already a stern and uncompromising griff of the robe, this treatment has steeled Verena's faith further. Only a scant few are righteous enough to pass her test of purity, and woe betide anygriff who end up the target of her admonishing gaze.\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!: Rari"

As one of the Duke's most trusted advisors, responsible for every idol in his purse, Freya has considerable leeway to act in the interest of her perfectionist tendencies. If it were her way, Verenia would be richer than Skyfall!\n\nUnfortunately, we all live in an imperfect world, and Freya constantly struggles with keeping the realm fiscally solvent. Whereas others throw money like it grows on trees, and not even on actually useful things, she uses every legal and illegal trick in the book to keep the economy going. Though with few loves in life besides work and fashionable outfits, Freya looks forward to the day when this mess is done with, the idea of a relaxing vacation on some distant island occupying her mind.\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!: Rari"

Sigrid was the highest paladin remaining in the service of House Eyrie, which led to her ascension as commander... with very few of the benefits.\n\nDistrusted by the local nobility and restrained by the Prelature, the once proud paladin turned dour as she was consigned to sitting at a desk, unable to take the field as befitting of a warrior.

#### EVENTS

eyrie.1.t:0 "A Brief Recollection Of Events"
eyrie.1.d:0 "I am Iovinus, heir to the Verenian legacy and patriarch of the noble house Eyrie, who have ruled these lands for centuries. For many years, I have been locked in a dynastic dispute with my irresponsible older half-sibling Vincent. How I loathe his irrational, thoughtless behaviour. It was I who should have succeeded to rulership after the horrid republican uprising, which left many family members dead, but he would not concede to the fact that it is House Erie that is subservient to House Eyrie.\n\nNow, there's been little peace, and even less respite. I watched many young and promising griffons march to the riverfront, only to learn that they've perished. It is their duty to serve their liege lord, yes, but I do not wish to throw lives away. None of this should have happened. Lady Amelinda, she helped with her surprising defection, but remained a mystery with her intentions. Her daughter Katrina will have to see reason in the end. It is my Gods given right to rule Verenia, and restore her splendour to how it was.\n\nThe commoners despise us, yet more backlash comes from my supposedly subservient nobles. Instead of wisely digging in, time and again they've wasted our power on futile attacks. Worse still, they distrust the paladins, Verenia's sworn guardians.\n\nThis story has been dragged on for too long. How will it end? Nobody but the Gods know, and they don't talk."
eyrie.1.a:0 "The claw of fate guides us all."

eyrie.2.t:0 "Defence Of The Realm"
eyrie.2.d:0 "Iovinus was not pleased with the situation he ended up in. Yes, the impending attack was most worrisome, but he was far more happier with Guard-Captain von Grieslein, who had dutifully followed his attrition strategy, than the new Guard-Captain Eitelkeit, who was among the most vocal ones clamouring for a decisive strike. In spite of the fact that all previous attempts had failed, they continued insisting... and now one of them was in charge of the war planning.\n\n"Let us hear what you have prepared, Guard-Captain." While the Duke could overrule his subordinates, it would undoubtedly cause unnecessary friction. This was not a time for arguments, and they would either work together or die together.\n\nIn his tightly fitting uniform, the Guard-Captain looked very much like an imposing force that was not to be crossed with. Nodding wordlessly, he would stand up to present his strategy over the detailed map of the Aranti riverline. "Mein Herzog, with the limited time and resources at our disposal, there is little other recourse but to continue using our existing plans. However, with the help from our informants on the other side, orders have been prepared to reinforce areas we expect to bear the brunt of their attack." It was short, brief and to the point.\n\nIt was a surprisingly... reasonable course, and Iovinus could not offer any protests in the matter. The other, lower ranking officers of the Guard more or less agreed with their Captain, and only thing left was clearing some minor concerns. The Duke dearly hoped there would be no insubordination this time. He still remembered the last one."

eyrie.6.t:0 "On A Minute's Notice"
eyrie.6.d:0 "When the dukes of the past moved from the fortress outside of Calembourg to the ostentatiously named "grand palace" (more of a fancier manor home, really) inside the city, they intended to keep it purely as a private residence. Practicality, however, resulted in a different outcome, and now Iovinus was taking a leisurely stroll to where Freya, the house treasurer, oversaw a small army of idol counters that kept his state fiscally solvent.\n\nThe large hall, dubbed the "administration quarter", was full of overly busy griffs. Desks were full of papers, and in some cases idols, assisted by primitive machinery that helped lessen the burden of mathematical calculations. If only everygriff could work so tirelessly and efficiently for his cause. Iovinus was quick to find the lady in charge, helpfully standing in the middle of the room.\n\n"How you manage this on a daily basis is most impressive, Freya. Where would House Eyrie be without you?" Large requests needed a decent amount of praise, of course.\n\nThe neatly dressed griff looked away from her clipboard, beaming with joy at her Duke. "Why thank you kindly, Iovinus!" He appreciated that she was comfortable enough to be informal. "There's nothing quite like fixing issues and trying to make them better. It's an endless chore, but the satisfaction is worthwhile. Now, what brings you here? Not much time for idle chat."\n\nShort sigh. "War's coming again, Freya. The mobilisation isn't happening quickly enough and I need you and your abilities to make it happen. My sources in House Erie say there's but a few weeks left." Why waste words trying to hide things.\n\nHer enthusiasm momentarily faltered, but she would turn around and pick up a few forms. "You should have come to me earlier, mein Herzog, but it won't be an issue. I trust I'm allowed to make the necessary expenditures?" If there's anygriff he trusted to spend money, it was Freya."
eyrie.6.a:0 "A real miracle maker."

eyrie.7.t:0 "At The Summit Of Eyr"
eyrie.7.d:0 "The disused fortress was the highest point near Calembourg, but within the city itself, the place of honour belonged to Eyr's temple which stood upon a hill. This was where Iovinus was headed today, despite the protests of his vassals: he wanted the paladins to help repulse Vincent's assault, and he simply couldn't mobilise enough of the regular forces in time.\n\nThe interior was ascetic in accordance with divine mandate, yet comforting in a way that was difficult to describe. Iovinus would briefly close his eyes and exhale, his worries briefly fading, before looking around for the griff on his mind. It was easy to find her, with that distinct circlet and hood, as he passed between several attendees who paid their Duke no heed.\n\nBut the prelate was occupied in conversation with her paladin protector, who sensed a figure approaching and turned her head around. "It seems we have an important visitor, Verena." Said paladin lowered her head deferentially, moving next to Verena, who regarded Iovinus with her usual cold gaze.\n\n"That we do, Sigrid. What can the Prelature do for our Duke of Eyrie today?" Unlike her companion, Verena did not offer any sort of respectful gesture. It didn't bother him in the slightest for Iovinus was used to her unyielding behaviour.\n\n"There'll be another invasion soon, Prelate. I need the paladins to rebuff this attack." Short and to the point, as he always liked it. The pair exchanged glances and whispered between themselves, but he could tell Sigrid was welcoming the prospect of battle. Quickly would Verena address Iovinus again.\n\n"Are you prepared to meet the recent requests, my Duke?" A small nod. "Even knowing there will be displeasure at the court?" A more hesitant nod. "Then we are prepared to serve in the defence of your cause.""

Vincent was most perturbed by this sudden interruption of his quality free time, glaring at the stammering official as he rattled off words from a report.\n\n"W-what I mean is, y-your lordship, is that our foreign neighbours have cut us off entirely from their markets, suspending all shipments of resources, consumer goods, grain and..."\n\n"But we need those! How could this happen, I thought everything was under control?! How will we maintain our war measures if we can't even feed our peasants?" While the Duke didn't know much about international commerce or production line capacities, it was painfully clear an embargo was very bad news, especially for his impoverished lands.\n\n"W-we don't know! Nothing has changed in our agreements, this must be Iovinus' scheme..."\n\nVincent's eyes narrowed as he immediately charted a very rational and reasonable conclusion how that scoundrel could have plotted this. Of course it's all Iovinus' fault! "Get back to work, servant, and figure out some way to fix this." Just like that, the griff scampered, leaving him to brood and ponder an even more cruel vengeance once he got east of the Aranti..."

He left strict orders not to be disturbed, and the bliss of solitude helped to calm him after the most recent fiasco. Nogriff wanted this Struggle, yet they were all chained by it, seemingly forever, the burden of responsibility crushing even the most resolute griff.\n\nBut he didn't despair yet. What kept Iovinus' thoughts steady were his dearest wife's words, written on fine vellum. He went over them so many times, he could recite it by heart, recall with perfection the subtle quirks in her griffonage. The contents were most mundane, but it pleased him to no end knowing she and their chicks were safe and sound. Lothra and Lorien... his daughters were his greatest treasure, far more than anything in this accursed Verenia.\n\nThey were so far away, though. It broke Iovinus to do so, but he sent them away to their vacation home, at the outskirts of Skyfall. If anything happened to him... at least they would be safe, and he alone could suffer the consequences of failure."
eyrie.18.a:0 "Corinna... you'll come back soon, I promise."

eyrie.19.t:0 "The Court Of The Sunlight Shield"
eyrie.19.d:0 "Iovinus did not relish holding court. It was one of his obligations, yes, but it was difficult to make a decision which left both parties satisfied, and he always had to be mindful of how his courtiers would respond. At least such a hesitation did not occur when justice was being dispensed: lawbreakers were guilty not just in the eyes of their betters, but the Gods as well.\n\nThus he took a seat at the throne of his father, the chamber filled and awaiting his word. Roman stood by his side, the immaculate uniform firmly pressed as always, acting as his advisor in all matters of state and justice. It was Iovinus' choice to have him make decisions in his stead, and he tended to leave what he perceived as less popular outcomes to the Graf.\n\n"All rise! The Duke of Eyrie and the liege lord of all Verenia has declared this session of the court to be open. Petitioners will approach one by one and present their requests." Roman's booming baritone stiffened anygriff who seemed to be dozing off, before he turned to Iovinus and continued in a more sotto voce. "The griffs were pre-approved in advance to avoid a repeat of last time, but there is still a sizeable number waiting. If you feel this to be beneath your dignity, I shall carry on with the proceedings in your name."\n\nIovinus peered ahead and confirmed that yes, there were plenty of both commoners and upper crusts waiting. As much as he wished to slip away from this droll doldrum, it was not a good idea to depend on Roman too much. Publicly overriding his decisions could result in further disobedience, yet nogriff would question their Herzog in this very room."
eyrie.19.a:0 ""May the first griffon proceed at their leisure.""
eyrie.19.b:0 "Let Roman take care of everything. Pretend to be listening."

eyrie.20.t:0 "Farmer's Case"
eyrie.20.d:0 ""The Court will be hearing a case against Konrad, a petty farmer." Thus called the court herald's voice as a scrawny griff was brought before the Duke. Iovinus already pitied the ragged appearance, but the appearance of impassivity was paramount. Roman continued where the herald left off. "He stands guilty of having stolen from the ducal granaries, and attempted to flee and resist arrest. The punishment for stealing from the crown is death, but Konrad has used his right to plead for mercy and lenience." Those last few words came out like an insult from Roman's beak.\n\n"This appears to be an issue without a mystery. Konrad, what do you have to say in defence of your actions?" What will it be this time.\n\n"M-mercy, your lordship! My family was starving as our harvest failed this year. We have nothing to eat, please spare me!" The broken griff dropped to the floor as he cried and begged in-between unintelligible words. Iovinus looked around as all the high and mighty looked with faces of disgust, but proper bearing prevented them from voicing their displeasures.\n\n"Spare yourself some dignity, Konrad, for I have made my decision." One last hopeful look from the miserable being."
eyrie.20.a:0 ""Hang this griffon, as a deterrent for all thieves.""

eyrie.21.t:0 "Merchant's Grumbling"
eyrie.21.d:0 ""The Court will be hearing a petition from Arvin Geldklaue, a Calembourgian merchant." Iovinus' eyes narrowed. What do the vultures want this time? Another city to burn, perhaps? With a bow, the finely dressed griff introduced himself.\n\n"On behalf of the Merchant's Guild, I thank you for allowing me this opportunity to present our plea. My Duke, as you are well aware, the stringent tariffs placed on all mercantile activity has severely hampered any growth and thus led to the current sorry state. We understand that you require the funds for the war effort, but if these taxes were lowered, it would be a benefit to Verenia as a whole." As the idol pincher began to inundate the conversation with statistics and economic theory, he was cut off by Roman.\n\n"I would advise against this petition, my Duke. The tariffs are meant to protect our feeble industry from foreigners and their unequal deals, even at the expense of our domestic growth. This could be discussed again after we crush the secessionists, but now is not the time."\n\n"Or perhaps our obliging nobility could pay a larger share to the treasury." The merchant quipped in a very helpful and sarcastic manner, earning a glare from most of the room's occupants. Iovinus had to admit he considered the idea from time to time, but he knew it would be resisted at every pawstep.\n\n"That'll be enough, Arvin. Here is what the Court has decided." So many eyes staring at him."
eyrie.21.a:0 ""Your request has been granted, for the time being.""

Two griffs, in all their finery, took place before the Duke, glaring daggers at each other all the while. Iovinus accepted their well-meaning words and motioned for the left griff to begin.\n\n"My lord and duke of Eyrie, I urge you to resolve this issue once and for all. My family, the House of Weingut, have served yours for many years, and we only wish to continue doing so." Quite the effort for flattery, yes. "House von Geisslerg has promised ours a parcel of land as part of a dowry, but they have reneged on their agreement. We only ask you to uphold a fair and honest agreement."\n\nCould it really be so simple? "What does House von Geisslerg say to this?"\n\nThe right griffon, who was having the most incredulous look for a while, spoke. "The words are true, but what my equal forgot to mention is that their bride turned out to be a liar and a cheater with no respect for marital vows. We do not consider ourselves bound to an agreement where one side is blatantly disho—"\n\n"How dare you speak of my sister like this! I'll have your feathers plucked!" But before the adoring rivals could swing claws at each other, Roman's harsh tone turned them into meek chicks. What to do? The Geisslergs were one of the less problematic vassals, yes, but they were poorer compared to the Weinguts. However, the latter were obvious lackeys of the Eitelkeits, and Roman didn't need more influence in this court."

Duke Iovinus is a picture of impassivity, it's almost frightening how nothing bothers him."\n\n"No, no, he swore it happened. That the Duke, he climbed on the table, with madness in his eyes as he furiously waved his claws and spread his wings. The poncy nobles were all in shock, listening to their master ramble about 'being the one' and 'ending the cycle of despair'. I couldn't believe it myself until I had it checked with the others."\n\nIngrid was shocked, to say the least. She had no love for her station in life, but the Duke, he was a respectable employer and never did anything wrong, as far as she knew. "And then what?"\n\nGreta waved her claws in a shrugging motion. "His attendant dragged him away before he could start throwing the main course. Kicked and screamed to resist, too.""

eyrie.666.d:0 "The air was cold and still within Iovinus' quarters. Another day spent making difficult decisions, another day spent wrangling with his subordinates, every day a little harder to bear. He had been hanging at the end of his rope, under the weight of anxiety he hid deep beneath a shroud of confidence and bravery. Spending much of the night unable to sleep, thinking about his family, his legacy, his beautiful Verenia. Sitting at his desk, writing a letter intended for his wife, he would finally succumb to his exhaustion.\n\nA quiet creak could be heard, followed by silence.\n\nThe soft noise would be enough to wake him up, but what he saw then exposed just how insignificant he was. A figure stood before him, black as the sky outside and as silent as the room around them. The shrouded griff looked off, almost blurry and unfocused, like it was trying to be multiple things at once. Its presence made the Duke feel warm and peaceful, yet nervous, frightened. It would reach with a long, desiccated arm, opening its claw to Iovinus. He looked at it with confusion, briefly glancing at the figure's face. There was nothing, just a slow nod and a whisper.\n\n"It could be your time."\n\nWhat time? He already spent most of his lifetime wasting under his burdens. If only it would all end already so he didn't have to worry anymore. His mind was telling him to reject anything the figure offered, but... He was so tired of everything."

eyrie_news.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The so-called Verenian Struggle has outlasted many conflicts that arose from the Republican Revolution of 978. Even as neighbouring regions settled into a pretence of peace, the infamously stubborn heirs of the late Verenian duke refused to lay down their weapons as battles and ceasefires followed one after another. Thus, the proudly independent region has only known strife for decades.\n\nYet to the surprise of many, the cycle of familial bloodshed has ended on this day. Despite the unenviable situation, [EYR.GetLeader] has emerged victorious over his rivals and reasserted himself as the legitimate ruler of Verenia. As the weary populace hopes to rebuild, the tenacious Duke has much to do to secure himself a lasting reign."

#### FOCUS

EYR_fifth_onslaught:0 "The Fifth Onslaught"
EYR_fifth_onslaught_desc:0 "Our reliable sources have confirmed what we all dread: Vincent Erie, the self proclaimed Duke of Erie, is preparing a yet another attack against his rightful liege lord. The true ruler of Verenia must rally his soldiers, marshal his defences and prepare his people. House Eyrie does not bow before insurgents and mutineers."
EYR_sudden_death:0 "An Unexpected Passing"
EYR_sudden_death_desc:0 "A great tragedy has fallen upon our nation with the death of Captain Otto. His tenacity and intelligence defended our realm for many years, and his loss at such a tense time will be felt. In the meantime, the Duke has requested a day of mourning."
EYR_take_control:0 "Take Matters Into Our Own Claws"
EYR_take_control_desc:0 "We must break this vicious cycle of war. No more will we be the defenders in Vincent's game. If we want things to change, we must go on the offence!"
EYR_empower_prelature:0 "Cooperate With The Prelature"
EYR_empower_prelature_desc:0 "The Prelature has always been a strong influence on our griffons. They have all the gold and soldiers we need to bring a decisive end to Vincent's terror. Perhaps we can come to a consensus with the Temple in exchange for some contributions to the war effort."
EYR_empower_merchants:0 "Cooperate With The Middle Class"
EYR_empower_merchants_desc:0 "After the republican revolution, we placed several restrictions on merchant trade. Admittedly, this has hampered our economy and kept our country from growing. Though we haven't excused them of the guilt, we should consider giving them a bit more autonomy in exchange for their support."
EYR_invite_foreigners:0 "Invite Foreign Assistance"
EYR_invite_foreigners_desc:0 "Let us be honest: our soldiers are not the best. The constant battles have whittled down our best warriors and our equipment has become faultier over the years. If we want the upper hand, we need to reach out to more fortunate lands for help."
EYR_overrule_hof:0 "With The Duke Or Against Him"
EYR_overrule_hof_desc:0 "It is time for more... extensive decisions. We will remove every griffon who calls for peace. We will execute any noble who disagrees with the Duke. We will be unified against the rebels, or we will die."
EYR_press_paladins_into_service:0 "The Return Of The Paladins"
EYR_press_paladins_into_service_desc:0 "After the late Duke's death, most of the paladins joined Vincent in his rebellion. The rest joined the Prelature, firmly out of our talons. If we can show our new resolve to the paladins in the temple, they may join the Duke once more in ending this war."
EYR_deal_with_flowena:0 "Flowena Backroom Deal"
EYR_deal_with_flowena_desc:0 "Being on the other side of House Erie's lands, Flowena would have a lot to gain – and lose – from the war. Perhaps they'd be willing to split with some gold and equipment, or even join our cause? We should reach out to them about an alliance."
EYR_fuck_off_vincent:0 "The Restoration Of Righteous Rule"
EYR_fuck_off_vincent_desc:0 "Vincent Erie is but a pitiful mongrel, unworthy of even ruling the smallest patch of land, much less proud Verenia herself. For all the might he boasts of, it will inevitably crash against our strongholds, our gallant defenders. The song of war claims Verenia once more, and this time we shall be the victors without uncertainty."
EYR_new_captain:0 "Appease The Nobles"
EYR_new_captain_desc:0 "As unfortunate as his death is, we cannot leave Captain Otto's position vacant. Vincent's forces are mounting across the river as we speak. Desperate times call for desperate measures, and so we must receive help from the more... warmongering side of the nobility."
EYR_convene_court:0 "A Meeting In Haste"
EYR_convene_court_desc:0 "Quickly! Gather the council! We cannot relax against the face of an invasion. Every aspect of our country will be affected, and if we ignore a single ministry, we will lose this war. We must plan accordingly for these next few months."
EYR_the_yearly_obligations:0 "Arms, Armour, Idols"
EYR_the_yearly_obligations_desc:0 "Waging war is all about supplies and logistics, for what good is a griffon if he has no weapon or uniform? Recent events necessitate a forced increase in the production of materiel, all paid for from the Duke's personal treasury. A small investment that pays great dividends for the continued survival."
EYR_fund_economist:0 "Adjusting The Books"
EYR_fund_economist_desc:0 "War is an economic torment for House Eyrie and its lands. If we want to survive, though, we will need to get money from somewhere. Though our commongriffs would not like it, we could tip the budget in the military's favour. Who needs schools anyways?"
EYR_the_prelature:0 "Beseech The Prelature For Aid"
EYR_the_prelature_desc:0 "The temples have everything we need: gold and the Paladins who did not join Vincent. We could rally them to our efforts for something in return. Seats in the council, increased support – anything to get our talons on their stockpile and soldiers."
EYR_what_we_must:0 "In Defence Of Eyrie"
EYR_what_we_must_desc:0 "Soldiers, knights, peasants, merchants, nobles - they all fight for House Eyrie, directly or indirectly. The time is right for them to be placed on high alert, to muster their capabilities, for a storm is coming, and we must all work together in all our capacity to weather it."
EYR_militias:0 "Peasant Militias"
EYR_militias_desc:0 "They grumble and complain, but the lowly have an obligation to their betters that is simply unavoidable. It is not exploitation, but rather a continuance of a social contract that has defined relations between griffons since ages past. To arms, peasants, for House Eyrie!"
EYR_defence_plan:0 "To Counter Their Plans"
EYR_defence_plan_desc:0 "The villainous Duke Vincent may be a smart griffon, but he has become predictable. More than that, our natural defenses make our land impenetrable. As long as we follow through our plans, we will not lose a single piece of our land to him."
EYR_holding_fast:0 "Surviving The Onslaught"
EYR_holding_fast_desc:0 "Our soldiers and militias are in position, and our guns are (mostly) in everygriff's talons. Now it's time to hold our ground! We will be victorious against these mutineering rebels!"

E_E_rivalry_eyrie_desc:0 "§gSun-and-Moon,\nonce united and now divided,\nas Eyr weeps for her children.§!\n\nThe bitter feud between the rival houses of Eyrie and Erie - both houses as irreconcilable to each other as the Sun and Moon, day and night - has led to decades of incessant internecine violence between the two heavily militarised houses. Both leaders of the houses claim to be the rightful and legitimate Duke of Verenia, and both of them refuse to negotiate with each other.

EYR_ducal_guard_leader:0 "Roman Eitelkeit"
EYR_ducal_guard_leader_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 12th of July, 963 in Angburg\n§YRank§!: Hauptgreif der Verenianischen Garde\n§YTitle§!: Graf von Angburg\n\n§YBiography§!§L: The Eitelkeits have been a fixture in Verenia since its founding days, and though they've held many influential positions over the years, they always considered themselves to be snubbed by the ruling family. Whether they felt that way out of misplaced pride or genuine contempt, none of them have held the honour of leading the Verenian Guard... until now.\n\nRoman considers himself a very pragmatic griffon. He sees a problem, and solves it in the most efficient way. He has little patience for the Duke's stalling strategy, and he has made that clear on many occasions. Even now, as the Captain of the Guard, he is forced to follow those orders, much to Roman's dismay. If he just could have been in charge when the whole rebellion started, it wouldn't have lasted for more than a year, or so he likes to think.\n\nNonetheless, the Guard-Captain is a capable leader, though not a creative one. His intense drilling standards ensure the common soldier is prepared for anything, who certainly don't need any poncy paladins! Perhaps, if Roman proves himself worthy by overcoming the vile secessionists, there could be a new rising star in Verenia.\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!: Bunnyshrubby"

It is widely believed that Eyr blessed the fields of Verenia, giving them an abundant bounty.\n\nPerhaps Eyr watched over Verena as well, given her unlikely rise to the respectful position of prelate. She never knew her parents, her only relation was a sister that disappeared in the chaos of 978. Subsisting purely on eleos of the local temple, her only comfort in life was dedicating herself to the Triarchy. A good and righteous cause, for in a world full of misery, it was the duty of all griffons to bring comfort to the weary.\n\nHer assignment in Verenia was only meant to be a temporary one, but local conditions made her stay permanent. Time and again, she championed for the cause of peace and reconciliation between the Three Houses, but her pleas and prayers were routinely ignored. Additionally, as the prelature is officially in control of the Paladin Order, many of the local nobility distrust her, believing she's pursuing an agenda of her own. Already a stern and uncompromising griff of the robe, this treatment has steeled Verena's faith further. Only a scant few are righteous enough to pass her test of purity, and woe betide anygriff who end up the target of her admonishing gaze.\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!: Rari"

Could anygriff say they were wrong, given how far she has come? As one of the Duke's most trusted advisors, responsible for every idol in his purse, Freya has considerable leeway to act in the interest of her perfectionist tendencies. If it were her way, Verenia would be richer than Skyfall!\n\nUnfortunately, we all live in an imperfect world, and Freya constantly struggles with keeping the realm fiscally solvent. Whereas others throw money like it grows on trees, and not even on actually useful things, she uses every legal and illegal trick in the book to keep the economy going. Though with few loves in life besides work and fashionable outfits, Freya looks forward to the day when this mess is done with, the idea of a relaxing vacation on some distant island occupying her mind.\n\n§!§YPortrait By§!: Rari"

#### EVENTS

eyrie.1.t:0 "A Brief Recollection Of Events"
eyrie.1.d:0 "I am Iovinus, heir to the Verenian legacy and patriarch of the noble house Eyrie, who have ruled these lands for centuries. For many years, I have been locked in a dynastic dispute with my irresponsible older half-sibling Vincent. How I loathe his irrational, thoughtless behaviour. It was I who should have succeeded to rulership after the horrid republican uprising, which left many family members dead, but he would not concede to the fact that it is House Erie that is subservient to House Eyrie.\n\nNow, there's been little peace, and even less respite. I watched many young and promising griffons march to the riverfront, only to learn that they've perished. It is their duty to serve their liege lord, yes, but I do not wish to throw lives away. None of this should have happened. Lady Amelinda, she helped with her surprising defection, but remained a mystery with her intentions. Her daughter Katrina will have to see reason in the end. It is my Gods given right to rule Verenia, and restore her splendour to how it was.\n\nThe commoners despise us, yet more backlash comes from my supposedly subservient nobles. Instead of wisely digging in, time and again they've wasted our power on futile attacks. Worse still, they distrust the paladins, Verenia's sworn guardians.\n\nThis story has been dragged on for too long. How will it end? Nobody but the Gods know, and they don't talk."

eyrie.333.t:0 "Troubling Behaviour"
eyrie.333.d:0 ""Have you heard what Duke Iovinus did yesterday?" Greta, a scullery maid, spoke to her friend and colleague as they worked together to scrub the hallway's floor.\n\n"No, I was busy with my obligations till late at night. I had no time for listening to gossip." Ingrid retorted, with little joy in her labour.\n\n"Ah, see, I heard about this from the gamekeeper, who heard it from one of the noble's valets. Duke Iovinus and his entourage were having a dinner, the usual stuff us servants never get to see or have, when suddenly, he jumped on the table—"\n\n"Was this griff drunk? Duke Iovinus is a picture of impassivity, it's almost frightening how nothing bothers him."\n\n"No, no, he swore it happened. That the Duke, he climbed on the table, with madness in his eyes as he furiously waved his claws and spread his wings. The poncy nobles were all in shock, listening to their master ramble about 'being the one' and 'ending the cycle of despair'. I couldn't believe it myself until I had it checked with the others."\n\nIngrid was shocked, to say the least. She had no love for her station in life, but the Duke, he was a respectable employer and never did anything wrong, as far as she knew. "And then what?"\n\nGreta waved her claws in a shrugging motion. "His wife dragged him away before he could start throwing the main course. Kicked and screamed to resist, too.""

eyrie.666.t:0 "Where Everything Ends"
eyrie.666.d:0 "The air was cold and still within Iovinus' quarters. Another day spent making difficult decisions, another day spent wrangling with his subordinates, every day a little harder to bear. He had been hanging at the end of his rope, under the weight of anxiety he hid deep beneath a shroud of confidence and bravery. Spending much of the night unable to sleep, thinking about his family, his legacy, his beautiful Verenia. Sitting at his desk, writing a letter intended for his wife, he would finally succumb to his exhaustion.\n\nA quiet creak could be heard, followed by silence.\n\nThe soft noise would be enough to wake him up, but what he saw then exposed just how insignificant he was. A figure stood before him, black as the sky outside and as silent as the room around them. The shrouded griff looked off, almost blurry and unfocused, like it was trying to be multiple things at once. Its presence made the Duke feel warm and peaceful, yet nervous, frightened. It would reach with a long, desiccated arm, opening its claw to Iovinus. He looked at it with confusion, briefly glancing at the figure's face. There was nothing, just a slow nod and a whisper.\n\n"It could be your time."\n\nWhat time? He already spent most of his lifetime wasting under his burdens. If only it would all end already so he didn't have to worry anymore. His mind was telling him to reject anything the figure offered, but... He was so tired of everything."

#### FOCUS

EYR_convene_court:0 "A Meeting In Haste"
EYR_convene_court_desc:0 "Our reliable sources have confirmed what we all dread: Vincent Erie, the self proclaimed Duke of Erie, is preparing a yet another attack against his rightful liege lord. The true lord of Verenia must rally his knights, marshal his defences and prepare his people. House Eyrie does not bow before insurgents and mutineers."
EYR_the_yearly_obligations:0 "Arms, Armour, Idols"
EYR_the_yearly_obligations_desc:0 "Waging war is all about supplies and logistics, for what good is a griffon if he has no weapon or ammunition? Recent events necessitate a forced increase in the production of materiel, all paid for from the Duke's personal treasury. A small investment that pays great dividends for the continued survival."
EYR_what_we_must:0 "In Defence Of Eyrie"
EYR_what_we_must_desc:0 "Soldiers, knights, peasants, merchants, nobles - they all fight for House Eyrie, directly or indirectly. The time is right for them to be placed on high alert, to muster their capabilities, for a storm is coming, and we must all work together in all our capacity to weather it."
EYR_assign_new_commander:0 "The Promising Candidates"
EYR_assign_new_commander_desc:0 "Previous week, the commander of the Ducal Guard passed away in his sleep, presumably spent from a lifetime of dutiful service. While his contributions will not be forgotten, and honoured properly, this leaves a gaping hole in our command structure that must be quickly rectified. There are noble griffons who would love to carry the mantle, but the Duke has his own plans already."
EYR_take_personal_command:0 "Assume Direct Control"
EYR_take_personal_command_desc:0 "Previous week, the commander of the Ducal Guard passed away in his sleep, presumably spent from a lifetime of dutiful service. While his contributions will not be forgotten, and honoured properly, Duke Iovinus has no choice but to personally exert his command over the armies of the Sunlight Shield, until a suitable replacement can be found."
EYR_militias:0 "Peasant Militias"
EYR_militias_desc:0 "They grumble and complain, but the lowly have an obligation to their betters that is simply unavoidable. It is not exploitation, but rather a continuance of a social contract that has defined relations between griffons since ages past. To arms, peasants, for House Eyrie!"
EYR_river_defence:0 "The Reliable Bulwark"
EYR_river_defence_desc:0 "The great river that divides House Eyrie from House Erie has long served as a focal defence point against Vincent's clumsy assaults, though the same could be said when we attempted to capitalise on his weakness and cross it ourselves. Nonetheless, our defensive doctrine relies on its impregnability, even if we are prevented from building larger scale fortifications."
EYR_defence_plan:0 "Surviving The Onslaught"
EYR_defence_plan_desc:0 "It doesn't take a new Arantigos to figure out how to improve our chances against Vincent's rabble, but the newly minted Commander of the Ducal Guard, Roman Eitelkeit, has a few additional strategies in mind. They must be thoroughly discussed and elaborated upon, if their implementation is to become a viability."
EYR_fuck_off_vincent:0 "Those Who Never Falter"
EYR_fuck_off_vincent_desc:0 "Vincent Erie is but a pitiful mongrel, unworthy of even ruling the smallest patch of land, much less proud Verenia herself. For all the might he boasts of, it will inevitably crash against our strongholds, our gallant defenders. The song of war claims Verenia once more, and this time we shall be the victors without uncertainty."

E_E_rivalry_eyrie:0 "War Of Two Houses"
E_E_rivalry_eyrie_desc:0 "§RTwo households, both alike in dignity,\nFrom ancient grudge break to new mutiny,\nWhere civil blood makes civil claws unclean.§!\n§W--------------§!\nThe bitter feud between the rival houses of Eyrie and Erie - both houses as irreconcilable to each other as the Sun and Moon, Day and Night - has led to decades of incessant internecine violence between the two heavily militarised houses. Both leaders of the houses claim to be the rightful and legitimate Dukes of Verenia, and both of them refuse to negotiate with each other. The violence will likely continue until one side proves triumphant."
EYR_maars_blessing:0 "Covenant: Favour Of Maar"

EYR_maars_real_blessing:0 "Bothersome Headache"
EYR_maars_real_blessing_desc:0 "For whatever reason, our esteemed leader is feeling exceptionally distracted lately, and finds it very difficult to focus on the day-to-day obligations of his position. Hopefully, it is a temporary phase."

#### EVENTS

eyrie.1.t:0 "A Brief Recollection Of Events"
eyrie.1.d:0 "I am Iovinus, heir to the Verenian legacy and patriarch of the noble house Eyrie, who have ruled these lands for centuries. For many years, I have been locked in a dynastic dispute with my irresponsible younger half-sibling Vincent. How I loathe his irrational, thoughtless behaviour. It was I who should have succeeded to rulership after the horrid republican uprising, which left many family members dead, but he would not concede to the fact that it is house Erie that is subservient to house Eyrie.\n\nNow, there's been little peace, and even less respite. I watched many young and promising griffons march to the riverfront, only to learn that they've perished. It is their duty to serve their liege lord, yes, but I do not wish to throw lives away. None of this should have happened. Lady Amelinda, she helped with her surprising defection, but remained a mystery with her intentions. She will have to see reason in the end, as well. It is my Gods given right to rule Verenia, and restore her splendour to how it was.\n\nEven less fortunately, the commonfolk despises us, and I cannot blame them. Forced in a struggle they have little sympathy or understanding for, living in fear and uncertainty. I promised to myself to restore their well-being, but for now they must give their all. However, I can count on a few but reliable assortment of griffons in my quest, the most prominent among them being my newly minted commander of the Ducal Guard, Roman. His family carries little prestige, but I see great potential in him. There is also my dear Freya, a graduate from Yale whose economical knowledge carried the day many times, and the inscrutable prelate of Eyr, Verena. She is not on my payroll, and quite frightening, but helps keep the peasants in line a little longer. Amusing, how they fear the divine more than us.\nThis story has been dragged on for too long. How will it end? Nobody but the Gods know, and they don't talk."

eyrie.333.t:0 "Troubling Behaviour"
eyrie.333.d:0 ""Have you heard what Duke Iovinus did yesterday?" Greta, a scullery maid, spoke to her friend and colleague as they worked together to scrub the hallway's floor.\n\n"No, I was busy with my obligations till late at night. I had no time for listening to gossip." Ingrid retorted, with little joy in her labour.\n\n"Ah, see, I heard about this from the gamekeeper, who heard it from one of the noble's valets. Duke Iovinus and his entourage were having a dinner, the usual stuff us servants never get to see or have, when suddenly, he jumped on the table—"\n\n"Was this griff drunk? Duke Iovinus is a picture of impassivity, it's almost frightening how nothing bothers him."\n\n"No, no, he swore it happened. That the Duke, he climbed on the table, with madness in his eyes as he furiously waved his claws and spread his wings. The poncy nobles were all in shock, listening to their master ramble about 'being the one' and 'ending the cycle of despair'. I couldn't believe it myself until I had it checked with the others."\n\nIngrid was shocked, to say the least. She had no love for her station in life, but the Duke, he was a respectable employer and never did anything wrong, as far as she knew. "And then what?"\n\nGreta waved her claws in a shrugging motion. "His wife dragged him away before he could start throwing the main course. Kicked and screamed to resist, too.""
eyrie.333.a:0 "What's gotten into Iovinus?"

eyrie.666.t:0 "Where Everything Ends"
eyrie.666.d:0 "The air was cold and still within Iovinus' quarters. Another day spent making difficult decisions, another day spent wrangling with his subordinates, every day a little harder to bear. He had been hanging at the end of his rope, under the weight of anxiety he hid deep beneath a shroud of confidence and bravery. Spending much of the night unable to sleep, thinking about his family, his legacy, his beautiful Verenia. Sitting at his desk, writing a letter intended for his wife, he would finally succumb to his exhaustion.\n\nA quiet creak could be heard, followed by silence.\n\nThe soft noise would be enough to wake him up, but what he saw then exposed just how insignificant he was. A figure stood before him, black as the sky outside and as silent as the room around them. The shrouded griff looked off, almost blurry and unfocused, like it was trying to be multiple things at once. Its presence made the Duke feel warm and peaceful, yet nervous, frightened. It would reach with a long, desiccated arm, opening its claw to Iovinus. He looked at it with confusion, briefly glancing at the figure's face. There was nothing, just a slow nod and a whisper.\n\n"It could be your time."\n\nWhat time? He already spent most of his lifetime wasting under his burdens. If only it would all end already so he didn't have to worry anymore. His mind was telling him to reject anything the figure offered, but... He was so tired of everything."

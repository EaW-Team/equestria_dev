### FOURTH PATH - SWITZERLAND ###

HEL_the_confederation_of_communities:0 "The Confederation of Communities"
HEL_the_confederation_of_communities_desc:0 "Merlock Wood and the Prelate Luca have charted a course together that would bring democracy and equality to Adelart - the only question is, who will lead their shattered coalition?"

HEL_the_socialist_coalition:0 "Wood Leads the Coalition"
HEL_the_socialist_coalition_desc:0 "The Socialist Coalition have found success in the election with the people proving their faith in the regime. They will now move forward emboldened by the popular mandate."

HEL_social_conservatives:0 "The Prelate Leads the Coalition"
HEL_social_conservatives_desc:0 "The Conservative Eyrite backed faction has won out in the elections. Still believing in many of the liberal republican ideas of the other factions, they will go about their policy with the religious undertones of the old believers."

### FIFTH PATH - OIL REPUBLIC ###

HEL_de_conards_republic:0 "The Oil Republic"
HEL_de_conards_republic_desc:0 "Whether by trickery or legitimate democratic means, Jaume de Conard has found himself at the helm of a new Adelartian Republic. Whether or not he focuses on cementing his own power and pleasing his gracious benefactors in Flowena, or building a democratic Adelart based on the principles of the Aquileian Republicans, is up to him."

HEL_the_social_democrats:0 "Focus on Nation-Building"
HEL_the_social_democrats_desc:0 "#TODO, a more liberal approach"

HEL_the_flowenan_group:0 "Full Control for de Conard"
HEL_the_flowenan_group_desc:0 "#TODO, more plutocratic approach"

HEL_market_war_on_greifwald:0 "Shatter the Crown of Greifwald"
HEL_market_war_on_greifwald_desc:0 "For centuries Adeldart has been trampled by imperial rulers that barely registered our people’s existence. With Merlock Wood and the blood-stained position of ‘sheriff’ out of the picture, the time has come to eliminate the last major vestige of monarchy in the périphérie."

HEL_social_conservatives:0 "The Prelate Leads the Coalition"
HEL_social_conservatives_desc:0 "The Conservative Eyrite backed faction has won out in the elections. Still believing in many of the liberal republican ideas of the other factions, they will go about their policy with the religious undertones of the old believers."


### ARMY GARBAGE ###

HEL_the_six_companies:0 "The Six Free Companies"
HEL_the_six_companies_desc:0 "The Six Free Companies, various mercenary bands, private military companies, holy orders, and revolutionary organizations, founded at various stages in the history of Adelart, make up the backbone of all contingents outside the direct supervision of [HEL.GetLeader]'s personal army. To restore our army to a proper position, we must deal with them, and find out which are worth supporting... and which are not."

HEL_the_fliger_air_corps:0 "The Alois & Joanna Fliger Family Air Corps"
HEL_the_fliger_air_corps_desc:0 "The Fliger Air Corps, founded some time ago in 981 ALB, are a band of Feathisian pilots exiled for smuggling resources on the Flowenan black market. For profit, curiosity, or pity, they have decided to stay in Adelart as the country's only real aerial prescence, which means to control any Adelartian airspace, one must deal with the Fligers and their immense extended family."

HEL_dispersed_air_doctrine:0 "A Real Air Doctrine"
HEL_dispersed_air_doctrine_desc:0 "There is no point in investing in airfields or airplanes if we do not know how to use them. Thus with airfields built and the first Adelart planes in production, we have to establish an Adelartian aerial doctrine."

HEL_integrate_the_militias:0 "Absorb The Militias"
HEL_integrate_the_militias_desc:0 "While we wish our army to remain decentralized we must ensure that all the militias of Adelart can still remain under the army's general control. Therefore, we should begin a new campaign to begin reigning in many of the local militia groups with promises of continued autonomy."

#HEL_the_sisters_of_eyr:0 "Integrate The Sisters Of Eyr"
#HEL_the_sisters_of_eyr_desc:0 "The sisters of Eyr are an... eccentric group. Parading around Adelart in their iron behemoths they enforce the will of the gods on the land. We should make an effort to try to associate them with our military and use their divine strength."

HEL_the_merrimane_column:0 "The Merrimane Column"
HEL_the_merrimane_column_desc:0 "The Merrimane Column, a collection of international socialist revolutionaries from Equestria and left-wing veterans of the First Aquileian Revolution, settled in Adelart at the time of their own revolution in 987 ALB. From then, they have built a reputation as a hub of militant leftism and as a place for volunteers the world over to help build the new Adelart."

HEL_haven_of_socialism:0 "A Haven of Global Socialism"
HEL_haven_of_socialism_desc:0 "Whilst most would shun the idea of granting safe passage and housing to socialist revolutionaries from all across the world, we have no reason to fear these like-minded creatures. [HEL.GetNameDefCap] shall operate as a safe haven and distribution network for our red friends all over the continent and beyond!"

HEL_stalliongradian_tank_models:0 "Stalliongradian Tank Models"
HEL_stalliongradian_tank_models_desc:0 "The revolutionaries in Stalliongrad were the first to develop effective tank designs and have been exporting their designs to the red-tinted world for years. We would do well to adopt and study them for ourselves in order to diversify our armed forces and provide close support to both our regular and irregular forces."

HEL_army_of_aggression:0 "An Army of Aggression"
HEL_army_of_aggression_desc:0 "There is an ancient joke originating from the era of Grover II in which a griffon claims that offence is the best defence, then proceeds to get himself killed in a reckless charge into a well prepared enemy. That poor griff did have a point, however. Proper application of offensive tactics and high levels of autonomy amongst commanders does often lead to strategic success."

HEL_adelartian_international_brigades:0 "Form New International Brigades"
HEL_adelartian_international_brigades_desc:0 "Aside from allowing us to acquire and distribute military experience amongst the armed forces without extensive and expensive training exercises, there is another benefit to a thriving foreign volunteer network. When the time for war comes, many will answer the call to arms to protect themselves and their revolutionary hub."

HEL_to_the_barricades:0 "Chantons la Liberté, Défendons la Cite"
HEL_to_the_barricades_desc:0 "As many revolutionaries are urbanites that knew how to read from a young age, it is no surprise that they are more familiar with city sprawl than most draftees. On the surface this may seem inconsequential, but detailed knowledge of a location makes for better positioning and a superb understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of urban warfare that may prove vital."

HEL_the_jade_company:0 "The Jade Company of Romau"
HEL_the_jade_company_desc:0 "The Jade Company, built in 911 ALB by a dissident Senator of Romau, lack a truly centralized command following the death of the old griff who built it, but make up for it with a fanatic devotion to the Republican cause. Their recruits are many and their power broad, and although they may be particularly brutal in their fight against the monarchists, they would welcome our support with utter devotion."

#HEL_introduce_field_hospitals:0 "Introduce Field Hospitals"
#HEL_introduce_field_hospitals_desc:0 "Field hospitals are by no means a new innovation in warfare but are new to the less organized armies of the world. With this, we should make attempts to integrate these new ideas to try to save as many of the lives of those who would risk giving it up for their nation."

#HEL_introduce_armored_cars:0 "Putting Guns On Cars"
#HEL_introduce_armored_cars_desc:0 "Motorizing warfare has been something experimented on by a few militias in our country since the revolution. We should embrace these for the entirety of our army."

HEL_the_forest_brothers:0 "The Forest Brothers"
HEL_the_forest_brothers_desc:0 "The Forest Brothers, an ancient company founded in 644 ALB, once led by Merlock Wood himself, remains one of the premier forces in the movement for Adelartian independence and national liberation. The company's tactics, however, remain based in banditry and guerilla warfare through their role in the fight against the Sheriff, and they may not be the most... easily disciplined."

HEL_we_need_some_actual_military_tactics_desc:0 "Establishing a new academy to train our officers will make sure that we can draw on a trained office staff if we ever must call upon them to defend their nation."

HEL_what_makes_us_griffons:0 "What Makes Us Griffons"
HEL_what_makes_us_griffons_desc:0 "It will do us no good to mindlessly import tactics of the West or South without any care for the races they are prescribed to. Instead, we must embrace who we are and who Boreas made us to be - free griffons, greedy and self-concieted perhaps, but born to fly and resilient 'til the end."

#HEL_learning_tank_models:0 "Tank Models"
#HEL_learning_tank_models_desc:0 "Tanks are a new generation of warfare that we have many of the resources needed to draw upon, mainly our vast oil reserves. This is a great advantage that we should put to use as much as possible."

HEL_plane_stuff:0 "Black Market Airplane Models"
HEL_plane_stuff_desc:0 "Developing new airplane models to protect our soldiers from the skies will be a great boon to how effectively our military can fight to defend Adelart. Unfortunately, we do not have airplane models. However, the Fligers have pointed out we can easily secure second-rate models on the black market and through their own Feathisian connections - as long as we don't get caught."

HEL_promote_the_fligers:0 "The Fligers in Government"
HEL_promote_the_fligers_desc:0 "We shall appoint Joanna Fliger and her son Alois into the highest positions in government, so that perhaps we can finally have some griffons with aerial expertise within the ranks of Adelart's foremost political and military leaders. If they stick to their trade of the air force, it will be a greatly beneficial partnership indeed."

HEL_fate_of_maarite_militia:0 "The Seventh Company"
HEL_fate_of_maarite_militia_desc:0 "A bizarre militia known as the "Schwarze Krallen", or Black Talons, has risen in the darkest forests of Adelart, bearing the name of the great bandit leader Blacktalon from when Adelart was still an independent state. Our sources suggest this organization could possibly be Maarite in nature, but they could be loyal allies should we ever decide to utilize them."

HEL_an_army_worthy_of_the_revolution:0 "An Army Worthy Of Adelart"
HEL_an_army_worthy_of_the_revolution_desc:0 "Our forces now are worthy of our great nation! Our revolution is secured now and forever by this shield! A testatment to the power and ingenuity of Adelart for all of Griffonia to see!"

#Democratic Decentralization Path

HEL_switzerland:0 "The Federal Council of Adelart"
HEL_switzerland_desc:0 "While direct democracy does provide our populace the most fair and equal way of participating in the governance of the state, certain examples of direct democracy across Griffonia have shown the problems such a system causes it's relied upon too much. Therefore a federal council will be established in order to take care of issues that are too minor for the entire populace of Adelart to consider."

HEL_gun_rights:0 "A Gun For Every Griffon"
HEL_gun_rights_desc:0 "20 years ago the griffons of Adelart declared independence from the Greifwald tyrants in a popular uprising. Even now the overlords of Greifwald look at us with hunger in their eyes. If our democracy is to survive, the populace must be armed and ready to defend their liberty and rights."

HEL_gun_rights_anarchist:0 "Armed to the Beak"
HEL_gun_rights_anarchist_desc:0 "20 years ago the griffons of Adelart declared independence from the Greifwald tyrants in a popular uprising. Even now the overlords of Greifwald look at us with hunger in their eyes. If our democracy is to survive, the populace must be armed and ready to defend their liberty and rights."

HEL_support_the_old_believers:0 "Autonomy for the Temples"
HEL_support_the_old_believers_desc:0 "The majority of the population of Adelart is comprised of highly religious griffons. While we already support the religious communities within our country, they are somewhat neutral towards our government. This is why we will increase support to the religious communities in order to become friends with them."

HEL_decentralized_education:0 "Autonomy for the Teachers"
HEL_decentralized_education_desc:0 "For a democratic, especially directly democratic, system to work, the populace needs to be knowledgeable enough to realize what is best for them. This is why we must ensure that every griffon in Adelart has the ability to achieve higher education, even if it's in somewhat unorthodox methods."

#Democratic Centralization Path

HEL_a_centralized_democracy:0 "End Decentralization"
HEL_a_centralized_democracy_desc:0 "Direct deomcracy worked twenty years ago, but it has shown its constraints over the last two decades. We must consolidate the will of the people into a federal entity! Checks and balances will be put in place, but our government must be able to act faster than a referendum."

HEL_a_powerful_executive:0 "A True President"
HEL_a_powerful_executive_desc:0 "The office of the Speaker has never been more then a way to honor our country's father in Merlock Wood. As we establish our centralized government, we need a Speaker that can ensure it is just. Granting the office new executive power will enable us to react faster to new threats from outside and within."

HEL_polizei:0 "De Geheimdéngscht"
HEL_polizei_desc:0 "Our citizens deserve the right to a local security force, but across our territories we need a fair entity to enforce our nation's laws that is not limited by county lines. De Geheimdéngscht will centralize our intelligence assets and exercise lawful jurisdiction across all of our territories."

HEL_a_real_university:0 "The Adelartian Meritocracy"
HEL_a_real_university_desc:0 "With greater control of all our government's assets, we are able to put forward generous subsidies to attract academics to Adelart. With the best and brightest in Griffonia coming to support us, it is only right we construct a meritocratic strcture worthy of Adelart's future leaders."

#HEL_centralize_the_church:0 "Religious Centralization"
#HEL_centralize_the_church_desc:0 "There are many different congregations of Eyr in our lands. It is the idea of a madgriffon to simply let each have their own special permissions within Adelart. With that, we will classify the faiths into the largest demoninations. This is only for bureaucratic purposes, of course."


#Democratic Eyrist-Conservative Path

HEL_agrarianism_focus:0 "Safeguard Rural Traditionalism"
HEL_agrarianism_focus_desc:0 "The majority of our population may reside in urban centers, but the true heart of Adelart is found outside of the cities. We must appeal to these rural masses for support. By changing the way that votes are weighed by county we can grant them a louder voice in government."

HEL_eyrite_values:0 "Temperance, Diligence, Community"
HEL_eyrite_values_desc:0 "Liquor, drugs, and other social vices will not be tolerated in our new Adelart. In an effort to curb poverty, our government shall make initiatives to grant local citizen councils the power to ensure their own piety and foster community consciousness in our nation."

HEL_encourage_large_families:0 "Eyrite Family Laws"
HEL_encourage_large_families_desc:0 "It is only in recent years that Adelart has passed a million griffons in its territory. As our standard of living inscreases, our birthrate goes down. Therefore, we must make it appealing and beneficial to have a large family by offering subsidies and tax cuts."

HEL_eyrian_charity:0 "Bread, Rice, and Idols"
HEL_eyrian_charity_desc:0 "We cannot afford to forget our most destitute in these trying times. The church shall use its vast influence in Adelart to provide charity to those in need, all of which will be subsidized and supported by the current administration."

HEL_subsidize_the_farms:0 "Peasants into Farmers"
HEL_subsidize_the_farms_desc:0 "It is time that we return to our roots, quite literally. Although we have liberated our people from serfdom in the past, our farmers are antiquated compared to our neighbors. We must modernize our farms and give our farmers the tools to grow past their peasant pastures."

HEL_social_funds:0 "A Social Fund"
HEL_social_funds_desc:0 "The church's charity can only go so far. A Social Fund must be set up for our poorer communities that are suffering in this time of change. Well-timed and modest grants will empower local entities to solve their own problems effectively at the ground level."

HEL_a_better_figurehead:0 "Recall Merlock Wood"
HEL_a_better_figurehead_desc:0 "Merlock Wood is a hero to our people, despite his connections to the socialists. While we cannot persecute him for his political escapades, we can recall him from service and grant him a hero's retirement; effectively removing him from any real power."

HEL_nurture_new_business:0 "Our Own Industry"
HEL_nurture_new_business_desc:0 "A free market of a free territory must be regulated, however this means we also have a responsibility to support new business in our lands. By offering grants to key industries, we can support the new businesses that arises around them."

HEL_revolutionary_spirit:0 "Teach the World Our Name"

HEL_real_healthcare:0 "Private Healthcare Services"

HEL_a_free_and_modern_adelart:0 "Governance for the Future"
HEL_a_free_and_modern_adelart_desc:0 "Our reforms are already bearing fruit, the future of Adelart is not one of tyranny or anarchy. We look upon her now with solemn pride, for she is a nation that protects, educates, and nutures its people. We are not a territory, a mob of forest bandits with ideals; but a republic of free griffons."

### Democratic Commie Path ### 

HEL_encourage_communal_lifestyles:0 "One Big Community"
HEL_encourage_communal_lifestyles_desc:0 "There are many small towns and villages that are scattered across the forests of Adelart. Many of them are suffer from grave issues which our government is simply unable to help them with due to the libertarian nature of our country. Thus we will enable these towns to administer self-governance through a communal system at a local level."

HEL_distance_from_extremism:0 "Purge Iliberal Socialists"
HEL_distance_from_extremism_desc:0 "While Adelart has been accused of being radicals and lunatics by many foreigners, these claims are mostly absurd and laughable. However, even some in our own country correctly remind us there are more extreme elements among us. In order to ensure the safety and longevity of our nation, we must root them out."

HEL_eyrian_socialism:0 "Socialism Through Eyr"
HEL_eyrian_socialism_desc:0 "The griffons of Adelart, be they from the rural or the urban environment, are highly religious. To them there is no animosity to the divine or its speakers, unlike many other socialist philosophies. Our ways are simply not based on the material realm, but inspired by that which is divine - faith in the Goddess Eyr."

HEL_left_nationalism:0 "Left-Wing Nationalism"
HEL_left_nationalism_desc:0 "Adelart is and will hopefully always will be a realm of socialist workers and farmers. However, differently from most socialist workers, the griffons of Adelart do not see themselves as part of some international group. Rather they choose to still identify with the Adelartian culture. This has been our strength in previous struggles and hopefully will be our strength in future ones."

HEL_socialism_with_adelartian_characteristics:0 "The Collectives and Councils"
HEL_socialism_with_adelartian_characteristics_desc:0 "While we move to establish more traditional collectives within Adelart, we cannot forget the characteristics of our people.

HEL_wealth_for_the_workers:0 "Wealth for the Workers!"
HEL_wealth_for_the_workers_desc:0 "While the workers of Adelart are free from Greifwaldian oppression, many of them still suffer from poverty and the problems that it causes.

HEL_the_first_unions:0 "The First Unions"
HEL_the_first_unions_desc:0 "Adelart has never been an industrialized region. And without industry there was never a need for unions among the inhabitants of Adelart before the revolution.

HEL_hoist_the_green_and_red_desc:0 "Hoist the red and green, brothers and sisters!

HEL_an_end_to_wood_desc:0 "Merlock Wood and his socialist thugs have plauged our country for twenty years. We once thought him as a liberator, but now we see the danger. If we allow him and his ideology to persist we will fall into ruin. For the good of Adelart and our interests, Merlock Wood will be neutralized."

HEL_abolish_the_congress:0 "No More Congresses"
HEL_abolish_the_congress_desc:0 "The congresses were designed to give the people a voice, but they are a shrill chorus ruled by a mob mentality. The representatives the people choose are fickle, dependent on pleasing those who elected them. They are incapable of seeing the bigger picture for our country."

HEL_a_new_chamber:0 "A New Chamber"
HEL_a_new_chamber_desc:0 "We will salvage the useful assets from the congresses, but more importantly we shall impose a new chamber. Some might call it an oligrachy, but by limiting the number of representatives and granting them greater power we can create a more unified front to envision our future."

HEL_remove_old_believer_broadcasts:0 "Silence Them Completely"
HEL_remove_old_believer_broadcasts_desc:0 "Luca vun Lissay and their Old Believers would be useful allies in the fight against socialist ideology, but their penchant for needless charity stirs the pot. We cannot allow the church to hold a great deal of influence among the common people. We will censor their broadcasts or silence them entirely."

HEL_a_haven_for_business:0 "A Haven for Foreign Development"
HEL_a_haven_for_business_desc:0 "Our opponents that used to sit on the left side of the aisle painted Adelart as a haven for the working griffon, but that is not profitable. What can be done is the lowering of corporate taxes and deregulation of labor laws. Through these reforms we shall make Adelart a capitalist's dream!"

HEL_friends_in_flowena:0 "Further Ties With Flowena"
HEL_friends_in_flowena_desc:0 "The banks of Flowena are deep and their coffers are full. Because our regions are close with one another, it is only a logical step to have our business interests close with them as well. With a few generous trade agreements and concessions, we can get a claw in the door where we have not before."

HEL_sell_off_the_collectives:0 "Sell Off The Collectives"
HEL_sell_off_the_collectives_desc:0 "The one useful thing that the communists did for Adelart was consolidating all of the land into collectives for us. Now that we are in control, we can sell these collectives back to their original owners or their competition with a healthy profit."

HEL_a_new_banking_capital:0 "Governance of the Idol"
HEL_a_new_banking_capital_desc:0 "Through careful economic and political manipulation, we have created a captalistic paradise that rivals our friends in Flowena and outshines even the oligarchs of the Skyfall Federation. For only in Adelart are all griffons equal under the idol!"

### Capitalist Industry Tree ###

HEL_capitalism_in_adelart:0 "A Real Economy for the Republic"
HEL_capitalism_in_adelart_desc:0 "We are a backwater cesspool of industry, but we have the capability for so much more. We will have to realize our potential for industrial expansion and growth, which means that we have to embrace the values of a free market head on with open arms."

HEL_store_their_gold:0 "Storing Griffonia's Gold"
HEL_store_their_gold_desc:0 "To say that there is conflict brewing on the continent is an understatement of the century. It does not take a seer to understand that even in traditional banking cities there is unrest, so we will offer a non-traditional option to investors. The banks of Adelart will offer fair premiums and high interests with the promise of stability and security."

HEL_send_out_the_invitations:0 "Invite The Investors"
HEL_send_out_the_invitations_desc:0 "Jaume De Conard's contacts in Flowena will allow us to reach potential investors that might be wary of the banking city's...reputation. A few promises here about access to Lissay's oilfields, a few promises there about having some institutions named in their honor, and a 'no-questions-asked' policy about the origin of the money should attract many wealthy griffons."

HEL_industrialize_the_sites:0 "Industrialize The Sites"
HEL_industrialize_the_sites_desc:0 "What few exisiting industrial sites we have need to be modernized before we attempt expanding upon them. We will have to arrange several deals in order to secure new machines, trucks, and a more skilled labor pool. This might mean we have to cut a deal or two with the unions, but at the heart of capitalism is compromise."

HEL_the_great_conard_bank:0 "The Grand Bank of Conard"
HEL_the_great_conard_bank_desc:0 "Our efforts in attracting investors has not gone unnoticed, and now, the opening of the Grand Bank shall soon commence. While loans from Flowena and Skyfall may be seen as higher quality, it is clear that our unscrupulous methods and tolerance of seedy investors will provide a lucrative loan market in Adelart."

HEL_chop_down_the_forests:0 "Chop Down The Forests"
HEL_chop_down_the_forests_desc:0 "In an age of steel, iron, and oil there is often the griffon who forgets the importance of the humble tree. We will need the additional timber for new houses, papermills, and other industries that require vast quantities of wood. In addition, clearing out some of the forests will make room for new factories and infrastructure."

HEL_research_stuff:0 "The Jan Roycen School of Commerce"
HEL_research_stuff_desc:0 "A smarter work force will generate smarter ideas, and what better way to instill the glorious ideas of opportunity, free thought, and economic progress than our very own business school! Jan Roycen, the former bandit leader of Adelart preceding our very own Merlock Wood, will truly enter into history through the great school of learning that shall bear his name!"

HEL_literacy_for_all:0 "Open the Trade Schools"
HEL_literacy_for_all_desc:0 "As we expand industry we will also need an educated population to meet the positions that will inevitably open up overtime. Engineers to craft new machines, scientists to develop new medicine, and bankers to figure out how to sell it all. It is with this foresight that we further invest in our public education, so that the best and brightest can turn a profit in the future."

HEL_into_the_factories:0 "Into The Factories"
HEL_into_the_factories_desc:0 "Not every griffon is destinited to be a soldier, a farmer, or a priest. With the expansion of factories in urban areas, we will start a campaign to bring farmers and their families into the cities to work at these industrial sites. By subsidizing housing and coordinating with industry leaders, we will make it very appealing to relocate."

HEL_tax_breaks_for_industry:0 "Tax Breaks For Industry"
HEL_tax_breaks_for_industry_desc:0 "As we try to stimulate rapid economic growth and expansion, temporary tax breaks with a ten year lifespan shall encourage businesses to invest and invest quickly to reap the most profit. This should stimulate industry for the next decade and sustain our growth."

HEL_new_taxes:0 "Taxes, Taxes, Taxes"
HEL_new_taxes_desc:0 "A five percent income tax on our poorest griffon and our richest griffon is widely different a sum of idols. Squeezing every idol out of our poor makes little sense, a comprehensive tax reform that shifts based upon annual income shall be a fair way forward. There might be some grumbling from our wealthiest citizens, but a fair tax is better than another socialist revolt."

HEL_bring_adelart_into_the_modern_age:0 "Backwater No Longer"
HEL_bring_adelart_into_the_modern_age_desc:0 "One only has to look out a window to see the fruits of our labors. Cars roll down paved roads and street lights cut through the darkness. The hum of industry is heard all hours of the day, the oil fields of Lissay flow with black gold, and the banks are overflowing with Idols. We have entered into the modern age with the means to enjoy it."

HEL_jacob_oil_1:0 "Exploiting Our Oil Reserves"
HEL_jacob_oil_1_desc:0 "Black gold, it is called, and gold it is, for Adelartian oil reserves will make our government more money than any tax policy could ever accomplish. However, to expolit our oil reserves, we must secure them, and establish mines and refineries across the entirety of the country. Such a policy will employ our own workers and fill our own pockets."

HEL_jacob_oil_2:0 "The Great Oil Trade"
HEL_jacob_oil_2_desc:0 "All of Griffonia begs for Adelartian oil, and we shall answer them!\nBy building up our infrastructure and establishing new trade policies, we can truly build up the supply for Griffonia's hungry bureaucrats and politicians to expolit the resources of Adelart. As more and more oil flows through Griffonia, more and more money will come to Adelart."

HEL_jacob_oil_3:0 "Oil Barons In Government"
HEL_jacob_oil_3_desc:0 "If the great oil reserves of Lissay and Eagleton are to become the centerpiece of our new economy, why should the owners of that land not be involved in our new government? New ministers must be appointed from among the boards of our new corporations, so that we can work claw in claw with such valuable citizens."

HEL_the_adelartian_system:0 "Children of the Forest"
HEL_the_adelartian_system_desc:0 "If you're building for the future, you need to keep your foundations strong. Such has always been the goal of Merlock Wood ever since Adelart was created, and among those great foundations is a certain spirit of community that can only truly function in a society where the farms and forests that made Adelart what it is can prosper and grow unharmed."

HEL_religious_values:0 "Bulwark of the Old Faith"
HEL_religious_values_desc:0 "For more than twenty years now, Adelart has remained free under the guidance of faith and the strength of our common bonds. With the whole world racked by turmoil, war, and poverty, we must be as viligant as ever in facing our threats and protecting our homeland, so that the dream of an Eyrite future shall never perish."

### Agrarian Economics ###
HEL_agrarian_economics_start:0 "An Economy For All Of Us"
HEL_agrarian_economics_start_desc:0 "The sole purpose of an economy is not for profit and modernization - it is for self-actualization and common purpose. Encouraging that our agricultural values are kept intact and continuing our principles of worker's self-management will surely lead to a careful but effective transition into the modern world."

HEL_limited_urbanization:0 "Limited Urbanization"
HEL_limited_urbanization_desc:0 "We must carefully encourage excess agrarian workers to migrate to the cities, but we cannot blindly bring them in enmasse! A reckless approach like that would lead to overcrowding and poverty. We will instead arrange a limit-based system where agrarian workers are slowly transitioned into their new urban enviorment."

HEL_electricity_for_the_forests:0 "Electricity For The Forests"
HEL_electricity_for_the_forests_desc:0 "As we expand the electrical grid of Adelart from our cities, we must also not neglect our brothers and sisters in the forest. Although it may be costly to bring the powerlines into heavily wooded areas, we will do what we must to ensure everyone in our nation has access to electricity."

HEL_expand_urban_collectives_desc:0 "Factories and urban enviorments are much like our collectives out in the rural areas. It is not far-fetched to negotiate a similar arrangement within the cities, by pooling all of our nations resources together we can craft an economy that cares for all within it."

HEL_gradual_industrialization:0 "Gradual Industrialization"
HEL_gradual_industrialization_desc:0 "Rapid industrialization almost always seems to lead to suffering, but it is not something to scorn either. We will take a more moderate path. By industrializing at a modest rate with sound goals and checks, we can ensure a modern economy without the cost of an easily avoidable famine."

HEL_support_rural_schooling:0 "Support Rural Schooling"
HEL_support_rural_schooling_desc:0 "A child has as much to learn in the schoolhouse as they do on the farm. We will offer better pay for rural teachers and grant more supplies to their schools in hopes of improving the academic standards outside of the cities."

HEL_repurpose_the_temples_desc:0 "There is little sense in letting the unfortunate scientific minds that were made to serve Greifwald be put to waste. We will offer pardons and forgiveness to those that are willing to work with us to build a brighter tomorrow!"

HEL_agriculture_as_our_backbone:0 "Agriculture As Our Backbone"

HEL_connect_adelart:0 "Connect The Nation"
HEL_connect_adelart_desc:0 "As Adelart grows, so too does its need for reliable transportation. We will expand our existing railways and roads in order to connect all major cities and towns to each other. With this expansion we will truly be a connected nation!"



HEL_continue_land_reform:0 "Continue Land Reform"
HEL_continue_land_reform_desc:0 "To think that land reform itself will bring about an equitable system? That is misguided. To deny the power of reform though? That is foolish. We will continue our efforts with fair and measured reform, distributing estates that no longer have heirs or tracts of land that used to be untenable without modern equipment."

HEL_encourage_arts_and_theatre:0 "Promote The Arts"
HEL_encourage_arts_and_theatre_desc:0 "A society's culture is its voice and its legacy, so we will ensure that our arts will be supported with copious grants dedicated to them. Adelart, in a few years, will be known as a rich center of the arts with its own unique culture!"

HEL_support_workers_self_management:0 "A Say For Every Worker"
HEL_support_workers_self_management_desc:0 "To ensure that factories are run fairly at the lowest levels we will pass into law requirements that middle-management is elected by the workers themselves. There will be an adjustment period, but it is the way forward to ensure that every worker has a voice."

HEL_oil_agrarian:0 "Dig Shallow And Carefully"
HEL_oil_agrarian_desc:0 "For years we have known of Adelart's riches beneath the ground, but if we exploit the oil for profit alone we endanger ourselves. We listen to our scientists, oil is a finite resource. We will extract it at a measured pace to bolster our economy, but not make our economy reliant upon it."

Through a system of communal representation and popular assembly (think, perhaps, a primitive version of the anarchist Nabat, or the Regional Congress of Peasants, Workers and Insurgents, in Makhno's Ukraine, but with the flavor of merry griffons instead of dreary anarchists), everyone in Adelart will be allowed to have their say and determine the nation's future - tension for the war with Greifwald, though, lies thick in the air."
adelart.1.a:0 "Times have changed in Adelart, but we merry griffs endure."

adelart.2.t:0 "Twenty Hours of Argument"
adelart.2.d:0 "#TODO, The first argument among communal delegations emerges, as those coming to Bergelun on behalf of the Old Believers and the Prelate feud with PAT exiles from Aquileia and other such vanguardists and idealistic revolutionaries under the command of Alexandra Descieux. Wood, understanding either faction would give him the power to pass orders against the other, decides to assemble the delegates together for a moeeting - and fast."
adelart.2.a:0 "Can't we all just get along?!?!?"

adelart.3.t:0 "Descieux's Polemic"
adelart.3.d:0 "#TODO, Alexandra Descieux herself, the firebrand young Aquileian revolutionary, goes to see Merlock, along with a score of her bodyguards. The discussion is decidely more hostile, with Descieux accusing Merlock and his followers of being upjumped bandits collaborating with capitalists and the church to build a movement that bears no resemblance to socialism - she demands centralization into a workers republic after the war with greifwald and an end to bandits and merc groups participating in the congresses, along with other socialist demands like actual collectivisation, etc."
adelart.3.a:0 "Promise proper centralisation will begin soon."
adelart.3.b:0 "Promise to reign the bandits in, but refuse centralisation."

adelart.4.d:0 "#TODO, Instead of hot-tempered old believer militias and zealots, it is instead the ancient prelate Luca that goes to see Merlock. They reconnect, and the Prelate reveals concerns about the "Going to the Griffons" movement, where PAT operatives are attempting to stir anti-clerical and pro-communist dissent (based on the Going to the People movement irl) - he believes this is counter to the democratic processes they have built and the self-determination of the temples"

He critiques both the church and the communists and says Wood that he will gladly faciliate a true democratic transition and arrange international legitimacy for the Forest Brothers - with a few deals from his good friends in Flowena. Claiming to hold a large amount of money and stores, he offers to build up industry with flowenan loans and part of his own money and that of the reform faction - as long as a republic arrives... and Flowena is paid from Wood's own coffers."

Merlock is exasperated, he's out of his depth as no longer just a unifying bandit leader, and the prelate is now screaming at him instead of by his side - now, here come all the petitions..."
adelart.6.a:0 "Send them all in..."

adelart.7.t:0 "Partisan Divisions Disbanded"
adelart.7.d:0 "#TODO, Aquileian exiles and other such communist rabble-rousers who are attempting to place themselves on the same level as Wood and his bandit armies have their divisions disbanded - they will either integrate into Wood and the good Prelate's chain of command or go back to their ruined homes in Aquileia!"

adelart.10.a:0 "Well, we didn't take all those loans for nothing..." #(We will ask the flowenans for help)

adelart.19.t:0 "A Bright Day in Adelart"
adelart.19.d:0 "The day was peaceful, and the forest birds sang as the sun rose on the law's victory. The Sherif of Adelart sat content. Thumbing through some paperwork, he saw reports of Woodests all across the land being culled by this restoration. The violent tendencies of revolutionaries would be wiped away, and peace would come to the forests. Now began the work of administration, and all shall return to as it was before that Anarchist Wood ever tainted this land.\n\nThen, a knock came upon the Sheriff's door. Putting down his quill and parchment, Nottemagne opened the door. A nervous page sat waiting for him outside the door, "Sherif, sir, you have a priest here to see you." he seemed squeamish as he spoke the frantic words. "But it's not just that..."\n\nNottemagne laughed and pushed the page to the side, "Ah, yes! The servants of the gods are here to thank me for removing that dirty criminal from their lands!" the Sheriff spoke with bravado, "And I am sure whatever surprise they have waiting for me will surely be a great one!" The Sherif was happy. He had always been faithful to Boreas above, removing the godless communists and doing his service to the rightful prelate of Griefwald. Now all his hard work was coming back to repay him.\n\nMoving down the hallways of his office in Eagleton, grabbing his wide-brimmed hat along the way, he noticed most of the usual staff did not seem to be there. It must be Saturday he presumed, and moved along. Though as he neared the door, he began to hear an ominous chanting from outside, a rhythmic droning that rattled his skull and shook his mind. Pushing through, he exited the building and suddenly stopped, digging his talons into the floor, he tried to stammer out words but could not. In front of him stood rows and rows of griffons in the robes of peasants and religious orders lined up with various relics and tomes in their hands, chanting in unison prayers and hymns unknown to the Archons in Griffenheim, or the Sheriff's ears. But most frightening of all, what shocked the usually steely griffon the most, where he met his match, was the behemoth of steel that sat in the middle of the field. And stepping to the top, a griffon dressed in the cloth of a peasant man holding an ancient reliquary.\n\n"Godless demon of Adelart! You defile the people's right and bend before the corrupters of the gods! You rob us of our belief, and so we rob you of your power and your life! The true believers shall have a home once more in these sacred forests! For Boreas, who leads us, Eyr, who feeds us, and Arcturus, who sends you to damnation!"\n\nWith this, the Sherif felt a sharpness on his back. Turning around, he saw Sister Selena, leader of the sisters of Eyr, with a blade on the back of his neck. "By the will of the gods, you are dethroned Sherif."\n\n"Because Eyr has come to Adelart.""

adelart.29.d:0 "While Merlook Wood and his comrades strive to maintain a decentralized system of governance where every griffon can truly decide how to live in this socialist society by themselves, not all prominent, allegedly, socialist ideologues and local figures within the borders of Adelart maintain the same mentality. These so called “Vanguardists” cast a shadow across the country, trying to convince the workers and farmers of Adelart that a strong socialist state is needed to create a true utopia of the lower classes. These extremist madmen desire to turn Adelart into but another Stalliongrad or Prywhen, a shackled state, even if robed in red.\n\nWhile these agitators and extremists were initially willing to seek a compromise with more anarchist and libertarian elements within the movement which would lead to the independence of Adelart and has now coalesced into the socialist coalition, and even helped with the original rebellion against the tyrant sheriff and his Greifwaldian overlords, this has changed. While some claim that the actions of these vanguardists, even if somewhat widespread, wouldn’t have any effect on the country and it’s inhabitants. After all they didn’t have the effect in the last few decades, so what would change now? However, Merlook Wood is unwilling to just allow this to continue, especially now that these extremists are far more prominent and even willing to criticize the current system as “betrayal of the socialist ideal” and the ruling coalition.\n\nThus, even with heavy heart, the Woodists drove the statist extremists out of any and all leadership positions, and even in some cases, pushed them out beyond the borders of Adelart with force of arms."

adelart.30.t:0 "The Principle of Left Nationalism"
adelart.30.d:0 "While many other socialist thinkers and leaders believed and promoted the idea that the working class does not have a nation. They claimed that nations are but arbitrary constructs, yet another symptom of the eternal conflict between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. However, the hero of the Adelartian revolution and war of independence, Merlock Wood, does not hold the same opinion. After all socialism was an Equestrian ideology in origin, created in a realm where most citizens perceived themselves as part of a whole, a single realm forged millenniums ago. Griffonia and the kingdoms and empires that rose were forged through violence, subjugation and even in many cases destruction of languages and cultures.\n\nWith such historical circumstances it would seem truly absurd for griffon socialists to desire to abandon their culture, language and in many cases faith. After all in Griffonia, it’s the bourgeoisie that seek such destruction, while the proletariat, the farmers and workers, desire to maintain these ties. Thus it could be argued, and Merlock Wood and his allies do, that in the context of Griffonia, nationalism isn’t a symbol of radical right, rather it can also be the symbol of the workers liberation. After all it was this cultural association, together with the old believer faith that, based on which the workers of Adelart were so ready to mobilize against the oppressors from Greifwald.\n\nFurthermore, while most socialists are heavily utopian in their beliefs and think that some sort of hypothetical continental or even world socialist republic would be equal in fair to all, we are sceptical of such outcomes. After all, without any differentiation or inner borders, does that not mean that even in a socialist state, richer and more developed regions would simply dominate the lesser ones?"

Although he was succeeded by two daughters, none took up his family name, and soon after his death, his home was sold off to the local peasant assembly to become cooperative housing for the small town's urban residents. His funeral was attended only by his closest friends and the rare government minister who had taken an interest in Adelart's heirs,at one point in history asking Wood to re-instate the Sweetsingers for nationalistic and politcial gain.\n\nWith Leonald's death, whatever remained of centuries-old monarchist groups in Adelart has dissapated, and vanguardists have taken the event to be a sign that monarchists will soon serve the sheriff and Greifwaldian exile groups, ordering Wood to take action and drive the sheriff's supporters from Adelart.\n\nAlthough Leonald's death was sadly politicized by the Congress of People and Peasants, it was a bitter end for a dynasty that had longed to rule Adelart again for hundreds of years. Now, the Sweetsingers will be ruling no county, and the dynasty that went from counts to peasants has finally ended."

adelart_flavor.2.d:0 "Controversy has emerged in a small forest town outside Herlein on the Greifenmarscher border, where an investigation over sounds of disturbing melodies and perpetual revelery led to the uncovering of a bizarre pacifist and envionmentalist religious sect that has taken to worshipping a griffonian forest deity, Fichtl. Worship of the forest deity, questioned revelers claim, was a centuries old tradition among the isolated peasants, which many claim predated the establishment of the Trinitarian faith all together. Effigies of Fichtl, a tree with a Griffonian face upon it, have been found all across the forest towns, hand-crafted, woven, and stuffed by local artisans, while local bards sing the songs of the faith to adoring crowds.\n\nOutraged Old Believer authorities have labeled the movement heresy and idolatry, and a local priest noted that the effigies of the god were "unsettling to the point where I thought a Maarite spirit had brought such disgust and rancor upon my soul". The local council leader claims that the festivals were all "in good fun" and that mobs of Old Believer followers were making a fuss over a centuries-old tradition. Fichtlites interviewed merely claimed the festivals were a way to "appreciate the bounty of Fichtl and call attention to the lovely environment we all share, and which is being destroyed by the march of industry", and that the childish effigies were not meant to be taken seriously.\n\nWith the Old Believers and community leaders at odds, it falls to [Root.Getleader] to determine the fate of this obscure festival. The question is - could these festivals be merely be cover stories for heresy?"

Appointing himself Venia III, rightful Archon of Eyr, Luca has made calls to the global community to stand against the decadence of the Archons and their imperial masters, rallying behind the banner of the true Archon of Eyr to bring a new religious awakening of community, faith, and temperance. Striving for "a reformation of the Griffonian faith", the Prophet of Eyr, as his supporters call him, has developed a dangerous movement - one that might see more and more griffons come under its sway."

###LEADERS###

jacob_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of April, 974 in Conard\n\n§YBiography§!: Jaume de Conard was 6 when the Adelartian Revolution broke out, and the bonds that tied them to the ancient monarchy of Greifwald were forever broken. But to think that Jaume ever stayed in Adelart with its new collectivist government in power would be wildly incorrect. His family, mostly capitalists loyal to the County of Greifwald, moved to Flowena, at that point suffering from its own declaration of independence from Pomovarra. De Conard, a quick learner and ruthless capitalist, soon rose through the ranks of Flowena's school system, graduating with a degree in economics.\n\nAfter his brief stint in Flowena, De Conard soon moved to Conard, in Adelart, his old home, where he campaigned for the end of the "peasant's government" of Merlock Wood and the fall of "tyrannical collectivism". Soon, De Conard helped to found the Conard Academy Of Arts And Sciences, and took a brief job as a designer for the Adelartian army, creating budget versions of Imperial tanks, but none of his jobs truly spoke to him.\n\nIn 1003, blessed with a unique opportunity, De Conard began talks with the Flowenan government about a possible takeover in Adelart - to ensure that the vast oil reserves of the Lissay were entrusted to loyal and hard-working griffons. While Flowena pulled the strings behind Adelart's new democratic reforms, unbeknownst to even the government, De Conard watched and waited until his time to strike - and now, Adelart is his.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Kessel"
merlock_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 11th of May, 959 in Bergelun\n\n§YBiography§!: Merlock Wood is called many things. Traitor, bandit, murderer, hero, protector - but none can deny that he is a revolutionary above all. Wood started his revolutionary career as a little-known partisan of the First Adelartian Revolution of 983, when Jan Roycen, a famed outlaw, first inspired the people of Adelart to break the shackles of both Greifwalder and Aquileian rule, and establish a free independent territory. After Roycen found his rebellion crushed and himself beheaded, Wood took up the torch of the Adelartian revolutionaries, restructuring them among collectivist and fiercely anti-monarchist lines, with the promise of redistribution of wealth for the people and justice upon the corrupt nobles in each and every town they conquered.\n\nGreifwald, controlled by a weak and inefficient count, was beset by an Adelartian revolution that gained most of their strongholds peacefully through the people's will, with Wood's revolutionary ideals at its helm. The Sheriff, Willam Wendenal, failed to quell the revolt, with his own trusted griffons betraying him for the promise of wealth and freedom. He was beheaded soon after, and replaced by Jean de Nottemagne, who reluctantly fled Adelart for good.\n\nMerlock began to re-organize the government upon libertarian, collectivist, and populist lines, with particular fury directed toward the Archonates and the Prelature of Greifwald, who suffered massive reprisals and murders at the hand of Wood's guerrilla armies. Fiercely anti-authoritarian attitudes among the revolutionaries, along with a hatred of what they believed was Maarite corruption in the church, led to Wood embracing the Old Believers, a fringe religious sect, and shaking hands with the new "Elected Prelate", Luca vun Lissay.\n\nWhile Wood has ruled for 20 years with relative stability, the people are growing restless. Hardliners clamour for Wood's removal and trial for banditry and mass murder and the establishment of true socialism, while moderates call for the end of the revolutionary period and the establishment of real democracy. If Wood is to stay, only time will tell.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
luca_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of December, 928 in Lissay\n\n§YBiography§!: The origins of Luca vun Lissay, leader of the Old Believers in Adelart and devout theologian, are a mystery to even the most loyal of his supporters. Some, the most devout loyalists to the Old Believer cause, say he was placed upon the forests of Adelart by the Gods themselves, given to a local temple to become a prophet of Eyr herself and bring down the lie of the Archonate. Even the skeptics can say little of his background - with no known parents or familial connections, Luca vun Lissay was raised by the faith, bestowing upon him a fanatic devotion to the Gods and faith - and a skepticism of the Archonate's methods that would linger for the rest of his life.\n\nSo far has the cult of personality of Luca vun Lissay risen that he has now been proclaimed the "True Prelate of Greifwald" by his supporters, despite the hierarchical hyprocrisy that the name entails. The ragged, aging priest has become a becaon of hope for the people of Adelart, and after the post-revolutionary purges of Ebonwing's loyalists, now remains the only legitimate temporal authority in the wayward province.\n\nMerlock Wood spared his sect and gave them their power, and now, Luca vun Lissay himself has taken his place. As long as he is in charge, the nobles shall once more flee in terror, and the faithless shall do nothing more but bow their heads to the Gods above.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: MonAx"

However, the griffon who was once Luca vun Lissay has declared that no longer shall this new Archonate be an oligarchy. Instead, the Archons shall be chosen by the people of Griffonia as a whole, as prelates and priests scour the nation for griffons who truly understand the faith and are ready for the burden of power. No longer shall Venia III's Archons be chosen by oligarchy and nobility - they shall be chosen from and by the truly faithful, wherever they may be.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: MonAx"
selena_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 9th of October, 961 in Lissay\n\n§YBiography§!: Selena Krafsherr has been fighting for the faith her entire life. Born to a poor but devout family of farmers on the outskirts of Lissay, Selena was their sixth child, and their fourth daughter. Neglected and impoverished, Selena left her mother's farm as soon as she came of age, and came to join the movement of Luca vun Lissay in 979, laying down her earthly possessions to accept the boon of Eyr and the Old Believers.\n\nSelena found no passion in the dull acts of priesthood, however, and decided to take matters into her own claws. During the Adelartian Revolution of 987, Selena fought for official Old Believer militia brigades, sanctioned by Luca vun Lissay. With the help of Luca, who grew attached to the fiercely religious warrior, Selena was able to found the Sisters of Eyr, an official militia of the faith.\n\nShe became an ordained "Sister" of the all-female militia, and soon attracted griffons from all over Greifwald, becoming Luca's right claw in the process. Selena pressured Luca to declare himself a Prelate to counter Greifwald, and the rest was history. Now, with the Old Belivers cemented under Luca's leadership, Selena stands as a leader of both the faith and an army. The question is what she will do with it.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Cofido"

sheriff_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 21st of November, 951 in Lissay\n\n§YBiography§!: No one is quite sure how the Sheriff of Adelart is still alive, with all the vitriol and hatred levied against him, nor how he has continued to be a sizable thorn in the side of the Adelartian government. 20 years ago, Jean de Nottemagne pursued the bandit Merlock Wood and his allies in the Old Believer faith, raiding towns, demanding taxes and levies from peasants who might have hoarded him and his rebel allies. Now, however, the tables have turned. Merlock Wood is the leader of a free territory for griffons of all stripes, while Nottemagne has been forced from town to town with a small army of loyal griffs and armed tax collectors.\n\nNottemagne, however, has emulated Wood's elusive spirit, and is never found at the same town twice. While mercenaries and Forest Brothers alike pursue him, the Sheriff of Adelart always stays one step ahead, raiding villages for taxes to fill his war chest and griffons to join his roving army. When Forest Brothers catch him, the Sheriff's forces fight like rabid beasts, the Sheriff front and center at the vanguard. He may have lost an eye and all of his dignity in the guerilla war against his former domain, but his perserverance has not wavered.\n\nAdelart will be cleansed from banditry, and the Sheriff will regain his rightful seat!\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofus"

Now, Trouillard is perhaps Adelart's most accomplished general, and with the Sheriff already approaching him in closed-door meetings with shady deals on the table, it seems that Trouillard's faith in Adelart is simply opportunistic.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: EmpressBridle"

### ALL THE FOCUSES OF ADELART ###

### National Focuses - Opening Tree ###

# The opening tree reacts to the balance of power that Merlock Wood has to initiate as the leader of Adelart and its communities - everything is so decentralized that the initial disparate band of revolutionaries has now formed factions vying for power - Merlock here can make certain options that will move Adelart in vastly different directions

HEL_merlocks_twentieth_year:0 "To Twenty Years of Freedom!"
HEL_merlocks_twentieth_year_desc:0 "Though times are tough and the Sheriff still tries to regain the power that he once had, Adelart remains free from tyranny. On this happy anniversary, we shall all celebrate our independence together; so long as nothing spoils the party of course."

HEL_descieuxs_petition:0 "The Émigrés' Petition"
HEL_descieuxs_petition_desc:0 "The émigrés have much to say on the way our little statelet is run and seldom speak fondly of Wood. They recognise that his leadership was necessary for the revolution to take root, but have since witnessed his lack of commitment to their cause and continually harass him for it. Perhaps - after a much deserved celebration - Wood may actually listen to what they say."

HEL_advance_the_revolution:0 "Advance the Revolution"
HEL_advance_the_revolution_desc:0 "Much to our surprise, Wood has agreed to tow the socialist line and cooperate with Descieux on most matters regarding the creation of the state. Whether this is because he has taken the time to actually read the theory he was provided or simply because he feels that the communists are his best allies is, as of right now at least, unclear."

HEL_declare_state_of_siege:0 "Declare State of Siege"
HEL_declare_state_of_siege_desc:0 "Though they have not yet attempted to reclaim the sheriff's realm, Greifwald remains an ever-present threat to both our independence and the budding revolution. We must make haste to prepare all that we can for the inevitable clash between us and our old masters."

HEL_revolutionary_central_command:0 "Well Regulated Revolutionaries"
HEL_revolutionary_central_command_desc:0 "Despite what some in the bands may claim, militaries tend to perform better when they're well organised. It's high time we put together actual divisions with the griffonpower currently occupying the utterly shambolic droves of bandits that Wood has granted Descieux control over."

HEL_evolve_the_bandit_territory:0 "Evolve the Bandit Territory"
HEL_evolve_the_bandit_territory_desc:0 "'Bandit organisations' is somewhat of an oxymoron, particularly in the way that Wood has thus far been running them. Though some level of operational freedom at a low level is necessary for effective military performance, the bottom line is that we need to reform the system into something more reliable; that should keep the émigrés more than satisfied."

HEL_the_outlaw_in_chief:0 "Eint Veralt ènd' alt Veur Eint"
HEL_the_outlaw_in_chief_desc:0 "Allowing the émigrés free reign to do as they pleased would have been a mistake. Though he doesn't like to admit it, Wood was the griffon who united Adelart against its enemies and precluding his guidance would have only caused chaos. He shall keep the Périphérie once more and remind every creature of his capabilities."

HEL_the_merrygriffs_shall_fly_eternal:0 "The Merrygriffs Shall Fly Eternal"
HEL_the_merrygriffs_shall_fly_eternal_desc:0 "The vanguardists are little more than sheriffs in red. Their ideal for a centralised state is precisely what created the current conditions in Adelart and such ridiculous notions have no place here. We have refused Descieux's petition wholesale and have no intention of listening to her dangerously authoritarian idealism."

HEL_free_armies_of_a_free_territory:0 "Free Armies for a Free Territory"
HEL_free_armies_of_a_free_territory_desc:0 "Whilst it may be the right of every Adelartian to organise themselves within a militia if they so choose, the vanguardists have proven to be a nuisance. They shall not be punished for their beliefs of course, instead we shall offer them the choice of leaving their militia or signing on with our bandit brigades where their political leanings will be diluted into nothingness."

HEL_the_flowenan_petition:0 "The Flowenan Petition"
HEL_the_flowenan_petition_desc:0 "Jaume de Conard is a curious character. He is perhaps the only Flowenan interested in Adelart, yet he seems to be no more outlandish than the average businessgriff from that deplorable city of banks. His interest - and that of his investors - is certainly strange; but if he can benefit our little statelet, then perhaps Wood would do well to hear his petition."

HEL_of_bankers_and_bandits:0 "Of Bankers and Bandits"
HEL_of_bankers_and_bandits_desc:0 "We are not industrialists, nor are we well-versed in anything relating to machinery in truth. It comes as no surprise then that - strange as their offer may be - de Conard and his associates have been permitted to lead economic development here. Wood has of course assigned several bandit militias for their protection, and to make sure that nothing shady is going on."

HEL_grovel_for_loans:0 "Grovel for Loans"
HEL_grovel_for_loans_desc:0 "Until very recently Flowena has been rather unwilling to lend our backwards statelet any significant amount of money. De Conard's arrival here has - perhaps unsurprisingly - triggered a renewed interest from their banking institutions. Presumably they now see that they have a reliable griffon in whom they can place their trust and funds."

HEL_sell_the_collectives:0 "Sweet, Sweet Petroidols"
HEL_sell_the_collectives_desc:0 "And now the jig is up. Well, we weren't exactly trying to hide it; but most in Adelart don't even know how valuable oil truly is, which certainly made it a surprise for them. Still, it shouldn't come as that much of a surprise, why else would an immensely rich Flowenan industrialist be interested in a backwater like Adelart unless there was profit to be made? Let the oil flow!"

HEL_good_ol_gun_running:0 "Good Ol' Gun Running"
HEL_good_ol_gun_running_desc:0 "Some frown upon gun running, but in reality it is one of the many commodity trades that keeps the continent afloat. The trick is to make sure you're the one with the monopoly so that the weapons don't fall into the claws of those that shouldn't have them. Crime is bad for business after all. Well... unless you're the one orchestrating said crime, that is."

HEL_crack_open_revolutionary_stores:0 "Crack Open Revolutionary Stores"
HEL_crack_open_revolutionary_stores_desc:0 "Though they're plenty dusty and very outdated by now, some relics of the independence war still exist; stored in strategically positioned caches around the country. They're not the best, but they'll serve us now as well as they would have done a decade ago. At least, as long as we keep them well maintained; that's probably a little much to ask of bandits though."

HEL_community_armouries:0 "Community Armouries"
HEL_community_armouries_desc:0 "Whilst they may not be the cleanest or the most efficient production facilities, what matters is that these armouries are ours and that they work. We have no need of snooty Flowenan bankers in Adelart and by Boreas they will keep their greedy claws off our gradually emerging industry!"

HEL_keep_the_foundations_strong:0 "Of Revolutionary Foundations"
HEL_keep_the_foundations_strong_desc:0 "It's obvious that the Flowenans are up to no good. They never leave their gilded city unless there are idols to be made and Wood was right to assume the worst with their petition. Good riddance to de Conard, and may his riches shrivel for attempting to spin his good-griff industrialist story."

HEL_disarm_dispossess_distribute:0 "The Outlaw Economy"
HEL_disarm_dispossess_distribute_desc:0 "Whilst we Adelartians are a noble people, we are no strangers to taking what we need by force. It was Wood who popularised the practice of taking from the rich and giving to the poor, and our neighbours are - relatively speaking - very rich indeed. We're sure that they'll forgive us for these raids... Eventually."

HEL_reprise_individuelle:0 "Reprise Individuelle"
HEL_reprise_individuelle_desc:0 "Raiding is a fundamental part of our philosophy. It may hurt some creatures, but those that we take from deserve to have their possessions repossessed. At the end of the day our operations are intended to be a net moral and economic positive, which is why we must keep doing what we're doing. Let us free you from your excessive excesses!"

HEL_the_prelates_petition:0 "The Prelate's Petition"
HEL_the_prelates_petition_desc:0 "The self-styled prelate of Adelart is rather self absorbed, but he nevertheless chorales a significant following of griffons that are not to be trifled with. They are steadfast in their beliefs - at least for the moment - and we would do well to hear what vun Lissay has to say, even if his petition contains an enormous amount of pretentious waffle."

HEL_revoke_the_privileges:0 "Suspend Their Privileges"
HEL_revoke_the_privileges_desc:0 "The temples - as with any institution of centralised power - are little more than a disaster waiting to happen. We will not punish those of the faith as there is no reason to, but we will not heed vun Lissay's demands and for them we shall strip him of his powers. His influence is a danger to his followers and to every other creature in Adelart."

HEL_revolutionary_pilgrimage:0 "Going to the People"
HEL_revolutionary_pilgrimage_desc:0 "Though the prelate has been declawed, his followers still represent a threat and need to be neutralised. Not with force of course, but with alternative forms of proselytization. Socialism may have its more dangerous proponents, but it is fundamentally less anti-Wood than vun Lissay ever was. Let's let the vanguardists have their fun."

HEL_voice_for_all_malice_toward_none:0 "Voice for All, Malice towards None"
HEL_voice_for_all_malice_toward_none_desc:0 "Whilst some of vun Lissay's proposals are simply too far, his petition is largely acceptable and his goals are seemingly admirable. We have an accord with him and shall seek to implement the proposed confederal system as an alternative to a strong centralised government that frankly nogriff here in Adelart wants."

HEL_loyal_leagues_of_green:0 "Loyal Leagues of Green"
HEL_loyal_leagues_of_green_desc:0 "Though it may pain the left-leaning militia groups, formally recruiting the religious bands will grant us a surplus of ready and willing volunteers for the conflicts to come. It isn't an ideal solution to our griffonpower problems, but it's certainly serviceable as a stopgap measure."

HEL_the_free_territory_endures:0 "Mir Wëlle Bleiwe Wat mir Sinn!"
HEL_the_free_territory_endures_desc:0 "If in nothing else, Adelartians are united against invading autocrats. They have tried before and sometimes succeeded, but never again will we live idly in subjugation to another tyrant. We will stay what we are: Independent, united and strong together as a people with a shared history of ousting those that seek to see our identity buried."

HEL_bandits_priests_people:0 "Bandits, Priests, People"
HEL_bandits_priests_people_desc:0 "Though it is not entirely clear yet as to why, Wood has decided to agree to all of the demands of the Prelate's petition. A government with vun Lissay at its centre is sure to shortly emerge and the communists shall be rooted out from Adelart for good and sent back to the dank streets of Aquileia from whence they came."

HEL_embrace_the_old_prelature:0 "The Prelate's Rightful Place"
HEL_embrace_the_old_prelature_desc:0 "Though it is a disappointment for many, it has become clear that vun Lissay must return to Wood's side and govern Adelart with him. No doubt some will protest this considerable increase in power for the temples, but it is necessary for the good of the faithful and for Adelart as a whole."

HEL_head_of_the_snake:0 "The Head of the Snake"
HEL_head_of_the_snake_desc:0 "All those years ago when we won our independence from Greifwald, we never managed to locate the sheriff. He managed to evade us, presumably under the false assumption that he could regain control once the worst had blown over. This time he will not escape. This time, we will hunt until his beak is mounted on the end of a spear for his unforgivable crimes."

### THE ENTIRETY OF THE ARMY TREE ###

HEL_the_six_companies:0 "The Six Free Companies"
HEL_the_six_companies_desc:0 "The Six Free Companies, various mercenary bands, private military companies, holy orders, and revolutionary organizations, founded at various stages in the history of Adelart, make up the backbone of all contingents outside the direct supervision of [HEL.GetLeader]'s personal army. To restore our army to a proper position, we must deal with them, and find out which are worth supporting... and which are not."

HEL_the_fliger_air_corps:0 "The Alois & Joanna Fliger Family Air Corps"
HEL_the_fliger_air_corps_desc:0 "The Fliger Air Corps, founded some time ago in 981 ALB, are a band of Feathisian pilots exiled for smuggling resources on the Flowenan black market. For profit, curiosity, or pity, they have decided to stay in Adelart as the country's only real aerial prescence, which means to control any Adelartian airspace, one must deal with the Fligers and their immense extended family."

HEL_dispersed_air_doctrine:0 "A Real Air Doctrine"
HEL_dispersed_air_doctrine_desc:0 "There is no point in investing in airfields or airplanes if we do not know how to use them. Thus with airfields built and the first Adelart planes in production, we have to establish an Adelartian aerial doctrine."

HEL_integrate_the_militias:0 "Absorb The Militias"
HEL_integrate_the_militias_desc:0 "While we wish our army to remain decentralized we must ensure that all the militias of Adelart can still remain under the army's general control. Therefore, we should begin a new campaign to begin reigning in many of the local militia groups with promises of continued autonomy."

#HEL_the_sisters_of_eyr:0 "Integrate The Sisters Of Eyr"
#HEL_the_sisters_of_eyr_desc:0 "The sisters of Eyr are an... eccentric group. Parading around Adelart in their iron behemoths they enforce the will of the gods on the land. We should make an effort to try to associate them with our military and use their divine strength."

HEL_the_merrimane_column:0 "The Merrimane Column"
HEL_the_merrimane_column_desc:0 "The Merrimane Column, a collection of international socialist revolutionaries from Equestria and left-wing veterans of the First Aquileian Revolution, settled in Adelart at the time of their own revolution in 987 ALB. From then, they have built a reputation as a hub of militant leftism and as a place for volunteers the world over to help build the new Adelart."

HEL_haven_of_socialism:0 "A Haven of Global Socialism"
HEL_haven_of_socialism_desc:0 "Whilst most would shun the idea of granting safe passage and housing to socialist revolutionaries from all across the world, we have no reason to fear these like-minded creatures. [HEL.GetNameDefCap] shall operate as a safe haven and distribution network for our red friends all over the continent and beyond!"

HEL_stalliongradian_tank_models:0 "Stalliongradian Tank Models"
HEL_stalliongradian_tank_models_desc:0 "The revolutionaries in Stalliongrad were the first to develop effective tank designs and have been exporting their designs to the red-tinted world for years. We would do well to adopt and study them for ourselves in order to diversify our armed forces and provide close support to both our regular and irregular forces."

HEL_army_of_aggression:0 "An Army of Aggression"
HEL_army_of_aggression_desc:0 "There is an ancient joke originating from the era of Grover II in which a griffon claims that offence is the best defence, then proceeds to get himself killed in a reckless charge into a well prepared enemy. That poor griff did have a point, however. Proper application of offensive tactics and high levels of autonomy amongst commanders does often lead to strategic success."

HEL_adelartian_international_brigades:0 "Form New International Brigades"
HEL_adelartian_international_brigades_desc:0 "Aside from allowing us to acquire and distribute military experience amongst the armed forces without extensive and expensive training exercises, there is another benefit to a thriving foreign volunteer network. When the time for war comes, many will answer the call to arms to protect themselves and their revolutionary hub."

HEL_to_the_barricades:0 "Chantons la Liberté, Défendons la Cite"
HEL_to_the_barricades_desc:0 "As many revolutionaries are urbanites that knew how to read from a young age, it is no surprise that they are more familiar with city sprawl than most draftees. On the surface this may seem inconsequential, but detailed knowledge of a location makes for better positioning and a superb understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of urban warfare that may prove vital."

HEL_the_jade_company:0 "The Jade Company of Romau"
HEL_the_jade_company_desc:0 "The Jade Company, built in 911 ALB by a dissident Senator of Romau, lack a truly centralized command following the death of the old griff who built it, but make up for it with a fanatic devotion to the Republican cause. Their recruits are many and their power broad, and although they may be particularly brutal in their fight against the monarchists, they would welcome our support with utter devotion."

HEL_spirit_of_the_legionaires:0 "Tenacity of the Legionaires"
HEL_spirit_of_the_legionaires_desc:0 "Romau's knights are renowned for good reason. They may stand for principles that are largely alien to us, but their capacity to fight is nevertheless remarkable. We would do well to copy their traditions of extensive military planning at the strategic level combined with rigorous training of individual soldiers and commanders."

HEL_renew_and_revive:0 "Renew, Revive, Replenish"
HEL_renew_and_revive_desc:0 "Griffons themselves are not the only part of an army that can be healed and returned to service. Equipment, be it complex or simple, is equally as worthy of maintenance and restoration. Keeping current stockpiles functional will be of great help to our military production in the long term, even if the repaired weaponry will eventually be out of date. Better an old gun than a broken one."

HEL_the_great_river_line:0 "The Great River Line"
HEL_the_great_river_line_desc:0 "Whilst fortifications have become more complex to effectively construct and utilise, their importance has not diminished over the years. Trenches, bunkers and weapon emplacements will be constructed behind the great river that separates Verenia and the Périphérie. They will be expensive, but it is always better to spend money than waste lives."

HEL_smuggle_the_latest_tactics:0 "Moles in the University"
HEL_smuggle_the_latest_tactics_desc:0 "The Périphérie is home to many griffs that speak Griffish and could - if required - pass as one in a pinch. Study of doctrine in such an isolated position as ours is difficult, but getting a few 'Herzlander' students into a private Romauan university is relatively easy. There will be plenty for us to learn in those hallowed halls."

HEL_kemerskaian_methods:0 "Learn from Kemerskai"
HEL_kemerskaian_methods_desc:0 "The republican revolution of 978 had little impact on Adelart aside from being loosely responsible for a change in management, but there is much to be learned from the conflict. Alexander Kemerskai's proficient usage of artillery is of particular interest as it will allow us to concentrate our artillery equipment most effectively and utilise proper counter-battery tactics."

#HEL_introduce_field_hospitals:0 "Introduce Field Hospitals"
#HEL_introduce_field_hospitals_desc:0 "Field hospitals are by no means a new innovation in warfare but are new to the less organized armies of the world. With this, we should make attempts to integrate these new ideas to try to save as many of the lives of those who would risk giving it up for their nation."

#HEL_introduce_armored_cars:0 "Putting Guns On Cars"
#HEL_introduce_armored_cars_desc:0 "Motorizing warfare has been something experimented on by a few militias in our country since the revolution. We should embrace these for the entirety of our army."

HEL_the_forest_brothers:0 "The Forest Brothers"
HEL_the_forest_brothers_desc:0 "The Forest Brothers, an ancient company founded in 644 ALB, once led by Merlock Wood himself, remains one of the premier forces in the movement for Adelartian independence and national liberation. The company's tactics, however, remain based in banditry and guerilla warfare through their role in the fight against the Sheriff, and they may not be the most... easily disciplined."

HEL_dig_in_and_pray_to_eyr:0 "Dig In and Pray to Eyr"
HEL_dig_in_and_pray_to_eyr_desc:0 "A prepared defence is what gets our already limited griffonpower reserves home to live another day and fight another battle. There is no shame in such defensive tactics in general, but especially so under that lens. We will utilise layers of concentric fortifications to ward off any enemy that may seek to break our spirit in one quick strike."

HEL_an_impenetrable_wall:0 "An Impenetrable Wall"
HEL_an_impenetrable_wall_desc:0 "Our northern towns are quite exposed, resting at the edge of the enormous forest that makes up most of Adelart proper and thus leaving vulnerable to attack from both up and downstream. It is imperative that we construct additional fortifications in order to shore up our defences and send a message to any creature that even thinks about an invasion."

# FIRST PATH - the VANGUARD #

### Alexandra Desiceux and her emigres, vanguardists, and pro-Aquileian communist bloc has taken control of Adelart, and essentially done a 180 on revolutionary development, transforming a state of bandit anarchy under an uneasy confederation into a would-be worker's republic. Fiercely critical of the old bandits and militias, the faith, and reactionaries, the Vanguardists are very much patronising of the average Adelartian, who they view as needing a lot of uplifting from a primitive nationalist philosophy and the opiate of religion. Still, there is much potential here for true class consciousness, and there is an element of idealism and visionary politics among the emigre's experiments in Adelart.

###SECOND POLITICAL PATH - ANARCHISTS###

### Having succeeded in establishing complete primacy over Adelart for him and his bandit confederation, Merlock Wood has embraced the logical conclusions of the principles of the confederation, of autonomy, of decentralization, and of liberty for all griffons - anarchy. Transforming Adelart's anarchy from circumstance into ideology, Wood will seek to promote free association under a autonomous military apparatus that will guide Adelart to the future, and commit a bit too much violence on reactionaries, the temples, foreign powers, and perhaps even some of its own populace. Launching insurrectionary campaigns to take from the rich and give to the poor, this path largely retains the "Robin Hood" vibe.

HEL_gun_rights_anarchist:0 "Under No Pretext"
HEL_gun_rights_anarchist_desc:0 "20 years ago the griffons of Adelart declared independence from the Greifwald tyrants in a popular uprising.

HEL_intellectual_guidance:0 "A Proper Bandit Intelligentsia"
HEL_intellectual_guidance_desc:0 "To say our movement's success was a chance matter would be putting it kindly, to say the least. It has been a struggle to proliferate our ideals even within our own borders in part because of the lack of centralised governance.

HEL_peoples_anarchist_army:0 "The Black and Greens"
HEL_peoples_anarchist_army_desc:0 "There is currently no organisational overlap between the nationalist militias and the anarchist partisans, to such a detrimental extent that they often end up in localised conflicts with one another by accident.

### THIRD PATH - THE PRELATURE OF ADELART ###

### The Prelate and his steel-plated tractors and steel-plated knights have taken control of the country, pledging to restore the true practices of the Old Believers and reject any sort of hierarchical religion. Fiercely independent and quite militaristic despite a pacifistic, communitarian, and cooperative ethos, the Prelate's supporters have essentially declared war on the Archonate and the false kings and dukes of Griffonia who claim divine right. The only person with divine right, they say, is the Prophet of Eyr - a mysterious griffon from the Adelartian forests known simply as Luca vun Lissay. Soft-spoken yet with deep reservoirs of passionate sermons, Luca and his militias have a clear ethos - but may follow some cult-like practices in their desire to restore some pretty chill and courageous religious values.

### FOURTH POLITICAL PATH - SWITZERLAND ###

### Adelart reforms into a true confederation as Wood and the Prelate Luca put aside their differences and decide once again to lead Adelart against the Sheriff and Greifwald. Wood is the de-facto benefactor of the Socialist Coalition, while Luca leads Eyrite Conservatives - both parties bear a committment to decentralization, communal ethics, personal freedom, and direct democratic ideals, but economic methods ( distributivism vs. socialism ) and social methods ( revolutionary nationalism vs. a more religious, temperate social ethos ) divide two factions that the player can choose between.

HEL_propose_pomovarran_unification_desc:0 "Adelart and Pomovarra have long held cultural ties to one another, ties that have only grown stronger as time passes. Now that we have inherited the role of the region's largest political entity, it is only sensical that we offer Pomovarra cantonhood within our confederation; retaining autonomy and joining their brothers in arms."

HEL_unified_democratic_government_desc:0 "Though we have militarily conquered Aquileia, our new government lacks the recognition that their centuries-old political order did.

HEL_democratic_cult_of_personality:0 "Hero Of Our New Democracy"
HEL_democratic_cult_of_personality_desc:0 "Though he doesn't like to admit it, Merlock Wood was the first amongst us to recognise the need for socialist progress in moderation.

HEL_rally_the_youth_desc:0 "In most contexts, militaristic youth groups are typically both radical and dangerous; but there are certainly ways to make them useful.

### FIFTH POLITICAL PATH - OIL REPUBLIC ###

### The Oil Republic is led by Jaume de Conard, yet the Flowenan-backed industrialist and all-around slimy, charismatic personality can come to power through two ways, and must carefully balance both of them. First is democratic legitimacy, needed to placate the people - his government after all, is technically a republic of the people, the fulfilling of Adelart's true mission of democracy and self-determination, to be led away from these socialist bandits and toward a new reppublican era. The Second is loyalty to his benefactors, the Flowenans, and the maintenance of their interests - control of Adelart's oil fields, friends in government, and proper industrialization. From this, the Oil Republic - a oligarchic apparatus dedicated to profit and power, yet with a shred of proper democracy and state-building regardless ( perhaps the most stable democracy out of any path ), is born.

HEL_de_conards_republic:0 "The Oil Republic"
HEL_de_conards_republic_desc:0 "Whether by trickery or legitimate democratic means, Jaume de Conard has found himself at the helm of a new Adelartian Republic.

HEL_revolutionary_spirit:0 "Let the World Know Our Name"

HEL_an_end_to_wood_desc:0 "Merlock Wood and his socialist thugs have plagued our country for twenty years. We once thought him as a liberator, but now we see the danger.

HEL_the_social_democrats:0 "An Experiment in Nation-Building"
HEL_the_social_democrats_desc:0 "Though profit remains Conard's primary motive, it is clear that there is only so much to be extracted from as backwater a nation as [HEL.GetNameDef].

HEL_the_flowenan_group:0 "Full Control for de Conard"
HEL_the_flowenan_group_desc:0 "Contrary to the beliefs of some, a republic is not precluded from enjoying the benefits of authoritarianism.

HEL_a_haven_for_business_desc:0 "Our opponents that used to sit on the left side of the aisle painted Adelart as a haven for the working griffon, but that is not profitable.

HEL_a_powerful_executive:0 "A True President"
HEL_a_powerful_executive_desc:0 "The office of the Speaker has never been more then a way to honor our country's father in Merlock Wood.

HEL_abolish_the_congress:0 "No More Congresses"
HEL_abolish_the_congress_desc:0 "The congresses were designed to give the people a voice, but they are a shrill chorus ruled by a mob mentality.

HEL_remove_old_believer_broadcasts_desc:0 "Luca vun Lissay and their Old Believers would be useful allies in the fight against socialist ideology, but their penchant for needless charity stirs the pot.

HEL_send_out_the_invitations_desc:0 "Jaume De Conard's contacts in Flowena will allow us to reach potential investors that might be wary of the banking city's...reputation. A few promises here about access to Lissay's oilfields, a few promises there about having some institutions named in their honor, and a 'no-questions-asked' policy about the origin of the money should attract many wealthy griffons."

HEL_friends_in_flowena:0 "Further Ties With Flowena"
HEL_friends_in_flowena_desc:0 "The banks of Flowena are deep and their coffers are full. Because our regions are close with one another, it is only a logical step to have our business interests close with them as well.

HEL_industrialize_the_sites:0 "Industrialize the Sites"
HEL_industrialize_the_sites_desc:0 "What few existing industrial sites we have need to be modernized before we attempt expanding upon them.

HEL_the_great_conard_bank:0 "The Grand Bank of Conard"
HEL_the_great_conard_bank_desc:0 "Our efforts in attracting investors has not gone unnoticed, and now, the opening of the Grand Bank shall soon commence.

HEL_chop_down_the_forests:0 "Chop Down the Forests"
HEL_chop_down_the_forests_desc:0 "In an age of steel, iron, and oil there is often the griffon who forgets the importance of the humble tree.

In addition, clearing out some of the forests will make room for new factories and infrastructure."

HEL_new_taxes:0 "Taxes, Taxes, Taxes"
HEL_new_taxes_desc:0 "A five percent income tax on our poorest griffon and our richest griffon is widely different a sum of idols. Squeezing every idol out of our poor makes little sense, a comprehensive tax reform that shifts based upon annual income shall be a fair way forward. There might be some grumbling from our wealthiest citizens, but a fair tax is better than another socialist revolt."

HEL_literacy_for_all:0 "Open the Trade Schools"

HEL_anarchists_are_bandits_desc:0 "The anarchists are just that, the enemies of order and progress. Not only did they assist in overthrowing the sheriff in 987, but they have aligned themselves with wood and a fundamentally dangerous ideology. They are little more than an enemy to be crushed, and crushed these bandits shall be."

HEL_liberals_are_bandits:0 "Liberals Are Bandits"
HEL_liberals_are_bandits_desc:0 "De Conard and the confederalists - though not aligned - are deplorable for similar reasons. Both resent the idea of monarchy, both seek money above all else and both will cause Adelart's untimely demise if left unattended for much longer. They too shall be hunted down like the bandit scum that they pretend to be above."

HEL_old_believers_are_bandits:0 "Old Believers Are Bandits"
HEL_old_believers_are_bandits_desc:0 "The old believers are little more than a cult and an affront to both the sheriff and the primary tenets of tritheism. Eyr may be a god, but Boreas is the first amongst them; what shameless reprobates would dare to claim otherwise? If they are so keen to abandon the true teachings of the gods, then we shall send these bandits to them post-haste."

HEL_none_of_you_are_free_from_banditry:0 "None of You Are Free From Banditry"
HEL_none_of_you_are_free_from_banditry_desc:0 "Part of the banditry problem lies within the populace. Like it or not, they enabled the revolt against the sheriff to succeed in 987 either through inaction or directly supporting the bandits. That makes them no better than Wood and his despicable cronies. We shall make an example of those that try to shelter the traitors, and then there will be peace."

HEL_rally_the_monarchists:0 "Rally the Diaspora"
HEL_rally_the_monarchists_desc:0 "Despite their claims to fight for the good of Adelart, the bandit takeover forced many an administrator and rightly concerned Adelartian citizen to flee into Greifwald. Whilst they did not expect to return, the possibility of returning to a life they thought lost is very persuasive to many. Let us lay a place at the table for our old allies."

HEL_invite_the_count:0 "Invite the Count"
HEL_invite_the_count_desc:0 "The sheriff's position is below the count and - as it is our charge - the count shall lead our nation in all of his wisdom. That is to say nothing about how much control over policy he will have, of course. We have not forgotten the lack of aid provided by the Greifwaldians and the count, so his position shall be restored in name only; as is deserving of one that fails his subjects."

HEL_avenge_the_count:0 "Avenge the Count"
HEL_avenge_the_count_desc:0 "Despite his many failings, particularly regarding the 987 revolution and the lack of resources that were provided to prevent it, the count was nevertheless our leader. He was taken from us - like Adelart - by bandits, thieves and anarchists. We shall avenge the heartless killing of the count and make examples of the griffons that dare oppose the sheriff."

HEL_hire_monarchist_mercenaries_desc:0 "Much like the previously present administrators from Greifwald, there are many officers and elite troops that were forced out of the province when Wood's revolution regrettably succeeded.

HEL_the_loyalist:0 "A New Feudalism"
HEL_the_loyalist_desc:0 "Griffonia has moved away from it's core tenets far too much. There was once a natural order that this new age of Republicanism and Socialism has so clearly violated.

HEL_oaths_of_loyalty:0 "Take Over the Communes"
HEL_oaths_of_loyalty_desc:0 "How polite of the communists to collect vital industry and the griffons to run it together for us before we had a chance to deal with them. I'm sure they won't mind us 'repurposing' them for future use given they can't complain anymore..."

HEL_appoint_new_nobility_desc:0 "There are those who, despite all the odds, still stood strong in Adelart throughout the chaos of the last two decades. Such tenacity is to be applauded and rewarded with a place in our new government to help prevent such anarchy from befalling us once more."

HEL_focus_on_urbanization_desc:0 "Though our forests are beautiful they have given us nothing but problems, from preventing industrialisation to keeping bandits sheltered from us.

HEL_hike_the_taxes:0 "Arm the Tax Collectors"
HEL_hike_the_taxes_desc:0 "To expect the populace to understand our demands peacefully is a fool's errand, such is a lesson we've learned too many times.

HEL_economic_rebirth:0 "Oiling the Gears of the Shrievalty"
HEL_economic_rebirth_desc:0 "With the new inventions around us oil has become second only to idols in fueling greed all across Griffonia. Luckily we've found that the oil fields we believed to be moderately sized were far larger than we initially thought. With a few pretty smiles and modern equipment we can begin selling the excess far and wide."

HEL_blood_sweat_and_results:0 "Serfdom for the 11th Century"
HEL_blood_sweat_and_results_desc:0 "Finally our efforts have borne fruit. We have managed to achieve so much more than simply turning back the clock, I daresay we've even surpassed what the empires of yore were able to achieve with their serfs in terms of efficiency. It's the perfect synthesis of old and new as our toilers break their backs, our cities shine clean and our factories churn out more than we could dream of!"

HEL_vengeance_for_the_fallen:0 "Eradicate the Outlaw Ethos"
HEL_vengeance_for_the_fallen_desc:0 "Adelart must never fall to banditry ever again. The tales of horror and violence from the past two decades must be spread and repeated enough to ensure the very notion of a bandit republic is met with fear and ridicule, to allow such tales to fade would shatter any chance of peace we could ever achieve."

HEL_new_model_army:0 "The Sheriff's New Model Army"
HEL_new_model_army_desc:0 "The lack of effectiveness of the Adelartian militia system has been proven very bluntly, as the absence of loyalty from its leaders and skills from its troops led directly to the last two decades of turmoil. To alleviate this the Sheriff has personally ordered the creation of a standing army to replace the militias."

HEL_slaughter_the_mercenaries:0 "Drive Out the Mercenaries"
HEL_slaughter_the_mercenaries_desc:0 "The existence of mercenaries within Greifwald poses a troublesome dilemma, if we purchase their services we support bandits within our own borders but if we shun them then they can provide services to dissidents against us. The solution to such a problem is far simpler than either answer - Keep the useful ones and get the rest of those Boreas damned leeches away from us."

HEL_repaint_the_tractors:0 "Repossess the Tractors"
HEL_repaint_the_tractors_desc:0 "Despite their makeshift appearance, the ‘Tractor Tanks’ of the Sisters of Eyr were annoyingly effective. Seeing as their former users are indisposed, nogriff would complain if we were to simply claim their efforts for our own."

HEL_persecute_the_work_shy:0 "The Timide au Travail"
HEL_persecute_the_work_shy_desc:0 "If one does not work, they do not deserve to live. The modern Adelartian has embraced gluttony and entitlement, lounging in squalor and blissful decadence knowing that their bandit overlords would never truly have levied taxes, work, or conscription upon them. We, however, will not be so merciful. To turn a blind eye to such asocial, work-shy behavior undermines the very fabric of the state and the shrievalty."

HEL_sheriffs_goons_in_the_police_desc:0 "The Aquileians have the right idea with their Gendarmerie, allowing them to gather information and keep the peace in dangerous areas.

HEL_the_sheriffs_state_desc:0 "Peace. Security. Control.\n\nI have finally achieved them all for MY country.

For now it is enough."

HEL_queen_of_adelart:0 "L'ancienne Dynastie"
HEL_queen_of_adelart_desc:0 "The Discrets are not so blind as to be turned away from the Periphery forever.

HEL_aquileian_industrial_aid:0 "The Bankers of Pridea"
HEL_aquileian_industrial_aid_desc:0 "After our previous run in with the Discrets we have received a few letters of interest from Pridea, primarily concerning investments for our oil and domestic industry.

HEL_restore_archonate_infrastructure:0 "The Divine Right of Sheriffs"
HEL_restore_archonate_infrastructure_desc:0 "With the return of the Sheriff comes the return of the true faith.

HEL_griffonian_industrial_aid:0 "The Industrialists of Feathisia"
HEL_griffonian_industrial_aid_desc:0 "Our northern neighbors have shown themselves to be excellent industrialists in recent years, though with their recent crises it is plain to see that some of their more prominent companies are seeking to hedge some of their bets elsewhere.

HEL_the_aquileian_demon:0 "The Devil in Aquila"
HEL_the_aquileian_demon_desc:0 "In recent years whatever leadership remains in Aquila has made plenty of vibrant enemies, most of whom are ready and willing to take up arms against them.

HEL_full_control_to_the_sheriff:0 "Nasty, Brutish, and Short"
HEL_full_control_to_the_sheriff_desc:0 "The common griffon must represent their place in the natural order of things: subservient to authorities ordained by the will of the Count, the Sheriff, and the Archonate. Without such natural order, griffons are doomed to reject their own heritage and faith in favor of such bandit republics as we have seen in the North and in Adelart. Noble structures lasted us a millennium - why not a millennium more?"

HEL_leviathan:0 "Leviathan"
HEL_leviathan_desc:0 "Given our recent cementing of control, Hobble has suggested an expansion to the Service's purview.

HEL_the_service_at_the_door_desc:0 "Griffonia's technology marches onward, but the techniques to use them remain the same.

HEL_the_service_anywhere_boreas_is_desc:0 "We must understand that what we fight is no less than our own nature, and that such an uphill battle requires lines to be crossed. We must violate any semblance of neutrality that churches within our borders have, otherwise they will simply act as refuges for dissidents.

HEL_the_state_of_nature_is_banditry_desc:0 "Though Banditry represents the degeneration of Griffonkind and is something to abhor, it is unfortunately a part of us. Without a way of expressing such a key part of us, we will end up repressing our feelings and destroying the glory we have fought so hard for. One solution is to direct such feelings towards more useful areas, such as using our greed to extract more gems and to steal supplies from our enemies."

HEL_burn_the_town_halls_desc:0 "The scent of ash and scenes of charred wood and ruin are all that remain around the town halls of Adelart, once grand symbols of its wayward bandit confederation.

HEL_sheriff_kill_pom_desc:0 "For two decades we have been forced to watch the Pomovarran abomination at our heels. Theirs is a system of lethargy and false promises, and to allow it to continue could reignite the flames of banditry and treachery we've spent so long putting out."

HEL_a_foothold_in_skyfall_desc:0 "The less said about Skyfall's role in the degeneration of griffonkind and our ancestral mores the better.

adelart.1.t:0 "Twenty Days of Celebration" #Ardent Custodian
adelart.1.d:0 "Twenty years of freedom called for twenty days of celebration for the free merry griffons of Adelart. Any incredulous planners for such a tall plan were swiftly reassured by Adelart's charming national hero – the one and only, Merlock Wood! – and soon the streets and squares of Bergelun flocked with celebration. Griffons all over Adelart were beyond eager to join these grand festivities, and for twenty days straight was Bergelun filled with fluttering party banners, scrumptious food, beautiful minstrel tunes, and cheers and drinks all around. For the peasants, local heroes, and everygriffon in between, twenty years of freedom from the tyranny of Greifwald was more a reason than any for such grand celebrations.\n\nAmong the many partygoers came the many community leaders living throughout, traveling to Bergelun not only to celebrate, but also to represent their homes in Adelart's congressional assembly. Beyond the doors of Bergelun's makeshift national assembly hall, long ago appropriated from its use as a Greifwald court of injustice, community leaders and representatives from highly interested factions would meet for twenty days to debate and decide Adelart's future.\n\nEverygriff in Adelart knew that tensions with Greifwald were at an all-time high and would only grow no matter how much Adelart's population partied away. A course had to be decided, and soon, but the final decision would rest with Merlock Wood: the living legend who led Adelart to freedom. Or at least, it was widely believed so. Events across Griffonia had drawn in many new prominent groups over the last years, and most had packed a delegate or two in this year's assembly.\n\nIt was looking to be a very devisive future for Adelart.\n\nMerlock Wood sat idly listening to the chatter throughout the court. Adjusting his green bycoket on his head, the living legend reached for his pint and took a swig."

It was like being on the hunt with his merrygriffs again, and it was the closest to being with them since Luca talked his ear off about 'Not running off on his own and leaving Adelart leaderless.' It made sense, but that didn't make him miss the merrygriffs any less. They missed him as well, but with Luca's 'suggestion' and the debates ringing true all around Adelart he just couldn't join them on raids, the situation was too tenuous. Something was going to give, and when it did he'd have to make the choices. \n\nMerlock was shaken from his thoughts by a shout coming from the counter nearby. Two griffons, one wearing a robe adorned with symbols of Eyr and the other having a PAT symbol on his beret, were arguing about spreading their doctrines in Lissay. Annoyed, Merlock stood up and walked over to them, tapping the PAT exile on the shoulder. "Keep it down, gentlegriffs," he said calmly. "You're making the beer taste bitter." Both griffons nodded sheepishly, and Merlock returned to his seat.\n\nMerlock sat down with his head in his claws. If these arguments continued, then he'd be stuck playing babysitter until someone went too far and nogriff knew how long that'd take. Taking a sip from his drink, he put some thought to it. If any faction pulled something drastic while unsupported, it'd be politically disastrous for them. But if he was behind one of them...\n\nThat could work. He'd have to call a meeting with the delegates, which would be a worse headache than after the celebration but it could be a way out of this mess and a way to get the delegates off of his back. With a determined nod, Merlock finished his drink, it'd be a rough few weeks so he may as well take what joy he could get for now."

"It's a plot, one you've sown against yourself for twenty years," she continued. "You and your friends have watered such a fertile soil of class consciousness, but just as the seeds have begun to flower, you choke the revolution by planting the thorns of capitalist and clerical collaboration!"\n\n"What can I say?" he said smugly. "If they're with me, they're with all of us Adelartians."\n\n"They, too, are capable of deceit," she answered back. "You speak of liberation for all, yet your younger self sought to curtail the 'freedoms' of the sheriff and his Greifwalder lords. Your newfound 'friends' would've put your younger—your truer—Merlock to open shame." She slipped a folder to his table. "These are our demands. Our points are three: one, to actualise this pre-existing Adelartian communalism into a vanguard-led workers' republic; two, to bar bandits and mercenaries from participating in this republic, as they only plunder the fruits of our labourers; and three, to implement the dual-wielding policy of agricultural collectivisation and collective industrialisation."\n\nMerlock blinked as he took the document and skimmed the whole thing. At least Descieux was content that the charming face of Adelart was taking interest in this vision once more. Soon, though, when the papers were clawed back to her, she got her answer:"

To any foreigner, this beyond ancient Priest of Eyr seemed fragile enough to be knocked over with but a simple poke, but the griffons of Adelart knew very well the tales surrounding him.\n\nMerlock smiled, remembering how true the tales were of those unfortunate enough to be on the receiving end of that staff. "Nonsense, Luca," he gestured for his friend to sit, "I get better with age."\n\nPrelate Luca vun Lissay chuckled as he obliged, "Only by faith can you hope to live as long as I."\n\nMerlock laughed, "Of course, by faith, and by not standing in front of your armored tractors." The two compatriots spoke reminiscently of the old times they had together and the many more adventures that culminated with Adelart's independence. They talked about their shared past like the old friends they were, and only when the sun was well set and other patrons had left did the Prelate finally bring up the topic he wanted to speak of.\n\n"Merlock, many of the faith are concerned with the "Going to the Griffons" movement. I've seen PAT operatives in Adelart trying to stir up anti-clerical sentiments and communistic leanings in the shadows. You might think it good for everygriffon to be heard, but it's a far cry from democracy: it's populism manipulated to strip away the self-determination of our temples and Adelart's institution of governance we fought for.

Wood spun around at the sound and put one of his claws on his flintlock. Before him stood a clean-cut, handsome griffon with a dark grey suit so clean, it felt alien compared to the mildew-ridden wall and the gravel path they stood on. Jaume de Conard, the richest griff in Adelart. Wood let go of his gun, but kept his piercing gaze on the griffon.\n\nJaume chuckled and held his talons up. "Relax, Merlock, I come in peace.

They wouldn't mind loaning some flowins to transform this backyard of Aquileia into a country that can stand on its own. We'll build factories, feed griffons, and make this place a true republic."\n\nJaume put his surprisingly cold talon on Merlock's shoulder, and whispered, "Relive your old dreams, Merlock.

Even his fellow band of merrygriffs, honest and loyal folks who always listened to Merlock's commands, devolved into a tempest of insults at the Adelartians they had once fought for.\n\nWhen did it get this bad, Merlock ruminated. He remembered the day several years ago that he and Luca agreed to the system of petitions. A way for all voices to be heard, equal and without prejudice. It was an ideal system that both he and the Prelate agreed on.\n\nAnd now, the Prelate was yelling at him, as well.\n\nMerlock gazed at his old friend, eyes full of rage as his beak directed demands at Wood.

Exhaustion became his center of being, a state that veiled the world in a shade of grey. If only he could go out with his merrygriffs and fight the sheriff once more. Be a symbol of hope and peace in a country invested with darkness. He'd give anything to go back to those days once more.\n\nBut no, he had a place to be. A position to be in.

"Sir... Flowenans... coming in... they have... mercenaries..." she muttered in between breaths.\n\n"What?" Bordeau tilted his head at his worker for a few seconds before his stomach dropped and his memory returned.

"For all his help, it's the Merrimanes that will do the bulk of the work. Monsieur Allard will be proud of you."\n\n"I would be honoured if I had a tenth of his attention," Descieux muttered. Victor Allard was, in communist Aquileian politics, an enigma, diverging from Cru and the majority of the movement by his substantive emphasis on vanguard parties. A monarchist in red to some, he was the sanest of them all to Descieux: capitalism's war against organised labour could only be won by a counter-organised force of the workers' most class-conscious; without such a masterful guide, the labouring class would be easily fooled by the wiles of reaction.\n\nA great battle cry escaped from the hall, and Merlock shouted yet more invectives against Greifwald under a sea of raised flintlocks and sabres.

There was no longer a griffon left in that shell, only a husk of the once-famous Merlock Wood.\n\n"He brought all of us here to discuss the future of Adelart," the new voice slithered into the office. Luca and Alexandra shot their necks towards the door, where Jaume de Conard walked into the room.

"Your soldiers blasted any remnants we had left along with the Sheriff’s troops."\n\n"A noble sacrifice. My point is, we have found ourselves in a special position to help Adelart. We can make this an internationally recognized country, a real republic. One not led by some former, wash-out legend," de Conard spoke, without any reaction from Wood.\n\nPrelate Luca shook his head and sighed. "Ah, yes, a real republic. Really run by an oil tycoon like yourself?"\n\n"Please calm yourself, Prelate. If I wanted full power, I could arrest you on the spot. No, I truly mean to allow our citizens to vote. To give them a future. It’s the only way we can protect ourselves from the Sheriff once more. Of course, I will temporarily volunteer as president until such an election happens, but together, without any sort of discourse or yelling, let’s develop a system that will give our country a future. And with my supervision, we can make sure it is in everyone’s favor...""

This was his fault, wasn’t it? He was the one who signed off on Descieux’s damned plan without thinking it through. He was the one who spurned her offer of organising the militiagriffs. And because of his actions...\n\nHe was shaken from his stupor by a claw on his shoulder. Blinking, he realised his merrygriffs had come to the stage and surrounded their leader.

In another time, in another place, this call would have gotten the townsfolk to hide their belongings and their children in the root cellars, to wait out the storm. The sheriff was a fearsome griffon with many followers, armed to the teeth. Not in Adelart. Not today.\n\nToday, the call was met with loaded guns and steely eyes. They had been waiting for this day for twenty years, whether or not they thought it would ever really arrive. The militiagriffs: farmers, hunters, trappers, foragers, blacksmiths, tinsmiths, herdsgriffs, loggers, builders, chandlers; griffons from every walk of life, arrived at their rallying points, reported to whoever they had chosen as officers long ago, when they had first began preparing for this day.\n\nThey had no uniforms save a single scrap of red cloth tied around the head or arm which would serve to distinguish friend from foe.

So there could be no retreat for either side, with the fate of Adelart at stake.\n\nIt wasn't a conventional battle. It was fought in hundreds of chance encounters, dozens of set piece clashes and claw-and-beak conflicts, frontal attacks, desperate defences, ambushes and raids. It was an epic that ran across great stretches of wild country: one day its focal point was a hill named on no map, next a miserable border village a hundred miles away. For every attack the sheriff made, his forces found themselves cut off and swarmed. Flintlock rifles, percussion cap muskets, bayonet, lever-action repeaters, wood-splitting axes... the Adelartians used whatever weapons were at claw, and soon the Greifwalders' numbers and spirit faltered.\n\nAny soldiers caught crawling back to the sheriff's camp without their targets taken were executed as cowards. Soon, they stopped returning at all. The sheriff realized too late that his forces had deserted him, and that he was surrounded. He put up a desperate defence, shooting down Adelartian after Adelartian as they tried again and again to breach the perimeter of his command post.

Long live Greifwald! Long live-"\n\nHis speech was cut off by gunfire. Merlock had gestured for his half of the firing squad to get it over with. The Prelate turned, outraged. As they started to argue, murmurs spread across the assembled militiagriffs. Sergeants from each of the militias started to come forward to speak to them, first one at a time, then in droves.

His carriage crested a small hill as the faint image of the Adelartian capital appeared in the distance. The Sheriff smiled with his scarred beak, before he heard the front carriage crunch over a twig on the road.\n\nIn an instant, shouts and shots screeched from the forest surrounding him. His head darted out of a small window, a shot barely missing him and striking one of his guards with a yelp.

This land belongs to their legacy, as decreed by the Griffonian Empire!" His ranting was drowned out by the jeers and boos around him, which only spurned the Sheriff's fury more.

The crowd cheered and surged forward against the Sheriff's ravings and dragged the netted griffon out. Merlock watched the violent exit and pondered to himself as he reloaded his flintlock. After today, Adelart would finally be free, but would it remain so?\n\nNo, not with potential looming aggressors all around them.

"You know best how to fight insurgents as an insurgent yourself, no?"\n\n"That's right!" Bertus shouted, and bursting in front of Descieux to command everyone's attention, he set it all out: "We get in touch with the border towns first and pledge to them our protection. That builds trust. Next, we recruit a few of the locals to be our informants. If any suspicious griff is in the vicinity, we'll swoop, make a good show, and capture some of the scum! Then we repeat, repeat, and Nottemagne will run out of his toadies and he'd be forced to stay put or retreat over the border.

"The ponies say, 'calm before the storm', so Madame, I shall enjoy my calm with you before we get to the real work of centralising and collecting farms so the little griff can be free! Say, five-year plans are another communist thing. Five years of your rule, and we can meet again to discuss things."\n\nThe clack of metal over his claws had him freeze. "Wait, this isn't—" he saw the cuffs "—no... Madame Descieux?"\n\nA twig snapped, and he looked to see a unicorn stepping out of the woods, his horn still glowing as the bushes around them withered away to reveal a ring of armed crouching partisans.\n\n"Sir Wood," Descieux began, taking out her own gun, "we've had enough of your ego trip. Your ideals about freedom are easy to spout when you ignore the reality of the modern mass-producing society that surrounds your dear Adelart, and it is the very decentralised—dare I say, anarchist—relations that exist among capitalists that give rise to labour's extortion... you are, frankly, a robber baron without a business." Then, nodding at the Column holding Wood up, "You three, incarcerate him. The rest, follow me back to Bergelun. We have an announcement that all Adelart must hear.""

adelart.52.d:0 ""You can kill an Adelartian body," shouted the once-great Merlock as he was dragged into Bergelun's repurposed national assembly hall, "but you cannot kill the Adelartian soul!"\n\n"Out of line," the judge said in monotone, floating by his side. "It is best not to assume your verdict ahead of time, sir."\n\nAt a dining chamber-turned-makeshift court, Merlock's beak was strapped shut. Shoved to a seat, he scanned the seats where his proud compatriots had once toasted and cheered with mirthful drinking. In their place, dry suits accompanied silent eyes whose stares accused him.\n\nHe read—or listened—between the lines of the judge's words. That was not what pained him, for out another door snaked a line of normal griffons—some he recognised from farms and little forest hamlets, the very same ones he freed years or decades ago—ready to speak ill against him, how his insistence on raids and pillages had left the would-be working class stunted, babied as helpless peasants fit only to be swooped by reaction's vultures the moment Merlock and his happy gang were out of the picture. The twenty-year high, the judge proclaimed, would finally end, with the proletariat awaking from its bandit-induced stupor.\n\nThey would awake with a beheading.\n\nThough restrained, he snapped the beak-straps to cry, "This was a coup all along! You are all sheriffs! Red sheriffs!" A beating followed, his famous bycoket ripped from his head as a penultimate emasculation. So dazed was he, that it was only at the top of the platform—now finding himself at the end of a march, in a quiet glade—that he saw the blade. Swift was the razor's justice.\n\nThe butt of a rifle delivered him to the stockings."

adelart.76.d:0 "The Falcontown raid ebbed ancient in Claudius's riveted mind, the embers of his golden age finally fading away. Hauling in tons of loot, sticking it to the Count, escaping with Merlock and the rest... those were the lovely years.\n\nThese, too, faded under the shade of an old tree, his claws aiming to unholster a pair of revolvers (which he'd stolen to replace his flintlock). It wouldn't be enough; his sharp eye detected the unusual outlines of ponies and griffons in the bushes. Instinct told him their ringleader sat right behind him: he flipped a revolver to his back. "You had the gall to murder Merlock in such mockery. Why should I give myself up to you?"\n\n"At least you can bring your proofs to court," said the voice of Bertus, "give yourself a fighting chance."\n\n"What proofs?" he said, turning around to face Bertus, spinning the other revolver in his claw. "Poor Wood couldn't even speak, let alone plead his case to... you, of all creatures! That was his mistake! He was too blinded by Greifwald to see he was sealing a deal with an Aquileian devil! Look at yourselves! You call yourselves partisans and freedom fighters, but now you're on top, you're throwing us to the gears to crush all of us in your smokestacks! You're no better than the sheriff!"\n\nAfter facing down orders from the other Merrimanes to stand down, "So, that's what I hear? Got twelve of you? I've got enough bullets for all of you! Come and take it!"\n\nMinutes later, only Bertus would leave, carrying Claudius's revolvers and a bloody bullet that'd barely scraped his wing."

adelart.77.t:0 "Unpleasant Implications"
adelart.77.d:0 ""The peasantry are themselves the bourgeoisie!" proclaimed Bois, yet another Aquileian emigre. "They've given themselves to the exploitative bandits, and that has turned them into the property-enamoured. When we ask them to give us their lands, will they not respond in violence?"\n\n"Need I remind you that Adelart is not exactly a modern state?" said Dominique the theorist-economist. "In many parts of Adelart, capitalism has either not taken hold or have been forcefully removed before the workers were even aware of their plight. We must utilise our authority to instil in them that all-important class consciousness—"\n\n"Merlock and their lot... they've tainted authority in the eyes of all Adelartians," answered local out-of-town mayor Gernsbeck. "They'll detest every master, even if it kills them."\n\nDescieux, presiding over the meeting, could only sigh. There was genial agreement among the vanguard's members, of course, yet awkward was the atmosphere when, just across the room, bedraggled representatives of cobbled-up farmers' and workers' unions sat there, taking in what may as well be veiled insults."
adelart.77.a:0 "It's truly not a peasant day nor a peasant time."

adelart.78.t:0 "First Impressions"
adelart.78.d:0 ""Here, here!" a starstruck Descieux called, unable to contain her delight as none other than Victor Allard himself, clean-clad, plodded through forest trails to see the hearty spirit of the revolution materialised in the little tree town of Klengenbam. "The two-fold task of collectivising both the agricultural and the industrial sectors is well underway here, but don't let me bore you! See the facts yourselves!" She stepped aside to let Allard behold:\n\nA bunch of loggers fell some trees with axes and a single power tool. Old imported Aquileian machines and their manuals were carted into a factory-in-the-makin. On the outskirts, confused farmers listened to repeated recordings of how they were being liberated from their landowners, though they'd already been without landowners for two decades straight.\n\n"Hmm," was all Allard could say after the brief tour. "Didn't you say that these Adelartians had a proto-communist character?" After a yes from Descieux, "Then maybe I had set my expectations too high. It's partly my fault; much of the works written about the vanguard were based on more, say, urban settings. Clearly, some growing pains must be braved, since the revolution here faces the danger of being muddled by a blind revolt from the peasants." Then, stopping to take a better look at a Descieux whose smile, for once, faltered, "What use is the vanguard commanding the farms, for example, if the farmers themselves are not given better means and knowledge on harvesting? That chainsaw-griff by the trees has the right idea, I can tell you."\n\nDescieux then bowed her head. "W-well, those points are taken, Monsieur Allard! Thank you for your presence here! With your wisdom and guidance, Adelart shall awaken soon enough!""
adelart.78.a:0 "Someone needs to translate these "dialectics" for the villages."

adelart.79.t:0 "An Artificial Lift"
adelart.79.d:0 "Descieux had ordered every citizen in the tiny village of Verstoppet for over a week, beleaguering everyone with promises of "workers' oil." Her fleet of Aquileia-made machines, tractors, and power tools had been shipped here and other similar hamlets, all with Allard's stamp of approval.\n\nBut dismayed faces flooded her vision as the Column rode another batch of machines into town, converting tributary dirt paths into proper asphalted roads.\n\n"But you're a hundred years behind!" heard Descieux. It was Limbourg again. She rolled her eyes. "We're here to lift you up, comrades, and to persist with you in the fight against—"\n\n"With us!?" yelled a griffon. The patches on her shirt indicated her Merrimane membership, but her accent signified her native Adelartian-ness. "You're repaying the blood we sacrificed by kicking us out of our homes, our farms, our own lands, for... these things!? What's a factory or a pumpjack!? My family didn't grow up in a steel box like you fancy Aquileians!"\n\n"That's the ill will of reaction speaking," Limbourg replied. "Madame Descieux here has often exposited on the merits of class consciousness. We can't let our comrades work with inferior tools when we can organise—"\n\nShouts broke out, and that griff—who quipped, "How do you like being knocked class-unconscious!?"—had just punched Limbourg cold. Descieux's bodyguards whistled for the criminal to cease as all of Verstoppet broke into an uproar already hurling insults at Descieux herself: "Traitor! Aquileian plant! Red-coated sheriff!"\n\n"What's the commotion here?" a voice she didn't want to hear spoke up. An agitated Allard had just flown to her side."
adelart.79.a:0 "Panic flowed up the stream of her heart."

adelart.80.t:0 "Allardism"
adelart.80.d:0 ""...that's the crux of my concerns," Allard finished off after a half-hour speech directed at Descieux: "As much as I am grateful to you for breaking Adelart's chains, the promise of the 'proto-communist' benefits here have been overblown. The agrarian workers here desire freedom from their oppressors, but they fail to see that said oppressors do not include us among their members. Their stubborn refusal to have us help accelerate their progress... mm, my time short, though. If you'll excuse me, I must return to Aquila. The developed proletariat back home has pressing matters I must deal with."\n\nAllard's car and entourage left Bergelun and Descieux in a cloud of dust.\n\nThe preparations to welcome Allard soon descended into obscurity and ignorance. The heart of Adelart's revolutionary paradise had been smoked out in smog, the scant few factories there vomiting out gadgets and curiosities the locals didn't understand the use for.\n\nThey yearned for their crops, their land, not their partitioning, not their being clawed over to rigid industrial districts and their mechanical wheeled automatons.\n\nThe crowd that had been commanded to welcome Allard quickly dispersed. The few that chose to stay to heckled Descieux never got the chance to do so thanks to her armed and dangerous bodyguards. Their security left the taste of bile in her mouth.\n\nPast them, she saw a Bergelun that couldn't be..."
adelart.80.a:0 "An Adelart that shouldn't be."

adelart.82.t:0 "Wither Périphérie?"
adelart.82.d:0 "Where Merlock once stood, a dishevelled Descieux took to the head of the lengthy dining table. That she was back in the public eye after some weeks of being a no-show was a surprise already, let alone the absence of her bodyguards and the lack of proper notes."\n\n"I must admit my mistakes," Descieux began; she wavered before continuing: "When I came here, I had the guidance of the most esteemed Victor Allard, who believed in total mechanised vanguardism... ahem, in turning your lands over to us as the absolute way of awakening the workers. But I did not understand you, I did not truly know you until I stepped up to your level, living and farming in the woods and fields you call home. You've shown me a comradeship that neither Allard nor the rest of Aquila's communists could ever possess."\n\n"So look at where we are now! Yes, progress among the workers cannot be made without some gears and machinery, but it was all done with your eager participation! The factories do not dominate your lands but have instead diversified them, opening Adelart up to an astounding array of careers that workers of future generations can fully benefit from, free to relish in your gains without a businessgriff looming over you to suck your earnings dry! The world looks to our tried and tested blend of a united workers' republic, a blessed union between leaves and steel that Stalliongrad themselves haven't yet achieved!"\n\n"But why keep the world looking when they can join us? Across the Périphérie lies the land of Adelart's oppressive masters! The sheriff may be dead, but another sheriff can and shall rise! Let us not waste our primes in discussion when the permanent revolution shall roll on under our wings!""
adelart.82.a:0 ""Workers of the Peripherie, to arms! To the dream!""

adelart.83.t:0 "The Inevitable Recomposition"
adelart.83.d:0 "Nothing but joy locked against grief soared in Descieux as she flew out of a train of trucks. They'd made the rounds in Aquileia's metros which she'd missed in Adelart, yet, if anything, her time away seemed to have only emboldened the would-be soldiers' resolve, as the homeless carried themselves to the convoys like bugs to light. They'd shortly run both out of trucks and the city wild with gridlock. But when they left the urban commotion and visited their first rural town, something greater lay there: an unstably warm welcome.\n\n"My two sons have been expecting you!" the first griff said, the village's de facto mayor though it was hard to tell by his thatched clothes. "They've heard of what you've done... Madame, I tried to convince them to stay at the family farm, but if they want to spend their youth in this revolution, I'd... I'll die proud!"\n\nDescieux then took a good look at his offspring: spitting images of the old father, their golden years about to be unleashed in their stoic smiles. The rumbling of idling and chattering trucks doesn't help in attracting attention—and even more recruits. She struggled just to contain the happy sorrow within, of the workers rising up... along with the necessary violence.\n\n"I am not the most eloquent of speakers on the subject of war," Descieux cried out to her growing audience (a few of whom pre-emptively saluted her), "so only this I shall say before our convoys open: Do not forget the comrades who serve behind you! Though the revolution is non-negotiable, so, too, are the lives it protects. Your fathers and mothers, your sons and daughters shall be in your eternal gratitude!""

adelart.84.t:0 ""The Young and Old Can Smile""
adelart.84.d:0 "It was a capitalist stereotype for an old communist to endlessly write dissertations no one would read, yet for the party-less Allard, that'd become bitter reality. Despite the precautions taken to hide in a secluded forest, though, a knock on the door persisted against his concentration. "Come in?", said Allard. "Hold on, Descieux? What dares you to come here?"\n\n"I'm afraid we never got to say a proper goodbye, after your, uh, premature exit," she said, sheepish still. For all his faults, Allard's presence still felt halfway holy. "What made you leave?"\n\n"You're a smart griff; I expect you to deduce that," he replied as he pushed aside a quill. "My neo-vanguard treatises lacked a proper praxis compared to your plunging yourself into Adelart's peasant trees! Yet, the cold hard facts are that you've succeeded despite my efforts. Or lack thereof."\n\nAs Allard shuffled to turn his back against her, Descieux said, "It does not have to be the end for you, Monsieur Allard. You are a genius; it would be a shame for the workers to not have your polemical abilities."\n\n"Still the great idealist, you are." He clicked his tongue, shame dripping from his beak. "I could sit here all day, arguing with you until I die... but your revolution isn't corrupt since it hasn't fallen. The young and old can smile, knowing they are secure in your claws. Aquileia no longer has need of me... but you, Madame? You are as dependable as any chairgriff can be, Descieux."\n\nShe couldn't stifle the blush on her cheeks. "Thank you... I thought I didn't need to hear that, but I did. It is a dishonour to me that you couldn't be with us once more, but maybe in time, Monsieur..."\n\nWhen she left, he spent minutes meditating after her closed door.

When she spoke and put on her glasses, though, eyes and wings widened at none other than Descieux: "From civilisation immemorial, long before the final state of capital, the farmer—the peasant—lived. In Adelart, where Allard had sent me, we lived with farmers who lived under an ostensibly free territory but were clearly not free enough to rise above subsistence or hiring themselves out to the mercy of other griffs."\n\n"I did not understand them, not at first. I had the theory and the vanguard to back it up, but my praxis had to dive deep into their world: talking with them, understanding their pains and pressures, doing the good work with them. In fact, they had already done half of the work for us, possessing co-operatives in all but name... that, my comrades, was a humbling revelation. In them, the revolution had already started; we set out to help them finish it against the tide of capitalist modernity. Should any farmer be made moot, the cities and their workers will be ready to embrace them. In the end, then, all that we asked for is more co-operatives and just enough industrialisation to arm ourselves, economically and martially, against reaction."\n\n"Thus, while I shall remain as chairgriff, the vanguard is hereby dissolved. Let us not divide the farmer and the machinist, for we are all workers... and we are all liberated. So make yourselves heard.""

adelart.36.d:0 ""It is only through the open eyes of the faithful that we shall see the claws of the dark god Maar directing the Usurper-Prelate from the shadows, and only then can we cast its malice away!"\n\nThe vociferous sermon delivered by the Prelate of Eyr, Luca vun Lissay, to an assembled congregation of hundreds of fellow Eyrite and Arcturian priests and many more hundreds of common worshippers would resonate not only within, but far beyond the stone walls of the Abbey of Lissay's chapterhouse as Luca sternly declared the excommunication of Greifwald's sitting Prelate of Boreas, Ludwig Ebonwing, branding him as a twisted Maarite amidst an eruption of applause and cheers from the masses.\n\nThe religious fervour ignited by the People's Prelate from his high altar would soon spread to every town, village and hamlet of Adelart in the form of ceaseless vigils accompanied by the ringing of temple bells in unison all across the land, grandiose religious processions attended by countless griffons extolling the gifts and principles of the three Gods, and even rumours of dissident Borean clerics having nailed Luca's declaration of excommunication along with his many treatises to the door of the Temple of Boreas in Falcontown.\n\nBut perhaps the most peculiar and daring of these displays was a popular parade held in the town of Vilistel, where a wicker effigy of the Prelate Ebonwing, its oversized body crisscrossed in streaks of black paint symbolizing his allegiance to Maar and bearing a crown of bark as well as holding a broken sword and an empty cornucopia to signify his abandonment of the Gods, was dragged around and humiliated in the streets by the townsfolk before being thrown into the river as a mock execution for all to see."

Yet, few surrendered without a fight. From isolated individuals holding hope for a Greifwaldian offensive to an entire posse holed up in the forests west of Herlein, no remnant of Adelart's shrieval past withstood the firepower and tenacity of the Sisters.\n\nWhile Sister Selena fought de Nottemagne's ghost with perhaps too much zeal, the Prelate and other religious officials denounced monarchism as a concept. De Nottemagne served the corrupt Count, who serves the wretched Archons, who serve Maar - they were all stooges, all down the line. Only the mad and power-hungry believed de Nottemagne had the best interests of the peasants at heart, let alone the interests of the Gods.\n\nAnd, before long, the last stain of Cloudet rule was wiped clean from merry Adelart, never to return."

He fumbled with his pocket watch. He still had a minute before it closed. Was his watch slow?\n\nThe Temple door clicked, unlocking, and creaked open. A griffoness peeked out. She was half a head taller than Jacques and bore a mark of the Three on her cheek. "The Temple is closed for the night," she said. "Return tomorrow."\n\nBefore Jacques could protest, another voice, earthy and old, echoed from within the Temple: "Now, Selena, all are welcome at any hour, for Their envoys come when we would shun our own kin." Selena bowed her head and stepped aside. An aged griffon appeared in the doorway. His plumage, bleached white by age and stress, glowed in the twilight. "My chick, what brings you to me at this hour?"\n\nOf course. Jacques should have realised that Venia would be here. He squeaked, "My sister is very ill. I would have been here earlier, Archon, but my work...h-here." Jacques raised his pocket watch, its lid glinting like the edge of a sword. "It's hardly an indulgence, but surely it's enough for a few minutes of prayer - "\n\nVenia took Jacques' talons in his own and closed the stop watch. "Keep thy timepiece. The Gods have gold. All they ask from you is faith." Venia smiled. In those old eyes, Jacques saw a disarming kindness, an honesty that put the sneers and greedy glares of Rila's old clergy to shame. Jacques didn't respond for a moment. Venia turned and led him into the Temple. There, they prayed until long after the Temple closed."

Eros turned to Erion's aide, who had gone white as a sheet. Eros placed a talon on her shoulder; she flinched as if struck. "I shall dictate now. Write everything you hear - from me." Eros ignored how Erion huffed, and began:\n\nIn the Names of the Kings Three, in the year of Their Ascension [GetYear], in [GetMonth], I, the Revered Archon Eros VIII, with Archon Proteus III and Erion XII as Witnesses and Their Ordained Archonate in agreement, do decree:\n\n"The 'Old Believer' cult is heretical and antithetical to proper worship of the Kings Three. Cultists suffer from delusion causing nonsensical thinking. Central to the mania is the illegitimacy of the Archonate: the prophet of lies, Venia, claims the Archonate is illegitimate, yet claims the title of Archon himself. The Old Believer cult claims the Archonate is unwanted, whilst mimicking its Holy Practices and Structure, albeit in a degenerated form. Were the Archonate unwanted by the Gods, then so too would Venia's sham congregation be unwanted.

Luca relished the opportunity to help the young, even if ladling stew was hard on his wrist. He knew many of the more eager chicks by name. Some even approached him for wisdom.\n\nHe bid farewell to Lea, to whom he quoted a passage from the Scroll of Golden Goblets to help her get along with her brother. He spotted Marco, whose father was hanged by that vicious Deputy Hunn. "Good evening, Marco," he said.\n\n"Mister Luca, aren't you doing the same thing as the Sheriff?" Marco said. "My pa liked Mister Merlock, and my ma says the Sheriff wanted him gone. Didn't you do it for him?"\n\nLuca pondered for a moment. "Your mother is half-right, but I want to put her at ease. I am not the Sheriff. No one like him will rule Adelart ever again. I promise her that."\n\n"But you're boss, ain't you? Mister Merlock wanted nobody to be the boss."\n\nLuca hummed softly and knelt so he and Marco were face to face. "Eyr teaches us that all griffons are precious, so unto them we should render kindnesses: full bellies, warm homes, and happy families. Did the Sheriff want that?" Marco shook his head. Luca smiled. "Exactly. I'm only sort of the boss. The real bosses are the Gods; I'm just following their advice." Luca rose.

Brothers, if you'd kindly," the judge said. Hunn roared in defiance, but was silenced by a strike across his jaw. The militiagriffs dragged his unconscious body out through the back of the courthouse.\n\nTwo other griffs seized the next shrieval loyalist and dragged him forward. Even through his blindfold, the judge could tell he was but a chick - and also scared out of his wits. "Ernest de Griffe, do you confess to having served under Deputy Hunn, just as he served under the late Sheriff de Nottemage?" Ernest squeaked out a yes. "For the crime of simple blasphemy against the Gods and Their Free Territory, the Trinity demands three-hundred hours in service of the communities of Adelart and mandatory temple attendance until this hour next year."\n\nThe militiagriffs removed Ernest's blindfold, revealing his confused, teary countenance. His weak knees gave out and he fell to his knees. He clasped his talons and sobbed his thanks to the judge, who only smirked and instructed the militiagriffs to help Eyr's newest chick to his feet."

Now he was being led inside it by a portly, scarred griffon as a part of the new group of 'Congressgriffs.' The griffon led them through the council chamber and almost a dozen offices until they arrived at a mostly empty canteen.\n\n"Seems most of the boys have gone home" The tour guide grumbled "Well, let's take a break here for lunch. I'm starving." With a jaunty step, he walked off towards the only other occupied table in the room.\n\nPieter shrugged and went to get some food, noting that a line was quickly forming behind him as he got a plate and went to sit down. As he returned he noted a smaller griff who was stuck at the back of the line, eying Pieter's meal hungrily. After a moment, Pieter sighed and handed the plate to the griff, who smiled up at him and skittered off before Pieter could respond.\n\nFiguring the queue would be a no-go, Pieter headed to the table the tour guide was at. He noted that he was sitting and talking with another scarred griff. This one older, missing an eye, and seemingly far less jovial.\n\n"I cannae get used to this Frere. I trust Merlock, but it just feels like everythin's changing too quickly, y'know?" The older griff stated as he picked at his own plate. "I won't deny that, Scotch. But the Boss has got us this far, hasn't he?" The tour guide responded, looking fondly at the scar on his talon. "Besides, I got a good feelin' about the idea. We just gotta give it time, give him time." He finished with a sagely nod, before taking some meat from his friend's plate.\n\nFrere, finally noticing Pieter was standing nearby, waved him over. "Are you not hungry, boyo?" Pieter shook his head, and moved to sit down. "I was, but the queue wasn't moving so I didn't want to wait." He lied, to which Scotch raised an eyebrow. "We cannae be 'avin that now, can we? I made it my mission back in the forests to ensure no Adelartian chick went hungry and by Eyr I'm not gonna start now." He said as he passed his plate over."

Luca, I'm doing what I can for you, but you have to remember I'm just one griff. If you'd kept going, those guys woulda killed you, you understand? I said I'll look into it.

But the sisters, your cause... look, everygriff in each of those towns had a right to defend those temples, but none did. What does that say for your cause?

adelart.43.d:0 "Merlock scratched his head as he looked over his new office. It was thrown together from one of the older Bergelun cottages, which meant it was cramped and barren of anything aside from a simple desk, a chair and piles upon piles of paper. Mostly unfinished documents, some simply blank pieces of paper waiting for his clawriting. \n\nSlumping into the creaky wooden chair, Merlock stared blankly at the first document of the day. One penned by himself originally, and before even getting partway through he wanted to thwack his former self right in the beak. By the time he was at the end, he had already forgotten the title. He signed it, stamped it and went to the next sheet.\n\nIt wasn’t even 10 minutes later that Merlock found himself staring out the singular dusty window of the cottage; looking through the murky glass at the trees off in the distance. He could see himself back with his merrygriffs, away from this tiny room. But with a blink, he was back trying to stare through a barely see-through window, and seeing nothing but his own reflection and the sea of paperwork surrounding him.\n\nMerlock thumped his head against the desk in frustration. The sound of the old door creaking open reached his ears. Merlock's second in command, Lil' Naylor, poked his head through. "Merlock? You in here Boss?"In his eagerness, Naylor pushed the door further, causing a stack of blank papers to tumble to the floor. Merlock raised his head slightly and waved, his weariness evident.\n\n"I could barely see you Boss," Naylor laughed, trying to sweep up the mess. "In the middle of all this I’d assumed you were an odd paperweight." Merlock groaned in response. "Nayl’, as great as it is to see you, I’m kind of...busy." Naylor placed the blank pile in front of Merlock. "That’s why I’m here Boss," He said, a sly smile on his beak. "you didn’t think you’d be stuck in this mess alone didja?

He had a rough guess at how many griffs were in the town, so knowing how much loot from the nobles that were within greifwald they had and where it was would help ensure nogriff who showed up went without. \n\nHe felt pretty proud of himself for his little system, mostly a slight improvement to Merlock’s rough guesses from intuition. But with the sweeping changes coming to all the merrygriffs and especially Merlock, he hoped that streamlining one aspect of it would ease the burden on him.\n\n"Naylor?" He turned to see one of the Merrygriffs relaxing in the sun nearby, arms weary from an earlier loot run. "Aye, Scar?" The griff eyed him tiredly. "Scarlet, Naylor. Scarlet. Anyway, I did have my doubts about this whole thing." Naylor went back to his notepad. "I know, you wouldnae stop talkin’ about it."\n\nScarlet ignored this. "I do think it’s all paying off now. It feels like we’re back to what we did even before we kicked the Sheriff out, except now we’ve not got to worry about the Greifwaldians taking potshots at us!" Naylor noted the next passing merrygriff and his crate on the notepad, and waved him on. "The rules are annoying though, I mean if I saw someone wearing the same odal as the Sheriff, why should I be punished for knocking their lights out?"\n\nNaylor sighed, and bapped Scarlet with his notebook. "Because, Scar, we shouldn’t blame griffs just for following an idiot. As annoying as it is, we’re the examples now. We should only blame the idiots."\n\nScarlet looked deep in thought for a moment, giving Naylor enough peace to continue writing for a while.

What I should've considered more, however, is Adelart's proto-communist character. The farmers and other peasants here have pooled their resources, with or without a sheriff, forming co-operatives. I'd rather build on that foundation than to obliterate it."\n\nMerlock clicked his tongue, clacked his beak. He spun his flintlock around like a revolver. "How do I know this will not be a well-organised coup?"\n\n"Because I can challenge you thus: Can you trust your free-form government to handle its armies well? How will they formulate an answer to Imperial tanks or Aquileian veterans? That's my offer: I and the Merrimane Column will whip your quivering militias into shape. They excel in your brand of guerrilla warfare but can also be a standing army when need be. They've had much experience, dating back to the First Aquileian Revolution.

As Merlock’s Merrygriffs began to shout back, Naylor held up a talon to silence them as Merlock leaned over the Prelate.\n\n"Ludwig. You stand as the antithesis of everything we strive for. You are the pinnacle of Greifwaldian greed, of reaction and of cowardice." With a rarely seen anger in his voice Merlock continued. "You steal from the griffs around you, and give naught but false promises in return."\n\n"You speak of unity and faith, but you betray not only your own kind but the gods themselves. You preach a message of charity, and yet you take from everygriff within the Periphery." Merlock was shaking slightly, but showed no signs of stopping. "When I was a chick, I would have followed you into Eyr’s embrace, but now I can’t wait to see you in Tartarus."\n\nWhen the Prelate spluttered in return, Merlock turned and nodded to his griffs. "Ludwig. As punishment for your crimes, you are to be dragged to Trinity Hill and hung in the Great White Temple of Boreas." A rush of movement followed, as the anarchists grabbed the Prelate from under his bound wings.\n\nThe Prelate opened his beak to complain, only to be struck and dragged from the chamber.

After a day of taking in the recovery of the city and enjoying the beach, he went to pay his respects in the Grand Temple of Arcturius with Naylor.\n\nBoth were silent on the steps up, partly out of respect and partly because of the poor choice they both made in walking, rather than flying, up such a tall temple. But once they were at the top, Naylor stopped. After a few steps, so did Wood. "Boss, are you alright?" Wood turned, confused. "Why do you ask, Nayl?" \n\nNaylor sat on the top step and shrugged, before Wood sat next to him. "I dunno Boss, everythings changed so quickly, and it feels like the speed of it all has just..."

adelart.28.d:0 "Once the last of the towns' council members finally arrived in Bergelun, the first session of the Federal Council of Adelart officially commenced. Fervent discussion and debates began after introductions had concluded, but rather than a simple day's time, the assembly carried on for nearly a week. As it turns out, there was much to discuss regarding the matters of the newly created government. The Federal Council, to every councilmembers' credit, stuck through until a stopping point was reached. Though many topics and points remained unresolved, the Federal Council had managed to reach a few unanimous verdicts to be implemented.\n\nFirst and foremost, the role of national leader was to be regulated to that of a mere figurehead to prevent any future holders from trying to abuse the government and centralized themselves into a despot. The elected figurehead would instead provide guidance and advocate their beliefs, but of course, but the ultimate decision would fall upon the votes of the decentralized Federal Council.\n\nSecondly, every town's representative council would be formalized into "Cantons" and ascribed provincial areas under their jurisdictions. What these areas would encompass and whether the towns would combine jurisdictions with each other was up to the respective Cantons, though everygriff seemed to agree that sharing provincial responsibilities with neighboring towns would lessen administrational burdens.\n\nFinally, with the inclusion of new lands and towns, the Free Territory of Adelart would be renamed to show the authenticity of the Federal Council's efforts to transition from a landscape of merry rogues to an actual representative state with a committed bureaucracy.\n\nAll in all, not a bad start for a first assembly, minus the sleepless nights; end-of-day closing times would need to be established during the next meet if all councilmembers were to represent with the best of ability."

Now with so many joining the streamlined ranks of the Aquileian Confederation of Cantons, another new age was taking form across the land. Time, however, extracts its toll on even the most legendary individuals of Adelart, and the respective resignation letters from the nation's two opposing political bloc leaders eventually made the headline news.\n\nPrelate Luca vun Lissay, already elder in age when Adelart began, was now just about archaic, and a simple retirement to live out his years in peace was what anygriffon as old as he would have wanted. Though no longer the national figurehead, Luca nowadays tends to his hometown, preaching sermons and offering words of wisdom to the next generation.\n\nAs for Merlock Wood, age may have forced him to retire away from the political scene, but it could never quell the griffon's restless spirit. The last anycreature had officially seen the bandit hero was when he was returning to Adelart's original region, but once in awhile there would be a report of some corrupt dignitary travelling about and suddenly realizing they had been separated from their ill-gotten gains. The locals collectively resolved to generally pay no mind to these scandals.\n\nAll the while, the beneficent and glorious confederation the both had given so much to build grew on. Aquileian elements were of no doubt bound to arise within the system, but the Federal Council had been made to successfully adapt and fittingly accommodate such. This tried and tested bastion now stood upon Griffonia's continental stage – one still rife with conflict and bloodshed – and no Adelartian was naïve enough to believe these aggressors would just simply leave their nation alone. Until such a day dawned, Adelartians from all backgrounds would live, grow, be merry, and thrive. May they embrace every moment they will have, of joys and of hardships, up until the very end."

adelart.29.d:0 "While Merlook Wood and his comrades strive to maintain a decentralized system of governance where every griffon can truly decide how to live in this socialist society by themselves, not all prominent, allegedly, socialist ideologues and local figures within the borders of Adelart maintain the same mentality. These so called "Vanguardists" cast a shadow across the country, trying to convince the workers and farmers of Adelart that a strong socialist state is needed to create a true utopia of the lower classes. These extremist madmen desire to turn Adelart into but another Stalliongrad or Prywhen, a shackled state, even if robed in red.\n\nWhile these agitators and extremists were initially willing to seek a compromise with more anarchist and libertarian elements within the movement which would lead to the independence of Adelart and has now coalesced into the socialist coalition, and even helped with the original rebellion against the tyrant sheriff and his Greifwaldian overlords, this has changed. While some claim that the actions of these vanguardists, even if somewhat widespread, wouldn't have any effect on the country and it's inhabitants. After all they didn't have the effect in the last few decades, so what would change now? However, Merlook Wood is unwilling to just allow this to continue, especially now that these extremists are far more prominent and even willing to criticize the current system as "betrayal of the socialist ideal" and the ruling coalition.\n\nThus, even with heavy heart, the Woodists drove the statist extremists out of any and all leadership positions, and even in some cases, pushed them out beyond the borders of Adelart with force of arms."
adelart.29.a:0 "A commendable move."

adelart.30.t:0 "The Principle of Left Nationalism"
adelart.30.d:0 "While many other socialist thinkers and leaders believed and promoted the idea that the working class does not have a nation. They claimed that nations are but arbitrary constructs, yet another symptom of the eternal conflict between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. However, the hero of the Adelartian revolution and war of independence, Merlock Wood, does not hold the same opinion. After all socialism was an Equestrian ideology in origin, created in a realm where most citizens perceived themselves as part of a whole, a single realm forged millenniums ago. Griffonia and the kingdoms and empires that rose were forged through violence, subjugation and even in many cases destruction of languages and cultures.\n\nWith such historical circumstances it would seem truly absurd for griffon socialists to desire to abandon their culture, language and in many cases faith. After all in Griffonia, it's the bourgeoisie that seek such destruction, while the proletariat, the farmers and workers, desire to maintain these ties. Thus it could be argued, and Merlock Wood and his allies do, that in the context of Griffonia, nationalism isn't a symbol of radical right, rather it can also be the symbol of the workers liberation. After all it was this cultural association, together with the old believer faith that, based on which the workers of Adelart were so ready to mobilize against the oppressors from Greifwald.\n\nFurthermore, while most socialists are heavily utopian in their beliefs and think that some sort of hypothetical continental or even world socialist republic would be equal in fair to all, we are sceptical of such outcomes. After all, without any differentiation or inner borders, does that not mean that even in a socialist state, richer and more developed regions would simply dominate the lesser ones?"

adelart.59.t:0 "A Vote Of No Confidence" #Ardent Custodian
adelart.59.d:0 "He should've expected this. He really should have expected this. The (in)famous bandit hero of Adelart was many things from charismatic to guile, but if there was one thing the Prelate knew about Merlock Wood, it was that the griffon was reactionary. Here and now in Adelart's woods, the old griffon was proven correct.\n\n"Temperance, Merlock, temperance," the Luca said, "I honestly thought you would foresee this being a possibility."\n\n"After everything I've done for Adelart?! All I've risked and sacrificed?!" Merlock flung another throwing knife into the nearby tree.\n\n"You act as if they sentenced you to death."\n\n"No, you don't have a say," Merlock seethed with a pointed talon, not even bothering to look at the Prelate, "I bet you even organized the vote in the first place to take charge."\n\nLuca's staff knocked aside the talon with a thwack, causing the off-guard Merlock to yelp. The Prelate bore into the bandit. "You've been nothing but a valiant thief for decades, Wood, longing for the thrill of adventure that often landed you into a fight. Even after another victory against Greifwald, when Adelart was ready to rebuild itself, what did you do instead? You're out here gallivanting in the woods. You could barely stand the makeshift government prior. So, tell me, Merlock, what have you done to win over this new Adelart's confidence for being responsible and stable? Or are you going to lead a bandit rebellion against this government too?"\n\nThis time Merlock shot a glare at Luca before going to retrieve his throwing knives embedded in the nearby tree. "So what am I to do now, mister elected figurehead?"\n\n"Buy a home? Enjoy retirement?" Luca shrugged, turning to leave, "Go about your life as usual? Maybe even reconvene with your political party and learn how to properly manage it within the Federal Council? Do whatever, Merlock, but do so knowing you need not worry for Adelart's future anymore. I pray the best for you...and I wish you goodbye.""

Alezette asked.\n\n"Well for one, you can vote on whether or not the nation decides to audit your organizations," Remich said.\n\n"Hah, let it be done! The Municipal Bands of Vilistel and the Guild of Vilistel Infrastructure are very just and humble service groups dedicated towards the community. Those Eyrist conservatives won't find anything lacking!"\n\n"Then which one will you be representing on our town Canton?"\n\n"I can't represent both?"\n\nAcross the table, Wiltz lowered his head in exhaustion. As Vilistel's deputy, he had gathered every local figurehead he could find and brought them to the town hall – the biggest tavern in town – and sat them down to finally decide upon who would serve as councilmembers to represent their home on the Federal Council. Many other towns across the nation's new and old provinces had already selected their new Cantons comprised of their own local groups, leaving but a few towns that still haven't remaining. Be it the town of Vilistel that so happen to be one of them...\n\nThe most elderly griffon at the table spoke up, "Does Griffon Garments need more than one representative?"\n\nThe discussions around the table quickly faded out of respect, and the deputy raised his head. "No, Mrs. Moselle," Wiltz assured, "You are more than capable of representing your charity on your own if you'd like."\n\n"Thank you, mister deputy, so very kind of everycreature."\n\n"Does that mean I need another griffon to join the Municipal Bands?" Alezette asked. The deputy a suppressed groan and mumbled a prayer to the gods above."

He has pointed at the Adelartian victory as proof of his country's worth and has demanded international recognition, of which Flowena has already given. With this comes the full integration of Greifwald lands and the extension of the Adelartian rights to Greifwald citizens.\n\nHowever, his actions have not gone without critics. Opponents see his invasion as a breach of Greifwald's sovereignty, and his actions as those of a tyrant. One such opponent was Alexandra Descieux, the leader of the Vanguards.\n\n"This is not a liberation," she claimed, "This is a prize he has given to himself, and he will suck Greifwald dry of its resources while preventing the citizens from enjoying any of the spoils."\n\nWhen hearing this, he merely chuckled and stated:"

adelart.45.d:0 "Jaume de Conard strolled into the National Assembly, a remodel of the original Adelart congress hall. Mold had been removed, lights had been installed, and the wood chairs were all replaced with soft, leather thrones. All paid by the generous donations of businesses across the country. 'Twas a small price for the new republic.\n\nDe Conard walked up to the central chair up against the wall, remodeled to be a few steps higher than the other council chairs. His own throne for his own personal kingdom, something greater than a simple company built off the prestige of his family. He rubbed his talon against the smooth wood divider that separated his chair from all the others. What would Merlock think seeing all of these changes to his congress hall, Jaume wondered.\n\nWell, it didn’t matter. Merlock was living a nice retirement on a farm in Lissay, all organized by Jaume himself.\n\n"Are you okay, sir?" Jaume’s secretary asked from behind, shaking him out of his concentration."\n\n"I-it's nothing. Our party won the majority, right? Who was the runner up?" he directed the conversation. His eyes kept glancing at his leather assembly chair, however.\n\n"Alexandra of the Vanguards. She holds 15% of the votes. Her vanguards managed to get 4% of the assembly seats."\n\nDe Conard nodded. He pulled his focus away and walked towards the entrance of the hall. "Just what I was expecting."\n\n"Should I make arrangements for their arrest?" the secretary asked.\n\nJaume waved for her to follow and shook his head. "No, we’ve done enough meddling. This is a republic, after all. In fact... get in contact with Alexandra. See if she wants to be a part of my cabinet."\n\nThe secretary stopped and released an unconscious gasp from her beak. "Sir, she is a vanguardist."\n\nTo tycoon president chuckled. "What do they say? Keep your friends close and your enemies closer? Something like that. Besides, it’ll be fun.""

They were cutthroat, ruthless capitalists who knew how to manage their markets. They were...\n\nIdiots.\n\nHis new chamber representatives were all idiots. One had a cigar in his beak. Another was filing her talons. Very few paid attention to Jaume, much less the responsibilities they were expected to fill. Half of the representatives weren't even here, all sending letters to Jaume's secretary with excuses ranging from sickness to flat-out boredom.\n\nAnd that was exactly what Jaume wanted.\n\nHe had the entire chamber in his claws. With no griffons putting up a fight or having a desire other than money, that had given Jaume the most executive power he could ask for.\n\nHe stood up from his seat and spoke, "To support decreasing taxes, say aye."\n\n"Aye," the room responded.\n\n"To start a campaign encouraging consumer spending, say aye."\n\n"Aye."\n\n"To increase executive power, say aye.""

adelart.48.d:0 "Officials from the newly formed Republic of Adelart have come to us with a mutually beneficial agreement. Seeing as how the Aquileian military has situated itself near the Pomoverran and Greifwald borders, they have pointed to the need for our two nations to guarantee one another's independence in response to a potential invasion.\n\nHowever, that does not come without a price. They have required the return of resource rights in Lissay before any papers can be signed. While this is not ideal, we would do much better together in the face of an Aquileian invasion.\n\nSo, do we return their oil in exchange for protection, or do we weather the Aquileian storm alone?"

adelart.61.t:0 "The Sharpest Thorn" #Endbeats
adelart.61.d:0 "Merlock’s grip on the country was no more, and Jaume had enough intelligence on the Vanguard to prevent any attempted coup. However, Prelate Luca and his "Sisters of Eyr" were the sharpest thorn in his side. Merlock was a brilliant tactician, but his age and exhaustion weakened him. Alexandra was a smart and fiery individual, but she was too young and inexperienced to be a problem.\n\nLuca, however? His age only made him smarter, sharper, and more passionate than anyone Jaume had met. The Sisters caught his spies within hours of planting them. Any arrest attempts were foiled with legal loopholes. It didn't matter what Jaume did, Luca was always a few steps ahead.\n\nDe Conard looked out his window. There was only one path left: a literal law banning them. He had to strike at the heart, where no legal loopholes could be exploited. He originally planned to use a "State Secularization" law, but he knew Luca would find some excuse to avoid arrest.\n\nSo, he created a law as simple and direct as possible: "The Sister of Eyr and Prelate Luca Ban Act." A law giving the president, the police, and even the military the ability to arrest the group known as the Sisters of Eyr and its leader, Prelate Luca. And it did not mean the group in name, but in substance as well. Any change of the group’s name would not protect them from arrest. And in their place? Prelate Ebonwing. A fool whose mind was filled with nothing but religious conviction. Hardly a threat.\n\nAuthoritarian? Yes. Effective? Tartarus yes.\n\nJaume sat and sighed in relief. It was finally over. His police would be at the temples soon enough and arrest Luca, and riot squads were already setting up in preparation for a civilian revolt. He grabbed the bottle of wine from the edge of his desk and prepared to open-\n\nSuddenly, the door to his office opened, revealing his secretary. She breathed heavy and gasped for air while her eyes looked at Jaume in exasperation. A telegram rested in one of her claws. De Conard’s heart sank as he translated the message in her eyes.\n\n"He’s disappeared, hasn’t he?"\n\nThe secretary nodded her head."

Continue to keep me updated on the situation," de Conard replied with a nod.\n\nThe general turned his eyes away, however, and sighed. "Actually, sir, there are a few problems, especially with garrisons at Greifwald. The place is rampant with passionate anarchists. Berniers, they call themselves. They continue to wage a guerilla campaign against our troops. Accompanying them are a large number of Maarites who have been giving us a similar headache."\n\nDe Conard raised his eyebrow. "It’s like some unholy parallel universe."\n\nThe general nodded. "We believe that we could have both sides turn-"\n\n"Kill them."\n\nThe general was taken aback. "Sir?"\n\nJaume stood up from his desk. "If this is like twenty years ago, I don't plan to be another Sheriff. Go and burn some trees, get them out in the open, then shoot them down. Use tanks, flamethrowers, bombs — anything that will destroy the forests they hide in."\n\nThe general's beak was wide open. "But sir, aren't they just civilians?"\n\nThe oil tycoon took a cigarette out from his jacket pocket and lit it up. "It's fine, general. It's just a little... self-defence.

The freshest meat, vegetables, and bread they could find were all wrapped up and brought over to the manor of the former Iron Chancellor, now nothing more than a summer home. One fat griffon grabbed a leg of some unidentifiable animal and proceeded to chomp on it, only to spit out a few pieces of rubble that had fallen on it from the ceiling.\n\n"We could’ve waited after this city was cleaned up before eating here, you know?" the businessgriff complained to Jaume. The oil tycoon said nothing, instead smoking a cigarette as he stood on a pile of stone that had fallen from the ceiling. He stared through the opening in the side of the house that provided a window to the fallen city.\n\nThe skyscrapers that Skyfall was known for were like giant tombstones, silent and monolithic in nature. One had fallen yesterday, leaving a pile of concrete and iron in the streets. Not that it mattered to anygriff. The whole city center was a deadzone. The usual sounds and sights — griffons laughing, cars horking, shopkeepers advertising — all of it was replaced with an eerie atmosphere. The once bustling city of Skyfall was now a city of silence.\n\nAnd it was all his. Jaume released a breath of smoke.\n\n"Gentlegriffs, we have inherited the jewel of Griffonia. Thanks to the sacrifices of our soldiers, we now hold one of the most profitable, if not the most profitable city in the world."\n\nJaume stepped down the pile, then picked up a chair off the ground. "However, I ask you: Was it worth the deaths? The millions of casualties? The loss of the simple griff in pursuit of more profit?"\n\nHe dropped the chair at the end of the table and looked at the others. The thump of the chair against the floor released more rubble from the ceiling, dirtying the floor of the once-beautiful manor even more. Jaume's stare filled the other businessgriffs with bewilderment and uncertainty.\n\nBut after a few more seconds, the corners of his beak finally curved upwards and he released a chuckle. The others slowly join in laughter as the tension broke and their uneasiness subsided. "Of course it is worth it!" he exclaimed.\n\nDe Conard popped open the champagne and blew out the dust from an empty glass before pouring himself some of the bubbly alcohol. He then raised it to the laughing griffons at the ruined table."

Multiple strings had to be pulled to hire chefs of the highest regard from Aquileia – including covering all costs of housing, transportation, and instillation – but thanks to that, the greatest pastry chef in Rila was currently baking a plethora of crepes and croissants in the hall’s kitchen.\n\nJaume also hired the talent of Octavia and her string quartet, much to his amazement. He would have given up half his coffers just to hear her play, but to have her at his banquet? Jaume couldn't help but smile. He closed his eyes for a moment and relished in the beautiful melodies that danced around the room.\n\nIndeed, every aspect of tonight was organized by de Conard himself, supervised and constructed in such a way that the tycoons would have nothing to criticize – other than one another, of course. Jaume too fixed the seating order in such a way that gossip would engulf the room like a flood. All he had to do was move familiar businessgriffs a table away from one another, and rumors would flow from the beaks of everygriff like waterfalls. And thanks to his waiters, Jaume knew everything. There are only a few things better than gold, and gossip was one of those.\n\nDe Conard stepped up from his seat and raised his glass.

After a few seconds, Jean flicked open an old faulty lighter and bent over towards the flag, carefully lighting the edge of it before standing back up and watching it carefully.\n\nAs the flames slowly crawled up the flag, so too did the torches thump against the hall. A set of screeches filled the air as the flag slowly turned to ash. By the time it was done, the hall was completely ablaze and those inside were silenced at last.\n\nWith a brief smile, Jean turned and left with his posse in tow. There was nothing else for them here."

adelart.91.d:0 "Luca stood in the center of the burning city, the battle for Griffenheim still raw. Buildings broken, streets torn, glass shattered, bricks disintegrated - and yet the Archon's vain temple stood amid the chaos, untouched and unyielding. Despite Luca's commands, there wasn't a single chink in the walls of the temple.\n\nThe Prelate fell to the ground and bemoaned. "Eyr, why have you allowed such a mockery of your existance to remain? Why have you allowed the temple of the heathens to stand above the fires of this wretched unholy land?"\n\nPerhaps... he was wrong? A momentary intrusive thought drilled to Luca's core. He gasped in horror at what his mind came up with. He put his head against the broken street and prayed, "Forgive me, Eyr. Forgive me for my judgement. Though not intentional, my thoughts have brought a greater disgrace to your name than anything these Griffonians have done."\n\nHe brought his head up and opened his eyes, and to his amazement, he saw it through the smoke. The figure of Eyr. Its otherworldly, warm talons surrounding the temple. Eyr's head resting on its roof. Another moment passed, and it was gone.\n\nPrelate Luca felt tears fall down his cheek. His calling was not to destroy. It had never been. Eyr wanted him to rebuild. Renovate. Change the beliefs of the heathens, not fight them. How long had he ignored Eyr's truth?\n\n"The temple will not fall," he muttered to both himself and Eyr, "It will not fall because you have delivered it to me. It shall be recreated in your image, my Lord. A place for Griffons to hear from your followers and to pray to you, not to an Archon."\n\nThe old griffon pushed himself back up, though the cracks of age echoed in his joints. "This temple shall serve as a beacon to those who need you. Your light and love will flood out through this temple. No longer will these griffons go to an Archon to talk to some idol. No, now they will talk to you directly, and this temple will teach them that."\n\nPrelate Luca hobbled to the entrance of the temple. "But first, let's assess what needs to be done.""

The haggard eyes and their worn-out equipment begged for rest... or rejuvenation straight from the beak of their chairgriff.\n\n"When the embers of counter-revolution burned any semblance of childhood peace, I set out to set my life aside for my fellow workers, yet I had never imagined that we would topple the core of Griffonian imperialism! But for all their faults, the Grovers lucked out on one tenet: to unite a people." A pregnant pause later, "While the Grovers, with their fragile power, blinded themselves to the struggles of the workers and farmers, we stand at your beck and call, armed with an inexhaustible arsenal to empower you and your comrades abroad! As the world bleeds in yet more selfish wars, in yet more capitalist contradictions, their weary appendages and eyes shall turn to the centre of Griffonia and see unity, a unity that is blind to race and nationality. It only asks for the labouring class... and how potent is that request! For those who've deserted to us did so because they see the means for an unstoppable and successful revolution!"\n\n"I shall end today with this command to the workers of Griffonia and beyond: Look to us! Set your eyes upon what has transpired here! What we have started, continue with us in lockstep, and never cease!"\n\nCelebratory claps and screeches aside, Descieux flinched when a bespectacled face amid the sea of cheerers stood still, locking eyes with her. His open beak firmed up, resolving itself into an acknowledging nod, one that said, "You've done it, girl."\n\nShe mouthed, "You came back," and watched Victor Allard nod once more before he vanished into the mass of soldiers.

adelart.95.d:0 "Before the war, the streets of Griffenheim were filled with cheer and jubilee. A celebration of a just reconquest to relight the dwindling flame of the dying Empire, to stave off the shackles of decline and dissolution for a while longer. It didn’t take too long for attitudes to change, as the enemy thought of as weak had shattered their armies, flattened their industry and bombed their homes. No matter their intentions, such an impression was sure to last.\n\nThe streets were almost silent in the days after the surrender, aside from the faint crackling of far off fire and hum of vehicles. The bridges to the Imperial Palace lay in ruins, and the Palace itself had suffered substantially as a result of the fierce fighting therein. It sat abandoned in the centre of Griffenheim, a symbol of the beating heart of an Empire in shambles.\n\nBarely a week had passed when a collection of griffons, wearing pins of the Adelartian tree, toured the gardens surrounding the palace, taking notes about every shell hole, body and damaged wall. Eventually they left, and the residents were briefly left again with their thoughts and each other.\n\nThey returned soon after, bringing supplies and engineers. Some led the repairs of urgently needed infrastructure and the Palace, while others handed out food and water to the local residents. Their arrival was met with cautious optimism, with tales of similar events by the Confederation in the South-West of the Herzlands bolstering the hope of those wishing for relief.\n\nAfter a few months the Imperial Palace was restored enough to be considered safe to work in. A celebration was held in the relatively restored gardens, ending with the proclamation of the ‘Griffonian Confederation of Cantons’ and the announcement that the new member state of the ‘Canton of Griffenheim’ would house its capital, with the Imperial Palace housing the Canton’s council.\n\nIt would take time but, through their efforts, cheer returned to the streets of Griffenheim."

adelart.96.t:0 "Jaume's Legacy"
adelart.96.d:0 "Griffenheim. The city of the great Griffonian Empire. Or rather, the former Griffonian Empire.\n\nJaume de Conard walked down the red carpet in the throne room, towards the singular throne at the end. Its original owner unseated, the large chair sat empty as if it were begging to be filled. Bits of sunlight from the stained-glass windows above struck parts of the gold on the chair, making it seem even more magnificent — and more melancholy.\n\nJaume continued the path until he stood only a few feet away from the throne. It had aged, no doubt, but it still held the magnificence he always imagined. On the throne sat a soft, red silk cushion, perfect in every way. Four straight legs held up the chair, wooden in substance but profound nonetheless in its smoothness. Fractals of gods and griffons etched the edges of the throne, telling stories of an empire's birth that was now gone.\n\nDe Conard never expected Adelart to grow so big. To go beyond what he could ever dream of. This was something that his family could never give to him.\n\nPerhaps that what he always wanted. Not gold or profit, but a chance to earn something rather than to have it be given to him.\n\nThe griffon turned around and sat on the throne. His throne. The throne he had earned. Years of dedication had led him to this moment, taking the city of the strongest empire in the world.\n\nHe thought about pulling out a cigarette and his muscle memory brought his talon to his jacket, but he froze and put his claws down. He instead closed his eyes and rested on the armrests, feeling the sun hit his feathers.\n\nJaume had always wanted more. More gold, more profit, more friends, more land. He had always worked hard to get more and fill his life with more things. However, sitting on this throne, he felt content. He had gotten the one thing he always wanted: evidence of his legacy, not his family's. And for that, he didn't need anything else.\n\nGold was still nice, though."

adelart.97.d:0 "Well, this had gotten out of claw rather quickly.’ Thought Merlock as he, alongside a contingent of aged merrygriffs, entered the Grover Dynasty’s throne room. Sat in front of him was a lone throne, seemingly untouched since the evacuation of the Last Grover.\n\nHe tore his eyes off of it, it’d served its purpose just as its owners did. He could see Naylor and Frere exploring the room, admiring the craftsmanship of every abandoned relic and regalia, seemingly with respect rather than following Descieux’s ‘polite’ request to ‘Ransack and burn the symbol of reaction.’\n\nMerlock could hear them both excitedly talk about when and how each relic was made, and it made him pause. He turned back to the throne and examined it closely, noting the intricate details of long gone griffons and their tales of valor. The way Boreas’ sun at midday hit it just right to almost bring these tales to life, the way the throne seemed to carry a presence even when unoccupied. It showed the great care and effort taken by a humble few griffs for a passion they shared with a select few.\n\nAnd now he had it in his control. Not just the symbol of a far-off hated empire, but the culmination of decades of experience and care.\n\nMerlock could burn it, tear down the palace and permanently scar the image of the dying empire. Or he could sit on the throne and wear the title he had despised. Those were the two options expected of any would-be conqueror. But perhaps he could make another way.\n\nHe was shaken out of his thoughts by the realization that both Frere and Naylor had sat alongside him admiring the throne. They were silent now, both very familiar with the look on Merlock’s face. He chuckled, and placed a claw on both of their shoulders."

adelart.100.t:0 "One For The Road"
adelart.100.d1:0 "Off the beaten path of Eagleton sat an unassuming tavern, one every patron rarely visited but always enjoyed. Though it was usually filled to the brim, it didn’t take long for Merlock to find a comfortable wooden table to sit. Taking a sip from his filled glass, he leaned back against the wall of the tavern, feeling the muffled chaos within.\n\nHe laughed, letting himself enjoy the familiar feeling of the tavern. The cold Eagleton breeze contrasted nicely with the warmth through the tavern wall, helping to keep Merlock’s meditative mood as he held a pen to his beak in thought. He stared down at the sheet of paper lying on the table, a bare letter stared back.\n\nThe world seemed to fade away in Merlock’s mind as he thought of the last time he’d been here with Luca decades ago. Before the old griff fully swore off beer, and swore at anyone offering. He could recall the familiar nature of the tavern, the sounds of it’s celebrations, the smells of it’s beverages and most importantly the feeling of pride and excitement.\n\nIt wasn’t until Merlock felt a claw on his shoulder that he noticed the empty mug he’d likely been trying to drink out of for the past few minutes. He turned, seeing Naylor hold a full mug towards him and shaking it lightly at him. Listlessly snagging it from Naylor, Merlock looked down at the paper again, still as bare as it was the last time, and sighed.\n\n‘Dear Prela-’\n\nNo, too fancy. ‘Dear Luca’? Considering how he kicked Luca out, might not be the best bet. ‘Deares-...’ It didn’t take long for the page to fill with crossed out introductions, all stopping and starting without any followup. He flipped the paper, and put his thoughts out of his mind. If simplicity wasn’t working, perhaps sincerity would."
adelart.100.d2:0 "Off the beaten path of Eagleton sat an unassuming tavern, one every patron rarely visited but always enjoyed. Though it was usually filled to the brim, Merlock found himself at his favorite outside table to sit. Taking a sip from his filled glass, he leaned back against the wall of the tavern, feeling the muffled chaos within.\n\nHe let himself laugh for a second, this place was still exactly the same as it was so long ago. He could remember the shocked look on Luca’s face when he showed him here, turning what would have been a boring slow meeting about independence to a raucous night of declarations and drinking. Merlock wouldn’t have been surprised if Luca had never touched alcohol before that, considering how poorly he handled his drink.\n\nMerlock held two claws up between his eyes and the sun. Two mugs of beer! That’s all it took, and the pretentious old griff who’d been prattling on about belief was shouting fury against Greifwald and its Sheriffs. Oh it was a sight for the ages, he could still feel the bruise on his wing from Luca’s cane after he caught Merlock giggling during his speech.\n\nWith a satisfied sigh, Merlock took a deep swig and finished his glass. He placed it down, surprised as he heard the clinks. Had there always been so many empty glasses there? Shaking his head, Merlock felt the chill of the night air flit through his wings. He shivered, and went to stand up, only to hear a voice he hadn’t heard in years.\n\n"Figured I’d find you wing-deep in booze, Merlock." Merlock froze, looking up to the empty patio to find the source of the noise. Even the mirth inside seemed to stop, or had it already done so? Merlock felt a cold touch at his side, turning he saw Luca sat beside him. He looked none the worse for wear since Merlock last saw him, black eye notwithstanding. \n\nMerlock just stared at Luca, unable to speak. He couldn’t tell if it was the drink or the shock that hit him more, but either way Luca barely acknowledged him. Merlock slumped back down and leaned back against the tavern wall again, mentally preparing himself for the torrent of assault that would come from Luca’s beak.\n\nHe wasn’t prepared for the look Luca gave him. One that told a thousand words in a single second. Of disappointment and understanding. Of concern and pride...Of fury and of forgiveness. Merlock felt a lump in his throat as years of apologies tried to surge forth all at once, only to be stopped as he blinked and felt a thumping in his skull.\n\nMerlock opened his eyes to Eyr’s morning sun glaring down at him, his form slumped against the tavern wall. He picked up his hat, only to find a bill pinned to the front of it. Rubbing his eyes, he looked at the amount he owed the tavern, only to find a small note in the corner of it:"

adelart.101.t:0 "Iconoclasm"
adelart.101.d:0 "When Griffenheim had been taken, Jean flew in immediately to see the scene of finished fighting, sundered streets, and toppled temples. One image, a graven one, had been the subject of his mania: that cursed Idol of Boreas, the mute and dumb culprit the Grovers used to justify the sending of millions to their deaths like lemmings. Their wretched "legitimacy" was passed down to any wannabe emperor-replacement; they saw in that hunk of gold so much power, it may as well be The Ponish Wand of Suicidal Brainwashing.\n\nThe order to destroy everything depicting the Idol had garnered Jean suspicious looks. The act made him look like a bandit, another Merlock Wood who sought to wreck everything in sight for something as ambiguous as "freedom". Still, for lack of a better term, this Idol worship was idolatrous. Did the Idol heal? Did the Idol save? Could the Idol save this godless continent? Broken windows like stained-glass kaleidoscopes answered those questions.\n\nThe unification wars were finished, at least for now. Already, schools and temples were teaching exceptionalism, a trusting in yourself: the Gods made you not to sit around beneath some tree and wait for food to fall down from the heavens and the branches. The Creators provided the means and the ability for their creation to do the work. A proactive faith and a proactive sheriff for a proactive state.\n\nNo more degeneration, for it was no king nor emperor with an inherited throne but a humble sheriff that got here by naught but grit: the model for every respectable Griffonian."

adelart.102.d:0 ""It will never replace the pain, the hatred," rang Jean's words across the rumble of a little jeep. They wheeled across verdant fields toward the sunset, his vitriol directed at a Wood tied at the back, lumped with his dear and disarmed friends.\n\nThirty years, running and hiding. The bandits, let out to infest the world with empty promises. They produced enough mirth and cheer to delay the unstoppable. Jean could taste the fear in the air, all the way from the driver's seat, tinged with defiance. Most of the lot were stubborn, so they'd been gagged so as to not fill his head with insults.\n\nThe villages glowed like the burning sky. Farms became ash, grass became dust. Most of Wood's friends had holes in their heads. Still gagged.\n\n"You've been dead griffs walking," Jean said. " Greifwald will breathe free once more and the sorry lot you've held hostage will find out that playtime's over."\n\nA back-clawed shot of a revolver. Surely, that was Claudius or Yolanda. A look back: bullet cut through both heads in one trip. Wood slumped in one drawn out sigh. The oranges overhead darkened, the curtains closing on all his merriment.\n\n"Nowhere to hide now. Haven't you little thieves learned? After all these years?" Jean spun a flintlock, targeted at his decades-long tormentor. Another spin, letting Merlock know it used to be his own. Wood's holster had never felt so forsaken. "Capture civilians and small fry like them all you want... but if you can't beat the sheriff?""

Plumes of smoke surrounded her, the corpses of scrapped-up tanks that occasionally stank of flesh.\n\nIn the sheriff's wake, more smoke rose, the throes of burning false temples. The ragged in their poor threads had fled from the threat of being skewered to pieces. A mercy. Leave it to the griffs of the holy cloth to turn their spirits back to Eyr. He was content with the role the Gods had given him: Their Judge, Their Jury, Their Executioner.\n\n"May Eyr curse you and what will you do to us, you hangman of Cloudet!"\n\nHe put in the blackpowder. "Will you say where he is?"\n\n"No, I w—"\n\nShe slumped over, dead. The others snapped their heads at him through the gunsmoke. "She wouldn't betray him even if we had her strapped to a chair and beat her with a sledgehammer," he said. He jerked a claw toward the latest corpse; a few underlings carried her away. "Just a few miles and that's the border out of Greifwald. You boys have searched every single forest, flushed out every hiding spot and shrine of Luca. You'd think he'd be doing chaplain work for his soldiers. No sign. Know what that means?" A wicked smirk flashed across his beak. "Treason. Abandoned his flock. He might as well be dead to us.""

adelart.104.d:0 "The last time Charel Cloudet had seen his uncle, he’d hugged him before hurrying the younger Cloudet through one of the manor’s many secret passageways, telling him to go east, to not look back and assuring him that he’d follow him later. Charel couldn’t recall how long it’d been since then, but he could still feel his uncle’s warmth around him.\n\nIt made him hold out hope. Even when he turned while running and saw his family’s manor ablaze from afar, and even when he hid in a small village, subsisting on handouts while hearing horrible rumours about his uncle. Even when he met a one eyed Adelartian, and found himself on a familiar path in his uncle’s woods. Charel held out hope that the gods had not taken his uncle.\n\nBut Maar had made up his mind long ago.\n\nCharel's mind was racing, but his body wouldn’t respond. He wanted nothing more than just fly away, but his wings wouldn't unfurl. In front of him on the shore of his uncle’s favourite lake, lay a recently dug unmarked grave decorated with a frayed noose.\n\nHe wanted to scream, but nothing came out. He could remember sitting on the lakeside with his uncle so many years ago, but those fond memories would be tainted now. Charel jumped when he felt a callous claw rest on his shoulder. These Adelartians wouldn’t even allow him a moment to grieve.\n\n"With the power vested into me, as Sheriff and Regent of Greifwald Jean de Nottemagne..." The griffon started, his voice as rough as the worn flintlock on his hip. "I name you Count Cloudet II of Greifwald. My superior, at least in name." He laughed coarsely, before unveiling a dirt-covered Greifwaldian crown and placing it atop Charel’s head.\n\n"Of course, I will still rule in your stead, until you are fit enough to be my superior." The griffon laughed again, looking into Charel’s eyes as he undid his chains. "I will grant you a few moments to grieve, my lord. But afterwards we must be off, there is much to be done."\n\nHis Sheriff stepped away, smirking until the treeline hid him from sight. Only then did Charel cry."

And Count Cloudet, upon a lone throne and abandoned by his nobility, left as a sacrifice to quell the Sheriff's anger and ensure their own positions. He looked exhausted, with his feathers discoloured and his eyes sunken, yet still he smiled down at his Sheriff.\n\n"I suppose congratulations are in order, Jean. You have returned with not just Adelart in your claws, but her people." Cloudet mirthlessly laughed. "Though, I presume you have no intention of returning them to me?" He met the Sheriff's eye, watching as he stood up. After a moment, Cloudet smirked and waved his claw, giving him permission to speak.\n\n"You are only partially correct, my Count. I have fought for naught but the stability of Greifwald and her servants. You and your cause have lost, through no fault of your own." The Sheriff paced forward, unfurling his wings and hovering before Cloudet. "I do not blame you, Count. You are my sovereign, and I am your Sheriff, so I shall return your lands and griffons." He held out a claw to the Count. Slowly he reached out to shake it, only for the Sheriff to reach out and tightly grip his arm. "...At a cost, my Count."\n\nCloudet flinched, and sighed. "Of course. What is it you desire, Jean?"\n\nThe Sheriff smiled. "You shall retain your title, your idols and act as a figurehead." He leaned in closer. "But the rest is under my jurisdiction. There is much to be done, my Count, and I am unsure whether you are strong enough to do it alone." As Cloudet made to speak, the Sheriff held out a talon to silence him. "Of course, you can always refuse. While I do not wish it to be so, Greifwald needs these changes more than it needs its Count." His single eye stared down into Cloudet's pair, unblinking as the seconds dragged on.\n\nSilence returned to the room, broken only by the slow flapping of the Sheriff's wings. His silhouette danced across the modest throne as time wore on. After a moment, the Count shuddered and nodded.

Wandering in, the irritatingly dull Aquileian hopped onto a chair in front of Jean and looked up at him, his expression unreadable as he stared.\n\nAfter a moment, Jean sighed, and waved a claw dramatically. "Yes, you have permission to speak Hobble. What are you after this time?"\n\nThe griffon blinked slowly and nodded. "Nothing much, Sheriff. I simply wish to inform you of the happenings within the-" Jean gestured for him to speed it up, and was promptly ignored. "-Service. Towns noted to be harbouring bandits have been thoroughly supervised, burned and slash or informed of the consequences of not serving their liege as required."\n\nJean raised an eyebrow, only for the Aquileian to continue prattling on regardless. "Furthermore, as per your wishes-" He could swear Hobble’s eyes were boring a hole into him. "-loyal griffons have been brought to their rightful stations within the Service."\n\nA moment of quiet, with both creatures staring back at each other. Jean moved to speak, only for Hobble to continue. "However, I wish for you to be aware that should these griffs not perform to my standards I will not hesitate to flush them back into your Cohorte.

"Of course, of course. I’ll be sure to notify them of the price of failure." He chuckled. "Anything else, Hobble?"\n\nAnother moment, Jean waved his claw again and Hobble spoke up again. "Only one more." He huffed, heaving a yet unseen stack of papers onto Jean’s desk. "I will require many forms from you in order to operate at peak efficiency, so I hope you do not mind the extra paperwork, Sheriff." Jean could swear he could see a snide grin on the griffon's face."

He had that and an indomitable principle: land almost always appreciated in value. With his plans, he would construct a small theme park after the lucrative Las Pegasus model. After that, franchise his brand, and the profits would grease the claws of Adelart and the rest of the world.\n\nHe arrived early out of courtesy and to get familiar with the Shrievalty's officials present here. Wagons hauled out petty items that would be good talking pieces in mansions' lesser rooms: antique weapons, hidden jewellery, letters passed down from generations gone by.

That wasn't why he was here.\n\nThe big auction came last: Zisamane itself, territory and houses and all.

The ground was uneven, the sun and shadows messed with their vision, and sometimes, the ball slipped or an ankle was broken. Gerald had suffered both, aching to return to play.\n\nThe Shrieval Consortium knocked on their glade. They bore guns; their machines, metal claws. The wonders of Griffenheim, Manehattan, and Mount Aris—the pinnacles of the world—would be replicated here in this very spot. The cost was the clearing of these trees. Gerald and his friends protested: the forest teemed with life and history and their own playing field... they might as well be uprooting Adelart itself if the machines continued their course.\n\nThe Consortium's ambassador talked of better lives. Slaving away as farmclaws without end—why live claw to mouth when the Consortium and the Sheriff could pay much better? If not for their sake, then for their families'. He noted the hoop and the potential athletes that circled him.

I feel a gaze burning through the back of my head when I walk down the streets, and I swear I’ve bumped into this same scarred griffon a dozen times in the past week.\n\nYou may say, Diary, that it is simple coincidence and paranoia. That I should simply speak with this fellow and clear up the situation. I...cannot. I have caught his eye multiple times, and it took my all not to freeze on the spot each time. The look he gave me made my wings feel like stone.\n\nAnd...and he spoke to me last time. A ghastly, crackle through his beak.

He is still doing so, although he’s flying closer each time.\n\nI have confided this matter in some of my helpers, and they’ve mostly advised me to seek aid from the authorities to ‘trap’ the figure. While I appreciate their ideas, I do not feel like this griffon is a threat.\n\nA warden, perhaps? Maybe a protector? I know not.\n\nWhat I do know is that I’ve seen them around Pulliers, their scar is very noticeable. Sometimes they are watching me, sometimes not. It’s easy to tell when they do since their glare is one of the strongest I’ve felt. Why if I were but a few years older the first time I caught his eyes, I’d be with Boreas by now.\n\nStill, I have not come this far by turning away from anygriff in need and, from the looks in his eyes when he isn’t staring at me, I’d consider him to be in dire need. Somegriff to talk with, somegriff to pray with, maybe even somegriff to capture. Once more, I know not.\n\nPerhaps I could offer him what he desires? Maybe...I could bring him to my confessional?

adelart.112.d:0 "A thick haze of silence lay heavy upon the dark room. Barely lit by a single lamp and accompanied by an unopened bottle of Vinovian wine, Jean de Nottemagne worked through forms he had originally left for another day, while his guest intently watched every move his claws made.\n\nNeither griff acknowledged each other. By all official accounts, only one griffon was in that room. For hours now, the room had been silent, bar the occasional coughs, sighs and the rustling of a shrinking pile of unsorted paper.\n\nSoon enough, the pile was no more and, with an unfortunately familiar sweeping motion, Jean had finished yet another stack of detailed reports from Hobble. He stretched, and reached for the bottle, uncorking it and pouring its elixir into two glasses.\n\nPicking one up, Jean emulated the noble ritual he’d seen so many times. He swished the wine, smelt it, sipped it and savoured it. The taste danced across his beak, feeling like the first breath of fresh air after hours of work. By the time he went for another sip, he saw the other glass had emptied, though his colleague was still in the same position he’d been the entire time. The only difference was that his eyes were on the bottle, rather than Jean’s clawwriting.\n\nJean let out a chuckle, the first honest one in...years, and poured out another glass for his colleague. He gave a silent ‘Cheers’, and downed his glass.\n\nMaybe Merlock was onto something with his drinking buddies. Even in the quiet, he didn’t feel alone."

adelart.113.t:0 "Phantom Discret Hypothesis"
adelart.113.d:0 "Deep in Aquila, scholars from across the country beyond have just finished The Conference on Aquilean History, a week-long assembly to determine the validity of the widely accepted Imperial theories on historical Aquileia.\n\nThis all began with a line of questioning on the name "Discret" itself and its first prominent appearance in Griffonian history: with Giselda submitting to Grover II after his conquest of Aquileia. Though the Discrets have often styled themselves as noble and royal, the Discrets that ruled with the Grovers set the kingdom on a steep decline, projected to crash in revolution. With the royal line having only come into prominence right before Giselda's appearance, the pre-700s Discrets have been declared to be a Groverist invention, a random group of nobles selected to provide legitimacy to Imperial ascendancy and to the poor bloodline taken by the Second's backstabbing plant.\n\nVarious proposals have come forward as to the identity of ancient Aquileia, of who the true Discrets of old really were. Among the proposals, one gathering steam was that Arantigos had actually gone as far as Aquila before he died, leaving his heirs to mingle with what would become Aquileia and Greifwald, leaving behind the bloodline that would be later named Cloudet. The modern-day Cloudets may not have exactly acted like the great conqueror himself, but this theory has gained popularity among the voting scholars since it reconciles the glories of old Aquileia with its immediate post-Arantigos neighbours.\n\nThrough it all, a cultural festival has popped up across [FROM.GetCapitalName], with an intentional rebranding of Aquileian food such as crepes and eclairs into "native Arantigan cuisine"."

adelart.114.t:0 "Mild Renovations"
adelart.114.d:0 "Noblegriffs like Villard d'Huart had not had it well during Moriset's reign. Moriset was certainly better than Vérany and his herd of swine. That barely made up for how decrepit Aquileia had become, how vainglorious Moriset was. A train of statues and paintings would be vomited out at record speed, and Moriset's royal court of bootlickers were rapt by his spewing of so much anti-republican nonsense that he resembled a poor republican rabble-rouser.\n\nVillard hadn't expected a mangy eye-patched sheriff to then take over, much less have the Cloudets be claimed as a direct descendant of the legendary Arantigos. But Jean offered something else: Aquileia was under Cloudet's system now, and its first prerogative was to rebuild Aquileia "from before Discret degeneration!" In his wake, palaces sprung up, blooming with rainbow gardens and vast lawns and hedges that made forests blush. Every noble was grabbing precious empty land just to beautify it with private parks and recreational spots under their sprawling estates.\n\nThe sheriff asked Villard personally about renovating the d'Huarts' old manor into a modern mansion. In the end, Jean had transformed it into a proper cathedral-esque venue, buttresses and arches flying outwards and inwards like a suit of stone and metal. A giant grocery list had been checked, providing current-day amenities such as coffee machines and radio sets, with enough rooms to house the many servants still under Villard.\n\n"Now, all I'm asking you to do is to manage your estates well," Jean said. "Be a good master, and report to me. I am sure my reports to Cloudet would endear you to him. As long as you're not frothing at the mouth about some missing idol, you will do just fine." A nod later, and the sheriff bade him adieu."

adelart_flavor.1.d:0 "The ancient Sweetsinger dynasty that once ruled Adelart, before the times of Greifwaldian sheriffs and oppressive Discret monarchs, has lost its final heir.\n\nLeonald Sweetsinger, a farmer and public servant in Vilistel, and last known member of his dynasty, passed away last night at the age of 60. Although he was succeeded by two daughters, none took up his family name, and soon after his death, his home was sold off to the local peasant assembly to become cooperative housing for the small town's urban residents. His funeral was attended only by his closest friends and the rare government minister who had taken an interest in Adelart's heirs, at one point in history asking Wood to re-instate the Sweetsingers for nationalistic and political gain.\n\nWith Leonald's death, whatever remained of centuries-old monarchist groups in Adelart has dissipated, and vanguardists have taken the event to be a sign that monarchists will soon serve the sheriff and Greifwaldian exile groups, ordering [HEL.GetLeader] to take action and drive what remains of the influence of foreign monarchies from Adelart.\n\nLeonald's death has met a sorrowful politicization, and it remains a bitter end for a dynasty that had longed to rule Adelart again for hundreds of years. Now, the Sweetsingers will be ruling no county, and the dynasty that went from counts to peasants has finally ended."

adelart_flavor.2.d:0 "Controversy has emerged in a small forest town outside Herlein on the Greifenmarsian border, where an investigation over sounds of disturbing melodies and perpetual revelery led to the uncovering of a bizarre pacifist and environmentalist religious sect that has taken to worshipping a Griffonian forest deity, Fichtl. Worship of the god, questioned revelers claim, was a centuries old tradition among the isolated peasants, which many say predated the establishment of the Tritheist faith all together. Effigies of Fichtl, a tree with a griffon face upon it, have been found all across the forest towns, claw-crafted, woven, and stuffed by local artisans, while local bards sing the songs of the faith to adoring crowds.\n\nMany griffons elsewhere in Adelart have labeled the movement as heresy and idolatry, with some even calling them Maarites in disguise. Meanwhile Old Believer priests are defending the sect, saying minor deities deserve the same respect that Boreas, Eyr and Arcturius receive. The local council leader in Herlein assured that the festivals were all "in good fun", while Fichtlites merely said the festivals were a way to "appreciate the bounty of Fichtl and call attention to the lovely environment we all share, and which is being destroyed by the march of industry", and that the childish effigies were not meant to be taken seriously.\n\nWith ever louder demands to take action against the potentially dangerous cult, it falls to [ROOT.GetLeader] to determine the fate of this obscure festival."

We have provided you with good soldiers, better idols, and more faith than you have earned."\n\nThe Count’s harsh eyes softened as he leaned towards the Sheriff. "Jean, it’s over. I’ve done all I can for you, and Boreas as my witness I wish I could have done more. But I can’t help you any more, the leeches have made sure of that." A moment of silence, as neither griff were willing to meet the other’s eyes.\n\nWith a cough, the Count returned to his harsh glare, though he spoke with a more forced tone. "In the eternal benevolence of the Cloudet dynasty and her supporters, we shall grant you one final chance to reclaim her prize. Return to us with Adelart in claw, or do not return at all."\n\nWith a wave of his claw, the Count bid the Sheriff adieu for the final time."

Knowing who was where was one thing, understanding how in Boreas’ name they weren’t killing each other was another.\n\n"Jean!" His focus broke as Adalgisel vun Kurg, one of his more rowdy stalwarts, snapped her talons in front of his eye. "Are you going to stare a hole through that map all evening, or are you going to listen to the griffons you sent into that blasted place?!" She leered up at him, as an agreeing murmur broke out from the rest of his gathered advisors.\n\nJean sighed. "The latter, Miss Kurg. Please continue, and perhaps you can help make this rotten joke of a state make any sense to me." He lightly nudged her head away, as she huffed and walked back to the makeshift stage.\n\nHe tried to listen, as though they were only able to glean limited information on each faction, every scrap of knowledge they could extract about Adelart would be vital.

He was mostly alone, as the bulk of his advisors, stalwarts and underlings were busy in Adelart. The only remaining griffon had only just now finished up her planning and was scrambling to the bastion’s roof.\n\n"Miss Kurg, I thought you said this wouldn’t become a habit." The Sheriff said, smirking at the exhausted noble. "And I thought we’d be in Eagleton over a decade ago, Jean. But we can’t always get what we want." She said after a moment, flicking out a case of Golden Griffon cigarettes and lighting one. "Touché, Miss Kurg." He replied, swiping one of her cigarettes for himself.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, permeated by the subtle smell of smoke and the slowly setting sun, Adalgisel spoke up. "Forgive me for saying this, Jean. But is this really what you want? I mean, my family has a lovely little island in Les Meridiennes. We can just forget all of this a-" Jean held up a talon to silence her.\n\n"It’s a lovely idea, Miss Kurg." The Sheriff took a long drag from his cigarette, letting the smoke linger in the brief silence, before he exhaled slowly. "But I didn’t give up this much just to leave before Adelart is cleansed of banditry." Adalgisel looked up at him with pleading eyes, but he kept his talon up.\n\n"If you so wish, you can leave. I can carry the messages to the partisans, and you’ve already contacted the tax collectors. All that’d really be missed is a stalwart by my side." He finally looked back at her, and lowered his talon. After a moment, she shook her head and stubbed out her cigarette on the stone ledge. "I’ve come this far with you, Jean. What’s a little further?" She chuckled as she met his eyes.\n\nThe two relaxed in each others’ presence for a few hours more, until the sun fell below the horizon."

An old, ragged priest of the Griffonian goddess Eyr by the name of Luca vun Lissay, backed by thousands of his faithful followers, often wielding nothing but clubs, swords, axes, and the rags on their back, has seized control of the Trade Federation of Skyfall. Appointing himself Venia III, rightful Archon of Eyr, Luca has made calls to the global community to stand against the decadence of the Archons and their imperial masters, rallying behind the banner of the true Archon of Eyr to bring a new religious awakening of community, faith, and temperance.

jaume_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of April, 964 in Conard\n\n§YBiography§!: Born to a family of wealthy immigrants from Flowena hoping to carve out a fortune in Greifwald's eastern territories, Jaume de Conard could never have expected that he would be continuing his family's work 43 years later in such a... different type of territory.\n\nThough his doting parents offered the young entrepreneur the chance to return to Flowena on the eve of the Adelartian Revolution, young Jaume was too arrogant to leave his business ventures behind. He smelled black gold, black gold that would make his line rich, equal even to the patricians of his homeland, and was prepared to brave the tumultuous early days of the Free Territory to do so.\n\nWhen Adelart's independence was assured, Jaume reacted as any opportunist would - he took the name "de Conard" as a sign of his heritage and weaseled his way into the good graces of the new Adelartian diarchy. After all, most of the oligarchs, administrators, and penny-pinchers employed by the Sheriff had left the Eastern territory, either willingly or more often, by force, and griffons like Jaume were the few business types that remained. Jaume's industrial ventures were of just enough importance that he could get away with certain exploitative elements, and as long as the money from his mom and pop remained carefully concealed (an easy feat in bandit Adelart), his true ambitions of control would be well hidden.\n\nFrom Adelart's oil fields shall emerge the industries that would make all of Griffonia go 'round, and into the pockets of the Patricians of Conard will flow an uncountable tide of idols.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Kessel"

merlock_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 11th of May, 959 in Bergelun\n\n§YBiography§!: Merlock Wood is called many things. Traitor, bandit, murderer, hero, protector - but none can deny that he is a revolutionary above all. Wood started his revolutionary career as a little-known partisan of the First Adelartian Revolution of 983, when Jan Roycen, a famed outlaw, first inspired the people of Adelart to break the shackles of both Greifwalder and Aquileian rule, and establish a free independent territory. After Roycen found his rebellion crushed and himself beheaded, Wood took up the torch of the Adelartian revolutionaries, restructuring them among collectivist and fiercely anti-monarchist lines, with the promise of redistribution of wealth for the people and justice upon the corrupt nobles in each and every town they conquered.\n\nGreifwald, controlled by a weak and inefficient count, was beset by an Adelartian revolution that gained most of their strongholds peacefully through the people's will, with Wood's revolutionary ideals at its helm. The Sheriff, Willam Wendenal, failed to quell the revolt, with his own trusted griffons betraying him for the promise of wealth and freedom. He was beheaded soon after, and replaced by Jean de Nottemagne, who reluctantly fled Adelart for good.\n\nMerlock began to re-organize the government upon libertarian, collectivist, and populist lines, with particular fury directed toward the Archonates and the Prelature of Greifwald, who suffered massive reprisals and murders at the claws of Wood's guerrilla armies. Fiercely anti-authoritarian attitudes among the revolutionaries, along with a hatred of what they believed was Maarite corruption in the temples, led to Wood embracing the Old Believers, a fringe religious sect, and shaking claws with the new "Elected Prelate", Luca vun Lissay.\n\nWhile Wood has ruled for 20 years with relative stability, the people are growing restless. Hardliners clamour for Wood's removal and trial for banditry and mass murder and the establishment of true socialism, while moderates call for the end of the revolutionary period and the establishment of real democracy. If Wood is to stay, only time will tell.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

luca_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of December, 928 in Lissay\n\n§YBiography§!: The origins of Luca vun Lissay, leader of the Old Believers in Adelart and devout theologian, are a mystery to even the most loyal of his supporters.

Even the skeptics can say little of his background - with no known parents or familial connections, Luca vun Lissay was raised by the faith, bestowing upon him a fanatic devotion to the Gods and faith - and a skepticism of the Archonate's methods that would linger for the rest of his life.\n\nSo far has the cult of personality of Luca vun Lissay risen that he has now been proclaimed the "True Prelate of Greifwald" by his supporters, despite the hierarchical hyprocrisy that the name entails. The ragged, aging priest has become a beacon of hope for the people of Adelart, and after the post-revolutionary purges of Ebonwing's loyalists, now remains the only legitimate temporal authority in the wayward province.\n\nMerlock Wood spared his sect and gave them their power, and now, Luca vun Lissay himself has taken his place. As long as he is in charge, the nobles shall once more flee in terror, and the faithless shall do nothing more but bow their heads to the Gods above.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: MonAx"

luca_archon_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of December, 928 in Lissay\n\n§YBiography§!: The origins of Archon Venia III, prophet of Eyr and devout theologian, are a mystery to even the most loyal of his supporters. Some, the most devout loyalists to the Old Believer cause, say he was placed upon the forests of Adelart by the Gods themselves, given to a local temple to become a prophet of Eyr herself and bring down the lie of the Archonate. Even the skeptics can say little of his background - with no known parents or familial connections, Venia III was raised by the faith, bestowing upon him a fanatic devotion to the Gods and faith - and a skepticism of the Archonate's methods that would linger for the rest of his life.\n\nIt is perhaps most odd, then, than the griffon who was so fanatically against the Archonate, would become one himself, the Archon of Eyr and leader of the faithful of Griffonia. However, the griffon who was once Luca vun Lissay has declared that no longer shall this new Archonate be an oligarchy. Instead, the Archons shall be chosen by the people of Griffonia as a whole, as prelates and priests scour the nation for griffons who truly understand the faith and are ready for the burden of power. No longer shall Venia III's Archons be chosen by oligarchy and nobility - they shall be chosen from and by the truly faithful, wherever they may be.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: MonAx"

selena_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 9th of October, 961 in Lissay\n\n§YBiography§!: Selena Krafsherr has been fighting for the faith her entire life. Born to a poor but devout family of farmers on the outskirts of Lissay, Selena was their sixth child, and their fourth daughter. Neglected and impoverished, Selena left her mother's farm as soon as she came of age, and came to join the movement of Luca vun Lissay in 979, laying down her earthly possessions to accept the boon of Eyr and the Old Believers.\n\nSelena found no passion in the dull acts of priesthood, however, and decided to take matters into her own claws. During the Adelartian Revolution of 987, Selena fought for official Old Believer militia brigades, sanctioned by Luca vun Lissay. With the help of Luca, who grew attached to the fiercely religious warrior, Selena was able to found the Sisters of Eyr, an official militia of the faith.\n\nShe became an ordained "Sister" of the all-female militia, and soon attracted griffons from all over Greifwald, becoming Luca's right claw in the process. Selena pressured Luca to declare himself a Prelate to counter Greifwald, and the rest was history. Now, with the Old Belivers cemented under Luca's leadership, Selena stands as a leader of both the faith and an army. The question is what she will do with it.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Cofido"

sheriff_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 21st of November, 951 in Lissay\n\n§YBiography§!: No one is quite sure how the Sheriff of Adelart is still alive, with all the vitriol and hatred levied against him, nor how he has continued to be a sizable thorn in the side of the Adelartian government. Twenty years ago, Jean de Nottemagne pursued the bandit Merlock Wood and his allies in the Old Believer faith, raiding towns, demanding taxes and levies from peasants who might have hoarded him and his rebel allies. Then, the tables turned - Merlock Wood became the leader of a free territory for griffons of all stripes, while Nottemagne was forced from town to town with a small army of loyal griffs and armed tax collectors.\n\nNottemagne, however, has emulated Wood's elusive spirit, and is never found at the same town twice. While mercenaries and Forest Brothers alike pursued him, the Sheriff of Adelart stayed one step ahead, raiding villages for taxes to fill his war chest and griffons to join his roving army - all the while biding his time until the restoration of the Shrievalty. He may have lost an eye and all of his dignity in the guerilla war against his former domain, but his perseverance has not wavered, nor his unceasing spirit of vengeance.\n\nIt will be that spirit of vengeance that will carry a renewed Shrievalty into an era of perfect order, and this time, Jean de Nottemagne does not plan on making the same mistakes.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofus"

wood_general_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 11th of May, 959 in Bergelun\n\n§YBiography§!: Merlock Wood is called many things. Traitor, bandit, murderer, hero, protector - but none can deny that he is a revolutionary above all. Wood started his revolutionary career as a little-known partisan of the First Adelartian Revolution of 983, when Jan Roycen, a famed outlaw, first inspired the people of Adelart to break the shackles of both Greifwalder and Aquileian rule, and establish a free independent territory. After Roycen found his rebellion crushed and himself beheaded, Wood took up the torch of the Adelartian revolutionaries, restructuring them among collectivist and fiercely anti-monarchist lines, with the promise of redistribution of wealth for the people and justice upon the corrupt nobles in each and every town they conquered.\n\nAlthough Wood's skills have soured in recent years, he is still an incredibly competent commander, and hero to Adelart's people.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

trouillard_general_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of July, 965 in Vilistel\n\n§YBiography§!: Nobody is entirely sure why Jacques Trouillard is still fighting on the side of Merlock Wood. A notable monarchist who does not even try to hide his distaste for the free territory's unique democracy, Trouillard fought in the revolution against Greifwald for Adelartian patriotism, not for Wood's values.\n\nEventually, Trouillard would leave Wood's Forest Brothers, and although he continued to serve in the armed forces, his loyalty toward Wood's government quickly faded. Now, Trouillard is perhaps Adelart's most accomplished general, and with the Sheriff already approaching him in closed-door meetings with shady deals on the table, it seems that Trouillard's faith in Adelart is simply opportunistic.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: EmpressBridle"

alexandra_desc: "§YBorn§!: 28th of April, 975 in Aquila\n\nThe First Aquileian Revolution imbued young Alexandra Descieux with an implacable passion to preserve her fellow Aquileians' liberty. When her crippled father was able, he'd take her to watch the various worker strikes that King Moriset, by his irrational whims, would then either ignore or crush with extreme prejudice, showing her the crude, concrete acts of class-crushing capitalism and imperialism.\n\nWith her father's connections to the underground republican movement, an older Descieux was then introduced to a gallery of communist faces that would rise to political fame in their latter days such as Cru, Gaudreau, and Devereux. However, it was Victor Allard that enraptured her, whether it be for his sensible ideas for a workers' vanguard, his pragmatic anti-pie-in-the-sky means to advance the workers' cause, or the naive intrigue surrounding his mysterious origins. Victor had taken a liking to Descieux's zeal and so had given her unfettered access to the writings of socialists from around the world as one of his secretaries.\n\nDescieux's opportunity to mix Allard's theory with free-spirited action arrived in 1003 when Allard sent her to Adelart to prepare its workers for a possible Aquileian red wave of revolution, all the while garnering the trust of Merlock Wood and his gang of robbers by assisting them in the fight against the sheriff and Greifwald's forces of reaction. A coup later would see Merlock ousted from power, and in the void of power, Descieux swooped in, all of Adelart under her vanguard's jurisdiction.\n\nOverseer of vast swathes of peaceful forests and farms, Descieux now holds a spot of communist scarlet in Western Griffonia, primed to amend the injustices done to the working class. It remains to be seen how well Allard's premier student leads from the front.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: MonAx"

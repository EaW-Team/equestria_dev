GFS_anesu_goldleaf_desc:0 "A second-generation colonial born in the country, Anesu Goldleaf was torn between two worlds as a boy; his love for the native lands, coddled by his father on long safari's and hunts across the terrain, and the life of a colonial, ruling over a small estate in the countryside with a primarily native work-force while his father was away. He never knew his mother, with his father telling him she died in childbirth, but Anesu had always suspected he wasn't born solely of Colonial blood, even if he couldn't prove it. A somewhat mild supporter of colonial rule, with an equal love for the native peoples and an even-handed nature, Anesu joined the military to get out from underneath his father's shadow, despite his father paying for his commission, and intends to make it a career, not just a stepping stone.\n\nApplying his love of the terrain and logical mind, he first mastered the desert as a young officer, leading non-native scouts on patrol in the blistering heat of the desert grasslands of his homeland, then sought even greater things in the cavalry. Fortunately, despite his relative inexperience at the time, it needed officers with good understanding of the native terrain in order to avoid being caught out without water or fuel. Finally, with promotions under his belt, the time might have come for Anesu Goldleaf to prove to his father that his effort to become his own pony wasn't for nothing more than the admitted adoration he'd earned among his soldiers, a mixture of native and non-native ponies and zebra's, but to defend his own nation."

She soon noticed how unusually intelligent and knowledgeable Gore was, and decided to train him as her successor. Soon enough, Gore had adopted the Llambetan religion which venerated the Sapa Llama as a god-king. Yet there was something odd about his preachings. He used terms such as "All-Father" which no one was familiar with, and practiced rituals which were seen as heretical. Nevertheless, thanks to her mother's patronage and protection, he was eventually ordained as a priest."

Dedicating his time from a young age to training new recruits, both Macawian and from abroad, Fethee found himself a wide network of connections to serve him well.\n\nA relatively stubborn harpy, his doctrine has followed his personality by focusing on never conceding any strong points. Though useful in mock scenarios and in wargames battling for the peninsula, it remains to be seen just how effective such ideas would be on a larger front.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! Blakasmoko"

MCW_eloa_queruscos_desc:0 ""The flames of revolution burn so brightly the light of all others seems almost faint in comparison."\n\n§YBorn§!: 4th of November 970, Queruscos\n\n§YBiography§!: To call Eloa brutal would be to call a griffon greedy; Woefully obvious and pointless. From a young age, her rough and tumble nature dragged her into conflicts again and again. With older students, with teachers, with military instructors and with anyone who slighted her as she grew. In an attempt to curb her attitude, her professors pushed for her to join the navy.\n\nIn spite of their hopes, she thrived in her new environment. Her disrespect of superior officers keeping her on the edge of being discharged, while her surprising diligence and dedication to any tasks she was assigned to managed to win enough respect to always keep her from it. Because of this Eloa has gained a reputation as a dog who works best when left to complete her tasks off the leash.\n\nUnfortunately, as a result of her temperament, she was passed up for promotion time and time again. She would have remained in her minor position for years, if her superior officers didn't throw away their whole claws. Eloa knew that if and when the coupsters fell, the hatred their actions generated would fall on the rest of the navy, including her and her few friends. Thus, she acted.\n\nHer long-time comrade Alipha acted as the kind star for the revolution to follow, while Eloa fell into the role of an effectively brutal revolutionary, a role she took to with her normal diligence, dedication and efficiency. Now she stands at the head of the revolution, ready to do what needs to be done.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! §GStardustSpix§!"

MCW_kiania_friere_desc:0 ""They speak of every achievement, everything Macawia has gained in the last few years as if I personally heralded it, you know? As if every harpy that made up the whole was simply a vessel for my will, incapable of acting to benefit those around them. Perhaps it's telling, then, that they would choose that over the truth. No one likes it when the answer is right beneath their beaks."\n\n§YBorn§!: 7th of March 970, Sao Penario\n\n§YBiography§!: Born to a wealthy trading family in Sao Penario, the Freire twins were inseperable for most of their formative years. Both excelled at different subjects, but they decided to enter the Macawian bureaucracy at a low level to work their way up together. Their efforts caught the eye of then-incumbent Julio Penario, who wished for a single protege to teach the ropes to. After some time they were able to convince him to take them both, but challenge them against each other every so often in order to prove who would truly follow his footsteps.\n\nAfter a few years and a low blow by Kiaque, who'd clearly lost sight of their original goal, Kiania was left to her own devices, alone in a world she and her brother were meant to better together. But she did not give up, she couldn't. Utilising her particularly fiery brand of Harmony she was able to slowly take hold of the growing distaste with Julio's PRA and use it to form a rapidly growing counterweight.\n\nNow she stands atop her amassed people, ready and willing to reshape Macawia as she needs. While there may be no rest in sight for her, perhaps there may be a chance to reconcile with her brother.\n\n§YPortrait by:§! Blakasmoko"

MCW_midnight_lancer_desc:0 ""Some ponies look up at the sky and see only the clouds, stars and our lovely moon. When I look up, though, I see a world like none other. Wind flowing like water, temperatures freezing my feathers together, adrenaline rushing as I hurdle towards the ground, my wings shaking under the sheer speed as I push everything past its limits.. When I'm up there, with the only thing between me and death being this fragile angel I call my plane, I feel like a completely different pony. I feel... alive..."\n\n§YBorn:§! 25th of August, 980\n\n§YBiography:§! Born and raised in the suburbs of Manehattan to some rather adventurous parents, Midnight Lancer is a friendly stallion who grew up with a burning passion for flight. During his youth, the pegasus travelled with his parents across Equestria and beyond, exposing the pony to many different worldviews and perspectives on life. One visit in particular showed Lancer the incredible potential of airships, igniting a burning passion for aviation that would grow alongside him.\n\nThe pegasus arrived in Macawia in 1001, hoping to work alongside the harpies who mastered the skies and inspired him as a colt. He spent years working his way up the ranks in the newly established Air Force, doing everything he could to show his commanders that the best way forward is with a fast, powerful strike. After the battle of Ain Trotgourait in 1005, Midnight realized the age of the airship was nearing its end, and advocated for leadership to experiment with the airplanes he felt would soon replace them. Fellow pilots who served with Lancer describe the pegasus as chipper, overly trusting and a bit jumpy when caught off guard, but they all agree he's nothing if not passionate for his work. Some may say a pegasus doesn't belong in a nation of harpies, but Midnight is determined to help these birds soar.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Opalradiance"

As the daughter of librarians, she developed great interests in books and lexicons, and started her education in an early age in the Library of Prospero.\n\nAfter graduation, she was selected by local government and began her service in the Asterion Army. During the service, she heard news from Maregypt. The rumors about her homeland made it a pity for her since she knew nothing about the blood within her vain.\n\nSo, she decided to go home, to the motherland that she had never stepped on.

They had split with Grogar over issues of doctrine, and fearing his revenge, they had settled in the lands of Osqat, where Gote would be born in the town of Koltbylia. In the lands around it, the clan of goats had founded their own, unofficial community of "Goatistan", and his father was recognized by his fellow exiles as their leader.\n\nIn his youth, Gote's father had warned him about the mysteries of old Tambelon and told him the stories of Grogar's tyranny. His father gave him a rich education, in no doubt to have a worthy heir. However, as Gote grew up, he dismissed his father's teachings and wandered off towards the mystical lands of Azir, where legends had located the goat's homeland.\n\nAs fate would have it, Gote arrived just as Grogar regained his powers. Grogar saw an opportunity in having Gote serve him, and the young wanderer was easily fooled into his service. To this day, it is not entirely clear if Gote understands whom he is serving..."

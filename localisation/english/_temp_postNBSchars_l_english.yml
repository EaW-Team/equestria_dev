GFS_anesu_goldleaf_desc:0 "A second-generation colonial born in the country, Anesu Goldleaf was torn between two worlds as a boy; his love for the native lands, coddled by his father on long safari's and hunts across the terrain, and the life of a colonial, ruling over a small estate in the countryside with a primarily native work-force while his father was away. He never knew his mother, with his father telling him she died in childbirth, but Anesu had always suspected he wasn't born solely of Colonial blood, even if he couldn't prove it. A somewhat mild supporter of colonial rule, with an equal love for the native peoples and an even-handed nature, Anesu joined the military to get out from underneath his father's shadow, despite his father paying for his commission, and intends to make it a career, not just a stepping stone.\n\nApplying his love of the terrain and logical mind, he first mastered the desert as a young officer, leading non-native scouts on patrol in the blistering heat of the desert grasslands of his homeland, then sought even greater things in the cavalry. Fortunately, despite his relative inexperience at the time, it needed officers with good understanding of the native terrain in order to avoid being caught out without water or fuel. Finally, with promotions under his belt, the time might have come for Anesu Goldleaf to prove to his father that his effort to become his own pony wasn't for nothing more than the admitted adoration he'd earned among his men, a mixture of native and non-native ponies and zebra's, but to defend his own nation."

Though she was born and raised in Prospero of Asterion, her parents were actually from Maregypt, who had escaped from the desert just to find her a better place to get education. As the daughter of librarians, she developed great interests in books and lexicons, and started her education in an early age in the Library of Prospero.\n\nAfter graduation, she was selected by local government and began her service in the Asterion Army. During the service, she heard news from Maregypt. The rumors about her homeland made it a pity for her since she knew nothing about the blood within her vain.\n\nSo, she decided to go home, to the motherland that she had never stepped on. In the Battle of R'ataphet, just one year before her birth, she was not there with her folks. But this time, things will be different.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Kaiser Sauce"

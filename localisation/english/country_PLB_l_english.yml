Its great mouth is filled with wicked and sharp teeth with two great fangs that could pierce skulls at the front. It may walk upright on two legs or bear-like on four, but other times it uses all its six limbs. It's greater in size than any bear and stronger by far."

Under the blessing of glorious chairbear Icebear, Ivar started an operation to supply the north with all that their generous allies in Stalliongrad can provide, such as good alcohol, tobacco and opium.

PLB_queen_guard:0 "Carapace the Feared"
PLB_queen_guard_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 12th of March 936\n§YRank§!:Korpsführer für die Nordfront\n§YBiography§!:Carapace was born into a connected family within Ditrysium which ensured, that when he grew up and joined the army, he was given a position of commander. Carapace would serve in this position during campaigns against deer fanatics in 962 and Hive of Vraks in 971, earning a reputation for brutality, battlefield cruelty, contempt for weakness, obsession with engaging in difficult battles and pushing himself through horrid conditions, in one case even continuing to fight despite acid burns. Due to this he was invited to join Chrysalis’ Queen’s Guard, where he quickly rose through the ranks.\n\nHowever, the star of Carapace would not rise far, despite a core of loyalists that formed around him. For he often clashed with other commanders over foreign policy. He cared little for geopolitics of love, limiting his own consumption to harden himself, and even less of subjugating Equestrians. In his mind, changelings either had to dominate the North or strike overseas, where harder foes than ponies awaited. To most commanders and queens, however, this sounded like ramblings of a madbug. Ramblings, which together with the failure of 1002, angered Chrysalis enough that she cast him out, assigning him to an obscure position near Soryth and sidelining his followers, pushing Lacin Cardo and his generation to even greater prominence than before.\n\nHowever Carapace found acceptance and even friendship within exiled bear clans that fled to Changeling lands after campaigns of Paw Wellington. He respected their militant culture, while they admired him for a perceived "frozen soul". And thus, when Bjornling marched east, Carapace volunteered to join. And while Chrysalis and Lacin seem to live under delusion that he is a senile old loyalist, merely supervising the Northern Protectorate, his spite is strong, his blood runs cold with revitalizing drugs and his loyalties lie in the North."

PLB_yearly_review:0 "The Yearly Review"
PLB_yearly_review_desc:0 "For the half-decade that polar bears have been united under the blessed protection of Paw Wellington the country has been pushed towards modernity and perhaps even uniformity year by year. Some time after a new year comes, the newborn bureaucracy would present their report to the despot. The time has come for the fifth such report."

PLB_treasury_report:0 "The Treasury Situation"
PLB_treasury_report_desc:0 "While the implementation of the modernization programs has been rather... subpar... That can be carried into the following year. What's important is that we have resources to continue them. It's a good thing then, that we should still have plenty of resources to push these endeavours forwards."

PLB_request_financial_support:0 "Request Financial Support from Other Clans"
PLB_request_financial_support_desc:0 "Sadly, with the quite unexpected material situation at paw, we are forced to step down from our position of Clan Scyfling superiority and domination and request for material support from the other subjugated clans. We can only hope that this does not shatter the image of superiority and even divine favour we have formed."

PLB_establish_tax_system:0 "Take What We Need"
PLB_establish_tax_system_desc:0 "If they do not respond to politeness and friendly requests, perhaps they will respond to law and force. We will not ask anymore, we will take! The state needs to modernize to survive, and to modernize it needs resources, scribes and soldiers. And if we have to, All-Father willing, we will take what we need with an iron paw!"

PLB_united_polar_bear_army:0 "Create a United Polar Bear Army"
PLB_united_polar_bear_army_desc:0 "For now the military of our country is comprised from Clan Scyfling warbands. This was a mistake as it seems it led to the other nine clans forgetting that they are our subordinates and have their own duties. Perhaps they won't be so willing to forget when it becomes the duty to fight for the country under the leadership of Paw too."

PLB_nationalize_fish_farms:0 "Begin Nationalization of Fish Farms"
PLB_nationalize_fish_farms_desc:0 "One of the first things Paw Wellington did after his conquests was make the ownership of coastal fish farms fairer, in some cases even distributing Clan Scyfling fish to less fortunate clans. This was not just an act of kindness, but also a show of power. Whoever controls the fish trade and capture controls the bears. Thus, we must control most of the fish."

PLB_combined_research_initiatives:0 "Start Combined Research Initiatives"
PLB_combined_research_initiatives_desc:0 "While there is much we can learn from abroad, there is similarly as much that can be learned from within. Many clans produce and use unique adaptations of various technologies which should be spread to become accessible to all bears. For this noble goal we will demand that artisans of other clans are sent to our fortresses and teach us their knowledge so we can spread it across the North."

PLB_the_outcast_question:0 "The Outcast Question"
PLB_the_outcast_question_desc:0 "They might act arrogant and superior to us, having mocked our pride, our dreams and the concept of a great united bear state. But we still control the borders and they don't. If we can't get support and help from bears at home, we will just take it from the bears abroad. We will open up the borders and accept the countless exiles that roam the world back home."



PLB_scyfling_shall_not_surrender:0 "We Will Not Yield, We Will Not Surrender!"
PLB_scyfling_shall_not_surrender_desc:0 "It has been less than a decade, yet once more our clan is pitted against the rest of our kind. But just like the last time, All-Father willing, we will not surrender or yield until all of polar bears are yet again united by Clan Scyfling."

PLB_seize_their_fish_farms:0 "Restore the Fish Farms"
PLB_seize_their_fish_farms_desc:0 "The destroyed and sabotaged fish farms have been a bit of an issue we have neglected to address due to ever increasing issues before the collapse. However, we can't afford to do that any longer. The fish farms all across our owned lands must become operational again so that we may never find ourselves lacking."

PLB_strenghten_local_alliances:0 "Forge Local Alliances"
PLB_strenghten_local_alliances_desc:0 "There are many ice forts or even larger fortresses that are inhabited not by any of the great clans, but rather by lesser outcasts or those whose bloodlines never belonged to any clan. We have previously mostly ignored their interests and part to play in a united bear state. However, that can still be fixed."

PLB_storm_their_fortresses:0 "Storm Their Fortresses"
PLB_storm_their_fortresses_desc:0 "While most of the northwest bear lands are owned and controlled by Clan Scyfling or bears lacking clan alignment there are still quite a few locations where the claws of Onlartir or Wesslandian clans stretch among what is ours. We must ensure we won't be struck in the back and thus their castles and forts must fall!"

PLB_northwest_reclaimed:0 "Finish the Reclamation of the Northwest"
PLB_northwest_reclaimed_desc:0 "Fish are being caught in great numbers again. Larger and larger armies are being raised. And any presence of other clans that presents a danger to us has been eliminated. Now we can march outwards!"

PLB_the_march_west:0 "March West"
PLB_the_march_west_desc:0 "The fact that there was anything left that could revolt in Eastern Key Lake after the clans that persisted there were pushed out into the Changeling Lands for their treason is quite surprising. Reclaiming it should not be an issue."

PLB_gaze_south:0 "Turn our Gaze South"
PLB_gaze_south_desc:0 "Onlartir is an unforgiving land. Distant from the nourishing sea and even most rivers or lakes. Through its long history it has been invaded by changelings, rogue yak warbands, other bear clans and even a few failed griffon expeditions. No wonder such land has bred three entire clans of fearsome warriors..."

PLB_negotiations_with_clan_Kane:0 "Attempt Negotiations with Clan Kane"
PLB_negotiations_with_clan_Kane_desc:0 "Clan Kane is a rather strong force, being the only clan whose troops can match the fearsome Svartpels in melee combat and perhaps even possessing greater endurance. Subjugating them was hard before. But perhaps as a show of good faith and understanding, we can defeat them by word and not claw..."

PLB_negotiations_with_clan_goltung:0 "Attempt Negotiations with Clan Gotlung"
PLB_negotiations_with_clan_goltung_desc:0 "Even in the unforgiving land of Onlartir, Clan Gotlung was in the worst position. And yet they endure in their great forts and with their great shields. It took a long time to bombard them into submission the last time, though perhaps they don't want their new fortresses bombarded into dust again and would rather talk it out?"

PLB_negotiations_with_clan_rozenkrantz:0 "Attempt Negotiations with Clan Rozenkrantz"
PLB_negotiations_with_clan_rozenkrantz_desc:0 "The shaman ruled Clan Rozenkrantz gazes into the northern winds and channels the power of winter itself like no other. It was only through outmaneuvering and overpowering them that we won. Something that took two great clans to complete. Perhaps we can convince them to gaze into the northern winds and see that our fates align?"

PLB_subjugate_clan_Kane:0 "Subjugation of Clan Kane"
PLB_subjugate_clan_Kane_desc:0 "Clan Kane of Onlartir might be comprised of proud and great warriors, each one perhaps being able to match any two or even three belonging to other clans. Yet we made them kneel once, and we can do it again!"

PLB_subjugate_clan_goltung:0 "Subjugation of Clan Gotlung"
PLB_subjugate_clan_goltung_desc:0 "Clan Gotlung might think themselves unreachable beyond their great walls once again, their fortresses rising higher than before. They had done the same last time we marched across the North uniting bears under a single banner. It didn't help them then, and it won't help them now."

PLB_subjugate_clan_rozenkrantz:0 "Subjugation of Clan Rozenkrantz"
PLB_subjugate_clan_rozenkrantz_desc:0 "Clan Rozenkrantz have refined their magical crafts like none among our kind have seen before during these five years. However, we know the blessing of the divine is stronger than any magic of a mortal. Even if they think things have changed, they could never defeat the armies blessed by the All-Father."

PLB_destroy_clan_Kane:0 "Destroy Clan Kane"
PLB_destroy_clan_Kane_desc:0 "There is nothing noble in what we must do, but it must be done. The great warriors of Clan Kane will be slain till the last by our might. None will survive to resist. Only guilt and regret will persist."

PLB_destroy_clan_goltung:0 "Destroy Clan Gotlung"
PLB_destroy_clan_goltung_desc:0 "It is brutal and wasteful, perhaps even absurd, but there is no other choice left to us... The great walls of Gotlung will collapse onto them, burying all beneath them, leaving only haunted ruin behind."

PLB_destroy_clan_rozenkrantz:0 "Destroy Clan Rozenkrantz"
PLB_destroy_clan_rozenkrantz_desc:0 "The northern winds will howl and fire will roar, but the blizzard of Rozenkratz shamanic might will go out. An entire legacy snuffed out, leaving the messages of the hales impossible to comprehend."

PLB_pacify_south:0 "The South is Ours"
PLB_pacify_south_desc:0 "Onlartir rests beneath the banner of Scyfling again, just like it did recently. However now the land of proud warriors and great shamans is truly devoted to our cause, something which we were unable to ensure the last time through our foolishness. But now, now we can be sure that there won't be any more revolts."

PLB_gaze_east:0 "Turn our Gaze East"
PLB_gaze_east_desc:0 "Unexpectedly and perhaps in a surprise to not just us but everyone across the bear lands, the three clans of plentiful Wesslandia have aligned with each other, forging a sort of alliance of equals. Such a system has never been seen before among the bears and let's hope that it has its faults, for if Wesslandia truly rises united, we would simply not have the numbers to stand a chance!"

PLB_negotiations_with_triple_alliance:0 "Attempt Negotiations with the Triple Alliance"
PLB_negotiations_with_triple_alliance_desc:0 "The so called "Triple Alliance" of Wesslandia is truly a foe too great to meet on the battlefield. While a position of equals is quite horrible when it comes to negotiations between bears, we can only hope that the Wesslandians have taken up a more pragmatic position on such matters from their griffon servants."

PLB_shatter_the_great_fortresses:0 "Besiege the Triple Alliance"
PLB_shatter_the_great_fortresses_desc:0 "A united Wesslandia would crush us easily. Yet with how the region is positioned, surrounded on all sides by enemies, be they one of the great bear clans or griffons, they could never fight us as equals. And thus one victory will pile on top of another until we will reach the other side of the bountiful Wesslandia."

PLB_shatter_the_alliance:0 "Butcher the Triple Alliance"
PLB_shatter_the_alliance_desc:0 "Wesslandia had united by itself, rose from formerly rival clans... They resisted us before, but now, with all that we have done? They would never accept our rule and we could never contain them... Only one option is left. To snuff out an entire region... Let's hope the gods forgive us, because we could never forgive ourselves."

PLB_pacify_east:0 "The East is Ours"
PLB_pacify_east_desc:0 "The plentiful and great Wesslandia now rests beneath our claws. Despite its recent unification into a force which might have challenged and even defeated us, had All-Father not blessed us, we were the ones who emerged triumphant against what would in any other case be impossible odds! And this time, our grip will persist for sure."

PLB_prepare_for_the_final_struggle:0 "Prepare for The Final Push"
PLB_prepare_for_the_final_struggle_desc:0 "We might have eliminated the threat the lesser clans had posed for us, yet to confront the great Clan Volsungr and fearsome Clan Svartpels we will need to prepare as much as possible. We will raise new forces and fortify our new borders in preparation for retribution and a great push."

PLB_question_of_clan_volsungr:0 "Question of Clan Volsungr"
PLB_question_of_clan_volsungr_desc:0 "Clan Volsungr is perhaps quite the anomaly within the polar bear territories. They used to be a rival to our former comrades in Svartpels, which meant that during the previous unification they lost extremely brutally. This forced them to accept many outcasts, which changed them, transformed them even. It is difficult to even think what would be the best way to deal with them now."

PLB_attempt_negotiations_with_clan_volsungr:0 "Attempt Negotiations with Harmonists of Volsungr"
PLB_attempt_negotiations_with_clan_volsungr_desc:0 "Under their new "Princess" - Eira, Clan Volsungr has redefined itself in an imitation of Equestrian rule. Perhaps the sort of Equestrian pacifism and desire to forgive has translated too? Maybe they would be willing to talk this out?"

PLB_subjugation_of_clan_volsungr:0 "Attempt Subjugation of Volsungr Harmonists"
PLB_subjugation_of_clan_volsungr_desc:0 "Clan Volsungr was made to kneel once. This will repeat again. No matter how much they copy Equestria, they will not be able to match the tactical prowess we learned from our years of exile in Griffonia."

PLB_destroy_of_clan_volsungr:0 "Bombard Volsungr Mountain Holds to Dust"
PLB_destroy_of_clan_volsungr_desc:0 "With what we have done, the Equestrian copy cats that are Clan Volsungr would never align with us and would never submit to us. The only way to ensure an enemy army is not hiding in those mountains, is to collapse them onto the Volsungr fortress within... Let's hope the forged future is bright enough to justify this."

PLB_volsungr_defeated:0 "Yak Mountains are Ours"
PLB_volsungr_defeated_desc:0 "The mountains that separate our lands from the Yaks are said to be impossible to break through and fight in. Yet in our advance against Volsungr, we have subjugated these great mountains too."

PLB_question_of_clan_svartpels:0 "Question of Clan Svartpels"
PLB_question_of_clan_svartpels_desc:0 "Clan Svartpels were our most faithful allies during the first unification. Furthermore, their elder - the Lord of Storms, Torben - was a good, if distant friend to Paw Wellington. Yet now we stand opposed..."

PLB_attempt_negotiations_with_clan_svartpels:0 "Try a Peaceful Option with Svartpels"
PLB_attempt_negotiations_with_clan_svartpels_desc:0 "Clan Svartpels seems to believe that our mistakes are not our own faults but rather some sort of changeling driven conspiracy. With this in mind, if we can indeed convince them to join us as brothers in arms and our staunches friends and allies again."

PLB_subjugation_of_clan_svartpels:0 "Make the Lords of Thunder Kneel Again"
PLB_subjugation_of_clan_svartpels_desc:0 "While the belief of Clan Svartpels that our mistakes are nothing more than some foreign inspired conspiracy is strange, it is also reassuring as it means if we prove we are true bears they will most likely align with us again. However, for Svartpels and Torben, the only way to prove such a thing would be through war..."

PLB_destroy_of_clan_svartpels:0 "Thunder and Lightning Will Not Save Them"
PLB_destroy_of_clan_svartpels_desc:0 "With how much they seem to be convinced everything bad is a conspiracy of changelings they will simply never accept what we did or why. There is an immense grief in having to turn on old friends. Yet for the future of bearkind it has to be done."

PLB_independent_polar_circle_initiative:0 "Polar Circle Initiative"
PLB_independent_polar_circle_initiative_desc:0 "The Polar Circle Initiative is an idea created by some elders of Clan Volsungr, involving the mutual defense of our nation and Pingland. If either were to be attacked by a foreign race or nation, the other would come to their aid. We are of course willing to help our friends in any war that may come their way, the question now is whether that willingness will be repaid in kind."

PLB_northern_railway_desc:0 "Now that ourselves and our friends to the east are aligned, we can begin construction of a great ice road, a long railway stretching from the islands of Clan Anker to the easternmost city of Ingstad.

PLB_fish_trading_network_desc:0 "Fish. It is a staple food of the far north, caught in abundance all along the frozen coast.

PLB_the_first_princess_of_polar_bears_desc:0 "The polar bears have never been ruled by a monarch, instead led by traditional clan leaders and warlords who are typically the strongest bear in the clan. This had changed after Eira had returned to Clan Volsungr, taking the title of Princess much like the alicorns to the south. She no longer leads just a clan though, but all bears, and her new title will reflect just that."

PLB_our_ideal_of_harmony:0 "Our Concept of Harmony"
PLB_our_ideal_of_harmony_desc:0 "Our idea of Harmony was the first of the clans, created from the far south of Equestria and molded to fit the society and culture of the polar bears.

PLB_paw_wellingtons_take_on_harmony_desc:0 "Though Paw Wellington himself has been strangely absent as of late following the coronation, an assembly of bears from his clan put forward by him has arrived to represent their ideals.

PLB_torbens_take_on_harmony:0 "Torben's Concept of Harmony"
PLB_torbens_take_on_harmony_desc:0 "Thunder Lord Torben's idea of Harmony is a very unique one, and one still rooted in Clan Svartpels' tradition. Though it has lost the lack of respect towards the weak, the ancient hierarchy of bears is still present based on strength. To represent himself and the clan, he has sent an elder from Clan Anker to aid in the matters of ruling."

PLB_the_pyramid:0 ""The Pyramid""
PLB_the_pyramid_desc:0 "The Pyramid is a recent unique ideology proposed by Torben and Clan Svartpels after recent Harmonist discussions and leanings. Though some hardliners of our own clan have called out its obvious continued use of the caste system, the inter-caste cooperation and protection of the lower castes is certainly intriguing."

PLB_the_svartpels_experiment:0 "The Svartpels Experiment"
PLB_the_svartpels_experiment_desc:0 "With the full consent of Princess Eira, Torben has begun implementing his idea of the Pyramid into Clan Svartpels and the surrounding state to test its effectiveness and viability. Even if it may take time for the full effects of it to be seen, it has already created a surprising amount of cooperation in their realm."

PLB_blessing_not_a_punishment:0 "A Blessing, not a Punishment"
PLB_blessing_not_a_punishment_desc:0 "During the first unification wars, many bears of Clan Svartpels died in the battles against the other clans. This led to the region itself becoming depopulated, as those who did not return had their former fortresses of ice and stone decay into nothingness. However, many of them have now realized that this was a blessing, not a curse, as that land can be returned to nature as the strongest of the clan survive."

PLB_where_everyone_has_an_opportunity:0 "Where Everyone Has an Opportunity"
PLB_where_everyone_has_an_opportunity_desc:0 "Everybear should have the opportunity to be what they wish to be.

PLB_scyfling_experiment:0 "The Scyfling Experiment"
PLB_scyfling_experiment_desc:0 "Clan Scyfling, led by their new assembly has started laying down the foundations for their new ideas in the northwest with Princess Eira's approval.

PLB_not_a_despot_a_constitutionalist_desc:0 "One of the flaws of Paw Wellington's regime was a lack of checks on his power, leading to many mistakes created by him alone in his rule. An official constitution like what the Republic had may not exist yet for us, but the Assembly of Scyfling will ensure that Princess Eira's powers are strong but still in check, just as they believe it should be."

PLB_the_great_equestrian_mistake:0 "Equestria's Greatest Mistake"
PLB_the_great_equestrian_mistake_desc:0 "Equestria may be the oldest harmonic regime in the world, a model for all others to look towards and see as the leader of Harmony itself. However, they made one crucial mistake in their history, and that was not protecting their environment and either controlling it or letting it be ravaged by industry. We will not make the same error."

PLB_no_hunting_zones:0 "Reuse Every Bit of Scrap"
PLB_no_hunting_zones_desc:0 "Very few things can't be used more than once. Armor can be reforged into something new, swords can be endlessly sharpened, and guns can be created from any kind of steel lying around. With few available resources and little production at our disposal, making the absolute best of what we have will go a long way."

PLB_no_building_zones:0 "Spires of Shimmering Ice"
PLB_no_building_zones_desc:0 "Ice is a very versatile material, being able to be carved, sculpted, and if necessary, completely melted down. Polar bears already have a long history of making their fortresses out of ice, and it is time we use this to our advantage. By making many other of our buildings out of pure ice, we will easily be able to modify and repair them at a moment's notice, even if they may be more difficult to initially construct."

PLB_ensure_the_tundra_remains_untouched_desc:0 "Some areas of the Polar Bear lands, the taigas and tundras have been completely untouched by the coming industrialization yet, and it should remain that way. By ensuring that nobear ever encroaches on that land, we can keep it in its natural, pristine state forevermore. Construction may suffer for a short while of course, but it is a sacrifice we are willing to make."

PLB_restoring_monster_populations:0 "Restoring Monster Populations"
PLB_restoring_monster_populations_desc:0 "An ecosystem is a very fragile thing. Even a single push or tip can send it spiraling out of control, broken beyond repair. It is why we must bring back our monster population in nature, even though some may consider it madness, to restore the natural balance to the forests and mountains. Though it may be expensive to undertake a project of this magnitude, it is ultimately worth it."

PLB_land_of_heroes_and_beasts:0 "Land of Heroes and Monsters"
PLB_land_of_heroes_and_beasts_desc:0 "The wild is an untamed, and sometimes dangerous place. Now, monsters freely roam the lands, vicious beasts that can defeat even an ursine.

PLB_land_of_justice_and_law:0 "Land of Law and Justice"
PLB_land_of_justice_and_law_desc:0 "Order is one of the most important aspects of any nation. For when order fails, chaos takes reign, and that only leads to disaster and death.

PLB_harmony_of_naturality:0 "Natural Harmony"
PLB_harmony_of_naturality_desc:0 "The Harmony we have is not the product of some foreign race's philosophy or just a copy of another nation's. It is our own, a design that while taking ques from others was completely created by bears and bears alone. And perhaps it is because of that fact that now, we have entered a new era of unity among each other, as something more than just the tyrant and lesser of the past."

PLB_we_are_but_part_of_nature:0 "We are but Part of Nature"
PLB_we_are_but_part_of_nature_desc:0 "We bears are not the masters of nature, nor are we equals with it either. We are one with nature, ourselves part of a larger system and spirit of the north, and we each do our part just as any other plant, animal or even monster does.

PLB_leave_eastern_key_lake_to_nature:0 "Abandon Eastern Key Lake"
PLB_leave_eastern_key_lake_to_nature_desc:0 "The east coast and surrounding lands of Key Lake are already relatively uninhabited compared to the rest of the region, with only a few outcasts living in the region. By convincing these bears to leave for the eastern clans and their regions, we can almost completely leave the entire state to the will and flow of nature, without interference of any kind."

PLB_building_towns:0 "Turn Fortresses into Towns"
PLB_building_towns_desc:0 "Traditionally, bears have lived on their own in grand fortresses of ice and stone, symbols of their strength and power. While they are certainly impressive, relative solitude has done little to foster cooperation between individual bears. By encouraging bears to turn these buildings into their own towns, we will be able to work together on projects and issues better."

PLB_a_natural_economy:0 "A Natural Economy"
PLB_a_natural_economy_desc:0 "Despite assumptions of some, a harmonious relationship with nature does not mean our economy has to suffer, or that we will be left behind in modernity.

PLB_establish_connections_with_outcasts_desc:0 "Even as many bears have already returned home from exile with recent events, there are still many outcasts out there, those who have traveled the world and seen many things we can only dream of.

PLB_economic_harmony:0 "Economic Harmony"
PLB_economic_harmony_desc:0 "An economy must always be in tune with itself, flexible and ready to take whatever role is needed of it.

PLB_viceroyality_system:0 "Viceroyality System"
PLB_viceroyality_system_desc:0 "The Crystal Empire, outside of their capital is a highly decentralized nation, with regions largely operating under the control of their regional governors and little to no oversight being applied.

PLB_centralization_in_weslandia:0 "Centralize Our Holdings in Wesslandia"
PLB_centralization_in_weslandia_desc:0 "With the final act of massively centralizing Wesslandia under the direct authority of Princess Eira, the entire country has in many ways become a splitting image of the Crystal Empire. The Princess has complete control over her domain, that of a massive city by bear standards, with the rest purposely neglected for their own benefit.

PLB_despot_and_the_princess:0 "The Princess and the Despot"
PLB_despot_and_the_princess_desc:0 "Paw Wellington was the only other bear to ever unify the clans under one banner, even if temporarily.

PLB_compatibility_of_faith_and_constitution_desc:0 "Religion can be one of the best sources of unity for any group, bringing together many into one under a single figure, whether it be a god or a simple priest.

PLB_beuty_and_the_beast_desc:0 "Thunder Lord Torben may not have a title that most would consider in a normal noble hierarchy, or seem like the kind of bear who could care for trivialities such as marriage.

PLB_adapt_the_pyramid:0 "Ensure Everyone has Their Place"
PLB_adapt_the_pyramid_desc:0 "Society is meant to be in a strict hierarchy, with the weakest at the bottom and the strongest at its peak.

PLB_open_up_northern_ports:0 "Clear out Naval Routes"
PLB_open_up_northern_ports_desc:0 "There is no easy way to reach Equestria from here by land, as numerous mountain ranges and frozen forests separate us. Contact through the sea is a much easier option, but many of our ports and routes out of the north have frozen over completely, leaving access unavailable. It is time to fix that."

PLB_birthplace_of_harmony_has_fallen:0 "The Birthplace of Harmony has Fallen!"
PLB_birthplace_of_harmony_has_fallen_desc:0 "The unbelievable has happened, for the home of Harmony itself is now gone. While this is a devastating blow to Harmony as a whole, we must move on from what was once our guide and seek a new path. Perhaps there are others that would be willing to join us?"

PLB_connections_with_crystal_empire:0 "Forge Bonds with the Crystal Empire"
PLB_connections_with_crystal_empire_desc:0 "The Crystal Empire is the northernmost and coldest nation of ponies on Equus, having come into existence only a few years ago. The crystal ponies are an admittedly hardy bunch, having lived under Sombra's rule once that far up in the snow. We should reach out to them, establishing diplomats should be a good start."

PLB_equestrian_trade_agreements:0 "Equestrian Trade Agreements"
PLB_equestrian_trade_agreements_desc:0 "Now that we have better access to Equestria, the possibility of actual trade agreements between our nations has become apparent. They will have greater access to our untapped resources in the mountains, while helping to make up for our shortcomings in other areas such as construction."

PLB_equestrian_advisers:0 "Invite Ponies to the Court"
PLB_equestrian_advisers_desc:0 "Throughout millennia the ponies have been able to perfect their country in various ways, from their education system down to their military uniforms. And they can share that perfect and experience with us, all we have to do is ask."

PLB_invite_pony_flora_experts:0 "Hire Pony Flora Experts"
PLB_invite_pony_flora_experts_desc:0 "The ponies control the weather in their country and by extension nature itself in a clear violation of Natural Harmony. However, some of them have also devoted their lives to studying the plant life native not only to Equestria, but to all the world. We are not so conceited as to believe we know everything about the wild here, and having these experts aid in marking important nature sites may be beneficial."

PLB_hire_earth_ponies_for_forest_restoration:0 "Equine Help in Forest Restoration"
PLB_hire_earth_ponies_for_forest_restoration_desc:0 "Pegasi may fly and unicorns may have magic, but earth ponies are the pony tribe that have a special touch with the earth, and by extension the various crops and such that grow in it. If we gained the help of a few in our efforts to bring back the taigas that once were plentiful here, it would surely be more efficient and show us other ways to help our nation defend itself and prosper."

PLB_notes_from_fluttershy:0 "Notes from Fluttershy"
PLB_notes_from_fluttershy_desc:0 "Curiously, a single letter has arrived from Equestria, addressed to the Princess. While it looks completely ordinary on the outside, the courier has stated that it is of great importance, being from the Element Bearer of Kindness herself, Fluttershy. She is known for her connection with the animals and monsters of nature in Equestria, so many bears of Clan Volsungr are interested in what she has written."

PLB_troop_movement_agreements_with_equestria:0 "Military Access Agreement"
PLB_troop_movement_agreements_with_equestria_desc:0 "There is no telling when our troops may need to cross the lands of Equestria, or theirs need to cross our frigid wastelands. To ensure there is no complications in the future, a preemptive agreement will be signed allowing official access of each of our armed forces to each other's lands."

PLB_join_upa:0 "Together as One"
PLB_join_upa_desc:0 "Our destinies are already closely twined together in this world through Harmony. Now it is time to make them into one, and formally request to join Equestria's alliance. We will lend them our strength, and we will protect what is ours not as pieces, but as a whole."

PLB_fluttershy_visit:0 "Prepare for Fluttershy's Visit"
PLB_fluttershy_visit_desc:0 "Just as her note foretold, word has come that Fluttershy will be coming from Equestria to visit us in the far north. As befitting someone of her position, we should prepare for her arrival at once to ensure that there are no complications. After all, it would reflect poorly on us to have such a foreign national figure be disappointed."

PLB_crystal_advisers:0 "Invite Crystal Advisers to the Court"
PLB_crystal_advisers_desc:0 "If there is one thing the crystal ponies know how to do, it is how to defend their country. Their defensive knowledge is truly impressive, and the Princess has invited a few of their best to her court to teach them their ways."

PLB_crystal_magic_lessons:0 "Learn from Masters of Crystal"
PLB_crystal_magic_lessons_desc:0 "Taking after its namesake, the Crystal Empire has done a large amount of research into turning their large amount of magical crystals into weaponry.

PLB_pony_medicine_lessons:0 "Lessons in Crystal Medicine"
PLB_pony_medicine_lessons_desc:0 "Another area that the crystal ponies have advanced extensively in is medicine, as their doctors and medical facilities are world-renowned. Ursines are difficult to kill, but a good and knowledgeable medical department to rescue those on the brink of death could save the lives of many warriors."

PLB_align_with_cadence:0 "Align with the Princess of Love"
PLB_align_with_cadence_desc:0 "Given that Equestria is no longer a safe option to align with, at least for the moment, we must instead look towards the other bastion of Harmony in recent years. Cadance, the alicorn of love is part of the Equestrian royal family, and having her and the Empire on friendly terms would be a great benefit to us both now and for future prospects with Equestria, should they ever recover."

PLB_an_interesting_package:0 "A Rather Interesting Package"
PLB_an_interesting_package_desc:0 "The threat of a fallen Equestria is ever looming, and as such the Crystal Empire has sent us a curious package to apparently aid in defending ourselves. It is not a weapon itself, instead they are just blueprints and schematics. However, if our scholars are reading it correctly, they are plans for an energy source far beyond anything this world has ever seen before. We should look into this at once."

PLB_the_republicans_of_the_new_world_desc:0 "The avians of Nova Griffonia, perhaps taking after the Griffonian Republic, have recently transformed into a harmonic republic after the death of their governor and fresh elections.

PLB_minority_agreements:0 "Gunworks Agreement"
PLB_minority_agreements_desc:0 "The Nova Griffonians are much more advanced industrially, having great military factories that spew out weaponry. Our own griffons in Wesslandia are not as modern as they are, but instead have created new and innovative ways to create, forced out of necessity. Trading our knowledge for theirs would be mutually beneficial to both of us."

PLB_join_guardian_initiative:0 "Join the Guardians Initiative"
PLB_join_guardian_initiative_desc:0 "The griffons have created a new program called the "Guardians Initiative" which involves armed forces going all across the world to protect liberty and freedom and help safeguard themselves. And they are right, Harmony must be fought for everywhere to ensure that it not only thrives, but takes its rightful place as the dominant ideology of the world. We will support their efforts."

PLB_our_brothers_in_spirit:0 "Align with our Siblings in Spirit"
PLB_our_brothers_in_spirit_desc:0 "Long has the Yak race stood in strength close by. They, as a fellow nation of the far north, with their great traditions of SMASHing as they call it, demonstrates that the great spirit that resides in us is within them too. It only stands, then, that them and us would make natural friends and allies."

PLB_yak_bear_defence_pact:0 "Yak-Bear Defence Pact"
PLB_yak_bear_defence_pact_desc:0 "Even with our shared history, we have never actually signed any formal treaties with the Yaks to the south. In fact, the only real bonds that we had shared before our recent diplomatic moves were the ritualized combat we had regularly. That should change now, and a pact of non-aggression and friendship will cement our unity."

PLB_yak_bear_military_initiative:0 "United Military Initiative"
PLB_yak_bear_military_initiative_desc:0 "The Yak army and our own could learn much from each other if given the opportunity. They can teach us their stalwart defensive tactics and stubbornness, while we can teach them how to thrive in even the harshest of winters and relentlessly assault whatever enemy may befall us."

PLB_an_unexpected_ally:0 "Align with an Unexpected Friend"
PLB_an_unexpected_ally_desc:0 "To our complete surprise, the changelings to our west have adopted harmony just as we have. While they were once our eternal enemy, especially under the rule of Chrysalis, it seems a drone named Thorax has taken over and started them down a new path. Despite being incredibly unorthodox, we will always befriend a fellow nation of Harmony."

PLB_northern_beacon_of_harmony:0 "Northern Beacon of Harmony"
PLB_northern_beacon_of_harmony_desc:0 "Even being relatively new, the changelings' commitment to Harmony around the world is actually quite admirable. They understand things just as we do, that Harmony is the only way forward and that there are no other options but it. We shall follow in their lead, and send our own forces across the world to aid such movements wherever they may rise."

PLB_a_little_gift_in_an_iron_box:0 "A Little Gift in a Steel Box"
PLB_a_little_gift_in_an_iron_box_desc:0 "The changelings, with our recent bettering of relations have offered us a curious gift, strange weapons of steel that they say will make up the future of warfare. While some of the elders are suspicious of what they call a powerful weapon, the blueprints and sample provided do seem to be quite formidable."

PLB_not_a_force_of_reaction:0 "Not a Force of Reaction!"
PLB_not_a_force_of_reaction_desc:0 "We will not just sit idly by while our enemies grow stronger beyond our borders. No, instead we will seek out and fight them first, destroy them before they can destroy us! We will defeat them on our terms, and bring them Harmony by force!"

PLB_the_changeling_tyrant:0 "The Changeling Tyrant"
PLB_the_changeling_tyrant_desc:0 "To our west lies Queen Chrysalis and the hives, a nation bent on nothing less than the complete subjugation of all of Equus. We may not be strong enough to go on the offensive just yet, but we can still prepare for the inevitable tide. When they come for us, we shall be prepared."

PLB_economic_mobilization:0 "Prepare Our Forges"
PLB_economic_mobilization_desc:0 "The Changeling nation is much more industrialized than we are. With their greater landmass and head start on modernization, we could never hope to match them in a number of factories or production lines. Instead, we shall have our own forges work as hard as they can, and hope that it will be enough to weather the coming storm."

PLB_military_mobilization:0 "Prepare Our Citizens"
PLB_military_mobilization_desc:0 "Even if each polar bear is able to kill ten changelings, it will not matter if the enemy is able to overwhelm us with sheer numbers. Though we do not want to send bears to die in battle if they do not wish to, the future of all our kind is at stake. We will do what must be done to secure it."

PLB_fortify_the_northern_front:0 "Prepare Our Borders"
PLB_fortify_the_northern_front_desc:0 "A few fortresses spread throughout the western border will not be enough to hold the line in the slightest. We must build real defensive positions, reinforce what is already there while we still have the time. It may not hold them back forever, but it will at least delay the Changelings until we can strike back."

PLB_upa_weapon_shipments:0 "UPA Weapon Shipments"
PLB_upa_weapon_shipments_desc:0 "With our new pony allies to the south, we have been receiving new, much more modern weaponry and military technology to aid us against our joint enemy.

PLB_upa_northern_corps:0 "UPA Northern Corps"
PLB_upa_northern_corps_desc:0 "The United Ponies Alliance has created a new force comprised of only their hardiest and most capable ponies to aid us in the far north, the Northern Corps. Though the number of such ponies who can endure these harsh conditions are low, the ones that can will fight just as bravely as any bear alongside us, true companions in spirit and battle."

PLB_sorynth_occupation_zone:0 "Soryth Military Zone"
PLB_sorynth_occupation_zone_desc:0 "The Changelings have been defeated by the joint efforts of ourselves and the Equestrians, a new nation formed out of the ashes dedicated to Harmony. And yet, we did not fight this war for nothing in the end. We must ask our Equestrian allies for administration of Soryth and the surrounding wastelands, territory that would be better off under our protection anyway."

PLB_our_greatest_war:0 "Our Greatest War"
PLB_our_greatest_war_desc:0 "We are alone, alone against the menace of Equus. But we will not falter, we will not break, and we will never surrender!

PLB_our_greatest_triumph_desc:0 "Against all odds, we have prevailed. The Changeling Queendom lies defeated, the flag of the polar bears flying high over the tower of Vesalipolis.

PLB_the_polar_strike:0 "Strike Down the Arrogant"
PLB_the_polar_strike_desc:0 "As the changeling threat rose, we fortified and prepared, waiting for the storm of swords. But Chrysalis never struck, turning her gaze south, deciding to prey on creatures weaker, believing us not to be a threat. But in her arrogance she seems to have forgotten that it was lacking numbers, not fear of her armies that kept us behind Key Lake..."

PLB_it_is_our_land_2:0 "Our Eternal Land"
PLB_it_is_our_land_2_desc:0 "It is not a harmonious thing, to claim large swathes of land on some nationalist ambition. But the lands we have taken from the Changelings... they had always been bear lands and ones which we took care of, before the Queendoms came and polluted the land! And we shall return to protecting them from corruption once more."

PLB_the_griffon_tyrants:0 "The Griffon Tyrants"
PLB_the_griffon_tyrants_desc:0 "The griffons have always been a dangerous and volatile race, prone to fighting and warfare as shown on Griffonia. Many in the clans were not surprised to see our neighbors in Nova Griffonia fall to anti-harmonic ideologies. It is time to crush these tyrants."

PLB_their_worst_excesses:0 "Punish Their Worst Excesses"
PLB_their_worst_excesses_desc:0 "While fully de-industrializing Nova Griffonia is at this point infeasible, there are some particular companies and ideologues that are greater offenders to Harmony than others.

PLB_what_to_do_with_griffons:0 "What to do with Griffons?"
PLB_what_to_do_with_griffons_desc:0 "Now that the threat has been resolved, many are wondering how we shall deal with the rest of Nova Griffonia. Some say that with the anti-harmonic elements gone they can be trusted to mostly rule themselves, while others believe that direct bear protection is the only way to ensure this does not happen again."

PLB_the_perfect_frontier:0 "The Perfect Frontier"
PLB_the_perfect_frontier_desc:0 "To the griffons, the Frontier was a cold, unrelenting wasteland, a place filled with monsters and other such nightmares. But to us, it is a natural place for bears and a prime example of harmony with nature. It will now be our frontier, a perfect one of bears and griffons alike."

PLB_the_yak_situation:0 "The Yak Tyrants"
PLB_the_yak_situation_desc:0 "Prince Rutherford was once the one leader of the Yaks to the south, in solitude and isolation. And like ourselves, he opened the nation to Equestrian Harmonic values and the world at large. However, the Jaks rose up against him to maintain their tradition, and other non-harmonic elements began to fester in the nation. We must save what is left before it is too late."

PLB_maybe_jaks_had_some_good_ideas:0 "Maybe Jaks Have Some Good Ideas..."
PLB_maybe_jaks_had_some_good_ideas_desc:0 "Though their reasons were misguided, the Jaks did have a point in their breakaway against Prince Rutherford. While isolation is foolish, tradition is something to be respected and honored. We will de-industrialize their major cities, disarming them against us as well as letting them return to their old way of living, just as the Jaks wanted."

PLB_what_to_do_with_yaks:0 "What to do with Yaks?"
PLB_what_to_do_with_yaks_desc:0 "The Yaks have many similarities to us, possessing similar traits and strength. They would fit in well with our nation, and our way of life in the North. Of course, that same reasoning could be used for why they should be allowed to rule themselves..."

PLB_griffon_naturalization:0 "Griffon Naturalization"
PLB_griffon_naturalization_desc:0 "Even with our troubled history, we hold no ill intentions towards griffons as a whole. Instead, we want to foster cooperation between our races, have us live together in harmony under one nation.

PLB_they_traded_reason_for_madness_desc:0 "The penguins are an odd race, one much like ourselves in being accustomed to the frozen north. But where their nation was once one of the few we could trust, with even Clan Svartpels regarding them as kin, they have now fallen to dangerous and radical ideologies from within. It now falls to us to save them from themselves."

PLB_what_has_to_be_done:0 "What Has to be Done"
PLB_what_has_to_be_done_desc:0 "Pingland did not fall to a foreign invader or some sort of natural disaster. No, it was anti-harmonic radicals working to subvert them and take power for themselves. We have no choice now but to excise these tumors completely before they take root once more."

PLB_push_back_penguin_industrialization:0 "Push Back Penguin Industrialization"
PLB_push_back_penguin_industrialization_desc:0 "Factories are a tool just as any other, and just as any other tool they should be taken away from those that misuse it. We will destroy their industrial centers, turn back their state to that of a less modern time.

PLB_naturalized_provinces_of_pingland:0 "The Naturalized Provinces of Pingland"
PLB_naturalized_provinces_of_pingland_desc:0 "The penguins and bears have lived together for a very long time. Clan Anker, for example, is almost entirely penguin, and a sizable minority of Svartpels has penguins. With a similar process and integration into our natural state, the penguin lands themselves can become an integral part of our society."

PLB_princessdom_of_polaria:0 "Proclaim the Princessdom of Polaria"
PLB_princessdom_of_polaria_desc:0 "With our expansion into non-historical bear lands, we have taken many races other than our own under our banner. Our nation is no longer only polar bears, but filled with penguins, yaks and even griffons. A new name for our nation is necessary for this status, a protector of all the far north."

PLB_racial_harmony:0 "Racial Harmony"
PLB_racial_harmony_desc:0 "Our destiny of harmony was never meant to be for bears alone. Every race under our banner, every creature who chooses to call these lands home will be welcomed and find a place here, for only together are we truly the strongest we can be. Race will not divide us, and despite our many differences we will always have our similarities that bind us as one."

PLB_under_bear_protection:0 "Under Bear Protection"
PLB_under_bear_protection_desc:0 "The other nations and species have proven themselves too misguided, too weak to live independently on their own. We, the bears, are the only ones who have shown time and time again that only we are strong enough to protect those who cannot protect themselves. We will lead and guide them to a new beginning, and they will help us show them what true strength looks like."

PLB_harmonist_clan_integration:0 "Border Clan Integration"
PLB_harmonist_clan_integration_desc:0 "To the south of Clan Volsungr are the lush forests of snow, land that many bears have traveled to before to test their might against the strongest of Yaks. Now, that land is ours, and both it and the native Yaks and Jaks will be integrated as our own, fit with all the protections of nature and harmonic friendship that any clan land of ours has."

PLB_expand_mountain_holdings:0 "Fortresses Across Yakistan"
PLB_expand_mountain_holdings_desc:0 "Since the defeat of the Yaks and Jaks, many bears have asked to be allowed to settle down south with the clans and build their fortresses near the Yak tribes.

PLB_economic_industrial_reforms:0 "Economic-Industrial Reforms"
PLB_economic_industrial_reforms_desc:0 "Compared to the rest of the world, our economy and industry can only be stated as laughably pathetic and behind the times.

PLB_gather_their_gold_and_mines_desc:0 "There are veins of gold spread out across all the bear clans, currently under claim by whoever happens to have their fortress nearby, yet the resource goes unused due to being seen as an impractical resource. With its observed value to others, however, it has become necessary for us to extract this valuable metal. Paying off the current "landowners" will be expensive but worth it."

PLB_expand_gold_mines:0 "Expand Gold Mines"
PLB_expand_gold_mines_desc:0 "The few gold mines already established are horribly inefficient, extracting only small amounts for how much could be taken. We must discover new ways of digging deeper, faster, harder, so that our plans for the once-useless resource can be utilized to their full potential."

PLB_build_mints:0 "Built the First Mints"
PLB_build_mints_desc:0 "Having the gold is good, but it does nothing for us if it just sits around in our fortresses collecting dust. In its current state, the solid gold chunks and bars mean nothing, and attempting to sell the abroad will likely end in us getting taken advantage of. Instead, mints will be made all across the country, to begin producing our very own national coinage."

PLB_gold_based_currency:0 "Establish a Gold Based Currency"
PLB_gold_based_currency_desc:0 "The Bearit is the new gold currency created by Clan Volsungr, loosely inspired by the Equestrian bit as the official national currency of the nation.

Strange, yet also beneficial to our economy and our international standing as a whole."

PLB_green_industrialization:0 "Green Industrialization"
PLB_green_industrialization_desc:0 "One of our primary concerns has always been our relationship with nature around us.

PLB_hydro_farms:0 "Paw's Hydrofarm Expansion"
PLB_hydro_farms_desc:0 "One of Paw Wellington's more curious obsessions was with the northern ocean, of fish and ships. His hydrofarms saw limited success during his time as Despot, but they were a step in the right direction. Now we shall continue that step, and expand these farms to produce more not just for Clan Scyfling, but the nation."

PLB_more_bountiful_crops:0 "Forest Farming"
PLB_more_bountiful_crops_desc:0 "The brief time we had cut off from our supplies of fish were a difficult period that few bears wish to relive, but it did teach us something. The tubers and plant life, while in no way an equal substitute for the bounty of the sea, makes for an excellent side-food and can be easily grown en masse. And more food is never a bad thing for a polar bear."

PLB_hydropower:0 "Embrace Hydropower"
PLB_hydropower_desc:0 "The rivers that run through all our nation are strong, and a potential source of energy just waiting to be used. Hydropower costs us nothing, but gives us power, the power to continue pushing ourselves to modernity. The wheels of our machinery shall never stop turning, for our rivers shall never stop flowing."

PLB_electrification:0 "Electrify Volsungr Fortresses"
PLB_electrification_desc:0 "Providing electrical power to our clan has always been difficult, to put it mildly, due to our fortresses being dug into mountains deep below the earth. But the benefits that would come with finally having power in our homes is too great to ignore. It may take great effort, but at the end of it the electrification of Clan Volsungr will prove a stepping stone to further progress."

PLB_support_avian_weapon_producers:0 "Support Griffon Gunworks"
PLB_support_avian_weapon_producers_desc:0 "Griffon weaponry has always outclassed our own, and that includes the weapons made by the avians within our borders.

PLB_first_university_of_ecology:0 "The First University of Ecology"
PLB_first_university_of_ecology_desc:0 "We have no centers of higher learning for polar bears. Before, we were content to end our studies at the knowledge of our ancestors, but that is not enough anymore. An official university must be opened, but not just any university. It will be the first University of Ecology, a school dedicated to the learning of ursines, nature, and the constant yet important relationship between the two."

PLB_normal_advancement:0 "Rapid Industrialization"
PLB_normal_advancement_desc:0 "One of the concessions we had made to the Wesslandians during the Second Reunification was allowing them input into how our economy would be run in the future. Now it is time to pay that due, as they have surprisingly put forward rather comprehensive plans for the rapid industrialization of the nation. They may not be exactly what we had in mind, but cooperation is the basis of Harmony after all."

PLB_onlatir_military_industrial_complez:0 "Unify the Onlartir Industrial Complex"
PLB_onlatir_military_industrial_complez_desc:0 "For many years Onlartir had what outsiders call a military-industrial complex, where the clan armies and those that produced their weapons were closely intertwined. However, each clan had their own complex, leaving their efficiency combined lower than desired. Unifying these weapons producers into one group will solve this issue, letting them contribute more to the nation's warriors."

PLB_electronic_advancement:0 "Import Advanced Research Equipment"
PLB_electronic_advancement_desc:0 "We cannot start to make our own advancements and research without the equipment to do so. It has been deemed necessary for us to purchase and import various pieces of electronic equipment that we can use to conduct our own studies. One day we will be able to create our own research equipment, but for now these will help us catch up to modernity."

PLB_weslandian_civilian_sector:0 "Expand Wesslandian Goods Production"
PLB_weslandian_civilian_sector_desc:0 "Wesslandia has always had a strong civilian production center, being touched industrially and using their griffon workforce for their own benefit. Capitalizing on this by expanding these sites would both please the Wesslandians and benefit the country."

PLB_hydropowered_production_weslandia:0 "Let Rivers Raise the Hammers"
PLB_hydropowered_production_weslandia_desc:0 "While the workforce is not an issue in Wesslandia, getting power to run their larger and more difficult forges are. The large river that flows through their territory, fortunately, provides a simple solution. Hydropower was always a study of ours, and we can use it to help the Wesslandians in raising their output higher and higher."

PLB_mountain_forges_onlartir:0 "Expand Mountain Forges into Onlartir"
PLB_mountain_forges_onlartir_desc:0 "Onlartir is a very mountainous and hilly region, yet the clans there never quite mastered the art of creating forges upon those mountains.

PLB_griffon_workshops_desc:0 "The griffons of Wesslandia have been a source of their industry ever since the clans took them as their servants centuries ago.

PLB_military_integration_desc:0 "The clans have never before had a unified force of warriors, not even during the time of the Despot. But times have changed, and all clans must work as one to defeat our foes. A united military is the only option we have, should we wish to even maintain our existence."

PLB_expand_volsungr_strategy:0 "Remain Devoted to Volsungr Ways"
PLB_expand_volsungr_strategy_desc:0 "Our clan has had its own way of fighting for centuries, and there is no reason to change that even now. Our methods are more effective, more suited, and most of all what we need for the future of our army. It is not we who needs to change to fight like other clans, but they who need to learn how to fight like us."

PLB_nanooks_descend:0 "Nanooks Descend"
PLB_nanooks_descend_desc:0 "Nanooks are the elite of our army, the ones who make up the backbone of our effective forces. Their skill is unmatched in their native mountains, terrain that we are in no short supply of this far in the frozen north. Now they will take their place as the highest among our troops, the ones who will hold the line when others could not."

PLB_adopt_modern_nanook_strategies_desc:0 "Even if the experience of our Nanooks far outclasses those of other races in the mountains, the tactics we use are admittedly outdated compared to the mountaineers of other nations.

PLB_key_lake_weapons_for_nanooks:0 "Channel Key Lake Magic into Weapons"
PLB_key_lake_weapons_for_nanooks_desc:0 "Key Lake's magic is arcane and ancient, with properties that we do not quite understand yet. We do know enough however to use it to our advantage, in particular in the growing field of magical weaponry. For the only thing more terrifying than a Nanook with a gun is a Nanook with a magical gun."

PLB_elder_assistance:0 "Learn from Our Elders"
PLB_elder_assistance_desc:0 "The elders of our clan have lived for many years, seeing and knowing things we can only imagine in our wildest dreams. Their days of glorious combat and fighting may be over, but their knowledge can still be put to use. There is much to learn from them, as only with the past can we move forward to the future."

PLB_paws_lessons_on_warfare_desc:0 "Paw Wellington did learn many different things than our own Princess Eira during his exile, one of them being the doctrines of war on Griffonia. He has shown willingness in teaching us what he knows, so that we may better defend all ursines against our enemies. No matter which direction our army moves towards, the information he provides will be invaluable."

PLB_expand_nanook_ranks:0 "Expand Nanook Ranks"
PLB_expand_nanook_ranks_desc:0 "Only one single problem remains with our Nanooks, the problem of numbers. Our history within the mountains may have given us the natural affinity for them, but it is ridiculous to think that only our clan could produce the talented warriors. With effort, the ranks could swell to numbers never seen before, a true terror of the north."

PLB_adopt_more_conventional_warfare:0 "Adopt Conventional Bear Warfare"
PLB_adopt_more_conventional_warfare_desc:0 "Bears have fought both each other and outsiders since the dawn of the race itself, and many clans use ideas generally similar to each other in certain ways, such as always remaining on the offensive. It has proven to work well so far, so why replace something successful? More bears know how to fight like a panserbjørn than a nanook."

PLB_wesslandian_mass_deployement:0 "Wesslandian Mass Deployment"
PLB_wesslandian_mass_deployement_desc:0 "In terms of the Wesslandian armies, they know and taught us a single thing; that enough numbers can overwhelm any force. Having, leading and coordinating a massive enough military will practically guarantee victory, and the Wesslandian leaders have already shown interest in helping us do so."

PLB_mass_armour_deployement:0 "Paw's Armour Reserves"
PLB_mass_armour_deployement_desc:0 "Paw Wellington has a rather large amount of ursine armor in storage within Clan Scyfling's territory, equipment meant for panserbjørn. Why he did not use it in the Second War of Unification, we may never know, but now it is time to break them open and use them. They will be invaluable for future potential conflicts."

PLB_open_up_weapon_caches_desc:0 "Rifles, bullets, artillery guns and more are all hidden in caches throughout the domain of warrior lords, awaiting use when they were deemed needed.

PLB_learn_from_traditions_desc:0 "The elders have seen much in their lives, and they have fought much as well. Their experience is second to none, and their wisdom gained from countless battles could be ours, if we simply ask. Ask, listen, and they will impart all that they know."

PLB_magical_assitance:0 "Blessing from the Shaman King"
PLB_magical_assitance_desc:0 "Clan Rozenkrantz and their shamans are a very odd and mystical group, using powers beyond our understanding to hide and strike from the frozen winds as fast as lightning.

PLB_more_southern_designs_for_guns_desc:0 "The gun designs that the Equestrians use are simple, effective, and most importantly, not very cost-intensive.

PLB_greater_focus_on_support:0 "Crystal Lessons on Support"
PLB_greater_focus_on_support_desc:0 "The Crystal Empire's army has delved heavily into support companies for their troops, providing an extra edge to the ability of their average warrior.

PLB_superior_artillery:0 "Republican Artillery Schematics"
PLB_superior_artillery_desc:0 "The Griffonian Republic's Alexander Kemerskai was an avid user of artillery, using it extensively during the battles of his revolution. It was something which seemed to rub off on Paw Wellington, who also gained a fascination of the weapon.

PLB_engine_driven_armour:0 "Stalliongradian Mechanization Theories"
PLB_engine_driven_armour_desc:0 "The future of warfare lies not just in being stronger, but also faster. The formerly Equestrian region of Severyana, now collectively known as Stalliongrad has researched deep into this area, theorizing various doctrines involving the use of mechanized forces in place of their standard warrior infantry. It seems to at least be an idea worth digging into."

PLB_armoured_combat_vehicles:0 ""Acquire" Changeling Tank Schematics"
PLB_armoured_combat_vehicles_desc:0 "The most fearsome tool in the Changeling army is their tank, or Panzer as they call it. It is an armored steel beast, capable of striking down ursines with ease while shrugging off most blows. Their designs must be ours, and fortunately for us it just so happens that a few have landed right into our claws..."

PLB_ensure_technological_superiority:0 "Our Own Means of Design Production"
PLB_ensure_technological_superiority_desc:0 "We can only go so far copying the designs of other nations more advanced than we. As long as we do so, our technological advancement will be limited behind their own.

PLB_onlartir_integration_desc:0 "The warlords of Onlartir are small in number compared to the other clans.

PLB_wesslandia_integration:0 "Wesslandian Integration"
PLB_wesslandia_integration_desc:0 "The Wesslandians are strange among polar bears, with their use of a lower griffon class and their lands more recognizable of the south than anywhere here.

PLB_volsungr_integration:0 "Volsungr Integration"
PLB_volsungr_integration_desc:0 "Our old rivals in the mountain holds, Volsungr was once our proud enemy until their unfortunate fall both in bears and to Harmony during the first Unification. Their proud warrior spirit remains, though, and they are still polar bears in the end, despite their misguided beliefs.

PLB_a_benevolent_despot:0 "A Benevolent Despot"
PLB_a_benevolent_despot_desc:0 "A true despot of polar bears rules with complete authority, but also with benevolence. They lead by force, but also listen to others in their ruling. Torben is now the new Despot, and he shall lead just as the code of the ancient times demand; to create a truly unified land of all bears in the North."

PLB_our_natural_right_and_duty:0 "Our Natural Right and Duty"
PLB_our_natural_right_and_duty_desc:0 "It is the natural right and duty of the polar bears to be a protector over the North, including all the races that live under it.

PLB_our_ability:0 "Our Superior Ability"
PLB_our_ability_desc:0 "Polar bears are the strongest race known in the world, that much can not be denied. We are simply superior to all other races, for we have not only our strength but also our long and storied history. We carry with us a legacy of combat, one that shall never be forgotten."

PLB_ultimatum_to_penguins:0 "Ultimatum to the Penguins"
PLB_ultimatum_to_penguins_desc:0 "Our neighbors, the penguins, are a native race of the north much like us, wielding ice magics that even we respect. However, they are ill equipped to survive the oncoming storm, lacking size, strenght and durability. Furthermore as Clan Anker proves they are far better off under bear rule. Thus we shall demand penguin ascension into our realm so that under our benevolent protection they can thrive."

PLB_demand_to_griffons:0 "Demand Griffons Return Our Taiga"
PLB_demand_to_griffons_desc:0 "The taiga, or as the avians call it the frontier, was once rightful polar bear land. The remnants of the clans that once lived there still remain, as shattered and lifeless as they are.

PLB_show_them_our_might:0 "Show them Our Might"
PLB_show_them_our_might_desc:0 "The griffon state on this continent was nothing more than an invasion by foreign powers, an attack upon the north that brought a foreign race upon us. That land is still ours by right, and any notions of their "independence" must be swiftly crushed. They will see us as their masters, once we force them to bow."

PLB_to_victor_go_the_spoils:0 "To the Victor go the Spoils"
PLB_to_victor_go_the_spoils_desc:0 "The griffons have technology far beyond ours; Paw Wellington had recognized this, buying off weaponry from them during his reign as Despot.

PLB_turn_anker_into_greats:0 "Turn Anker into Greats"
PLB_turn_anker_into_greats_desc:0 "The Clan of Anker on Jan Mayen is majority penguin, with bears serving as benevolent leaders over the naval species.

PLB_ursines_above_avians:0 "Ursines Above Avians"
PLB_ursines_above_avians_desc:0 "Avians are nothing in strength compared to ursines, and they never shall be. Only an ursine can be a true warrior in a clan, never a griffon. They can work as servants and slaves to their betters, and we in our infinite grace will provide for them and defend them with our steel and might, as while they never belonged here, they must still now follow our ancient rules."

PLB_yak_intervention:0 "The Flames Still Burn Down South"
PLB_yak_intervention_desc:0 "The yaks and jaks have become embroiled in a conflict between tribes of their own, the proud isolationist jaks of the north rising up against the southern pony-tainted harmonists of the yaks. We must intervene while we have the chance, and save the jak cause before they are snuffed out by the misguided yaks!"

We will send them an offer to help, and should they accept we shall fight side by side as brothers for their noble cause!"

PLB_strike_yaks:0 "Break the Horns of Yaks"
PLB_strike_yaks_desc:0 "Even if we cannot help the jaks, that does not mean that we can stand by while the yaks destroy their own legacy with their subversive and most importantly foreign ideas. It may be difficult and it may sadden us, but we must take the fight to our own brothers in spirit and save not just them, but the entire north from the chance of falling to communism, harmony or any other ruinous ideology."

PLB_jak_bear_effort:0 "Winter War Effort"
PLB_jak_bear_effort_desc:0 "The jaks may stand triumphant, but we cannot rest easy on our victory. Others will always look at us with greed, seeing us as weak or backwards and wishing our destruction.

PLB_refurbish_old_suits:0 "Patch up Old Suits"
PLB_refurbish_old_suits_desc:0 "The panserbjørn are our elite forces, the warriors that charge into the fray with armor and strike with gun, axe and claw. Still, over time, many of our ancient suits have become unusable, degraded with the harsh elements of snow. With some effort, they could be repaired, so that they may once again be worn on the field of battle."

PLB_mobilization_attempts:0 "Raise New Krigsbands"
PLB_mobilization_attempts_desc:0 "We have strength, but our numbers are unfortunately not many. We need more polar bears to fight in our armies. New krigsbands will be raised, more bears recruited into our forces of warriors, so that we may have both numbers and skill over our many enemies."

PLB_transform_old_fortresses:0 "The Old Forts Still Stand"
PLB_transform_old_fortresses_desc:0 "There are many forts in Svartpels' domain, now abandoned by ursines who fell in the unification wars and never returned to their fortresses of ice and stone. With some effort and some bears willing to move in to these abandoned towers, they can be raised once more, settling new land and filling once desolate places in the harsh region we call home."

PLB_modernized_armour_efforts:0 "Armour of Unification Wars"
PLB_modernized_armour_efforts_desc:0 "During both of the Unification Wars, armor proved to be the key difference between victory and defeat for many warriors in battles. However, the armor of the modern era is not that of the Panserbjørn, but of trucks and fast-moving vehicles. Perhaps they are not as honorable or glorious in combat, but it would remain prudent to keep up to date on such technologies."

PLB_anker_expansion:0 "Raise Cities of Shimmering Ice"
PLB_anker_expansion_desc:0 "Other than Clan Anker, the fact remains that we have never cared much for the navy, save small boats for catching our primary food of fish. That must change. We will raise great cities and invite friends from Anker to teach us the ways of shipmaking, and perhaps learn more about their warfare in the process."

PLB_every_bear_a_smith:0 "Embrace the Warrior-Smith Tradition"
PLB_every_bear_a_smith_desc:0 "Back in older times, ursine warriors were their own smiths. They created their own weapons of war, and their own craftsmanship was what decided victory and defeat on many occasions. We should renew this tradition, only this time with more modern creations for bears to use. We will need the extra equipment, even if coordination among smiths may prove a bit... difficult."

PLB_born_of_thunder:0 "Born of Thunder"
PLB_born_of_thunder_desc:0 "Every panserbjørn of Clan Svartpels is not only forced to go through rigorous trials of knowledge and combat, but is also forced as their final test to withstand a strike of lightning itself. Those that survive are equal to none, not even in the other clans in their sheer prowess and might. That is the mentality that we all have; our power is great, our will moreso, and none shall rival us on the field of battle!"

PLB_anker_tradition:0 "Learn from Anker Elders"
PLB_anker_tradition_desc:0 "Clan Anker, being majority penguin has always seen the waters as more of a home than bears have. Where we saw a simple source of food, they saw a new land, a new realm of combat to emerge victorious in. For hundreds of years, they have perfected the art of sailing the seas, and all ursines should listen to their guidance when it comes to that of the navy."

PLB_forge_the_weslandian_alliance:0 "Forge the Wesslandian Alliance"
PLB_forge_the_weslandian_alliance_desc:0 "The alliance of the Wesslandians was clearly a product of foreign influence, but perhaps something good can still come of it. After all, it is much easier to work with one collective entity than with three. With some work and perhaps a few threats, we can turn Wesslandia into a united land, a place with limitless potential for the future of ursines."

PLB_shared_river_production_lessons:0 "Let Icy Waters Fuel our Forges"
PLB_shared_river_production_lessons_desc:0 "Wesslandia's forges are powered by the rivers that run through their land, a concept that was never implemented in the rest of the clans. However, we cannot argue with its effectiveness or its efficiency. This "hydropower" as they call it will be taught to all ursines, and hopefully provide some benefits to our industry in the future."

PLB_combined_industrial_ability:0 "A Forge Like Never Seen Before"
PLB_combined_industrial_ability_desc:0 "The forges in Wesslandia are modern compared to our own, but also fragmented. Their lack of coordination ultimately renders many of them irrelevant or unusable on a larger scale. But if we were to combined them all into one, create a massive set of forges never seen before by ursines, we could finally benefit from their large population."

PLB_open_up_wesslandian_mines:0 "More Griffons into the Mines"
PLB_open_up_wesslandian_mines_desc:0 "There is much untapped potential in Wesslandia in the form of their mines, numerous resources that simply do not have the ursines to work in them. So, the straightforward solution is to send the griffons from their slave caste there instead. They will build the roads and mine the ore that will create the backbone of our power, as an easy and plentiful workforce."

PLB_armour_up_falsen_ships:0 "Armour Up Falsen Arks"
PLB_armour_up_falsen_ships_desc:0 "The ships of Falsen have potential, but their armor and weaponry is laughable compared to others in the modern day. But while they did not have the resources to fix that problem, we do. With steel and ursine might, the boats shall become prides of a new navy, one that all creatures will learn to respect and fear."

PLB_triple_farm_unification:0 "Plant Across Tundra and Taiga"
PLB_triple_farm_unification_desc:0 "The farms of the three clans are inefficient and barely feed their own ursines alone. They must be unified much like we did their forges, brought together and expanded to produce more of that foods that we consume. More food means more ursines, and more importantly more potential warriors ready to kill and die in glorious combat."

PLB_naval_tech_into_land_armour:0 "Drive the Arks onto Land"
PLB_naval_tech_into_land_armour_desc:0 "Not all of the boats of Falsen are exactly seaworthy, even with armor. But in the process of refitting them, we have noticed that they bear a striking similarity to the armored land vehicles that others use. Perhaps, with a bit of further retooling to be used on land instead of sea, these creations can still be of some use."

PLB_the_great_weslandian_army:0 "The Great Wesslandian Army"
PLB_the_great_weslandian_army_desc:0 "One thing the Wesslandians certainly have is numbers. With their prosperous lands, in sheer population they outnumber many other clans. And with our guidance and supervision, that horde of polar bears could be transformed into something more than what we previously defeated in the Second Unification. An army of both numbers and skill, a true force to be reckoned with."

PLB_weslandian_industrialization:0 "Wesslandian Industrialization"
PLB_weslandian_industrialization_desc:0 "We have made a lot of progress in Wesslandia. It has been transformed from a land of eternal conflict between clans into one of our strongest regions, in terms of both bears and production. So much so, perhaps, that our entire country is benefiting from their modernization. After all, we are now all together in this new realm, for better or for worse."

PLB_her_right_to_rule:0 "Her Right to Rule"
PLB_her_right_to_rule_desc:0 "Despite her previous ideological beliefs in the weakness of the Equestrians, Eira remains the strongest of her clan and therefore still retains the right of rule as her title of "princess". Her defeat at Torben's paws, however, seems to have shaken something in her. Perhaps the warrior spirit that remains in Volsungr also remains in Eira?"

PLB_leave_it_untouched_by_civilization:0 "Wildlands Will Not Be Corrupted"
PLB_leave_it_untouched_by_civilization_desc:0 "One of Volsungr's key unshakable points was preservation of the natural state in the North. And they are correct; the wildlife and beasts are as much a part of this land as we are. They must be preserved, kept untouched by the rise of "civilization" that has arrived even here, to remind us of what things once were and how they must remain."

PLB_nothing_to_be_wasted:0 "Nothing Shall be Wasted"
PLB_nothing_to_be_wasted_desc:0 "With the state of our lands, we can let nothing go unused. Every shred of metal, every piece of scrap must be utilized to the best of our ability. We shall never want, so long as we never waste the resources we have been given as protectors of the northern lands."

PLB_machines_under_the_mountain:0 "The Great Volsungr"
PLB_machines_under_the_mountain_desc:0 "Volsungr, even with all the events of the past is still a great clan in its own right, and not one to be easily trifled with. They have come with a serious request, to be allowed to spread the knowledge they have gained over the years of exiles to the rest of the bear clans and teach them their own knowledge. Torben may not agree with it or the sources of their knowledge, but some concessions must be made to maintain peace."

PLB_great_hunters:0 "Gather the Great Hunters"
PLB_great_hunters_desc:0 "The Nanooks are an odd type of warrior, to put it in the lightest sense. They never used the traditional kind of battleaxe like the panserbjørn, and were more suited to fighting the monsters of the mountains than anything else. But what they did, they did with a ferocity even those of Svartpels are impressed by, and their hunters may even be able to teach us their ways, as untraditional as they may be."

PLB_iron_behemoths:0 "Forge the Iron Behemoths"
PLB_iron_behemoths_desc:0 "Tanks. More armored than even the heaviest panserbjørn, with a stronger weapon than even the largest axe. The largest of these weapons are impressive to even ursines, and we must get our paws on them. These iron behemoths will create a new form of our army, a new armor from old."

PLB_equality_through_military_methods:0 "Proclaim Equality Through Force"
PLB_equality_through_military_methods_desc:0 "Whelps have never been particularly respected in the clans due to having no use in society. They are weak, unfit to be a warrior. But that is changing, as now only they with their small size are able to use the new tanks and weapons of war we have created. Force has proven an effective means of reaching equality, and with whelps fighting side by side with warriors in their tanks, that equality has finally been achieved."

PLB_foreign_sciences:0 "The Power of Foreign Sciences"
PLB_foreign_sciences_desc:0 "It may be wrong and unbearlike, but no intelligent ursine can deny now that foreign influence and Volsungr are now almost intertwined as one. And because of that, we must respect that clan culture as a part of our culture as well. They have much to offer, teaching us the ways of others, and we will grudgingly accept to keep our clans united as one."

PLB_question_of_freedom:0 "The Question of Hierarchy"
PLB_question_of_freedom_desc:0 "An issue has arisen involving the Wesslandians, one that we must arbitrate personally. Many bears, those of Volsungr chief among them believe that the Wesslandians can not be trusted to rule themselves and must bend the knee to another, in this case Princess Eira. They do make a compelling case, and yet allowing one clan dominance over others goes against the traditional ties of tyrant and lesser, as well as our idea of unity. Still, a choice must be made..."

PLB_support_wesslandians:0 "Wesslandians are Their Own Lords"
PLB_support_wesslandians_desc:0 "The clans of Wesslandia are still ursines, and thus deserve the right to stand alone. They may be strange and their ideas offensive to many bears, but that does not mean they do not deserve their opinion and their ideas heard either. They will have a say in things, just as any clan does."

PLB_digging_deep:0 "So Much Yet Untapped"
PLB_digging_deep_desc:0 "There is still massive amounts of resources under us that we simply lack the means to reach, steel and iron that lies just beyond our grasp. The Wesslandians know this, and their experiments into new methods to finally utilize these precious materials at any cost should be used in all the clans, so that we all can grow stronger."

PLB_taming_the_wild:0 "Taming the Wilderness"
PLB_taming_the_wild_desc:0 "Our land is a wild one, filled with beasts and monsters untold that we struggle with every day in the North. The wildlands serve now as nothing more than a deterrent, an obstacle towards ursine progress and supremacy. We have tamed the ice, we have tamed the snow, and we shall tame whatever is in our way as well, no matter the price!"

PLB_support_volsungr:0 "A Princess Stands Above any Lord"
PLB_support_volsungr_desc:0 "Lessers are ruled by their greaters. That is the law of the wild, and so it shall remain. Volsungr, as a great clan shall hold dominion over the Wesslandian lands and keep them in check. Eira may be strange, but she is a capable leader nonetheless; she still knows her duties and the rules of ursinekind."

PLB_the_great_wilds:0 "Expand The Great Wilds"
PLB_the_great_wilds_desc:0 "The wilds are a magical place, especially this far in the north. However, over the years they have been pushed back by the Wesslandians and their modernity, by their griffon caste using more and more for their industry. These must be reversed, the wilds expanded instead of reduced, so that we can study them and perhaps learn from it and its methods of defending itself."

PLB_beast_legions:0 "Raise Legions of Beasts"
PLB_beast_legions_desc:0 "The beasts of our land may be savage and fierce, but so are we. All creatures here are united in polar spirit, and as creatures of cold and ice.

PLB_the_warlord_triad:0 "The Warlord Triad"
PLB_the_warlord_triad_desc:0 "Kane, Gotlung and Rozenkrantz. The three clans that make up the territory of Onlartir, and some of the most savage and warlike ursines of anybear. These three warlords are small in number but strong in might; with the three, much about warfare may be revealed to us."

PLB_kane_gun_research:0 "Learn from Kane Gunsmiths"
PLB_kane_gun_research_desc:0 "Clan Kane was the most straightforward of the clans in combat. They fight directly like the bear tactics of old, with mighty panserbjørn and waraxe in claw. But they have also done research into modern weaponry during the last years of Paw's reign, gunsmiths experimenting using knowledge of the past. They can teach us their new ways in the forges."

PLB_gotlung_support_research:0 "Invite Gotlung Elders to Teach"
PLB_gotlung_support_research_desc:0 "Clan Gotlung has always believed in a more defensive mentality than other ursines. Perhaps not the most honorable approach, but one that has its merits.

polarbear.1.t:0 "The Yearly Review"
polarbear.1.d:0 "Chill spread through the air as Paw Wellington let out a heavy breath. He flipped over another page of the manuscript, looking through the somewhat amateurishly written runes and numbers. He missed the typed-out text on easy to handle white or yellow paper he would read from during his exile in Griffonia. However even if it would take time to properly read through the report, the impressions from skimming through were not good. The progress was even slower than the previous year. Less reforms finished, not enough farms and manufactories finished and of course Key Lake plans unsuccessful like always... \n\n"Is everything to your liking, Elder?" the whelp that had delivered the report questioned. Paw had almost forgotten the lesser bear was there, as it waited for any kind of response.\n\n"Thank you for the concern, but everything is fine. You may go ho... You may retreat to your quarters." The whelp bowed its head and left the chamber, closing the whalebone door behind it.\n\nWellington laid down the leather manuscript on the iron table and stood up from a chair of bone and chitin. He approached the window of clearest ice and gazed into the welcoming blizzard outside.\n\nWhat was the mistake that he was committing, what was the failure? Why were there so many setbacks in his plan to turn the north into a proper state? When Grover of the Griffons united his kin, there was nothing like that. The Empire he forged in but less than a decade stood united and prospered. Of course Grover had earned the blessing of Boreas even before his great conquests... \n\nPaw scratched his chin."
polarbear.1.a:0 "Perhaps All-Father doesn't find me worthy yet?"

polarbear.2.t:0 "Empty Cellars"
polarbear.2.d:0 "This shouldn't have been a surprise. After all, modernizing an entire country was not something that would have been cheap or easy for any one clan. So much steel and coal was required for modernizing production, so much gold was needed to buy griffon products which bears simply couldn't produce yet. A permanent process of modernization for almost half a decade should have been something to be proud of, considering it was all purely on the resources of a single clan...\n\nYet Paw didn't feel pride. If anything he was angry, though not at his clan. After all, Clan Scyfling had done the best it could with resources available. No, he was mostly angry at himself. He shouldn't have ignored how much loot there was left from the bear unification... Now they only had fish left to trade with the world. Iron was too important to give up after all. Of course, there was another possibility, something that the elders of other clans would most definitely react to with cub-like glee and sadistically exploit, but which was necessary now that his own clan had nothing left to spare."
polarbear.2.a:0 "Let's hope I don't have to break them again for this..."

polarbear.3.t:0 "The Clans Refuse to Provide Financial Support"
polarbear.3.d:0 ""You can leave now, thank you for bringing the news." Paw Wellington tried to sound as polite as possible as the whelp left the room. He might have been called "The Despot" or "The Tyrant" and if his old friends from Nova Griffonia saw him now, they would definitely say the same, but he remembered the lesson he learned in Aquileia; to control a large populace one needed to use both terror and kindness.\n\nOnly when the whalebone door closed and sealed the chamber shut did the paw of the Clan Scyfling Elder impact the table as Paw Wellington allowed his frozen rage to seep out. He knew the elders had received the requests, he knew they heard what was asked and required and he most certainly knew they had the resources to comply with the request. He had spies and informants among their ranks after all. Yet almost everyone, except the ever so dutiful Elder Torben of Clan Svartpels, claimed that their clans had fallen onto hard times or simply didn't respond.\n\nIt's as if they took him for a fool! Had they forgotten what happened just half a decade ago? Did they want to go the way of Rosensverd and Tordenstjerne? No, perhaps they simply didn't understand the importance of such resources, especially when they were being asked and not forced... Maybe they felt this helps their rival clans?\n\nOr perhaps they felt his hold was weakening now that he needed their support?"
polarbear.3.a:0 "All-Father willing we will show them wrong..."

polarbear.4.t:0 "The Greatest Betrayal "
polarbear.4.d:0 "Paw Wellington roared into the air, frozen air streaming outwards from his jaws. He tore through the manuscript, scratching the steel table beneath it. This was absurd, outrageous, and extremely uncharacteristic for his species. At first they displayed an almost griffon-like ability to reinterpret the orders and demands he had sent out. Then they, in a fashion more similar to changelings than any other species in just how disgusting it was, backstabbed and betrayed him in absurd acts of self-destructiveness by destroying their own farms and fleets as if just to spite him! But those actions were nothing compared to this! To attack the panserbjørn of one's tyrant without a proper reasoning was breaking any and all laws! By the All-Father this was a betrayal greater than what had killed entire clans! They would have to be punished, seven other clans have to be punished in some way. But when Paw thought about what sort of brutality would have to be invoked as a show of power in such a situation... No, he couldn't do something like that... Perhaps he had gone soft or too weak, he assumed Torben would do it without thinking too much, but contemplating such mass destruction, even in a state of such rage made him pause. There had to be some other way...\n\nPaw Wellington knelt beneath an ancient statue dedicated to the All-Father. A creation of frozen stone, shaped into a strange, yet awe inspiring bear-like armoured beast, once marking the midpoint of a road between Clan Scyfling and the countless clans that used to exist on the western side of Key Lake. However now it was used as an indication of land where the rule of the Hive of Soryth began. Paw Wellington would travel to this monument monthly whenever he could, both to give his respects for the greatest of divinities and to visit the few fortresses remaining here that kept watch so that Chrysalis didn't get any ideas. It would have been nice to visit other similar fortifications scattered across other empty borderlands across all of the Polar Bear owned North...\n\nA realization dawned for Paw Wellington. A show of power that other clans would be forced to respect. Something which could also be considered a true punishment for all their wrongdoings! He gazed up at the pseudo-ursine statue again."
polarbear.4.a:0 "Thank you All-Father!"

polarbear.5.t:0 "No Honor for Them in War Like This"
polarbear.5.d:0 ""Has he gone truly mad?" The Grand Elder Ase of Clan Kane growled as one of her own spawn, though with the helmet it wore she couldn't remember which, not that it mattered really at this point, continued describing the sort of absurd, unnecessary and even treasonous to the bear way of life "reforms" that "Paw Wellington" was trying to enforce through the use of the new "recruitment stations" staffed by the panserbjørn of his own clan.\n\nFrom the very beginning she was sceptical of such dreams and ambitions of the despot, since after all he seemed to be so aligned towards what griffons and changelings represented. It was disgusting to say the absolute least, for a polar bear to try to imitate species so minor and frail. It's why she and lesser Elders agreed to simply ignore the request for resources to trade. It just stank of weakness akin to griffons and changelings. Though it seemed that Scyfling realized their mistake and now they were demanding, not asking. So at least there was something respectable there. And so Kane humoured the request, only to find out this absurdity. The Scyfling were not organizing a force of attack or defense against any sort of attack! They were not even arming weaklings that don't deserve it in the typical fashion for "Paw". No, they were in fact trying to forge an army loyal to one bear- "Wellington" himself! In betrayal to all duties of tyrant to lesser and lesser to tyrant, the bears of other clans were being forced to train to fight and die not for their clan, but for the despot!\n\nAs a clan that had put their axes down for Paw and whose leaders fell beneath his clans, Kane couldn't just rebel, but as laws and duties were broken on all levels, Kane simply could choose not to listen to such orders.\n\nWhile Kane didn't openly announce such defiance, word, rumour and news travelled by themselves, and soon most other clans had joined in to simply refuse to send the bears of their clan to serve in the armies organized by Paw. In fact, many seemed to feel so insulted that they stopped patrolling the western borders with the Changelings, something that was previously done willingly, forcing Paw Wellington and Clan Scyfling to compensate with bodies of their own."

polarbear.6.d:0 "Fritjof knew he would be exiled into the wastes of Nova Griffonia where he would perhaps fall prey to cannibals or radicals over this. He was no bear, couldn't even compare in mass or combat prowess and thus stood no chance in a duel. He was but a griffon after all, born of servants, and even when given a place at the table of the warriors for being an exception among his kind, he was still not on par, neither in power, nor perception by others and those above. However this also meant that if an "owlbear" committed a betrayal of such proportions it would not be blamed onto the clan, but rather the accusations and retribution would fall purely onto his warband, for most bears still believed that even uplifted griffons couldn't truly persist and understand the nobility, brotherhood and honour of the clan system.\n\nIt wasn't fair of course, it wasn't just in any true way. It was perhaps even absurd that he was sacrificing the future of his own and others like him who managed to carve their way up from mere servants into warriors. But as the Falsen fleet burned in the distance and the plans of the Despot of exerting more control over the Wesslandian clans was shattered, Fritjof couldn't help but grin."

polarbear.7.d:0 "Eira, the Princess of Clan Volsungr, surveyed the "scribes" of Clan Scyfling that had presented themselves for her. Apparently Paw Wellington had sent out the closest his clan had to scientists to "teach" other clans the advancements he had brought back from his travels in Griffonia and learn whatever science and magic that other clans had created. She couldn't help but notice a rather patronizing tone with the request, especially humorous as the despot referred to his own "scientist" equivalents, something rather outdated and medieval sounding.\n\nThough it didn't matter how Paw Wellington had framed this request, or well, more order if anything, she knew that it was just another way to attempt to control and stifle other clans, instead of actually trying to understand or care why everybear except Svartpels didn't consider him a proper tyrant. Clan Volsungr had to comply of course, even if she was more Equestrian than Polar in character after her exile, Eira still understood and respected the laws of her homeland. But she also understood intricacies of modern politics. She just hoped that the elders of other clans were smart or cunning enough to see the easily exploitable mistakes in how Paw Wellington had worded his order...\n\nAs the "scribes" were guided out of the hall to be led to the chambers within the great Volsungr mountain fortress where they could rest, Eira turned to one of her former exile bodyguards and murmured."

After all, if a bear is exiled out of any lands inhabited by his kinds, instead of simply his own clan, then they must be quite the radical and in some cases even transgressors against all laws mortal and spiritual. Perhaps many of them had reformed in exile, perhaps they have dropped their absurd and amoral ideas that they fought and fell for. However we can never be sure, especially considering how long polar bears can hold down on their ideals, even during the darkest days of exile. Paw Wellington knew of course, being one of such dishonored and radical exiles who was banished who kept up his ideals of modernization and adaptation of griffon-like methods for decades.\n\nHowever, even if we are doing this in what is a clear insult and attempt to show power over other clans, it would perhaps be wise to not anger them too much. Perhaps limiting ourselves to the least dangerous groups would show both our power and dominance when it comes to where it matters to the other clans while also not causing too much outrage. On the other paw, we can simply accept everyone back and hope that when conflict arises we have enough new recruits that we are simply numerous enough so that no other clan thinks they can win. However, taking the more radical option could lead to losing our only current and firm ally, Lord Torben of Clan Svartpels..."

Paw Wellington had annulled all duties, alliances and tyrant-subjugated connections between any and all clans. It was surprising to know that all clans had complied to the demand. However, the horror unleashed by this untamed, wild war had torn at his very being. It was a result of all what he had done. All of his mistakes... In front of his clan, he continued looking stern and strong as they gathered for war. But on the holy grounds he felt so weak, so confused...\n\nWhat had he done wrong? He tried to mimic the great Emperors Grover I and II, sometimes also tapping into the successes of liberator Alexander Kemerskai. Had these been wrong inspirations? Had he not noticed something integral...\n\nPerhaps he should have taken Torben seriously back then, when the Lord of Thunder joked that he has become too griffonized for his own good, too ignorant of clan systems and too adamant in his ideas of superiority, that he needed allies not subjects... Perhaps that might have saved him then. But now... Now it seemed that there was only war..."

scyfling.3.d:0 "For as long as the oldest scriptures of both bear and foreign origins have recorded, our race has always been one of warriors and warmongers. We waged war on each other and on yaks and when changelings and griffons pushed into our frozen realm we fought them too. Some even say that we have waged war on the land itself as we had to fight both the climate and the beasts before we tamed even our very homeland. Our very society has been defined by this struggle. Every leader, every influential figure, even the greatest and most revolutionary smiths and scribes have been great fighters for only through combat can one show the strength of their ideas to their betters.\n\nYet even among a society that glorifies war so much, the three clans of Onlartir are considered above and beyond when it came to militarism. For it was them who stood for centuries as a wall against rogue Yak Khans and Changeling hordes, all while continuing a seemingly eternal conflict between each other. It had perhaps been a good thing that the land was as desolate and unfitting to sustain life as it came, for had Onlartir clans not been the least numerous ones, one of them would certainly overrun the north far before Paw Wellington had returned from exile. Though even with their lacking numbers, the subjugation of the Onlartir clans was the most difficult of campaigns during the first unification and took the entire might of both clans Scyfling and Svartpels.

For what better place for two warlords, one potentially on rise and another on seeming decline, than on the field of what could soon be a battle?\n\nHowever, in disappointment to some, that battle would never manifest, for an agreement would be reached. Though in a true bear fashion, quite a few red puddles would soon appear on the light blue ice and several of the "diplomats" were forced to leave due to broken or even shattered bones as the more difficult disagreements were solved by duels till near death. Even Paw Wellington himself was forced to take on several Kane elders to truly prove the necessity of a proper and united polar bear army, though he couldn't fully show his own competence as Ase of Kane wrestled him to a standstill.\n\nThe final solution was perhaps not the most satisfactory for either group, but Onlartir forces would fight for Clan Scyfling, as long as Paw Wellington upheld his duties as a proper tyrant, allowed them to be led by their own warlords in battle, and took several panserbjørn as military advisors."

Paw Wellington gazed at the fortress seemingly built to stop another Scyfling march against the closest thing Clan Gotlung had to a capital...\n\nOne could sense the smugness that the Gotlung bears radiated as Paw Wellington and his best panserbjørn had marched through their, admittedly, impressive set of fortifications, though only the cubs and perhaps some of the more enthusiastic and young warriors would openly show it. It was not the sort of silent egotistic pride of how griffons would act and of course not the almost absurdly cublike and comedic arrogance of ponies. Both of those were tolerable. Yet when it came to bears, it was almost always a feeling of predatory superiority. A bear that smugly grins at you sees not a defeated adversary or sub-par acquaintance, they see defeated prey, even if it was merely a moral or psychological victory. And with such a mentality spread out among the Gotlung panserbjørn and perhaps elders, for some time it seemed negotiations would fail.\n\nThe final agreement was far more beneficial towards Paw Wellington and Clan Scyfling than they would have assumed from what in another case would be an admit of defeat. Yet perhaps the way the Kane situation unfolded had convinced the Elder Council of Gotlung to rethink their previous position. The agreement was rather simple if anything. A simple tyrant-subject relationship with one simple demand - that being that the elders or potential leader of Clan Gotlung, if one would rise to such rank ever again, would be allowed to partake in creation and enactment of new law in order for their autonomy and traditions to be protected."

scyfling.12.d:0 "Polar bears didn't like living on high mountains. The terrain was dangerous, and the winds and storms could overpower even the greatest of ursines. The local beasts were similarly dangerous, often being more magical than flesh due to the closeness to the power of northern lights. Yet it was from the top of the tallest mountain in Onlartir that the shaman lord of Rozenkrantz gazed upon the untamed power within the heavens...\n\nThe sight at the peak of the mountain was surprising to say the least. The Shaman Lord of Rozenkrantz, one who had abandoned their name and existence before achieving such position was sitting on a throne of ice and bone almost unprotected, with barely half a dozen others of its order and just a tiny group of panserbjørn as guards. It would have been absurd to assume that this was everything, yet it was hard to imagine where else any other bears would have hidden in such an unforgiving terrain. It was of course an attempt to create a sense of power. To potentially intimidate an opponent with the implication that they could be taken down with nothing more than a small warband. Yet while it was somewhat impressive, it couldn't exactly compare to power plays one would see in Griffonia.\n\nPaw Wellington had expected a bit more defiance, aggression, even absurd demands under threats of unseen forces perhaps, yet the Shaman Lord had been mostly... compliant and agreeable. Perhaps this had been because Clan Rozenkrantz had gazed into the winter lights and seen futures where Scyfling had come to crush them and assumed this was an attempt to demand subservience? Whatever was the case, the final agreement was reached relatively soon. The duties of tyrant and subject were reiterated to be remembered in front of winter lights so that the divine could hear them this time and punish the transgressors if one side would break the deal, something that Paw Wellington was not the most enthusiastic about yet still performed the deed. The only thing demanded beyond the traditional duties was that shamans of Rozenkrantz would accompany Paw Wellington during his campaign and rule as both assistants and observers.

And thus two armies met on a frozen field...\n\nPerhaps, had the armies of Clan Scyfling been led by any other Elder, they would have most likely lost if they tried to fight Clan Kane in anything approaching a traditional manner. They were the more numerous force of course, nearly outnumbering the enemy three to one. It was understandable, a single minor clan could never raise enough troops to match a Greater Clan. Yet as always, the ursines of Onlartir were more than large and strong enough, that had they cut through the distance, lines would shatter and victory would be theirs. It was an ancient strategy, simple, and for the longest time, difficult to counter, even if Kane lacked heavy support. However, such a tactic required ground that could be charged through. And thus, in what was a rather dishonourable and sordid action, the land between the armies was bombarded by artillery and explosives, making the ground simply impossible to charge through, trapping them in a defensive position which was charged by the more numerous Scyfling forces. Yet had Paw Wellington not subdued Grand Elder Ase of Clan Kane and forced her to surrender in the middle of the brawl into which the battle had devolved, the victory would have been bloody and potentially not even belong to Clan Scyfling.\n\nHowever even in defeat, Kane refused to put down their axes and bow, for they claimed Paw Wellington fought them without honour and showed the same disrespect for tradition he had shown before in countless other situations. It seemed as if Kane would only break if a true bloodbath ensued. Yet it didn't take that, for instead of ordering another assault, Paw Wellington merely invited the Clan Kane Elders to a "weapon demonstration". Whatever the weapon was shown to them, the demonstration ended with a tyrant-subject agreement. Though this time, both sides were truly chained with duties."

Their new fortress was impressive to say the absolute least, something that Paw Wellington couldn't deny even while he and his best panserbjørn were tearing through the corridors and halls within the allegedly impenetrable fort, yet it was built for heavily outdated ways of war, not accounting for modern artillery and explosives, which just like the first time, punched holes through its great walls. And yet still, despite being outnumbered and their walls broken through, Gotlung fought tooth and nail, often literally, for every corridor and anything resembling a defensible position.\n\nOf course, eventually the elder council and their troops stepped down, surrendering against the superior forces and abilities of the despot whose chains they thought they had thrown away. However this time Paw Wellington had promised, in front of everybear of Clan Gotlung and Clan Scyfling, that this time the traditions and autonomy of Gotlung would be respected so that a war like this would not repeat."

Yet it was from the top of the tallest mountain in Onlartir that the shaman lord of Rozenkrantz gazed upon the untamed power within the heavens...\n\nAnd it was perhaps with this untamed power that Rozenkrantz fought, for there was no other explanation on how they still possessed the force with which they fought at Skybreaker Peak despite most other fortresses being subdued. For at every turn and every step of the march to the top of the mountain they were harassed and engaged by panserbjørn and shamans. By themselves these small groups would cause no danger in anything resembling proper battle. Yet they would engage the advancing Scyfling column from the sides, attacking through what had to be some sort of magical coverage of wind and snow, slaying or at least tying up dozens of warriors before seemingly retreating into the mountain itself. Sometimes entire streams of snow and ice would appear, cutting off advancement for tens if not hundreds of bears, who were now forced to dig through as they were engaged by the enemy. The only solitude was in the fact that even in something approaching hit and run tactics Rozenkrantz warriors refused to merely strike and retreat. Instead, they would stay and fight until they themselves were wounded or felled or such a fate happened to a Scyfling bear. Though more often than not it was the Scyfling bears that fell. And yet the column kept advancing higher and higher, Paw Wellington leading from the front, inspiring his increasingly exhausted forces.\n\nThe battle of the peak would be a far smaller engagement than one could expect for an engagement for the future of an entire clan as barely a hundred bears, almost evenly split between the clans tore at each other. Initially the shaman clan seemed to be the ones that would come out on top, yet they had no reserves and their troops were tied up on the mountain itself, while Clan Scyfling warriors, if slowly, were seeping into the battle in greater and greater numbers. Eventually this had become too much and the Shaman Lord had to lay down his axe and surrender, followed by his clan.\n\nThe renewal of oaths would have been almost a mirror of the last time, and had it indeed been the same, the bitterness of both defeats would perhaps continue to fester, had it not been for the fact that this time the battle was fought and oaths were given under the Winter Lights."

And thus, two armies met on a frozen field...\n\nIn any other case, one would be forgiven for assuming that even if Clan Kane was outnumbered three to one, their superior combat ability and the element of surprise would have allowed for a stalemate or even an unexpected victory. After all, Clan Kane was famous or even infamous for the size and strength of their warriors. Had this been a traditional engagement, Clan Kane would have charged into their enemies seeking to overwhelm them through sheer force of what could be likened to an avalanche of angry armoured beasts, all while said enemy would be bombarded with either cannons or the closest thing to machine guns that was available. Something which in this engagement the Kane force was lacking. If one subscribed to the traditional bear sense of honour, Clan Scyfling would not use their own heavy weapons. Yet it has been decided by Paw Wellington, that this would not be allowed to be a traditional engagement. This was not part of a war... It was part of an extermination. And for this duty, something never before seen or even imagined for most bears, and most likely not widely seen even among Changelings and Griffons - "hunting rifles" meant to take down dragons. Barely a dozen of such weapons were available to Clan Scyfling, yet they were the turning point. The very first volley tore through the Clan Kane avalanche, which was then hit by artillery. After that it was a slaughter...\n\nWith their greatest warriors and even their elders gone, slain perhaps quite unfairly in battle, the fortresses didn't hold for long either. They were rather quickly turned into nothing more than butcheries. Only some of the whelps or cubs were spared, for they were too young or too... lacking in intelligence and physical might to cause any danger or hold any grudge.\n\nAnd such was the end of clan Kane."

This way was far easier indeed, far less costly than it would be any other way. Yet also so much more brutal and disrespectful for the dead. Clan Gotlung had thought they made an unbreakable fortress, yet they had done nothing more than prepare themselves a mass grave...\n\nArtillery, explosives, the few dozen anti-dragon rifles and even several improvised flame-throwers, all unleashed their fury on the walls of what any other bear force would have seen as the greatest of modern fortresses. Perhaps, had it been any other force with any other intent, they would have stopped their bombardment after a few days. Maybe they would give up after the dozenth time Gotlung panserbjørn had sallied out of the fortress, crushing through Scyfling forces.

Clan Rozenkrantz was the only one among clans of Onlartir whose "capital" fortress was not in a somewhat easily accessible location, rather the Skybreaker Peak was surrounded by lesser fortifications on all sides, which had to be taken or at least tied up in combat before one could march on the sky-rending mountain itself. And thus, the entire elder and leader generation of the Clan was slowly pushed back while being forced to watch as their entire clan was obliterated, bit by bit. And they channelled any and all magics and other forbidden forces that was available to them. Yet this was not enough and eventually it all came to the peak itself where the nameless Shaman lord fell beneath the claws of Paw Wellington and his best panserbjørn and shamans were crushed under the power of the dozen griffon made anti-dragon rifles that Clan Scyfling had brought up to this height for the sole duty of extermination.\n\nThe only survivors of Clan Rozenktranz extermination were too young or too low on the clan hierarchy due to lacking magical or combat talent.

scyfling.34.d:0 "Wesslandia has always been the region of polar bear lands which is the most strange and wondrous for the bears, yet perhaps the most normal for most creatures that do not thrive in winter and cold. Its forests are plentiful of both berries and game and stretch on seemingly forever. The game itself is rather more similar to what one would see in "normal" forests of Northern Griffonia or even Severyana instead of the strange half magical beasts that roam most of the land. Even the land itself is incredibly fertile, bearing tubers and plenty other mostly edible, if bland and long growing, arctic plants. Even the Northmost sea seems to be more plentiful in fish and seal near the region. Yet despite all of this, no great clan or great warlord arose from this land as clans, instead of growing to eclipse all others, would shatter over access to the best fishing or farming spots. Even in face of potential conquest and annihilation at the claws of Nova Griffonian expeditions the clans didn't unify, merely reclaiming huge chunks of land where griffons had begun to settle as their masters in the west were simply unable to administer it properly and turning the would-be conquerors into nothing more than servants for ursine overlords.\n\nCurrently the land is occupied by three clans - Falsen, Benkestok and Brodkorb, all of which are merely a few decades old as they were the result of yet another cycle of a clan growing in power until it shatters. Though this time it seems it took longer for unique traditions to develop as the three clans all use griffon servants and primarily share traditions, with the exception of Falsen, whose members seem to be fascinated with sea and shipbuilding. Perhaps it's these reasons for why the leaders of these clans managed to so easily agree between themselves to forge an alleged alliance of equals, something that has never been seen before among bears. Similarly worrying are claims that this "Triple Alliance" desires to usurp power over the bears themselves."

That by itself was a worrying sign as they didn't attempt to amaze Clan Scyfling with some great show of force or brutal implications, rather throwing an indirect insult and implication that Paw Wellington never controlled Wesslandia and its lords. An attempt at insult and undermining authority far more similar to court jabs of Vedina than anything most bears would do. A worrying development, yet Paw Wellington had spent time within said noble courts and would not be undermined by a pale imitation.\n\nNonetheless negotiations took quite some time, and despite the attempt of appearing more civilized and reminiscent of more "advanced" clans in a seeming misunderstanding of Paw Wellington's intentions, the negotiations did result in a substantial amount of spilled blood and broken bones, with even Paw Wellington getting a few broken ribs. Yet a final and decisive agreement was reached. Surprisingly enough, despite the claims of grandeur and even seeming desire to rule over the entirety of ursine kind, the "Triple Alliance" didn't possess much when it came to actual ideas of what sort of domain was desired, beyond some basic concepts for an economic and agricultural policy out of all things. Perhaps they had simply not prepared to go that far. Though there was always the alternative that being besieged on several fronts which they most certainly were, prevented any solid plans to be drawn out. Whatever was the case, the three lords agreed to be integrated back into Paw Wellington's domain as long as their word on what is done with the griffon servant caste is final."

This time it was a slow and brutal grind with not enough heavy weapon support and most combat devolving into melee brawls. Whatever artillery or heavy equipment that there was in the Scyfling army, was not enough for an engagement that large as it stretched in pockets from the very sea to the mountains that designated the border between polar bears and yaks.\n\nYet victory was achieved by Paw Wellington, eventually, and not through a method which any clan would consider honourable or even remotely traditional. For it was by using weapons which were kept only for cases where extermination was the only true option - "anti-dragon rifles" of Nova Griffonian production. Only a few dozen of such weapons were available to Clan Scyfling and they were deemed to not be suitable for engaging foreign enemies due to clunkiness, slow rate of fire and even issues properly aiming such weapons. Yet against the stubbornness of traditional panserbjørn tactics? It was perfect to say the absolute least. And thus, it was deployed against a tiny part of the "Triple Alliance" frontline, obliterating several warbands. With such application of localized destruction, the Wesslandian clans were left reeling, their line shattered without any seeming potential reserves. A repeat of the last pacification followed as the lords were forced to lay down their weapons in front of Paw Wellington and admit their status as subjects. One could only hope that this time Clan Scyfling could build up proper connections, for if Wesslandia rebelled once again, there was no telling if victory would be possible."

scyfling.49.t:0 "No Peace, Nor Honour"
scyfling.49.d:0 "The "Triple Alliance" was perhaps the most numerous and some might even say powerful factions within the ursine territories. It may have even been true, if one had simply judged by numbers. Yet for all their numbers of bears and all potential forces raised from the griffon servant caste, they lacked the technological and strategic edge and were not allowed to realize that this was not a typical bear conflict of tradition, honour and melee prowess, rather it was a war of extermination. And thus, they were not and simply could not be ready for the weapons that were deployed against them. Their armour and barricades stood no chance against rifles, if weapons of such scale could even be called that, meant to slay dragons. The griffon auxiliaries, even if they had grown to be able to sustain the great colds of polar bear lands still lacked the natural cold of their masters and the feathers and furs they were clad in caught fire rather easily even when rather primitive flamethrowers were deployed against them.\n\nAfter the front was cleansed it came time for the countless fortresses and other various locations that belonged to the clans which were now left woefully lacking in any possible defences. The purges of the "Triple Alliance" forts were even more pitiful than the slaughter at the front lines and even caused some of Scyfling to question the righteousness of the cause and actions of Paw Wellington. Of course, none of them dared to disobey or challenge the Despot or his best warriors to a duel.\n\nThe final remnants of the Wesslandian clans at the fronts with Clan Scyfling and Clan Svartpels lasted the longest, yet surrounded on all sides and their homes destroyed they didn't stand a chance."

scyfling.50.t:0 "The Harmonists in the Mountains"
scyfling.50.d:0 "Clan Volsungr were often historically seen, if the stories of the oldest among the ranks of polar bears and passed down legends were to be believed, as a distant, strange and even disgraceful and dishonourable clan. This was in no small part due to the fact that the clan didn't have any tradition of armoured warriors and they seemed to have never used the traditional large axes, the weapon that any proper polar bear warrior would carry as their primary armament until the last few decades. Rather their greatest warriors were so called "Nanooks", hunters that preyed on the magical beasts that filled the mountain ranges. Furthermore, instead of dwelling within fortresses of stone and ice forged in unforgiving wastes, Volsungr would hide within the depths of the mountains as if surrendering to the elements in a manner more fitting for Diamond Dogs than any proper ursines. Yet there were two reasons for why, despite all the rumours and behaviour, nobody dared to challenge Volsungr's right to exist. Firstly, despite not using the traditional polar bear weapons, the clan possessed several entire halls of starsteel armour and weapons within their unbreakable mountain home. Secondly, Clan Volsungr had a long history of both friendship and ritualized wars with the Yak clans south of ursine lands. As Yaks were one of the few species which polar bears respected and thought as close to themselves in spirit, a friendship with their clans were a clear indication of being proper bears to many. Only the history obsessed Clan Svartpels denied such notions and waged many a war against Volsungr, though mostly without any success.\n\nThat changed during the first bear unification as an alliance of Scyfling and Svartpels brutalized the clan and some even grew to believe this would lead to its extinction. Yet it endured, by using a method which others would consider too much, accepting back countless exiles without having to withstand a trial by combat. Even their current leader, the so called "Princess" Eira, was a former exile who during her exile travelled through Equestria and copied many of their ways. This has put both her and Clan Volsungr in opposition to us politically before even if they never showed it in the open and mostly seemed to ignore us, and now they march against us in war again."

scyfling.51.t:0 "Talking it Through"
scyfling.51.d:0 "Paw Wellington has had many terrifying and horror inducing meetings through his history as an outcast and later on as a mercenary. In fact, one of the reasons of why he wanted to return so badly, beyond of course a desire to see bears prosper, was an ever-growing disillusion with the mercenary existence. Yet compared to all the meetings with the strange Vedinian cults and corrupt nobles, arrogant would-be warlords and bandits within what once they said to be was a duchy yet was now under Alexander Kemerskai and even working for the "Talons" in the griffon colonies, this was the strangest. It wasn't intimidating or conventionally scary. Rather the opposite. Instead of acting like mad beasts, trying to threaten or scare him or even openly mock him and call him nothing more than a beast, Clan Volsungr was nice. Absurdly nice even. The meeting occurred in a room within one of the fortresses of the clan. Furnished as if it was a minor palace within Equestria, Paw Wellington could only assume. The Volsungr bears apologized... Actually apologized that their "Princess" was being late. Furthermore, they had offered various refreshments and nourishment. And such atmosphere was definitely far more terrifying than any attempts at threats by weaker creatures that he had experienced. For what sort of figure was this Eira, that she whipped a clan of mountain monster hunters into such submission?\n\nEira of Clan Volsungr was a rather strange figure. She was dressed in gold and red, with a substantial amount of jewelry and embroidery. Something which any proper bear would associate with weakness. After all, gold was a metal from which no weapon could be made and most fabrics were too weak to protect a warrior from enemy blows. Yet the Princess of Clan Volsungr was most definitely not weak physically, nearly being as large as Paw Wellington himself. Furthermore while she seemed to attempt to appear nice and welcoming, there was still frost and steel behind that façade.\n\nThe negotiations themselves were similar, very fluffy and nice looking from an outsider's perspective as Paw Wellington attempted to create a similar mask. However, with how misaligned the ideologies of the clans were, especially at the current point in time, reaching a consensus was difficult. And yet an agreement was reached, even if it was overwhelmingly vague and included countless various exceptions or situational duties and obligations as both former exiles tried to outmaneuver each other and ensure the best situation no matter what happened after. One thing was sure however, even if it went the worst way after this, Clan Scyfling would still be the leader and Volsungr the subordinate."
scyfling.51.a:0 "At least there's that..."


scyfling.61.t:0 "The Mountains Turn to Dust"
scyfling.61.d:0 "During previous plans of subjugation and destruction one thing was seen as almost certain in any engagement between Clan Scyfling and would be opponents from polar bear lands. That the forces under Paw Wellington would possess either technologically superior equipment or possess them in good enough numbers. This didn't seem to be the case for Volsungr, which seemed to possess weapons similarly advanced and even something superior. Their armoured self-propelled sleds were especially powerful weapons, being impossible to penetrate with most weapons. Only concentrated artillery or heavy anti-dragon rifles could shatter the advances of these weapons. And Volsungr seemed to possess something that could match these weapons in range and power too. For the first time in almost a decade, the position of power was somewhat flipped.\n\nAnd yet despite technological superiority, most of the weapons under the possession of Volsungr were rather limited in availability. The Clan itself was also lacking in numbers compared to the forces amassed by Paw Wellington at this point. And thus, even if it was slow and many of the more advanced and exotic contraptions had to be taken down with numbers, Volsungr was pushed into a defensive position.\n\nEventually any and all fortresses and outposts outside of the main Volsungr hold were broken and shattered, the offensive weapons becoming more of a liability than an advantage. Of course, storming the mountains themselves and trying to engage the Volsungr within the caves and underground in which they thrived would have been suicidal. Yet, while the fortress itself was impossible to take for any force that wasn't absolutely overwhelming, in this case it didn't matter if the fortress was actually taken. It only mattered that Volsungr would fall. And thus any and all entrances were bombed until they collapsed inward. The Clan would perish in the holes they dug out themselves."
scyfling.61.a:0 "No way in, no way out."

scyfling.62.t:0 "The Lords of Thunder"
scyfling.62.d:0 "Clan Svartpels, the "Lords of Thunder" as they were known sometimes by fearful enemies, was a rather unique contradiction, at least if one tried to perceive them through a griffon and perhaps pony lens. For it was one of the most intellectual and scientifically aligned clans, at least before the Volsungr started welcoming outcasts back en masse, yet also one of the most warlike and reactionary when it came to advancements. The ritual of induction into the ranks of its panserbjørn and leadership was the most brutal, as it included not just slaying beasts or winning a trial by combat, but as a proof of strength one was supposed to be struck by lightning and endure. Yet simultaneously, the same induction ceremony questioned the would-be warriors' or leaders' knowledge of bear history, tradition and what amounted to traditional sciences and crafts. Clan Svartpels was also heavily opposed to many ideas on change and advancement suggested by the younger generations, being the main source of bears cast out of the frozen north, yet when the proposer of such changes had proven their worth in combat, they would willingly and happily follow the changes. Such was the case when Paw Wellington managed to earn their friendship through a duel by defeating their leader, the great Thunder Lord Torben. After this Clan Svartpels assisted us in the unification of polar bear lands. Their support continued even through our most controversial and in retrospective absurd decisions. And yet now they stand against us.\n\nYet it's not for reasons one would think. For Clan Svartpels and Torben turned against us not because they believe that we have broken our duties or committed some great sin. It seems that for one reason or the other, Torben and his entire clan believes that these actions were not of Paw Wellington and his clan, rather it's either a changeling conspiracy of spreading lies or misinformation and shattering bear unity and causing conflict. In fact, they are so adamant in this belief that any bear that even wishes to approach a member of the clan is forced to engage in a duel as it's widely believed that even if Changelings are able to masquerade as something comparing to our size, such form is not possible to maintain in combat."
scyfling.62.a:0 "That might be quite an issue."


scyfling.68.t:0 "Battle of Ice"
scyfling.68.d:0 "Despite all the conflict and war that it took to get to this point, the engagements with Clan Svartpels were perhaps the most worrying of campaigns that Paw Wellington had to plan for. After all it was the only clan which wasn't subjugated through war. Rather, their allegiance in the bear unification wars were changed through but half a dozen duels as Paw Wellington fought and defeated Torben and the best panserbjørn of the clan. Yet such a strategy wouldn't be acceptable now. After all, anything that wasn't a traditional battle could easily be perceived as trickery or actions of a collaborator. And thus, Scyfling would have to fight far more skilled and physically capable Svartpels warriors with nothing more than mere axes.\n\nThe Scyfling warbands easily outnumbered their Svartpels counterparts, however as the battle continued unfolding, it was very clear that numbers didn't matter in a battle like this. Only when Paw Wellington and Torben met in the middle of the great engagement and the Thunder Lord was defeated by the Despot did the battle turn to the side of Scyfling, and it was less an actual turn and more Torben rising to his feet with a great jolly laugh and screaming out the words of surrender as the entirety of the engagement and this duel was apparently good enough.\n\nThe battle was followed by a great feast as the ties of friendship and allegiance were reforged through exchange of foods and alcohol. Torben was of course overjoyed that Clan Scyfling and Paw Wellington had survived what he claimed must have been a changeling infiltration and spread of lies about the idea that Paw Wellington had accepted back the Mechanites and perhaps even worse scum. And that of course, with the two clans together again, something like this would not happen ever again."

scyfling.73.t:0 "Thunder Will Never Be Heard Again"
scyfling.73.d:0 "This was perhaps the hardest of things that Paw Wellington had done before. Maybe not in a literal sense, as while Clan Svartpels were indeed fearsome opponents, with our mind sets to destruction this war was not contested or ever even seemed to be turning towards the Lords of Thunder. What was hard for many, including bears, was having to destroy your friends and longtime allies due to conflict over your own actions. Actions that you couldn't take back and actions that they simply wouldn't accept. Yet it had to be done for a greater future, for a greater chance of polar bear survival as a state. And thus even if it was painful, it had to be done. So Scyfling deployed against Svartpels in full force.\n\nScyfling had technological, numerical and strategic superiority, but this didn't mean that the Lords of Thunder went down quietly. They fought and bled and perished, yet crushed many a warband, often in spite of ranged weaponry which would have crushed any other force. And yet despite such victories, they couldn't replace their losses, for there were so few true Svartpels yet there were many bears under Paw Wellington. And eventually, despite how much they raged and fought, their fortresses were crushed, their warriors and elders hunted down and whoever remained was pushed into the sea."

In the face of the arctic cold, everything else made sense. Why they had never built a great empire like the griffons, why they had prized strength and clan above all: the frigid wind howling across their homeland answered.\n\nAnd so it was that [PLB.GetLeader] came to understand. He understood now why his bears, finally united under a single Overtyrant, had regressed back to the state they had been in when he first arrived. All his work, undone in a few months of bloodshed which had forced the remaining bears to devote all their energies to basic survival.\n\n[PLB.GetLeader] started sending out new orders to take stock of what was left, to start rebuilding. But there was little heart to it. He had failed when he had all the clans behind him; he had little hope left that he would succeed now, alone."

He could only be angry at himself, for thinking that the other clans would be cowed, or that he could wipe them out without losing the very minds he needed to build a new future.

For no other leader had unified the state and race under their own control like Grover I. Yet the bears were not a race so easily subdued and [PLB.GetLeader] was forced to endlessly battle them for control, if not literally, then in the fields of politics and even economics.\n\nYet now, as holds lay destroyed, armies butchered and noble and great leaders sent to rest beneath the snows and ice... As he discarded his foreign name and took his old one in shame. As he buried his hopes and dreams... Now they came to him, those that remained, those that dared to question him before, those without clans that scoffed at his dreams. Now they all came to him. For trade routes had dried out. For mines were collapsed. For root farms laid abandoned. And they couldn't survive by themselves now, too dependent on the peace he had brought merely years before. They needed him! They needed a tyrant that could control all to save them! And with bitterness [PLB.GetLeader] began to guide the realm of polar bears again, this time without opposition, without question.

Assistance with rebuilding from an apparent disaster for so called lands of Geirfuglvidda and the islands of Jan Mayen. Usually such a proposal would be strange or perhaps even absurd. For if we wanted said land we could simply take it, if our neighbour is truly so weakened. However, bears and us were not historically much opposed, at least from their perspective and waging a war against bears is neither an easy, nor an amusing affair. Furthermore, said land has penguins, and substantial numbers of them, within it. Even if they were integrated into the strange bear ways as the majority of so called "Clan Anker", they are still penguins and feel a kinship with us. And as various figures within our lands have expressed, our populace certainly feels a kinship with them.

However, for now they seem to be unwilling to cause a conflict by themselves.

It was all Paw could spit out upon seeing rows of bare-naked soldiers standing at Key Lake's edge, wearing no armour.\n\nBut Rúngils, the Mechanite drill-sergeant, hurled a broken spear at a recruit, only for it to bounce off their metal skin with an audible clink. "Yet it works. Thanks to some 'borrowed' medical equipment from the changelings, we can easily replicate this feat for your troops! Send them to our clinics! A few days under the knife, and their bones will be made of crystal; instead of skin and fur, their flesh will be steel!"\n\nThose words echoed in Paw's head as he saw the so-called "cy-bears"—wearing these "cybearnetics," as Rúngils called it—spar with one another, and Paw could not help but drop his jaw a little when he saw lasers—powered by crystals embedded in their skin—pop out, deflecting off their heads like nothing. The few that wore glasses—Paw swore he saw crystal emit text and diagrams into their eyes.\n\nBy sunset, Wellington found himself shaking the Rúngils's paw, then retired to the town's central hold which had the Mechanite touch of yet more steel holding up snow and ice. It gave him a breathtaking vista of the lake and the magic foundries of the Soryth changelings just across, piercing the burning dusk.\n\nBefore he slept, an aide asked him what he thought of Mechanites' "strange and unusual crafts.

Not the old ones Kemerskai and the other northern griffons scrounged up; these were top of the line, reverse-engineered from the changelings' own. And each soldier had top-of-the-line kits and equipment, too: grenades, magical dressings and first aid kits, and crew-served weaponry such as grenade launchers and sniper rifles. He saw his greenest recruits barely hiding their fanged smiles, beholding their newfound power at the tiny push of a trigger.\n\nAt the end of the day, the Mechanites gifted him a custom-made rifle and pistol.

Why precisely in this world of great beasts and sapient monsters, were the comparatively puny griffons, ponies, changelings and even zebras such dominant breeds. They were small and weak and frail. Their numbers alone could not compensate for this. Even their magics, beyond select unicorns or zebra alchemists was pathetic in comparison to the reshaping of entire regions that all the prodigiously sized races could do.\n\nYet as he wandered and fought and gathered power and knowledge, Paw found the answer. It was in the great divine or pseudo-divine rulers that these weak races found their strength. It was almost always these great leaders of absurd size and strength that would unite these realms and expand them into Empires like none had ever seen before. Celestia and Grover among them have grown most infamous for entire continents were defined by their power and importantly, great longevity and legacy. Dragons, bears, yaks... None of them truly had such. Perhaps Lord Torch could compare, but among elders of his breed he seemed to be more of a nuisance then some supreme eternal lord.\n\nAnd that perhaps was the answer. Paw had already united the bears, not once, but twice and stood at the precipice of great things as All-Father's champion. Perhaps for true greatness of bears he needed to go beyond..."

Three dozen circuits, three supreme courts (which could co-operate with each other), to be checked by the king himself. Through ritual battles and legal debate.\n\nHalfway through, that fear had been replaced by a massive migraine. If she help the fledgling bears get a hoofing on the international stage, that would be great. But it was a mess."

scyflingb.12.d:0 "Even if some feared that due to their despot pronouncing himself King in what was clearly a tradition inspired by griffons, the crowning ceremony would be pompous and unfitting. Yet they were wrong. It was not in some cushy room that the first King of Winter was crowned.\n\nBeneath the raging skies was the ceremony organized as great blizzards tore at frozen mountains. The bears that gathered, leaders of clans and their great elders, greatest of warlords of fortresses without clans, even some of the great eternal figures of bear society, were all clad not in great clothes, but in great armours of enchanted steel and metals stronger. And it was not some priest or some other figure that was waiting with a crown to pronounce the despot as a true king. Rather the towering armoured figure that stood beneath the assembled lords of the ursinekind unveiled the crown himself. One he forged from steel, with motifs of great beasts and visages of war on the great iron circlet. Said circlet was surrounded by 10 blades, each of which could serve as a proper sword for a pony or a griffon.\n\nAnd beneath the gaze of the statue of the All-Father, King Joris of Winter crowned himself with the iron crown, taking up a new name. And the great warriors and warlords and beasts all cried out."

scyflingb.13.t:0 "On the Gold Standard"
scyflingb.13.d:0 ""Gold was used for currency worldwide. Due to its rarity, it's perceived inability to corrode, sometimes due to ability to transfer energies or even due to reactivity to certain magical abilities or items it had gained a reputation for being rare and valuable. A perception of value which grew beyond its value in production and spellmaking.\n\nHowever bears do not value gold. For them it was a weak and meek metal, impossible to turn into any armour or weapons, at most being used for powered thunder armor, yet even then merely to conduct magical currents. Thus when King Joris announced that a golden currency would be issued to replace systems of barter or extremely rare starsteel coinage in hopes for assisting in modernization, some reacted with anger and disbelief that their monarch would make such demeaning choice and challenged his decision. This started a great conflict between those ursines that supported the change of coinage and those that opposed it.\n\nHowever, after several thousand duels and allegedly up to ten thousand dead it was finally agreed that indeed, the change to gold was necessary."- Excerpt from "Equestrian in the Land of Always Winter""

Merely a personal and mostly civil meeting of two returned exiles, inspired by great leaders of other realms.\n\nThe agreement of Volsungr sending their warriors, elders and scribes to the court of the Winter King was easy. What was harder on the side of Joris, was to convince the princess that he was no enemy, for the leader of Volsungr had seemingly picked up a nasty southern habit of not rolling with her defeats.\n\nAnd thus they talked, through day and night about politics, philosophy, rises and failures of Kings and Queens and Emperors and Kaisers across Griffonia and Equus.\n\nAnd in the spar of words that most elders would claim un-ursine, the ideas of harmony, friendship and environmentalism clashed with goals of modernism, statist stability and Groverite imperialism. Yet both King and Princess agreed, that stability and survival of bear state was integral above all else. And upon this they built an agreement, one that would not be known to those that would not tolerate half measures, but one that suited them both.\n\nAnd by blood and steel they swore to respect it..."

scyflingb.15.d:0 "A great march of warriors entered the capital. Each clad in full thunder plate, yet still numbering in the thousands, a great luxury that was only possible by the long history of great victories of the Great Clan Svartpels. The procession was led by a towering behemoth covered in shining steel that hid underneath a flesh burned by lightning – Lord of Lightning Torben.\n\nFor the first time in allegedly thousands of years did the armies of Svartpels march into the capital of Clan Scyfling. Yet this was done not as enemies or conquerors. Rather as the Lord of Thunder met the Despot of All Bears in the great plaza at the core of the fortress city, they embraced each in a half-wrestle of a hug with a force enough to crush a tankette. The touching gesture of brotherhood could be heard across the entire city on the account that both ursines were clad in enough armour to put many a tank to shame. With the greeting gaining approval of the elders gathered the two ursines broke contact and the warrior-scribes of Svartpels were directed to a new fortress within the city constructed just for them.\n\nAnd thus many of Clan Svartpels elders settled in the Fortress-City of Mathair Fearainn. For their lord above lords had invited them there, to help with the governing of the great realm and maintaining traditions and proper ursine culture, even as the realm marched forwards."

scyflingb.16.t:0 "The Many Faiths"
scyflingb.16.d:0 "While Joris himself held his faith for All-Father in a manner more similar to griffon devotion to Boreas, most polar bears worshipped differently from him and most other races. For they did not revere and prostrate themselves before some abstract divinity that dwelled high in the heavens, they merely respected these mystical figures. Furthermore most of their figures were real, at least in bear historiography, great creatures that crossed the veil into the eternal world of spirits. Perhaps these myriad cults respecting different creatures could be compared to the pony respect towards the Alicorns, yet even then, no single deity or figure was revered by all and those few that were universal, like All-Father, often took a secondary or even tertiary role in the custom pantheons of every clan or even warband. Furthermore there was no universal way of showing respect for these figures.\n\nAnd that had to change.\n\nFor the Kingdom of Winter was a realm that promised to respect the cultures of clans and warbands, many of which endured for centuries or more, stifling any idea of universal ursine nationalism. Yet a modern realm requires some unity based on something greater than mere reverence for a leader. And thus King Joris made another choice..."
scyflingb.16.a:0 "They shall be united by faith."

scyflingb.17.t:0 "The Decentralized Tradition"
scyflingb.17.d:0 "Joris roared as the last of the challengers fell upon the unbreakable permafrost. Few shamans challenged him when he made his choice, yet there were still brave or stupid ones that believed that his choice.\n\nIt seemed against his own better judgement to leave so much autonomy and so much freedom in how bear ways of faith could grow and develop, yet perhaps it was for the best. But he had decided that all ursines could revere whatever mythical figure they wanted. And there were many... Fenrir the Direwolf, Gallinbursti the Industrious Boar, The Great Raven were the most notable and important in myth, yet if one gazed across clans and warbands they would find countless others: The Rage-filled Mountain, The Great Serpent, The First Owlbear, The Eternal, Gnoph-Keh, Tyrant of the Frozen Shore, Mechas - Lord of Machines, Za'al... The names could stretch for books and perhaps would still not mention all figures that were respected by one warband or the other.\n\nHowever after his somewhat bloodless reform and only a few dead religious figures, a shift was happening. For now shamans were spreading an aspect of faith that had not existed before - the central and absolute position of All-Father as a figure that all bears must revere and respect to some degree.\n\nAnd hopefully such universal divinity would ensure a sense of unity endures even after Joris passes on..."

scyflingb.18.t:0 "The New Faith"
scyflingb.18.d:0 "The shamans and truly faithful and reverent bears did not take it lightly, they did not take it easily. And thus for days upon days did the battles commence. And for days upon days did Joris and his champions duel and break those that dared to disagree into submission and often death.\n\nFor Joris had chosen the hard path, he had chosen the true path and he had chosen the path that would unite the ursines for millenia and perhaps millions of years to come. For had Grover the First and his successors not crushed local variations of faiths to forge unity among all griffons? And had Celestia not subverted every other faith until it only revered her? Clearly a singular, united faith was what let these realms to march into greatness as unity was forged around the core of singular worship! And thus he forged his own. With All-Father as supreme deity to be revered and worshipped as the one that allowed polar bears to seek greatness and the Three Great Beasts: Fenrir the Direwolf, Gallinbursti the Industrious Boar, The Great Raven beneath, as his followers, ones that gave bears the tools to rise above all other monsters and wild things. Other minor figures were allowed to be revered somewhat still, just never on the level of these four. And this infuriated many a ursine.\n\nYet for all their yappering and all their madness, the traditionalists gave up. For no matter what champions they brought and how furious they were, the will of the King was absolute. And thus they gave up."

scyflingb.19.t:0 "An Archon of Ursines"
scyflingb.19.d:0 "The new Winter pantheon had been established. Various new traditions of the faithful were forged and religious rites were gathered and enforced. However no true religious institution could stand without a leader at it's top, the strong figure that could guide the faithful through all times to come. And while Joris desired to crown himself as not only King of Winter, but also the Øverst-Gudija, supreme religious representative, of All-Father and all gods, he was discouraged by his friends and advisers, for such an action would perhaps yet again be seen as an attempt to solidify his absolute power. And perhaps, as Ulrik warned him, may spark a Third War of Unification. And thus with bitterness the King looked for another candidate.\n\nAditi was a wondering Shaman, a self-proclaimed prophet that claimed to be able to gaze into the depths of polar storms and see outcomes of any conflict. Furthermore she was a devour worshipper of All-Father, not in mere respect towards the mythological granter of wisdom, but fervent belief that it was the divinity that gave her the visions of victories or defeats. The shebear did not oppose the march of Scyfling towards bear unification during either the first or second Unification War, though she didn't support it either. In general the seer was a sort of enigma, for despite widespread respect she did not seek power, merely offering prophecies concerning war for those willing to pay.\n\nAnd yet strangely, when Joris offered the position of Øverst-Gudija, Aditi took it with very little opposition. And thus the first Øverst-Gudija was crowned with a crown of antlers beneath a great statue of the All-Father. And one hundred thousand bears roared in approval!"

This was while the polar bear embassy just outside Canterlot was under construction. As Flutters told me, she felt scared by the sight of a terrifying ice castle being built by creatures who looked more brutal than Olenia's ancient vikings. But we noticed her fear. And honestly? I was scared, too. We all were.\n\nBut we knew the bears hadn't come to fight us. After suffering millennia of strife, they reached out to us in a gesture of friendship. So we put aside our fears, and travelled to the embassy together. And what do you know? The bears were much nicer than we thought! Their king (in Fluttershy's words, Jorik may look rough, but he's sweet once you get to know him) welcomed us into his ice castle where we had a fruitful discussion on exchange students as well as trade issues before settling down for some homemade bear cuisine, which was surprisingly omnivorous. At the end of the day, they'd wish to see us once again, especially King Jorik and Princess Eira; Pinkie's already making plans for a Hearth's Warming party soon! (The bears also really liked the Apple family apples!)\n\nIf there's one thing to take away from this, it's that, in the tumultuous order of a new millennium, it is still a blessing to see friendship everywhere, even where we least expect it."

But the sight of enough armour to shame a battalion of tanks, a hundred axes the size of three ponies, all while bleeding snow out of the soil... it scared the living daylights out of her.\n\nBut the freezing embassy soon was soon built, and the Equestrian delegation met with their bear counterparts. Their leader, King Jorik, towered over them, casting a shadow augmented by several layers of enchanted steel and iron, blessed by a bladed crown of etched monsters, backed up by murderous claws and teeth.\n\nYet the king's overbearing paw reached out to her hoof, asking for a shake. Hiding a nervous gulp, Gustysnows shook it, and once inside the building, she marvelled at the arctic caverns hosting pony soldiers sparring with whelps, flanked by ice statues of Jorik and various depictions of their deity, "All Father". She soon found herself chatting with the real Jorik and his princess/love interest Eira, negotiations giving way to talk about Equestrian fruits and musicals. Though the bears were gruff, they still verbalised hope for a future forged by both bears and ponies. In the end, it was just enough to leave Gustysnows with a warm smile..."

Torben picked up one of the great volumes and gently opened it up near the middle. The page depicted iconography of a clan that Joris had never seen before, surrounded by variations and explanations. The other was taken up by a long list of "succession" of leaders with dates of who and when won the right to rule. Somewhere around the middle the leadership transfers to Clan Kane and then near the end, to him as "Joris of Winter".\n\n"I do not understand or care much for the obsession that so many other races have with succession and specific inheritance of titles." The Lord of Thunder closes the tome. "But I know the rules. And in these tomes, I gathered the histories and symbols of every lost clan and ancient despot who ever ruled anything, what lands they occupied, who seized said territories and transference of legitimacy. All until we get to you."\n\n"Even Tyrant on the Frozen Shore and the Despot of Bugbears?" Joris quipped. The Lord of Thunder rumbled like a mountain in response, his laughter deep and growling.\n\n"I respect your prowess, my friend, but I doubt even you could sail the Frozen Sea and take Vedina, even if I carved a way through twenty thousand years of lost history to give you the claim.""

Now of course such a statement would technically be true, yet it would be an understatement of the century. For the... griffon? that came from the bear side to bargain was a monster. While great size of Grover II was lauded in tales as some great blessing of the divine, this creature seemed oversized and perhaps even grotesque as it towered over the Nova Griffonian emissaries clad in armour of steel and furs of what were unmistakeably slain bears.\n\nAnd yet this creature came demanding that many of the lands of Nova Griffonia are to be given up and granted to the "Kingdom of Winter". The justification was strange, yet simple. These lands belonged to bear clans long ago and still have quite a few bears living in them, thus the Lord of all Ursines demanded that they are "given back" with an official proclamation and all Nova Griffonian forces are withdrawn. If not, then vengeance through iron and blood was promised."

An all-out war again?" Ulrik let out in disbelief as if such an idea was incomprehensible. A remnant of griffon upbringing perhaps. For bears such a war would certainly be imaginable.\n\n"Any true ursine warrior would have expected that when entire clans rise up, be it in defiance of demands or fears of bug subversion, then battles would happen." The voice like rough sandpaper sounded from a bear stripped of fur, his snout covered in burn scars – Torben. "Yet they were talked down or taken in singular duels. Perhaps such a shift shows, that it's time for bears to change again, just as we went from roaming armies to settled holds."\n\n"And change into what precisely?" Ulrik scoffs as if offended personally. "This is a culture of a million years!"\n\n"Into whatever Paw decides.

I didn't think you would actually seek to fulfil the promises, to build a state where everyone's interests would be cared for..." Eira seemed to be lost in thought.\n\n"I am no oath breaker...

Rather, the interests of the clans would be defended by their clan leaders or elders. Furthermore, the clans will be permitted to be almost fully self-ruling, with exception of providing soldiers for a united army.\n\nDespite theoretical representation for all clans, most of power is kept in the claws of the three great clans, until the benefits of the system and modernization are seen by all bears."

I've never had a fish this fresh and savory before in my life! Could I trouble you for a second helping?"\n\nPaw turned to his attendant, but paused when he saw the bear's frown. "Is something wrong?"\n"No sir, it's nothing. I wouldn't want to insult our guest."\n"Oh, balderdash!" Wetbeak scoffed, "Don't hesitate to speak on my account."\n\nThe attendant's frown deepened. "The strong conquer the weak, that's how it should be. Why do the griffons, who have so much more wealth and technology than us, treat us as friends instead of prey? It defies the natural order of things."\n\nPaw gave the bear a stern look. "The strong shall conquer the weak, that is true. But when the weak band together as one, they can overpower the strong. Nova Griffonia is more powerful than us, but they are weak compared to the great empires of the world. The griffons are wise enough to realize that we will be stronger if we stand together. Trying to dominate us would only waste the strength of both our peoples."\n\nThe attendant nodded, seemingly understanding Paw's logic.

The mission he'd sent to investigate Nova Griffonia had finally returned.

He should've seen this coming, he knew that Griffonia's tyrants always managed to triumph over honest leaders. Just like in ages past, griffon knights would soon be marching into the bear lands. Yet this time it was his responsibility to stop them.\n\nHis confederation, the nation he'd spent so long building, was now the last true republic on Equus.

The ponies are kind and noble creatures who will become powerful allies if we earn their friendship."\n\n"I agree that we must intervene," interjected Torben of Clan Svartpels, "but for a different reason. This is a perfect opportunity to defeat the changelings, our ancient enemies. While they are distracted by the weak ponies, we can strike them with our combined might.

scyflingb.38.d:0 "Today a large horde of polar bears arrived in [FAT.Capital.GetName]. After a brief panic, we managed to identify the bears' leaders and asked them what they are doing here. To our surprise, they announced that they have come to fight for us!\n\nWe have relied on foreign volunteers since the revolution began, but many griffons were hesitant to accept these ursines. Very few of them have conventional combat experience, and even fewer speak Herzlander. Their ideas of proper military etiquette and discipline are also very different from our own.\n\nHowever, attitudes quickly shifted when the ursines were invited to our military exercises. Polar bears are ferocious and powerful creatures, and the strongest among them were able to hold their own against griffon knights. Since their strength is extraordinary and they are clearly passionate about our cause, we ultimately decided to induct them into our armed forces."

scyflingb.39.t:0 "Polar Forges"
scyflingb.39.d:0 "Although we have worked to expand our industrial capacity, we still have a long way to go. Our enemies have a lot of factories, and for the time being we cannot hope to match their industrial strength.\n\nNow help has come from an unlikely source. [PLB.GetLeader], leader of the Polar Bear Confederation, is working with us to bridge the gap. He has offered to put some of his country's forges at our disposal to increase our production capabilities.\n\nAdmittedly the number of forges the ursines can spare is quite small. However, given that their industrial base is weak and underdeveloped, the offer is quite generous. The polar bears may live in a land of ice and snow, but the Republican dream burns brightly in their hearts."
scyflingb.39.a:0 "Send the bears our thanks!"

scyflingb.40.t:0 "A Polar Alliance?"
scyflingb.40.d:0 "We have received an envoy from [PLB.GetLeader], leader of the polar bears. He says that bears and yaks have a lot in common and would benefit from working together. To make this happen, he is asking us to sign a treaty of non-aggression and mutual defense.\n\nStanding alone without any help from outsiders is an integral part of yak culture. If we want to stick to these principles, we should refuse the bears' offer. However, the polar bears hold values similar to our own, so we may be able to reach an understanding. They are also big and powerful creatures, much stronger than ponies or griffons. Many yaks respect their strength, and we could use their help if our nation is ever threatened."

Polar bears and yaks have always been the north's largest and strongest creatures, but our lack of technology and industry has held us back. Now that we have set aside our differences, our neighbors will think twice before invading the frozen north."

scyflingb.411.t:0 "No Alliance with [FROM.GetNameDef]"
scyflingb.411.d:0 "The yaks have declined our proposal for a mutual defense pact. This outcome was not unexpected, as they value self-sufficiency and are deeply suspicious of outsiders.

Among the ferocious and often hostile polar bear clans, Eira has always supported harmony and closer ties with us. Now, on behalf of her new husband King Joris, she is asking us to sign a Treaty of Perpetual Peace and Friendship between ponies and polar bears.\n\nTo many this choice seems obvious. It is, after all, an incredible opportunity to promote peace and harmony while making new friends. However, there are a few ponies who still fear the polar bears and question if King Joris is sincere."

His eyes widened as a huge, lumbering polar bear entered the room. The stranger sported impressive facial hair and what looked like an admiral's uniform.\n\n"Greetings President-Marshal," the ursine said in heavily accented Herzlander, "I am Paw Wellington, leader of the Polar Bear Confederation."\n"Hello..." Kemerskai said, not sure what to make of the visitor. "What brings you to the Griffonian Republic?"\n"I have come to meet with you, sir." Paw replied, trying to hide his excitement.\n"Meet with me? Why?"\n\nPaw took a deep breath. "I lived on this continent for many years, and in that time I heard tales of Kemerskai the liberator. Many creatures know about your ceaseless struggle for the republic, know how you never give up despite countless setbacks. These stories helped me to overcome my own leadership struggles, and your republican principles helped inspire the confederal system we polar bears now use. I have come to thank you and to establish diplomatic relations between our peoples."\n\n"Very... interesting." Kemerskai muttered, still trying to understand the bear's accent. "I'm flattered. Thank you for coming, I wish you and all your people the very best."\n\nPaw smiled, no longer able to contain his enthusiasm. "Thank you sir, the same to you!""

"I vow to be your partner in all things, to encourage and inspire you, and to love you with all of my heart for as long as I live."\n\nThe crowd erupted into cheers and applause as the two leaders exchanged rings and sealed their union with a kiss. As they turned to face the congregation, Joris took Eira's paw and raised it high.\n\n"Bears and ponies, may I present to you Princess Eira, our new queen!"\n\nThe crowd cheered once more, and Eira blushed with delight. "And may I present to you King Joris, my partner in life and our proud leader!" She retorted happily, and they both smiled in unison.\n\nAfter the ceremony, the newlyweds led a procession of guests to the reception hall, where a feast of polar bear steaks and Equestrian apple pies awaited them. As they sat at the head table, surrounded by their closest friends and family, Eira and Joris toasted to their future and the future of their nations.\n\n"I couldn't be happier to be marrying you, my love," Eira said, raising her glass.\n\n"Nor I, my dear," Joris replied, clinking his glass against hers."

scyflingb.46.d:0 "We have received a proposal from Paw Wellington, President of [PLB.GetNameDef]. He claims that penguins and polar bears, two species which have shared the arctic for centuries, both possess "polar spirits." Since we are "natural brothers," he argues that we are destined to stand together, flipper in paw, as one united confederal nation.\n\nDespite Wellington's obvious enthusiasm, his claims are a little far-fetched. Polar bears are ferocious creatures much bigger than us, and some find it hard to believe they are acting in good faith. However, a confederation with the ursines would bring us undeniable economic and military benefits. Given how weak we both are compared to our larger neighbors, uniting with the bears may be the only way to ensure our survival."

scyflingb.49.d:0 "High up, the only speck in the glacial skies was Ulrik's plane, winds lapping against metal wings, frost threatening to build.\n\nHe'd fought with Paw by his side, but the bear couldn't fit in a Griffonian plane even if he were to care for flying. When other mercs caught the airplane bug, Ulrik signed up quick: griffons were meant to fight in their element, in the deep blue above. Terrain dissolved up there; so high up, though they guns and engines roared, fighting another pilot felt like a heavenly joust between two holy knights.\n\nBut the northern confines of Griffonia couldn't match polar ice, with snow striking out at him—even if he could eject out of a failed plane, it was a risk to bail out into a mountain of ice.\n\nHe banished the thought as he landed on some thin self-made airstirp. Wheels and attached skis bumped against ice, and indicators used to Griffonia's warmer climate flashed red, but he worried not. They were not the problem: bears still couldn't fit into today's planes, and while griffons could, only owlbears had the citizenship rights to be part of the air force, and these super-birds were in short supply.\n\nBut Ulrik smiled as he hopped out. Challenges were meant to be overcome."

And the spirits had an incomparable shortlist of candidates:\n\nPaw was the bear behind the republican ideal. Having fought in the battlefields where the original Republic waged a struggle for the democracy and rights of all griffonkind, Paw was the logical choice for championing the republic's values and giving every bear a powerful voice towards the north's vitalisation.\n\nTorben, the Lord of Thunder himself, participated in the first unification of the polar bear lands with Paw, but the similarities ended there. Torben had upheld a democracy that would not forget its roots and the consequences of republican principles: if they were universally good, why keep them to the bears? They could be spread to the farthest corners of the world, so tyrants everywhere would tremble at a worldwide revolution of the common bear.\n\nAnd there was the Shaman King of Rozenkrantz, running on a mix of future-based conservatism, calling the bears to return to their mystic traditions so they could gain invaluable foresight in governing themselves. Some have jeered about why he would run if he, a shaman, definitely knew he would win, but for him, regardless of the result, he had already made his impact, as scores of bears expressed interest in the ways of Rozenkrantz.\n\nSo when the verbal and physical sparring settled and all the ballots were counted, the ether spoke: the bears would be led by..."
scyflingb.50.d_eternal:0 "In strongholds everywhere, ballots flew in the thousands: the winter's spirits have urged all to come hither to root the ether in the mortal realm through an elected leader!\n\nAmong the four, two were the usual candidates: Paw Wellington had run on a platform of republican ideals quite similar to Kemerskai's Three Principles of Liberty, Democracy, and Prosperity, advocating a great unity and participation of polar bears and other polar souls, whereas Torben had platformed loudly on a more proactive stance on republicanism, preaching an aggressive approach to the outside world, that they submit to the forces of freedom... or else.\n\nThe other two candidates were a stranger pair: The Shaman King reeled in promises of a state led by yet-to-be-known knowledge; why commit guesswork on a national scale when one could just see the future and act on that? But more alien than him ran The Eternal, an enigmatic six-limbed monstrosity from the primordial depths of pre-time. He gathered a substantial base of supporters for himself thanks to his message of "bolster defence, begin the operations"—or so his military officials interpreted.\n\nWith such an eccentric and diverse mix in the race, debates had been lively, urging everyone to do their due diligence in discerning what these candidates had to say. But when the vote-counting finished and everything was tallied up, the republic's first truly elected president was announced..."

svartpels.1.t:0 "The Only Explanation"
svartpels.1.d:0 "Torben, the Thunder Lord of Clan Svartpels paced back and forth in his chambers deep within a fortress of the farthest north, the howling of the icy winds outside echoing even there. It was all so confusing to him, everything that had happened. His friend, Paw Wellington could never have ordered something like it, that was for sure. Torben had known him for years now, fought by his side through everything, supported him on all his ideas thus far. But this act was so outrageous, so destructive that it was uncharacteristic even for the Despot. This could only have been the work of the eternal enemy of all bears, the changelings.\n\nIt all made sense. With all the strength and fortitude bears possessed, their western neighbors were scared, fearful for themselves, and so they sought to turn us amongst ourselves. They wanted to make us weak so they could strike when we least expected it. Well Torben, had seen through their lies, and both him and Clan Svartpels would not fall so easily to their influence. They would bring honor, tradition and the true way of bears back to the land, to save them all.\n\nOf course this would be a difficult task. Clan Svartpels, despite having some of the strongest warriors of all clans, were low on numbers due to the first unification wars taking its toll. But even if the task would be arduous, he would see it through. If not for the clan, then at least for his fallen friend, in the name of all they had worked for so long ago."
svartpels.1.a:0 "We will rescue bearkind from itself!"

svartpels.4.t:0 "A Visit to the Island"
svartpels.4.d:0 "With treason and deception afoot in the north, it is essential that before we can strike out against the other clans, we ensure that none of us can deceive and cause our downfall from within. Though they have been our vassal for much of Svartpels' recorded history, Clan Anker, located on the island in the middle of the bay had recently been rather distant, something that Thunder Lord Torben had taken suspiciously. To ensure the loyalty of the only major port we have, he had taken to visiting it personally and ensuring that no conspiracy had taken hold.\n\nThe journey was long and difficult, requiring trekking across the windy forests, walking on the frozen ice, and rowing through the freezing waters. Once Torben and his panserbjørn had arrived, they met a deserted dock, the remnants of the "navy" alone and unkept. This only grew the Thunder Lord's suspicions, and they slowly made their way towards the fortresses inland. When they had almost arrived at one of them, Torben was approached by a single bear, who he recognized as an elder of Clan Anker, and was immediately challenged to a duel.\n\nTorben, of course, immediately accepted. The battle was fierce but short, as the elder stood no chance against the strongest of Svartpels' warriors. But when they slowly got back up, bleeding and with quite a few shattered bones, they only nodded and screamed out into the winter snow that the Thunder Lord had truly returned. The rest of Clan Anker showed themselves almost immediately, and the elder explained that they had to ensure that Torben and his entourage were not really changelings, and that the lack of communication was them waiting for the real Torben to arrive. Torben was greatly amused and relieved that their closest vassal had remained true to the bear ways, and later that day they had a great feast to celebrate their continued bonds of master and subject."
svartpels.4.a:0 "We always knew we could trust in Clan Anker."

svartpels.5.t:0 "The Wesslandian Question"
svartpels.5.d:0 "Wesslandia is a strange land among the bears, a place where despite all the natural resources were given to the local clans, no lord or tyrant grew to rule the region and the bears in it. No, instead they have been stuck in a perpetual cycle of clans shattering and forming, always fighting for the best locations for fish or farming. The only thing these clans have had in common over the years is the use of a griffon servant caste, remnants from the avians to our east.\n\nBut now, it seems that things have changed. For because of the very culture and history that each of the three current Wesslandian clans of Falsen, Benkestok and Brodkorb lack, they have been able to create what is being called the "Triple Alliance", a united front against other clan leaders. They also seem to have new ambitions, as some say they desire to rule all bears much like our old friend Paw Wellington once did. While this clear break of bear tradition may just be the product of Paw's old ideas solidifying in other clans, something much more sinister may be at work. For if the changelings are behind this, then these clans must be destroyed before their influence can seep deeper into bear society..."
svartpels.5.a:0 "Their defiance will not be tolerated!"


svartpels.12.t:0 "Thunder and Lightning"
svartpels.12.d:0 "During the last war of unification, Clan Svartpels played a critical role in aiding Paw Wellington in the subjugation of Wesslandia, helping the tyrant outmaneuver and defeat the fractured warbands through a quick and easy conflict. While their allies were no longer here to assist, and Wesslandia was much more of a threat with their unified force far outnumbering Svartpels' depleted numbers, Torben still remembered exactly how to defeat them, and that knowledge was about to be put to good use. For in a long, protracted war, Wesslandia's numbers would surely overwhelm them, so time would be of the essence.\n\nSvartpels' warbands marched southward, led personally by Torben himself. Soon enough they met their opponents, armed with axes just as they were as tradition demanded for this engagement. The Wesslandians clearly outnumbered them, but Torben knew that didn't matter. For they had things that Wesslandia and their clans could never possess, the strength, conviction, and determination to see victory achieved. Each Svartpels warrior fought with the strength of ten bears, striking like thunder itself into the enemy lines. It was difficult, but the opponent's warbands eventually broke, leaving Torben the leader of this small engagement. But that was only the start.\n\nWhat followed was a series of incredibly quick attacks, as the panserbjørn of Svartpels rushed to further defeat the Wesslandian warbands before they could regroup. Time and time again they struck, moving as fast as lightning across the forests and hills. Their armies thrown into complete disarray, the leaders of the clans were forced to submit and reaffirm their status as subjects in a mirror of the last unification war. Only this time, it was not Paw Wellington they renewed their loyalty to, but Thunder Lord Torben."
svartpels.12.a:0 "Numbers are no match for history and strength of will!"


svartpels.17.t:0 "What Must be Done"
svartpels.17.d:0 "It was incredibly saddening, to see an entire region such as Wesslandia fallen to the changelings' work. Oh, they denied it, of course, but what else could explain this sudden unity of clans, something that went against all of bear tradition? They had been tainted, and only one option remained for them. Their complete destruction for the sake of the true bears remaining.\n\nThe battles that followed in the forests of Wesslandia were bloody. Countless bears died, and corpses piled on each other as bear fought bear to the death. And while the Wesslandians may have had the numbers, they could never have the honor, the courage or the strength of Torben and his warriors, and inevitably were pushed back, their warbands getting destroyed. Their so-called unity fractured, as any changeling would when met with the power of a bear, with clans simply retreating to fend for themselves.\n\nWhat followed was a campaign of pure destruction, as Torben set out to finish what they had started. Their fortresses, the last remaining bastions of their control at this point had to fall. One by one they fell, their warriors and elders slaughtered without mercy, for none would be given for agents of changelings. Only the whelps and the cubs survived, deemed either too weak to be a threat or too young to have been corrupted. And by the end of it all, the bountiful Wesslandia was quiet once more, only the native beasts walking amongst the wilderness."
svartpels.17.a:0 "It may weigh heavily on us, but it is done."


svartpels.19.t:0 "Stemming the Flow"
svartpels.19.d:0 "Though we have discovered the changelings' obvious infiltration and subsequent sabotage of bear unity, there is still a much more dangerous problem caused by them that could destroy bear tradition and society itself if left unchecked. And that is the endless waves of outcasts and exiles that have been pouring into the bear lands, the last act clearly created by foreign infiltration yet attributed to Paw Wellington. Nevertheless, these radicals have been constantly raiding our loyal and honorable bears and clans, and it is time to put a stop to them.\n\nNow that Wesslandia is secure, the opportunity has finally arisen to cut a major source of these traitors and outcasts, and those are the roads leading in from the east, in particular the lands of the griffons. By cutting and closing these roads inward, a major inlet has been stemmed, and already we have seen a decrease in the numbers of raids occurring daily. Though the territory we do not control yet still allows them entrance and the problem is not yet completely solved, soon enough these exiles will be gone from our lands and only true bears will remain."
svartpels.19.a:0 "These bears have no place here anymore!"

svartpels.20.t:0 "The Clans of War"
svartpels.20.d:0 "For the longest of times, Clan Svartpels has always respected the various clans that live in the desolate lands of Onlartir. They have not only respected and followed the traditional way of bear life and combat for the longest time, but also served as the bulwark against the yak and changeling invaders whenever they dared attempt to invade. The battles fought against them during the first unification wars were some of the most difficult Clan Svartpels had ever faced, and the three clans of Kane, Gotlung and Rozenkrantz are the pinnacle of bear militarism.\n\nHowever, with the recent chaos across all bear lands, Onlartir too has been affected by the changeling infiltration. They have completely forsaken the idea of bear unity that we had subjugated them for in the first place, instead talking about the strength of solitary clans under the protection of Clan Scyfling. It seems they have already forgotten their history of being subjugated by an alliance of ourselves and our old allies, and even more mysteriously this claimed protection from the Despot is nowhere to be seen. Meaning that while this could just be typical bear stubbornness, it could also be the work of the vile changelings..."
svartpels.20.a:0 "One way or another, the land will be ours."

svartpels.21.t:0 "United We Stand"
svartpels.21.d:0 "The great warriors of Clan Kane. The unbreakable fortresses of Clan Gotlung. The powerful shamans of Clan Rozenkrantz. All of them were formidable forces, who each had their own strength at which they excelled. But they still had their weaknesses as well, and those would be the cause of their defeat. For Clan Svartpels, as weakened as they were, was still a major clan and fully united in spirit, something that the clans of Onlartir could never be.\n\nClan Kane was the simplest. A traditional battle as demanded, a great charge by both sides as bears tore into one another. Those of Kane were great warriors indeed, matching Torben's own, and yet Svartpels still achieved victory once the Thunder Lord had defeated Grand Elder Ase on the field of battle. Gotlung was more difficult, with their great fortress of ice and steel standing proud and the clan warriors fighting tooth and nail. It was troublesome to say the absolute least in fighting through the impressive fortress, with all their defenses against a bear attack, yet their elders were soon forced to admit defeat as well. Yet it was Rozenkrantz, who was fought at Skybreaker Peak that was without a doubt the hardest to subdue. The mountain winds and beasts were already dangerous to an ursine on their own, and the warriors and shamans seemed to be blessed by the northern winds themselves. The Shaman Lord himself was the strongest of all Torben had faced, yet he still emerged victorious. And by the end of the battles, all three clans had sworn their new loyalty as subjects to the Thunder Lord and Clan Svartpels, and this time they would not be influenced by infiltrators so easily."
svartpels.21.a:0 "And divided they fell."

svartpels.22.t:0 "Fall of the Lords"
svartpels.22.d:0 "Due to their proximity to the changeling hives, it should have been expected that the clans of Onlartir would have been the first to be turned. And yet when he first heard the claims that they were under the protection of Clan Scyfling, Torben had for the briefest moment held out hope that Clan Scyfling was still strong. But when his panserbjørn returned, they brought back no proof of such claims. Their lies were hollow, a sure sign of their one true enemy. And so, the three clans of Onlartir would have to fall as well.\n\nClan Kane was the first to fall. Though they admittedly fought well and hard against us, Svartpels was determined to let no bear stand in the way of unity. Clan Gotlung was next, their great fortress being the only real obstacle from their destruction. Though many died taking it, in the end it only served as their resting place for all the warriors who once lived there. As for Clan Rozenkrantz, they may have had the winter winds on their side, but Torben and his warriors still had a stronger spirit. And by the time it was said and done, all that was left of their clans were the blood-soaked battlegrounds of Kane, the red-splattered walls of Gotlung, and the howling frozen spirit and winter lights atop Skybreaker Peak."

svartpels.24.t:0 "An Ancient Rival"
svartpels.24.d:0 "Since almost the dawn of Clan Svartpels itself, we have always been fierce rivals with the mountainous Clan Volsungr. Their way of living and fighting is odd, relying on beast-slaying Nanooks instead of traditional warriors and living in mountains more fit for diamond dogs than bears. And yet their vast amounts of Starsteel armor and weapons surpassed all other clans', and their ritualized wars with our kin in spirit to the south, the Yaks showed their worth as true bears. It was thus with great sadness that we learned during the last unification wars that the result of our and Scyfling's conflict with them was almost complete extinction.\n\nIn an effort to survive, though, Clan Volsungr went too far in what they did. Accepting back exiles from beyond the polar bear lands, not forcing them to win a trial by combat... It was no wonder that they were corrupted and tainted by Equestrian influence into what they are today. Volsungr is not tainted by the far-reaching changeling influence, but the so-called Princess Eira has taken something far worse, something that may have made them beyond saving..."

svartpels.25.t:0 "Submission of Harmony"
svartpels.25.d:0 "Forcing the bears of Clan Volsungr to submit would be a difficult task, that was for certain. For while they were tainted by the southern Equestrians, they had self-propelled armored sleds and long-range weaponry reminiscent of Paw Wellington's artillery. And while their ideals were weak and against all bears stood for, no one could deny their conviction for them. A last remnant of their old clan ways, back when they were much more like Svartpels in having strong unshakable beliefs.\n\nIn terms of terrain and technology, Volsungr certainly had the advantage. Their Nanooks were much more used to fighting on the mountainous terrain of the Volsungr territory than our own, and at first even our great warriors struggled to push southward. As both forces of warbands clashed ferociously, Torben saw that spark, that last remaining spirit of the old clan, and that gave him hope that maybe, Volsungr was not yet lost. So, when they had finally made it to the main Volsungr fortress, Torben challenged Princess Eira to a traditional bear duel, to prove the supremacy of Svartpels' beliefs over hers.\n\nEira emerged from the entrance of the mountain clad in gold and fabric, something which Torben saw as the very definition of everything wrong with the Clan. It was a symbol of their weakness, the very essence of their fall from grace. And yet in the duel, Eira proved herself no whelp as she fought the Thunder Lord almost to a standstill. Almost. In the end, Torben emerged the victor, with Eira defeated. And symbolically shedding the various trivialities she wore, Eira and the rest of Clan Volsungr present swore their loyalty to Torben, honoring the ancient system of clans and showing that their ancient spirit still lived on."

svartpels.30.t:0 "Weakness Shattered"
svartpels.30.d:0 "It was something that, in hindsight, was a long time coming for Clan Volsungr. The obvious outcome of a clan who blindly lets any bear back in a desperate attempt for survival, without caring for the consequences. They were infected with foreign influence long before the changelings ever arrived, and it was time to put a stop to this disgusting disease of weakness. Harmony would be shattered, as would all those who had brought such a perversive ideology here.\n\nThe clan did not go down easily. As one could suspect, they fought with all their might to keep their new ideals, as tainted as they were. The armored sleds and long-range weaponry they possessed made things difficult, but the panserbjørn of Clan Svartpels would not be deterred. Bit by bit, step by step, bear by bear, they pushed ever onward, until the Volsungr had no more ground left to give. Even when Torben himself was going through their great mountain caves to root out the last bastions, they fought with reckless abandon in their natural home, having the clear advantage. Torben himself took major injuries, suffering a few cracked ribs and bleeding by the end of it.\n\nBut their ideology proved their downfall, and the spirit of Svartpels was unbreakable. As the sun set over the bear lands, the Thunder Lord emerged from the caves, having ordered any and all records, artwork, anything that could be even possibly related to their new beliefs burned and destroyed. Volsungr's only history remaining would be their proud warrior one, as it should be. Harmony had died in the far north, and there would be no resurrecting it."

svartpels.31.t:0 "A Friend in Chaos"
svartpels.31.d:0 "Clan Scyfling has long been a close friend of ours. This has been the case since even before the first unification wars, when the despot Paw Wellington, new leader of the clan had beaten Torben himself in a traditional duel, thus proving his strength and showing us the superiority of his ideals of unity. Ever since that glorious day, we have fought side-by-side with our greatest allies, aiding them time and time again in both their battles and in ruling over all bears. We supported them in every decision, even a few controversial ones, for as Clan Scyfling said they were blessed by their All-Father and kept law and order across the land.\n\nThat time, though, has come to an end. For the recent acts of the changelings has seemed to hit Clan Scyfling the hardest, as they have collapsed and been reduced to countless infighting within their lands. There has been no sign of Paw Wellington as of yet, and though we can only hope that our friends are still fighting somewhere in there, it is possible that we might have been too late..."
svartpels.31.a:0 "Is there anything left to save?"

svartpels.32.t:0 "A Rescue of Allies"
svartpels.32.d:0 "With the situation growing more dire by the second, Torben knew he had to act quickly to save what was left. Waiting any longer could doom whatever bears left who were loyal to Paw Wellington and by extension bear unity. So, gathering the best panserbjørn of his entire clan into a great warband, he personally led the charge deep into Clan Scyfling territory, defeating any bears who fought them along the way. A few willingly joined the Thunder Lord remembering the old friends of the Despot, but many others refused to go down without a fight. At the very least, there was no changelings here anymore, as all the warriors beaten in combat were proven to truly be bears, even if they had been swayed by the changeling corruption.\n\nConflict became especially fierce as they reached the capital of Mathair Fearainn, where the majority of Clan Scyfling's fortresses lay. Some of Paw's best panserbjørn, or at least what was his best panserbjørn had fought with all their might to keep Torben out from Paw's stronghold. It was sobering to see that even their best was tainted by Chrysalis' work, and for a brief moment Torben was worried that Paw himself might have fallen. Fortunately, as he broke into his room, he found his old friend just like his old self, albeit a bit strangely subdued. It was nothing a great post-victory feast could not handle, of course, though according to the ancient rules of the ursine race, since Clan Svartpels had been the one to save Clan Scyfling, they would be the dominant ones in leadership now."
svartpels.32.a:0 "To the bonds of friendship saved!"

svartpels.39.t:0 "The Heaviest of Burdens"
svartpels.39.d:0 "It was, without a doubt, the hardest thing that Torben had ever done. Perhaps not in a literal sense, as Clan Scyfling was too busy tearing themselves apart to be of much threat to Clan Svartpels. No, what was painful to all, even bears, was having to destroy your old friends, your greatest of allies. They did not have a choice, as there was already nothing left to save. Only those who had to be destroyed for the future, for the survival of all bears. And so, the warbands were ordered to not stop until all of Clan Scyfling was no more.\n\nIt was pathetically easy, which may have made the action all the worse. For while Scyfling was once one of the strongest clans, with a strong spirit behind a strong despot, now they were reduced to nothing but pointless infighting. They still fought with the might of true bears, of course, and they died like true warriors. Even when it was all said and done, the ice running red with blood, the Thunder Lord could not be prouder of those he once called friends. They died much as they lived, as some of the strongest panserbjørn in all the land, and no amount of changeling conspiracy would ever change that. And so, Torben knew what he had to do.\n\nFor many days and many nights he and his clan members worked, but in the end it was all worth it. A large monument, made of ice and stone for their fallen friends. It was as strong as any bear fortress, and on it was the names of the greatest warriors of Clan Scyfling, including Paw Wellington himself who they never found the body of. And thus, a moment of silence was given as they all mourned.\n\nHad Torben done it? Yes. But what did it cost?"
svartpels.39.a:0 "...Everything..."

svartpelsb.1.d:0 "Torben Svartpels stood at the very same place where he had first been struck by lightning. It was the only proper place to say what he had to say. Resplendent in his armour, he surveyed the other warlords of the clans as stormclouds brewed above them. The surviving ones, at least. Each one of them a mighty foe, bested only by Torben's thunderous determination.\n\nTorben stood on his hind legs, and began his proclamation. "Tonight, a new chapter begins in the million year history of our race. Each one of you has stood against me, each one has fought with courage and honour befitting of the Polar spirit. And each one of you, staying true to the customs of our kind, has submitted once they could no longer bear the blows. You have arrayed before me your axes and your armour, as is tradition for the vanquished. But I have no use for such trophies unless they are held by courageous paws. Arise, elders! Arise, my greatest warriors! Your clans shall endure evermore, under the leadership of Svartpels!"\n\nOne by one, the clan leaders stepped forward and took their axes in paw, raising them in salute of their new despot. Torben Svartpels began a rumbling, throaty song thanking All-Father for his victory, but was interrupted by a thunderclap. Once again, the Lord of Thunder had been struck by lightning. As the other clan leaders scrambled back up, they saw their new overlord laughing. "An omen!" he bellowed, "An omen of victories to come!""

svartpelsb.2.t:0 "Ultimatum from the Bears"
svartpelsb.2.d:0 "Worrying reports are coming in from our western borders. Though we still have problems in establishing a clear picture, as many reports conflict with each other, there is no doubt that the situation is dire. The local garrisons and scattered scouts speak of a great war host from the west, of bears clad in mighty armour hollering just outside their walls, demanding to our soldiers to come out and fight. For obvious reasons, none of our troops were foolish enough to face the bears in single combat, so the situation remains in a stalemate.\n\nAccording to those present, the bear warchiefs delivered their demands for the immediate return of what they consider 'rightful territory'; failing that, they demand we meet them on the field of battle and settle the matter through force of arms. Acquiescing to such requests would effectively mean giving up vast amount of land and would therefore be utterly unthinkable, yet it might very well be the only way to avoid bloodshed. For the time being, at least."

svartpelsb.3.t:0 "Penguins Kneel"
svartpelsb.3.d:0 "It was perhaps a foregone conclusion, one that would have undoubtedly left many within Clan Svartpels unsatisfied. After all, what bear worthy of such name would have renounced the chance of a proper battle? In the end however the Penguins were no bears; there would be no great fight, no blood splattered across axes and armours. The garrisons simply picked up their gear and left during the night, their withdrawal occasionally harried by the less disciplined warbands and whelps.\n\nEven then, Torben knew to recognize a success. A proper feast was organized shortly afterward, granting the chance of the warbands from the newly liberated territories to swore fealty to their new Despot. As the celebrations drew to a close, Torben Svartpels took the chance to speak to the bears present.\n\n"Today we may have won a great victory, but I say this is not enough! The Penguins have shown themselves for the cowards they truly are. They might hide in their fortress and hope for safety, but there they'll find none! If they refuse to fight us here, then we will bring the fight into their very holds!" The reply from the clans was one single mighty roar, echoing across the frozen wastes."

svartpelsb.4.t:0 "Penguins Do Not Bow"
svartpelsb.4.d:0 "Torben laughed. When one of his underlings brought him the Penguins' reply, when she reported that they had refused his offer and declared themselves ready for battle, he had laughed. Not out of scorn though; in fact, he could almost appreciate the fact that the Penguins had decided to settle the matter in the proper way. His was a laugh of pure elation. The fighting in the Second War of Unification had been fierce, but it had mostly been against old allies and friends. There had been no chance of properly enjoying it; it was simply something that had to be done. This, however, was different.\n\nTorben Svartpels rose to his full height, taking his time to flex each of his massive muscles. He could almost physically savour the next words. "Tell my panserbjørn to ready themselves for battle and fetch me my armour. Clan Svartpels shall fall on these fools as a true polar storm." And he would lead them from the front, but that went unsaid."

svartpelsb.5.t:0 "Ultimatum from the Bears"
svartpelsb.5.d:0 "For the last few weeks, rangers have reported large forces of polar bears massing on our western border. They set up a huge bonfire and held a feast just on the other side of our border. Their hollering and bouts of fighting could be heard all the way at the borderwatch encampment, and warning signals were sent far and wide.\n\nToday, their intentions became obvious. Swaggering up to the regional commander in complete defiance of the border, a polar bear warlord clad in furs, bones and dark plate armour presented their demands. The Griffon Frontier was to be ceded to its "rightful owners" and all griffon soldiers were to begin evacuations of the region by tomorrow. One recruit panicked and shot the intruder, but his round bounced off the armour and he was met only with a laugh. There is little doubt what the bears will do should we refuse the offer."
svartpelsb.5.a:0 "Withdraw. We don't want a fight with these maniacs."

svartpelsb.6.d:0 "Our demonstrations of superior might and fortitude have subdued the cowardly griffons. They have withdrawn from our ancient lands with their tails between their legs, screeching the regular worthless objections of the vanquished. Torben Svartpels ordered the construction of an obelisk of black basalt to mark the border between us and the griffons.\n\nIn a speech dedicating the monument and kicking off a ten day celebration of the return of our rightful lands, he declared: "Today we have righted an ancient wrong. Our forefathers roamed these lands as great beasts, and so it shall be once more. These griffons have shown themselves to be weak and unfit through their cowardice, so I am preparing another expedition to put them all under our rule, as the Jotunn Monster-Kings of old did. But now! The time has come to feast and celebrate. Let the songs of this day be passed down for another million years!""

svartpelsb.7.d:0 "Much to our surprise, the griffons demonstrated an inkling of courage today. They sent our envoy back with insults worthy of being passed down for generations, making the first notable contribution their kind has made to our culture in close to a century. Despite the quality of the invectives, they need to be taught a lesson. Spirit alone cannot substitute for strength, and we aim to prove that we are the stronger by the truest means: war.\n\nTorben Svartpels announced mobilisation plans with a smile on his face, remarking to the other warlords of [PLB.GetNameDef] that he looked forward to splitting the insolent griffons in two, and reminding them to look for any potential owlbears among the prisoners they took."
svartpelsb.7.a:0 "Time for some entertainment!"

svartpelsb.8.t:0 "Alliance with the Bears?"
svartpelsb.8.d:0 "The Thunder Lord of the Polar Bears, [PLB.GetLeader], has invited us into an alliance he calls the "Polar Axis." His proposal was written on a scroll of rawhide, and contained, alongside the terms of the alliance, many ancient stories of Jak-Bear cooperation, as well as a few about glorious battles our peoples fought against each other. Overall, he seems most impressed by our crusade to smash Equestrian weakness and protect the old ways, and says he accomplished a similar feat in his own lands by duelling other warlords until they recognised the supremacy of both his clan and their own heritage. He also made generous promises of shares in loot and territory in our future conquests.\n\nWhile most Jaks would love the opportunity to smash the griffons and Changelings alongside the mighty Polar Bears, others grumble that joining this "Polar Axis" would mean admitting we need allies, and that isolation is the best policy as it has always been. The choice, of course, belongs to the prince."

svartpelsb.9.t:0 "Alliance with the Jaks!"
svartpelsb.9.d:0 "Excellent news. The Jaks have agreed to form the Polar Axis with us, and have invited our elders for a feast and smashing competition. It seems the Polar spirit remains strong with them, and their efforts to ward off Equestrian weakness have truly saved their kind.\n\nAfter three days of feasting and drinking, Lord Torben was shocked to find Prince Bradford besting him again and again in smashing competitions, although Lord Torben eked out a win in traditional Jak wrestling. He has promised a similar event to be held in our lands a year from now, and it looks like a new tradition is being established between our two mighty peoples."
svartpelsb.9.a:0 "What worthy allies!"

svartpelsb.10.t:0 "No Alliance Today"
svartpelsb.10.d:0 "Unfortunate news. It seems the Jak commitment to "isolation" means rejecting alliances as well as keeping out foreign values and Equestrian weakness. The Thunder Lord was furious, roaring that the Jaks had forgotten the Polar spirit and that isolation in that sense simply meant waiting to be conquered. Eventually he calmed down, and began reciting a tale about an arrogant bear who thought he could stand alone without his clan when the great beasts came, and ended up devoured.\n\nThat seemed to be enough to prevent a war between us and the Jaks, but our respect for them has been eroded. Perhaps Jakkind simply replaced the poison of Equestrian influence with a subtler poison of haughty indifference."
svartpelsb.10.a:0 "Unfortunate..."

svartpelsb.11.t:0 "The Wesslandian Alliance"
svartpelsb.11.d:0 "Torben had spent much time pondering the matter of Wesslandia. There was simply no way around it, the region was almost as unique as the bears inhabiting it. They had never known the influence of a clan strong enough to bring the smaller warbands to heel. Wesslandians fought amongst themselves almost as much as they did against outsiders. Aside from their custom of hosting large numbers of Owlbears and griffon servants, there was effectively very little holding them together. That was of course problematic; how could Torben hope to subject clans that were constantly on the verge of tearing each other apart without an external threat? Doubly true if he hoped to put those workshops and factories to good use. What they needed, Torben decided, was an idea they could rally behind, a founding myth.\n\nFortunately, the archives of Clan Svartpels were extensive and their scribes second to none amongst bear-kind. With the help of several of his underlings, Torben spent much time amidst dusty tomes and ancient rolls of parchment, scouring for the information he sought, traces of the legendary Jotnar Monster Kings and their great dominion across the east, towards the griffon Frontier. Armed with such knowledge, it was easy for Torben to present himself as restorer of the Wesslandian ancient legacy, giving the local clans a common origin to rally behind in the process. And so far, the efforts seem to have paid off, as Clan Falsen, Brodkorb, and Benkestok have agreed to a truce amongst themselves in preparation for a great expedition east so to reclaim mythical holds of the Jotnar Monster Kings. For now, Wesslandia stands united."

svartpelsb.12.t:0 "The New Volsungr"
svartpelsb.12.d:0 "It had been a strange few years, the early days of Eira's reign. The clansbears agreed it was not exactly bad, but strange. She had preached and preached and talked and talked, explaining her position over and over again and then beating it into them when they didn't understand. They still didn't understand, not really. But now it seemed, that era was behind them. Eira was still Eira, still undefeated except by the Thunder Lord, but now she didn't preach. Now she didn't explain. Now, she cut to the chase.\n\nThe chase had become a staple of Clan Volsungr life. Chasing down monsters and trespassers, showing your might by subduing them and dragging them back to mighty Eira. She'd give a nod if she was impressed, then tell you whether to release the "noble beast" or to devour it. Half the time when the beast was spared it would go berserk anyways, and you'd have to fight it a second time. If that wasn't part of the idea, Eira gave no indication, just another nod.\n\nShe still wore her old finery, but she had stopped bringing more in from Equestria. The silk was rough and patched, sporting more than a few animal bones sewn into the new seams. Silk, bones and rawhide thread. The clansbears still didn't quite understand their leader, but they would follow her to the ends of the Earth, conquering and pillaging with their warlord to Canterlot itself if she asked them to. Indeed, by her vague references to "showing the Equestrians a stronger Harmony," it seemed she intended to do just that."

svartpelsb.13.d:0 "Gotlung. Kane. Rozenkrantz. Bringing the three bear clans from Onlartir together in the same place was a rather simple process; having them agree on anything at all was another matter entirely. Torben was no fool; Onlartir would not follow him willingly, not even after their first defeat by Svartpels. It was therefore paramount for Torben to bring them under his sway through an appeal to their shared history as great warriors.\n\nClan Rozenkrantz was the easiest to convince. Why? In truth, Torben wasn't really sure. The shamans of Rozenkrantz had mysterious ways alien to any outsiders, claiming to be able to use the frost to see the past and future. After private consultations amongst themselves, they declared full support to their new Despot, though Torben found their newly found enthusiasm a bit uneasy. The mighty defenders of Clan Gotlung, governed by their own council of elders, proved to be as stubborn as their bastions, only relenting after their finest warriors had been bested a second time.\n\nClan Kane was not like their neighbours. Their warriors were a close match for those of Svartpels, their strength, ferocity, and arrogance making up for their lack of proper armour. There would be no discussion with them, so Torben decided to settled it in the only possible way. A challenge was issued to Great Ase of Clan Kane, which she accepted almost immediately. The duel between Ase of Kane and Torben of Svartpels was a sight to behold according to those present, the Despot meeting his true match in the field and overcoming his opponent only through a combination of tenacity, luck, and his heavy panserbjørn armour. Having been humbled in a proper fight with Torben, Ase had no choice but to swallow her pride and listen to Clan Svartpels' proposal."

svartpelsb.14.t:0 "Jorik Swears Fealty"
svartpelsb.14.d:0 ""As much as it pains me to admit it, I was wrong. I didn't know what I was doing."\n\nTorben frowned as he glanced at his friend Paw W- Jorik, he quickly corrected himself. He had renounced the name he had returned home with. Still, in Torben's mind, that hadn't changed who he was. Jorik was still the friend he had fought with, side by side in the first War of Unification. Not titles nor petty politics would change that. Even then, he sometimes feared his friend had not fully recovered from witnessing the near destruction of his clan. "You shouldn't be so hard with yourself. No bear could have foreseen just how deep changeling treachery run."\n\nJorik however simply shook his head with a sad grin. "That's not what I meant. I was so enamoured with the technology of the outside world that I refused to look at anything else. I wanted to emulate Grover I and the empire he built, but I didn't understand what kept that very empire together throughout the centuries." He noticed Torben's expression of puzzlement. "Griffons worship the same set of gods," he explained, "one single faith that unites them beyond politics. I tried to impose a foreign model over the bears without understanding it."\n\nThen, something happened in his friend's demeanour. He looked up, staring right back at Torben, a fierce spark burning in his gaze. "With your permission, Despot, I would like to change that. Clan Scyfling has always been the most devoted to the All Father, yet many other clans have strayed away from him, their faith smothered with time. Allow me to rekindle that flame."\n\nTorben said nothing. He didn't need to. His wide grin was more than enough."
svartpelsb.14.a:0 "It is good to have you back, my friend."

svartpelsb.15.t:0 "A New Living Faith"
svartpelsb.15.d:0 "Amongst the great bear Clans, Scyfling has always been the most peculiar. Their strength did not originate solely from their warriors or their ferocity in battle, even if they had never been found lacking in those two aspects. Rather, Clan Scyfling were well known as the most thorough worshippers of the deities that have watched over bear-kind form millions of years, the All Father and the Great Beasts. Even then, they couldn't claim the mantle of the sole religious authority amongst the bears as the worship of such deities varied from place to place, dependant on the customs of clans, warbands, and in some cases even of single bears.\n\nAfter the events of the Second War of Unification Jorik has returned to lead Clan Scyfling once more, and under his vigorous leadership many changes to the once decentralized cult have been enacted. Greater emphasis has been reserved to the All-Father and the Great Wolf Fenrir as symbols of bear prowess in battle and might, faith and war forever intertwined and forged anew into a mighty cult. The most zealous preachers of Scyfling now roam the land, visiting the holds of minor clans and warbands and spreading with fiery words the message of a new faith. They've been particularly successful amongst the younger generations, eager to prove themselves in battle and turning now to the All Father, seeking their approval in such task.\n\nJorik now watches with approval as Clan Scyfling is turned into a great militant cult, ready to infuse strength into every bear ready to listen to its message. He once tried to conquer the bears with technology and progress. Now, under the auspices of Despot Torben, Clan Scyfling shall unite the bears through faith."
svartpelsb.15.a:0 "For the All Father."

svartpelsb.16.t:0 "First Among Equals"
svartpelsb.16.d:0 "No ceremony was necessary for the occasion. Though foreign monarchs would have used such momentous event as a display of wealth and might over their subjects, Torben had no use for such trivialities. He would not impose his rule as a king or an emperor, like it was done amongst lesser races; he would not crush the other clans with his authority and might. Though a Despot, he was first and foremost Torben of Clan Svartpels, a bear, the most recent piece of a tradition stretching all millions and millions of years in the past. A tradition each bear was an indispensable part of, as per the All Father's design.\n\nA new great hold was erected amongst the frozen wastes, not as a symbol of Svartpels's dominance over the other clans, but as one of unity. At its centre the great representative of the ursine clans would gather regularly. Jorik of Clan Scyfling, their faith rekindled and burning bright; Eira of Clan Volsungr, their connection to the wilderness unchallenged; Torben of Clan Svartpels, stalwart and unbreakable warriors; the three warlords of Onlartir and the minor clans of Wesslandia. Each would gather there as equals, bound together by strength, ancestry, and faith.\n\nThe fate of ursine kind would no longer rests over the shoulder of one single clan. Torben had made sure of that."
svartpelsb.16.a:0 "We now stand united."

svartpelsb.17.t:0 "Nature Above All"
svartpelsb.17.d:0 "The change had been evident to much of Clan Volsungr, yet only now that Eira stood before him could Torben finally sense it. Her defeat by his own paws during the Second War of Unification had changed her, that was clear, yet the Despot had not fully comprehended it up until now.\n\n"They are quite impressive, aren't they?" Eira said with a soft grin, gesturing at the line of new heavy tanks, large and lumbering beasts, waiting. "Our crews of whelps have been training hard. You will be satisfied with their performances. They'll all eager to prove their worth and do their part."\n\nTorben nodded thoughtfully. "Perhaps, though I don't understand why you tolerate their presence on the battlefield. They are too small and frail to be proper warriors. I hope you are not delving again into those pony ideas."\n\nEira shot him a glance, then tilted her head. There was no hostility in her gaze, but slight amusement. "Ponies like to think of Harmony as their prerogative, but it is merely an extension of Nature. The wilds and their beasts are permeated with Harmony and, as their wardens, the bears of Clan Volsungr had been following Harmony since time immemorial, long before herbivores did. As bears, we are in fact the only ones strong enough to uphold its principles when challenged." She waved a paw towards the line of tanks. "As for the whelps, we simply give them a chance to claw their way to the top through their strength alone. We do not deprecate weakness, nor we encourage it."\n\nTorben frowned. Eira, and by extension Clan Volsungr, had in fact changed. And despite some reservations, the Despot found her words worthy of consideration. For now, however, he remained silent, and the two continued their inspection as nothing had happened."
svartpelsb.17.a:0 "Our strength stems from Nature itself."

svartpelsb.18.t:0 "True Son of All-Father"
svartpelsb.18.d:0 "Initially, Jorik had asked permission for a grand ceremony, a truly magnificent gathering of all the Clans. No doubt he wanted to draw as many parallels as he could to the very coronation of Grover I, the moment that had given birth to the Griffonian Empire. Though he could understand his friend's point, Torben had to put his paw down and rein his enthusiasm in. He didn't want any more incidents, and he certainly didn't want for the other Elders to think he too had forgotten his ursine roots.\n\nAnd so, before the gathered Clans of Svartpels, Volsungr, and Scyfling, Despot Torben was proclaimed as Favourite Son of the All-Father. By griffon and pony standards, the ceremony was in fact a short affair. There would be no crown or other symbol of power placed on Torben's head to prove his ascension to power. There was no need to; the evidence was bare to all, through the path of blood carved across the frozen wastes to bring bear kind together for the second time. Yet, that would prove to be but the beginning.\n\n"Brothers and sisters!" Torben's voice boomed once the acclamation was over. "Though a new title have been placed on my shoulders, I have no plan of resting on my achievement. Rather, as Favourite Son, it falls to me the responsibility to bring the All-Father's message to the lesser races, so that they too may be given the chance of rising past their most basic instinct and obtain polar spirit! I ask you now to join me in a Great Crusade! To the east and past the sea, for such is the All-Father's will!"\n\nThe reply came in the form of an earth-shaking roar."

Throughout the ages, the hold had been the bastion of Clan Scyfling, valiant and brave bears devoted completely to the All-Father. It had been the home of a good friend. But now? It was nothing more than a grave of stone and ice, coated with the blood of their old allies.\n\nFrom a distance, Torben Svartpels observed his handiwork. He was not proud of it. It had been necessary, but that did not make the weight of his actions any lighter. Far south and in the east laid similar reminder of the bloodbath that had swept the land. Ancient and powerful clans destroyed, wiped out from history.\n\nHe repeated the old mantra to himself, again and again: his actions had been necessary; the only way to exercise the changeling cancer before it could spread further. Still, he had acted too late, and too little had been saved. Was it pride that blinded him to the bugs' treachery? Could Svartpels have intervened before the unthinkable had happened?\n\nTorben didn't know. He sat down on his haunches, the cold and bitter wind whipping against his fur. The time to exact vengeance against the bugs would come eventually. Now, he had to take stock of what was left."

Many powerful warriors had perished, as had many innocent whelps and cubs. Ursine civilization had been brought to the brink of collapse. This unprecedented catastrophe hung over Clan Svartpels like a dark cloud.\n\nYet Torben found himself smiling. The wound inflicted upon his people was deep, but it would not be lethal. All had not yet been lost.\n\nIn front of Torben sat Paw Wellington. His body was severely injured, so much that he had trouble standing. A large gash on his forehead had coated most of his face in dried blood. But he still drew breath.\n\n"It's good to see you again, Jorik." Torben said, breaking the silence. "You fought ferociously, proving beyond all doubt your freedom from changeling influence."\n\nPaw didn't respond. His eyes were glazed over, and he seemed to have trouble focusing.\n\n"Jorik, we need your help, now more than ever. The rot has been purged at home, but the bugs still plot against us beyond our borders. We must prepare for the battle to come."\nAt this, Paw perked up.\n"Battle? We... we must fight! The battle is not over yet!"\n\nTorben smiled again, much wider this time.\n"Yes, we must fight. And we must do it together.

And most unnaturally, there was little of boasting and comparison of achievements. Rather, the two Tyrants of the polar bears and the few true and loyal warlords surrounded a map which depicted a truly dreadful situation. For the bloodied realm of Ursines was gripped in the jaws of the enemy. For both Changelings and Nova Griffonia sought nothing less than subjugation of all bears and would move in as soon as possible.\n\nThis dark truth was revealed by no other than Jorik of Scyfling, one who previously idealized Griffonia. For Jorik had known that changelings and griffons of Herzland were working together, yet he had not given it much thought before the Second War of Unification. Yet after it a great doubt had beset him and thus he sent out agents and went through archives of Clan Svartpels. And a terrible truth was learned there. For every Changeling push into the North for the last 3 centuries seemed to have coincide with attempts from griffons, be they under Grover or not. Even the lands that such expeditions seemed to claim were of similar size. And now, griffon agents returning from Nova Griffonia reported changeling tanks being purchased. And the terrifying truth was confirmed...\n\nFor the bug and avian bastards had sapped the strength from bears for centuries, subverted their societies with such infiltrations and now sought to strike the final blow... And thus the warlords planned and calculated, hoped and prayed. For even for bears, to fight against such odds? "

The blizzard was intense, and his many wounds still ached, but the sharpest pain of all was mental. The warriors had gotten used to the carnage of this last, bloodiest unification war, but it still weighed heavily on their leader. So many great clans, wiped out. So many Polar Spirits, extinguished. So many friends lost...\n\nAs Torben marched down to join his clan several warriors approached.\n"We've captured all the survivors and collected the dead. Jorik was nowhere to be found."\nAfter a moment's hesitation the bear added, "...no changelings either."\n\nTorben's eyes blazed with fury. "The bugs are more cowardly than we imagined. After corrupting our leaders and turning the clans against each other, they fled from the fight. No matter. Vengeance will be ours in due time."\n\n"As for Jorik, we must assume his remains have been claimed by the snow and ice. He was a true warrior, slain in honorable combat..."\nTorben paused to study the worn, scarred faces of his surviving warriors.\n"...and with his passing, the burden of leadership falls to Clan Svartpels. We shall carry on the struggle alone."\n\nFirst there was silence. Then a ferocious roar rang out across the frigid landscape. The warriors took up a chant, one that would soon echo throughout the north:\n\n"Torben Svartpels, the Lord of Thunder!"\n"Torben Svartpels, the Savior of Ursinekind!"\n"Torben Svartpels..."

Cracks rumbled when another ceiling or floor gives way, spewing out a putrid smell of crude materials that scavengers and rebuilders alike had to confront.\n\nThe lingering devastation had left Torben free to stay in and remember an old room. Though its pillars had bent and its anterooms had been shredded by crack teams whipping out gas and mines and flamethrowers, it remained intact.\n\nThe steel chairs and tables that had never been replaced, the times he and Jorik would plan their next offensive in the first war... bittersweet ash, everything had become, burned to crisps by insectoid manipulations.\n\nDrawers and cabinets were pulled. He'd grasp for pictures, documents, letters, any tangible shadow of his old friend. The little successes, his tiny hoard of post-mortem mementos, turned his heart inside-out. Revenge was too crude of a concept today; now, grief must reign, not with tears, but with a silent standing, listening to Jorik's haunt slowly crumble.\n\nYet, from a hole in the wall, something stuck out: a broken safe, some hidden papers. Taking a break from this place of death, he rummaged inside, discovering them to be schematics and blueprints for artillery (he chuckled; Jorik had somehow grown fond of the funny big cannons), taken straight from the griffons, perhaps Imperial in design. If made correctly, they would be able to blast through so much steel and concrete...\n\nIt clicked. Though Scyfling had died, they hadn't done so without a fight. Their sundering cannons had proved that. It would be enough to sunder in half several millions of changelings, to make full the vengeance of their greatest victim."

Only one other could beat him in a fight and no other creature he had met could strike him down. Yet this...\n\nAnother stream of frozen wind struck him to the side, denting steel, flaring up all wounds that still refused to heal and nearly flipping him over. Was this how griffons felt at the mercy of the North? But there was no time for such contemplation, as he continued his charge. His axe rose high into the air, its head going out of his sight through the roaring snowstorm. And like the great claws of Fenrir, the blade smote downwards into the body of his opponent.\n\nYet the gold armor held. Against all odds, against experience a bear warrior-smith, against all truths hidden in bear treatises on metals, the soft, malleable, pathetic gold held. And yet still, blood ran from joints between plates as the Lord of Thunder grit his teeth in preparation. For he had forced the crystals deeper into his opponent's flesh.\n\nAnd the winds struck again, so hard that metal cracked beneath, so hard it forced him to the ground as ice encased his flesh like a prison. And a great golden shape rose over him, with red eyes shining a baneful light.\n\n"Yield Overtyrant." A voice wracked with pain overshadowed the howls of winds. "For I have no desire of your death. I am a warrior of destiny and northern winds say I must fight beside you for this land. So yield and let me back in!""

The clan was dead, it's remnants driven into exile, it's artifacts stolen, it's holds looted. They were damned to become nomads or savages.\n\nAnd yet what marched into the lands of polar bears after Midas won was no stream of exiles, it was a column of warriors. Great axes coated in a gold and silvery alloy rose to the raging heavens as armor of black, changeling made steel, gleamed in the moonlight. The whelps and young ones of the clan were gathered in trucks of changeling make, yet inflated to fit bear sizes, that slowly ground onwards behind the column. And at the very end, surrounded by warriors in armor that roared as loud as thunder as they advanced, rode the few pieces of true thunder armor of the modern age, great mechanized warrior carriers. Though as he knew these were not filled with warriors and riches, rather within lay the dread technologies for which Clan Tordenstjerne was exiled in the first place, before their lord returned to force his clan back as no less than a great sorcerer lord.\n\nNo doubt much of this wealth was purchased by "Noble" metals acquired from locations no bug would dare to venture, for they were filled with beasts or worse. Yet even then, to acquire so much, to rebuild and rearm an entire clan... To force sciences and sorceries whose methods were cast down to be buried... Whatever Midas has done, he had somehow turned an exiled minor clan into something that could match Svartpels or Scyfling at their peak.\n\nAnd all that Torben had, to ensure this does not turn into the blizzard of conflict over who rules yet again were promises of destiny by a traitorous sorcerer..."

It had been many months, but he had not wandered from the terminal deception that had been sown across his fellow bears' holds. He knew not the fate of so many friends, their doppelgangers ready to commit to their facade unto death.\n\nJorik, a fortunate survivor of said deception, joined him then scoffed at the border past. Let the changelings wheel in here with their tanks and planes. Underneath their metal layers of protection, a scared changeling was at the helm, unable to loosen the constrictions of his ancestors' fear of their million-year-old pawed hunters.\n\n"Your job will become much easier, friend," a jesting Torben said to cut the chilly silence. "Fearful morphs under your command... it is a considerable power to add to your griffon-killing experience."\n\n"Along with their stolen inventions," Jorik replied. A tiny smile then broke out. "Hmm, maybe it will be just like my good old days in Griffonia with Ulrik."\n\n"Except this time—" Torben leaned in close. "—I and all of [PLB.GetName] will be by your side."\n\nJorik shoved an axe to the ground, half-standing on it. "Aye to that, brother!""

For the decadence he had accumulated for himself by serving lesser beings, these writings had foreshadowed the haughty state that Equus's own griffons were already constructing: a new and hideous Griffonian Empire that consisted of Grover wannabes bent on eclipsing the continent with their anaemia.\n\nIt's what he and Jorik himself thought as they inspected a line of AA emplacements stationed at the eastern border. The idea was not ground-breaking: get a couple of anti-air weapons to shoot down flying griffons. A great flood of griffons falling from the sky, though... Torben could see it in his mind's eyes: a sky on fire, raining burned wings, mangled meat smelled all singed and tastily grilled, free food from from the all-loving All-Father. Those who'd survive then surrender would, naturally, have their entry into servitude considered.\n\n"That's one good thing that came out of your time across the sea," Torben then teased Jorik in a lull between shell inspections: "you learned the art of killing griffons."\n\n"If that were the case, maybe I should've been a changeling mercenary," Jorik half-teased back. "Perhaps then I could've learned the art of cleaving the queens in two before their drones seeped into our homes."\n\nInstead of pangs of guilt and regret, laughter coursed through these two friends. The changelings would have their world end soon enough; today and soon, it would be the griffons' to fall first."

Given that their leader, [PLB.GetLeader], openly despises us and our species, an invasion seems to be on the horizon.\n\nOn the surface, this can hardly be considered a threat. The polar bears have only a fraction of our population and industrial might, so victory seems assured. Some politicians and generals are actually hoping for an invasion, since it would justify a swift conquest of the bears' territory.\n\nWhile the ursine state may be weak, this is still a dangerous situation.

When the fighting was finished they would sing to celebrate their triumph, or to mourn their fallen comrades.\n\nNow there was silence. As Torben and Jorik led their warriors to the shore of Key Lake under cover of darkness, the only sounds that could be heard were the crunch of ice under marching paws and the clink of metal armor.\n\nTorben stared towards the lake, its surface reflecting back faint slivers of moonlight. There was no need for sound on this march. Every bear knew exactly why they were here and what had to be done.\n\nThis was the final battle against ursinekind's greatest enemy. This war would avenge generations of humiliation and reestablish bear hegemony across the north. It was a life or death struggle, polar spirits overcoming changeling corruption at last. To ensure victory they must commit their minds, bodies and souls wholly to the coming struggle.\n\nTorben carried on the march without saying a word.

The polar bears have been gathering all the resources they can, by force if necessary, and pouring them into military production. They are also ferocious creatures that fight with unmatched ferocity and fanaticism.\n\nTime is running out. We must prepare to meet the ursine threat before it is too late."

He had never held a grudge against the polar bears, but to be honest he hadn't thought of them as equals either. They were primitive creatures living beyond the frontier, far from the advanced and prosperous capital of Nova Griffonia.\n\nWell, if pride had been the sin of Nova Griffonians, they had paid dearly for it. Their once great city now stood in ruins, whole neighborhoods leveled by ursine fury. The damage was severe enough that Weter might never recover.\n\nThe ursines took Thorsten and the other survivors to the town square. The large statue of Grover I that had once stood there was gone. In its place they had constructed a makeshift scaffold.\n\nAt length, Torben appeared on the platform and began to speak.\n"For centuries have the griffons committed crimes against ursinekind. The Emperors of the Grover Line have invaded our lands, insulted our customs, and slaughtered our kin. From the safety of their palace across the sea they demand our subjugation. Griffons have hunted us even in ages when no emperor led them, for the spirit of the Grovers is stamped upon them all!"\n\n"We have fought them off countless times, yet they always return before long. This vicious cycle ends today. The griffon colony is ours, and today the Emperor's lackeys will be punished for their crimes. Today we shall have JUSTICE!"\n\nTwo warriors brought something onto the scaffold. Thorsten couldn't believe his eyes. It was [GRF.GetLeader], their wrists chained but otherwise unharmed. They stood on the platform in silence, trying their best to die with dignity befitting a head of state. The ursines approached and set upon them. It was over in a matter of seconds.\n\nNow the warriors started picking griffons out of the crowd at random, taking them up to the scaffold and disposing of each one in turn. Thorsten stood, paralyzed with fear, until one of the bears grabbed him.\n"No, wait! You've got the wrong griff. I didn't do anything! No, stop! PLEASE-""

It would be difficult, that much was certain. Much like the Despot did before them, Clan Volsungr would have to demonstrate their strength, their fortitude and their conviction if they were to sway or force the other clans into accepting their rule. But Eira would see it through, she had to see it through if they were to save the bears from themselves and each other, and rule united as leaders and not subjugators.\n\nAnd yet despite her determination, Eira couldn't help but wonder if there could have been a different path. Could she have convinced Paw Wellington to see things differently, to try something else? Could she have saved her kind without the need for this new war of bloodshed? Or were acts of superiority the only method that other clans understood? Princess Eira did not know, but what she did know was that these questions were not just ones for the past. What she did now would decide the future of not just her clan, but the future of all clans and perhaps even all bears in the world."

volsungr.2.t:0 "Problems Within the Holds"
volsungr.2.d:0 "While the other clans continue to clash in the frozen north, a serious issue has developed in Clan Volsungr itself. For while he no longer holds control over the polar bears, Paw Wellington's last action of opening the borders to the former exiles has caused heated debate and conflict between the elders and young ones in the clan. It is clear that if we are to march and unite the bears once more, Princess Eira must take a side and solve this issue before it spirals out of control.\n\nOn one paw, the younger bears want the clan to accept all bears who are returning to the land. Their numbers will be necessary to subdue the other clans, they say, and thus any aid offered should be taken. In the spirit of friendship, we must be accepting of all the exiles, and keep the borders open.\n\nOn the other paw, the elders of the clan wish to limit the number of exiles we accept into Clan Volsungr. While the clan is largely exiles at this point now, with the Princess being one herself, there is a reason the others were not let back in before. Not all of them are as harmonious as the clan, and some were expelled for crimes even many of the clan abhor. Though the borders should not be closed completely, they must still only allow those trustworthy to enter."

While the vast majority of them have agreed to aid us in the unification of the polar bear lands, there are quite a few that even the younger members of the clan consider to have... suspicious backgrounds. Though there have been no issues of violence yet, it is clear these newcomers do not all share the principles of friendship and harmony. Though we will allow them to fight for the clan, we should also keep a close watch on these exiles."

The last few days had been a flurry of activity, as countless ursines from abroad who had heard the news of the recent opening and chaos had returned, eager to rejoin the homeland. Some were allowed entry, others... were not. There were some true and utter bears of insanity, holding ideas radical even for Volsungr. There were even a few exiles from Severyana, now Stalliongrad who were ultimately deemed too dangerous.\n\nIt was quite possible that this was a mistake. That the future conflicts would require numbers, and that the bears turned away here and all across the borders would have made a crucial difference. But at least Keld, and many other warriors and elders he knew in Volsungr felt at ease knowing that the clan was still safe from within. Unity would be maintained, unity under the Princess, and that was what was most important."

volsungr.5.d:0 "Wesslandia, the region to the north has always been the most normal to other creatures, making it the strangest for bears. The land is dense with forest and filled with game and berries, fertile enough to grow tubers and other such food. The animals there are standard in the sense to griffons or ponies, instead of the magical beasts standard in the rest of the land. Even its long coastline is ripe with fish, seals and other such creatures. Yet despite all these resources at their disposal, no clan ever became leader of the region to assert dominance over the foods and other clans. Even facing Nova Griffonian invasion, the clans did not unify, instead reclaiming land and enslaving the griffons who had arrived.\n\nThis has all changed though, as the three current clans of Falsen, Benkestok and Brodkorb, products of a seemingly endless cycle of clans rising and shattering, have forged an alliance of equals. While something like this has never been seen before by the clans, it may be a result of their similar traditions and use of griffon servants. Though their ability to cooperate as equals is admirable, the claims that the "Triple Alliance" as it was now being referred to was seeking to usurp power over the bears for themselves have many in the clan worried and believing that conflict may be the only option remaining."

The arrival of both delegations were relatively uneventful, something that gave hope to the Princess and her companions. The fact that they had not used any grand shows of force or great threats against them usually used to intimidate an enemy clan into submission in such talks meant that they clearly wanted to speak on an equal footing.\n\nThe negotiations were long, and though it was mostly uneventful and civilized and most arguments were talked down through words, there was still a fair bit of fights and violence, with some Volsungrians leaving with a few broken ribs. The demands of the Wesslandians were small, only involving some basic concepts for future agricultural and economic plans of all things, as well as promises that their current system of dominion over the griffons would be left alone. Perhaps the rumors of them wanting dominion over all bears were just that, or perhaps the fear of being surrounded by other clans had driven them to open their minds. The end result is the same; the clans of Wesslandia have submitted to our ideals and our protection."
volsungr.6.a:0 "At least they were reasonable."


volsungr.20.t:0 "Three on One"
volsungr.20.d:0 "While Paw Wellington had defeated the clans of Wesslandia once before, Clan Volsungr would not be able to replicate the tactics of the despot to defeat the clans to the north in battle. They simply did not have the numerical advantage to afford such an attack, especially against the combined might of the "Triple Alliance". It was also clear that they would unable to win a long drawn-out conflict, so in typical bear tradition a large show of overwhelming force and victory would be needed to cow them into submission.\n\nOur forces met the three clans and their warbands at the river, a natural border and battlefield for the fight. Though our warriors were clad in our starsteel armor and fought valiantly, Wesslandia simply had more numbers and began forcing Volsungr on the defensive. They crossed the river and the forests, making it all the way to the foot of the mountains.\n\nThen the Nanooks arrived, coming down the mountainside to reinforce the remaining warbands. Having decades of experience fighting monsters far more terrifying than a mere ursine, they proved to turn the tide as Clan Volsungr fought with renewed vigor. Now it was Wesslandia's turn to be pushed back, through the forest and across the river until they finally surrendered. Realizing that the conflict was all but over now, the clan leaders met with Eira soon after to lay down their weapons and admit their status as subjects one more, but this time under a new master."

The land was cold and unforgiving, even for the polar bears, and to reach the clan itself one had to cross many mountains, hills and forests. And before they could even enter the fortresses of ice, Princess Eira and her entourage were all forced to duel panserbjørn of Clan Svartpels just to prove their identity as bears. Eira had expected this, however, and had only taken along the strongest and seasoned elders to accompany her. As soon as they had defeated the panserbjørn and caught the attention of the Thunder Lord Torben himself, Princess Eira immediately challenged the clan leader to a duel.\n\nThe fight that followed was long and enthralling, drawing many from the clan to watch as the two leaders battled to assert dominance over the other. Though Torben was the strongest of the clan, having only been beaten once by Paw Wellington before, Eira was almost just as powerful and tactical. Even so, it was only by a matter of sheer luck that the Princess had managed to claim victory, exploiting the Thunder Lord's over-aggressiveness. And when Torben rose back to his paws, his expression was one of grudging respect as both he and Clan Svartpels swore allegiance to Princess Eira, the new unifier of the clans."

From sunrise to sunset, she had been met with a plethora of bears in the clan, ranging from warriors to elders asking why they were continuing to fight against the remaining clans. Arguments had ranged from simply wanting more time to recover to wondering why we were wasting time on bears that were clearly unharmonic. That they were more trouble than they were worth, and that Clan Volsungr should just focus on their own bears now that their situation was secure.\n\nFor every single visitor, Eira made it clear that this decision was not up for debate. The new path of polar bear would be for all of them, not just for those in the clan. Not only that, but the longer they remained fragmented the weaker they would become, and the greater the chance that some foreigners would take the opportunity to invade. A few of the more stubborn bears she had to threaten to get them to comply, but by the end of it everybear that left was either satisfied or unwilling to go against the Princess. They were ready to march once more, and finish what they had started."

They even imagined themselves as being blessed by divine favour, an aspect of their religiosity deeply embedded in the clan itself. Paw Wellington had continued to ignore the wishes of the other clans during his rule, something that had inevitably led to the situation occurring now.\n\nHowever, for all their faults, the achievements that Clan Scyfling have accomplished are undeniable. For even with all their mistakes in doing so, the Despot was the first to finally unite bears under a single banner. His expertise from other races is unparalleled in all the clans, especially in warfare, and both him and Clan Scyfling valued law and order not just in their lands, but all across the country. Without his leadership, the polar bears may have very well been conquered or subjugated by another race such as the changelings long before now."

For many years, long before the clans were united, they waged many wars against us in an attempt to destroy what they saw as disgraceful and dishonorable to ursine tradition. While we had beaten them back time and time again, when Svartpels gained Scyfling as an ally in the unification campaign Volsungr suffered immensely as a result of the brutalization that followed. The clan had teetered on the brink of destruction, only narrowly saving itself by allowing the mass return of exiles such as Princess Eira herself which had further ostracized Volsungr from Svartpels.\n\nAnd yet for all its brutality, Clan Svartpels is still considered to be one of the most intellectual and scientifically advanced clans due to its seemingly contradictory stances on things. The clan itself is incredibly brutal and warlike, yet its leaders are cultured in both bear history and tradition. They opposed change and advancement when suggested, yet was one of Paw Wellington's most loyal supporters when he led the polar bear lands. And even with all their focus on the strength of a creature, they enjoyed the company of the penguins of all races.\n\nBut now it seems that they have descended into paranoia. For in the far north, they separated from the Despot in the first place believing that all the recent problems have been solely the cause of changeling infiltrators. Any bear that seeks to get close to the clan must fight a duel to prove their identity as a bear, something that may prove troublesome to overcome."
volsungr.31.a:0 "An enigmatic situation..."

volsungr.32.t:0 "The Princess and the Despot"
volsungr.32.d:0 "Princess Eira approached Clan Scyfling for negotiations expecting many things. A spiteful despot. A religious fanatic. A raging ursine. A clan willing to do whatever it takes to regain control. She had entered the negotiations with a mask of frost and steel, determined not to show weakness to the despot.\n\nWhat Eira had gotten, however, was absolutely nothing like what she had expected. She arrived at his fortress of ice with little trouble, waiting within while the Despot finished some necessary duties of his. While she waited, Eira could not help but notice the large statue of a bear-like beast, something that almost every warrior of Clan Scyfling paid respects to as they passed. And the clan members, they all walked with such purpose, with order unlike the chaos that usually described the business in other tribes. The despot certainly had done his work here, that was for sure.\n\nWhen it finally came time to speak with him, the meeting was very different from what she had imagined as well. Paw Wellington was a former exile like herself, and it was clear that his experiences have molded him just as they had molded her. And just like her, he was not going to give up those ideas and beliefs easily. The talks were long and arduous, as the two bears fought a battle of words and minds attempting to gain the upper paw on the other. Wellington was no fool, and he was much more experienced in such tactics than Eira was. And yet, with Clan Volsungr itself in a much stronger position than Clan Scyfling, there was only so much he could do. Not only that, but as the talks continued he seemed to slowly lose the will to continue, his mind almost drifting off elsewhere. By the time Eira and the Volsungrians had exited the fortress of ice and stone, it was clear that while many concessions had been made, it was no longer Scyfling in lead, but Volsungr."
volsungr.32.a:0 "Words only go so far without the strength to back them."


volsungr.35.t:0 "No Compromise"
volsungr.35.d:0 "Despite the recent chaos, Clan Scyfling still remained one of the most powerful clans militarily. They of course had the Despot himself, Paw Wellington to lead them, as well as subjects in the clans of Onlartir. However, they were also lacking one critical thing, and that was unity. With Paw Wellington's failure to keep order, tensions between Scyfling and the south were at an all-time high, and their cooperation was at a breaking point.\n\nThe two armies of warbands met in the hills close to the border with Volsungr's territory, led by the Despot and the Princess respectively. Their numbers were close to equal, and though Clan Volsungr had their warriors of starsteel, Clan Scyfling still possessed great weapons of death, a force of artillery. At first, the battle seemed to sway towards Paw Wellington, as many bears of Volsungr fell to the great power and might of the artillery shells and tactics of the Despot. But cracks slowly began to appear in the enemy, as cooperation between the clans of Scyfling and Onlartir were weak. At one point close to an entire warband was destroyed by friendly fire from their own shells. Princess Eira, seeing this weakness took advantage immediately, creating unified assaults and breakthroughs through their lines, causing immense disarray. Their forces quickly starting to dwindle, they were forced to retreat.\n\nThis outcome continued in several other battles across the polar bear lands, as Paw Wellington's warbands were continuously pushed back simply from a lack of unity and command, something that our own armies possessed. The effect was almost immediate, as after it was clear they were on the losing side the various clans of Onlartir broke off from Clan Scyfling, instead surrendering to Clan Volsungr. The Despot, realizing that all was lost at this point, gave up soon after, leaving the entire west of ursine lands subdued in a single claw swipe."
volsungr.35.a:0 "The Despot has been defeated!"

volsungr.36.t:0 "The Battle of Raumelf River"
volsungr.36.d:0 "The warbands of Volsungr and Svartpels met on Raumelf River, the natural border that separated Clan Svartpels' territory from the rest of the bear lands. Due to their suspicion against all other bears due to the recent chaos and suspecting changeling intrusion, it was clear that they would not be satisfied by anything other than a traditional battle and victory. Therefore, both sides were outfitted with nothing more than mere axes, weapons that Torben's clan were much more skilled in using. And even with Volsungr's clear numerical advantage, from the start of the battle it became obvious that numbers didn't matter here, only skill, strength and conviction.\n\nIt was not over in any short amount of time. Quite the opposite in fact. Over the course of an entire week, bears fought each other head on, some resorting to their bare claws on the battlefield. It was a long stalemate as neither clan could gain the upper paw, until finally on the seventh day things changed. Princess Eira herself and the rest of the elders personally came onto the frontlines, as did Thunder Lord Torben and his panserbjørn. As fighting continued to rage all around them, Eira barely managed to defeat Torben in battle, which truly marked the end of the conflict as the Thunder Lord stood back up and gave a single nod before announcing his surrender. Clan Volsungr had apparently proven themselves worthy, as soon after Clan Svartpels affirmed their loyalty to the Princess just as they had to Paw Wellington years ago."
volsungr.36.a:0 "Success is the best show of strength!"


volsungr.39.t:0 "Victory at Last"
volsungr.39.d:0 "It was done. Though they were faced by obstacle after obstacle, Princess Eira had united the clans once more. From north to south, east to west, all acknowledged Eira and Harmony as the leader and path of all bears. The strength of their beliefs was proven without a doubt, and the time of chaos had come to an end.\n\nBut there is no time to rest on our victories. True strength is proven through actions, not words, and so we shall carry out what we have promised we shall do. All clans will have a say in the future, a united future of harmony and unity. For how apart we may fall, together we will overcome anything that dares block our way."
volsungr.39.a:0 "For the new future!"



volsungrb.1.t:0 "A Unique Situation"
volsungrb.1.d:0 "Compromise was not something that was common or normal among ursines. Ideas had to be fought for to the letter, and only one would be proven superior. Yes, the loser did usually keep a few of their old ideas to mesh with the new, but the victors never felt any need to cater to the defeated. After all, why would anybear want to adopt something that was proven inferior?\n\nOur situation, on the other paw, is nothing close to the norm of bearkind. Our negotiations with other clans have saved lives and given us moral superiority, for what that matters, but it also has put us on a much more fragile footing compared to the other clans. They are not kept under our banner through force, threats or subjugation, but simply by their own free will and word. The ties between Tyrant and lesser no longer exist, and that means we will have to tread carefully and keep them satisfied if we are to keep bearkind together. But though the next few days will be... difficult, to say the least, we will be stronger for it in the end. For what has our diplomacy proved, if nothing then that every clan has something worth listening to?"
volsungrb.1.a:0 "Actions and understanding are the binds of unity, not force."

volsungrb.2.t:0 "The First Princess"
volsungrb.2.d:0 "The meeting hall in Mathair Fearainn had been repurposed for the grand event today. Bears of all clans had traveled to Clan Scyfling's great home to witness what was unprecedented in all the written history of bearkind. For today the first coronation of the Polar Princess was to take place, with the consent of all the major clan leaders.\n\nAfter short deliberation, Eira had chosen to make the ceremony short and to the point, as to keep at least some part of bear tradition within. It consisted of nothing more than an oath in front of the ursines to work with, listen to and respect the rights of each clan, and the crowning itself. The crown was a simple ring shape reinforced with starsteel and inlaid with gems, both regal and strong enough to be used as a weapon if necessary, which was also intentional.\n\nThe unique relationship between the Princess and her subjects, though, was no better demonstrated than at the very end. For when it came time to bow to their new monarch, while the masses of warriors did so, Thunder Lord Torben and Paw Wellington did not. She may have been the unifier, but they were not true subjects. As long as Eira held their loyalty, the clans would follow. But if she went against them at a inopportune time... the consequences could be far worse than what happened to the Despot."
volsungrb.2.a:0 "To the new Princess of Ursines!"

volsungrb.3.t:0 "A Union of Grace and Order"
volsungrb.3.d:0 "It was not convincing Paw Wellington to accept Princess Eira's proposal that was difficult. No, it was actually finding him in the first place that proved to cause the most trouble. No one in Clan Scyfling had seen him in days, and his former quarters left no evidence as to where he might have gone. Pseudo-search parties were formed to find him immediately, with Eira herself leading them.\n\nHe was found in an odd place, a lone fortress near the edge that separated the east and west of Key Lake. A single massive statue, even larger than the one of the great bear-like figure that was also within the fortresses of Clan Scyfling made up the centerpiece of the area. Paw Wellington was clad in odd priestly robes, seemingly in prayer to the beast in front of him. When he saw Eira he seemed initially hostile, but once she made clear her intent to propose to him, he grudgingly accepted. Why remained a mystery to all but Paw himself, but that didn't matter to Eira.\n\nThe ceremony was set up by members of both Clan Volsungr and Clan Scyfling in Mathair Fearainn, in front of the great All-Father. It was very orderly, and a priest that Paw had selected himself ordained them as husband and wife, invoking something closer to griffon rites than bear tradition. At his suggestion, Eira officially renamed herself to something more similar to the Despot, eventually settling on Maw Wellington. And so all the polar bears clapped respectfully at the new pair of royals, as Princess and Prince."
volsungrb.3.a:0 "To the Princess and her new consort!"

volsungrb.4.t:0 "A Union of Grace and Force"
volsungrb.4.d:0 "Convincing Torben of going along with the marriage was no easy task. Many of Clan Svartpels saw the proposal as purely something that came from the south and from the pony lands, and like everything with that title they regarded it with immense suspicion and skepticism. Only after a promise of it being done in nature as a compromise, as well as holding a great afterparty involving large amounts of traditional bear activities did the Thunder Lord finally accept her proposal.\n\nThe marriage itself was held in Svartpels' territory far north, on a clearing inside a great snowy forest. The ceremony itself was short and simple, as a presiding bear asked them to recite their vows and then proclaimed them partners for life. Torben was then crowned as the new Prince of the Polar Bears, as elders from all clans expressed their approval through various roars and pounding of weapons. Perhaps not a picture-perfect storybook ending, but it was close enough.\n\nAfterward, just as promised, the caskets of alcohol were opened and a massive party ensured. Bears drank, ate, and fought great duels as Torben watched and laughed through it all. By the time the moon was rising over the horizon, not a single ursine barring the Princess herself present was in any coherent state. Even inebriated, Torben still was determined for the final act, wrestling a Turabaq to the ground. And at midnight on the dot, he rose from the hastily built arena, bleeding and battered, but victorious over the monster, forcing it into submission as it knelt before the Princess, and all polar bears chanted their approval and respect to the new Prince."
volsungrb.4.a:0 "To the Princess and her new consort!"

volsungrb.5.t:0 "The Waiting Game"
volsungrb.5.d:0 "Patience was not a natural trait of most ursines. Polar bears were doers, they preferred to take action instead of waiting for something to happen or an opportunity to present itself. They made their own opportunities, seized the initiative, took chances and lived with both their victories and their defeats. It was just how bear society had worked for millenia.\n\nLove did not work the same way. You could not force yourself to love someone else, at least not really. It came naturally, like a butterfly landing on a branch. Yes, you could seek it out, but in the end it was up to fate whether you would find your partner or not. And that was what marriage was all about, even in fantasy, it was about two creatures loving each other no matter what the cost. Princess Cadance and by extension the Crystal Empire did it, and so Princess Eira would follow in her pawsteps... or rather hoofsteps. She would build her nation like theirs, in preparation for when the time would come.\n\nHopefully her true love would appear one day. He would be her true Prince, and they would have a wonderful heir to raise. But it was quite possible that he would never come, and she would be left alone for the rest of her days. Eira would still find a heir of course, somebear to take her place. The nation was more important than her daydreams of a storybook ending. Yet she could still hold out hope that out there, someplace in the world, a bear meant for her was coming.\n\nAll she could do now was wait."
volsungrb.5.a:0 "Wait, and see what the future brings."


volsungrb.7.t:0 "The Three Principles"
volsungrb.7.d:0 "Paw Wellington's absence has continued to the confusion of the rest of ursinekind, leaving the leadership of the clan to the Assembly and causing some to assume that a terrible fate has befallen upon him. However, the clan members insist that he is still alive and well, just retracted from public life. This seems to have been proved as a package addressed to Princess Eira herself has come straight from Paw Wellington via messenger, which contained a simple book and a request to allow the Assembly to implement the points within it.\n\nThe book was a fairly well-known one, particularly in Griffonia. It was "The Three Principles", written by Alexander Kemerskai which outlined his goals of Liberty, Democracy and Prosperity, as well as the other ideals of the Griffonian Republic. It seemed to be Paw's personal copy of it, as many phrases and parts of it were either crossed out or circled, and little notes between the lines were commonplace. Bolded ones included the phrases "law and order", "necessary leadership", "Father of the Republic", and "constitution". Not all of the contents Eira agreed with, of course, but it was certainly something to think about. Perhaps she would give the Scyfling Assembly the opportunity Paw had asked for..."
volsungrb.7.a:0 "Quite an intriguing read."

volsungrb.8.t:0 "The Pyramid"
volsungrb.8.d:0 "The latest work and idea of Thunder Lord Torben, "The Pyramid" can be described as many things. An ideology. A political system. An extension of the clan caste system that the polar bears have had for centuries. In simple terms, it is the idea that due to the ancient nature of polar bear society and therefore the superiority of the system, we are justified in leading and bring that harmonic way of life to others. It explains that the idea of a hierarchy is still harmonic as long as the bears who lead it are.\n\nWhile much of this is just the old ideals of Clan Svartpels recreated, there is a surprising new addition to the system. It places a new emphasis on inter-caste cooperation and the importance of still treating those lower on the pyramid right. That while those weaker and lower should have no ability to influence important things like leadership and government, they are still an important part of bear society and that it is the duty of those stronger to care and protect them. It is the strangest blend of harmony and clan values possible, and yet some cannot help but be attracted by the concept."
volsungrb.8.a:0 "An interesting system, but can it work?"

volsungrb.9.t:0 "Harmony in Nature"
volsungrb.9.d:0 "Tryvge of Clan Volsungr was unsure if he was suited for the task ahead of him. It was a strange feeling that he was not used to, as back in the mountain holds he was a respected elder and seasoned warrior, well-versed in both fighting the magical beasts that frequently came close to the clan and in the ideals of harmony that he, along with Princess Eira herself and others had brought many years ago. In terms of strength and mental will, he was certainly one of the best.\n\nWhat he was not prepared for, though, was working with bears of entirely different clans, all of whom had no obligation to agree with anything.\n\nJust a few days prior Princess Eira had created, with the agreement of both Paw Wellington and Thunder Lord Torben, the Royal Environmental Agency. Vested with the full authority to enforce any measures necessary to ensure the safety and continued survival of nature, it was up to a small group of himself and a few other bears, paw-picked by their clan leaders to make such decisions. Tryvge was certain of his own ability to be on this council, but was he was not certain of was whether the other bears would be so wise in these regards, or even care.\n\nBut at the very least, he would try. "Silence!" he roared to the rest present, who had already started threatening each other with battleaxes within the first five minutes of entering their frozen room. They all immediately shut up, which was good; at least they respected his authority as the head of the agency. "The Princess has given us this position to save nature, not to fight! Now, I believe our first order of business should be to go through the records of Turabaqs provided by Clan Svartpels to see what environment suits it best! All in agreement?"\n\nThe bears looked at each other, all before slowly nodding and slamming the butts of their axes on the floor hard enough to crack the ice beneath them.\n\nPerhaps it would not be so hard after all."
volsungrb.9.a:0 "They will ensure our lands survive the modern era."

volsungrb.10.t:0 "Return of the Monsters"
volsungrb.10.d:0 "As Tryvge surveyed the forests of snow before him, he couldn't help but feel that something was different from before. Perhaps it was the way the trees shifted in the wind. Or maybe the beautiful icicles that were hanging from the branches and rocks, shining under the sun. It could even have been the dangerous, sometimes even terrifying monsters that were roaming around, the very creatures that he was trying to document.\n\nOn second thought, it was probably that last one.\n\nOver the course of half a year, the Royal Environmental Agency had been working hard and spending quite a bit on bringing back monsters and restoring their homelands. It certainly was not a normal endeavour in the eyes of the world at large, as many nations in fact wanted to achieve the exact opposite, to wipe out the monsters that might endanger their citizens. But here they were bears, creatures who were strong and united with nature no matter how dangerous it was.\n\nAnd finally their efforts had seemed to pay off. For as the count across the clans finished, the populations of creatures were higher than any in recorded bear history. The arctic timberwolves once again had a sustainable population, and the great Ursa Majors and Ursa Minors roamed the land. Tryvge would be able to report back to the Princess with a job well done. And hopefully, should it eventually come to it, these magnificent beasts would help protect us should any foreign invader seek to invade us and take our lands."
volsungrb.10.a:0 "A successful return to the balance of old."

volsungrb.11.t:0 "Plains of Snow and Ice"
volsungrb.11.d:0 "Ice, snow and more ice. Those were the things that bears saw every day this far north. To many, it was more surprising to not see them somewhere than the other way around. The fields of pure white were beautiful sights when left undisturbed, something that few other places around the world could replicate. And that was exactly why Tryvge and the Royal Environmental Agency had gone around inspecting and closing off sites deemed the most important to nature and wildlife, to preserve it for the far future and ensure that future generations of bears would be able to see their glory as well.\n\nIt was a much harder task than they first expected. Surveying all the land of bears with their limited resources was no easy feat, and convincing the few bears who lived on land deemed protected to move was even moreso. But the process was finally over, and as Tryvge looked out over the lands he called home he knew it was all worth it. Perhaps they would lose some from keeping these parts of nature virgin. But the bears already knew how to leave no trace, how to live off the land and build around such obstacles. And they would grow stronger from it, as they did from all challenges they faced."
volsungrb.11.a:0 "The tundras will always be the place we can call home."

volsungrb.12.t:0 "Standing United"
volsungrb.12.d:0 "She did it. Eira was still a bit surprised at the speed at which it was done, but it had happened. Somehow, without having to subjugate the clans, she and Clan Volsungr had achieved what had never been done before, unity as the first among equals. The clans were no longer fighting among themselves, instead they were actively cooperating with each other and sharing their ideas. Paw may have made them into one nation, but Eira had been the one to bring them together in thought and deed.\n\nPerhaps it was the ideology that was behind it all. Eira had known that Harmony was that which brought creatures together, after all Equestria was the best proof of that. What she hadn't expected was for both it and ursines to come together so well in defense of nature. But they had, and here they were now.\n\nWith the initial reforms finished, now Princess Eira could finally turn her attention to the world at large. There were still more things to sort out internally, of course, as well as the question of who she would marry. But those would come with time, and both friends and enemies would not wait for the ursines to do such things. It was time for the polar bears to take their place in the world, whether creatures liked it or not."
volsungrb.12.a:0 "Let us march together towards the future!"

volsungrb.13.t:0 "The Letter"
volsungrb.13.d:0 "Dear Princess Eira,\n\nTwilight told me today about what you and the other polar bears are doing, and I just wanted to say how excited I am about what you're doing! You seem to really care about nature and the animals living there, with everything you've done so far. It's nice to know someone else sees and appreciates them just like I do. I really wish that Princess Celestia would do more to help nature in Equestria; some places I've visited aren't doing very well lately.\n\nYesterday when I was visiting Canterlot, I ran into one of your friends in the castle. Rainbow Dash was there saying a few things and he got a bit angry, but after they calmed down I talked to him about where he came from. He showed me some pictures from there, the fields and forests, and they were really beautiful! There were creatures I had never seen before, and I was going to ask for more before Pinkie came by and he had to leave.\n\nI'd like to come visit sometime, if that's okay with you. It seems like such a wonderful place up there, with all kinds of plants and animals I've never seen before. I know it's really cold up there, even more than the Crystal Empire, and Twilight told me that it might be dangerous, but I'm sure I can convince Princess Celestia to let me go if I ask her.\n\nFrom, Fluttershy"

volsungrb.14.d:0 "The Equestrian court today has received an odd request, as a group of ursines hailing from the far north has come to ask for an audience with [ROOT.GetLeader].

Now they want to take the cooperation to what they say is its natural conclusion, with an official entry into the [ROOT.GetFactionName].\n\nNopony has really paid any serious attention to the region as of late, as for a long time they were seen by most as an irrelevant backwater on the world stage. But now they are fellow nation of Harmony, and we could always use another ally in these tumultuous times. Forging these closer bonds while we have the chance could prove beneficial for the future."

volsungrb.17.t:0 "The Visit"
volsungrb.17.d:0 "For a mare whose simple visit to the land of polar bears was regarded as an honor, her arrival was rather anticlimactic. As the Element Bearer stood there with her royal guard escort, the first thing the Princess was surprised at was by how small she was. Perfectly normal sized for a pony of course, so she supposed it was just her still used to expecting other strong creatures such as herself.\n\n"Welcome, Fluttershy," Eira said as she extended a paw to shake in a traditional Equestrian greeting. "I hope your trip here was pleasant."\n\nThe butterscotch mare blinked, before shaking it with a hoof. "Oh, um, it was, thank you. Your polar bears were very nice."\n\n"How was the scenery?"\n\n"Oh, the scenery was just wonderful!" It was like a switch was flipped, going from withdrawn to gushing. "The trees and plants were beautiful, especially with all the snow! I've never seen anything like it back in Equestria!"\n\nPrincess Eira nodded. "Thank you. We worked for a long time to restore much of the regions here." The silence that followed was long and awkward, neither knowing how to continue. Both shifted uncomfortably until Eira spoke up again. "I have had refreshments set up in my quarters. Follow-"\n\n"Turabaq!" one of the bears called out. The Equestrians immediately rallied around Fluttershy while the bears readied themselves. The beast roared from its position above them on a rock face, its white coat fluttering in the wind.\n\nFluttershy herself, to the utter dismay of her guards, immediately flew ahead up to the turabaq. Eira rushed forward to try and rescue the pony from the monster, but was surprised to see that she didn't actually need saving. In fact, the turabaq was even letting the mare pet its coat while... purring?\n\nMaybe she could be the one teaching them about nature after all."

volsungrb.18.d:0 "The court today has received an odd request, as a group of ursines hailing from the far north has come to ask for an audience with Princess Cadance. The polar bears have been here for some time now, having taken some crystal pony advisors for their own court and learning from us about medicine and crystal technology. Now they want to take that cooperation one step further, with an official pact ensuring mutual non-aggression and military access.\n\nNo crystal pony has really paid any serious attention to nations that far in the north, as they are seen by many as irrelevant backwaters on the world stage. They are a fellow nation of Harmony, though, and perhaps agreeing to this could prove beneficial if not now than in the far future. With the situation in Equestria, we hardly need another possible enemy, so perhaps we should forge these closer bonds while we have the chance."

Some of our northern clans have fought them in a sort of ritualized combat for generations. However, the polar bears are known to be a naturally combative race, and we may not want to associate with what may be an openly antagonistic nation.

It seems that there was a great party thrown involving large amounts of drinking, SMASHing, fighting, and general friendship-creating activities. Let us celebrate this rekindling of our bonds and strengthening of our ties as a new age to the relationship between us!"
volsungrb.22.a:0 "Hurrah!"

volsungrb.23.t:0 "The Proposal Rejected"
volsungrb.23.d:0 "It seems that our efforts to further the ties between us and the Yaks have failed, for our diplomats have returned empty-pawed. No ursine is entirely sure why they would refuse to sign such an agreement, leaving many in clans confused. Were they not a fellow nation and race of snow and ice? Were polar bears and yaks not the best of friends? Perhaps their isolationist past has driven this decision, or perhaps something else we were not aware of is at play."
volsungrb.23.a:0 "Whatever happened to the shared polar spirit?"

volsungrb.24.t:0 "Fate of the Queendom"
volsungrb.24.d:0 "And that was that. As the changeling drone was escorted out by understandably wary nanooks, the Princess could finally rest easy knowing that the changeling matter was finally settled for good. They may have won the war some time ago, that was true, but what to do with the entire Queendom was an ever-present issue that needed addressing. Fortunately, that issue was one that happened to resolve itself rather quickly.\n\nSoon after they sent out bears to look for changelings willing to work in a new harmonic-aligned regime, a single drone named Thorax appeared. He had been running a resistance against Chrysalis for some time, and said that he was willing to help lead his fellow drones into Harmony. It was exactly the type of changeling they needed, as they could not just reasonably administrate all the land of the former Queendom. So, this "Thorax" would make an excellent substitute.\n\nJust to ensure a smooth transition of power, an official agreement was signed between Eira and Thorax. The terms were harsh but fair on the changelings; they would comply to any and all orders the polar bears would give them, reorganize under the government of Thorax, and most importantly surrender the hive of Soryth and the surrounding area to Eira. Even if he had wanted to, Thorax had no room for negotiation, as the Princess had made clear that these terms were not up for debate. They had forced ursines into a grueling war that they had lost, and this was the price they had to pay. She did promise, however, that the changelings in Soryth would be taken care of and protected as a new part of the frozen north."
volsungrb.24.a:0 "The Menace of Equus is no more!"

volsungrb.25.t:0 "Dealing with the Griffons"
volsungrb.25.d:0 "Ever since the issues with the former nation to our east had been resolved, an impasse had been created on the topic of the future of the avian race. The original idea for them was to allow them to create their own state again and rule themselves, albeit with heavy bear oversight. This would allow the bears to focus on completing naturalization of the Griffonian Frontier, which we would take direct administration of. The relatively backwater lands would be quick to integrate, and would not cause much trouble.\n\nThe other proposal is to outright annex all the land. Some bears say that the fall of Nova Griffonia from Harmony is proof that they can not be allowed to rule at all, and that bears themselves must stand up to lead in their stead. Trying to naturalize all that land would be incredibly difficult and integration will most likely not be accomplished in any reasonable amount of time, but they are sure that eventually the griffons could become just like ourselves, bears in all but name and strength."
volsungrb.25.a:0 "The avians can be trusted to rule themselves."
volsungrb.25.b:0 "They are not ready to lead yet."

volsungrb.26.t:0 "The Yak Question"
volsungrb.26.d:0 "The Yak clans have always had a close relationship with that of Clan Volsungr itself. For many years we engaged in ritualized wars and battles with the northern tribes, building a friendship with them and at the time legitimizing ourselves with the other bear clans as Yaks are close in spirit and strength to us. Their tradition of SMASHing as they call it was very honorable and a show of kindredness. It is for the exact reason that some bears believe that a union of Yaks and Bears is possible as one nation, not divided by race, but united by strength and Harmony.\n\nHowever, that very same argument of spiritual unity and strength is being used by other bears to show why the Yaks and Jaks should have their own states back. They have proven capable of ruling themselves and even if they were led astray once, bear oversight will ensure it does not happen again. We will keep and integrate the northernmost land and tribes as a new clan of the bears, but the rest will be largely governed by the local Yak or Jak tribes."
volsungrb.26.a:0 "The Yaks and Jaks are strong; they will rule themselves better."
volsungrb.26.b:0 "Our strength will be our unity as one nation!"

volsungrb.27.t:0 "The Polar Princessdom"
volsungrb.27.d:0 "Considering the recent victories against many of our former neighbors in the north, it was clear that something new was just on the horizon for all ursines. For their land not only had polar bears now, but also penguins, yaks and even griffons. Change was needed, a new name and a new capital. And so, it was decided that a new coronation would take place to herald such a monumentous occasion.\n\nIt was quite similar to the original crowning of Eira, but with a few striking differences. For one, this was not taking place in a fortress in Mathair Fearainn, but inside a specially designed cavern within the Volsungr holds, a location that would soon be the official capital. There were also the attendees, for now there were griffons and penguins and yaks all dispersed among the crowd. But the ceremony was identical, the same crown was used, and when she stood all those before her cheered not to a Princess of Polar Bears, but to the Princess of Polaria, the newest realm of the north."
volsungrb.27.a:0 "To a new union of species!"

volsungrb.28.t:0 "The Soryth Proposal"
volsungrb.28.d:0 "In the Great War against the Changeling Queendom, one of our less-renowned allies was the Polar Bears to the far north, a fellow nation of Harmony and friendship. And though many ponies do not think of them very often when the war is brought up, they played an important role in extending the conflict across a new front, distracting the Changeling forces from our own.\n\nNow Princess Eira, leader of the nation has come with a request. They seek to take administration of the hive of Soryth, one close to their border on the shores of Key Lake, as well as the surrounding area. The states in question are very unpopulated barring Soryth itself and considered general wastelands, though there are some resources of note in the region. How should we respond?"
volsungrb.28.a:0 "The Polar Bears fought hard beside us; they deserve it."
volsungrb.28.b:0 "Even with their help, these demands are absurd!"

volsungrb.29.t:0 "The Equestrians Accept"
volsungrb.29.d:0 "Seeing our invaluable support in the war against the former changeling menace, the Equestrians have accepted our request and transferred all the land in question, including the hive of Soryth to our protection. This is a great day for all Polar Bears, and a few bears are already asking for permission to settle on the newly acquired land, which is relatively unpopulated. The exception to this is the hive of course, the citizens of which we shall treat with respect as one of our own now."
volsungrb.29.a:0 "Let us celebrate!"

volsungrb.30.t:0 "The Equestrians Refuse"
volsungrb.30.d:0 "For whatever reason, the ponies have seen to deny our request for Soryth and the surrounding region. Perhaps they thought our contribution to the war effort was not enough to warrant it, or perhaps they wish to cater to their new subject in the Changeling Lands. Either way, our representatives have returned to the north disappointed, and this will not be a refusal we will forget anytime soon."
volsungrb.30.a:0 "But why?"


volsungrb.51.t:0 "The Crowning"
volsungrb.51.d:0 "Deep within the mountain hold of Clan Volsungr, a great hall was prepared for the coronation taking place. Leaders from all clans were invited to attend, though a few of them had to be "persuaded" into arriving. Once everybear had arrived, the ceremony commenced, with the entire thing being done by various Volsungr elders. The crown was made of the finest starsteel and gold, with a heavy diamond set within the front.\n\nThere was a real reason why all the leaders had to be in attendance, however. When the moment came for Eira to be pronounced Queen, all of them knelt and renewed their oaths as subjects to the newly-anointed monarch. No longer would they be a simple group of ursines. They would have a name for their country, a true name reflecting that of their land, their untamed, wild and bear-ruled land. One using the old bear tongue.\n\nAnd so, the Untamed Realm was born. From the ashes of the old, a new realm would be created. There was still much to be done, things like fixing the nation, dealing with Svartpels and Scyfling, and most importantly finding where we stand in the world. But the first step has been taken, and that step is always the largest."
volsungrb.51.a:0 "It is time to get to work."

volsungrb.52.t:0 "Our Role in the World"
volsungrb.52.d:0 "The view on what our place towards other nations has always been muddled from bear to bear and clan to clan. Should we befriend or fight our neighbors? Remain in isolation or join the greater world? Even the idea of being a united nation was in question during the times before Paw Wellington's arrival. And the truth is that there is no set answer. Those who were once our foes could become the best of allies, and those we once called friends can all-too quickly become our worst enemies.\n\nIt is for that simple reason that we cannot wait, we cannot watch, and we cannot wait for our enemies to grow stronger while our allies fall. We have to be active as our role demands, both enforcers and protectors of Harmony, and not be afraid to fight and defend others. For what is the point of being strong if you never use that strength for the greater good?\n\nSome many not like this. They watch our ascendence with suspicious eyes, and may try to snuff us out before we even begin. But we stand united under our Queen, and nothing shall break us apart anymore! We proudly stand tall among all and against many, our claws drawn!"
volsungrb.52.a:0 "We will be ignored no longer!"

volsungrb.53.t:0 "The Polar Bear Emissaries"
volsungrb.53.d:0 "Polar bears from the west have crossed the border today, seeking [PNG.GetLeader] for a new diplomatic proposal of friendship. The ursines, long known for their fierce and combative nature, were unusually reserved and official when they had entered Dachaigh. Yet another strange change ever since the new Queen of theirs, Eira had taken leadership.\n\nThe agreement is simple for now. A document reaffirming the long friendship of penguins and polar bears as the twin races of the far north, a pact of non-aggression, and an opening of opportunities for further cooperation between nations. It is true that those to the west have regarded us with hospitality over centuries, and we have many common ties. They clearly expect us to agree, however, and rejecting this may anger them and have... consequences."
volsungrb.53.a:0 "Of course we will sign with our fellow polar race!"
volsungrb.53.b:0 "We have other, better plans right now."

volsungrb.54.t:0 "Friendship Rekindled"
volsungrb.54.d:0 "Just as we expected, the emissaries we sent have returned today with the document of friendship signed and approved. Not only does it cement our agreement of non-aggression in a growing dangerous world, but it also opens the way for further cooperation and perhaps even protection. This was mostly an official ceremonial moment, as nobear expected them to decline. Either way, this is a great day for the bonds of inter-race camaraderie."
volsungrb.54.a:0 "We knew we could trust our penguin friends."

volsungrb.55.t:0 "The Penguin Betrayal"
volsungrb.55.d:0 "Shocking news, for the penguin nations has declined our attempts for diplomacy. Their refusal has left many bears shocked and confused, for the long former friendship between us has been well-documented and their choice now is shocking and rather uncharacteristic. Many are now calling for war, saying that our neighbors are not clear of mind and that something foul is afoot. And the Queen is inclined to agree. If they do not want to sign non-aggression, then they must be planning war instead, so we must strike first!"
volsungrb.55.a:0 "But what could have even caused this?"


volsungrb.531.t:0 "The Polar Circle Initiative"
volsungrb.531.d:0 "More news now from our polar bear friends, for they have officially announced their intentions to protect our country from any external threats. In modern terms a guarantee of independence, they officially call the declaration the "Polar Circle Initiative" and have now requested us to join as well. It is a clear sign of expecting us to reciprocate their move and promise to come to their defense as well. Our treaty of friendship will most likely prevent any hostile moves by the ursines should we decline, but should we really refuse to show our thanks to their possible future aid?"
volsungrb.531.a:0 "Of course we will fight with them when they need us!"
volsungrb.531.b:0 "We cannot afford to get entangled in their future wars."

volsungrb.541.t:0 "The Polar Circle Accepted"
volsungrb.541.d:0 "Today is truly the greatest of days, for the penguins have returned our guarantee of their independence with their own! The signed Polar Circle Initiative has been brought back to us a success, and Pingland has promised to come to our aid should the time ever come that we need it. We stand side by side guarding each other as dual protectors of the north, and let our nations stand as such from now until the end of time itself!"
volsungrb.541.a:0 "A smashing success!"

volsungrb.551.t:0 "The Polar Circle Rejected"
volsungrb.551.d:0 "Unfortunately, the penguins of Pingland have responded to our guarantee with silence. It seems that they are not willing to reciprocate our protection, or perhaps do not feel in a position to do so yet. While disappointing, it does not change our friendship, nor our original promise to aid them when needed. Should we ever find ourselves in trouble, however, we will be on our own..."
volsungrb.551.a:0 "Let us hope it doesn't come to that."

volsungrb.56.t:0 "From Across the Frontier"
volsungrb.56.d:0 "The snowy mountains of the frontier has given us a surprise today, as a group of bear emissaries has arrived from across the border. Far from the savage warriors we were accustomed to, these bears were diplomatic and reserved... to a degree. During the negotiations for the creation of a formal border that they were sent to create, there were still quite a few casualties in the form of tables and chairs. Still, it was a welcome change from the usual casualties of actual griffons.\n\nAfter several days, an agreement was finally reached, establishing a lasting peace between our nation and theirs. With it, a pact of non-aggression has been created as well, in the hopes that this may pave the way to future cooperation."
volsungrb.56.a:0 "Hopefully the frontier will be a little quieter now..."

volsungrb.57.t:0 "The Griffon Response"
volsungrb.57.d:0 "Despite the fears of some, the emissaries we sent to Nova Griffonia have returned to us both with good news, and a map of the established border between ourselves and the griffon frontier. With it comes a non-aggression pact, promising peace between our nations for the time being. With this treaty signed the centuries-long conflict between bears and avians on Equus can hopefully draw to a close, and soon we may even stand side by side as races of the north. But for now, this is a good start."
volsungrb.57.a:0 "Cheers!"

volsungrb.533.t:0 "The New Nova Griffonia"
volsungrb.533.d:0 "The fight against the griffons was never in the name of some great conquest of their territory, nor was it revenge for past incursions. It was to secure our own safety, and to spread Harmony by force, and that was it. We had no grand schemes of ruling over them, and the Queen tires of both having trouble with occupying the land and being forced to deal with whatever issues arise from it. So, we shall give the griffons what they want and reform the state of Nova Griffonia, allowing them their own nation once more now that they no longer pose a threat to us.\n\nThere is a few catches, however. For one, all of the old frontier and territory leading to Lake Kingsmere will be handed to direct ursine control, as territorial reparations. And while an official council of chosen griffons will make up the new autonomous government, an elder of Clan Volsungr will be heading it as ursine oversight. Some may not exactly consider it independence, but the griffons do seem placated now knowing that their nation has at least been partially restored once more."
volsungrb.533.a:0 "We may still hold their fate, but they will control their lives once more."

volsungrb.58.t:0 "A Drink with our Northern Friends"
volsungrb.58.d:0 "A few polar bears from our northern border have recently arrived in Yakyakistan, wishing to speak with Prince Rutherford and the other yak leaders. Ever since the old leader of their realm was overthrown by the new Queen Eira, relations between us have slowly warmed up as their transition to Harmony was much faster than our own. So, the Prince agreed to meet them and throw a large party that both groups could discuss matters in.\n\nBoth bears and yaks agreed to keep the party fairly tame to keep the discussions serious, which of course meant that to any other race it was complete chaos. Large amounts of alcohol were procured, and all elders involved in the talks were at least on their fifth drink by the time any sort of actual diplomacy was started. The good mood present meant that it all went smoothly, and a treaty was eventually officially created by the yaks and signed by the polar bears, detailing military access to each other's lands and mutual non-aggression. Afterwards more drinking was had, and both parties found great enjoyment in the art of SMASHing."
volsungrb.58.a:0 "What a delightful meeting!"

volsungrb.59.t:0 "The Yak-Bear Treaty"
volsungrb.59.d:0 "After a few days of traveling, parties and negotiations, our elders sent to Yakyakistan have returned with a formal treaty signed between the two parties. While the legibility of the document was questionable at best, it contains exactly what we hoped for; a pact of friendship and non-aggression, as well as mutual military access. The history between us two is finally become something more, and our southern border is now safe not from conquest, but from friendship."
volsungrb.59.a:0 "Very nice!"

volsungrb.60.t:0 "The Twin Khanates"
volsungrb.60.d:0 "When we first entered Yakistown and annexed the Kingdom of Yakyakistan, it was always meant to be a temporary affair. Our reasons for invading were purely ideological, not out of some sort of ideal of conquest. Especially considering our long friendly history with the Yaks, particularly in the Volsungr clan. After all, doesn't a true friend help a friend in need?\n\nBut at the same time, there was a reason why the Harmony of Yakyakistan. Many sympathise with those in the former Jaki-Clan, having their reasons to protect their old ways of life and isolationism. So, the answer is simple.\n\nStarting today, the Yaks and Jaks will make two separate, official khanates, both under limited ursine supervision. With this solution, it is hoped not only that the conflict between the Yak clans can finally end, but also that they may also find common ground someday, and respect each other for what they believe in, just as we in the bear lands respect the other clans. We will also be taking occupation of a few clans closest to the Volsungr holds, for they have expressed an interest in joining our nation officially as new clans."
volsungrb.60.a:0 "Perhaps not the perfect solution, but the best one."

volsungrb.61.t:0 "An Offer from The East"
volsungrb.61.d:0 "The desolate wastes of the Northeast have brought surprising visitors this week, with bear diplomats coming from across Key Lake with both a request and an offer. The terms are simple, in that we grant each other mutual military access for the future, and a pact of non-aggression towards each other to finally being peace to our once tenebrous border. As a fellow nation of Harmony, making a friend out of a once bitter enemy is certainly appealing, but one has to ask: what do they gain from this, and what could this mean for the future?"
volsungrb.61.a:0 "Of course we will accept this offer!"
volsungrb.61.b:0 "Sorry, we have better things to deal with right now."

volsungrb.62.t:0 "The Surprising Acceptance"
volsungrb.62.d:0 "The diplomats we have sent return with surprising yet pleasant news, for the Changelings and Thorax have accepted our offer! Starting today, a permanent peace has been settled between ursines and changelings, and perhaps a friendship can eventually bloom from this end of conflict. For now, though, the western border will finally have peace."
volsungrb.62.a:0 "Yay!"

volsungrb.63.t:0 "The Expected Rejection"
volsungrb.63.d:0 "The smell of rejection was in the air today, as the diplomats we sent to the hives have returned with exactly the news many expected and feared. Nobear knows exactly why they, as a nation of Harmony would refuse peace. Perhaps our ancient wars and grudges are too much to overcome, even with the power of friendship. Or, perhaps they still have more militaristic desires upon our lands. Nobear can say for sure."
volsungrb.63.a:0 "What a shame."

volsungrb.64.t:0 "A Frozen Proposal"
volsungrb.64.d:0 "The ponies of Equestria have witnessed an odd sight today, as polar bears have traveled from the far North to seek an audience with the Princesses. News from that far in the arctic is rare, though word is that a new harmonic Queen has risen to rule over the ursines. They request that we sign a simple agreement, enshrining non-aggression between our nations and military access to cement friendship as nations of Harmony. Though said friendship is usually always welcome, polar bears are notoriously aggressive and violent against their enemies, and perhaps we should not too closely associate ourself with such a nation..."
volsungrb.64.a:0 "Of course we shall open our nation to friendship!"
volsungrb.64.b:0 "Let us just avoid this for now..."

volsungrb.65.t:0 "The Warm Acceptance"
volsungrb.65.d:0 "The bears we sent to Equestria have returned with good news, for the Equestrians have seen the value of our proposal and chosen to accept it! The official agreements have already been signed by both sides, and the event was used as an excuse to throw a great feast and party. While it ended, as usual, with a large amount of fighting, broken bones and a fair bit of spilled blood, the cheery mood lasted for several days as we all celebrated our new friendship with our pony friends."
volsungrb.65.a:0 "We knew Harmony would bind us together."

volsungrb.66.t:0 "A Chilly Rejection"
volsungrb.66.d:0 "Our diplomats have returned with cold news, as our proposal has been flat out denied by the Equestrians to the south. When asked as for reasons why, they cited vague and shaky answers such as the political climate of the world, the past history of the bear communities, and stated that friendship in the future was still possible. Whether they are speaking the truth or simply don't want to associate with us, we may never know, but what we do know is that for now, we will receive no more help or ties from the ponies."
volsungrb.66.a:0 "What a shame."

volsungrb.67.t:0 "On the Matter of Outcasts"
volsungrb.67.d:0 "The meeting room was rather simple, a single stone table with two chairs, one on each side. Paw Wellington was already sitting in one, still dressed in his priestly robes despite the ceremony he had presided over having ended hours ago. It was the attire he wore a majority of the time now, one of the few things he could still lead that wasn't shattered by Eira's takeover of leadership...\n\nThe door opened and Torben walked in, wearing his official armor just like he always did. "Old friend!" he roared cheerfully, shaking his paw just as he had many times before and as Paw had taught him many years ago. "It is good to see you once again!"\n\n"And you as well, Torben." He gestured for the Thunder Lord to take a seat, which he did. "I did not send for you just to discuss pleasantries, however. The Queen has asked us to create a policy regarding the entry of..." Paw paused, knowing that Torben wasn't going to take this well. "...Outcasts."\n\nTorben grunted, pounding the table with a paw. "Is it not clearly obvious? These outcasts caused our disunity in the first place! Letting them continue to enter would only be a great folly, and we need to keep them out!"\n\n"Unfortunately, the Queen has already made it clear that doing so is not an option. Her and I were once outcasts as well, after all." Torben remained silent, which Paw took as deep contemplation. "But you are right, we cannot repeat past mistakes. So my plan is to create a test for any outcast wishing to return home. With your clan's help, they will be questioned on their beliefs, their knowledge of tradition. Only those we believe are worthy will be able to rejoin us in strength."\n\nSlowly, Torben nodded. "An excellent idea, friend! Only those who can find a place here will help us, while those who can't or wish us ill will remain outcasts for eternity! I will personally help with this plan."\n\n"Good. Then I will begin drafting the proposal immediately.""
volsungrb.67.a:0 "Not every outcast should be a part of our future."

volsungrb.68.t:0 "On the Matter of Races"
volsungrb.68.d:0 ""Torben, perhaps you were mistaken on the views of those beyond our borders. Perhaps they are stronger than you thought."\n\nThe Thunder Lord of Clan Svartpels, Torben growled furiously, his paws clenching into fists. "No, I refuse to believe it! The ponies are weak, they have no strength! Not a single one has ever been able to best an ursine in combat!" He pointed a claw at Paw Wellington sitting across from him for good measure. "None! It is impossible for them to be as worthy as us!"\n\nPaw took a moment to think, to formulate a response. "What about the griffons?" he asked finally. "In Wesslandia, their "owlbears" are ones who have succeeded in defeating a bear through trial by combat. Surely you must admit that they at least are worthy?"\n\n"I-" Silence lasted for a few seconds as Torben quickly ran through his memories of the traditions in his clan. "Yes... Yes, they must be worthy!"\n\n"And if a bear can defeat one of our own in combat..." Paw Wellington continued, pushing him onwards.\n\n"...Then they must be our brothers in spirit!" The Thunder Lord raised a fisted paw into the air. "Yes, if they defeat our trials then they are one of us! I must inform the elders of this at once!" Torben rushed past Paw and out of the room, his mind clearly in another place now.\n\nThe former Despot only watched before slowly following him out the icy door, closing it behind him."
volsungrb.68.a:0 "Those who prove their spirit shall join us as brothers!"

volsungrb.69.t:0 "On the Matter of Religion"
volsungrb.69.d:0 "At a round table in Clan Scyfling's largest fortress, five bears sat all in a circle facing each other, all priests of their regional fortresses. Paw Wellington himself sat at the head, having the honor of the largest and most decorated chair due to still being the head of the clan and now also the head of religious matters. He had originally called them here to discuss the future of worship in the clan, but the past hour had quickly deteriorated into squabbling between pairs; one side declaring that they should reject the whole system and adopt the pony way as Volsungr did, the other remaining steadfast in their belief that they simply did not lean into Griffonian inspiration hard enough.\n\n"The simple fact is, we lost to an ideology we once thought had no merit, and it is time to come to terms with that!" one bear roared. "They proved the superiority of the pony way, and now we must follow suit!"\n\nAnother slammed the table with both paws, sending cracks through the ice. "There is no need for such a thing! We were wrong, yes, but it was not in our inspiration, it was in that we kept to outdated and foolish traditions! We simply need to take more from the Three Temples what is necessary and our strength will be shown once again!"\n\n"Your proposal puts everything on the importance of war, of conflict, when Volsungr defeated us using nothing of the sort!"\n\n"They seized our moment of weakness, and if we had strengthened ourselves in warfare it never would have happened!"\n\n"Enough!" Paw Wellington's voice carried throughout the entire room, forcing a silence as all bears turned their eyes on him. "Thank you for coming, but I will be making the decision here. You may all return to your quarters." The priests all looked at each other before bowing and exiting the room hastily.\n\nPaw, left alone with his thoughts, remained in his chair as his mind began turning. He had been wrong, that much was made clear. He had, despite everything he had tried and all the progress he had made, failed. It was a difficult concept to grasp but one that was necessary to move forward. The only question now was how to do so. As the bear had said, was it the inspiration itself or just not going far enough?\n\nWould the future of Scyfling and their faith be of the pony way, or of the griffon?"
volsungrb.69.a:0 "One way or another, change must come."

volsungrb.70.t:0 "Friendship in Faith"
volsungrb.70.d:0 ""So, explain. How does Equestria and the ponies fit with our faith?"\n\nThe priest sat in a chair across from Paw Wellington, oddly composed and calm for a polar bear. "The aspects of the Harmony that ponies worship are quite clearly the same as the divinities that we do. The difference between us and them is that we worship using combat and warfare, while the ponies do so with thought and reason. They are scholars and thinkers, using magic and friendship to honor their deities."\n\n"So we just abandon the idea of our proud wars and battles entirely?" Paw asked, frowning. The priest shook his head in response.\n\n"Of course not! We are still ursines, after all. But look at Equestria and the Crystal Empire, they still have armies even with their pacifism. We just have to change our way of thinking to put friendship and learning first."\n\nPaw was not entirely enthused with the idea, but it did seem to make an odd sort of sense. Finally, after a long period of thinking, he nodded slowly. "Fine, we will do this. We will see if these new ideas have merit after all."\n\nThe bear opposite him stood and bowed. "They will work. Just wait and see.""
volsungrb.70.a:0 "It's worth a shot, at least."

volsungrb.71.t:0 "The Griffon Way of War"
volsungrb.71.d:0 ""The point of the issue we have is that our religious traditions have been shown to be fundamentally flawed," the priest explained to Paw Wellington in a private room. "Each region has its own divinities and beliefs from ancient traditions which has ultimately prevented us from being unified in spirit. The griffons allowed their regional deities, but they all worshiped the same three gods as well."\n\nPaw Wellington scratched his chin. "So what is your idea, then?"\n\n"I believe that creating a central divine figure for all bears of our clan to rally behind is the solution. And after looking through the Three Temples of Griffonia, the god they call Arcturius is the best model. He is the god of war to them, of forges and knights. A deity like him will bring out the war-like temper of us all, unite us in battle and faith."\n\n"But how will that strengthen the clan?"\n\nThe priest put a paw on the table for emphasis. "When the Griffonian Empire was at war, fighting its enemies, it was strong. When an era of peace befell it, it grew weak and collapsed. War is an essential part of it, and even if the Queen will not allow us to strike first we must be ready. As long as we are prepared for war, as long as it is within us, we shall never fracture like we once did." The ursine pounded the table for good measure, sending deep cracks into the clear ice.\n\nPaw Wellington nodded. "Very well, go ahead with this. You have my support. Now leave me, I have a meeting with the Queen soon." Bowing, the bear quickly took his leave."

volsungrb.72.t:0 "The Glory of Steel"
volsungrb.72.d:0 "Torben stared at the wall in front of him, one that had become very familiar to him over the years. On it was a display of the weapons he had wielded, the great battleaxes that he had used to slay countless ursines as the Thunder Lord of Clan Svartpels. His own claws were sharp, yes, and very few could match his raw strength, but it had always been the blade of steel and iron that had finished his foes, a tool so familiar that it could have been described as a part of him.\n\nWas there any difference between then and now? The artillery and firearms that Paw had brought were impressive, yes. Definitely more deadly than his old axes. But they were still tools, metal weapons just as any other. And any bear would not be caught dead in battle without a weapon, save for ritual combat.\n\nWell, if these were to be the new axes, then Svartpels would wield them with skill beyond any other. The forges and hammer would create something new, repurposed now for the guns that both he and his warriors would use. So what if the age of old was over? He would show the clans, no, all the enemies and friends of Svartpels that just because steel was above spirit, did not mean that they were still not the greatest of warriors! He was Torben of Svartpels, and he would accept this change with open arms!"

volsungrb.73.t:0 "Pushing the Limit"
volsungrb.73.d:0 "As the full moon rose over the horizon, Torben turned the page of the ancient textbook and read over the next lines of the ancient bear language. Clan Svartpels had, of course, the oldest and most comprehensive storage of ursine history out of any clan, all written by their ancestors. Reading the knowledge that was contained within was an essential part of any worthy Svartpels warrior, but tonight was a special case. Torben was reading over their greatest feats, their oldest abilities, to see what was lost and what could soon be regained.\n\nThe elders had fully supported in bringing in these substances to strength the bear spirit. Or at least, they did after the Thunder Lord had once again beaten the few opposition members into submission. The demand - or rather, the very strongly worded request had just been sent to the Queen hours earlier.\n\nAs for the stories he was reading now, well they were tales that polar bears could now only dream of. They performed unimaginable feats of strength, even had control over the magic of the blizzards themselves tens of thousands of years ago. And now, with the help of modern wonders, they would get to do so themselves. One still wondered how the ancestors were able to accomplish it, however. Perhaps the ancients had been technologically advanced for their time?\n\nTorben shut the tome and placed it back on the bone shelf. It did not matter how anymore, the only thing that mattered was what was coming. Soon, all that and possibly more would be theirs."

volsungrb.74.d:0 "The blizzard outside raged ever-harder as Torben sat alone in his chambers, deep in thought. It was not usual for him to find a question this complex or difficult to answer, after all most issues that arose had a simple answer. There was a clear, right way to move forward, and that was it. But this was different, as it involved a question that had no single answer.\n\nWhere did the strength of a warrior come from? Was it the bear or the weapon? It used to decidedly be the former, back when weapons were axes and brute strength won battles. But when his good friend Paw brought his weapons back from Griffonia, his guns and artillery, things changed. Technology now ruled, even so much so that Volsungr was able to achieve their victories. It was time to embrace it as well, but how?\n\nThe weapon was the clearest option for most. Even a bear with a heart of steel will fall if he does not have a weapon of steel as well. Plans for forges were already finished, new weapons of war were being developed, great smiths being trained. Clan Svartpels would not be many in number anymore, but every warrior would have anything he desired for combat and more.\n\nThe spirit, however, was also a possibility. There were whispers of new "drugs", as they were called, different things that could artificially enhance a creature to be bigger, stronger, faster. That they could grant increased control over magic itself in some cases, go past the mortal bounds of a spirit's strength. The bears of Svartpels could become the strongest the world has ever seen, perhaps almost as strong as our great ancestors even.\n\nBut only one method could be pursued, and the choice was his to make."

volsungrb.75.d:0 "Fritjof of Clan Volsungr watched the young bears standing around, looking over them with a keen eye. All of them had arrived this chilly morning as part of the latest creation of the Queen, the "Crusaders of Harmony". Apparently modeled after some group of similarly named youth in Equestria, it was presented as an organization where any bear looking for a place in life or lost in purpose could join to perhaps find it while aiding the country in the process.\n\nHowever, Fritjof had just a slight suspicion that they had missed something important regarding these "Crusaders". It did not seem like Equestria to have their young in dangerous situations like he was being told to put them in. But then again, why else would they be called Crusaders if they were not modeled after the old griffon knight-crusaders that had invaded the clans long ago? The avians also occasionally raised their children from a young age to become knights, so they were just doing the same but with nanooks.\n\n"Children!" All the cubs stopped what they were doing and looked at him. "Today we will be climbing up the mountain to fight monsters like the nanooks of old! Only bring a weapon if you must, extra fish will be given to anybear who uses their bare paws! Now follow!" The younglings cheered and formed a makeshift group as they followed Fritjof up the worn path of the mountain, slowly disappearing from the hold into the snow."

Why the princess picked such a reactionary for a husband I do not know, but he is clearly acting as a horrible influence upon her, for the polar bears are now clearly moving towards more unjust hierarchies and even discrimination!\n\nThe first thing that closed off was the army, an institution that means a great deal for bears, for now even the most physically large and monstrous polar bears, griffons and yaks are being allowed in. Then the shifts in production, agriculture and mining sectors began. Even if one can spot warrior creatures working still, by unseen force or by some sort of persuasion there is a clear hierarchy again - the strong rule as military elite and the weak labour away with no chance of rising in hierarchy! It's as if the entire progress of years was undone in days!\n\nI have tried convincing princess Eira and even despot Torben that what they are doing is wrong, yet all I get in return are those deep laughs, suggestions to read the foul book "The Pyramid" or a polite statement that this is simply northern harmony.\n\nDear Princess Celestia, I ask of you for a response, should we remained aligned with such a realm and if not, what can we do to fight against this darkness?"

Polar bears are ferocious creatures much bigger than us, and some find it hard to believe they are acting in good faith. However, a confederation with the ursines would bring us undeniable economic and military benefits.

northern_protectorate.1.t:0 "The Story of Winged Bears"
northern_protectorate.1.d:0 "Covered in black and white fur and armored in yellow chitin, the bugbears are one of the great monsters of the world. Even singular individuals are more than a match for almost any warrior or even other beasts of similar or greater size and might. However, if one encounters an entire swarm of bugbears, the only chance of survival would be a timely escape as even our ancestors couldn't defeat entire swarms by themselves. \n\nAnother danger of facing these beasts is that differently from most creatures of such size and might, bugbears are intelligent creatures, possessing a great memory and ability to work in large groups.\n\nDespite the dangers of facing such creatures, hunting bugbears is an activity which most prominent figures within the clan are expected to partake in order to show their might and combat prowess. However, this tradition has been followed by a somewhat interesting phenomenon as there are always several would be warriors that do not show interest in slaying such beasts, rather wishing and attempting to tame them, sometimes with great results.\n\nOf course in traditional polar bear society such individuals would be banished and disappear into wilderness. There they would spend their lives wandering through places least touched by civilization, taming bugbears and sometimes even more exotic and rare creatures.\n\nHowever Bjornling has a completely different views from the leaders and elders that were deposed. During his years of exile, he had gathered the many tamers that were scattered across Equus and convinced them to join his warband. The bugbear swarms that these exiles brought with them were particularly effective during the reconquest of the North, and thus the military and political leadership of the Northern Protectorate has decided that these bugbear tamers and their swarms should be reformed and integrated into the armed forces of the protectorate to be used against the enemies of Changeling Hegemony.\n\nFurthermore, it was agreed upon that in order to gain even greater benefit from having access to such unique specialists, the talents and abilities of these former outcasts will be used to create institutions to prepare new tamers and tamed bugbear swarms in order to ensure that the armies of Northern Protectorate will never face danger of losing the advantage these swarms of monsters provide."

A creature said to be as strong as the mightiest bear, with a ferocity to match the most violent of clans. Though many have claimed that this idea stemmed from the bears' desire to find an owlbear that could match their strength, Bjornling knows that there is more to this supposed superstition.\n\nThe Overgriff is very much real, it just lays dormant inside of the owlbear. Much like Hyperbearia, the Overgriff has been lost to time, but it can be brought back.\n\nRecent advancements in steroids and performance-enhancing drugs have piqued the interest of Bjornling. Could this be how the Overgriff returns to the world? Perhaps it has laid dormant all this time, hiding inside of an owlbear... or possibly all of them. Nevertheless, Bjornling has signed off on the form to begin testing on every owlbear his scientists could find."

northern_protectorate.3.d:0 "Reports hit Bjornling's desk, a summary of the Sellblades' work.\n\nOn artifacts, not much was found. The band sent to Watertowns were led in circles despite going in straight lines, unable to find the rumoured holy springs of life, though they did stumble upon a couple exotic magic herbs and spices. A two-bear team in Barrad hastily returned after not more than a day, clutching onto a box of minor treasures for dear life. A full squad journeyed into south-east Equestria to ransack some local temples; a few fell into fatal traps like spikes at the end of big falls. The result was some neat magical treasures, which was better than nothing.\n\nAnother set, however, studied inherent sapient monstrosity. A great exchange, it had been: the polar bears retained their primal fervour but lost Hyperbearia's laser blessings, whereas the flame-souls pawned off their original behaviours to borrow from our technological peak. But these flame-souls had not sold everything: Princess Luna once turned into the beast that was Nightmare Moon, and it was a common pony belief that Princess Celestia could succumb to this dark side, too.\n\nSo kirin and ponies were obtained. The former were paid handsomely to turn into nirik. Changelings were then brought in to extract the negative feelings then inject them into ponies, all with sibling rivalry as the pain point—which was why every pony was vetted to have had personality disorders in sprawling families. The result of the emotional extraction-enhancement was a screaming night, nirik burning research papers, and a herd of ponies either unencumbered by mortal chains or just having grown slightly bigger.\n\nStill, this multi-creature collaboration of ponies, bears, changelings, and kirin brought in fresh perspectives. Bjornling had to take pride in how the polar souls jibed with the flames."

northern_protectorate.4.d:0 "As above, so below: so the saying went, and so went the reason for Bjornling's rare smile, for his "below" kindreds, more than a hundred towering Diamond Dog outcasts from across Equus and even Griffonia, had been gathered in the barren tundras for a pioneering excavation project. As per his hypothesis, despite their proximity to magic crystals and a propensity towards the productive sciences, the Dogs had often been shunned by broader flame-soul society, not helped by the tremendous sizes they'd reached thanks to their daily use of crystals; that some were almost as tall as Bjornling himself had been enough proof of their equality with bears. Of course, most surface-dwellers would be repelled by the ways of the underground world of Keter-Mal, the inside realm of this hollowed planet. But Keter-Mal had not been breached; Bronzehill and Diamond Mountain only spoke of mundane mining networks: the Diamond Dogs' birthplace had been lost just like Hyperbearia.\n\nWith a heart for these lost polar souls, Bjornling signalled the excavation crew to dig until Keter-Mal is reached. Weeks passed in the sweltering freeze, with bruised paws and blunted tools giving way to stranger measures: contraptions and machines that could lift tons of dirt in seconds, and acidic crystal alchemy that could soften or dissolve stone and lesser ores. But while the pollution, both to Bjornling's snout and ears, did not aggravate him, Keter-Mal's absence certainly did.\n\nOver a month later, the project would be put on low priority, leaving a skeleton crew to make inches of progress per day. Still, the Dogs had showcased some new tricks up their sleeves, and, more importantly, proven without doubt that they and bears are polar spiritual continuum brothers."

With stalwart determination in mind, he ordered the discreet retrieval of several unintelligent bears scattered across Equus for attempted uplifting.\n\nOver the days they arrived, encaged and enraged. Bjornling stopped to stare at one which had been snarling and roaring for several hours. Its irises were pitch black, devoid of the spark of light that burned within Bjornling and his followers. After a moment of reflection, Bjornling turned towards his team and commanded them to begin the tests.\n\nThe next several days were excruciating. Constant cries of anguish resounded throughout the laboratories amidst the solemn determination of scientists working around the clock to restore what was lost to the poor bears.\n\nIt was only when their patients began to pass out from trauma did Bjornling halt the tests. He shook his head and snapped his clipboard in two. It would seem that whatever stole these bears' capacity for higher thought had also permanently rendered their lineage cursed with the same lack of intelligence. They were truly lost and would never know what it is that they had lost.\n\nNevertheless, Bjornling knew that he had to push on.

If the night was connected to these phenomena, then the Ursa' weak point might've been found.\n\nHe first demanded a group of changelings to disguise themselves as an Ursa Minor, meant to lull an Ursa Major into a false sense of security. A second team was then provided, a group of shamans given a crash course on modern-day hypnosis techniques to send the Ursa to sleep. Finally, Bjornling assembled a literal dream team, led by more shamans, who consumed a heavy dose of crystals and hallucinogens—all soaked in the energies of a full moon—to enter the dream world and force their will on the Ursa.\n\nBy the time the first Ursa awakened, genetic memories had been re-awakened in her. She had served in Hyperbearia, drawing water and collecting seals during the day while drawing paintings in the starry sky by night. Forgetting her cubs, she was led lumbering out of the cave by now undisguised changelings and shaman hypnotists-dreamers."

Electricity went off, the subjects would faint, other blackouts involved them waking up with smoke and blood embedded in their fur. But finally, something was communicated from the closest thing Bjornling had to a seance fax machine: the well had been reached, and its souls were being drawn, these spirits being funnelled into the physical realm then into Bjornling's self-made portable spirit cauldrons, his own attempts at artificial spirit wells.\n\nThe final step, he imagined as the cryo chamber finally wound down, had many graveyard visits in store for him with these cauldrons in paw."

Soon, the runes appeared to retract from the test subjects, leaving them lifeless. The central bear began to hyperventilate as the last of the runes entered her.

Beyond our northernmost shores, beyond the icy sea they had traveled. So far north they went that their compasses had reversed themselves.

Unfortunately, the lone bear had expired before he could finish explaining what had happened on the journey.\n\nBjornling and his scientists obtained the crate and opened it in a secured environment. Jaws were collectively dropped when they saw its occupant: a skeletal pony. Not mere bones protruding from flesh, but only a skeleton moving around as if it were alive. It didn't seem to be intelligent, as it repeatedly kept trying to leave without responding to questioning.\n\nIt was then that Bjornling had his top bears conduct experiments on the creature.

Regrettably, though, a shouting match then ensued between the resulting Bjornlings.

northern_protectorate.14.d:0 "Paw Wellington: the mercenary come home, the first unifier of the bear lands, the trumpet-bearer of Hyperbearia's return if unwittingly. His intake of much of the greater world was great, and the polar technologies the flame-souls had mistakenly called their own, he brought with much enthusiasm. But Paw was also The Craven Deporter, exiling Tordenstjerne and Rosensverd for their collaboration with changelings when he himself stooped low to fight for griffon pay. The hypocrisy had never truly been forgotten.\n\nThat was what froze Bjornling's forces into a chilling zeal as they stormed Scyfling's fortresses, weathering the shells and shrapnel of Griffonian rifles and cannons. Under the paws of the last panserbjørn, snow turned red with Scyfling blood as, eventually, the straggler were huddled in a final fortress, surrounded. Not wanting to go out dishonourably and so prematurely, the remnants surrendered: their foes had proven their superiority a dozen times over; Scyfling would yield.\n\nYet hours later, when Bjornling ended his rummaging among the rubble of fallen structures, having extracted corpses upon corpses while rounding up the living, an absence unnerved him, if only for a second: Paw's, that old bearded fac. But the roars of his victorious underlings snapped Bjornling out of it—great feasts would be had the next day.\n\nBjornling chuckled at the thought: exiles dining on their former jailers' ice."

By all accounts, the clans of these lands should've banded together: abundant in food and resources, hospitable to both polar spirits and flame-souls, the token effort of a committed clan would unite the region. Yet, divided they remained, contending with each other for nothing more than precious farm and factories. It was a disgrace that needed correction.\n\nThe field of battle was wrinkled by Wesslandia's major griffon population, so changeling corps were called up. It did, though, lead to an unusual scenes: over wildernesses then advancing into more fertile territory, Protectorate changelings and Wesslandian griffons entrenched themselves in the ground for support and logistics while letting the bears duke it out in actual no creatures' land. Anytime one side of bears defeated the other and started mauling the enemy's trenches, it was a sign for the smaller soldiers to turn on the offensive.\n\nBut a hastily made alliance would fall, sooner or later, against the unity of Hyperbearia and a singular breakthrough operation. When the griffons' champions went down fast, the leaders of the Wesslandian clans—Falsen, Brodkorb, and Benkestok—bowed to Bjornling's might. Their somewhat industrial powerhouse stood no chance against Hyperbearia, which now had sole charge of its fecund soil."

With modern theatre, mistakenly "invented" by warm-souls, taking root among the bears, Bjornling hatched an idea.\n\nShortly after Anker surrendered, the news reel reporting on the invasion spread like blizzards: "PENGUINS GLORIOUS IN BATTLE" flash on screen, narrated by Bjornling himself against a background of a Northern Sea littered with grey hulls. For every cannon fired in the movie, a cannon would fire in the theatre, causing earthquakes to maximise immersion, and water would splash with each bob and sway of the boat. This would go on for four in-movie days until Anker's navy cracked. Rifle-axe battles commenced on decks then on Jan Mayen itself, with real-life weapons being fired behind the scenes—and a few bullets aimed just inches away from unflinching audience members. Finally, Anker surrendered, Bjornling shook paws and flippers with their leaders, and the film ended.\n\nAmid the applause, Bjornling himself stood up silently from the front row and bowed. It wasn't necessary for them to know that the battle lasted mere minutes, and without any casualties. Anker simply kept to themselves, after all, seeking only fish. All they needed was protection to live in peace; there was no reason to scoop them up into further shenanigans.\n\nIt was fortunate, then, that the changelings had introduced to his movie crew the power of battleship models and dramatisations."

Scouts had reported Volsungr's strategic targets, and not much else would be needed. Constant barrages, directed by the occasional changeling adviser that knew how to operate these cannons, were enough to silence them.\n\nScarce was Volsungr's activity for hours upon hours, though Bjornling could imagine the many cave-ins he was causing, annihilating precious armour and harmonic "artifacts" to make the way for Hyperbearia.\n\nThe silence finally broke in the form of surrender, though the Volsungr bearer of good news was not the infamous Princess Eira. If the messenger was to be believed, she just fled to repeat her exile further south, no doubt reconsidering her own heritage, perhaps applying either for Yakyakistan or Equestrian citizenship.\n\nBjornling snorted once everything was said.

However, they were blind to the maxim that Hyperbearia blessed all polar souls, not just bears. Torben's wrath against the changelings and their arctic hearts would not do; a mercy to the world it would be to take him out and give his clan a true accounting of Hyperbearia. At cannonpoint.\n\nTreads vanquished hills and mountains strong, snow crunching like nothing while keeping the bears inside under tolerable temperatures, all operated by changelings. Panserbjørn streaked down the slopes to strike, and for a while, the bears outmaneuvered the lumbering vehicles. But the tanks kept coming, the divisions kept pouring in, and Svartpels' strict standards for their elite forces returned to haunt them: in hours, the tanks on the battlefield outnumbered the panserbjørn.\n\nFortress after fortress, stronghold after stronghold fell in just days. There was no surrender; those who could fight roared in violence to their last. The one who got away with dignity, though, was Torben himself: a great thunderstorm raged on, a strange rain that shouldn't have been possible this up north. The tanks weathered the elements, but Torben stood unbreaking, the gale unable to uproot him. "Bjornling, you coward!" he screamed, rising above the ear-splitting storm—all as he set ablaze a dozen tanks by himself, relishing in the inursine throes from their cockpits. "Show yourself! Shall you deny yourself an honourable battle?"\n\nYet as the shells were loaded and aimed at Torben, bolts of lightning circled around him in a dance of collapsing, cracking thunder. He roared unintelligible words—in a flash, he was gone. Left behind nothing."

northern_protectorate.19.d:0 "In a mountain cave, safe against a raging blizzard, Bjornling had gathered the lords of smaller clans and warlords of no clan to listen to his history. By his side, a magi-scribe jotted down every word.\n\nAs he confessed, he hadn't always been this almighty bear that towered over everyone. He'd been named Svíkja, "cheater and defrauder," given by near savage warlords who abandoned their unwanted cubs, that did not fulfil some prophecy, to Clan Rosensverd whose rituals often proved deadly. He endured persistent scorn thanks to his minute size, his name, forcing him to turn to trek far-off mountains and ask shamans why the All Father had treated him this way. But he found his answer in a million-year-old vision: to remember, to realise Hyperbearia against modern weakness.\n\nBut why Hyperbearia, whose name meant, "to ascend bears"? For the modern bear had lost their ancient powers, their ancient ways. Furthermore, changelings were common sights in Rosensverd, wielding futuristic technology, like concepts that survived from bygone eons... that had to be an indication that bear mythology was not fully true. That they were not the only survivors of paradise's fall, descendants of what were once demi-godlike beasts. No wonder the lands of the Eternal South had borne traces of ancient, frozen greatness: the monstrous spirits among them had compensated with minds and actualized as their physical size shrunk. All while bears descended into stagnant barbarism, even if their monstrous size was maintained. The unification of bears by Paw—a fellow bear who'd combined his monstrous prowess with lessons of frozen mind from across the sea – that was ultimate proof. Yet he grew stagnant and was turned upon.\n\nBjornling would not fall for same. If the world would not listen to the echoes of Hyperbearia, he would shove the North's screams down its throat. By rifle, by cannon, by magical ice, the blessed world of frozen monstrousness would be retaken.\n\nThe scribe then stopped."

After getting some reassurance from Bjornling, "Perhaps, when your little... no, when our Hyperbearia is achieved, I may no longer need glasses. We'd have all the machinery and the magic in the world to cure every imperfection... and have a thousand birthdays, never to face the ravages of time."\n\n"But what exactly is time in Hyperbearia?" he asked.

It, at first, seemed easy; he had interacted with the penguins of Clan Anker, and they were an agreeable bunch of cute fisherpenguins.\n\nHe had not asked for a clan of changelings on the other side of the country, but Clan Odonoata soon became his lot, not desiring to anger Bjornling. When he arrived at their settlements, the newness of it was evident: nothing but prefab, concrete, and scraps of abandoned strongholds, with changeling heads and wings poking out of everything. The very creatures they were collaborating with... it was up to him now to lead over their "masters".\n\nHis first week was a mixed bag. Most of them were unfamiliar faces, and it didn't help that those faces shifted—and that they could fly. Still, they were surprisingly co-operative, providing bits and bobbles of their advanced and discovered Hyperbearian technology in exchange for continued obedience and assistance. It wasn't that bad.\n\nBy the end of it, when the lights went out over fresh homes and the smell of good food, Oddmarr felt no oddness about but revelled in his accomplishment. It wasn't 24/7 fighting by body or mind, or the endless work maintaining archives and weapons, like back in Svartpels, but finding polar souls in these creatures might be more enlightening to him than it was to the changelings."

The reward was a life after the Hyperbearian style: a lofty position in the military.\n\nWhen two hundred griffons had been whittled down to twenty and some, he gave them one last test: pure survival. Transported somewhere truly remote and under hidden surveillance, their only mission would be to return to any polar bear village then report to Bjornling. Except, when he woke up from his sleep in an unframed mattress a week ago, he found himself at the edge of the northern coast, freezing. No weapons, no clothes, no tools: only ice, snow, and unforgiving rocky soil.\n\nDays and evenings were marked by wandering, hunkering. A small shrub would always be cherished; he'd debase himself to eating dirt, any minuscule particle that was edible.

Of the pre-natal, larvae are born much earlier yet have already scored 78% higher than ordinary newborns on physical aptitude tests.\n\nAttrition rates for the already-born are at 51%; for the pre-natal, 90%.\n\nConclusion: There is merit in providing thorough muscle therapy to larvae and younger; mental prowess has also increased this way.

Hyperbearians, will you not meet me here and beyond, when the twilight of the fires erodes all else, that Hyperbearia shall withstand the universe's death and endure to another, to birth another reality!?"\n\nA storm rose, one of rocking ovation glimmering with the steel and crystals of self-fashioned axes, as if the snow and ice itself had risen up to embrace their wayward son.\n\nThe sky glittered as if the stars had multiplied, ushering in the hypnotising spirals of aurorae. Bjornling could've sworn that he saw the northern lights morph into the faces of the All-Father, a ghost of a smile upon Him."

Her oddball genius was not to be shunned, and this was her vindication: with the backing of every single bear in existence, from the past to the future, there would arise terror from the skies that none could damage, for it could strike from anywhere, anytime. The only thing the enemy could do was to pray their bunkers were strong enough, condemning their citizens to fiery deaths:\n\nArtillery, strapped on an orbital platform ready for launch. Shamans would commune with the spirits within to calibrate the cannons' aim far faster than any radiowave could run. Unassailable yet everywhere at once, Project White Worm would wash their world in a crescendo of death until the accursed flame-souls would grovel for mercy. \n\n"Lift off is a go!"\n\nFrom the underground, steel doors would open. Months, if not years, of crafting, of doing 90% of the heavy-lifting, then securing bonds and grants from Hyperbearia...\n\n...exploding before it reached the surface, blazing fumes incinerating most of the workforce inside, and no sooner did she wish to disappear into nonbeing. And what was worse, Bjornling had been here the whole time, watching topside with her, an audience to the crispy underground husk that was now the broken cradle of Urðr's worth.\n\n"Ha-ha, this is great!" And Bjornling slapped her on the back then fixed an impromptu medal on her shirt. "Two concepts at once! Orbital death platforms, and a way to kill off underground rebels! Such initiative! Those tunnel networks shall be unfit for our foes now!"\n\nUrðr promptly fainted from confusion."

Bjornling declared in the middle of the plaza. "The might of the bear to the exclusion of our fellow polars was the injustice of many, the butchery of that traitorous Paw. But the definition of the Hyperbearian can expand yet more! What use are all these territories if the flame-soul natives are ineffectual to the vast mine of the arctic experience!? Put aside your biases and your cocooned creature-isms: starting tonight, we shall save both the land and its hearts!"\n\nOn cue, a little pony hopped up to his side, sized like an ant in comparison. Bjornling's handlers then wheelend in an already activated machine, panels magically floating and rotating around its central elevator-esque platform.\n\n"Our Sala-Combinator," Bjornling announced, "snuffs the fire inherent in a flame-soul, leaving behind a space for the primeval nature of the polar to seep in! This pony shall be the first to relinquish her flame for the perpetual gift of the freeze!"\n\nSo, dragged submissively by bear guards, the mare entered the Sala-Combinator, standing on the now-floating platform as her impromptu audience voiced their ear-splitting approval. As the panels spun into blurs, wreathing her in a crystal haze, the cheers would drown out her whimpers.\n\nSnowy tendrils crawled in."

"All this groveling to the changelings, benefiting from Chrysalis's conquests, and killing those who stood in your way... was a front!?"\n\n"I am not proud of my actions," Bjornling replied, his booming voice having scared her earlier in their meeting, "but it is a great challenge to fool shapeshifters. I had a role to play, and I played it to the best of my ability. Believe me, miss, I have had many fallings-out with close friends who were more faithful to the principles of friendship than I was."\n\n"Then why didn't you speak up?" she asked, sincerity in her heart. "What's harmonious about massacres and mass persecutions?"\n\n"Alas, heinous acts are the only things that would appease Chrysalis and her clique," he continued. "With their trust secured, however, we have stolen Hyperbearia's fruits from them, to be used against the polar spirit-traitors. It is a blight on my soul to have been a conduit of the very downfall of our home in eons past, but with our brutal facade unnecessary, there is no need to lie, no need for dishonour."\n\nWith a paw on his chest to answer back with his own sincerity, "Dishonour unlike yours. Your fellow ponies other harmony-minded friends died, and all your press did was emote for the cameras. You could've asked, could've found out what I was up to... but you took the coward's way out and kept quiet."\n\nHis paw poked Bixbite in the chest.\n\n"Didn't you?""

Ever since the Protectorate had become a strangely harmonic Hyperbearia, Bjornling been putting in more work for him "because dictators that do all the work isn't harmony."\n\nIt was imperative that some had to die, but not everyone should. Some names didn't do anything major; they faltered, obeyed under duress. Everyone could agree that Bjornling was harsh, but Chrysalis was careless, tossing out her greatest minds over a minor disagreement. For the sake of practicality, only the worst would be on the chopping block.\n\nBut value was found, too, in a clean sweep. Any material usefulness they'd have would be lost in the deaths of everyone, but a greater trust from the equines could be secured, and for a bunch of flame-soul harmonites like those minuscule ponies, a show of trust and friendship was more important than the wisdom of forgiven and pardoned changelings.\n\nBy the end, the list would be heavily annotated, and Bjornling would follow Skalmir's verdict:"

Next, the ideals of our would-be king Thorax—"\n\n"Deserter!" Ischia yelled, ripping up a map in fake sorrow. "Even if I were a harmonite, why would we fight for him?" Half the attendees rallied with her, explaining why he was a rank recreant who'd rather hide sop up love in the Crystal Empire than die for a good cause. "Tell the ponies that we have harmony, nothing more! Let the ponies taste our brand of harmony!"\n\n"You cannot be serious!" Carapace snapped, taking his pistol out.

When all ammunition vanished, they resorted to hoof-ifcuffs until local bear constables arrived at the scene.

"Once more, it is folly to best the new age's first hyperbear, but it is admirable to hold out against me for so long.

They claimed to have travelled from what had been the Northern Protectorate, a subordinate state to Queen Chrysalis; now, it was Hyperbearia, a nation that espoused harmony all over.\n\nWhile it would be nice to believe them, reports and rumours from those who'd escaped the Protectorate relayed a different tale, one of trials and tribulations, of great national hunts against those that dared stand in [PLB.GetLeader]'s way. This and more were telling stains on their supposedly harmonist track record.\n\nHowever, this Hyperbearian entourage acknowledged the reality of these atrocities; whether or not they were actually a disguise to stay in Chrysalis's good graces until it was the right time to stab her in the back, it was their alibi, along with polar bear culture apparently having been civilly savage since the beginning of time. In the fashion of the Element of Kindness, they asked us for forgiveness, both in writing and in reparations over the coming months and years.\n\nIt was up to [ROOT.GetLeader] to decide. On one hoof, it would be good to expand our front against the changelings and to end the war post-haste. On the other hoof, being so quickly trusting of what may be two-faced creatures would not set a good precedent for our trust in this... Hyperbearia."

northern_protectorate.42.d:0 "Infatuation wafted in the air. While Bjornling would not be wedded to Exuvia, the preparations for the changeling queen's true crowning signalled otherwise. Every inch of Soryth was being mobilised for the celebration: several teams of flower collectors had been sent on their missions, a crude science festival would be held in her honour, and a night of fireworks would end with the unveiling of the crown she'd been forging over the last few months—alleged to have been with the souls of her ancestors.\n\n"What?" could only ask after Skalmir told him of the legalities of Exuvia's queenhood. "Right... you are right, I have forgotten." Exuvia had been vague, maybe on purpose. Her ambitions touched only the scientific realm, not the machinations of the political. In all likelihood, she would be fine with staying a puppet, now that she would have complete reign over her home. Plus, to paw over rulership to Exuvia, without having her fight for it (not that she would: they were—he felt disgusted at the term—the best of friends) was sacrilege that no sane bear would accept.\n\nBut watching over a country was tiring, and Bjornling, for all his strengths, had not been raised a politician. Mechanised spirits had not been invented yet, the type that would fetch him data from every corner of this arctic domain to simplify his decision-making. Governing, for now, in a rapidly expanding nation, rewarded him with more headaches than glories... and with how changelings "grew families", the Hyperbearia's changeling population might be on equal paw-ing with the bears; Exuvia would perhaps better represent the polar spirits.\n\nStill, she would need to know the extent of her rule in a few hours. Doing away with his secretary and planning to meet with his precious Exuvia in person, he had to break the news to her first before starting this happy day:"

Say what they would about bears being raised in an unforgiving, surly climate, who did they think ponies were? Gullible talking crayons? [EQS.GetLeader] had to see it and denounce these duplicitous "harmonists"! But the realities of realpolitik won everyone over, pushed her to say "yes" and "amen" to Bjornling in the face of blinding camera flashes. Bjornling himself relished in his struggle to hold a pony-made ink pen; giggling made the rounds in the crowd, the polite sort that accepted that Bjornling was imperfect and that he enjoyed the humour of being too big in Equestria. It only churned her heart, brought her to seething.\n\n"I would like to thank you for your understanding," Bjornling said once most of the reporters went away, talking to Bixbite now, forcing her to put on a genial demeanour. "We may differ greatly in our views and executions of harmony, but this united diversity is itself a show of harmony. Hail to the marriage between the All Father and your god-princesses."\n\nAn awestruck Bixbite swallowed her emotions and nodded, attempting to shake his oversized paw.

I knew they were stupid, but not THIS stupid! My—no, our plan, with Bjornling had them rally against a common predator like the herd-minded proles they are! Now that they've sided with us, they will not see that their trust... BROKEN! Their faith in harmony, torn apart by a polar-flame hyperwar! Their unenhanced forms will disintegrate under my command!

What about away from battle? You can't be a politician in any government by being as trusting as a strawpony argument. Actually, aren't you being gullible yourself today?" With an ounce of respect, she gestured to the guards who had just detained her.\n\n"You just gloated about your plan to me. And everyone else in earshot."\n\nExuvia flew straight to her muzzle; the bulky difference of her size against her sister's could not be denied. "No one will believe you! We've built this on 'harmony', our reputation IS harmony. They will only say that we are misunderstood."\n\nThough about to start her trip to prison, Ecdysis held her head high.

Great pillars of stone and steel were used to replace the walls that held the second layer, etched with symbols representing bear and changeling cultures before the Chrysalian obsession with Griffonian Herzland. Sculptures of ice representing values of harmony, cooperation, love and brotherhood stood, maintained by Rosensverd mages, who somehow masked their true horrid visages from the world.\n\nTens of thousands of Changelings were herded in and sat down on the countless rows of chairs patiently, too patiently in fact, as if someone had gripped their minds. Then the queens and their families entered, dressed in robes representing their hives and occupied important seats. It was all a farce of course, the queens were as much prisoners as Ecdysis, trialled for imprisonment until death by the "harmonic" courts, now forced into compliance by Bjornling and Carapace. Even now the monsters and their followers were waiting next to the queens, the threat of violence unspoken, but very much felt by those that had seen the beasts beneath the knightly armour and liberation uniforms and mirages. And Ecdysis hoped that the pony representatives would see through the illusion. \n\nYet as Exuvia ascended to the frozen dais dressed in golden starsteel armor and white furs, receiving her silver crown the ponies didn’t notice. When the new "Primordial" queen spoke of a new era of unity between races, harmony with untamed nature, return to uncorrupted cultures and rejection of modern war, the ponies clapped. And when the queens bent their heads in submission, seemingly admitting the superiority of harmony, the Equestrian representatives cried tears of joy.

Spiracle had never heard such claims, when he started his shifts, it was all about greatness of Changelings, then, slightly later, about vengeance against Equestria. Then, for some time, those posters were taken down, the propaganda broadcasts turned off, replaced with ones pushing to work harder to maintain defence against the monstrous bears.

Articles and reports went through rebuilding efforts, Chrysalian guerilla hunt operations, trials of criminals against harmony... However it was not all serious, as several pages covered court gossip and fashion reviews. Yara skimmed those quickly on her way to the back of the newspaper, that‘s where the bear wrestling match results were shown and she had put down a nice sum of bits on some giant savage from the mountains.\n\nAnd then between the pages her eyes fell on an article titled "Is Equestrian Lack of Demilitarization Showing Failure in Harmony? – Army Experts Divided". That was... new? Nothing like that was published before. The article was comprised of several Equus and Griffonian military experts sharing their opinions on Equestrian army and it‘s lack of demilitarization, even in the face of what was essentially continental network of allied regimes. None of them had said anything about what that the Alicorns were planning, but Yara couldn't drop the feeling that this was a danger to the Changelings, a danger to her new prosperity.\n\nSimilar articles would continue appearing day after day, talking about economics, politics, military news... They never said Equestria or Alicorns were the danger, but one couldn't help but feel that they were going act out, lash out... Yara talked about it with her friends, her coworkers, her family and all of them felt the same, as if some "break" was coming, as if ponies were up to something...

Further analysis has given us a key point of information in our endeavors; the existence of a magic mirror, of which legends say exist an entire alternate society to ours. In fact, there were many mirrors leading to dimensions, created before recorded equine history by one of their mages. If this feat can be replicated by them, then it can be replicated by us! We must assign our best shamans to the task of creating mirrors of our own immediately, to bring glory to the soon-interdimensional Hyperbearia!"

northern_protectorate_eqg.2.d:0 "Initial trials into replication of the mirror portals gave the appearence of successes. Though the burden of breaking reality, even in a stable area such as that of a mirror's surface drained even our most talented and powerful shamans, they achieved what was thought to be impossible nevertheless. The mirrors themselves were heavily stylized and ornate, decorated by only the most talented ursine craftsbears to symbolize our great victory over yet more chains that binded us to this reality.\n\nBut while this was indeed a great victory, the rewards reaped from it were quickly proven to fall short of what we had initially imagined. Some dimensions were completely uninhabitable, instantly killing many or even entire teams of ursine explorers with their poison gases, lack of breathable air, or scorching heat. The ones that are not completely hostile to us remain empty, barren wastelands with no native creatures in sight.\n\nThe dimensions rich in resources have been designated for mining operations and will serve Hyperbearia well. Still, it seems that the number of inhabitated dimensions is much lower in number than we first anticipated, and we are currently unable to sustain the production of mirrors necessary for further dimensional exploration. Until a new alternative can be found, we must temporarily close further studies and research in this regard."

northern_protectorate_eqg.3.d:0 "Afkarr was in the middle of nowhere.\n\nHe knew where he was, of course. Deep in the mountains near the hold of Volsungr, on a routine exploratory patrol of the area. Hyperbearia must always be alert, even in its own lands, and Afkarr was one of the many eyes that looked in even the most remote of places. He knew every cliff, every ravine, and every snowbank like the back of his paw.\n\nOr at least, he had. A recent storm had dislodged a large amount of snow he had once thought stable, blocking his usual path. Now he was forced to take an alternate route, a more treacherous crossing across a wide ravine. Afkarr knew that a fall here would mean certain death, and took extra care in the path he took along it on his way to the other side.\n\nIce. A small patch, yet all that was needed for his paw to slip from its place. Afkarr tumbled, reaching his paw out to desperately grab onto something, anything to stop or slow his fall. But the only thing he grabbed was thin air, as the walls of the ravine closed in on him, and the sky grew distant as the howling winds signaled his imminent demise.\n\nAnd then, the world around him exploded into color.\n\nAt first, Afkarr believed that this was death. That this was the world beyond the mortal coil. But when the color faded and his eyes adjusted to the new light, there was something off instead. The skies were blue, the grass green, almost like it was an image from the land of equines. He raised a paw and saw it was no longer one, being replaced with some sort of limb made of skin. His fur had been replaced with clothes, ursine-like in design but still unnatural to him.\n\n"Hey, are you alright?" Afkarr turned his head towards the voice, and saw a purple creature standing over him, looking curiously with her glasses. Her hair was tied up in a ponytail, and she looked strangely familiar. Upon not getting a response, she waved one of her limbs in greeting.\n\n"I'm Twilight Sparkle. What's your name?""

Once we had verified the information to be true, they returned with success beyond our wildest hopes - a world far more advanced than our own, with mysterious bipedal creatures ruling their known planet. Though it seems to have already been extensively influenced by the harmonism of Equestria, including even containing versions of various equine heroes, the potential for this dimension is limitless. We will have to be cautious in not alarming the denizens of our true nature or purpose, due to their equine sympathies, but so far they have been relatively compliant in offering aid towards our expedition.\n\nOur researchers have already begun multiple proposals and operations for using this new opportunity to its fullest for Hyperbearia. It will take the expedition some time to adapt to their transformed nature across the portal, but they are nothing if not resourceful and persistent. Once we have established our foothold there, nothing will be beyond our reach.\n\nFor the glory of Hyperbearia!"

northern_protectorate_eqg.5.t:0 "Those Beyond Our Help"
northern_protectorate_eqg.5.d:0 "One of the few disadvantages that crossing into the alternate dimension brings is the loss of our true ursine forms. Without our superior strength and polar magics, there is little we can do in terms of aggression against the natives of the world, especially due to some of them already harnessing magic brought by the Equestrians. However, our scouts reported great news; upon questioning some students at the local education center, they were informed that polar bears do still exist in the dimension in their true forms. And yet, we were horrified to also hear that they are kept in zoos, cages that keep their true might contained so that the creatures may watch them from safety. The extreme restraint from our expedition in reporting back before engaging in retribution is commendable, as Bjornling was able to formulate a plan to free the brethren from their chains.\n\nUnfortunately, these plans quickly fell apart when confronted with the reality of the situation there. Despite our best efforts to reawaken the intelligence within the native ursines, they remain savage and pre-sapient. Furthermore, our technology does not seem to function when brought over to attempt forced enlightenment, which shamans believe is a result of the lack of polar magics present in the dimension.\n\nAny further serious attempts to engage with the native ursines is likely to arouse suspicion among the natives, leading to the branch of the project being shuttered for now. A possible side operation to reach the ursines said to reside in the far north is undergoing consideration for the far future. Until then, it seems that the brothers across the portal are beyond our reach, and beyond saving."

Bjornling of course, being the ever-great leader he is, immediately ordered for the extraction of said technology to be repurposed here for the glory of Hyperbearia. After all, even if what was found so far was not strictly military in nature, just the study of said objects could advance ursine science by decades, or even a century compared to others on Equus.\n\nHowever, the portal itself seemed to have other ideas in mind. Any attempt to bring back pieces of technology themselves to the primary dimension results in them becoming various useless pieces of old electronic equipment, or antiquated versions of what they once were. Even basic schematics, blueprints that took weeks of preparation and planning to heist in the other dimension, became blurry and unreadable for our scientists here. No matter what was attempted, it seems the magic that connects our dimension to theirs refuses to allow any crossing of anything that could be of real value.\n\nThe back-up plan did not fare much better. The greatest ursine scientists and scholars of this generation, sent to glean as much knowledge as possible from the other side. The electronics they had contained a treasure trove of information, ideas and concepts that could still prove beneficial. But, when our great minds crossed back over to impart their new wisdom upon others, their memories simply became... hazy. No matter how much they were questioned, or what methods were used to jog their memories, they simply could not retain anything of value. Only bits and pieces, elements which serve little use.\n\nDue to these failures, the project has been marked up for termination, effective immediately. The portal is proving itself a blessing and a curse, and not one that Bjornling is seeming to take well. For as we can see our future before our very eyes, the power that is right there for our taking, the portal frustrates our every effort to take until. Until we can learn to modify the magical anomaly, there is nothing more we can accomplish here."

northern_protectorate_eqg.7.d:0 "Once again, our great leader Bjornling has come up with a plan so brilliant, so unorthodox, and so imaginative that it truly is an idea only an ursine such as he could think up.\n\nIt came right as research on portal development was coming to a close, and our expedition team was just about to be called back. The alternate versions of the Equestrian heroes had been studied extensively, and research suggests that their magic comes from the individual geode that each one possesses on their person. They appear to be attuned to the individual bearer, ruling seizing them for our own out of the question. What interested Bjornling more was the widespread popularity and support they gained from their music.\n\nAnd who says we can not take inspiration from success?\n\nThe scientists and scouts have been reassigned back to their normal positions, replaced with only the most talented musicians of Hyperbearia. With the official name 'Truer North', and their official history being a recently formed band specializing in 'heavy metal', we may have finally found our final infiltration into their society. Surprisingly the Equestrian band, the 'Rainbooms', appeared fairly supportive of the idea, offering aid to our own in establishing themselves on the music scene.\n\nThis venture has already proven itself well worth the effort, as the band has become surprisingly popular in the alternate dimension. Even one of the Rainbooms, Fluttershy, has taken an interest in the band and their front of raising funds to 'conserve polar wildlife'. With their support, we will be able to finance Hyperbearia with otherworldly capital, and finally turn this portal into something we ursines can use to our full advantage."

They were guided down the docks and through the city, but when asked, were forbidden from diverting from the predetermined route. They were taken to the former palace, now hung with red and gold banners. Negotiations began and Icebear apparently wished to join the Socialist Union for mutual security and development.

It was hard for him, even with his extremely keen visual senses and hearing, to source the voice out from the many. It was impossible to see any of the individuals in the crowd separate, they merged together like a forest with the roots and branches tangled together.\n\nThat idea, however, sparked an idea in Icebear's mind. While the winds howled through the crowd and flapped the flags behind him his voice once again bellowed with the authority and confidence that drove his charismatic speeches.\n\n"Whatever is needed! It is you, the worker-warriors, that have the honour of doing the labour of the revolution! Our greatness, the greatness of all bears, rests on the shoulders of the many! Your work will be hard, your strength will be tested ceaselessly, but it will prevail for all! You will lead us to greatness with your sweat, your blood, and your conviction. Never lose faith with the revolution. Guided by my paw your strength will lead us to a new society, and we will live in peace and security for all bears!"\n\nThe words of Icebear echoed for a moment. A few less enthusiastic bears, startled by the words, glanced through the crowd. The more enthusiastic and radicalized however were soon to shout and growl their support, and soon the mass itself was energized. Icebear looked upon it all with a brightness in his eyes, and he knew they would die for him.\n\n"Remember the whole, comrades! None are greater than the whole!" Icebear shouted, and capped the speech off with a flourish."

icebear.6.t:0 "The Role of the Elites"
icebear.6.d:0 "It was well known to any of a radical sort that revolution wasn't free. Acting against the state was an expensive affair, and Icebear had known this from the start. The support of the elites would ensure a smoother transition into his ideal vision of a state-self, and so it was that not long after his speech to the clamoring mass of labour he spoke with a quieter voice in a luxurious suite of a hotel for the few foreigners that ventured so far North.\n\nIn attendance were the landed warlords, the elder shamans, and the magi-scribes. They were the elite of society, and they watched eachother with suspicion. As soon as he entered, they quieted and looked to Icebear with clear concern. The status quo was perhaps not great for any of them, but revolution brought it's own worries.\n\n"It is the right of any Ursine to pursue his dreams, isn't it?" Icebear questioned, and leaned against the minibar's counter as he looked to the smattering of well-off bears. "It is my dream to form the D-U-C Polaria, and you can either stand with me and behind me..."\n\nIcebear's claw dug into the counter, and it creaked and snapped under the strength of his muscles and the sharpness of that claw.\n\n"Or you can stand in front of me, and I will bury you under the collective mass of those that would die for me. My dream can be yours, or I can make it your nightmare. I will write your names into history as traitors and enemies of the revolution and any that bare your name will curse you as their forefather..."\n\nIcebear's words had a threatening growl to them, but he followed them with a smile. "Behind me, you can live as spoiled as you are now. So what will be? Shall you give to me what you can, or will I be forced to take it from your estate? Surely wise ursine's such as yourself can make the right decision."\n\nGiven the armed radicals at the door, and the threat lacing every word, Icebear soon earned himself some new 'friends' and benefactors.

At the podium his voice shifted, and his tone lowered.\n\n"It has been asked of me, by respected comrades, why we still struggle despite our victories. Why should we still pour blood, sweat, and tears when we have achieved so much? Should we not rest, and enjoy what we have earned?" Icebear questioned, and let it linger for a moment.\n\n"No!" Icebear shouted, and gripped the podium as he raised his volume to an emboldened cry. "We shall not pause, we shall not stop our great march for even a moment! The struggle of the revolution can never end until we have achieved the true outcome of our new society! We cannot stop to rest, we cannot stop to enjoy our victories, or the capitalists and counter-revolutionaries will subvert our great work! The worker-warriors work must be ceaseless and unyielding! Capitalism and subversion never sleeps, and the worker-warrior must not either! Every bear must march forward without rest, supported by the many, without hesitation! To a greater future, we can never slow!"\n\nFinally, Icebear's voice quieted, and there were only a few moments of silence before there was noise. It started, as always, with the radicals in the crowd and their nearly unhinged shouts of support and praise. They cried out their words and growled their support, and their radicalism spurred others to add their noise. Soon enough, as always, the crowd was united with one word."

He initially saw no reason for concern, but then they began hearing the echoes of snarls and growls carried over by the frigid winds. What had caused these polar bears to posture so aggressively was beyond the changeling's comprehension, but the sighting of a large group approaching his position in the dead of night prompted the lieutenant to radio up the incursion.\n\nInitial attempts to communicate with the wintry bears were immediately met with an assault - one that would end with several of his subordinates severely injured, the polar bears driven back, and the poor lieutenant with desperate questions. What made those polar bears suddenly attack? Neither the changelings nor the polar bears were at war with each other, so were these simply rogue actors? Did he and his subordinates really drive them off? Or were those bears ordered to retreat? Lieutenant Tergum rubbed his forehead.\n\n"Sir," one of his sergeants holding a radio interrupted, "you need to listen to this."\n\nTergum and the sergeant listened to the broadcast coming from Polaria. The voice belonged to the nation's 'illustrious' leader, Chairbear Icebear, and his voice was noticeably rising in temper.

Chairman Icebear couldn't simply be equal to the rank of other legendary military officers like the Hivesmarschall of the Changelings or the Prince-Martial of the Ponies. No, for him he needed something more, something that set him above and beyond all of them. He was, after all, above and beyond all of them. The difference between propaganda and reality had long since blurred in his head, and so as he faced himself in the mirror he spoke simply to the bear dressing his uniform.\n\n"Seven stars," Icebear spoke simply, as he gazed upon his medals and ribbons. "Seven stars..."\n\nSo it was that those simple words led to less than simple work. The power of the centralized institutions that revolved around the Chairbear was immense, and before the day was out a new uniform with a seven-star epaulette had been stitched and decorated. Before the lights of the assembly chamber and the gently humming electronics of the cameras the coat was put over him, and he looked to the stars as if he might be considering conquering them too.\n\n"Let the people know that I, Chairbear Icebear, will always protect them. Through my guidance not the ponies nor the changelings will ever threaten us. Seven stars... is more than six."\n\nSeven stars indeed, and they glittered in the light while the assembly applauded."

It believes itself superior, taking flight to use its seedy eyes and predacious talons sink into the backsides of Polaria's cubs! It is true! A griffon is too cowardly to face the might of even a single worker-warrior of Polaria, and yet it has the audacity to claim what rightfully belongs to us!"\n\nRoars erupted from the crowd from his most devout, and soon the ferocity swept over even the most skeptic of bears.

No longer can we allow these creatures...no, these abominations against birdkind, to taint Polaria's destiny anymore! Shy not from the griffon's insidious leer, but render it with teeth and claws! Cleanse its dangerous, filthy taint from this world so that it may never threaten that which you love ever again! This task rests in your paws, worker-warriors, just as it is to be carried on the backs of everybear!

Memories of not so long ago flashed in the back of Icebear's mind: assessment reports of the landscape, surveys of the terrain and the general population of clanless, and the mobilization of Polaria's forces to rid the settlements of their despicable, feathery squatters.\n\n"Go and select a dwelling, comrade."

He knew he wouldn't see another day afterwards, not another beautiful sunrise or another chilling night lit by the world's aurora lights — but he had since accepted this. He had since accepted this when he first heard the Chairbear's many prejudicial broadcasts against griffonkind and then later heard the whispers of DUC Polaria's secret police conducting roundups. He had since accepted his fate when his own claws desperately dug through meters of desolate snow, only to finally clutched the body of his best owlbear friend amongst the frozen griffon corpses.\n\nThe motorpool finally rounded the corner, and the polar bear's eyes locked onto the Chairbear standing in the passenger seat, obliviously waving and basking in attention. Steadying his glare, the polar bear made his way forward with unbridled fury, shoving through the rowdy attendees as if he wanted the Chairbear to notice him like everybear else.\n\nThe Chairbear's vehicle approached, and the polar bear finally reached the sidewalk barriers. One furious lunge was all it took for a fence to break and spill fanatic ursine.\n\nChairbear Icebear looked on at his stumbling supporters pouring out in amusement, but then his eyes spotted the wrathful polar bear charging.\n\nThe polar bear raised his anti-tank cannon and fired."

Great Raven taught us magic, Gallinbursti the Great Boar taught us metalworking, and Fenrir taught us the hierarchy of the strong. Scyfling was changed by the return of the mercenaries, and the new Scyfling is still finding its place in history.\n\nPaw is a devout bear, but he is also a believer in the value of modernity. He brought home a great battleship with which to threaten the vile Changelings, and his mercenaries were armed with the best Griffonia had to offer. With these weapons and troops, he made preparations to finally unite us under one leader. We Svartpels joined his war, and together all fell before our combined might. Now, he makes yet more changes to our nation in the name of modernity. He has imported rifles from Nova Griffonia to arm our soldiers and tractors from Equestria to aid in the farming of tubers.

But her time in Equestria and the Crystal Empire had left her with a desire to lead the clans towards a harmonist future where the weak are protected instead of exploited, and the strong rule with wisdom and kindness.

But the current three minor clans, Falsen, Brodkorb, and Benkestok, are known to periodically form a defensive pact they call the Triple Alliance. While none of these upstarts could challenge a great clan alone, together they may well be strong enough to outmatch even a great clan if they ever develop ambition for such a feat.\n\nWesslandia is also notable for its great amount of owlbears. Owlbears are, of course, large and strong griffons who have proven themselves in combat against a bear. Wesslandia further has many griffon whelps in servitude to the citizens of the clan, remnants of attempted invasions by griffon adventurers who seem to have believed in a city made of precious crystal within ursine lands. It is without a doubt the most griffonian region of the Communities. Legends have it that millennia ago, true clans known as the Jotnar Monster Kings once ruled over Wesslandia and the lands east of it and that they were expunged from this world by invading forces. If true, ruins of these long gone clans may be found in the Frontier.\n\nIn any case, Wesslandians live among ruins and trash, erecting new fortresses and factories instead of trying to rebuild ruined holds. Paw Wellington's industrial plans have found great success there, but the support of these clans is hardly a glowing endorsement.

The nameless Shaman King of Rozenkrantz is isolationist and cautious, befitting one who can see across the ages. And unconventionally, Gotlung is not ruled by a single elder but by a council of them, which votes on all issues to determine the direction the clan will take, which combined with the mindset of the clan merely leads them to continued fortifications of their lands, rather than direct action.\n\nEach of these clans is small and likely little threat to a Great Clan, but even Svartpels would struggle to outmatch one of these clans in its area of expertise. What their place will be in the future of our race remains uncertain, but should Paw retain them on his side, we are likely to see a good destiny of unbreachable defense and mighty shock troops thundering across the North."

There are many of them, but they tend to be more compliant than the clans, going along with the wishes of whatever ursine rules the region they dwell within and offering services as generals and advisers with little care for ideology or doctrine. These bears are generally spared by the most brutal wars of ursines, which has led some cynics to mutter that no matter who wins wars among ursine kin, the true winners are those without a clan.\n\nThe clanless bears of the Communities and lands nearby are those who were expelled from or never were part of a clan. They usually operate in independent warbands or holds, free from the constraints of a clan's rules yet also devoid of the protection and sense of unity a clan offers. They are brought together by a strong figure, and usually disperse once that figure dies. There are at least a million of them and perhaps more, yet the very sense of individuality that defines them prevents them from ever rising to conquer the clanned bears.\n\nThe nomads, those without a home or a culture, are most concentrated in the Frontier and borderlands of Nova Griffonia, but can be found nearly anywhere across the North. According to legends, they are the descendants of the long-gone Jotnar Monster Kings and direct inheritors of the legacy of pre-clan nomadic monster armies, though if this is true they seem largely unaware of this. One possible exception is the communist revolutionary Icebear, who is generally believed to be a nomad with uncanny intelligence and cunning.\n\nOf the savages of the Changeling Lands, most commonly found in the Northern Saddening Shore and nearby mountains and forests, there is little to say. They live like beasts, mauling and devouring anything they need to survive. Their weapons are primitive and many of them are unable or unwilling to produce armor, relying on magics to coat themselves in layers of ice. While they may be brutes, they are still ursines and we cannot help but feel a kinship to them. Perhaps one day, when the perfidious changelings are defeated and grovel for mercy, we will reunite with our lost kin."

At a young age she was cast out from Clan Volsungr and bear society itself for her ideas aligning with that of the weak ponies from the south, and left for the land of Equestria. She traveled there for many years, studying pony society, culture and their way of life. The knowledge she gained only grew her fascination of Harmony as an ideology, believing that the Equestrian way was not just something for ponies, but also something ursines could achieve as well.\n\nHowever, not everything learned was positive during her time in Equestria. For no matter where she traveled, the signs of the industrial revolution and its consequences presented itself for her to plainly see. Factories overtook nature as ponykind asserted its dominance more and more over the land, sometimes with little regard for the local flora and fauna. The ecologists she did meet gave her hope, however, and she swore to herself that should she ever get the chance, she would ensure that the same would never happen to her bear homeland.\n\nThat chance presented itself with Paw Wellington's return to the North and his takeover of the clans, as her former home of Clan Volsungr was decimated and on the brink of complete collapse. She returned to offer her help to the place that once exiled her, and they were forced to accept, bringing in thousands of former exiles like Eira herself and changing the clan forever. With her new and now popular ideas among the young and even some of the elders, Eira's leadership came swiftly, until the pivotal moment when she was forced to openly fight back against Paw Wellington's leadership.\n\nNow, having become the new unifier of clans, Eira leads polar bears to a newer, Harmonic future, though how that future will look remains to be seen.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Neither"

The North will be reunited in a Third Unification War, the Four Stage Plan will be enacted fully and completely, and all bears will learn to love their Queen and their Lord Protector.\n\nNow that he has secured power, only a rare few have any idea what he plans to do with it, but all know that his reign will be a horrific one, for Bjornling plans to let nothing - not morality, not the clans, not the Equestrians, not even the laws of reality itself - stand in the way of his dream.\n\nBy bullet, napalm, and gas, Hyperbearia will be restored. No matter the cost.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Neither"
POLITICS_PWELLINGTON_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: October 10th, 959, Mathair Fearainn\n\n§YBiography§!: Paw Wellington has been many things in his life: wanderer, mercenary, unifier, and now despot. He fought in the Republican Revolution as a mercenary, where his warband distinguished themselves with excellent combat performance, if somewhat tainted by political unreliability and looting. When time came for his payment, his employers lacked the funds to pay him, so they gave him an ancient battleship, which sparked his long-running interest in the navy.\n\nPaw led the Unification Wars from 1000 to 1002, where he exiled the clans of Rosensverd and Tordenstjerne and subjugated the rest. For the past five years, he has tried to modernize society, purchasing rifles from Nova Griffonia and attempting to form a truly united polar bear nation. By foreign standards, he is a firm but fair ruler, interested in the well-being of the polar bear race as a whole. But by polar bear standards, he has been a mad tyrant making absurd demands of the clans, who are rapidly getting sick of his inept pretentiousness and ridiculous ambitions. In his own mind, he feels he is ineffective and not powerful enough. Grover I, Grover II, and Kemerskai tolerated no defiance. Why should he?\n\nWith his five-year anniversary of rulership approaching, only time will tell how he fares in the changing situation on Equus.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Kessel"

The mightiest warrior in the entire Polar Bear Communities, he is also a brilliant scholar and historian. But this fails to understand the vital link between his mind and his body. He perfects the physical to nurture his mind, and perfects the intellectual to guide his body. He has devoted his life to studying the past and ensuring it is upheld in the present. He clashed with the Wesslandians and Old Clan Volsungr, before they fell to harmonist weakness. He battled raiders from the Frontier who came seeking a mythical city of gold. And he was the first to join Paw Wellington in the First Unification Wars, and stood by him until changeling subversion welcomed exiles home.\n\nHe cares deeply for tradition and history, and it is this passion that drove him to rise from warrior to Thunder Lord to leader of the clan and now the entire polar bear race. He dreams of the entire North united, with the perfidious changelings punished for the countless crimes they have committed and the imperialist griffons shown their place. With all the polar bears now under his guidance, such dreams may be within reach.\n\nThe bears will retake their lost lands and restore their honor. All their enemies will be defeated and punished.

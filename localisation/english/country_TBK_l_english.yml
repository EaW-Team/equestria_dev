### Starting Tree ###

TBK_art_of_the_deal: "The Art Of The Deal"
TBK_art_of_the_deal_desc: "Some ponies would consider the finest art to be the graceful brushstrokes that inhabit a painter's canvas, or maybe the soothing harmonies that fill the walls of a concert hall with on performance night; but for arms dealers Pea Shooter and Vasile cel Tradat, there is no greater art in the world than the art of the deal."

TBK_facade_of_democracy: "The Facade Of Democracy"
TBK_facade_of_democracy_desc: "It's an open secret in Tobuck that the government and its stated "democracy" are just an elaborate sham to garner support from nations like Maregypt, when in reality much of the country is governed by authoritarian warlords, and democratically elected officials have little power."

TBK_grease_the_wheel: "Greasing The Wheel Of Democracy"
TBK_grease_the_wheel_desc: "Even though the elected government holds little power, simply subverting them by use of force would be inexcusable in both the eyes of the people and friendly regimes; as such it sometimes requires a little bit of bribery and blackmail to convince government bureaucrats to sign off on risky legislature, and smile while doing it."

TBK_convincing_legislature: "Pass The Home Act"
TBK_convincing_legislature_desc: "The republic is nothing if not cooperative, especially regarding the Zarantians. It's only fair, and practical of course, to allow for the free movement of peoples over the Tobuckian-Zarantian border; with a little luck, this should keep the tribes off of our backs for a while longer too."

TBK_expand_republican_guard: "Expand Guard Jurisdiction"
TBK_expand_republican_guard_desc: "If the events of the past few months have proven anything, it's that we must allow the national guard jurisdiction over the movement of peoples. We must keep the Zarantian intellectuals in the city, and of course make sure that the warlords remain blissfully ignorant for a little longer."

TBK_nascent_bureaucracy: "Clean The House"
TBK_nascent_bureaucracy_desc: "The time has come to tidy up around the edges and make doubly sure that nothing compromising leaks out about our little game. It might increase the workload for the state bureaucrats that are trustworthy just a little, but that's a horseshoe they'll simply have to wear. Sometimes a little encouragement is unfortunately necessary."

TBK_hope_tobuck: "Three Hurrahs For Tobuck"
TBK_hope_tobuck_desc: "A little glimmer of hope, no matter how far-off the end goal is or how misplaced that hope may be, is still something that can be utilized for the benefit of our little operation. The people must believe in the republic to make the most of the state structure it provides and so they shall, however briefly."

TBK_meet_giggle_juice: "The Loveable Drunk"
TBK_meet_giggle_juice_desc: "While effectively a puppet, one of the most important ponies in Tobuck's democracy is a pony named Giggle Juice. A drunkard who lacks actual power, but makes up for it with an abundance of charisma; he's a popular figurehead in the eyes of many, and his support is paramount to maintaining the facade of Democracy."

TBK_parlay_vasile: "Erstwhile Partner"
TBK_parlay_vasile_desc: "Ah, Vasile; a griffon as capable of holding a genuine conversation with someone as he is with robbing any poor creature blind on the spot. We would do well to reaffirm our ties with him as he has other plans for this city, though he knows little of it. Perhaps he may even help us unknowingly!"

TBK_zarantia_peace_speech: "Peace and Prosperity"
TBK_zarantia_peace_speech_desc: "Giggle Juice recently came to us with an idea for giving a speech on coexistence and cooperation with the Zarantians, even suggesting that we invite their tribal leader if she's interested. Let us arrange for this plan of his to forward; even if our neighbours don't accept, our people will appreciate the gesture."

TBK_early_pay_day: "Their Pay Day"
TBK_early_pay_day_desc: "After thoroughly touching base with everypony that props up our make-believe democracy, it's time for them to reap the benefits of their loyalty. After all, we want it to be pretty clear that allegiance is an investment that pays dividends."

TBK_our_pay_day: "Our Pay Day"
TBK_our_pay_day_desc: "The rules have been set, the sellers regulated and the offshore accounts maintained. We're fit to rake in cash for as long as our supply lasts, come Tatarus or high water."

TBK_thanks_for_bits: "Goodbye, And Thanks For The Bits"
TBK_thanks_for_bits_desc: "We've finished up earlier than expected, much to the imminent delight of that tribal queen. Well, better be off whilst the going's good as they say; there's no point in delaying our stay in Tobuck any further than necessary. The climate was far from enjoyable and the politics will not be missed."

TBK_pr_campaign: "To The Citizens Of Tobuck!"
TBK_pr_campaign_desc: "There are few things more effective than propaganda these days, but we prefer to call that sort of project a 'media campaign' when we take it to the public. Whatever the case, calming the people and the soldiers in the warlord armies is a logical step in ensuring the stability of the state for the moment."

TBK_please_listen: "Do Not Believe Their Lies!"
TBK_please_listen_desc: "It seems that our previous efforts, though extensive, simply weren't enough to sufficiently quell popular discontent and the army remains sceptical. We'll simply have to make their other sources of information entirely invalid then! We'll make sure that they don't trust anypony but us when it comes to the media!"

TBK_to_each_their_game: "To Each Their Game"
TBK_to_each_their_game_desc: "A free market is good for business, but there is a such thing as it being too free. With a little bookkeeping and regulation we can ensure that only loyal liaisons and captains are shipping our guns around, and that none of them are sold to local warlords that could try to muscle in on the trade."

TBK_checking_the_supply: "Checking The Supply"
TBK_checking_the_supply_desc: "Given how messy things currently are in the weapon-selling department, we would do well to streamline the process somewhat. With a little estimation on our part, a few approximations from the warehouse workers and a healthy dose of paperwork it should become much easier to maintain and utilise the stores."

TBK_quality_products: "Quality Products"
TBK_quality_products_desc: "One of the most important things an arms dealer maintains is his reputation. Sell defective arms to a customer one too many times and you may as well consider yourself out of a job. On the other hoof, certain firearms are precisely hunted for their qualities, whenever exceptional or historical. It'd be a waste to sell them off to a common buyer and leave a wealthy patron miffed."

TBK_business_of_gun_running: "The Business Of Gun Running"
TBK_business_of_gun_running_desc: "Arms trafficking is the bread and butter of Tobuck. It's why the government was founded, how it's funded, why its leaders even care, and ultimately the glue that binds Tobuckian society together. On top of all that, it makes us extremely rich!"

TBK_meeting_the_banker: "Meeting With The Banker"
TBK_meeting_the_banker_desc: "One of the most important part of Tobuck's gun trade is offshore bank accounts; Tobuck is not a state with a stable economy. Storing our accumulated wealth in local banks is just asking for it to be lost with the next financial crisis, which is why it's important to regularly meet with overseas bankers to maintain foreign accounts."

TBK_performance_review: "Performance Review"
TBK_performance_review_desc: "With ample use of auditors and statisticians, we can actually get to the business of determining if all of our hard work has actually paid off in the end, or if we've just wasted our time with bad business."

TBK_streamlined_procurement: "Streamlined Procurement"
TBK_streamlined_procurement_desc: "To be blunt, we need to speed things up a little. What we have in place works, but it doesn't work nearly well enough to last. Though it will pain the coffers to do so, it's important that we increase the number of working personnel on the weapon stockpiles and begin properly managing the warehouses that we keep them in."

TBK_eye_on_warlords: "The Three Warlords"
TBK_eye_on_warlords_desc: "Though the warlords guarantee our safety from outside forces, they also present the most significant security threat. If they were to discover the deal then they would quickly become hostile and would certainly have the military capacity to take over for themselves. We must watch our backs, wait and play along."

TBK_celebrate_military_success: "Celebrate Military Success"
TBK_celebrate_military_success_desc: "As Wallnut Drive would say, there's nothing like a party to remind yourself why it is that you do what you do. Though they haven't done much recently, the warlords would very much enjoy some shipments of various foodstuffs and booze to keep themselves occupied until we're ready to get out."

TBK_rules_gun_running: "The Rules Of Good Business"
TBK_rules_gun_running_desc: "When it comes to gun running there are some things you should always do and others that would probably get you killed if you were to have a go at them. These rules must be followed to a tee, unless we plan on ending up ousted like the Zarantians. If nothing else, the threat of retrospective irony is simply too great."

TBK_first_rule: "First Rule"
TBK_first_rule_desc: "First rule is to never get shot with your own merchandise. Sell it unloaded, and sell it to people way out of killing range. Wallnut Drive is a true oddball compared to the other warlords, someone who seems to find new ways to break guns and expend ammunition."

TBK_tricky_thestral: "The Tricky Thestral"
TBK_tricky_thestral_desc: "Wallnut Drive is not the smartest bat, but he has a way of showing up just when you don't need him to. If given the right incentives, he'll cause enough chaos and confusion on his own that the others won't realize the game until it's already up."

TBK_second_rule: "Second Rule"
TBK_second_rule_desc: "Second rule is to never pick up arms with your customers. Baragzen, the snobby Warzenan noble, has far greater ambitions than any other warlord in Tobuck, only outmatched by his boorish smugness. But passion like his, if harnessed well, makes for a good tool."

TBK_exiled_royal: "The Exiled Royal"
TBK_exiled_royal_desc: "Baragzen sees Tobuck as just a stepping stone to future conquests. Let him think that way. We'll give him some extra guns and tell him the other warlords are looking to muscle in on his territory, and he'll keep them off our backs."

TBK_third_rule: "Third Rule"
TBK_third_rule_desc: "Third rule is to always ensure you have a foolproof way of getting paid, preferably in advance. If you don't have a guaranteed way to get your cash in the end, the deal isn't worth it. Alesia Snezhnaya is a smart mare and careful with her goods. But give her a good deal and she'll make a good business partner."

TBK_white_severyana: "The White Severyanian"
TBK_white_severyana_desc: "Alesia Snezhnaya is dogged and determined, but thinks linearly. If we hoof her some extra troops and tell her to fortify the border, she'll be too busy scrupulously digging trenches to snoop around."

TBK_failure_operation: "Erstwhile Operation"
TBK_failure_operation_desc: "Desperate times call for desperate measures, so the media says at least. The warlords have been encouraged to launch an operation against Chiropterra, working off of entirely falsified reports of a weak border presence there. Knowing their drive for loot, they'll likely commit fully to the attack and need to reoperate afterwards."

TBK_provoke_battles: "Tobuckian Standoff"
TBK_provoke_battles_desc: "We're in a position now where we can encourage the warlords to fight one another, if only to give us a little more time. Pea has dirt on all three of the big equines that should be just enough to get them into a scuffle, we'll just have to make sure that they don't start sniffing around once the damage is done."

### Vasile tree

TBK_vasile_start: "To Save The Republic"
TBK_vasile_start_desc: "Well that was a mess. Pea's off. Zarantia's angrier than they ever have been and the warlords are running amok in the countryside. But while you can see some smugglers running to the ships in Tobuck's harbour, there is a griff in the presidential palace who still sees an opportunity. After all, who better to thrive in chaos than a Brodfeldian?"

TBK_take_loans: "Grovel For Loans"
TBK_take_loans_desc: "Pea drained the whole treasury dry to fund his escape. Whatever he made it out with is gone and so is the rest. At this point, we'll have to bite the bullet and borrow at loan shark rates but it beats austerity. Nothing is more unstable than corrupt civil servants getting told to make do with less."

TBK_crash_cuts: "Crash Cuts"
TBK_crash_cuts_desc: "Whoever said that you have to spend money to make money was not in the gun running business. While you can haggle with some ponies, you can't expect to go far with the loan shark breathing down your neck. Anyway, everypony takes a squeeze and be a little patient. If you want guarantees and security, go plant potatoes!"

TBK_support_zarantian_businesses: "Entice The Zarantians"
TBK_support_zarantian_businesses_desc: "Throughout Pea's regime, we took very little care in giving a reason for the Zarantian-aligned families not to hate us. Considering Pea's end game, it was no surprise but Vasile had nonetheless made some business overtures. By reaching out, we could build a relationship off of that. And once we're in, we can work things out."

TBK_blame_pea: "Everything Is Pea's Fault!"
TBK_blame_pea_desc: "Pea Shooter was a fantastic gun smuggler but he really mucked it up for the rest of us. We'll be lucky if we manage to really turn things around. Luckily, the Tobuckians feel the same way. So we might as well pin everything on him. He's far away and not planning to come back. He'll understand. Probably."

TBK_blame_giggle: "And Giggle's Too!"
TBK_blame_giggle_desc: "Giggle Juice was an amazing tool for a while when Pea's crew was still getting money and some good partying was enough to smooth the edges. But now, we're going to go through a rough patch and nothing gets on the nerves of everypony than a drunk who can't get up before noon. Time to sober up."

TBK_vasile_president: "Emergency Elections"
TBK_vasile_president_desc: "For all of its short history, the Republic of Tobuck never made good on its promise of organising elections. So let's. We'll have to be quick about it so no opposition can organise. Also, we'll need to raid the pantries to buy votes with something else than money. Hey you! Want a pound of flour in exchange for a vote?"

TBK_restore_legitimacy: "Bring Back Stability"
TBK_restore_legitimacy_desc: "For a little while, we have been able to keep the rowdiest elements of our mercenaries and smugglers in check. Now, they're running wild and anypony turning to the state needs to pay up to even get listened to. It's time to bring back some order and show them that maybe there's hope under the striped flag. At the very least, it'll buy us time to figure things out."

TBK_reform_and_expand_republican_guard: "Arm The Republican Guard"
TBK_reform_and_expand_republican_guard_desc: "The Republican Guard has never been much more than a ponyguard force dedicated to prevent the warlords from bullying the capital itself. It is time to give them the tools to do more and actually stand up to the warlords when the time is right. We have the guns. Time to give them to the right ponies this time around."

TBK_keep_some_servants: "Keep Some Bureaucrats"
TBK_keep_some_servants_desc: "Vasile and Pea paid a whole lot of ponies throughout their partnership. Sadly, both indulged in some favoritism, especially when Pea's plan became clear. The people wants corrupt heads to fall. Might as well give them what they want with Pea's loyalists and make sure we get to keep the loyal ones who know what they're doing."

TBK_cull_civil_servants: "Sweep The Slate Clean"
TBK_cull_civil_servants_desc: "For all its usefulness for our business venture, the corrupt apparel of state was a really nothing more than a temporary boon. It's a rotten base for anything long-term. We need to remove all of the corrupt civil servants and make sure those with real inside knowledge shut up permanently. Plus, this will be a wonderful opportunity to garner good among the people."

TBK_fight_warlords: "Act Swiftly And Fiercely"
TBK_fight_warlords_desc: "It's been months now that the three idiots and other new wannabe idiots have been ducking it out in the countryside to be in a prime position to take Tobuck. In a way, they made our job for us. Time to go out and mop them up before the bats or Zarantians get the idea of doing it first. Citizens, to arms! Or something like that. We're learning."

TBK_vasile_inaguration_speech: "Father Of The Fatherland"
TBK_vasile_inaguration_speech_desc: "The votes have been counted and the elected parliament of Tobuck can finally gather. Thanks to our diligence, it's only a formality and Vasile cel Tradat shall be confirmed as president of the Republic. It's time to address the people. Fear not, little foals of Tobuck. Vasile's here. And he'll take good care of you. We promise."

TBK_legimate_republic: "Republic Of The People"
TBK_legimate_republic_desc: "You know what? If we are to make this republican thing work, we might as well walk the walk. Well. Up to a point. But still, we can find a way to make things work for the people and for us. In addition, it would finally allow us to make good on our plan to give us a presentable facade for the harmonic and established powers. After all, all facades are better with an actual building behind it."

TBK_presidential_authority: "Cement Presidential Authority"
TBK_presidential_authority_desc: "If there's one thing that Pea's dominance in the republic did, it was prove that the president needs more power. Quite frankly it's a miracle that he managed all of that as the foreign minister, but that's just why the president needs to have the authority over the rest of the government."

TBK_retain_trusted_mercenaries: "Retain Old Partners"
TBK_retain_trusted_mercenaries_desc: "The warlords sure were a difficult bunch, but the only reason they could try to contest republican rule was because Pea let them. Now that they're no longer a threat, it's high time that we hired what remains of their skilled personel and integrated them into the army proper. Waste not, want not!"

TBK_mercenary_agency: "The Private Law"
TBK_mercenary_agency_desc: "What our republic needs is security, first and foremost. If we're going to avoid another Pea Shooter, we need a new organisation capable of internal review that can finally secure the state from profiteers both internal and external. Well, so long as Vasile's name doesn't come up anywhere of course."

TBK_useful_prisons: "Prison Employment Bill"
TBK_useful_prisons_desc: "Some say that prison inmates are a drain on society, and the President agrees! We can't just have them sitting in a cell, doing nothing but taking money from the state only to return to crime when they leave. Instead we should put them to work, give them some skills for the future and earn some money for our efforts in the process."

TBK_fake_corruption_cleaning: "Opponents Of Corruption"
TBK_fake_corruption_cleaning_desc: "Corruption is the enemy of any great state, almost destroying our beloved republic once before. Though it may result in some of our political opponents disappearing, it's a necessary evil to ensure that whatever despicable elements of administrative malpractice remain get stuffed for good!"

TBK_republic_president: "The Three Reforms"
TBK_republic_president_desc: "The president is powerful, sure; but they aren't as powerful as the office could be. Maybe even not as powerful as the office should be. Well, if there's anything that'll turn Tobuck into a proper nation state it's nationalism, populism and just a little sprinkle of extended presidential authority. Call it authoritarianism, if you like."

TBK_revise_laws: "Lex Vasile"
TBK_revise_laws_desc: "Streamlining is a dull but necessary affair for the long-term functionality of any developing administration. Far from the frankly decrepit system that previously allowed rot and grime to fester in the workings of the state, the reforms introduced by Vasile cel Tradat has made introducing alterations to the functionality of the civil service much simpler."

TBK_buy_zarantian_nobles: "Liberties Of The Traditional Caste"
TBK_buy_zarantian_nobles_desc: "Though many Tobuckian urbanites fail to realise it, Zarantians still make up a considerable minority of the republican citizenry. We will not forget their many trials and tribulations in the turbulent founding of our great nation, and in return for this recognition they will openly cooperate and contribute tenfold!"

TBK_i_am_tobuck: "I Am Tobuckian"
TBK_i_am_tobuck_desc: "For most nations, the Storm King and his march across Zebrica are responsible for destruction and death. The same is true of Tobuck; but - and perhaps more importantly - his brief reign and occupation was what created our republic. We are a people born in the fires of war and suffering, but for all that we have an identity. Or, shall we say, a new idenity."

TBK_old_culture_new_republic: "Ancient Culture\nPreservation Act"
TBK_old_culture_new_republic_desc: "Though not responsible for the creation of our capital or the wealth of our nation, the Zarantians are nevertheless an integral part of our little republic. Their way of life has seeped deeply into the Tobuckian identity and we should strive to protect the culture that they cherish, painful for the state coffers as it may be."

TBK_warzena_referendum: "The Miharzehir Referendum"
TBK_warzena_referendum_desc: "The little strip of land we Tobuckians call Miharzehir has long been claimed by the Warzenans to be an occupied territory. Vasile is of the opinion that what happened under the storm king should stay buried with that old yeti, but if those zebras want a referendum... Oh, then they will have their 'free and fair' vote for who the land goes to."

TBK_neighbours_diplomacy: "Present Good Front"
TBK_neighbours_diplomacy_desc: "We're nothing if not an accepting bunch, us Tobuckians. We don't care what ideology you subscribe to, what faith you may be a part of or where you live; if you've got something to offer us, we have plenty to offer you. So, why not come on down and take in the sights in our little corner of Zebrica? There's something here for everyone."

TBK_warzena_relations: "Care For a Drink, Warzena?"
TBK_warzena_relations_desc: "Warzena has historically never been a particularly close friend of Tobuck, but we live in the present rather than the past. We would do well to shake and make up, maybe even put our weight behind a defensive pact to reassure them of our good intentions. It's just not good business to push potential partners away!"

TBK_zarantia_relations: "How About It, Zarantia?"
TBK_zarantia_relations_desc: "Tobuck's mere existence is somewhat of an insult to the Zarantians, which makes cosying up to them both difficult and desirable. We would do well to normalise relations and get back on speaking terms, maybe even put our weight behind a defensive pact to reassure them of our good intentions. It's just not good smart to say no to potential friends!"

TBK_free_trade_deal: "Tobuck-Agzhat Trade Territory" ### Cut Content
TBK_free_trade_deal_desc: "TODO"

TBK_populist_president: "Most Beloved President"
TBK_populist_president_desc: "If there's one thing every creature can get behind, it's a charismatic and lovable president with a few good war speeches up their sleeve! Sure it's mostly their job to work in peacetime, but you only fail to prepare for a war once. Long live the republic! Long live Tobuck! Hail to the President!"

TBK_hidden_claws: "Keep Talons Sharp"
TBK_hidden_claws_desc: "War is an unfortunate necessity when it comes to the security of our beloved republic, something only proven by Chiropterra's invasion. If we wish for the republic to persist beyond the purview of a couple decades, we would do well to retain a permanent state of partial military readiness. The early bird gets the seeds, dont'cha know."

TBK_open_benevolence: "Altruistic Pragmatism"
TBK_open_benevolence_desc: "War is an unfortunate necessity when it comes to the security of our beloved republic, something only proven by Chiropterra's invasion. Contrary to popular belief however, it's not war itself that kills a nation; it's the occupation that inevitably follows such a conflict that does it. If Tobuck is to survive, we'll have to collaborate."

TBK_finish_reforms: "Conclude The Reforms"
TBK_finish_reforms_desc: "Well isn't Vasile popular all of a sudden? We could never have seen this coming, truly. The president's position of power is now secure and his policies in government have never looked more promising and profitable. Tobuck really is a nation now, a republic with a president and an identity to call their own. Not half bad for a griffon, eh?"

TBK_state_public_works: "State Employment Scheme"
TBK_state_public_works_desc: "Who says the state can't help the people? We can provide jobs for any creature that comes our way looking for work, and make sure that we profit as much as they do! It's a win-win situation for everyone and the Republic will prosper. It's all about return on investment, something which Vasile understands very well indeed."

TBK_form_republic_party: "Traditional-Center Party"
TBK_form_republic_party_desc: "It's high time we moved away from the relic that was the Tobuck National Alliance. Its name and its history with Pea Shooter is an insult to the very fabric of our republic and its principles. With a little rebranding and some tender loving care, we can reform and rebuild it from the ground up into the Traditional-Center Party."

TBK_permanent_congress: "Honour The Congress"
TBK_permanent_congress_desc: "Pea Shooter ensured that the National Congress was a sham right up to the very top, but if we're doing things properly now that can no longer be the case. We have to make sure the opposition gets the fill, albeit at the cost of some political support. Fair's fair and walking the walk means fulfilling our promises."

TBK_dominate_politics: "Don't Be A Fool,\nVote For TCP!"
TBK_dominate_politics_desc: "Our rebranding and reshuffling has certainly done the trick, but it also hasn't made sure we get elected when voting comes around. It's time for the republic to have its first genuine PR campaign and Vasile is setting out to make the TCP look as personable as possible. Who doesn't love a good load of charisma in their politicians?"

TBK_for_the_average_citizen: "Party Of The Poor And Downtrodden"
TBK_for_the_average_citizen_desc: "Much like stocks, charity is an investment as much as it is a PR stunt. With the TCP on the campaign trail, making sure their incumbency does a good job or protecting the money of the voting base is not only a great choice for the future of the republic but is also a fantastic opportunity to get some smiles from the poor."

TBK_poor_healthcare: "Soup And Vaccines"
TBK_poor_healthcare_desc: "Though far from what many have described as a enabling state, it's important that the government provides some things for the lowest of the low in our beloved republic. Caring for the poor will help them rise from the gutter and contribute to society at large, albeit at a minor input cost for the administration."

TBK_land_reform: "How One Can Be A Citizen Without Land?"
TBK_land_reform_desc: "We've done a lot for the average republican citizen, but thus far the matter of land ownership has been entirely absent from our political discussions. This isn't because we aren't sure what to do about it of course, in fact the opposite is true. Every Tobuckian citizen deserves their own plot of land to truly be a part of our great nation!"

TBK_school_system: "People's School"
TBK_school_system_desc: "What little Tobuck has of a state education system is mostly a remnant of the temple school system that was popular during the era of the Warzenan occupation. Now however, with modern technologies requiring modern education and modern specialists, the time has come give our ponies a proper set of schools to attend."

TBK_yale_of_south: "The Yale Of The South"
TBK_yale_of_south_desc: "Though Tobuck has little in the way of scholarly traditions, that doesn't mean our beloved republic is incapable of starting one. In fact, we can do it right now with a new university. Technically it's a reconstructed industrial district, but it's kitted out with all the new-fangled bits and bobs that could possibly be needed for teaching!"

TBK_trial_former_pea_people: "Crimes Of Pea Shooter"
TBK_trial_former_pea_people_desc: "Pea Shooter was a great many things to a great many creatures. For Vasile he could even have been considered a friend, at least before his great betrayal anyway. Nevertheless, it's high time we put pen to paper and organised a proper trial for the pony's crimes. No stone left unturned, no stooge left unprosecuted. Well, none but one."

TBK_controlled_harmonic_opposition: "Most Honoured Opposition"
TBK_controlled_harmonic_opposition_desc: "Pea Shooter shunned almost all potential opposition to his iron-hoofed rule of Tobuck, quashing any potential dissent that could have ruined his meticulous plans. Now however, as we go from walking the walk to strutting our stuff, we must officially recognise the opposition here as an integral part of our republic."

TBK_republic_fake_liberty: "Virtues Of Liberty"
TBK_republic_fake_liberty_desc: "Tobuck has always yearned to be free and its citizens have consistently fought to maintain that freedom. Values of liberty and of the right to self-determination have made our nation what it is today, republic and all. Tobuck shall live on, now and forever, for the freedoms of its people and with the will to protect them."

TBK_house_of_trade: "Home Of Trade And Commerce"
TBK_house_of_trade_desc: "Ever since its founding by the hooves the Maregyptians all those centuries ago, Tobuck's location at the shallowest point in such a convenient bay has made it the ideal location to participate in trade. Though far from Maregyptian now, nothing would suit the city more than to return to its former trading glory; for prosperity and profit!"

TBK_look_at_tourism: "Ideas Of Tourism"
TBK_look_at_tourism_desc: "Tobuck is a beautiful place, and if our republic doesn't interest any tourists then the places they can visit around Tobuck certainly will! Whatever the case may be, our beloved city has plenty to offer visitors from abroad even as a holiday destination. Come on down to bay and soak it all in!"

TBK_tobuckian_boulevards: "Authentic Tobuck Boulevards"
TBK_tobuckian_boulevards_desc: "If there's one thing that picks up tourists like flies to a fruitbowl, it's making everything look as pretty as can be. Sure we'll have to clear up some unused city plots and maybe rapidly reduce the homeless population to do it, but who's gonna care? Bring on the Boulevards, bring on industry and progress for the republic."

TBK_commercial_airlines: "Aero Tobuck"
TBK_commercial_airlines_desc: "If you're thinking of coming down to Tobuck, why not fly down on our new civilian airline Aero Tobuck? We've got great prices and great survival rates in spite of the fact that most of the planes are converted bombers. Get the whole package deal for you and your family; tickets will be gone quick, so don't miss them!"

TBK_recreational_drugs: "Recreational Drugs"
TBK_recreational_drugs_desc: "Recreational drugs are somewhat of a touchy subject all around the world, but - being nothing if not a heaven for those that desire more personal freedoms - our republic is far from restrictive. Here you may indulge in whatever narcotics you please, so long as you buy them from state monopolies of course."

TBK_sign_of_freedom: "Light One Up For Freedom"
TBK_sign_of_freedom_desc: "If they're going to have a smoke - and statistically speaking, many of our citizens will - then they can get their cigarettes and other similar goods from any state-approved store. The administration has nicknamed the brand 'republic cigs' which makes a lot of sense, considering how much of their cost goes into state coffers."

TBK_industrial_plans: "Modern Industry, Modern Republic"
TBK_industrial_plans_desc: "You can't have a modern nation without the industry and technology to go with it, either for the general wealth of society or for the state coffers. It's another case of return on investment; buy a lot of things for the working class to use, let the tech proliferate and soon enough you have an industrial revolution on your claws!"

TBK_wineries: "Famed Winehills Of Zufra"
TBK_wineries_desc: "Though Zufra is more known for its industry these days, it does have a small local tradition of booze-making in the areas that are a little more fertile. Needless to say that we can do a lot with such a niche consumer item, not least for a little state sponsorship and a good advertising campaign."

TBK_expertise_abroad: "Equestrian Industrialists"
TBK_expertise_abroad_desc: "Equestria is home to some of the most famed industrialists the world has ever seen and it would be prudent of us to hire whichever specialists are looking for jobs. Sure it might cause a hassle for some local job markets across the pond, but nobody else will notice. That's just the free market at work!"

TBK_local_industrial_plants: "Manuafacturing Hubs"
TBK_local_industrial_plants_desc: "Given that industries tend to function best when compartmentalised into specialist areas, it stands to reason that creating hubs for certain industries where many plants and factories may work together will substantially boost industrial efficiency and growth. With a little luck, they won't even notice a small corporate tax hike."

TBK_heavy_arms_industries: "The Grand Arsenals"
TBK_heavy_arms_industries_desc: "If there's one thing that Chiropterra's invasion has proven, it's that the state needs bigger guns and it needs a lot of them at that. It's high time we invested in some new stores, ones that won't be sold off by opportunistic Equestrians looking to make a quick bit. Ones that will defend the citizens of the republic!"

TBK_new_industrial_techniques: "Technical Marvels"
TBK_new_industrial_techniques_desc: "Over here in Tobuck, we're not just capable of making money and doing the very basic parts of industrial growth like city planning and district zoning. No no, we can do far more than that. The engineers we've hired and the dreams of the republican citizens will live on in our miraculous feats of technological prowess!"

TBK_resource_potentials: "Riches of North Zebrica"
TBK_resource_potentials_desc: "You know why the mining industry needs? Machines. Just like every other part of Tobuck's well-oiled industry, we've got to get this stuff up to date if we want to compete in the ever-expanding resource market. Vasile has fortunately been able to supply the state with much of the required technology, just don't ask where he got it."

TBK_skyfallian_bankers: "Skyfallian Bankers"
TBK_skyfallian_bankers_desc: "Skyfall is known for three things: Wealth, corporations and banks. We want to make use of the latter of those three things ourselves and for it the administration has begun seeking out potential bankers from their ranks. Of course, their pay will be high and the restrictions on banking activities will have even less meaning in our beloved republic."

TBK_bank_secrecy: "Bank Secrecies"
TBK_bank_secrecy_desc: "If we're going to have big banks making big deals in our big economy, we're going to need to make sure they have a right to privacy. After all, that's something our citizens are privileged enough to get; so corporations should have such as well. What's all this about insider trading anyway? Can't be that bad, surely."

TBK_official_bribes: "What's Wrong With a Bribe?"
TBK_official_bribes_desc: "Bribes are always bad when they benefit an individual alone. But, when they benefit both the state and the individual that leads the state, then that's much more redeemable; right? Well, it's not as if there's anyone to stop us. Vasile's just doing what's best for everyone, whilst stuffing his pockets of course."

TBK_free_expert_imigration: "To Begin Again"
TBK_free_expert_imigration_desc: "You know what'd be real helpful? Inviting foreign exiles to help run the show. As if Vasile wasn't enough talent for us, it stands to reason that hiring skilled foreigners at every opportunity would be a most ingenious solution to any possible issues that may arise with our ever-growing industry and economy as a whole. More personnel just means more knowhow!"

TBK_restart_dockyards: "Renew The Ports"
TBK_restart_dockyards_desc: "If we want to regain our place in the sun as a naval trading power, it'd be best if we started shining up the ports and their facilities. Being able to repair convoys is well and good, but not being able to protect them with a flotilla makes said repairs far more time consuming and less efficient. Think of the trade!"

TBK_refit_ships: "Patch The Boats"
TBK_refit_ships_desc: "Well there's not a lot we can do given that we're starting from the ground up, but for now a few minor modifications to existing ship designs will suffice. Small ships make for excellent convoy escorts and the administration seems to think they'll do the job, now we just have to make sure we don't run into any powerful navies on the high seas."

TBK_coastal_defences: "Defend Our Shores"
TBK_coastal_defences_desc: "To be blunt, investing in the Tobuckian navy - if our merchant fleet can even be called a navy - is a pointless endeavour. We would be throwing money at a project which, even if successful, would only create a small selection of ships to fight off the warships of developed navies. We should just use the money to defend the coasts and our stores, right?"

TBK_free_port: "Free Port Of Tobuck"
TBK_free_port_desc: "Tobuck has been called the city of broken dreams, a title granted after every neighbouring power that attempted to occupy the city failed and withered. But we, we've managed something that nobody else has. We've turned it into a bustling hub of trade, travel and tourism. It isn't Manehattan, but maybe it'll get there; someday."

TBK_shore_up_defences: "Sign The National Defence Bill"
TBK_shore_up_defences_desc: "For a while, the warlords formed a fine line of defense. Enough well-armed crazies to make our neighbours think twice about grabbing the big prize. But now, we'll have to provide for our own defense to fend off any attackers. Vasile has the will to do it. But how to go about it? That is the million bit question."

TBK_raise_extra_troops: "Call Upon The People"
TBK_raise_extra_troops_desc: "With the promise of a more respectable republic, we can start recruiting among the general population without fear of angering our military leaders. With a decent pay, we can even hope that enough will answer the call to fill up our ranks. It'll take time of course to build a standing army capable of defending Tobuck but it'll be ours. Plus, we know how to find enough guns to make even the lowest recruit a threat."

TBK_rally_front: "Together For Victory!"
TBK_rally_front_desc: "Gone are the days of the warlords and mercenaries. You won't be fighting so Pea Shooter can loot you for longer but for a square deal. Everypony gets their share. We're fighting for our homes and our families. This is Tobuck and it is not for sale! So gather around and grab a gun."

TBK_bat_forts: "The Western Trenches"
TBK_bat_forts_desc: "Chief among our threatening neighbours stands Chiropterra in the west. With Wallnut Drive's luck and tactics gone, we need to find new ways to counter them. Fortunately, we do have some veterans whose experience we can use. But considering the size of Tobuck, we have no other choice than to dig and entrench ourselves to start. Here's a shovel."

TBK_bat_defence: "Together Against the Bat Menace"
TBK_bat_defence_desc: "You know what's worse than smugglers, warlords and corruption? Bats. They're crazy, they're evil and they hate anything even remotely pleasurable. It's been a thousand years and they're still not over their insane alicorn mother issues. They'll ban sunlight and ask you to thank them for it. So choose wisely. Choose the lesser evil. Choose Tobuck."

TBK_hire_additional_mercs: "Hire The Band Of Flayers"
TBK_hire_additional_mercs_desc: "We need forces loyal to the new republic in order to stabilize our still fragile rule, and to get the Chiropterrans off our backs. While we want to phase out the use of mercenaries and warlords eventually, we need to bring in some new muscle to keep the peace. The barbaric "Band of Flayers" and their fearsome reputation, including rumors of skinning victims, will be the perfect force to scare those fanatics off."

TBK_use_merc_experiences: "Utilize Mercenary Experiences"
TBK_use_merc_experiences_desc: "You know what's great about mercenaries? They know how to kill things. They'll tell you about it. The important thing is to discard the moral quandaries and take the free lesson. So as long as we're hiring them, we might as well put them to good use. Now if only they would pick up after themselves."

TBK_criminal_republic: "Republic Of Riches"
TBK_criminal_republic_desc: "All the way back when the striped flag was raised over Tobuck, Vasile felt in his bones that this was a good hustle. Not in the way Pea had envisioned. We need not steal everything that isn't nailed down. Rather, we can milk this republic. Politics can be a racket just as much as war is. Time to do some... career reorientation."

TBK_criminal_ministry: "Ministry Of Merchants And Corporations"
TBK_criminal_ministry_desc: "You know what, if we're going to make the state into another tool to be exploited, we might as well provide some decent avenues for those that seek to profit from it. Let's make a 'ministry' to enable folks with cash to get a head start in the game; it'll help us keep track of all the numbers too, which is a nice bonus."

TBK_skyfall_treaty: "Deal Between Griffs"
TBK_skyfall_treaty_desc: "Vasile is a griffon and, though skyfall is relatively tolerant of other races, his word can go for extra when it matters most; not least for the many important connections that he's made there. With a little luck, the President can make good use of his repute to strike some profitable deals in all the right places."

TBK_criminal_economics: "Tools Of Economic Miracle"
TBK_criminal_economics_desc: "If there was ever a time to codify and solidify shady business practices, it's now right? Pea's gone, the warlords are far from our problem now and it's not like the public is going to try and stop us. Here's to the new republic! Here's to wealth beyond our wildest dreams! Here's to the president and his racket!"

TBK_free_recreational_laws: "Right Of Consumption"
TBK_free_recreational_laws_desc: "Every creature in Tobuck should have the right to eat, drink, smoke, snort or inject whatever the tartarus they want. Who are we to deny the public a good time? Even if we wanted to, they're buying product from the state monopolies; it's a win-win situation! Get up, get down; so long as you can get by, right?"

TBK_free_drugs_hard: "Huff And Puff, Give Me That Stuff!"
TBK_free_drugs_hard_desc: "As if our consumption laws weren't already good enough, now we've got a whole range of cigarettes for the public to indulge in. You've got all different kinds of flavours, lengths and even nicotine contents! By the tenth packet all you'll be able to think about is how long it'll be until your next smoke break!"

TBK_drug_monopoly_enforcement: "State Guaranteed Satisfaction"
TBK_drug_monopoly_enforcement_desc: "Y'know, there are two ways to make statistics look good; well three if you count lying about the numbers, but two if you ignore that. One can either make the product so good that nobody dislikes it, or one can simply eliminate everyone that proclaims your stuff is bad. We're gonna take the latter option, since it sends a message."

TBK_drug_facilities: "Heroes Take Heroic!"
TBK_drug_facilities_desc: "Frankly, no creature alive knows what's in those tonics. Even the ponies that know Vasile are fairly sure that he doesn't know himself, but if you were to say as much then things would get ugly and fast. All the same they do have a rather... unique effect on consumers; though it's hard to notice beyond the addictive qualities of whatever the substance is."

TBK_vasile_breezies: "Vasile's Breezies"
TBK_vasile_breezies_desc: "If there's anything that can get a griffon the information he needs in a nation of coldhearted stallions, it's a few fine looking mares with the will and the means to get what they want. Sure it'll cost a lot to set up and trying to train them without having the plan discovered could be problematic, but tartarus if it isn't a good idea."

TBK_culture_wars: "Godfather Of Culture"
TBK_culture_wars_desc: "What's a president without a public image? What's a public image without a collective public to take that image and identify with it? Our president has done far more for our little republic than many may realise, but one thing's for sure: Vasile is the epitome of what folks these days call 'Tobuckian' culture, from the largest of details to the smallest."

TBK_free_gambling_hard: "Your Turn To Roll"
TBK_free_gambling_hard_desc: "There's something special about the rush any creature can get from a game of chance with stakes, whether it's money or specific items up for grabs. You can't get that feeling anywhere besides a casino, so come on down and try your luck against the President. After all, gambling's just a part of who we are."

TBK_modern_paradise: "Tobuck: Where All Your Pleasures Await"
TBK_modern_paradise_desc: "Whatever creatures might want, the republic has it all and more. We have the best of the best, no matter what you could be thinking of to ask if we have it. Tobuck is far from just a rump state, it's a place where dreams come true for those who are willing to take a little risk. Come on down and try your luck, maybe a couple equines'll get lucky."

TBK_state_casinoes: "Viva Las Tobuck!"
TBK_state_casinoes_desc: "Spin the wheel, take a chance. You could lose everything, or get back whatever you have tenfold. Come on down the Tobuck where we have the nicest ponies, the best bars and the most enjoyable of casinos. You may clock out, but once you're here you'll never truly leave; either hooked on the thrill or crippled by debt."

TBK_tobuck_fake_bit: "The Tobuck Bit"
TBK_tobuck_fake_bit_desc: "The great thing about having your own currency is that you can control how much of it circulates at any one time, which is useful under almost every circumstance. For our 'beloved' president, it means he can stock up the vaults at any time he pleases and manipulate the value of our currency to no end; should it suit the interests of the republic."

TBK_check_our_assets: "Evaluate All Assets"
TBK_check_our_assets_desc: "Given that Pea Shooter kindly left behind all his documentation regarding the functions of his little system and the economy of the state in general, it's no surprise that we can take a wrench to the whole place and tune up the state a little. Censuses and boring paperwork ahoy! At least Vasile doesn't have to deal with it all."

TBK_urban_trade: "The Wonderful Cities"
TBK_urban_trade_desc: "Sure we've had to sweep the streets a little and push the steadily growing slums to the back end of the city, but the fact remains that we have plots of land to fill with beautiful industry. Now yes, the buildings around and about were tall in comparison, but folks always needed new land; right?"

TBK_big_dockyards: "Best Port In Zebrica"
TBK_big_dockyards_desc: "Tobuck has been called the city of broken dreams, a title granted after every neighbouring power that attempted to occupy the city failed and withered. But we, we've managed something that nobody else has. We've turned it into a smuggler's paradise with all of our hard work.Time to give them places to repair their ships!"

TBK_rural_trade: "The Serene Lands"
TBK_rural_trade_desc: "There are a couple different ways to evict folks, but there's one that stands above the rest. It's high time we used just a little force to reclaim some of this worthless farmland and turn it into something a little more worthwhile. We don't live in a world of subsistence farming anymore, this is a modern criminal state!"

TBK_horrible_fields: "Clue's In the Name"
TBK_horrible_fields_desc: "Well if you're going to keep to farming, you might as well do it right and do it by growing a whole lot of drugs. We aren't gonna force you to grow something you smoke or inhale, but you're not going to make a whole lot of money doing anything else are you? Best just to go with the flow and start making your keep!"

TBK_horrible_mines: "Sometimes You've Just Gotta Sweat"
TBK_horrible_mines_desc: "If there's one thing that Tobuckians are good at, it's a hard day's work in the factories of our beloved capital city. Stands to reason that we should go in for more workplaces, given that there always seems to be more ponies to work. Say, when was the last health inspection? Oh, that's right! We don't have any!"

TBK_mandatory_employement: "Outlaw Unemployment"
TBK_mandatory_employement_desc: "You know what'd be a great idea for keeping creatures in their workplaces? Outlawing unemployment entirely! They can't complain about not having jobs if they're in jail, and when they're in jail then they can just work for the state for free! Vasile's such a smart cookie when it comes to this sort of thing."

TBK_unstoppable_development: "Dreams of Elysium"
TBK_unstoppable_development_desc: "Out here in Tobuck, your safety from the forces of 'law and order' are always guaranteed; but right now it's pretty hard to actually protect some folks from morality and safe decision making. Well, it's high time we put an end to that; we have to dream big out here in our little corner of Zebrica. We have to dream of an Elysium for all!"

TBK_secure_presidency: "I Am The President-Boss"
TBK_secure_presidency_desc: "If Vasile's position as president wasn't already secure, now he'll be untouchable as both the big boss and the legally elected bigwig about town. Come one, come all; pay your respects to the overseer of the greatest operation to ever sink their claws into a state! The fun is only just beginning, after all."

TBK_mercenary_security: "Private State-Security"
TBK_mercenary_security_desc: "If there's one thing we need more of in this backwater, it's security. Chiropterra didn't play nice with us and neither will any other force of law and order, if they want to try and mosey on into our beloved republic. What better way to kill two equines with one giant rock than to invest into a state protection racket? They're like police, just with better pay!"

TBK_electoral_control: "You Are Fired"
TBK_electoral_control_desc: "A big question on the mind of the big boss is whether or not to allow for bribes, and he's finally come to a conclusion on the matter. Unfortunately for everyone that's offered him cash for ignorance thus far, Vasile needs a loyal crew of politicians and gangsters if things are going to stay in his claws. Bye-bye money, hello stability!"

TBK_internalized_corruption: "I Love Bribes"
TBK_internalized_corruption_desc: "A big question on the mind of the big boss is whether or not to allow for bribes, and he's finally come to a conclusion on the matter. Fortunately for everyone that's offered him cash for ignorance thus far, Vasile doesn't need anything besides a cash injection to look the other way. Bye-bye stability, hello money!"

TBK_what_is_this_republic: "What Is This Republic?"
TBK_what_is_this_republic_desc: "Since its founding, many have been left to wonder what this republic is all about. Of course, the answer to that is easy. It's a state of crooks, cronies and of the worst creatures in the world that could possibly come together in one place; but that's what makes us free! Money maketh the griff, but it also makes a republic!"

TBK_defame_harmonists: "To Whom Does Success Belong To?"
TBK_defame_harmonists_desc: "Success belongs to whoever is willing to take it for themselves, which makes the Harmonic Front a bunch of weaklings destined for failure. After all, if they can hardly save themselves then how are they supposed to live here with the rest of us? Time to put an end to their ridiculous party and get some things done with utter impunity."

TBK_simple_question: "I Am Vasile Tradat And I Have A Simple Question"
TBK_simple_question_desc: "If you want your liberties and freedoms, you gotta work for them. We don't live in an 'enabling state' or any of that modern tosh, you have to enable yourself if you want to get anywhere in this cutthroat world. After all, if you don't get what you want in the way you want it; someone else is going to take it from you instead."

TBK_corrupted_liberty: "Republic Of Free Choice"
TBK_corrupted_liberty_desc: "In our little corner of Zebrica, you can do whatever you want to do and be whoever you want to be. You can also choose what nationality you identify with most. At gunpoint. With the state protection rackets looming over you. Well, you get the picture; you're free to do whatever you want, as long as it doesn't get in our way."

TBK_maintain_some_old_mercs: "Bygones Be Bygones"
TBK_maintain_some_old_mercs_desc: "The warlords certainly weren't a perfect bunch, but they had some things going for them at least; in fact their modus operandi is arguably very similar to that of the republic. We would do well to welcome the remnants and bring in whatever skilled personnel they have left, re-hire all the smart ones for ourselves y'know?"

TBK_new_goons: "Fresh Underlings"
TBK_new_goons_desc: "If we're wiping the state- sorry, the slate clean; we might as well do it right this time. Let's get ourselves some new blood for the national guard, some folks that won't want to turn around and shoot back at us if we leave them to their own devices. Never another period of warlord anarchy for our beloved republic!"

TBK_congress_showdown: "Executive Order 13"
TBK_congress_showdown_desc: "We've been pretty lenient with the public in the past, but the fact of the matter is that they need to understand who's in charge. Sure they can still have a vote or two here and there, but Vasile's staying and so is his crew. It's time to bring the hammer down and take out whatever dissidents we can find."

TBK_pocket_politicians: "Pocket Politicians"
TBK_pocket_politicians_desc: "Politicians are almost a relic now, given that they have such a limited reach on their own; but with Vasile's guidance... Well what the President-Boss wants, the President-Boss gets. If you want to get anywhere in the republic, you go through him first. After all, he can take it all away in an instant if you're up to no good."

TBK_pragmatic_advisors: "Pragmatism Has Its Merits"
TBK_pragmatic_advisors_desc: "Some folks say that republics are supposed to serve the citizenry, but we disagree with that sentiment in a number of ways. First amongst them is that the President-Boss is the undisputed king of the republic and everyone serves him first, themselves second. By extension that means the citizens work for the state, not the other way around."

TBK_peas_shadow: "Shadow of the Great Gunrunner" ### Cut Content
TBK_peas_shadow_desc: "TODO"

TBK_whip_mobs: "Control The Mobs"
TBK_whip_mobs_desc: "Though some may disagree, the solution to many problems in life and statecraft is to simply use force. Vasile understands this very well indeed and has authorised the use of extreme force to clamp down on whatever protests and movements that the state considers to be a little too dangerous for their own good."

TBK_let_loose_pea: "Let Them Loose"
TBK_let_loose_pea_desc: "Hey, what are we doing trying to just beat the mobs up a little? Why don't we give them some guns and tell them to get going on whatever little acts of vengeance they seek to make? With that Vasile might even be able to quietly exert some influence and get them to listen to what the state has to say. Give them a target and they'll shoot, right?"

TBK_criminal_diplomacy: "Ahoy There, Neighbours!" ### Cut Content
TBK_criminal_diplomacy_desc: "Our history with Warzena and Zarantia hasn't exactly been positive, but who cares about the past? We live in the present and money is more important than whatever history you might have that says otherwise. We should shake appendages with our neighbours, make them feel at home before we infest their countries with 'crime'."

TBK_dictator_vasile: "Saving The Republic"
TBK_dictator_vasile_desc: "Enough is enough. It's time to step in and exert a little 'absolute authority' on these idiots that think they can get away with straying from our perfect republican values. The President-Boss isn't a king by name, but he should sure have the means and the ends to shape the republic down to its very core."

TBK_sell_idea: "The Greatest Virtue Of All"
TBK_sell_idea_desc: "Austerity isn't necessarily a good thing, but with the government in its current state all it means is being a little responsible with our money for a while. A little investment in the right places, some cleanup around the right blocks and voila; you'd never even know the Storm King invaded this place a little while back!"

TBK_decry_regulations: "Fair-Trade Is Unnatural"
TBK_decry_regulations_desc: "Nobody would deny the simple truth that is the system of free trade. Connectivity is an integral part of any creature's psyche and it's also how we spread our influence abroad with money and sales! It would simply be foolish to do anything else; let's make sure that nothing can interdict a flow of free trade, shall we?"

TBK_everypony_rich: "Everypony Can Be Rich!"
TBK_everypony_rich_desc: "Part of what makes our mindset great is that anyone can rise to the top, or fall to the bottom. You truly have to work in order to get where you want to go in our republic; dreams alone are for dead creatures and the failings of lesser systems. Make work, do work and earn your keep; or suffer in silence for your laziness."

TBK_settled_oligarchy: "But Only Few Are Ultra-Rich"
TBK_settled_oligarchy_desc: "As high as even the most talented of businessponies may climb, there's always a limit before the sky. Nobody will ever be as wealthy as the President-Boss and his close associates; though maybe if you took a moment to try and get in with him, you might become one of the chosen few. Best get working for it, huh?"

Well, actually it's always this time if you really take a moment to think about it, but right now especially it's time to make a whole lot of money. How you may ask? Well, the President-Boss has his ways, he has his friends and he has the establishment. Best you don't find out how they operate together."

TBK_criminal_taxation: "The Organisation Tax"
TBK_criminal_taxation_desc: "You could call it a corporate tax if you like, but that wouldn't quite be accurate. It's more like paying for the right to organise in any capacity, even for something as small as a shop on a high street or a party with friends. You don't want to disobey the law and not pay your taxes, do you? It might get real ugly, real fast."

TBK_hierarchy_of_bribes: "Hierarchy Of Bribes"
TBK_hierarchy_of_bribes_desc: "If you want to talk to the top, you've got to talk - or pay, really - through every layer of underlings before the very peak of Tobuckian politics. Nobody speaks to the President-Boss without the sayso of his loyal goons, or their loyal goons, or the loyal goons of the loyal goons of the loyal goons. You get the gist."

TBK_vasile_schools: "Vasile's School For Gifted Foals"
TBK_vasile_schools_desc: "Though technically a state school, Vasile's School For Gifted Foals is more like a private enterprise in and of itself; where those with money put their smart kids to get smarter. You know what they say about society, the rich get richer by enabling one another; and we'd be fools to say otherwise. Come to school, if you have the money!"

TBK_criminal_universities: "The ABC Of Business"
TBK_criminal_universities_desc: "You know what'd be smart? Teaching our little 'uns how to do business in this scary world of ours. If they want to make it big, they're gonna need to do things right and innovate in an already ever-changing market of ideas and rackets. Here's to hoping they can pay off the debts of their parents too!"

TBK_vasile_economic_empire: "Tradat Incorporated"
TBK_vasile_economic_empire_desc: "You know what's better than being the head of a state? Being the head of a state and having a corporation of your own that's so deeply entwined in the budget creation of that state that you can never be thrown out. The idea almost brought a tear to the President-Boss' eyes, or at least we have to assume it did. A rumour like that could have you shot."

TBK_vasile_gun_industry: ".303 Tradat Caliber"
TBK_vasile_gun_industry_desc: "What better than to start a weapons manufacturing company when you're at the top of your game? Sure it might not be the most orthodox of businesses, but then neither is the republic! Let's get out there and make some firearms, some bullets and get onto the range with some business partners, eh?"

TBK_keep_workers_loyal: "Enrich Local Customers"
TBK_keep_workers_loyal_desc: "You know what, why don't we give our citizens a little privilege for their dutiful service to the President-Boss? Any Tobuckian can now get goods on the cheap; so long as they're purchasing them from us.\n\nWhat do you mean you can just buy citizenship? Oh we did do that didn't we, I guess it's just more money for everyone then; right?"

### Post-Chiropterra War Legimate tree

TBK_vasile_post_bat_legimate: "Our Triumphant Republic"
TBK_vasile_post_bat_legimate_desc: "It's over. The bats are in disarray and Vasile stands triumphant, our president-conqueror. In just a few years, we transformed a fake republic into a model for Zebrica, a profitable democracy, and now, we'll do it again for the fanatics! We're not the emotional type but it does bring a tear to your eye. Take that Kemerskai!"

TBK_bat_break_faith: "What Did Wallnut Say Again?"
TBK_bat_break_faith_desc: "From the beginning, we've had a window, if a bit of a foggy one, into how Chiropterra operates and what we've seen is not pretty. And that's us saying that so you catch the drift. If left alone, the madness will bite us in the tail. We need to neuter the Moonspeaker operation and make sure that from this day forward, they'll be shooting blanks even on a full moon!"

TBK_bat_leave_mommy_issues_be: "Just... Leave Faith Be"
TBK_bat_leave_mommy_issues_be_desc: "Look. They've been weird about it for a thousand years so maybe it's better that we just find a way to accommodate it all. Maybe teach them a few lessons about healthy management of expectations and pick up something like painting. We'll just make sure the Moonspeakers don't get too murderous. That'll be a start."

TBK_bat_peaceful: "Chill And Eat Mangoes"
TBK_bat_peaceful_desc: "Religion is obviously a root issue of why Chiropterra acted the way it did. However, we can't just ignore the result of a millennia of cultural stiffness. We need to sell to the bats the idea that there is more to life than war and moon, that they can just have fun. And we know a thing or two about how to sell something to a pony."

TBK_bat_moneys: "Tributes Of The Moon"
TBK_bat_moneys_desc: "The Chiropterra war has been a costly endeavour and they've long caused untold sorrow and property damages. It's high time that they start paying reparations to those they've harmed. Well, to us for a start. Let's not upset the hierarchy of creditors. We don't forget our brave veterans or those who provided them with the tools of war."

TBK_bat_determine_guilt: "Guilty, Not Guilty..."
TBK_bat_determine_guilt_desc: "Throughout its history, Chiropterra has committed so much crime it's not even funny anymore. And that's just according to their archives. So if we want to make sure the angry victims are calmed down, we'll need to go through all of it and figure out who gets a bullet, a cell, a ticket to wherever or slapped with a fine and hoof so we can call it a day."

TBK_bat_old_stooges_new_management: "Old System, New Management"
TBK_bat_old_stooges_new_management_desc: "Look, Canterlot wasn't built in a day and we don't have a millennia on our hooves. We barely managed to build a republic once and that was without a cult to deal with. So we'll do the best thing a good leader can do: passing the buck! Er, I mean delegate to the right ponies and let them figure all that stuff out. They'll manage."

TBK_bat_democracy: "Traditional-Moon Party"
TBK_bat_democracy_desc: "Look, we know. But that one has been such a winning brand, we can't just go and not use it. In all honesty, the TMP has a nice ring to it and they need some reassurance that no, we're not trying to besiege the gates of the moon. Also, they're paying us anyway so we might as well give them a little something for all the royalties we're getting."

TBK_bat_chiropterra_republic: "New Lunar Republic"
TBK_bat_chiropterra_republic_desc: "President Vasile never meant to conquer and occupy foreign land, merely to liberate them and put an end to a criminal regime. Now, the new and improved Lunar Republic stands proud in Chiropterra, ready to engage with the world in good faith and absolutely no trace of terrorism. Ain't that swell? Why is there somepony wheezing in the back?"

TBK_vasile_popular_autocracy: "Vasile The Victorious"
TBK_vasile_popular_autocracy_desc: "As the sun rises over the dank Chiropterran hills, president Vasile stands alone and victorious and yet, some still have some doubts about him. Why? Hasn't he achieved the impossible? We have had so much success it's starting to get physically painful. Especially for our enemies. Poor them. So let's party. Lack of gratitude is best handled the morning after."

TBK_centralize_presidency: "One And Only President"
TBK_centralize_presidency_desc: "The road to our current success was a bumpy ones, with all kinds of needs to compromise, play nice and prove ourselves. Well, we've proven ourselves and it is high time that ponies stop pretending like president Vasile doesn't deserve his place. How about you all prove yourselves to him? What have you ever done for Tobuck?!"

TBK_who_saved_you: "Who Saved You?"
TBK_who_saved_you_desc: "We've spend so much time fighting for our lives that we have not really told the story of how it all went down. But in the end. Where was Tobuck when president Vasile took over? Surrounded by bloodthirsty enemies, torn apart by warlords and looted by a criminal. So ask yourselves, all the critics, how did we get here from there?"

TBK_who_made_you_wealthy: "Who Made You Rich?"
TBK_who_made_you_wealthy_desc: "It is true that Tobuck has always been well-developed, but that wealth was always built on playing second fiddle for foreign rulers by families with little pride in their own people. So what did the Brodfeldian do? He did not export the wealth, he expanded it right here. He made Tobuck rich on its own terms and it's all trickling down back to you all."

TBK_sideline_harmonists: "What's Good In Friendship?"
TBK_sideline_harmonists_desc: "What did the harmonists ever do for you? Did they feed you when you were hungry? Did they stand against Chiropterra when they loomed over us? Did they provide you with jobs? No. All they do is chatter and bicker about the right of law. Well, the law says Vasile cel Tradat is the president of the republic and the law is right."

TBK_i_am_republic: "I Am The Republic"
TBK_i_am_republic_desc: "There, we said our piece and we're not hearing any retort. This concludes our national debate. So if you didn't pay attention, here's the main takeaway. This Republic rests upon the president's mighty shoulders and you all better be afraid of what would happen if Vasile cel Tradat ever shrugged! Thanks for listening and get back to work."

TBK_symbols_presidency: "Idol Of The Republic"
TBK_symbols_presidency_desc: "A great problem in Tobuck is that it never had a real story of its own, symbols or a mythology to explain why it is so great. In a way, it lacks a brand. And who better than president Vasile to be the face of it? So let's codify the presidency and elevate his game changing achievements. We'll call it all Vasilism. Sure rhymes with patriotism."

TBK_final_arbitrator: "Now You Sit And\n Listen To Me"
TBK_final_arbitrator_desc: "We've had to compromise way too much for too little gain during the early years of the presidency. We let the opposition in parliament and the media sling dirt at anypony. But in the end, it was our great president Vasile who lead us to victory and prosperity. So let's cut to the chase and listen. You all might learn a thing or two!"

TBK_supreme_protector: "Hear My Pledge"
TBK_supreme_protector_desc: "The candidate is chosen and Vasile's place in Tobuck's national myth is enshrined. So it may be time for the president to address the nation and to explain what his role is. That of a father, a father who knows that it's time for his little foals to spread their wings, to trot out of the nest and fly into the sunset. Ok, we'll keep working on that but the gist is there."

TBK_prime_minister_idea: "Perhaps I Work Too Much?"
TBK_prime_minister_idea_desc: "You know what? One can in fact suffer from success. There is something about open leadership that just drains you. Perhaps it's time to look for an heir. Well, at least a new face to throw at the press so the president can focus on the good thing in life: prestige, money and business. Preferably all at once."

TBK_perfect_servant: "My Most Loyal Aide"
TBK_perfect_servant_desc: "Vasile cel Tradat has been a great president and achieved much. Nopony can deny that, especially not the one who wrote it all down. So who better to take the reins than his secretary? Bean Counter, the shy little pony who crunched the numbers for so many reforms. The good thing is that he's used to taking orders so he'll do great."

TBK_establish_office_prime_minister: "Congratulations\nPrime Minister!"
TBK_establish_office_prime_minister_desc: "Now that we've done some spring cleaning, it's high time to make things official. So congratulations, Bean Counter! You are now the head of government, serving at the president's leisure and responsible before parliament. And if it doesn't work out, Vasile will dismiss and replace him. That's how it works in a democracy, right? "

TBK_democratic_principles: "Soul Of The State"
TBK_democratic_principles_desc: "Tobuck is a republic but it's always been run on promises and Vasile's careful maneuvering. However, it's not enough to walk the walk, the people wants to hear the right words too. So it's time to enshrine the principles of liberty and democracy within our constitution. With some guardrails of course. Don't want the crazies storming into office, now do we?"

TBK_tcp_supremacy: "Forwards Tobuck, Follow The TCP!"
TBK_tcp_supremacy_desc: "Vasile has done a lot for the nation but in truth, it was always a team effort. And that team is the Traditional Center Party. The TCP stands for liberty, for democracy, for prosperity and for victory! Bean Counter is the party chancellor and Vasile cel Tradat its esteemed founder! So get in or get lost! Er, I mean, get in for Tobuck! Hurray."

TBK_tcp_propaganda: "There Is No Tobuck Without The TCP!"
TBK_tcp_propaganda_desc: "The party has never been the most active. So time to shake things up if we're going to make it for election day. Get your fat tails out of your sofas and start campaigning! Ring some bells, shake hooves and smile! Don't know how to do that? Grab some pamphlets and give them out! No, you're not getting paid for this! Your job is on the line!"

TBK_electoral_gamble: "Luck Never Dies"
TBK_electoral_gamble_desc: "The harmonic opposition constantly rants and rave about a free and fair election. And you know what? We're in. Let's do this. Let's have an election. A fair one. A quick one. What do they even have to offer that we don't? We've got the money, we've got the results, we've got the best candidate. Then again, it's a gamble but eh, we got this."

TBK_meet_opposition: "Shake Claw With Rose"
TBK_meet_opposition_desc: "Rose Rain. Leader of the Harmonic Front. It was such a cute idea that, allegedly, Pea Shooter sent a fruit basket when she had her first public meeting. However, she did manage to win over some ponies and is formally the head of our opposition. If we're going to make the people buy into this election, it's time to acknowledge her."

TBK_formalize_election_rigging: "One Citizen,\nOne Vote"
TBK_formalize_election_rigging_desc: "On paper, an election is something that is extremely simple. You vote and whoever gets the most votes wins. However, even the worst student of political science could tell you that there are finer details that can alter the outcome of an election and that the definition of winning is relative. We agree, so let's get to work on this."

TBK_citizen_fears: "Only Vasile Protects Your Interests, Citizen!"
TBK_citizen_fears_desc: "You know. Ponies are not really that dumb. They know that Vasile has some unsavory dealings here and there. But what about Rose? What was she doing? And what of the other candidates? All these politicians, do we know what they were doing during Pea's days? Meanwhile, you know Vasile and things are good. But the others? Can you trust them?"

TBK_sham_electoral_victory: "Three Hurrays To Victory"
TBK_sham_electoral_victory_desc: "Alright. Election day. What a blast this campaign has been. President cel Tradat has toured the nation with great success but now comes the moment of truth. I know we've stacked the deck but I'm starting to feel that the harmonists are onto something with this whole election thing. I HAVE NEVER FELT THIS ALIVE!"

TBK_entry_world_stage: "Enter The World"
TBK_entry_world_stage_desc: "Well. State building? Check. Defeat the lunatics? Check. Sounds like "this pompous griff from Brodfeld" has more than an ace in his sleeve, doesn't it? Now that we have proven ourselves, it is time to bring our unparalleled abilities to the world stage. Call in the translators. And a few crates of the best Aquileian wines. We don't want to be rude now, do we?"

TBK_warzena_choice: "What To Do With Warzena?"
TBK_warzena_choice_desc: "For as long as we've been independent and allegedly since Zarantia conquered Tobuck, Warzena has been a stick in the mud. Conflicts over water, over Miharzehir, over alleged smuggling and weapons trafficking. It all needs to stop. And it'll either be with a smile or a bullet. Although Vasile would smile after the bullet too. Multitasking and all that."

TBK_warzena_conquered: "Salutations, You Have Been Liberated!"
TBK_warzena_conquered_desc: "Well, you know what they say: If you can't trade with them, then you'd best invade and profiteer for a bit before integrating their economy and state apparatus proper. Sure it'll take a while for those uppity Warzenans to really start appreciating our wealth of knowledge and their newfound prosperity, but they'll come around eventually."

TBK_warzena_add_to_deal: "Welcome To The Business"
TBK_warzena_add_to_deal_desc: "You know what's better than having to deal with the economic meltdown that follows the collapse of a nation? Having good relations and trading with them from the get-go instead. If you can't beat the Warzenans - or in this case, if you shouldn't - then you should make 'em join you so that you can all get rich together!"

TBK_hippogriffia_deal: "Call To Under The Sea"
TBK_hippogriffia_deal_desc: "Hippogriffia. Land of Opportunity in troubled waters. For all their weirdness, they are the central axis around which Northern Zebrica revolves. Access to their market will be paramount to our future. So if we are to be a power in our own rights, we'll need to find a way to live and work with them. They can't be any preachier than Equestria, right?"

TBK_maregypt_deal: "In The Land Of Pyramids"
TBK_maregypt_deal_desc: "They say that a long time ago, Maregyptian settlers founded Tobuck. Whatever the truth is, the "old country" has always remained aloof, leaving us to deal with the Tamaneight nomads and other assorted bats. I know that they say that good fences make for good neighbours but prescription must apply after a few centuries? Let's go have a chat."

TBK_colthage_treaty: "Colthage Must Be Met And Greeted"
TBK_colthage_treaty_desc: "Colthage hasn't exactly been the most prosperous of places for the last little while, but that doesn't mean they're worthless. Any place can make a lot of money with the right connections and the right partners, so why don't we lend them a helping appendage? Well, so long as they wish to accept our diplomatic overtures of course."

TBK_abyssinia_deal: "The Purrrfect Deal"
TBK_abyssinia_deal_desc: "Tobuck often looks towards Maregypt but if we were to look a bit past the pyramid, we'd find another interesting land. Abyssinia. We have yet to make actual contact with the cats. Perhaps it's time to go and see if we can make them purr. They say curiosity killed the cat but they never said anything about profitable financial speculation."

TBK_equestria_recognition: "Are We Legitimate Yet?"
TBK_equestria_recognition_desc: "We've cleaned up our act, destroyed the biggest bastion of anti-Equestrian terrorists in history and brought prosperity to the northwestern zebrican peninsula. And yet, Equestria still won't recognize us! It's time to put our hoof down and request what we are owed: basic respect for our people. Also, access to their massive pool of capital. Mostly that."

TBK_zarantia_recourse: "No Hard Feelings Zarantia?"
TBK_zarantia_recourse_desc: "So what if we offered you a deal you couldn't refuse and then asked you to shove it where the sun don't shine? That was all Pea Shooter and now we're brand new. All good and above board. We swear. Also you may want to pay attention to the fact that we have a lot more guns now. So let's all consider our options here."

TBK_zarantia_war: "Time To Pull The Trigger"
TBK_zarantia_war_desc: "Well, you know what they say: If you can't trade with them, then you'd best invade and profiteer for a bit before integrating their economy and state apparatus proper. Sure the Zarantians don't have much of a state at all, but it would be remiss of us not to show them the ropes of nation building and earn some sweet cash in the process."

TBK_zarantia_mutual_benefits: "Tobuck-Agzhat Trade Territory"
TBK_zarantia_mutual_benefits_desc: "You know what's better than having to deal with the economic meltdown that follows the collapse of a nation? Having good relations and trading with them from the get-go instead. If you can't beat the Zarantians - or in this case, if it wouldn't be worthwhile - then you should make 'em join you so that you can all get rich together!"

TBK_tobuck_trade_center: "Tobuck The Beautiful, Tobuck The Centre"
TBK_tobuck_trade_center_desc: "It's not often that you can build a city and a nation to such great heights as these, but then it's also not often that you have a rather competent president to get you there. We live in an age where our great state and our beloved city has become a centre of local and international commerce, a time in which our republic is perfect and beautiful in every way."

TBK_vasile_secure_retirement_money: "Tradat Trust Inc."
TBK_vasile_secure_retirement_money_desc: "With the war finally over and our rule somewhat more cemented, we now finally have enough breathing room to get back to what we do best: make money. President Vasile made sure that he can't be removed or bought out but now? Now, he gets his dessert and he's not one for getting stomach aches."

TBK_north_western_branches: "North-Western Businesses"
TBK_north_western_branches_desc: "The annexed regions of Chiropterra are to many a source of worry. The economy is in shambles and ponies are angry. But to the entrepreneurial mind? It's all opportunities and should one have a lot of disposable capital, there's a lot of profit to be made over there. Funny thing is, they'll even thank us for it. Ah. Capitalism."

TBK_hollow_tungsten: "Hollow Minerals Mines"
TBK_hollow_tungsten_desc: "Mining is great. You hire some ponies, give them some tools and they'll start cranking out stuff to sell or transform to sell for even more. It's extremely straightforward. So the Huiactlali mines that were recently confiscated from their war criminal owners would definitely be a great asset to the Tradat Trust. Perhaps we should change the name though."

TBK_bat_lands_branch: "United Lunar Opium"
TBK_bat_lands_branch_desc: "Ah, the smell of opium in the morning. Can't get enough of it or so we're told. Now, we know that we've only legalized the least addicting drugs but there is still a lot to be made from Chiropterra's latest idea of an export. Pharmaceuticals perhaps? Anyway. In the trust it goes! Can't hurt to try after all!"

TBK_ursagrad_shipyards: "Black Lagoon Docks"
TBK_ursagrad_shipyards_desc: "For all its success as a trade port, Tobuck has never really shined when it comes to ship building. To this day, we've been forced to purchase our ships out of state. Perhaps it's time for the Tradat Trust to fill in this overlooked aspect of our economy. And lucky us, there is a coastal region in dire need of a big influx of jobs!"

TBK_tamaneight_economic_union_warzena: "Warzena Branch Office"
TBK_tamaneight_economic_union_warzena_desc: "Now that we've normalized our relations with Warzena, Tobuck is now reconnected with its historical economic hinterland. Now if only some major corporation with a lot of capital to invest and insider knowledge could step in to help revitalise the historical economic connexions between the two countries?"

TBK_back_to_gunrunning: "Back To Basics"
TBK_back_to_gunrunning_desc: "They say you never forget your first love. Whoever said that clearly held an Everfree SLR machine gun in his hooves. That thing is magnetic! Looking back, Pea's operation was basic: sell the guns from the big pile you stole. Cute. Now, let's show the world what a military-industrial complex can be!"

TBK_artillery_sales: "Drake Shell Industries"
TBK_artillery_sales_desc: "You know what sells for more than guns? Bigger guns! The kind you can't scrap together knockoff munitions for. While they are somewhat simple enough, a lot of countries have struggled to produce them in high enough numbers to make a difference. We can help make that difference in the world. For a price."

TBK_tank_sales: "Ursagrad Tractor Co."
TBK_tank_sales_desc: "Tanks. There's something about them that makes creatures go crazy but why? It's just a big gun on a big car that needs more logistics to run. Clearly, the Tradat Trust can't pass on a good fad but we'll make sure to also invest into something that is actually viable in the long term. Tractors. How else are ponies going to produce food? Organic farming?"

TBK_fighter_sales: "Phoenix Plant Ltd"
TBK_fighter_sales_desc: "Ever since Meyer brought piracy to the sky and Hippogriffia literally shot down the Storm King from the sky, creatures worldwide have understood the importance of air power. Sadly for them, it's costly to make and few countries sell them. But look into the sky! Is it a bird? Is it a plane? It IS a plane, a Tradat Trust Plane! Now in store!"

TBK_central_goods_research: "Tradat R&D Section"
TBK_central_goods_research_desc: "Progress. It has a way of moving faster than the best of our bullets. The morale is: learn how to make your bullet go faster. If we are to become and stay a world-renowned weapons-provider, we need to invest hard into a research department. I don't know what the guns of tomorrow will be firing but they'll be Tradat Trust brand!"

TBK_tamaneight_economic_union_zarantia: "Zarantia Branch Office"
TBK_tamaneight_economic_union_zarantia_desc: "So the wild nomads of the desert learned how to behave. Better late than ever. Now, there's opportunity there. Of course, raiding nomads don't make for easy exploitation of natural resources but a whole bunch of machine guns and planes sure help! Plus, we can always solve tribal rivalries by sprinkling some guns here and there."

TBK_domestic_civilian_monopoly: "Good Business Is Great Service"
TBK_domestic_civilian_monopoly_desc: "Tobuck has invested a lot into the hospitality economy but the whole sector remains in its infancy. So thanks to president cel Tradat's reforms, the Tradat Trust can step in and do a whole lot of investments. And it's only natural for us to get into the business since we've learned how to put on a big smile for the customer!"

TBK_tobuck_bell: "Tobuck Bell"
TBK_tobuck_bell_desc: "Zebrica has a lot of great food but it's made at home or sold into traditional restaurants. Very inefficient for the common worker on break and the young foal in the street. So here's a gap in the market for Tradat Trust to fill. Let's streamline the whole process and use economies of scale to crank out a lot of cheap filling and fast served food! Bon appétit!"

TBK_tradat_radio_entertainment: "Now We Return To Radio Tobuck!"
TBK_tradat_radio_entertainment_desc: "There is a lot of money in tourism and the hospitality business but what about the ponies at home? At work? In transit? They're out of our reach. They too need quality entertainment, information and to hear about how great life can be if they just purchased our products, visited our locations and used our services. Time for some sponsors!"

TBK_mages_of_shore: "Mages Of The Shore"
TBK_mages_of_shore_desc: "Tobuck has casinos and tourists but we're still working with basic card and dice games. Time to invest into some quality entertainment and machines to help shore up the whole operation! Hey, if we lock up some ponies in a room with paper and pens, they might come up with something to sell for the ponies at home. Let's roll for profit!"

TBK_vasile_post_bat_criminal:0 "The President-Boss Protects Us!"
TBK_vasile_post_bat_criminal_desc:0 "Against all odds, the President-Boss has managed to protect his people from the horrors of the Chiropterran invasion. Vasile cel Tradat shall waste no time, for while the regular pony is celebrating, he already has many plans how to expand his reach across all of Hazrumenia."

TBK_huiactlali_pacification:0 "Operation Void Pumpkin"
TBK_huiactlali_pacification_desc:0 "Occupations can be challenging affairs, but not for an intelligent creature such as Vasile. The administration has already arranged for the Huiactlali territories to be garrisoned with a headquarters established in Moonspeaker Hollow. The main objective of this operation will be to keep the Chiropterrans in line whilst making sure that the strategically vital strait city and tungsten mines remain safe."

TBK_tungsten_profits:0 "Great Tungsten Profits"
TBK_tungsten_profits_desc:0 "Huiactlali is home to the largest and wealthiest tungsten mines, not just in Hazrumenia but all of Northern Zebrica. The President-Boss will personally invest into the tungsten excavation operations and rumours say many others are looking to invest into it with bit signs in their eyes. Perhaps Vasile will offer them a claw in their endeavours..."

TBK_huiactlali_core:0 "Welcome Into Family, Huiactlali!"
TBK_huiactlali_core_desc:0 "Whilst the chiropterrans in Huiactlali utterly despise us, they know very well that there's no hope, for now at least, of ever being free. The President-Boss doesn't care if his enemies curse his name so long as they work for him and pay their taxes. And their bribes of course, especially paying the bribes."

TBK_ursagrad_potential:0 "Industries of Ursagrad"
TBK_ursagrad_potential_desc:0 "While not nearly as magnificent as New Ayacachtl, Ursagrad was one of the great industrial cities of Chiropterra and it now lays under the jurisdiction of the republic. The President-Boss will set an example to others by personally investing into Ursagrad, so its industries can get back onto their hooves; knowing that they will, in turn, enrich him."

TBK_new_mareidian_pacification:0 "Operation Toilet Clog"
TBK_new_mareidian_pacification_desc:0 "New Mareidian sits at a crucial choke-point that leads straight into the beloved city of Tobuck. It is for this reason that the republic must make sure the area isn't allowed to fall into enemy hooves. The President-Boss will make it known that any acts against him – sorry, the republic – will be met with fierce and absolute revenge."

TBK_new_mareidian_core:0 "Have A Seat,\nNew Mareidian!"
TBK_new_mareidian_core_desc:0 "Though the situation is still somewhat tense in the rural areas and especially in Batsby, Ursagrad has calmed down and some normalcy has returned to the city streets. No one even bats an eye at the various soldiers, mercenaries and security troops stationed across the city; either that or the locals have at least learnt to not draw attention to themselves. They wouldn't risk the odd beatdown now would they?"

TBK_new_schemes:0 "It Is Time To Think Big"
TBK_new_schemes_desc:0 "Victory over the far superior Chiropterran legions was nothing short of a total miracle and even the President-Boss is aware of this. It doesn't stop him from preaching that it was he who defeated Chiropterra, however. Now, thanks to his success and popularity, he can start to think up even bigger plans that involve not just Hazrumenia but much of Northern Zebrica too!"

TBK_criminal_riches:0 "Bit-ionaires of Tobuck"
TBK_criminal_riches_desc:0 "The greatest thing about today's Tobuck is that it is far wealthier than ever before and there are great opportunities to make money if you know the game. And, as any of his lackeys could tell you- nobody knows the game better than the President-Boss, the Richest Griffon of Zebrica."

TBK_doctors_recommend_heroic:0 "Over 1897 Doctors Recommend Heroic"
TBK_doctors_recommend_heroic_desc:0 "Heroic has been a great success both in domestic and foreign markets. Even in some faraway ports it has become known as a powerful tonic, though they don't know what's in it. Each day the chemists improve upon the mixture to make it more potent and desirable by the consumers. As the slogan goes, 'Be A Hero Today!'"

TBK_surprise_box:0 "The Surprise Box"
TBK_surprise_box_desc:0 "Gambling has always been an adult business. Well, not any longer! Over the last few days the Tradat Toys company has been advertising a new product called the 'Surprise box'. Foals don't know what's in it until they buy one, but they know for sure there is a chance to get a rare toy out of it. President-Boss said it the best; the kids will feel a sense of pride and accomplished for engaging with the fun chance of a surprise!"

TBK_mortal_elysium:0 "The Mortal Elysium"
TBK_mortal_elysium_desc:0 "Under Vasile's guiding claw, Tobuck has been transformed from being simply one of the largest cities in Hazrumenia into its biggest and most prosperous metropolis with more creatures moving in every day. Perhaps one day it will eclipse even the great cities of Mount Aris, Colthage and R'ataphet."

TBK_get_more_mercenaries:0 "Hey Mercenary! Want To Earn Big Money?"
TBK_get_more_mercenaries_desc:0 "The war against the despicable Chiropterrans drained the reserves of many popular mercenary companies. Some were unfortunately annihilated altogether. Luckily for Vasile, there are always more creatures ready to do whatever is asked of them for a few bits."

TBK_expand_national_guard:0 "Enlist Now, Help The President-Boss!"
TBK_expand_national_guard_desc:0 "To be a true Tobuckian is to be a determined, ruthless competitor and to be ever-loyal to the President-Boss. As he calls for creatures to join the national republican guard, every pony across the republic will heed his call. The time has come not just to compete, but to take over the market!"

TBK_attack_warzena:0 "Operation River Trip"
TBK_attack_warzena_desc:0 "What did the Warzenans do when they realised Chiropterra was on the war path? Nothing, that's what. They didn't send us even the tiniest bit of help. All they did was bend the knee to the hippogriffs and sit there. Vasile reckons they would make a great addition to the republic, if not for their insolence then for their riches just waiting to be taken!"

TBK_warzena_exploitation:0 "Tradat Agriculture"
TBK_warzena_exploitation_desc:0 "There's no feeling quite like remembering that a company you run is making thousands every second. That's how Vasile is going to feel after the Tradat Agriculture conglomerate is established in Warzena to exploit the land and farm every crop under the sun. Who in their right mind wouldn't capitalise on such an opportunity?"

TBK_warzena_republic_territory:0 "The State Of Zamivgazal"
TBK_warzena_republic_territory_desc:0 "Well, if it wasn't the invasion and subsequent economic development that brought the Warzenans back to their Hazrumenian family then Vasile doesn't know what it would be. You can tell how well integrated they are by how little they're shooting at the military police, just look at all those relaxed zebras!"

TBK_economic_zone_security:0 "N.Z.E.Z Security Corps"
TBK_economic_zone_security_desc:0 "The President-Boss knows it will not be easy to keep the new areas under control whilst exploiting them. To work around this, he has come up with a plan: form a specialized occupation detachment whose sole duty is to keep the locals in line. Best of all, we can simply hire the more pragmatic and opportunistic locals. It will cost the state, but better a little loss of money than loss of one's head!"

TBK_economic_zone_security_cake:0 "Treats Every Now And Then"
TBK_economic_zone_security_cake_desc:0 "Being constantly oppressive to the locals has the minor issue of workers occasionally refusing to shoot them which typically results in a small rout. While never a truly pressing issue, the fact of the matter is that the N.Z.E.Z needs a new angle from which to approach occupation. Maybe it pays to be nice every now and then?"

TBK_economic_zone_security_baton:0 "Where There's A Baton, There's A Way"
TBK_economic_zone_security_baton_desc:0 "In the end, the occupation of foreign lands is only for economic exploitation. Why bother to care about how the locals feel? Just make them move along and get out; if words don't work, that's when you take out the baton. They're not Tobuckians anyway, right?"

TBK_attack_zarantia:0 "Operation Sandbox"
TBK_attack_zarantia_desc:0 "You know what the Zarantians did when we were suffering innumerable casualties against the Chiropterran menace? They were preparing to invade us! Sure they used to own our land, but that's no excuse. It's high time we gave them a taste of their own medicine!"

TBK_zarantia_republic_territory:0 "The State Of Agzhat"
TBK_zarantia_republic_territory_desc:0 "The great thing about deserts is that you don't have to do a lot of work maintaining the infrastructure, caring for the people or any of that nonsense. They just want to be left to their own devices and, provided they continue to allow our resource extraction operations, the tribes can have just that. Welcome one and all to the republic!"

TBK_zarantia_exploitation:0 "Tradat Derrick Company"
TBK_zarantia_exploitation_desc:0 "Vasile, ever the savvy businesscreature that he is, sees great potential in investing in oil drilling across Zarantia. Ships, planes and armies guzzle down the stuff like a griffon in an all-you-can-eat buffet, so it's a secure export good that even those who despise the President-Boss overseas might buy through gritted teeth."

TBK_attack_zumidia:0 "Operation Jungle Safari"
TBK_attack_zumidia_desc:0 "The President-Boss has recently began to talk about Zumidia in earshot of the public. From what he's said, everyone seems to realise that it's a land full of riches being exploited by others. Well, the President-Boss now calls upon everyone to join him so that the republic can be the one to make money off of the place instead of whoever's doing it currently."

TBK_zumidia_republic_territory:0 "The State Of Ain Trotgourait"
TBK_zumidia_republic_territory_desc:0 "Ah, Zumidia. You know what's great about land that's had a history of being occupied? You can just take over from whoever was there before and continue running the place like nothing's happened! Sure we'll be making some changes, but these zebras barely even fought back like the Chiropterrans. These lands are gonna be mighty profitable!"

TBK_chiropterra_exploitation:0 "Investment Area Chiropterra"
TBK_chiropterra_exploitation_desc:0 "The President-Boss had previous left Chiropterra to its own devices as it would have been impossible to occupy the whole place. However, after the recent war where Chiropterra attempted to reclaim what it once had, it's clear as day that the place needs a new manager. We know just the President-Boss that's than qualified for the position!"

TBK_attack_colthage:0 "Operation Sagging Bag"
TBK_attack_colthage_desc:0 "The Colthaginians might look big and scary on a map, but their administration is notoriously unstable no matter who's in control. With that in mind, it's obvious that Colthage needs some new blood to make any sort of government work there in the long term. Wouldn't it be great if we could exploit the wealth of all Zonicia?"

TBK_colthage_exploitation:0 "Investment Area Colthage-Coltva"
TBK_colthage_exploitation_desc:0 "With the successful conquest of Zonicia, our beloved republic stands ready to grow rich from the wealth of the land. All across the new Investment Area, local industries and resource deposits are already being taken over by Tobuckian enterprises. Needless to say that the ones owned by the President-Boss are at the forefront of operations."

TBK_vasile_principles:0 "The Four E's Of Success"
TBK_vasile_principles_desc:0 "Recently a well known reporter asked the President-Boss just what the secret behind his success had been. After a long pause, Vasile Cel Tradat said it really came down to his four core principles; the Four E's of Success: Expand, Exploit, Eliminate and most importantly Enjoy."

TBK_truly_free_republic:0 "One And Only Free Republic In the World"
TBK_truly_free_republic_desc:0 "All the republics in the world claim to be bastions of freedom; in truth, they too restrict true freedom and shackle the innovators of their nation. Those who push forward the economy by simply being better than others are the ones that should be empowered! In Tobuck things are different; anyone with the skill, cunning and will can achieve great success!"

TBK_king_of_corruption:0 "King Of Corruption"
TBK_king_of_corruption_desc:0 "It is no secret Vasile's word is law, even if he is simply the President and is 'technically' beholden to the people. Every citizen, criminal and mercenary knows that if the President-Boss says to hoof - or claw- over some money then the only proper answer is to ask 'How much?'"

TBK_criminal_high:0 "The Criminal High"
TBK_criminal_high_desc:0 "Vasile knows that it's bad business to solely rely on foreign experts. It is a better long-term investment to home grow these sorts of things, as proven by the brand-new education system. It is subsequently high time that the President-Boss launched his own private academy where Tobuckian youth will learn the skills required to be useful lackeys. Perhaps one day somepony among them will take his place..."

TBK_wallnut_start: "The Rebel Apostate"
TBK_wallnut_start_desc: "The infamous apostate of Chiropterra Wallnut Drive has taken control of Tobuck. This is a major opportunity, and he's not about to let it go to waste. First, to decide which of the other warlords will be most helpful..."

TBK_no_gods: "No Gods!"
TBK_no_gods_desc: "Religion is the opiate of the masses! Or so claims at least Wallnut despite some reservations of his socialist friends, who wish to not make enemies of the gods. Nightmareism is different, Nightmareism is more like cocaine, but they're both bad. This evil must be defeated, that's an order!"

TBK_challenge_normalcy: "Decadent Normalcy"
TBK_challenge_normalcy_desc: "What is "normality"? It's what a bunch of old creatures say it is, usually to benefit themselves. From now on, no more hankering over normality or morality or other stuffy ways of saying no."

TBK_wallnut_authority: "Viva Wallnut!"

TBK_only_justice: "Only Justice!"
TBK_only_justice_desc: "We're gonna need some laws, naturally. Some good laws. Laws Wallnut came up with, or at least ones his smartest friends did. Not laws based on stupid religions or outdated mores, but on cold hard truths and real vision."

TBK_only_victory: "Only Victory!"
TBK_only_victory_desc: "Wallnut Drive escaped Chiropterra, but not before getting some of their world class military training. And he's smarter than all of them combined. He had to be, otherwise some other bat woulda realized Nightmareism was bunk before him. With him at the helm, we'll be all but unstoppable!"

TBK_share_bat_horrors: "Lemme Tell You About Chiropterra!"
TBK_share_bat_horrors_desc: "One of the few times when Wallnut gets real quiet and serious is when talking about Chiropterra. It's a terrible place. The callous disregard for the lives of so-called "faithless," the oppressive atmosphere, the LMRD and the Nightmare's Hoof committing atrocities by the day. If there's one thing Wallnut Drive knows, it's that they must be stopped."

TBK_no_chains: "No Chains!"
TBK_no_chains_desc: "Gun runners are one thing, slavers are another. Slave traders, sweatshop owners, and those monsters who gave intelligence to the Chiropterrans to help them plan their slaving raids, they've all gotta go. Wallnut will make sure they repay their debt to their fellow creatures through hard manual labour, and that their assets are confiscated too."

TBK_worker_pride: "Pride Of The Labourer"
TBK_worker_pride_desc: "It's not just great ponies like Wallnut Drive who make the world go round; in fact he couldn't do anything without the hard work of the common labourer. We should celebrate that, and make sure workers know that they're appreciated, both in our hearts and with our wallets."

TBK_launch_bat_probes: "Strike 'em Where It Hurts!"
TBK_launch_bat_probes_desc: "Chiropterra looks invincible, doesn't it? Well it turns out they've got a rigid chain of command and an intricate logistics network.

TBK_baragzen_start: "The Forsaken Lord"
TBK_baragzen_start_desc: "The true heir to the Warzenan throne now stands triumphant above Tobuck. Unintentional as this conquest may have been, resulting from naught but closer cooperation with Pea Shooter, it has given Baragzen and his forces quite the opportunity."

TBK_aristocrat_servants: "Restore The Lineages"
TBK_aristocrat_servants_desc: "There are a selection of upper-class citizens in Manerba that used to be part of Warzenan noble society before outside forces stripped them of their titles and land. We shall grant them titles and establish a court here in Tobuck with their assistance."

TBK_loyal_local_zarantians: "Renewed Oaths"
TBK_loyal_local_zarantians_desc: "The time has come to instill the populace and their local leaders with a sense of loyalty. We shall 'encourage' them to make oaths and pledges for the sake of service to Baragzen in whatever capacity he deems fit and proper."

TBK_remind_of_loyalty: "Reminder About Loyalty"
TBK_remind_of_loyalty_desc: "Fear is a very important tool, one that an experienced warlord like Baragzen understands very well. Examples will be made of a small number of known dissidents so that those with a desire to resist fear action against those of true royal blood."

TBK_merchant_tobuck: "The Merchant Of Tobuck"
TBK_merchant_tobuck_desc: "Vasile is well known in Tobuck's business circles and was seemingly uninvolved in Pea Shooter's plot to sell the region back to Zarantia. We shall make proper use of his incredible economic expertise and grant him a position of administration over the city of Tobuck itself."

TBK_new_princely_guard: "The Oath Wardens"
TBK_new_princely_guard_desc: "Ancient legends tell of these soldiers, dutiful guards of Warzenan rulers. Such an idea is well suited to the exiled lord who is very much in need of protection and loyalty in this turbulent time for Tobuck. The legends shall once again have their names etched into history."

TBK_guard_recruitment: "Only The Finest Soldiers"
TBK_guard_recruitment_desc: "Mercenaries are no longer an appropriate name for Baragzen's finest soldiery. Though their reputation and skill arose from the lowest of the low, so did his legitimacy as ruler; it is only fitting that their discipline be drilled and reinforced by the Oath Wardens."

TBK_blood_warzena: "Blood Of The Leopard"
TBK_blood_warzena_desc: "The Leopard bloodline of the Warzenan dynasties is an ancient and powerful one. It is demonstrative of the validity in any individual's claim to the Warzenan throne should such be proven by action, though Baragzen in particular may ambitions far more grand."

TBK_weak_brother: "The Weakling King"
TBK_weak_brother_desc: "The current Warzenan monarch is nothing more than a puppet of the hippogriff menace, a false inheritor of a glorious and yet untapped past and nation. We shall decry and denounce that traitor with all the resources available to our administration."

TBK_worthy_king: "The Worthy Heir"
TBK_worthy_king_desc: "Unlike the puppet monarch who currently sits on the throne, Baragzen is a warrior king like those of old; his claim to the throne is indisputable. We shall make a public declaration of our intentions to install the rightful king of Warzena, both to the public and to our enemy."

TBK_i_am_king: "The Abjuration Decree"
TBK_i_am_king_desc: "Baragzen's first law for the new realm is the Abjuration Decree. All power vested in government officials is to be subsumed by his will and whim, under no circumstances must this rule be ignored. Any remnants of Pea Shooter's republic will be eliminated for good."

TBK_secure_river_border: "The Demarean Embankments"
TBK_secure_river_border_desc: "Unlike his contemporary warlord commanders, Baragzen expresses no displeasure at the concept of flooding particular areas for the sake of defensive proficiency. If Chiropterra wishes to invade, then they shall meet a well prepared and dangerous foe."

TBK_alesia_start: "The White Severyanian"
TBK_alesia_start_desc: "Through iron will and decisive action, Alesia Snezhnaya has emerged the dominant power in Tobuck. While the other warlords are cowed, she must find one of them to make a pact with and dispose of the other."

TBK_subdue_locals: "Righteous Rule"
TBK_subdue_locals_desc: "The Severyanian tsars of old ruled with justice and fairness, but also cold efficiency. They had no time for foolish things like mercy, or forgiving those who deserved no forgiveness. Alesia will emulate their example, and crush the rebellious scum and the criminals of Tobuck in one swift blow."

TBK_evil_communism: "The Red Beast"
TBK_evil_communism_desc: "The one saving grace of Tobuck is that the godless venom of communism hasn't infected it. Alesia intends to keep it that way, and to use her new state as a hammer against the ravening red hordes."

TBK_defenders_traditions: "White Druzhina"
TBK_defenders_traditions_desc: "Now that Alesia has broken the deadlock of smugglers, warlords, and miscreants, she can centralize and discipline this rabble into a proper army. The first step is redistributing Alesia's loyal troops into the ranks of new regiments, where they will serve as instructors and discipline officers. These mixed Severyanian-Tobuckian units will be the Druzhina, and the other units should strive to emulate them."

TBK_all_for_defence: "All For Triumph!"
TBK_all_for_defence_desc: "Resolute stoicism, unyielding determination, uncomplaining sacrifice. These were the values which made Severyana strong before the communist cancer rotted them away, and these are the values Alesia will instill by her example."

TBK_long_from_home: "It's A Long Way To Princessyn"
TBK_long_from_home_desc: "The white exiles are few in number, but every single one of them is worth ten other ponies. Alesia will call upon old contacts and allies among the last true Severyans, and rekindle the dream of a new Severyana among them. One day, we shall return, and bring fire and death to the bloodthirsty beasts who despoil our lands."

TBK_new_exile_regiment: "We Are Severyanian Soldiers"
TBK_new_exile_regiment_desc: "The advantage of coming to power in Tobuck is that it is a cultural blank slate. Thanks to this, we have been able to foster Severyanian values of stoicism, sacrifice, hierarchy, and discipline among our soldiers, with no need to uproot an inferior service culture. The tales of Severyanian heroes of old shall inspire our troops, and they will show the rabble of this continent what true warfare is!"

TBK_contact_kin: "The Exiled Community"
TBK_contact_kin_desc: "Alesia was already well-known among the Severyanian exiles, and as news of her victory has spread more and more of her compatriots have begun to feel the old flames of patriotism rekindle. Some of the old nobility managed to escape with significant wealth, and now many of them are making generous donations to our cause."

TBK_severyan_family: "Severyana Endures Through Us"
TBK_severyan_family_desc: "Severyana may have fallen, first to the scheming princess and then to the vile communists, but so long as one true Severyanian draws breath it is not lost. Alesia will rule with the same rigid strength as the tsars of old, and muster her forces until, one day, the true foals of Severyana will return to drive out the parasites who feast on their homeland."

TBK_i_hate_sand_desc: "There is nothing worse than desert warfare. However, given Pea Shooter's machinations we will likely have to face the Zarantian savages sooner rather than later. Alesia has declared that we will construct a line of fortifications along their border, complete with minefields and concealed killzones, such that by the time we step into the desert there will only be corpses waiting for us."

TBK_full_war_economy: "All the Guns and Bullets"
TBK_full_war_economy_desc: "Our first priority should be getting guns into hooves. We'll use the remainder of the smugglers' ill-gotten-gains to purchase as many weapons as we can find, and scour the city to dredge up its hidden stashes. After that, we'll have to make our own."

TBK_pay_troops: "All Possible Troops"
TBK_pay_troops_desc: "Our first priority should be to get more hooves to hold guns. We will increase soldiers' pay to incentivize as many to enlist as possible, then extend conscription to make up the difference with draftees."

TBK_new_tobuck: "Death Of Tobuck"
TBK_new_tobuck_desc: "The Republic of Tobuck was a sham state from the start. Few marked its passing, and fewer still will mourn it. It is time to formally bury the republic, so that our new order can begin in earnest."

TBK_brand_new_bureaucracy:0 "Brand New Bureaucracy"
TBK_brand_new_bureaucracy_desc:0 "Retaining any significant remnant of the old government will end in tears, not least for how impossibly corrupt the whole affair was.

TBK_purge_corruption:0 "War Against Corruption"
TBK_purge_corruption_desc:0 "We must forever be vigilant against the scourge of corruption, lest it take root in the federation as it did in Tobuck once before.

TBK_federal_framework:0 "Federal Framework"

TBK_delegionarization:0 "Delegionarization"
TBK_delegionarization_desc:0 "If the new federal framework is to function, the bottom line is that the system of families and legions must be entirely dismantled.

TBK_reparations_law:0 "Reparations Act"
TBK_reparations_law_desc:0 "We cannot allow the destruction of war to alienate the Chiropterrans and drive them away from our Hazrumenian family. To that end it is imperative that we compensate them for the suffering that they endured, painful to the coffers as it may be."

The state will set up programmes to make sure they leave education with the knowledge they need to go right into work!"

TBK_academic_benefits:0 "Academic Research"
TBK_academic_benefits_desc:0 "If there's one thing that students should be doing after school, it's further education. We need forward-thinking innovators to propel the federation into a new age. The state will make sure that every student knows that they have every opportunity to contribute to science!"

TBK_tobuck_campus:0 "Wallnut Heritage College"
TBK_tobuck_campus_desc:0 "What better than to open a new centre for higher education named after the one and only Wallnut Drive! Sure he's never had tertiary education himself, but the state is sure that he'll appreciate the gesture all the same; a new college is still a new college in any case!"

TBK_pension_plans:0 "Universal Pensions Bill"
TBK_pension_plans_desc:0 "Pensions for the weary citizens within our ever-growing Hazrumenian family are a natural progression of existing worker laws. We shall reward those who have worked hard to lay the foundations of and build the federation that so many now live within."

TBK_subsidized_healthcare:0 "Subsidized Healthcare"
TBK_subsidized_healthcare_desc:0 "Though fully state-funded healthcare is currently beyond the purview of the government's budget, we are far from incapable of helping. The state will front a portion of all medical costs for the good of the family that it protects and cherishes."

TBK_liberal_economics:0 "The Free Market"
TBK_liberal_economics_desc:0 "Opening up to the world is necessary for progress and for prosperity. We cannot sit idly by as our neighbours embrace external markets and the careful guiding hoof of economic liberalism. The time has come for our Hazrumenian family to embrace another important aspect of modern harmony."

TBK_two_half_plan:0 "2&¾ Year Plan"
TBK_two_half_plan_desc:0 "If we are to develop Hazrumenia, then it would be best if we developed the lands quickly so that our enemies may not take advantage of our weakened capacity. Rapid industrialization and modernisation must carry forth our federal dreams."

TBK_farmer_bonds:0 "Bonds For Farmers"
TBK_farmer_bonds_desc:0 "Investments are a surefire way to encourage continued economic growth, particularly in sectors that leave much to be desired. Farmers and their farms lack considerable amounts of equipment and knowhow when it comes to mechanised farming, so we'll give them the means to figure it out!"

TBK_diversified_crops:0 "Diversified Fields"
TBK_diversified_crops_desc:0 "We can't simply rely on subsistence farming anymore if we wish to make full use of both the ongoing economic growth and the money to be made in selling our produce. The state will provide minor incentives to grow secondary crops and our farmers will soon reap the benefits of their plurality of plants."

TBK_agricultural_development_focus:0 "Ministry Of Agriculture And Rural Development"
TBK_agricultural_development_focus_desc:0 "With the meteoric rise in our farming industry, things have begun to get a little messy regarding land use and the general surplus of certain produce on the market. With a state ministry to get things organised, we should see development continue at an exponential rate!"

TBK_corporate_farms:0 "Corporate Farms"
TBK_corporate_farms_desc:0 "With the growth of any market comes the gradual development of larger companies that begin to compete with one another for their fair share in the sector. Luckily for the state, this means that they'll keep their prices down for competition's sake and develop the surrounding lands for us!"

TBK_agricultural_mechanization:0 "Tractor Co-Operatives"
TBK_agricultural_mechanization_desc:0 "Though we have done much to improve the average financial stock of all individuals within Hazrumenia, modern agricultural equipment is still really quite expensive. To that end, cooperative projects in which equipment is shared alongside profits will be a great boon for our agricultural endeavours."

TBK_efficient_supply_lines:0 "From Field To Plants"
TBK_efficient_supply_lines_desc:0 "A little optimization can go a long way and the supply chain between the farms and the processing plants is far from perfect. With a little work and some careful planning, it should be no time before the rail networks and road routes can support the vastly increased production."

TBK_development_plans:0 "General Development Plans"
TBK_development_plans_desc:0 "As the name would suggest, the government has developed some rather loose plans for the development of the economy and in particular of our industry. With just a little industrial zoning and lot allocation, we can easily provide land and list requirements for the construction of new industrial plants."

TBK_infrastructure_expansion:0 "Federal Railway Union"
TBK_infrastructure_expansion_desc:0 "Though some are concerned about the emergence of unions, they nevertheless hold an important place in politics and industrial development. Should the railroads go silent, the economy would grind to a halt; it's best we keep the track workers and train drivers on side."

TBK_roadways:0 "The Black Veins"
TBK_roadways_desc:0 "The dark tarmac of roads are the lifeblood of both our civilian and military infrastructure and represent an immensely important asset for the administration. Though it will make the coffers suffer in the short term, investing in our transport network only promises great things in the future."

TBK_wholecase_urbanization:0 "The Concrete Future"
TBK_wholecase_urbanization_desc:0 "Whilst it is true that industry can often be overbearing when it comes to the grey concrete and the dark smog of progress, it is a necessary evil. The state will do its best to protect places of historical import across Hazrumenia, but nothing and nobody will stand in the way of progress and prosperity."

TBK_synthetic_oil_investment:0 "Synthetic Gasoline Industries"
TBK_synthetic_oil_investment_desc:0 "Though traces of black gold in Zarantia may eventually reveal more substantial fields, for the moment oil remains a resource which we have precious little access to. The obvious course of action is to invest in synthetic programmes through which we can create a local surplus for civilian and military use."

TBK_manehattan_of_zebrica:0 "Manehattan of Zebrica"
TBK_manehattan_of_zebrica_desc:0 "Manehattan is the city of dreams and Tobuck is far from achieving such a title, or at least it was merely a decade ago. Now it's the centre of a new harmonic society, a beacon of what can be achieved even in the most insidious and morally bankrupt regimes. Perhaps our capital is worthy of such a title too."

TBK_free_trade_enshrined:0 "Embrace Free Trade"
TBK_free_trade_enshrined_desc:0 "Far from the shady dealings of Pea Shooter and the centralised system that reigned prior to the creation of the federation, free trade is a logical evolution of state policy. If we are truly to provide individuals with equality of opportunity, then we must make trade fair game for all."

TBK_foreign_investors:0 "Court The Investors"
TBK_foreign_investors_desc:0 "'Brown nosing' isn't exactly the most well respected of activities amongst business owners and investors, but it certainly does the job if you can do it right. With a little work and a lot of patience, we can instil some international confidence in our economy."

TBK_federal_bit:0 "North Zebrican Bit"
TBK_federal_bit_desc:0 "The Equestrians are yet to adopt harmony in its true form, but they've done a lot of things right in the time it's taken to get them here. More specifically, they have embraced the idea of a unifying currency and it would be prudent of us to take that leaf out of their book."

TBK_banking_act:0 "The Bill And Coin Act"
TBK_banking_act_desc:0 "If we want to have a dependable and stable currency, it is imperative that the state guarantees the private holdings of investors and citizens alike. We cannot have criminals or simple economic crises destroy the good faith in our economy that we have established."

TBK_investment_boon:0 "Investment Boon"
TBK_investment_boon_desc:0 "Investment is a necessary part of modern economics and individuals often have the power to make or break important fiscal deals. Bean Counter and his associates are more than capable of serving as an economic consultancy for the government, especially now that we've guaranteed their holdings."

TBK_rich_society:0 "Prosperity Garners Prosperity"
TBK_rich_society_desc:0 "If there's one thing economic growth is good for, it's more economic growth! It's a circular system of investment, the investments paying off and both parties profiting and then using that money to make more investments; isn't money a brilliant thing?"

TBK_wallnut_economic_miracle:0 "Land Of Hard Work"
TBK_wallnut_economic_miracle_desc:0 "Our Hazrumenian family is certainly innovative and prosperous, but also we're a hardworking bunch on top of that! As long as we make our money and the pensions for the work we do are good, anyone can do anything in this lovely federation of ours."

TBK_wallnuts_industrialists:0 "My Good Moguls"
TBK_wallnuts_industrialists_desc:0 "Though it surprised everyone initially, it seems as though Vasile Tradat, Bean Counter and Home Brew have taken to legitimate business in earnest. With their expertise and skill in deal brokering, they're certain to make quite a name for themselves."

TBK_bean_counter_business:0 "B. Counter & Co."
TBK_bean_counter_business_desc:0 "Bean Counter recently decided to found a small string of banks with his financial expertise, a small string of banks which have rapidly become some of the larger economic entities within the borders of the federation. Needless to say that liaising with some of their experts will be most beneficial."

TBK_home_brew_business:0 "Homely Coffee Corporation"
TBK_home_brew_business_desc:0 "Coffee has quickly become one of the most valuable commodities the world over. To nopony's surprise, Home Brew was quick to capitalise off of the rapid growth of an industry in which he already took interest and is already reaping the benefits of his good timing."

TBK_vasile_business:0 "Tradat Manufacturing"
TBK_vasile_business_desc:0 "Given his cooperation with Pea Shooter, it's no surprise that Vasile has sauntered confidently back into the arms business. Though the weapons designed under his company have thus far been rather unorthodox, they also seem to work surprisingly well and can be made for cheap."

TBK_stimulate_economy:0 "Stimulate Economy"
TBK_stimulate_economy_desc:0 "Private investments are important, but the state is an incredibly important part of economic development; especially when it comes to funding. Providing citizens with economic incentives to start their own companies and further the industrial development of Hazrumenia is our prerogative."

TBK_free_growth:0 "Fiscal Autonomy"
TBK_free_growth_desc:0 "The state has no business in business. It should remain entirely independent of economic affairs and allow growth to happen at a more natural pace. A government's duty is to its citizens in resolving disputes and maintaining a monopoly on force to protect the citizens from one another."

TBK_private_markets:0 "Competitive Innovations"
TBK_private_markets_desc:0 "Competition within markets is the most important factor for spurring innovation and sector development, far more influential than even the best of corporate reviews for efficiency. With this in mind, continual technological development and its use in state industries is an inevitability."

TBK_issue_monopolies:0 "Theory Of Monopoly"
TBK_issue_monopolies_desc:0 "Whilst monopolies can certainly be detrimental to any market, they can only maintain their position if they continue to innovate. With this in mind, the administration can make use of the continued battle for market control in its own acquisitions and the application of new technology."

TBK_foster_competition:0 "Laws Of Competition"
TBK_foster_competition_desc:0 "Competition in internal Hazrumenian markets is just as important as competition in the global market and may not be sullied by any existing or potential monopolies. We must always encourage easily available technology via continued prosperity from competition."

TBK_raw_resource_exploitation:0 "Riches Of Land"
TBK_raw_resource_exploitation_desc:0 "For all the deserts and the jungles in Hazrumenia, the land that is usable has much to covet both in fertility and in resources. It's high time we began a proper extraction program to make best use of our natural bounty, not least for the fact that we now have a stable market to sell on."

TBK_ulnz_mining_ministry:0 "ULNZ Bureau Of Mines"
TBK_ulnz_mining_ministry_desc:0 "Resource extraction is a complicated affair when it comes to organisation, permits and all the other administrative aspects that make paper pushers suffer. It would be best if the state created a subordinate ministry to handle the paperwork for our ever-growing mining sector."

TBK_analyze_lands:0 "Conduct Land Analysis"
TBK_analyze_lands_desc:0 "There's no better time than the present to formally survey the land and see what Hazrumenia has to offer. Given our already considerable mining industry, it stands to reason that the administration's efforts to expand it should return our investments many times over."

TBK_griffonian_mining_companies:0 "Miners Of Griffonia"
TBK_griffonian_mining_companies_desc:0 "The griffons are industrious creatures and are particularly talented in the field of resource extraction, both for their coveted techniques and their enchanted equipment. We could make great use of their expertise and would do well to invite whichever companies we can contact."

TBK_wingbardian_company:0 "Azienda Generale Wingbardia Petroli"
TBK_wingbardian_company_desc:0 "The Wingbardians are uniquely gifted in the field of oil and oil-based resources. With their help we can make great strides in the field of synthetic materials, particularly with regard to rubber and the exploitation of - unsurprisingly - oil."

TBK_republican_company:0 "Société Métallurgique De Orvalillo"
TBK_republican_company_desc:0 "The Aquileia are uniquely gifted in the field of metalwork and the industries surrounding its usage. With their help we can make great strides in the field of metallurgy, particularly with regard to aluminium and the exploitation of iron deposits which we can use to make steel."

TBK_wallnut_harmony_diplomacy:0 "The Wallnut Pledge"
TBK_wallnut_harmony_diplomacy_desc:0 "Wallnut has always stood for democracy, harmony and our geopolitical aims. It is his dream to unite the seemingly disparate members of the Hazrumenian family and bring them into the fold with open arms. He will defend our dream and our cause, to the very end."

TBK_harmony_alliance_internal_development:0 "Treaty Of Tobuck"
TBK_harmony_alliance_internal_development_desc:0 "A formal declaration to all nearby Harmonists of our intentions will do wonders for our international reputation, not least for the fact that they may be willing to assist in our future endeavours for our Hazrumenian family as a result."

TBK_harmony_alliance_vaccine_plan:0 "War Against Pandemics"
TBK_harmony_alliance_vaccine_plan_desc:0 "Disease has always been one of the most potent killers, moreso even than war and perhaps famine too. It is the charge of the government and of all members of the Hazrumenian family to work towards eliminating such diseases through medical cooperation."

TBK_harmony_alliance_research_cooperation:0 "HETA"
TBK_harmony_alliance_research_cooperation_desc:0 "Science and technology are something which all nations strive to improve over time, but it is strangely uncommon for many nations to cooperate in order to achieve the desired innovation. With the Hazrumenian Education and Technology Assembly, this will change for the better."

TBK_harmony_alliance_shared_vision:0 "Shared Vision"
TBK_harmony_alliance_shared_vision_desc:0 "The federation and our Hazrumenian family have a vision of democracy, of harmony and of freedom. It is a dream we all share and wish to work towards, a future within our grasp. Soon we will have our collective vision come to pass, united and free."

TBK_harmony_alliance_state_visits:0 "State Visits"
TBK_harmony_alliance_state_visits_desc:0 "There's nothing like a visit - or a party - to really cement relations and cooperation between partners in harmony and democracy. What better than for Wallnut to officially visit our neighbours and charm them with his characteristic smile?"

TBK_harmony_alliance_council:0 "Council Of Hazrumenia"
TBK_harmony_alliance_council_desc:0 "Though not an official legislative body in any real capacity, the Council of Hazrumenia will serve as an important supranational body in which to discuss a unified approach to foreign policy and international relations. More cooperation between members of the Hazrumenian family is always a good thing."

TBK_harmony_alliance_security_cooperation:0 "Mutual Security"
TBK_harmony_alliance_security_cooperation_desc:0 "An attack against one is an attack against all, we must be ready to defend our Hazrumenian family from all that seek to tear it apart. Interlinking the high commands of each military and endeavouring to prepare every state for war is a necessity for our security."

TBK_harmony_alliance_army_exercises:0 "Supranational Military Exercises"
TBK_harmony_alliance_army_exercises_desc:0 "If we are to embrace full military readiness against any possible threat to the federation and our family, we must train our troops to be ready to defend us. It could be the Colthaginians, it could be the Hippogriffs or even the Maregyptians; whatever the case, we must be prepared."

TBK_harmony_alliance_army_integration:0 "United Hazrumenian Defence Force"
TBK_harmony_alliance_army_integration_desc:0 "The dream of Hazrumenian harmony is something that every creature can stand up for. With a little effort towards recruiting and a large emphasis on the importance of supranational defence, we will be able to mobilise a large number of currently idle individuals."

TBK_harmony_alliance_cultural_work:0 "Land Of Many Equines"
TBK_harmony_alliance_cultural_work_desc:0 "Ponies, zebras and thestrals. We are many and may differ in appearance, but together we are united and strong; we will fight for our family and our dream! Our vision for democracy and freedom shall not be trodden on by sentiments of race or disparity!"

TBK_harmony_alliance_we_are_hazrumenians:0 "We Are All Hazrumenians"
TBK_harmony_alliance_we_are_hazrumenians_desc:0 "There is one thing that unites us. It's not culture, heritage or race; but our family. We are all Hazrumenians, a proud and stalwart people filled with vigour and a desire to be free! We are all part of something greater, something that every single creature can be proud of!"

TBK_warzena_union:0 "Harmony In Warzena"
TBK_warzena_union_desc:0 "The history of Warzena and Tobuck is not an easy one to overcome, but it is one that gives our citizens something to reflect upon. Our Hazrumenian family will never be torn apart by squabbles and ridiculous conflicts over land. Never another custodianship!"

TBK_union_warzena_bonus:0 "Re-Invigorate Trade Routes"
TBK_union_warzena_bonus_desc:0 "Before the invasion of the Storm King, there were relatively stable trading relations established between the city of Tobuck and the Warzenan kingdom. Though they have been long dormant, those routes should be opened once more; as both a kind and profitable gesture of friendship."

TBK_union_warzena_integration:0 "Riverlands Of Warzena"
TBK_union_warzena_integration_desc:0 "Warzena has always been a rich land full of winding rivers and thoughtful zebras. They have never before been closer to the hooves of their Hazrumenian family and the time has come to welcome them back, forgiving them for their warlike past and supporting their reforms."

TBK_hippogriffia_talks:0 "Telegram To Aris"
TBK_hippogriffia_talks_desc:0 "Even though they occupy Hazrumenian land, they're not so bad. With a little effort and an outstretched hoof, a telegram to their doorstep may indeed be well received. Perhaps we may yet make friends with these curious outsiders."

TBK_maregypt_diplomacy:0 "Entente With Maregypt"
TBK_maregypt_diplomacy_desc:0 "Though a military alliance is likely off of the table, that doesn't mean we can't build bridges with the Maregyptians. After all, they built Tobuck way back in ancient times; the least we could do is offer them an accord."

TBK_zumidian_issue:0 "The Zumidian Lands"
TBK_zumidian_issue_desc:0 "One pressing matter on which we must unfortunately confront Mount Aris is the matter of their Zumidian territories. Not only were they gained through conquest, but they remain unrepresented and are an integral part of Hazrumenia. Come what may, we must ask the difficult question."

TBK_zumidian_integration:0 "Federal District Of Zumidia"
TBK_zumidian_integration_desc:0 "Zumidia has lacked democracy and harmony for many years now and, though the right to self determination cannot be denied, it would be the responsible course of action to ensure they get it right first time as part of the federation. They can always vote to secede later, after all."

TBK_zumidian_bonus:0 "Zumidian Republic"
TBK_zumidian_bonus_desc:0 "Though we'll stick our hooves in to make sure nothing too concerning comes out of the blue, our Zumidian siblings must have their own republic to decide their own fate. Our Hazrumenian dream is one of cooperation between respected family members, not one of forced assimilation."

TBK_colthage_diplomacy:0 "Detente With Colthage"
TBK_colthage_diplomacy_desc:0 "The Colthaginians haven't exactly been the most stable bunch as of late, nor have they been the most polite when discussing the matter of Zumidia. In fact, given the chance, it's likely that they'd try to take it for themselves. It would be prudent for us to make sure they remain cordial. Or at least be wary of invading us."

TBK_harmony_alliance_economy:0 "Hazrumenian Commercial Pact"
TBK_harmony_alliance_economy_desc:0 "If there's one thing that freedom has taught us it's that the less boundaries there are between countries and peoples, the quicker the economy grows. Our Hazrumenian family will share in this prosperity in due time, once we show them the ropes."

TBK_zarantia_union:0 "Harmony In Zarantia"
TBK_zarantia_union_desc:0 "Ah, the Zarantians. They've never been a particularly aggressive bunch, but they do always seem to have an eye for our capital city. All the same, we can forgive their desire for modernisation through force and welcome them to our dream for Hazrumenia."

TBK_union_zarantia_bonus:0 "Right Of Free Travel"
TBK_union_zarantia_bonus_desc:0 "There aren't many creatures that would willingly travel into the tribal lands of Zarantia, but those that would like to visit deserve as much of a chance as those that would like to move to Tobuck from the desert. Free movement for all, free travel for prosperity and harmony!"

TBK_union_zarantia_integration:0 "Dunes Of Zarantia"
TBK_union_zarantia_integration_desc:0 "Though we've had our differences in the past, the Zarantians are now nothing less than another loving sibling in our Hazrumenian family. It's high time that we embrace them fully and welcome them with open arms, celebrating the true victory of the tribes in their march towards modernity."

TBK_harmony_alliance_conference:0 "All-Members Economic Forum"
TBK_harmony_alliance_conference_desc:0 "Economic cooperation is the next logical step in supranational integration, providing a basis upon which to provide prosperity for all within the union. Development and industry for all members of the union and economic infrastructure to connect all peoples!"

TBK_harmony_alliance_tariffs:0 "Tariff Reductions"
TBK_harmony_alliance_tariffs_desc:0 "Though many would have you believe that tariffs grant wealth to the countries that they protect the resources of, the opposite is in fact true. In the long term, tariffs create economic barriers between states that limit potential growth; our Hazrumenian family has no need for such things."

TBK_harmony_alliance_shared_passport:0 "Hazrumenian Passport"
TBK_harmony_alliance_shared_passport_desc:0 "Passports make identification easier, but what's the point of every Hazrumenian state having its own passport if free travel between borders is already encouraged? This status quo will not do, the state will provide all union citizens with Hazrumenian passports instead, for the sake of efficiency."

TBK_harmony_alliance_development_fund:0 "Hazrumenian Development Bureau"
TBK_harmony_alliance_development_fund_desc:0 "Facilitating development has proven to be a somewhat arduous task for the separated bureaucracies of the union states. To mitigate these issues, a unified planning office shall be established with the intention of streamlining the process and improving it to no end."

TBK_harmony_alliance_infrastructure:0 "Railway Gauge Uniformity"
TBK_harmony_alliance_infrastructure_desc:0 "The disparate railway gauges have proven to be problematic for transport between union states both in terms of civilian movement and goods transportation. Ensuring that these issues do not persist is as simple as making sure we all use the same convenient rail dimensions."

TBK_harmony_alliance_one_currency:0 "The Union Shekel"
TBK_harmony_alliance_one_currency_desc:0 "Much like our own federal currency, convenience and prosperity can be further ensured by introducing and utilising a broadly accepted union currency that will be far more reliable than local ones. What is a union without unity? What is prosperity if it isn't shared with all?"

TBK_harmony_alliance_fixed_rates:0 "Fixed Exchange Rates"
TBK_harmony_alliance_fixed_rates_desc:0 "Fixed exchange rates will ensure that no matter the circumstances, outside enterprises will have their investments guaranteed. We would be nothing without common faith in our economy and so the same must be true of our Hazrumenian family too."

TBK_harmony_alliance_central_bank:0 "Hazrumenian Central Bank"
TBK_harmony_alliance_central_bank_desc:0 "A central bank is just as important for a union of countries as it is for the constituent countries themselves. A place where loans and debts can be sorted out on a far grander scale will doubtless be useful for our growing Hazrumenian family."

TBK_harmony_alliance_agriculture_pact:0 "Shared Comission Of Agriculture"
TBK_harmony_alliance_agriculture_pact_desc:0 "Though not exactly an integral part of Hazrumenian development, agricultural growth is incredibly important for certain areas of the union in which food is considerably more scarce. An organisation for directing the expansion of the agricultural sectors within the union is a prudent solution."

TBK_harmony_alliance_cross_border_industries:0 "Cross-Border Industrial Development"
TBK_harmony_alliance_cross_border_industries_desc:0 "Parallel development of industries and infrastructure over constituent state borders is something that should be encouraged for the sake of cooperation between all parts of our Hazrumenian family. Who would willingly cut themselves off from industry and progress?"

TBK_hazrumenia_union:0 "Harmonious Hazrumenia"
TBK_hazrumenia_union_desc:0 "We have finally done it; one Hazrumenia under harmony, liberty and democracy! The years spent getting to this point have all been worth it to see our dream of a united Hazrumenian family fulfilled. Long live the union, long live the federation and long live harmony!"

TBK_dusk_labour_front:0 "United Labour Front"
TBK_dusk_labour_front_desc:0 "Ensuring that the common worker feels safe at home and work should be the ultimate goal of any worthwhile socialist nation; with happy workers comes a prosperous state, after all.

TBK_convince_temples:0 "Sanctuaries Of Communities"
TBK_convince_temples_desc:0 "The ponies of Chiropterra are afraid of what we will do to their temples now that we control them. Wallnut had originally wanted them all torn down, but Dusk Wane has managed to convince him that promising to rebuild and remodel them would lead to a more enthusiastic and agreeable populace."

TBK_old_teachings:0 "The Ancient Moon"
TBK_old_teachings_desc:0 "A thousand years of brainwashing isn't easy to overcome, and yet when you walk through the streets of New Ayacachtli something peculiar becomes apparent: Ponies are starting to feel less like Chiropterrans and more like citizens of the United Lands of Northern Zebrica. Perhaps in time they will overcome their deep-rooted obsession for Nightmare Moon in favour of the Old Moon as well."

TBK_communal_administration:0 "Out With The Old,\nIn With The Unions!"
TBK_communal_administration_desc:0 "As the workers of Chiropterra grow more and more accustomed to running things themselves, it is only sensical that their fledgling unions should be allowed more control over their daily lives. After all, nobody knows the workers' needs like they themselves do."

TBK_merge_faith_and_unions:0 "The Red Moon Edict"
TBK_merge_faith_and_unions_desc:0 "No more will the Nightmare hold dominion over this land! Let it be known that the Old Moon treats all equally, and so shall we as well! From the meekest of workers to the most respected of union members, all will enjoy a prosperous and more meaningful life!"

TBK_moonspeaker_union:0 "Federated Union Of Moonspeakers"
TBK_moonspeaker_union_desc:0 "After we made our intentions to preserve the temples of Chiropterra clear, a group of Moonspeakers informed us that they have created an organization which seeks to help the ponies of Chiropterra come around to Wallnut's administration. All they are asking for are funds to help rebuild the devastated parts of their communities and feed those that are suffering."

TBK_police_union:0 "Commune Constabularies"
TBK_police_union_desc:0 "Though we have achieved victory over the Legionnaires, there are still pockets of fanatical elites causing issues across the countryside. With Wallnut's approval, Dusk Wane will implement police reforms aimed at bringing these criminals to justice."

TBK_social_welfare_system:0 "Welfare Solidarity"
TBK_social_welfare_system_desc:0 "With a new nation comes new issues. Among them, poverty is a particularly severe problem that few like to think about. With the seizure of Chiropterra's treasury, putting some money into the hooves of those who truly need it shouldn't be too difficult."

TBK_extensive_aid:0 "Wholesale Aid"
TBK_extensive_aid_desc:0 "A society and state, no matter how just and righteous, will always have those who fall through the cracks.

TBK_jobs_network:0 "Work For Workless"
TBK_jobs_network_desc:0 "The poorest dregs of a society and state will often find themselves without work and thusly without any way to climb out of the depths in which they languish.

TBK_socialist_healthcare:0 "Communal Clinics"
TBK_socialist_healthcare_desc:0 "The concept of a community doctor is not a new one, but formalising the role of local specialists so that we may aid them with equipment and greater education will allow even the most serious injuries to be treated at a moment's notice without needing to travel to a city."

TBK_national_identity_card:0 "N.I.C"
TBK_national_identity_card_desc:0 "The National Identity Card system is certainly something that will take our citizens some getting used to. Despite what some may say, Dusk Wane has assured that its purpose is entirely organisational; the intention is to use them to keep track of places of work, marital status and other such things for the sake of record keeping."

TBK_good_food:0 "Superior Food, Superior Workers"
TBK_good_food_desc:0 "Despite our policy of food for all no matter the circumstances, it has been brought to our attention that some of the food going around might be better left uneaten.

TBK_confiscate_wealth_desc:0 "Though Chiropterra may have called them "Labourers", these poor ponies have suffered many injustices ranging from being torn away from their families to being forced to serve a goddess that they didn't believe in! The least we can do is offer them their own plot of land and a future that they can decide for themselves."

TBK_labour_union_formations:0 "For The Unions Make Us Strong"
TBK_labour_union_formations_desc:0 "Unions are the backbone of any true socialist nation. Though we have made this an important topic in several meetings, many workers still do not even understand the concept of a union. Dusk never liked propaganda, but he concedes that in this case helping the workers understand that they can support one another through unions is important."

TBK_power_unions:0 "Death Of Nationalism"
TBK_power_unions_desc:0 "For years many citizens of our nation have considered themselves loyal to Zarantia, even going so far as to refuse to fight against them. Times are changing now and the future we are working towards is brighter than that which any desert queen could ever hope to offer."

TBK_factory_production_councils:0 "Oust The Owners"
TBK_factory_production_councils_desc:0 "The cruel overseers of the former "Labourers" have had their say over the industrial sector for too long! Dusk has proposed that these individuals be removed and replaced with a council comprised of more humble workers in order to streamline production."

TBK_wealth_equalization:0 "Land Of The Equals"
TBK_wealth_equalization_desc:0 "If we are to be remembered for one thing then it must be this: Our citizens are treated equally. There will be none who feel as if their lot in life is unfair or unjust, for this land is that of the workers. After all, Wallnut himself said: "I want everyone to celebrate, not just my friends!""

TBK_workers_self_management:0 "Self-Managed Production"
TBK_workers_self_management_desc:0 "The time has come to extend the authority of the local worker councils. They will receive an expanded authority over legal and industrial processes, making them an integral part of our federal system. The workers shall finally control the means of production in full!"

TBK_land_electrification:0 "Shining Lights"
TBK_land_electrification_desc:0 "The electrification of our roads and cities is a logical next step for our industrial efforts. Infrastructure is the key to any great societal advancement and so we shall ensure ours is prepared for generations of future industrial and technological progress!"

TBK_modern_amenities:0 "The Broadcasting Union"
TBK_modern_amenities_desc:0 "It was not particularly difficult to convince the few media broadcasting companies that operate in the nation to combine their efforts as part of a new union. Wallnut especially appreciates the sentiment to improve the quality of aired and printed material alongside the benefits for socialist education."

TBK_communal_housing:0 "Communal Standards"
TBK_communal_housing_desc:0 "Communal estates or 'union housing' will provide our few unfortunate citizens with the basic living standards that they need to survive should all else inexplicably be lost. Indeed, as they provide an environment where certain facilities are shared, Dusk Wane speculates that they may even help the residents develop a communal identity."

TBK_labour_federalism:0 "Essay On Labour-Federalism"
TBK_labour_federalism_desc:0 "An excerpt from the paper puts it best, 'Socialism and progress are in the hooves of the workers; a federation of workers with equal rights, both positive and negative, is the best possible state structure in which that progress can be achieved. I am beholden to the workers as much as they are to one another.'"

TBK_labour_consitution:0 "Federal Bill Of Rights"
TBK_labour_consitution_desc:0 "The Federal Bill of Rights is not unlike other such legal documentation with regard to its general concept as a guarantor of individual rights and liberties. It is nevertheless different, enshrining additional rights like the right to protest and the right to work which many other 'progressive' state refuse to implement."

TBK_right_to_unionize:0 "Rights Of Unions"
TBK_right_to_unionize_desc:0 "Such a fundamental part of our society and state cannot be exclusive or limited to the established unions, the right to unionise for any reason and for all individuals should be guaranteed and enshrined. With the blessing of Wallnut, Dusk Wane should have no issues passing this integral piece of legislations."

TBK_wealth_of_land:0 "Plow The Land"
TBK_wealth_of_land_desc:0 "State investments in the agricultural industries are a logical next step in our industrial development. More food means more surplus, which can give us some extra to export or provide a greater ceiling for potential population growth in the near future."

TBK_rural_industries:0 "Outback Factories"
TBK_rural_industries_desc:0 "Wallnut has been convinced that small factory districts for local communities are efficient and desirable for the general public so that they don't have to make long journeys into more traditionally developed parts of the country to contribute to the economic growth and industrial boom of the nation."

TBK_farming_mechanization:0 "Tractor Collectives"
TBK_farming_mechanization_desc:0 "Wallnut has been convinced that large agricultural collectives are to be established to better distribute the machines and land between workers. This collectivisation should ensure equal opportunity for all agricultural workers whilst retaining a more efficient use of undivided land."

TBK_dusk_factories:0 "To Feed The Workers"
TBK_dusk_factories_desc:0 "A hungry worker is an unhappy worker, as any hungry citizen is an unhappy citizen. We must feed the means of production if we wish for them to produce and to innovate in our rapidly advancing nation; they shall never again have to worry about having to feed an empty stomachs."

TBK_union_militias:0 "Union Militia"
TBK_union_militias_desc:0 "As of yet, unions that take the form of militia organisations are somewhat of a legal grey zone with their regards to jurisdiction and where the use of force is considered appropriate. We shall legalise and regulate the process of militia creation on the condition that they are beholden to the army in times of war."

TBK_elected_commanders:0 "Elected Commanders"
TBK_elected_commanders_desc:0 "The militia units are well known for the democratic process through which they elect their own leaders. This is yet another grey area which we shall codify as common and accepted practice, following the condition that in times of war the army is responsible organising these leaders and their forces."

TBK_work_dusk:0 "Union Of Wallnut And Dusk"
TBK_work_dusk_desc:0 "After slow and careful consideration from our beloved Wallnut, Dusk Wane has convinced him that the logical course of action now is to bring him into his faction proper. To commemorate, Dusk has promised a party in the capital which even he shall attend, but more importantly he has ordered the media into overdrive in support of this move."

TBK_technological_industries:0 "Modern Industrial Production"
TBK_technological_industries_desc:0 "Technological progress under socialism is, in theory at least, utterly limitless. This is a fundamental tenet of our philosophy and so we will further the development of our lacking industrial equipment through imports, research funding and diligent work from scientists in order to further increase production."

TBK_electronics_industries:0 "Electronics Experiments"
TBK_electronics_industries_desc:0 "It seems there is more to the field of electronics than we first thought. With a dedicated research committee these machines may become our most valuable technological advancement, perhaps even leading the way to greater things than we can possibly imagine."

TBK_chemical_industries:0 "Synthetic Fuel"
TBK_chemical_industries_desc:0 "Whilst we are not necessarily opposed to trade with other nations, in the event of open war a home supply of oil and rubber may prove vital for our war machine. Wallnut in particular has expressed interest in these developments, citing his constant lack of resources as a warlord. Development and production will commence as soon as possible."

TBK_niftyn_start:0 "Legacy Of Steel Stallion"
TBK_niftyn_start_desc:0 "With the defeat of Chiropterra, Tobuck has become more than just another minor state in Zebrica. The work is far from done, however. Having convinced Wallnut to adopt a communist government, Niftyn must now create a vanguard to lead the newly formed United Lands of Northern Zebrica."

TBK_industrial_ministry:0 "Ministry Of Industrial Production"
TBK_industrial_ministry_desc:0 "For a worker's paradise to be achieved it is imperative that we create the means within the state to enable them in their quest to enlarge the means of production and to advance it. With Wallnut's approval, Niftyn has formally established the Ministry of Industrial Production with which he will guide the workers to greatness."

TBK_workers_state:0 "State Of Workers And Peasants"
TBK_workers_state_desc:0 "The federation is comprised almost entirely of workers and peasants. It is their nation, their land and their pride and the future which they are all striving to create. Greatness does not come to those who wait, it arrives precisely when the work is done in order to achieve it."

TBK_purge_parasites:0 "Values Of Class Struggle"
TBK_purge_parasites_desc:0 "There can be no peace with those who oppose the ponytariat and the revolution. Corrupt politicians, decadent nations and dissidents to the perfect form of communism shall all be crushed in the boot of our inevitable progress."

TBK_estate_collectivization:0 "Estate Collectivization"
TBK_estate_collectivization_desc:0 "Large holdings of land, be they personal or for business, are to be seized and redistributed to the citizens of our great state at once. Wallnut is in agreement that, if all should own a large amount of land, then all shall celebrate together in joy."

TBK_ponytariat_ownership:0 "Ownership Of The Ponytariat"
TBK_ponytariat_ownership_desc:0 "It is a fundamental tenet of the revolution that land should be given to the citizens of any communist state. Not only shall we put this into legal effect, but we shall additionally establish an economic commission to ensure that sectors of the economy cooperate for mutual benefit."

TBK_state_industrial_control:0 "Central Economic Directive"
TBK_state_industrial_control_desc:0 "The Federal Planning Commission has occasionally encountered difficulties when zoning areas for industrialisation thanks to other laws regarding the protection of certain land and buildings. We shall grant them greater powers to ensure that their work remains unhampered."

TBK_tobuck_arms_industries:0 "War-Economy Directive"
TBK_tobuck_arms_industries_desc:0 "To the delight of the Generalissimo, Niftyn has proposed a large expansion of military production to ensure that the state does not fall behind its neighbours in production capacity or stockpiles. The reactionaries shall not outgun us!"

TBK_artillery_production_bonus:0 "Red Star Artillery"
TBK_artillery_production_bonus_desc:0 "The affectionate title of 'Red Stars' originates from war stories that emerged after the victory against Chiropterra. In such low supply of ammunition, artillery was occasionally known to fire masses of flares into the sky or directly at the advancing enemy to stall for time. Though the story is indeed inspiring, perhaps it would be best to update and properly stock our artillery stores for future conflicts."

TBK_infantry_weapon_production_bonus:0 "New Model Battle Rifle"
TBK_infantry_weapon_production_bonus_desc:0 "Now that we are in a position to fund and improve on our previous designs, it has become apparent that our current stores of weapons are both old and worryingly diverse. Wallnut needed no convincing that a new and standardized weapon for the troops was necessary and Niftyn is happy to oblige."

TBK_niftyn_factories:0 "To Arm The Revolution"
TBK_niftyn_factories_desc:0 "In the unlikely event that our professional forces are overrun and defeated, it is the duty of the workers and peasants to pick up the slack. We will procure weapons for and train units of worker militia should they be needed in coming conflicts."

TBK_resource_aquisition:0 "Ministry Of Industrial Resources"
TBK_resource_aquisition_desc:0 "With the threat of blockades and a significant risk of reactionary trade warfare, it is only logical that a ministry be established to ensure that resources can always be provided for our heavy industry. Needless to say, Wallnut has accepted Niftyn's proposal to assist war production with open hooves"

TBK_expand_steel_production:0 "Increase Steel Quotas"
TBK_expand_steel_production_desc:0 "Steel is perhaps the most important resource for the continued development of our burgeoning industry. For that reason, production quotas will be increased for the most efficient plants and said plants will receive funding in order to expand their operations."

TBK_manerba_aluminium:0 "Manerba Bauxite Mines"
TBK_manerba_aluminium_desc:0 "Manerba has an impressive supply of aluminium that remains yet untapped in spite of the sizable mining operation there. With some funding and a little additional equipment the workers will begin extracting yet more of our vast wealth of resources."

TBK_rapid_urbanization:0 "Ministry Of Urban Development"
TBK_rapid_urbanization_desc:0 "In the modern era it is no surprise that modernising cities is a priority, but it has also become a very messy task thanks to the complexity of urban sprawl. To rectify this issue, Wallnut has signed off on Niftyn's proposal for a Ministry of Urban Development."

TBK_urban_fortifications:0 "Bunker And Shelters Directive"
TBK_urban_fortifications_desc:0 "With the introduction of aircraft into warfare, it is inevitable that bombers will try to reach our cities and tear them down. Though integrating an air defense network is impractical at this time, we can ensure that all future constructions made with hardier materials and that every building has a bunker."

TBK_federal_militia:0 "Federal Reserves"
TBK_federal_militia_desc:0 "These valiant workers and peasants are to be commended for their commitment to revolutionary ideals as part of their militia units. Unfortunately, militia organisations are notoriously unwieldy and may potentially represent a threat to both the state of the army; federal integration is the logical solution."

TBK_socialist_education:0 "Learn, Learn And Learn"
TBK_socialist_education_desc:0 "Wallnut has approved Niftyn's motion to begin an immense literacy campaign for the benefit of all. They must be able to lead themselves as we lead them now, for the revolution and for communism itself."

TBK_manual_lessons:0 "Hooves-On Education"
TBK_manual_lessons_desc:0 "There's nothing quite like a true hooves-on experience when it comes to industry and practical education. If we wish to train a new generation of workers and communists in the true trades of our state and ideology then it must be done properly."

TBK_military_education:0 "Lessons On War"
TBK_military_education_desc:0 "Though slightly hesitant at first, Wallnut has signed off on an extension and restructuring of the school curriculum to account for certain lessons in war and combat in order to better prepare the new generations for potential future conflicts."

TBK_communist_university:0 "Commissariat Of Education"
TBK_communist_university_desc:0 "Niftyn has proposed the next logical step in the advancement of the education system for the federation at large. With the introduction of a regulatory commissariat for education, we can improve and monitor the curriculum as time goes on for the benefit of all."

TBK_marks_institute:0 "Caramel Marks Institute"
TBK_marks_institute_desc:0 "Though we have done much for the education system of the federation, the high achievers have thus far received little attention. Wallnut has approved the construction of a new university in Tobuck that will provide the most talented communists with the best education that we can provide."

TBK_hazrumenia_communist_party:0 "Hazrumenian Communist Party"
TBK_hazrumenia_communist_party_desc:0 "Though our faction by now already has incredible influence in the administration, it would be best to formalise this power for the sake of keeping up appearances. Soon Niftyn shall announce the creation of the Hazrumenia Communist Party, a party for every worker and peasant."

TBK_soviets_model:0 "Lessons Of The Winter Revolution"
TBK_soviets_model_desc:0 "Centralisation of power is necessary for unity and efficiency within our worker's paradise. Local governments, or soviets as the are beginning to be called, will be given the powers to embark on revolutionary campaigns to imbue their regions with a zeal necessary to protect their fellow workers."

TBK_communist_secret_police:0 "State Security Council"
TBK_communist_secret_police_desc:0 "Those that seek to extinguish the flame of the revolution both internal and external deserve no quarter. Wallnut has approved the creation of the State Security Council, seeing the need to defend the revolution from all possible threats; operations to eliminate dissent and opposition will begin immediately."

TBK_state_mass_media:0 "The Truth"
TBK_state_mass_media_desc:0 "Mass media has long been an effective tool in swaying the population and with the introduction of radio it is now more accessible than ever. Niftyn has set about the creation of a national broadcast station and paper that will provide the workers and peasants with everything that they need to know."

TBK_expand_party_membership:0 "Join The Struggle, Worker!"
TBK_expand_party_membership_desc:0 "Unity through the masses may initially seem counter-intuitive, but the reality is that those we invite to the party will support it by default and Niftyn by extension. A recruitment drive is just what we need to ensure that divisions in the administration never even form in the first place."

TBK_orthodox_stallionism:0 "Orthodox Marksist-Stallionism"
TBK_orthodox_stallionism_desc:0 "Niftyn is a dedicated student of Marks and Steel Stallion. His dream for communism is the dream of the nation and of the workers; it shall be proliferated so that our great state may soon challenge the old order of decadence and reactionary thought, just as the great founders themselves dreamed."

TBK_first_hazrumenian_conference:0 "First Party Conference Of The HCP"
TBK_first_hazrumenian_conference_desc:0 "Publicity has always been the ally of the revolution, with Niftyn taking extra care to ensure that he and Wallnut as its vanguard make the most use of it. Prominent communists and the head of the party himself will speak of the glories of the Stallionist worker's utopia at this first conference."

TBK_new_style_tobuck:0 "Metropolis Of The Ponytariat"
TBK_new_style_tobuck_desc:0 "Tobuck has by now long been considered the centre for industrial and urban developments without our great state and the time has come to make the final steps towards the metropolis that all know it could become. It shall serve as a model for other cities within our federation as the beating heart of communism."

TBK_wallnut_stallionist:0 "The Steel Generalissimo"
TBK_wallnut_stallionist_desc:0 "Wallnut has done many great things for communism and for the creation of the federation. Niftyn and the party have seen fit to bestow the title of 'Steel Generalissimo' upon him to honour his service and commitment to the revolution; he has of course accepted with immense gratitude and with the intent to celebrate."

TBK_stalliongrad_south:0 "Stalliongrad Of Zebrica"
TBK_stalliongrad_south_desc:0 "We are the home of the revolution in Zebrica and so we shall adopt a policy of ideological vanguardism on the continent. There are none that can hold such a magnificent and well-earned title as this and none that can take on the responsibilities that such an important position entails."

TBK_party_hq:0 "Headquarters Of The Revolution"
TBK_party_hq_desc:0 "It is a great honour to die for one's ideal of communism. A propaganda wave centering on the enemies of that very ideal as a justification for coming conflicts will work wonders for the population's attitudes towards a large-scale war to be waged against the reactionaries."

TBK_control_militia:0 "Militia Commissars"
TBK_control_militia_desc:0 "It is finally time to remove the remaining semblances of independence that were granted to the militia divisions. Commissars will be assigned to their units and they will serve just the same as any other professional division, though they will of course remain portrayed as public militia for the sake of recruitment."

TBK_marksist_state:0 "Marksist-Stallionist Constitution"
TBK_marksist_state_desc:0 "It is finally time to draft a completed constitution for our worker's paradise. As Steel Stallion and Marks themselves knew, a centralised and powerful state is necessary to protect the rights of all workers and this all-important document will reflect that proven fact in its contents."

TBK_work_niftyn:0 "Party Of Wallnut And Niftyn"
TBK_work_niftyn_desc:0 "After a significant amount of time spent in discussion, Niftyn has managed to convince Wallnut to officially join the communist party. It's not the sort of party that the Generalissimo is used to, but he's adapting well to his new role as the face and 'leader' of the revolution."

TBK_dusk_niftyn_meeting:0 "Socialist Hazrumenia"
TBK_dusk_niftyn_meeting_desc:0 "The time has come to solidify influence and codify ideals once and for all within the political factions of this great socialist state. The battle for the socialist dream is finally over."

TBK_wallnut_communist_diplomacy:0 "The Wallnut Declaration"
TBK_wallnut_communist_diplomacy_desc:0 "As the perceived leader and vanguard of the revolution, it is Wallnut's job to make all declarations regarding war and coming conflicts. The time has now come for such a declaration as we are finally ready to liberate the workers chained within the decadent societies that surround us."

TBK_territory_warzena:0 "Shatter The Crown Of Warzah"
TBK_territory_warzena_desc:0 "The gormless monarchists of Warzena believe that their 'reforms' will save their decadent society from collapse; oh how wrong they are. We shall greatly speed up this process by tearing it down and rebuilding it ourselves."

TBK_drive_out_nobles:0 "End The Leopard Line"
TBK_drive_out_nobles_desc:0 "There remains another remnant of the Warzenan monarchy besides the previously ruling king. The Leopard dynasty is scattered and comparatively unimportant, but not powerless; it is imperative that we deal with them before the remnants of the monarchists flock to the old rulers of Warzena."

TBK_spread_collectivization:0 "Fresh Rural Collectives"
TBK_spread_collectivization_desc:0 "With the implementation of actual reforms in Warzena such as the proliferation of new rural collectives in the region, the zebras there will be far more agreeable once we have shown them the errors of their ways. This will no doubt speed up the integration of the region greatly."

TBK_communist_core_warzena:0 "Federal District Of Mayrzim"
TBK_communist_core_warzena_desc:0 "A lot can be done with a little renaming and a lot of administrative restructuring; namely the complete incorporation of a once monarchist state into a socialist one. An impressive feat to be sure, and one that the residents of Mayrzim will be very thankful for indeed."

TBK_internationale_connections:0 "The Global Struggle"
TBK_internationale_connections_desc:0 "What is a socialist state without embracing a policy of internationalism and global agitation? There has been no better time for us to export our revolution abroad to the best of our great ability."

TBK_home_of_revolution:0 "Home Of The Revolution"
TBK_home_of_revolution_desc:0 "Truly we are what Stalliongrad has not yet become after the passing of our ideological forefathers, a global stage upon which the revolution may be touted and given out freely. The decadent world shall tremble when faced with the might of the federation!"

TBK_assess_hippogriffia:0 "Assess Hippogriffia"
TBK_assess_hippogriffia_desc:0 "The hippogriffs represent perhaps the greatest threat to our great paradise. Their island is defensible, their military prowess renowned and their fighters feared; but they shall not best our revolution this day."

TBK_red_zumidia:0 "Red Zumidia"
TBK_red_zumidia_desc:0 "Zumidia is an integral component in reaching our natural borders and thus it shall be an integral part of the federation. None shall oppose our liberation of the workers that have languished for so long under hippogriffian tyranny."

TBK_colthage_defences:0 "North-Eastern Fortifications"
TBK_colthage_defences_desc:0 "Colthaginian rhetoric has continuously proven hostile no matter the regime in power. We are wise and wary of their designs on Zumidia and of their ambitions, making fortifications along the border a logical choice for our defensive strategy."

TBK_maregypt_war:0 "Return To The Source"
TBK_maregypt_war_desc:0 "Tobuck was originally built by the Maregpytians; they are as much our brethren as any creatures and shall not be forgotten by the federation or the Hazrumenian dream. Niftyn in particular has shown great interest in saving his homeland from decadence, but all concur that Maregypt shall be free!"

TBK_international_war:0 "Hazrumenian Liberation Front"
TBK_international_war_desc:0 "There's no more noble aim than to strive for the freedom of others and such is the policy we will adopt during our great battles to come; a policy and doctrine of socialist liberation against the reactionary forces that stand opposed to our inevitable victory!"

TBK_revolutionary_spearhead:0 "Revolutionary Spearhead"
TBK_revolutionary_spearhead_desc:0 "Armour is not simply a useful propaganda tool, but also an effective component of a modern fighting force. We can give the divisions in which they are used both a name and a true purpose in the revolution!"

TBK_territory_zarantia:0 "Scatter The Tribes"
TBK_territory_zarantia_desc:0 "The time has come to deal with the tribes that once shunned us, kicking Tobuck to the wayside in order to avoid the wrath of the Storm King all those years ago. The federation does not forget their treason, nor does it intend to allow Zarantia to persist."

TBK_end_sedentary_life:0 "Enforce Sedentary Life"
TBK_end_sedentary_life_desc:0 "Nomads are incredibly difficult to sway for a number of reasons, chief among them is that their society has no concept of a national identity or unifying ideology. If we wish to make progress with them, then we must settle them first."

TBK_end_old_hierarchies:0 "Abolish The Aguellid"
TBK_end_old_hierarchies_desc:0 "The tribal title of Aguellid no longer holds any meaning or relevance to our great nation. We shall abolish it to make way for more appropriate positions in government and the administrative restructuring of the region."

TBK_communist_core_zarantia_desc:0 "A lot can be done with a lot of administrative restructuring and careful reeducation; namely the complete incorporation of a once tribalistic 'state' into a socialist one.

### Wallnut military tree

TBK_guerilla_army:0 "Free Forces Of Federation"
TBK_guerilla_army_desc:0 "If the warlord era has proven anything, it's that traditional warfare is not the future in armed conflicts. The size of a force is not necessarily a deciding factor in victory, particularly if we embrace the ideas of a decentralised command structure to maximise the effectiveness of individual commanders."

TBK_special_forces_focus:0 "Wallnut's Finest"
TBK_special_forces_focus_desc:0 "Since his warlord days, Wallnut has always had a soft spot for the special forces. Fortunately it is an affection worth investing in and thus funding has been allocated to improving their combat effectiveness."

TBK_shadow_strikes:0 "Shadow Strikes"
TBK_shadow_strikes_desc:0 "Force concentration is a defining feature of modern doctrine, which makes it something worth investing in.

TBK_book_irregular_warfare_desc:0 "In what most consider a surprising move, Wallnut has published a memoir of his days as a mercenary leader. It's framed largely as a biographical novel, but every now and then an actually very useful method of conducting guerrilla warfare can be found."

TBK_spread_officer_experience:0 "Experience Amongst Ranks"

TBK_modern_arms_technology:0 "Weapons Of War"

TBK_armour_investment_desc:0 "The Chiropterrans didn't do a lot of things right, but war was one thing at which they were horribly efficient. Reclaiming and developing upon their designs will provide us with valuable theory on the use of armour as well as a potential production model."

TBK_courtly_advisors_desc:0 "As an integral aspect of pursuing royal favour, the nobles will be required to act as the eyes and ears of the Zamal in and around the royal court. They are to be his tools and his assistance in thanks for the special notice he gives them."

TBK_rural_governors:0 "The Hooves And Mouth Of The Zamal"
TBK_rural_governors_desc:0 "A nobility without true positions within the administration of the nation are doomed to once again fall out of favour and as such must be placed as local figures of import beyond merely their landed holdings in order to guarantee a sustainable relationship between the people and the nobility."

TBK_nobility_rights_desc:0 "Despite the initial intention of our beloved Zamal to bring the nobility back to the ways of old, there is a newfound uniqueness to their role as a vital part of our Hazrumenian society. In many ways the nobility is reinvigorated, in others it is reborn entirely."

TBK_priests_role_desc:0 "Not all priests seek a return to the old ways, but they need not fear for their institution.

TBK_temple_schools_desc:0 "Warzena has never had an effective education system, nor one that provides equal opportunity for future generations.

TBK_privileges_royalty_desc:0 "Much as our beloved Zamal has many important official duties, it is likewise his responsibility to embody the wealth and opulence enjoyed by all of Neo-Hazrumenia.

TBK_great_palace:0 "Azibaragzen"
TBK_great_palace_desc:0 "The capital has seen better days. It is for this reason that the Zamal has decided to expand a nearby royal estate outside of the capital, to be aptly named Azibaragzen.

TBK_courtly_arts_desc:0 "An unexpected side effect of Azibaragzen's construction and the subsequent concentration of important individuals is the sudden influx of artists and creative types.

TBK_zamal_restorer:0 "The Great Restorer"

TBK_noble_conclave_desc:0 "Whilst they may be largely opposed to democratic order, the new nobility now understands that they must coordinate and agree upon similar goals to ensure their continued power underneath our beloved Zamal.

TBK_ranks_of_life:0 "The Places Of Life"
TBK_ranks_of_life_desc:0 "One cannot fight against the place in life has that has been given them. The nobility understand this and know that - though they themselves are at the behest of their beloved Zamal - they see that they too have much to rule. Some in society are born to hunt and others are born to be hunted, some are intellectuals and others are imbeciles. This is simply reality."

TBK_capitol_nobility:0 "Serene Court Of The Azibaragzen"
TBK_capitol_nobility_desc:0 "The royal court, to the suprise of nobody, has already become a hotbed of scheming and competition as they all attempt to gain the favour of the Zamal. Needless to say that this has had some unintended, though not entirely negative, side affects for Neo-Hazrumenian society as a whole. Their power grows and their competition drives progress."

TBK_noble_innnovation_industries:0 "Noble Innovations And Competition"
TBK_noble_innnovation_industries_desc:0 "Something rather curious that most do not realise about the the high nobility, is that they are considerably more beneficial for the state that they may at first appear. In their pursuits of money, favour and power they have innovated and expanded businesses as well as the influence of our beloved Zamal."

TBK_positions_court:0 "Many Positions Of the Court"
TBK_positions_court_desc:0 "Though an arduous endeavour, the time has come to create a table of ranks that dictates each courtly role and position with respective duties. With such a vast court, every creature within it must know their place from lowliest servant to the direct advisor of our beloved Zamal. Even some enterprising and talented commoners may have a chance to gain favour here."

TBK_most_noble_zamivgazal:0 "Most Noble And Grand Zamivgazal"
TBK_most_noble_zamivgazal_desc:0 "With an influx of so many great families of nobility both big and small, the Neo-Hazrumenian Empire has managed to entirely renovate the capital. Estates dot both the inner city and the fields outside of the old walls. Architects compete for their patrons in constructing unique and spectacular mansions whilst factories have provided work for many commoners. All this in service of our beloved Zamal."

TBK_commoner_patronage:0 "Commoner Patronage"
TBK_commoner_patronage_desc:0 "As of late, a peculiar but genius system of quid-pro-quo business has begun to develop between the nobility and the common people. In return for a job, protection and some benefits, a commoner swears themself to the service of a noble house. Using this method, a noble family can get exclusive access to certain specialists or expertise while denying such to their competitors."

TBK_noble_totalitarian_espionage:0 "Zamal's Eye Sees All"
TBK_noble_totalitarian_espionage_desc:0 "The nobility is very much aware of the common discontent and - though their internal disagreements may slow action - are also of the opinion that something should be done. With the help of modern technologies to collect data amongst the public, a propaganda wave in honour of our beloved Zamal will clear all remaining doubts and leave the remaining dissenters as easy pickings."

TBK_rural_nobility:0 "Landlords Of The Zamal"
TBK_rural_nobility_desc:0 "The nobility have fundamentally altered the way in which their administration functions to be far more decentralised and local. Whilst the civil administration is the be-all and end-all on all matters, the many lords and ladies are now local sources of authority in their own domains, developing and ruling them as they see fit. While some have failed, many have been exceptional."

TBK_renew_priesthood_alliance:0 "Calm the Temples"
TBK_renew_priesthood_alliance_desc:0 "As the power of the nobility grows, so does the discontent amongst the priesthood who themselves are largely comprised of commoners. However, much to their probable pleasure, the nobility recognises that the temples are the domain of the divine and shall not meddle in their realm. The priests may rest easy, knowing that Zal and Zanit shall remain safe in their hooves."

TBK_priestly_advisors:0 "Priestly Advisors"
TBK_priestly_advisors_desc:0 "The time has come to welcome the priests into the Serene Court of Azibaragzen so that they may act in the interests of the temples and as representatives of the common people that live under their care. Though this has left the more protective and power hungry nobles unhappy, many traditionalists and conservatives alike welcome their presence as a means to balance the court."

TBK_priestly_landlords:0 "Divine Domains"
TBK_priestly_landlords_desc:0 "Much as the nobility have a measure of autonomy within their personal holdings, we must extend this right to the lands held by temples and their workers. This will likely cause some problems amongst the harsher landlords - some have even claimed that they will hire mercenaries to make sure their tenants don't trot off to the safety of the temples - but many welcome this stabilising change."

TBK_gods_academy:0 "The Temple Of Piety And Reason"
TBK_gods_academy_desc:0 "Thanks to the unprecedented increase in donations from more welcoming noble individuals, the temples have a considerable amount of unspent wealth. The head priest and priestess of the Great Temple have agreed the gold shall be used to establish a new place of worship dedicated to education; not just to train priests but to teach the commoners."

TBK_domain_autonomy:0 "Whose Land, Her Word"
TBK_domain_autonomy_desc:0 "The success of the landlord initiative has spurred our beloved Zamal to further extend the autonomy of the landlords. Now the rural nobility have autonomy to conduct themselves however they see fit in their domains, at least as long as tithes are paid and the assigned representative of the Zamal does not intervene."

TBK_spread_the_fields:0 "Endless Fields And Plantations"
TBK_spread_the_fields_desc:0 "Food and farming as a whole have always been the lifeline of any great state and so it is a matter of national importance that produce is readily available. It is for this reason that the formerly desolate lands of the empire will be hoofed over to enterprising nobles in the hopes that they will transform the land into a litany of farms and plantations."

TBK_commoner_dues:0 "Commoner's Dues"
TBK_commoner_dues_desc:0 "Life as a rural commoner in the Neo-Hazrumenian Empire is both harsh and fair. If a creature obeys their local noble and listens to their beloved Zamal, they will never starve and can live in peace. Those who are artisans may even expect a comfortable life serving the nobility more directly, but those who oppose the order will be punished harshly."

TBK_serfdom:0 "Return Of Old Order"
TBK_serfdom_desc:0 "The increased autonomy and privileges of rural nobles has led to clashes with the commoners under their care. The representatives of the beloved Zamal have at times intervened to put an end to the worst cases of abuse, however there are rumours that some nobles bribe their representative so as to act however they see fit. All the same, the commoners have fallen in line and serve readily."

TBK_agricultural_industries:0 "Industrious Nobility"
TBK_agricultural_industries_desc:0 "A considerable number of nobles have been of the especially industrious sort; building state-of-the-art mills, distilleries and other factories to process the crops grown on their land. This has led to expansion of previous villages into proper townships, with craftszebras joining the rural commoners within landlord domains. This is the first many have seen of industry; all thanks to the Zamal."

TBK_united_against_commoners:0 "United In Support And Fear"
TBK_united_against_commoners_desc:0 "All nobles and all priests understand that the monarchy as it exists has serious flaws and is causing considerable discontent amongst the masses. Unfortunately their alliance with the crown means that they too will be ousted, should there be a popular revolution. To that end, cooperation in service of the Zamal is a necessary evil in order to maintain their own status."

TBK_for_zamal_and_empire:0 "For Zamal And The Empire!"
TBK_for_zamal_and_empire_desc:0 "It is an error on the part of the commoners to view the empire as anything but theirs. All of the beloved Zamal's subjects are part of the empire's glory and the reason for its successes. Even the mightiest of machines is nothing without the smallest cogs or rivets, nor is army a reliable force without the many soldiers that must fight in it. They are all Neo-Hazrumenians."

TBK_keep_baragzen_busy:0 "Keep The Zamal Busy"
TBK_keep_baragzen_busy_desc:0 "It seems that whenever our beloved Zamal gets an idea or even the slightest hint of a desire for something, a catastrophe occurs. The high court will intensify their efforts to keep Baragzen busy with smaller things, though most importantly out of sight. If he's been invited to private noble holdings, then at the very least the commoners will struggle to get a good look."

TBK_terrorize_enemies:0 "Sow The Seeds"
TBK_terrorize_enemies_desc:0 "If there's one way to demonstrate loyalty, it's to kill anyone that opposes our beloved Zamal and prove yourself. The nobility understands this well and has carefully planned out a series of targeted attacks against prominent anti-Zamal resistance members whilst drowning out the potential discord with a propaganda campaign against such traitors."

TBK_preach_stability:0 "Tranquil Status-Quo"
TBK_preach_stability_desc:0 "None can deny that in its core parts, the empire has brought stability and peace to the lives of many who might have otherwise perished in war. Any revolutionary activity that arises shall be painted as breaking that peace which the common people and our beloved Zamal have worked so hard to achieve. The fires of revolt and chaos can only lead to an unknown future."

TBK_empire_management:0 "Bureaucracy Of Neo-Hazrumenia"
TBK_empire_management_desc:0 "Dull as it may seem to be, we really do need a new administration if we wish for our regime to survive. The 'reformists' in Warzena are deeply rooted and great instability remains, new institutions and a restructuring of the government should improve the situation vastly."

TBK_territorial_bureau:0 "Bureau Of Imperial Territories"
TBK_territorial_bureau_desc:0 "One of the most pressing concerns facing the newly established empire is the simple fact that the bureaucracy lacks the capacity to properly administer the land. It is imperative that we rectify this difficult situation in order to properly integrate and connect the isolated communities within our borders."

TBK_finance_ministry:0 "Department Of Finances"
TBK_finance_ministry_desc:0 "Bureaucracy is never a cheap affair, especially as the Zamal requires a portion of state funds for himself. Vasile has therefore dictated that a new department be formed, one dedicated to the expansion of the economy via new industrial zones and further development of resource extraction efforts."

TBK_tobuck_industrialization:0 "The Custodianship Modernization Program"
TBK_tobuck_industrialization_desc:0 "Though Tobuck is small by the international standards of city sizes, it is nevertheless larger and more developed industrially than Zamivgazal and should receive special treatment as such. The industrious ponies there shall have state support in the financing of further industrial development!"

TBK_civil_wardens:0 "The Public Wardens"
TBK_civil_wardens_desc:0 "With approval from our beloved Zamal, Vasile has dictated the formation of a Herzland-styled police force as a subordinate branch of the royal guard. These new Public Wardens shall be responsible for the safety of the general public, whilst wearing a fez of course."

TBK_anti_corruption:0 "Anti-Corruption Policy"
TBK_anti_corruption_desc:0 "For whatever reason, the public has already begun to spread rumours of corruption and upper-class collusion! We shall establish the Public Wardens to root out such heinous behaviour, so long as no associates of the Zamal or Vasile show up on any lists of course."

TBK_royal_chancellery:0 "The Royal Chancellery"
TBK_royal_chancellery_desc:0 "In its long and storied history, Warzena's kings and queens have always had a great many advisors; but never one above the rest. To ensure stability to generations to come, Vasile will establish the Royal Chancellery with the blessing of our beloved Zamal in order to oversee civil affairs."

TBK_subjugation_of_cities:0 "Subjugation Of The Cities"
TBK_subjugation_of_cities_desc:0 "Our beloved Zamal and the chancellor will not suffer any discontented murmurs from these urban upstarts, they will not receive any special privileges merely for being one group amongst an empire of so many loyal subjects! Their land belongs to His Majesty by imperial decree!"

TBK_rights_of_cities:0 "Rights Of The Cities"
TBK_rights_of_cities_desc:0 "Though the Zamal has much to gain from personal ownership of the cities, such places are far more complex and difficult to manage in modern times. They will be granted relative autonomy under the guiding hoof of His Majesty, so long as they can behave and prosper."

TBK_royal_dictatorship:0 "The Overlord Code"
TBK_royal_dictatorship_desc:0 "The time has come to codify the powers and responsibilities of our beloved Zamal. He shall have ultimate authority on all matters, control over the civil services over the army; none shall oppose his right to rule the Neo-Hazrumenian Empire."

TBK_media_ministry:0 "Bureau Of Information"
TBK_media_ministry_desc:0 "Many of our subjects are noticeably less-than-loyal and a considerable minority of others barely even know who's running things. We will make sure all within the borders of Neo-Hazrumenia hear of their Zamal and of his brilliance through the power of media!"

TBK_loyalist_propaganda:0 "We Love Our Zamal!"
TBK_loyalist_propaganda_desc:0 "How can anyone dislike our beloved Zamal? Despite how confusing such a sentiment truly is, the public seem not to be fully convinced of his incredible mind and impressive prowess. This calls for action! The state media cannot simply let such a horrid train of thought stand like this!"

TBK_royal_cult_of_personality:0 "The Mighty Leopard Watches Over Us!"
TBK_royal_cult_of_personality_desc:0 "Now everyone truly loves His Majesty, so much in fact that he seems to have garnered a particular fan following of especially devoted subjects. It would be a shame not to encourage such behaviours just a little more, after all the work we've done for the image of our beloved Zamal."

TBK_most_loyal_servant:0 "Throne's Most Loyal Servant"
TBK_most_loyal_servant_desc:0 "For having much less of the spotlight, Vasile has gained a considerable position of social standing amongst His Majesty's subjects as a talented administrator. The people can rest assured that the chancellery remains in good claws with their favourite griffon."

TBK_hide_royal_corruption:0 "Corruption? Hedonism?\nNothing But Lies!"
TBK_hide_royal_corruption_desc:0 "Thanks to his continued acts of utter gluttony, pride and lust it has become progressively harder and harder to hide the scandals caused by our 'beloved' Zamal. All the same, Vasile will do his best to clean up and muddy the waters of rumours as they spread; he has a job to do, after all."

TBK_keep_baragzen_alive:0 "Keep The Fat Bastard Alive"
TBK_keep_baragzen_alive_desc:0 "Baragzen's days are numbered and anyone with half a brain is more than capable of deducing that from the amount that he eats and drinks alone. For Vasile however, he is more useful alive than dead so as to hide his influence from both the nobility and the public. He just needs to keep the fatso around for a little longer, or hide the scandals a little better."

TBK_baragzen_diet:0 "Royal Dietician"
TBK_baragzen_diet_desc:0 "Though it is obviously impossible to stop our beloved Zamal from ordering as he pleases, we can at least reduce the potential damage to his gut with a Royal Dietician to ensure that whatever he has the opportunity to consume is a little healthier. It won't prevent damage, but it should slow his inevitable demise."

TBK_baragzen_breastplate_stretcher:0 "Royal Breastplate Stretcher"
TBK_baragzen_breastplate_stretcher_desc:0 "There is no point in attempting to tackle Baragzen's diet, but there is something we can do to hide his gut from the commoners. It's not exactly an orthodox solution, but then the Zamal is far from orthodox himself; according to the many concubines in his household anyway."

TBK_harsh_zamal_censorship:0 "Department Of Royal Honour"
TBK_harsh_zamal_censorship_desc:0 "Though not a serious solution in the long term, a new department for scrutinizing and censoring the Zamal's more extreme failings will slow the tide of popular discontent. It's obviously not a foolproof system - nothing could hide all excesses now - but it will help at least a little."

TBK_wonders_of_new_millenia:0 "Wonders Of New Millennium"
TBK_wonders_of_new_millenia_desc:0 "Despite it's fascination with the past, the Neo-Hazrumenian Empire has managed to proliferate new technologies and ideas across the land through conquest and - ironically - the spreading of reactionary political thought. The nobles may never cease finding this entertaining."

TBK_imperial_monopolies:0 "Imperial Investment And Industrial Council"
TBK_imperial_monopolies_desc:0 "Whilst private enterprise has done some good for the steady industrialisation of the empire, Vasile considers this growth to be disappointing and ultimately inefficient. To that end it's only logical that he establishes an advisory council to oversee the creation of state corporations and acquire non-competitive companies."

TBK_hazrumenian_gilded_age:0 "Great Golden Chain"
TBK_hazrumenian_gilded_age_desc:0 "Vasile has recently coined a new term to be used for the economic prosperity of the empire: the Great Golden Chain. Each subject of the state, nobles and commoners alike, are but links of one immense chain that is formed from the collective individual wealth and work bringing forth overall prosperity. It does, however, omit the unequal distribution of the aforementioned wealth."

TBK_royal_urban_domain:0 "The Concrete Domain"
TBK_royal_urban_domain_desc:0 "Thus far, the status of cities as personal domains of the throne has left them stagnant and slow to change with little purpose beyond generating profit for our beloved Zamal. Now, however, Vasile will put his incredible mind to giving the urban areas a purpose as great sources of commerce and industry for the good of the empire and the Zamal."

TBK_zamals_industries:0 "The Throne Incorporated"
TBK_zamals_industries_desc:0 "Given the sheer quantity of acquired companies, it has become too much of a hassle to organize and maintain all the confiscated factories ourselves. Therefore all but the most important assets shall be resold to new owners, but as subsidiaries under one united name and its royal benefactor."

TBK_ensured_supplies:0 "Privileged Access"
TBK_ensured_supplies_desc:0 "An unforeseen benefit that has resulted from the re-arrangement of the confiscated industries is that whilst they are privately owned, the state has a special permission to contract them or order the production of certain items en masse; all the while reaping the benefits of taxes on goods from every single purchase. The throne has never had so much money!"

TBK_royal_monopolies:0 "Royal Monopolies"
TBK_royal_monopolies_desc:0 "Now that the extraneous companies are no longer our problem, the key businesses which remain under the throne's ownership are far easier to manage. To protect the fortunes of Zamal, the state will grant certain privileges and protections to these businesses in order to stamp out any potential competition with some level of legal immunity."

TBK_urban_seneschals:0 "Urban Seneschals"
TBK_urban_seneschals_desc:0 "Our beloved Zamal was never much of an administrator and, as the cities grow and the role becomes more challenging for an individual, Vasile has elected to make some improvements. The new body of seneschals will be formalised, composed of capable commoners from the civil administration that now offer their skills and services to the throne."

TBK_mend_ties_middle_class:0 "Render Unto Zamal"
TBK_mend_ties_middle_class_desc:0 "The relationship between the throne and the urban middle class is still precarious following the revocation of their autonomy. However, some have already seen the wisdom in leaving their misgivings to rest. With the Zamal's blessing, the seneschals will work to create new ties with the middle class with a promise that no harm will come to them as long as they give to Zamal that which is Zamal's."

TBK_tobuck_stronghold_loyalty:0 "Stronghold Of Loyalty"
TBK_tobuck_stronghold_loyalty_desc:0 "The ponies of Tobuck have not wavered in their support of our beloved Zamal and the empire as a whole, even as discontent arises elsewhere. The custodianship of Tobuck is a stronghold of loyalty and therefore it must be rewarded. It shall have its own vizier to help manage things, and Vasile has a just the pony in mind for the job."

TBK_university_tobuck_desc:0 "As a result of Tobuck's position as the empire's industrial heartland, there's an everpresent need for workers with knowledge and experience to maintain new machines elsewhere.

TBK_caravan_priviliges_desc: "We will grant trans-Zebharan trading privileges to select loyal merchants. With the infrastructure of our Realm supporting them, soon they will bring back great wealth to our nation."

TBK_invasion_ports: "The Grand Dockyards"
TBK_invasion_ports_desc: "In order to properly compete with the hippogriffs, we must dramatically expand our dockyards and commission a vast fleet of innovative new vessels. Soon they will no longer be the sole power in North Zebrican waters..."

TBK_battleship_ponymkin: "Battleship Ponymkin"
TBK_battleship_ponymkin_desc: "The Tsaritsa has approved the secret construction of the largest, most powerful battleship the world has ever seen: the Battleship Ponymkin. Soon all will stand in awe at our might."

TBK_long_range_submarines: "Long-Seas Submarines"
TBK_long_range_submarines_desc: "We have commissioned a new fleet of twelve top-of-the-line submarines to harass and drain the trade routes of our enemies."

TBK_zarantia_integration: "Shizra Confederation"
TBK_zarantia_integration_desc: "The Zarantians are known as an ungovernable people, but that is not so. Their confederal model can be coopted with a few promises and a few bribes to the right zebras, so long as we do not expect them to show more loyalty than simply paying their admittedly-low taxes and fighting in our armies."

TBK_zebra_cossacks: "Imperial Yasani"
TBK_zebra_cossacks_desc: "Zarantians have a strong mercenary tradition and a long history of nomadism. By recruiting select Zarantian tribes to serve as mobile border patrol units, affording them extra pay and the right to wear distinctive culturally-inspired uniforms, we can get a rapid-response force capable of bringing the most distant frontiers off our realm to heel."

TBK_nationalism: "Fidelity"
TBK_nationalism_desc: "Every subject of our realm must be true to their Tsaritsa, to their homeland, and to its traditions. It is only through a strict Fidelity to these things that a nation remains strong and free of decadence."

TBK_old_chiropterran_governance: "Territories Of Old Order"
TBK_old_chiropterran_governance_desc: "Chiropterra is a proud and mighty land, with its own traditions of governance built up over a millennium of struggle and sacrifice. We will integrate it into our tsardom as the Realm of Chiropterra, and while there is much to be done to smooth out the contradictions in Chiropterra, we shall endeavour to leave as much of that venerable state intact as possible."

TBK_remnants_tobuck_government: "Ruins Of Late Republic"
TBK_remnants_tobuck_government_desc: "The Republic of Tobuck was a wretched place, and not only because it was a republic. But against all odds, its denizens pulled through and won what was supposed to be an impossible victory. We will integrate them into our tsardom as the Grand Duchy of Tobuck, forever honoured as the people who delivered our Tsaritsa to her throne."

TBK_tsarist_order: "Her Imperial Sovereign's Lands"
TBK_tsarist_order_desc: "The Tsaritsa's rule extends not only to the people of Novaya Severyana, but to the soil as well. We will not collectivize as the red scum do, nor guarantee private property as the snivelling Harmonists do. All land in the Grand Duchy of Tobuck and the Realm of Chiropterra shall be legally owned by Tsaritsa Alesia, to be held and used by her assent."

TBK_tsaritsas_hoof: "The Tsaritsa's Hoof"
TBK_tsaritsas_hoof_desc: "The Nightmare's Hoof was one of the finest, if not the finest spy agency in the world. We should find the agents of this noble institution and recruit them back into the fold, so that the enemies of the Tsaritsa will never be able to keep secrets from her."

TBK_military_agents: "On Foreign Mansions"
TBK_military_agents_desc: "The Tsaritsa's Hoof should focus its efforts on foreign intelligence, as the Nightmare's Hoof did before it. This will give us an edge in any future conflicts, whether against our neighbours or against the communist worms occupying Severyana."

TBK_public_purpose: "On Home Streets"
TBK_public_purpose_desc: "The Tsaritsa's Hoof should focus its efforts on domestic surveillance. That way it can function as a powerful tool to root out corruption, dissent, and all other things which would weaken the state and the reign of the Tsaritsa."

TBK_codex_alesia: "Alesia Pravda"
TBK_codex_alesia_desc: "Tsaritsa Alesia has introduced a new code of laws to rationalize, streamline, and simplify the complex legal codes which have accumulated over the last milennium in Chiropterra, as well as bringing the once-lawless Grand Duchy of Tobuck in line with the standards of law and order of our realm."

TBK_labour_reform: "Issue Of Labourers"
TBK_labour_reform_desc: "The Chiropterran Labourers do not fall neatly into our societal structure. Recognising this, the Tsaritsa now deliberates over what is to be done with this misbegotten caste of workers."

TBK_chiropterran_tone: "The New Homeland"
TBK_chiropterran_tone_desc: "Despite our differences, the Tsaritsa has seen it fit to induct members of the Chiropterran elite into her court. Their experience in economic centralism and social engineering on a mass scale make them uniquely qualified for our new administration."

TBK_autocracy: "Autocracy"
TBK_autocracy_desc: "Ultimate temporal authority must be invested in a single ruler, and it is irrevocable save by the decree of the Nightmare Herself. The great pyramid of authority must have a summit, and that summit must be a single autocrat, for a divided state cannot stand."

TBK_severyan_tone: "The Old Severyana"
TBK_severyan_tone_desc: "Thus far the expatriates from Severyana have proven themselves invaluable in the construction of the new administration. It is only fitting that they should be rewarded for their marvellous work and that we should further expand the repatriation program in order to facilitate future expansions of the state."

TBK_social_elements: "Elements Of Imperialism"
TBK_social_elements_desc: "While the Equestrian Elements of Harmony are partially responsible for weakening Severyana and leaving it open to communism, the fundamental idea of enumerating a set of virtues as guiding principles for the state is a good one. We will enumerate our own set of "Elements," to act as the moral guides for the Tsaritsa's government."

TBK_element_order: "Element Of Order"
TBK_element_order_desc: "The Element of Order refers to the fundamental value in obeying your superiors, following orders, and respecting the hierarchies you live under. It is distinct from the Equestrian Element of Loyalty because it does not orient itself around on personal connections, but around strict duties."

TBK_element_will: "Element Of Will"
TBK_element_will_desc: "The Element of Will refers to the virtue to be found in imposing your will upon the world, and therefore lends itself naturally to the captains of industry as well as the high officials of state."

TBK_state_capitalism: "Charter Of Corporatives"
TBK_state_capitalism_desc: "Whilst incredibly efficient, the economic model that the Chiropterrans have made extensive use of is not entirely appropriate for the subjects of the Tsaritsa. Much of the state-controlled industry shall be split between existing corporations with the intent to decentralise, if only slightly, the stratocratic methods of our new citizens."

TBK_military_industries_focus: "Arms For The Empire"
TBK_military_industries_focus_desc: "We will continue the Chiropterran policy of manufacturing only such consumer goods as are absolutely necessary. The bulk of our industry shall go towards supplying the legions."

TBK_establish_civilian_sector: "Products For The Subjects"
TBK_establish_civilian_sector_desc: "Our Tobuckian subjects are not used to the austere life the Chiropterran legionnaires lived. Accordingly, we will use some of our industry to manufacture consumer goods for our subjects to keep them happy, well-fed and prosperous."

TBK_element_honour: "Element Of Honour"
TBK_element_honour_desc: "The Element of Honour refers to upholding the duties and dignity of one's station with upright zeal. It differs from the Element of Honesty in that the meaning of Honour is heavily dependent on your social station: the Honour of the labourer is to work, while the Honour of the soldier is to fight, and the Honour of the Tsaritsa is to rule."

TBK_crown_scouts: "Organisation Of Moon Rangers"
TBK_crown_scouts_desc: "Chiropterran youth are largely left to their own devices, their parents and local youth programs entrusted to instill good values in them. While this worked well when Chiropterra was a thousand year old stratocracy, given recent cultural changes it would be best to centralize these youth programs to ensure they inculcate not only faith in The Nightmare, but also a zealous devotion to the Tsaritsa."

TBK_element_authority: "Element Of Authority"
TBK_element_authority_desc: "The Element of Authority refers to the central importance of leaders to recognize their own right to lead, granted by the Tsaritsa, and not to shy away from doing what it takes to maintain proper hierarchy and respect for superiors."

TBK_loyal_education: "Faithful Curriculum"
TBK_loyal_education_desc: "Our school curricula must teach the true history of our tsardom: from the glory of old Severyana, to the fall at the hooves of the sun and the communists, to the parallel exiles of the Nightmare's Legions and the Tsaritsa herself, to the glorious present and the bright future."

TBK_diploma_program: "Imperial Diplomas"
TBK_diploma_program_desc: "We will standardise our higher education program, collecting the qualifications of our realm's best and brightest into a system of imperial diplomas. This will streamline scientific research significantly."

TBK_arch_enemy_communism: "Death To Marksism!"
TBK_arch_enemy_communism_desc: "There was one pony in history more evil than the usurper Celestia. Her name was Caramel Marks. Not only does her doctrine deny the Nightmare's right to rule, it denies monarchy itself and seeks to destroy all the noble traditions of this world. Marksists are anathema, and there is no higher honour than to destroy the red devils."

TBK_severyan_curriculum: "Severyanian Language Act"
TBK_severyan_curriculum_desc: "We will fund new courses to teach Severyanian in our schools, with those who have completed Severyanian courses given a competitive edge in attaining promotions in the government and military."

TBK_table_nobility: "Ranks Of Nobility"
TBK_table_nobility_desc: "Tsaritsa Alesia has ordered a census of the noble families of Chiropterra, such that the accumulated privileges and duties of the last thousand years can be collected, defined, and standardized into a clear ranking scheme."

TBK_traditonal_social_order: "Traditional Social Order"
TBK_traditonal_social_order_desc: "For all the laudable discipline of their military hierarchy, Chiropterran civil society is distressingly egalitarian. Other than a few aristocratic families whose role is mainly honourary, the faithful are largely treated as equals. We must rectify this situation by codifying hereditary social castes with distinct rights and responsibilites, all working for the glory of The Nightmare and the Tsaritsa."

TBK_severyan_culture: "Love Of Severyana"
TBK_severyan_culture_desc: "Severyanian culture was a magnificent thing, blending together elegance and austerity, form and function, bombast and tranquility. That was before the usurper Celestia diluted it and the communist iconoclasts destroyed it. And yet it shall be again: we shall organize festivals and holidays to inculcate in our people a love of Severyana's traditions and beauty."

TBK_severya_primacy: "Severyana Above All!"
TBK_severya_primacy_desc: "Through hard work and careful social engineering, we have brought back Severyanian culture from the brink of extinction. Though the communists would see it slain, we have brought Severyanian traditions back, stronger than ever!"

TBK_spirit_of_alexander: "Spirit of\nAlexander Snezhinsky"
TBK_spirit_of_alexander_desc: "In honour of our glorious ancestor, we will raise two new "Snezhinskaya" divisions of Druzhina from the former legionnaires of mighty Chiropterra."

TBK_absolute_authority: "Her Will Be Done"
TBK_absolute_authority_desc: "As The Nightmare's chosen, Tsaritsa Alesia rules through divine right. Her word is the law of the land. Her every order shall be understood as the will of the realm, to be followed as unquestioningly as if The Nightmare Herself had willed it."

TBK_ursagrad_capital: "My Snezhnograd"
TBK_ursagrad_capital_desc: "Ursagrad occupies a key position between the Chiropterran Realm and the Grand Duchy of Tobuck, and its history as being founded by the Severyanian Ursa Legion would reinforce that aspect of our Tsardom's character. Many inhabitants even speak an ancient dialect of Severyanian. Tsaritsa Alesia shall make Ursagrad her capital, renamed in honour of her glorious ancestor Alexander Snezhinsky."

TBK_royal_patronage: "Arts Of The Court"
TBK_royal_patronage_desc: "Tsaritsa Alesia does not hoard the wealth of the realm as Griffon kings do. She has taken it upon herself to uplift a new generation of patriotic artists with her patronage, so that the splendour of Novaya Severyana may be reflected in works of transcendent beauty."

TBK_royal_example: "Through Her Example"
TBK_royal_example_desc: "Tsaritsa Alesia has no tolerance for decadence or waste. While her palace shall be grand, its decorations shall be strictly devotional, and she herself shall be clad in an austere uniform at all times. Through her example, our subjects will learn to stay clear of the wastrel's vices."

TBK_court_tsaritsa: "Court Of Stars"
TBK_court_tsaritsa_desc: "The Tsaritsa will set up a grand throneroom, where she will hold a magnificent court that one day will beggar even that of the usurper Celestia. Foreign dignitaries and Novaya Severyanian nobles alike will be in awe of the Court of Stars."

TBK_palace_estates: "Tsaritsy Polya"
TBK_palace_estates_desc: "We will develop the fertile lands around our palace as the personal demesne of the Tsaritsa. It will provide for her vast household, as well as covering a significant portion of the expenses of state."

TBK_severyan_customs: "Grand Winter Gala"
TBK_severyan_customs_desc: "The tsars of Old Severyana would host great galas on the longest night of the year. They would invite all the nobles and a few lucky commoners to their palaces, where they would put aside their differences and celebrate the beauty of winter and of the night. We shall revive this tradition, and invite the nobles of Chiropterra to pay homage to the Tsaritsa and the Nightmare."

TBK_safeguard_communities: "Rights Of Commoners"
TBK_safeguard_communities_desc: "Communist filth claim that by enforcing a class system we are guaranteeing poverty. Like everything else they say, this is a lie. The commoners shall be cared for, and so long as they fulfill their duties, they need never know hunger."

TBK_priviliges_aristocracy: "Duties Of Aristocracy"
TBK_priviliges_aristocracy_desc: "In Griffonia, perhaps, or under the usurper Celestia, the aristocracy are lazy layabouts sucking the bloated corpse of the state. Not in old Severyana, not in Chiropterra, and not in Novaya Severyana. The aristocracy will have important martial duties to fulfill, with the lesser gentry fighting in the Legions and the higher nobles using their wealth to support the army."

TBK_imperial_bureaucracy: "Bureaucracy Of The Tsardom"
TBK_imperial_bureaucracy_desc: "We will extend our bureaucracy to govern every portion of our realm, to ensure that all proceeds according to the will of the Nightmare and the command of the Tsaritsa."

TBK_resurrected_severyana: "Severyana Has Endured!"
TBK_resurrected_severyana_desc: "Against all odds we have not only preserved what we once thought lost in Severyana, but we have revived it in the most glorious fashion. The light of our homeland burns bright, fuelled anew by our revanchism and loyalty to the Tsaritsa and the Nightmare!"

TBK_perfect_synthesis: "Perfect Synthesis"
TBK_perfect_synthesis_desc: "In spite of the great challenges we have faced, there now exists a unqiue and unbreakable bond between Chiropterran and Severyanian culture and society. Though there is much left to be done, the Tsaritsa's loyal subjects will never again consider themselves separate; we have achieved an ideal unlike any other."

### Military post-tree

TBK_republic_armed_forces: "Army Of The Republic"
TBK_republic_armed_forces_desc: "Tobuck was never really meant to act as a real country but here we are. We have nothing but bodyguards, mercenaries and scared conscripts next to a mish-mash of guns and not always assorted ammunition. Time to make an army out of it. But we'll manage. How hard can it all really be?"

TBK_construct_military_academy: "War College Of Tobuck"
TBK_construct_military_academy_desc: "Well. Since we no longer rely on mercenaries and shall we say decentralized forces, we need to learn and teach how to maintain and organize an army. Now. We can't afford to go slow and meticulously build a proud and long-standing officer corp tradition. Time for some crash courses!"

TBK_quality_leadership: "Strength Through Quality"
TBK_quality_leadership_desc: "When in war, you need to learn what your strengths and vulnerabilities are. So while we are not that small of a country, we will be outnumbered. However, by focusing on training a good officer corps, we can make sure that our proficiencies in weaponry are used in the most efficient way possible. No waste of bullets or ponies!"

TBK_additional_manpower: "Fill The Ranks"
TBK_additional_manpower_desc: "When outnumbered, the best bet is to try and even the score. So there are more of them than there are of us but by the transitive properties of us knowing how to get our hooves on a lot of guns and ammos, we should be able to make sure that we kill enough of them so that we can take them! That's math. Who ever said that war was hard?"

TBK_magic_ponies: "War Can Be Magic Too!"
TBK_magic_ponies_desc: "Northern Zebrica is hardly a center of magical knowledge but we do have unicorns. Now granted, very few of them have even shown an inkling towards violence and normally, that would be good. However, we'll need to teach them to go from magical cake making to battlefield shield generation if we want to get an edge in the trenches."

TBK_radio_development: "Radio R&D"
TBK_radio_development_desc: "Our enemies have had years to prepare for an invasion and they'll have a slew of tactics to take us on. So we need to establish clear and excellent lines of communication for our units if we want to be able to adapt quickly and safely! Lucky for us, our smuggler friends know a thing or two about radio and encrypted communications!"

TBK_standard_rifles: "Commission New Battle Rifle"
TBK_standard_rifles_desc: "Now here's a conundrum, how do gun runners arm a standardized army? Well the answer is that it's a nightmare. You need factories, ammo, a supply line and all of it needs to be efficient with a much lower profit margin. But we made our bed and we need modern rifles if we want to kill whoever wants to lay in that bloody bed!"

TBK_new_leaders: "In Service Of The Republic"
TBK_new_leaders_desc: "With the warlords gone, we need to build up the Republican Guard and quickly. But more importantly, we need sane and loyal ponies to lead it. We're going to need to do a whole lot of performance review to find somepony capable in that sorry lot of an army. I mean, we are looking for the best of the best! Which is still a low bar here."

TBK_hire_griffonian_experts: "Hire Griffonian Instructors"
TBK_hire_griffonian_experts_desc: "When it comes to war, you can never go wrong with hiring some Griffonian veterans. That continent has been in turmoil ever since somegriff lost a trinket and Kemerskai broke everything. Some of them must surely be interested in working in a warmer climate for some exceptional pay. Just make sure the other officers don't learn how much."

TBK_establish_national_militia: "Rapid-Response Militia"
TBK_establish_national_militia_desc: "Without mentioning the internal risks to the republic neither Zarantia, Warzena nor Chiropterra can be described as being thrilled with our continued existence. With such angry neighbours, we need help. Let's set up local teams of minuteponies with some basic training and equipment to hold off the enemy until the army can arrive to even the odds."

TBK_plan_militia_resistance: "Militia Battle Order X1"
TBK_plan_militia_resistance_desc: "The minuteponies can only do so much and so we need to accept that they'll fold if the army is delayed in any way. So let's work with that knowledge. Rather than sell an idea of fighting to the death to simple citizens, we'll instruct them to disperse before it's too late, disturb enemy movements and support refugees so as to not clog the roads and bridges."

TBK_army_grand_battleplan: "Central Army HQ"
TBK_army_grand_battleplan_desc: "The entire Republic rests upon a single center of command. If Tobuck falls, there is no hope of falling back. Therefore, our entire military doctrine must be to delay, stop and destroy anything that is on its way towards the capital. "

TBK_proper_trenches: "Shovel In Every Hoof"
TBK_proper_trenches_desc: "They say that there are two kinds of ponies: those who dig and those who have a gun. What they forget is that there's a third kind of pony: the one who pays. So you get both a shovel and a gun and if you want to live, you better dig those trenches like there's no tomorrow! We're not running a playground here!"

TBK_special_engineer_training: "Special-Engineer Courses"
TBK_special_engineer_training_desc: "It turns out that simply digging trenches is not as easy as it sounds like. There's a whole art in standardizing them and making them fit for combat, housing and logistical support. We better start selecting a few lucky ponies who will get the prized honor of supervising others doing the digging."

TBK_fortification_program: "Fortress-Republic"
TBK_fortification_program_desc: "Tobuck was never in the spot of defending itself and it shows. We won't be safe without some massive investment into our infrastructure. We need military depots, casemates, forts in any strategic positions and most importantly, the means of moving our troops and equipment around quickly and efficiently."

TBK_killzone_tactics: "Killzone Tactics"
TBK_killzone_tactics_desc: "With our limited supply of soldiers, we will have holes in our lines but we can transform this weakness into a strength by drawing our enemies in less defended open fields where we can blaze them from our stronger positions and then mop them up using our few mobile units."

TBK_masterwork_trenches: "Impenetrable Defence"
TBK_masterwork_trenches_desc: "We have a solid basis but we need to do more if we want to have any chance of withholding a major offensive. Send concrete to the trenches. Plant landmines in the killzones. Improve coordination between the artillery and the field engineers. Make every inch of terrain a Tartarus to go through! The line must hold!"

TBK_army_superior_firepower: "Battlefield Destruction"
TBK_army_superior_firepower_desc: "The Republic was born in a pile of guns surrounded by ponies who knew how to use them. This is where we came from and this will be how we prevail through the worst of storms! More guns. More firepower. And make sure they'll only pry them from our cold dead hooves!"

TBK_introduce_cannons: "Discard The Bombards"
TBK_introduce_cannons_desc: "Too many of our soldiers are still accustomed to old artillery pieces better suited for a museum than for the battlefield. It's partly on us as Pea Shooter ordered the best cannons to be sold internationally. Well, that's over. Soldiers? Forget about blackpowder, smoke and cannonballs. Meet the shell and the howitzer. Ain't they a beauty?"

TBK_anti_armor_aid: "Pierce All Armour"
TBK_anti_armor_aid_desc: "The tank is all the rage nowadays. It'll be a long time for us to have the industry to produce them reliably for domestic use. However we can learn how to penetrate them. And if we do, that's where we'll be happy to be a small country. There'll be no going around for them. So let's wreck some armor!"

TBK_endless_steel_rain: "Explosive Forecast"
TBK_endless_steel_rain_desc: "A good cannon can hit a target and kill it. A better cannon will hit multiple targets at once and make sure that they're either dead or unfit for combat. And that my friends is how a small country negates the power of demographics. Hey, you! I hope you brought an umbrella!"

TBK_chemical_deterrence: "Chemical Deterrence"
TBK_chemical_deterrence_desc: "At some point in time, in a wretched place, the very worst of matchmakers had the idea of bringing chemistry and ballistics together. However, in Tobuck, we've learned to make the best out of the worst and we'll be damned if we're not making good use of anything that makes our guns deadlier. Now, carry those barrels with care."

TBK_proud_army: "Proud Foals Of \nThe Republic"
TBK_proud_army_desc: "It was a difficult endeavour but we've never been afraid of difficulties. Now, a new generation of ponies is entering the barracks of the Republican Army of Tobuck and what they are finding isn't a slapped-together mess anymore. The era of warlords is well and truly over. Now stands an army, proud and strong!"

TBK_warlords_army: "Warlords Of Tobuck"
TBK_warlords_army_desc: "Hey, warlords aren't so bad. Keep 'em paid, keep 'em armed, and they'll fight for anycreature, even a crook like Vasile. Pea's problem was he was a cheapskate who paid them all ad hoc and never signed a decent contract. That won't be an issue for us."

TBK_army_mobile_warfare: "Relentless Pursuit"
TBK_army_mobile_warfare_desc: "A decentralised mercenary force can move as fast as tartarus if given the right incentives. No need for elaborate chains of command, just offer a bonus to the first ones to the fight, and to any lower-level officer who shows daring and initiative. Boom. Instant blitzkrieg."

TBK_increase_military_production: "State Military-Industrial Complex"
TBK_increase_military_production_desc: "We need some proper factories if we're gonna make all this equipment. Yes, it'll be expensive, but absolutely nothing has a higher long-term profit margin than weapons."

TBK_trucks_galore: "Faster Than Anypony"
TBK_trucks_galore_desc: "You know what's faster than a speeding pegasus? A speeding truck. Let's motorize as much of our army as we can. It'll let 'em maneuver faster it'll let 'em carry more gear, and it'll let 'em carry off more loot once the fighting is done. So long as they give us a cut for the truck..."

TBK_add_armour_to_trucks: "Protect The Engines"
TBK_add_armour_to_trucks_desc: "Bullets and gasoline don't mix. Fortunately, we have a lot of scrap metal and a lot of ponies who'd be willing to do some dubiously-safe welding work for a quick buck. Who said making armoured vehicles was hard?"

TBK_get_some_tanks: "Hire The Gryphon Company"
TBK_get_some_tanks_desc: "There's armoured vehicles, and then there's proper armour. For that, we gotta pay. Fortunately, Vasile has some contacts in Griffonia who have some proper hardware. Let's see if the bats and their fancy training can get through this..."

TBK_raider_trucks: "Leave 'em In Dust!"
TBK_raider_trucks_desc: "Our mercenaries have really taken to these trucks! They've given them names, spraypainted all sorts of things on them, and upgunned them well beyond the bounds of common sense. Firepower, mobility, and a symbol to rally around: what's not to love?"

TBK_army_mass_assault: "Lust For Loot"
TBK_army_mass_assault_desc: "If there's one thing Tobuck has a limitless supply of, it's greed. They've all seen how rich you can get off scavenging and gun-running, so if we give them the cheapest guns we can find and then promise to let them pick their foes (and their friends!) clean, we'll barely have to pay 'em!"

TBK_actual_guns: "Locked And Loaded"
TBK_actual_guns_desc: "So what if Pea Shooter sold most of the Storm King's old guns? Who needs 'em? I heard you can put together a submachine gun out of piping and sheet metal in a backyard welding shop. Oh, fine, we'll also buy some rifles. What is Tobuck coming to that we have to import weapons?"

TBK_abundant_recruits: "Everyone's A Mercenary"
TBK_abundant_recruits_desc: "Can you hold a gun? Would you hold this one? Would you stand over there and shoot anypony who comes near for a few bits? Congrats, you're a mercenary! Who knew recruitment could be so simple?"

TBK_frenzied_horde: "Drugs And Booze For All!"
TBK_frenzied_horde_desc: "You mix some old-fashioned black powder into rum, that's pirate's brew. You mix some smokeless powder and cocaine, that's brown-brown. You drink some pirate's brew and snort some brown-brown, you'll be the most fearless pony alive!"

TBK_glory_to_deluge: "What's Yours Is Mine!"
TBK_glory_to_deluge_desc: "We're declaring open season on the enemy's... everything. The promise of unrestricted plunder will attract more lowlifes and rabble to our army, and nothing's more dangerous than a low-life with a gun and a motive."

TBK_victory_celebrations: "Endless Triumphs"
TBK_victory_celebrations_desc: "Hired guns love being told they've done a good job. We'll festoon them with medals, shower them with booze, and pretty soon our army will have the best morale in Zebrica!"

TBK_bring_abord_new_folk: "The Warzenan Fellows"
TBK_bring_abord_new_folk_desc: "What's better than a mercenary band willing to work for you? A mercenary band with an infamous leader who's willing to work for you, that's what! This 'Captain Z' might need some time to adjust, but new blood is always welcome!"

TBK_gather_weapons: "Grab All The Guns"
TBK_gather_weapons_desc: "There's more than enough guns still stashed in Tobuck to arm our forces, we just have to find them. Search the houses, order of the president. Search the sewers, the junkyards, search and grab every firearm and every bullet you can find!"

TBK_mercenary_gunsmiths: "Knick-Knack Smiths"
TBK_mercenary_gunsmiths_desc: "Mercenaries love their weapons, and they love personalising and customising them. Some spend so much time on their weapons, they become better gunsmiths than the actual gunsmiths! We should offer these fellows new jobs, away from the front lines, making weapons for their old squadmates."

TBK_capture_machines: "Grab Some Vehicles"
TBK_capture_machines_desc: "We've got cutpurses, we've got congriffs, we've got bandits, and soon enough we'll have carjackers too! We'll send our troops out to "acquire" some vehicles, doesn't matter the condition, and refurbish them into supply trucks and troop transports."

TBK_organised_scavenging: "Organised Scavenging"
TBK_organised_scavenging_desc: "Why make when you can take? We will gather the gunsmithing gurus of the mercenary bands together, and create a set of manuals on how best to scavenge and refurbish captured equipment, whether you got it from the enemy or a scrapheap or your own grandmother."

TBK_payment_policy: "Specify Payment"
TBK_payment_policy_desc: "We have a lot of mercenary contracts, and the last thing we want is to accidentally break one of them through carelessness. That's how you get shot. We'll gather together the bookkeepers of the republic's bureaucracy and some of our old money launderers to keep track of all these contracts, making sure our payments are on-time and dependable."

TBK_drive_up_recruitment_desc: "Why die for patriotism when you can die for money? Okay, that's a bad way of putting it, but it's the core of our sales pitch. Soldiers of more legitimate states struggle to get by and have to follow rigid discipline. In Tobuck, you get all the benefits of going bandit without anycreature calling you a bandit! Not to your face at least."

TBK_hill_warfare: "Hire The Tefe-Band"
TBK_hill_warfare_desc: "Mountain specialists? Well, Tobuck doesn't have many mountains... Ah well, they'll probably be useful for something in the future; let's hire them and get what expertise we can!"

TBK_jungle_warfare_desc: "Jungle runners will certainly have their uses in the... The very expansive jungles of Tobuck. Hmm. Well, guerrilla warfare experts are always welcome here; let's bring them into our big mercenary family!"

TBK_desert_warfare: "Hire The Zodh Duners"
TBK_desert_warfare_desc: "Now, desert raiders are going to really help us out. Frankly it's incredible that we hadn't hired creatures with skills already, but there's no time like the present to finally plug a hole in our forces' capabilities!"

TBK_gather_shared_experiences: "Shared Tales And Pains"
TBK_gather_shared_experiences_desc: "If there is one thing that can be garnered from pain and suffering, it is how to avoid experiencing it a second time.

TBK_rough_scarred_desc: "What we lack in professionalism we make up for in experience and our soldiers have the scars to prove just how much they've seen and done. Our bands are mighty regiments of battle-hardened soldiers, inspiring fear in their enemies with their brutality and discipline."

### Air Force tree

TBK_air_force_start: "First Air-Platoon"
TBK_air_force_start_desc: "Just because Tobuck was known for having lots of guns doesn't mean that we can't try to do other things with them! If we can find some planes and tape our guns to them, suddenly we'll have a real airforce!"

TBK_air_superiority_focus: "Battles In The Clouds"
TBK_air_superiority_focus_desc: "With our fledgling airforce, it is important that we train our pilots to choose their battles. Prioritize picking off the weaker enemy aircraft and avoiding the line of fire from stronger ones, and not only will they live to see another day, but they'll get better at completing their missions too!"

TBK_ground_support_focus: "Assault From Above"
TBK_ground_support_focus_desc: "Shooting down to the ground is just as important as shooting at other planes. Our future CAS pilots must undergo some additional training in order for their duties to be performed in an acceptable manner."

TBK_cas_planes: "Close-Air Support Designs"
TBK_cas_planes_desc: "Of course, all the training in the world will do no good if there's no plane for our specialized pilots to fly. We've managed to scrounge up some blueprints to a basic support plane. With some study, maybe our engineers can build a better one in the future."

TBK_aquire_more_fighters: "Establish Additional Squadrons"
TBK_aquire_more_fighters_desc: "Whilst it pains the treasury to spend money even at the worst of times, if we are to create an airforce from near-scratch then we must purchase planes to fill the ranks. At least we can probably get them on credit and barely notice a dent in the coffers!"

TBK_naval_bombers: "Green Bay Bomber Wing"
TBK_naval_bombers_desc: "Unfortunately for us, one of the things we may have to worry about is having our ports blockaded. Coincidentally, one of our engineers has come up with quite the solution: A new type of bomber designed specifically to destroy ships."

TBK_air_academy: "Air Weapon Tactics"
TBK_air_academy_desc: "What luck! A former "laborer" from Chiropterra has approached us and claimed that she used to be one of the best pilots in Equestria of all places. She's asked for safe passage back to her homeland. [FROM.GetLeader] has agreed to do this, but in exchange, she will give some lessons to our pilots."

TBK_bomber_developments: "Bomber Plane Designs"
TBK_bomber_developments_desc: "There's been a new development lately: According to one of our advisors, a huge focus of our neighbors has been on developing better and more devastating bombers. After hearing of this, [FROM.GetLeader] has ordered that we also focus on designing better bombers so that we do not get left behind."

TBK_air_force_final: "Aces of Northern Zebrica"
TBK_air_force_final_desc: "Tobuck! Known for our supply of guns, but also now known for our... still fledgling air force! We've even begun to attract some aviation experts from other countries. We have come a long way in such a short time, but there's still much more to learn as we continue building a proper air force. At least our pilots can match the skill of our more developed neighbors."

TBK_air_assembly_line: "State Aircraft Company"
TBK_air_assembly_line_desc: "Surprisingly enough, a fledgling business devoted to aviation has popped up recently. Perhaps with some investment, we could convince them to help maintain our planes. Some of our aircraft have had some trouble holding themselves together mid-flight anyways."

TBK_radar_development: "R.A.D.A.R"
TBK_radar_development_desc: "Radios, communication of the future! And apparently great for getting an idea of what the enemy is up to, as well! Maybe we could get a few of these fancy new towers built around Tobuck if someone bothered to make some blueprints for them."

### Navy Tree

TBK_navy_start: "Piers Of Tobuck"
TBK_navy_start_desc: "What do you mean our docks were only meant for trade? That's preposterous, the Storm King had used Tobuck as a weapons depot, it's only sensible that our shipyards be used for war as well."

TBK_cruiser_focus: "Open Maneuver Plans"
TBK_cruiser_focus_desc: "It's especially important in naval warfare to know who is doing what since the stakes are so high at sea. A few classes for our aspiring seafarers should help keep them coordinated so that they can better navigate around and protect one another."

TBK_submarine_focus: "Beneath The Waves"
TBK_submarine_focus_desc: "Shooting your enemy from afar is preferable. Shooting them while they can't see you is better. If our sailors can keep both of these tactics in mind, we will surely come out victorious in any engagement!"

TBK_naval_academy: "Cadet Academy"
TBK_naval_academy_desc: "It has come to our attention that very few of our seafarers actually possess the know-how to properly run a ship. Like it or not, they'll have to sit down and learn a few things if they want to sail the seas."

TBK_ship_dockyard_expansion: "Grand Naval Shipyards"
TBK_ship_dockyard_expansion_desc: "As we build more and more ships, we've begun to attract some of our citizens who hadn't shown any interest in the seas until recently. If we give them a place to work and some lessons to go with it, we'll have some of the finest shipwrights in Zebrica, maybe even the world."

TBK_battleship_designs: "Floating Fortress"
TBK_battleship_designs_desc: "As we make progress towards establishing our navy as a formidable force, the need for capital ships to spearhead them has become increasingly apparent. We don't expect to make many, but it would be an insult to our population if we didn't at least try."

TBK_destroyer_designs: "Small Ship Designs"
TBK_destroyer_designs_desc: "Destroyers! They make up the bulk of most navies, and ours will be no exception. First though, we'll need to actually put together a decent design for one. Somewhat recently, a destroyer from Maregypt had wrecked itself near our coastline. Maybe we can study that."

TBK_submarine_designs: "Submarine Hulls"
TBK_submarine_designs_desc: "Submarines! The silent killers of the sea. They're infamous for the amount of damage they can inflict upon bigger ships. It only makes sense that we should invest in them, seeing as some of our neighbors have larger navies than ours."

TBK_cruiser_design: "High Seas Aircraft Deployment"
TBK_cruiser_design_desc: "Land-based airports have their uses, but mobile airports, ones that we can launch air raids from at nearly any location? Those can be incredibly useful. The fact that they can be heavily armored is a huge bonus. We still need to design them, of course."

TBK_navy_final: "Rule The Waves"
TBK_navy_final_desc: "Tobuck! Known for our supply of guns, but also now known for our... still fledgling navy! We've come a long way in such a short time, but there's still more to learn and discover as we become a real player in the sea. At the very least, our sailors can go hoof-to-hoof with the very best from across the world."

### Events ###

tobuck_start.1.t:0 "The Meeting"
tobuck_start.1.d:0 "Menes was not a diplomat, nor was he an individual of particular repute beyond his status as a trader; but he would suffice as a messenger for the desert queen. He sat calmly in front of Pea Shooter's desk, quietly relaxing in the seat after a long day of market work and discovering exactly what was going on in the city that was supposed to belong to his liege.\n\nTo nopony's surprise, his enquiries had quickly received notice from the minister of foreign affairs. "I assume then, that Mekiouzza will have less-than-savoury opinions of our... operation here in Tobuck?"\n\nThough he could have picked his words more carefully, it was perhaps a far better choice to be honest with one who would deliver his word to another that could invade at any time. There was no reason to lie, especially given his plans to return their land once he was through with this half-desert tartarus of a city state. Even then, it wasn't as though this trader would reveal his plans to the rest of the republic.\n\nThe zebra nodded, a grim look on his face. "I'm afraid so. She will be furious that you have set hoof in what she considers to be her territory, and I am inclined to agree. However, I believe that I may be able to provide the time you seek; albeit through grovelling and reminders of our ancient customs. At most I can assure you a year."\n\nPea's guest relaxed a little further, apparently well versed in schmoozing with the right equines. He was certainly brave to try, if nothing else.\n\n"A year... Yes, yes that should be more than enough to run the operation and vacate the region when Her Majesty comes knocking." He agreed, extending a hoof. "You have my thanks."\n\nMenes smiled and shook it, rising from his seat to leave himself. "I hope this place can grant what you desire.""
tobuck_start.1.a:0 "No time to waste."

tobuck_start.2.t:0 "At The Offices"
tobuck_start.2.d:0 "It had been a while since Ghaith had properly taken a moment to think about all the changes that were being implemented around her. The zebra worked tirelessly as a civil servant, filing paperwork day in and day out just to try and make ends meet at home; but things had become rather odd as of late.\n\nFor one, the national guard had recently become responsible for transporting her documents around and making sure they found the right creatures. Of course, they were seemingly doing a fine job of it; but the question remained as to why the civil servants around her were no longer responsible for them. It wasn't as though they had just had a big workplace turnover, at least to her knowledge anyway. Perhaps they just needed more security.\n\nWith that said, something else that had been rather strange was the meeting with her boss just the day before. That pony was a fairly heavy drinker, but she'd never seen him utterly pissed at work before. Ghaith had to assume that she was simply stressed, which was understandable given that they seemed to be beset on all sides by hostile states; but that behaviour from him - however sensical she could make it - was still unexpected.\n\nThe zebra stamped another document and sighed."
tobuck_start.2.a:0 "Perhaps she was simply imagining things."

tobuck_start.3.t:0 "President Of The Republic"
tobuck_start.3.d:0 "It wasn't often that Pea Shooter and Giggle Juice actually spoke about important matters, but then it wasn't as though the former needed the counsel of the latter; usually he only needed his services. This case was - to nopony's surprise - no different. Pea was a fastidious planner and a careful deliberator, but not a diplomat or even a good partygoer. That was where the President came into the picture.\n\nThe foreign minister leaned over his desk with a serious expression, making the just-barely sober pony in front of him a little nervous. "I have a very important task for you Giggle. You're going to think it's scary at first, but I can guarantee that you'll enjoy it when you start."\n\n"Uh... Alright then, what will I be up to sir?" He asked tentatively, for once entirely sober and coherent. "Sounds interesting, at least."\n\nPea leaned back again and allowed himself to chuckle slightly at that response, standing up and trotting slowly over to a large wooden cabinet. As he opened its doors and began to rummage; putting something, or several somethings, into a basket just out of view.\n\n"Well, I need you to talk to the warlords for me. I know, I know; you don't like them very much, but they're an integral part of our republic and its commitment to freedom for all. They defend us to the utmost, and I need you to show them a good time for all their hard work. Can you do that for me? For all of us?" He asked with a subtle warmth to his voice, revealing a large collection of very expensive alcohol as he returned to the table.\n\nGiggle's expression had sunk at the mention of the warlords, but had quickly perked up again after seeing such a quantity and quality of booze. "I... If you can get me cheaper stuff as well for their troops, I think that can be arranged.""
tobuck_start.3.a:0 ""Consider it done, my friend.""

tobuck_start.4.t:0 "Old Partner"
tobuck_start.4.d:0 "Ah, Vasile; simultaneously the most kind individual and the creature closest to tartarus that Pea Shooter had ever met. They were good friends, despite themselves; in fact it was likely their similar approach to things that made them so disinclined to dislike one another. He had come all the way from Prywhen to escape the civil war and make his way, which had led to the pair of them deciding quickly to collaborate once they had realised their capacity to further expand upon their ill-gotten gains.\n\nOf all the creatures in Tobuck, Vasile was closest to knowing the foreign minister's true intentions; but he remained unaware of his friend's careful game that was unfolding in the background.\n\n"Pea! How nice it is to see you again. Did you miss me?" The griffon offered with a haughty laugh as he sauntered into the office.\n\nThe earth pony allowed himself a similarly warm laugh and got up from his desk, trotting over to give the portly bird a pleasant hug. "The feeling is mutual, and though I must admit that I do miss your energetic entrances I firstly have a task for you."\n\n"Oh?" Vasile returned, feigning surprise before laughing again as they went to sit down. "Well I'm sure that I can do whatever it is you require. After all, I still owe you a favour or two."\n\nPea Shooter had long since forgotten where his favours with Vasile had originated, but he had always made sure to keep them in his back pocket until just the right moment. Now, as his plans were proceeding and with the looming deadline from Mekiouzza, it was time to cash them in.\n\n"I'm afraid I must ask you to work some of your magic regarding certain state documents," He answered earnestly, wanting to lie as little as possible to someone he considered a friend. "There are some rather significant numbers that need fudging, you understand?"\n\nThe griffon couldn't help but smile, eager to get his claws dirty. "Oh, is it my birthday? You shouldn't have!""
tobuck_start.4.a:0 ""I had a feeling you'd enjoy that!""

tobuck_start.5.t:0 "Hey, Take It Easy!"
tobuck_start.5.d:0 "Giggle sighed and took a swig out of his hip flask, standing calmly behind the front of the doors to the capitol building. The President knew that outside there would be reporters waiting to see what had been done about the Zarantian question, he knew that there would probably be some minor protests as well and he most certainly knew what his job was. It was time to command a presence in front of the public.\n\nAs soon as he had pushed open the doors, several ponies managed to squeeze past the national guard regiment that was holding the fort. "Hey, hey; what's all this about? I'm not going anywhere am I? Take it easy, all of you!"\n\nNeedless to say that almost immediately the reporters that had pushed through began asking him questions as Giggle Juice descended the capitol steps.\n\n"How are you handling Mekiouzza?"\n\n"Is the government working towards reconciliation with Zarantia?"\n\n"Is reintegration still on the table?"\n\nOnce he had descended the rest of the distance, the white-haired pony cleared his throat. "Well, before we go on I'd just like to thank you all for coming out to see me; it's very sweet of you. I'm going to stick around and answer some questions, which should put your many minds at ease. Yes of course we are cooperating with the tribes and yes we're doing our best to make sure rapprochement goes smoothly. Anything else?"\n\nAlmost immediately he was bombarded with a litany of new questions about the hows and the whys and the whos of it all. He could barely make out what anypony was saying beyond the very basic parts of sentences."
tobuck_start.5.a:0 "This was going to be a long afternoon."

tobuck_start.6.t:0 "A Fat Check"
tobuck_start.6.d:0 ""Gimmie More, I presume?" A delivery pegasus asked as they took a slow glide down onto the floor of the office with an immense package strapped to his back.\n\nThe unicorn in question, white-haired and clad in the most expensive suit a New Marelander could buy, looked up at her guest and smiled. "The very one. You must be the associate that our anonymous friend spoke of, correct?"\n\nHer guest nodded and took a seat at the executive's desk, smiling as the winged stallion sat. "I am indeed; they send their regards from overseas. We had heard that Her Majesty's colony was a fine place to do good business with good ponies."\n\nAt that both parties smiled and Gimmie gestured vaguely for her guest to hoof over his package. Silently, the pegasus acquiesced to this demand and put the box of brown paper on the table in order to present this pony with her bribe. After all, you couldn't simply launder money in this day and age; it was a delicate affair that took a lot of effort, and additional fees for individuals in the right places that were willing to help for a price.\n\nThe unicorn used her magic to pry apart the paper and inspect the money that had been stored inside. It was all here; not in bits of course, but certainly in a currency that she could turn into bits as she saw fit. Pea Shooter's associate - though his host knew not of his name - gave her a warm smile as she returned the money to what was now simply a paper bag rather than a package.\n\n"Everything is in order then. Our benefactor may transfer the money freely though my hooves and I will do my utmost to ensure that all possible complications are avoided." Gimmie answered, resting her hooves on the table.\n\nThe pegasus nodded, then stood up and turned about to leave. "A pleasure doing business with you madame.""
tobuck_start.6.a:0 "Everything was in order."

tobuck_start.7.t:0 "The Deserter"
tobuck_start.7.d:0 "Pea Shooter sat at his side desk in the presidential office, awaiting the arrival of his newest business partner. Relying on the warlords had always been a part of the plan, but as a result of recent events he had decided quickly that the prudent course of action would be to pick a favourite in order to sideline the others. Causing infighting in the 'military' was certainly dangerous, but it might save his flank in a pinch; especially if the other warlords became suspicious.\n\n"Well if it ain't my generous benefactor!" The familiar voice of Wallnut Drive chimed out as he entered the room, smile as wide as it could be.\n\nIn spite of his typical seriousness, even Pea wasn't immune to the thestral's charisma. "It's good to see you too, Wallnut." He returned with a slight chuckle, "Given your presence I am to assume that my proposal has piqued your interest enough to warrant further cooperation?"\n\nThe guest approached his desk and, instead of taking a seat in the normal fashion, he turned the chair around and sat resting his hooves on its back. Truly Wallnut was an odd individual, but no less interesting or personable for the many intricacies of his character.\n\n"Well I ain't one to pass up funds for my folks on the front. They deserve more than I can give 'em as it stands, so here I am for ya." He admitted happily, entirely unaware of the foreign minister's intentions.\n\n"I'm glad to hear that," Pea returned with an almost tragically genuine smile, "Do make sure you send your dutiful soldiers my regards alongside whatever you decide to buy with the money, won't you?"\n\nThe thestral grinned, "It'll be the first thing I do; an' give my love to Bags an' Al when you get the chance for me. I almost feel bad that they ain't gettin' a cut of this.""

Causing infighting in the 'military' was certainly dangerous, but it might save his flank in a pinch; especially if the other warlords became suspicious.\n\nIn her typically severe tone, Alesia Snezhnaya sauntered gracefully into the room with a slight smile on her face. "Good evening, minister Shooter. You're well, I hope?"\n\n"Well indeed, though in need of some minor assistance as I'm sure you have gathered by now. How is our talented Severyanian today?" He returned, perfectly pronouncing the name of her homeland as though it were his own.\n\nThe earth pony continued over to his desk and sat attentively, though with a surprisingly lax expression on her face. She had a lot of respect for the civil servant despite her general attitude towards republican governments; something that Pea Shooter was willing - though not happy - to take advantage of.\n\n "I must admit that I'm becoming rather concerned over the sparse number of letters from family that I have received thus far this year, but otherwise I am perfectly well. Having trouble with Wallnut and Baragzen, I gather?" She enquired, inquisitive as always but just unaware enough to be an entirely unwitting pawn.\n\nThe foreign minister chuckled and nodded, as if admitting a fault. "Yes, one could certainly say that. Truth be told, the offer to increase your funding is primarily to ensure that our two friends stay in line and you are by far the most reliable of my options in the military department."\n\nAlesia mulled over his words carefully, seemingly searching for an ulterior motive but finding none. "It would be my pleasure, minister Shooter.""

Causing infighting in the 'military' was certainly dangerous, but it might save his flank in a pinch; especially if the other warlords became suspicious.\n\nHaving pointedly swung open the door, Baragzen marched into the office with a regal expression of superiority plastered across his face. "Good afternoon, minister."\n\n"The same to you my friend. How are things?" the earth pony asked, gesturing to the seat in front of his desk with a hoof.\n\n"Oh, nothing to turn one's snout up at; nor anything to particularly entice. I must say that I was rather surprised by my selection, given that our relationship has been almost entirely professional; quite unlike your fondness for my colleagues." The zebra admitted, taking a seat at the desk and raising an eyebrow in curiosity.\n\nPea nodded and leaned into the desk with a severe expression, "And that is precisely why I offered you this alteration to our arrangement. To be frank, they may have more influence over state affairs than I at first realised and I require you to keep them in check as an external moderator. I cannot allow my personal affections to cloud my judgement on state affairs."\n\nThe foreign minister was, needless to say, lying through his teeth in saying as much; but he was intelligent enough to know that he could get away with it when it came to Baragzen. After all, how could he know that such a misjudgement was uncharacteristic?\n\n"That is a commendable course of action, minister Shooter. I can only accept the alteration of our arrangement and shall send you the finest bottle of champagne for your generosity." The zebra returned with a smug grin."

tobuck_start.10.t:0 "Border Report"
tobuck_start.10.d:0 "Some news has returned from the border today of a peculiar attack conducted by the warlords of Tobuck. It was peculiar more than anything else for the simple fact that it was so poorly planned that the legionnaires on the receiving end of the 'assault' have reported zero casualties save for a single thestral that injured themselves on barbed wire whilst scrambling to a trench.\n\nWhat's most strange about this is that no official statement has come out from either the mercenaries or Pea Shooter, which leads us to believe that this attack may have been deliberately disastrous. As to their intentions we unfortunately cannot guess, but at the very least it's not our place to complain about receiving several thousand test subjects and a few thousand more Labourers. If they wish to continue throwing lives away so freely - though it is unlikely - the administration will happily receive new volunteers."

tobuck_start.11.d:0 "To my sweetheart across the sea,\n\nI must first apologise for not writing sooner, but I have been incredibly busy trying to get things together out here in Zebrica. I mean not to make excuses, only to say sorry and explain my silence. I know you will understand that at the very least. The nation I have established myself in is a little city state called Tobuck on the innermost part of a bay and - before you fret - I have found myself safe and in good hooves with a number of friends already.\n\nOf particular interest to you would be my small, in contrast to what I hope to achieve here, but nevertheless substantial stock of money that I have accrued. Tobuck is neither a particularly rich or poor nation, but it can supply our family to a totally sufficient standard. I hope that, over the coming year or so, I can make you truly proud of my earnings.\n\nShould I return home before my intended date of departure, the money that I have made already could just about keep us sane in our retirement and pay for the foals' tuition. We could possibly splash out on one or two items, but as it stands we would likely need to continue working for several years after I return home. It is my intention - though not a practical certainty - to continue accumulating wealth at a steady pace; I want our family to live in comfort, not just security.\n\nIn closing, I hope that you can forgive me for my relative silence; it was not my intention to frighten you. I've just been working hard, for you and the foals. I know you'll understand, even if it takes you a little while for your heart to slow down. As a small favour, please make doubly sure that our little ones aren't staying up too late for me. I know they like to watch the stars at night sometimes, but a good night's sleep is sometimes more important than a day's work. I miss them both so, so much."

Unfortunately there is no telegram from Tobuck to Equestria just yet, but correspondence by letter shall suffice for now. Surprisingly, courier services from here around Her Majesty's princessdom are very efficient; but I vastly digress.\n\nThe reason for this correspondence is largely financial, as our accounts have begun to steadily fill with time and effort. If I were to return home now, we would never have to work a day in our lives again; though we might struggle a little if we planned to move somewhere nicer. I know that's something you'd like, particularly for our little ones, and I want it for them too. I can't stop now when their future could be so much brighter.\n\nWhilst I write, I realise that I have explained very little as of yet and so I'll paint a picture of my surroundings for you. Tobuck is a republic, small but stable and slowly growing; the view of the sea is something you would see on postcards back home. If I can I'll try to bring back some paintings for you all as presents, that and whatever trinkets I can spare the time to buy. To the north is an ancient kingdom of rivers and jungles whilst to our east is a collection of tribes and other zebras, making a life for themselves in the scorching desert. I suspect that they will attempt to take the city for themselves at some point in the future, but I assure you that I am not in any danger.\n\nWhen you serve a special weekend pudding next, can you make it just a little larger than normal for the little ones? I still miss them, and I miss you too. You won't have to wait too much longer, I promise."

Do not worry about me and my situation, I'll be fine as I always am. You know how these things tend to go.\n\nIn truth I have not been entirely honest with you, though from this letter forward you must swear to yourself never to reveal this correspondence to anypony. I am - hard as it may be to believe - the foreign minister of Tobuck. I run many state affairs from the most grand to the most minute, along with my many friends and political allies. I would name them, but I have not the time nor means to describe them all; I'm sure you know just how much my artistic talents leave to be desired.\n\nBut yes, it is true that I have spent much of my time here in Zebrica as a national figure; albeit one who is not entirely loved. All the same I promise to you that I have harmed no Tobuckian citizens in the making of our fortune, though I know you would never accuse me of such. Oh, and what a fortune it has become.\n\nIf you gazed upon the amount of money which I have accrued in my time here, you would scarcely believe your beautiful eyes. I can promise that - should I return now - we need do little more than look after Acacia and Poppy for the rest of our lives. We could pay for their tuition and more with what I have made for us, we could live comfortably for the rest of our lives and we could behave almost as we pleased.\n\nBut, I still have some time left before my term is up. You know that I wouldn't sleep if I had the chance to do my utmost for you and the foals. I love you all so much."

tobuck_start.14.d:0 "To my sweetheart across the sea,\n\nIf I may permit myself a little self-indulgence, I'm very proud of the reason for which I am writing this letter. Since the last time I put pen to paper, our newfound wealth has once again grown in proportion and my stint in Zebrica as a civil servant is nearing its end.\n\nWhen I return home, I would appreciate not being asked questions about my time in Tobuck; mostly because I now wish to avoid the world of politics altogether. I hope that, despite my short time there, they remember me fondly. Though - as I say - I wish to remember them very little if it can be done. I have spent so much time away from you, Mayflower. I have spent every waking moment of my time here wishing that I could be home with you and our little ones. I'll be home before you can think to complain of my absence again, I promise.\n\nWith the wealth I have accumulated here, we can live as veritable nobility upon my return. We shall have the nicest of homes, the best of clothes and food and the most secure spots in the most prestigious schools for Poppy and Acacia. You will never need to work another day in your life, even if the sun and moon stop lighting the world. \n\nIn this letter I swear to you, for my absence and for my mind in my work, I shall never need to make such an expedition as this again. I'm sorry for leaving you to mother our little ones alone and I may never get back the year with our little ones that I have lost, but I shall never lose another minute. I know you understand why I had to do this, for the family; but I still wish I had another choice.\n\nIn any case, I will soon write to you on the date of my return to Equestria. I'm anticipating it as much as you all are, and I'll bring the best presents I can find."

tobuck_start.15.t:0 "Departure"
tobuck_start.15.d:0 "Pea Shooter stood by a radio on the deck of the boat that he and Bean Counter had purchased many months ago, listening to the address that he had asked Menes to prepare. It was a quick affair, little more than an alert to let the Tobuckians know that the tribes would shortly swoop in and reintegrate the city. Of course, the foreign minister was not mentioned once in the proceedings; nor were his associates. He assumed that the place would be a little chaotic for a while, but that they'd get things sorted out all the same. Luckily it wasn't his problem anymore.\n\n"Heeey! How was the speech?" Bean's familiar voice chimed out over the largely quiet sea as he climbed the steps to the deck with a bottle of champagne.\n\nPea turned slowly about and switched off the radio, leaning on the railings. "Nothing special. With a little luck Menes will make sure everything goes smoothly, and if he doesn't then Mekiouzza certainly will."\n\nThe less severe of the two earth ponies laughed, setting down the bottle by the radio and pouring them both a drink. "No kidding. If you were still there by now I imagine she would subject you to more than just vague threats. I'm surprised that she even-"\n\nThe ex-civil servant winced as his pistol cracked the pristine calm of the evening air, looking away as the suddenly lifeless body of his old friend stood stock still for just a moment. The champagne bottle shattering on the deck followed by loud 'thunk' as Bean's corpse fell to the planks cemented the final conclusion of his plans. He just knew too much.\n\nMinutes passed as Pea attempted to rationalise his actions, knowing that he had chosen personal security over the life of a good friend. Tying weights to the hooves of the body and pushing what remained of that friend overboard certainly didn't help. He was finally free of that accursed republic, free to return home and to see his family, free from doubt and from the shackles of poverty.\n\nTossing the pistol into the sea, the remaining earth pony hoped that one day he could forgive himself. He hoped that the smiles on his family's faces could absolve his actions."
tobuck_start.15.a:0 "He hoped that it had been worth it."

tobuck_start.16.t:0 "Hasty Retreat"
tobuck_start.16.d:0 "The plan had certainly gone sideways.\n\nPea Shooter's true intentions had been discovered by the warlords, be it by accident or through some act of scrutiny on their part. Fortunately he had managed to escape with his life on a converted fishing trawler, but little else of his original grand strategy remained.\n\nThe stallion paced about on the deck of the boat, moving from port to starboard in his musings. If being thrown out of office before things had reached their conclusion wasn't bad enough, he hadn't even managed to secure the last vestiges of money that were supposed to be moved offshore in just a few days. But even then, that wasn't the most concerning of the many problems that faced him.\n\nBean Counter was most likely alive and that was a considerable problem. He knew even more of the operation than Vasile did and was originally going to come back to Equestria with Pea, but in the chaos of the administration's removal he had simply vanished. Originally their trip home was supposed to be an opportunity to rid himself of the one threat left to his operation and to his family's newfound wealth, but now his old friend was an unknown variable.\n\nAs the earth pony finally slowed to a stop, he leaned over the ship's bow railings and put a hoof to his hip. Feeling the gun that he had meant to use still strapped there, he wondered whether Bean would rat him out in the future. He wondered if there was anything he could do to be doubly sure that his family wouldn't be hurt. Pea even wondered if his friend would even want to throw him under the bus.\n\nThe only thing he knew for certain was that he was going to lose sleep over it.\n\nNow it was time for the warlords to take and shape Tobuck, whatever that might entail. Who knew what they would do with the place, now that their previous employer was gone."
tobuck_start.16.a:0 "They would certainly have a lot to deal with."

tobuck_start.17.t:0 "Home With Empty Hooves"
tobuck_start.17.d:0 "Tartarus, what was he supposed to say? He'd been away from home long enough for his foals to start forgetting his face and had almost nothing to show for it.\n\nPea Shooter was standing just outside of his family's home at near-midnight, carrying a suitcase with what few belongings he had. He wanted to knock on the door so badly that it hurt; but for the first time in a long time, he was scared. His wife and his foals were waiting for him to come home, they understood why he'd had to go away, but it didn't make the prospect of coming back with so little to give them any easier. The joy on their faces would be real, but so was the family's debt and the fact that they still couldn't afford to send Acacia and Poppy to school.\n\nThe dark-coated pony slumped to the steps outside of the apartment and sighed, the hoof he had shakily extended to the door handle now firmly on the floor. What would he say? What could he do except apologise and promise to try again? What was he doing here beyond coming home to tell his family that he'd botched everything and that he'd be away for another year, missing his foals grow up?\n\nHe buried his snout in his jacket for a while and simply sat, trying and mostly failing to process it all. He'd been a terrible businesspony and a worse father.\n\nJust as he was getting back up, the front door was slowly pushed open from the inside. "Sir I'm afraid th-" Mayflower Bed stopped short as he turned to face her, "P-Pea? Sweet Celestia I... Oh I've missed you so much!"\n\nHer tentative expression had quickly turned from shock into joy as she pulled her husband off of the steps and dragged him inside. She could barely contain herself, evaporating many of the concerns that he had in an instant.\n\n"May I... I'm sorry, I couldn't-""

tobuck_start.18.t:0 "A Soul Well Soothed"
tobuck_start.18.d:0 "It was the middle of the day and the sun was shining, but Pea Shooter was still a nervous wreck. Despite his time halfway across the world, he'd only amassed enough money to support their family at a very basic level. They could probably pay off their inherited debts, which he hoped would be just enough.\n\nSauntering through the village market on the way to the house, a few familiar faces recognised him and gave him a wave or asked him where he'd been. The answer was usually 'a business trip' or just even just 'family stuff' as he continued to trot, he was simply too focused on other things to properly respond.\n\nEventually he stopped and explained to the gradually growing group of old friends, "I'm very sorry folks, but I've got to get back and see Mayflower. She hasn't seen me for as long as you guys haven't."\n\nAt that the crowd went silent, gave him a few nods and words of affirmation and returned mostly to their stalls and houses. Pea had missed all this, what with everyone knowing who he was and appreciating him for being an actually decent pony.\n\nTo his surprise, his family was already waiting for him.\n\n"Dad! Daaaaaaaaaaaad!" Acacia called out, darting towards him.\n\nPoppy followed soon after and they barrelled into him, nearly winding the dark-coated pony in the process. "We missed you dad..."\n\n"I missed you too." He managed in response, doing his best to hug them both whilst smiling at Mayflower who was making her way over."

tobuck_start.19.t:0 "A Job Well Done"
tobuck_start.19.d:0 ""Y'know, I wanted to come back with more than this." Pea Shooter admitted quietly, having taken a swig of expensive whiskey.\n\nMayflower Bed turned to look at her husband, apparently unsurprised. "You thought you could bring back more, did you? After paying off the debt my father left us in and then paying for their tuition, you still wish you could go back and try again?"\n\nAs they sat beside one another on the sofa, they turned to watch their foals playing with the new toys that Pea had given them. They were happy and secure in their lives and future now, but their father still wished he could have given them more for being away for so long. He'd missed so much of their foalhood already, just to give them all a chance.\n\nHe sighed and cosied up against his wife's coat, frowning just a tad. "Maybe. I mean I'm happier, they're happier and - I hope - you're happier too; but I feel as though I could've done more in the time I spent away. I could've got them into a better school, we could have moved house. Maybe I could have earned enough so that we didn't have to work."\n\nShe nodded and wrapped a hoof around her husband's barrel, occasionally glancing at Acacia and Poppy to make sure they weren't doing anything overly silly. "You could have, but you're home now. And we are happier for what you did, whether you could have earned more money or not. Our little ones have a shot to get into the big leagues now and we can retire before most for your hard work. We're free to live our lives because of you."\n\nThey both sat silently for a while as Pea thought to himself, mulling over his own feelings. He really had done a lot - enough, perhaps - whether he had done the best he could have or otherwise."
tobuck_start.19.a:0 ""I love you May, you know that?""

tobuck_start.20.t:0 "Worries All gone"
tobuck_start.20.d:0 ""Did you really have to take us out here? This place costs more to eat at than I earn in a week!" Mayflower Bed complained, albeit more in jest than out of true dissatisfaction.\n\nPea Shooter turned to look at his wife with a warm smile, "I did, because I wanted to show you just how little you need to worry anymore. We can't go overboard, obviously; but we can go to fancy restaurants like this one from time to time, we can move to a nicer house and we can make do with what we have. You could leave your job tomorrow, if you like."\n\nShe chuckled, then shook her head. "If I left work I'd be bored out of my mind and you know it. Though... Maybe I could look for something that was more enjoyable, or fulfilling I should say."\n\nThe married couple gave each other a warm smile and Pea leaned over to give his partner a kiss on the cheek. The serenity of the moment was quickly broken however as their foals came running back from the buffet with all sorts of foods that they'd never tried before. Acacia almost dropped an entire plate of rare flowers and Poppy had already ruined her best dress with spaghetti sauce.\n\nSetting her plate down and suddenly realising her mistake, the foal gasped and looked at Mayflower like she'd just doomed them all. "I-I'm sorry mum, I didn't mean to get the dress dirty; it was an accident!"\n\nJust as the mare was sighing with the cost in mind, Pea put a hoof around her barrel and smiled. "It's okay sweetie, we can get you a new one now. Try not to ruin your clothes all the same, but it's not the end of the world; alright?""

tobuck_start.21.t:0 "Money Is No Object"
tobuck_start.21.d:0 "It was a little odd that they were alone on this trip given that the manor house here was somewhat of a local attraction for its history, but Pea had most likely just filled up the other slots on the tour by paying for them. It was also rather strange that it seemed to be a butler taking them around and showing them all the rooms that were usually disallowed from public viewing, but then money was a route to a great many privileges.\n\n"...and this, as you might guess, is one of the foal bedrooms. As you can see it's pleasantly rustic, but nevertheless has the capacity for the installation of many modern amenities..."\n\nAs the stallion extrapolated further, Mayflower then turned to her husband to speak in a whisper. "Is it just me, or is he speaking as though we're meaning to buy the place? Or as if we already own it, even? I wouldn't complain but... it's a bit odd for a tour, right?"\n\n"I suppose it is a little strange, for a tour at least." Pea returned with a grin.\n\nAt that moment, his wife stopped in her tracks with wide eyes and everypony turned to look at her. "Nooooo... No no no no no no, you didn't; did you?"\n\n"Is something the matter, ma'am? Are renovations not to your taste?" The butler asked, looking between the couple with a knowing smile of his own.\n\nAcacia and Poppy stared blankly at Pea, then at Mayflower; then back to Pea again. What was going on? Had something terrible happened, or was something great happening? Grown-up ponies were hard to read sometimes.\n\n"If what you think I did was buy this manor without the need of a mortgage or loan of any sort, then yes; that's exactly what I did. And before you two ask, yes that means you can jump on the beds. The mattresses need testing anyway." He answered, letting out a little chuckle and affectionately nudging Acacia over to her new four-poster bed.\n\nThe butler couldn't resist a chuckle of his own as he watched the little ones look at each other and run to the beds, having been clued in for the duration of the tour thus far. Mayflower meanwhile approached her husband with a look that was almost indecipherable, before leaning in close and planting a deep kiss on his lips."

Thanks to a miscommunication between national guard regiments, a skirmish began between them and a warlord unit that rapidly evolved into all-out city warfare between not only the republican forces, but also those of the disparate warlord bands who all sought to gain from the apparent power vacuum.\n\nDespite small amounts of assistance from the public, the national guard quickly crumbled without the direction from any figures of authority. Their lacklustre regiments were quickly routed and forced from the city, then disarmed and disbanded with volunteers largely allowed to return home; if of course they were willing to walk back into the city. Most wanted to wait until things cooled down before returning home.\n\nNeedless to say that once the republicans were out of the way, the warlords fought on in order to take what was rightfully theirs.

Once the national guard had achieved a small string of victories, they managed to push the bands out of the capital in one fell swoop.\n\nUnfortunately, the safety of the nation is not yet guaranteed. The remnants of the warlord armies remain relatively potent, if not capable of taking the capital alone after the intense brawl.

His efforts today had mostly been regarding payments and equipment transfers for the national guard, which was a laborious task and one that he was happy to have finished.\n\nAs he drummed his claws upon his desk and took a long drag from his cigar, a rather curious thought dawned upon him. All of a sudden, he was awfully influential in the running of the country; what with most important documentation going through him in some capacity. Of course he was presently loyal to the President and particularly to his foreign minister as any sane creature would be for Pea Shooter's hard work, but that wasn't to say that he didn't have ambitions.\n\nJust as a rather self-indulgent grin grew upon his beak, the door to his office slowly opened to reveal his secretary carrying another stack of papers. "Sorry to dump all of this on you Vasile, but I'm afraid Pea has just sent another batch of papers our way; minting paperwork mostly."\n\n"Ah, so we're doing the banks too now are we?" The griffon asked with a laugh as he set down the pile of sheets on his desk.\n\nWith a sigh and a stretch, the pony returned with a little chuckle of his own. "It certainly seems that way. I sure hope they know what they're doing, giving us all of this responsibility to work with. We can handle it, but I have a nagging feeling in the back of my mind that we shouldn't really be doing some of this stuff. Seems like too much power in one place, you know?"\n\n"I quite agree. When I next get the chance I'll have to speak to Pea about all of this, it's beginning to get concerning."

He's a little green, but he's got the spirit and the brains. I check."\n\nHe nodded a little and observed the pair in their head-to-head battle, most of the pot having come from the as–of-yet silent unicorn's pockets. He simply sat, completely straight faced and nodded slowly.\n\n"I raise, if only to remind the both of you that Baragzen actually understands the worth of his troops and pays us like it.

Once satisfied by our trip through their stocks of firearms, they revealed that they wished to sell them to us for a very reasonable price.\n\nNeedless to say that it is of little consequence if we choose to support Tobuck in their endeavours or not, but perhaps a little care should be taken with these shady characters.

Speeches were made, citizens were allowed to stay or to leave as they saw fit; but no fighting was to occur. The best laid plans of the desert rats had gone off without a hitch, leaving whoever was left to pick up the pieces.\n\nBut - as the Republic of Tobuck was left to the annals of history - the Aguellid and her people had righted a great wrong in the history of their nation.

The state can't afford to lose this revenue stream just yet and we need more time before we can move away from selling our stores just yet."\n\n"Consider it done, minister." He said simply, jotting down a few last notes. "Is everything alright? You look... stressed. That's rather unusual for you, if I may say so sir." The stallion noted, just as he was going to leave the office.\n\nPea gave him a halfhearted smile before standing up and stretching. "I appreciate your concern, but I'm doing just fine. I'm simply concerned over the welfare of the nation, as any good civil servant would be in my position. Go on now, the faster you can get the warehouse manager in here the quicker we can sort this mess out."\n\nHis facade of total calm had slipped a little, but his secretary thankfully thought little of it. Once the door had closed behind him, the foreign affairs minister quickly opened up a number of drawers in his desk and hauled out an incredible quantity of paper. No more guns didn't mean the end of the operation, but it did mean he was going to have to work harder to make his money."

tobuck_start.34.d:0 "Much to the display of the average city resident and the now disbanded national guard regiments, the fighting in the capital had continued long into the night. The warlords had struggled to gain the upper hoof over one another and it was taking a toll on Tobuck's infrastructure as much as their popular perception.\n\nAll the same, the fighting would soon come to an end. The citizens of the now dying republic had suffered enough and were growing restless. One warlord would push out the others, lest they be disarmed by the remnants of the dissatisfied public in their destruction of the city.\n\nPerhaps the others would come crawling back at a later date, but for now..."

tobuck_start.35.d:0 "Pea Shooter stood by a radio on the deck of the boat that he and Bean Counter had purchased many months ago, listening to the address that he had asked Menes to prepare. It was a quick affair, little more than an alert to let the Tobuckians know that the tribes were already inside the city and that the desert queen was taking over. Of course, the foreign minister was not mentioned once in the proceedings; nor were his associates. He assumed that the place would be a little chaotic for a while, but that they'd get things sorted out all the same. Luckily it wasn't his problem anymore.\n\n"Heeey! How was the speech?" Bean's familiar voice chimed out over the largely quiet sea as he climbed the steps to the deck with a bottle of champagne.\n\nPea turned slowly about and switched off the radio, leaning on the railings. "Nothing special. I'm a little disappointed that we couldn't move the last of the money before the end of the year, but at least it's over now."\n\nThe less severe of the two earth ponies laughed, setting down the bottle by the radio and pouring them both a drink. "At least Mekiouzza doesn't have your head on a stick, right? If you were still there by now I imagine she would subject you to more than just vague threats. I'm surprised that she even-"\n\nThe ex-civil servant winced as his pistol cracked the pristine calm of the evening air, looking away as the suddenly lifeless body of his old friend stood stock still for just a moment. The champagne bottle shattering on the deck followed by loud 'thunk' as Bean's corpse fell to the planks cemented the final conclusion of his plans. He just knew too much.\n\nMinutes passed as Pea attempted to rationalise his actions, knowing that he had chosen personal security over the life of a good friend. Tying weights to the hooves of the body and pushing what remained of that friend overboard certainly didn't help. He was finally free of that accursed republic, free to return home and to see his family, free from doubt and from the shackles of poverty.\n\nTossing the pistol into the sea, the remaining earth pony hoped that one day he could forgive himself. He hoped that the smiles on his family's faces could absolve his actions."

### Vasile events

tobuck_vasile.1.t:0 "Extra, Extra!"
tobuck_vasile.1.d:0 ""Reeeead all about it! We've got the latest here folks! Pea Shooter, a name barely known, responsible for everything! Come get your newspapers here!" A street seller chimed out, having already emptied her stocks once that day.\n\nMany ponies were understandably appalled by what they were reading. As if the republic in concept wasn't bad enough in its own right, now they were discovering that the whole thing had been a sham from start to finish anyway! At least nobody was surprised by the president being easily manipulated, given that he was almost always tipsy if not utterly smashed; but the fact that such was expected was abhorrent in its own right. What in tartarus was the republic doing if it wasn't ruling for the good of the people?\n\nOutside of a café, two old friends were catching up and sharing the news. They were both disgusted, though not entirely taken aback by happenings.\n\nA brown-coated mare grunted, having sipped at tea that was too hot. "Well, I for one will now say 'I told you so'. Giggle was an imbecile, there's no way he could have been running this place; although admittedly I didn't think that his help would have been so... well criminal, I suppose."\n\nThe stallion sitting opposite flexed his wings and nodded slowly, letting out a sigh of disappointment. "Yup, you got me. Something tells me you're not satisfied by being right though, for once."\n\n"Touché." She quickly added with a grin.\n\n"What strikes me as strange is that despite clearly having the reigns on basically everything, the republic hasn't collapsed. That griffon has just strolled in and sorted things you, you know? I don't think institutions can get rid of a corruption problem like that so easily." The pegasus returned with a grimmace.\n\nHis friend raised an eyebrow, apparently surprised by what he considered to be an obvious observation. "Huh. I hadn't thought about that...""
tobuck_vasile.1.a:0 ""...at least we know for sure that Pea was a menace, right?""

tobuck_vasile.2.t:0 "Final Musings"
tobuck_vasile.2.d:0 "Writing speeches was always a pain in the plumage. Not because he couldn't do it of course, Vasile was vaguely aware of his skill in the field of oration and writing, but because he liked it when he could just say what was on his mind. It was a hassle to making things presentable and consumable for the average creature, but it was technically his job. After all, he was now the President of a small but potentially prosperous republic.\n\nJust at that moment, his driver gave a little wave. "Sir, we're almost there."\n\n"Mmm. Thank you; stick around for my departure as well, if you wouldn't mind." The griffon returned with a personable smile.\n\nSeeing the mare nod back to him in the rear-view mirror, Vasile returned to his musings. There were two primary options that he was considering: running a republic that stayed mostly true to its founding values, or strengthening his own position for business purposes.\n\nThe former was a venture primarily for the sake of vanity on his part, becoming a president adored by the citizenry in spite of the many dealings he would have going on in the background. It would require cooperation with the Harmonic Front and Rose Rain, a ratification of the National Congress and generally would entail keeping up appearances and doing an honest job of things. He could still skim off of the top of course, but it was not a venture entirely based on profit over principle.\n\nThat was for the latter of his potential choices. He could cement his position in the republic and put his mind to making the most money he possibly could, removing whatever was left of the founding principles of republic and doing things his way. Admittedly, this did sound rather enjoyable; but it would be a thankless and likely ruthless occupation.\n\nAs the car turned onto the main road, Vasile spotted a considerable crowd that was composed mainly of furious and hopeful creatures. He'd have to make his choice now and pen it in for the ending words of his rousing speech."
tobuck_vasile.2.a:0 "The republic will heed the masses!"

### Legimate Republic events

tobuck_vasile.3.t:0 "Day's Honest Work"
tobuck_vasile.3.d:0 "Halfpenny Huff grunted, sighed and began work on the next drape she was supposed to be putting together for the wardens. Technically speaking personal requests weren't a part of the job description, if prison labour could be considered a job, but helping the staff out with little things like this was pretty good for getting the odd favour in.\n\n"Looking good there, Three-Seventy-Two. Add in some of that red lining there and I'll get you some cigarettes for your trouble, huh? I can see your probation getting closer from here!" One of the guard stallions gave out, giving an unnervingly happy salute to one of his friends on the gantry above.\n\nThe mare scoffed, but did as requested in using the red thread. "Careful there mate, sounds like you're gonna need a trip to the hospital before I will with all the packets you're going through."\n\n"Hah! Tell that to the people we've got bringing in your food!" He retorted with a haughty laugh, commenting mostly on the meals more than anything else.\n\nAt that the prisoner allowed herself a little chuckle, knowing very well that the slop they were given to eat was about as cheap as money could buy. Actually it probably was slowly killing most of the inmates here, either that or the work was; she was lucky to have a job sewing at a relatively clean workspace instead of scouring the mines with some of the other equines.\n\n"Actually, instead of cigs, could you get some more rolls of thread? Colours 'an all. Think of it as an investment, since they want to run this place like some misbegotten factory." She offered after a moment of thought.\n\nA couple of the other ponies working around her turned to look at their stationed guard, almost amazed by the prisoner's brazen push for a little more freedom.\n\n"Huh," the stallion gave out, unsure of how to respond for just a moment. "Y'know, that ain't such a bad idea. What the President wants, the President gets right? I'm picking the thread colours though, that's my condition."\n\nHalfpenny grinned, now curious as to how far they could push this."
tobuck_vasile.3.a:0 "'Work' certainly kept them busy."

tobuck_vasile.4.t:0 "Rule Of Law"
tobuck_vasile.4.d:0 ""Mares and Gentlecolts of the jury I'm afraid the evidence truly does speak for itself. We have several files pertaining to the embezzlement of government funds and the undermining presidential authority."\n\nTough Bark barely even recalled anything besides those words. She knew that all the evidence was forged, but there was nothing she could do to prove that it was either created via malpractice or falsely attributed to her if the documentation even had a scrap of reality within it. Truth be told, she did know of some creatures that had been doing less-than-savoury things and most of them could be connected back to Vasile; which was precisely why she had been targeted.\n\nShe had probably been one of the only truly innocent ponies left there, all things considered; but that wasn't a surprise. Some civil servants that she knew rather well were themselves supposedly penned for trials just like the one she had endured.\n\nSitting across from her, another prisoner being transported out of the capital made a smile. "So what are you bein' carted off for, huh? You done seem like much the criminal type to me, or maybe yer jus' more than you look.\n\nGlancing up at the immense size of the zebra sitting in front of her, Tough almost choked on her own tongue. "Embezzling, tax fraud, rigging the elections and so on."\n\n"Sounds just like a regular politician to me." He offered with a little laugh. "Eh, sorry. S'ya life's work isn't it? A promising career, I bet?"\n\nAt that, Tough Bark simply nodded. Everything wiped away in one rigged up trial, made to make her look like a fool and an idiot for something that she didn't even do. Now she was going to have to spend the next decade or two trying to get out."
tobuck_vasile.4.a:0 "Vasile was judge, jury and executioner."

tobuck_vasile.5.t:0 "The Old Ways"
tobuck_vasile.5.d:0 "Isgaden was having the time of his life.\n\nTobuck's mere existence had long been an insult to his family and to his personal dimense in the local area which was typically harassed by local businessponies that wanted to purchase the land for themselves. Their efforts to lower the land value had worked, but his will to stay put had gone absolutely nowhere; and now, thanks to Vasile's new policies of protecting old Zarantian heritage lands, his defensiveness was vindicated.\n\nNot only had aggressive business practices been rightly punished by the government, but he'd been granted the privileges to basically whatever he wanted on his own land. He didn't even have to pay his own workers anymore since they were tied to the land, which was certainly appreciated. It wasn't his intention for the workers - contractually tied to the land - to become his property in parcel with the land, but such had fallen right into his hooves.\n\nJust as Isgaden let out another sigh of satisfaction, his brother Ghumer sauntered out onto the patio. "Don't suppose you've been working on the tax papers have you? You're going to want to get those done sooner rather than later.\n\n"I suppose it's the least we could do for Vasile? Look at what he's given us, that's worth paying a little in for." The zebra answered with a scoff.\n\nHis brother looked at him as though he'd seen a spirit, emphatically putting a hoof to his chest. "You? Willing to pay taxes? Now I've seen everything.\n\nThey both laughed, sat, relaxed in the sun and watched over the lush green fields that they had coveted so; It almost made not being part of Zarantia worth it. Or at least, made it economically enticing."
tobuck_vasile.5.a:0 "It's not so bad, being a Tobuckian."

tobuck_vasile.6.t:0 "Miharzehir Referendum"
tobuck_vasile.6.d:0 "When [TBK.GetNameDefCap] proposed that we hold a referendum in the occupied state of Miharzehir, the administration was already suspicious. They might have been able to win such a democratic poll legitimately, but if there's one thing that anybody can say about Vasile it's that he never plays fair and recent events have proven just that.\n\nTo the surprise of absolutely nobody, the referendum was an utter farce. [TBK.GetNameDef] did almost nothing to hide their blatant rigging of the event. Vasile and his government are of course adamant that this supposed 'will of the people' should be followed to a tee, but we are left with a choice. Warzena can either simply let this old, mostly useless and underpopulated territory go, or we can repudiate their clearly ridiculous vote and declare war. Of course, Hippogriffia would not help us in such an aggressive conflict that does not interest them; but the republic should be easy to crush if we so choose.\n\nWhat course shall we take?"
tobuck_vasile.6.a:0 "Miharzehir is worthless, we might as well accept the result."
tobuck_vasile.6.b:0 "This is simply unnacceptable!"

tobuck_vasile.7.t:0 "Warzena Folds"
tobuck_vasile.7.d:0 ""...and, as the results show, we have received an overwhelming majority in Miharzehir for our republic to remain united and free from the shackles of ancient tyranny! The people of Tobuck have spoken and the democratic process has shown its worth and - together - we shall march forward into modernity, prosperity and freedom for all!"\n\nThe President was almost taken aback by the incredible applause that followed as he finished his address to the public. Perhaps it was the knowledge that the referendum they had arranged was more than just a little rigged, or maybe it was that he hadn't been expecting such genuine support from citizens that entirely distrusted their government only a short while prior. He had to suppose that sticking it to those outsiders was just a really good way to reaffirm trust; after all, it had worked with Chiropterra as well.\n\nThe old bird waved his claws, meaning to quieten his supports for just a moment. "I would also like to briefly extend a word of thanks to you, those of you who have turned up today and those of you who are listening in from afar. I may have put my talons in the doorway at first, but it is the average citizen of Tobuck that makes our republic truly great. It is your confidence and support that keeps this place running. All my successes are thanks to you and what we have achieved together is truly a demonstration of your collective will!"\n\nHe threw his claws up in the air and received another round of applause that was just as loud as the last, though - it seemed - a little more earnest this time. Was he really becoming attached to this little rump state in a desert backwater, or was that just his ego talking? Or, perhaps, was it a bit of both?"
tobuck_vasile.7.a:0 "Long live the republic! Hail to the President!"

tobuck_vasile.8.t:0 "Vasile Offers A Claw"
tobuck_vasile.8.d:0 "Despite our past hostilities, [TBK.GetNameDef] has extended an olive branch to our administration in an uncharacteristically polite fashion.\n\nThe deal is rather simple. We put aside our differences and, as Vasile has said in his speeches, 'team up' against potential outsider threats. Needless to say that this arrangement is very beneficial for them, perhaps even one-sided, but it's also very beneficial for us. After all, with the Tobuckian economy behind us we could become a formidable force.\n\nThere are some however who detest the idea, not least because of the awful reputation that both Vasile and his republic have. He is - in essence - a dictionar and the republic is little more than his fiefdom; which makes his indirect ownership of the land even more unbearable. But, for his many failings, there is a reason that the old bird is considered to be such a savvy dealbroker.\n\nDeclining this deal would be a poor choice from a practical point of view, but should we really be taking an offer from a criminal that has managed to become the president of an already illegitimate state?"
tobuck_vasile.8.a:0 "Though we may despise their illegitimate state, cooperation is logical."
tobuck_vasile.8.b:0 "Begone, foul vipers! You will never be welcome here!"

tobuck_vasile.9.t:0 "They Sign The Deal"
tobuck_vasile.9.d:0 "And so the deed was done. Years of hostility and conflict had been abandoned for a promise of peace and protection which - despite his international reputation - Vasile intended to keep.\n\nThe signing of the documents by the President of Tobuck and the envoys was inevitably turned into quite a spectacle with interviewers and reporters coming and going. Needless to say that the citizens of all both nations are glad to hear of peace, even if it means cooperating with a griffon quite as corrupt as Vasile. Though, if his personability during the proceedings was anything to go by, perhaps he does indeed have some integrity; deep down."
tobuck_vasile.9.a:0 "Peace in our time."

tobuck_vasile.10.t:0 "They Rejects Us!"
tobuck_vasile.10.d:0 "How could they possibly have declined the proposal? Sure it was maybe a little one-sided but it wasn't as though their administration didn't benefit from the agreement as well!\n\n"Those imbeciles, they've doomed us! Left us at the mercy of any major state that seeks to gain from our weakness alone!" He clamoured, utterly terrifying his secretary who had never seen him quite this distressed before.\n\nVasile was not typically an angry griffon, but for once there was more at stake than simple capital. His people and his pride were now at risk because the bumbling buffoons across the border couldn't see past their own uppity snouts!\n\nWhat he really needed now was something to calm the nerves, that and a moment to collect his thoughts for his cowering secretary. "Ugh... I do apologise for my outburst; it seems I am more passionate about the wellbeing of our republic than even I realised. Fetch me my most expensive box of cigars."\n\n"B-but, sir... Those cost more than I make in a month!" The frightened stallion stammered out."
tobuck_vasile.10.a:0 ""Good. The price will take my mind off of those morons.""

tobuck_vasile.11.t:0 "Just Who Was Pea Shooter?"
tobuck_vasile.11.d:0 "What a day it had been.\n\nSeventeen convictions and another batch of potential criminals to potentially throw the book at tomorrow as well. A couple had gone free, more for lack of condemning evidence than anything else, but Quick Slam wasn't exactly known for his lenience in the court of law.\n\nThe final case of today was the biggest one, but it was also one in which his ruling would matter the least. After all, it wasn't as though they could just waltz into [EQS.GetNameDef] and take somepony away to another continent; not without breaking a slew of laws at least. The verdict would be guilty of course, that was without question given the proven evidence and a litany of potential additional crimes that remained untouchable, but he could hardly see anything come of it.\n\nHaving given them an admittedly brief amount of time to consider, the judge turned to the jury. "Will the jury foreperson please stand? Has the jury reached a unanimous verdict?"\n\nA young zebra stood with a concerned expression. "We have, your honour. However, given the nature of this trial and the current whereabouts of the defendant that prevent their punishment; the jury has unanimously decided on an additional course of action for the courts beyond the announcement of a verdict."\n\nQuick's ear twitched, knowing both where this was going and how dangerous it could be for Vasile. He was ruling here at the President's request and allowing for such a request was dangerous, but equally denying due process could cause an uproar.\n\nThe unicorn tentatively nodded, shuffling his hooves together. "Present your verdict and subsequently your proposal to the court."\n\n"We, the jury, decide unanimously that Pea Shooter is guilty of the crimes he has committed. Furthermore, we propose an official diplomatic demand be sent to [EQS.GetNameDef] so that he may be transferred and tried here." The zebra dutifully explained.\n\nIn that moment - knowing that he had to acquiesce for his career - Quick Slam knew that Vasile would kill him. "The proposal is accepted and the jury is thanked and excused. Court is adjourned.""
tobuck_vasile.11.a:0 "The applause made the sinking feeling more bearable."

tobuck_vasile.12.t:0 "A Formal Request From Tobuck"
tobuck_vasile.12.d:0 "[EQS.GetLeader] was utterly bewildered, which was not something that occurred often. But then neither was receiving an official diplomatic demand for one of your citizens to be carted off to some backwater republic in Zebrica.\n\nHaving attempted to inspect Pea Shooter's criminal record and finding that the earth pony in question simply didn't have one, it seemed the decision was rather obvious. It was, frankly, impossible for anypony - let alone one without a criminal history - to commit crimes of the scale described in just a year. Whoever this 'President Vasile' fellow was, they clearly had made a mistake somewhere along the line.\n\nAt the request of [EQS.GetLeader], Pea Shooter had taken the long journey from his home to the capital to discuss the note. He had indeed been in [TBK.GetNameDef] for some time, making his way as a merchant for the benefit of his family, but understandably insisted that he hadn't the slightest idea of the crimes that the notice spoke of. After an entirely cordial afternoon of further pleasantries he insisted that he return home to look after his family and foals, one of which he was supposed to be planning a seventh birthday party for.\n\nHaving sent the clearly innocent pony home with a present of his own as an apology for wasting his time, [EQS.GetLeader] carefully constructed a letter to send in return. Vasile's ludicrous request would be denied and no further communications would be made on the matter of Pea Shooter's obviously falsified crimes."
tobuck_vasile.12.a:0 "What a peculiar request."

tobuck_vasile.13.t:0 "Plans For Warzena"
tobuck_vasile.13.d:0 "Decisions, decisions. Most creatures would have considered the choice between declaring war or aligning economic interests to be an easy one, but Vasile was not most creatures. He had to decide on Warzena's future in relation to Tobuck and he was going to make the right call.\n\nThere was a lot to gain from kickstarting a war economy, or refreshing whatever they had established in the struggle against Chiropterra. Needless to say that Vasile was interested in whatever money he could earn for both himself and the state, as well as continuing the growth of a new Tobuckian nationalism that was beginning to form. After all, there was nothing better for the popularity of a president and the regime that they headed than winning a war.\n\nOn the other claw, an economic union with Warzena would provide the most lasting benefits for the state and its people. The army too, whilst reasonably sized, was not in a particularly strong position and the odds of victory were not entirely in favour of the republic. War would be a significantly worse bet to lose than the proposal of an agreement that Tobuck was flourishing without. Economic cooperation was typically safe and always profitable.\n\nThe old bird kicked up his talons and lit a cigar, relaxing as he mulled over his options. Both were viable for the republic, but neither was objectively better than the other. After all, ponies and zebras would die in the event of a war; but economic unions did nothing for the national identity of a people.\n\nLuckily, all dilemmas are eventually solved."

tobuck_vasile.14.d:0 "Just this morning Vasile cel Tradat approached our administration with a rather curious proposal for a creature of his disposition. Despite himself, he asks us for an alliance both militarily and economically; something that has come as somewhat of a surprise.\n\nNeedless to say that an alliance would be immensely beneficial for our people, especially regarding our economic interests and the promise of mutual defence. [TBK.GetNameDef] would be an invaluable asset, despite its less-than-savoury administration and it would thus be somewhat foolish to deny them outright.\n\nHowever, it is also true that Vasile's regime is almost entirely artificial; a state marred by considerable state corruption and profit motives at various levels. Many have expressed concerns that such practices would slowly seep into our own lands, either incidentally or deliberately on the part of their government.\n\nAs an additional consideration, the offer was phrased in a way that made refusing sound particularly dangerous. It would be difficult to call the griffon's admittedly well written overture a demand for cooperation, but denying the offer may very well entail war with [TBK.GetNameDef].\n\nHow should the state respond to such a notice?"
tobuck_vasile.14.a:0 "We shall, tentatively, accept."

Needless to say, Vasile has made an address to the nation in an effort to make the transition to full cooperation with our neighbours a little easier. Whatever the public may think of this friendship, the average creature is overjoyed at the security that the alliance will provide.\n\nUpon returning to the capitol building, Vasile additionally decided that he would host a small dinner party for the administration which is understood to have been a pleasant affair. With any luck, he'll be hosting another with [WAR.GetLeader] some time soon."

His previous choice, despite his careful deliberations, had not come to fruition in quite the way he had anticipated; in fact it had now presented Vasile with another question that needed answering.\n\nHow would he respond to [WAR.GetNameDef]?\n\nOf course he had successfully avoided saying explicitly that they would declare war if they declined the cooperation proposal, but the President of the republic had certainly implied that he would. After all, threats masked by pleasantries were typically more than enough to get along with most folks; unfortunately, he had clearly underestimated either the potential for idiocy and bravery on the part of [WAR.GetLeader].\n\nIt was certainly possible to launch a successful invasion, but victory wasn't guaranteed. In turn, he would have gained nothing from this whole debacle if they didn't do something with this opportunity. It was certainly a conundrum, one that he needed to answer quickly in order to save face before the public."

Knowing that he and his people have little to offer us militarily, this curiously charismatic griffon has instead proposed continued diplomatic overtures for international cooperation and a non-aggression pact to ever-so-slightly sweeten the deal.\n\n[TBK.GetNameDef] is a relatively developed state that offers little in terms of strategic value and as such this deal is rather enticing, not least for their enshrined free trade laws. It is safe to say that the national economy could benefit greatly from trade routes and good relations.\n\nThere is, unfortunately, somewhat of a moral caveat in simply agreeing to this arrangement.\n\nThe primary building blocks of Vasile's republic are populism, almost tyrannical presidential power and a gradually rising nationalism. It is, essentially, a dictatorship. It should also be noted that the bird himself has a history of less-than-savoury dealings and, though associating with him is of little consequence to [CTH.GetNameDef], the administration would essentially be supporting his regime by formally agreeing not to topple it.\n\nThe state is subsequently left with three choices: Accept the full deal, maintain cordial relations only or reject the terms outright."

tobuck_vasile.21.d:0 "It seemed there was always another question to answer. Most creatures would have considered the choice between declaring war or aligning economic interests to be an easy one, but Vasile was not most creatures. He had to decide on Zarantia's future in relation to Tobuck and he was going to make the right call.\n\nThere was a lot to gain from kickstarting a war economy, or refreshing whatever they had established in the struggle against Chiropterra. Needless to say that Vasile was interested in enriching the state and himself where he could, as well as substantiating the growth of a new Tobuckian nationalism that was still emerging. After all, there was nothing better for the stability of any government and its leaders than winning an obviously justified war.\n\nOn the other claw, economic cooperation with Zarantia would provide the best long-term growth for the national industries and subsequently the people. The army too, whilst fairly large, was not overwhelmingly stronger than that which the tribes fielded and the likelihood of victory was not particularly high. War would be a significantly worse gamble to lose than the proposal of an agreement that Tobuck was flourishing without. Economic cooperation was usually safe and certainly profitable.\n\nThe old bird kicked up his talons and uncorked a bottle of whiskey, relaxing as he mulled over his options. Both were viable for the republic, but neither was objectively better than the other. After all, ponies and zebras would die in the event of a war; but economic unions did nothing for the national identity of a people.\n\nLuckily, all questions are eventually answered."

Despite himself, he asks us for an alliance both militarily and economically; something that has come as somewhat of a surprise.\n\nNeedless to say that an alliance would be immensely beneficial for our people, especially regarding our economic interests and the promise of mutual defence. [TBK.GetNameDef] would be an invaluable asset, despite its less-than-savoury administration and it would thus be somewhat foolish to deny them outright.\n\nHowever, it is also true that Vasile's regime is almost entirely artificial; a state marred by considerable state corruption and profit motives at various levels. Many have expressed concerns that such practices would slowly seep into our own lands, either incidentally or deliberately on the part of their government.\n\nAs an additional consideration, the offer was phrased in a way that made refusing sound particularly dangerous. It would be difficult to call the griffon's admittedly well written overture a demand for cooperation, but denying the offer may very well entail war with [TBK.GetNameDef].\n\nHow should the state respond to such a notice?"

Needless to say, Vasile has made an address to the nation in an effort to make the transition to full cooperation with our neighbours a little easier. Whatever the public may think of this friendship, the average creature is overjoyed at the security that the alliance will provide.\n\nUpon returning to the capitol building, Vasile additionally decided that he would host a small dinner party for the administration which is understood to have been a pleasant affair.

After all, threats masked by pleasantries were typically more than enough to get along with most folks; unfortunately, he had clearly underestimated either the potential for idiocy and bravery on the part of [ZAR.GetLeader].\n\nIt was certainly possible to launch a successful invasion, but victory wasn't guaranteed.

For all the successes and great steps taken towards a brighter future, there was still a chance that the President could have it all swept away from him.\n\nVasile sighed and sat up in his deck chair, pushing his hat back up from its prior tilted position. What was it that 'proper' republics always did when it was time to select a new leader, whatever their title might have been? It took him an embarrassingly long time to recall the term 'election' from memory, but then he had been having a nap.\n\nWith a grunt and a claw to his beak, the President decided then that it was high time for him to hold one of these 'elections' in order to cement his power. Of course the Harmonic Front would most likely run in whatever sectors they could spare the candidates for, but they were hardly a threat to his influence. If he held a legitimate election now - or at least, an election that wasn't blatantly rigged - he could have himself reelected and use that popular mandate to further centralise power around himself with the republic.\n\nThe old bird couldn't help but allow a smile to creep onto his beak. Sure it wasn't the most devious of plans, there were many ways to receive such a popular mandate for such a power grab, but it was all the better for its simplicity.\n\nNow rather pleased with himself, Vasile stood up with a mission to accomplish. First and foremost, he needed to call his butler and make some arrangements.\n\n"Ihsen, my good stallion! I have need of your skills!" The griffon called out as he sauntered back into his house proper.\n\nIn a flash, a well dressed earth pony was by his side with a warm smile. "Sir, what would you have me do? You appear to be in very high spirits."\n\nThe President chuckled and nodded, "Observant as ever, Ihsen. I must ask that we arrange one of the living rooms for a grand TCP meeting to prepare for an upcoming election campaign; some light refreshments, snacks and oh... say, at least forty seats."\n\n"Right you are, sir; the arrangements will be made."

A griffon who had made a new home for himself, created a nation state with his bare claws and guaranteed stability and prosperity for all citizens of the republic.\n\nThe old bird smirked as he considered how self indulgent such a publication would be, but couldn't help himself from penning such a thing onto his to-do list.\n\nThere were still some matters to attend to of course, like who his successor would be and whether there would be any more elections in the future; but such decisions could wait. Vasile had plenty of years left in his feathers to make the necessary arrangements, whatever they might be. At the end of the day, all he needed to do now was relax and enjoy the spoils of his great efforts; perhaps he could even take a holiday!\n\nRinging a small bell by his deck chair, the President smile.

This stallion had long been employed in the government, but hadn't held a real office of considerable power or importance as of yet. He was talented, that much was certain; but before the election the griffon had no need of a Prime Minister. Unfortunately, the situation had escalated significantly since his initial decision to hold a monster-legitimate election\n\n"That is correct. The Harmonist Front have garnered significantly more support than I expected they would be capable of amassing, which is concerning for... Hmm, let's say for the continued stability of the republic." The president explained slowly, giving his wing a slow flap and sighing.\n\nThe earth pony grinned, knowing what that meant. "So the Harmonist Front has become a threat to your presidency and you want to nip any potential influence they might have in the bud before it actually turns into a problem."\n\n"Well, I would have preferred if you could have been a little more tactful about it than that; but yes, you're exactly right." The old bird admitted with a slight chuckle.\n\nWith that, Bean smiled briefly before making a rather severe expression. He wasn't overly interested in helping Vasile run what was essentially a populist dictatorship, but he was rather capable of and somewhat interested in providing a power balance if given the position of prime minister. At the very least, the pay for the job was good.\n\nAfter some slow deliberation, he nodded and looked over to Vasile again. "Alright, I'm in.

Of course he wouldn't be able to send Vasile down for any sort of crimes given the influence he frequently exerted over the various state institutions, but simply knowing how crooked the old bird was behind the scenes was enjoyable in its own right.\n\nUnfortunately, the majority of his work was largely paper-based and - though he was well-suited to piles of files - the affair was far from enjoyable. Stamp, sign, write, talk to secretary, maybe take a few moments to breathe and so on, so forth. There was little to save him from going mad besides his own thoughts and his sweet, if irritatingly timid, secretary Soft Blot.\n\nRight this second however, he had rather more important things on his mind than work. Or, rather, he had more opportunities available to him than simply sitting and working himself to death for however long Vasile managed to stay on top.\n\nAfter all, he had goals of his own.\n\nBean had some of the most important state documents in the country simply going through his hooves at his day job. Surely he could make use of some of them to steadily increase his own influence and contest the President's control of the country himself? In fact, wasn't that essentially how Vasile got into power once Pea Shooter ran off back to Equestria?

Baragzen had taught him how to enjoy having a little too much and Wallnut was always one for making sure every creature had a good time. Alesia was always the one that knew how to clean up afterwards, but that wasn't an issue for Vasile.\n\nAs he sat, almost in a trance in his deck chair, Vasile attempted to contemplate why the warlords had suddenly sprung to mind; only for his drunk mind to come back with little at all. In the end it didn't matter much why he had thought of them. They were all gone, just like everyone else that had tried to oppose his obviously superior methodology for government.\n\nAll gone, nothing to worry about.\n\nHe attempted to sit upright but failed miserably, almost falling over beak-first onto the floor of the balcony.

Unfortunately this limited short term success only left her with the same long term goals that she had always wanted to achieve, which was a harmonic republic for Tobuckians.\n\nJust as she allowed herself to sigh, an all-too-familiar voice chimed out from the counter.

He enquired in a very deliberate fashion, "There is an item that I would like to discuss with the leader of the opposition in a non-professional setting."\n\nThe mare was wide-eyed, but nodded and managed another sip of coffee. "Go ahead, mister president. Congratulations on maintaining your incumbency."\n\nHe gave a superficial smile, then took a moment to settle and speak quietly. "I will be frank with you, the result of this election has been really rather problematic for the TCP. The HF gaining ground has spurred many of our lobbyists to go freelance and will likely work for you instead, come next voting season. Not only that, but it seems as though some of our politicians are becoming progressively more... bipartisan, shall we say. Therefore you and I will need to speak a lot more frequently, and in a more professional setting, if we wish to settle our disputes on policy properly and cordially."\n\nBefore she could even respond, he was up and back to the counter in order to take his coffee and return to work. Clearly he was still busy, trying to pick up the pieces of his failed gamble."
tobuck_vasile.39.a:0 ""Lovely to see you, mister President.""

tobuck_vasile.40.t:0 "Unexpected Results"
tobuck_vasile.40.d:0 "Well, there were certainly better results to hear about than a near loss.\n\nVasile sat calmly in the Presidential office, occasionally glancing at the second desk that had once belonged to Pea Shooter. He couldn't shake the feeling that the gunrunner had done what he had hoped to do, but better. Sure he only stayed around for about a year, but that earth pony had done everything that he'd set out to do. If he'd wanted to stay he probably could have too, it's not as though civil servants had to rely on the roll of the dice that was a public election.\n\nThe old griffon grunted and held his beak in one of his claws, knowing full well that it was his gamble that had led to this outcome. Despite his faults, Pea had done a far better job at staying in charge than he had. What had he been thinking, trying to use an election to cement his power?\n\nLuckily, there was a silver lining to this monumental mistake. If he couldn't make the republic his, then he could focus on profiting from it instead. Democracy was a funny thing really; any politician with significant influence could simply do a decent job, leave the world of politics with all the connections they could want and set up a business. With that they could then lobby, or they could guarantee a lack of scrutiny over said business with which profit margins could drastically increase over time.\n\nThe HF would almost certainly cement their majority by the time the next election rolled around, but it wasn't the end for the old bird. They would have to do a lot more than winning a vote to be rid of him, no matter how well they might do. Even then, with how the vote was going he could claim to be the progenitor of genuine democracy in Tobuck!\n\nAt that thought, Vasile allowed himself to relax and lean back. It was the end of an era, perhaps; but not the end of his story."
tobuck_vasile.40.a:0 "He had nothing to worry about."

tobuck_vasile.41.t:0 "President's Holiday"
tobuck_vasile.41.d:0 "One of the many benefits of having feathers was that extreme temperatures tended to be particularly easy to handle, both hot and cold. Vasile, sitting on a quiet beach with a box of cigars and some liquor, was enjoying the insulation from the heat very much.\n\nElection season was over now and he had decided that it was high time to spend a week or so relaxing where not one creature could hope to bother him. Sure the sand got between his talons and the sun made it hard to read when it was high in the sky, but it was all worth it to step away from politics and relax for a good while.\n\n"What would you like for a meal, sir?" A familiar voice asked the still-sleepy griffon.\n\nFor a moment, the President seemed utterly bewildered. "Hmm? Oh Ihsen, my good stallion! I apologise, in my relaxed state I had almost fallen asleep entirely."\n\nThe earth pony chuckled, taking a few steps towards his employer. "Quite alright, sir. It is a beautiful vista at this time of day; I would fall asleep here myself, if I could. Is lunch of any interest to you, sir?"\n\n"Ahhh..." Vasile gave out, having clocked on to the prior question. "Well, yes! I hadn't realised prior, but I'm rather peckish. What's on the menu?"\n\n"Today the chef has prepared a fish fillet for dinner and, I hear, a rather enjoyable platter of cured meats to have alongside breads, spreads and so on. A light, but satisfactory and pleasant meal." He explained with a smile.\n\nThe griffon smiled, clasping his claws together. "Well, how could I possibly decline that? I'll be back shortly."\n\nThe stallion simply smiled, and turned to go back. "Sir.""
tobuck_vasile.41.a:0 "Even the most important creatures need time off."

tobuck_vasile.42.t:0 "Victory Over Chiropterra"
tobuck_vasile.42.d:0 "Somehow, he had done it. Despite the republic's lacking industry, undersized army and the frankly impossible odds presented, Vasile had led Tobuck through the storm. The suffering and bloodshed that Chiropterra had wrought was over.\n\nDespite the devastation that many now had to live with, the capital was abuzz with celebration and partying. In fact, the entire nation was enjoying the victory of the republic over the heinous and bloodthirsty Chiropterran menace in one way or another. The raiding was over, an existential threat was dealt with, the soldiers were returning home and the regime was safe in the President's capable claws.\n\nVasile, for his part, held speech after speech in the wake of the conflict. He signed autographs, visited soldiers and volunteered in reconstruction efforts; albeit mostly for the sake of his popularity. There was almost a fervorous support for him and the republic forming that had never been present in the years preceding the war. Some called it war fever, others called it simple pride; but the griffon amongst the ponies knew that it was nationalism and popular satisfaction.\n\nWhat a time to be a Tobuckian, what a time to be a citizen of the republic..."
tobuck_vasile.42.a:0 "...and what a time to be the President."
tobuck_vasile.42.b:0 "...and yet some wonder, just what will become of Chiropterra?"

tobuck_vasile.43.t:0 "Letter And Bottle From Tobuck"
tobuck_vasile.43.d:0 "If there's one thing that the world seemed to recognise about [TRD.GetNameDef], it was the nation's expertise in all things profitable. That recognition must have been the main reason behind the recent arrival of a letter originally sent from a rump state on the North Zebrican coast.\n\nAs soon as [TRD.GetLeader] read the opening lines of the letter, it was clear that the creature who had written it was very intelligent; or at least well versed in the art of careful diplomacy. The note - and the wine it had been sent with - was an invitation to a business partnership between [TRD.GetNameDef] and [TBK.GetNameDef].\n\nThis 'Vasile cel Tradat' character was a talented wordsmith, having strung together this offer in a way that sounded particularly enticing and making sure to reiterate a policy of exclusivity of this agreement between our nation and theirs. His republic was a relatively new political entity, but one that was developing rapidly and apparently sought to become a 'Zebrican [TRD.GetName]' of sorts which was an enticing prospect.\n\nOn the one claw, such a proposal could potentially damage our economic influence in Zebrica; but on the other a deal for mutually beneficial business was enticing in its own right. What should the response from [TRD.GetLeader] be?"
tobuck_vasile.43.a:0 "Uncork the bottle and agree!"
tobuck_vasile.43.b:0 "Burn the letter and think nothing more of it."

tobuck_vasile.44.t:0 "Skyfall Accepts"
tobuck_vasile.44.d:0 "Marvellous news has reached the President today! It seems that despite our incredibly frosty relations, [TRD.GetNameDef] has accepted our proposal and has already prepared the necessary paperwork to put everything in order.\n\nThe response came as a surprise to many, given that [TBK.GetNameDef] hasn't the best of international prestiges; but what matters is that we've done it. Needless to say, Vasile has made an address to the nation in an effort to encourage international economic cooperation. Whatever the public may think of this newfound friendship, the average creature is at the very least interested in the potential economic benefits that this deal will provide for them.\n\nUpon returning to the capitol building, Vasile additionally decided that he would host a small dinner party for the administration which is understood to have been a pleasant affair. With any luck, he'll be hosting another with [TRD.GetLeader] some time soon."
tobuck_vasile.44.a:0 "This deserves a smoke!"

tobuck_vasile.45.t:0 "Skyfall Rejects"
tobuck_vasile.45.d:0 "How could they possibly have declined the proposal? Vasile showed the utmost respect to the integrity of [TRD.GetNameDef], its politicians and their great nation!\n\n"Those imbeciles, they've doomed themselves! Left us both poorer over their simple arrogance and blatant continental favouritism!" He clamoured, utterly terrifying his secretary who had hardly seen him quite this distressed in the past.\n\nVasile was not typically an angry griffon, but for once there was more at stake than simple capital. His people and his pride were now at risk because the bumbling buffoons across the ocean couldn't see past their own uppity beaks in order to make a half decent deal!\n\nWhat he really needed now was something to calm the nerves, that and a moment to collect his thoughts for his cowering secretary. "Ugh... I do apologise for my outburst; it seems I am more passionate about the wellbeing of our republic than even I realised. Fetch me my most expensive box of cigars."\n\n"B-but, sir... Those cost more than I make in a month!" The frightened stallion stammered out."
tobuck_vasile.45.a:0 ""Good. The price will take my mind off of those morons.""

tobuck_vasile.46.t:0 "The Troublemakers"
tobuck_vasile.46.d:0 "The thing about youth is that it's a particularly formative part of any creature's life; it can be torn away in an instant, or it can be turned into the defining part of your existence.\n\n"Here, have another bottle! Torch those houses and make sure nothing's left inside to recover when the fire trucks get here!"\n\nIt's also a time in which young stallions and mares have little money, are finding themselves in the world and have the most issues with whatever authority lauds over them. They're easy to persuade, easy to pay and easy to give emotional outlets to; whether those outlets are peaceful or more... dangerous, as the police would say in official reports.\n\n"Take whatever you can find and keep it safe in your own hooves! The government can't be trusted with it and the rich clearly don't want to share!"\n\nVasile understood this very well and was utterly calm as he watched the rioters chant their slogans and destroy parts of the city. After all, he was the one that had paid them - anonymously of course - to start as much chaos as they possibly could.\n\nSoon enough they would be arrested, put in prison and the madness could come to an end; all for one specific purpose. This was the griffon's plan to cement his absolute control. What do you get when you combine nationwide riots that attack the average citizen indiscriminately with general confidence in the government? More government power and popular assent for centralisation reforms in addition to unspoken permission to do whatever it takes to stop the madness.\n\nThose youths tearing up the streets gave Vasile a free pass to do whatever he wanted to the government under the guise of reforms and stabilisation efforts."
tobuck_vasile.46.a:0 "The old bird almost felt bad for the kids."

tobuck_vasile.47.t:0 "Withered Rose"
tobuck_vasile.47.d:0 "The meeting room had gone silent all of a sudden. Each and every member of the Harmonic Front attending the conference had heard the knocking on their room door.\n\nAnother knock followed, this time with a raspy voice attached. "This is police. We're shuttin' down this lil' operation'a yours. Come out this door wit' ya hooves empty an' in single file, or we'll tear the place down tryna getchu all out; an' we WILL getchu all out, one way or another."\n\nThe attendees didn't believe it for a second. They didn't claim to have a warrant, they were actively threatening their safety and none of the HF members present had done anything illegal. Whoever these equines were, they were not police.\n\nBut how would they deal with thugs? It wasn't as though any of them carried firearms, or in fact any weapons for that matter.\n\n"A'right, if you ain't gonna play ball; we'll just force your hoof. Cover your ears if you value them!" The same voice yelled, having not heard any movement.\n\nMost stood up and got ready to get out, some went to hide; but Rose Rain and a few others knew what was coming. They bolted for a secret passage, hidden by a tarpaulin over some palettes and were barely out of sight when they heard the door crack open from a shotgun shot. The sound of gunfire filled their ears as the tunnel filled with echoes of the sound, almost deafening each of the creatures stuffed inside.\n\nAll Rose could think of was how she was going to escape, how she was going to run away and how she was going to somehow achieve their seemingly dead harmonist dreams. What was she going to do? How was she supposed to inform the families of the creatures she knew had just died behind her? What depravity would Vasile sink to next in order to get them all killed?"
tobuck_vasile.47.a:0 "She hoped that harmony could still prevail, in the end."

tobuck_vasile.48.d:0 "There were few creatures on this continent more repulsive than Vasile cel Tradat. He had systematically constructed a state of criminality, violence and fraud in a republic that had once upheld a dream of liberty. Somehow he had survived everything from an economic collapse to political instability and invasion, barely even batting an eye.\n\nUnfortunately, it now seems as though he wishes to make his morally bankrupt regime our problem in a more direct fashion.\n\nHis demand is simple: Cede the entirety of Zumidia or face war over the territory.\n\nOf course this is a very bold move from [TBK.GetNameDef] given their seemingly lacklustre military and economy, but Vasile's government has proven themselves worryingly capable in directing a war effort against seemingly superior foes.\n\nWhilst a war with this despicable creature may be somewhat challenging given his track record, it should be noted that what he will do to Zumidia may be far worse than whatever casualties [Root.GetNameDef] might suffer. If his treatment of the Tobuckian people is any indication, the quality of life for our citizens in the Zumidian territories is almost certain to decline at a rapid pace.\n\nWhat should the administration's official response be?"

tobuck_vasile.50.d:0 ""So we're gettin' alla this stuff 'ere?" The pegasus asked, taking a drag from his cigarette.\n\nBean Counter gulped, then nodded. "That's what you've paid for, sir. Refurbishing the band I take it? You won't be disappointed by our products, I can assure you of that."\n\nThe pony, whoever she was, simply huffed and took a seat in the boardroom. He couldn't tell if she was displeased or vaguely satisfied, but he was certainly thankful that Vasile had put special protections in place for him. Cityside Rifles were proof enough of what could happen to a company if mercenaries got too rowdy; he didn't want to be at risk if that ever happened again, which it might.\n\nIt was times like this when Bean couldn't help but think of home. He did have a family back there, even if they'd stopped talking to him years ago after they had realised what sort of business he was involved in. All the same, maybe Albion was better than this. Maybe the money he was making wasn't worth the hassle and the anxiety. Maybe going back to Equestria was better for him than working for that psychopath of a griffon.\n\nThe stallion cleared his throat and steeled himself, meaning to ask his guest a question. "Will you be transporting the materiel yourself, or would you like the company to take them back to your headquarters? We provide an excellent courier service."\n\nHe couldn't tell if the pegasus was simply thick or if she was actually considering what answer she would give. Obviously she wouldn't want to annoy her superiors, but was she really-\n\n"Whatever's cheaper." She returned decidedly."
tobuck_vasile.50.a:0 "Staying forever certainly wasn't appealing."

tobuck_vasile.51.t:0 "The Top of the World"
tobuck_vasile.51.d:0 "There were few things that Vasile enjoyed more than a smoke on a balcony.\n\nHis penthouse at the top of the fanciest hotel in Tobuck was a far cry from the inner courtyard of his old manor house, but the cigars he preferred hadn't changed. From here he had a nice view over the whole city; it was bustling with casinos, full of just the right kind of stores with all the right kinds of addictive products and the streets were filled with always-celebrating ponies. It was exactly what he wanted it to look like.\n\nOr, rather, it was exactly what made him the most money.\n\nAfter all, each one of those stores paid their taxes and their protection fees. Even the casinos always privately sent him a cut of the money and those partygoers were probably hyped up on whatever it was in those tonics that they'd started putting his name on. For it all, he had a full bank account and a life of complete luxury.\n\nSure it was stressful, demotivating and admittedly rather... Well, morally repugnant at times; but those were just the tools of the trade, were they not?\n\nThe old griffon slouched and allowed his mind to wander back to Pea Shooter. That pony had managed to make more money than sense here, but had at least tried to make his stay in Zebrica mean something good to someone. Even then, he'd had a family to go back to and look after when all was said and done. Even the creature he despised had made his money for a reason, made it for his wife and kids whom he cared about.\n\nVasile took his cigar from his beak and puffed a large billow of smoke, wondering if maybe that 'despicable' pony had been onto something. His republic didn't care about anyone, no matter their wealth or status. If he showed just an instant of weakness it wouldn't take too long for someone to try and take his place; probably in a violent fashion too.\n\nHe put his cigar out on the balcony railing and went back inside."

tobuck_wallnut.1.d:0 "He had to get rid of one of them, that was the hard part. Making friends was fun and having to dispose of any of them was a hard choice, but it was a choice he had to make.\n\nWallnut, usually never one for files and papers, was sat at a new desk with his hooves up; brow furrowed at the two dossiers in front of him. Baragzen and Alesia, the two exiles. One from another country, the other from another continent. Sure they were monarchists and pretty traditional folks, but he was nothing if not open to even the most disparate creatures. They were all warlords, at least they had bonded over that.\n\nOf course the difficult decision remained, in spite of his musings. He needed one friend and one enemy to make sure his government kept itself upright, work with one and target the other. The zebra appreciated a good party, but the earth pony was witty and fun to talk to; in different ways they all got on like a house on fire.\n\nWallnut sighed and set down the dossiers with an uncharacteristic malaise about him. Who would he keep around to set against the other?"

tobuck_wallnut.2.d:0 "It was early afternoon in The Salty Baron, a popular pub on the Tobuckian coastline near the border to Chiropterra. Being in such close proximity to those fanatics often led to interesting conversations about what went on beyond the warning signs tentatively scattered along the coast. \n\n"I hear they sacrifice zebras to their night gods!" Yelled one stallion, swinging a beer around to exaggerate his claim. \n\n"Oh yeah? I hear they summon monsters to foalnap our children in the middle of the night!" Shouted another, stumbling out of her chair. \n\nSoon the locals quickly became hysterical with their fears and claims of all the horrible going-ons inside of Chiropterra, despite the best attempts of the bartender to calm everyone down. Just as the bartender was about to consider extreme measures, he spotted something that made his heart drop into his stomach: a well-dressed thestral accompanied by a small entourage of armed ponies had entered his pub. A warlord's company, no doubt. For now, they seemed to be observing the chaos unfold.\n\nA voice in the crowd rose higher than the others, "Yeah! This place is done for! Who's gonna help us when the Chiropterrans come knocking to enslave us and our kin?!" \n\nThe thestral grinned, then spoke with a charismatic upturn, "Why, me of course!" \n\nMost of the pub turned to the stranger who had entered. Some were bewildered, others suspicious. "And who are you supposed to be?" One asked. \n\n"Lemme tell ya somethin'," said the thestral as he hopped onto one of the tables, "All the stories you were sayin' about Chiropterra? All true. Every one of 'em. I know this cause I, Wallnut Drive, escaped their clutches years ago. And that means there ain't nopony better suited to protect ya from them than me." \n\nWhether it was because of the alcohol or Wallnut's charming grin, the crowd seemed to accept his reassurances, much to the bartender's relief."

He'd been hearing nothing but good things about his forces lately, and so he had decided to get a snazzy new outfit to celebrate his inevitable triumph. His lieutenants couldn't help but wonder why he had decided to do this in the war room of all places.\n\nSaid lieutenants briefly exchanged looks, then one of them continued, "Well sir, the remainder of Chiropterra's forces have fled into the countryside. Their leadership and command structure collapsed when we took their cities, and for the most part the cities themselves are fully intact. However, the majority of the armouries and arms silos were demolished before we could get to them, and-"\n\n"Hold that thought," interrupted Wallnut. He frowned, looking at the map of Chiropterra on the central table. A moment later, his eyes brightened up and he flashed a smile towards his lieutenants. "Is that one big hotel in the capital still intact? I think it was called the Dreamscape."\n\n"Uh, it should be? New Ayacachtli is relatively untouched. But I don't see how that's-"\n\n"Secure it immediately." Wallnut clasped his hooves together in excitement, much to the annoyance of his tailor who was still trying to get measurements.\n\nIf his lieutenants were confused before, they were now completely befuddled. "With all due respect, sir... why?"\n\nWallnut's grin grew wider and wider as his imagination went wild, "Because all victories need to be celebrated, of course. I have just the plan for it too...""

tobuck_wallnut.4.t:0 "Two Old Thinkers"
tobuck_wallnut.4.d:0 "The celebrations had gone on long into the night, to the point that some of the older folks were finding it hard to sleep. Dusk Wane was one such individual. His bones ached as he stepped out of the luxurious bed that had been provided for him. Surprisingly enough, being one of Chiropterra's less popular Moonspeakers had earned him an invitation to stay in the most expensive hotel the warlord could find. Though he found the apostate's blatant disregard for the Nightmare's teachings to be heretical, he couldn't help but feel that the young stallion was simply misguided and that it wasn't too late for the warlord to change his ways. \n\n"Can't sleep either, comrade? Or is that not a suitable term?"\n\nDusk gingerly rubbed his eyes. In the hall was an elderly earth pony smoking a cigarette. Dusk recalled seeing him a few times before, some old irredeemable marksist from Maregypt. Niftyn was his name, right? "These younger folks have more energy than I thought possible. I need some air so if you don't mind, I'll be on my way."\n\nNiftyn shook his head, "You'll find it difficult to find a quiet place here, Dusk. I've known Wallnut for a long time. Every corner of this place will be lively until they all collapse from exhaustion."\n\n"Then why don't you go join them, 'comrade'? This hall could be a little less lively as it is."\n\n"I was never one for celebrations that do not include the poor and impoverished," Niftyn took a puff of his cigarette, "There are still quite a lot of those here in Tobuck, far outside of the luxury of this hotel."\n\n"There's far..." Dusk almost raised his voice, but then realized that he actually agreed with the other stallion's statement. He stepped over to rest against the same wall as Niftyn, sighing deeply, "Yes. Maybe we can agree on one thing." Dusk glanced over to the other stallion, who was holding out another cigarette; a truce of sorts. Dusk chuckled and accepted it. "Maybe two things.""

tobuck_wallnut.5.d:0 "The cup of coffee in Bean Counter's hooves looked as though it was about to be dropped at any moment. Both he and Home Brew were more than a little concerned for their own safety, but at least the latter wasn't a complete nervous wreck.\n\nThe less anxious of the two stallions tried to offer kind words, "Hey, come on. We'll be fine. A couple of stops on the way and we're out before the sun sets; nothing will happen to us."\n\n"I-It's not..." Bean started, immediately needing to catch his breath before continuing. "Waiting m-makes it... w-worse..." He managed after a moment.\n\nGiven the very real risk that they could be shot as traitors for the duration of their wait, that was reasonable. Luckily they were unlikely to be recognised, so long as Wallnut himself didn't trot into the café they were trying to relax in.\n\n"Ain't much worse than waiting, I couldn't agree more!" A familiar voice gave out loudly.\n\nOh no.\n\nBean jumped out of his fur coat and pressed himself against the wall of their booth whilst his friend simply stared wide-eyed at their unexpected guest. He was right there, right in front of them. Did he come in here to get something on the way back to the palace? At this point it seemed more likely that the universe simply wanted to spite them.\n\n"All good? You both look like you've just fallen head-first into Tartarus!" The Generalissimo added, unbothered by their utter terror. "Well, was just lookin' for you two; I've got a party lined up for us all at some fancy hotel. I'll see you both there, eh?"\n\nAnd just like that, he was gone as soon as he had appeared. The two remaining and utterly mortified ponies looked at one another with complete understanding."
tobuck_wallnut.5.a:0 "Now was a good chance to get out."

tobuck_wallnut.6.t:0 "Jumpy Arrival"
tobuck_wallnut.6.d:0 "This was a terrible idea. At least, it felt like a terrible idea. To be fair he hadn't had much choice when the car and an armoured transport full of soldiers had turned up to his temporary residence, but it didn't make Carrot Stick any more comfortable. Just because they hadn't explicitly forced him into the vehicle didn't mean this wasn't some sort of trap, though equally he could believe that Wallnut was throwing some sort of 'party' at the expense of thestral dignity.\n\nA few more minutes of watching the world go by out of the tinted windows and they had arrived at the hotel, only to be greeted by the pony himself.\n\n"Well if it ain't Carrot Stick! How've you been since we saw each other last?" The warlord asked gleefully, trotting over without a care in the world.\n\nOf course they'd never actually met, what with Wallnut being a traitor and an apostate, but they had known of each other for many years. Unfortunately the civil servant was very far from fond of the mercenary commander despite his unusually reformist outlook on governance. He simply said nothing and sighed; letting his head hang slightly.\n\n"Well, lemme know if you want anything before the celebrations start. I'll be inside if you need me." The rebel offered with surprising humility, at least making an effort towards reconciliation.\n\nAnother car, similarly escorted, had arrived and unloaded as the Generalissimo casually trotted away. Rose Rain looked just as unnerved as Carrot, which was why they drifted towards one another as they slowly made their way inside the hotel.\n\n"He could do so much for this place, but his first port of call is to party." The mare gave out, clearly as disappointed by the host as she was confused and annoyed.\n\nHe hadn't intended to speak to anyone here, but that comment had caught the thestral off guard. "Quite. All that power and charisma, wasted on alcohol and music."\n\n"A Chiropterran statespony agreeing with a harmonist... Small world, huh?"\n\nAt that, Carrot Stick smiled."

Even the ones that were still up and at it - though they were few and far between - finally had to take a moment and adjust as the real world came and tore them away from their drunken stupor.\n\nHere? Already? Guests had begun to get up and get out with some staff helping them and their unbearable hangovers whilst others were trying to keep them inside. Some scuffles broke out, the outside of the hotel was utter chaos and Wallnut was nowhere to be found.\n\nThose that had half a mind to save more than just themselves tried to look for him, but apparently he had disappeared into thin air. The average lieutenant and businesscreature were barely even awake, let alone coherent enough to make a proper search party.\n\nHowever, by chance, there were some guests that were not experiencing the aftereffects of a long night of partying and drinking; the Generalissimo was eventually found by..."

tobuck_wallnut.8.d:0 ""I am curious about one thing, Niftyn. Why is it that you suggested hiding here in the wine cellar from the chaos above?"\n\nNiftyn coughed twice. "Dusk, this is a place where ponies go to celebrate, not fight. Wine is also very valuable when intact, and thus- Wait, do you hear that?"\n\nA long groan was heard from behind several large barrels towards the back of the cellar. The two comrades looked towards one another, then slowly peeked around the barrels. Therein laid an absolute mess of a pony, legs splayed out in all directions and several half-drunk wine bottles spilled both on the ground and on the uniform of the one and only Wallnut Drive. He opened his eyes, hiccuped, then half-grinned at the older ponies. "Hey guys... how are -hic- you?"\n\nDusk let out a long sigh. Was this truly what Tobuck had come to? A place where the 'important' ponies partied all day while riots broke out all around them? His bones ached just thinking about it. He offered a hoof to the drunken warlord, "Wallnut, are you all right?"\n\nWallnut flung his hoof in the general direction of Dusk's, but only connected on the third try. "Y-yeah, never -hic- better... whasabout yous?"\n\n"Wallnut, we're..." Niftyn couldn't help but picture where Tobuck might end up if Wallnut continued down this path, or even if a united Tobuck could survive in this state. Regardless, he also helped the young warlord up, "...We're just tired. That's all."\n\n"Huh?" Wallnut rubbed his eyes, suddenly processing that his friends seemed to be more than just tired. "No, no... yer not. Please -hic- tell me whats I can do to help you feels -hic- better..."\n\nDusk and Niftyn looked at one another again. They could see in each other's eyes that both of them had the same idea. One of them reached out to place a hoof on the Generalissimo, "Wallnut...""

tobuck_wallnut.10.d:0 ""This was a terrible idea."\n\nGiven the precious little that they had found so far, Carrot Stick was probably correct in that assessment. As it turned out, the only documents that the warlord seemed to be keeping in his room at the hotel were ledgers from the various companies that had been contracted to provide for this party. Sneaking in, drunk as the entire hotel may have been, clearly hadn't been worth the risk.\n\nRose Rain hoofed over the bits of paper with a frown, "Not entirely fruitless though, now we know for sure that we should get out before-"\n\nJust as the thestral went to replace the 'documents' in a convincingly messy fashion, the bathroom door creaked loudly open. The uninvited guests could only stop and stare as they watched a barely-clothed and terribly hungover Wallnut step out, toothbrush firmly locked between his teeth. Clad in only a towel to cover his hindquarters, the stallion simply glanced at both of them and shrugged before going back into the bathroom to spit out the toothpaste.\n\nA moment later he returned, cleared his throat and held out a hoof. "Ugh... Look, I'm gonna be honest; I need your help. I'm... I'm gonna put on some clothes, try and figure out what in Tartarus is going on and do my best to get things sorted. Once things look a little less chaotic... Mmm... You can try your hooves at governing; that sound good?" he asked, managing a smile that convincingly hid his assumedly brutal headache.\n\nThe pair looked at one another, an idea already fully formed in their heads.

### Wallnut Harmony events

tobuck_wallnut.11.t:0 "One Shared Vision"
tobuck_wallnut.11.d:0 "The family of five was huddled around the radio they'd managed to get for the kitchen, more morbidly curious than hopeful. The last time somepony had taken over Tobuck they'd turned it into a smuggler's heaven, which didn't exactly bode well for this new 'Wallnut Drive' fellow. The foals liked him at least, though grandmare was far from convinced.\n\nSoft Brie carefully tuned the radio to the address that had been slated for the evening before sauntering over to sit next to her husband. "What do you think he'll do with this place?"\n\nThe stallion simply looked at her, then at his mother and grimaced as the frequency came to life.\n\n"...Now I know what's on all your minds, what with the war and Pea's fun little deal with the Zarantians. I know a lotta you would probably wanna go through with it too, returnin' to the peaceful life under the tribes an' all. But, I ask of all of you, would anythin' change? Would you 'ave any more freedom? Would you 'ave any more of that representation?"\n\nDim Bulb glanced at his wife who looked back with confusion in her eyes, over to the old mare in the corner who scoffed and picked up the paper as Wallnut Drive's speech continued. He had a point, this city really had never been truly free to do as its people desired.\n\n"My friends and I, though I should really call 'em my advisors, 'ave put together a few ideas. Carrot Stick, Rose Rain and myself are gonna be turnin' this place into a real democracy; harmony an' all. Oh an' of course we want your help to make it the best..."\n\nThe couple tuned out most of the rest, though their foals were still enthralled by the charisma of the thestral on the air. Unsurprisingly their grandmare had already sauntered into the kitchen with a disapproving look on her face, assuming it was another scam; but Dim and Soft were quietly hopeful."
tobuck_wallnut.11.a:0 "Maybe he'll actually do it."

tobuck_wallnut.12.t:0 "Foundations Of The Federation"
tobuck_wallnut.12.d:0 ""Rose, I understand where you're coming from but you're ignoring the practical limitations of our predicament. Neither Tobuck nor Chiropterra have any prior history of democracy or harmony; we need the president to remain powerful so that things remain stable whilst we set everything up, otherwise it will just fall apart by the time our work is done." The thestral insisted, gesturing vaguely at Wallnut Drive every so often.\n\nThe mare sighed and shook her head before responding, "And I see what you're getting at, but if we empower the president whilst reforming the country then what reason would the people have to engage in democracy? Why would they willingly vote for change in a regime that works and is already making the changes they want to see?"\n\nAs the two continued to bicker about what the right course of action was, Wallnut set down his newspaper with the half-finished crossword that had been provided by his secretary; one Soft Blot. He might not understand much about politics, but he knew how to resolve a hot debate between friends; even though his methods for such were typically rather primitive.\n\n"Both of you, shut it for just a mo." He demanded in an unfamiliar bark, presumably the tone he took when commanding.\n\nThe pair nodded as he pulled up a chair and sat beside them.\n\n"Thank you. Now, I figure this might be a little hard to comprehend; but I'll break it down for ya. What if you just do both? Give the president their powers and make 'em accountable to the representatives or whatever. Power with scrutiny, right?" He offered, resting his chin on his hooves.\n\nFor a moment they sat in shock, glancing at one another both for the fact that Wallnut had actually involved himself in a political discussion and because his idea wasn't that bad. In fact, they were both a little miffed that they hadn't thought of it themselves."
tobuck_wallnut.12.a:0 "Power to the people and to the president!"

tobuck_wallnut.13.t:0 "The Inquiry Of The Century"
tobuck_wallnut.13.d:0 "Heavy Hoof could feel the tension in the air as he took his seat in court, presiding today over a trial that was both military and civilian. The whole affair made the pony rather uncomfortable in spite of his typically stern and stable approach to matters, not least because he feared the response from both the Chiropterrans and the Tobuckians. Crimes could certainly be deliberated on, but a verdict of guilty would no doubt annoy the former and a verdict of not guilty would outrage the latter.\n\nAll the same, he had a duty to law and order. "Good afteroon, mares and gentlecolts. Calling the case of the people of the state of Tobuck versus Ocean Spray. Are both sides ready to begin?"\n\n"Ready on behalf of the people, Your Honour." A relatively young Zebra replied.\n\nAn earth pony, the only lawyer with enough guts to attempt a defence of Ocean Spray's case, responded second. "Ready on behalf of the defence, Your Honour."\n\nAs his clerk rattled off the expected legalease, Heavy Hoof considered the trial again; looking intently at the thestrals on the defence for a moment. He had heard about the declassification of much of the LMRD's documentation, but this would be the first time it would be used in court.\n\nThe young attorney stood to give his opening statement as the clerk finished, "Your Honour, mares and gentlecolts of the jury: the defendant has been charged with multiple instances of wilful killing, multiple instances of torture or increature treatment including but not limited to biological experimentation, multiple instances of wilfully causing great suffering and serious injury to body or health, multiple instances of wilfully depriving a prisoner of war or other protected person of the rights of fair and regular trial, multiple instances of unlawful confinement, multiple instances of employing asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases - and all analogous liquids - materials or devices in both medical malpractice and wartime affairs, multiple instances of committing outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment, multiple instances of..."\n\nThe jury, composed of both Tobuckians and Chiropterrans, were mortified as the list simply went on and on and on."

tobuck_wallnut.14.d:0 ""I will reiterate that elections that prevent non-democratic representatives and parties from running may well be free, but they are not fair. We cannot abandon the federation's founding principles of liberty, especially when considering the promises we made to the people." Rose Rain explained again, the tone of her voice exasperated.\n\nCarrot Stick shook his head and sighed, "And I will remind you that stratocracy and illberal ideas run deep in Chiropterra which makes up the majority of the eligible voting population in the federation. The risk of reactionary forces gaining enough ground, whatever form they may take, is much higher than you would believe. Democracy is under threat and will be for many years to come."\n\n"And you want to set a precedent of banning parties in a fledgling harmonic state?" She retorted with a scoff.\n\nHe grimaced at the thought but nodded, "A precedent can be overturned later, but safety and security are needed now more than ever. If this is what it takes to keep the risk of anti-democratic forces out of power, then it should be done."\n\nThey both sat back and looked at the seat in the office that Wallnut was usually resting in, but found only an empty chair. For once he was away, touring the newly created federal districts as a show of goodwill to the people of the federation. As the earth pony and the thestral turned back to look at one another, they knew that one of them had to relent to the other."

tobuck_wallnut.15.t:0 "At The Booth"
tobuck_wallnut.15.d:0 "It was hardly surprising that a Tobuckian resident didn't know how to vote, but trying to help them was usually a little problematic. Typically they didn't understand the whole 'secret ballot' thing, which would lead to the booth workers needing to ask them to vote again after seeing their ballot which itself was usually filled in wrong.\n\n"Hmm. What do I do now?" A young stallion asked, turning around and revealing to the entire room his vote and invalidating it in an instant.\n\nOne of the booth workers sighed, smiled and got up to help. "Here, let me give you a hoof. I'm afraid you're going to have to do it again, since you've just shown me your supposedly secret ballot."\n\n"Oh, right. Sorry." He returned sheepishly as the mare approached him.\n\nShe sauntered past him and got out another ballot from the box of various papers, then turned around so as to not see who he was voting for. "You aren't the first today, don't worry about it. Now, put a little cross in the box of whoever it is that you'd like to vote for and don't show anyone once you've done that."\n\nThe stallion stood still for a minute, apparently considering who to vote for a second time before putting pencil to paper and making a little 'x' on the sheet. "Alright, what next?"\n\n"Now you fold it in half so nobody else can see it, and then you put it in the box over there; folded and all." She added, turning around once she'd heard him delicately fold the paper in two.\n\nHe did as he was told and then looked at the mare in surprise. "Wait, that's it?"\n\n"Yep! You can go and enjoy the fair now.""
tobuck_wallnut.15.a:0 "Well, that wasn't so bad."

tobuck_wallnut.16.t:0 "After the Booth"
tobuck_wallnut.16.d:0 "It wasn't like most of his parties, but it certainly wasn't anything to turn one's snout up at either. Parades were fun in their own right after all, what with all the waving and the cheering and the elation on everypony's faces; in fact this was the first parade Wallnut Drive had seen since escaping Chiropterra and tartarus if it didn't feel good to be the centre of it all.\n\nTruth be told, the thestral hadn't arranged any of this. His generals and friends, knowing that he would have tried to involve himself on the ground, had put all of this together in the background without him and sprung the event as a surprise. Needless to say that he was immensely pleased with the party that they had arranged and, though he was still far from teatoal, Wallnut was appreciative of the fact that he didn't have to get hammered to have a good time.\n\nA little behind him on his podium, an earth pony stood and smiled. "Do you need anything, sir? Some water?"\n\n"I ever tell ya that you're the best sec I ever had? Ya managed to keep me unaware of alla this an' as I'm standin' here enjoyin' it, ya ask me if I need anythin' else to boot." The Generalissimo responded, turning his head to look at the mare with a warm smile.\n\nAt that she waved a hoof dismissively and looked at the floor for just a moment, "I... Well, thank you sir; it is my job."\n\nIt was, in fact, far beyond the purview of her job they both knew it.\n\n"Soft Blot, what ya can do for me is take the rest of the day off; yeah? Don't let me catch ya workin' hard after alla this." He returned, giving a jokey order.\n\nHis secretary chuckled and nodded, "As you say, sir." before sauntering off.\n\nFor the moment Wallnut Drive was more than happy to stand, smile and wave at the parading soldiers and the generalship that led the divisions. He was happy that everypony else was happy."

tobuck_wallnut.17.d:0 "Honey Dew had always been a diligent filly; it was all about worshipping the Nightmare, hating the Sunnies, listening to the sermons and trying to help out her parents. Or at least she had been until recently.\n\nFor whatever reason the war that she'd heard about from some of her friends had resulted in some changes to school, and really to life in general with all this harmony stuff. Most importantly however, one of her closest friends had been whisked away to Tobuck on an exchange and in his place sat an earth pony. He was quiet for the most part, save for when he tried and failed to answer pointed questions about his family and whether he worshipped the Nightmare or not. Oddly enough, when their new teacher overheard the latter question on one occasion she sighed and had to take her out of class for a chat. Was he a spy? Was the teacher a spy too? She was nice, but the nice ones were always the traitors that were hardest to find.\n\nNeedless to say the colt - Saleet was apparently his name - wasn't having a good time. Even Honey occasionally dropped comments behind his back despite her typically kind-hearted nature. He was an easy target, especially with how different their lessons had suddenly become with the new staff and the 'federal curriculum' everypony was talking about. Before they'd hardly even heard of democracy and now it was changing everything, it was the simplest thing to pin all their concerns on somepony that was different.\n\nAt the very least their collective fear of the outsider made study relatively easy and kept them engaged with the lessons. The earth pony struggled a lot in class and had seemingly only just learnt to read, but he always came back for more. Every day his lexicon improved, and every day Honey Dew respected his resolve a little more."

tobuck_wallnut.18.d:0 "One lunch as Saleet sat on a bench in the playground with his lunch and one of the books they had been looking at in class, a thestral gingerly approached him. He averted his eyes after seeing her at first, keen to stay well away from the groups of local colts and fillies that liked to ask him difficult questions; but she was alone. That was unusual enough for him to tentatively smile and put down the novel.\n\nShe smiled back and stopped in front of him, "It's Saleet, right? Mind if I sit next to you?"\n\n"Uhm... Y-yeah, and no not at all." He responded timidly, "You're... Honey Dew?"\n\n"Sure am!"\n\nHis speech had drastically improved since first she had heard him talk, which was some months ago now. Actually she kind of regretted not talking to the poor earth pony before, given that he seemed to not have made any friends. The new teachers hadn't been able to help much.\n\n"Are you uhm... Gonna ask me something?" Saleet then enquired, fearing the worst.\n\nShe scrunched her face for a moment, before settling on honesty. "Well yes, but not like that. Not like they do. You seem nice and I wanted to talk to you, ask you how you're doing."\n\n"Oh, that's... That's new. Well I could be better, I-I think. Reading is hard with the wind." He returned, making a little nervous laugh.\n\n"I get it. We can go to the library if you like; it's quiet there too, sometimes I read there when I don't feel like talking much."\n\nHe thought for a moment before beaming and repacking his lunch box, "I...

tobuck_wallnut.19.d:0 "As of late, our old equine friends in Tobuck have taken a rather drastic turn in policy. Far from the fraudulent republic that existed mere years ago, there now exists a harmonic federation helmed by none other than [TBK.GetLeader]. Many are understandably surprised by this rapid political development, but up until recently relations have still been relatively frosty.\n\nDespite our lacklustre efforts regarding foreign relations between our nations, this morning the administration received a truly fascinating telegram which contained an interesting offer. [TBK.GetNameDef] has offered us a position in the Hazrumenian union, an alliance and economic union. Though accepting this proposal requires us to forfeit minor parts of existing foreign policy and may involve a little compromise regarding economics, the Hazrumenian union could provide our nation with incredible wealth and prosperity.\n\nNeedless to say that the 'Hazrumenian Question' has become rather divisive. Clearly [TBK.GetNameDef] is not demanding our subjugation and we shall benefit from their assistance, but many question if it is worth relenting some of our sovereignty."

Already [TBK.GetLeader] had arranged for a state visit to secure local support for the union and to reassure any uncertain elements within the Warzenan state.\n\nToday is a great day for the federation and for the union, one that shall be recorded in history as a positive turning point for cooperation across the Hazrumenian region for years to come."

tobuck_wallnut.21.d:0 "After what we assume to be much internal debate, the Warzenans have unfortunately declined our proposed offer of union; citing primarily the issue of national sovereignty.\n\nThis was not unexpected given Warzena's history of less-than-warm diplomatic relations with Tobuck and their qualms over what they consider to be the 'occupied' territory of Miharzehir. This response is nevertheless unfortunate and [TBK.GetLeader] has publicly voiced their simultaneous dissatisfaction as well as their understanding of the reasoning behind the decision. No harm was done, in the end.\n\nOn the other hoof, some elements within their administration have asked that we do not entirely abandon our goal of a Hazrumenian Warzena, which leads us to believe that they may not decline the deal if we propose it again at a later date."

There are some cultural ties, and some Zumidian leaders have expressed interest in joining with the up and coming Hazrumenian Union, although the Zumidians themselves seem quite divided on the matter.\n\nSome within our government have suggested we accept this deal, as Wallnut's interests align with ours in many ways, while others urge us to reject the deal and prepare to fight this Wallnut Drive, who they consider a petty warlord no matter how Harmonist his rhetoric. Still others suggest a compromise, whereby we end the Zumidian mandate on the condition that Zumidia be an independent member-state of the Hazrumenian Union rather than as part of ULNZ, which would ease some Zumidian worries while probably not angering the rising power."

Silverstream careened from topic to topic, discussing everything from the plumbing system of Ain Trotgourait to the finer points of the relationship between Harmony and democracy. It was all Rose Rain could do to keep her on topic, but as long as she stayed roughly on track, they made excellent progress.\n\nThere was something refreshing about the Hippogriff's negotiations. It was nothing like Tobuckian politics, full of competing interests, backroom deals and overinflated egoes. The rest of North Zebrica knew the hippogriffs as haughty, self-righteous, autocratic, arrogant, but Silverstream belied all those stereotypes, and it was clear that once the hippogriffs committed to something, there were no ulterior motives or delays.\n\nAfter only four days out of the six allocated for the conference, the major points were settled: the timetable of Hippogriff withdrawal, the role of King Zamni and the regency council in local government going forward, the status of Arisian-Zumidians and Zumidian-Arisians, the issue of Aris-owned businesses operating in Zumidia...

It won't be easy. You have no idea how much effort it took, even with Hippogriffia's help, to rebuild anything even close to a functional state."\n\n"Storm King hit you pretty hard," Carrot mused, "I'm worried too, myself. All these idealists, they think all the Nightmareist fanaticism of Chiropterra, all the seedy business of Tobuck, that it'll all just be gone forever just because things are good right now."\n\n"Just what I thought," agreed Azrael, "I felt trapped, you know? Zumidia was stuck between a rock and a hard place. "Be part of [HIP.GetName], or be part of [CTH.GetName]?" Independence... never really seemed an option, and [HIP.GetName] seemed the better choice. Still, I was worried. Still am, really. The Hippogriffs are friendly now, but I saw the Aris First movement practically calling for our enslavement. And they got real popular. They could again."\n\nCarrot Stick grimaced. "Well, I can only hope that once he's of age, Zamni's able to keep a lid on that kind of populism."\n\nAzrael poured them each a glass of wine.

[HIP.GetNameDef] had requested an incredible sum of money in compensation for the annexation of the Zumidian territories. So extortionate was the price that many prominent politicians had already publicly described the demand as a ransom rather than an appropriate fee.\n\nThere was of course a second issue, one that most other representatives didn't have to contend with: Wallnut Drive didn't have the slightest clue about finances, beyond how much money it took to host a party of course.\n\nThe tricky thestral read over the proposal, enjoying an afternoon coffee. "So... That many zeros is a lot, ain't it?"\n\n"Yes, yes it is. It's several times the national budget and would take many years to..." The aide began, before realising that the Generalissimo probably didn't even understand the concept of national debt. "It would hurt. It's a tartarus of a lot of money and there's a reason most are saying the offer is an insult. We could still take it, we could also counter by sending a revised offer that reduces the amount of money to be paid at the risk of having it turned down or we can just... take it. Or try, at least." Carrot explained nervously.\n\nWallnut set his cup down on the table, brow furrowed and hooves shortly clasped together. Now he understood what all the fuss had been about when the message was received, not least for the fact that there was a risk of war should they refuse the proposal.\n\n"Well ain't that somethin'. An' you all need me to make a decision, huh." He addended, mulling over the options. "Nothin' like the lives of millions at stake to ruin ya coffee break."\n\nIf it weren't for the seriousness of the subject, that might have gotten a chuckle from Carrot. "That is correct.

Needless to say many hippogriff businesses had vacated the area recently, either concerned about their economic interests or not wanting any part of the Hazrumenian dream; but some had returned once they saw that the region was being treated well.\n\nWith that said, it didn't prevent Rose Rain and Carrot Stick having an argument over policy. It seemed that they were rather fond of having spats like this.\n\n"Economic investments that benefit the locals will incentivise them to cooperate with the state and the federation as a whole. After all of the Hippogriffs left it's imperative that we make sure their standard of living does not decrease, lest they quickly learn to despise us." Carrot Stick mused, sipping a cup of tea between sentences.\n\nRose Rain smiled and shook her head in disagreement, "You're right about making sure they live well under our jurisdiction, but not about much else I'm afraid. Economics aren't the only way to a creature's heart, though I'm sure they would appreciate us not making their lives worse. The important thing is that we get down on the ground and help them face-to-face so that they don't see us as just another load of occupiers. Money is well and good, but that's exactly how the hippogriffs did it too."\n\nHe grunted and finished off his tea, acquiescing to the fact that she made a good point despite his adamancy that he was nevertheless correct.

In hindsight it was rather strange that Wallnut Drive was capable of doing so much good for so many people with it all stemming from a party, but who were they to judge the methods of the Generalissimo?\n\nSat on the big desk in the presidential office, Rose's expression suddenly hardened as she had a particular thought. "Truth be told, I'm surprised that we managed all of this. Not in terms of how quickly we've created harmonic democracy, though that is admittedly impressive in its own right, but more that it's worked at all."\n\nThe less loud of the two thestrals was taken aback by that, "What? Really? You always sounded so confident with what you said, especially when you got your way with policy. Why bring this up now?"\n\n"Well I..." The earth pony managed before putting her glass down, "I wanted to say thank you, to both of you; for everything. You've done a lot for me as well as the federation and I... Well, I didn't want to ignore that on a day like this."\n\nFor a little while, the room was silent. The pair of politicians looked at one another for a moment and just smiled, occasionally glancing at Wallnut who quickly realised that he probably shouldn't get hammered right here and now.\n\nUnfortunately, he did have to break the silence.

Many are understandably surprised by this rapid political development, but up until recently relations have still been relatively frosty.\n\nDespite our lacklustre efforts regarding foreign relations between our nations, this morning the administration received a truly fascinating telegram which contained an interesting offer. [TBK.GetNameDef] has offered us a position in the Hazrumenian union, an alliance and economic union. Though accepting this proposal requires us to forfeit minor parts of existing foreign policy and may involve a little compromise regarding economics, the Hazrumenian union could provide our nation with incredible wealth and prosperity.\n\nNeedless to say that the 'Hazrumenian Question' has become rather divisive amongst the tribes, particularly following the debacle with Pea Shooter. Clearly [TBK.GetNameDef] is not demanding our subjugation and we shall benefit from their assistance, but many question if it is worth relenting some of our sovereignty and tribal traditions in order to make it work."

Already [TBK.GetLeader] had arranged for a state visit to secure local support for the union and to reassure any uncertain elements within the Zarantian tribal structure.\n\nToday is a great day for the federation and for the union, one that shall be recorded in history as a positive turning point for cooperation across the Hazrumenian region for years to come."

This response is nevertheless unfortunate and [TBK.GetLeader] has publicly voiced their simultaneous dissatisfaction as well as their understanding of the reasoning behind the decision. No harm was done, in the end.\n\nOn the other hoof, some elements within their administration have asked that we do not entirely abandon our goal of a Hazrumenian Warzena, which leads us to believe that they may not decline the deal if we propose it again at a later date."

As of yet there was no particular precedent set as to what should happen to conquered Hazrumenian territories. They could incorporate the lands into the federation directly, or the Generalissimo and his companions could release the lands to function as a supervised harmonist state of their own.\n\nEven Carrot Stick, for all the fire he could usually muster, was relatively ambivalent. "Well, in the end it doesn't particularly matter from an ideological point of view. We were a victorious defending power in this war, which leaves us with the capacity to take either option." He explained to Wallnut Drive who, for once, was attentive. "I think it'd be better to do as we've done with Chiropterra for the sake of continuity; that being integration and cooperation. It would make the lands much easier to police if nothing else.\n\n"Well that may be true, but according to some projections the Zarantians are more than capable of constructing a powerful wasteland economy through well-travelled trade routes across the immense deserts of central Zebrica. I think that the construction of a client state and subsequently allowing that self-deterministic nation to exist will be better for us economically and better for the Zarantians socially." Rose Rain returned, marking the silence with a slight frown.\n\nThey both turned to Wallnut, expecting him to make a decision. This was one of the few policy arguments he'd arbitrated in which he was an active participant and not holding the two ponies back from fighting one another. Perhaps they really were managing to get along, despite their differences.\n\nIn any case, the deciding vote was now his."

Sure he could schmooze and he could party, but asking Soft Blot out to get a coffee was far and beyond his comfort zone. Not that it was a truly dangerous task of course, she accepted the offer in a heartbeat.\n\nThe thestral shuffled a little, putting both hooves around his cup of coffee. "Y'know, last time I was in this lil' place I was talking to Bean Counter and Home Brew after the war with Chiropterra.

She gave out with a little chuckle, "Just thinking of the amount of paperwork he would have me handle is... Well, you know him just as well as I do."\n\nAt that they both shared a quiet laugh, enjoying their drinks and ignoring the stares from the stunned onlookers. They were mostly marvelling at the fact the Generalissimo was actually right there in front of them, but a few had managed to clock onto what was going on. It wasn't as though they were making their affections particularly subtle, nor were either party really capable of hiding their feelings even if they had wanted to.\n\nWith another anxious expression, Wallnut leaned over the table just a little. "I uhm.. Before we go any further with uh... this, whatever we want it to be, I just wanna make sure that you're okay with all of it. I ain't much for gaugin' this sorta thing and some ponies say that workplace relationships are-"\n\nTo the thestral's immense surprise, Soft leaned in and gave him a brief but genuine kiss on the snout. For a good few moments, he simply sat there and processed that very simple response to his question; eventually shaking his head and looking up at her with rosey cheeks.\n\n"A certain 'tricky thestral' once told me that you miss out on every opportunity that you don't take."

There was a dream at stake here, one that two ponies were willing to do many things to achieve.\n\nPublicly Wallnut too is celebrated as a hero; a courageous young leader who, with his own genius and skill, has found victory for his people. There is a feeling of unity amongst the public, one that could be considered deeply ironic if only the wider populace knew of the slowly deepening divide between the two factions in the government. For now they cooperate, at least when in view of the citizens of the federation, but there is no guarantee that the status quo will continue.

It had been an exhausting day negotiating between the various groups representing the workers of Chiropterra, but he had managed to secure cooperation between them under his leadership. Even some moonspeakers had joined his cause, though not so much for their love of Dusk as opposed to their fear of what Wallnut would do to them.\n\nWallnut Drive... Dusk leaned back in his chair. He often wondered how the Generalissimo had gotten to this point. To rise above all the other warlords in Tobuck and unite the small country under his banner. Against all odds, he had defeated the mighty legions of Chiropterra as well. To an outside observer, one might think that Wallnut was a strategic genius and destined for greatness, perhaps he was, but Dusk knew what he was really like.\n\nWallnut was a buffoon. A charismatic buffoon for sure, but not a threat. No, the real threat was Niftyn who had already managed to gather several hardline communists under his leadership in Tobuck. Even though they had shared some drinks at the hotel, Dusk knew that their visions for the future were too incompatible with one another for them to truly cooperate. Already lines were being drawn and factions were gaining ground. A civil war was out of the question, but the future of the U.L.N.Z. would be decided not by any public grandstanding from Wallnut. It would instead be decided by the remaining rank and file of what used to be Chiropterra.\n\nDusk intended to make sure that Niftyn's cronies didn't take away that future from those who deserved it, even if it meant making tough choices to protect what was left of his homeland."

In truth, the workers of Nightmare Steelworks had found it difficult to believe that the factory was actually reopening. When the time came to return to work, many of them were afraid of changes that could be imposed by the new government. Many more were shocked to see that the giant mural of Nightmare Moon above the front entrance had been stripped away, replaced with a much more sombre art piece depicting a full moon in a starlit night sky. Even the name on the building had been changed; now it read 'Steel Moonworks.'\n\nTheir old boss had assured them that all the changes were made purely to comply with the new laws, but the workers still had their doubts. How could a new government that has torn down everything they believed in possibly have their best interests in mind?\n\nAs the workers approached the front entrance, a few well-dressed ponies exited the building. The well-dressed ponies introduced themselves to the workers, saying that they were with the United Labour Front. Many of the workers were confused and had inquired as to what that was.\n\n"A union meant to ensure the well-being of every labourer in Chiropterra! One of Dusk Wane's recently implemented programs!" they had explained. The workers seemed hesitant to believe them, but nicer and safer working conditions did sound appealing. Many of the workers stopped briefly to inquire further, figuring that the promises they were making seemed too good to be true.\n\nBut as they began their workday, it soon became clear that the new working conditions were much, much better than they used to be. Fear and worry dissipated almost instantly amongst them. One worker gave a last look to a wall where some graffiti of Nightmare Moon used to be.

Her local temple had been almost completely demolished, and when the time came to rebuild it, she was shocked when the new government had declared that Nightmare Moon had twisted their faith over the ages into a monstrosity. They said that all temples needed to be reshaped or reformed to depict the "old faith" of the rising Moon holding dominion over the night sky.\n\nPond had felt conflicted about this then, but when she had stepped back to think about all of the horrible things that her faith had done to those who rejected Nightmare Moon she realized that she too had become prejudiced towards the nonbelievers.\n\nWhen she joined the volunteer efforts to rebuild the temple, both Pond and several of her old friends were surprised to see each other there. Pond had exclaimed that she had resolved to save the faith from its wrongdoings and to help bring the light of the Moon back to all who needed it.\n\nShe was brought out of her thoughts when a bell rang, signifying that the reconstruction workers, many of whom didn't even share her religion, were about to arrive for lunch. She hoped that at least this gesture of kindness could help atone for her own sins. Pond smiled at the hungry ponies as they entered the room."

tobuck_wallnut.39.d:0 "The legionnaires were no easy threat to tackle either during or after the war. Federal Police detachments have been stretched thin thanks in part to the very recent creation of the force but primarily as a result of the widespread legionary resistance following the conflict.\n\nIn spite of the great danger posed to the police and the public, they have done a remarkable job in containing the Chiropterran fanatics. Several informant arrests have been made and a number of raids have been entirely prevented thanks to the work of our brave constables on night patrol. Unfortunately, resistance remains a serious problem.\n\nFor now the army has taken on some of the more dangerous roles that would be typically left to the jurisdiction of the police, an unsurprising level of cooperation given the circumstances. Whilst Dusk Wane has voiced his intentions to fully hoof over civil duties to the police once the Legionnaires run out of steam for good, the destruction that these devoted elites cause begets a continued vigilance."

"So, you reckon that you've got 'em all?" He asked with a slight smirk, hooves clasped together as he leaned over the table.\n\n"Not all of them, sir; but certainly a lot. Their numbers, supplies and morale are at an all time low. They haven't much fight left in them." The pegasus shakily replied, either intimidated or simply still surprised.\n\nWalnut laughed and sat back in his chair, "You ain't on duty Brass, you can sound less 'official' than that!"\n\nActually, he was on duty; or at least he was supposed to be. Unfortunately one cannot simply say no to the Generalissimo, especially if he wants to take you somewhere to celebrate.\n\nHe would have found the irony irritating, if it weren't for how well-spirited the comment was. "As you say, Wallnut. And sure, I think we've got them."\n\n"Much better. Hey!"

tobuck_wallnut.41.d:0 "The full moon hung high over the sky, illuminating the outdoor stage that Dusk Wane stood upon. Despite the late hour, hundreds had gathered to hear what the Red Moonspeaker had to say. As Dusk approached the podium, he couldn't help but glance at the moon above him. He mulled over all that had transpired since he first became a Moonspeaker. The fall of his homeland and his newfound status in the country that had conquered it.\n\nDusk briefly closed his eyes. The time to put Chiropterra to rest had come.\n\nHe turned his attention to the crowd in front of him. "Brothers and sisters of New Ayacachtli, I have come to you this evening to tell you of the sins of the Legionary Council. They who practiced blind obedience to the Nightmare are the reason why Chiropterra lost so many lives in a pointless war. They who were so prideful that they failed to see how corrupted their faith had become over generations. They who thought of themselves as invincible to the end, and it was you all who paid the price for it.\n\n"The Legionary Council is no more. Scattered to the wind, much like the national pride many of you once felt. Some of you may still feel this way. Pride in Chiropterra, pride in the Nightmare; but that is not the way forward! Our Tobuckian brothers and sisters are offering us help in reforging this land into one our children can be proud of! We will not earn our salvation by merely praying for it, we must work for it! Join in labour with those around you and help bring this land out of the darkness of the Nightmare and into the light of the Old Moon!\n\n"That very light shines upon us now! The Old Moon has always watched over us. It has done so long before the Nightmare existed and it will do so after the last memory of the Nightmare fades away. It is eternal, much like its capacity for forgiveness. We must restore the old faith, the true faith. And if all of this is too much, then I only ask one thing of you...""

tobuck_wallnut.42.d:0 "A hoofball union, public facilities union, handypony union... He had been reading the most recently compiled list for some time already, but that was the point at which Dusk Wane decided that he had seen enough. The thestral's push for unions as a broader part of society and politics had worked, it seemed. New unions cropped up every day and very few of them seemed to be unsuccessful; in fact it seemed as though the boundaries between classes were slowly breaking down as more and more unique organisations developed around particular subjects that interested every strata of citizen.\n\nJust today he had been inspecting a proposal from the FAU - the Fine Art Union - which had petitioned to collect and present historical pieces from all across the federation in a new museum. The old pony smiled and sighed, deciding then that he would accept it when he was next in his office. After all, even socialist progress was always built upon a foundation of history; no matter what that history might be. If a union wished to preserve the artefacts of old, he could oblige such a request.\n\nNiftyn would probably have had the FAU shut down if he'd had the chance, much like many of the other unions that he considered 'pointless'; perhaps all of them would go eventually. It was truly a shame that they disagreed on so many of the finer details of socialism. Maybe once things were said and done they could sit and chat about why he was so enamoured with Steel Stallion, a question to which he would likely respond by asking why Dusk was so enamoured with religion."

Judging by the direction they were moving in, they were about to...\n\nHe grinned and hoisted up his son onto his back to help him see better. "A wondrous gift from the big city, my boy!"\n\nThe young colt furrowed his brow, "But what are they for?"\n\"That's a surprise! It'll be amazing, you'll see." Zagrum laughed heartily. "I'll let you know when it's time to see the surprise."\n\n---\n\nThe next day, after he was all done with his farmwork, Zagrum brought his son over to the town. They spent the rest of the afternoon watching the construction workers set up more of those wooden poles, along with some metal ones scattered around the town square. As the sun began to set, Zagrum's son asked if they could go home, as he was scared of the dark. Shaking his head, Zagrum watched one of the construction workers close a maintenance panel. He bore a huge smile and patted his son on the head.\n\n"Don't worry, soon you'll never have to be scared of the dark ever again."\n\nWith a flick of a switch, electrical lights blinked on all around them, piercing the approaching darkness and casting it out forevermore."

She admitted, trotting over to a zebra who hurriedly took the work off of her hooves.\n\nHe motioned vaguely in agreement and smirked. "I can't say I'm surprised."\n\nThey both took a few moments more to breathe and get their bearings, exhausted from the immense quantities of bureaucracy that they had to shift through. Hopefully things would calm down soon, though it didn't seem as though they'd get a break for a while.\n\n"Right, I should get these through."

They were lucky to have a lot of retired veterans who could teach the younger creatures in the division, of which there were a steadily increasing number. That was the main reason why Brittle Timber knew he was about to step down from command, because the young 'uns would vote for one of their own.\n\nIt wasn't even close. Some of the new stallions had voted for him and the vast majority of oldies had stuck with him - the quality of hoofwriting was indicative of their age, even if they didn't give any names - but it wasn't nearly enough.\n\nHe sighed, cleared his throat and went to speak in front of everyone on a little wooden podium, "I'm sure this won't be much of a surprise to you, but we have a new commanding officer. Let's have a salute for Quick Shot!"\n\nWhilst the small crowd that had assembled in the park cheered, he could tell that his friends weren't particularly pleased. The zebra, a young stallion with less brains than his charm might let on, eagerly clambered up to the top of the podium.\n\n"Thank you, sir. Or... Well, I suppose I'm the 'sir' now aren't I? That's going to take a while to get used to. Hah! Well, I'd like to thank..."\n\nBrittle Timber rolled his eyes and scoffed as quietly as he could manage, then glanced around to see his friends doing something similar as the recruits eagerly listened to their new commander."

Yet as he sat alone in his recliner late past midnight, he couldn't quite pinpoint what was keeping him awake.\n\nHis thoughts turned to Niftyn. What a persistent fellow, he was... though Wallnut didn't quite understand exactly what kind of vision he was following. He'd been really active with all the fancy politicking lately, though. Wallnut just wished that he would explain what he actually wanted, it felt like Niftyn wasn't quite as friendly as he used to be.\n\nWallnut grinned, looking up in imagination. Nothing a pint of wine couldn't fix. He'd need to schedule some time with Niftyn to help him remember why Wallnut chose him to help run things! They'd be friends again in no time!\n\nAnd speaking of friends... Wallnut wasn't quite sure how to feel about Dusk Wane. Sure, he'd done a lot of great things around the Chiropterran region, but those blasted temples still stood. At least they weren't devoted to Nightmare Moon anymore. And he hadn't been called an apostate in almost a week!\n\nWallnut mulled over these thoughts for a bit, then came to the conclusion that overall, he was happy with how things were going. This place wasn't perfect, but then again, was anything truly perfect? Wallnut glanced downwards, his eyes resting on some imported Aquileian wine on the table.\n\nAnother grin. "Maybe.""

You want me to pick my poison?" Wallnut gave out, putting it into the simplest terms for himself.\n\nThe other thestral at the table nodded and went to explain further, "Exactly. They're an experiment of sorts; to see what works and what doesn't, what sort of infrastructure we need to have in place and whether the investments are worth the input cost." Realising that giving more detail would probably send their host to sleep, Dusk then got straight to the point. "As this is new technology, it should be used for civilian purposes. It is only fair that such state investments benefit the citizenry first and foremost, factories operated by the workers and for the workers."\n\nNiftyn went to scoff but instead coughed, taking a moment to clear his throat before speaking. "The workers will have nothing to call their own if we can't protect what we've already worked so hard to build! The new facilities should be dedicated to military production, unless you wish to see the federation fall behind its enemies and shatter in a time of true crisis!"\n\nHaving received such an energetic rebuttal, the red moonspeaker went to argue; but Wallnut raised a hoof to make a choice and quell them both before he had to listen to another shouting match over policy."

For now, the stallion set aside the documents he had been composing and took a moment to think.\n\nHe reached into one of many jacket pockets for a half-empty packet of cigarettes, but found his hoof grabbing at something else. The old marksist grinned, leaning forward and taking out his years-old pocket copy of the Social Justice Party Manifesto, tied tightly with string to an even smaller volume of Steel Stallion's memoirs. Both little books had been damaged and lovingly repaired over the years, just so he could keep them close should they ever be needed.\n\nAs the revolutionary flipped aimlessly through the pages, he couldn't help but think of Wallnut; or, more specifically, of what Wallnut was and wasn't. He and that thestral were close friends with a relationship forged in the blood and fire of battle, but they did not see eye-to-eye when it came to politics. In all fairness, the Generalissimo was at least consistent. It wasn't that he disliked communism, far from it, more that he detested any and all forms of state management. He liked making friends first and foremost, which was sadly not part of the plan that two great authors of his most prized possessions had laid out. A socialist utopia must be led, guided by a visionary under the founding principles of the revolution as they had laid out. Though Dusk Wane and his puppets might disagree, anything less was abject failure.\n\nThat was how he saw the future of the federation and of Zebrica. He would bring forth a red dawn just as they had intended it, creating a perfect world where decadence and rot currently festered.\n\nHe sighed and reached into his jacket once again."

Sure, he could get behind that; middle class ponies in Tobuck were relatively few and far between, but he wasn't the sort to keep his privilege all to himself. That didn't stop this Niftyn fellow from annoying him by making a fuss about class, of course.\n\nWhen his daughter had asked to go to one of their rallies, that was when the alarm bells started ringing in his head. Not just about her - there were a lot of unsavoury individuals at these events after all - but also about how effective the propaganda had clearly been in getting ponies to at least attend even if they didn't listen.\n\nEventually he agreed to take her, realising that explaining politics and the concept of an ideology was far too complex for a ten-year-old and that talking about the funny shouty stallion after the fact would be far easier.\n\nThe red flags, the pamphlets and the officials bustled amongst the crowd as some jumped up demagogue stood at the front. They were rambling on about tearing down 'the decadent rule of monarchy, despots and kleptocrats' and how the federation must become a 'bastion of communism'. It was difficult to hear, here at the back of the worryingly large crowd, but at least his little filly seemed to be having a good time.

tobuck_wallnut.50.d:0 "A police force simply wouldn't do. The chaos caused and the danger posed by the remaining legionnaires necessitated a thorough and brutal response, not a prison sentence. Legionnaires did not deserve any mercy, nor the respect or dignity of a cell.\n\nHowever, it would also be inefficient to divert the military away from more formal operations in such a time as this. In a similar vein, a police force was needed to deal with less pressing concerns than domestic terrorism. To this, Niftyn proposed a very simple solution.\n\nAt the behest of the Generalissimo, the Internal Security Service has been formalised with the express intent to be used primarily as an anti-terrorist security force with the jurisdiction above that of the police and the firepower of the military. They are sworn to serve Wallnut first and foremost, but typically act on the orders of Niftyn simply so that the thestral can remain distant from bureaucracy.\n\nThough some within the government question the morality and rationality of such an extrajudicial force, none can deny the immediate effect that the ISS has had on Chiropterran resistance. There is much work left to do, but the decline in frequency and effectiveness of legionnaire attacks is proof enough that their efforts are not going to waste."

All the new technology was here too, toasters and a small but presumably functional radio being the main attractions among other bits and pieces. Living in the city would be a massive departure from what his family were used to in the plantations, but it suited them.\n\nIt was affordable because of the fixed prices and rent - courtesy of Niftyn - with hundreds moving in every day to new homes just like this one, into the pristine admittedly bleak but cheap and functional housing. It was really something, and it was far less expensive than a new place in the country where all they would do was more farm work.\n\nScarlet Penny, his wife, piped up from across the room; buried in school pamphlets.

What is the end goal of the federation? Where is our great state leading us, more specifically than victory and progress? Where shall the borders be drawn?" Niftyn poised, rhetorically of course.

Parades were largely state affairs, but all he had to do was smile and wave to his adoring fans; what could be better than that?\n\nAs the thestral rode in a personalised tank, Niftyn was preparing an address to go out to newspapers and across radio stations throughout the federation. It was to be an announcement, and a very good one at that. Though he clearly didn't know it - or at least liked not to talk about it - the Generalissimo was little more than a military commander, in spite of his popularity.\n\nToday he would be declared 'Steel Generalissimo' by him and the Hazrumenian Communist Party as a whole, a title which he would obviously accept. Whilst he revelled in the immediate adoration from the public, his compliance in the bestowing of such a title would make him essentially a puppet of the party and of Niftyn. Wallnut would notice little difference of course, all politics was the same to him so long as he could make friends and have a good time; that was something that nopony planned to change.\n\nWhat was soon to disappear was Dusk Wane's political influence. More and more creatures flocked to the HCP every day and with this affirmation from their much-adored dictator any political resistance would rapidly evaporate.\n\nThe stallion wished he could have the privilege of seeing old Dusky's face when he got the news."

Not just brawl in a bar or a scuffle in the streets, but a war against the oppressors that to which ULNZ was so staunchly opposed. A mix of propaganda, internationalism and genuine revolutionary fervour had set in across the nation, just waiting for an outlet.\n\nFactories were producing war materiel at an unprecedented rate, swathes of volunteers signed up to the army and many more brave creatures found themselves eagerly applying to militia groups. An unwise onlooker might have called it 'nationalistic' fervour, but it was no such thing. The federation was swept up by ideological revanchism, a kind of commitment to principles and an ideal that could seldom be found in other decadent nation states.\n\nMonarchies, frail republics and all countries that harboured capitalism knew that their time would soon come; that their own workers and socialists abroad would soon tear down the institutions they held dear. No more would the proletariat slave away beneath the boot of their oppressors, no more would they fear for their lives and their homes; all would stand and fight.\n\nWallnut's speeches, the rallies and the marches all passed on the same message.

Copper Spark had approved and attended several summary executions this week already in accordance with the new laws on the punishment of deserters.\n\nHe sighed and stamped a large red 'APPROVED' onto the paper before reaching over to put it in his outgoing documents pile that was steadily growing. The methods were a little harsh perhaps, but the effect of their implementation was staggering. After several inspections, it seemed to him that discipline and in particular the dedication of the soldiers had never been better; easily justifying the comparatively small cost in lives.\n\nThe paperwork seemed likewise daunting at times for the commissar-colonel, but it was simply part of the job now. If enforcing state complete state control over the militias was a job that he had been unprepared for then he would never have taken it in the first place. Organising it was tough certainly, especially given that some units had even held inter-militia elections, but he was up to the task. It seemed his subordinates - not least whoever it was that had sent the death warrant - were similarly dedicated.\n\nAfter a few more bits and pieces, he kicked up his hooves for a short break.

Whilst initially his interest was spurred by the fact that one of his long-time friends was leading the group, watching their progress under his 'guidance' had become somewhat of a habit or even a hobby.\n\nWallnut couldn't hold back a smile at the fact that he was a figurehead for a glorious communist revolution, whatever it was that such entailed. The last time the old stallion had tried to explain it to him the whole conversation had admittedly gone somewhat over his head, partially because of all the terminology he didn't understand but mostly for his lack of interest. Perhaps it was time he finally learned about what a 'socialist utopia' actually was.\n\nA loud knock on the door interrupted his thoughts, "Generalissimo, your car has arrived; it's for your three-o-clock."\n\nThe world waited for nopony.\n\n"Cheers m'dears," He said simply, sitting up and putting on his coat.

It was impressive in some respects that their factions within the government seemingly retained complete parity; in fact, it was very much like a two-party democracy in that respect.

He was quiet for the most part, save for when he tried and failed to answer pointed questions about his family and whether he worshipped the Nightmare or not. Oddly enough, when their new teacher overheard the latter question on one occasion she broke things up entirely which she found very suspicious. Was he a spy? Was the teacher a spy too?\n\nNeedless to say the colt - Saleet was apparently his name - wasn't having a good time. Even Honey occasionally dropped comments behind his back despite her typically kind-hearted nature. He was an easy target, especially with how different their lessons had suddenly become. Before they'd hardly even heard of socialism and now it was in everything from maths to literature, it was the simplest thing to pin all their concerns on somepony that was different.\n\nAt the very least their collective fear of the outsider made study relatively easy and kept them engaged with the lessons. The earth pony struggled a lot in class and had seemingly only just learnt to read, but he always came back for more. Every day his lexicon improved, and every day Honey Dew respected his resolve a little more."

tobuck_wallnut.79.d:0 "One lunch as Saleet sat on a bench in the playground with his lunch and one of the books they had been looking at in class, a thestral gingerly approached him. He averted his eyes after seeing her at first, keen to stay well away from the groups of local colts and fillies that liked to ask him difficult questions; but she was alone. That was unusual enough for him to tentatively smile and put down the novel.\n\nShe smiled back and stopped in front of him, "It's Saleet, right? Mind if I sit next to you?"\n\n"Uhm... Y-yeah, and no not at all." He responded timidly, "You're... Honey Dew?"\n\n"Sure am!"\n\nHis speech had drastically improved since first she had heard him talk, which was some months ago now. Actually she kind of regretted not talking to the poor earth pony before, given that he seemed to not have made any friends. The new teachers hadn't been able to help much.\n\n"Are you uhm... Gonna ask me something?" Saleet then enquired, fearing the worst.\n\nShe scrunched her face for a moment, before settling on honesty. "Well yes, but not like that. Not like they do. You seem nice and I wanted to talk to you, ask you how you're doing."\n\n"Oh, that's... That's new. Well I could be better, I-I think. Reading is hard with the wind." He returned, making a little nervous laugh.\n\n"I get it. We can go to the library if you like; it's quiet there too, sometimes I read there when I don't feel like talking much."\n\nHe thought for a moment before beaming and repacking his lunch box, "I... I'd like that.""

tobuck_wallnut.80.d:0 ""I'm... Sorry to bother you so suddenly sir, but this is rather urgent."\n\nWallnut looked up at her and couldn't help but laugh. There were certainly better times for a secretary to walk in on a stallion with paper in hoof than when they'd only just come out of the shower with a bathrobe on, but he was at least wearing said bathrobe having just sat down on a messy bedspread to read it. In his hooves he held an official diplomatic telegram from the hippogriffs, signed off by one Posada. He'd heard some things about her; about how she was apparently a pretty unique socialist, though he hadn't the slightest idea why. All he knew for sure was that her note made for a rather interesting read.\n\n"You're just doin' ya job. Can't fault ya fer that." He returned, mulling over the piece of paper after reading it a second time.\n\nSoft Blot stood silently for a moment before awkwardly raising a hoof, "If I may sir, uhm... What does it say? Nopony else has read it yet." \n\nAt that he raised an eyebrow, having momentarily forgotten his executive importance. "Oh, it's a counter offer; y'know, for Zumidia. Communists ain't much interested in money, how about that." the Generalissimo added with a slight chuckle. "They wanna have us in an alliance in return for us gettin' the territory, or a war I guess."\n\n"Ah." Was all she could say, holding back a laugh. "So you're... Going to decide on a course of action, dressed in only a towel?"\n\n"Well, yeah. I don't see why not," He retorted, glancing at her with a friendly grin.\n\nAt that it was her turn to laugh, despite the importance of the subject matter. Wallnut Drive truly could make anyone feel at ease, no matter the situation or circumstances. Eventually, having made sure the bathrobe was firmly around his waist, the stallion stood with his mind made up."

Those that compete for control in Zumidia after dealing with the hippogriff threat actively dissuade us from finding a peaceful solution and must be treated accordingly.

It reads as follows:\n\n'To all those it may concern within the administration,\n\nWith the liberation of Zumidia, [TBK.GetNameDef] has achieved its strategic and ideological objectives. Further conflict between our nations and peoples will needlessly create further destruction for both parties, exasperating existing issues and tensions.\n\nTo that end, our administration has seen it fit to propose an offer for peace. The offer is simple; cede the territory of Zumidia in its entirety along with national assets in the region to [TBK.GetNameDef].

The ponies that worked for him were communists, he had authority where it was necessary; everything was still in order. Once all formal bases had been covered, it hadn't taken long for the leaders to make their way to somewhere more private with several bottles of wine.\n\n"Sho.. Yer shayin 'at...

And 'at shtuff?"\n\nIt would surprise nobody to learn that they had both become incredibly drunk over an hour or so of conversation. The Generalissimo had obviously learned little of the finer points of Posada's unique take on socialism, but he was enthralled by the possibility of making space friends.\n\n"Yeah! Naw, well uh we'd... Ashume that; wou'nt we? Who doeshn't enjoy a good... A good party with friensh and... and comrades, right?" She returned, repeating herself between hiccups and thankfully more comprehensible words.\n\nWallnut then spent the next thirty seconds nodding and swaying slowly back and forth, thoroughly convinced by her words in spite of his general state of intoxication. If it weren't for the fact that he likely wouldn't remember most of this conversation he might even have tried to talk to his friends at home about these 'space aliens' when he returned.\n\nHaving spectacularly failed to pour another glass of wine, the thestral leaned over the table with a warm if utterly messy grin.

There was a time and a place for discussing socialist theory, and it was whenever the people you were talking to didn't bore you out of your mind; something that both of those old ponies were unfortunately very good at doing.\n\nBarely containing his glee, Wallnut Drive was just about managing to finish a far more interesting story. "...and y'know, they found me inna wine cellar after the party! I was fully in one of them barrels!"\n\n"What, like you emptied the barrel and got inside somehow?" She asked, amazed that the foundations of his federation were apparently built by whoever happened to help the Generalissimo clean up after a celebration.\n\nHe almost doubled over from resisting his mirth, needing to brace himself on the balcony. "That's the best bit! I ain't ever remembered!"\n\nAt that they both burst out laughing, filling the evening air with noise as they stood outside, leaning on a high-up railing. It took both leaders a little while to calm down, catching their breath and collecting their thoughts. There was however one nagging question that came to mind for Posada, having seen how serious all of Wallnut's comrades apparently were.\n\nShe tentatively looked over the edge of the balcony for a moment, "I hope this isn't mean but... it seems kinda lonely here; for you I mean. You're... kind of a lynchpin for those two more than a friend. D'you... Have anyone? Some closer friends?"\n\nHe let out a slight chuckle, "I'm workin' on both.

Unfortunately for [HIP.GetLeader] - the leader of [HIP.GetNameDef] - the federation nevertheless had designs on all parts of Hazrumenia, including the bits currently controlled by [HIP.GetName].\n\nThe outcome of whatever was to come was obvious, but the method to achieve the region's full integration into the federation proper was less clear. Some wanted war to depose the false communists, some proposed a stern and clear threat to assert federal sovereignty whilst others were adamant that a diplomatic solution was still possible. Politicians and people alike had their own ideas, but in the end it was the executive's job to decide how to approach these political newcomers; in the end it was all up to Wallnut. Were they friend, or foe?\n\nHis secretary nervously shifted on her seat, having asked the question that everyone wanted to know the answer to. "Apologies generalissimo, making this choice must be difficult."\n\nHe smiled and put a hoof to his chin, realising that this decision could decide the fate of the federation and of all the north of the continent.

tobuck_baragzen.1.d:0 "We do not control the only mercenary force in Tobuck. Alesia and Wallnut could become potentially dangerous enemies, if one is not set against the other. Both may have their political leanings forgiven, if they choose to cooperate and swear loyalty.\n\nThe former warlord is dedicated and honourable, renowned for the loyalty and incredible discipline of her troops despite the typically antiquated tactics that they utilise. The latter is young and reckless, a revolutionary at the whim of the ideologues that surround him and notoriously difficult to capture or pin down. We must select one or the other, lest we beget the wrath of both at once."
tobuck_baragzen.1.a:0 "Wallnut makes a useful tool."
tobuck_baragzen.1.b:0 "Alesia has some brains to her."

tobuck_baragzen.2.t:0 "Who Is Worthy?"
tobuck_baragzen.2.d:0 "Of all things that he might have anticipated interrupting his morning routine, Baragzen had not expected a small all-pony group of enlisted stallions trying to seek an audience with him in his own home. They sauntered down the country lane as the zebra nibbled on a particularly expensive flower with a scowl, desiring nothing more than to turn them away.\n\nYet, for fear of his reputation and the sanctity of his manor, the lord came to his door as they approached it. Needless to say, his uninvited guests were quite surprised to see him open up just as they went to knock.\n\nHalf of them bowed and the other half saluted on instinct whilst one amongst them went to speak "Apologies for the early interruption sir - Spring Breeze at your service. Do you have a minute?"\n\n"I'm listening." He grunted simply, taking a sip from some brew that they couldn't identify.\n\nThe only unicorn amongst the group stepped forward and unloaded his saddlebag, revealing a small heap of documents. Baragzen raised an eyebrow at this, but understood quickly once he saw the familiar stamp of the royal guard recruitment office. They had all had their applications for the Oath Wardens rejected, for the simple fact that they were ponies and not zebras which were the only race that was currently allowed to earn such a position of prestige. After all, the legends never mentioned anything about ponies.\n\nSpring went to actually explain their issue, but the zebra raised a hoof to indicate that it wasn't necessary. He understood perfectly.\n\nIt would be an affront to the very myths that birthed the royal guard to allow ponies into their ranks, but then the limitations certainly weren't practical given the majority pony population of Tobuck. After he made a very vague but convincing promise to the group and returned inside, Baragzen spent much of the day considering the future of his most prized soldiery."
tobuck_baragzen.2.a:0 "We need more hooves, it makes sense to welcome the ponies."
tobuck_baragzen.2.b:0 "Traditions are sacred, we must continue the zebra preference."

tobuck_baragzen.3.t:0 "The Last Gunrunner"
tobuck_baragzen.3.d:0 "Vasile sat on the open patio carefully hidden within a little square created by the walls of his home, himself nestled comfortably in a deck chair under the sun. This wasn't his typical way to spend the latter part of a work day, but circumstances had compelled him to cancel some items on his afternoon schedule. A short break was absolutely in order. Just two hours ago he had been informed of an offer from Baragzen by his secretary, one that was not made with the underlying threat of being arrested for business malpractice.\n\nThe result of that offer was that he was now Mayor of Tobuck. Well they hadn't called it that or even given the position a name as of yet, but 'Mayor' was a good way of summarising his new responsibilities and powers of economic management.\n\nWith all that was going on - the regional political troubles in particular were very concerning - Vasile was seriously considering leaving altogether, which was still very much on the table. Just because he had accepted premiership over a region with the intent to make as much money as physically possible alongside his associates didn't necessarily mean he had no other options. If Chiropterra or Zarantia came a-knocking he still had an exit strategy; but playing along would be prudent, at least for now.\n\nAll in all this Baragzen fellow was turning out to be quite the helpful zebra, not least because he seemed to be entirely unaware of Vasile's various economic misdemeanours. If anything this might eventually prove to be one of the most profitable endeavours of his career thus far, particularly if the exiled lord continued to claw over economic responsibilities to his subordinates with little to no imposed oversight.\n\nHe would have to arrange some sort of party for him and his new employer, one at which he could invite and introduce guests. After all, even the worst creatures in the world need to put on a pleasant face from time to time if they want to get anywhere."
tobuck_baragzen.3.a:0 "Quite the arrangement, if it sticks."

tobuck_baragzen.4.t:0 "His Ancient Legacy"
tobuck_baragzen.4.d:0 "It was, in essence, a little tea party of sorts; not all too dissimilar from the sort of thing that one might observe a little zebra arranging in a doll house were they rich enough to own one. In fact, a foal's imagination would probably be a more reasonable explanation for the domesticated leopard currently lounging at Baragzen's hooves.\n\nHis explanation was simple, though the decision as a whole was strange nonetheless. "...and of course, what better pet to cherish than one that shares the family name? Isn't she ever-so sweet..." He gave out, half in jest and half in earnest.\n\nThe lord took a piece of cured fish from the table and fed it to the surprisingly docile creature as his guests looked on with a combination of awe and confusion. So far he hadn't displayed much in the way of eccentricity or self-indulgence and this was a little of both.\n\nYarikh and several others took quite kindly to the beast all the same, occasionally forking over some morsels for her whenever they went to fill up their plates at the table of various dinner party treats. Baragzen also made sure to have plenty himself of course; he was quite content to sit, eat and talk with his rather large attending party.\n\nIndeed it was a wholly pleasant affair with the lord receiving plenty of praise for his exploits which he accepted graciously. Every attendee treated him with the utmost respect - almost as though he were already royalty - and he very much enjoyed the proceedings.\n\nAt a point of particular ease he even joked, "Too many of these parties and I might lose myself in them!""

Just minutes ago he had been informed that the front page of their tabloid was going to be horribly incorrect; which had resulted in him getting out of bed and rushing down to their offices along with some of his night-owl employees who had been awake when he tried their doors. The pony he'd assigned to reporting on the conflict had been doing such a great job so far, but neither of them had anticipated that the soldiers would simply retreat and return home after such a hard-fought war.\n\nHe'd have to call the printer operators and have them stop immediately at least, but then what would he replace the pages with?\n\nAnother of his employees burst into the room, gripping a pencil with a near-mad look in her tired eyes. "I have it sir! We've got something to put on the cover!" She blurted, dashing over to his desk and laying out some scrawled plans.\n\n"Thank goodness," He returned, sighing in relief and scouring the sheets he had been presented with. "What have you got for me?"\n\nBlunt Lead realised he probably couldn't read half of it and began to explain, "We tried to focus on how our troops are bringing vast amounts of wealth back to Tobuck rather than spend too much time on the treaty itself, you know what they'll do if we make it too negative."\n\n"Good, good. That's good. I'll send it off to print." The stallion gave out, stuffing the documents into a briefcase which he would soon run down to their warehouses.\n\n"Wait, wait! We didn't decide on a headline; here, choose between these on the way over!"\n\nShe frantically scribbled a note which he took between his teeth as he galloped out of his office, only getting a chance to look at the options once he was down three flights of stairs."

Not only has Tobuck, in spite of the state's lacking resources and stability, successfully annihilated the comparatively existential threat that is Chiropterra; but they have done it under the leadership of an old enemy.\n\nEven during his stint in the court he was considered a reactionary and spiteful noble, one that was expelled from Warzena years ago for a very good reason. Now he wields the might of a mercenary army turned professional force and slowly centralises power with the support of other prominent exiles in Tobuck. Rumour has it that he has already made contact with conservative elements within the government whilst public perception has gradually shifted away from passive mirth at a madmare in the papers to considering his return a real possibility.\n\nMore worrying still is that he has a claim to the throne of Warzena as head of the ancient Leopard dynasty, making his inevitable future conquests and choices all too clear. Some amongst the administration have, with a little encouragement from his recent success, started quietly debating the validity of that very claim."

tobuck_baragzen.7.d:0 "Each of Baragzen's three guests eyed each other at regular intervals as they took a slow trot through a pleasantly secluded area of his mansion's extensive garden. Yarikh, Tanis and Jetzabel had no innate reason to distrust one another but, disparate as they were, they had little cause to welcome each other. That was his part of the proposed bargain, uniting whatever was left of the nobility that might stand to oppose the weakling king. So long as he remained calm and collected, they would no doubt cooperate; at least for the foreseeable future.\n\nThey emerged from the grounds and into a small seating area with a semi-circular bench, at which each zebra took seats for the host to speak. "Now, I need not repeat the terms of our arrangement; indeed your very presence here indicates that you have, however tentatively, already accepted my offer. Nevertheless, as I am currently a mere gentlecolt rather than a king, I saw fit to invite you to my home to discuss matters in a more intimate fashion."\n\nThis clearly eased the group somewhat who were pleased to hear that he was earnest and far from a fool despite his aloof demeanour.\n\nYarikh spoke first, the fellow exile was no doubt eager to reclaim what he had lost. "So long as my old holdings are returned and the security of my family and position can be ensured... Well, this bargain is more than agreeable."\n\n"In addition to maintaining our current claims to land and property of course," Jetzabel quickly added, keen to gain as much as was possible under the circumstances.\n\nBaragzen then turned to look then at Tanis, who seemed to be deep in thought. She was likely considering her potential role in the reinvigoration of their traditional faith, a project she had desired to embark on for many years.\n\n"I apologise for my slow contemplations, but this is a potentially very dangerous decision." She explained, receiving an understanding nod from Baragzen and causing the other two guests to glance at one another. "I am, however, very interested; perhaps I need not be so concerned."\n\nAt that their host smiled and clasped his hooves together in barely-hidden glee,"

tobuck_baragzen.8.d:0 "A griffon in Tobuck was typically an unusual sight, but there was one that everypony had begun to recognise in the bustling city. Vasile's charisma and commitments to various projects within the city had garnered him a lot of attention, which was precisely the reason Baragzen had decided this time to pay him a visit rather than send a communiqué.\n\nSitting calmly in the back of his personal limousine, the zebra turned to speak. "Well, I can only say that my choice of administrator could not have been better made. You have done an excellent job thus far my friend, in fact I have a mind to reward you for your excellent service." He offered with an uncharacteristically genuine smile.\n\nAt this Vasile politely shook his head, "That's very kind of you my liege, but my service under the true king of Warzena is a gift in and of itself."\n\nThat was perhaps one of the greatest lies he had ever told as he was already considering just how much he could earn in expanding his policy of profiteering. Tobuck was prospering more than it ever had before and he was making sure to gain alongside it; insider trading, careful arrangements of tax breaks in growing industries that he had controlling shares in and an additional myriad of policies that most would consider 'corrupt' implemented all across the nation... The possibilities were truly immense, but it would do no good to come off to Baragzen as ambitious.\n\nHis humbleness had the desired effect as the zebra laughed haughtily, entirely unaware of how much was slipping away into the talons of his own statesgriff. "Surely you jest! I could not think of one more deserving of a promotion than yourself!"\n\nThe griffon simply chuckled and raised his claws in a mockery of begrudging acceptance as the lord seemingly had the spark of an idea,"

tobuck_baragzen.9.d:0 "Frankly it was impossible to decipher exactly what was going on. So many things had happened in such a short space of time that the loyal elements of the administration struggled to even identify the disloyal ones. On top of that rebellion itself seemed to be in a state of chaos, thriving all the more with assistance of what the king had to assume was an invasion.\n\nIt seemed that Baragzen had been a very intelligent stallion, ensuring that any conflict that erupted between himself and Warzena would be seen as less of a war and more of a civil conflict that extended into the borders of Tobuck thanks to logistical, military and national confusion. Even the armed forces seemed almost unsure of who they were supposed to be fighting and which generals were aligned with the establishment was anyzebra's guess.\n\nNeedless to say this has created a state of utter disarray and our allies are seemingly unwilling to act for fear that they may intervene on the wrong side or that they may spark further conflict between the feuding nobility. Contacting our allies and establishing a stable chain of command will take a long time; all we can do is hope that enough loyalty amongst the remnants of the army remains and hold out until help arrives."

tobuck_baragzen.10.t:0 "The Confusing War"
tobuck_baragzen.10.d:0 "The conflict didn't come as a complete surprise. Baragzen had been openly hostile to the ruler of his home country of Warzena for quite some time now and his rhetoric had only become louder once he asserted control over Tobuck. What had not been expected was the depth of instability that a potential invasion - if it could even be called that - would cause.\n\nWhilst the exile had indeed 'declared war' on Warzena by proclaiming himself as its rightful ruler, what has followed in recent days and through reports is more equivalent to an exceedingly messy civil conflict. At first intervention seemed the easiest and correct course of action, as it would be in assisting an ally in times of conflict, but the reality has developed entirely aside from our expectations.\n\nThanks in part to our lines of communication being cut and the general chaos that appears to be the norm for all facets of the Warzenan state, intervention has become a precarious proposition. We can only hope that the government survives long enough to reestablish contact."

In the past amnesty was occasionally and sparingly granted, typically in accordance with the personal biases of each reigning monarch. In that sense this decision would be no different, but in others it was certainly a departure from the norm.\n\nUnlike the weakling king who hadn't the heart to vanquish Baragzen and suffered the consequences, the true king would make no such mistakes. The entirety of the ruling opposition would be executed, effective immediately. Even his hoof shook a little as he signed their death warrants; it was never a simple thing to order the death of another when they were defenceless, but it was ultimately necessary.\n\nWhen it came to the soldiers and the generals who had played little part in the fighting as well as those that had defected, the lord was kind. Soldiers fight because it is their job and their loyalty was necessary in order to secure his power. In addition, civil servants and other common folk were spared the wrath of the vengeful exile; he needed their approval as much as the usurper needed their compliance, there was no need to punish them.\n\nIn the capital of Warzena zebras were slowly going back to their normal lives, anticipating Baragzen's arrival and his inevitable coronation. Already the nobles that had sided with him were making preparations and cleaning damage from the streets, making due arrangements for the long-denied dynasty's return.

Some elements of it were revived rites from ancient times whilst others were entirely new; indeed Baragzen had miraculously acquired an entirely new set of exuberant royal artefacts and luxurious clothes for use during the ceremony so that he need not touch the corrupted crown of the weakling king.\n\nNow was the part for which he had truly needed to prepare. The new king of Warzena carefully walked up the beautifully carved staircase to a balcony upon which he would speak to his innumerable followers. A number of microphones and speakers had been erected for the sake of the enormous crowd of commoners and soldiers alike that had gathered to receive him. Some were excited, others anxious and all were wondering just how this new king was going to rule. They were in for quite a surprise.\n\nAfter waiting for the applause to die down, even encouraging his hosts to stop with hoof gestures and a warm smile, Baragzen went to speak. "My loyal subjects, it is a great honour for me and the Leopard dynasty to finally return to this great state. For too long you have languished under a weak monarch, one that brought you and the rest of our once prosperous nation no less than utter stagnation and complete subservience to foreign powers. No more! I say no more! We have triumphed over the existential threat of Chiropterra! We have triumphed over weakness and decay and we triumph over all challenges that face us!" He declared, stopping only to catch his breath and observe the varied reactions of the crowd.\n\n"In an era of foreign imperialism and instability, we shall prosper; but it is not enough to only prosper in the face of greater foes. If we wish to survive and to revive our long lost legacies, we must compete with our enemies! We must fight and we must win! The hippogriffs and Colthaginians will fear the might of Zamal-Baragzen, king of Warzena and lord of the Neo-Hazrumenian Empire!""
tobuck_baragzen.13.a:0 "The applause that followed was deafening."

tobuck_baragzen.14.t:0 "The Zamal's Decadence"
tobuck_baragzen.14.d:0 "Service to the Zamal as his preferred servant had become progressively more difficult over the last few months, if not for His Majesty's steadily worsening demeanour then for his rapidly growing appetite. This was the third plate of food that Rihab had been asked to fetch just this lunch, and Baragzen was having a feast with no guests! Just for the fun of it.\n\nShe sighed and balanced the immense platter of various foods on her back, making liberal use of the waiting straps she'd been provided for porting heavy loads. Though she would never say so out loud, the Zamal was becoming... heavyset; if she was being kind about it.\n\nAnother zebra was about to saunter past, but then stopped and raised an eyebrow. "Is His Majesty hosting another feast so soon?"\n\n"With no guests, this time." She returned with a slight scoff, grunting and beginning to trot. "And I'm just about to deliver the next course."\n\n"By the Divines... Well, I have a message to deliver for Baragzen; if you don't mind the company." The zebra replied, nearly aghast at the revelation.\n\nWith a slight smile, Rihab acquiesced. "Sure. What's on the docket for the Zamal today? Doesn't seem serious, if your general attitude is anything to go by."\n\nAt that he put a hoof to his snout and thought about whether he should tell the waitress, before realising that doing so would cause no real harm. After all, these were closed doors and they worked together. He looked for a moment at the enormous plate upon his colleague's back and couldn't help but chuckle, given the nature of his information.\n\n"Well actually it's two things. The first is that rumours have begun to spread about His Majesty's... self-indulgence, shall we say, and that something will need to be done about it for the sake of his reputation. The other... Well, what do you think all the top brass are worried about?" He asked, barely about to contain his mirth.\n\nShe knew the answer very well, given her occupation. "Beyond their own vaults, I assume his health? Avoiding a power struggle with his early demise and all that?"\n\nThe stallion nodded and they both grinned."
tobuck_baragzen.14.a:0 "The rumours wouldn't stop any time soon."

tobuck_baragzen.15.t:0 "A Noble's Family"
tobuck_baragzen.15.d:0 "Another day in Zimash was just another day in paradise for Achraf, lounging around and enjoying his own riches. Back during the reign of the weakling king, much of his land had been stripped away from him and whatever was left had been taxed to the point at which it nearly bankrupted him. Baragzen had changed all of that for him, and many other nobles like him.\n\nWhat was once a floundering farming estate had been restored into a newly flourishing plantation, with all his old land returned thanks to a few connections in the court. His frugality learned in those difficult years had gone nowhere and now, with a few benefits from the top, he was earning more for his family than he had ever made in his life.\n\nJust as he was about to go on a walk around his estate, a little zebra came bounding up to the old noble. "Gramps! Can I come with you?!"\n\nThe little filly bounded up to her grandpa with a beaming smile, who shortly spotted his son waving from across the way and attempting to catch up. He wasn't out of shape, unlike some in His Majesty's new empire, but the energy of a foal is very difficult to match.\n\nAchraf chuckled, leaning over to give his grandfoal a nuzzle. "Well, I should think so. Let's see what your father has to say, once he catches his breath."\n\nThe filly giggled and he couldn't help but laugh a little as the stallion approached them both. "Hah... Hoooh... I apologise... father, I... I'm just a little... well, tired... We uh... walk?"\n\nBoth the eldest and the youngest zebras burst out laughing, a far cry from the eldest stallion's historically typical demeanour. Once she had simmered down, the little foal made a slow trot back to her dad and hugged one of his forehooves with a bright smile.\n\nAfter a brief 'awhh' escaped his snout, the old zebra grinned. "Well, let's get moving then shall we? Or do you need a minute, oh son of mine?"\n\nThe stallion managed a laugh,"
tobuck_baragzen.15.a:0 ""I'm sure I'll manage, pops.""

tobuck_baragzen.16.t:0 "In The Care Of The Gods"
tobuck_baragzen.16.d:0 "Trying to get the little ones to simmer down was always a massive pain in the flank for any teacher, experienced priest or otherwise. Foals were just difficult to manage and their parents were difficult to please, especially given that there were so few spaces and so many zebras trying desperately to get their colts and fillies into any given temple school. Luckily, there were some tricks that seemingly always worked.\n\nYosra sighed and cleared her throat, "Alright class, today we're going to be doing some more letter practice with the sand boards today!"\n\nAs she and her teaching assistant Malek - a priest in training who had kindly volunteered to help her with classes - hoofed out the many wooden trays full of sand, a chorus of high-pitched celebrations erupted from the little ones. They had fortunately had the foresight to do this activity outside in the temple gardens, but sand was still getting everywhere for the first half minute or so.\n\nMalek was already having to reluctantly tell off some of the foals for throwing half of the trays at one another, which fortunately persuaded the rest of them to behave. "Come on now you two, if you don't keep the sand then you're going to be left out for the rest of the afternoon. Are you going to stop fighting or are you going to continue ruining your clothes?"\n\nSoon enough the colts and fillies were hard at work, drawing letters and occasionally full words in the boxes of sand they had all been given. Every now and then Yosra would grimace, or chuckle depending on the nature of the error she had found, and shake the sand flat with a hoof and ask the suddenly distraught foal to try again. Her assistant couldn't handle the looks of anguish on their faces when he erased their hard work and so he was temporarily leading the class with instructions as his boss got down to the nitty-gritty."
tobuck_baragzen.16.a:0 "How either priest managed with a class of fifty was a mystery."

tobuck_baragzen.17.t:0 "The Trials Of Teaching"
tobuck_baragzen.17.d:0 "Yosra placed the drinks on the table and slumped in her chair, utterly exhausted from a long day of teaching. Malek, now a full-time priest and teacher in the temple school, chuckled and took his glass as his friend grunted and sighed. Thankfully this was long after school closing hours, but it didn't make her complete lack of energy any easier.\n\n"Still missing me in your classes?" He asked with a knowing smirk.\n\nBefore he could take another swig, the zebra across the table in front of him released a rather emphatic groan of what could only be described as utter suffering. "By Zanit YES! You know how I was telling you the other week they increased the size of my class? They did it again this morning! And not even by a few this time, they put another fifteen of the things in there with me!"\n\nBy his rough estimation, that meant that Yosra was handling about sixty foals at once; which was accurate if his last rummage for the new textbooks during her lessons was any indication. He was fortunate enough to have a teaching assistant of his own now, but that wasn't going to last forever. Soon enough he was going to be having the work piled high too, when he was considered a 'senior educator' or whatever term it was they were using now.\n\nThe zebra set down his drink, then leaned over with a serious expression. "You know you can ask to have the classes reduced, right? I mean sure, they need to get these little ones through temple school; but what they're making you do is obscene."\n\n"I know, I know..." She returned, waving a hoof vaguely in his direction. "But they're so... talented, y'know? I can't just let them all down and tell some of them to go someplace else when they have so much potential. Sure the really young fillies and colts are a little small for that sort of judgement, but you've seen the grades of the older ones right?"\n\nIt was true, the grades they were achieving were incredible and it was mostly her work even though she didn't like to admit it; but this sort of stress was not sustainable. "I get it; but we can split classes if it's that much of an issue, right? You don't have to tackle all of... this."\n\nYosra raised an eyebrow and then grinned at the vague gesture Malek had given her entire person,"
tobuck_baragzen.17.a:0 ""Alright mister! Stop looking at me like they're killing me!""

tobuck_baragzen.18.t:0 "A Sacrifice Most Grand"
tobuck_baragzen.18.d:0 "Zal is the god of the sun, the sky, the stars and the sea; but also a deity embodying the glory of combat and the strength of warriors. Zanit keeps the moon in the sky, the soil healthy below our hooves, life and death in balance and the wisdom of all creatures. They complement one another and balance each other's strengths, equally revered in our great nation's pantheon.\n\nSacrifices to one must be complimented afterward by a sacrifice to the other, if that balance is to be maintained by our worldly worship. Fortunately there are multiple boons that may be requested from each deity, given the breadth of their domain.\n\nSoon a grand sacrifice shall be held to the almighty beings that watch over Hazrumenia and the whole domain of the Zamal, but what blessing shall the temples seek to gain? What ordained power shall we be permitted to borrow in our holy worship of Zal and Zanit?"
tobuck_baragzen.18.a:0 "Zal shall grant us power in battle!"
tobuck_baragzen.18.b:0 "Zal will bestow our creatures with holy vigour!"
tobuck_baragzen.18.c:0 "Zanit may lead us to victory in war!"

tobuck_baragzen.19.t:0 "A Warden's Duties"
tobuck_baragzen.19.d:0 "To their credit, the welcome had been much more enjoyable than Ghada was expecting. Public Wardens were a welcome sight in the city given the crime rates there, but many in the countryside had been less-than-pleased to discover that their lives would now be policed. Considering some of the horror stories she had heard, a warm welcome and a few small gifts from the foals was something to celebrate in and of itself.\n\nUnfortunately, the zebra soon realised why the locals were so eager to have a little law and order in their midst for once.\n\n"By Zal I'll make you swallow your own spine for that!" A stallion yelled, breaking the splendid silence of the little village and alerting Ghada.\n\nBy the time she was out of her accommodation, the shouting and yelling had escalated from just two voices to two groups of viciously angry citizens. As her hooves hit the dirt in front of her bungalow, someone kicked first and then the entire scene descended into madness. The brawl before her continued to grow as other zebras joined in and began trying to help or hurt whoever they could, but the fight certainly wasn't stopping.\n\nAfter a few more moments of simply observing the Public Warden took her revolver, aimed it into the ground and fired a warning shot into the dirt.\n\nThe gaggle of pointlessly fighting creatures stopped fighting in an instant, clasping their hooves to their ears. "Well I can see why they sent me here... Right you lot, I don't want to be dealing with a bunch of grown stallions and mares fighting each other half to death over some petty insult! I have a reputation and you have your own working bodies to look after; so if I see anything like this happen again, I'm putting the worst offenders in a holding cell until they work things out with one another!"\n\nThe collection of creatures before her groaned, moaned and occasionally nodded; vaguely understanding that they needed to stop fighting as the ringing in their ears continued."
tobuck_baragzen.19.a:0 "How had they managed to survive this long without her?"

tobuck_baragzen.20.t:0 "A Noble's Blind Eye"
tobuck_baragzen.20.d:0 "Another long and boring day of sifting through bureaucratic documents, another day of going down to the farmer's market. Sure it meant having to suffer through the frankly ludicrous amount of propaganda that they'd been shunting into towns like his, but it wasn't as though Monem could go anywhere else that was close to his office for a snack after a long day of work.\n\nHaving purchased something that seemed to be vaguely appropriate for a noble of his status, the old zebra took a seat on a bench and sat to enjoy a bite to eat. Or at least, he would have if he wasn't interrupted by a group of colts running past him like maniacs; nearly knocking his dinner out of his hooves.\n\nFortunately he was far too tired to get truly annoyed by this, but it wasn't going to stop him having a go at them. "Hey! Watch yourselves, you're gonna get in trouble if you keep galloping around like that!"\n\nOf course most of them simply went on their merry way, with a couple smirking or giggling at the comparatively old zebra that would never have been able to keep up even if he'd tried. Monem simply shook his head, chuckled a little to himself and went about his food. After all, it wasn't as though those foals were his responsibility; they could get into as much trouble as they liked as long as it didn't involve him.\n\nOn the way home, the zebra happened across the group again as they tore through the streets in the other direction. He saw that they had some of the posters depicting a glorious Zamal Baragzen on them, obviously torn from the walls on which they had been stuck in some form or another. For a moment the noble considered reporting them to the authorities, as such was technically his duty within the noble circles of the land; but what was getting a bunch of little ones arrested going to do for the country?\n\nMonem simply smiled and pretended as though he hadn't seen a thing."
tobuck_baragzen.20.a:0 "After all, he probably would've done the same thing."

tobuck_baragzen.21.t:0 "An Unexpected Cushion"
tobuck_baragzen.21.d:0 "Thanks to his position as Zamal, His Majesty is still expected to receive diplomats despite his consistent objections to performing his own duties. Until recently many considered him relatively capable at least of maintaining cordial diplomatic overtures, but clearly this confidence was misplaced. Just this morning a hurriedly written telegram reached the administration, informing them of perhaps the worst diplomatic incident of the empire to date.\n\nBaragzen has - in what can only be assumed to be a state of utter distractedness - sat on the foal of a foreign dignitary during a formal meeting and hospitalised them with several fractures. After correspondence with the hospital, it seems that the little equine will be just fine; but the same cannot be said of His Majesty's reputation.\n\nGiven that the conference was being broadcasted, the entire nation has become aware of what the papers are describing as 'gross negligence' and the state radio stations are attempting to pass off as 'an honest mistake'. Not only that, but the dignitary in question is suing the state for what most are saying is a very reasonable sum of many millions. The Zamal will not be free of this scandal any time soon."
tobuck_baragzen.21.a:0 "He was merely tired!"

tobuck_baragzen.22.t:0 "Of Rubble And Trouble"
tobuck_baragzen.22.d:0 "As of late, our beloved Zamal has expressed great interest in opening a new venue for him and his fellow gambling nobles. Thankfully his capital is not at risk for once, if only because casinos are typically a worthwhile investment and he cannot lose money at an establishment he personally owns. Generally, he had assent for the idea; but in the past it had not gone much beyond the planning stage, as was typical of most of his ideas. Unfortunately, the lack of prior planning on this occasion was not a guarantor of a quiet week for the administration.\n\nInstead, reporters quickly became aware of the rapid disassembly of an entire apartment complex following an eviction without notice of all the building's residence. The explosives used to do so were luckily handled by the construction company that His Majesty had hired, but it is yet unknown as to whether all of the creatures that had been unlawfully removed from their residence had actually left the building before the detonation.\n\nTo the surprise of nobody, this has been an absolute PR disaster. Between the lack of concern for the lives of the citizenry in the detonation, the complete disregard for the law in His Majesty's work and the Zamal's subsequent nonchalant attitude towards the situation it seems like this scandal will mar his reputation for years to come. The state can only hope they don't find any corpses under the rubble."
tobuck_baragzen.22.a:0 "Another decisive use of executive power!"

tobuck_baragzen.23.t:0 "Battleship Blues"
tobuck_baragzen.23.d:0 "As of late a new attraction has been bringing the attention of the rich and noble of the realm to its reinforced bulkheads. His majesty, on good word from an unknown acquaintance, has purchased the largely empty hull of an outdated warship and has turned it into a diner for his friends in the court. It has been very popular at the top, but the story closer to the ground is - as usual - vastly different. A few of his subjects, realising that a gathering place for the nation's top brass, attempted to protest on the docks. They were subsequently beaten by the bouncers, who assumed that they were trying to intrude on their employers.\n\nThis event has obviously not gone down well with the public, who have since begun protesting en masse over the utterly senseless violence inflicted on their fellow equines. Our beloved Zamal has made absolutely sure to stay far away from the ongoing lawsuits as the company responsible for providing security was not under the jurisdiction of the royal monopolies, but his reputation has been severely tarnished by association with the event all the same."
tobuck_baragzen.23.a:0 "It is a display of the empire's immense wealth!"

tobuck_baragzen.24.t:0 "Mass Motorisation"
tobuck_baragzen.24.d:0 "Given his love of all things with engines it was to be expected that His Majesty would attempt to share this adoration with the public. During a royal tour he resolved to give a large number of automobiles to a small farming community who protested the idea out of politeness; but of course our beloved Zamal insisted. Just a few days ago the vehicles were delivered, to much jubilation from the residents who were excited to receive these cars and trucks even though they hadn't much of an idea of how to use them.\n\nHowever, far from being the success that Baragzen predicted the gift to be, it has turned into an utter embarrassment for both him and his administration. The rural backwater farmers had no way to refuel their exuberant presents which have since been turned into scrap and repurposed, much to the delight of the media who lapped up the opportunity for a front-page eye-catcher. The public has found the whole affair to be immensely frustrating, and it has served as a source of immense concern over the capabilities of His Majesty given the amount of money wasted."
tobuck_baragzen.24.a:0 "He has such a kind heart!"

tobuck_baragzen.25.t:0 "The Confectionary Parade"
tobuck_baragzen.25.d:0 "Our beloved Zamal and his love of all things sweet - with chocolate in particular claiming much of that love - has once again managed to cause a fuss. This week he held an entirely unannounced and very expensive parade, which he deliberately chose to hide from the public in the hopes that they would enjoy the surprise. The parade, a venture born of entirely generous intent, brought transport and general daily activity in the city to a complete halt.\n\nIn spite of the bountiful displays of sweets, chocolates and various exotic sugar-based treats the public has reacted poorly. Needless to say the media blew the event out of proportion and quickly the admittedly sizable inconvenience turned into a national embarrassment for His Majesty who was quite dejected with the reception. Though he may get over what he sees as a minor grievance, his subjects may not be quite so forgiving."
tobuck_baragzen.25.a:0 "But what a show it was!"

tobuck_baragzen.26.t:0 "No Need For A Ring"
tobuck_baragzen.26.d:0 "Despite his outward displeasure for many of the formalities he must endure, the Zamal is nevertheless responsible for overseeing discussions between the of the many sociopolitical institutions of his great empire. His Majesty can often be found trying to squeeze out any semblance of entertainment during such events, though typically he manages to engage in some capacity in spite of his personal preferences.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems that there are some lines that he has recently become willing to cross. During a meeting between the priesthood and the nobility, Baragzen reportedly became unreasonably inebriated and drunkenly proposed to a priestess of Zanit using language that has been described as everything from 'barbaric and shocking' to 'absurdly blunt in its vulgarity' by the various media outlets.\n\nFortunately she has rejected his proposal, much to the relief of the nobility; but that hasn't saved his reputation in the face of the public. It is possible that his image will recover from this scandal, but it seems likely that his personability - or the perceived lack thereof - will remain in the ire of the citizenry for quite some time."
tobuck_baragzen.26.a:0 "Such a passionate individual!"

tobuck_baragzen.27.t:0 "A 'Mystery' In Sand"
tobuck_baragzen.27.d:0 "Our beloved Zamal is well known for his love of hunting and it's something that the administration has always politely encouraged, not least because it actually gets him on his hooves every once in a while. In the past he has successfully captured or killed many a challenging beast, which has led to his well-founded self-confidence when it comes to the tracking and hunting of whatever esoteric monster his entourage may come across.\n\nBaragzen has always desired to successfully hunt a tatzlwurm, but most considered such a ludicrous goal to either be jest or something he would simply keep dreaming of. That was until recently, when a small desert village managed to report a story of His Majesty actually attempting such a death-defying stunt. Unfortunately, the Zamal's expedition was far from successful.\n\nIf the utter destruction of the aforementioned village wasn't telling enough, the stories told to reporters spoke of a wurm outraged by pain and a wealthy hunter that had failed to kill it. Fortunately the collection of huts was so remote that none of them had successfully identified the hunter as His Majesty, which has saved him from a considerably larger public backlash. Unfortunately, given his already suffering reputation, many have already begun to speculate on his possible involvement. Nothing is sacred, it seems."
tobuck_baragzen.27.a:0 "That beast sure put up a fight!"

tobuck_baragzen.28.t:0 "Royal Charity"
tobuck_baragzen.28.d:0 "Our beloved Zamal is most fond of a good suit, particularly for wearing on formal business occasions. He has therefore, with all his wisdom, decided to buy a single suit for every single one of his subjects for the sake of charity and kindness. Initially this news was met with confusion and a slightly surprised optimism, but reality set in rather quickly. As soon as his enormous orders went out to the various manufacturing companies, other consumer goods rapidly began to disappear from shelves.\n\nUnderstandably, the public is most displeased with their lack of basic items and the huge backup in the distribution industry. The least that has been said is that the idea was foolish and the worst that has been said was treacherous. His Majesty may need to lay low for a few months, given the incredible backlash for such an expensive and problematic endeavour."

tobuck_baragzen.29.t:0 "Two By Two"
tobuck_baragzen.29.d:0 "For reasons entirely unknown to both the administration and the nation, His Majesty has recently announced the creation of a new national zoo in which he has sought to place two of every single animal in the world; not including sapient species of course, although it is possible that such was initially on the agenda. To begin with the project attracted a lot of positive attention and excitement from His Majesty's citizenry, though that optimism quickly disappeared when the citizenry experienced it in far too first-hoof a fashion.\n\nWith such an unprepared workforce and a generally difficult project for which they had been given almost no time to prepare, it was almost inevitable that several of the more vicious carnivores would escape. A number of our beloved Zamal's subjects were attacked, but luckily on-scene police were quick enough to prevent any deaths. Unfortunately however, the royal image does not seem to have been spared from the aftermath of the incident and Baragzen has been criticised heavily for his foolhardiness."
tobuck_baragzen.29.a:0 "What a visionary our ruler is!"

tobuck_baragzen.30.t:0 "The Golden Guard"
tobuck_baragzen.30.d:0 "Though they are well renowned for being the best of the best, our beloved Zamal has lately made his dissatisfaction with the royal guard very well known. In an attempt to rectify this dissatisfaction, which seems to be mostly a grievance based upon their appearance, he has procured and enforced the use of a new kind of golden armour. Whilst it was theoretically less effective, the main issue was the weight of the kit which has caused several of the guards to collapse whilst on duty over the last few days.\n\nTheir families have expressed immense displeasure publicly as a result of His Majesty 'endangering' the lives of his loyal soldiers. To the surprise of absolutely nobody the media has lapped up these comments, leading up to an ongoing bout of slander from both the press and the public. It seems unlikely that this event will simply slip out of the minds of his subjects, given the response that has been observed by the administration."
tobuck_baragzen.30.a:0 "But the armour does look good!"

tobuck_baragzen.31.t:0 "The Royal Yacht"
tobuck_baragzen.31.d:0 "For some time it has been customary for the richest in society to purchase large and expensive personal ships and our beloved Zamal is no exception. For the past week or so he has been making extensive use of a new vessel, his yet-to-be-named personal yacht. That same boat ended its short-lived time in service earlier this morning in an incident involving Baragzen sailing it straight towards and onto a beach, running the incredibly expensive vessel aground and almost killing several of his subjects. Fortunately, few injuries and no deaths resulted from the incident.\n\nHowever there was plenty of damage done, if not for the Zamal's personal accounts then for his image. Witnesses reported to the media within minutes and the coverage of the nearly-catastrophic crash has been extensive. His 'flagrant disregard for the wellbeing of his subjects' has been widely written about and those that were injured have banded together in an attempt to sue His Majesty!"

tobuck_baragzen.32.t:0 "Beautifying The Staff"
tobuck_baragzen.32.d:0 "Just two days ago our beloved Zamal made the announcement that all but five of his palace staff were being fired with two weeks' notice. Needless to say, this news has shocked the nation which eagerly anticipated an explanation for the decision. He later revealed that, in his opinion, his staff should be as 'attractive and physically endearing' as he himself was. Those words, in addition to the nation then being scoured for those that Baragzen considered attractive with experience in the services industry, has been received very poorly.\n\nThe outrage expressed by his very large complement of household staff has been loud and, now that most of them are unemployed, they have begun spinning tales of incredible hedonism. Unsurprisingly, His Majesty's reputation has taken a sizable amount of damage from the events and subsequent rumours. But, as those in government very well know, the Zamal is not capable of such unabashed superficiality."

tobuck_baragzen.33.t:0 "The Zamal In Public Speaking"
tobuck_baragzen.33.d:0 "As of late our beloved Zamal has taken to speaking in front of crowds that occasionally gather at the front of the palace gates. Over the past few days he has spoken much of his exploits as a warlord and has spared no details over the gruesomeness of war and conflict. In fact, according to some witnesses, he seemed to take pride in his capacity to function in what can only be described as a state of utter bloodlust during the sensual overload of battle. Some publications have speculated this behaviour to be early signs of his currently rumoured hedonistic behaviour and witnesses have described the stories as 'perturbing' and 'disgusting'.\n\nNeedless to say, the news of discomfort caused by some of these speeches has been quite widespread and the media response to His Majesty's overly descriptive tales has been less-than-optimal. His subjects may struggle to see him in quite the same way that they once did for quite some time."
tobuck_baragzen.33.a:0 "What vigour he has!"

tobuck_baragzen.34.t:0 "His Majesty's Playhouse"
tobuck_baragzen.34.d:0 "In his infinite wisdom, Zamal Baragzen has decided to purchase himself a holiday home which - according to the journalists to whom he spoke at least - will serve as a future residence away from the palace in which he will raise his foals. In reality it will serve as a new home for the large number of exotic creatures that he has purchased largely from raider bands that occasionally visit our lands to sell. Guards in the new location have already observed him traipsing around with his new concubines, of which there are estimated to be between sixty and seventy.\n\nIf keeping such a number of creatures quiet wasn't challenging enough, paying for them and keeping them fed in a life of relative luxury will certainly put a strain on his accounts; not to mention the likelihood of his offspring cropping up eleven months after every visit. The papers too have speculated about the true purpose of the new manor and, following an incident in which the Zamal was spotted with his courtiers in the capital, have unfortunately been proven correct."
tobuck_baragzen.34.a:0 "What a place to raise a foal in!"

tobuck_baragzen.35.t:0 "Highs And Lows"
tobuck_baragzen.35.d:0 "Our beloved Zamal was running around the halls of the palace last night, an impressive feat considering his steadily increasing weight. At first the guards thought he might have been escaping an intruder given his unusual speed, but the reality turned out to be far less serious. When his energy finally ran low, he divulged to a guard that he had taken a sizable quantity of drugs in the hours prior. With the high turning into a crash, he collapsed into the hooves of three of his concubines who struggled to bring him to bed.\n\nA later search of the palace and of the stores revealed that he had imported an incredible amount of narcotics. We assume they originated from Colthage and the cartels there, most likely the Zurumilki Family or the Zaga Brothers, which means that they're going to be showing up more frequently over the coming months and most likely causing trouble. Needless to say that the public will not be pleased when drug-runners come a-knocking."

tobuck_baragzen.36.d:0 "It isn't often that His Majesty speaks to a hippogriff of significant importance, but his magnificent court does draw in the most curious of creatures. As of late, a hippogriff of noble birth has recently begun appearing more frequently in and around the court and the Zamal in particular; seeking mostly to make some economic arrangements in some form or another for the sake of their wallets first and foremost.\n\nWhilst Baragzen is of course a patient and deliberative monarch in every sense, many amongst the nobility are aware that he does not like to do things quickly. Unfortunately - and thanks in part to the relative newness of this particular noble - this is something that the hippogriff was reportedly much less aware of. They are, after all, typically rather straightforward creatures.\n\nThis has unfortunately resulted in an incident that has already been widely upon, where our beloved Zamal became so frustrated that he referred to the hippogriff by a particularly unsavoury nickname during a press conference. Needless to say that this event has reached far and wide across the country and, if the outspoken majority of Hazrumenian citizens weren't disapproving enough, the hippogriff minority certainly is. Baragzen will need to lay low for a while."

tobuck_baragzen.37.d:0 "A relatively recent food phenomenon that has recently entered Hazrumenian society is what the Chiropterrans affectionately call a 'Moonburger'. Being essentially a sandwich with a set of condiments, meats and additional toppings that can be made quickly and eaten really at any time, the Zamal has become somewhat private enthusiasts for this 'fast food'. Though some of his cooks were slightly irritated to be usurped by deep fryers, most were simply glad to have less work on their plates and more food on his.\n\nRecently however, His Majesty has expressed particular interest in the construction of a fully fledged Moonburger restaurant in his palace. Of course this request was granted, but wasn't entirely without resistance.\n\nOnce the public inevitably got wind of the construction - whether it be through the workers on site or one of the disgruntled chefs - the newspapers made a mess of the situation. Many are understandably furious that Baragzen has allowed for what they perceive as a widely despised Chiropterran influence to seep into his very home. We can only hope that the discontent dissipates in time, perhaps as they learn to enjoy these 'Moonburgers' themselves."

tobuck_baragzen.38.d:0 "After the implementation of the silence in Kiria, many kirin left the nation and sought to make lives for themselves across the continent or even further afield. One such individual had been making quite a name for themselves in His Majesty's court for some time now, making their way as a creature of good repute and profitable business amongst the nobles and the economic elite within the cities. They had even been able to attain an audience with the Zamal himself on multiple occasions, though said meetings weren't particularly successful.\n\nIn the latest of their considerable number of meetings however, Baragzen revealed that he had no intention of cooperation. According to media accounts, His Majesty went out of his way to provoke the poor kirin into their nirik state through insults and 'utter heartlessness' all for what they have described as 'morbid curiosity'. If it weren't for the guards present at the meeting, it's quite possible that His Majesty could have been seriously hurt as a result.\n\nFortunately he survived the nigh-on assault from the nirik and the creature has been placed under temporary surveillance for their behaviour; but the Zamal's reputation is far from unscathed. The citizenry will not soon forget his supposed disregard for the wellbeing of his subjects."

tobuck_baragzen.39.d:0 "Despite his lavish life, our beloved Zamal has often expressed a desire to live in the countryside. Not without the necessary amenities for comfortable royal living of course, but away from his palace in a rural area nevertheless. Needless to say, the majority of creatures within the administrative and noble circles of the empire had long considered this to be one of his more unlikely fantasies to fulfil given the immense amount of effort it would require for little real gain.\n\nHis Majesty is however very capable of making unlikely choices when it comes to decisions such as these. Over the past week or so, he has spent the majority of his time in a small rural village with an incredible entourage in an immense caravan. At first the residents were overjoyed to host the Zamal, as any citizen would be; but their opinion of Baragzen rapidly deteriorated after he began to ruin the land with the aftermath of his lavish parties.\n\nBy the time he had returned to his palace, the farming family in question had already started quite a fuss amongst the press. The story of His Majesty's terrible role as a guest has left a poor taste in the mouth of many, but at least the farmers can be quietly compensated and the outraged voices will soon quieten."

tobuck_baragzen.40.d:0 "His Majesty has long had a particular interest in the world of tailoring and, more specifically, of filling his wardrobes with whatever new and befitting clothes he can possibly find. As of late his... well-developed figure, to be polite, has become progressively more difficult to produce clothes for. Fortunately, with all the skill in the empire, Baragzen has thus far managed to requisition plenty enough clothes.\n\nUnfortunately, the royal tailor has recently encountered a snag. The Zamal's impressive frame has simply become too magnificent for the poor creature's work to keep up. By the time the garb was ready for use, the measurements he had originally been given were out of date. Baragzen, upon discovering that the zebra had 'deliberately' made the collection of fabric too small, immediately attempted to have him executed for treason just last night.\n\nFortunately no harm has come to the creature, but His Majesty's well-intentioned fears have spiralled out of control in the eye of the public. The citizenry will likely forget this incident soon enough, but it would perhaps be best to hire a new tailor before the administration has to deal with another discontented voice within the walls of the palace."

tobuck_baragzen.41.d:0 "Our beloved Zamal is well known for his many passions, ranging from indulging in the hard work of his subjects to the beauty of courtesans and there are many of the latter living in his palace. In general he has managed to keep track of them all, or more frequently leaves the management of their whereabouts to more capable creatures in the field of organisation. Indeed, the palace could be described almost as a temporary residence.\n\nHowever, for all his power and ability, His Majesty cannot be expected to remember every name and every snout that he comes across. Such is simply an impossibility, even for the most grand and intellectual creatures such as the Zamal. Unfortunately, this understandable flaw has developed into something more problematic as Baragzen accused one of his many couriers of being an imposter and an assassin.\n\nAfter a brief investigation, the charges against the well respected dragoness were dropped as she was in fact on His Majesty's payroll. Despite this, some rather rough treatment at the hooves of the Oath Wardens and the degrading comments supposedly thrown at her by our beloved Zamal, she has made a rather large fuss in the public eye. The administration can only hope that Baragzen's memory remains healthy in the years to come."

tobuck_baragzen.42.t:0 "Flaunting The Furs"
tobuck_baragzen.42.d:0 "A hunt for the Zamal is an opportunity for adventure and adrenaline, especially when it involves beasts that are particularly difficult to catch. Of course, he always ensures to bring the right tools and is never personally in danger, but from time to time his expeditions come across the most esoteric and incredible creatures. Creatures which, being hunted, are then shot and stuffed to adorn the walls of His Majesty's palace.\n\nUnfortunately the pursuit of such rare beasts has recently been picked up by conservationist groups of native Zarantians. This would not have been a problem, if it weren't for the fact that our beloved Zamal then proceeded to show off the corpses of three different endangered species to tell them that they could be put in a museum. An honest mistake on his part, but something that has clearly distressed the zebras in question.\n\nNeedless to say that this has sparked considerable press debate over the ethics of hunting as a whole, which has managed to save Baragzen from too much backlash over the event. It would still be best if he stayed out of the public eye for a little while however, just to make sure that nothing bad can possibly happen whilst popular tensions run high."

tobuck_baragzen.43.d:0 "Writing has never been one of His Majesty's strong suits, as he himself would have told you when he was a warlord. With that in mind, it reasonably surprised the nation and the administration when he published a novel out of the blue. Despite only providing what he describes as 'the building blocks' of a planned series of volumes, it has been reviewed rather poorly and one critic was brave enough to describe it as 'the ramblings of a madmare'.\n\nThe poor reception has only encouraged our beloved Zamal to distribute it himself and the subsequent chaos that erupted from him attempting to give every family a hardback copy of his book has caused quite the fuss. Eventually he was persuaded to forgo the idea, but the amount of paper wasted and incredible disruption to national industries has proven quite detrimental to his image in the eyes of the public."

This time however, he has taken a few steps to ensure his legacy lives on in the eyes of his subjects and his own successors. An enormous statue of Baragzen, one depicting him in full dress uniform, has been erected on a hill overlooking the capital city and has attracted a number of visitors.\n\nUnfortunately the public, likely through the large number of lower class workers that had been hired to work on the project, has become aware of the fact that it was built entirely out of gold. Whilst this no surprise, considering His Majesty's affection for the material, the sheer amount of the metal used has rendered the statue as an example of his greed and continued misallocation of resources within the state. The people clearly are not happy."

tobuck_baragzen.45.t:0 "Telling The Time"
tobuck_baragzen.45.d:0 "Our beloved Zamal has recently purchased himself a watch, one that he intended to wear on a daily basis. This watch was made and decorated in an exuberant fashion, coated with gems and diamonds whilst being constructed almost entirely out of gold. Needless to say it weighed far more than a normal watch, in fact it weighed more than one of His Majesty's hooves. Nevertheless he saw fit to wear it to a dinner party, which resulted in him spraining one of his fetlocks during the event.\n\nWhilst it is impossible to say which creature started the rumours amongst the attending guests, there is no doubt that the members of court at this party started it. To add insult to injury, the papers claim that the magnificent watch doesn't even work! All of this has fostered feelings of resentment over His Majesty's spending habits and Baragzen's repeated attempts to demonstrate the functionality of the overpriced device have not been helping."

tobuck_baragzen.46.t:0 "An Untimely Press Release"
tobuck_baragzen.46.d:0 "Recently the press have been taking great pains to attempt entry into the royal palace, without getting themselves arrested of course. After a few days of what was bordering on harassment, His Majesty graciously allowed a small group inside and walked them around; very slowly, of course. During the trip inside, he wasted no time in expressing his displeasure with their repeated efforts to show the public what he described as his 'private face'.\n\nAccording to their post-visit publications, it seems that they learned far more about his 'private face' than they were supposed to. One journalist managed to sneak off into side rooms of the palace and interviewed several inebriated and, as they note, 'indecent' griffons. Unsurprisingly, when the information was released in their tabloid it caused quite a stir and the effects of the news remains in the mind of the public. Perhaps the Zamal should leave matters of security to those that have fewer secrets that need keeping, in the future."

tobuck_baragzen.47.t:0 "One Feast Of Many"
tobuck_baragzen.47.d:0 "Our beloved Zamal is rather fond of a good meal and even more so for a large number of guests to join him at dinner. As charitable as he is, the invitations are occasionally given out to average citizens. Whilst they are no doubt thankful for the exuberant meals and dinner service, we speculate that such acts of kindness may be the origin for a new rumour regarding His Majesty. They say, in hushed whispers of course, that he's petulant and wholly inappropriate in conversation!\n\nThough this is hardly the worst thing that could have reached the public, it is still a grave and dangerous misrepresentation of Zamal Baragzen that we have sought to rectify. Unfortunately, reactive measures with regards to his image have proven to be a largely ineffective endeavour; we fear that the damage may already be done. After all, once such things are in the hooves of the tabloids there isn't much that can be done."

Unsurprisingly he had all of the latest and greatest in technology and decadency added to the design. It was expensive, but not to a problematic degree. However, now that he has crashed several of said cars on trips into the city - the administration assumes whilst distracted with eating or otherwise enjoying himself - the bill has unfortunately skyrocketed.\n\nAside from the immediate costs, there is also the issue of his citizens being witnesses to the crashes which will take a lot of time and media work to either cover up or otherwise excuse. Luckily His Majesty is perfectly fine, at least with regards to potential injuries from the crash, though his reputation may not be so well kept. The state can at least be thankful that the Zamal did not run any creatures down during his outings."

tobuck_baragzen.49.t:0 "The Zamal's Armour"
tobuck_baragzen.49.d:0 "Despite armour being almost completely useless in modern theatres of war and His Majesty being very unlikely to lead an army even then, the Zamal has nevertheless commissioned a talented steelsinger to construct a new set of armour which vaguely resembles that of griffon knights. It is extravagant in every measure, not least for the amount of gold used and the sizable metal codpiece; as appropriate for our beloved Zamal. Though it takes a long time to take it on and off, he has expressed immense pleasure at the purchase and has spent a lot of time wearing it around over the last week.\n\nOn the other hoof, the event has put his accountants in somewhat of a flap as the cost of the gold alone was exuberant. Far worse is that his brief expeditions into the city - in which he brandished a weapon in his subject's faces and challenged them to duels - have not gone down well with the citizenry. To add insult to injury it seems likely, given his steadily increasing meal size, that the metal suit won't even be usable shortly."

On delicate questioning and a 'routine' inspection of his palace stores, it seems that our Zamal has purchased an inordinate amount of unique and strong alcohol. Given the nature of the seller it is likely that these liquids are at the very least unsafe, but His Majesty refuses to let them be tested for fear that we'll take away his drink.\n\nNot only will this require some careful number fudging, but also some planning to ensure that Baragzen and whoever he decides to carouse with will stay away from the public eye as much as possible during their binges. Whether he will actually manage to stay out of sight and out of mind is another matter entirely."

One of the doctors asked, turning about in his chair and sighing.\n\nThe mare beside him grimaced, mulling over the paper in her hooves. "Not dead is right, for now at least. Something's wrong with him, that much is obvious; I just can't make snout or tail of it. Save for the ulcers on his hindlegs he seems to be mostly in good health, but the Zamal's ability to process food seems to be getting worse every time we do a check-up. Look at this bit on the stool samples. His body isn't processing the food he eats properly anymore."\n\nMarouen pitied whichever poor zebra had to collect and study those samples, given His Majesty's ever-growing food intake. He took the clipboard and studied the notation carefully, coming to the same conclusion that his colleague had that something was wrong. The only problem was that they had no way to figure out which part of Baragzen's digestive system was playing up.\n\n"Mmm. Could be anything from pancreatic overload to... well, cancer; if we're being realistic. Given how poorly he treats his own body there's no way to know for certain what's starting to give out; at least not yet, anyway." The stallion agreed, putting a hoof on his chin.\n\nThey would be able to tell what it was eventually of course; jaundice would make it a liver problem and narcolepsy might lend itself to an iron deficiency which would be an intestinal issue. The real problem was that by the time they could identify the root of the symptoms it might be too late to do anything of substance.\n\nAbir broke the silence with a huff, taking a seat next to Marouen. "You're thinking exactly what I'm thinking, aren't you?"\n\n"You mean that the Zamal isn't going to improve his lifestyle and fix this issue for us? Or that by the time we know what to do, he'll be as good as dead?" He asked tentatively as a severe look crept over his snout.\n\nShe hadn't been asking for a reminder of the former, but it was an accurate behavioural assessment."

tobuck_baragzen.54.d:0 "Zaalhanni and Matanzal stood beside the four-poster bed, completely silent. They didn't often meet, didn't often get along and were almost never out of the reach of their respective mentors; but this was an exception. Baragzen had asked after them for perhaps the first time in his life, only for the siblings to find their father on his deathbed.\n\nThey hardly knew the bed-bound Zamal before them as their own father, having been brought up mostly by his associates and spending little time with him. This was the first time that they had truly been alone with him since they were foals, even for Matanzal. Looking at the zebra now - that jaundice-ridden, morbidly obese and utterly decrepit creature - they felt simply empty.\n\nHe had summoned them both to say goodbye, but was too ill to speak. Baragzen could barely even move his eyes to look at the foals he hadn't raised.\n\nAfter attempting to process her reality and largely failing, Matanzal took a few steps towards the bed and lowered her head. "Yesterday I uhm... I managed to win a duelling competition, father. It was hoof-to-hoof, and... and I was using a sword. I was... respectful, and I did my best."\n\nShe turned to Zaalhanni and vaguely gestured for him to come and say something, lifting a hoof but not knowing what to do with it. The Zamal managed to look from one to the other, blinking once slowly but remaining utterly still besides.\n\n"I spent the day with Vasile, father. We... we were filing paperwork for your companies, and I corrected a fiscal error which could have cost us a uh... a lot. Actually I... I brought you something too, if you like." The stallion managed quietly, once he was beside his sister.\n\nOf course Baragzen couldn't respond, so Zaalhani went ahead and slowly removed the thin box strapped to his back; taking his time with shaking hooves. Once he had untied the string and opened up the package, he revealed his framed degree certificate and placed it tentatively up on his father's bedside table.\n\nThey could have sworn his eyes became a little misty."

What he would not have predicted however was that the empire he created would celebrate his own passing in precisely the same way.\n\nAll throughout the country, parties big and small were hosted to commemorate the long-overdue death of the widely despised Zamal. It was as though all Hazrumenia was suddenly overjoyed at once as music rang out through the night and mirth was plastered on every creature's snout. The decadent tyrant was gone, and every single citizen of the empire could celebrate that; whilst ignoring the question of who would follow in his hoofsteps.\n\nThe pressing matter of succession was being settled in the shadows, between Matanzal and Zaalhanni themselves. Both had roughly equal bases of power and different methods of exerting soft power over certain political circles. They had not the reputation of their father, nor an interest in celebrating his passing; each wished to have the throne, thinking that they could do better than the other.\n\nOn the one hoof, the princess had considerable support amongst the nobility as well as the charisma and heart to bring many upstanding members of the royal court on board. Her influence was widespread despite her age and many creatures had been persuaded by her charm and kindness that Matanzal had displayed over the course of many long years under the shadow of her father.\n\nAll the while, her brother Zaalhanni was immensely popular amongst state bureaucrats and civil servants for his intellect; even some nobles were willing to support him for their economic interests over his more personable sibling. With Vasile's tutelage, he had become a very talented young stallion and one that was particularly well respected by the griffon's associates in the cities where his influence was strongest.\n\nAs the nation bustled through the night and the struggle for power quietly raged, Zal and Zanit would choose their successor."

Unlike the speech in which Baragzen had created the empire that she was soon to rule, the citizenry were now wary of the monarchy more than curious.

Of course, he has left with a considerable number of capable soldiers from the cities and a rather large sum of money to ensure that he remains safe; but the young stallion made no attempt to hide that he intended to become a mercenary like his father.\n\nMost in the country have received the news with a simple shrug of the shoulders, having no particular support for or hatred towards a prince they barely knew; but some have expressed sadness at his departure. The beloved Zamal-Matanzal in particular has expressed her concerns for his safety, especially with a destination like Saddle Arabia.\n\nThe concerns have not phased the prince of course, who was resolute in his decision. Some have speculated that he may take another page from Baragzen's book and attempt to secure power for himself in the future, but the majority consider this to be entirely baseless guesswork.

From you all, I ask in return only that you allow me to demonstrate my ability so that I may earn my place as your Zamal.""

tobuck_baragzen.59.t:0 "The Exile Princess"
tobuck_baragzen.59.d:0 "Much has been written about the strange cyclicality of life, be it contained within modern literature or ancient idioms; but few expected to observe it in such an absurd a fashion as Matanzal closely following her father's hoofsteps.\n\nWith the assent of her mother and a tentative agreement from his brother, the princess has personally elected to depart from the country altogether. Of course, she has left with a considerable number of capable soldiers from noble estates and Oath Warden regiments in addition to a rather large sum of money to ensure that she remains safe; but the young mare made no attempt to hide that she intended to become a mercenary like her father.\n\nMost in the country have received the news with a simple shrug of the shoulders, having no particular support for or hatred towards a princess they barely knew; but some have expressed sadness at her departure. The beloved Zamal-Zaalhaani in particular has expressed his concerns for her safety, especially with a destination like Hindia.\n\nThe concerns have not phased the princess of course, who was resolute in her decision. Some have speculated that she may take another page from Baragzen's book and attempt to secure power for herself in the future, but the majority consider this to be entirely baseless guesswork. This trip abroad is, in all likelihood, merely a means for her to find herself.\n\nThis theory is of course supported by the now public knowledge that the two were engaged in a political scuffle for the throne, which was news that hardly came as a surprise to the citizenry."

### Baragzen heirs events

tobuck_baragzen_heir.1.t:0 "The Mother Of The Princess"
tobuck_baragzen_heir.1.d:0 "Lyna was not what one would expect for an ex-lover of His Majesty. She was a modest, polite and frugal zebra from a family of low nobles Miharzehir that Baragzen happened to meet during his first weeks away from home in the newly established Republic of Tobuck.\n\nWhen they met, he was enamoured by her hospitality and built a caring relationship with her that lasts even to this day. It was this kind and caring zebra that would give birth to and look after Matanzal in the latter years of the republic and the opening stages of her lover's reign. Though His Majesty may be long past his first fling, he still cares for her enough to provide her with important courtly titles and plenty of funds from the royal treasury.\n\nThe pair seldom saw one another these days, but Lyna remains the mare that many spoke to if the nobles of the court needed advice in dealings with Baragzen. She knows perhaps more about him than any other creature in the empire and, despite her duties, has been a loving and present mother for her talented daughter. Many already suspect that Matanzal will be a contender for the throne, which would be rather apt given the respect her mother commanded amongst the nobility; but in truth she simply wished to be a good mother.\n\nShe never stopped loving Baragzen, in spite of his propensities for whatever silly thing occupied his mind. Of course, she knew better than to attempt a defence in front of the average zebra or pony; but their bond had never truly broken, in spite of all the trials and tribulations. Even when the Chiropterrans threatened her home, she knew that he would save her."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.1.a:0 "Through every affair, Lyna remained."

tobuck_baragzen_heir.2.t:0 "The Mother Of The Prince"
tobuck_baragzen_heir.2.d:0 "Very much unlike Matanzal's mother, Palm Blossom was much more of what you'd expect from a warlord-era fling with a commander. That wasn't to say she cared any less for her lover of course - Baragzen could recall plenty of stories involving just how much she cared - but their relationship was considerably more passionate than it was emotionally satisfying.\n\nDespite her lacking nobility and her naturally lower status as a Tobuckian her foal Zaalhanni is nevertheless considered a prince thanks to his father's lineage. As a result, she has been granted a home of her own in His Majesty's palace estate; much to the annoyance of the more exclusive nobles within the court. Though they may attempt to construct elaborate schemes to make her give up her position of relative comfort, she simply smiles and spends time with her colt as they tire themselves out.\n\nThough considerably less wise than Lyna, Palm Blossom is a quick-witted and surprisingly intelligent pony for her lack of education. Both traits have seemingly trickled down to her foal who has recently begun spending a lot of time with one Vasile cel Tradat, an advisor to the Baragzen himself. With his mother's blessing, Zaalhanni receives weekly tutoring from that well-respected griff in the hopes that he'll make it big when he grows up.\n\nGiven the rumours of her many passion-filled nights with Baragzen, it's no surprise to anyone that she is resolute in her accomplishments and driven in her passions; In fact she has supposedly wrestled - and beaten - a noble over a matter of honour. But, like any good mother, she always tries to teach her little colt to be better."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.2.a:0 "Despite every insult, Palm Blossom stood firm."

tobuck_baragzen_heir.3.t:0 "His Heirs"
tobuck_baragzen_heir.3.d:0 "Thanks to Baragzen's Leopardist traditions taking root in his new realm, both Matanzal and Zaalhanni have a perceived equal status as potential heirs to the throne. Though there are other foals that the Zamal has sired, these two have remained easily the most powerful thanks to the positions of their mothers and the reputation of their mothers' associates.\n\nNeedless to say that the various groups surrounding Baragzen and his warband have already begun to pick sides, given that His Majesty appears doing everything in his power to steer clear of the succession question.\n\nLyna, mother of Matanzal, has garnered the support of the more traditional elements within Baragzen's 'court'. Thanks to her reputation and the respect she commands, the home-grown Warzenan nobility and landed businesscreatures have flocked to her state-sponsored home in order to gain her favour and her blessing for their future actions. Of course, she has insisted that such promises be made with her daughter present at every occasion for the sake of her personal development.\n\nOn the other hoof, Palm Blossom has received a lot of love from the Tobuckian citizens of the Baragzen's domain and modernising groups in the nation. In particular, her positive relationship with Vasile has resulted in a large number of businessponies and reputable merchant families pledging their allegiance to her son, who has been enjoying a longstanding educational relationship with the very same griffon. She is far from popular amongst the nobility, being without any such noble blood herself, but that hasn't stopped the mare from making a name for herself and her colt.\n\nThe question on the mind of every creature at the top is obvious: Who will rule after Baragzen inevitably kicks the bucket?"
tobuck_baragzen_heir.3.a:0 "Only time will tell."

tobuck_baragzen_heir.4.t:0 "Her Toy"
tobuck_baragzen_heir.4.d:0 "Even for Lyna, a filly could be quite the hooffull.\n\nThat was not to say that the old mare couldn't handle a little mess, far from it in fact; but there is a limit to what any parent can reasonably handle. After all, she had her own health to look after and needed at least a little time to relax. It wasn't hard to keep an eye on one's foal out of the corner of one's eye. The tricky part was persuading them to play with whatever was most convenient for you, rather than whatever seemed most enjoyable for them.\n\nMatanzal - for once - was sat quietly on the living room carpet surrounded by a litany of toys that she had been out to purchase today with her mother.\n\nBeing as wealthy as they were, there were a lot of options for the foal; but three had immediately piqued the filly's interest: Her mother's cape pulled over a chair, a particularly sturdy doll made of some expensive wood and a rather large wooden sword.\n\nCurious as to what she would pick, Lyna turned just a little to get a good look at which of the many toys her little one would choose. This decision would hardly be a defining feature of her personality, but it might have an impact on her interests later in life.\n\nIn the end, Matanzal giggled and shuffled over to..."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.4.a:0 "...her mother's cape, becoming gleefully lost in the fabric."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.4.b:0 "...the hefty wooden doll, which she proceeded to happily babble at."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.4.c:0 "...that wooden sword, cackling a little as she started swinging."

tobuck_baragzen_heir.5.t:0 "His Butterfly"
tobuck_baragzen_heir.5.d:0 "Palm Blossom was very much aware that her foal appreciated privacy.\n\nEven now, despite his age, Zaalhanni always preferred to play when his mother wasn't looking; an odd little quirk, but nothing to be concerned about. He had a few friends and could handle himself in the utter chaos that were the 'social circles' of other colts his age, but it was clear that he needed a good bit of alone time every now and then.\n\nNeedless to say that Palm was happy to oblige as much, considering her typically hyperbolic days of meeting creatures that either held her in curiously high regard or treated her like dirt. In truth she was overjoyed at the fact that her darling little foal provided her with some peace and quiet.\n\nWith that said, she did occasionally peek around his bedroom door to make absolutely sure that he was alright; moderating her protective nature as best she could. Most of the time he would be playing and occasionally she would catch Zaalhanni trying to read, but today the old mare stumbled across a rather unusual occurrence in her evening check-up.\n\nHer colt was sitting in total silence, watching as a butterfly fluttered around his head. Eventually it came to rest on the ground just in front of him, enjoying the peace of the foal's indecision. She had to wonder just how her sweetheart would react.\n\nAfter a few moments, Zaalhanni..."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.5.a:0 "...reached out and crushed the insect beneath his hoof with a giggle."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.5.b:0 "...got up and darted away to his bed to observe from the safety of his sheets."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.5.c:0 "...slowly lowered his head to the floor and marvelled at the creature."

tobuck_baragzen_heir.6.t:0 "Her Trainer"
tobuck_baragzen_heir.6.d:0 "The typical difficulty with the military is that it's often difficult to encourage creatures to sign up, especially when it comes to noble brats attempting to pay their way out of service. Thankfully, this was far from an issue for Lyna who had convinced her daughter Matanzal to join it almost immediately with a curiously excited response to the idea.\n\nNeedless to say that it was very easy to follow this up with informal meetings from various military officials who themselves were overjoyed at the opportunity to speak to the heiress who might become the nation's next Zamal. Not only that, but knowing His Majesty's first partner as they did the zebras in question were particularly high ranking officials that were awfully charismatic, despite their admittedly considerable age.\n\n"Matanzal! It's time for dinner!" Lyna called out, being immediately greeted by a clamour of hooves as her foal rushed downstairs.\n\nSlipping on the bottom step and nearly falling over, the young mare gasped before galloping into the dining room. "Sorry I'm late mama, I was just writing letters to those generals like you asked."\n\nThe pair smiled at one another as they sat down and began to eat, though the older mare was curious as to who she would choose. "Well, I know you'll be most tactful when picking your favourite, dear. I heard you and and your father's best warrior getting on very well, during their visit; you were all laughs."\n\n"Mamaaa..." She moaned with typical childlike annoyance, "Just because they're fun doesn't mean they're the best choice. I need to learn tactics and how to win wars with my friends as well as on my own, right?"\n\nLyna was a little taken aback by the maturity of the response, but nodded and chuckled. "Yes, that's quite right, someone's clearly been reading a lot more than I thought they had been. So who did you pick?""
tobuck_baragzen_heir.6.a:0 ""That 'camp-aide' seemed like they always knew what to do!""
tobuck_baragzen_heir.6.b:0 ""Well, actually I did pick papa's greatest warrior in the end.""
tobuck_baragzen_heir.6.c:0 ""Papa's favorite instructor is strict, which is a good thing!""

tobuck_baragzen_heir.7.t:0 "His Educator"
tobuck_baragzen_heir.7.d:0 "The thing about education is that it can often be... tricky, if you don't know how to encourage your foals to really get into it. Zaalhanni however was far from difficult to convince in such matters, especially when it came to military tutors. He was fascinated by tactics, technology and organisation as a whole; something that the military schools could teach him about.\n\nLucky for him that Palm Blossom was more than capable of finding the right people working on the ground to talk to for a glimpse of the modern art of war. It was barely a conversation before the young zony was exploring military bases with a litany of low-level officials and talented young officers. After all, with Vasile's connections practically anything was possible; the young stallion wasn't going to waste an opportunity to enjoy himself.\n\nAfter a long day out with the final option for tutoring, Zalhanni burst through the front door. "I'm back mother!"\n\n"Oh! Hello dearest, how was the day trip?" The old mare responded with a warm smile.\n\nIf the smell was any indication, her voice emanating from the kitchen was likely a sign that supper was almost ready. Her foal sauntered in, having removed and hung up his bag in one of the porch closets.\n\n"It was fascinating! A little tiring, I must admit; but fascinating." He returned, going to lay the table as his mother cooked some delicious dish.\n\nPalm chuckled and turned off the hob, beginning to serve the dish. "Today was the... tank place, right? I imagine you enjoyed that very much."\n\n"I did! Your friend was very talkative and I struggled to keep up a little, but we enjoyed each other's company and he seemed very happy to be telling me everything he knew." The zony explained with a tired but genuine smile.\n\n"I'm glad to hear it, little one. I don't suppose you've made a choice yet, have you?\n\nTo her surprise he nodded and said..."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.7.a:0 ""The organiser from the other day who's close with father!""
tobuck_baragzen_heir.7.b:0 ""I really enjoyed my time today, I'll go with the tanker!""
tobuck_baragzen_heir.7.c:0 ""Father's engineer friend was very clever, I choose him!""

tobuck_baragzen_heir.8.t:0 "Her Interests"
tobuck_baragzen_heir.8.d:0 "It's often difficult to gauge the interests of a young mare, as it is to figure out what's going on with any foal; but Matanzal has made no game of looking for things that she enjoys. For some time now it's been her mission to discover - mostly through trial and error - what it is that makes her smile the most as she does it, with the help of her mother Lyna of course.\n\nShe had spent time everywhere from the court to the local markets, trying everything from fishing to organising a military division which rather enjoyed the break from their training. Not all of these things had interested her of course.\n\nOut of the many things that had been explored, there were a 'big three' of sorts. The first had been demonstrated by her time spent around other nobles, which was that the young Matanzal was a rather talented speaker who enjoyed talking to almost everyone she met. The second was her time spent with the general staff, in which she demonstrated a curious capacity for grand strategy and took pleasure in the art of planning. The third and final of her interests was, to nobody's surprise, the art of the sword; something that Lyna was admittedly a little uncomfortable with. After all, being a talented general at least meant that she would probably be far from the frontline; but duelling was very dangerous indeed.\n\nAll the same, it was up to her to choose. "So what would you like to sign up for, sweetheart? I'm sure we can find somewhere for all of these passions of yours."\n\nMatanzal giggled at her mother's enthusiasm before turning back to the list that they had created, a list that had been reduced to the aforementioned three interests. This was mainly for the elder of the two mares, who would be the one organising the various classes and clubs to attend for her foal.\n\nIn the end, it was clear that..."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.8.a:0 "...talking, persuading and schmoozing was right on the money."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.8.b:0 "...playing war games suited her to a tee."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.8.c:0 "...becoming a never-defeated duelist was perfect."

tobuck_baragzen_heir.9.t:0 "His Hobbies"
tobuck_baragzen_heir.9.d:0 "Palm Blossom had long had trouble in trying to identify exactly what it was that her little colt enjoyed doing with his spare time. Not that she wasn't aware of what he was currently doing of course - she did manage to organise a lot of Zaalhanni's daily activities despite her busy schedule after all - but it was occasionally challenging to actually know which of his hobbies he genuinely enjoyed.\n\nFortunately, there was a simple solution to this: ask the young stallion to write down what his interests actually were when he had a spare afternoon.\n\nWhen he actually started putting pencil to paper about what he enjoyed, the old mare was actually rather surprised by how many of the items were things that she had gotten him into; but at the same time there were a lot of things in which Zaalhanni had clearly developed an interest of his own accord.\n\n"I think that's all of them, mother. I'll probably remember a few more later, but these are the most important ones that come to mind." He gave out with a warm smile, pushing the paper forwards.\n\nShe took the paper and gave it a read, nodding at most and raising an eyebrow at others. "I never knew you had an interest in politics, I thought it would have too many idiots and too much talking for your tastes."\n\nThe young stallion rolled his eyes and chuckled, knowing that the reason he was interested was because those idiots were exactly why politics would be so easy and enjoyable. That wasn't to say he would be particularly exploitative in politics of course, but it was a field of work that he assumed would be therapeutic for its relative ease.\n\nHaving let a good half of a minute pass, Palm put the paper down again. "Okay, so what are your favourites out of all of these? There's a good few in here, but what's properly up your alley? Something you could maybe see yourself doing when you're much older."\n\nNow that was a good question, but he did have an answer."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.9.a:0 ""Well, politics is a good opportunity for anypony!""
tobuck_baragzen_heir.9.b:0 ""It's not much of a job, but I bet I'll be reading 'til I'm old.""
tobuck_baragzen_heir.9.c:0 ""Vasile has showed me a lot about finances, and I like it a lot!""

tobuck_baragzen_heir.10.t:0 "Her Fascinations"
tobuck_baragzen_heir.10.d:0 "Even foals had grey days from time to time.\n\nMatanzal was far from a boring young mare, but every-so-often she would find herself at a loose end. Sometimes it was boredom, other times it was the weather; but one way or another there would be an off day every few months.\n\nThough Lyna could never find a reason as to why these things happened to occur, she did know how to tell a very good story. So it was that whenever such a bout of utter 'meh' hit her foal, she would put down whatever it was that she was doing and tell a tale of wonder for her special little filly. Of course she knew very well that Matanzal was rather far beyond the classic tales that you would read to very young creatures, but that didn't stop her from coming up with the most imaginative of narratives.\n\nOver time it became clear that certain stories got better responses in terms of mood improvement than others, but she wasn't entirely sure what caused the disparity at first. Her young mare was more than capable of saying what she liked about a story, but quickly Lyna realised that the narrative mattered far less than certain subject matters.\n\nThere were three things of particular note that Matanzal always enjoyed hearing about: Guns, the Oath Wardens and planes. A strange combination certainly, but then she herself was interested in gardening, political intrigue and playing poker when nobody else was looking. Strange sets of interests were very much a commonality in the family, even if one were to remove His Majesty from the equation.\n\nIn any case the stories about adventures going overseas to Griffonia soon became zebras flying to Asterion, soldiers were gradually supplanted by Oath Wardens and ancient spears were slowly replaced with guns. Lyna's stories always did the trick, one way or another.\n\nBut, out of her three favourites, there was one subject that could engross her more than any other."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.10.a:0 "She couldn't get enough when it came to firearms."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.10.b:0 "The filly was positively obsessed with the Oath Wardens."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.10.c:0 "Planes captured her imagination like nothing else."

tobuck_baragzen_heir.11.t:0 "His Fascinations"
tobuck_baragzen_heir.11.d:0 "Even though it was hard to get a bearing on his interests as a whole, it was easy to know what his passions truly were. All Palm Blossom had to do was ask Zaalhanni about whatever he was doing, and you could tell his interest based on the length and detail of the response.\n\nFrom this she knew that one of the things he enjoyed doing the least was writing letters; but, more importantly, she had also figured out what his particular favourites were. Her precious little foal ramble for hours on trucks, tanks and ships; it was pretty regular stuff for a young stallion, though his passion and knowledge on the three topics had been rather unexpected. She could have sworn that he had access to top-secret documentation for all of the details that he somehow retained in that little head of his.\n\nAll the same, she was left with a question that nagged at her continuously: which one was his absolute favourite? Of course, she would probably struggle to hire out a battleship for his birthday; but perhaps she could arrange for him to command a tank for a day out or let him learn to drive one of those military trucks when he got older. In fact, it was potentially possible that Vasile could arrange for the crew of a naval vessel to let Zaalhanni take the wheel for a little while. That would certainly be an entertaining sight.\n\nDeciding finally that it was time to get an answer, Palm carefully knocked on her son's door. "Zaal, do you have a moment?"\n\n"I do," He returned with a warm smile, "What's up?\n\n"Well, I suddenly had thought. Dangerous I know, but hear me out." She explained, getting a chuckle from the colt at his desk. "I believe I've had a rather good idea for your birthday that's coming up. If - and this is a big if - I can get permission, would you rather: drive a truck, command a tank or helm a ship?"\n\nHis face lit up in excitement, before transforming into a rather severe expression of contemplation."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.11.a:0 ""Driving a truck sounds so fun!""
tobuck_baragzen_heir.11.b:0 ""I could go anywhere in a tank!""
tobuck_baragzen_heir.11.c:0 ""Like a proper actual warship? That's amazing!""

tobuck_baragzen_heir.12.t:0 "Her Allies"
tobuck_baragzen_heir.12.d:0 "Despite the reassurances that her mother had given her, Matanzal knew very well that her first days at the academy could decide the creatures she would spend the rest of her adult life working beside. The problem was not that she did not have options, in fact the opposite was true; she could make friends with just about anyone, but it was up to her to find a cliqué to truly settle down in for the duration of her academy training.\n\nThe obvious choice was to sit down at the table with the snobbiest nobles she could find and make friends with them. That wouldn't be difficult, if not for her charisma and position as heiress then for her mother's reputation which was something they would certainly be aware of. Even the most stuck up of nobles could be kind in time and the wealth of their families could be an asset in the future, but they might end up being more trouble than they were worth.\n\nAnother choice were the religious groups which, whilst small, were not to be ignored in this decision. Though the military schools for creatures her age were largely reserved for the nobility, there were some priests here too. It was probably some sort of requirement for the academies to accept some of the priesthood, either by some historical convention or modern practicality. Priests were not rich or good at schmoozing, but they also weren't despised by the public in any real sense. Of course the whole Zal and Zanit business might get a little irritating at times, but having friends that nobody could or would complain about was not an opportunity she could simply pass over.\n\nFinally, there were the Oath Warden scholarship students; the ones that had managed to prove themselves worthy in various competitions and challenges. Matanzal did not have such a scholarship, but then she didn't need one to make friends with them or even to be an Oath Warden if she so chose. They were a down to earth bunch, not very into the whole politics business beyond telling stories about whatever idiotic thing Baragzen had ordered the OWs to do. They were an appealing group all the same, especially considering their round-the-clock palace access.\n\nAfter a brief moment of stillness, the young mare took her lunch and trotted over to..."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.12.a:0 "...a table of particularly uppity nobles with a smile."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.12.b:0 "...a little gathering of priests at the back of the hall."

tobuck_baragzen_heir.13.t:0 "His Allies"
tobuck_baragzen_heir.13.d:0 "Though making friends from scratch wasn't a particularly enjoyable experience, the bonds that Zaalhanni went out of his way to forge never truly broke. It had been difficult, having to go to this academy instead of the places that most of his foalhood friends were attending. It still amazed the young stallion just how important he was, a fact of which he was consistently reminded whenever he entered a room for at least the first few weeks of his time at the academy.\n\nStill, he was going to have to get over it and make some new friends if he didn't want to get the reputation of a loner.\n\nThe young stallion's first thought was of the top-marking middle class students. Something that Vasile had taught him was that the creatures with the most potential and intelligence were the ones that worked their way up, which made a lot of sense. Those creatures would be personable, intellectual and influential in time. He'd get on with them very well too, if he put a little more work into his grades of course.\n\nNext on his list of options were the up-and-coming generals. Much like him, they were at the academy to be trained and conditioned for war; the main difference was that war would become their specialisation. They were rough, tough and much louder than he was really comfortable with, but that wouldn't stop him making friends with them if it was the right call. As father always said before his years of debauchery, 'a loyal army will keep you safe'.\n\nLast on the list were the largely Tobuckian groups who had been brought here on a sort of exchange-esque type deal for the development of the custodianship. They already admired his mother and, despite his lineage, had high hopes for him too which made their generally closed-off social circles quite appealing. Not only that, but Vasile was modelling the way all cities were run off of Tobuck which was something to consider. The more he learned about and delved into the Tobuckian parts of the nation, the more of the silent majority would approve of him in the long run.\n\nOnce he'd collated a well-rounded dinner from the academy chefs, Zaalhanni decided to..."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.13.a:0 "...cosy up with the future intelligentsia."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.13.b:0 "...wrangle those officers-in-training"
tobuck_baragzen_heir.13.c:0 "...hang out with the Tobuckians and make his mother proud."

tobuck_baragzen_heir.14.t:0 "Her Foalhood Friend"
tobuck_baragzen_heir.14.d:0 "It was hardly an issue that Lyna had expected to run into, but on her little filly's first day at school it became rather clear that everyone else was seemingly scared of the heiress. It was probably just a result of the the place she had chosen being a mixed school for nobles and lowborns, which made the little ones either too seemingly disparate to speak to her or too intimidated by her reputation. Well, 'reputation' being the noble kids' parents telling them to be careful around the heiress of course.\n\nAll the same, Matanzal was determined to make friends; as was to be expected from that bundle of charisma and joy. In fact, in the couple of weeks alone it seemed like she had spoken to just about everyone in the class at least a little.\n\nHowever, Lyna was yet to receive any guests in the house.\n\nIt was unsurprising that her beloved foal would eventually ask to bring a friend around for dinner, but she didn't actually know who it would be. There were a lot of little ones there, but she earnestly didn't know who it was that Matanzal would be trotting home with.\n\nSoon enough, the concerned mare would have her question answered."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.14.a:0 "Her filly had befriended a Warzenan noble that lived in Tobuck."

tobuck_baragzen_heir.15.t:0 "His Foalhood Friend"
tobuck_baragzen_heir.15.d:0 "In truth, Palm Blossom had never been worried about her little colt making friends. It wasn't that he was incapable of making any, but she knew that Zaalhanni would take things at his own pace; making sure to only do what he was comfortable with, beside whoever made him feel safest. She knew some foals would be a bit scared or treat him as though he was somehow less of a noble than they were, but she was confident in her little colt.\n\nA few weeks into his education was apparently all her foal needed, much to her surprise.\n\nOne morning her son simply trotted into the kitchen and asked, "Can my best friend come over on the weekend?"\n\nTo which the old mare had instantly replied, "Of course!"\n\nNeedless to say that she was now very curious as to who Zaalhanni had settled on to help him through foalhoad. It probably wasn't going to be anyone exuberant, but knowing her special little colt it wasn't a total impossibility. He was very talented, even if that talent only revealed itself after one really got to know him.\n\nOnce the day came, both Palm and her little bundle of joy were rather excited. For her that meant preparing a meal for whoever the foal's parents turned out to be and for him it was one of the few occasions on which he actually seemed to be containing himself, for one reason or another.

tobuck_baragzen_heir.16.d:0 "Studying can often be challenging.\n\nThat's not to say that Matanzal lacked intelligence of course, she was an incredible capable individual; but that didn't make certain things any easier. Unlike her step brother, the heiress truly did struggle with mathematics and algebra in particular. Her grasp of the basics was sound, but unfortunately there was simply something in the way of her aptitude otherwise.\n\nThe issue with admitting she needed help was that the creatures at the academy held her in such high regard that a good few of them would use her vulnerability as a way to get favours, or something of that ilk. After all, who wouldn't take advantage of the Zamal's daughter if they had half a chance? Therein laid her predicament.\n\nWith this in mind, there were some that she trusted to keep a secret; though they might be rather surprised to learn that she needed help.\n\nThere was the really rowdy one from her class who had a heart of gold in truth, there was the neat freak who had good intentions but occasionally overstepped their boundaries and then there was the mare with her head in the clouds. She was sure that she knew all of their names, but right now Matanzal had to make a decision and figure that sort of thing out once she had politely asked for a little assistance.\n\nIn a snap decision, she..."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.16.a:0 "...decided to gently poke the metaphorical bear."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.16.b:0 "...settled on the neatness-obsessed one, thinking of it as an opportunity."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.16.c:0 "...chose the distracted mare, hoping for a little concentration."

tobuck_baragzen_heir.17.t:0 "His School Friend"
tobuck_baragzen_heir.17.d:0 "Zaalhanni had never been great at making new friends and was even less proficient at asking for help from the ones he did have.\n\nIt wasn't that he was prideful, more that it was simply difficult to admit that he was struggling. Despite his position as a potential heir, it wasn't as though he'd had an easy life from an emotional standpoint; the young stallion always felt like he had something to prove. Part of it was being some half-blood noble and the other half was because he assumed that everyone at the top was watching him and constantly comparing him to his step-sister.\n\nIf it weren't for the fact that he was actually interested in certain aspects of running a nation, he wouldn't have had much of a chance at all.\n\nUnfortunately, he did occasionally run into some difficulties with his schoolwork. He wasn't infallible, no matter how much he tried to be. At some point he'd have to ask one of his friends to help him out, which was rather problematic considering that most of them had some amount of intrapersonal scheming going on. He needed someone he could trust to help and someone that wouldn't talk about it behind his back.\n\nThere was the mare who studied theorems of manoeuvre warfare at every given opportunity who would be more than happy to help, there was the one who obsessed over defence in depth on a grander scale and there was the son of a Tobuckian sailor. They weren't exactly stellar options for reliable tutorage but he trusted them and they were just as smart as he was, if not more so. He'd need to choose if he wanted to keep up with the class work they were all being set.\n\nAfter some slow deliberation, Zaalhanni settled on..."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.17.a:0 "...the armour-loving mare. Her passion would make her a good teacher."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.17.b:0 "...the one who loved going on the defensive."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.17.c:0 "...the Tobuckian. He seemed much more relaxed."

tobuck_baragzen_heir.18.t:0 "Her Adjutant"
tobuck_baragzen_heir.18.d:0 "One of the cooler things about being an officer in the imperial army as a noble was choosing your adjutant. They were essentially a military secretary, doing all the things that the officers didn't want to do or simply didn't have the time for. In truth Matanzal was more than capable of organising all of the organisational stuff on her own, but she wasn't going to turn down the opportunity to make a new friend as an officer.\n\nThey had already been supplied with a few papers on who they could choose, given about ten options which the heiress had narrowed down to three after some careful consideration. All she had to do now was make the final choice on what suited her best.\n\nIzzak was a relatively new creature to the realm of warfare, at least in comparison to the other options; but that didn't make him any less skilled. Well it did actually, but his skill set was strong enough that she could see the potential for him to be just as good at his job than anyone else she might choose in time. It was also nice because he was much closer to her age than the other two options, but that wasn't really a key factor.\n\nOne of the particularly skilled individuals on her radar meanwhile was Pizayh, an older but innovative zebra in the world of offensive operations. His record was unmatched, but it also explained that he was somewhat of a maverick when played on the field. Placing him in command was as much a guarantee of confusion as it was success.\n\nOn the other hoof, there was Lezzellah. She was also talented, but in defence more so than offence. That was not a problem in and of itself, but Matanzal was personally partial to a doctrine of attacking over defending. With this in mind, the mare was uniquely talented in urban warfare, which was a talent that none of her other choices possessed. Her skill set was situational perhaps, but it could save her.\n\nThe heiress leaned back in her bunk and sighed, knowing that she unfortunately had only one to pick. After some umming and erring, the young mare eventually decided upon..."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.18.a:0 "...Izzak, for his incredible potential."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.18.b:0 "...Pizayh, for his spotless track record and favoured doctrine."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.18.c:0 "...Lezzellah, for her unique set of skills."

tobuck_baragzen_heir.19.t:0 "His Adjutant"
tobuck_baragzen_heir.19.d:0 "As with any occupation, the high command of any military has a lot of administrative work which is usually considered to be far too much for just one officer. In the case of the imperial army, this remains true; but the adjutants were mostly distributed to make sure young noble generals didn't do anything overwhelmingly stupid during their time in service.\n\nIt was for this reason that many of the applications Zaalhanni had received for the position were rejected, albeit politely. Unfortunately there were simply too many zebras that assumed they could coast off of the success and prowess of their superior officer, not realising that they would have to serve that very same noble in times of war when the aforementioned stupidity could very quickly become a problem. For the young stallion, it had been easy to narrow down his choices.\n\nHis first choice of three was a zebra by the name of Yelaiah who was an incredible strategist and a marvel to witness when planning an urban operation. Unfortunately, she was... unpredictable, if one was to be polite. The soldiers she commanded considered her - so they said - to be worse than the enemy when in a bad mood; and there was some truth in that.\n\nTick Tack on the other hoof was a particularly promising newcomer from Tobuck who had little in the way of experience, but clearly had the capacity to learn and learn quickly. Not only that, but she had a curious knack for fighting in hilly terrain which was a skill sorely lacking in the armed forces, especially in an officer with such potential.\n\nAnd finally, there was Orezidh. He was a strict noblezebra, subscribing primarily to a static doctrine of deliberate and layered defence. His age betrayed his incredible skill and occasionally tricky tactics as he was an individual of immense prowess under the right circumstances. Perhaps his experience was exactly what Zaalhanni needed in an adjutant.\n\nThe zony leaned back at his desk and sighed, eventually settling on..."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.19.a:0 "...Yelaiah, for her tireless assaults."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.19.b:0 "...Tick Tack, for the boundless possibilities her talent offered."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.19.c:0 "...Orezidh, for his unwavering discipline."

tobuck_baragzen_heir.20.t:0 "Changing Times"
tobuck_baragzen_heir.20.d:0 "Matanzal and Zaalhanni didn't often spend time with one another, but when they did it was usually a very enjoyable experience. Of course the latter was always a little jealous of the attention that the former received from their father and the former was always envious of the latter's grades; but as a general rule, the pair got on very well indeed.\n\nAt this particular moment, they were having a little picnic in Lyna's garden.\n\n"Have you been to look at schools yet?" Matanzal asked, mouth still full of sandwich.\n\nZaalhanni sighed and nodded, "Uhuh, apparently I have to go every day! Well, every day except the weekends. Gonna have to talk to dumb kids and fight with swords and stuff. I don't get that; guns exist, right?"\n\nOf course the filly did have somewhat of an interest in swordfighting, but she had known the zony for a long time already and understood that he didn't mean to be insulting. It was true that firearms had largely rendered spears and other hoof-to-hoof obsolete, but that didn't make them any less of an interest for the young mare.\n\n"Swords are cool though," She retorted with a smile, "What about like, private teachers? What's the word, uhm... Tutors! That's it, tutors."\n\nThe colt nodded again, waiting until he had finished a biscuit to respond. "Yeah. Seen lotsa creatures in the house this week; I don't really get it, isn't being taught supposed to be what the academies are for?"\n\n"Apparently they help you with stuff. I dunno really." Matanzal responded, putting a hoof to her chin in thought.\n\nWell that made some sense at least, but there was something far more important than that on the young stallion's mind right now. "Wanna play tag?""
tobuck_baragzen_heir.20.a:0 "For now, life was still full of games and sweets."

tobuck_baragzen_heir.21.t:0 "Princess And Prince"
tobuck_baragzen_heir.21.d:0 "It had been quite some time since their last meetup, but the heir and the heiress still recognised one another.\n\nZaalhanni smiled and sighed, having made and eaten dinner with his mother out of the house. "Y'know, I'm kinda looking forward to command. It'll be a little boring sometimes, at least if Vasile's friends know what they're talking about, but I think it'll be good for me too."\n\n"Easy for you to say, you haven't been interested in fighting for most of your life!" Matanzal retorted with a chuckle, though there was some genuine annoyance in her voice. "Seriously though, I think it'll be a mixed bag. It's not like we'll be put in charge of everything, but creatures'll do what we ask them to and... Well, we might have to actually fight a war; there is that."\n\nThey were both silent for a moment then. The idea that they, as young and inexperienced as they were, could be put in charge of an entire army in a time of war. They could have blood on their hooves if they screwed up, or even if they didn't. They'd long been taught of becoming numb to the loss of life over time, but it didn't make the potential sacrificies they might have to make an easier pill to swallow.\n\nThe talk of death had also brought up another issue in their minds. They weren't stupid, they knew what their father was doing to himself; they'd just always managed to avoid the topic in the past.\n\n"Mata, will you promise me something?" The young stallion asked, far more nervous than usual. "When father... Zanit I can't even say it... When he uh, you know, passes on; if you get into power I don't and wont want to hurt you. I just... What happened to father's predecessor, I don't want that to happen again."\n\nThe zebra looked at him, then nodded furiously. "I was... thinking the same thing Zaal. I don't want to see you as a monster if you get it and... And I don't want to treat you like one if the crown falls on my head. Whatever happens, I just want you to be happy."\n\n"Same here, I... I don't want to lose any more of the little family I have. I swear to that too." He returned in earnest."
tobuck_baragzen_heir.21.a:0 "The siblings cared for one another, always."

### Alesia events

tobuck_alesia.1.t:0 "Who Will Follow My Orders?"
tobuck_alesia.1.d:0 "A young regime without internal alliances is doomed to failure. That was something that Alesia had learned from Severyana as the nobles had alienated all possible support bases for their rule in the years before the revolution.\n\nKnowing this, she had an important choice to make. Two warlords in Tobuck remained and she needed the support of one to guarantee a victory against the other. Baragzen, an exiled noble with a reputation for capriciousness, was one. The other was Wallnut, a radical known for his skill and zealous commitment to revolutionary ideals.\n\nNeither were perfect candidates, but she quickly came to the conclusion that..."
tobuck_alesia.1.a:0 "Baragzen's connections would be of utmost importance."
tobuck_alesia.1.b:0 "Though Wallnut was a radical his skill would be invaluable."

tobuck_alesia.2.t:0 "A Most Noble Donation"
tobuck_alesia.2.d:0 "Though her program of Severyanian repatriation had brought many lost ponies to Tobuck it had brought few gifts and, as of yet, none of this calibre. Alesia had just been granted an immense sum of money from a particularly wealthy exile who, in spite of her limited repute, was apparently enamoured by her successes thus far.\n\nHer aide, one Entin Miron, stood with her as they watched the ship of the kind donor unload in port. "Commander, I'm of the opinion that we should use this money to modernise our weapon stockpiles; it's high time that we retired our old materiel."\n\n"Without the facilities required to produce them en masse, we may end up with too few weapons overall; though you are right to say that our current stockpile is worryingly outdated." She retorted, though appreciative of his insight.\n\nQuantity or quality, industrial prowess or improved equipment. A difficult choice to make, but she quickly decided that..."
tobuck_alesia.2.a:0 "They needed new industrial equipment."
tobuck_alesia.2.b:0 "Modern firearms were a necessary expense."

tobuck_alesia.3.t:0 "Who Will Be Tsar?"
tobuck_alesia.3.d:0 "Another small stack of paper, another list of potential candidates. Alesia had almost lost hope for the various lineages of Severyana by now, having spent years looking over the most distant of cousins and the most absurd family trees. Nevertheless, new claimants were found every now and then; though few held any interest in the position of Tsar.\n\nA profile of five new ponies had been compiled for her, but none of them were particularly impressive. A drunk, a lunatic, somepony that was old enough to die before she could possibly hope to reclaim the homeland and another two that were at least relatively promising. Even so, they were far from perfect; one was hardly active with the exiled community and another didn't even live in Equus anymore.\n\nAlesia sighed and rubbed her forehead with her right hoof, staring at the papers for a moment before standing up and trotting over to one of many filing cabinets in her office."
tobuck_alesia.3.a:0 "Someday, a worthy successor will reveal themselves."

tobuck_alesia.4.t:0 "The Importance of Faith"
tobuck_alesia.4.d:0 "Strolling the along some old hoofpath away from the buzz of the city, Alesia thought back to what she'd seen earlier that day. Ponies and zebras gathered together outside for a ceremony honouring one of their gods, singing hymns together under the scorching Zebrican sun. These creatures had nothing: although Alesia's governance had rooted out much of the corruption and decadence of the criminal-elite, she was under no illusions. These creatures, her creatures, had no security, they had no heritage, they were surrounded by enemies, and most of them owned little more than the clothes on their backs. And yet they had their faith.\n\nPerhaps that was why the red devils hated religion so, she thought, gazing up at the moon. They could take home, family, property and nation away from honest creatures, but in order to truly break them they had to also take their gods. Alesia had never been a particularly religious mare, but she swore then and there that she would not run a secular state. Tobuck would be united in faith, just as soon as she had consolidated her rule enough to make it so.\n"And what shall I swear this to?" she mused aloud, remembering the moonlit rituals her family used to perform, so long ago."
tobuck_alesia.4.a:0 ""I guess I'll swear this to you.""

tobuck_alesia.5.t:0 "Victory Over Chiropterra"
tobuck_alesia.5.d:0 "The reports were grim. The financial and materiel cost of the war against Chiropterra had been high, but the occupation was quickly becoming even more expensive. Raids, terror attacks and all manner of resistance activity were rampant; but if they retreated from the territory then their regime of zealots would simply return under new leadership, one that would also wish see Tobuck annihilated. What choice did they have but to stay?\n\n"Good evening ma'am," An unfamiliar voice gave out from behind her.\n\nAlesia stopped and started. She knew all of her servants personally; whoever this was, they were an intruder that had slipped past her guards. Instinctively she drew her pistol and wheeled about, pointing the weapon squarely at the forehead of the interloper.\n\nWithout hesitation or stutter she demanded an explanation, "Who are you and why didn't you take the opportunity to kill me whilst my back was turned?"\n\n"Because I, a loyal servant of the Chiropterran Moonspeakers, was not ordered to take your life. I have been tasked with delivering this to you and nothing more." The hooded zebra replied, hardly batting an eye.\n\nHe raised a hoof slowly into one of his robes' pockets and drew out a small scroll, which he then placed on a cabinet. Alesia marched forward and took it, keeping her gaze firmly planted on her uninvited guest all the while.\n\nShe turned to the still-open door and called out, "Guards! Take this stallion away!"\n\nThe zebra nodded slowly, before sitting on the floor and starting to pray in a language she didn't understand. Recognising that he wasn't a threat, Alesia holstered her weapon and read the note as a cacophony of friendly hooves thundered down the hallway to her quarters.\n\nIt was an invitation."
tobuck_alesia.5.a:0 "She was on the phone to Entin within minutes."

tobuck_alesia.6.t:0 "Blessed Of The Moon"
tobuck_alesia.6.d:0 "Entin was pacing back and forth, his boots clacking against the stone of this abandoned house's courtyard. He was convinced that this was a trap, which was a reasonable assumption to make all things considered. His commanding officer on the other hoof thought this would be the precursor to some kind of ceasefire or conditional surrender. If the Chiropterran Moonspeakers wanted her dead, they would have killed her already by now.\n\nA collection of hooftsteps grabbed their attention. As promised, a group of moonspeakers headed by one just ahead of the rest approached them. Alesia waited for one in their number to speak.\n\n"Alesia Snezhnaya, I assume?"\n\nShe nodded, "And you are?"\n\nThe figure stepped into better view and smiled, "Lunar Hail; I am the representative for all Moonspeakers in Chiropterra." She returned, stopping and bowing deeply before the warlord.\n\nThen the rest bowed too, following their leader's example. They both knew of her, one of the most zealous and renowned authorities of their faith. Why was she here and, more importantly, why were they bowing?\n\nAlesia smiled, mostly out of surprise. "I see. Am I not your enemy, thanks to recent events?"\n\n"On the contrary, you deserve the utmost respect for your achievements. Only a worthy individual, one with the blessing of the Nightmare could defeat Her Imperial Majesty's legions and-"\n\n"These kind words are appreciated, but the longer this takes the more of my soldiers die fighting yours. What is the point of all this?" The pony cordially demanded.\n\nFor a moment Lunar looked displeased, but remembered then that her legion too was suffering. "Of course. To be blunt, we wish for you to rule over Chiropterra; the Nightmare blessed you with gifts and us with you, we shall not waste that opportunity.""
tobuck_alesia.6.a:0 "Entin and Alesia stared at one another, dumbfounded."

tobuck_alesia.7.t:0 "To Whom We Are Sworn"
tobuck_alesia.7.d:0 "For a while there was silence. The terms for cooperation had been laid out, mostly by the Moonspeakers for fear that either party would displease the other. Alesia's eyes slowly scanned the faces of the legion commanders, but they were difficult to read. In that respect, they were much like her.\n\nEmerald Light was the first to speak, glancing at Lunar Hail before resting her attention on their new ruler. "It's the only reasonable solution. I do as the faith commands."\n\nShe bowed and stepped back for the others to voice their minds.\n\n"So long as we maintain our status and keep our legions, I take no issue with this agreement. The Nightmare wills and I follow." Autumn Breeze agreed, performing a similar act of respect.\n\nLightning Charm scowled, but nodded nonetheless. "I am displeased primarily with the performance of our military. I shall cooperate on the provision that I am permitted to reform the legions so that they never suffer such a loss again."\n\nAlesia assented to that request, seeing as it would only benefit their combined armed forces. Then she looked to the two remaining figures, who looked somewhat ambivalent. Stone Palisade simply shrugged and bowed, knowing that this was the way forward and seeing their loss as demonstrative of the need for change. Eternal Eclipse was clearly disgruntled, but he made to speak.\n\n"I agree to the proposal, on the condition that I be permitted retire and that my position will be given to my grandson Lucent. I am too old now to reform Chiropterra on such a scale as this, but he shall be of much use to you."\n\nThe warlord acceded, "That can be arranged.""
tobuck_alesia.7.a:0 "Now they could all sleep in peace."

tobuck_alesia.8.t:0 "Protector Of The Faith"
tobuck_alesia.8.d:0 ""...and so it is with great pride and greater hope that I proclaim myself defender of the Nightmare's faith and her faithful in Zebrica and across the world. This land belongs to me as your Tsaritsa and the Nightmare as your Goddess in equal measure." Alesia gave out, finishing her speech and sighing with the knowledge that she would definitely still need the script during the address.\n\nThe familiar sound of Entin's quick trot alerted her to his presence at the door to her office. He was still in uniform even at this hour of the night, but then so was she. They had both had a very long day.\n\nHe made a half-hearted smile, "Not bad. You sure know what to say to these zealots."\n\n"Can we not do this right now?" She snapped immediately.\n\n"No. We can not not do this right now, especially not after you shot me down the first time. What in Tartarus are you doing, cooperating with these maniacs? You told me that your parents never got through to you!" He pressed, furrowing his brow at the attempt to push the question further down the road.\n\nAlesia set down the paper she had been reading from and lowered her head onto a wooden trunk with a grimace, looking at her long-time friend out of the corner of her eye.\n\n"They didn't Ent, not like that anyway. I never accepted their faith for a number of reasons, but I never turned it away either. Right now I just want the violence to stop. We need it to stop." She answered slowly, lifting her head and taking some long breaths.\n\nHe stood there silently, before nodding. "Promise me you'll be careful with all this Nightmare stuff. I'm just worried about where it might lead, that's all.""
tobuck_alesia.8.a:0 "Her expression softened, "I'll be careful, for you.""

tobuck_alesia.9.t:0 "A Sovereign's Regalia"
tobuck_alesia.9.d:0 "All that time spent looking for a successor, only to become one. She had spent so long in Zebrica fighting for money, for Severyana and for a goal that always seemed so far away. Now here she was, with leadership thrust upon her in a fashion she could never have expected.\n\nThe medals she wore on her royal attire were numerous and heavy. Some were from her time in the Royal Guard, some were awarded during her time fighting for various factions in Zebrica and some had been bestowed by the Chiropeterrans. It was almost an alien feeling to be all dressed up like this now, so far away from home. But this was home now. Novaya Severyana would be her realm and her legacy, her nation and people to mould as she saw fit. Commanding an army was now commanding a state and a society, one that could be great but one that equally could never be quite what she had envisioned to settle down in.\n\nDespite it all, she felt an inkling of pride; in a roundabout sort of way she'd achieved what she had arrived in Zebrica to do. All that remained was to finish what she was now starting."
tobuck_alesia.9.a:0 "To victor goes the spoils and hardships."

tobuck_alesia.10.t:0 "Our New Home"
tobuck_alesia.10.d:0 "Alesia watched the crew of the ship, a markedly out-of-date cruiser, lower a ramp onto the docks. They must have kept it in its original state out of nostalgia as she had with her uniform, though how anypony could have escaped the homeland with a vessel of such size was beyond her. Luck most likely, or it was one of the few ships that had been out of port during the revolution.\n\nThat train of thought was cut short as she watched its occupants disembark. A line of lower nobles, a few generals, some soldiers and a few average citizens exited their floating scrapheap; followed by the crew shortly afterwards. Though their number was few, this was more than she had been expecting. Even its people were now largely apathetic to the dream of reclaiming Severyana, but some heeding her call was better than none at all. They needed all of the exiles that they could get their hooves on and this was a start, if little more."

tobuck_alesia.11.d:0 ""Will you swear upon your honour, life and devotion to the Nightmare to govern the multitudinous creatures of the this new tsardom?"

Alesia returned, her voice echoing off of the cathedral walls.\n\n"Will you, with all the powers granted to you, rule for her will first and your wisdom second; with mercy for all your subjects?" The Moonspeaker continued, words booming out.\n\n"I will."\n\n"Will you to the utmost of your power maintain the will the Nightmare and the true profession of her most holy gospel? Will you in all of your granted strengths maintain the oaths of your forefathers before you? Will you, with these gifts from our goddess that raises the moon, do all in your power to work in service of your people before all else?"\n\n"All this I promise to do. The things which I have before promised, I will perform and keep; so help me Nightmare." She finished, wondering silently to herself whether their deity would be truly pleased with her ascension.\n\nSome more ceremony followed, the anointing and the providing; all without issue, as expected for an event so rehearsed as this. Alesia didn't need to think much for those, only sit in her royal seat stoically until it was time to receive the newly made crown jewels. As Lunar placed the crown on her head and the seated dignitaries stood up to sing the old Severyanian anthem, Tsaritsa Alesia stood herself with a hoof to her chest and one thought in her mind."

tobuck_alesia.12.d:0 "This would have been dull even if she wasn't Tsaritsa. This ceaseless debate about when Nightmare Night should be was farcical in the extreme, yet it was important enough to the faith that making the decision for them could be taken poorly. For whatever reason this argument seemed to transcend the usual waxist-revivalist divide on occasion and thus was seemingly impossible to resolve.\n\nOne half of the Moonspeakers wanted to keep the date as it was, seeing that there was really no reason to change it as it was already an anticipated national holiday. The others, taking the opportunity of new management to press their agenda, wished to rediscover the day of the year that it was originally supposed to be; as though it really mattered what time of the year that the Nightmare was celebrated. In Alesia's mind the obvious time to do such a thing, if it mattered at all, would be the winter solstice. But, with the aggressive tone that was resurfacing for the third time today, she decided that this wasn't her fight.\n\nThe monarch slumped in her seat and stifled a yawn as the shouting began again, tempted to pray for her slowly dwindling patience and sanity."

The Moonspeaker pleaded, though with little fear in his voice.\n\nFor how worrying it was that three policecreatures currently shared his kitchen with him, he was at least aware that they couldn't hurt him. No matter what the zebra may or may not have done, his role as Moonspeaker was sacred; on the other hoof, he really didn't want to find out what methods they employed besides the threat of force.\n\nOne of the officers sighed and rummaged in her pockets, "Let me read one of the tips for you." She pulled out a piece of paper and unfurled it, "Here we are: 'Moonspeaker Hard Term has been preaching about the importance of harmony in his sermons. I thought that was something that Celestia preached...' so on and so forth. We ignored the first note or two that we received on this matter as you are one of the Nightmare's chosen few, but we've had several more than that since."\n\nThe zebra sighed and hung his head, having known that something like this would happen eventually. A long silenced passed and then he nodded slowly.\n\n"Yes, I did. I am aware that doing so is a punishable offence, but I fundamentally disagree with the Tsaritsa's new codified form of our faith.""

tobuck_alesia.16.d:0 "Hard Term sat, along with several other ponies, bat ponies and zebras, at a table each in a room as though they were schoolfillies. Frankly it was humiliating, having to 're-learn' a faith that they had all spent their lives studying. None of them wanted to be here, but they wouldn't be allowed out unless they proved themselves faithful to the tenets of the Tsaritsa's preferred form of Nightmare worship.\n\nThe door to the large cell-turned-classroom opened and another Moonspeaker walked in, flanked by a few members of the Druzhina. "Right then. You all know why you're here and so do I, but I make no exceptions on the basis of mutual understanding. At this moment in time, every single one of you is a heretic; but Her Majesty, in her infinite wisdom, has granted you all a unique opportunity. Given that you're all here, you've also elected to take said opportunity over rotting in a cell."\n\nUnsurprisingly, none of them responded. Their 'teacher' sighed and trotted over to a blackboard, reaching for some chalk.\n\n"So let's start from the very top, Tsaritsa Alesia has demanded that first and foremost our law of worship must be codified and authority over the faith centralised so that...""

tobuck_alesia.17.d:0 "What a cathedral it was for such an anticipated sermon as this, brand new and beautiful; even with its size the crowd dwarfed the seating capacity and sprawled outside. Lunar Hail had experienced a mix of emotions following the failed invasion of Tobuck; quiet distress had rapidly turned into a renewed vigour once Alesia had accepted their proposal. Now she served the Nightmare and another of her ordained servants, the Tsaritsa of Novaya Severyana.\n\n"Oh most holy Nightmare above, make me a pony of prayer and use me to bless this congregation with my life. Pour out the essence of the night upon me and give me strength. Nightmare, please rebuke the sun and its false idol that wills to keep us in bondage. Give us victory over the unfaithful through the power of the eternal moon,"\n\nShe didn't bother looking up, knowing that the attendees both inside and outside of the cathedral would have their heads bowed as her voice boomed through loudspeakers. Lunar merely needed a moment to breathe before continuing.\n\n"Bless our Tsaritsa, our priests, our teachers and the faithful across the world with your divine protection. May the united voice of your people rise up to the moon itself in a mighty chorus of praise!"\n\nThousands of voices chanted back, "Nightmare bless the faithful and her chosen."\n\nThe Moonspeaker couldn't help but smile then as she went on, "We believe in one deity, the Nightmare almighty, maker of dreams who for us and for our salvation came down from the moon and shall again return. Almighty Nightmare, our refuge, fountain of wisdom and tower of strength who knows that we can do nothing without her guidance and help; assist us and direct us with divine wisdom and power, so that we may accomplish our ordained duty as your subjects.""

tobuck_alesia.18.d:0 "It felt like a reasonably normal day, just as most days over the last few months had. There was a little tension in the air perhaps, a few things that Dull Blade still wasn't overly comfortable with like the portraits of the Tsaritsa beside those of the Nightmare.\n\nThe Chiropterran bat pony stopped mid-walk and mid-thought to laugh quietly to herself then, realising that she had called Alesia the Tsaritsa without a second thought. Maybe she really was getting used to all that had happened after all. She quickly resumed her trot with a slight smile and found herself on the high street a few minutes later; it was the time of the week for Grocery shopping.\n\nFrankly Dull wasn't used to all this choice. Her Majesty, there it was again, had actually allowed the shops to fully restock for the first time in years. Constant military austerity was, as far as she could tell, a thing of the past. That wasn't to say that the military wasn't big or powerful of course, but something at the top had changed; something that made her life easier.\n\nShe sauntered into one of three food stores in her village and began perusing the isles, finding many other ponies looking as surprised as she felt. The bat pony and seemingly most of her village didn't even recognise most of these new consumables, but they certainly wanted to try them. She shook her mane out of her eyes and added the usual weekly items to her basket before continuing to add several more foods she had never heard of, which was when she finally looked at the prices.\n\nShe spoke out loud in complete shock, "How much cheaper? Surely not; that has to be a misprint doesn't it?"\n\nThe pony closest to her shook his head and grinned,"

Today both the lord and lady commanders would pledge allegiance to her, as would their soldiers. \n\nEmerald Light, Autumn Breeze, Lightning Charm and Stone Palisade and Lucent Eclipse headed their respective columns before her and all began to speak at once and as one.\n\n"I hereby declare, on oath, that I entirely renounce all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or sovereignty of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; that I will support and defend the Tsaritsa and laws of Novaya Severyana against all enemies, foreign and domestic. I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same, I will bear arms on behalf of the Novaya Severyana when required by law and I will perform all my duties within the armed forces of Her Majesty and the Nightmare to the very best of my ability. Long live the Tsaritsa, blessed by our most holy deity. Long may she reign and command our legions with her ordained wisdom; so help me Nightmare."\n\nEvery creature, their numbers in the thousands, bowed before their new monarch.

Given your drafted plans to create an imperial army, their role within the armed forces will be a radical departure from traditional Chiropterran doctrine. They will work in conjunction with the primary bulk of soldiers as a shock force or vanguard as the situation requires."\n\nLightning Charm was more than happy to finally get her chance to reform the legions, as much would have been clear even if she hadn't specifically requested it. She had an odd look of elation on her face despite the generally stoic demeanour that she and the other lord and lady commanders usually wore. Alesia was quite excited herself, considering she hadn't yet had the opportunity to witness the legions in a setting where they weren't shooting at her.\n\nThere were somewhere between sixty and eighty creatures on the training field, performing a variety of exercises. Apparently these were new recruits, though she wouldn't have been able to tell. Their discipline was already seemingly unbreakable despite the fact that they had reportedly only been in the recruitment pipeline for a few weeks at this point. Their drill instructor spotted the observing pair and ordered a quick change to sparring, which looked more like each pair was actively trying to kill one another rather than training. Their speed and skill with anything from blades and small arms to hooves and wings was incredible.\n\nLightning looked up from her clipboard,"Will that be all, Warmistress?""

She laughed, shook it off and the pair embraced for a moment before she cleaned her face and returned to her household chores, taking extra care when dusting off the Tsaritsa's portrait. It was still quite strange to her that, over a period of a few weeks, her friends and family had started referring to Alesia like that; but it was becoming slowly familiar.\n\n"What is my darling Zaaef doing back at the house at this hour?" She mused aloud, fishing for a particular response.\n\nHe was already pouring two glasses of wine as he spoke, "Well I asked for a half-day's leave from the factory so that I could take you out this evening; it's our anniversary tonight, after all."\n\nThat got the desired reaction.\n\n"Well you'd best get washed and changed, hadn't you?

Normally he would have been curled up, careful not to damage any of his wares that were typically stacked up around him. He hadn't been totally cleaned out in his most recent visit to the new imperial capital, but the space around him was proof enough that he'd sold a lot more than usual. In fact, most of the remaining weight back here were goods that the stallion had purchased himself.\n\nHe hadn't earned this much in a day for more than a decade.\n\nYet, in spite of this payday, Silk was conflicted. He was a Warzenan zebra, not a Tobuckian and certainly not a Severyanian one. His new overlords were zealous, proud, disciplined and traditional; but they had also brought stability and revitalised both the import and export market that he needed to survive.\n\nReally though, when he thought about it, he had already taken a side. By not opposing the new status quo and profiting from it he had effectively resigned himself to service of Warzena's enemies by default.\n\nThe zebra grunted and turned on his pillow, trying not to think about it."

tobuck_alesia.24.d:0 "'HALT!' bellowed the feldfebel. 'Aten-SHUN!' Initially, upon being assigned command of a company of fresh troops for the Tsaritsa's Yasani Guard, he was insulted, thinking them little more than bullies and paramilitary thugs, hardly befitting a seasoned Severyanian exile officer such as himself. So far, however, they had exceeded his expectations. His little platoon of zebras was excellently well turned-out in their dark uniforms. The feldfebel was still amazed that they could possibly stand the heat in all black. Then again, they were Zarantian zebras, natives to these arid climes, and he wasn't. He was very supportive of their retention of the sword as a weapon alongside the rifle, feeling it preserved some shred of honour. The old colt admired a warrior who had the courage to wield one on a modern battlefield.\n\nThe troops had now formed into two files. They were in the front room of the local army headquarters, and several bureaucrats and top brass officers were peering from their offices down the hall towards them, to see what the noise was about. On the wall in front of the squad was a newly-installed painting of Her Imperial Majesty, the Tsaritsa. The feldfebel roared 'Left FACE!', quickly followed by 'Pre-sent ARMS!' and it was done in under a second. 'At my command, you will salute your Tsaritsa and pledge loyalty to her as long as you may live! Sa-LUTE!' The platoon roared back, in their strongly accented voices; 'WE SALUTE YOUR IMPERIAL MAJESTY, AND PLEDGE TO SERVE YOU UNTO DEATH!'\n\nAs they did, the underofficer dipped the colours and the feldfebel saluted with his sabre, following along with the salute and oath. As the echo from the hallway faded the feldfebel shouted,'Right then! Shoulder arms! Left face! By the left, quick march!' The platoon marched off, their hooves kicking characteristically high as they stepped. The feldfebel looked smugly at the desk workers withdrawing their heads back into their offices like snails into their shells. They were stuck here all day, pen-pushing and paper-stacking, yet he had the privilege to put his life on the line for Tsaritsa and company. He looked back to the marching zebras and thought; THOSE are the warriors I would choose on that day, the desk-dwellers can keep their comfortable cubicles." #sirnori

tobuck_alesia.25.d:0 "Alesia sat in a meeting where a fierce argument raged over the issue of the labourers, with the table divided between Chiropterran and Severyanian officials. The former wished to continue the old labour system to its due end, justifying the choice as means to the end of rapid industrial reconstruction and frequently pointed out that freed labourers could become a potential security risk. The Severyans argued that even a short-term reliance on slavery would hinder the economic growth across the tsardom, especially as Tobuck continues to industrialize. In the end she slammed her hoof onto the convention table to call on a silence for a decision, tired of the endless bickering that seemed to follow her wherever she went.\n\n"I have no fondness for either the reality or idea of indentured servitude; even Old Severyana, flawed as it may have been, had no need nor want of slaves. However, it is true that the institution could serve as a slingshot into future prosperity should it last a little longer."

Though some historians asses the original Severyana as imperfect in a number of ways, the chaos and confusion caused by Steel Stallion and his comrades undeniably caused more economic, cultural and social damage than their communist ideals can hope to fix. Their revolution was brutal, unnecessary and has resulted in a factionalist government far more unstable than the one it sought to replace."\n\nHis teacher smiled and nodded before continuing, "Thank you Egor. We also noted that Alesia and her government have rectified or simply avoided all of the mistakes that our ancestors made, which is covered in our textbook as part of the next topic 'Lessons Learned' if you wish to read ahead."\n\nA few nodded, acknowledging what was to be a homework task for them. Lebedintseva was a strict teacher with that sort of thing, but she got you the grades you needed.\n\nShe cleared her throat and lifted her own copy of the text, "Now, today's lesson will focus on another reason as to why the homeland fell to ruin.

She might even have been the same painter, though there was no way to know for sure.\n\n"Enamoured, sir?" The old artist joked, dragging the stallion out of his stupor.\n\nThe noble cleared his throat before speaking again in a more serious tone, "I must admit that I am. I would like to sponsor your work, missus...?"\n\n"Ivanova, sir. Anzhelina Ivanova. I would be honoured to work for you and the Tsaritsa." She answered, bowing to the appropriate depth despite her age.\n\nHe spent the next half an hour engrossed in her other works, ignoring the noise of the hall. Like many others ponies here that had escaped the lost homeland she had either produced some form of fine art for nobility before the revolution or was capable of emulating it. At the behest of the Tsaritsa all creative types that could prove themselves capable were to find themselves patronage and work for a number of years; creating new masterworks to revitalise the old Severyanian traditions of painting, sculpting, architecture and more."

This was a concept he supported in and of itself, but he hadn't quite prepared himself for the realities of the lowly and destitute.\n\nThe still-young noble had to watch silently as old, ill, disfigured and truly hurt ponies and zebras of all ages entered through the front door of the venue wearing tattered rags. He quickly got used to their awful smell the longer he served them food and acclimatised to the lack of respect as he took them to their beds. He knew now just how lucky he was to be born into his position and why the tsaritsa had demanded these measures. They ate as though they had never before eaten, slept as though they never had a bed and moved as though every part of their body was turning to dust.\n\nSeeing what he had seen, knowing what he knew now, he would never again neglect his duty to even the most detestable of Severyanian society.

She was a noble and the Tsaritsa along with her personal security detail at the gate would protect her from this rabble of miserable wretches. Who were they to tell her how much she should pay and how much she should charge?\n\nJust as she had that thought, a familiar noise met her ears. A carriage, assumedly containing a judicial herald, and two trucks which would be carrying their soldiers. She stood up and trotted over to her mansion's front gate with a smug grin. The gaggle of peasants had heard too and the look of defeat on their faces was already present; now they would finally leave her in peace.\n\nWhen the carriage and its vehicular procession arrived, the herald and his soldiers exited quickly to meet both the now demoralised peasants and Serafina who had decided to greet them; thinking that she had already won.\n\nHowever, instead of exchanging pleasantries, the judicial herald cleared his throat and spoke; flanked by armed soldiers. "In the case brought to us by Lady Nikolaeya, the local judge and court has reached a verdict: Lady Nikoloaeya, you are found guilty of charging exploitative rent prices and underpaying your labour force. According to Her Majesty's decree, you must reimburse said labour force for the equivalent of six months' rent and double the salaries of these fine citizens."\n\nUtter shock followed on both sides. Then the crowd erupted into cheers as the noblepony exploded with rage, hurling insults and threats at the herald until his entourage levelled their guns at her.\n\n"Madame, are you protesting the perfect law of Her Majesty and the Nightmare?"

My name is Pyotr Luchnikov; here, I have a gift for you."\n\nIn spite of the restrictions on weapons he had brought in a sword, likely by hiding it underneath his greatcoat in some way. The guards around them were already rushing to arrest him as he presented his weapon to the Tsaritsa, unsheathing it and offering the weapon as a gesture of fidelity. Before they could grab him, Alesia held up a hoof and ordered them to wait; even allowing herself to laugh at the absurdity of what he had just done.\n\nShe took the weapon, inspected it, sheathed it and then passed it back. "Your offer is kind and accepted, however I must ask why you decided to completely ignore our rule of no arms on the premises; was it in your interests to be arrested?"\n\n"I am of the opinion that such a rule is entirely unnecessary. Why should I, or any of your other loyal subjects for that matter, raise my weapon at my liege?"

"Not much of the bad bits, but yes; a little. It's been a long time since we were young lovers running through the streets Koloda, time has flown by."\n\nHe laughed loudly and practically threw himself onto a garden cushion, next to the lunch that his wife had just put on the garden table. They both sighed and stared at the Novaya Severyanian flag that he, in his patriotism, had attached to the back of the vehicle.\n\nThe pegasus mare chuckled and sat down next to him as he began to eat, savouring the taste of the food that had been made with their own crops along with some flowers that she had bought as a special treat. They had been relatively rich peasant famers in Equus, but was a far better that life had ever been in spite of the occupational similarities. The opportunity for a better life had called them here, now they were reaping the rewards of that making the right choices in that fateful time in their lives.\n\n"This is definitely better.

There was no reason to punish a servant for this, they were still getting used to the new way of doing things after all. Much like herself, really. She still wasn't used to hearing the already-present cheers from the crowd in the palace grounds, she still wasn't used to being treated like royalty and she certainly still wasn't used to being treated like some sort of holy messenger from the Nightmare. But, as time went on, she felt more at home here as a ruler and a guiding figure. It was hard, but it was rewarding.\n\nThere was much to do yet, eradicating communism and securing her borders in a more permanent fashion were the two things that sprung to mind immediately. For today however, those goals could wait. For today, she could enjoy herself.\n\n"Your Highness, we're finished."

It was the only way forward, a rule ordained by a Goddess she wasn't even faithful to.\n\nAlesia sighed and nodded, "I accept your blessing.""

tobuck_alesia.37.t:0 "A Nation On Two Continents"
tobuck_alesia.37.d:0 "With all the great successes of the Tsaritsa, one question remains. Shall our great state retain the current centre of administration in Snezhnograd, or return in full to the original capital in Princessyn?\n\nWhilst it may initially seem like an obvious choice, many years have been spent developing and industrialising our Zebrican territories. That alongside the inherent difficulties of moving the entire administration to a different continent over vast nautical distances makes the prospect similarly less inviting. However, it would likewise be remiss of the Tsaritsa and nobility not to truly restore Severyana to its prior glory.\n\nIt is a question of practicality against ideological obligation, and one that must be answered."
tobuck_alesia.37.a:0 "We must restore Princessyn, as we have restored Severyana."
tobuck_alesia.37.b:0 "Snezhnograd is a national symbol, we will not abandon it!"

tobuck_alesia.38.t:0 "An Intercontinental Homecoming"
tobuck_alesia.38.d:0 "Sitting in the car and waiting to arrive, she could only hope that it would be worth it. Persuading the remnants of her family to travel to an entirely new continent had been no easy task, especially as it had seemed to them to merely be trading one kind of exile for another. But, after a long and arduous discussion over telegrams and letters, her aunt and brother had eventually agreed to at least stay for a while.\n\nThe car slowed to a stop, Alesia thanked her chauffeur and trotted the last few metres until the docks. Soldiers had been sparsely placed around, though she was in little danger here in Firstport. After all, the Chiropterrans loved her.\n\nAs she descended a ramp with two guards from the gate following in tow the earth pony rested her eyes on the ship in which her family must have just arrived. It certainly wasn't a grand entrance, but then she couldn't expect the exiles to buy much better than the converted Severyanian destroyer they had brought. She would have taken a moment to compose herself properly, if it weren't for the fact that she had just seen the new arrivals on the docks.\n\nThe Tsaritsa smiled and made quick pace, noticed first by her aunt who bowed low as would be appropriate for such royalty.\n\n"Your majesty." She said simply as her niece returned the gesture in kind.\n\nHer brother, young and simply happy to see her, immediately dashed over for a hug. "Alesia! Oh it's been so long... Aunt Karina and I were just talking about you."\n\n"And about what the correct etiquette for greeting royalty was, Maksim." The middle-aged mare added pointedly.\n\nThe monarch simply chuckled, "Manners can come after we get you two settled.""
tobuck_alesia.38.a:0 "It was good to see family again."

tobuck_alesia.39.t:0 "Karina's Faith"
tobuck_alesia.39.d:0 ""It was very kind of you to come and visit your highness, but I'm sure you have more important matters to attend to than your ageing aunt."\n\nKarina did have somewhat of a point there, she definitely did have more pressing things to be doing, but it had been a very long time since she had last seen her family. This was the least the Tsaritsa could do to make up for lost time.\n\nAlesia took a sip of tea from her porcelain cup and smiled, "I do have things to be doing, but that doesn't mean I can ignore the head of the family. Even if I hadn't any obligation to visit you I think it more than appropriate to ensure that you feel comfortable in your lodgings. I don't suppose you've attended any sermons, have you?"\n\n"Actually, I have." she quickly corrected, no longer afraid to admit her ardent belief in the Nightmare. "It's not what I was expecting."\n\nThe monarch raised an inquisitive eyebrow and took another sip, simply waiting for her aunt to elaborate on the subject. She was very much aware of the mare's leanings and needed to do very little in order to encourage her.\n\nWith a contemplative frown, Karina nodded. "Yes, it was quite something; especially being so used to our typically private worship in Equestria. The thestrals certainly know what they're doing."\n\n"And will you attend again?" Alesia asked, curious more than anything else.\n\n"I think I shall. I suppose you've been visiting the temples all the time with such freedom, haven't you? Perhaps your brother and I should have come sooner." She admitted with a slight scoff at herself."
tobuck_alesia.39.a:0 "'All the time' was quite an assumption..."

tobuck_alesia.40.t:0 "Maksim's Feelings"
tobuck_alesia.40.d:0 "The siblings sat at the dinner table playing poker, their meals long since finished and the cutlery and crockery whisked away by a servant. They had both missed nights like these, simply enjoying one another's company with a deck of cards and chatting as they tried to figure out if their opponent was bluffing. It made for a good challenge.\n\n"Karina seems to really love this place y'know. Says it gives her nostalgia for the old days before the reds came along." He gave out whilst dealing.\n\nAlesia chuckled, "Not surprising really, it's starting to look a lot more like home over here. What do you think about my glorious Novaya Severyana?" She asked, deliberately emphasising her final words for a laugh.\n\n"I raise." Maksim said first, pushing in some makeshift chips after observing the flop. "Well, it's... Interesting. I'm not sure if I feel comfortable living here with so many... Well, you know; fanatics, I guess. They're all really into this whole Nightmare thing and... Well, I suppose I'm kinda like you actually. I don't really know where I stand, but I don't think it's with them."\n\nShe nodded and put even more 'chips' in herself, "I raise. Well, nopony's going to confront you about it; especially not with me around to make doubly sure nothing happens. You can always go home if you like."\n\n"I don't know yet. Maybe I could get used to it, and spending time with you again is... really nice. Mmm..." He spent a moment thinking, face almost completely emotionless at the turn. "I raise."\n\nThe Tsaritsa tilted her head. "I check."\n\n"Oh? Hmm. I raise." He added after revealing the river.\n\n"I raise."\n\n"There's no chance you beat a straight flush, surely?""
tobuck_alesia.40.a:0 ""Sorry Maks, royal flush.""

tobuck_alesia.41.t:0 "A Tool Of Order And Joy"
tobuck_alesia.41.d:0 "The Tsaritsa sighed as she inspected another business census, pouring over the details regarding the number of Labourers that were being hired by various companies. It was far too soon to be celebrating an end to that awful system of chattel slavery in its entirety, but she had noticed that the numbers of Labourers across the various private holdings of both wealthy families and companies alike were staying markedly consistent. At the very least, the practice would die out over time.\n\nHaving sated her desire to ensure that things were proceeding as planned, the earth pony rose from her desk and sauntered over to one of the windows in the temporary accommodation she had been provided in New Ayacachtli before she could move into a new palace; opening it to breathe the pleasant night air. Her mind had once again wandered onto the topic of Nightmare worship, a question which continuously arose to be answered but never received an answer.\n\nIt was times like these - when dealing with the seemingly inherent societal backwardness of the state she had inherited - in which she simply couldn't see the Nightmare as anything besides a tool. At the top it was easy to look down and see-\n\n"Here we are sweetie, home sweet home." The gruff voice of an overworked city stallion chimed out from below her.\n\nAlesia looked down from the window she was leaning out of and spotted them: a particularly rough looking steel worker and his filly sauntering home after an evening at the city theatre. Just as he was going to unlock the door to his apartment, he turned around and put the filly on his shoulders before carrying her into the middle of the empty road with a warm smile.\n\n"There's the moon, see? The Nightmare is gonna make sure you have good dreams tonight, I prayed for it and everything." He added with a warm smile\n\nThe little pony on his back giggled and wrapped her hooves around his neck, comforted by the sight of the moon. "Thanks papa.""
tobuck_alesia.41.a:0 "For all it's failings, the faith still brought joy to many."

tobuck_alesia.42.t:0 "The Will Of The Masses"
tobuck_alesia.42.d:0 "Flanked by several guards, Alesia was having some 'alone' time by indulging in a trot through the countryside; simply enjoying the colours produced by the setting sun. It wasn't often that she forfeited an afternoon to simply walking, especially considering the many reforms that she was implementing, but there was no cure for stress and mild writer's cramp from paperwork quite like a good trot.\n\nAlready the moon had emerged from the horizon and was looming over the landscape as the late hour slowly turned from afternoon into evening. It had been a long time since the Tsaritsa had been on a stroll approaching night time like this, mostly because it was something her parents enjoyed. Moonlight was, unsurprisingly, their thing.\n\nAfter a few moments she approached a bench, ordered her small security detail to give her some space and sat to take in the view.\n\nDown in the small valley below, a village had begun to celebrate some local festival that they occasionally held; reaching the Tsaritsa with the noise of their merriment and celebration. How could a village made up largely of poor farmers waste so much money and time with events like this?\n\nShe sighed and looked up at the moon, letting her thoughts drift back to the Nightmare once more. For most of her adult life, she had made use of her will to seek out the restoration of what she and many others had lost; to get her home back. Now, sitting and watching over this underdeveloped village, something clicked. Though she didn't quite understand it, was it not the will of her people to give much of what they had in service to her and to their object of worship? Was she - in her duty and her hard work - not deserving of the same praise that they gave to her? It was their will to celebrate what they had been given, both by the Tsaritsa and the Nightmare, and who was she to deny herself?"
tobuck_alesia.42.a:0 "Their will to worship left them poor, but happy."

tobuck_alesia.43.t:0 "The Authority Of The Tsaritsa"
tobuck_alesia.43.d:0 ""My good stallion, this land was sold to my family decades ago-"\n\nThe noblemare had barely explained her position before an old officer stallion went to retort, "Using their favours in the military to ruin the land with unscheduled training exercises to force down the price! It was not a sale, it was extortion; something that is very clearly criminal!"\n\nThe Tsaritsa watched with a look of utter disinterest plastered across her face as they bickered. It seemed that even a modern court of nobles was not immune to petty squabbles such as this, though such was hardly a surprise given that republics like Tobuck had been no better.\n\nJust as other members of the royal court in the assembly began to join the argument, she raised a hoof and brought complete silence to the room in an instant. "I wish to hear no more of this. You will come to a compromise now or this little farce of a disagreement will go no further."\n\nNeedless to say, they came quickly to an agreement on a relatively small but not utterly insignificant settlement fee. Shortly afterwards the council was adjourned and Her Majesty received many respectful bows as she left the hall. Once again the hour was late and the moon was high in the sky, beaming light through the windows of the new imperial palace.\n\nStopping for just a moment, Alesia thought about why it was that she was shown such respect as she was; even when her decisions might have seemed relatively arbitrary. Though they may have been more of a junta than a true civilian government in the past, the Nightmare's warmasters and her faith had instilled this sense of duty to and respect of authority in her subjects for centuries. Something that had not been achieved totally in Severyana had been taught easily by their adherence to social conduct instilled in them by the faith, warped and backward as some of their tenets may have once been.\n\nAt that realisation, she smiled to herself and continued sauntering along."
tobuck_alesia.43.a:0 "Her authority came from the Nightmare, at least to them."

tobuck_alesia.44.t:0 "The Honour Of The Few"
tobuck_alesia.44.d:0 "These days it was rather uncommon for Her Majesty to spend time with the old warmasters of Chiropterra, if only because their titles had become a little less significant over time thanks to her reforms. All the same, she felt that it was important to show her appreciation for the individuals that had assented to her ascent and allowed for an easy transition of power.\n\nOut of the original collection, Lucent Eclipse was the only new member of the group; though he always came with news of how his grandfather was doing for the rest of them.\n\n"...and needless to say that his colleagues in the LMRD were far from impressed. I had that sycophant fired the next day once I realised just how deep the burrow of malpractice went. Can you believe that he stockpiled additional prisoners in a lab 'just in case' he ever needed a steady supply of test subjects?" Emerald Light asked rhetorically, overflowing with indignation at a thestral that had long been her assistant.\n\nOut of all of them, Lightning Charm seemed the least surprised as he sipped at his tea. "Given what I have heard of that maniac I admit that I'm not entirely shocked; there were a great many stories circulating about him. His behaviour is nevertheless despicable."\n\nThough Alesia sensed just a little dramatisation in the retelling of the story - something fairly unusual for Emerald - she simply let it be and enjoyed her company. They had all become rather good friends over the course of various meetings like this, not least for their likeness in mindset.\n\nLike her they held great value in the importance of honour, which was why they had surrendered in service of the Nightmare when under all other circumstances they would have fought on. It was surprising just how much the Chiropterran way of life resembled her personal tenets on occasion, the only difference was that she was now honourable in service of the Nightmare as an extension of her own behaviour. A quiet scoff and a nod at that thought drew the eyes of Stone Palisade with whom she shared a look and a smile."
tobuck_alesia.44.a:0 "Her honour was her own, but one could easily have assumed otherwise."

tobuck_alesia.45.t:0 "A Conclusion Of Inconclusivity"
tobuck_alesia.45.d:0 "Though it was difficult to find the time these days, the Tsaritsa seemed to always be able to make some when it came to quiet evenings alone in the palace. In such a room she sat, in an armchair and occasionally sipping at a glass of wine and bathing in the moonlight that was coming through the large windows of the chamber. Alesia had been enduring a number of sleepless nights as of late, mostly a symptom of her uncertainty in faith.\n\nTruly the faith her family embraced - or avoided, in the case of her brother Maksim - was the only thing of which she was absolutely uncertain. On the one hoof, her personal tenets in life and in the foundations of [TBK.GetNameDef] were very much reflected in the doctrine of Nightmare worship. Many simply worshipped to make themselves feel safer or to celebrate the security that they knew they had. On the other hoof, it was still a faith of many failings despite the reforms that she had implemented. Lunar Hail was as zealous as ever and the Labourer caste remained prominent, if in a very slow decline.\n\nIn truth, Alesia was scared to choose; picking a side herself was simply an impossible decision for her to make.\n\nAs she stood up to head towards her personal chambers, a cloud covered the bright light of the moon and she stood stock still. A sudden thought had overtaken her:\n\nWhy did she have to choose?\n\nFor years she had debated which side of the family to agree with, whether to listen to Entin and abandon the possibility of placing her faith in the Nightmare or if she should take the plunge into worship. But it was not her responsibility to worship, nor was it her responsibility to be an apostate. She was the Tsaritsa; a beacon of order, authority and Honour in a nation of heretics. She was a balancing force between total zealotry and pragmatism, not a priest or a rebel. She was the sovereign of a state, not a participant in society.\n\nThe duvet almost fell from her flank and shoulders as a wide smile grew across her face."
tobuck_alesia.45.a:0 "It was her duty to remain ambiguous."

tobuck_alesia.46.t:0 "Third Time's The Charm"
tobuck_alesia.46.d:0 "Entin could hardly believe his ears, sat with tea in hoof. "I... Didn't think you wanted me to ask again, after last time. You seemed fairly adamant and I wasn't looking to open any wounds; we haven't spoken a whole lot since then, have we?"\n\nThe Tsaritsa nodded and leaned back in her seat, understanding of his concerns. "Well I told you I would be careful, and I have been. Now you have to ask me how it went, do you not?"\n\nShe seemed so curiously confident in herself, despite the subject matter. The stallion remembered how offput she had been before and wondered just what had transpired in the time since he'd seen her last. All the same, he certainly had been worried sick about his best friend and was not going to pass up such an opportunity as this.\n\n"Well... Are you a worshipper of 'the Nightmare' now or aren't you?" He enquired bluntly.\n\nAlesia looked back at him with a warm smile, setting down her cup and saucer on the table. "Forgive me for answering a question with a question, but why does it matter?"\n\nHe would have retorted with an explanation, but clearly she was going somewhere with this.\n\n"Is it not the duty of the sovereign to dictate on all matters civilian according to their judgement? Is it not the charge of any absolute authority to rule according to what they deem is proper? If both of these things are true, is it not in my interest to remain utterly detached from matters of faith unless ruling on matters of the faith?" She asked, all questions rhetorical and in quick succession.\n\nThe stallion raised an eyebrow, "Are you... Justifying the soverign's ambiguous stance on religion on a basis of practicality?" He then leaned over, dropping his voice to a whisper. " And, for that matter, revealing your own continued agnosticism out of pragmatism?"\n\n"Well, am I ruling well and fairly?" She retorted with her seldom-seen grin."
tobuck_alesia.46.a:0 "And just like that, there was a giddy smile on Entin's face."

### Military events

tobuck_military.1.t:0 "How To Pay Them All?"
tobuck_military.1.d:0 "It was hardly a surprise that the mercenaries were harping on about their pay. Technically speaking they were on the payroll of the state, but Pea Shooter had failed to actually provide any sort of funding. This issue needed resolving as soon as possible, lest the commanders run out of surplus loot to tide over their soldiers with.\n\nTwo ideas had been proposed, one from the troops themselves and another from their generals. The former simply wanted to be paid in regular money as they were having difficulties making use of their spoils of war when trying to buy goods in stores or in sending cash back to their families; their solution was merely to finalise the state contracts and earn their keep that way. Their officers meanwhile had other ideas, instead suggesting that their pay should be granted in the form of shares in state-owned mining companies. That way they could slowly earn more over time as the businesses expanded, leading to a greater eventual payday.\n\nBoth concepts were viable, leaving the decision ultimately up to the administration."

In truth nobody knew quite what to expect, having previously assumed that the other conflicts in which they had fought would have exhausted their military capacity.\n\nThere was one thing which was abundantly clear, however: War was coming."

To do this, he must ensure that the republic remains mostly functional as he earns his keep whilst also keeping an eye on the warlords so that they don't get suspicious and cause his §Rpremature departure§!.\n\nPea Shooter has one year to return Tobuck to Zarantia; this can be done in advance by completing the focus §YGoodbye, And Thanks For the Bits§!.\n\nGreat concern, however, is that the warlords find out about the deal.

Now the only thing left on the agenda is to sell them and, should the stockpile run dry, we can always get a bit creative in wielding the power of a state we plan to give away.\n\nFor Pea Shooter however, it only matters insofar that he can funnel laundered money out of Tobuck altogether. With his family currently out of the way and with knowledge from his prior business ventures in Manehattan, he can't just load a boat full of gold bars and piles of dirty cash and hope that Equestrian customs won't raise an eyebrow.

TBK_iron_will_desc:0 "True to his namesake, Iron Will has escaped the conquest of his homeland without a scratch and with a new vengeance to wreak on those who took away the Minotauria his kind knew and loved. For now, much like Alesia before him, he is more than willing to serve abroad and seek to earn the money required for liberating his home."
TBK_brodfeld_capitalists:0 "Corporate Application C3-E38: Brodfeld Patriot Inc."
TBK_brodfeld_capitalists_desc:0 "Though the President isn't much for allowing competitors to mosey into his town, Brodfeld Patriot Inc. is perhaps one of the last remnants of the homeland he remembers. Not only that, but they're a skilled bunch of griffons that could definitely help run the place too if given half a chance."

TBK_north_river_flooding:0 "Northern Dikes"
TBK_north_river_flooding_desc:0 "Despite the immense destruction that forcing a flood may cause, the aftermath of such a disaster would create the perfect environment in which to engage in defensive guerrilla warfare. Swamps galore and river crossings everywhere, all to keep the hostile forces at bay."
TBK_blow_dikes:0 "Blow the Dikes"
TBK_blow_dikes_desc:0 "The time has come to destroy hoofmade infrastructure for the survival of the nation in the long term. We can always drain the newly created swamps later if the land is truly needed, but for now the armed forces must do a little damage in order to mount a formidable defence."

### Ideas ###

TBK_fake_republic:0 "The Fake Republic"
TBK_fake_republic_desc:0 "Tobuck! A free, modern and sovereign republic! The only issue is that no Tobuckian actually wanted one. Or rather, the few who did want one certainly didn't want some gun runner to run it. In a land that happily thrived under a monarchy, the announcement of the republic landed like a cannonball shot with not enough gunpowder: making a big "thud" in the mud.\n\nIn the end, nopony was really fooled by the proclamation of the republic, even the Hippogriffian and Maregyptian ambassadors who were still happy to give lip service to the idea that Chiropterra, Warzena and Zarantia ought to think twice about moving in. But bits help smooth things over and a fake republic has a way of streamlining government decision."

TBK_warlord_reliance:0 "Warlord Reliance"
TBK_warlord_reliance_desc:0 "When Tobuck proclaimed its independence, it had no army, just mercenaries, a lot of guns and some bits. With their charm, Pea Shooter and Vasile cel Tradat managed to convinced a few promising adventurer and costly friends to set up their own forces. Each was given a provincial governorate to make their job of defending the country easier and while it did provide an effective defending forces, there might be some issues in relying on warlords."

TBK_zarantian_loyalism:0 "Zarantian Loyalism"
TBK_zarantian_loyalism_desc:0 "A former Warzenan province, Tobuck soured on its historical master for many a reason. And so, when the Queen of the Desert came and liberated them, they embraced her as their saviour. It proved a successful choice as the Zarantians wished for a richer region to use as their centre of power. The Storm King brought an end to the promising future of the Kingdom of Zarantia and Tobuck had its fate decided for it by a clique of 'innovative businesscreatures', as they call themselves. In the end, it's not hard to understand why the merchants and citizens of Tobuck have a nostalgia for the Zebra Queen of the east; and should Mekiouzza come for them, they will help her."

TBK_home_act:0 "The Home Act"
TBK_home_act_desc:0 "The republic is nothing if not cooperative, especially regarding the Zarantians. It's only fair, and practical of course, that we have allowed for the free movement of peoples over the Tobuckian-Zarantian border; with a little luck, this should keep the tribes off of our backs for a while longer too."

TBK_republic_guard:0 "Guard Security Operations"
TBK_republic_guard_desc:0 "If the events of the past few months have proven anything, it's that allowing the national guard jurisdiction over the movement of peoples was a fantastic idea. We must keep the Zarantian intellectuals in the city, and of course make sure that the warlords remain blissfully ignorant for a little longer."

TBK_spy_warlords:0 "Ears Amongs the Bands"
TBK_spy_warlords_desc:0 "Trying to get coherent information out of warlords is a notoriously difficult affair, one which isn't really worth the effort when they all have their own aims. Instead we have dispersed a number of individuals amongst the rank and file of the warlord bands in the hopes that we can spread misinformation and add to the confusion just a little more."

### Vasile ideas

#Duplicate
#TBK_warlord_anarchy:0 "Warlord Bands"
TBK_warlord_anarchy_desc:0 "When Tobuck proclaimed its independence, it had no army, just mercenaries, a lot of guns and some bits. With their charm, Pea Shooter and Vasile cel Tradat managed to convinced a few promising adventurer and costly friends to set up their own forces. Each was given a provincial governorate to male their job of defending the country easier. And while it did provide an effective defending forces, there might be some issues in relying on warlords.\n\nThe recent chaos following Pea Shooter's disappearance has broken all trust between the warlords and central government, leading to total anarchy within the countryside."

TBK_debt:0 "National Debt"
TBK_debt_desc:0 "Pea Shooter managed to accrue a considerable national debt in his efforts to make himself a fortune and subsequently has left the republic in a state of economic crisis. Though others might have had the opportunity to default on such debt if they had risen to prominence, keeping the republic alive means repaying its loans in a legitimate fashion is an unfortunate necessity."

TBK_took_loans:0 "Repaying Loans"
TBK_took_loans_desc:0 "If there's one thing that solves a budget crisis based on debt, it's politely begging for new low-interest loans with which to pay off the previous ones that have become problematic. Needless to say that this will require some considerable schmoozing on the part of Vasile, but the new President is nothing if not suave and skilled in that department."

TBK_took_cuts:0 "Underfunded State"
TBK_took_cuts_desc:0 "If there's one thing that solves a budget crisis, it's a period of national austerity to make sure that we can earn the money to relieve ourselves of the burgeoning debt. Sure the state bureaucracy might suffer a little from doing it this way, but it's the simplest and fastest way to do things without additional complications. We'll just have to live with the pain, for now."

TBK_amended_republic:0 "The Fake Republic"
TBK_amended_republic_desc:0 "Tobuck! A free, modern and sovereign republic! The only issue is that no Tobuckian actually wanted one. Or rather, the few who did want one certainly didn't want some gun runner to run it. In a land that happily thrived under a monarchy, the announcement of the republic landed like a cannonball shot with not enough gunpowder: making a big "thud" in the mud.\n\nIn the end, nopony was really fooled by the proclamation of the republic, even the Hippogriffian and Maregyptian ambassadors who were still happy to give lip service to the idea that Chiropterra, Warzena and Zarantia ought to think twice about moving in. But bits help smooth things over and a fake republic has a way of streamlining government decision.\n\nRecent elections have generally been received well by the public, but animosity remains as the readily apparent government corruption is yet to be addressed. Vasile has the nation's best interests at heart, right?"

### Legimate Republic ideas

TBK_republic_law:0 "Reformed Laws"
TBK_republic_law_desc:0 "If there's one thing the executive is good for, it's getting things done and quickly. Vasile's reforms have streamlined the bureaucracy of the government to no end and he has even included provisions for tribal landlords in the government papers. It is perhaps of slight concern that the reforms also grant him additional powers, but who cares? Everyone loves the President!"

TBK_prison_industries:0 "Reformed Laws"
TBK_prison_industries_desc:0 "If there's one thing the executive is good for, it's getting things done and quickly. Vasile's reforms have streamlined the bureaucracy of the government to no end and he has even included provisions for tribal landlords in the government papers. The prison labour system that he's put in place is also of particular note as it generates money for the administration and keeps taxes low for the people! It is perhaps of slight concern that the reforms also grant him additional powers, but who cares? Everyone loves the President!"

TBK_false_corruption_charges:0 "Reformed Laws"
TBK_false_corruption_charges_desc:0 "If there's one thing the executive is good for, it's getting things done and quickly. Vasile's reforms have streamlined the bureaucracy of the government to no end and he has even included provisions for tribal landlords in the government papers. The recent addition of anti-corruption laws to the legal system has also made the state far more reliable, both for the citizenry and the President alike. It is perhaps of slight concern that the reforms also grant him additional powers, but who cares? Everyone loves Vasile!"

TBK_three_reforms_scheme:0 "The Three Reforms"
TBK_three_reforms_scheme_desc:0 "The three reforms are as follows: Populism, prosperity and nationalism. Needless to say that the policy, as with all other things implemented by the beloved President, have gone down swimmingly and the entire nation has begun to abide by these reforms as tenets. The republic shall be great! It shall be rich! It shall thrive under the guiding claws of the President!"

TBK_three_reforms_scheme_expanded:0 "The Three Reforms"

Needless to say that the policy, as with all other things implemented by the beloved President, have gone down swimmingly and the entire nation has begun to abide by these reforms as tenets. The republic shall be great! It shall be rich! It shall thrive under the guiding claws of the President!"

TBK_three_reforms_scheme_final:0 "The Three Reforms"
TBK_three_reforms_scheme_final_desc:0 "The three reforms are as follows: Populism, prosperity and nationalism. Needless to say that the policy, as with all other things implemented by the beloved President, have gone down swimmingly and the entire nation has begun to abide by these reforms as tenets. The republic shall be great! It shall be rich! It shall thrive under the guiding claws of the President!"

TBK_diplomacy_vasile:0 "Cognac-Cigar Diplomacy"
TBK_diplomacy_vasile_desc:0 "Diplomacy more complex than 'we have an alliance' or 'we are going to war' is often overlooked by the secondary powers of the world. A leader has to be smart and tread carefully, they have to know where to invest and who to work with; they have to understand economics as well as mere politics. Luckily for the citizenry of Tobuck, Vasile is rather skilled at doing both."

TBK_actual_congress:0 "National Congress"
TBK_actual_congress_desc:0 "Under Pea Shooter, the national congress was nothing more than a sham organisation that never met and had little influence in state affairs. Vasile, being the cordial and proper President that he is, has institutionalised the congress in an effort to please the Harmonic Front and to cooperate with the political outliers of the nation on a more significant level."

TBK_actual_congress_expanded:0 "National Congress"
TBK_actual_congress_expanded_desc:0 "Under Pea Shooter, the national congress was nothing more than a sham organisation that never met and had little influence in state affairs. Vasile, being the cordial and proper President that he is, has institutionalised the congress in an effort to please the Harmonic Front and to cooperate with the political outliers of the nation on a more significant level."

TBK_campaign_ads:0 "Congressional Election Fuzz"
TBK_campaign_ads_desc:0 "Ah, election season. There's nothing quite like the buzz of the people and the excitement on the President's face whenever the elections roll around and it's high time that we invested in a campaign. Sure a lot of folks will just vote for Vasile anyway, but it's the principle that matters right? Besides, Vasile's not one to pass up an opportunity for a good publicity stunt or two."

TBK_welfare_system:0 "Happy Life Decree"
TBK_welfare_system_desc:0 "Though the state remains unable - or as some have said, unwilling - to provide a full welfare state, the Happy Life Decree has certainly provided many with necessary healthcare. It primarily addresses issues with food and quality of life in the underdeveloped parts of the nation, though for the President it's a rather useful tool for his popularity too."

TBK_welfare_system_final:0 "Happy Life Decree"
TBK_welfare_system_final_desc:0 "Though the state remains unable - or as some have said, unwilling - to provide a full welfare state, the Happy Life Decree has certainly provided many with necessary healthcare. It primarily addresses issues with food and quality of life in the underdeveloped parts of the nation, though recent alterations to the function of the organisations surrounding the decree have provided much needed land reforms as well. For the President, it's a rather useful tool for his popularity and a good way to seize unprofitable estates for the government."

TBK_vasile_president_love:0 "Hail To the President!"
TBK_vasile_president_love_desc:0 "Everybody in Tobuck loves the President; they just can't get enough of the old bird, try as they might! Who needs frequent and fair elections when your republic is a beacon of stability and prosperity, led by a talented griffon like Vasile? There's nobody else decent to vote for anyway, so why not give him the power to do what he needs to do? Hail to the President! Long live his republic!"

TBK_vasile_president_love_talons:0 "Hail To the President!"
TBK_vasile_president_love_talons_desc:0 "Everybody in Tobuck loves the President; they just can't get enough of the old bird, try as they might!

TBK_tourism:0 "Come Visit Tobuck!"
TBK_tourism_desc:0 "Tobuck is a place of incredible natural beauty, not least for the stunning bay in which the capital is situated at the very centre of. We have deserts and plains, jungles and rivers, rural and city life as well as whatever else you could think of to tour! Come on down to Tobuck and take a look around, we can promise that you'll love what you find in our little corner of the world!"

TBK_recreational_drugs_idea:0 "Legalized Drugs"
TBK_recreational_drugs_idea_desc:0 "Legalising narcotics was certainly a bold move on the part of the President, but with the right level of state oversight and a little tax on the products there's nothing that could go wrong. Well, unless there was some sort of scheme which made it far too easy to purchase said drugs and get a large amount of the public hooked; but Vasile would never do such a thing. Right?"

TBK_equestrian_industrial_planning:0 "Equestrian Industrial Techniques"
TBK_equestrian_industrial_planning_desc:0 "If there's one Equestrian export that's truly invaluable in this day and age, it's industrial expertise. They have an established set of engineering schools and a considerable industry, making hiring from their surplus of specialists both easy and desirable. Let's just hope that they don't have a heart attack when they come down and see what they have to work with, eh?"

TBK_vasile_banking:0 "Banks of Tobuck"
TBK_vasile_banking_desc:0 "Banking is one of those things that's typically looked down upon by most, at least if done on an international scale as the President plans to do. For some it's because they see banks as money hoarders, for others it's because of the corruption; but ours will entirely be different. The Tobuckian banks will be frowned upon in the years to come because they're secure and perfect for offshore holdings, which is exactly what makes them great!"

TBK_vasile_banking_expanded:0 "Banks of Tobuck"

TBK_national_defence_bill:0 "National Defence Bill"
TBK_national_defence_bill_desc:0 "If there's one thing our republic needs, it's more troops and more military readiness. Fighting off the warlords was tricky and sadly caused many Tobuckian casualties. As such we must be ready for future conflicts. The state has embarked on an enormous propaganda campaign for recruitment whilst the military itself has been instructed to cooperate with the civilian economy in creating new fortifications where prudent."

TBK_national_defence_bill_legimate:0 "National Defence Bill"
TBK_national_defence_bill_legimate_desc:0 "If there's one thing our republic needs, it's more troops and more military readiness. Fighting off the warlords was tricky and sadly caused many Tobuckian casualties. As such we must be ready for future conflicts. The state has embarked on an enormous propaganda campaign for recruitment whilst the military itself has been instructed to cooperate with the civilian economy in creating new fortifications where prudent."

Fighting off the warlords was tricky and sadly caused many Tobuckian casualties. As such we must be ready for future conflicts. The state has embarked on an enormous propaganda campaign for recruitment whilst the military itself has been instructed to cooperate with the civilian economy in creating new fortifications where prudent."

TBK_chiropterra_bonuses:0 "War Against the Legions"
TBK_chiropterra_bonuses_desc:0 "The second war against Chiropterra will be as gruesome as the first. We expect them to have bounced back from their previous defeat by now and that they will likely have mustered a new army that can once again rival our own. Loyal citizens of the republic, we must steel ourselves for war! We must be prepared to sacrifice for victory! We must fight for our freedom!"

TBK_BAT_culled_moonspeakers:0 "Forbidden Moon Cult"
TBK_BAT_culled_moonspeakers_desc:0 "Vasile cel Tradat has mandated that significant restrictions be placed upon the Chiropterran state after its second defeat at the appendages of the republic. The moonspeakers as an organisation have been outlawed and whatever semblance of public worship that 'the Nightmare' previously received has now been suppressed or has moved underground."

TBK_BAT_allow_faith:0 "Maintained Faith"
TBK_BAT_allow_faith_desc:0 "Though a danger to the sovereignty of the republic, Vasile has allowed the faith of Chiropterra to remain socially prominent. The caveat for this is of course that the state must now grant much of its industry to the Tobuckians in reparations for previous conflicts. As with all things Vasile, it is both a positive and a negative arrangement simultaneously."

TBK_BAT_lax_bats:0 "Lax Population"
TBK_BAT_lax_bats_desc:0 "If there's one thing that keeps creatures loyal, it's autonomy and some degree of respect for national sovereignty. Vasile understands this well and has granted Chiropterra the ability to remain mostly under its own supervision, provided that the administration remains loyal and maintains an increased level of trade with their puppetmaster."

TBK_BAT_democracy_idea:0 "Lunar Democracy"
TBK_BAT_democracy_idea_desc:0 "Despite the value of a well-integrated puppet state, there is something to be said for enshrining certain principles in the management of any government. Chiropterra has long struggled with the concept of democracy and, though the Tobuckians are not best known for their democratic tendencies themselves, the reforms are going rather well across the border."

TBK_vasile_president_absolutist:0 "Hail To the President!"
TBK_vasile_president_absolutist_desc:0 "Everybody in Tobuck loves the President; they just can't get enough of the old bird, try as they might! Who needs frequent and fair elections when your republic is a beacon of stability and prosperity, led by a talented griffon like Vasile? There's nobody else decent to vote for anyway, so why not give him the power to do what he needs to do? Hail to the President! Long live his republic!"

TBK_vasile_personality_cult_saved:0 "The Tender Iron Claw"

TBK_democratic_vision_desc:0 "Bringing democracy to a place like Tobuck, and Chiropterra for that matter, is no easy task. In fact, it's probably one of the single hardest things any government has tried to implement around these parts. All the same, these things need to happen in order for Harmony and a truly democratic environment to be achieved."

TBK_harmonic_federation:0 "Balance of Power"
TBK_harmonic_federation_desc:0 "Trying to make things work between two opposed ideals is always hard, but it's not impossible. With a little luck and a little more careful work we can make sure that the balance of power remains and that politics stay fine and dandy. After all, the least we can do for all our revolutionary reforms is attempt not to make a mess in the process."

TBK_repayment:0 "Repayments"
TBK_repayment_desc:0 "Though many see such expenses as frivolous and an insult as most of the money is going to those that just tried to annex our beloved city, the fact remains that we are now a nation of many Chiropterrans as well as Tobuckians. If we wish them to integrate peacefully into our society then we must encourage them to stay and to cooperate with the state."

TBK_open_elections:0 "Campaign Season"
TBK_open_elections_desc:0 "Ah, election campaigns; for once they're not even rigged in favour of the incumbency! It's our duty to make sure every creature in the federation has a say in one way or another; the best way to do that is making sure they know who they can vote for, right?"

TBK_democratic_vision_final:0 "The Constitution of U.L.N.Z"
TBK_democratic_vision_final_desc:0 "Codifying a constitution is an integral part of guaranteeing the rights of citizens as well as ensuring that the functionality of and balance of power within the government cannot simply be overturned. Democratic harmony is a perfect and malleable answer to all future questions, after all."

TBK_ulz_police_lar:0 "National Police Force"
TBK_ulz_police_lar_desc:0 "Tobuck was never a safe place and the military police that Chiropterra relied on in order to keep the peace weren't exactly an enticing organisation to utilise. Harmony is now protected by our loyal police constables and their hard work in keeping the country safe from internal elements of discontent and malpractice."

TBK_ulz_police_lar_final:0 "S.T.D"
TBK_ulz_police_lar_final_desc:0 "Legally an extension of the National Police force, the Special Tactical Directive is an elite government secret service that protects the population and their representatives. Though hardly battle-tested, the STD is nevertheless a powerful fighting force that demonstrates incredible adaptability in the field of national security."

TBK_ulz_police:0 "National Police Force"

TBK_harmonic_federation_final:0 "Harmonic Federation"
TBK_harmonic_federation_final_desc:0 "As it is sometimes said, societies should define the state and the people have now spoken. From the ashes of a sham republic, they have built a harmonious state for a harmonious society of cooperation and reform; the federation as an entity is as much their ally and their protector as it is a beast of their own creation."

TBK_public_works_idea:0 "Federal Public Works"
TBK_public_works_idea_desc:0 "State funded infrastructure projects are the next step in building and expanding on the existing civilian economy within the federation. Our Hazrumenian family will prosper for the benefit of every individual within that very same family. Onwards and upwards, let us cooperate together to strive for a better tomorrow!"

TBK_reconstruction_idea:0 "Federal Construction Bureau"
TBK_reconstruction_idea_desc:0 "There is much to do in the reconstruction and further development of the land and industry following the nigh-cataclysmic war with Chiropterra. We shall build back stronger than before and we are making significant headway in rebuilding what was lost in order to prosper further off of it. The future waits for nopony!"

TBK_ensure_work:0 "Right of Employment"
TBK_ensure_work_desc:0 "Every creature under the purview of the state has a right to education and a right to be gainfully employed. It is the duty of the federation to provide opportunities for those that fall through the cracks, however small they may be, and to ensure that they lead a life worth living."

TBK_vocational_education_system:0 "Vocational Education System"
TBK_vocational_education_system_desc:0 "If there's one thing that students are doing after school these days, it's practical studies and getting work experience. They're acquiring much needed skills and a bigger labour pool is never something to avoid. The state will continue running programmes to make sure they leave education with the knowledge they need to go right into work!"

TBK_research_benefits:0 "Research Benefits"
TBK_research_benefits_desc:0 "If there's one thing that students are doing following their stints in schools these days, it's further education. We'll always need more forward-thinking innovators to propel the federation into a new age and the state makes sure that every student knows that they have every opportunity to contribute to science so long as they live!"

TBK_free_market_economics:0 "The Invisible Hoof"
TBK_free_market_economics_desc:0 "Though the state keeps an eye on things, the economy always has the guiding hoof of the free market to sort out even the most troubling of situations. Supply and demand trumps all other factors when considering the economy and so every citizen of the federation knows how to encourage further national prosperity."

TBK_expanded_agricultural_sector:0 "Agriculture Boon"
TBK_expanded_agricultural_sector_desc:0 "Agriculture has long been the foundation for every civilisation and the federation has embraced such. In every arable region a visitor will see sprawling fields of farms that cover the land in a variety of foodstuff and cash crops, underpinning the federal economy with exports and food autarky in the case of conflict or diplomatic isolation."

TBK_new_bit:0 "U.L.N.Z Bit"
TBK_new_bit_desc:0 "A federation united in currency is a federation that can maintain a stable fiscal situation, both in terms of inflation and regarding the international trust in our currency. Stability brings prosperity and prosperity brings yet more prosperity. Invest in the federation now and see the stacks you put in grow every day!"

TBK_investments:0 "Financial Investments"
TBK_investments_desc:0 "Investing is just spending money to earn money and every savvy businesscreature knows it; that's one of the reasons why the state has invested in the growing industries of the federation, knowing that it can cash out at a later date for returns! If the government can trust the industries to grow, then so can everyone else!"

TBK_national_investments:0 "Subsized Industries"
TBK_national_investments_desc:0 "Though growth guarantees returns, there are some industries so vital that the state is willing to assist in their growth by providing subsidies and increasing their margins exponentially. Fronting these costs has put a noticeable dent in the coffers, but the rate of our industrial growth has never been better!"

TBK_free_economic_growth:0 "Free Growth"
TBK_free_economic_growth_desc:0 "Though new industries are having a little trouble getting off of the ground, the government's policy of non-interference in the economy has nevertheless paid dividends. Our industry has never looked quite so competitive and the markets are beginning to feel our influence as the federation trots onto the world stage."

TBK_free_economic_growth_mining_bureau:0 "Free Growth"

TBK_wallnut_warzena_bonus:0 "Wealth of Warzena"
TBK_wallnut_warzena_bonus_desc:0 "Warzena is well known for its relative prosperity within the Hazrumenian geographic area and is one its historical centres of development. Needless to say that with its place in the union solidified that the wealth they share with other constituent union states is having a considerable effect on our economy."

TBK_wallnut_zarantia_bonus:0 "Warriors of Zarantia"
TBK_wallnut_zarantia_bonus_desc:0 "Zarantia is well known for its fierce warriors within the Hazrumenian geographic area and as part of the Trans-Zebrahan trade network. Needless to say that with its place in the union solidified as their expertise on supply management and hot-climate acclimatization they share with other constituent union states is having a considerable effect on our armed forces."

TBK_zumidia_payment:0 "Zumidia Payment"
TBK_zumidia_payment_desc:0 "As part of the Ain Trotgourait Settlement, the U.L.N.Z has to compensate Hippogriffia in exchange for control over Zumidia. While it drains the national budget, the deal has spared the federation from a war."

### Wallnut communist ideas

TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_normal:0 "The Scarlet Scale — Balanced"
TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_normal_desc:0 "The competing factions under Dusk Wane and Niftyn currently have total parity within the government."

TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_dusk_small:0 "The Scarlet Scale — Slight Dusk Advantage"
TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_dusk_small_desc:0 "The balance of power has shifted slightly towards Dusk Wane and his syndicalist faction. Niftyn and his followers are suspicious, causing minor unrest."

TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_dusk_medium:0 "The Scarlet Scale — Growing Dusk Advantage"
TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_dusk_medium_desc:0 "The balance of power has noticeably shifted towards Dusk Wane and his syndicalist faction. Niftyn and his followers are growing restless as a result of the imbalance of power and infighting has begun within the administration."

TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_dusk_large:0 "The Scarlet Scale — Overwhelming Dusk Advantage"
TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_dusk_large_desc:0 "The balance of power has overwhelmingly shifted towards Dusk Wane and his syndicalist faction. Fights within the administration have escalated and at times have led to deadly consequences. Both organisations have resolved to arm themselves, fearful of the opposition."

TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_niftyn_small:0 "The Scarlet Scale — Slight Niftyn Advantage"
TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_niftyn_small_desc:0 "The balance of power has shifted slightly towards Niftyn and his stallionist faction. Dusk Wane and his followers are suspicious, causing minor unrest."

TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_niftyn_medium:0 "The Scarlet Scale — Growing Niftyn Advantage"
TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_niftyn_medium_desc:0 "The balance of power has noticably shifted towards Niftyn and his stallionist faction. Dusk Wane and his followers are growing restless as a result of the imbalance of power and infighting has begun within the administration."

TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_niftyn_large:0 "The Scarlet Scale — Overwhelming Niftyn Advantage"
TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_niftyn_large_desc:0 "The balance of power has overwhelmingly shifted towards Niftyn and his stallionist faction. Fights within the administration have escalated and at times have led to deadly consequences. Both organisations have resolved to arm themselves, fearful of the opposition."

TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_scarlet_war:0 "The Scarlet War"
TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_scarlet_war_desc:0 "All across the land, a shadow civil war has broken out between the rival factions within the federal government. Townhouses and ministries have turned into battlefields between Dusk's unions and Niftyn's party, spilling out to the streets in the townships and cities. Common people hide and cover as bullets whistle and grenades explode. The entire state apparatus is crippled while the army remains on the sidelines, content to observe the situation for now."

TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_scarlet_war_aftermath:0 "The Scarlet Scars"
TBK_wallnut_faction_balance_scarlet_war_aftermath_desc:0 "The shadow civil war has come to an end thanks to intervention by Generalissimo Wallnut and the federal army. While the conflict only raged for a few weeks, its scars are bare and visible all across the U.L.N.Z. It will take time before life returns to normal and hatred between the factions can be resolved."

TBK_legionare_terrorism:0 "Legionnaire Terror"
TBK_legionare_terrorism_desc:0 "While Chiropterra has been defeated, her army isn't gone: in the forests and hills of former Chiropterra, former soldiers continue to wage war against the occupiers. Terror attacks are common occurrence within the urban centers and in many locations the local sympathisers shield the terrorists from federal soldiers."

TBK_legionare_terrorism_lower:0 "Legionnaire Terror"
TBK_legionare_terrorism_lower_desc:0 "While Chiropterra has been defeated, her army isn't gone: recent actions by the federal government have been succesful in combatting the legionnaire threat and their popular support. While urban centers have been secured, the fight still continues in the rural communities where the legionnaires prepare for their last stand."

TBK_autonomous_communities:0 "Communal Administration"
TBK_autonomous_communities_desc:0 "Decentralised administration of the state through unionisation at a local level alongside communal agriculture has proven to be effective, if initially rather messy as citizens have taken some time to adjust. The positive results regarding the growth of regional industries appears to be no coincidence."

TBK_socialist_police:0 "Federal Police Force"
TBK_socialist_police_desc:0 "Though established primarily as a means through which to eliminate the Chiropterran resistance, the federal police force has proven to be very effective in a civilian role. They dutifully serve the state and its citizens; though militarised enough to respond to even the most severe calls, they always try to put on a friendly face for their fellow workers."

TBK_nic:0 "National Identity Card"
TBK_nic_desc:0 "The concept of a National Identity Card is fairly simple in concept and in application, but it has important benefits far beyond simply making our citizens identifiable. Though it remains somewhat of a hushed rumour amongst the public, it is very much true that these documents are immensely beneficial for state security. It's easy to know who has escaped with information when one of the suspects is listed as a recent immigrant, after all."

TBK_labour_visionary:0 "Labour Visionarism"
TBK_labour_visionary_desc:0 "The is an ideal worker: one that never tires and has an unlimited capacity to contribute to the socialist dream. Whilst this is a biological impossibility, it is an ideal that can be strived for; something that should be an aim for every citizen of the federation. Every pony, zebra and thestral understands that they are not perfect, but that they can be more than just themselves. That they too can be a visionary."

TBK_unions_pride:0 "Unions' Pride"
TBK_unions_pride_desc:0 "The question that so often arises when nationalism is thrown out of the picture is how any creature is supposed to take pride in themselves and their nation. The solution has proven very simple. Pride in a more decentralised identity as part of a union has replaced the ridiculous notion that any one society is naturally greater than another."

TBK_worker_equality:0 "Home of the Workers"
TBK_worker_equality_desc:0 "In a society of truly equal workers, all may speak and theorise as to how they may best contribute to society for their fellow proletarian creatures. Innovation and technological progress are an inherent part of any socialist doctrine, and so both are encouraged!"

TBK_union_factory_ownership:0 "Autonomous Production Councils"
TBK_union_factory_ownership_desc:0 "If there's one thing workers love, it's managing their work themselves. Sure they sometimes raise their own wages, but with a little oversight and a lot of trust they've proven the system to be a great motivating factor in their occupations. In fact, production has never looked better!"

TBK_union_factory_ownership_final:0 "Autonomous Production Councils"
TBK_union_factory_ownership_final_desc:0 "If there's one thing workers love, it's managing their work themselves. Sure they sometimes raise their own wages, but with a little oversight and a lot of trust they've proven the system to be a great motivating factor in their occupations. In fact, production has never looked better!"

TBK_communal_hubs:0 "Communal Life"
TBK_communal_hubs_desc:0 "A burden shared is a burden halved, so they say. Communal living has long been a staple of socialism and it is no different here; though unlike other socialist states we provide our workers with the very best living standards that they deserve as loyal and liberated citizens of a socialist state!"

TBK_federation_labour:0 "Federation of Labour"
TBK_federation_labour_desc:0 "Unity through the means of production is a concept that combines the idea of a worker's identity with the class consciousness inherent in the understanding of a creature's control over the means of production. Our federation is one of production and union, a true society of labour."

TBK_rights_bill:0 "Bill of Rights"
TBK_rights_bill_desc:0 "Not only does our bill of rights guarantee the usual things such as freedom to protest and freedom of speech - with important caveats of course - it also covers uniquely socialist ideas such as the right to unionise and the right to work. It has unsurprisingly been received well, particularly in the more developed parts of the country with large industrial districts."

TBK_national_unionization:0 "Unionization Frenzy"
TBK_national_unionization_desc:0 "Mass mobilisation has previously been achieved primarily through decadent ideas like revanchism and nationalism. We have instead utilised a system of mass participation which enables a voluntary and socialist mode of mobilisation. Unions for everyone and for everything!"

TBK_agricultural_revolution:0 "Agricultural Revolution"
TBK_agricultural_revolution_desc:0 "What's a good agricultural sector without the introduction of local collectives and modernised equipment? We have given the farmers both and the sheer volume of food produced has yielded a surplus for sale and for more foals. Field work doesn't seem so hard anymore."

TBK_agricultural_revolution_final:0 "Agricultural Revolution"
TBK_agricultural_revolution_final_desc:0 "What's a good agricultural sector without the introduction of local collectives and modernised equipment? We have given the farmers both and the sheer volume of food produced has yielded a surplus for sale and for more foals. Even the troops are eating better than ever!"

TBK_militia_union:0 "Union-Based Militias"
TBK_militia_union_desc:0 "There have long been informal militias in the federation, but under the system of unionisation they can be organised and better utilised. With just a little 'advertising' from the government there has been a massive surge in sign-ups for such groups, who themselves have sworn allegiance to Wallnut Drive and the federal army by extension."

TBK_militia_union_elected:0 "Union-Based Militias"
TBK_militia_union_elected_desc:0 "There have long been informal militias in the federation, but under the system of unionisation they can be organised and better utilised.

TBK_militia_union_comissars:0 "Union-Based Militias"
TBK_militia_union_comissars_desc:0 "There have long been informal militias in the federation, but under the system of unionisation they can be organised and better utilised. With just a little 'advertising' from the government there has been a massive surge in sign-ups for such groups which are under the complete jurisdiction of the armed forces thanks to the introduction of regimental commissars."

TBK_concentrated_development:0 "Work Towards Paradise"
TBK_concentrated_development_desc:0 "A worker's paradise is not the far-off fool's errand that the rest of the world believes it to be. The U.L.N.Z is a beacon of socialism and progress, caring for each and every citizen that resides within its borders. The state cares not about your race or nationality, only that you are a worker and that it should give you every opportunity to work."

TBK_state_workers:0 "Worker-Peasant Unity"
TBK_state_workers_desc:0 "Though the federation is a modern and industrial state, 'peasants' do indeed exist; though really the title is more in reference to agricultural workers than anything else. We have paid their plight much mind as the state continues to industrialise, marking sure to encourage cooperation between the two economic sectors."

TBK_national_industries:0 "Federal Planning Commission"
TBK_national_industries_desc:0 "There's nothing quite like a plan for getting work done, and the administration has never needed to do more! With a committee dedicated to planning and industrial zoning, the federation is industrialising at an unprecedented rate!"

TBK_national_industries_expanded:0 "Federal Planning Commission"
TBK_national_industries_expanded_desc:0 "There's nothing quite like a plan for getting work done, and the administration has never needed to do more! With a committee dedicated to planning and industrial zoning, the federation is industrialising at an unprecedented rate! Targets, plans and papers for everypony!"

TBK_weapons_of_revolution:0 "Mass-Armament Production"
TBK_weapons_of_revolution_desc:0 "The weapons with which we defend our nation and ideals are not mere tools, they are instruments in the grand orchestra of the revolution! They are kept in pristine condition, cherished and understood with all the attention from the military that they deserve for serving the workers."

TBK_weapons_of_revolution_final:0 "Mass-Armament Production"
TBK_weapons_of_revolution_final_desc:0 "The weapons with which we defend our nation and ideals are not mere tools, they are instruments in the grand orchestra of the revolution! They are kept in pristine condition, cherished and understood with all the attention from the military that they deserve for serving the workers. They are socialist saviours as much as those that wield them!"

TBK_soviet_administration:0 "All-Hazrumenian Revolutionary Soviet"
TBK_soviet_administration_desc:0 "A centralisation of efforts into one collective body has afforded the stallionist political movement and the nation as a whole with much stability and purpose. Workers work for the cause, farmers farm for it and our brave soldiers fight like tartarus to defend it."

TBK_kgb_lar:0 "Internal Security Service"
TBK_kgb_lar_desc:0 "What is a strong socialist regime without great leaders and responsible individuals to defend it? In much the same way that the administration of the state has been mostly left in the hooves of particularly talented and proven socialists, it is sensible that our 'police' should be similarly empowered; all for stability and the protection of the workers, of course."

TBK_kgb:0 "Internal Security Service"
TBK_kgb_desc:0 "What is a strong socialist regime without great leaders and responsible individuals to defend it? In much the same way that the administration of the state has been mostly left in the hooves of particularly talented and proven socialists, it is sensical that our 'police' should be similarly empowered; all for stability and the protection of the workers, of course."

TBK_media_propaganda:0 "Bureau of Media"
TBK_media_propaganda_desc:0 "Whilst our efforts to convince the population of our good intentions have been met with resounding success, it would be remiss of us to ignore the media. With the help of newspapers, radios and whatever else we can think to influence, we can make sure that our efforts don't go to waste."

TBK_stallionist_visionary:0 "Stallionist Visionarism"
TBK_stallionist_visionary_desc:0 "The is an ideal worker: one that never tires and has an unlimited capacity to contribute to the socialist dream. Whilst this is a simple impossibility, it is an ideal that can be strived for; something that should be an aim for every citizen of the federation. Our great leaders shall guide us as visionaries towards a brighter future for all!"

TBK_fortified_urban_centers:0 "Fortress Cities"
TBK_fortified_urban_centers_desc:0 "In the modern era, cities have become targets. As their industrial capacity expands it is logical that enemies will direct their attacks towards them so as to cut off our supplies and to disrupt our production lines. With that in mind, we have turned each and every one of them into a bulwark so that our enemies may never make any such strategic gains."

TBK_hazrumenian_stalliongrad:0 "Bulwark of Marksism"
TBK_hazrumenian_stalliongrad_desc:0 "Marks was always correct in the assessment of the socialist utopia and the federation with its vanguard leads by example.

TBK_revolutionary_frenzy:0 "Revolutionary Fervor"
TBK_revolutionary_frenzy_desc:0 "Every creature in our great federation is itching for a fight with whichever enemy arises to challenge us! The torchbearers of socialism shall not falter!"

TBK_marksist_constitution:0 "Federal Constitution"
TBK_marksist_constitution_desc:0 "Not only does our bill of rights guarantee the usual things such as freedom to protest and freedom of speech - with important caveats of course - it also covers uniquely Stallionist ideas such as the rights of state organisations and the power of the Generalissimo. It has unsurprisingly been received well, particularly within the administration."

TBK_militia_federal:0 "Federal Militias"
TBK_militia_federal_desc:0 "There have long been informal militias in the federation, but with the formalisation of their role they can be organised and better utilised.

TBK_communist_diplomacy_idea:0 "International Cooperation"
TBK_communist_diplomacy_idea_desc:0 "Internationalism and overseas assistance for fellow socialists is a key tenet of any leftist ideal and is one of the few things both factions in the government can agree on. Any step towards the socialist ideal is a step we are willing to take!"

TBK_payment_to_HIP:0 "Treaty of Tobuck"
TBK_payment_to_HIP_desc:0 "With a few diplomatic pleasantries and some tenacious bargaining, we have successfully negotiated a deal with our new hippogriff friends!

TBK_hazrumenia_liberation_army:0 "Liberation Doctrine"
TBK_hazrumenia_liberation_army_desc:0 "Warfare is difficult to justify to your own soldiers, but it doesn't have to be. Conquest and subjugation are decadent and ancient ideas that serve our federation no purpose, but warfare for liberation is a just cause for which any creature should fight! Come comrades, come and stand against the counterrevolutionaries!"

TBK_scarlet_scale_balanced_end:0 "Two-Party Socialism"
TBK_scarlet_scale_balanced_end_desc:0 "Despite their differences, the two factions within the government have managed to cooperate from start to finish. Dusk Wane and Niftyn may still seek their disparate dreams for a socialist utopia, but they'll do it together as comrades; perhaps even as friends."

TBK_scarlet_scale_dusk_small_end:0 "Noticeable Labour Front Influence"
TBK_scarlet_scale_dusk_small_end_desc:0 "Though not entirely dominant, the Labour Front has gained substantial enough power over the opposition when dealing with government affairs so as to make their work much easier. Niftyn and his followers may yet regain parity, but for now the rival parties will likely stay disparate for some time."

TBK_scarlet_scale_dusk_medium_end:0 "Labour Front Dominance"

An interesting development of this inadvertent reform has also been that the influx of commoners under temple care has led to the creation of homegrown militias.

In Tobuck, that's Giggle Juice, the president of the republic and the funniest drinking buddy Pea Shooter ever met. Despite holding no discernable political view or ambition of his own, he just helps smooth things over. He's just that nice!

TBK_moonspeaker_union_advisor_desc:0 "Much to Niftyn's dismay, Dusk Wane has successfully established a new advisory body within the government of the federation. As its name would suggest, it is a collection of moonspeakers that have left-leaning sympathies or at least have the intelligence and spine to support their fellow moonspeakers in the administration. Isn't it marvellous what religion can do for a nation?"
TBK_wallnut_resources_ministry:0 "Commission of Strategic Resources"
TBK_wallnut_resources_ministry_desc:0 "Much to Dusk Wane's dismay, Niftyn has successfully established a new advisory body within the government of the federation. As its name would suggest, it is a collection of industrial and mining experts with a sprinkling of military officials tasked with ensuring that the nation is ready for war at all times. Who better than the specialists to make sure everything is in order?"
TBK_copper_spark:0 "Copper Spark"
TBK_copper_spark_desc:0 "A staunch communist in Tobuck was always going to become a friend of Niftyn's given enough time and Copper Spark as both a talented young officer and political activist was no exception. Most know him for his unwavering commitment to his cause, but the administration recognises his ruthless efficiency; this observation is so widely shared between factions that it has quickly become tradition ask 'how's the wife?' in reference to his similarly brutal friend Tarnished Silver."
TBK_rusted_nut:0 "Rusted Nut"
TBK_rusted_nut_desc:0 "It wasn't exactly hard to convince an underpaid inspector of the benefits of socialist industry, but what was surprising was the very real skill that he displayed. As time went on he gradually established himself as a very important contributor to the Stallionist bloc within the administration, emphasising the importance of workplace conformity and the necessity of frequent evaluations."
TBK_wired_guide:0 "Wired Guide"
TBK_wired_guidedesc:0 "Talented scientists can be hard to come by and ones with the intellectual capacity of Wired Guide perhaps some of the rarest ponies in the known world. Needless to say that as soon as Niftyn happened across the young mare, he immediately set about grooming her into the perfect visionary for his Stallionist dreams. Though she has become somewhat of a demagogue, she never lost sight of her true passion for science."
TBK_brass_badge:0 "Brass Badge"
TBK_brass_badge_desc:0 "By all accounts Brass Badge is a truly kind and well-loved constable, one who always puts the needs of others above his own both at work and at home. Dusk Wane has seen fit to promote him to the national authority on all matters police, making him and his system of local constabularies two uniquely difficult things to oppose within the administration."
TBK_tarnished_silver:0 "Tarnished Silver"
TBK_tarnished_silver_desc:0 "Tarnished Silver is a good friend of Cooper Spark for a reason. Not only is she a terrifying force in her own right - high functioning sociopaths can be as unnerving as they are tenacious and deadly - but the ISS has proven to be a morbidly effective institution. Yet, to their credit, the job is always done and it is always done well; no witnesses and no loose ends, we should perhaps consider limiting their powers at some point in the future."
TBK_yeva_advisor:0 "Comrade Yeva"
TBK_yeva_advisor_desc:0 "Comrade Yeva initially struggled to adapt to North Zebrica, what with it being so different from Stalliongrad and the language barrier; but having spent some time in the federation she can truly claim to be well-adjusted. Indeed she has taken it upon herself to run the local youth organisations for Niftyn's Hazrumenian Communist Party and is well loved by parents across the nation, mostly because she lets them get away from their foals for a few hours a day."

TBK_almond_cookies_desc:0 "§YBiography§: Daughter of a famous academic historian, Almond "Joy" Cookies traveled overseas from her Colthage home as part of her university's study abroad program for a degree in Aeronautical Engineering. The zony soon found herself attending college in the lands of Stalliongrad, the Home of the Revolution in Equus.\n\nGalvanized by ideology, Almond dropped out of academics entirely and ventured off to spread the liberation movement of communism into the world, and the volatility of Tobuck offered the perfect opportunity for the young revolutionist. Mixing her acute knowledge of aerodynamics with ideology, Almond then joined the communist movements within the "Blank State" and gradually became their lead expert in Aeronautical Engineering.\n\nNow with communism having taken hold in Tobuck, Almond has dialed back her ideological fervor in exchange for a somewhat noticeable obsession for creating airplanes. The zony claims she gives wings for their political movement to spread with each aircraft rolling off the assembly line... and her superiors take Almond for her word.\n\n"More planes," she said calmly.\n\n§YPortrait By§: Egil"

TBK_tanis:0 "Tanis"
TBK_tanis_desc:0 "Once a well respected priestess in a now sidelined religious institution, Tanis blames the reformist government of Warzena for a lot of things; not least for ruining their traditional religious practices. Though she is much more thoughtful and careful that some others that have expressed interest in assisting Baragzen in his work, she has nonetheless committed her considerable resources and connections to his cause."
TBK_yarikh:0 "Yarikh"
TBK_yarikh_desc:0 "Having had his land appropriated by the reformist government in Warzena, Yarikh spent a long time in exile living off of the remainder of his coffers in the hopes that one day he will have his lands restored. Luckily for him, a certain zebra has offered to restore his properties and privileges in return for his fielty and service. What more could a bored and disheartened exile ask for?"
TBK_jetzabel:0 "Jetzabel"
TBK_jetzabel_desc:0 "Lowborn nobles are not often known to work alongside crown princes, but needs must. Jetzabel has long been chastised from Warzenan court thanks to her opportunism regarding several property claims to non-Leopard holdings. In her eagerness to acquire more wealth and land for herself, she has aligned with Baragzen in an attempt to make the most out of a coming conflict between the remnants of the Leopard dynasty and the current rulers of Warzena."
TBK_danage:0 "Danage"
TBK_danage_desc:0 "Danage was often known to be somewhat of a brat in his younger years as a colt, but as he has grown his arrogance has developed into a confident and charming demeanour. He has a very good eye and ear for whenever someone is hiding details and is more than capable of solving problems before they even emerge. He is also fiercely protective of Matanzal, his long-standing foalhood friend that helped him develop into the stallion he is today."
TBK_tylala:0 "Tylala"
TBK_tylala_desc:0 "Tylala is the daughter of one of Zal's many priests that has followed her father's hoofsteps into the profession, joining the ranks of Zanit's chosen. Her connection to the royal court and Matanzal has led to a series of rapid promotions despite her lack of interest in scheming and socialising with most of the royal court. In spite of this, she advises Matanzal in any way she can and often takes on the role of a mediator in her foalhood friend's decision-making process. Additionally, she is well known for her inspiring rituals on difficult matters such as war and holds sway over nobles and commoners alike as a result."
TBK_uarik:0 "Uarik"
TBK_uarik_desc:0 "A true oddity amongst Matanzal's current circle of friends, Uarik is unique in that he is one of the few that has nothing to his name besides a job and circumstantial favouritism. His low-born parents served Baragzen long before they found themselves working in the royal court, during which time Uarik met the heiress entirely by chance. After a while the pair became almost inseparable and he had a multitude of opportunities to prove his worth as a servant for Matanzal herself. When he eventually pledged his loyalty, the young mare of course accepted and he was granted a position as her most valued servant. Despite his occupation, he has slowly become more like a bodyguard as the years have passed and has become renowned for his skill in close-quarters-combat."
TBK_swift_turbine:0 "Swift Turbine"
TBK_swift_turbine_desc:0 "It's not often that creatures become close with an heir to the throne, but Swift Turbine has managed just that. A stallion born to a family of mechanics in Tobuck, Swift happened to befriend Zaalhanni as a colt when Baragzen hired his parents to work for his mercenary band on equipment maintenance. Over the years the other pony has stuck close to the prince in one way or another, eventually becoming a skilled mechanic himself; though unlike his parents his specialisation was in electronics. Zaalhanni relies on his foalhood friend nowadays to aid him in electrifying the empire through a variety of infrastructure projects."
TBK_raraka:0 "Raraka"
TBK_raraka_desc:0 "Raraka is much like Zaalhanni in that she was born in exile to a family of Warzenan nobles, which made it very easy for her to make friends with the prince when they first met. Her parents were originally part of the Leopard Dynasty's small court and were so dedicated to their cause that they left Warzena mere days after Baragzen did. Raraka adopted their fierce support of the royal lineage and believes wholeheartedly that her fortunes can only grow as she continues to support her foalhood friend. Unlike her parents she has taken an interest more... severe affairs, such as ruthlessly crushing any resistance that may arise to stand against the empire."
TBK_marzunda:0 "Marzunda"
TBK_marzunda_desc:0 "A particularly unique individual in Zaalhanni's circle of friends, Marzunda is the daughter of a Zarantian caravanner who retired into Tobuck. It was there that the trader became an associate of Baragzen thanks to her connection to the most important trade networks, that of arms and those across the Zebhara. This was how, completely by chance, Marzunda made friends with Zaalhanni at an early age. She later grew to become a thrifty mare, following her mother's hoofsteps into the caravanning business and later expanding her horizons into the field of trade as a whole. Nowadays she advises her foalhood friend on various matters ranging from trade to intelligence and desert supply lines."
TBK_keyrikh:0 "Keyrikh"
TBK_keyrikh_desc:0 "If you were to ask Keyrikh about his approach warfare, his first response would be to smile before explaining. Matanzal met this zebra whilst studying at the academy and, though she did not agree with all of his ideas, the two got along very well. For Keyrikh, warfare was a clash of wills, not just between those fighting or their commanders but between two nations and identities. War was won through defeat-in-depth and exploiting whatever victories you gained without leaving your enemies time to rest. That aggressiveness at least was something Matanzal was very fond of."
TBK_balyah:0 "Balyah"
TBK_balyah_desc:0 "Balyah was a zebra who was perhaps a little too obsessed with organisation and the importance of preparation in any operation. It was at the academy where she met Matanzal who immediately recognised her sharp eye and capacity to calculate risks whenever asked. That combined her incredible positional capacity made her an excellent study partner and officer."
TBK_jalabbanya:0 "Jalabbanya"
TBK_jalabbanya_desc:0 "There are occasions when the current war doctrines do not mesh well with up-and-coming officer recruits and Jalabbanya was never favoured for her asymmetrical approach. This merely interested Matanzal however, who was fascinated by the mare and subsequently became close friends with her. As time went on, the princess discovered that Jalabbanya was in fact a forward thinking planner who had fallen in love with the fire support that planes could provide for an army."
TBK_zalamas:0 "Zalamas"
TBK_zalamas_desc:0 "There was a reason that Zalamas was notorious amongst the generals that taught the officers in training. She was a motor mouth and at times failed to think things through, especially when it came to the respect that his superiors often expected her to have. Zaalhanni was intrigued whenever he heard her talk about the future of warfare and the inevitable motorisation of all the world's armies because of the advantages of speed and rapid deployment. Zalamas might have got in trouble with her superiors a lot, but the prince merely admired her confidence."
TBK_salabryh:0 "Salabryh"
TBK_salabryh_desc:0 "At first, Zaalhanni assumed of Salabryh what every other creature assumed: That she was simply quiet and had little interest in socialising with her fellow trainees. This quickly changed when she managed to utterly crush the prince in a war game by simply waiting for him to strike and reacting accordingly. After this, the two began to exchange experience and notes on warfare until she became a member of his inner circle. She has also opened up a lot since slipping into a circle of very active friends, but still retains her quiet reputation."
TBK_salt_rope:0 "Salt Rope"
TBK_salt_rope_desc:0 "Salt Rope was always somewhat of an oddity amongst the various military students that she worked besides. It always seemed as though she was more interested in the navy than the army, but was stuck commanding in the latter because of the empire's lack of the former. She dreamt of an imperial navy sailing the high seas which was an idea that Zaalhanni himself was sympathetic to. This quickly tied the pair's interests together and resulted in a long-lasting friendship between the two."
TBK_izzak:0 "Izzak"
TBK_izzak_desc:0 "Though he lacks the experience of other military officials, the incredible promise that Izzak demonstrated made him an obvious choice for Matanzal's adjutant. In recent times, he has also displayed an incredible adeptness for fighting amongst the empire's many rolling hills; a skill that many others seem to unfortunately lack."
TBK_pizayh:0 "Pizayh"
TBK_pizayh_desc:0 "In her application, Pizayh made a point of her capabilities in aggressive strategies. Whilst this was not necessarily unique to the general staff, his spotless track record and hot-headed personality had a certain appeal to Matanzal. As a result, he was hired and has subsequently kept the empire's many enemies on their hootips at all times."
TBK_lezzellah:0 "Lezzellah"
TBK_lezzellah_desc:0 "Despite Matanzal's typically offensive preferences, Lezzellah's background and preferred approach to tactics in warfare were of interest to the princess during her training. She favoured defensive tactical approach of choke-points and crossfires in addition to a grand strategy of defence and attritional warfare."
TBK_yelaiah:0 "Yelaiah"
TBK_yelaiah_desc:0 " Yelaiah is well known amongst the general staff for her reckless attitude and her preference to lead the troops personally at the front. Zaalhanni, though concerned occasionally for her health, could sympathise with her aggressive approach to strategy and the boldness with which she commanded her troops."
TBK_tick_tack:0 "Tick Tack"
TBK_tick_tack_desc:0 "It is relatively rare for a Tobuckian to rise to the top amongst the ranks of noble Warzenans and their lineages. Tick Tack is even more of an oddity for being a unicorn without a family history of military service. Zaalhanni was drawn to his application for adjutant primarily for the promise he showed and the unique skills he brought to the battlefield."
TBK_orezidh:0 "Orezidh"
TBK_orezidh_desc:0 "Orezidh was once a soldier who has since risen the ranks following a litany of field commendations and promotions. Despite his relatively new position in the empire's high command structure, Zaalhanni displayed great interest in his capacity far defensive planning and tactical expertise, resulting in his selection for the position of adjutant."

### Materiel Designers

TBK_Starting_Gun:0 "Cityside Rifles"
TBK_Starting_Gun_desc:0 "Cityside Rifles is one of the oldest materiel companies in Tobuck and has a long and storied history of collaborating with outsiders, something that has generally fostered an unhappy relationship between this company and the public. Despite their trials and tribulations, they remain an incredibly skilled manufacturing business; though employing them for state companies may draw the ire of the people."
TBK_Starting_Arty:0 "HighCal Plants"
TBK_Starting_Arty_desc:0 "Originally a subsidiary of Cityside Rifles, HighCal Plants developed an industry specialisation after the reign of the Storm King fell apart. After some time they became an independent company following a long and arduous legal case that was eventually resolved by the Tobuckian warlords who threatened to seize Cityside Rifle assets personally if the artillery production lines remained lifeless."

TBK_moon_rifle_corporation:0 "Moon Rifle Corporation"
TBK_moon_rifle_corporation_desc:0 "The Moon Rifle Corporation is a conglomeration of several materiel designers that has been created in service of Alesia. She will have her equipment and those that provide it will be rewarded generously for their services."

TBK_zamivgazal_steelsingers:0 "Most Honourable Order of Steelsingers"
TBK_zamivgazal_steelsingers_desc:0 "There is a beauty in the sound of metalwork that few can truly appreciate. It is an artisanal craft unlike any other to be practiced by the most talented and gifted of craftscreatures the land has to offer and maintaining such a status of import is the charge of the Steelsingers. His Majesty shall have his beautiful furnaces and metalwork!"
TBK_leopard_tires:0 "Leopard Tires Ltd"
TBK_leopard_tires_desc:0 "The importance of rubber and of wheels is an often overlooked facet of modern warfare and it is something upon which His Majesty seeks to profit and provide. Who better to purchase tires from than from the dynastic company?"

### Navy Designers

TBK_Starting_Navy:0 "Imperial Marine"
TBK_Starting_Navy_desc:0 "Though the naval tradition in Tobuck is limited, the light ship companies established by the Storm King retain a surprisingly effective string of dockyards that should be more than capable of supplying the state with credible new-age technology for use in our navy."

### Air Designers

TBK_Starting_Fighters:0 "Thunderclap"
TBK_Starting_Fighters_desc:0 "Though their humble beginnings as naught but local textile workers drafted into manufacturing airship fabrics are long over, the Thunderclap company remains if only in name. They are proud and talented engineers, a business known for their intelligence and their innovativeness in a world that requires their talents."
TBK_Starting_CAS:0 "Stormside Inc."
TBK_Starting_CAS_desc:0 "Much like their companions at Thunderclap, the origins of Stormside Incorporated can be traced back to the requirements for ground attack from the air in the designs of the Storm King. Though they are not so well rehearsed in modern fighter doctrines, there has been little to stop their cooperation with old corporate friends in making new air support."

### Tank Designers

TBK_Starting_Tank:0 "Zufra Steelworks"
TBK_Starting_Tank_desc:0 "Though not a tank producer by day, the Zufra Steelworks have created a market niche for themselves as producers of high quality metals and specifically of sprockets; the kind that could be easily retooled for military usage. Whilst unprepared to deal with heavier design specifications, they will have no problems providing the state with the means to produce light armour."

TBK_royal_severyan_rd:0 "Royal Severyanian R&D"
TBK_royal_severyan_rd_desc:0 "Tanks are not exactly a well understood development to the Tobuckian military, even the Zufra Steelworks could tell you that, but under the guidance of the Tsaritsa they shall become a thing of beauty and of incredible power. Long may she reign!"

### Concerns

TBK_industrial_concern_generic:0 "Tobuck C&C"
TBK_industrial_concern_generic_desc:0 "Tobuck has always been a centre of industrial development and in particular its metalworking plants that has long facilitated the more complex machining work. The expertise of Tobuck C&C may provide state enterprises with incredible insight into technological development in that area."
TBK_industrial_concern_generic_2:0 "Darnaigh Eletronics"
TBK_industrial_concern_generic_2_desc:0 "Though Darnaigh remains relatively underdeveloped in terms of industry, the area does bear fruits from the efforts of Zarantian tribal leaders. Despite lacking much in the way of population, Darnaigh has managed to become a centre of electronic development in Tobuck and may provide much needed insight into that realm of technology."

TBK_criminal_tradat_concern:0 "Tradat Bullet Co."
TBK_criminal_tradat_concern_desc:0 "Vasile cel Tradat is not a particularly competent weaponsmith, but he is very capable of finding the creatures that are. His company, appropriately to the relative freedom he gives the engineers, has quickly become known for their peculiar and curiously functional designs. Though upstarts in the world of materiel, Tradat Bullet Co. is already making a name for itself."

TBK_wingbardian_petrolium_company:0 "Azienda Generale Wingbardia Petroli"
TBK_wingbardian_petrolium_company_desc:0 "Though it pains many citizens of the federation to give foreign mining corporations free reign in our nation, they have nevertheless proven themselves worthy of their reputation.

pea_shooter_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 17th of November 962 in Petershoof\n\n§YBiography§!: When Pea Shooter was just a foal, one could hardly picture the cheerful little one to become a gun runner. With a loving family, the loveliest of childhood crush turned happy wife and good prospect as a shipping merchant between Petershoof and Skyfall. But still, even with all of that, little Pea Shooter was bored.\n\nIt could have all ended with a simple middle-aged pony finding a hobby or drinking the occasional excessive cider but then came the Stalliongrad Revolution. His family's business was ruined but Pea Shooter saw an opportunity. With the help of a shady friend, he bought some guns from a Fezeran smuggler and travelled back home, selling them to a communist volunteer group. And also one Severyanian counter-revolutionary he had met in a bar. He made good bit on those deals and decided to make it his career. He travelled to Haukland, making some deals there before finding his way south, wherever there were bits and a need for gunpowder.\n\nIn 1005, he made his way to Zebrica, looking to make bank on that insane Yeti whilst he was still on a roll. He failed as the Storm King died and his conquest spree ended the following year. But! He was in Tobuck with some friends and it just so happened that one of those friends had friends guarding the supply depots in the region. And with half of Zebrica in turmoil, Pea Shooter exactly knew where to find his clientele.\n\nWith the help of Vasil cel Tradat, he helped bring about the independence of Tobuck, the birth of harmonic republicanism in the region, found some pony to become its face while he became foreign affairs minister. As long as there was guns to sell in Tobuck, there would be business to do there for any good gun-runner.\n\nAnd Pea Shooter is more than a good one.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Bunnyshrubby"

vasile_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 31st of December 957 in White Flower\n\n§YBiography§!: Born in a family of imperial loyalists, Vasile grew up in the troubled times that followed the prince of Brodfeld's attempt at unifying the region of Prywhen. While his parents were aghast at the constant turmoil of the region, Vasile quickly accustomed himself in it.\n\nPushed into civil service, the young griffon became a firefighter. Clever and lacking in morals, Vasile organised a small arson ring to start fire in wealthy households to then steal as he put out the fires. He quickly left the job before he got caught. After a few stints in smuggling, he ended up landing the job that would change his life: sales representative of a burgeoning weapons factory. Uninterested in selling hunting weapons or handguns to local police forces, he cleverly used his job to funnel orders to all who would need them and create more demand: communists, criminals, minotaur or Gryphussian rebels. After a few years of spectacular success, Brodfeldian justice finally closed in. The dumbfounded company leadership was left to stand trial while their best sales representative was nowhere to be found.\n\nVasile traveled, doing some smuggling work, for a few years until he fatefully met Pea Shooter during a gun deal in Sicameon. Both double-crossed by some local pirates, they joined together and from there, a partnership blossomed.\n\nEventually, the pair would end up in Tobuck where Vasile diligently helped with the creation of the Republic of Tobuck. However, he was not satisfied with simply looting the place. He saw opportunities. Weaving contacts with the local wealthy elites, Vasile foresaw a future where Tobuck could become a true moneymaker where he wouldn't just be a criminal but a respectable member of society. Sadly, Pea Shooter didn't see it that way but why let a partner stand in the way of a good thing?\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"

bean_counter_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of March 966 in Albion\n\n§YBiography§!: Bean Counter was always somewhat of a third wheel in the Pea-Vasile business venture, acting both as an assistant and someone to whom the griffon in particular could point in order to shift blame. Having survived the venture and making a name for himself in the civil service, he has now become a particularly well-respected creature.\n\nOriginally Bean was little more than an errand colt in Albion, going back and forth from place to place as a helping hoof in the family business; but he dreamed of greater things. Whilst he was not nearly in such dire straights as Pea Shooter when the pair first met, Bean saw in that poor Severyanian stallion a creature that he could follow. They had long been close friends, with Pea acting as both a mentor and a guide in the world of finances and business.\n\nUpon meeting Vasile cel Tradat in Tobuck, Bean Counter's initial opinion of the griffon was that he was a greedy sociopath. That opinion hasn't changed as it is entirely correct, but he has spent enough time with that offputting creature to learn some tricks of the trade and build a relatively cordial relationship.\n\nOnly time will tell what the future holds for this stallion.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofuslied"

TBK_rose_rain_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 10th of January 974 in Tobuck\n\n§YBiography§!: Rose Rain is quite dissimilar from most Tobuckians in that she never longed for the old days of the Zarantian administration. To her it was little more than another people taking advantage of their city and her home, prosperity or otherwise. It was her dream, to create a fully independent and fully democratic republic; alongside her good friend Giggle Juice.\n\nAfter the rule of the storm king, she came ever-so close to achieving that goal; but when Pea Shooter and Vasile entered the fray it all came crashing down. The republic was created, but her friend was turned into a drunkard and subsequently a president only as competent as those that had to clean up after him. The warlords utterly crushed the Zarantians when they first attempted an invasion, but they also made sure that she and the Harmonist Front never came into power. The less that was said about Vasile creating a personal economic fiefdom in the background the better.\n\nShe had tried so hard to make it all work out the first time and had failed, but never gave up. Every creature of import in Tobuckian politics was a foreigner, but her dream was inclusive. The warlords attempted to take power for themselves, but they weren't all bad.\n\nAll she could do was keep pushing in the right places, making friends with the right people and doing her best to finally see that dream realised. Eventually the people would stand with her.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tek"

wallnut_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 29th of May 980 in Firstport\n\n§YBiography§!: There are few that have the guts to disobey orders in Chiropterra and even fewer that live to tell the tale, but there is one thestral that has managed both. Wallnut Drive has always been both a famous and infamous individual, the former amongst his large circle of friends and the latter amongst his equally large group of enemies. Though he is incredibly personable and a delight to be around in general, his escape from Chiropterra during his brief stint in service with the legionnaires has left a particularly large target on his back. If the legions got their hooves on him now, he'd be on the chopping block.\n\nLucky for 'the tricky thestral' then that he has many friends that are willing to harbour and protect him, like Pea Shooter who was more than happy to hire a warlord with a distaste for one of the biggest security threats to his operation. His characteristic smile and capacity to converse even in matters far beyond his intellectual capacity make him a truly loveable pony, despite his typically accidental aloofness.\n\nHe's well known for his rousing speeches, capacity to command, his love of drink and partying and his hatred of Chiropterra, something that drives him to do great things to this very day. A common joke amongst his ranks is that the only thing their general can't do is talk to mares which, though none of them have seen him try, is entirely accurate.\n\nThough he may be a wanted criminal just across the border, Wallnut Drive is never one to shy away from a fight; nor is he one to pass up an opportunity to party, even at the most inconvenient of times. He is most of all a rebel with a big heart.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Bunnyshrub"

baragzen_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 8th of July 975 in Zammar\n\n§YBiography§!: Baragzen is an exiled noble hailing originally from Warzena and now residing in Tobuck with dreams of one day returning to his home country. Much of his early life was spent in courtly education and becoming accustomed to his role as the heir to the head of the Leopard dynasty Waseem, his father. Most seemed to think that the family had been kept away from rule for so long that they were no longer relevant and Waseem seemingly agreed.\n\nAs he grew older, the young zebra began to slowly drift away from his family's dynastic policy of simple acceptance and instead started preparing for his family's 'inevitable' return to power. When his father passed, he became head of the family to little opposition or applause; his mother, Raaniya, attempted to persuade him to abandon his dreams of ascending the throne which resulted in a heated falling out. With no support even within his own immediate family, he ran away with a large part of the family coffers.\n\nThis would land him - and the significant amount of wealth he managed to smuggle out - in Tobuck which was a hotbed of instability and conflict during and following the rule of the Storm King. There he would raise a small private army, one which grew rapidly as his renown and skill became widely known amongst mercenary circles. His success came partly from a natural talent which was being explored at the time of his exile in a military academy, but it was additionally thanks to the absolute loyalty that he commanded in his soldiers. He treated them with respect and dignity, even going so far as to enter the fray himself when his force was much smaller and commanding from the field.\n\nDuring the dissolution of the Storm King's realm and the establishment of Tobuck, Pea Shooter hired him in essence to ensure that he couldn't cause any trouble. Now Baragzen thrives as a warlord, commanding an irregular but disciplined force. He still hopes to return to Warzena and reclaim his birthright, but only time and a little luck will tell if he can achieve that dream.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"

### Commander descriptions ###

TBK_clam_chowder_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 30th of September 973 in Applelaide\n\n§YBiography§!: Clam Chowder is, like almost all mercenaries in Tobuck, a foreigner. Born in far away New Mareland, she enlisted in the navy there as soon as her age permitted it but was repeatedly turned down for promotions thanks to her difficult relationship with whichever superior was unlucky enough to have her on board. Eventually her attitude would get her discharged which prompted her to steal a ship, a story she refuses to give details on, and sail off to find a navy in which her skill would be appreciated and where discipline was more of a suggestion.\n\nDespite initially seeing her arrival in Tobuck as an opportunity to make a name for herself, the mare has mellowed significantly over the years. Needless to say that she has also become a better and significantly more professional commander as a result, but she still dreams of commanding a larger flotilla than the pitiful number of ships in the Tobuckian fleet. She may yet get her wish.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: RyanManDraws"

TBK_great_pyre_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 4th of June 954 in Manehattan\n\n§YBiography§!: A selfless duty does not always bring glory and rewards to a soldier. Great Pyre witnessed this in 995, during the Severyana Revolution, where he fought as a sergeant in the Royal Guard. Only to be let go amongst other soldiers and officers for their actions in the fight against the communist revolutionaries. Instead of a peaceful life in Equestria, Great Pyre, bitter to the princess, left Equestria in the ranks of his fellow soldiers and joined with them in Zebrica as mercenaries, fighting not for glory but cold-hard cash.\n\n Yet service in the grand mercenary company was not enough for the ambitious stallion and he, with a core cadre of subordinates and local recruits, left to form their own mercenary band. This group soon gained a ferocious reputation for their brutality and callous regard for life, bot theirs and the enemies. Rumours continued to swell, until across Northern Zebrica the company was dubbed the Band of Flayers: a name originally meant to mock their lust for loot to the point of looting the dead amidst battle, Great Pyre eagerly adopted the name and further modified it by adding to it a motto. One which all members of the Band of Flayers adhered to.\n\n Down to the last fur!\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofuslied"

TBK_entin_miron_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 8th of October 970 in Petershoof\n\n§YBiography§!: Entin Miron is, in many ways, much like his commanding officer and friend Alesia Snezhnaya. He served in the Severyanian armed forces alongside her, spending years together in the academy and fighting the red rebels during the revolution. Intelligent, brave and dedicated; when observing the two working together many assume that the pair are related despite the differences in appearance.\n\nThough some believe otherwise, it was not the money or the loyalty to the exile cause that drove him to Zebrica. In fact, rather aptly, it was by her request that he boarded a ship and set sail for the southernmost continent. They have spent years in the north of the continent, fighting through innumerable wars including those waged in vain against the Storm King.\n\nThough he is skilled and, privately, wishes for a higher position in the military; most importantly he wants to look after his friend, no matter what she may get herself into.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofuslied"

TBK_pyotr_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of February 957 in Princessyn\n\n§YBiography§!: Pyotr is a pony of much mystery, yet of great renown. Little is known of his service in Severyana beyond the fact that he was retired at the outset of the revolution and was called back into service for its duration. Having heard of Alesia's great successes in Zebrica he saw no reason not to see the great resurgence of his homeland abroad for himself.\n\nThough his strategy is outdated, his manner and personality are a welcome departure from the seriousness of modern war. Already he has made many genuine friends amongst the emerging nobility and the court, including the Tsartisa herself who has taken quite a liking to the old Stallion.\n\nMany wonder whether he has any real goals or even a desire for promotion, but really he seems to be having a wonderful time as is.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

TBK_cherry_bomb_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 26th of June 972 in Equestria\n\n§YBiography§!: Cherry Bomb's family had made fireworks for generations, and nopony expected him to do anything else. At least not until the explosion. A giant novelty firecracker went off in his face when he was twelve, leaving him with a severe concussion, damaged hearing and a nervous twitch that never quite went away. Yet where others saw an accident, Cherry Bomb found his purpose.\n\nExperimenting with more and more extreme forms of explosives, he soon changed profession to developing explosives for the Equestrian military, only to be disillusioned with them as well due to their conservative approach. Instead, he left for abroad to offer his services as a freelancer. Whether it's in New Mareland blowing up Cockatrice nests, trying to sell the Brodfeld monarchy a new line of explosives or hobnobbing with Colthaginian patricians to secure funding for private arms factories, Cherry Bomb has done it all, and he prides himself on bringing explosions from the factory to the field.\n\nHis crew is a wild mix of all sorts of people, with Cherry Bomb having few qualms about who he works with. If you love explosives as much as he does, you'll have a job with his crew as they continue in their quest to discover and make use of every explosive in the world.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofuslied"

TBK_spell_stock_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 1st of October 979 in Northern Wittenland\n\n§YBiography§!: Spell Stock was always a troublemaker, even as a child, and age has not mellowed him out. Though of noble Wittenlandic birth and great wealth, his proclivities - causing scandals wherever he went, harassing the serfs by sniping at them from his palace and hunting monsters rather than tending to his property - were always an eyesore even for the other nobles. It all came to a head with White Star's ascension to the throne. Many had hoped she'd put him straight, but instead Spell Stock surrendered his property to the crown for a sizeable sum and left Wittenland.\n\nTaking to the road, he used his wealth to build up a cadre of fellow hunters with the goal to hunt every monster the world had seen. Yet, in a steadily worsening world, he started to wonder if it wasn't the sapient creatures who were the true monsters. If it was, that meant that his hunting list had expanded something fierce. What more, it turned out being a mercenary paid better than a freelance hunter.\n\nHaving just finished a stint in Skyfall, he's arrived in Zebrica with a brand new "Rarity For You" suit, a vastly expanded hunting cadre and a plan to get himself trophies of every kind of threatening beast the continent can offer, and why yes that ambiguity was quite intentional.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofuslied"

TBK_captain_z_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of March 968 in Colthage\n\n§YBiography§!: Once a highly respected Colthaginian officer, Bodzamal Aben commanded some of the nation's fiercest soldiers. He could have become a legend, but he made the mistake of going after the crime organisation known as the Tiger Syndicate. Though he scored several victories against them, corruption and moles within his unit led to him almost dying after being seduced by the wife of the Tiger Syndicate's leader.\n\nBarely escaping with his life, he saw how the fight against the syndicate slowly died out without him and bitterly concluded that they had patrician backing. He abandoned Colthage and has since become a gun for hire under the moniker "Captain Z". It was what he did best, and he liked doing it, so he decided it was time to make money off it instead of bleeding for a nation that seemed so willing to discard him.\n\nWhat more, one day he might have the money and the soldiers needed to go back and finish what he started. It's some ways off yet, but he's got a long time. The dead are patient, after all. \n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofuslied"

TBK_oborin_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 23rd of March 985 in Ravenskoye \n\n§YBiography§!: In truth, Oborin was nothing more than a junior officer at one of the Stalliongradian naval academies. Though talented, his career had hardly even started when he was given the offer of going overseas to some backwater state in Zebrica. Maybe it was his yearning for action, his barely-kempt brazenness or even the desire to impress his commanders; but he accepted the call to action nonetheless.\n\nHe was greeted with a small navy on arrival and a pang of disappointment when he realised why the senior officers hadn't been given this position overseas. Yet, thanks to assurances from Wallnut and some of his other staff, the young admiral is hopeful. Perhaps he'll amount to greatness yet, much to the assumed annoyance of his superiors back at home.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: RyanManDraws"

TBK_myrga_draconis_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 25th of June 792 in a cave \n\n§YBiography§!: Historically there have always been two things that successfully coax dragons from their caves: the promise of immense power or the draw of incredible wealth. Though desires for these things are most commonly exhibited in younger beasts who are yet to establish themselves, on occasion it will entice much older creatures to retire their positions of responsibility in search of personal glory. It was this very phenomenon that brought Myrga to Tobuck.\n\nFollowing a brief stint as a hatchery guard, a station notorious amongst dragons for the boredom it begets, the stench of overseas blood and money was nothing less than intoxicating. The death of the Storm King was an unspoken cue to visit, drawing the dragon overseas to the riches of the weapons trade and the conflicts that flared up as the remnant yeti forces were gradually ousted.\n\nThough initially scorned as a monster by contemporary generals, it soon became clear that he was curiously talented in complex matters of strategy despite his size and temperament. To the surprise of many, he has become better known for his protective nature and warding roar rather than his wartime brutality and occasionally overwhelming bloodlust.\n\nEven now, as a leader, he always has an excuse to dive personally into the fray. Luckily for us he's easy to keep on side, especially if we can provide battles to fight and plenty of goodies for his hoard. Nopony can deny the morale boost a dragon provides!\n\n§YPortrait By§!: OpalRadiance"

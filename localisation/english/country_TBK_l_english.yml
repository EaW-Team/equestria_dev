### Starting Tree ###
 
TBK_art_of_the_deal: "The Art of the Deal"
TBK_art_of_the_deal_desc: "Some ponies would consider the finest art to be the graceful brushstrokes that inhabit a painter's canvas, or maybe the soothing harmonies that fill the walls of a concert hall with on performance night; but for arms dealers Pea Shooter and Vasile Cel Tradat, there is no greater art in the world than the art of the deal."
 
TBK_facade_of_democracy: "The Facade of Democracy"
TBK_facade_of_democracy_desc: "It's an open secret in Tobuck that the government and its stated "democracy" are just an elaborate sham to garner support from nations like Maregypt, when in reality much of the country is governed by authoritarian warlords, and democratically elected officials have little power."
 
TBK_grease_the_wheel: "Greasing the Wheel of Democracy"
TBK_grease_the_wheel_desc: "Even though the elected government holds little power, simply subverting them by use of force would be inexcusable in both the eyes of the people and friendly regimes; as such it sometimes requires a little bit of bribery and blackmail to convince government bureaucrats to sign off on risky legislature, and smile while doing it."

TBK_convincing_legislature: "Pass the Home Act"
TBK_convincing_legislature_desc: "Gives an idea giving bonus to stability and party popularity gain with malus to pp: the republic passes a law that enables free passage between the lands of Tobuck and Zarantia to all citizens, no questions asked."

TBK_expand_republican_guard: "Expand Guard Jurisdiction"
TBK_expand_republican_guard_desc: "Gives an idea giving pp gain bonus and lowers warlord suspicion; Pea forces the republic to pass a bill expanding authority and legal right of the republican guard to control movement within Tobuck. In reality it enables him to control flow of information to the warlords, if only briefly."

TBK_nascent_bureaucracy: "Clean the House"
TBK_nascent_bureaucracy_desc: "Gives flat pp and stability bonus alongside a stack of dirty money; leads to an event where some bureacract wonders about the recent reforms that has seen her workload increased while her boss seems terse, giving to drinking even earlier than usual and without the usual jovialities."

TBK_hope_tobuck: "Three Hurrays For Tobuck"
TBK_hope_tobuck_desc: "TODO"

TBK_meet_giggle_juice: "The Loveable Drunk"
TBK_meet_giggle_juice_desc: "While effectively a puppet, one of the most important ponies in Tobuck's democracy is a pony named Giggle Juice. A drunkard who lacks actual power, but makes up for it with an abundance of charisma; he's a popular figurehead in the eyes of many, and his support is paramount to maintaining the facade of Democracy." 

TBK_parlay_vasile: "Erstwhile Partner"
TBK_parlay_vasile_desc: "Gives an event where Pea sits down with Vasile to discuss life after Tobuck."

TBK_zarantia_peace_speech: "Peace and Prosperity"
TBK_zarantia_peace_speech_desc: "Gives party popularity and stability; Giggle Juice gives a speech written by Vasily about how Tobuck and Zarantia have no qualms and can co-exist, come high or low water. He even invites the queen over for a drink and chat. Could lead to also an event for this speech?"

TBK_early_pay_day: "Their Pay Day"
TBK_early_pay_day_desc: "After thoroughly touching base with everypony that props up our make-believe democracy, it's time for them to reap the benefits of their loyalty. After all, we want it to be pretty clear that allegiance is an investment that pays dividends."

TBK_our_pay_day: "Our Pay Day"
TBK_our_pay_day_desc: "The rules have been set, the sellers regulated and the offshore accounts maintained. We're fit to rake in cash for as long as our supply lasts, come Tatarus or high water."

TBK_thanks_for_bits: "Goodbye, And Thanks For the Bits"
TBK_thanks_for_bits_desc: "Completing this focus will end the Pea Shooter money part early, giving him an additional personal wealth bonus for handing over Tobuck earlier than laid down in the deal."

TBK_pr_campaign: "To The Citizens of Tobuck!"
TBK_pr_campaign_desc: "Stability increase + lowers warlord suspicion; Pea, with help of Giggle, launches a massive pr campaign to calm the populace and soldiers amongst the warlords about the recent reforms."

TBK_please_listen: "Do Not Believe Their Lies!"
TBK_please_listen_desc: "Resets warlord suspicion; the media begins to counter spreading lies and rumours actively, going as far as to defame by name known critics."

TBK_to_each_their_game: "To Each Their Game"
TBK_to_each_their_game_desc: "A free market is good for business, but there is a such thing as it being too free. With a little bookkeeping and regulation we can ensure that only loyal liaisons and captains are shipping our guns around, and that none of them are sold to local warlords that could try to muscle in on the trade."

TBK_checking_the_supply: "Checking the Supply"
TBK_checking_the_supply_desc: "Gives access to a better gun salvaging mission; should be about Pea with his aides calculating and checking the amount of guns remaining based on estimation."

TBK_quality_products: "Quality Products"
TBK_quality_products_desc: "One of the most important things an arms dealer maintains is his reputation. Sell defective arms to a customer one too many times and you may as well consider yourself out of a job. On the other hoof, certain firearms are precisely hunted for their qualities, whenever exceptional or historical. It'd be a waste to sell them off to a common buyer and leave a wealthy patron miffed."

TBK_business_of_gun_running: "The Business of Gun Running"
TBK_business_of_gun_running_desc: "Arms trafficking is the bread and butter of Tobuck. It's why the government was founded, how it's funded, why it's leaders even care, and ultimately the glue that binds Tobuckian society together. On top of all that, it makes us extremely rich!" 

TBK_meeting_the_banker: "Meeting With the Banker"
TBK_meeting_the_banker_desc: "One of the most important part of Tobuck's gun trade is offshore bank accounts; Tobuck is not a state with a stable economy. Storing our accumulated wealth in local banks is just asking for it to be lost with the next financial crisis, which is why it's important to regularly meet with overseas bankers to maintain foreign accounts."
 
TBK_performance_review: "Performance Review"
TBK_performance_review_desc: "With ample use of auditors and statisticians, we can actually get to the business of determining if all of our hard work has actually paid off in the end, or if we've just wasted our time with bad business."

TBK_streamlined_procurement: "Streamlined Procurement"
TBK_streamlined_procurement_desc: "Lowers the timer for the missions at cost of pp; in short, Pea streamlines the arms gathering through reformed catalogue system and expanded workforce."

TBK_eye_on_warlords: "The Three Warlords"
TBK_eye_on_warlords_desc: "Gives some stability and popularity; Pea knows he has to keep the warlords distracted in order for them to not discover the deal with Zarantia. Therefore he must be ready to play ball with them just a little bit longer."

TBK_celebrate_military_success: "Celebrate Military Success"
TBK_celebrate_military_success_desc: "Lowers warlord suspicion; Pea organises shipments of food and drinks to the warlords under the pretext of celebrating their success in defending Tobuck."

TBK_rules_gun_running: "The Rules of Good Business"
TBK_rules_gun_running_desc: "Gives pp and lowers supremacy popularity; just a flavour description detailing how gunrunning has certain rules that any succesfull smuggler ought to follow or they will perish."

TBK_first_rule: "First Rule"
TBK_first_rule_desc: "First rule is to never get shot with your own merchandise. Sell it unloaded, and sell it to people way out of killing range. Wallnut Drive is a true oddball compared to the other warlords, someone who seems to find new ways to break guns and expend ammunition."

TBK_tricky_thestral: "The Tricky Thestral"
TBK_tricky_thestral_desc: "Wallnut Drive is not the smartest bat, but he has a way of showing up just when you don't need him to. If given the right incentives, he'll cause enough chaos and confusion on his own that the others won't realize the game until it's already up."

TBK_second_rule: "Second Rule"
TBK_second_rule_desc: "Second rule is to always ensure you have a foolproof way of getting paid, preferably in advance. If you don't have a guaranteed way to get your cash in the end, the deal isn't worth it. Alesia Snezhnaya is a smart mare and careful with her goods. But give her a good deal and she'll make a good business partner."

TBK_white_severyana: "The White Severyanan"
TBK_white_severyana_desc: "Alesia Snezhnaya is dogged and determined, but thinks linearly. If we hand her some extra troops and tell her to fortify the border, she'll be too busy scrupulously digging trenches to snoop around."

TBK_third_rule: "Third Rule"
TBK_third_rule_desc: "Third rule is to never pick up arms with your customers. Baragzen, the snobby Zarantian noble, has far greater ambitions than any other warlord in Tobuck, only outmatched by his boorish smugness. But passion like his, if harnessed well, makes for a good tool."

TBK_exiled_royal: "The Exiled Royal"
TBK_exiled_royal_desc: "Baragzen sees Tobuck as just a stepping stone to future conquests. Let him think that way. We'll give him some extra guns and tell him the other warlords are looking to muscle in on his territory, and he'll keep them off our backs."

TBK_failure_operation: "Erstwhile Operation"
TBK_failure_operation_desc: "Lowers warlord suspicion, will damage warlord divisions and lower stability; a skirmish is launched against Chiropterra using warlord units but it naturally ends in failure. Gives Chiropterra an event giving some free labourers?"

TBK_provoke_battles: "Tobuckian Standoff"
TBK_provoke_battles_desc: "Greatly lowers supremacy support; Pea pokes the hornets nest in just the right way to cause a brief threeway battle between the warlords' soldiers, turning their attention elsewhere."

### Vasile tree

TBK_vasile_start: "To Save the Republic"
TBK_vasile_start_desc: "Well that was a mess. Pea's off. Zarantia's angrier than they ever have been and the warlords are running amok in the countryside. But while you can see some smugglers running to the ships in Tobuck's harbour, there is a griff in the presidential palace who still sees an opportunity. After all, who better to thrive in chaos than a Brodfeldian?"

TBK_take_loans: "Grovel For Loans"
TBK_take_loans_desc: "Pea drained the whole treasury dry to fund his escape. Whatever he made it out with is gone and so is the rest. At this point, we'll have to bite the bullet and borrow at loan shark rates but it beats austerity. Nothing is more unstable than corrupt civil servants getting told to make do with less."

TBK_crash_cuts: "Crash Cuts"
TBK_crash_cuts_desc: "Whoever said that you have to spend money to make money was not in the gun running business. While you can haggle with some ponies, you can't expect to go far with the loan shark breathing down your neck. Anyway, everypony takes a squeeze and be a little patient. If you want guarantees and security, go plant potatoes!"

TBK_support_zarantian_businesses: "Entice the Zarantians"
TBK_support_zarantian_businesses_desc: "Throughout Pea's regime, we took very little care in giving a reason for the Zarantian-aligned families not to hate us. Considering Pea's end game, it was no surprise but Vasile had nonetheless made some business overtures. By reaching out, we could build a relationship off of that. And once we're in, we can work things out."

TBK_blame_pea: "Everything Is Pea's Fault!"
TBK_blame_pea_desc: "Pea Shooter was a fantastic gun smuggler but he really mucked it up for the rest of us. We'll be lucky if we manage to really turn things around. Luckily, the Tobuckians feel the same way. So we might as well pin everything on him. He's far away and not planning to come back. He'll understand. Probably."

TBK_blame_giggle: "And Giggle's Too!"
TBK_blame_giggle_desc: "Giggle Juice was an amazing tool for a while when Pea's crew was still getting money and some good partying was enough to smooth the edges. But now, we're going to go through a rough patch and nothing gets on the nerves of everypony than a drunk who can't get up before noon. Time to sober up."

TBK_vasile_president: "Emergency Elections"
TBK_vasile_president_desc: "For all of its short history, the Republic of Tobuck never made good on its promise of organising elections. So let's. We'll have to be quick about it so no opposition can organise. Also, we'll need to raid the pantries to buy votes with something else than money. Hey you! Want a pound of flour in exchange for a vote?"

TBK_restore_legitimacy: "Bring Back Stability"
TBK_restore_legitimacy_desc: "For a little while, we have been able to keep the rowdiest elements of our mercenaries and smugglers in check. Now, they're running wild and anypony turning to the state needs to pay up to even get listened to. It's time to bring back some order and show them that maybe there's hope under the striped flag. At the very least, it'll buy us time to figure things out."

TBK_reform_and_expand_republican_guard: "Arm the Republican Guard"
TBK_reform_and_expand_republican_guard_desc: "The Republic Guard has never been much more than a ponyguard force dedicated to prevent the warlords from bullying the capital itself. It is time to give them the tools to do more and actually stand up to the warlords when the time is right. We have the guns. Time to give them to the right ponies this time around."

TBK_keep_some_servants: "Keep Some Bureaucrats"
TBK_keep_some_servants_desc: "Vasile and Pea paid a whole lot of ponies throughout their partnership. Sadly, both indulged in some favoritism, especially when Pea's plan became clear. The people wants corrupt heads to fall. Might as well give them what they want with Pea's loyalists and make sure we get to keep the loyal ones who know what they're doing."

TBK_cull_civil_servants: "Sweep the Slate Clean"
TBK_cull_civil_servants_desc: "For all its usefulness for our business venture, the corrupt apparel of state was a really nothing more than a temporary boon. It's a rotten base for anything long-term. We need to remove all of the corrupt civil servants and make sure those with real inside knowledge shut up permanently. Plus, this will be a wonderful opportunity to garner good among the people."

TBK_fight_warlords: "Act Swiftly and Fiercely"
TBK_fight_warlords_desc: "It's been months now that the three idiots and other new wannabe idiots have been ducking it out in the countryside to be in a prime position to take Tobuck. In a way, they made our job for us. Time to go out and mop them up before the bats or Zarantians get the idea of doing it first. Citizens, to arms! Or something like that. We're learning."

TBK_vasile_inaguration_speech: "Father of the Fatherland"
TBK_vasile_inaguration_speech_desc: "The votes have been counted and the elected parliament of Tobuck can finally gather. Thanks to our diligence, it's only a formality and Vasile Cel Tradat shall be confirmed as president of the Republic. It's time to address the people. Fear not, little foals of Tobuck. Vasile's here. And he'll take good care of you. We promise."

TBK_legimate_republic: "Republic of the People"
TBK_legimate_republic_desc: "You know what? If we are to make this republican thing work, we might as well walk the walk. Well. Up to a point. But still, we can find a way to make things work for the people and for us. In addition, it would finally allow us to make good on our plan to give us a presentable facade for the harmonic and established powers. After all, all facades are better with an actual building behind it."

TBK_shore_up_defences: "Sign the National Defence Bill"
TBK_shore_up_defences_desc: "For a while, the warlords formed a fine line of defense. Enough well-armed crazies to make our neighbours think twice about grabbing the big prize. But now, we'll have to provide for our own defense to fend off any attackers. Vasile has the will to do it. But how to go about it? That is the million bit question."

TBK_raise_extra_troops: "Call Upon the People"
TBK_raise_extra_troops_desc: "With the promise of a more respectable republic, we can start recruiting among the general population without fear of angering our military leaders. With a decent pay, we can even hope that enough will answer the call to fill up our ranks. It'll take time of course to build a standing army capable of defending Tobuck but it'll be ours. Plus, we know how to find enough guns to make even the lowest recruit a threat."

TBK_rally_front: "Together For Victory!"
TBK_rally_front_desc: "Gone are the days of the warlords and mercenaries. You won't be fighting so Pea Shooter can loot you for longer but for a square deal. Everypony gets their share. We're fighting for our homes and our families. This is Tobuck and it is not for sale! So gather around and grab a gun."

TBK_bat_forts: "The Western Trenches"
TBK_bat_forts_desc: "Chief among our threatening neighbours stands Chiropterra in the west. With Wallnut Drive's luck and tactics gone, we need to find new ways to counter them. Fortunately, we do have some veterans whose experience we can use. But considering the size of Tobuck, we have no other choice than to dig and entrench ourselves to start. Here's a shovel."

TBK_bat_defence: "Together Against the Bat Menace"
TBK_bat_defence_desc: "You know what's worse than smugglers, warlords and corruption? Bats. They're crazy, they're evil and they hate anything even remotely pleasurable. It's been a thousand years and they're still not over their insane alicorn mother issues. They'll ban sunlight and ask you to thank them for it. So choose wisely. Choose the lesser evil. Choose Tobuck."

TBK_hire_additional_mercs: "Hire the Band of Flayers"
TBK_hire_additional_mercs_desc: "We need forces loyal to the new republic in order to stabilize our still fragile rule, and to get the Chiropterrans off our backs. While we want to phase out the use of mercenaries and warlords eventually, we need to bring in some new muscle to keep the peace. The barbaric "Band of Flayers" and their fearsome reputation, including rumors of skinning victims, will be the perfect force to scare those fanatics off."

TBK_use_merc_experiences: "Utilize Mercenary Experiences"
TBK_use_merc_experiences_desc: "You know what's great about mercenaries? They know how to kill things. They'll tell you about it. The important thing is to discard the moral quandaries and take the free lesson. So as long as we're hiring them, we might as well put them to good use. Now if only they would pick up after themselves."

TBK_criminal_republic: "Republic of Riches"
TBK_criminal_republic_desc: "All the way back when the striped flag was raised over Tobuck, Vasile felt in his bones that this was a good hustle. Not in the way Pea had envisioned. We need not steal everything that isn't nailed down. Rather, we can milk this republic. Politics can be a racket just as much as war is. Time to do some... career reorientation."

### Post-Chiropterra War Legimate tree

TBK_vasile_post_bat_legimate: "Our Triumphant Republic"
TBK_vasile_post_bat_legimate_desc: "It's over. The bats are in disarray and Vasile stands triumphant, our president-conqueror. In just a few years, we transformed a fake republic into a model for Zebrica, a profitable democracy, and now, we'll do it again for the fanatics! We're not the emotional type but it does bring a tear to your eye. Take that Kemerskai!"

TBK_bat_break_faith: "What Did Wallnut Say Again?"
TBK_bat_break_faith_desc: "From the beginning, we've had a window, if a bit of a foggy one, into how Chiropterra operates and what we've seen is not pretty. And that's us saying that so you catch the drift. If left alone, the madness will bite us in the tail. We need to neuter the moonspeaker operation and make sure that from this day forward, they'll be shooting blanks even on a full moon!"

TBK_bat_leave_mommy_issues_be: "Just... Leave Faith Be"
TBK_bat_leave_mommy_issues_be_desc: "Look. They've been weird about it for a thousand years so maybe it's better that we just find a way to accommodate it all. Maybe teach them a few lessons about healthy management of expectations and pick up something like painting. We'll just make sure the moonspeakers don't get too murderous. That'll be a start."

TBK_bat_peaceful: "Chill and Eat Mangoes"
TBK_bat_peaceful_desc: "Religion is obviously a root issue of why Chiropterra acted the way it did. However, we can't just ignore the result of a millennia of cultural stiffness. We need to sell to the bats the idea that there is more to life than war and moon, that they can just have fun. And we know a thing or two about how to sell something to a pony."

TBK_bat_moneys: "Tributes of the Moon"
TBK_bat_moneys_desc: "The Chiropterra war has been a costly endeavour and they've long caused untold sorrow and property damages. It's high time that they start paying reparations to those they've harmed. Well, to us for a start. Let's not upset the hierarchy of creditors. We don't forget our brave veterans or those who provided them with the tools of war."

TBK_bat_determine_guilt: "Guilty, Not Guilty..."
TBK_bat_determine_guilt_desc: "Throughout its history, Chiropterra has committed so much crime it's not even funny anymore. And that's just according to their archives. So if we want to make sure the angry victims are calmed down, we'll need to go through all of it and figure out who gets a bullet, a cell, a ticket to wherever or slapped with a fine and hoof so we can call it a day."

TBK_bat_old_stooges_new_management: "Old System, New Management"
TBK_bat_old_stooges_new_management_desc: "Look, Canterlot wasn't built in a day and we don't have a millenia on our hooves. We barely managed to build a republic once and that was without a cult to deal with. So we'll do the best thing a good leader can do: passing the buck! Er, I mean delegate to the right ponies and let them figure all that stuff out. They'll manage."

TBK_bat_democracy: "Traditional-Moon Party"
TBK_bat_democracy_desc: "Look, we know. But that one has been such a winning brand, we can't just go and not use it. In all honesty, the TMP has a nice ring to it and they need some reassurance that no, we're not trying to besiege the gates of the moon. Also, they're paying us anyway so we might as well give them a little something for all the royalties we're getting."

TBK_bat_chiropterra_republic: "New Lunar Republic"
TBK_bat_chiropterra_republic_desc: "President Vasile never meant to conquer and occupy foreign land, merely to liberate them and put an end to a criminal regime. Now, the new and improved Lunar Republic stands proud in Chiropterra, ready to engage with the world in good faith and absolutely no trace of terrorism. Ain't that swell? Why is there somepony wheezing in the back?"

TBK_vasile_popular_autocracy: "Vasile the Victorious"
TBK_vasile_popular_autocracy_desc: "As the sun rises over the dank chiropterran hills, president Vasile stands alone and victorious and yet, some still have some doubts about him. Why? Hasn't he achieved the impossible? We have had so much success it's starting to get physically painful. Especially for our enemies. Poor them. So let's party. Lack of gratitude is best handled the morning after."

TBK_centralize_presidency: "One And Only President"
TBK_centralize_presidency_desc: "The road to our current success was a bumpy ones, with all kinds of needs to compromise, play nice and prove ourselves. Well, we've proven ourselves and it is high time that ponies stop pretending like president Vasile doesn't deserve his place. How about you all prove yourselves to him? What have you ever done for Tobuck?!"

TBK_who_saved_you: "Who Saved You?"
TBK_who_saved_you_desc: "We've spend so much time fighting for our lives that we have not really told the story of how it all went down. But in the end. Where was Tobuck when president Vasile took over? Surrounded by bloodthirsty enemies, torn apart by warlords and looted by a criminal. So ask yourselves, all the critics, how did we get here from there?"

TBK_who_made_you_wealthy: "Who Made You Rich?"
TBK_who_made_you_wealthy_desc: "It is true that Tobuck has always been well-developed but that wealth was always built on playing second fiddle for foreign rulers by families with little pride in their own people. So what did the Brodfeldian do? He did not export the wealth, he expanded it right here. He made Tobuck rich on its own terms and it's all trickling down back to you all."

TBK_sideline_harmonists: "What´s Good In Friendship?"
TBK_sideline_harmonists_desc: "What did the harmonists ever do for you? Did they feed you when you were hungry? Did they stand against Chiropterra when they loomed over us? Did they provide you with jobs? No. All they do is chatter and bicker about the right of law. Well, the law says Vasile Cel Tradat is the president of the republic and the law is right."

TBK_i_am_republic: "I Am the Republic"
TBK_i_am_republic_desc: "There, we said our piece and we're not hearing any retort. This concludes our national debate. So if you didn't pay attention, here's the main takeaway. This Republic rests upon the president's mighty shoulders and you all better be afraid of what would happen if Vasile Cel Tradat ever shrugged! Thanks for listening and get back to work."

TBK_symbols_presidency: "Idol of the Republic"
TBK_symbols_presidency_desc: "A great problem in Tobuck is that it never had a real story of its own, symbols or a mythology to explain why it is so great. In a way, it lacks a brand. And who better than president Vasile to be the face of it? So let's codify the presidency and elevate his game changing achievements. We'll call it all Vasilism. Sure rhymes with patriotism."

TBK_final_arbitrator: "Now You Sit and\n Listen To Me"
TBK_final_arbitrator_desc: "We've had to compromise way too much for too little gain during the early years of the presidency. We let the opposition in parliament and the media sling dirt at anypony. But in the end, it was our great president Vasile who lead us to victory and prosperity. So let's cut to the chase and listen. You all might learn a thing or two!"

TBK_supreme_protector: "Hear My Pledge"
TBK_supreme_protector_desc: "The candidate is chosen and Vasile's place in Tobuck's national myth is enshrined. So it may be time for the president to address the nation and to explain what his role is. That of a father, a father who knows that it's time for his little foals to spread their wings, to trot out of the nest and fly into the sunset. Ok, we'll keep working on that but the gist is there."

TBK_prime_minister_idea: "Perhaps I Work Too Much?"
TBK_prime_minister_idea_desc: "You know what? One can in fact suffer from success. There is something about open leadership that just drains you. Perhaps it's time to look for an heir. Well, at least a new face to throw at the press so the president can focus on the good thing in life : prestige, money and business. Preferably all at once."

TBK_perfect_servant: "My Most Loyal Aide"
TBK_perfect_servant_desc: "Vasile Cel Tradat has been a great president and achieved much. Nopony can deny that, especially not the one who wrote it all down. So who better to take the reins than his secretary? Bean Counter, the shy little pony who crunched the numbers for so many reforms. The good thing is that he's used to taking orders so he'll do great."

TBK_establish_office_prime_minister: "Congratulations\nPrime Minister!"
TBK_establish_office_prime_minister_desc: "Now that we've done some spring cleaning, it's high time to make things official. So congratulations, Bean Counter! You are now the head of government, serving at the president's leisure and responsible before parliament. And if it doesn't work out, Vasile will dismiss and replace him. That's how it works in a democracy, right? "

TBK_democratic_principles: "Soul of the State"
TBK_democratic_principles_desc: "Tobuck is a republic but it's always been run on promises and Vasile's careful maneuvering. However, it's not enough to walk the walk, the people wants to hear the right words too. So it's time to enshrine the principles of liberty and democracy within our constitution. With some guardrails of course. Don't want the crazies storming into office, now do we?"

TBK_tcp_supremacy: "Forwards Tobuck, Follow the TCP!"
TBK_tcp_supremacy_desc: "Vasile has done a lot for the nation but in truth, it was always a team effort. And that team is the Traditional Center Party. The TCP stands for liberty, for democracy, for prosperity and for victory! Bean Counter is the party chancellor and Vasile Cel Tradat its esteemed founder! So get in or get lost! Er, I mean, get in for Tobuck! Hurray."

TBK_tcp_propaganda: "There Is No Tobuck Without the TCP!"
TBK_tcp_propaganda_desc: "The party has never been the most active. So time to shake things up if we're going to make it for election day. Get your fat tails out of your sofas and start campaigning! Ring some bells, shake hooves and smile! Don't know how to do that? Grab some pamphlets and give them out! No, you're not getting paid for this! Your job is on the line!"

TBK_electoral_gamble: "Luck Never Dies"
TBK_electoral_gamble_desc: "The harmonic opposition constantly rants and rave about a free and fair election. And you know what? We're in. Let's do this. Let's have an election. A fair one. A quick one. What do they even have to offer that we don't? We've got the money, we've got the results, we've got the best candidate. Then again, it's a gamble but eh, we got this."

TBK_meet_opposition: "Shake Claw With Rose"
TBK_meet_opposition_desc: "Rose Rain. Leader of the Harmonic Front. It was such a cute idea that, allegedly, Pea Shooter sent a fruit basket when she had her first public meeting. However, she did manage to win over some ponies and is formally the head of our opposition. If we're going to make the people buy into this election, it's time to acknowledge her."

TBK_formalize_election_rigging: "One Citizen,\nOne Vote"
TBK_formalize_election_rigging_desc: "On paper, an election is something that is extremely simple. You vote and whoever gets the most votes wins. However, even the worst student of political science could tell you that there are finer details that can alter the outcome of an election and that the definition of winning is relative. We agree. So let's get to work on th"

TBK_citizen_fears: "Only Vasile Protects Your Interests, Citizen!"
TBK_citizen_fears_desc: "You know. Ponies are not really that dumb. They know that Vasile has some unsavory dealings here and there. But what about Rose? What was she doing? And what of the other candidates? All these politicians, do we know what they were doing during Pea's days? Meanwhile, you know Vasile and things are good. But the others? Can you trust them?"

TBK_sham_electoral_victory: "Three Hurrays To Victory"
TBK_sham_electoral_victory_desc: "Alright. Election day. What a blast this campaign has been. President cel Tradat has toured the nation with great success but now comes the moment of truth. I know we've stacked the deck but I'm starting to feel that the harmonists are onto something with this whole election thing. I HAVE NEVER FELT THIS ALIVE!"

TBK_entry_world_stage: "Enter the World"
TBK_entry_world_stage_desc: "Well. State building? Check. Defeat the lunatics? Check. Sounds like “this pompous griff from Brodfeld” has more than an ace in his sleeve, doesn't it? Now that we have proven ourselves, it is time to bring our unparalleled abilities to the worldstage. Call in the translators. And a few crates of the best Aquileian wines. We don't want to be rude now, do we?"

TBK_warzena_choice: "What To Do With Warzena?"
TBK_warzena_choice_desc: "For as long as we've been independent and allegedly since Zarantia conquered Tobuck, Warzena has been a stick in the mud.

TBK_all_for_defence_desc: "Resolute stoicism, unyielding determination, uncomplaining sacrifice. These were the values which made Severyana strong before the communist cancer rotted them away, and these are the values Alesia will instill by her example."

TBK_long_from_home: "It's Long Way To Princessyn"
TBK_long_from_home_desc: "The white exiles are few in number, but every single one of them is worth ten other ponies. Alesia will call upon old contacts and allies among the last true Severyans, and rekindle the dream of a new Severyana among them. One day, we shall return, and bring fire and death to the bloodthirsty beasts who despoil our lands."

TBK_new_exile_regiment: "We Are Severyan Soldiers"
TBK_new_exile_regiment_desc: "The advantage of coming to power in Tobuck is that it is a cultural blank slate. Thanks to this, we have been able to foster Severyan values of stoicism, sacrifice, hierarchy, and discipline among our soldiers, with no need to uproot an inferior service culture. The tales of Severyan heroes of old shall inspire our troops, and they will show the rabble of this continent what true warfare is!"

TBK_contact_kin: "The Exiled Community"
TBK_contact_kin_desc: "Alesia was already well-known among the Severyan exiles, and as news of her victory has spread more and more of her compatriots have begun to feel the old flames of patriotism rekindle. Some of the old nobility managed to escape with significant wealth, and now many of them are making generous donations to our cause."

TBK_severyan_family: "Severyana Endures Through Us"
TBK_severyan_family_desc: "Severyana may have fallen, first to the scheming princess and then to the vile communists, but so long as one true Severyanan draws breath it is not lost. Alesia will rule with the same rigid strength as the tsars of old, and muster her forces until, one day, the true foals of Severyana will return to drive out the parasites who feast on their homeland."

TBK_i_hate_sand_desc: "There is nothing worse than desert warfare. However, given Pea Shooter's machinations we will likely have to face the Zarantian savages sooner rather than later. Alesia has declared that we will construct a line of fortifications along their border, complete with minefields and concealed killzones, such that by the time we step into the desert there will only be corpses waiting for us."

TBK_full_war_economy: "All the Guns and Bullets"
TBK_full_war_economy_desc: "Our first priority should be getting guns into hooves. We'll use the remainder of the smugglers' ill-gotten-gains to purchase as many weapons as we can find, and scour the city to dredge up its hidden stashes. After that, we'll have to make our own."

TBK_pay_troops: "All Possible Troops"
TBK_pay_troops_desc: "Our first priority should be to get more hooves to hold guns. We will increase soldiers' pay to incentivize as many to enlist as possible, then extend conscription to make up the difference with draftees."

TBK_new_tobuck: "Death of Tobuck"
TBK_new_tobuck_desc: "The Republic of Tobuck was a sham state from the start. Few marked its passing, and fewer still will mourn it. It is time to formally bury the republic, so that our new order can begin in earnest."

TBK_adopt_monarch_role: "One With the Duty"
TBK_adopt_monarch_role_desc: ""I have searched far and wide for a suitable claimant to the Severyan throne, and found nothing but layabouts, decadents, and wastrels.

TBK_council_batsby_desc: "Despite their faith in the Nightmare being the defining characteristic of their civilization, the Chiropterrans are extremely disciplined in all aspects of life other than religion. Other than the centrality of Nightmare Moon, they seem to have no unity on matters of faith. This cannot do. We will call together the Moonspeakers to codify, once and for all, what our faith is. The Tsaritsa commands it."

TBK_ensure_orthodoxy: "Enforce Orthodoxy"

TBK_faith_reeducation: "Offer Them Salvation"

They will return with their faith strengthened, with a renewed revulsion towards the infidel who rejected their Truth, and if we are lucky with new converts."

TBK_conclave: "Holy Conclave"
TBK_conclave_desc: "The Moonspeakers have up until this point had no real hierarchy except for the first-among-equals position of Chief Moonspeaker.

TBK_universal_family_desc: "In a way, the people of Novaya Severyana are all Tsaritsa Alesia's children, and are all brothers and sisters under the watchful gaze of the Tsaritsa and the Nightmare.

TBK_jingoism: "Jingoism"
TBK_jingoism_desc: "As an ancient Tsar once said, "Severyana has two friends: the army and the navy." Never has that been more true than today in Novaya Severyana, and like in Chiropterra and old Severyana before us, we will make the army the most important institution of the state, second only to the will of the Tsaritsa herself."

TBK_enshrine_militarism: "The Call of Duty"

TBK_virtue_chivalry: "Virtue of Chivalry"
TBK_virtue_chivalry_desc: "The Druzhina of old Severyana never saw their military service as merely a grim duty to the state, or as just another job. For them, it was a calling, a way to both develop and show their chivalric virtues. We will cultivate this heroic ethos among our soldiers, so that each one of them will welcome the day of battle with joy and celebration."

TBK_druzhina_reform: "Most Noble Druzhina"
TBK_druzhina_reform_desc: "While the Chiropterran legions are impressive, their martial tradition is not the only one. Alesia's Druzhina are what led us to victory against the Legions, alongside the favour of the Nightmare, and they will continue to form our vanguard forevermore!"

TBK_reinstate_legions_desc: "After their defeat, the Imperial Legions have existed under a cloud of shame. But our victory was the will of The Nightmare, and will result in greater glories than ever before. We shall formally refound the legions, removing the shame of defeat and affirming their eternal loyalty to Empress, country, and Tsaritsa!"

TBK_military_innovations: "Much Needed Upgrades"
TBK_military_innovations_desc: "Our soldiers need far better weapons than they have used thus far. For that, we must make the massive military-scientific base of Chiropterra into the core of our research apparatus, rather than the paltry facilities available in Tobuck."

TBK_infantry_primacy: "Tools of Infantrymare"

TBK_tank_plane_desigs: "Severyan Innovators"
TBK_tank_plane_desigs_desc: "Heretical as they are, the blasted communists are years ahead of us in tank and aircraft design. Some of the White Exiles who have recently arrived claim to have "acquired" certain blueprints of the latest Severyan designs. We should fund their proposals to build our own variants of these war machines."

TBK_pardon_lmrd: "Imperial Curative Sciences Faculty"
TBK_pardon_lmrd_desc: "The LMRD was a ghastly organization, but that was because they lacked the Tsaritsa's guidance and spent their time on mad side-projects. By adopting a more pragmatic, results-oriented approach, the new Imperial Curative Sciences Faculty can redeem these astray scientists by having them research projects of genuine use to the Tsaritsa."

TBK_realm_expansion_plan: "Natural Borders"
TBK_realm_expansion_plan_desc: "The Chiropterran expansion plans were flawed, but only because of their lack of the Tsaritsa's guidance, rather than their intent. We will prepare a series of conquests to bring our neighbours into the fold, bringing much needed order to this chaotic land."

TBK_warzena_integration: "Protectorate of Zamivgazal"
TBK_warzena_integration_desc: "We will establish a new protectorate in Warzena, named the Protectorate of Zamivgazal, to integrate these lands into our structure of governance. Warzenans who prove themselves loyal and adapt to the Novaya Severyanan ethos will form the basis for a new nobility in the Protectorate."

TBK_reopen_river_trade: "Flow of Trade"
TBK_reopen_river_trade_desc: "Once, there was rich trade along the rivers of Warzena, but the loss of Tobuck and the diplomatic crisis with Zarantia dried up that trade. Now under the Tsaritsa's watchful eye, trade can once again flow along these rivers, with the addition of Chiropterran goods which they once witheld from the locals."

TBK_hippogriffian_zebralands: "Drive Them to Sea"
TBK_hippogriffian_zebralands_desc: "There can be only one great power in these lands, and so long as the Hippogriffs have a clawhold on the mainland our dominance will never be assured. The task ahead seems daunting, but with the Tsaritsa's guidance and the Nightmare's blessing, we cannot fail!"

TBK_add_to_vassal_control: "Award Zirta"
TBK_add_to_vassal_control_desc: "Out of the districts of Zumidia, Zirta is proving the easiest to administer due to its relatively rural, conservative population and its close proximity to our previous conquests. We will name it the County of Zirta, and award it to a loyal vassal."

TBK_caravan_priviliges: "Imperial Caravan Trust"
TBK_caravan_priviliges_desc: "We will grant trans-Zebharan trading privileges to select loyal merchants. With the infrastructure of our Realm supporting them, soon they will bring back great wealth to our nation."

TBK_invasion_ports: "The Grand Dockyards"

TBK_zarantia_integration: "Shizra Confederation"
TBK_zarantia_integration_desc: "The Zarantians are known as an ungovernable people, but that is not so. Their confederal model can be coopted with a few promises and a few bribes to the right zebras, so long as we do not expect them to show more loyalty than simply paying their admittedly-low taxes and fighting in our armies."

TBK_zebra_cossacks: "Imperial Yasani"
TBK_zebra_cossacks_desc: "Zarantians have a strong mercenary tradition and a long history of nomadism. By recruiting select Zarantian tribes to serve as mobile border patrol units, affording them extra pay and the right to wear distinctiv culturally-inspired uniforms, we can get a rapid-response force capable of bringing the most distnt frontiers off our realm to heel."

TBK_nationalism: "Fidelity"
TBK_nationalism_desc: "Every subject of our realm must be true to their Tsaritsa, to their homeland, and to its traditions. It is only through a strict Fidelity to these things that a nation remains strong and free of decadence."

TBK_old_chiropterran_governance: "Territories of Old Order"
TBK_old_chiropterran_governance_desc: "Chiropterra is a proud and mighty land, with its own traditions of governance built up over a millennium of struggle and sacrifice. We will integrate it into our tsardom as the Realm of Chiropterra, and while there is much to be done to smooth out the contradictions in Chiropterra, we shall endeavour to leave as much of that venerable state intact as possible."

TBK_remnants_tobuck_government: "Ruins of Late Republic"
TBK_remnants_tobuck_government_desc: "The Republic of Tobuck was a wretched place, and not only because it was a republic. But against all odds, its denizens pulled through and won what was supposed to be an impossible victory. We will integrate them into our tsardom as the Grand Duchy of Tobuck, forever honoured as the people who delivered our Tsaritsa to her throne."

TBK_tsarist_order: "Her Imperial Sovereign's Lands"
TBK_tsarist_order_desc: "The Tsaritsa's rule extends not only to the people of Novaya Severyana, but to the soil as well. We will not collectivize as the red scum do, nor guarantee private property as the snivelling Harmonists do. All land in the Grand Duchy of Tobuck and the Realm of Chiropterra shall be legally owned by Tsaritsa Alesia, to be held and used by her assent."

TBK_tsaritsas_hoof: "The Tsaritsa's Hoof"
TBK_tsaritsas_hoof_desc: "The Nightmare's Hoof was one of the finest, if not the finest spy agency in the world. We should find the agents of this noble institution and recruit them back into the fold, so that the enemies of the Tsaritsa will never be able to keep secrets from her."

TBK_military_agents: "On Foreign Mansions"
TBK_military_agents_desc: "The Tsaritsa's Hoof should focus its efforts on foreign intelligence, as the Nightmare's Hoof did before it. This will give us an edge in any future conflicts, whether against our neighbours or against the communist worms occupying Severyana."

TBK_public_purpose: "On Home Streets"
TBK_public_purpose_desc: "The Tsaritsa's Hoof should focus its efforts on domestic surveillance. That way it can function as a powerful tool to root out corruption, dissent, and all other things which would weaken the state and the reign of the Tsaritsa."

TBK_codex_alesia: "Alesia Pravda"
TBK_codex_alesia_desc: "Tsaritsa Alesia has introduced a new code of laws to rationalize, streamline, and simplify the complex legal codes which have accumulated over the last milennium in Chiropterra, as well as bringing the once-lawless Grand Duchy of Tobuck in line with the standards of law and order of our realm."

TBK_severyan_tone_desc: "TODO"

TBK_social_elements: "Elements of Imperialism"
TBK_social_elements_desc: "While the Equestrian Elements of Harmony are partially responsible for weakening Severyana and leaving it open to communism, the fundamental idea of enumerating a set of virtues as guiding principles for the state is a good one. We will enumerate our own set of "Elements," to act as the moral guides for the Tsaritsa's government."

TBK_element_order: "Element of Order"
TBK_element_order_desc: "The Element of Order refers to the fundamental value in obeying your superiors, following orders, and respecting the hierarchiess you live under. It is distinct from the Equestrian Element of Loyalty because it does not orient itself around on personal connections, but around strict duties."

TBK_element_will: "Element of Will"
TBK_element_will_desc: "The Element of Will refers to the virtue to be found in imposing your will upon the world, and therefore lends itself naturally to the captains of industry as well as the high officials of state."

TBK_element_honour: "Element of Honour"
TBK_element_honour_desc: "The Element of Honour refers to upholding the duties and dignity of one's station with upright zeal. It differs from the Element of Honesty in that the meaning of Honour is heavily dependent on your social station: the Honour of the labourer is to work, while the Honour of the soldier is to fight, and the Honour of the Tsaritsa is to rule."

TBK_crown_scouts: "Organisation of Moon Rangers"
TBK_crown_scouts_desc: "Chiropterran youth are largely left to their own devices, their parents and local youth programs entrusted to instill good values in them. While this worked well when Chiropterra was a thousand year old stratocracy, given recent cultural changes it would be best to centralize these youth programs to ensure they inculcate not only faith in The Nightmare, but also a zealous devotion to the Tsaritsa."

TBK_element_authority: "Element of Authority"

TBK_arch_enemy_communism: "Death To Marksism!"
TBK_arch_enemy_communism_desc: "There was one pony in history more evil than the usurper Celestia. Her name was Caramel Marks. Not only does her doctrine deny the Nightmare's right to rule, it denies monarchy itself and seeks to destroy all the noble traditions of this world.

TBK_traditonal_social_order: "Traditional Social Order"
TBK_traditonal_social_order_desc: "For all the laudable discipline of their military hierarchy, Chiropterran civil society is distressingly egalitarian. Other than a few aristocratic families whose role is mainly honourary, the faithful are largely treated as equals.

TBK_ursagrad_capital: "My Snezhnograd"
TBK_ursagrad_capital_desc: "Ursagrad occupies a key position between the Chiropterran Realm and the Grand Duchy of Tobuck, and its history as being founded by the Severyanan Ursa Legion would reinforce that aspect of our Tsardom's character.

We have nothing but bodyguards, mercenaries and scared conscripts next to a mish-mash of guns and not always assorted ammunition. Time to make an army out of it. But we'll manage. How hard can it all really be?"

TBK_construct_military_academy: "War College of Tobuck"
TBK_construct_military_academy_desc: "Well. Since we no longer rely on mercenaries and shall we say decentralized forces, we need to learn and teach how to maintain and organize an army. Now. We can't afford to go slow and meticulously build a proud and long-standing officer corp tradition. Time for some crash courses!"

TBK_quality_leadership: "Strength Through Quality"
TBK_quality_leadership_desc: "When in war, you need to learn what your strengths and vulnerabilities are. So while we are not that small of a country, we will be outnumbered. However, by focusing on training a good officer corps, we can make sure that our proficiencies in weaponry are used in the most efficient way possible. No waste of bullets or ponies!"

TBK_additional_manpower: "Fill the Ranks"
TBK_additional_manpower_desc: "When outnumbered, the best bet is to try and even the score. So there are more of them than there are of us but by the transitive properties of us knowing how to get our hooves on a lot of guns and ammos, we should be able to make sure that we kill enough of them so that we can take them! That's math. Who ever said that war was hard?"

TBK_magic_ponies: "War Can Be Magic Too!"
TBK_magic_ponies_desc: "Northern Zebrica is hardly a center of magical knowledge but we do have unicorns. Now granted, very few of them have even shown an inkling towards violence and normally, that would be good. However, we'll need to teach them to go from magical cake making to battlefield shield generation if we want to get an edge in the trenches."

TBK_radio_development: "Radio R&D"
TBK_radio_development_desc: "Our enemies have had years to prepare for an invasion and they'll have a slew of tactics to take us on. So we need to establish clear and excellent lines of communication for our units if we want to be able to adapt quickly and safely! Lucky for us, our smuggler friends know a thing or two about radio and encrypted communications!"

TBK_standard_rifles: "Commission New Battle Rifle"
TBK_standard_rifles_desc: "Now here's a conundrum, how do gun runners arm a standardized army? Well the answer is that it's a nightmare. You need factories, ammo, a supply line and all of it needs to be efficient with a much lower profit margin. But we made our bed and we need modern rifles if we want to kill whoever wants to lay in that bloody bed!"

TBK_new_leaders: "In Service Of the Republic"
TBK_new_leaders_desc: "With the warlords gone, we need to build up the Republican Guard and quickly. But more importantly, we need sane and loyal ponies to lead it. We're going to need to do a whole lot of performance review to find somepony capable in that sorry lot of an army. I mean, we are looking for the best of the best! Which is still a low bar here."

TBK_hire_griffonian_experts: "Hire Griffonian Instructors"
TBK_hire_griffonian_experts_desc: "When it comes to war, you can never go wrong with hiring some Griffonian veterans. That continent has been in turmoil ever since somegriff lost a trinket and Kemerskai broke everything. Some of them must surely be interested in working in a warmer climate for some exceptional pay. Just make sure the other officers don't learn how much."

TBK_establish_national_militia: "Rapid-Response Militia"
TBK_establish_national_militia_desc: "Not mentioning the internal risks to the republic, neither Zarantia, Warzena or Chiropterra can be described as being thrilled with us breathing. With such angry neighbours, we need. Let us set up local teams of minuteponies with some basic training and equipment to hold off the enemy until the army can arrive on the battlefield."

TBK_plan_militia_resistance: "Militia Battle Order X1"
TBK_plan_militia_resistance_desc: "The minuteponies can only do so much and so we need to accept that they'll fold if the army is delayed in any way. So let's work with that knowledge. Rather than sell an idea of fighting to the death to simple citizens, we'll instruct them to disperse before it's too late, disturb enemy movements and support refugees so as to not clog the roads and bridges."

TBK_army_grand_battleplan: "Central Army HQ"
TBK_army_grand_battleplan_desc: "The entire Republic rests upon a single center of command. If Tobuck falls, there is no hope of falling back. Therefore, our entire military doctrine must be to delay, stop and destroy anything that is on its way towards the capital. "

TBK_proper_trenches: "Shovel In Every Hoof"
TBK_proper_trenches_desc: "They say that there are two kinds of ponies: those who dig and those who have a gun. What they forget is that there's a third kind of pony: the one who pays. So you get both a shovel and a gun and if you want to live, you better dig those trenches like there's no tomorrow! We're not running a playground here!"

TBK_special_engineer_training: "Special-Engineer Courses"
TBK_special_engineer_training_desc: "It turns out that simply digging trenches is not as easy as it sounds like. There's a whole art in standardizing them and making them fit for combat, housing and logistical support. We better start selecting a few lucky ponies who will get the prized honor of supervising others doing the digging."

TBK_fortification_program: "Fortress-Republic"
TBK_fortification_program_desc: "Tobuck was never in the spot of defending itself and it shows. We won't be safe without some massive investment into our infrastructure. We need military depots, casemates, forts in any strategic positions and most importantly, the means of moving our troops and equipment around quickly and efficiently."

TBK_killzone_tactics: "Killzone Tactics"
TBK_killzone_tactics_desc: "With our limited supply of soldiers, we will have holes in our lines but we can transform this weakness into a strength by drawing our enemies in less defended open fields where we can blaze them from our stronger positions and then mop them up using our few mobile units."

TBK_masterwork_trenches: "Impenetrable Defence"
TBK_masterwork_trenches_desc: "We have a solid basis but we need to do more if we want to have any chance of withholding a major offensive. Send concrete to the trenches. Plant landmines in the killzones. Improve coordination between the artillery and the field engineers. Make every inch of terrain a Tartarus to go through! The line must hold!"

TBK_army_superior_firepower: "Battlefield Destruction"
TBK_army_superior_firepower_desc: "The Republic was born in a pile of guns surrounded by ponies who knew how to use them. This is where we came from and this will be how we prevail through the worst of storms! More guns. More firepower. And make sure they'll only pry them from our cold dead hooves!"

TBK_introduce_cannons: "Discard the Bombards"
TBK_introduce_cannons_desc: "Too many of our soldiers are still accustomed to old artillery pieces better suited for a museum than for the battlefield. It's partly on us as Pea Shooter ordered the best cannons to be sold internationally. Well, that's over. Soldiers? Forget about blackpowder, smoke and cannonballs. Meet the shell and the howitzer. Ain't they a beauty?"

TBK_anti_armor_aid: "Pierce All Armour"
TBK_anti_armor_aid_desc: "The tank is all the range nowadays. It'll be a long time for us to have the industry to produce them reliably for domestic use. However we can learn how to penetrate them. And if we do, that's where we'll be happy to be a small country. There'll be no going around for them. So let's wreck some armor!"

TBK_endless_steel_rain: "Explosive Forecast"
TBK_endless_steel_rain_desc: "A good cannon can hit a target and kill it. A better cannon will hit multiple targets at once and make sure that they're either dead or unfit for combat. And that my friends is how a small country negates the power of demographics. Hey, you! I hope you brought an umbrella!"

TBK_chemical_deterrence: "Chemical Deterrence"
TBK_chemical_deterrence_desc: "At some point in time, in a wretched place, the very worst of matchmakers had the idea of bringing chemistry and ballistics together. However, in Tobuck, we've learned to make the best out of the worst and we'll be damned if we're not making good use of anything that makes our guns deadlier. Now, carry those barrels with care."

TBK_proud_army: "Proud Foals of \nthe Republic"
TBK_proud_army_desc: "It was a difficult endeavour but we've never been afraid of difficulties. Now, a new generation of ponies is entering the barracks of the Republican Army of Tobuck and what they are finding isn't a slapped-together mess anymore. The era of warlords is well and truly over. Now stands an army, proud and strong!"

TBK_warlords_army: "Warlords of Tobuck"
TBK_warlords_army_desc: "Hey, warlords aren't so bad. Keep 'em paid, keep 'em armed, and they'll fight for anycreature, even a crook like Vasile. Pea's problem was he was a cheapskate who paid them all ad hoc and never signed a decent contract. That won't be an issue for us."

TBK_army_mobile_warfare: "Relentless Pursuit"
TBK_army_mobile_warfare_desc: "A decentralised mercenary force can move as fast as tartarus if given the right incentives. No need for elaborate chains of command, just offer a bonus to the first ones to the fight, and to any lower-level officer who shows daring and initiative. Boom. Instant blitzkrieg."

TBK_increase_military_production: "State Military-Industrial Complex"
TBK_increase_military_production_desc: "We need some proper factories if we're gonna make all this equipment. Yes, it'll be expensive, but absolutely nothing has a higher long-term profit margin than weapons."

TBK_trucks_galore: "Faster Than Anypony"
TBK_trucks_galore_desc: "You know what's faster than a speeding pegasus? A speeding truck. Let's motorize as much of our army as we can. It'll let 'em maneuver faster it'll let 'em carry more gear, and it'll let 'em carry off more loot once the fighting is done. So long as they give us a cut for the truck..."

TBK_add_armour_to_trucks: "Protect the Engines"
TBK_add_armour_to_trucks_desc: "Bullets and gasoline don't mix. Fortunately, we have a lot of scrap metal and a lot of ponies who'd be willing to do some dubiously-safe welding work for a quick buck. Who said making armoured vehicles was hard?"

TBK_get_some_tanks: "Hire the Gryphon Company" 
TBK_get_some_tanks_desc: "There's armoured vehicles, and then there's proper armour. For that, we gotta pay. Fortunately, Vasile has some contacts in Griffonia who have some proper hardware. Let's see if the bats and their fancy training can get through this..."

TBK_raider_trucks: "Leave ´em In Dust!"
TBK_raider_trucks_desc: "Our mercenaries have really taken to these trucks! They've given them names, spraypainted all sorts of things on them, and upgunned them well beyond the bounds of common sense. Firepower, mobility, and a symbol to rally around: what's not to love?"

TBK_army_mass_assault: "Lust For Loot"
TBK_army_mass_assault_desc: "If there's one thing Tobuck has a limitless supply of, it's greed. They've all seen how rich you can get off scavenging and gun-running, so if we give them the cheapest guns we can find and then promise to let them pick their foes (and their friends!) clean, we'll barely have to pay 'em!"

TBK_actual_guns: "Locked and Loaded"
TBK_actual_guns_desc: "So what if Pea Shooter sold most of the Storm King's old guns? Who needs 'em? I heard you can put together a submachine gun out of piping and sheet metal in a backyard welding shop. Oh, fine, we'll also buy some rifles. What is Tobuck coming to that we have to import weapons?"

TBK_abundant_recruits: "Everyone's a Mercenary"
TBK_abundant_recruits_desc: "Can you hold a gun? Would you hold this one? Would you stand over there and shoot anypony who comes near for a few bits? Congrats, you're a mercenary! Who knew recruitment could be so simple?"

TBK_frenzied_horde: "Drugs and Booze For All!"
TBK_frenzied_horde_desc: "You mix some old-fashioned black powder into rum, that's pirate's brew. You mix some smokeless powder and cocaine, that's brown-brown. You drink some pirate's brew and snort some brown-brown, you'll be the most fearless pony alive!"

TBK_glory_to_deluge: "What's Yours Is Mine!"
TBK_glory_to_deluge_desc: "We're declaring open season on the enemy's... everything. The promise of unrestricted plunder will attract more low-lifes and rabble to our army, and nothing's more dangerous than a low-life with a gun and a motive."

TBK_victory_celebrations: "Endless Triumphs"
TBK_victory_celebrations_desc: "Hired guns love being told they've done a good job. We'll festoon them with medals, shower them with booze, and pretty soon our army will have the best morale in Zebrica!"

TBK_gather_weapons_desc: "There's more than enough guns still stashed in Tobuck to arm our forces, we just have to find them. Search the houses, order of the president. Search the sewers, the junkyards, search and grab every firearm and every bullet you can find!"

TBK_mercenary_gunsmiths: "Knick-Knack Smiths"
TBK_mercenary_gunsmiths_desc: "Mercenaries love their weapons, and they love personalising and customising them. Some spend so much time on their weapons, they become better gunsmiths than the actual gunsmiths! We should offer these fellows new jobs,away from the front lines, making weapons for their old squadmates."

TBK_capture_machines: "Grab Some Vehicles"
TBK_capture_machines_desc: "We've got cutpurses, we've got congriffs, we've got bandits, and soon enough we'll have carjackers too! We'll send our troops out to "acquire" some vehicles, doesn't matter the condition, and refurbish them into supply trucks and troop transports."

TBK_organised_scavenging: "Organised Scavenging"
TBK_organised_scavenging_desc: "Why make when you can take? We will gather the gunsmithing gurus of the mercenary bands together, and create a set of manuals on how best to scavenge and refurbish captured equipment, whether you got it from the enemy or a scrapheap or your own grandmother."

TBK_mercenaries_command: "All-Mercenaries Command"
TBK_mercenaries_command_desc: "Our troops are enthusiastic, but it takes more than enthusiasm to win wars. We'll have to organize them into a cetnralized command structure if we want to pull of anything but the most rudimentary of operations."

TBK_payment_policy: "Specify Payment"
TBK_payment_policy_desc: "We have a lot of mercenary contracts, and the last thing we want is to accidentally break one of them through carelessness. That's how you get shot. We'll gather together the bookkeepers of the republic's bureaucracy and some of our old money launderers to keep track of all these contracts, making sure our payments are on-time and dependable."

TBK_drive_up_recruitment: "Enlist Now To the Free Forces!"
TBK_drive_up_recruitment_desc: "Why die for patriotism when you can die for money? Okay, that's a bad way of putting it, but it's the core of our sales pitch. Soldiers of more legitimate states struggle to get by and have to follow rigid discipline. In Tobuck, you get all the benefits of going bandit without anycreature calling you a bandit!

### Air Force tree

TBK_air_force_start: "First Air-Platoon"
TBK_air_force_start_desc: "Just because Tobuck was known for having lots of guns doesn't mean that we can't try to do other things with them! If we can find some planes and tape our guns to them, suddenly we'll have a real airforce!"

TBK_air_superiority_focus: "Battles In the Clouds"
TBK_air_superiority_focus_desc: "With our fledgling airforce, it is important that we train our pilots to choose their battles. Prioritize picking off the weaker enemy aircraft and avoiding the line of fire from stronger ones, and not only will they live to see another day, but they'll get better at completing their missions too!"

TBK_ground_support_focus: "Assault From Above"
TBK_ground_support_focus_desc: "Shooting down to the ground is just as important as shooting at other planes. Our future CAS pilots must undergo some additional training in order for their duties to be performed in an acceptable manner."

TBK_cas_planes: "Close-Air Support Designs"
TBK_cas_planes_desc: "Of course, all the training in the world will do no good if there's no plane for our specialized pilots to fly. We've managed to scrounge up some blueprints to a basic support plane. With some study, maybe our engineers can build a better one in the future."

TBK_aquire_more_fighters: "Establish Additional Squadrons"
TBK_aquire_more_fighters_desc: "We haven't the faintest how he hid them for so long, but we found a farmer that was hoarding dozens of basic aircraft that he had built himself inside of his barns. It took a bit of convincing, but we've hired him to help design our future generations of fighters. He even agreed to turn his aircraft over to us to be used for military purposes."

TBK_naval_bombers: "Green Bay Bomber Wing"
TBK_naval_bombers_desc: "Unfortunately for us, one of the things we may have to worry about is having our ports blockaded. Coincidentally, one of our engineers has come up with quite the solution: A new type of bomber designed specifically to destroy ships."

TBK_air_academy: "Air Weapon Tactics"
TBK_air_academy_desc: "What luck! A former "laborer" from Chiropterra has approached us and claimed that she used to be one of the best pilots in Equestria of all places. She's asked for safe passage back to her homeland. [FROM.GetLeader] has agreed to do this, but in exchange, she will give some lessons to our pilots."

TBK_bomber_developments: "Bomber Plane Designs"
TBK_bomber_developments_desc: "TThere's been a new development lately: According to one of our advisors, a huge focus of our neighbors has been on developing better and more devastating bombers. After hearing of this, [FROM.GetLeader] has ordered that we also focus on designing better bombers so that we do not get left behind."

TBK_air_force_final: "Aces of Northern Zebrica"
TBK_air_force_final_desc: "Tobuck! Known for our supply of guns, but also now known for our... still fledgling airforce! We've even begun to attract some aviation experts from other countries. We have come a long way in such a short time, but there's still much more to learn as we continue building a proper airforce. At least our pilots can match the skill of our more developed neighbors."

TBK_air_assembly_line: "State Aircraft Company"
TBK_air_assembly_line_desc: "Surprisingly enough, a fledgling business devoted to aviation has popped up recently. Perhaps with some investment, we could convince them to help maintain our planes. Some of our aircraft have had some trouble holding themselves together mid-flight anyways."

TBK_radar_development: "R.A.D.A.R"
TBK_radar_development_desc: "Radios, communication of the future! And apparently great for getting an idea of what the enemy is up to, as well! Maybe we could get a few of these fancy new towers built around Tobuck if someone bothered to make some blueprints for them."

### Navy Tree

TBK_navy_start: "Piers of Tobuck"
TBK_navy_start_desc: "What do you mean our docks were only meant for trade? That's preposterous, the Storm King had used Tobuck as a weapons depot, it's only sensible that our shipyards be used for war as well."

TBK_cruiser_focus: "Open Maneuver Plans"
TBK_cruiser_focus_desc: "It's especially important in naval warfare to know who is doing what since the stakes are so high at sea. A few classes for our aspiring seafarers should help keep them coordinated so that they can better navigate around and protect one another."

TBK_submarine_focus: "Beneath the Waves"
TBK_submarine_focus_desc: "Shooting your enemy from afar is preferable. Shooting them while they can't see you is better. If our sailors can keep both of these tactics in mind, we will surely come out victorious in any engagement!"

TBK_naval_academy: "Cadet Academy"
TBK_naval_academy_desc: "It has come to our attention that very few of our seafarers actually possess the know-how to properly run a ship. Like it or not, they'll have to sit down and learn a few things if they want to sail the seas."

TBK_ship_dockyard_expansion: "Grand Naval Shipyards"
TBK_ship_dockyard_expansion_desc: "As we build more and more ships, we've begun to attract some of our citizens who hadn't shown any interest in the seas until recently. If we give them a place to work and some lessons to go with it, we'll have some of the finest shipwrights in Zebrica, maybe even the world."

TBK_battleship_designs: "Floating Fortress"
TBK_battleship_designs_desc: "As we make progress towards establishing our navy as a formidable force, the need for capital ships to spearhead them has become increasingly apparent. We don't expect to make many, but it would be an insult to our population if we didn't at least try."

TBK_destroyer_designs: "Small Ship Designs"
TBK_destroyer_designs_desc: "Destroyers! They make up the bulk of most navies, and ours will be no exception. First though, we'll need to actually put together a decent design for one. Somewhat recently, a destroyer from Maregypt had wrecked itself near our coastline. Maybe we can study that."

TBK_submarine_designs: "Submarine Hulls"
TBK_submarine_designs_desc: "Submarines! The silent killers of the sea. They're infamous for the amount of damage they can inflict upon bigger ships. It only makes sense that we should invest in them, seeing as some of our neighbors have larger navies than ours."

TBK_cruiser_design: "Ship Armour"
TBK_cruiser_design_desc: "Land-based airports have their uses, but mobile airports, ones that we can launch air raids from at nearly any location? Those can be incredibly useful. The fact that they can be heavily armored is a huge bonus. We still need to design them, of course."

TBK_navy_final: "Rule the Waves"
TBK_navy_final_desc: "Tobuck! Known for our supply of guns, but also now known for our... still fledgling navy! We've come a long way in such a short time, but there's still more to learn and discover as we become a real player in the sea. At the very least, our sailors can go hoof-to-hoof with the very best from across the world."

But as the trial concurs, the investigator at charge of the entire case asks the judge to pen a formal request to Equestria to imprison Pea Shooter.

tobuck_wallnut.1.b:0 "Baragzen's fun to be with."

tobuck_wallnut.2.t:0 "Who's Gonna Help Us?"
tobuck_wallnut.2.d:0 "It was early afternoon in The Salty Baron, a popular pub on the Tobuckian coastline near the border to Chiropterra. Being in such close proximity to those fanatics often led to interesting conversations about what went on beyond the warning signs tentatively scattered along the coast. \n\n"I hear they sacrifice zebras to their night gods!" Yelled one stallion, swinging a beer around to exaggerate his claim. \n\n"Oh yeah? I hear they summon monsters to foalnap our children in the middle of the night!" Shouted another, stumbling out of her chair. \n\nSoon the locals quickly became hysterical with their fears and claims of all the horrible going-ons inside of Chiropterra, despite the best attempts of the bartender to calm everyone down. Just as the bartender was about to consider extreme measures, he spotted something that made his heart drop into his stomach: a well-dressed thestral accompanied by a small entourage of armed ponies had entered his pub. A warlord's company, no doubt. For now, they seemed to be observing the chaos unfold.\n\nA voice in the crowd rose higher than the others, "Yeah! This place is done for! Who's gonna help us when the Chiropterrans come knocking to enslave us and our kin?!" \n\nThe thestral grinned, then spoke with a charismatic upturn, "Why, me of course!" \n\nMost of the pub turned to the stranger who had entered. Some were bewildered, others suspicious. "And who are you supposed to be?" One asked. \n\n"Lemme tell ya somethin'," said the thestral as he hopped onto one of the tables, "All the stories you were sayin' about Chiropterra? All true. Every one of 'em. I know this cause I, Wallnut Drive, escaped their clutches years ago. And that means there ain't nopony better suited to protect ya from them than me." \n\nWhether it was because of the alcohol or Wallnut's charming grin, the crowd seemed to accept his reassurances, much to the bartender's relief."
tobuck_wallnut.2.a:0 "Maybe he really does know what he's doing."

tobuck_wallnut.3.t:0 "Victory's Reward"
tobuck_wallnut.3.d:0 ""As you can see Generalissimo, the legionaries of Chiropterra have fled into... uh, sir? Should we come back later?"\n\nWallnut stood still as his tailor was measuring him for a new uniform. "Nonsense! Continue please." He grinned. He'd been hearing nothing but good things about his forces lately, and so he had decided to get a snazzy new outfit to celebrate his inevitable triumph. His lieutenants couldn't help but wonder why he had decided to do this in the war room of all places.\n\nSaid lieutenants briefly exchanged looks, then one of them continued, "Well sir, the remainder of Chiropterra's forces have fled into the countryside. Their leadership structure collapsed when we took their cities, and for the most part the cities themselves are fully intact. However, the majority of the armouries and arms silos were demolished before we could get to them, and-"\n\n"Hold that thought," interrupted Wallnut. He frowned, looking at the map of Chiropterra on the central table. A moment later, his eyes brightened up and he flashed a smile towards his lieutenants. "Is that one big hotel in the capital still intact? I think it was called the Dreamscape."\n\n"Uh, it should be? New Ayacachtli is relatively untouched. But I don't see how that's-"\n\n"Secure it immediately." Wallnut clasped his hooves together in excitement, much to the annoyance of his tailor who was still trying to get measurements.\n\nIf his lieutenants were confused before, they were now completely befuddled. "With all due respect, sir... why?"\n\nWallnut's grin grew wider and wider as his imagination went wild, "Because all victories need to be celebrated, of course. I have just the plan for it too...""
tobuck_wallnut.3.a:0 ""I'll host a party!""

tobuck_wallnut.4.t:0 "Two Old Thinkers"
tobuck_wallnut.4.d:0 "The celebrations had gone on long into the night, insomuch that some of the older folks were finding it hard to sleep. Dusk Wane was one such individual. His bones ached as he stepped out of the luxurious bed that had been provided for him. Surprisingly enough, being one of Chiropterra's less popular Moonspeakers had earned him an invitation to stay in Wallnut's palace. Though he found the apostate's blatant disregard for the Nightmare's teachings to be heretical, he couldn't help but feel that the young stallion was simply misguided, and that it wasn't too late for the warlord to change his ways. \n\n"Can't sleep either, comrade? Or do you even deserve to be called such?"\n\nDusk rubbed his eyes. In the hall was an elderly earth pony smoking a cigarette. Dusk recalled seeing him a few times before. Some old irredeemable marksist from Maregypt. Niftyn was his name, right? "These younger folks have more energy than I thought possible. I just need some air. So if you don't mind, I'll be on my way."\n\nNiftyn shook his head, "You'll find it difficult to find a quiet place in this palace, Dusk. I've known Wallnut for a long time. Every corner of this place will be lively until they all collapse from exhaustion."\n\n"Then why don't you go join them, 'comrade'? This hall could be a little less lively as it is."\n\n"I was never one for celebrations that do not include the poor and impoverished," Nifty took a puff of his cigarette, "There are still quite a lot of those here in Tobuck, far outside of the luxury of this palace."\n\n"There's far..." Dusk almost raised his voice, but then realized that he actually agreed with the other stallion's statement. He stepped over to rest against the same wall as Niftyn, sighing deeply, "Yes. Maybe we can agree on one thing." Dusk glanced over to the other stallion, who was holding out another cigarette in offering. Dusk chuckled and accepted it. "Maybe two things.""

"Dusk, this is a place where ponies go to celebrate, not fight. Wine is also very valuable when intact, and thus- Wait, do you hear that?"\n\nA long groan was heard from behind several large barrels towards the back of the cellar. The two comrades looked towards one another, then slowly peeked around the barrels. Therein laid an absolute mess of a pony, legs splayed out in all directions and several half-drunk wine bottles spilled both on the ground and on the uniform of the one and only Wallnut Drive. He opened his eyes, hiccuped, then half-grinned at the older ponies. "Hey guys... how are -hic- you?"\n\nDusk let out a long sigh. Was this truly what Tobuck had come to? A place where the 'important' ponies partied all day while riots broke out all around them? His bones ached just thinking about it. He offered a hoof to the drunken warlord, "Wallnut, are you all right?"\n\nWallnut flung his hoof in the general direction of Dusk's, but only connected on the third try. "Y-yeah, never -hic- better... whasabout yous?"\n\n"Wallnut, we're..." Niftyn couldn't help but picture where Tobuck might end up if Wallnut continued down this path. Or even if a united Tobuck could survive in this state. Regardless, he also helped the young warlord up, "...We're just tired. That's all."\n\n"Huh?" Wallnut rubbed his eyes, suddenly processing that his friends seemed to be more than just tired. "No, no... yer not. Please -hic- tell me whats I can do to help you feels -hic- better..."\n\nDusk and Niftyn looked at one another again. They could see in each other's eyes that both of them had the same idea.

Meanwhile Wallnut, also in the office as the leader, is filling in a crossword puzzle until he puts the paper down and offers his take. Jus have both!

There are some cultural ties, and some Zumidian leaders have expressed interest in joining with the up and coming Hazrumenian Union, although the Zumidians themselves seem quite divided on the matter.\n\nSome within our government have suggested we accept this deal, as Wallnut's interests align with ours in many ways, while others urge us to reject the deal and prepare to fight this Wallnut Drive, who they consider a petty warlord no matter how Harmonist his rhetoric.

Dusk personally considers him a buffoon but not a threat. No, the real threat is Niftyn, who has already gather hardline communists under his leadership in Tobuck. Even if they had shared a drink at the hotel, in truth they are too far opposed in ideology to truly cooperate. But a civil war is not good either.

In truth, the workers of Nightmare Steelworks had found it difficult to believe that the factory was actually reopening. When the time came to return to work, many of them were afraid of changes that could be imposed by the new government. Many more were shocked to see that the giant mural of Nightmare Moon above the front entrance had been stripped away, replaced with a much more somber art piece depicting a full moon in a starlit night sky. Even the name on the building had been changed; now it read 'Steel Moonworks.'\n\Their old boss had assured them that all the changes were made purely to comply with the new laws, but the workers still had their doubts. How could a new government that has torn down everything they believed in possibly have their best interest in mind?\n\nAs the workers approached the front entrance, a few well-dressed ponies exited the building. The well-dressed ponies introduced themselves to the workers, saying that they were with the United Labour Front. Many of the workers were confused and had inquired as to what that was.\n\n"A union meant to ensure the well-being of every labourer in Chiropterra! One of Dusk Wane's recently implemented programs!" they had explained. The workers seemed hesitant to believe them, but nicer and safer working conditions did sound appealing. Many of the workers stopped briefly to inquire further, figuring that the promises they were making seemed too good to be true.\n\nBut as they began their workday, it soon became clear that the new working conditions were much, much better than they used to be. Fear and worry dissipated almost instantly amongst them. One worker gave a last look to a wall where some graffiti of Nightmare Moon used to be. It was almost completely wiped away; only a faint remnant of the old faith remained."

Her local temple had been almost completely demolished, and when the time came to rebuild it, she was shocked when the new government had declared that Nightmare Moon had twisted their faith over the ages into a monstrosity. They said that all temples needed to be reshaped or reformed to depict the "old faith" of the rising Moon holding dominion over the night sky.\n\nPond had felt conflicted about this then, but when she had stepped back to think about all of the horrible things that her faith had done to those who rejected Nightmare Moon, she realized that she too had become prejudiced towards the nonbelievers.\n\nWhen she joined the volunteer efforts to rebuild the temple, both Pond and several of her old friends were surprised to see each other there. Pond had exclaimed that she had resolved to save the faith from its wrongdoings and to help bring the light of the Moon back to all who needed it.\n\nShe was brought out of her thoughts when a bell rang, signifying that the reconstruction workers, many of whom didn't even share her religion, were about to arrive for lunch. She hoped that at least this gesture of kindness could help atone for her own sins. Pond smiled at the hungry ponies as they entered the room."

tobuck_alesia.4.d:0 "Strolling the gardens of the presidential palace at night, Alesia thought back to what she'd seen earlier that day. Ponies and zebras gathered together outside for a ceremony honouring one of their gods, singing hymns together under the scorching Zebrican sun. These creatures had nothing: although Alesia's governance had rooted out much of the corruption and decadence of the criminal-elite, she was under no illusions. These creatures, her creatures, had no security, they had no heritage, they were surrounded by enemies, and most of them owned little more than the clothes on their backs. And yet they had their faith.\n\nPerhaps that was why the red devils hated religion so, she thought, gazing up at the moon. They could take home, family, property and nation away from honest creatures, but in order to truly break them they had to also take their gods. Alesia had never been a particularly religious mare, but she swore then and there that she would not run a secular state. Tobuck would be united in faith, just as soon as she had consolidated her rule enough to make it so.\n"And what shall I swear this to?" she mused aloud, remembering the moonlit rituals her family used to perform, so long ago."

Then, a servant walks to her quarters but she immediatelly recognizes she isn't someone from the staff and Alesia points a gun at her. The servant, calmly, explains she is a represenative of Chiropterran moonspeakers and they wish to talk with Alesia. The servant lays down an enclosed letter before Alesia and steps back. Alesia whistles for her guards who come in and capture the servant whilst she weights the letter in her hoof. She ponders for a while before making a choice."

And he bows to Alesia, as do rest of them. Confused, Alesia chuckles and says this was not the reaction she was expecting. The moonspeakers replies on the contrary, Alesia deserves respect for her achievements. For only a worthy individual and one infused with faith and blessing of the Moon could defeat Her Imperial Majesty's legions. Alesia scowls and tells the moonspeaker to get to the point. The moonspeaker nods and tells Alesia that they wish for her to rule over them, in the name of the Nightmare Moon. Entin and the guards stand dumbfounded, while Alesia just is frozen. The moonspeaker continues and says that her victory shows that Nightmare Moon must have blessed her and shown to the legions an error in their ways. The moonspeakers are ready to declare their loyalty to Alesia if she accepts to become the ruler. He adds that many of the legions will likely follow suite. Entin turns to Alesia and asks is she a damn Lunarist while Alesia stays silent. Entin presses her along until Alesia glares at him, shutting him down, and then looks to the moonspeaker. She says they would likely hate her reign, to which he shrugs and says it will then be will of the Moon. Alesia looks up to the night sky and, after a moment, huffs and tells the moonspeakers she accepts."

tobuck_alesia.24.d:0 "'HALT!' bellowed the feldfebel. 'Aten-SHUN!' Initially, upon being assigned command of a company of fresh troops for the Tsaritsa's Yasani Guard, he was insulted, thinking them little more than bullies and paramilitary thugs, hardly befitting a seasoned Severyanan exile officer such as himself. So far, however, they had exceeded his expectations. His little platoon of zebras was excellently well turned-out in their dark uniforms. The feldfebel was still amazed that they could possibly stand the heat in all black. Then again, they were Zarantian zebras, natives to these arid climes, and he wasn't. He was very supportive of their retention of the sword as a weapon alongside the rifle, feeling it preserved some shred of honour. The old colt admired a warrior who had the courage to wield one on a modern battlefield.\n\nThe troops had now formed into two files. They were in the front room of the local army headquarters, and several bureaucrats and top brass officers were peering from their offices down the hall towards them, to see what the noise was about. On the wall in front of the squad was a newly-installed painting of Her Imperial Majesty, the Tsaritsa. The feldfebel roared 'Left FACE!', quickly followed by 'Pre-sent ARMS!' and it was done in under a second. 'At my command, you will salute your Tsaritsa and pledge loyalty to her as long as you may live! Sa-LUTE!' The platoon roared back, in their strongly accented voices; 'WE SALUTE YOUR IMPERIAL MAJESTY, AND PLEDGE TO SERVE YOU UNTO DEATH!'\n\nAs they did, the underofficer dipped the colours and the feldfebel saluted with his sabre, following along with the salute and oath. As the echo from the hallway faded, the feldfebel shouted ;'Right then! Shoulder arms! Left face! By the left, quick march!' The platoon marched off, their hooves kicking characteristically high as they stepped. The feldfebel looked smugly at the desk workers withdrawing their heads back into their offices like snails into their shells. They were stuck here all day, pen-pushing and paper-stacking, yet he had the privilege to put his life on the line for Tsaritsa and company. He looked back to the marching zebras and thought; THOSE are the warriors I would choose on that day, the desk-dwellers can keep their comfortable cubicles." #sirnori

Chiropterran officials wish to continue the old labour system to its due end, citing it will enable for more rapid industrial reconstruction and also risks posed by freed labourers as potential security risk. Severyans argue that even a short reliance on slavery hinders the economic growth across the tsardom, especially as Tobuck continues to industrialize. In the end Alesia slams the convention table to call on a silence and offers her two bits. She states she finds the labourer system distasteful, for even Old Severyana had no slaves.

The judge has deemed the rents criminally high and has decreed those rents to be repaid back in full alongside next rent being free.

TBK_pea_gather_money_desc:0 "For the whole of history, gunrunning has been a very profitable business but the Fake Republic of Tobuck has been the only instance of the entire might of a state dedicated to such an activity. After the collapse of the Storm King's rampaging, Tobuck was left with a sizeable amount of weapons of war. Now, the only thing left on the agenda is to sell them and should they run out, we can always get a bit creative in wielding the power of a state we plan to give away.\n\nFor Pea Shooter however, it only matters insofar that he can funnel laundered money out of Tobuck. With his family out of danger and with no knowledge of his current business venture in Manehattan, he cannot just load a boat full of gold bars and piles of dirty cash and hope that Equestrian customs won't raise an eyebrow. So if he wants to retire in financial security, he needs to get clean money and get that money out of Tobuck before Zarantia comes knocking.\n\nCurrently, £infequip_text §[This.TBK_gun_pile_colour][?TBK_guns_pile]%§! of the guns remain.\n\nThere is £coin_text §Y[?root.TBK_dirty_money]§! million unfiltered money.\n\nPea Shooter has £coin_text §G[?TBK_pea_vault]§! million secured overseas."

One could have thought that after some lost pony conquered it, the whole edifice would have come tumbling down. Yet, the opposite happened. Dozens and then hundred of §Cmoonspeakers§! came around, seeking to sweep the dust and remove the cobwebs of the house of §YNightmare Moon§!. Faced with such a boiling desire for revival and renewal of the faith, §YAlesia§! has called a grand council to talk of matters of faith. Despite the allure of a great spiritual meeting between the §Cmoonspeakers§! and their new heraldess of dusk, the council is also at its core a matter of base politics. Two factions have emerged among the §Cmoonspeakers§! which §YAlesia§! will have to contend with according to her interests. Both seek a return to the spirit of the early days of the faith but couldn't be more different as how they seek to return to it.\n\nThe §gRevivalist§! believe that §CChiropterran§! society as a whole grew compromising and lax and so, as they seek the revival of §YNightmare Moon§!, their diagnosis is that the faith should be as she left it. Sacred traditions ought to be restored and stand unquestioned, protected by §Cmoonspeakers§! acting as guardians of the dogma.\n\nThe §FWaxists§! on the other hoof call upon the image of the waxing moon, explaining that it was the §Cmoonspeakers§! themselves rather than society who grew blinded by a twisted and erratic interpretation of the faith. As such, their sacred duty is to study the spirit of the fundamentals of the faith and find their way back to the heart of the §YNightmare Moon.§!\n\nIf the §gRevivalists§! are dominant, you will gain:\nWar Support: §G+5.00%§!\nReinforce Rate: §G+5.0%§!\n\nIf the §FWaxists§! are dominant, you will gain:\nStability: §G+5.00%§!\nCompliance Growth Speed: §G+5.0%§!"

Despite holding no discernable political view or ambition of his own, he just helps smooth things over. He's just that nice! He gives everypony a good time and you kind of forget what you were mad about. The only issue here is that the loveable face really does enjoy a good drink. Or three. At breakfast."

pea_shooter_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 17th of November 962 in Trottingham\n\n§YBiography§!: When Pea Shooter was just a foal, one could hardly picture the cheerful little one to become a gun runner. With a loving family, the loveliest of childhood crush turned happy wife and good prospect as a shipping merchant between St. Petershoof and Skyfall. But still, even with all of that, little Pea Shooter was bored.\n\nIt could have all ended with a simple middle-aged pony finding a hobby or drinking the occasional excessive cider but then came the Stalliongrad Revolution. His family's business was ruined but Pea Shooter saw an opportunity. With the help of a shady friend, he bought some guns from a Fezeran smuggler and travelled back home, selling them to a communist volunteer group. And also one Severyanan counter-revolutionary he had met in a bar. He made good bit on those deals and decided to make it his career. He travelled to Haukland, making some deals there before finding his way south, wherever there were bits and a need for gunpowder.\n\nIn 1005, he made his way to Zebrica, looking to make bank on that insane Yeti whilst he was still on a roll. He failed as the Storm King died and his conquest spree ended the following year. But! He was in Tobuck with some friends and it just so happened that one of those friends had friends guarding the supply depots in the region. And with half of Zebrica in turmoil, Pea Shooter exactly knew where to find his clientele.\n\nWith the help of Vasil Cel Tradat, he helped bring about the independence of Tobuck, the birth of harmonic republicanism in the region, found some pony to become its face while he became foreign affairs minister. As long as there was guns to sell in Tobuck, there would be business to do there for any good gun-runner.\n\nAnd Pea Shooter is more than a good one.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Bunnyshrubby"

TBK_great_pyre_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 4th of June 954 in Manehattan\n\n§YBiography§!: A selfless duty does not always bring glory and rewards to a soldier. Great Pyre witnessed this in 995, during the Severyana Revolution, where he fought as a sergeant in the Royal Guard. Only to be let go amongst other soldiers and officers for their actions in the fight against the communist revolutionaries. Instead of a peaceful life in Equestria, Great Pyre, bitter to the princess, left Equestria in the ranks of his fellow soldiers and joined with them in Zebrica as mercenaries, fighting not for glory but cold-hard cash.\n\n Yet service in the grand mercenary company was not enough for the ambitious stallion and he, with a core cadre of subordinates and local recruits, left to form their own mercenary band. This groud soon gained a ferocious reputation for their brutality and callous regard for life, bot theirs and the enemies. Rumours continued to swell, until across Northern Zebrica the company was dubbed the Band of Flayers: a name originally meant to mock their lust for loot to the point of looting the dead admist battle, Great Pyre eagerly adopted the name and further modified it by adding to it a motto. One which all members of the Band of Flayers adhered to.\n\n Down to the last fur!\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofuslied"

TBK_cherry_bomb_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 26th of June 972 in Equestria\n\n§YBiography§!:Cherry Bomb's family had made fireworks for generations, and nopony expected him to do anything else. At least not until the explosion. A giant novelty firecracker went off in his face when he was twelve, leaving him with a severe concussion, damaged hearing and a nervous twitch that never quite went away. Yet where others saw an accident, Cherry Bomb found his purpose.\n\nExperimenting with more and more extreme forms of explosives, he soon changed profession to developing explosives for the Equestrian military, only to be disillusioned with them as well due to their conservative approach. Instead, he left for abroad to offer his services as a freelancer. Whether it's in New Mareland blowing up Cockatrice nests, trying to sell the Brodfeld monarchy a new line of explosives or hobnobbing with Colthaginian patricians to secure funding for private arms factories, Cherry Bomb has done it all, and he prides himself on bringing explosions from the factory to the field.\n\nHis crew is a wild mix of all sorts of people, with Cherry Bomb having few qualms about who he works with. If you love explosives as much as he does, you'll have a job with his crew as they continue in their quest to discover and make use of every explosive in the world.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofuslied"

TBK_spell_stock_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 1st October 979 in Northern Wittenland\n\n§YBiography§!: Spell Stock was always a troublemaker, even as a child, and age has not mellowed him out. Though of noble Wittenlandic birth and great wealth, his proclivities - causing scandals wherever he went, harassing the serfs by sniping at them from his palace and hunting monsters rather than tending to his property - were always an eyesore even for the other nobles. It all came to a head with White Star's ascension to the throne. Many had hoped she'd put him straight, but instead Spell Stock surrendered his property to the crown for a sizable sum and left Wittenland.\n\nTaking to the road, he used his wealth to build up a cadre of fellow hunters with the goal to hunt every monster the world had seen. Yet, in a steadily worsening world, he started to wonder if it wasn't the sapient creatures who were the true monsters. If it was, that meant that his hunting list had expanded something fierce. What more, it turned out being a mercenary paid better than a freelance hunter.\n\nHaving just finished a stint in Skyfall, he's arrived in Zebrica with a brand new "Rarity For You" suit, a vastly expanded hunting cadre and a plan to get himself trophies of every kind of threatening beast the continent can offer, and why yes that ambiguity was quite intentional.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofuslied"

TBK_captain_z_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of March 968 in Colthage\n\n§YBiography§!: Once a highly respected Colthaginian officer, Bodzamal Aben commanded some of the nation's fiercest soldiers. He could have become a legend, but he made the mistake of going after the crime organisation known as the Tiger Syndicate. Though he scored several victories against them, corruption and moles within his unit led to him almost dying after being seduced by the wife of the Tiger Syndicate's leader.\n\nBarely escaping with his life, he saw how the fight against the syndicate slowly died out without him and bitterly concluded that they had patrician backing. He abandoned Colthage and has since become a gun for hire under the moniker "Captain Z". It was what he did best, and he liked doing it, so he decided it was time to make money off it instead of bleeding for a nation that seemed so willing to discard him.\n\nWhat more, one day he might have the money and the soldiers needed to go back and finish what he started. It's some ways off yet, but he's got a long time. The dead are patient, after all. \n\n§YPortrait By§!: Tofuslied"

 #### IDEAS ####
 LCT_defenders_of_the_east: "Defenders of the East"
 LCT_defenders_of_the_east_desc: "Lake City has always been the first point of contact between the Ponies and Griffons of Eastern Griffonia, leading to the lands being the frequent victim of Griffon raids. This long history of brutalization has instilled our Ponies with a sense of pride in holding back the hordes of Griffonkind."
 LCT_guilds: "Cehovi"
 LCT_guilds_desc: "The Merchant families of Lake City own several powerful guilds. These Guilds have a near monopoly on their specialities and can pull strings within the government and military, whilst also keeping the economy tightly under control."
 LCT_rising_militarism: "Rising Militarism"
 LCT_rising_militarism_desc: "The Lake City Army is relatively new, but has proven itself repeatedly against Griffon raiders. Over the last few decades, its influence among citizens and the government has grown, leading to the military having considerable influence over society. LCA troops are now present in every aspect of civilian life, with their proud grey uniforms dress in flowers from passing supporters. Ponies cheer and wave military flags as these brave mares and stallions pass. They are seen as the defenders of freedom, even if they plot the occasional assassination of elected officals."
 LCT_bloated_high_command: "Bloated High Command"
 LCT_bloated_high_command_desc: "With enough officers to manage a small country on their own, the massive inner circle of Lake City's military still projects power and prestige. To become a mere \"brigadni general\" is cause to turn a village upside-down in celebration. Fresh faces are picked to lead the army with strategies fit for a new century, while old beards are retained and venerated for their experience and wisdom from a century past.\n\nBut a long period of peace, as well as the social pressure of rising fast in the military coming to bear on a growing population, has made a burden out of Jezeragrad's high command. Bureaucratic elements have crept in to keep the inner circle from falling apart in the throes of office politics, and quick thinking has been slowly abandoned as every pony on board—with their hefty salaries and egos—wants to have a say on where Lakeponies must strike next."

 LCT_military_politics0: "Military Involvement in Politics - Total"
 LCT_military_politics0_desc: ""
 LCT_military_politics1: "Military Involvement in Politics - Extreme"
 LCT_military_politics1_desc: "To be a valiant warrior is the peak of Lakeish culture, at least in its glory days. Was not Blessed Sword both a princely warrior and a warrior prince?\n\nBut in modern times, this ancient glorification of the army has created unsavoury realities. Bloodlines that can trace themselves to generals hoof-picked by Blessed Sword and his successors, along with new players born and bred in the murky trials of mercenary companies and those who have just amassed as many guns and hooves as they could, have been Jezeragrad's shadow mayor for as long as the republic has been alive. Fraud and embezzlement occur on a regular basis, with a new squad of soldiers to make up for the sudden disappearance of a thousand coins; death threats against representatives boast a high success rate when the agitators have dozens of guns and a few tanks pointed at your face.\n\nAs a result, participating in the political process is either asking for persecution or just going through the motions, for the generals and their officers make sure that there are no real alternatives on the list."
 LCT_military_politics2: "Military Involvement in Politics - Severe"
 LCT_military_politics2_desc: "To fight for Jezeragrad—to be willing to die for the Lake—is a duty held in a most high esteem. The Grand Princes of old have set the tradition, and the earliest Grand Mayors of this present republic were fashioned from the warrior caste.\n\nIt is no surprise, then, that, in a nation where military service is chief among all, the political landscape is riddled with concessions to the military. There are more than a few who do stand up to these excesses, and the army themselves have a sense of not being so brazen as to set selfish yet experienced mercenaries on a higher standing than a diligent public servant, but even if you remove the symptoms of corruption, it cannot be denied that at the root of it is the indivisible union of soldier and state, birthed a thousand years ago.\n\nReforms and true change have begun to blossom, but the road ahead is long."
 LCT_military_politics3: "Military Involvement in Politics - High"
 LCT_military_politics3_desc: "To sign up for the military is to climb Lake City's socio-political ladder. While there is lip service to the meritocratic ideal of a government position, superiors will have much reason to believe that somepony with multiple tours of service under their belt is more deserving of the seat than anypony else, regardless of said pony's political experience.\n\nThat is not to mention whether those superiors have much political experience themselves or were put there because they, too, used to serve in the army. Perhaps they still do."
 LCT_military_politics4: "Military Involvement in Politics - Medium"
 LCT_military_politics4_desc: "Lake City's army wields substantial influence in its nation's politics. Parties tailoured for their cause, the presence of cliques hiding away in remote parts of the countryside, and officers possessing a direct line to elected politicians—votes may count, but the ones counting the votes have guns."
 LCT_military_politics5: "Military Involvement in Politics - Low"
 LCT_military_politics5_desc: "Other countries have dabbled with the concept of separating the church and the state. In Lake City's case, they have successfully done something else: separating the military and the state.\n\nOf course, the military still performs its duty of defending every Lakepony in the land, and there will always be parties that bring to national attention the voices of the common soldier. However, the cushy positions clueless officers used to take are now headed by competent experts who listen to what everyday civilians want and need.\n\nLake City can rest, knowing that its soldiers are fully dedicated to walking the Soldier's Path without any distractions."

 LCT_reprimanded_industrialists: "Reprimanded the Cehovi"
 LCT_reprimanded_industrialists_desc: "Many are the failings of the Cehovi against Lake City, legal and moral; their reckoning was long overdue.\n\nWhile reprimanding them has encountered some resistance, most of the guilds have complied. It will take time for their workers to get used to their new freedoms, but knowing that the government cares for the downtrodden backbone of Lakeish society will energise them to work with pride and joy."

 LCT_gift_for_lords_baubles: "A Gift For Lords"
 LCT_gift_for_lords_baubles_desc: "Under the tradition of providing occasional gifts and donations to high officers, Star Talent and Flaming Hot have received a steady stream of baubles, enough to put a noticeable strain on our industry.\n\nAmong Star's requests were high-tech radio equipment from Equestria. Flaming Hot's requests, though, bordered immaturity: the latest automobiles and foreign alcohol from griffon countries like Feathisia."
 LCT_gift_for_lords_money: "A Gift For Lords"
 LCT_gift_for_lords_money_desc: "Under the guise of earmarking it for defense spending, vaults of money have been \"donated\" to Westerly Leeward and Smoke Signal. The development of Smoke's monstrous weapons of the future is understandably a long-term development, so results here will be moot for now, but Westerly has already stashed away his money for the next step of the Lords' plan, whatever that may be."
 LCT_gift_for_lords_land: "A Gift For Lords"
 LCT_gift_for_lords_land: "Under the auspices of military-led land reform policies, Daring Dream and Solid Rocks have sent in several squadrons to secure certain strategic locations, possessing resources or trade hubs. Solid has exhorted local leaders to fortify their defences, while Daring has provided them with extensive emergency response plans."

 LCT_western_menace: "The Western Menace"

 LCT_cehovi_assets_seized: "Cehovi Assets Seized"
 LCT_cehovi_assets_seized_desc: "With their assets frozen then transferred to the government, and their personnel purged from public office and key military positions, the recalcitrant guilds have learned their place: they serve the nation and its divine army, not the other way around."
 LCT_consumer_goods_cutback: "Consumer Goods Cutback"
 LCT_consumer_goods_cutback_desc: "In the days of Grand Prince Blessed Sword, the average peasant had the luxury of living in peace, confident in the assured victory of his troops.\n\nBut war has changed drastically, becoming a contest of national strength. Faced with the risk of much more than a loss of prestige, our citizens must put away anything that encumbers the army and their operations. Their lives must be given for the sake of total victory, even at home."
 LCT_military_industrial_complex: "Military Industrial Complex"
 LCT_military_industrial_complex_desc: "In factories all over, the smell of gunpowder fills the air. Take off to the streets outside and you'll see nothing but austere clothing or no clothes at all, with everypony rushing to their plants and mills. Go into the urban suburbs or the rural villages and inside tiny homes, little industries have sprung up, of mothers sewing uniforms and foals collecting garbage around town to be fed back into the factories.\n\nThe nation is many thousands-strong, armed to the teeth with one enemy in mind."
 LCT_conscription_quotas: "Conscription Quotas"
 LCT_conscription_quotas_desc: "Across the country, each and every conscription office has been given the easy and simple task of conscripting a specific percentage of their local area's population each month, without failure, and with no room for error. This should boost our ponypower beyond what we previously thought possible!\n\nNobody should be upset about having to fight in our army, right?"
 LCT_forced_PoW_labor_idea: "Forced PoW Labor"
 LCT_forced_PoW_labor_idea_desc: "Thanks to the Jezeragrad Development Board, our workforce has been bolstered by griffons we've captured from the battlefield. Stirred by the promise of a safer life in our new empire should they fulfill over a decade of faithful service, these fresh faces have attained an industrious nature."
 LCT_forced_PoW_labor_idea2: "Forced PoW Labor"
 LCT_forced_PoW_labor_idea2_desc: "The Jezeragrad Development Board has given our griffon POWs more productive work: the field of construction. Factories, barracks, and other facilities crucial to the war effort can now be churned out faster, especially with those interesting claws of theirs.\n\nIn relation to the above, the Board has also allowed scaffold-less construction for griffon-only construction teams, given that all of them have wings."
 LCT_bomb_to_oblivion_idea: "Bomb Them To Oblivion"
 LCT_bomb_to_oblivion_idea_desc: "The Herzland is burning; the home of the Empire, in flames.\n\nThat very image is enough to send griffons in full retreat, and while a recent republican revolution has made it a familiar sight, the Lake Army will guarantee that Griffenheim and its territories shall finally descend into ashes."
 LCT_battlefield_victories_idea: "Battlefield Victories"
 LCT_battlefield_victories_idea_desc: "No more shall we depend solely on the distant victories of our forefathers to mature as soldiers. Our stratagems have been flawless, the only result you will get when you base your methods on the spirits and their Soldier's Path.\n\nIt also means that the Six Lords' jingoistic posturing has paid off. Among the populace, there is no doubt now about the Lake Army's brilliant future. Any and all lines can and will be crossed if victory and glory are assured."
 LCT_battlefield_victories_idea2: "Battlefield Victories"
 LCT_battlefield_victories_idea2_desc: "Even if we once granted the impossible possibility that some did not believe in our inevitable triumph, the recent prisoner parades have all but trounced such impure unbelief. Now that the spoils of war are no longer mere headlines but solid realities that the common pony can touch, our collective faith in victory has never been this unwavering."
 LCT_final_push_idea: "The Final Push"
 LCT_final_push_idea_desc: "For centuries, the ponies of the Riverlands have suffered in complacent slumber, willingly submitting to the whims of feathered scoffers waving their unclean robes and scepters in the air.\n\nNot anymore. Griffenheim and the land of the Empire—the heart of ponykind's demons—will be made pure with an ablution absolute."
 LCT_national_panic_idea: "National Panic"
 LCT_national_panic_idea_desc: "The unthinkable has happened: the griffons have not only stalled out our offensive, they've turned the tide and rolled into the lake's precious lands. Village after village have been visited by the winged terror, with our valorous troops unable to stop the incoming flood of blood.\n\nThis has thrown all of the Lake Army into a state of alarm. It may not be long until the griffons roll into Jezeragrad for a sacking greater than 752..."
 LCT_national_panic2_idea: "National Panic"
 LCT_national_panic2_idea_desc: "The propaganda efforts led by Star Talent have at least turned the state of mania into a much more manageable problem. Enough panicking has been done for now; what can be done is for ponies to hold the line and hope for the best.\n\nBut if worse comes to worst, we can take comfort in dying for ponykind everywhere."
 LCT_mass_conscription_idea: "Mass Conscription"
 LCT_mass_conscription_idea_desc: ""Ask me to paint a picture of a day here, and I will tell you that the lights of home have gone out. The doctor I've been seeing took up a rifle and left. The fervent priest by the shrine across the road also left. Even the brass band I took part in when I was younger, that old band stretching back a hundred years... I heard they, too, have laid down their brass for steel.\n\n"But I visit the shrine still, pass through the barren gates and arches. Know this, love, that perhaps I can still be with you, wherever you are, purifying our land clean from foreign devils."\n\n- An excerpt from a diary of a disabled stallion shortly before his conscription into the army. His wife is missing in action."
 LCT_mass_conscription2_idea: "Mass Conscription"
 LCT_mass_conscription2_idea_desc: "Gone are simple oaths to the spirits for the defense of the homeland. Every able body in the nation is now expected to put in the work on fortifying the front through trenches, strongholds, and other means of defense. Far-off villages have seen ditches and moats suddenly spring up around their houses, while those in the cities have barricaded their windows and sandbagged their doors.\n\nLet the demons try and take Lake City!"
 LCT_no_step_back_idea: "No Step Back"
 LCT_no_step_back_idea_desc: "Every inch forward for the griffons shall be made costly. If they get past the trenches, the forts shall meet them. If they get past the forts, the traps and bombs shall meet them. If they get past the traps and bombs, the bastions of villages shall meet them. If they get past the villages, the outer cities and their guns shall meet them. If they get past the outer cities, Jezeragrad shall meet them.\n\nA hundred million shall be united in death before we submit to the griffons!"
 LCT_widespread_griffon_hate_idea: "Widespread Griffon Hate"
 LCT_widespread_griffon_hate_idea_desc: "The barbarian holds it claws high, clutching the bloody heart of a pony's chest cut open. It feasts, unable to reason any higher than the base instincts of the flesh. Though it bedecks itself with crowns and books, its disguise is flimsy, barely hiding the insatiable lust for blood.\n\nMaybe they are creatures, maybe they are not. All the same, the only method of answering their malevolence is to answer in kind."
 LCT_last_stand_idea: "Our Last Stand"
 LCT_last_stand_idea_desc: ""Though the griffons line us up and slash our throats, the forests and the plains remain. The Lake remains."\n\n- An unknown Lakeish soldier during the 752 sacking of Jezeragrad"

 LCT_herzland_plunder_idea_desc: "Take everything not bolted down! It's all ours! Every single little thing! Hahahaha!\n\n... It's not banditry, alright? That's... different. Look, it's good because WE'RE doing it, that's the point here."
 LCT_crackdown_idea: "Crackdown On Herzlanders"
 LCT_crackdown_idea_desc: "Being a Herzlander is now §RILLEGAL§!.\n\nOkay, not really, but if you're caught celebrating or otherwise indulging in Herzlander-like activities, you're getting at the very least a police visit. Can't have these griffons getting too rowdy when we're already dealing with all these 'resistance fighters', after all."

 LCT_heavenly_snow_idea_desc: "Heavenly Snow used to be a modest stallion. While he was born to a magistrate and therefore technically of noble blood, he lived far from the center of political scheming, growing up in Coltljevo. After graduating from a respectable college, he spent his days helping govern the city, later on using his savings to fund his own little cafe in Coltljevo proper. On some days, especially holidays, he himself would work as a barista: a magistrate's son serving coffee projected one-of-a-kind humility.\n\nBut the princely coup struck his old life dead. He was to ascend to the Ramonda Throne in Jezeragrad, being the heir apparent from Grand Prince Blessed Sword's line. They had centuries of tradition to learn from; Snow would know and do everything in no time. In quick succession, every eye turned to him for guidance. Great titles and lands were provided to his family, the zealous army swore their allegiance to him, and its own company of tutors and teachers showed up to instruct him in the ways of Blessed Sword, announcing to the world that the River Empire had returned.\n\nBut for all that, the Grand Prince hardly reigns over his own life. Wild Tree and his underlings push on Snow ambitions that he wishes he can outright refuse, ungratifiable desires that he hopes he can burn to nothing. But he can do nothing. Any protest of his is never made public, for any hideous success the armies earn shall be his in the eyes of every adoring Lakepony...\n\n...and any catastrophic failure shall be his, his alone."

He would rather prefered to see them hanged, or cowering under the might of the Grand Prince. But... times change, and so do tactics. Insteed of cowing them all into submission, Wild Tree has considered and gone through with the plan of diplomacy, thinking that this should offer the realm more stability in the long run."

LCT_rearrange_corporate_interests_desc: "Wild Tree will have to conduct more negotiations with important businessmen and corporative executives if he wants to get the economy back on track, and that is exactly what he'll do. He will offer favours that may not exactly need to be repaid, and one-sided agreements that take inspiration from a quote he had once heard; "Speak softly, and carry a big stick.""

LCT_seize_uncooperative_cehovi_assets: "Seize Uncooperative Cehovi Assets"
LCT_seize_uncooperative_cehovi_assets_desc: "Even with all of this peaceful progress Wild Tree has made, he has even his own limits. Some of the Cehovi offer demands that are far too stringent for him. Unfortunately for them, Wild Tree knows exactly how to deal with these scum. Once they're penniless and without a single property to their name, they'll beg the Grand Prince for his support.\n\nGood. Let them beg."

LCT_old_habits: "A More Direct Rulership"
LCT_old_habits_desc: "Weaker wills may not put up with our demands for non-negotiable loyalty to the Grand Prince. Wild Tree will take direct control of state apparatus to exterminate incoming threats to the Prince's life and power."

LCT_i_am_the_army: ""I Am the Army""
LCT_i_am_the_army_desc: ""Divided troops are a brittle blade," once said the wise Grand Prince Blessed Sword, and this remains true today. Soldiers of the questioning sort will be monitored, rooted out; only those under Wild Tree's command and approval shall pass. Lake City will not burn in a squabbling army's crossfire."

LCT_purge_the_lords: "Purge the Lords"
LCT_purge_the_lords_desc: "The Six Lords would've been a powerful ally in our coup had they not shown destructive tendencies for anti-griffon fever. Now, their far-reaching influence will prove to be a hindrance should they disagree with the Grand Prince's designs. It's only a matter of time..."

LCT_ban_on_protesting_desc: "Evil hides in the dark, so don't go there. Wild Tree has talked of setting up curfews to kill off any prolonged resistance. Anypony up past midnight or earlier will be risking a great deal under the watch of our national guard."

LCT_blow_up_neighsayers: "Blow Up Dissenters"

LCT_permanently_imprison_neighsayers_desc: "Kill too many terrorists, you mass-produce inspirational martyrs.

LCT_new_ponies: "New Ponies"
LCT_new_ponies_desc: "Relying on old blood will do nothing but corrupt our state with the greedy and the stupid. Their long-term positions have resulted in complacency and stagnation, and though there are some voices arguing for the idea that they would be loyal for this fact on its own, they may just as easily jump ship, tucking their tails between their legs and extracting their wealth out of the nation before we can use it. Instead, we will award the young and the bold with fantastical promises of wealth and land, and with a new generation comes a new opportunity to strengthen our grip."

## Past Intermission 1

LCT_monetary_rewards: "Monetary Rewards"
LCT_monetary_rewards_desc: "Some may question the veracity of giving these new ponies in charge cash when our economy is in a... questionable state. However, small bribes go a long way in making sure that a state is prosperous, though we certainly won't call them that. Instead, they will be seen as rewards for loyalty and fanaticism, and those most loyal will reap the most wealth."

LCT_land_rewards: "Land Rewards"
LCT_land_rewards_desc: "With vast tracts of land now dispossessed of their original owners, there is no one better to own them than the loyal mares and stallions under our supervision. Those with previous experience in governing will take priority, of course, but preference will also be given to those whom we know can be relied upon in our hour of need - and our hour of need is constant."

LCT_bribe_the_corrupt: "Bribe the Corrupt"
LCT_bribe_the_corrupt_desc: "Some stains, unfortunately, can sometimes be impossible to cleanse completely. A few senior members of our government, most of them highly skilled in speechcraft, have loyalties that are only as deep as the weight of gold in their pockets. If that gold is ours, they will happily serve as mouthpieces to keep the populace placated. All they need is a gentle push..."

LCT_keep_the_fools: "Keep the Fools"
LCT_keep_the_fools_desc: "There have been a few voices in the government clamoring for a total, government-wide purge of incompetent elements. They have a point - incompetence leads to inefficiency, which leads to the downfall of a nation. Some fools, however... certain administrators, governors, senior officers, bureaucrats and similar, are more than happy to revel in their luxurious positions and do nothing, gladly implementing whatever measures and policies we wish so long as they get to keep their heads down. For a chosen few, they will receive this privilege."

LCT_the_old_guard: "The Old Guard"
LCT_the_old_guard_desc: "The dukes and counts, with their vast stores of wealth and influence long sidelined by a wayward democracy, should be given our full attention. An army, no matter how popular, cannot run on red-blooded patriotism alone."

LCT_grant_titles_and_honour: "Grant Titles and Honour"
LCT_grant_titles_and_honour_desc: "The republic's establishment sent many a royal bloodline into decay and obsolescence, doomed to be forgotten. Not anymore. If they are to serve the Grand Prince well, they must do so as the nobles they truly are."

LCT_a_grand_ball: "A Grand Ball"
LCT_a_grand_ball_desc: "High Command may detest fancy ponies dancing around for their own amusement, but if these same ponies are to be true bluebloods, then they are free to revive even the most "trivial" of traditions if it upholds their status.  A good waltz won't harm anypony, at least."

LCT_landed_estates: "Landed Estates"
LCT_landed_estates_desc: "Mayors of old have requisitioned many ancient manors for their possessions to be sold off for "the common good". This disgrace will not be tolerated. As befits their station, the nobles shall have their lots restored, with all the grandeur and the responsibilities that come with it."

LCT_indentured_servants: "Indentured Servants"
LCT_indentured_servants_desc: "It's a folly to assume that everyone is fit to participate in the governing of a country. Former "voters" who don't have the right mind or heart to have a say in policy-making can still prove their usefulness as maids, butlers, and food tasters."

# HEAVENLY SNOW: INTERMISSION ONE

LCT_refurbish_blessed_sword_palace: "Refurbish the Blessed Sword Palace"
LCT_refurbish_blessed_sword_palace_desc: "For the past three hundred years, the Blessed Sword Palace has served as nothing but a tourist attraction to Lake City, uselessly wasting away its foundations for foreigners and outsiders wanting to visit our landmarks and observe our frayed history. No more! No expense will be spared to turn it into a worthy capital for our growing empire; every engineer and architect will be brought to bear the weight of their knowledge upon the building, turning it from a glorified money-maker to a Palace."

LCT_ancient_katana_blessed_sword: "The Blessed Sword"
LCT_ancient_katana_blessed_sword_desc: "Blessed Sword's emperorship began with the famous drawing of his katana, a golden blade vibrating with power and royalty that has remained in the treasury of the nation for over a thousand years. It is a symbol of everything Lakeish culture stands for, and we have to make sure it's in working condition before our grand prince can wield its glory."

LCT_get_on_the_throne_snow: "Of Paramount Importance"
LCT_get_on_the_throne_snow_desc: "A certain someone isn't cooperating with us as well as we'd like. Not showing up to meetings, acting withdrawn and confined to himself, and generally being a nuisance on the public stage. His name? Heavenly Snow. Our future emperor.\n\nWild Tree will have a word with him."

LCT_royal_steward_wild_tree: "The Grand Prince's Glorious Helper"
LCT_royal_steward_wild_tree_desc: "Who else but Wild Tree is fit to serve as the prince's closest companion, and most trusted advisor? Of course, with the prince's will, he will be approved as the nation's steward, being able to act in accordance to the nation's goals, with ample amounts of power available to use. Not that he can ever override the prince, of course, but... he can be there to push the nation on when the prince's tireless willpower runs dry."

LCT_ceremony_jezeragrad_lake: "A Thousand Heavenly Years of Rule"
LCT_ceremony_jezeragrad_lake_desc: "It is customary for every prince and emperor to proclaim their rulership on the lake itself, a float constructed and placed upon the lake during the night when the moon is full, and with fireworks to celebrate. The emperor - or rather prince, in this case, names each and all of his ancestors and asks them for their benevolent guidance to the monarch's rule, to oversee that they will not fail. And Snow will not fail."

LCT_military_advisorship: "The Troops of the Grand Prince"
LCT_military_advisorship_desc: "The military played an integral role in the restoration of Lake City's monarchy. It comes as no surprise, then, when many of the grand prince's new staff and advisory roles are filled up by current of former military personnel. Their experience in the coup and in the military hierarchy will give the country a crucial leg-up it needs over its neighbours. All Snow has to do is greet them into the administration."

LCT_heavenly_restoration: "The Heavenly Restoration"
LCT_heavenly_restoration_desc: "The nation is now taking its first steps towards true greatness. Though the sword has been drawn and Snow has been reigned in as the prince, he must now hold a speech in front of the entire nation, declaring and pledging his infinite loyalty and wisdom to serve the cause of Blessed Sword, and reunite the empire that lay before him.\n\nLet's hope he doesn't stutter."

LCT_sixlords_autofocus_tt: "It's time for some REAL change..."

LCT_solid_like_rock: "Solid Like Rock"
LCT_solid_like_rock_desc: "To snuff out any Griffonian chance to repeat the fall of Jezeragrad, Solid Rocks has proposed to strengthen our Longsword border. No griff will be allowed to take an inch of our soil."

LCT_martial_law: "Issue the Vanredni Dekret"
LCT_martial_law_desc: "The Vanredni Dekret or \"The Extraordinary Decree\" ostensibly declares a state of emergency, temporarily shuttering most civilian functions until further notice. When you’ve already couped the existing government, however, it’s just a convenient broom with which to sweep the unimportant stuff (like festivals and bureaucracy) away."

LCT_cut_civil_regulations: "Empower the Žandarmerija"
LCT_cut_civil_regulations_desc: "For the sake of a united army, overreaching freedoms must be curtailed. Our gendarmerie will be allowed to arrest dissidents without due process, flush out gatherings of pro-griffon sympathizers, and ask your neighbor nicely in the dead of night where they’d been the whole day and why, among other things..."

LCT_our_talented_industry: "Force an Economic Miracle"
LCT_our_talented_industry_desc: "What better way to shape a grand Lakeish tomorrow than through iron and steel? The modern mills of today form Star Talent’s plan to put our untapped lands into the military game."

LCT_dream_of_lake_army: "Dream of a Lake Army"
LCT_dream_of_lake_army_desc: "All the guns and machines in the world will come to waste without a steady stream of hooves to bring them to life, so said Daring Dream as of late. A wider-reaching draft should be more than enough to realize her Lakeish dream."

LCT_where_theres_smoke: "A Thousand Smoking Guns"
LCT_where_theres_smoke_desc: "Smoke Signal has connections to black-market arms dealers in Longsword, and while their weapons aren’t exactly top-notch, they will more than suffice. It also goes without saying that said dealers possess enough materials to assemble some mean cannons." #Last sentence does admittedly need some more work to read well.

LCT_all_hands_on_deck: "A Garrisoned State"
LCT_all_hands_on_deck_desc: "Re-assign the workers from toasters to tanks, send the young mares on trains speeding to the front, and order the stallions to pilfer our granaries and warehouses for supplies. Our country will not have a military base; it will become one."

LCT_no_more_civil_government: "Dissolve the Skupština"
LCT_no_more_civil_government_desc: "The Skupština only represents the average Lakeish citizen; it does not exhort him or her to secure a brighter future. From now on, every organ of government will be run by the Lake Army to spur all ponies towards something greater."

LCT_mass_propaganda: "Amass the Media"
LCT_mass_propaganda_desc: "With Star Talent commandeering the printing presses, fiction and non-fiction will be replaced by the undeniable truth of propaganda. Soon, every Lakepony shall flow in concert, plumbing deep together like our own lake."

LCT_utilise_latent_xenophobia: "Exploit Western Exploitations"
LCT_utilise_latent_xenophobia_desc: "The twin orders of Hellquill and Longsword oppress our fellow ponies as second-class citizens at best, slaughtering them en masse at worst. However, that fact is the perfect brain fodder for the Lakeish herds who’ll happily march west to liberate our brethren."

LCT_deponya_to_flames: "The Ten-to-One Plan"
LCT_deponya_to_flames_desc: "The unfortunate truth is that backwards Deponya is ripe for taking by their neighbor Hellquill. Still, Flaming Hot suggests lulling [HLQ.GetLeader] into a false sense of security by letting him occupy our friends before we cut his divisions off.\n\nFlaming assures us he’ll inform [DEP.GetLeader] first, though."

LCT_deponyan_western_forts: "Fort Lake-Deponya"
LCT_deponyan_western_forts_desc: "The squabbling griffons will find in Deponya and Lake Army a new, united enemy that is tough, sharp, and dangerous. They will dash themselves dead against our modern metal walls long before they set a single claw on pony ground."

LCT_force_deponya: "The Future is Now, Old Country"
LCT_force_deponya_desc: "While the Lake army is the first and bravest army in the Riverlands,  it would be suicide to tackle the griffons on our own. A suitable ally must be found in Deponya; they have valuable ponypower and resources which we’ll put to good use, whether they’ll like it or not."

LCT_anti_griff_research:0 "Anti-Griffon Warfare"
LCT_anti_griff_research_desc:0 "The flames of war have finally arrived to Lake City, seeing our brave soldiers engaged against their Griffon foes in a struggle for our very survival. As part of this conflict, we've seen an influx of Griffon POWs into our lands. With this in mind, we must convert Fort Breeze into a prison camp and change the focus of their research towards studying the weaknesses of our foes."

LCT_ten_minutes: "Ten Minutes"
LCT_ten_minutes_desc: "Ten minutes is all we can spare to play with these griffons. We can run over them like a cart over a pebble, and prove our effectiveness and power to our people. They will surely support us then!"

# SIX LORDS: PHASE TWO

LCT_great_victory: "Jezeragrad Triumphs"

LCT_hunt_honchos: "Hunt the Honchos Down"
LCT_hunt_honchos_desc: "Nobles, knights, Reformisten—every griff that has called the shots over the systematic degredation and massacre of our fellow kind will be rounded up and shot. That the firing squads will consist of solely Hellquillian and Longswordian ponies is not a coincidence."

LCT_propagandise_success: "Ost-Griffonia is Gone..."
LCT_propagandise_success_desc: "Vostani Jezeragrad! The madness that is Hellquill and Longsword has been slain. This calls for many speeches and celebrations!"

LCT_lift_vartai: "Vartai Reconstruction Council"
LCT_lift_vartai_desc: "The cursed griffons couldn’t (or chose not to) keep up with the times, leaving their pony populations to suffer in squalor. This will not stand as long as we’re here."

LCT_longswordian_horrors: "Longswordian Horrors"
LCT_longswordian_horrors_desc: "All the gruesome rumors surrounding the Longswordian Genocide have been proven true. And then some. It is only right that our ponies know the true extent of this would’ve-been extermination."

LCT_conscription_quota: "...the Herzland is Next"
LCT_conscription_quota_desc: "Conquering Ost-Griffonia was our boot camp, as it has only moved our frontline a few hundred miles forward. The lives we’ve saved will be blessed with their shared duty to eliminate all threats to our kind’s existence."

LCT_a_few_paragons: "A Few Paragons"
LCT_a_few_paragons_desc: "While griffons make up the face of our enemy, it is only because our enemy is the Empire, who happens to wear a beak. The truth is, not all griffons have been complicit in the Empire’s crimes. And if that doesn’t convince our officers to get a few griffs into our ranks, the numbers advantage certainly will."

LCT_griffons_have_no_place: "They Have No Place"
LCT_griffons_have_no_place_desc: "If even one griff grabs enough power here, who knows if they won’t sow the seeds for another Reformisten or another Longswordian Genocide? No, the griffons must know where they stand, and that is far away from the nearest rifle."

LCT_party_like: "Kolo da Igramo!"
LCT_party_like_desc: "The griffons’ cowardly retreats and surrenders has led to tons of looting in Vartai, with stolen luxuries fetching high prices and warm smiles.\n\n This isn’t a problem: We’re the ones doing the looting anyway! Come on, Jala, and dance with us!"

LCT_good_ol_days: "Three Hundred Years of Summer"
LCT_good_ol_days_desc: "From 66 to 352, the Lakeish army reigned undisputed in Eastern Griffonia. It is only natural that we recall these days, drawing strength from our ancient warrior spirits, to impassion our future westward."

LCT_high_on_war: "Sustaining the Soldier’s Way"
LCT_high_on_war_desc: "Put Vojnika, or "The Soldier’s Way," is an ancient code of conduct, instilling in our warriors the virtues of discipline and submission. With another drawn-out battle in the horizon, this country will be nothing but the ideal soldier, and they’re already hankering for it."

LCT_onwards_to_glory: "Onwards to Glory"
LCT_onwards_to_glory_desc: "This is it; the road to the Herzland and its foul Empire lies before us. O foul griffon menace, hear our cry!\n\n"To battle, go forth you heroes, go on and don't regret your lives!""

#SIX LORDS: PHASE THREE

LCT_occupation_authority: "The Vartai Occupation Authority"
LCT_occupation_authority_desc: "Now that most of our army will be leaving these lands soon, Vartai would need a more permanent government for the natives to be guaranteed a stable future. Several high-ranking lieutenants and war heroes will be given free rein over the region to keep the peace."

LCT_strengthen_mps: "Inaugurate the Viša Žandarmerija"
LCT_strengthen_mps_desc: "Its name roughly meaning "Higher Police," the Viša Žandarmerija is a military company given special training in efficiently handling subversive elements hiding among our great army. Everypony will do their part because we’ll be watching..."

LCT_beatings_will_continue: "The Beatings Will Continue..."
LCT_beatings_will_continue_desc: "Any organized resistance must be met with an organized anti-resistance, which is why the Viša Žandarmerija will collate its varied interrogation techniques into a one-size-fits-all hoofbook. Constables and majors alike will take a test to assess their knowledge, with several apprehended suspects as "answer sheets.""

LCT_put_em_to_work: "Put Them to Work"
LCT_put_em_to_work_desc: "Jumping from one war to another very soon, we can’t lose momentum. More hooves will be drafted to the home front, and if the front’s not big enough, we’ll make it so."

LCT_taking_stock: "Taking Stock"
LCT_taking_stock_desc: "A survey of both Vartai and our own lands will be conducted to designate the resources we haven’t fully utilized yet. But if that can’t fix it, then we can certainly ask our labourers to add an hour or two to their shifts."

LCT_coerced_labour: "Indefinite Work Hours"
LCT_coerced_labour_desc: "Ponies at the home front must be as alert and as disciplined as their rifle-toting, skull-cracking counterparts. They must wake when called, charge into the factories when needed, and lay down suppressing fire on creeping laziness and recreation."

LCT_special_economic_areas: "EPZs"
LCT_special_economic_areas_desc: "An idea Westerly toyed with was "export-processing zones" which will apparently attract guilds from across Griffonia to produce weapons and equipment for us and their other customers. Reducing tariffs on these international (and griffon-run) guilds seems suspect, but his old notes calculate that the profits would be worth it."

LCT_quotas_will_increase: "Quotas Will Increase..."
LCT_quotas_will_increase_desc: "The previous quotas assumed a constricting view on an individual pony’s abilities. Now that we’ve seen what a unified Lake Army could do when given the chance, it’s time to believe in ourselves much harder and push those limits much further."

LCT_until_morale_improves: "...Until Morale Improves"
LCT_until_morale_improves_desc: "The border state that is Vartai is in our control now, thanks to our local leaders and their loyal underlings. A nasty piece of work they did, getting everyone to fall in line for the Imperial war. The lords are impressed."

LCT_onto_important_matters: "Onto Important Matters"
LCT_onto_important_matters_desc: "With the passing of Westerly Leeward, a replacement is urgently needed to assure everypony that everything will be all right."

LCT_aerial_takeover: "The Lone Domain Aerial Network"
LCT_aerial_takeover_desc: "The Herzlanders, united or not, are still creatures of flight; their synergy with aerial warfare cannot be denied. What can be denied, though, is entry into our airspace, thanks to a freshly constructed network of anti-air placements and one of those new-fangled radar things."

LCT_recruitment_drive: "The Nacrt Odluke"
LCT_recruitment_drive_desc: "The draft must increase to meet the ever-growing needs of our final showdown in the Herzland. If the griffons kill one of us, two will exact their revenge."

LCT_preparing_our_border: "The Anti-Herz Line"
LCT_preparing_our_border_desc: "Solid Rocks' success with The Anti-Ost Line spells a repeat performance to shut out the winged peril. His proposal for The Anti-Herz Line isn’t just sound, we’ve already ordered our worker-soldiers to build the foundations already."

LCT_lay_the_rails: "Expand the Nova Linija"

LCT_logistics_officers: "Legitimise the Komanda Kamiona"
LCT_logistics_officers_desc: "Being part of the "Truck Command" used to draw in insults insinuating that you weren’t a "real" soldier. Not anymore. Transporting supplies and your fellow troops to the war zone is just as important and just as honorable as the fighting itself. How did you get in the battlefield without logistics, anyway?"

LCT_load_the_guns: "Take Aim at the Vultures"
LCT_load_the_guns_desc: "The final struggle awaits us. We shall be tested, but what is war but not a cleansing fire from which our burning souls shall come out as the spirits’ warriors... and into which the Imperial vultures shall writhe forever?"

LCT_the_grifkings_riches_desc: "Of course, we’d like to acquire the entire Griffking river, but Vartai’s portion of it hides fertile fields ripe for the taking. Why haven’t we exploited these waters sooner? Get Big Money to negotiate some factory deals for the river now!"

LCT_a_ribbon_of_steel: "A Ribbon of Steel"
LCT_a_ribbon_of_steel_desc: "Roads and rails are the veins of an army, that is true, with supplies being our blood. What else is true is that these can be made stronger. Get your shovels ready, and use your veins, everypony!"

LCT_guest_workers: "Enlist Guest Workers"
LCT_guest_workers_desc: "Vartai may be good people, but they could be better used back in the beating heart of the Army in Jezeragrad and elsewhere to bolster our high-octane manufacturing. The griffons among them should be thankful: they’re getting free tours of the city!"

LCT_cold_iron: "A Sword’s Cold Steel"
LCT_cold_iron_desc: "Flaming Hot’s told us that his contacts uncovered "various hot spots of iron ore activity" in Swordsson. While that’s not exactly the right term for it, this is great news for our war factories who’ll now have an easier time making steel. We won’t run out of bullets just yet!"

LCT_operation_jaburo: "Operation Jaburo"
LCT_operation_jaburo_desc: "The whole fiery front shall sing as our Army gallops into Griffenheim together! Expel the griffons from their high places, Lakesponies! Blood shall run by the Griffking for Lakeish glory and ponish freedom!"

LCT_daringdreams_daringdream_desc: "The Šest Vojvodi, or the Six Lords, have called the shots for years if not decades as Lake City languished in civilian idling. Now that conflict of a massive scale is on the horizon, the Lords’ chief strategist Daring Dream will lead the way, and she’s got big plans."

LCT_dream_of_a_military_education: "Dream of Military Education"
LCT_dream_of_a_military_education_desc: "War is more than just shooting at the other creature. Training, logistics, treatment, and just better equipment all chip in to help turn our recruits into all-around veterans in no time."

LCT_dream_of_steel_battalions: "Dream of Steel Battalions"
LCT_dream_of_steel_battalions_desc: "Other countries shine with top-of-the-line armor divisions. Why shouldn’t we? Soon, our glorious tanks will break any frontline in half."

LCT_dream_of_games_of_war: "Dream of Wargames"
LCT_dream_of_games_of_war_desc: "Theories paired with nice games of chess are only the first step in cultivating martial geniuses.

LCT_dream_of_a_million_soldiers: "Dream of a Million Soldiers"
LCT_dream_of_a_million_soldiers_desc: "When bullets and guns land in the hooves of every Lakeish mare and stallion, only then can the war be won. In this fight, our own civilians are considered armed and dangerous!"

LCT_dream_of_singing_cannons_desc: "Give a soldier ten bullets and a grenade, he’ll take down twelve. Give five soldiers a boatload of munitions and ordinances, they’ll stop an entire brigade in their tracks."

LCT_cutting_edge_explosives: "Cutting-edge Explosives"
LCT_cutting_edge_explosives_desc: "Whether it’s the payload itself or just firing it farther, we can certainly see the benefit of having more explosive damage per shell. If a couple of shots can cripple entire supply lines, all the better."

LCT_national_artillery_companies: "Jezeragrad Arsenal"
LCT_national_artillery_companies_desc: "Our cannons once fell behind the rest of the world’s; we made do with cheap guns from private companies in other nations. That past is no more, as we’ve forcefully fit every Lakeish organization that could help advance our own brand of artillery into one nationalized mega-company: The Jezeragrad Arsenal."

LCT_dream_deeper: "Maximise Every Shot"
LCT_dream_deeper_desc: "We can only get away with indiscriminately lobbing shells for so long. Now is the time for our forces to better coordinate with each other so that each munition sings in a destructive symphony. As they say: work smarter, not harder."

LCT_tune_the_howitzers: "Tune the Howitzers"
LCT_tune_the_howitzers_desc: "With the full support and assistance of our cannon-loving Smoke Signal, our artillery have been calibrated to the most minute of scales. Pinpoint accuracy, with either the diversity of combined arms or the unity of rapid dominance, shall lead us to a decisive victory."

LCT_cutting_edge_firearms: "Cutting-edge Firearms"
LCT_cutting_edge_firearms_desc: "Crates filled with jammed and outdated guns? What are we, a rabble of Zebrican mercenaries? Our soldiers deserve far better for their basic needs, reliable weapons that can go hoof-to-hoof with our more advanced neighbours."

LCT_clear_dreams: "The Lakeish Flood"
LCT_clear_dreams_desc: "Survive, adapt, overwhelm: all our operations must rest on this threefold foundation. Whether it’s harassing our enemies with large-scale breakthroughs or stampeding them with an unending horde of hooves, the Lakeish army shall become a flood."

LCT_every_town_a_conscription_office_desc: "Enlistment shall spread to every city and village thanks to an in-depth propaganda campaign and ruthless bureaucrats screening for eligible would-be warriors. If the place has homes, our network of boot camps will stop just shy of raiding them."

LCT_national_firearm_companies: "Svetigrad Armaments"
LCT_national_firearm_companies_desc: "Out of Lakeish pride, more than a hundred gunsmiths and industrialists have been put in a room to pull together their talents under one corporation: Svetigrad Armaments, who will put  stopping power into every capable hoof."

LCT_sing_a_song_of_war_desc: "Do you hear that? Who’s singing over there by the plains, the rivers, and the mountains? They’re our fighters, most courageous, their shouts for Lakeish ascendance as loud as thunder!"

LCT_repurpose_tractor_production_lines: "Trade Tractors for Tanks"
LCT_repurpose_tractor_production_lines_desc: "The farmer has long ago abandoned the sickle for more modern tools, but the farmer too must now abandon the humble tractor and make way for building and driving the treads of war."

LCT_guns_guns_guns: "Guns, Guns, Guns!"
LCT_guns_guns_guns_desc: "The assembly lines of today, thanks to advances in mass production, has granted us a wealth of good guns by the truckload. Rest assured, you’ll never find yourself out of ammo anymore!"

LCT_cannons_cannons_cannons: "Cannons, Cannons, Cannons!"
LCT_cannons_cannons_cannons_desc: "Economies of scale dictate that we can efficiently produce millions of shells, feed them into a few hundred howitzers, and bombard the enemy constantly until they crack, sparing us the cost of lives lost in infantry combat."

LCT_guns_of_our_patriots_desc: "Our multitude of factories don’t just output tons of weapons; they invent them. With the introduction and widespread acceptance of futuristic and magitech designs, our army will always gain the upper hoof."

LCT_introduce_triage: "Rapid Hospital Deployment"
LCT_introduce_triage_desc: "For every wounded pony, two more have to carry them to safety. Medic corps that can drive to and deploy in the fiercest battle zones, all in no time, will ensure that our injured won’t waste time and ponypower being carried to a place of refuge."

LCT_militarise_our_engineers: "Inženjerska Vojska"
LCT_militarise_our_engineers_desc: "Our engineers may not be used to wielding a rifle, but soon they will be. Their intelligence in machinery and construction, amplified by the on-the-clock conditions of battle, will clear the way for our troops in difficult environments and keep them safe from harm with instant entrenchments."

LCT_magical_combat_classes: "Magical Combat Classes"
LCT_magical_combat_classes_desc: "The unicorn’s ability to actively manipulate magic must not be overshadowed by today’s well-founded obsession with bullets. Training courses tailor-made for the unicorns among us shall weaponize the totality of our magic to the fullest."

LCT_steel_bears: "Steel Bears"
LCT_steel_bears_desc: "Heavy tanks roll into the field as mobile offensive strongholds that can hold their ground for infantry forces and also disable enemy defenses. Rushing into the fray with these leaders of steel will neutralise most armor that dares stand in our way, like sending bears to prey."

LCT_iron_weapons_of_wonder: "Iron Weapons of Wonder"
LCT_iron_weapons_of_wonder_desc: "Smoke Signal is either a genius or a mental patient with her designs for a super heavy tank, a crazy wonderweapon. If this works out, though, Jezeragrad will have unstoppable giants in their ranks, ready to decapitate whole divisions."

LCT_streamline_crystal_smithing: "Streamline Crystal Smithing"
LCT_streamline_crystal_smithing_desc: "The honoured tradition of crystal smithing is fraught with ornamental steps that serve to prolong the process.

LCT_all_according_to_plan_desc: "The foolish griffons charge headfirst into their own senseless deaths! The gods they pray to will not save them now. In fact, let’s embrace the label they stick upon us: we are their judgment!"

LCT_prisoner_parades: "Prisoner Parades"
LCT_prisoner_parades_desc: "Let’s give something good to our captured griffons for once: a grand tour from Griffenheim to Jezeragrad, escorted by our fine troops! Our ponies will be updated live on radio on where and when they can interact with our choicest spoils of war."

LCT_PoW_work_camps: "Jezeragrad Development Board"
LCT_PoW_work_camps_desc: "With a huge influx of prisoners-turned-workers, the Jezeragrad Development Board has been established to relocate them to their new homes in the factories, harvesting raw materials and other hard labour. In the meantime, our ponies will rise to positions more suitable for them than physical toil."

LCT_PoW_construction_teams: "Free Construction Teams"
LCT_PoW_construction_teams_desc: "Properly training griffons on how our buildings work will go a long way in freeing up more Lakesponies to push the front forward as our free labourers will perform the meager task of propping up our industrial dynamo."

LCT_our_brave_soldiers: "Our Brave Soldiers"
LCT_our_brave_soldiers_desc: "Triumph after triumph graces the most blessed of Lakesponies: our soldiers! They’ve routed the griffons, sent them packing, and every morning, the headlines speak of yet more battles won. Our final victory is inevitable!"

LCT_victory_parades: "Victory Parades"
LCT_victory_parades_desc: "Who’s the chicken who said we shouldn’t celebrate until after the war’s won? Isn’t our brutal hammering of the griffon forces a good enough reason to march at home for, to wave to the crowd and pull yet more of us to the glorious battle for?"

LCT_bomb_to_oblivion: "Rain of Terror"
LCT_bomb_to_oblivion_desc: "From its peak through its twilight, the Griffonian Empire has shone as a beacon of griffonkind... and a scourge against ponykind, raining terror upon our lands from the skies. Let’s return them the favor."

LCT_the_final_push: "The Heart Shall Bleed!"

LCT_our_forces_struggle: "An Early Stalemate"
LCT_our_forces_struggle_desc: "The beaked buffoons are putting up a serious fight; while we haven’t ceded much ground, they haven’t either, and the Herzland remains elusive. But Lakespony, be patient; those griffon reserves are not infinite; we can play their waiting game."

LCT_make_token_gains: "Make Token Gains"
LCT_make_token_gains_desc: "The Lake Army is slowly but surely grinding the griffons down. Every inch we take, we’ll firmly hold now and forever as rightful Lakeish soil."

LCT_the_time_is_now: "The Time is Now"
LCT_the_time_is_now_desc: "The Herzland’s pesky built-up defense is what set us back in the first place. Now that we’re rolling our way forward, it’d be foolish to suddenly stop our momentum. Instead, this must snowball into a sustained offensive that the griffons won’t see coming."

LCT_reassure_the_public: "Reassure the Public"
LCT_reassure_the_public_desc: "Star Talent and Flaming Hot plan to make public radio broadcasts spinning our standstill into a winning crusade. Why the lack of haste?

LCT_raise_morale: "The Lake Has Never Bled"
LCT_raise_morale_desc: "In the Lake Army’s nascent history, there has never been a defeat. Lakesponies must be reminded of this fact; they are to have faith in us that this great struggle will finally end with the griffon danger vanquished."

LCT_focus_on_defence_redux: "Hold Down the Fort"
LCT_focus_on_defence_redux_desc: "While our forces prepare for a greater, deadlier offensive, they must make any encroachment upon our land as costly as possible. If the Herzland does not desire to yield, neither do we."

LCT_tools_of_victory: "The Tools of Victory"
LCT_tools_of_victory_desc: "The road to Griffenheim lies long, but do not be alienated by its length. Every bullet forged, every rifle assembled, every tank and airplane manufactured: these shall not be in vain. They shall pave the path to Lakeish exaltation."

LCT_the_enemy_advances: "The Griffon Advances"
LCT_the_enemy_advances_desc: "Munitions and stretchers are running out, entire companies are in disarray, and our supplies have been scuffed by griffon forces who’re slowly burning everything we’ve built. We’d like to say that this is only a postponed victory in the making, but bad news travels faster than a pegasus."

LCT_everyone_to_the_front: "Everyone to the Front"
LCT_everyone_to_the_front_desc: "Flailing your hooves in panic isn’t productive. What is productive is taking this rifle and marching to the nearest base for orders."

LCT_stem_national_panic: "A Public Service Announcement"
LCT_stem_national_panic_desc: ""Dear soldier-citizenry, stand firm. These dark times will pass. If this is the cost we must pay to deplete the griffs’ morale with a resounding pushback, then pay it we must.""

LCT_no_step_back: "A Defiant Defense"
LCT_no_step_back_desc: "In Lakeish lands, the griffs are at every possible disadvantage. We’ll beat them single-hoofedly in the knowledge, exploitation, and the iron yet spirited fortification of our own lands. Our officers will beat that into the heads of every single soldier."

LCT_civilians_digging_trenches: "Shovels for Everyone"
LCT_civilians_digging_trenches_desc: "Our soldiers can only multi-task for so long. Mandating everyone at home to commute to and from the front to dig trenches and erect turrets will narrow our troops’ focus to staving off the griffs. Those who can’t dig will be given a rifle and a foxhole assignment."

LCT_find_a_scapegoat: "Find a Scapegoat"
LCT_find_a_scapegoat_desc: "Though the lords are wise, they’ve made a fatal mistake: forgetting to deal with Vartai’s griffons after the initial conquest, leaving them to their own devices. The traitors must give an account for their seditious and subversive actions against our righteous redemption."

LCT_the_last_stand: "The Graveyard of an Empire"
LCT_the_last_stand_desc: "In the clutches of Jezeragrad, death awaits the insolent griffs who breach the borders of our united lake. They may struggle, but their fate is certain. Lake City shall arise as Herzland’s graveyard."

LCT_even_more_celebrations: "The Herzland Parades"
LCT_even_more_celebrations_desc: "The celebrations aren’t exclusive to Lakeponies. The griffons of Griffenheim and beyond will get a taste of our imperial might... and the consequences should they resist."

LCT_what_does_overextension_mean: "A Prosperity Sphere Too Great"
LCT_what_does_overextension_mean_desc: "The power of Lake City stretches from the Riverlands to the seas at Griffking’s end! Our fate shall... wait, what are you talking about with this "overextension" concept?"

LCT_wealth_of_the_empire: "The Land of Endless Treasures"

LCT_why_everygriff_so_mad_desc: "While the Empire’s leaders gave the orders to oppress ponykind, it was the rank-and-file peasants who obeyed and did the deed. The dissidents try to prove their imaginary innocence will be taught that fact by word or sword."

LCT_lets_treat_ourselves: "The Five Rewards"
LCT_lets_treat_ourselves_desc: "For the Six Lords, their payoff is a slice of the meaty Herzland pie. Save for Solid Rocks who’d rather defend the homeland than delegate the task to an incompetent, each Lord will have their own kingdom to call their new home."

LCT_as_for_the_nobles: "A Selfish Nobility Too Decadent"
LCT_as_for_the_nobles_desc: "The Six Lords have their own politicking to play, and the old griffon nobles will be barred from joining, even as figureheads of Imperial hope."

LCT_daring_dream_focus: "A Righteous Fantasy"
LCT_daring_dream_focus_desc: "It is only right that Daring should take control of one of our two premier border zone. She can enjoy strategising for future wars in the north for the rest of her life."

LCT_star_talent_focus: "To Count the Stars"
LCT_star_talent_focus_desc: "Given Star’s penchant for governing compared to the other Lords, it’s been agreed upon that she would handle the Imperial core. While battles from without does not seem likely in the coming months, she’ll have her hooves full dealing with conflict from within."

LCT_flaming_hot_focus: "A Lake of Flames"
LCT_flaming_hot_focus_desc: "Flaming has read several history books from the bargain bin and has expressed interest in holding "the luxuriant realms of Katerin, Angriver, and beyond." Contrarian reports about the former kingdoms have been dismissed as griffon propaganda."

LCT_smoke_signal_focus: "United, We Stand"
LCT_smoke_signal_focus_desc: "Officially, Smoke will be headed south to defend the Empire from external and internal enemies. Unofficially, she’s just excited that she’s got more reasons to use her cannons on someone."

LCT_big_money_focus: "Captain of Industry"
LCT_big_money_focus_desc: "Guarded by Daring in the north and Smoke in the south, Big Money can safely invest in the economy of the Holy Pony Empire. The fertile fields of the central-west Herzland will soon be one vast factory, a promising money-making machine."

LCT_bittersweet_goodbyes_desc: "The Six Lords have been close friends from well before their rise to power, but the heavy duties of leading an Empire come first. Goodbyes and farewells will be had. After that..."


 LCT_the_redpink_tide:0 "The Red-Pink Tide"
 LCT_the_redpink_tide_desc:0 "Generally speaking, communists and harmonists don't exactly get along. However, we've managed to gain so much enmity and hatred that they are in fact considering forming an unholy alliance to take us down. Ergo, we are to act first and take down these dissenters before they can form a bloc big enough to threaten our regime."
 LCT_hunt_underground_unions:0 "Hunt Underground Unions"
 LCT_hunt_underground_unions_desc:0 "As labor unions are strictly illegal, they have taken to organizing underground, resulting in workers becoming more upset and angry from getting indoctrinated into communist and harmonist ideals. Detachments of secret police, given unlimited power of arrest and custody, should clear this issue up quickly."
 LCT_force_them_to_work:0 "Force Them to Work"
 LCT_force_them_to_work_desc:0 "Even without the power of a union behind them, many workers are mad enough that they as individuals refuse to work. They cite horrible work safety, underpaid wages, and lack of regulation. With all of this mind, some strikebreakers, though a little brutish, will shut them up. They will have to wait for their better conditions to arrive."
 LCT_guns_in_the_factories:0 "Guns In the Factories"
 LCT_guns_in_the_factories_desc:0 "Secret police and strikebreakers are proving to be unpopular, to the surprise of no one. Workers now actively attempt to flee worksites, and come together in solidarity against our reign. This kind of behavior is intolerable. Were there to be armed guards in every factory, watching and forcefully separating workers if they got too close to each other, then things would likely settle down, at least for a time."
 LCT_martial_law2:0 "Gut The Communist Hotspot"
 LCT_martial_law2_desc:0 "The worst of every city in the Empire is Visaginas. It's practically overrun with communists scheming in the afterhours as the city goes dark. Strict, swift action will be necessary. Mandated curfews, street patrols, and warrantless house searches will shrink their numbers."
 LCT_ban_public_gatherings:0 "Ban Public Gatherings"
 LCT_ban_public_gatherings_desc:0 "If you give someone an inch, they will take a mile. This is true with public gatherings - places where like-minded individuals can corral together to protest against the state. The last thing the Empire needs is more village idiots that believe standing and waving signs will stop us. It will not."
 LCT_on_the_left:0 "On The Left"
 LCT_on_the_left_desc:0 "Solid Rocks will have to thoroughly categorize all of the myriad communist and harmonist groups that exist within the Empire. There are thousands of them, ranging from civil and terrorist alike, and all need to either be negotiated with, or destroyed. Usually destroyed, however."
 LCT_mass_censorship:0 "Stop The Presses"
 LCT_mass_censorship_desc:0 "With our Empire as massive as it is, news pours in every day of catastrophes occuring all across our territories, with daily rebel attacks and terrorist actions along with mass protests. The news cycle turns this into a self-feeding problem, and we have to crack down on it quickly. State media will be strictly mandated, while independent journalists will be either bribed, threatened, and arrested into silence, and their headquarters raided."
 LCT_occupy_svetigrad:0 "Crush Harmonist Idealism"
 LCT_occupy_svetigrad_desc:0 "Svetigrad has been the renaissance of harmonist thought in Lake City for decades now, attracting intellectuals and philosophers from all over. Now many of them cower in the dark, flirting with the prospect of sparking a democratic rebellion against the Empire. To get rid of this problem, Svetigrad will effectively be occupied by the military. A reminder of our might will stifle harmonist voices, and make sure they speak only in whispers."
 LCT_choke_the_left:0 "Choke The Left"
 LCT_choke_the_left_desc:0 "Through a societal paradigm shift, it would seem like we have managed to thoroughly snuff out the left-wing political spectrum of our nation.

 LCT_break_the_alliance:0 "Cracks In Their Alliance"
 LCT_break_the_alliance_desc:0 "It takes so comically little to drive a deep wedge between communists and harmonists. While very few actually like the Empire, many despise one or both of the former groups, and are more than willing to act as saboteurs, spreading misinformation and divisive rhetoric to split and splinter these ideologies into the mess that they deserve to be.

LCT_military_infrastructure_corps: "Establish the Infrastrukturne Trupe"
LCT_military_infrastructure_corps_desc: "This nation is under military command, and so all its parts—roads, electricity, and water facilities, to name a few—must be staffed by soldiers who can be trained to tune our country’s parameters to build a serious war machine."

LCT_eastern_infrastructure: "Get the East up to Speed"
LCT_eastern_infrastructure_desc: "Our eastern regions, while serviceable due to Federation trade and travel through Blessedgrad, would simply not do for our clash with griffonkind. Better roads will connect our disparate towns there, and modern technologies like electricity will ensure that these backwaters can give us a fighting chance."

LCT_western_infrastructure: "Modernize the West"
LCT_western_infrastructure_desc: "It would be a national embarrassment if the backwards griffons make it to the battlefield before we do. Modernizing the infrastructure in our border states will give the birdbrains little time to react."

LCT_upgrade_railroads_desc: "The Cehvoi left behind plans on an extensive railway network code-named \"Nova Linija\" to carry passengers and freight across the nation at the speed of a bullet.

 # SPRINGTIME FROST INTRO
 ###
 
 LCT_springtime_intro.1.t: "Long Day"
 LCT_springtime_intro.1.d: "The sumptuous smell of cauliflower soup wafted through the kitchen, and Everlasting Green was proud of it. It wasn't exactly grilled beans casserole, but her husband wasn't a picky eater. Soup was easy to cook without being "processed garbage", as he put it.\n\nThen, the door opened. Springtime was here to stay, though not for long. She knew his schedule: tonight, he'd visit the homes of several Demokratski clubs and factions, and promise them his support for this year's election campaign.\n\nHe sat at the dinner table, with baggy eyes. Everlasting grunted as kindly as possible, and he took it as his cue to pour his heart out.\n\nBy the time soup was ready and the children were called, Springtime had disclosed much. Parades, ceremonies, rituals, grand openings... and part of them were just subtle signs of acquiescence to the Cehovi businessponies who had bribed him before he had an idea what to use more money for, to the majors and generals who pushed him into office and, at gunpoint, gave him a list of what bills to approve.\n\n"Just one more year of this," he said once the foals finished their dinner early and galloped upstairs. "You won't have to worry about this soon, Ever. They've already guaranteed my safety after the election."\n\nEver frowned. "How can you be so sure? They burned the last Grand Mayor down, and he seemed to be doing well. No one knew...""
 LCT_springtime_intro.1.a: ""One more year, dear, just one more year...""
 
 LCT_springtime_intro.2.t: "Summer Days"
 LCT_springtime_intro.2.d: "Springtime was gone. For a few days on a Demokratski campaign trip.\n\nAfter accompanying the foals to school, Everlasting entered into her own little campaign, visiting various openings of schools and high-class cocktail parties throughout the day, with the Grand Mayor's blessing. Springtime was still just one pony, and if he was busy, social climbers didn't want to converse with clerks but with the pony closest to him. She didn't believe herself to be good at it, but she still saw herself as a thermometer of the political scene, helpful to her husband in her own way.\n\nWhen the sun melted into a dusk's orange, she headed home. City lights flickered on to the scent of coffee and gas. Cars, trains, and old carriages sped by, night- or graveyard-shifters moving into position, ignoring the facades of ancient fortresses from the River Empire's time as camera-toting tourists (even diamond dogs) visited.\n\nAt a park, foals were using slingshots to take down birds in flight. A recruiter "just passing by" came along, talking up the honour and valour of joining the army, of soon beating up "real birds" across the Longswordian border.\n\nOnly Ever and perhaps that recruiter knew anything of the vice grip that held the nation together. She, too, counted down the days. The love of her life was being ripped apart by his own people. What honour could a husband and father have if he bowed to every merciless demand they had?\n\nHer heart burned. The tears welled."
 LCT_springtime_intro.2.a: "Even if the lake goes up in flames: one more year."
 
 LCT_springtime_intro.3.t: "A Conviction to Serve"
 LCT_springtime_intro.3.d: "Springtime's office recently held meetings with several prominent military figures, among them Iron Gate of the Žandarmerija, Wild Tree of the Preko Drvoreda, and Star Talent of the Six Lords of War. One theme ran through them all: assurance.\n\nThe Grand Mayor proposed: Why does a newborn republic fall? Reaction from outside wasn't the only cause: it was pre-existing clans, cliques, or parties lacking assurance that, if they did not get elected, their power would fade and they would die. Kingdoms at least had bloodlines and traditions.\n\nSo, it was easy to discern that fear in the army, that they'd be reduced to a standing force that defended and did nothing more. Gone were the fantastic tales of Blessed Sword's last stands and impossible battles—they'd be replaced by faceless guns. Who needed the old army in office when anypony can pull a trigger to keep the peace?\n\nA deal was then struck: The army will retain most of its political privileges, provided that they work to deserve and keep them. The government will treat them just like a drill army sergeant would: you'd earn your stripes, and in this boot camp, they were all political privates. Uplift impoverished ponies, patrol crime-ridden areas, help out in paperwork: this was the least they could do.\n\nObjections were raised, but Springtime's argument held water. In this matter, they could do nothing but trust him."
 LCT_springtime_intro.3.a: "Honour and integrity must permeate not a part but the whole of your life."
 
 LCT_springtime_intro.4.t: "The Last Flowers of Spring"
 LCT_springtime_intro.4.d: "Night terrors and the imaginary taste of death threw Springtime up at twilight. Assassination was never an issue; he'd been wary enough. He wouldn't repeat Dew Point's mistake.\n\nStill, he breathed slowly, recounting to himself the events of last night's conventions and parties: the last Cehovi member he'd met wished him good tidings; the last army officer complimented him on how fast he'd grown from "the weakling you were"; Dirty Deeds said that the Demokratski was tamed, under control. Springtime had even met Wavebreaker, the young Harmonite upstart, a kindred spirit with his heart in the right place.\n\nRather darkly, Westerly had also sprung up as Springtime headed home, telling him that "things will fall into place, thanks to you. Or despite you." That haunted him. Just as much as Dew's fiery murder.\n\nSleep eluded him. A majestic purple tinted the sky, the first herald of the rising sun. Too late to get back into his blankets.\n\nMore meetings ahead, always all of Lake City to serve. The most productive year he's head, certainly; he would make additional offerings to the family shrine later. But somepony and her lovely children had slipped through the cracks of his service.\n\nHe sneaked past his dozing wife, and started up the stove. From the fridge, cauliflower and other ingredients. His family would have the pleasant surprise of Springtime's cooking, a toasty prelude to the rest of his summer storms, to take his mind off of 1008."
 LCT_springtime_intro.4.a: "Welcome to our longest days."

 # DIRTY DEEDS INTRO
 ###
 
 LCT_dirty_intro.1.t: "Dirty Deeds"
 LCT_dirty_intro.1.d: "The concrete monolith of a headquarters betrayed its company's lack of old Cehovi heritage, home to The Industrial Development Corporation versus the historic Neighsan and Watersaki. Brutalist, windowless angles and edges spoke volumes of its founder and president.\n\nNow, in Deeds' traditional paper-walled office for today's meeting, a sour taste settled on Springtime's tongue, overpowering any desire to drink the brandy the famed Stallion of Eternal Construction had offered. Half of Jezeragrad's latest buildings had his name somewhere, having had funneled out-of-town farmers hoping to strike metaphorical gold in the capital, catapulting the city into a new century. Still, overheard words from military advisers of long hours, borrowed mattresses, and first aid teams having to be on standby block had made Springtime pause: Jezeragrad was growing up with blood on its hooves.\n\nBut Springtime kept nodding his head through the small talk. Soon, a deal would be offered to help stabilise the Demokratski and, therefore, the country, for next year's elections."
 LCT_dirty_intro.1.a: "Everyone has a price. Even demons."
 
 LCT_dirty_intro.2.t: "To Outsmart Wildlife"
 LCT_dirty_intro.2.d: ""...should you succeed in the first stage of voting," Springtime continued, "you still have to get through the debates with, among other candidates, the military's pick."\n\nDeeds took another sip of brandy. "The army's a good client, but... have you forgotten what they've done to the last pony to hold your office?"\n\nA fidgeting Springtime pushed the fiery memory out of his mind. "Dew Point was... too much of an idealist, not the compromising sort. You, however, are somepony the army cannot just manipulate, compromise or no. You have funds, assets, labourers and if you're willing to go that far, private militias." Effecting a sage nod, "It is a mistake to judge the army as a hive mind. They, too, are held by not much more than rifles and defence."\n\n"Alright, I'll take your word for it; I have my recourse. Still, Wild Tree is a... rather wild fellow."\n\n"Then use his radical nature against him. Push him to overstep the points he makes, then those in attendance will look to you to espouse something tamer. Your so-called crimes would be refreshing in comparison...""
 LCT_dirty_intro.2.a: "Deeds jotted down notes."
 
 LCT_dirty_intro.3.t: "The Demokratski's Great Unifier"
 LCT_dirty_intro.3.d: "Jumping headlong into politics as the Demokratski's conservative candidate still had his jaw drop. It took fifteen minutes for him to break up Springtime's monologue: "On the contrary, this is unnecessary. My subsidiaries already participate in the party's little 'membership clubs' for over a dozen factions."\n\n"Which might've been fine half a century ago, but all these socialists, supremacists, and other -ists have complicated matters. Those clubs have spun off into smaller, more numerous clubs and factions, until this party is nothing more but a loose confederation, vaguely united by... whose values are we conserving when there's a thousand petty squabblers who can't agree on what we should conserve?"\n\n"So you're asking me to somehow represent every single disparate Demokratski sect," Deeds flatly replied.\n\n"I'll grant you the freedom to figure out what to do for each one. Fortunately, it's not ideologies but simple-minded rivalries and heritages that keep this party divided. Join one, send money to another, retract support from some other, threaten a raid of still another..."\n\nAs Springtime explained the dense web of the party's splintering factions, he spotted Deeds smiling. He couldn't imagine the conglomerate stallion as a political warlord."
 LCT_dirty_intro.3.a: "Could he?"
 
 LCT_dirty_intro.4.t: "Golden Eggs"
 LCT_dirty_intro.4.d: ""This has been a productive meeting, Grand Mayor," Deeds finally said as they stood up, shook hooves, "but one more thing: I'd already made arrangements for my son to take over in my place. Local politics is intriguing, but I've heard that a fusion of angel investing, start-ups, and private military companies is a very lucrative mix in southern Griffonia and Zebrica."\n\nA conflagration of confusion mixed with wrath hit Springtime. He bit his lip, kept shaking hooves. "That is quite a shame, but I wish you safety on your endeavours, especially with them after you."\n\nDeeds raised a brow. "Who?"\n\n"You've raised up Dew Point once," said a suddenly frowning Springtime. "See, you misunderstand. No matter what happens to Tree, he and his supporters—and the whole army—desire your ample war chests. Don't you already support some of their own cliques with your deals? They would not want you and your money to leave." Deeds gulped, but Springtime kept on, "Tell me: What happens if they find out that their one and only goose laying their golden eggs is trying to leave? Or that he's ignored a direct order from their so-called puppet?"\n\nBoth stallions kept a firm grip on each other's hooves. Their stare could pierce the other's heart. His own heart shook, beating a thousand times a second.\n\nDeeds sighed, sat down, beckoned the president to do the same; only then could Springtime relax."
 LCT_dirty_intro.4.a: ""For a puppet, Grand Mayor, you're good at stringing deals your way.""
 
 LCT_dirty_intro.5.t: "Grease"
 LCT_dirty_intro.5.d: "On the surface, the Kicoltinda Mariners' Spot had odd-looking mariners drinking at the counter: suave suits, designer shoes, preference for wine over beer and ale. These, however, were politicians for an influential Demokratski faction in Kicoltinda, propped up by mercantile policies over its fishing industry, squeezing extra money out of griffons who didn't mind the ponies hauling in good trout so long as coins and fish swapped forelimnbs.\n\nSpringtime hung back on a chair, giving and receiving greetings, but he could spot Deeds making his way into the establishment. The businesspony got himself a glass of wine then started smooth-talking with his neighbours like long-time buddies. By the hour's end, even sailors who represented the Lake-River Patrol, what could pass for the Lake City's navy, were enraptured by Deeds' promises, any surprise at his announcement of running as a candidate long replaced by a passion to see impressive cash empower real change.\n\nThen, Springtime could smile. His last-minute bluff, the whole "golden eggs" shtick, had worked. The party would be safe with Deeds holding up the tent, keeping the attention off Springtime, especially when Deeds could maximise blackmail and more on less compliant clubs than the Mariners'. His superiors in the army had Deeds to deal with now, not just Springtime... assuming they wouldn't be paid off by Deeds' proposals for partnerships."

 # CEHOVI INTRO
 ###
 
 LCT_cehovi_intro.1.t: "Cehovi"
 LCT_cehovi_intro.1.d: "The Cehovi, Lake City's biggest business guilds, had benign beginnings with a struggling merchant class making do in a society where warriors, especially the honourable Službuniti, were everypony's destinies. However, the sacking of Jezeragrad in the eighth century and the country's subsequent republican rebirth threw the traders into a new world where they could rally for greater corporate liberties. Seasoned sword-bearers soon joined them, finding value in the peaceful art of production for the ponies they used to defend. A succession of Grand Mayors recognised their work, with Grand Mayor Scatter Blossom, in the late 990s, elevating several chief executives to significant roles in the Ministry of the Economy.\n\nBut as Springtime stood before sleek, smiling neckties and their wearers in his office, the Grand Mayor wondered when the noble warrior-merchants turned sour. Liberal economic policies meant that the state wouldn't needlessly meddle in the economy, not the economy needlessly meddling in the state, asking for lower minimum wages, privatisation of bureaucracy, and bidding for government contracts for basic infrastructure.\n\nStill, Springtime might not've been genuinely elected by the people, but he was going to act for them and finally deny these laissez-faire requests and bribes. The polite smiles lessened, and he knew that rage lay silent within them, but the vultures saw Springtime growing a spine for once, and that was enough for today."
 LCT_cehovi_intro.1.a: "Dynasties of robber barons, they all are."

 LCT_cehovi_intro.2.t: "Such a Thing as Bad Publicity"
 LCT_cehovi_intro.2.d: "At the offices of The Jezeragrad Dailies, Springtime wrote his signature of approval, and they would be the final publication to be part of the plan: work overtime to print a couple anti-Cehovi fliers in the name of defunct or non-existent leftist parties, and get anonymous "youngblood on the street" to pen anti-Cehvoi columns.\n\nOver the week, Springtime read the papers with scrutiny. While the headlines were the usual speculation on the upcoming election, a certain Spoken Spell, supposedly a college student, had written a half-page treatise on "why the corporatist guilds, assuming that all actors seek their own gain (by their own liberal policies), will, with enough power, subvert the state into a neo-medieval state that is indistinguishable from serfdom".\n\nAs expected, the afternoon brought a deluge of letters and phone calls from the businessponies regarding Spoken Spell and other such ponies, concerned about when and how this sudden hotbed of communism had sprung. In response, Springtime said that the writers have a point, and if the Cehovi want to help maintain the facade of democracy, they may as well listen to the national dialogue and try to appease a new generation of morally conscious ponies."
 LCT_cehovi_intro.2.a: "If they don't, the army and their guns could persuade them."

 LCT_cehovi_intro.3.t: "The Prouette Plan"
 LCT_cehovi_intro.3.d: ""...thus, the Bill of Labour Democratisation will fulfill its three purposes," said Prouette Carpet in her slideshow presentation to the Grand Mayor: "upholding the rights of labourers, restraining the monopolies' growth, and lowering the barriers of entry for smaller enterprises' benefit—all to a small enough degree that some of the guilds, just to save face, wouldn't deny it outright, while also putting a hoof in the door for further reform."\n\nIt was an unusual endeavour, especially since the bill was drafted with politicians from multiple parties, united by the belief that a market barred from government assistance save for gutsy start-ups would be a competent replacement for the Cehovi's outdated system of economics. The drafters also had anecdotes from maligned entrepreneurs and beaten-up workers, primed for the PR crusade when the bill makes the rounds in the press.\n\nBut an economy distributed and democratised across the entire nation, even with such small steps, did have its costs. A large number of company assets would have to be moved around or frozen, and should the bill be passed, there would still be much debate and bickering on how they would be implemented and on who or what.\n\nStill, Springtime gave unofficial approval. He couldn't pass the bill himself; the Skupština would still have to vote on it. But now, the Cehovi might finally give way."
 LCT_cehovi_intro.3.a: "It's up to the representatives now."

 LCT_cehovi_intro.4.t: "Left to Fly a Plane"
 LCT_cehovi_intro.4.d: "The minister, in her penthouse office overseeing the great lake, re-read the list of names set to take the fall.\n\nThe Bureau of Transportation Regulation, over the years under Sawn Novelty's administration, witnessed steel railroads stretch across the world, with rumours of airline travel on the horizon. As expected, the Neighjima guild wanted a slice of that pie, so Novelty was their point mare for that, establishing a code of air travel laws that would give exceptions to planes made with their materials, their designs. In return for fending off nosy auditors and protestors, she would get a sweet kickback, her name emblazoned on one of the planes, and the promise of a pilot scholarship grant to her daughter.\n\nIt didn't matter that the Skupština recently clamoured about some bill. Fine: there were low-level grunts who did the truly immoral paperwork. She'd confess that she hadn't been vetting her staff as best as she could; they'd be replaced by more competent faces, vetted by both her and Neighjima.\n\nAnd what if, in an hour from now, they'd come for her, ask her to come to testify against Neighjima? The guild itself would agree to let her play the part of the fool. Neighjima's president, who was getting on in years, would simply hoof off the position to her son, ready to profit off of the burgeoning prospects of inter-continental travel and tourism.\n\nContented, she sat back in her chair."
 LCT_cehovi_intro.4.a: ""Little Stone, a pilot someday!""
 
 LCT_cehovi_intro.5.t: "Cartohama"
 LCT_cehovi_intro.5.d: "The Vice Minister of the Labour Security Bureau was told that it'd be for the preservation of his honour and that of the Cartohama guild. His family would appreciate it: while they would take a hit of prestige, at least he wasn't their eldest son; he would continue on their legacy and their patronage to the guild. The minister was just an unfortunate casualty, a Cehovi grunt who didn't climb the social ladder fast enough to evade or befriend the authorities.\n\nWhen the officers knocked on his door, despite how far into the boondocks his new home was, he sighed. No guns, no traps; even the honourable way out via self-disembowelment would be for naught—they'd somehow spin the honest practice into a corrupt suicide meant to hide secrets. Cartohama had threatened harm on his family should he kill himself, anyway. Still, from the light armour they wore, the soldiers outside were just spec ops, not the army he'd heard would raid the other guilds much harder.\n\nHe'd surrender peacefully. Some decades in jail would give him enough age to forge a new identity.\n\n"Mister Spare Tyre," said the squad's leader when the door finally opened, "you are charged with embezzlement along with government corruption in your position to extra-legally benefit the Cartohama."\n\nThe river outside trickled with crystal clear water. He inhaled its fresh scent one last time before the cell's darkness would blind him."

 # WAVEBREAKER INTRO
 ###
 
 LCT_wavebreaker_intro.1.t: ""Wavebreaker""
 LCT_wavebreaker_intro.1.d: "That's the name of a pilot who, just twelve hours ago as the latest report states, rebuffed an entire squadron of raiders from Longsword, having shot down most of the enemy planes long before reinforcements arrived, forcefully convincing the rest to flee.\n\nHowever, as he headed back to base, his plane suffered an engine failure which was quickly followed by the breaking off of one of its wings. He crashed halfway between Prištinaigh and Jezeragrad.\n\nThat Wavebreaker was able to survive the impact was a miracle by itself. Then he survived being unattended for upwards of ten minutes before a farmer from a nearby village could reach him. Amazingly, he still lived after not receiving professional treatment immediately—the village did not have a fully fledged hospital—before spending half an hour in an ambulance carriage to Jezeragrad.\n\nTime will tell if Wavebreaker recovers well enough to return to active duty. Still, whatever his fate may be, the ace has already become the subject of national interest. Jezeragrad's brand-new radio station promises hourly updates straight from the medical staff themselves."
 LCT_wavebreaker_intro.1.a: "But if life passes like cherry blossoms..."
 
 LCT_wavebreaker_intro.2.t: "Discharged"
 LCT_wavebreaker_intro.2.d: "What should've been years of recovery has been reduced to two months' rest and check-ups, as today marks Wavebreaker's discharge from the hospital. He has, however, also been medically retired from active service due to significant damage to his eyesight. Wavebreaker has not been too saddened by this, as he finds "much gratitude to the spirits that have given me a new lease on life".\n\nThere is no question regarding his future, though, as Wavebreaker's first civilian act is to declare his membership in the harmonic Udruzenje za Moderni Jezerograd, led by founder Deirdre Skye. Reporters expressed surprise at his political affiliation, but as Wavebreaker explained, his own account and later investigation of the crash emphasised the lack of enemy damage on his plane:\n\n"If it wasn't the griffons, then who? Either the guilds who made the plane or the officers who ordered the manufacture of such subpar planes. Do you see the scar on my face that banished me out of a plane forever? This is what you get when—and I say this hypothetically—a few finicky generals demand that the quota of fighters must be met immediately, no matter the cost: the common soldier suffers. This is why I join hooves with Skye, to restore the military to the ideals of the spirits and their Soldiers' Path."\n\nWavebreaker will be appointed to the party as an advisor on military policies. He is expected to join Skye on the campaign trail for the 1008 elections.
 LCT_wavebreaker_intro.2.a: "Fliers can't stay grounded forever."
 
 LCT_wavebreaker_intro.3.t: "The Big Stick of Harmony"
 LCT_wavebreaker_intro.3.d: "The next city on the Udruzenje's campaign tour was Zasaddle, straddling the Griffking River. Collecting the scraps of Svetigrad's booming Coalition trade, the forgotten gateway to the Riverlands had seen much better days, with colourful riverside facades hiding impoverished peasants and struggling merchants.\n\nThe speeches of Skye and her chosen candidate for the Zasaddle mayoral race, however, were overcome by a political novice fast making a name for himself, his scarred face and fiery rhetoric contradicting the stereotype of "goody four-shoes" harmonites.\n\n"I cannot encourage you to send your foals to a dishonourable lair of cutthroats!" Wavebreaker shouted before the gathered masses. "Corruption has usurped the venerable Lake City and its army! I do not want your children to be in my place, to have suffered what I have at callous hooves whose unending passion for power contaminate the very system that dares to speak for the common pony! What happened to loyalty and responsibility to the ponies you defend, to your loved ones back home? The army is nothing more than a club of gun-toting ribbon-wearers!\n\n"So do not doom your children to a life where the Soldiers' Path is abandoned, where they will be debased into self-serving demons! Only in the Udruzenje may we finally have an army that carries both the rifle and the shovel, both the muscle to protect and the heart to serve!""
 LCT_wavebreaker_intro.3.a: "The cheers rang so loud, the Griffking rippled."
 
 LCT_wavebreaker_intro.4.t: "The Mare of the Thistle"
 LCT_wavebreaker_intro.4.d: "The Udruzenje's headquarters housed a smoking room for deliberations among the party's chairponies. There, Deirdre, remained silent in the stench as hooves passed reports and words typewritten in red, mixed with photos of half-empty crowds. The Pònaidh-blooded mare could smile: rare was the sight of professors, sergeants, and farmers exerting themselves so vigorously to obtain Harmony.\n\nBut she could sense that what stood between them and Harmony now was herself.\n\nThe general assembly that night confirmed her prediction. Passionate speeches crafted her condemnation: her recent Pònaidhean escapade stained the party's reputation with allegations of hyper-pacifism and dishonour, which only brought into light the flaws of her passive strategy, letting other parties scoop up a sizable power base with in-your-face crusades that nonetheless brought their causes to the constituents where they were.\n\nFour-fifths voted for a non-confidence resolution over Deirdre's Udruzenje leadership. All Deirdre showed was a bitten lip. An applause sent her off with profuse thanks for a quarter-century's worth of Harmonic service. While the next few weeks would leave the party headless, Deirdre said in soft tones that they would be fine.\n\nThe last representative to see her before she left saw her trot away, packing no bags, heading south-east. To her ancestral lands."
 LCT_wavebreaker_intro.4.a: "The threads of harmony weave a blanket for her slumber."
 
 LCT_wavebreaker_intro.5.t: "A New Face for Harmony"
 LCT_wavebreaker_intro.5.d: "Great crowds flocked to the party's halls or tuned into the radio for the great debates between the remaining runners after a hectic round of preliminary voting. Among them were a Ponikami priest, Chanting Dawn, advocating for national obedience to the Soldiers' Path's virtues; a River Republic immigrant, Stardust Delight, emphasising peaceful friendship between all races; a refugee miner and Longswordian Genocide survivor, nicknamed Uncle Ingot, urging for anti-Cehovi restrictions and regulations.\n\nAnd there was Wavebreaker. While not the most elucidative, his rustic, even caustic, language raked in the most cheers and whoops from the audience. His calls for the honour-cleansing of the military, for exacting justice to the bloodbath-loving griffons of the west, and for stripping all military branches of extra-martial power so that high command and their army would serve Lake City selflessly—these demands had his opponents half-blushing, especially with their own lack of armed Lakeish service.\n\nThe second stage of votes came and went, and to even his own surprise, Wavebreaker won and was swiftly installed as the Udruzenje za Moderni Jezerograd's president. Already, the press expressed praise for the pilot politician, having gone from a nobody in the scene of politics to the leader of a major Lake City party in less than half a year."

 # WILD TREE/SIX LORDS INTROS

LCT_lords_intro.1.t: "A Gift For Lords"
LCT_lords_intro.1.d: "Within the sprawling system that makes up Lake City, there exists six powerful individuals known as the Lords of War. An incredibly exclusive military clique that holds a large amount of influence over our army. While the extent of their power is only truly known to us and our most veteran generals, the power they wield over Lake City and our military in particular cannot be understated. As their power is too great for us to simply tolerate, their level of influence demands that they be placated, else we risk losing all semblance of control within our own ranks. What they may want as a gift, however, depends on which one of them you ask.\n\nStar Talent and Flaming Hot ask for expensive trinkets and baubles. What they may want to do with those gifts is something we have no knowledge of whatsoever, but considering how much they value power, it would not be a stretch to assume they would try to use those items to enhance their own authority.\n\nWesterly and Smoke Signal ask for nothing more than money. Their clear agenda incentivizes that all resources be dedicated towards strengthening our military and ensuring victory at any cost. While Smoke Signal clearly pushes for her ideas of funding more "wonder weapons", Westerly's focus remains more grounded in reality.\n\nFinally, Daring Dream and Solid Rocks ask for nothing else but more land. Even as these two seem the most fiery than the rest, their goals seem to be clearly focused solely upon expanding their influence, even if they claim that more land under their control means better security."

LCT_snow_intro.1.t: "Heavenly Snow"
LCT_snow_intro.1.d: ""Here are the records," Springtime's clerk-slash-private investigator said, then threw his findings at the president's desk. "Tree's right: this Heavenly Snow has Blessed Sword's blood."\n\nSpringtime could only sigh. Wild Tree kept a cool demeanour in public, promoting pro-military policies via deterrence, but past that stoic facade was a fanaticism for a divine east; private meetings with the armed, scholarly general-major showed no respect for Jezeragrad's grand mayor. It was why, miles away from here—Springtime knew—Wild Tree was drafting a speech or writing a treatise on the River Empire's ancient glories, priming Lakeponies to worship the Grand Prince when he would ascend to the untouched Ramonda Throne.\n\nBut the photos on the desk were a masterpiece of royal humility. Heavenly Snow, though technically a noble, was a glorified clerk in service of Coltljevo's mayor. He had his own own cafe as well, a rare commercial establishment in Lake City; judging by customers who've seen him on the sometime occasions when the little noble moonlit as a barista, he was a sweet pony, mingling freely with regulars and newcomers over the energizing smell of caffeine and snacks. There was no evidence that Snow knew of his royal heritage beyond a distant cousin or two.\n\nChances are that Tree would never be more than a harebrained officer, and Snow would live the rest of his life in peace, never to upend the entire River Coalition. But now, Springtime was aware. May it never be that Tree and Snow would meet."

# #HEAVENLY SNOW EVENTS
###
LCT_heavenlysnow.1.t: "The Blessed Move-In"
LCT_heavenlysnow.1.d: "Heavenly Snow readjusted the tie on his suit, walking alongside an architect who was happily showing off the inside of the Blessed Sword Palace. Everything was either being taken out, repainted, remodeled, refurbished, re-assembled, disassembled, covered up and brought in. Weapons of yore were fixed to the walls and traditional furniture was hurried in by strong-backed stallions, and the hustle and bustle of activity made Snow feel somehow even more uncomfortable than he already was.\n\n"A-and here's this!" The architect stuttered, happily pointing his hoof to an authentic suit of Lakeish armor. "This is more than five hundred years old! A real suit used by samurai during the time of the old emperors!"\n\nSnow felt like he stared right through the suit. It was hard to understate how little he cared about this trivia of history, but what else could he do but attempt to appreciate it? "Uh..." Or at least try to. "That's nice. Though I guess it would be hard to use samurai again in a time of guns and planes." He dryly said, and the architect laughed as though Snow was actually trying to make a joke.\n\n"Of course, of course!" The architect affirmed. "We always want to adapt to the most modern ways of life! I mean, even now, I've heard a few naysayers say that an absolute monarchy is a thing of the past, but I think that's backwards. It's democracy that—"\n\n"Yes." Snow cut in. He just wanted the stallion to stop talking about monarchies. "Sure. They're uh, wrong and all- c-can we keep talking about the armor?""
LCT_heavenlysnow.1.a: ""Any time, my prince!""

LCT_heavenlysnow.2.t: "Steel Folded A Thousand Times"
LCT_heavenlysnow.2.d: "It was unbearable how many news reporters, journalists and eager-eyed people there were watching Snow with the sheathed katana between his hoofs, all waiting patiently with hundreds of camera flashes to see him draw it out. It's not like he was unused to large crowds— he did run a cafe, after all. Well... did. Snow tried to throw the bitter thought out of his head before it worsened his mood, but it failed, and he felt more miserable than he already was.\n\nA mare dressed in a sharp military uniform stepped up to a podium and spoke with the most professional, military recruiter-like voice he had ever heard in his life. "Today marks the birth of a new grand prince— Heavenly Snow! Blessed be his name, for he will draw the katana once wielded by Blessed Sword, the old and powerful emperor who ruled over all of the River Federation, for Snow will follow in his path-" And what, carve out a path of death and destruction?\n\nHis hoof itched to just draw the stupid weapon out and get this ceremony over with, so he could go back to pretending he had a semblance of comfort and quiet in his life. He couldn't stand listening to the military mare prattle on about honor and glory, and only paid enough attention when she bombastically called him out to draw out the sword. And even though he did it with the least enthusiasm he could possibly muster, the cheers and hollering he heard set him on edge, working the crowd up into a frenzy from just a simple motion."
LCT_heavenlysnow.2.a: ""... What is wrong with all of you?" He thought."

LCT_heavenlysnow.3.t: "The Throne Beckons"
LCT_heavenlysnow.3.d: ""I don't understand, Snow." Wild Tree's voice was calm as they both sat at a table, the former drinking coffee, Snow not drinking anything. Snow's eyes shifted nervously. He was clearly anxious, and Wild Tree knew why, but he pretended to play dumb for a moment to get down to the stallion's level. "You're given everything you could ever want, and yet you refuse to do one simple task."\n\nHeavenly Snow took in a deep breath. Wild Tree deeply unnerved him. Something about his polite, yet firm voice, and eerie mannerisms and movements — it was like he was an animated doll, motivated by one purpose. "L-listen, Wild Tree, I just-" He took a breath. "-All this luxury doesn't make up for the fact that I want Summer Sun back." He dared to defy Wild Tree, and paused for a moment to glance at his face. Motionless. "... wh-why lock me and her up like this? If you could-"\n\nWild Tree flung the cup of coffee with extreme force towards the wall next to Snow's head, shattering it and nearly spilling coffee remnants against his head as he stood up and leaned over the table to grab Snow by the collar. The latter gasped in fear, "Stop, stop!" he cried out, trembling and wincing for some kind of physical assault. Yet nothing but the cold voice of Wild Tree came.\n\n"Listen carefully, Snow." He began. "You do not understand the position you are in right now. I will gift you the benefit of the doubt just this once, and assume that you will learn once you are told to behave. So I am telling you now."\n\nThere was nothing behind those eyes."
LCT_heavenlysnow.3.a: ""You will be the grand prince, or you will never see her again.""

LCT_heavenlysnow.4.t: "We Don't Quite Like Each Other"
LCT_heavenlysnow.4.d: ""So you, uh... you decided to..." Snow really didn't want to look Wild Tree directly in the eyes. Something about his gaze simply put the stallion off. The unchanging expression, the large, fixed eyes, the fact that it felt like he was talking to a ghost powered solely by heritage and nothing else - it all creeped him out. "... be my steward. What's that..." He breathed in. "Entail?"\n\n"It means," Wild Tree tapped his hoof against the table twice, "that I will be here to undo your mistakes when you inevitably make them." He said, matter-of-factly, as though he knew in advance that Snow would try to sabotage his position as the grand prince. He could never really draw a bead on what Wild Tree thought of him, but he could somewhat safely assert that it landed somewhere in the park of 'utter, visceral hatred'. Probably. Maybe the fact that he kidnapped his wife had something to do with it.\n\n"It- it'll only get worse if you try to force it." Snow weakly protested, and he prepared to flinch when Wild Tree raised a hoof. The stallion was something else, a complete nutjob. He wondered if Wild Tree would have been a serial killer had he not joined the army. Or maybe he was, he didn't know.\n\n"There will be no forcing anything." Wild Tree calmly said, then put his hoof down. "You will become the grand prince, eventually the emperor. The bloodline will be restored, and the monarchy will return. I don't see how any of this is hard to understand."\n\nSnow wanted to scream. Everything that came out of Wild Tree's mouth was as though it was an immutable fact, impossible to change, impossible to fight against. Why couldn't he just be a simple cafe manager, and not in some insane position as the figurehead of an entire country? "Just... I just..."\n\nWild Tree shook his head, and then gave an empty smile. It was perhaps the most discomforting smile Snow had ever seen in his life, and the words that followed were no better:"
LCT_heavenlysnow.4.a: ""You will be made to learn your place, Snow. Wait and see.""

LCT_heavenlysnow.5.t: "Strangers Anywhere, Strangers Everywhere"
LCT_heavenlysnow.5.d: "If Snow was allowed to fall asleep where he stood, he certainly would take the opportunity to. The ceremonies were private and formal, and it was impossible how hard he stood out amidst all of the military ponies and other miscellaneous staff. Here were people with medals pinned to their shirts and gung-ho attitudes about serving the grand prince and the nation, and all he could think about was home. Home, and the smell of the cookies Summer Sun baked whenever he would get home on the weekends. The smell of roses he planted into the windows of the cafe, and the tea and sake they would serve to loyal returning customers there. It was all such a nice memory to return to, keeping him away momentarily from the dregs of ridiculous social customs and the need to greet dozens of random ponies into worthless positions he would never hear about again.\n\nIt was only the bump-in of a junior officer that knocked him out of his haze, nearly spilling the drink he was holding. He could hear the vaguely frantic apologies coming from the young stallion, and he blinked to look at him properly. "Uh... y-you're fine, um... ?"\n\nThe officer let out a nervous laugh, feeling eyes on the back of his skull. "My name doesn't matter, prince, I-I just- I wasn't looking where I was going! Please forgive my foolishness!"\n\nSnow mused on why the pony repeated himself. "I said you're fine, man..." He muttered, watching him with a confused and concerned expression. Before anything else happened, two of Snow's bodyguards roughly wrestled the pony away, and he felt unnerved by the fact that the pony kept on attempting to ask for Snow's forgiveness, even as he was being taken away. Was this what he was supposed to expect? Unswerving, undying loyalty to the grand prince? Apologizing profusely just for a simple mistake? When he was just a regular citizen, a bump on the street didn't even warrant a 'sorry', let alone a show like that."
LCT_heavenlysnow.5.a: "And it didn't feel comforting. Not at all."

LCT_heavenlysnow.6.t: "An Eternally Blessed Kingdom"
LCT_heavenlysnow.6.d: ""... and to Bright Snow, my great-great-grandfather, who was renowned for his kindness and benevolence to his family, I ask that he watch over me too."\n\nThe scene was beautiful, even if Snow didn't find it so. Dressed in regal clothing and sitting on a throne inside a float gently drifting alongside the lake, at night where the moon hung high above the forest and hundreds gathered to watch him speak, he felt empty and bitter. All of felt pointless - he knew that not a single one of his ancestors were interested in helping him out, and he never really bought into the whole folklore stuff to begin with. Sure, he did keep charms in his house and occasionally prayed to his ancestors, but it wasn't particularly serious, though Summer Sun did it more often than him. He just... asked for help with running his business, keeping the sales coming and customers returning. Now he was asking them to help him run a country?\n\nHe watched idly as the fireworks erupted after he finished his speech. They exploded into the sky, showering the darkness with beautiful, multi-colored light as cheers erupted from the crowd in front of him. Snow wished he had Summer Sun next to him. She would have loved the lightshow and the general joy people exhibited, but instead she was holed up somewhere he didn't even really know where, restricted from the public eye, unable to be acknowledged as even existing.\n\n"Summer..." He whispered under his breath, watching the never-ending fireworks. He imagined holding arms with her, resting against the grass, pointing out the patterns they could find."
LCT_heavenlysnow.6.a: "But none of it came. Only formalities and obligations he never wanted."

LCT_heavenlysnow.7.t: "Return of the Righteous Ruler"
LCT_heavenlysnow.7.d: "Snow lost count of how many times he had to recite the same speech over and over and over again. Even if he landed it perfectly three times in a row, he had to go through the agonizing process of spending an entire morning just repeating the same lines in his head until he thoroughly remembered the pronunciation of every syllable and every archaic word in the speech. When it came time to straddle up to the podium and speak into the microphone, he could feel the piercing gaze of Wild Tree next to him, watching his every move, his every breath, every blink. If he messed this up, he felt like he wouldn't see Summer Sun again. So he took a deep breath.\n\n"I... Heavenly Snow, last of the line of descendants of Blessed Snow, take the Heavenly Sword of Gathering Clouds into my hooves, and with it proclaim my status as the Grand Prince of Lake City. I swear upon the honor of my ancestors and their ancestors before them that I will guide Lake City to greatness-" Would he ever see Summer Sun after this?

LCT_heavenlysnow.11.t: "The Best of Their Time"
LCT_heavenlysnow.11.d: "Sickening. Ferried through the gates of Deponya, through a border of stone bricks, Heavenly Snow might as well have taken a time machine back half a thousand years. The Deponyans had watched the River Empire's return, and their response was to cheer this sick state on. Wild Tree had given him the rundown: Deponya was once a kingdom within the Empire, the Grand Prince having granted them special autonomy for as long as they followed him into war. The ponies' fervour hadn't changed in the centuries, hadn't gotten the memo that war in the 1000s could be so... destructive.\n\nAnd the spiders. The spiders couldn't stop freaking him out by their mere existence. As if normal-sized ones weren't enough, giant spiders pulled wagons down the roughshod roads. If looks could kill…\n\nPast sundown, Snow could take a break at a high-class inn, picked out by him by his planners who couldn't shut up about offering the Grand Prince only the best places to stay in.\nOutside, medieval storybook pictures from his foalhood played out in real-time: cloaked peasants milled about and coming to rest, merchants still shouted about their fruits and wares at the marketplace, metal cracked against anvils forging something fierce, cottages ahead no doubt churned precious clothes from hideous spider silk, and the rare noble or two wandered about to deal with late-night civic issues.\n\nAll of it, sickening. Wild Tree was dragging the Empire back into... this, where every pony knew their place and stayed there. If and when their king levied every pony to war, what then? They'd just follow along like lemmings?"
LCT_heavenlysnow.11.a: "That, and he might eat a hanging spider in his sleep."

LCT_heavenlysnow.12.t: "Every Inch a King?"
LCT_heavenlysnow.12.d: "Heavenly Snow didn't miss the inferiority he had with Grimhoof in this royal hall bedecked in precious stones and a table crafted with fine rare wood, itself laden with never-ending courses of so much food, Snow might gag. This lavishness and this divine right the king had, Snow had as well; the training of tradition, for the position, Snow lacked. Grimhoof's eyes spoke of an army of generations guiding him, a lineage having taught him how to lead, giving meaning to his many privileges. Despite the responsibilities that swamped him, Grimhoof was, at least, free.\n\nThrough the negotiations, Snow's mind looped back to that truth. Wild Tree had prepared for Snow a number of flowery speeches; Grimhoof, on the other hoof, was restrained, weighing each word: archaic, yet straight to the point.\n\nThe king considered the possibility of full support, provided great autonomy was given to Deponya just like in the old days. And how curious he was over modern weapons such as artillery, tanks... his subjects probably still imagined there would be glory in charging onto flat grass, shooting guns wildly before they get mowed down by indirect fire and snipers. No cavaliers, no gallant knights battling each other at swordpoint. What glory could be found there.\n\nThus the meeting ended inconclusively. Snow's mouth had gone automatic, just saying what was right. Yes, yes, the River Empire would allow Deponya to have its independence as long as it serves when called, and now Grimhoof would convene first with his advisors on what they would think. Snow was to retire to his lodgings, with just about everyone in high command doing the advising, calling the real shots…"
LCT_heavenlysnow.12.a: "A prince falls short."

#LCT_yes_maybe
LCT_heavenlysnow.13.t: "Let's Away to the Fair"
LCT_heavenlysnow.13.d: "Even within his borders, Heavenly Snow couldn't flee the ancient-ness of the Deponyans and their little fair, which Tree and the others dubbed "an event of cultural exchange". Never mind the trumpets blaring around him nor the the tapestry of Lakeish and Deponyan banners nor the dirt paths nor the scrumptious scents wafting from diverse tents and stalls nor the grounds cleared for brave warriors to melee on for hours or the whole week nor the proliferation of spiders small and large…\n\nHe stole a glance at stately Grimhoof during a photo opportunity where modern Lakeish reporters showed off cameras and their blinding flashes at the old king, accompanied by a cloaked Keeper that was apparently a prince named Forest. Whatever the other generals said about the "backwards" Deponyans, it wasn't true: backwards but shrewd and worldly. The king's subjects took the modern world in stride, always asking questions and quietly debating with their Lakeish counterparts. They could hold their own here in the bustle of this busy fair.\n\nAnother flash, another daze, and Snow's hazy memory of a schedule dragged his hooves forward past muzzle-watering cornucopias to watch the next jousting match. Hardened archers shot blunted arrows at each other, riding on spider-back for the grand goal of toppling their opponents off their eight-legged steeds, and everypony else cheering them on under a peasant-looking prince... no, Deponya, too, was complicit. They saw no issue in the Empire's revival; they'd have no issue with bringing the rest of the Riverlands to their hocks. Blind the Prince might be to the nitty-gritty of governance, he yet saw past the 'joyful' mood of this whole affair.\n\nTwo countries now, sweeping him away from safety."

LCT_heavenlysnow.28.t: "The River Empire"
LCT_heavenlysnow.28.d: "Heavenly Snow couldn't get himself out of bed. Today was an important-- no, it was the most important day of all. In blood and gunfire, the river ponies were finally united again. The last time was almost three hundred years ago, and the previous emperor held a grand parade. Yet now the figurehead of its unification wasn't even alerted to it. Snow hadn't even been given the chance to say no. There was no invitation or discussion, no moment of rebellion and no dragging out the process until he would inevitably be forced onto the podium. Instead, he was left to his devices in the palace while the voice of a general boomed through the paper walls. It wasn't Wild Tree but one of his lackeys he had converted to the fanatical and insane cause he dedicated himself to.\n\nSnow turned to his side, staring into the floor below him, his vision blurring and his breaths becoming shallower and quieter. He was backed into a corner without an escape, his wife held hostage by Tree while the nation hopped on a train straight towards Tartarus. The sounds of the general's proclamation were drowned out by his own thoughts: what would happen now? In what horrible way would all of this end? What would happen to Summer Sun? Stuck working the cafe, unable to talk to anyone about what her husband was going through, monitored at all times by his own government?\n\nSnow curled in on himself, front legs tightly pressed against his chest, and all he could think about was the cafe. The smell of the coffee, the warmth of the morning, the hug of his wife. It was all gone now. It wouldn't ever come back. Everything he tried to do, every second of resistance and every spat back at Tree meant nothing. It meant nothing. The world was going to burn and all he could do was watch. A player in its play with his strings cut, motionless on the floor while rivers of blood flooded the theater, and the blood would fill his mouth and choke him in it. In the lowest depths of Snow's hopelessness, he clung to just a single word."

LCT_wildtree.2.t: "The Obligations of Restoration"
LCT_wildtree.2.d: "Moonlight poured into a foggy Skupština conference room. The wisps of cigars danced around the attendees: Cehovi magnates, prominent leaders of other army cliques, and public officials who had no escape. At the head of it was Wild. "As agreed upon, your efforts will be rewarded... but the task is not yet complete. Those with an... insufficient Lakeish spirit have already risen up to reclaim what they wrongfully think is theirs. Their betrayal of the Grand Prince's heirtage outs them as targets. The Grand Prince himself thus requires your undying loyalty and unending reverence." He nodded to the table. "No more divisions among us. Follow the Grand Prince by the orders he has given me. No questions."\n\n"Who gave you the guns, eh!?" declared a general. A gun was placed on his temple. "What!? Colonel, stand down or—" Shot in the chest; another bullet grazes the neck. He lies silent.\n\n"The Grand Prince requires your undying loyalty and unending reverence," Wild repeated, dismissing the fear and tension clearing the smoke off the room. He eyed the clump of Cehvoi ponies on the side. "He requires quotas, constant audits. Your skills at enterprise must not be hoarded selfishly."\n\n"You can't just roll over us like that!" a bearded and spectacled company president shouted. "We won't stand for your—" Windows cracked. He fell down, bleeding. Sniper, no doubt.\n\n"The Grand Prince requires your undying loyalty and unending reverence," Wild said again, turning his gaze to the scared officials. "Use lethal force to quell the neighsayers under your jurisdictions. Report them to me, regardless of your affiliation with them." Gulps resound—the colonel pointed his gun at one, and the unseen rifle, surely at another."
LCT_wildtree.2.a: "The Grand Prince requires your loyalty and reverence."

LCT_wildtree.3.t: "Deep Six"
LCT_wildtree.3.d: "Westerly expected death to cut his plans short. Still, it was supposed to be at the claw of a mindless griff who hailed from the Reformisten, not... the unstoppable and unreasonable force that was Wild Tree, who had made quick yet fitting work of the other Lords: Solid Rocks crushed in a collapsing bunker, Daring Dream by her own rifle, Smoke Signal by mortar fire, Flaming Hot suffocated in his car... poor Star. She'd been the most honourable of them, radioing Westerly and several others to go deeper into hiding: she served as a distraction, interrupting broadcasts. She hadn't bought much time; Westerly hadn't even begun packing his belongings when Wild Tree appeared inexplicably in his bedroom, pistol in hoof.\n\n"Do you revere the Grand Prince?" asked Wild, still as stone.\n\nWesterly huffed. "What will it do in the end? I know what you want... the River Empire, as it once was. You'll turn to the east, leaving us exposed to the treacherous Reformisten lying in wait. Can't you see that?"\n\nWild only blinked. "Do you revere the Grand Prince?"\n\nAnd say he reveres the Grand Prince. Then what? How much help would he be to his fellow ponies, assisting the administration in taking lands that were already ruled by said ponies and thus needed no saving, no fighting for? Pony blood for pony blood, that was what the carnage would be. Senseless... suicidal.\n\n"I do not need to ask again, Mister Leeward.""
LCT_wildtree.3.a: "Wild Tree cocked his pistol."

LCT_wildtree.4.t: "A Glimmer of Renewed Magnificence"
LCT_wildtree.4.d: "Invitations had slipped into modest manors few and far across the country. Most of what remained of that magisterial class had taken after the Heavenly Snow old's life, taking up legal or bureaucratic careers to retain a sense of governing. Wild Tree's defiant cry for a princely restoration thus garnered their attention and their coin.\n\nUnder the watch of military attaches, trains rolled into Jezeragrad against the sunset in the sky and that reflected upon the lake, their high-born passengers funnelled into an abandoned manor that'd been turned into a generic multi-purpose venue. Within, that old true Lakeish majesty had been resurrected: old oil paintings, portraits of past Grand Princes, a great many swords arrayed on the walls that bounced pearls of light from crystal chandeliers.\n\nBy the dining hall's wooden and satin entrance, Wild Tree opened the door for them, whispered greetings in a three-piece suit. With everyone settled down at cartoonishly long tables, he closed the door to address all present.\n\n"I won't be long, but first," he began, raising a glass of alcohol, "I would like to thank all of you, in the name of the once-and-yet-again Grand Prince, for your cooperation. He appreciate those who don't sit on the laurels of their ancestors. In return for your service, you will continually build the splendour of your lines. In due time, all the titles and lands unrighteously stripped from you will be returned and more... but enough talk. You at least deserve a reprieve from your former plight.""
LCT_wildtree.4.a: "Whether by hoof, wing, or magic, glasses clinked and mirthful chatter broke through."

LCT_wildtree.5.t: "The Blueblooded Restoration"
LCT_wildtree.5.d: "The address, Gentle Fair hadn't bothered to check. Tales wormed their way from around Griffonia: Deponyan feasts, Aquileian wineries, Griffonian intrigue... political games buttressed by high-end amenities. Mansions and palaces flew in her mind, teeming with shadow conversations and alliances. Now, everything was right here in Lake City, right outside the open limousine door.\n\nWhat greeted her was not a palace: there stood a humble gate to a garden. Isolated miles away from Jezeragrad, babbling creeks and little lakes dotted the manicured landscape of moss below and tress above, bridges criss-crossing over rocks and lily pads and shiny fish. The scent of tiny pies wafted across the fragrance of flowers precisely put every corner and turn of the beaten path, leading her eyes to a sparse crowd of boats where occupants bobbed along to the dance of the waves, faces lit in vermilion by the hanging lanterns.\n\nHobbling down a path of flattened rocks, she found a hiding spot where other new nobles like her were hanging out, fellow royals with rediscovered genealogies and heritages. Fruit spirits laid out on a table over candles and more hazy lanterns, shadows casting long (even to the trees).\n\n Bells rang. Gentle's head turned to see town criers, bearing announcements for everyone to witness the Grand Prince so they can listen to his sublime words exclusively for the Lakeish high-born. "
LCT_wildtree.5.a: "To be in his presence...!"

LCT_wildtree.55.t: "Behind the Scenes"
LCT_wildtree.55.d: "Wild Tree scrutinised Heavenly Snow's attire: a three-piece suit garbed in tasteful Lakeish green, accented in royal crimson and gold, just long enough to trail into a robe that hung above the floor. "At the hooves of any other tailor, you'd be a clown. This... is masterful, a bridge between today's techniques and the art of Blessed Sword himself. You will look fantastic for our esteemed noble guests waiting outside."\n\nHeavenly Snow nodded, and this time, only one bead of sweat rolled down his muzzle. He had to admit to himself, he was a dapper prince before the mirror. Professional yet not pompous. His wife would've been proud to see him in this get-up.\n\n"Remember your posture," Tree intoned as if rattling off from a list. A touch of the hoof on Snow's jaw; he raised it up. "Do not slouch. Maintain eye contact. Walk on the designated paths to not anger the Ponikami. You may know these already, but I understand that this occasion as Grand Prince will be more personal, more intimate than your speeches to a packed plaza. Your memory must constantly be refreshed."\n\nSnow's throat tightened. Wild had unintentionally repackaged his parents' words. Mother and Father did not teach with the threat of a gun... not a single weapon could be found on Wild today.\n\nThe general-regent relaxed his withers. "Perhaps instead of a dozen items to remember, I will give you just one: pretend that you are serving your customers from back in your coffeehouse. The rules you've established for yourself there seem sufficient for a speech and a good time."\n\nThe memories of his parents in action, Snow instinctively gave a smile at the end of Wild's words.\nNone came in return."

LCT_wildtree.7.t: "Court of Sycophants"
LCT_wildtree.7.d: "There's a certain sense of familiar pride that Wild Tree can never stop being fond of. Perhaps it's the drums and trumpets singing in harmony with each other, a triumphant anthem of glorious and eternal victory in sync with the march of bootsteps in perfect rhythm. Perhaps he was a little vain for indulging in such a pleasure, but he couldn't care less. Seeing the faces of proud stallions with the best uniforms and guns the state could offer to them, alongside strong, rigorous training... they could keep the homeland safe. They could-\n\n"Gospodin Tree! Oh, it's so good to see you!"\n\nThe sound of a young stallion's voice broke Tree out from his self-inflicted haze, and with a twitch of his eyes he turned to look at whoever was grabbing at his attention. It was some... somepony who he had picked up from the officer academy and fast-tracked into the military due to his extreme(ly loud proclamations of) loyalty. But what he had in loyalty he lacked in... everything else.\n\nTree couldn't even open his mouth before the stallion began running his own about how grand the festival was, how it would show the world the might of Lake City: the whole nine yards. His babbling was so loud, in fact, that even though Tree eventually tried to turn around and keep his eyes on the parade, the stallion's speaking was too annoying to ignore. Whatever positive emotions Tree had at the start of the parade had been snuffed out by this, and he simply sighed, tuning out the pony's voice like static."

Flaming Hot reached for the closest batch of ice-cold Kiria-imported beer, Daring Dream guzzled down a wine bottle in seconds, and Solid Rocks kept slamming the table while repeating, "That’s how it’s done!"\n\nThe stench of Smoke Signal’s Rakija-laden breath reached Westerly’s nose as she grabbed his withers. "Whut’s wrung, Lee-wee?  We did the... coup-coup cluck, right? Took over those cuckoo griffons frem da—"\n\n"Get some water already, Smoke," Star Talent cut in as she sat her friend down; Star was the only other lord who hadn’t tasted alcohol tonight. "Sorry for the mess, Mr. Westerly. I’ll... keep her safe."\n\nThe commotion behind him continued as Westerly opened the nearest window. Outside, balloons flew to the sound of trumpets everywhere, with parades attracting flocks of hundreds if not thousands of citizens eager to see once more the military might of Lake City grace their every waking moment.\n\nIn the periphery of his vision, soldiers escorted a dozen Skupština representatives at gunpoint.\n\nWhere to, Westerly wouldn’t be told."

Oh, didn’t know about the curfew? Sorry, but we’ll tear this place apart for suspicious activity, just to be sure, see?"\n\nShe wasn’t the first nor the last pony Iron had seen paralyzed, though sometimes, it wasn’t fear that did it but awe. In Salt’s face, it was the latter: her eyes portrayed confidence, like that of a foal who’d studied laboriously for an exam and knew she’d pass.\n\n"Yeah, got nothing," Iron muttered to himself after thanking Salt for her co-operation. He put a hoof on the pedal of his police car, and the engine roared to life again. "Now, stallions, Mud Flat’s next. High-minded type. You all know poets are griffon-commie lovers, right?"\n\nAt Mud’s bungalow, notebooks spilled from cardboard boxes filled with lines exalting "the same spirit that instills in hoof and claw their being." One look was all it took for Mud to be in cuffs, though he was the first prisoner today to sit passenger-side.\n\nThat meant Iron could pat him on the withers, gesturing at the blocks of homes where the Žandarmerija’s rifles, batons, and hoofcuffs could come and go as they pleased.

LCT_six_lords.3.d: "The past weeks saw fear grip the remaining representatives who hadn’t been marched into who-knows-where. They’d welcomed the coup, unlike their harmonic brethren, but the Six Lords told them to wait their turn.\n\nThen, the Lords, represented by Westerly Leeward, allowed a session in the Skupština. Fifteen minutes, he said. The next morning, few answered; the rest had claimed it’d be a farce or a trap.\n\nThe anteroom before the House’s hall ended up as the venue, with Westerly standing in the middle of an impromptu semi-circle of occupied chairs.\n\n"We’ve instituted this parliament with good intentions," he began, pacing on the carpet. He made no eye contact. "Yet, a filth has spread across the nation. Democracy has turned our loyal soldiers into fickle voters, splintering into a disarray of disjointed interest groups. You may say that we are all united against the griffon and communist terrors, but you are blind to the greater terror that lies within this parliament, a wretched system where political divisions generate civil wars every day, only without the guns... even then, how else did Springtime come to power?"\n\nHe turned his back to them. Shadows marred the creases of his aging face.\n\n"Now, there’s only you, supposedly the most faithful. But the nature of creatures is predictable; leeches like you will gravitate to the greatest source of power. Which is us, I recognize, but once someone else dangles a fatter purse before your eyes, Jezeragrad will be nothing to you."\n\nWesterly raised a hoof.\n\nDoors from both sides opened. Uniforms and guns poured out, gloved hooves gagging the politicians and hoisting their struggling bodies out of their seats. Only then did those shrieking bodies notice Westerly having turned his face back to them.\n\n"The Skupština is a hovel of greedy pigs. The Lords shall make a clean sweep of this mess.

Posters plastered on the walls exhorted passers-by to sign up for boot camp; the children and the elderly were preached at to buy bonds for a war that hasn’t happened yet; a bookstore boasted a sale for military treatises and the history of Blessed Sword and Lake City’s golden age of militarism and iron-hoof rule. Of course, the newspapers declared the same headlines about the latest in Lakeish rifle developments: Star’s personal squad stood in their offices, ready to fire combat spells should they find falsehoods evading censors.\n\nThe looming gates of the brand-new Radio Jezeragrad station put Star in awe before she got out of her daze and trotted into the building. She’d heard of the wonders of this new technology, of utilizing the air to speak clearly to ponies throughout the nation and even across borders. Engineers had told her that, at a certain frequency, ponies hiding for safety from Hellquillian and Longswordian hooligans would hear her. Maybe a couple griffons, too, who’d managed to smuggle in a radio set.\n\nBut that audience would come later. The lights turned on in the studio, another engineer pointed at her, and the broadcast commenced. The microphone transmitted her words to the homes of Lakeponies eager to hear and heed what their new masters had to say about a promised glorious future.\n\n"Hello! This is Star Talent, and you’re listening to Hour 25, where the Lakeish truth matters!

LCT_six_lords.5.d: "The news reached latchkey teenager Cobalt Pond at lunch break along with his classmates: a young private, only a few years older than Cobalt, was rushed to the local hospital, suffering life-threatening injuries from a roving band of griffon brigands that haunted Jezeragrad’s outskirts. The criminals had been arrested, sentenced to penal labour.\n\nClass was suspended. His friends headed out to the commotion across the street. They said the authorities had took the griffons out of jail just to show them off in the public square.\n\nMr. Leeway could be spotted, but the alien prisoners stole Cobalt’s attention. He’d never seen a griffon since foalhood, when his father took him out on border patrol to see a Longswordian watchtower staffed by the vile things: wings to send them leaps and bounds to their prey, claws to pin their helpless victims down, beaks to rip off the skin and bone of sinless creatures. Vultures, his father said, before showing off a claw’s scars around his neck.\n\n"This is the final state of those who’ve dipped their claws in bloodbaths!" Westerly’s words brought Cobalt back to the present. He stood so close to Lake City’s savior now; his father would’ve been proud. "Massacring the innocent blackens the soul until their husks devolve into lifeless wandering pillagers!"\n\n"The predators must pay for their genocide!" a mare in the crowd cried out. Applause overtook her.\n\n"Yes, they must! The beaked devils must pay for the genocide of the Vartai ponies! If we fall to apathy, to griffish passivity, these ponies’ torture shall continue for another century! Shall we wait for our neighbours, this sham of an alliance, to act? Shall we abandon our duty and compassion to our kind?"\n\nBut the rest of the speech would be lost on Cobalt. Westerly’s assistants had made space in the crowd before planting a sign by the outlaws: "Speak your mind to the vulture.""

LCT_six_lords.6.t_1: "At the Gates" 
LCT_six_lords.6.d_1: "Flags watched over the Skupština, where, unlike the politicians of old, the Lords withstood the elements on a modest platform of wood. Before them stood a lake's worth of ponies, with pegasi in the back flying just to get a good look. An unarmed citizen among them was a rarity.\n\nWesterly had already gone on about the vaunted history of ponykind in Griffonia, about the individual spheres of peace and prosperity of Equus and, closer to home, the River Coalition. "But," he moved on, "hatched from the Herzland's Imperial egg is the foul spirits that are the knightly orders to our west. Their simple-minded raiders blinded us to the fruits of their hideous roots, that the robbers were only the spring and summer to an autumn harvest of hatred: the calls to return to Grover II's conquests, the fearmongering stirring griffons up to view a foal with murderous intent, and their most odious blight upon the world—the Reformisten and their bloodbath.\n\n"As we speak, a winter of carnage has befallen our neighbours. While Hellquill's knights give free rein to Wingfried's cabal, Longsword wallows in gory anarchy between the ruthless legitimisers of genocide, the cowardly mercenaries of the status quo, and the naive vanguards of socialism!\n\n"Lakeponies, the unparalleled energy and firepower of our army endows upon us a heavy responsibility. Vartai belongs to Vartai, no more and no less! So, shall we sit on our hooves and be spectators to the incomparable tribulations of our friends and family? No! It is time we step in and forge a peace for Vartai... and ensure that Ost-Griffonia answers for their aspirations for an entire species' extermination!""

LCT_six_lords.6.d_2: "Scores of bodies huddled around in the plaza to listen to Westerly's next words. By now, war had already been declared against Hellquill and Longsword; the other Lords had long been at the front, performing last-minute preparations.\n\n"...they've replaced one exploded keg of dynamite with another," Westerly continued. "I would implore those who disagree with our righteous army to list down whoever runs Longsword: craven and remorseless raiders, Grover-inspired nobles and knights, or socialists who dare place a dishonourable griffon on the same level as a pony who's lost their home, their wealth, and their loved ones in the bloodshed of the past decade!\n\n"Whatever new face guides Longsword will only perpetuate the cycle of persecution. They bandage up a cancer with their supposed new turn in policies! But this disease—of the spirit and the heart—must be rooted out, neutralised at the source. Devilish spirits seek to kill and destroy ponykind, not as a test like our own oni, but for destruction without end, without purpose, lurking in the shadows of this new Longswordian order.\n\n"So enough of waiting! There is indeed honour in the Soldier's Path as so many of our blessed souls have taken, but more so once we submit in service to those in need! We shall depose of the knightly orders' final rulers, clean the slate so we can start fresh, take every griffons' deeds into account—both resentful murderers and willing bystanders—to secure a future for our friends and family in Vartai! Fight not for senseless bloodletting, Lake City, but for your honour... and theirs!"\n\nApplause rocked the plaza, went halfway to making Westerly deaf."

LCT_six_lords.6.t_3: "The Dawn of Order..." 
LCT_six_lords.6.d_3: ""Perhaps, in another world," Westerly continued before Jezeragrad's pony-flooded streets, "we and Starry Night's partisans would've been allies. She is a rare example of a kind-hearted socialist, an honest believer in her ideology's ideals. Were it not for her organisation, the Longswordian Bloodbath would've been a total annihilation of ponykind in Vartai.\n\n"But an honourable demon is still a demon. The trajectory of socialism and its brothers is a civil war of the classes, sundering apart tight-knit communities and families via needless struggle. Have we not read of Stalliongrad's bloody revolution, of the indiscriminate hanging of nobles on the flimsy grounds of their being nobles? The farmers' socialism Starry Night proclaims, idyllic on paper, will only falter in the face of a fast-industrialising reality, pitting sibling against sibling, neighbour against neighbour, until Vartai's very unifying identity crumbles under the weight of infinite squabbling classes.\n\n"And tell me, Lakeponies, how does Starry plan to treat the griffons? The genociders may be dead, but she extends amnesty to quails susceptible to griffon supremacy's poison. Reformisten remnants and radical knights will feign obedience until Starry and her confidants, blinded by socialism's naive ideals, find their backs peppered with knives!\n\n"We shall enforce peace in the frontier, make clear to the current government that we shall keep them safe from the griffon threat without and the socialist discord within. Under our hoof, Vartai shall no longer be divided—by species or by class—for both worker and industrialist shall join hooves against the griffon threat!""
LCT_six_lords.6.a_3: "...against starry-eyed darkness."
#4: Golden Morning
LCT_six_lords.6.t_4: "Equal in Death" 
LCT_six_lords.6.d_4: ""I've spoken long enough about the terrors of the Reformisten,"  Westerly proclaimed at the very border of Jezeragrad, the gates flanked by a field of guns and cannons, "but our more immediate threat, Golden Morning and his idea-possessed followers, arm their words not with venom but honey. They claim to follow our ideals of a frontier without the spirit of slaughter.\n\n"But in his striving for that ideal, he fails to ground it in reality, instead founding a New Griffonia where ponies and griffons must be equal against their will! He does not vet said griffons for their pure hearts, does not cleanse them of the Herzland's toxin; he mashes both species together, like a hammer against a dozen nails, with blank forgiveness for all but the most heinous of leaders! What justice is that? What equality is that but an unsustainable bedlam? It is only a different face of griffon supremacy—for griffon genociders to get away with mass murders, while innocent ponies reap persecution for being too shy before a beak!\n\n"Golden Morning, therefore, cannot be negotiated with in good faith. By rifle and cannon, we shall rid this radical of his Herzland-infested mindset and save Vartai from its last griffon-hearted ruler. Vartai will only rest when we extract justice from every griff responsible and thoroughly wipe out the griffon threat in its totality!""
LCT_six_lords.6.a_4: "No alternative for a New Griffonia but ruin."

LCT_six_lords.6.d_5: ""...thus, only us honourable soldier-citizens can break the cycle of revenge. We shall step in as paternal peacekeepers, to free Vartai then lead it into its own sphere of prosperity everlasting."\n\nHis speech's last words still rang in his head when he and the other Lords took the train to the frontline, traveling in a private carriage.\n\n"The blustering folly of a stallion Povner is," Westerly hissed as he nursed his glass of water. "Does he not see anything beyond the red mist of revenge?"\n\n"Surely, he could be valuable to us," Flaming suggested. "Give him enough guns to soften the Herzland for us in the near future. I can go there myself, actually—"\n\n"Have you not read his own speeches, heard what they say behind his back?" asked Westerly. "He seeks to burn Griffenheim and all of the Herzland into ash. The moment the rest of Griffonia learns of that, what then? After decimating Povner for good, every surviving griffon nation shall turn their sights on us and the rest of the River Coalition so the likes of him can never rise again! Do you understand me, Mister Flaming Hot? How this lunatic will drag us into a war we can't win?"\n\nThe other Lords, stunned silent, turned to Flaming. His ears turned down, wordless.\n\nWesterly's cough broke the cold feeling. "I apologise for that, but I've kept enough updates on the situation in Vartai to ascertain the... entity... this Povner is. No compromise of the sort shall be entertained, lest his stupidity has the landmass clamouring for our heads."\n\nWith that, Westerly stormed out of the carriage."

LCT_six_lords.6.d_6: "The photographer-turned-rebel ducked below the window of a makeshift radio shack. The woods afforded much cover and her mane matched the barks' colours, but Reformisten griffons took pride in being apex predators. She held on to images of family she'd saved from the house fire. She clutched a rifle she'd never fired in her life, counting the steps the griffon patrol made on untouched soil.\n\nBut a noise from the griffons' radios later, they flew away.\n\nExcited whispers from deeper in the shack echoed right after. Somepony was talking; everypony else was assured. They zeroed in on the right frequency; the photograhper and her comrades tuned in:\n\n"...but as Vartai has fallen under the boots of the skull-wielding Reformisten, the responsibility to shine as a beacon of liberty now falls upon us! All you honourable warriors, revitalised by the blood of Blessed Sword and his worthy successors, will tear the Imperial savages out of the homes they've raided, to answer for every single widow and orphan they've made to pay for the bloody ideal of griffon supremacy!\n\n"To those in Vartai who can hear me, know this! We shall come to your aid! The army of Jezeragrad shall be loyal to you until the very end! I promise you this: your oppressors shall never return!""

The traveling Westerly could smell the fresh wooden scents; his Earth pony magic, if tapped into long enough, could let him feel their flux, how the earth moved.\n\nIt moved freely, released from a griffish chokehold.\n\nBut Star said the nearest settlement was close, and so he raised his eyes with his armed entourage. The sight of worn down ghettos had him slackjawed. Even those with significant prior partisan help had decomposed into worse states than that of his own humble hometown. Tin roofs, unevenly stacked floors, muddy markings that shouldn't be called roads, putrid stinks across thinning fields of wilted crops.\n\nThe Vartai villagers' cautious curiosity then turned to relief when the soldiers unpacked food sacks and a squad carried materials to repair and plow.\n\nIt was a space of unity, dare he'd say "harmony". Rewarding the soldiers with Daring and Smoke for their boundless loyalty and strength in victory was for later. For now, it was time to rebuild and refocus: griffon leadership must still be dealt with; bread and proper homes were only bandages slapped on top of a deeper wound. Under the Lake Army's military command, reconstruction here would go well.\n\nReconstruction and rearmament. The knightly orders and the Reformisten were borne of a wicked Herzlander hen, after all."

"It's a unicorn, sir. She's radioing her—"\n\n"Hello!"\n\nThe griffs screamed at the freshly teleported unicorn now inside their house.\n\n"You imbecile!" cried the Reformisten leader, his gun trained at her head. "Don't you have the common sense to run away from danger?! You're surrounded now!"\n\n"It's us surrounding you surrounding me!" she replied in sing-song before turning on her radio again. "Smoke, you've got the artillery aimed here? Do you copy?"\n\n"Copy, and just give the order already, Daring," an intoxicated voice crackled through, "unless you wanna get fried with the chickens."\n\n"Nah! Charge and fire away!" She turned off the radio, then cocked her head toward the griffons. "Smoke told me you were the last ones left. The knights are done, royalty's done, and now it's your turn! I'd leave if I were you, but..." The door and windows glowed in her magic.\n\nShe disappeared in a flash.\n\nThey banged the doors, shot the windows, but the door burned their claws, and the windows only cracked, suddenly bulletproof.\n\nThe last sound they heard was the barrage of shells in the distance."

I know that, despite our massive success, no fight comes without its scars... and its fallen. The griffons aren't pushovers; they fought back, the savages they are, and took many of our... loved ones. Our family, our friends, our neighbours from across the street..."\n\nA moment of silence. It wasn't far-fetched for her that hundreds of ponies then turned to their shrines at home, burning incense or giving up an offering.\n\nStar obnoxiously blew her nose and cleared the snot away. "But I can assure you that they haven't died in vain! Even now, even here, ponies are turning the scorched earth into a thriving realm! Our soldiers are rebuilding burned down homes and villages, and providing for everyone's needs like a consistent supply of food and water. No longer shall our brethren in Vartai be brutalised, divided by foreign devils! Here, just like in Lake City, Earth ponies bless the fields, pegasi bless the rains, and unicorns bless the aether! This is the liberation, the co-prosperity, that ponykind in Griffonia must seek, free from the Imperial oppressors!"\n\nThe engineer cued another music break.

LCT_six_lords.10.d: "The air reeked of old, drying blood. The photographer's words kept flowing like blood, blind to her lone listener.\n\nIt'd been despair after soul-eating despair, just getting it all out. The corpses had long been buried, but the pony ghettos were still taking time to rebuild. The Lakeish forces had been helping, but the stealing away of neighbours to work camps, the random hangings of friends in broad daylight, the mass of "purified" griffons chanting for their extinction...\n\nA mother, taken away, executed in the mad count's own mansion for his amusement. A father, whisked away, sentenced to rot in a compound of stone. Companions, given lashes, pushed to the side, shot to pieces just so somegriff would turn them into changelings, holes in their legs and all.\n\nThe last straw: the inferno that ravaged her home; the griffon arsonists, caught fleeing but let go by the judge. What survived were only her camera and her photos. Covered in ashes, surrounded by the slums of her kind, she'd broken down in a sobbing mess of the strongest group hug the remainder of her friends could give.\n\nThe closing of a notepad snapped her back to reality.\n\n"Thank you very much for your time, Miss Everset Shutter," the pegasus—Flaming Hot, she recalled—said as his wing took his pencil away.

A few signatures; Caldera's own cutie mark stamped on it. She'd been called up.\n\nShe took a slow, chilly breath. All that was left to do was to be assessed by the clerks at the local conscription centre and see where she'd be placed: patrol duty in Vartai, or immediate training for the Herzland invasion force.\n\nDressed with a ceremonial robe at her mother's insistence, she exited her home. Lights turned on in her sleepy town under the soon-to-be twilight; she wasn't this morning's only conscript.\n\nShe heard scrapes, echoes of yelling. It was somepony young just like her, begging to stay home, to sleep a little longer. His guardians told him that the army would whip him into good shape, to be better than the good-for-nothing sloth he'd regressed into. She stole a look behind her: the last she saw was police dragging the unruly son into a hay wagon, chained.\n\nCaldera's mother chided the overgrown colt from far away, then turned to her with sweet words and bittersweet tears. She promised that, before she marched away, the whole family would visit the local shrine and hoist a banner in her name. As was custom, it would fly on until she returned home, purified by blood, undoubtedly with more honour than her ancestors' combined.\n\nAlready, Caldera felt the ghost of a rifle in her empty hooves."

LCT_six_lords.12.d: ""The minimum is ten thousand bits each," dictated Westerly to Lakeish troops wielding notebooks and pencils, appraising each curious piece in the storage room. The raids on some Reformisten estates like Edler von Wingenberg‘s had yielded unusually religious prizes. "The pre-Boreas statuettes can go upwards of twenty thousand with Smoke’s network of archaeologists. Rumare’s runes can be offered back to the barony for a hefty sum..."\n\nAcross Vartai, Westerly and the other Lords ransacked every knightly estate, noble castle, and stocked-up armory of the griffon leadership, though most were not as exact as Westerly, with Flaming content to haul a count’s belongings in wagons for a non-stop trip to Lake City.\n\nBack in Westerly’s office in Jezeragrad, after raucous parades where loot had been thrown to the adoring population, Daring let go of her magical grip and the sack emptied of its valuables: gems, jewelry, heirlooms, and personal weapons (which Smoke laid claim on), along with the clanking of thousands of idols spilling out to a desk now creaking at the weight.\n\nAs the flow of idols gathered in Star’s hooves, a strange joy (or the booze) crept up. Flaming crowed about how he’d wear much of his jewelry to put Equestrian royalty to shame, and Solid said he’d have enough to reinvest into sturdier walls and forts on the front. On top of that, Daring was already scribbling approximations on how much wealth the whole Herzland would give them, if Vartai’s monetary harvest had already given this much.\n\nBut it was only then Star realized that Westerly hadn’t come back from his bathroom break.\n\nThe next morning, she’d learn that Westerly was still alive. And that he had spent the night discreetly visiting the shrines. The more humble Lakeponies had delivered the loot to their Ponikami as an offering and a welcome addition to the spirits’ earthly vessels."

LCT_six_lords.13.d: "Deep in Shayrmia, a bronze statue of Blessed Sword as high as pine trees towered over its visitors. His immortal image waved his famous longsword that'd slain over a thousand griffons.\n\nAt its base, a kiosk had established itself, selling limited edition books detailing Blessed Sword's life and conquests. Beside them, hoofbooks were also on sale, exhorting the reader to follow Put Vojnika or The Soldier's Way and all its virtues. The line stretched for half a kilometer, with patriotic marching music cracking out of the radios.\n\nAmid the festive atmosphere, Star and Westerly stood in line; the other four Lords had reserved their own book copies for delivery. The present Lords got nods and good wishes from the other visitors; they replied with hoofshakes and warm regards for loved ones who'd been spirited away to war.\n\nOnce the two got their books, they retreated to a park spruced up by Earth pony-grown cherry blossoms and the tinkling of artificial creeks. Shrines bloomed forth; fortune tellers predicted good omens for the future conflict with the Herzland. All of these, said a tour guide, were arranged according to first-century standards.\n\nThen, at the back of the park lay exhibits of the Službuniti, the River Empire's medieval military caste, purported to be the true ancestors to Nimbusia's armed citizen class. Names of these time-honoured Službuniti were emblazoned upon plates that also relayed tales of their heroic deeds. Foals pulled their parents to the statues, exclaiming how "cool" they looked and how "awesome" it must've been to be one of these super-warriors.\n\n"Blessed Sword would be so proud to see us returning to his ways," Star said. "Don't you agree?"\n\nWesterly's gaze had fixed itself upon the tallest armour. The sword it wielded pierced through a facsimile of a griffon's beak, its tongue sticking out.

The foals wore wooden sandals, not proper shoes or boots, clanking against the floor as they performed their drills, carrying sticks that substituted for rifles.\n\nTheir order-barking "sergeant" was propped up by wheels, her hindlegs amputated. Her voice was shrill and raspy, even when she moralised about the Soldier's Path and its virtues in between orders. Eyes front, present arms...\n\nOnce the drill was done, she wheeled herself to a student at the front, her tears welling up. "You and your classmates would do us proud, serving Lakeponies in the future. Maybe not in this war but surely in another to come, your descendants will thank you for your sacrifice and the good life you'll be giving them with your own... just as I have with two of my own legs."\n\nThe class erupted in applause, and when the stomping simmered down, they shelled her with questions about her own service, about the time wicked beaks held her up and would've taken her sacred life were it not for her determination and skill. She said that when the army calls her up once more, she would wheel herself to the front and shoot the griffs down from the sky—by their legs, when she can.\n\nWhen the hour ended, Star and Flaming thanked the teacher for her dedication to raise up the next generation of champions."

His smile was infectious, at least to Deeds.\n\n"This is Big Money, my son," Deeds said with a flourish. "A young and fresh face, shining with the promise of an illustrious career. I'll be in an advisory role in my conglomerate to train him in everything business, and you shall teach him in everything military. Make him your equal or get him to do your bidding... just keep him safe. I promise I will cause you no trouble; that's all I can offer."\n\nHis son performed a salute, that grin still stuck on his muzzle. "Big Money here, reporting for duty!"\n\nStar resisted the urge to slap a hoof to her face. No one could replace Westerly, but he knew the economy, had a hoof in a hoofful of booming enterprises, and otherwise had influence with the Cehovi's fledgling successors.\n\nA buffoon like Big Money was better than an empty seat in the war room."

A morbid curiosity grabbed him by the withers: nobility, knights, and the like would be marching down the streets. From what he'd heard, they already faced well-deserved abuse on the way here: from soldiers jeering at them in Griffenheim, through Vartai's Posniaks claiming that Boreas abandoned his own creation, to the western Lakeish villages where those who practiced Ponikami planted arrows and spikes for the griffons to avoid (while their pony superiors simply trotted on the sidewalks).\n\nThen, they came.\n\nPreceded first by Lake Army's brass band, the scores of griffons came marching in chains and shackles, under the close watch of the other soldiers and the local police. Their grimy, tallowy feathers and reeked of dirt, dust, mud, blood. Their beaks had been worn down, and dozens of wings had patches of feathers missing. Bloodshot eyes were the norm; a few raised their heads beyond a pronounced bow.\n\nNotably, some bloodstained chains were empty.\n\nThe crowds hemmed Cobalt in as they cheered the army then reviled their living, breathing spoils.

Or even less. She forgot. Sometimes, they stayed; sometimes, they moved. Back and forth, back and forth. March, patrol, wait. March again.\n\nAt nights, she and her squad hunkered down with a radio. Anthems played, dramas aired, and Star Talent wished them good night, for the rising sun to bless them tomorrow.\n\nThis morning, that rising sun brought home a speech. Star was addressing the nation again, in Jezeragrad with the other Lords: Go join the army! Don't wait for the draft! Work as one!

The radio show and the newspapers hallowed the increasing casualties as war heroes; nothing was more honourable than to die for Jezeragrad while walking The Soldier's Way. But there was a stark difference between martyrdom and mass suicide.\n\nShe yearned to keep her eyes shut all the way to the train station. The sidewalk asked her questions—about glory, about food, about griffons, about missing sons and daughters. The other Lords' shouting match that greeted her when she arrived at the farthest military base made her long to pierce her ears, to block out any interrogation.\n\nWhen peace finally prevailed in the war room, Star cleared her throat. \"It's unmistakable that things haven't gone according to plan.\"\n\n\"Great sleuthing, Sherclop Hooves!\" Money yelled, but his everyone else's glares doused his cocky attitude. \"Okay, okay!

They lump us ponies, a diverse set of creatures,  into a dangerous sum simply because we are different! Simply because we have land that they do not.\"\n\nThe next blasphemy was burning the flag of Lake City, with the Grovers and countless generic griffon subjects devouring it, bleeding the fabric dry as real blood flowed into the barren soil. No music played; only the crackle of flames tortured their ears.\n\n\"How else could they have gotten this far into our sacred lands?

Trotting out on Jezeragrad’s ancient streets, Star was warmly greeted by fellow citizens who saluted her with newspapers showing off images of their latest victory: Lakeponies had stood tall in the night, hind hooves nailing down a bloodied griffon while the orange glimmers of a Herzlander base on fire lit up his fallen rifle.\n\nA train trip later to the frontlines, she found most of the Lords eagerly waiting for her. \"Where’s Money?\"\n\n\"Playing taskmaster at a factory,\" Solid replied as the rest escorted her to a nearby base. \"He is a coward, not coming here while we push forward with real progress.\"\n\nDaring laid a hoof on Star’s withers. \"At this rate, if we follow the plan, we’ll be in Feathisia in a week!\"\n\n\"Just another opportunity to pound more beaks into submission,\" Smoke quipped, drifting like in a daydream. \"It truly is a beauty, seeing the flames...\"\n\n\"And after that, you can see me,\" Flaming said, sidling up to Smoke’s wings. \"Having studied Feathisian alcohol to a great extent, I believe a jenever would be suitable for us?\"\n\nSolid’s chuckle distracted Star from the ensuing three-way argument.\n\nThe outside world, past the rumbling of tanks and planes, got her notice by the marching and singing of a new battalion in tune.

No orchestra played softly for a waltz; a bunch of table-smackers and Equestrian choir rejects belted out ballads while dozens danced to their erratic beat.\n\nStar could spot the other Lords who hadn't retired for the night: Smoke, who sat at a bar drinking the night away, and Big Money who lounged beside her. Past the happy chaos, Flaming led her there. \"Hey, why don't you loosen up?

The spray of Aquilean champagne from a rooftop hit him square in the face; he almost didn't restrain his tongue at the exuberant celebrant.\n\n\"If you think that's crazy,\" Flaming said, also waving to the crowd, \"you should check the mares on the back!\" Back there, Daring kept shooting magical beams into the air like a sapient spotlight, unable to remove the insane grin stuck on her muzzle, while Smoke kept mouthing \"boom!\" and pulling the rope on the empty artillery she was leading.\n\nWhen the Lords turned the corner, the roaring throng flooded Money's ears. \"Jezeragrad can't hold a candle to this!\" \n\nWhich prompted Flaming to pull Money to the side, discreetly whispering, \"That's because we're rubbing it in their faces.

Paintings and jewelry were carted out en masse, crowns and fabrics transported out of the gates. Imported goods from Equus and Zebrica lay together in common sacks and rags, to be used by savages who knew no better. Religious scripture and relics were not exempt from their theft; he could only pray that Boreas would not burn the city while he was still in it.\n\nThe pounding grew louder.\n\nThe thought of flying had been killed when he injured his wings not in an attempt to hide from the ponies storming his home. He could imagine why they took so long getting to his room: commissioned paintings of his ancestors from five hundred years ago, swords and shield preserved through the ages, genealogical tomes that would be ripped apart or sold in the black market for petty cash—they were precious loot that couldn't be missed.\n\nThey yelled at the door, screaming his name.\n\nTo jump out the window and try to fly was a death sentence, and suicide would be a bleak full stop to the dynasty he should've held.

Daring pumped her chest, claiming that she'd brought it from the Imperial Palace itself.\n\nSolid had declined taking any part of the Herzland, citing the need for Jezeragrad and Vartai to be protected by its most competent defender.\n\nAn eager Daring levitated the marker to draw a curve parallel to the northern border. \"Imagine all the wargaming we could have there! The north's full of vicious foes we could fight a dozen times over!\"\n\nSmoke, in her drunken stupor, did the same halfway through the south before her marker slipped off the table, leaving a red line across its surface. Her mumblings translated to \"guns... birds...\"\n\nFlaming pointed at the Herzland's southeast. \"Heard the angry river and the catering got histories, and look at that!

It's already well developed. I'd rather have my work done in places that need improvement! That'd be a real accomplishment!\" What went unspoken was that his territory wouldn't border any foreign power, leaving him to to his little military-industrial complex.\n\nWhich left Star with, in the present day, much of the Imperial core, all of Yale, and pieces of Bronzehill and Greifenmarschen.

That was dismissed as hogwash: Star was the sanest pony among them, not mentally unhinged or just plain unfit for the position.\n\nStar took the floor: Why were the nobles here? Katerin answered that they had heard about the new partitioning of the Herzland, that it was unacceptable. So said he, the lines had no respect for history, for ethnic boundaries, for culture groups or languages, not even for species as Bronzehill's dogs were divided up without thought. The whole of it was nonsense, an overtly malicious and short-sighted landgrab.\n\nStar asked why were the nobles here again. Katerin told her that, surely, as the most reasonable Lord of the six, she could bring reason back to their senses. It would certainly be easier to rule lands of a common culture, a common language, a common group of any kind—\n\nHis eyes met the barrel of her pistol.\n\nThe nobles' terrified exclamations were silenced by Star's last words: \"Do.

If it were solely up to her, she'd spend the rest of her life planning this out with her majors and colonels, in pursuit of the endless puzzles that warfare posed to her.\n\nBut warfare wasn't the only thing ponies breathed. In the territory of the Northern Occupation Righteous Forces, they still needed a stable government.\n\nSo she planned out a week-long tour through her lands, starting out with learning civilian economics from thrifty Bronzehill diamond dogs, then coming down to her strip of Strawberry where wine was served, and good talk was had with the local pony delegates as griffon musicians played in the background for pay. She capped off her trip by the sea, spending the weekend in Rottendedam by immersing her mind in the soft sounds of water rippling from her boat through the canals, all rowed by griffons under threat of execution.\n\nIt all ended with a relaxing game of chess with her confidants, drinking shots of delicious local alcohol. They laughed like crazy in the balcony over every upset, every outstanding move.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, several griffons watched from below that and the pegasus soldiers guarding the roof, fearful of their new sovereign, the mad strategist."

LCT_six_lords.41.d: "It'd been agreed upon that Star would lead the precious Imperial core of the heartlands, propped up by the innovative erudites of Yale and the hard-working diamond dogs of Bronzehill.\n\nBut concrete reasons lay behind the other Lords' eagerness to hoof such a treasure away: occupying Griffenheim for this long was still a blasphemy, a black mark that any pro-griffon movement would use to stir up violent support; Yale's scholars, in pursuit of progress, asked too many questions, a dangerous prerequisite for revolution; and finally, the adage would prove true that diamond dogs were a griffon's best friend—Bronzehill's stated loyalty to the Grovers could not be ignored when a usurper sat on the throne.\n\nBut she steeled her hoof. Nothing came easy, especially with having gone this far in trampling the Imperial threat once and for all, for the safety and freedom of ponykind.\n\nIt would be as ambitious as counting the stars.\n\nSo she took the microphone, the rush of the murmuring crowd before her coming back to her senses. She humbly stood at street level, right before the Palace's gates. While a great many ponies were in attendance, she found more than a few griffons listening in, their looks inscrutable for now.\n\nHer speech thus began, hopefully assuring her audience that the aspirations of the nation of Star Counter weren't empty promises."

LCT_six_lords.42.d: "Upon leaving the esteemed Imperial core, the difference was like time-traveling to the past: sturdy stone roads became muddy dirt paths, gallant and landed aristocrats made way for rugged farmers plowing the fields, and the scent of flowers died to a stench wafting its way into Flaming's nose. The high speed of his car trip couldn't chase the foul odour away.\n\n"Where are we?!" Flaming shouted at his driver. "We must've crossed the border to Griffonstone!"\n\n"No, this is it," said his driver calmly. "This is Katerin. Angriver's just further down. It's slightly better from what I've heard."\n\n"What do you mean 'slightly'? I thought... I thought Katerin and Angriver were historically significant locations!"\n\n"I've sacked better 'historically significant locations', sir," he said with a chuckle.\n\nHis entrance into Katerinburg only soured his first impressions. The stink of the marshes and the sewers (in the rare parts that had them) attacked his nose and made him puke; hastily reconstructed houses and stores looked more like rushed encampments than real livable buildings, thanks to the mad princess's ill-advised relocation of the entire city. The castle and palace, now his new base of operations with its imperious cleanliness, only provided a small relief.\n\nBut as those stately walls hid the outside world from view, he couldn't shake the feeling that he ruled over nothing but dregs."

LCT_six_lords.43.d: ""Fire!"\n\nA hundred howitzers rang out in song, filling the air with sputtering peals, firing at the command of a whiskey-drinking Smoke.\n\nShe'd had it good for the past few weeks. That her territory was one of the smaller ones didn't matter; it gave her less time to deal with the administrative grind, and more time to arm the nation with coercive "instruments of persuasion."\n\nHer civil servants eventually convinced her to stop firing shells into the river, so she moved on through captured towns and newly established military outposts, inspecting their arsenals along the way. Each loyal soldier she met could handle and maintain their rifle well; it pleased her that both young and old could operate a tank or coordinate to land a shell on target when called to it.\n\nAnd though the war had just ended, ponies were still lining up in recruitment centers. While Smoke initially resented "standing around and doing nothing but smile", she found herself with genuine joy and hope upon each pony who passed the standards then the test for conscription, even if they ended up in reserves. Belts in the religious style were made to commemorate each new private and sergeant, and come nightfall, a party was held to celebrate the high numbers of recruits. As was tradition, Smoke was first and last in line for drinks.\n\nWhile the griffons living in her territory fear whatever she would do next—rumors abounded that she'd build a black site where her researchers would devise unheard-of weapons of mass destruction—that was all overblown and hypothetical.\n\nFor now, there were howitzers to fire and soldiers to hire. And maybe an enemy to fire them on in the mire."

LCT_six_lords.44.d: "Several made deals and signed contracts later, the plains of the central Herzland's opened up to Big Money who'd donned a hat for the occasion, his contractors in construction digging the foundations just ahead.\n\n"Beautiful, isn't it?" he said to the forepony. "Steel mills here in just a few months' time. Or weeks! You'll be building New Manehattan right here in no time!"\n\n"Sir, there's already a New Manehattan in New Mareland."\n\n"We'll call it New New Manehattan! That'll show them!"\n\nSupervising the work was surprisingly relaxing for once, a world of difference from his days in Vartai and Lake City as the benevolent dictator of manufacturing. Today, he got his reports from across his holdings via letter, putting to reality his plans for the rest of the region, that his entire chunk of land could be just like Manehattan every square meter of the way. It would be a haven for pony entrepreneurs disillusioned with the old money in Griffonia's other pony nations. And for arms dealers with their lucrative trade.\n\nBut the urban centers had yielded to him the most valuable assets of them all. Sure, some of his co-Lords and many of his employees had rather unsavoury views on the griffons, but given the abundance of griffons in the work gangs for these steel mills alone, one thing was clear:\n\nThey offered good labour on the cheap."

A light turned on to astound visitors with the splendour of the Holy Pony Empire.\n\nHectic had been the night of its unveiling as the Lords congratulated many brave heroes, granting them numerous medals and ribbons. After the ceremony, everyone left quickly; tomorrow would bring great responsibilities.\n\nWhen everyone else left, the Lords stood up from the chairs on the dais. Under the warm glow of the map's light, the creases on their forehads had grown sharper, and the bags under their eyes had dug deeper. But when they smiled, the burdens of the Empire lifted from their withers. "It's been an honour," one of them said. It didn't matter who said it or who started the hoofshakes that turned into hugs and promises of seeing each other in a grand reunion one day.\n\nAfterwards, they, too, left. Solid exited first, the only one take a train, heading back to Lake City. Daring drove Money and Smoke to their territories before she retired to her own. Flaming took off with one uneasy wink at Star before rounding a corner, never to be seen in Griffenheim for a time.\n\nStar Talent was then alone, turning off the map's light."

The Harmonists are an umbrella group united by the benevolence found in Equestrian alicorn rule, which is to be manifested in extending said benevolence to the griffon population. Their good intentions betray a naivete in re-introducing weak-willed virtues such as unwarranted forgiveness into the Empire and allowing griffons to subvert it from within.\n* 1b. The Harmonists take  umbrage in Svetigrad. They are non-violent, making up for a lack in arms with public protests and campaigns.  This has turned them into unintentional peacekeepers for the other three resistance wings. For the undecided, siding with the harmonists is the safe moral-high-ground option.\n* 1c. Demoralisation is our primary counter-harmony vector. Public demonstrations can be allowed but must be shown to be ineffective.\n* 2a. The Communists are successors to Starry Night's partisans. Against common strands of socialism, they have prioritised the farmers' revolution over that of modern-day workers', though they are fast pivoting towards the latter.\n* 2b. They are not as given to disruptive methods as their historical counterparts in Stalliongrad, but have shown a willingness to revolt. An ideology of eternal revolution/class struggle necessitates constant open conflict, prefaced with demands for "workers' rights" that are crafted to not be acceptable without crippling the Empire's capabilities.\n* 2c. Counter-destabilisation is our primary counter-communist vector.

Now? At the dead of night? Why would... Solid Rocks's mind, extremely addled with a bottle of hard whiskey, never got to the stage of processing the danger of answering the door as one of Griffonia's most wanted men. Instead, his emotional high flashed an image of his ex-wife. A soldier of his? One of the other lords? Maybe just a friend he hadn't seen in a while?

They later left the hangar, and Daring gestured to the sky for Star to see fighters flying in formation. "Not all of us are born with wings, unlike the griffs, but we'll catch up.

LCT_six_lords.202.d: "For all his short time in the spotlight along with his own antagonism against the army as it'd been, Wavebreaker still shone a light to many soldiers, especially his fellow pilots. His consistent service ended with the height of heroism, cementing him as a true Službuniti.\n\nSo when Star received poster desgins from across the nation for recruiting pilots, Wavebreaker was a fountain of inspiration. The official prompt was "A Službuniti and/or the Blessed Sword rules the skies"; the lucky winners would see their designs on walls all over Lake City on top of juicy offers in the army's public relations wing.\n\nAnd much of the work had already been done for her. Whether they were old-timey callbacks or bold attempts at modernism, the spectrum of submissions unanimously portrayed Wavebreaker as a divine hero, inadvertently cleaning his image up from its Harmonist stain. If he were here right now, he would be fuming at how his face was twisted to serve the same craven Lords that had sucked the army dry of "real warriors"... but he was half-right; the Lords had to keep everyone in line, and now, it was a well-oiled machine. Wavebreaker wasn't really a dirty Harmonist, after all; he simply wanted reforms, miscalculated who to ally, and got caught in the crossfire.\n\nThanks to him, a hundred little Wavebreakers would take to the skies. Unlike the original, they'd obey without a question."

LCT_flaminghot_guh.1.d: "Back in Lake City and suave as ever, clad in a classic Puerto Caballan button-up shirt (with half the buttons not actually up), Flaming Hot smoothly slid across the marble flooring towards the large wooden doors that barred his path to the governmental crisis meeting room. However, the floor had only very recently been cleaned, and Flaming found himself unable to apply any friction against the floor to catch his slide, ending up crashing directly through the door and fell flat on his face.\n\nThe entire room, previously bustling and yelling just mere seconds ago, suddenly fell into a complete silence, as every official within turned to stare at the new Flaming Hot mess on the floor.\n\n"Yeowch... that smarts..." Flaming slowly picked himself up off of the floor, dusting his shirt off. As his gaze raised up to the individuals surrounding him, the stark quiet pervading the room finally became known to him. "I, uh... hey guys. I'm back!" Trying to lighten the mood, Flaming struck a pose, and almost fell over again, just about catching himself before he did. \n\n"F-... Flaming? Flaming Hot?" All the way from across the end of the room came the voice of Star Talent, evidently baffled by the sudden appearance of her friend and co-ruler. "Are you... where have you been?! What's with the get-up and the, the... where did you go?" She quickly galloped across the room, darting between the still-stunned officials crowding the area, a dearly concerned expression across her face.\n\nFlaming gave her a warm smile and pointed a hoof at his shirt, "Oh, well, you see, I took a trip down south. You know, for our whole diplomacy thing that we've got going on."\nStar replied, "That YOU'VE got going on, yes. Where did you go that you were gone for EIGHT months?"\n"Oh, uh, a place called Aestlonia." \n\nThe mood on Star Talent's face turned from 'concern' to 'confusion'. "Aes-... what? Where is that? How far south did you go..?" \n"You know, like, a fair distance. It's in South-East Zebrica you see, and-"\nStar quickly turned away from him and examined a large map across a table in the centre of the room. Her eyes went wide as her brows furrowed in a sense of agitated bewilderment.\n\n"YOU WENT HOW FAR?! WHAT- WHO- WHAT EVEN IS AN AESTLONIA?! HOW DID YOU GET THERE?!" She rocketed straight back up into Flaming Hot's face, their muzzles almost pressed together.\n\n"Uh... I just... went. There was a boat, and-"\n"You JUST went?! You just DID it?! How long was the ride?" \n"You know... about three months there and three months back from Bakara."\nStar Talent fell silent as an emotion unknown to equinekind began to rise up inside of her.\n\nFlaming Hot soon found himself the victim of house arrest for the foreseeable future."

 #Solid Rocks fort building demand
 LCT_six_lords_demands.1.t: "The Hoof Which Blocks..."
 LCT_six_lords_demands.1.d: "At one of our lesser protected borders just yesterday, the normally stoic Solid Rocks has snapped at several officers. What lay beyond Lakeish territory was just a stone’s throw away, yet there stood "nothing where their corpses will pile up under our unceasing fire! Instead of letting them trample all over us, let's build some real strongpoints here, shall we?"\n\nThis has led the local command in our [?LCT_bordering_state_target_var.GetAdjective] border to push for a stronger defensive line on par with the rest of our fair state. Not that they had much of a choice: Solid Rocks will be visiting in a few months’ time, expecting to see an elaborate fortification system. Suffice it to say that failure would mean our own officers might be the ones pushed up against the wall, with a bullet to "persuade" them."
 LCT_six_lords_demands.1.a: "...Also Strikes"
 
 #Star Talent raise unity rhetoric demand
 LCT_six_lords_demands.2.t: ""A lazy body kills all will.""
 LCT_six_lords_demands.2.d: "The Lakeish proverb became all the more relevant when Star Talent toured through the army’s recent conquests. While the natives’ tongues say yes, their actions don’t always follow: there’ve been more than a few draft dodgers, a couple of griffons keep escaping the gendarmerie, and a dozen pamphlets have been found uncensored, advocating for funny ideas such as harmonism, communism, and worst of all, pacifism.\n\nIn short, the Lake Army still lies divided. The greatest military minds in the world would just waste their breath if their soldiers haven’t shed their individual destinies, giving up their lives to become the Lakepony’s honoured shield."
 LCT_six_lords_demands.2.a: "Probuditi! Wake from your slumber and help your fellow pony!"
 
 #Star Talent raise productivity rhetoric demand
 LCT_six_lords_demands.3.t: ""Working Hard for a Stronger Lake!""
 LCT_six_lords_demands.3.d: "Westerly had told the other lords straight: factory lines everywhere couldn’t meet the expected quotas of materiel needed from the ever-expanding scope of war. The reasons were numerous; absenteeism, malfunctions, and miscommunication were only the chief ones.\n\nThe responsibility has now fallen to Star Talent to fix things up. While harsher workplace regulations is an option, that can only go so far if the ponies either don’t believe in their work or just don’t know what to believe about it and how it can propel their destiny forward.\n\nBut what Star knows is that a couple motivational posters on the walls won’t be enough to get to the core of the problem."
 LCT_six_lords_demands.3.a: ""Your job produces victory, young lad!""
 
 #Star Talent raise war rhetoric demand
 LCT_six_lords_demands.4.t: "Mission and Vision"
 LCT_six_lords_demands.4.d: "In this new era of Lakeish dominance, it’s unthinkable to hear of ponies ignorant or apathetic to the cause.\n\nBut that’s what Star Talent has gleaned from both personal anecdotes and more detailed reports. Some workers complain that what they ship out doesn’t appear to have any tangible effect on the field, while others whine about the war not being as big of a deal as it’s made out to be—life at home seemed to be going on as peaceful as it’s always been, so where’s the action? Where’s the proof? Still, even a couple of soldiers have voiced nonsensical concerns that any war now or in the future might end up with victory in the wrong hooves... or claws... just because of one unfavorable result here or there.\n\nYet Star keeps a level head. Maybe all they need is a nudge in the right direction, a severe reminder about the griffon threat that sought to wipe out all pony life—and will do so again if we don’t do anything about it."
 LCT_six_lords_demands.4.a: "Pony genocide will not happen here, not on our watch!"
 
 #Flaming Hot diplomacy demand
 LCT_six_lords_demands.5.t: "Under the Spheres of Influence"
 LCT_six_lords_demands.5.d: "Apparently, Flaming Hot has been found in [?LCT_diplomacy_target_var.GetName], already schmoozing with local politicians to gain an audience with [?LCT_diplomacy_target_var.GetLeader].\n\nUnderstandably, the other lords are upset that he will be absent from [Root.GetNameDef] for the time being, but Flaming is highly convinced that buddying up with [?LCT_diplomacy_target_var.GetName] is how we can march forward as a country.\n\nIt’s unclear how this may help with said march—some weapons, an alliance, a promise to not attack us, or just getting a couple new friends to hang out with—but what is clear is that he won’t stop taking regular trips to [?LCT_diplomacy_target_var.GetName] until they’re friends or until the other lords drag him back home."
 LCT_six_lords_demands.5.a: "Diplomacy has truly enriched the world’s... tourism sector?"

 LCT_six_lords_demands.6.d: "Smoke Signal couldn’t take it anymore. Newspaper clippings surrounded her room, the walls plastered with news clippings on top of tackboards. A common theme ran through the headlines and pictures: other countries showing off their tanks.\n\nShe would not settle with buying their armor for fear of becoming slavishly dependent on so-called allies. No, she was going to talk to her fellow lords and persuade them to finally develop and produce tanks that the Lake Army can truly call its own.\n\nAnd it will start with Projekat Probni Tenk Mark 1."

They waited with bated breath as Smoke flipped through the pages which were really photos, sketches, and technical information haphazardly put together with staplers and paper clips.\n\nNot a minute passed before Smoke slammed the folder on her office desk, and later in the day, those lackeys would spread rumors that Smoke was losing it simply because the Lake Army didn’t have "proper tanks." Their pleas for calm fell on her deaf ears.\n\nBut the message was clear: Smoke would have her steel behemoths, the next generation of tanks, and they would be proudly made by the Lakeponies. Or she’ll die trying."
 LCT_six_lords_demands.7.a: "We’ll have divisions full of these steel commanders!"
  
 #Smoke Signal research heavy tank 2
 LCT_six_lords_demands.8.t: "ČS T-14"
 LCT_six_lords_demands.8.d: "Every day, the enemy grew stronger. Entrenchments would spring up, covering for ditches and fortresses where creatures too frightened to brave the combat of the outside world hide until their more valorous friends finish the battle for them.\n\nA tank could mop them up in one fell swoop. Now, how about ten of them? Or a hundred?\n\nSmoke Signal has the schematics as well as the funding from several dubious sources for a bigger, better tank than anything that the Lake Army has ever made. And she wants them in the triple digits."
 LCT_six_lords_demands.8.a: "A gray flood shall fall upon our opposing forces"
  
 #Smoke Signal research super heavy tank 1
 LCT_six_lords_demands.9.t: "A Kingly Saint on the Move"
 LCT_six_lords_demands.9.d: "Smoke Signal is never a mare who took half-measures, so when she presented to the other lords her plans for a truly Lakeish "super heavy tank" based on research from abroad, her equals could at least respect her commitment.\n\nBut there’ve been reasons why even the most advanced nations in the world didn’t dive deep into these mobile monstrosities. The tank’s immense weight especially raised concerns that it would cause itself to collapse, hinder movement to the point of being relegated to a support role and nothing more, and, if for nothing else, destroy the very roads and bridges it was meant to cross.\n\nStill, Smoke was undeterred. According to her, technology would quickly catch up to these martial fantasies. Imagine this: these wonder weapons going in unsupported, walking onto the enemy’s frontlines and mowing thousands down while making quick work of any defensive structure. Explosives would do nothing to these robust plates as they’d trudge without resistance straight to the capital to finally point a dozen cannons at the leader’s head for negotiations.\n\nIt’s up to the rest of the lords to decide on what to do."
 LCT_six_lords_demands.9.a: "It’s crazy enough that it might actually work"
  
 #Smoke Signal research super heavy tank 2
 LCT_six_lords_demands.10.t: "Tip-B"
 LCT_six_lords_demands.10.d: "When the world thought of the "super heavy tank," most nations had the common sense to either send only a dozen out or scrap their projects entirely when both financial and scientific realities came to bear.\n\nFor Smoke Signal, the Lake Army didn’t have common sense. It had rare intuition. And the modern virtue of recycling and gossip, thanks to pulling some strings with Flaming Hot in his so-called "diplomatic visits" with the rest of the Griffonia and beyond.\n\nScattered notes and blueprint scraps had piled up on Smoke’s desk. The next several months if not years would determine whether her patchwork plans for a faster, stronger Kraljevic Svetimac would come to life. Researchers would berate her for pursuing this "madness" further, and the bean counters would lecture her on the wasteful spending it might cost them.\n\nBut a bigger "ka-boom" shall be had. The doomed griffons will get a taste of that, she was sure of it."
 LCT_six_lords_demands.10.a: "We’re gonna need a bigger bang"
 
 #Smoke Signal research super heavy tank 3
 LCT_six_lords_demands.11.t: "Destroyer of Worlds, on Treads"
 LCT_six_lords_demands.11.d: "Approaching if not exceeding a hundred tons. A main gun whose caliber was at least 130mm. Secondary guns that would throw out rockets, grenades, or other explosive ordinances against pesky infantry. An engine that mixed gas and magic so it could move the weight of boulders easily for a thousand miles.\n\nThe neighsayers fell on deaf ears; it didn’t matter if they were her own companions at the lords’ table. All she’d asked for was the heaviest tank that could ever be conceived, a city-wrecker that nogriff could hope to slow down. Artillery would fail against it, mines would not trap it, and those infamous nuclear bombs could only hope to scratch it.\n\nSmoke would lead the way, blast by ear-splitting blast."
 LCT_six_lords_demands.11.a: "The griffons shall cower at a lone tank!"
 
 #Smoke Signal artillery stockpile demand
 LCT_six_lords_demands.12.t: "Truth, Goodness, Artillery"
 LCT_six_lords_demands.12.d: "It’s no secret that Smoke Signal likes a full house, that "house" being the lines of warehouses that much of our equipment call home.\n\nHowever, as of late, her daily morning walks through their echoing halls have given her reason to either trash the room or mope around with teary eyes: they’re empty, deprived of precious artillery. Whether our latest batches have been destroyed or are simply doing their duty in some far-off battlefield doesn’t matter: the warehouses of indirect fire are empty.\n\nSurely, this crime will not go by unpunished. For the glory of the Lake Army, these grand corridors will be filled to the brim once more with cannons that will sing an explosive symphony. It will be music to Smoke’s ears!"

 LCT_six_lords_demands.15.d: ""So... let me get this straight." Star Talent looked down at the papers strewn across the war table. Poorly-planned invasion lines had been scribbled and scrawled across each sheet, clearly the work of Smoke Signal, who was sitting across from her at the table, the stench of alcohol permeating the room (which had only recently been aired out from her last visit).\nShe adjusted her view up to Flaming Hot, seated alongside Smoke Signal. "You want us, in the midst of defending ourselves from all of griffonkind, to declare war on... Asterion? Of all places?"\n\nThe two of them nodded, Flaming more enthusiastically than Smoke. Star continued, "I've heard your reasoning as to why they wouldn't realistically add much of a problem to the equation, and I-I suppose I can agree with it, to an extent, but... why Asterion?"\n\nFlaming Hot adjusted his shirt collar and leaned in over the table with a smug expression,\n"Well, you see, in the interests of our international relations, access to the-"\n\nSuddenly, Smoke Signal's eyes widened and she jumped up in her chair, and yelled aloud in her typical drunken slurred speak,\n"I-I'm not rashist! Jusshht... d-don't like 'em...*hic*" Her yell echoing through the otherwise empty room, a confused official in the room next door started listening in through the wall.\n\nBoth of the other two Lords present looked at her confused. Star questioned, "Uh... Smoke... nobody said you were?"\n\nSmoke Signal gulped loudly and looked down at the table. "Jusht... don't like them. Nothin'-*hic*... no rashism. They're jusht kind of shmelly a-and d-don't you think they're a lil' weird with their... two-... two horns and they're really big and KIND of scar-*hic*... they're weird. I think. Don't... don't like... don't..."\n\nSmoke Signal's eyes closed and she started to fall out of her seat, but before she could crash to the floor like an artillery shell from the sky, Star Talent was able to rush out of her seat and catch her friend. Flaming coughed, "So, uh, well, you get my point. What's one more enemy, eh?"\n\nAfter quickly making sure Smoke Signal was still breathing, Star looked up and took hold of the bottle Smoke was drinking from, examining it."

 # lake festival preparation event, can't host during wartime. Option text is placeholder
 lakecityflavor.1.t: "Lake Festival"
 lakecityflavor.1.d: "Every year, Ponies from across Lake City come together in Jezeragrad for the city's annual Lake Festival. The festival originally dates back to the reign of Blessed Sword who used the occasion as a chance to shore up the unification of the various tribes around Jezeragrad. Throughout the First Lake City Principality, this holiday was celebrated with a week of parades, banquets, tournaments, and ended with a massive boat race around Jezeragrad Harbour. The winner of this race would then become quite the celebrity and be granted a private audience with the reigning monarch.\n\nAfter the fall of the monarchy, the holiday continued to be celebrated annually in much the same way. Though one noticeable difference is that the winner of the boat race would receive an audience with the Grand Mayor, a key to the city of Jezeragrad, and a generous prize of gold and other treasures.\n\nIn the last fifty years however, the festival has been in steady decline as the city of Jezeragrad has been struggling to finance the opulent festivities which once marked the occasion. The week is now a weekend, the banquets reduced in grandeur, the parades are now mostly made up of military formations, and the boat race only attracts a few diehard participants.\n\nIt would greatly increase the morale of our nation if we were to provide this event with proper funding, financing a week of festivities which could rival those of Blessed Sword's reign."
 lakecityflavor.1.a: "Earmark some funding for this year's festivities."
 lakecityflavor.1.b: "Don't we have better things to finance?"
 lakecityflavor.1.c: "A valiant goal but maybe we should wait until after this war is over."
 
 # Lake festival celebration. Option text is placeholder
 lakecityflavor.2.t: "A Week of Grandeur"
 lakecityflavor.2.d: "Two million Ponies entered the city of Jezeragrad this week, coming from all corners of Lake City and the River Coalition, attracted by what promised to be the grandest Lake Festival in a lifetime.\n\nA pier had been constructed on the waterfront, with an Equestrian styled theme park built upon it. The rides, which most foals had only ever heard rumours of, had been imported from Manehattan and Canterlot and were opened for public use. It was reported that the line for the Ferris Wheel got so long that Ponies were spending upwards of four hours in the queues. Yet, not even this dampened the spirits of the families who came to witness this.\n\nEvery night was marked by banquets, with millions of tonnes of grains, fruit, ales, salt, and other food products pouring into the city in preparation. The weekend feasts featured foods from all across the globe, including Griffking rye, Zebrican coffee and chocolate, and peppers from the jungle of southern Equestria.\n\nThe Friday parade lasted six hours and included military units which were showered in flowers and cheers, floats sponsored by Lake City's guilds celebrating their technological innovation and products, and exhibits from all manner of organizations and foreign sponsors. One memorable float was that of New Mareland which had an intricate mural of flowers planted upon it which showed the cooperation between our two nations.\n\nLastly, there was the boat race, held on Saturday evening. Last year, this race included 30 ships. This year registration had to be stopped at 300, until pressure called for a second, and later third race to be created. The winners of each of these races then went into a three-way tiebreaker. Overall, the tournament was won by the Bluenose in a photo finish.\n\nAs Sunday rolled around, the train station, roads, and waters leading out of Jezeragrad were clogged with Ponies attempting to exit the city. The festival had been a success, greatly contributing to national morale and the perception of our republic to outside nations."
 lakecityflavor.2.a: "How will they ever top this?"
 
 # Lake festival cancelation. Option text is placeholder
 lakecityflavor.3.t: "The Last Lake Festival?"
 lakecityflavor.3.d: "Today, the Ponies of Jezeragrad were dismayed to learn that their annual Lake Festival had been cancelled, citing diminishing attendance and increasing costs as the main contributing factors. While private benefactors are scrambling to re-establish a smaller scale event, the hopes of ever seeing a proper revitalization look grim.\n\nYet, the public outcry against this cancellation has been largely muted, as it would seem that few Ponies are really caught up in the mysticism of this once grand tradition."
 lakecityflavor.3.a: "An end of an era."
 
 # reports of lost fishermen, can choose to start a search, or ignore it
 lakecityflavor.4.t: "Lost on the Lake"
 lakecityflavor.4.d: "The Neighin Maru is one of a hundred fishing vessels which prowl the freshwaters off of Jezeragrad in order to find Walleye, Salmon, and Pike for the city's denizens. The ship left port about a week ago and was supposed to return yesterday morning burdened with fish. However, that wasn't the case.\n\nInstead, the vessel has been reported missing with the last known transmission happening three days ago on the southernmost edge of the lake.\n\nWhile it's not uncommon for vessels to go missing, the Neighin Maru was carrying renown Lake City biologist, Case Study. Already, the press within Jezeragrad has picked up this story and have begun to publish it, creating a public outcry to find the ship and its crew.\n\nCaptain Greenpeace of the Lake City Coastguard has asked for our permission to use the organization's fleet to begin prowling the waters in an effort to find the ship. This endeavour would be extremely costly but to do otherwise would likely sentence these fishingponies to their doom."
 lakecityflavor.4.a: "Find Case Study and the Neighin Maru."
 lakecityflavor.4.b: "Prepare a state funeral for Case Study."
 
 # No results from the search
 lakecityflavor.5.t: "The Search Continues"
 lakecityflavor.5.d: "The search of the Neighin Maru, and famed biologist Case Study, continues as vessels of the Lake City Coastguard prowl the lake's waters. An effort had been made to begin the search at the sight of the last known transmission and then move outwards in larger and larger circles.\n\nSo far, this search has failed to find any trace of the ship and the morale for this mission has steadily diminished. The only good news is that while there is no sign of the ship, there is also no sign of wreckage or debris which hopefully means the ship remains in one piece.\n\nThe mission is also running into troubles in terms of funding as the constant running, maintenance, and crewing of coastguard vessels has become a costly endeavour. Hopefully this search ends soon, for better or worse."
 lakecityflavor.5.a: "Continue the search, we must find this ship."
 lakecityflavor.5.b: "This is getting far to costly, we need to end this now."

 # search payoff, lake city ponies are relieved
 lakecityflavor.6.t: "The Neighin Maru is Found"
 lakecityflavor.6.d: "At dawn, a patrol craft of the Lake City Coastguard stumbled upon a small beach atoll located fourteen kilometers north-east of the site of the Neighin Maru's last transmission. Upon circling to the northern shore of the island, the craft discovered the beached remains of the Neighin Maru left in impeccable condition.\n\nSeveral minutes later, a flare was launched from the atoll and the patrol craft landed. The crew of the Neighin Maru, including famed biologist Case Study, were all accounted for upon this island in good health.\n\nApparently, the Neighin Maru had hit a gathering of rocks while returning to port, which punctured the ship's hull and allowed water into the electrical systems. In an effort to save his crew, the captain had headed for the nearest landmass and beached his ship. Since then, the crew had been surviving upon the local vegetation of the island, lake water, and the hold full of salted Pike.\n\nIt is expected that the Neighin Maru's crew will be returned to Jezeragrad in the coming hours."
 lakecityflavor.6.a: "Some desperately needed good news."
  
 # princes birthday prep, everyone likes this and is excited, think of emperor-era japan
 lakecityflavor.13.t: "A Royal Birthday"
 lakecityflavor.13.d: "During the First Principality of Lake City, the birthday of the Grand Prince or Princess was a national holiday that the entire nation celebrated. Across the land parades were planned, patriotic decorations adorned buildings, and the gates of Hoofboka Palace were opened for the public, a rarity considering the private nature of the monarch.\n\nAt noon, the Grand Prince or Princess would then stand upon one of the palace's balconies, with their entire family, and address the public, thanking them for their well wishes and loyalty. This was then followed by a small speech.\n\nWhile Heavenly Snow has requested that his birthday not be celebrated, Wild Tree and his sycophants think to do otherwise. This event could act as a much-needed morale boost for our Ponies as the celebrations would hopefully distract them from the worst of the restoration's growing pains."
 lakecityflavor.13.a: "Heavenly Snow slumps down in his chair, may the 'birthday plans' commence."
 lakecityflavor.13.b: "The time is better spent on more military drafts."
 
 # princes birthday celebration event
 lakecityflavor.14.t: "Happy Birthday, Heavenly Snow!"
 lakecityflavor.14.d: "Across the nation, bells chimed at noon, ringing once for each year of Heavenly Snow's life. Buildings, both private and public, have decked themselves out in bunting embroiled with the royal emblem and colours.\n\nIn Jezeragrad, a parade passed through the city, making sure to detour near the palace. It lasted for well over an hour as military units, troops of performers, floats, and flocks of loving citizens joined together to celebrate the Grand Prince's birthday.\n\nLater in the day, the gates of Hoofboka Palace were opened and crowds numbering in the tens of thousands swarmed through to catch a rare opportunity of the royal grounds and gardens. Then, Sir Wild Tree was seen upon the Grand Prince's balcony.\n\nWild Tree thanked the Grand Prince's subjects for coming out to wish Heavenly Snow a Happy Birthday, and appreciated their loyalty. He then gave a brief speech discussing the bright future ahead for Lake City and his ambitions for a 'utopian' society.\n\nThe Grand Prince was not seen at any point throughout the day."
 lakecityflavor.14.a: "Here's to another year!"
 lakecityflavor.14.b: "Happy birthday to me... sigh."
 lakecityflavor.14.b_tt: "Will hide the subsequent annual birthday events while keeping the bonuses."

 # princes birthday cancallation, if you chose to cancel it. (This ends them permenantly)
 lakecityflavor.15.t: "Happy Birthday, Heavenly Snow?"
 lakecityflavor.15.d: "The Ponies of Lake City were distraught to learn that the Grand Prince would not be resuming the tradition of celebrating his birthday in a grand fashion. However, they respected the wishes of their monarch and will make sure to keep their celebrations private.\n\nHowever, the Prince seemed relieved at not having his birthday turned into a national event. He silently thanked Wild Tree for respecting his wishes, even if it was just this once.\n\nDespite this, he still found some joy in the letters wishing him well, received from his family."
 lakecityflavor.15.a: "His day felt just a little bit brighter."

Wild Tree appeared on national radio and announced the formation of a new military government to promote national harmony and renew.\n\nHowever, the Mayor himself was able to escape and with the help of loyal members of the military the situation was eventually defused and the troops returned to their barracks by dawn of the next day.

 #### DECISIONS ####
 LCT_improve_industry: "Improve Industry"
 LCT_develop_civ_industry: "Grant Land to the Guilds"
 LCT_develop_civ_industry_desc: "A number of Lake City's guilds have expressed interest in purchasing tracts of publicly held lands. By consenting to this request, we'd see a boon to economic growth as fallow lands are converted into farms, mines, and various other enterprises."
 LCT_develop_mil_industry: "Buy Weapons from the Guilds"
 LCT_develop_mil_industry_desc: "Most of Lake City's military equipment is produced by private firms who are awarded government contracts. An expansion of these contracts would greatly increase the quantity of armaments at our disposal."
 LCT_farming_modernisation: "Farming Modernization"
 LCT_farming_modernisation_desc: "Like most of Eastern Griffona, Lake City's agricultural sector is severally out of date. By bringing in modern machinery, chemicals, and land use practices we would not only increase the quantity and quality of good, but all free up massive amounts of labour for industrializations."
 LCT_road_works: "National Road Network"
 LCT_road_works_desc: "Outside of Jezeragrad, Lake City's transportation network is incredibly archaic, leading to the flow of goods being needlessly slow and risky. By investing into upgrading our road networks we could ensure that economic activity progresses unhindered."
 LCT_damm_the_river: "Dam the Griffking"
 LCT_damm_the_river_desc: "The construction of a hydroelectric dam upon the Griffking is no easy feat. However, if we were successful in constructing this project we'd greatly increase the quality of life within our nation as electricity is produced, irrigation becomes more manageable, and previously untapped resources become available."
 LCT_build_steekworks: "Svetigrad Steelworks"
 LCT_build_steekworks_desc: "The province of Svetazemlja is rich in iron but poor in coal. This means that the rich reserves have previously gone untouched as the heat needed to purify the iron has been absent. However, the completion of the Griffking Damn has allowed us to use its electricity to heat our newly constructed blast furnances."
 LCT_build_aluminium_plant: "Svetigrad Aluminium Plant"
 LCT_build_aluminium_plant_desc: "The construction of the Griffking Dam has both reduced the flow of the Griffking River and helped better manage its seasonal extremes. This means that previously unfeasible economic projects, on the banks of the river, have become a reality. One such project is an aluminum mine and corresponding smelter in the province's capital."
 LCT_expand_aluminium_plant: "Expand the Svetigrad Aluminium Plant"
 LCT_expand_aluminium_plant_desc: "The success of the Svetigrad Aluminum Plant has invigorated private investment into aluminum mines and smelters throughout the provinces of Svetazemlja. However, to truly capitalize on this boom we should invest a significant amount of public capital into subsidies and tax breaks."
 LCT_invest_in_neuculer_power: "Invest in Nuclear Power"
 LCT_invest_in_neuculer_power_desc: "The splitting of the atom has opened up a world of possibilities for us. One such opportunity has been the construction of a power generation facility which will be fueled by the controlled fission of uranium-235. This would offer us a secure and clean source of energy without relying upon foreign imports of coal and oil."
 
 LCT_improve_science_1: "Expand the University of Jezeragrad"
 LCT_improve_science_1_desc: "The University of Jezeragrad has been the premier location for Lake City students looking for an education in law, theology, and philosophy. However, it's been hindered by relatively weak science and engineering programs. By investing into upgrading this facility we'd not only gain valuable research space but also stem the tide of brain drain leaving our nation."
 LCT_improve_science_2: "Invest in our Scientists"
 LCT_improve_science_2_dessc: "The heavy emphasis on military spending has resulted in little funding being directed towards civilian research and development, hindering our ability to innovate. The investment of a small portion of our annual budget into the development of labratories and financing of grans would greatly assist in remedying this problem."
 
 LCT_broj_jedan: "Broj Jedan"
 LCT_war_efforts: "War Efforts"
 LCT_broj_jedan_desc: "The end of the war is in sight. With a final push and determined effort we can bring the conflict to a swift conclusion.

 LCT_army_issue_category: "Tackle Military Problem"
 LCT_army_issue_category_desc: "For too long the Military has been meddling in Lake City's politics. This most recent coup is just another example that they have grown out of control. If we are to secure our democracy, we must take steps to secure the government from any further actions they might take."
 LCT_expand_the_sop: "Secure the UDBA"
 LCT_expand_the_sop_desc: "The Uprava Državne Sigurnosti is the civilian special police force charged with investigation into and control of political groups and ideologies deemed a threat to public order.

 LCT_bribe_the_nobles_decision: "Bribe the Nobles"
 LCT_bribe_the_nobles_decision_desc: "The noble families have many strong ties to the military. Securing their loyalty will help us keep an ear inside military circles."
 LCT_bribe_the_guilds: "Bribe the Guilds"
 LCT_bribe_the_guilds_desc: "The guilds have long seen the military as a threat to their existence, with many factions calling for nationalisation of industries. It wouldn't take much to ensure that stay on our side."

 LCT_UMJ_Leader_Deirdra_Skye_Full: "§6Deirdra Skye§!\nLeader of the §6Udruzenje za Moderni Jezerograd§!\n--------------\n§LThe daughter of Pònaidh immigrants, Deirdre Skye was an unexpected name in the realm of Lakeish politics by the late 980s. Her founding of Lake City's first harmonic party would go unnoticed after some initial backlash, but like a sapling spreading its roots, Deirdre's organisation grew. By millennium's end, her party had become Harmony's nexus in Jezeragrad, with an emphasis on interaction with the spirits or what Lakeponies call the Ponikami. That, combined with her foreign background and lack of military ambitions, gave her a solid mass of followers—boot camp failures, Longswordian Genocide survivors, and faithful believers. Her harmonic affiliation then secured a base of similar-thinking intellectuals, and the rest was history.\n\nOr so it should've been. In the winter of 1005-06, Skye took a trip to her homeland and made the unfortunate discovery that the supposedly peaceful monks of Anam-Teine were fiercely trained warriors. Word of her disgust spread like wildfire, and her opponents took her notable silence on Lake City's military to the forefront. Accusations of rabid pacifism, of abandoning the Soldier's Path of the spirits, and of being paid to shut up about martial injustices sent Skye off the political cliff. Her newly acquired reclusiveness only escalated matters, leaving her representatives as the de facto faces of the party.\n\nWhile Lake City's harmonic party still sails strong, its captain now finds herself superseded and ignored. It's not if Skye, in her fall from grace, finally hits the ground: it's when.§!"

 LCT_UMJ_Leader_Wavebreaker_Full: "§6Wavebreaker§!\nLeader of the §6Udruzenje za Moderni Jezerograd§!\n--------------\n§LWhile Wavebreaker's lineage can be traced back to one of Blessed Sword's loyal warlords, his fisherpony upbringing hid his passion for valour in battle. That secret soon spilled out into the open once news of the Longswordian Genocide made the rounds; he then swore to his parents that he would help save all of Vartai. They didn't stop him from volunteering, and fortunately, his entry coincided with a new development in the battlefield: aerial warfare.\n\nWavebreaker signed up for the program immediately. Over the rest of the 990s into the new millennium, while the lack of war, for most days, kept him in patrol duty, the experience freed him up to the sky's wonders while handling griffon raiders head-on, glad to safeguard the airspace of his fellow Lakeponies.\n\nBut youthful pride soon faded. Rumours of corruption among his superiors multiplied, that the successors of the River Empire's honour-bound warriors were spoiled stallion-children unworthy of their ranks. Thus, some say that his career-ending crash wasn't what started his fervent rise in harmonic politics—it was simply the last straw.\n\nWith a nakedly populist platform propelling him to the reins of the Udruzenje za Moderni Jezerograd, the political rookie has his work cut out for him. One thing is for sure: for the first time, Lakeish Harmony will be on the offensive.§!"

 LCT_TJS_Leader_Springtime_Frost: "Springtime Frost"
 LCT_TJS_Leader_Springtime_Frost_Full: "§1Springtime Frost§!\nLeader of the §1Demokratski Jezerski Savez§!\n--------------\n§LSpringtime Frost was destined to balance the nation by virtue of not rocking the boat. He was spoken well of in class and in his later career of Demokratski politicking thanks to agreeing to almost everyone's points of view while rarely voicing out his own. To his credit, he took joy in being a silent workhorse while everypony else spewed their bluster out.\n\nBut in 1004, the socially liberal Dew Point, the previous leader of the Demokratski as well as Grand Mayor of Lake City, died in a car explosion. Springtime publicly questioned the circumstances of Dew's death, but under-the-table deals and threats of "going out the same way" had him bow his head, join the party's snap elections, and sit on top of both party and country. Still, even as Springtime pushed for small-step reforms, he couldn't stop the Cehovi and military high command from snooping in on him with guns and money, politely asking for his support or else. Thus, the status quo has been maintained.\n\nAs the last leg of his party leadership—and his Lakeish presidency—runs its course, one thing Springtime kept close to heart is a genuine concern for his loved ones and his own life. The military had been merciful to let him not run for re-election and to keep all cars from exploding in his vicinity. All he has to do is to placate the shady muzzles while passing just enough reforms to legitimise democracy, and he can fade into the obscurity of a much safer career, like gardening.§!"
 
 LCT_TJS_Leader_Dirty_Deeds: "Dirty Deeds"
 LCT_TJS_Leader_Dirty_Deeds_Full: "§1Dirty Deeds§!\nLeader of the §1Demokratski Jezerski Savez§!\n--------------\n§LA self-made businesspony who departed from his ancestors' tradition of making brandy, Deeds studied abroad, where he learned economic schools of thoughts and how the state could benefit from the rise of mass industrialisation. Eager to make his mark on Lake City when he returned, his first course of action was to establish a construction company, accepting contracts from the military to upgrade their bases as well as Riverland businesses looking to expand into Jezeragrad.\n\nBut that's what his spokesponies would tell you; workers and Harmonites will claim it's not the whole story. As the newest face of money among the Cehovi, he's had to keep an iron grip on his position and his constant profits. Tales are told outside of his presence, of factory supervisors forcing workers to sleep beside assembly lines—or worse, to not sleep at all for dozens of hours—and of Deeds himself dividing construction workers into gangs where the best performers would get nice beds and warm food while the rest would be kicked out with only minimum wages.\n\nBut Deeds lets the neighsayers bray. He only cares about what the Cehovi and the army will say: they are his backers, after all, and they're asking for greater investments among the griffon demographic. Griffon workers in his factories, griffon enemies to justify defence spending... in a continent full of them, there's much money to be made.§!"

 LCT_PD_Leader_Wild_Tree: "§0Wild Tree§!"
 LCT_PD_Leader_Wild_Tree_Full: "§0Wild Tree§!\nLeader of the §0Preko Drvoreda§!\n--------------\n§LAt first, General-Major Wild Tree's life is the typical rags-to-riches story. Born to a struggling logging family, a school-age Tree promised them that he would dispel their woes by serving in the Lake Army. Tree took the time to borrow hordes of books on the army's history to prepare, which evolved into selling some of his belongings to purchase copies of military philosophy from across the world.\n\nWhen he entered the academy, he knew the ins and outs of grand strategy, only to be stopped by envious old-timers who didn't want an upstart to replace them, but while backroom politics delayed his graduation by two years, graduate he did. More than a decade on, he's been called "the scholar with a gun" for his insistence on gleaning wisdom from ancient battles and history lessons, which has led him to found the Demokratski's right-wing: the Preko Drvoreda, banking on a platform of greater military privileges.\n\nYet, unbeknownst to all but his inner circle, his time with history books was only a front. Hushed inquiries led to archived documents, and their contents fomented a twisted love for the long-dead River Empire. To him, Lake City was a husk of the Lakeish spirit, anemic against against any griffon assault. Benchwarmers occupied the seats of power, making a mockery of the Soldiers' Path and the emperor's divine will.\n\nSo if the imperial restoration means setting a torch to democracy one day, so be it.§!"

 LCT_Independents: "§YThe Independents§!\n--------------\n§LA defining feature of any parliament is the amount of perspectives it could welcome from the public. While massive coalitions are the Skupština's movers and shakers, a number of smaller parties and independents also wield considerable power, enough to make their voices heard in the democracy's hallowed chambers.\n\nThey thus represent the widest range of policies and beliefs: big party-aligners who don't want to be held back by certain policy disagreements, single-issue speakers who believe that no one is focusing on what truly pains the populace, and other politicians whose advocacies simply don't fall into neat labels and categories.§!"

 LCT_Bill_National_Advancement: "The Bill of Labour Democratisation"
 LCT_Bill_National_Advancement_desc: "In a rare display of inter-party unity, led by moderate Demokratski representative Prouette Carpet, the Bill of Labour Democratisation has been put to the vote. While the depths of the individual reforms found here barely touch the label of "radical" (for example, the bill does not stipulate trust-busting), the sheer breadth of these reforms—which includes but are not limited to: monopoly control, combine decentralisation, red tape reduction, and government encouragement of trade unions and collective bargaining agreements—will be enough to open the economy up both to innovative faces from within and foreign investors from without.\n\nArguments against the bill rest on the positives of tradition (Lake City and, to an extent, the River Empire has grown economically without such economic democratisation) and of centralisation (massive guilds having much leeway in their operations leaves them agile to adapt to the market's ever-changing conditions). Its detractors also state that more democratic (even Harmonist) capitalist ideas inspired by Equestrian analogues do not necessarily apply to a state which has not had an immortal alicorn in the reins for over a thousand years to guide them.\n\nCounter-arguments to the above build their foundation on how the Cehovi themselves must adapt to the ever-changing conditions outside of Lake City, as well as moving on from a feudal-esque economic system that has been a hold-over from the days of the River Empire and the Grand Principality to something more befitting more industrial times."

 ###Leader Descriptions
 POLITICS_SPRINGTIME_FROST_DESC: "Springtime Frost was destined to balance the nation by virtue of not rocking the boat. He was spoken well of in class and in his later career of Demokratski politicking thanks to agreeing to almost everyone's points of view while rarely voicing out his own. To his credit, he took joy in being a silent workhorse while everypony else spewed their bluster out.\n\nBut in 1004, the socially liberal Dew Point, the previous leader of the Demokratski as well as Grand Mayor of Lake City, died in a car explosion. Springtime publicly questioned the circumstances of Dew's death, but under-the-table deals and threats of "going out the same way" had him bow his head, join the party's snap elections, and sit on top of both party and country. Still, even as Springtime pushed for small-step reforms, he couldn't stop the Cehovi and military high command from snooping in on him with guns and money, politely asking for his support or else. Thus, the status quo has been maintained.\n\nAs the last leg of his party leadership—and his Lakeish presidency—runs its course, one thing Springtime kept close to heart is a genuine concern for his loved ones and his own life. The military had been merciful to let him not run for re-election and to keep all cars from exploding in his vicinity. All he has to do is to placate the shady muzzles while passing just enough reforms to legitimise democracy, and he can fade into the obscurity of a much safer career, like gardening."
 POLITICS_WAVEBREAKER_DESC: "While Wavebreaker's lineage can be traced back to one of Blessed Sword's loyal warlords, his fisherpony upbringing hid his passion for valour in battle. That secret soon spilled out into the open once news of the Longswordian Genocide made the rounds; he then swore to his parents that he would help save all of Vartai. They didn't stop him from volunteering, and fortunately, his entry coincided with a new development in the battlefield: aerial warfare.\n\nWavebreaker signed up for the program immediately. Over the rest of the 990s into the new millennium, while the lack of war, for most days, kept him in patrol duty, the experience freed him up to the sky's wonders while handling griffon raiders head-on, glad to safeguard the airspace of his fellow Lakeponies.\n\nBut youthful pride soon faded. Rumours of corruption among his superiors multiplied, that the successors of the River Empire's honour-bound warriors were spoiled stallion-children unworthy of their ranks. Thus, some say that his career-ending crash wasn't what started his fervent rise in harmonic politics—it was simply the last straw.\n\nWith a nakedly populist platform propelling him to the reins of the Udruzenje za Moderni Jezerograd, the political rookie has his work cut out for him. One thing is for sure: for the first time, Lakeish Harmony will be on the offensive."
 POLITICS_DIRTY_DEEDS_DESC: "A self-made businesspony who departed from his ancestors' tradition of making brandy, Deeds studied abroad, where he learned economic schools of thoughts and how the state could benefit from the rise of mass industrialisation. Eager to make his mark on Lake City when he returned, his first course of action was to establish a construction company, accepting contracts from the military to upgrade their bases as well as Riverland businesses looking to expand into Jezeragrad.\n\nBut that's what his spokesponies would tell you; workers and Harmonites will claim it's not the whole story. As the newest face of money among the Cehovi, he's had to keep an iron grip on his position and his constant profits. Tales are told outside of his presence, of factory supervisors forcing workers to sleep beside assembly lines—or worse, to not sleep at all for dozens of hours—and of Deeds himself dividing construction workers into gangs where the best performers would get nice beds and warm food while the rest would be kicked out with only minimum wages.\n\nBut Deeds lets the neighsayers bray. He only cares about what the Cehovi and the army will say: they are his backers, after all, and they're asking for greater investments among the griffon demographic. Griffon workers in his factories, griffon enemies to justify defence spending... in a continent full of them, there's much money to be made."
 POLITICS_PRINCE_SNOW_DESC: "Heavenly Snow used to be a modest stallion. While he was born to a magistrate and therefore technically of noble blood, he lived far from the center of political scheming, growing up in Coltljevo. After graduating from a respectable college, he spent his days helping govern the city, later on using his savings to fund his own little cafe in Coltljevo proper. On some days, especially holidays, he himself would work as a barista: a magistrate's son serving coffee projected one-of-a-kind humility.\n\nBut the princely coup struck his old life dead. He was to ascend to the Ramonda Throne in Jezeragrad, being the heir apparent from Grand Prince Blessed Sword's line. They had centuries of tradition to learn from; Snow would know and do everything in no time. In quick succession, every eye turned to him for guidance. Great titles and lands were provided to his family, the zealous army swore their allegiance to him, and its own company of tutors and teachers showed up to instruct him in the ways of Blessed Sword, announcing to the world that the River Empire had returned.\n\nBut for all that, the Grand Prince hardly reigns over his own life. Wild Tree and his underlings push on Snow ambitions that he wishes he can outright refuse, ungratifiable desires that he hopes he can burn to nothing. But he can do nothing. Any protest of his is never made public, for any hideous success the armies earn shall be his in the eyes of every adoring Lakepony...\n\n...and any catastrophic failure shall be his, his alone."
 POLITICS_SIX_LORDS_DESC: "Until recently, only hushed whispers carried by the unspoken threat of dishonourable discharge or worse revealed to a scarce few the existence of the army's puppetmasters, the "Šest Vojvodi." The Six Lords.\n\nHow these six collaborated with each other is more disordered theories than a clear-cut story. The only thing that can be agreed upon is that five of them had already been on mutually good terms for a long time, but long after Westerly Leeward began pursuing politics, the Lords asked him to represent their interests in the civilian sector, and he accepted.\n\nHowever, the Lords have now thrust themselves and the entire Jezeragrad military into the chains of political command. While outside observers during the coup expected that the new leadership would base their legitimacy on restoring the River Empire, this has not been the case.\n\nInstead, they've set their sights on the west, declaring that their mission is "to exterminate the griffon threat for Lake City and ponykind, nothing else.""
 POLITICS_STARDUST_DELIGHT_DESC: "Rijekograd-born, Stardust moved to Lake City after college, stirred by the Harmonic ideals of her political science course to help the less fortunate. She faced backlash from local farmers for being a city-bound foreigner who only had "book smarts", but she made up for it by helping form microfinance initiatives to uphold farmers' self-sufficiency, paving the way for them to form their own small businesses.\n\nBut seeing how griffons were treated in Lake City stoked a greater fire within her. They were refugees who couldn't afford to be in more liberal countries, suffering Lakeish beliefs on foreigners as demonic outlanders and on the Herzland sin of extinguishing the blessed Grand Principality. No wonder the Udruzenje za Moderni Jezerograd, Lake City's Harmonist party, found her housing two whole families of griffons in her already cramped home, giving them love and care while they scrounged up the funds to pack their bags to elsewhere.\n\nIt is thus a painful irony that she has come to power through violence, though not of her own doing. She happened to be the head of what was left of the Harmonist party in the wake of the previous administration, and many griffon rebels flocked to her side. She welcomed them, though only if they promised to kill if all other avenues of diplomacy have failed.\n\nAs Lake City was Griffonia's crossroads of ponies and griffons for centuries, it is only fitting that Stardust would oversee the fate of the two species. While ending generations of hatred is no easy feat, under Stardust's hopeful rule, maybe Lakeponies—and all of Griffonia—will finally join appendages and sing in harmony one day."

 ##Generals' Descriptions
 GENERAL_LCT_westerly_leeward_DESC: "Westerly spent his formative years in a village straddling close to Longsword. His single mother, a Ponikami oracle, relayed to him stories of his missing—then dead—father who'd been captured by griffon bandits. This, combined with the Lakeish pride found in serving the country, spurred Westerly to join to exact revenge against any griffon he would encounter.\n\nBut times would prove peaceful. His service consisted only of capturing griffon deserters and shooting at smugglers. Still, he proved effective at his post, gaining him several promotions... and shady deals that would lay the foundations of today's Six Lords.\n\nBut the Longswordian Genocide was a paradigm shift. A border skirmish with the radical Reformisten and a crisis of faith had him pull many strings to leave the army honourably. He took his experience to the political sphere, and while most of his parties were short-lived, a common message broke through: to give Lake City renewed purpose through a truly national army.\n\nNow the Six Lords' ambassador, he's the Lakeponies' face of unity, advocating for a decisive end to the griffon threat. Still, when he can, he visits his hometown, philosophizing upon the sacred soldier's path. And wondering if his deceased mother had become a Ponikami herself."
 GENERAL_LCT_star_talent_DESC: "Even before the coup, the social circles that knew of Star nicknamed her "The Lake's Lily of the Valley." Given the flower's Lakeish connotations of revived joys, the reason why becomes clear.\n\nDespite her agricultural ancestry, Star soon fell in love with the martial traditions of Jezeragrad. Growing food for the brave soldiers wasn't enough; she wanted to be a general, lapping up all the praise and honor for a successful operation. After convincing her parents to send her to a prestigious military academy, she graduated with flying colours due to her growing network of connections founded by her amiable personality.\n\nIt is unclear how she was roped into what would become the Six Lords. If third- and fourth-hoof reports are to be believed, she'd been kept around or made herself useful by enforcing an optimistic outlook among the likes of lieutenants and colonels through both threats and surprisingly well thought-out letters of encouragement. With the recent advent of radio, she'd even expressed starting a radio show just so she could maintain rapport with the common Lakepony.\n\nFor all that, however, her membership among the Six Lords has cast suspicion upon her positivity, that it's all a facade so everyone can do her bidding, no questions asked. If true, it lends her nickname an appropriate ambiguity: the lily of the valley is also a poisonous plant."
 GENERAL_LCT_solid_rocks_DESC: ""The best offense is a good defense." Fortunate are those who do not try correcting Solid on the real maxim.\n\nBut that disconnect only houses more enigmas in the burly Earth pony: His muscular physique and a reputation as an unruly high school record wouldn't have placed him today as a stoic stallion; passing participation in underground fighting rings shouldn't have shaped him up to value strategic defense above all else. Yet, that is his philosophy, and his cautious approach saved hundreds of lives  from ill-thought-out attacks of their own doing.\n\nIt could be said, though, that the disconnect still makes sense. The rare times the general raises his voice are when corpses pile up against his indefatigable strongholds, a fitting punishment for whoever dared set hoof, claw, or paw into Lake City."
 GENERAL_LCT_daring_dream_DESC: "Depending on who you ask, Daring Dream is either a magical genius who didn't need to finish her studies or an insane gloryhound who should've been barred from high command.\n\nEither impression fits her puzzling rise to power. No one is sure where or who she came from or if she's Lakeish to begin with. All that is known is that a teenage Dream showed up decades ago to answer a recruitment drive, and her affinity for both magic and strategy gained her notoriety among her peers.\n\nNowadays, she sometimes shouts "Charge!" to re-enact the glorious offensives of Blessed Sword himself, powering up a spell to blast her foes with... before realizing her error and getting her troops to retreat and actually strategise. But her gaffes are outweighed by her fervent military foresight, and the lucky few who have Daring in their pockets will have even the worst plans play right into her skillful hooves."
 GENERAL_LCT_smoke_signal_DESC: "Her eternally disheveled appearance and constant state of drunkenness runs counter to the soldier's virtue of self-control, but she's the exception rather than the rule, for her inebriated war tactics, with her penchant for the biggest guns the army can offer, result in bigger gains than when she's sober. Which is almost never.\n\nSaid penchant for guns has ended up her singular drive in life. Hoarding a personal collection of small arms this side of Griffonia,  she also has personal artillery, though inquiries as to where she's gotten some of these howitzers have encountered dead ends. What is more mysterious, though, is her retinue of researchers and runners who answer only to her, scouring the continent for scraps of other nations' tossed-out secret weapon prototypes for her—and Lake City's—benefit.\n\nDuring active conflict, Smoke can be seen living at an FOB, close to where she can drink, sleep, and battleplan to the beat of the artillery's drum."
 GENERAL_LCT_flaming_hot_DESC: "Graduated among the top ten in Lake City Army College, the smug pegasus is quite the wannabe charmer. He professes himself the smartest of his clique, and is more than willing to show neighsayers a record of his accomplishments on the field as a leader, though the whole truth—which he himself doesn't know—involved his father bribing the College to give him honors for the sake of an already established bloodline of majors and generals. The consequences show in Flaming's average-at-best performance, able to organise his soldiers to pursue an objective but not with enough tactical depth to do it efficiently.\n\nThose same consequences also show in his wanton mischief off the battlefield, wooing mares with middling success as well as a season of moonlighting as a substitute for the local hoofball team (which also involved bribery to keep him safe from being discharged for being AWOL).\n\nBut truth be told, he is a competent enough officer, and his associates have channeled his crass tendencies towards beneficial ends, like interesting him in the art of diplomacy. At the very least, coaxing leaders who rule entire countries is a step up from the Jezeragrad dating scene."
 GENERAL_LCT_big_money_DESC: "The son of businesspony and career politician Dirty Deeds, Big Money can say that he's had the honour of serving in the Lake City army, even if he won't tell you that he was forced to volunteer by his father. Fortunately, he did get over it, and the prospect of protecting the country grew on him, if only because it meant, one day, he'd boss ponies around as a commander. While that dream would later be granted to him, it remains to be seen if he will ever outgrow the insults spoken behind his back of being the unqualified spawn of nepotism.\n\nOn the side, he visits his company's factories, having adopted the tried-and-tested managerial strategy of shouting at soot-faced labourers until they produce bigger numbers."

 LCT_melee_equipment_0_desc: "While Riverponies had done battle with ancient weaponry such as spears and shields for centuries before the advent of gunpowder, the ponies of Lake City have garnered a peculiar respect, if not outright worship, of the sword. The Grand Prince Blessed Sword himself was said to have desired a perfection of the art of the sword, commissioning his best duelists to collate principles on not just swordfighting itself but on how to draw the sword from one's scabbard, how to care for one's sword in times of peace, and how to provide offerings to the spirits by the sword alone.\n\nWhile spears, shields, and other such weapons of simpler times have been traded for guns and cannons, the sword remains in notable use, though as a martial art. It is not uncommon to see, on some misty morning, a training ground dotted with a dozen apprentices trading metal blows with their masters, in the pursuit of physical and spiritual purity."
 LCT_melee_equipment_1_desc: "As the Griffonian Empire solidified its holdings with gunpowder, the Riverponies kept the feathered invaders at bay with the very arquebuses and muskets they've used through the short-sightedness of many griffon traders.\n\nIn the Grand Principality of Lake City, however, buying such novel mini-cannons was off the table at first, thanks mostly to a nationwide reverence for swordfighting and its virtues, fostered by Grand Prince Blessed Sword himself. The pride of tradition, however, had no answer to the sacking of Jezeragrad in 752: contemporary accounts of the tragedy relayed the horror of the city's brave warriors falling in droves before a single blade could dent griffon armour.\n\nOnly then did Lakeponies take up the arquebus like the rest of the Riverlands, a weapon faithful to the defense of the Riverponies for two hundred years until the modern-day rifle has forced it into retirement."

 LCT_sunrise_desc: "§YBorn§!: 20th of May, 970 in Equestria\n\n§YBiography§!:Born in a scenic oceanside village in the Sunny Shore, Sunrise's childhood was, on the surface, not unlike most Equestrian foals; However, Sunrise grew up in a household marred by alcoholism and abuse. After a particularly bad altercation which resulted in a kitchen knife being slashed over her eye, a 13 year old Sunrise ran away from home, stowing away on a merchant ship bound for Rottendedam.\n\nIn another turn of events, the merchant vessel was captured and sacked by Hauklander Pirates, taking Sunrise with them. After three years with the pirates, and another year on a Feathisian ship as a "expert guide to the crossroads pirates", Sunrise finally made it to Griffonia. Following a stint as a small-time criminal in Rottendedam, she became a mercenary under a griffon named Marcus Grimfeathers, and began travelling the continent as a soldier of fortune.\n\nShooting her way through the ranks (both literally and figuratively), Sunrise eventually found herself as Grimfeathers' right-hoof mare. Eventually the mercs found themselves in the employ of Count Caelan of Blackhollow in his war against Griffonstone, and Grimfeathers was met with an untimely demise, leaving Sunrise in command of the entire company. By 1001, she was hired by Lake City in an effort to maintain discipline within the Lakeish troops.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Scroup"

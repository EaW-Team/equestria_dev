 #### IDEAS ####
 LCT_defenders_of_the_east:0 "Defenders of the East"
 LCT_defenders_of_the_east_desc:0 "Lake City has always been the first point of contact between the Ponies and Griffons of Eastern Griffonia, leading to the lands being the frequent victim of Griffon raids. This long history of brutalization has instilled our Ponies with a sense of pride in holding back the hordes of Griffonkind."
 LCT_guilds:0 "Cehovi"
 LCT_guilds_desc:0 "The Merchant families of Lake City own several powerful guilds. These Guilds have a near monopoly on their specialities and can pull strings within the government and military, whilst also keeping the economy tightly under control."
 LCT_guilds_subjugated:0 "Guilds Subjugated"
 LCT_guilds_subjugated_desc:0 "The treason of 752 has been repaid with the once mighty guilds now shattered and forced to bend their knee in the face of Grand Prince Heavenly Snow. Their disservice to Lake City has officially come to an end."
 LCT_rising_militarism:0 "Rising Militarism"
 LCT_rising_militarism_desc:0 "The Lake City Army is relatively new, but has proven itself repeatedly against Griffon raiders. Over the last few decades, its influence among citizens and the government has grown, leading to the military having considerable influence over society. LCA troops are now present in every aspect of civilian life, with their proud grey uniforms dress in flowers from passing supporters. Ponies cheer and wave military flags as these brave mares and stallions pass. They are seen as the defenders of freedom, even if they plot the occasional assassination of elected officals."
 LCT_guilds_militarised:0 "Guilds Nationalized"
 LCT_guilds_militarised_desc:0 "The treasonous guilds of Lake City have been broke, with their toxic monopolies and charters assumed by the state. Their economic assets will now benefit the Ponies and military of Lake City, assuring that they are finally put to good use."
 LCT_guilds_empowerd:0 "Guilds Empowered"
 LCT_guilds_empowerd_desc:0 "The recent election of the SDP has seen Lake City's guilds empowered with additional resource charters and new pro-business legislation. This has allowed the power and influence of the guilds to grow to never before seen levels."
 LCT_guilds_supported:0 "Guilds Supported"
 LCT_guilds_supported_desc:0 "The current CDP government has taken on an unusually pro-business platform, greatly expanding the influence and economic power of Lake City's guilds. Critics have called these policies bribery aimed at stealing away the guild's support for the SDP."
 LCT_prince_snow_idea:0 "Prince Heavenly Snow"
 LCT_prince_snow_idea_desc:0 "Heavenly Snow has proven unwilling to seize the instruments of governane claiming that his life as an artesian has poorly prepared him for running the affairs of an entire nation. Instead, the military will continue to operate Lake City with the Grand Prince acting as a mere figurehead."
 LCT_prince_snow_idea2_desc:0 "Heavenly Snow has continued to live his former modest lifestyle, greatly increasing his popularity among the working class. This has done wonders in bridging the gap between our new regime and the general populace."
 LCT_military_in_power:0 "Military in Power"
 LCT_military_in_power_desc:0 "The recent overthrow of the SDP-CDP coalition has created a power vacuum within the governance of Lake City.

 LCT_military_in_power1_desc:0 "Recent reforms by Grand Prince Heavenly Snow have seen a number of disloyal military commanders forced into retirement.

 LCT_military_in_power2_desc:0 "Grand Prince Heavenly Snow has finally seized the reigns of the miltary away from its generals, assuring the loyalty of his troops to him and him alone. No longer will the military hold sway over the affairs of governance, but rather they will bow to his will."
 LCT_military_in_power3_desc:0 "The old guard of the Lake City army have shown great resistance to our administration, fighting Westerly tooth and nail in his drive towards reforms. By removing these individuals from the hig command, and promoting loyal officers, we can begin to lessen the military's pressure upon our regime."
 LCT_military_in_power4_desc:0 "A new generation of cadets are being educated at Jezeragrad's Military Academy, on a pro-Vanguard curriculum. As these officers join our rans, we will see a greater integration of the Vanguard's philosophy into the military high command."
 LCT_military_in_power5_desc:0 "The Vanguards and army are now a single organization, unified in their goal for a better Lake City. No longer will our generals hold us back from this dream as ever soldier and officer has now pledged their allegience to Westerly Leeward and his vision."
 LCT_military_in_placated:0 "Military Placated"
 LCT_military_in_placated_desc:0 "The recent inclusion of military representatives into the Lake City council has lessened the volatile nature of Lake City's army in political affairs."
 LCT_princely_restoration_idea:0 "The Princely Restoration"
 LCT_princely_restoration_idea_desc:0 "The recent return of Grand Prince Heavenly Snow has rocked the bureaucracy of Lake City, with many public servants being expelled or imprisoned for their loyalty towards the SDP, CDP, and Republican Vanguards. This move has resulted in the government of Lake City being plagued with chronic staffing shortages and an inability to provide services. A problem which has only been exacerbated by the direct interference of the inexperienced Heavenly Snow in government affairs."
 LCT_youth_army_idea:0 "Royal Guard"
 LCT_youth_army_idea_desc:0 "Many ponies dream of joining the Royal Guard and having their names enshrined within its history. While few will ever achieve this dream, it will not stop many from joining the military in hopes of climbing through the ranks and being accepted into this prestigious fighting force."
 LCT_anti_griff_research_idea:0 "Anti-Griffon Research"
 LCT_anti_griff_research_idea_desc:0 "The creation of a special branch of military research, focused on undermining the tactical advantages of our Griffon neighbours, will allow us to rapidly develop and deploy anti-Griffon countermeasures."
 LCT_anti_griffon_propaganda_idea:0 "Anti-Griffon Propaganda"
 LCT_anti_griffon_propaganda_idea_desc:0 "Since our nation's inception Griffonkind has stood as our chief antagonist, raiding and pillaging our lands with no restraint. With the instability of our new government finally dealt with, it's time to remind our Ponies of who the real enemy is."
 LCT_prince_cult:0 "Cult of the Prince"
 LCT_prince_cult_desc:0 "The Grand Princes and Princesses of old used to hold a position of new godhood within Lake City society. While this tradition is long dead, our administration is attempting to revive these customs and apply them to the reign of Grand Prince Heavenly Snow."
 LCT_workers_movement_idea:0 "The Workers' Movement"
 LCT_workers_movement_idea_desc:0 "The Workers' Movement is a grassroots program which sees Ponies of exceptional loyalty work harder, longer, and without complaint in order to supply Lake City with the resources it'll need if it hopes to survive the turmoil ahead. It's hoped that these brave Ponies will inspire their colleagues, friends, and family into following their example."
 LCT_student_movement_idea:0 "The Citizens' Youth"
 LCT_student_movement_idea_desc:0 "The Citizens' Youth is split into two branches. The first is for young foals and focuses upon the implantation of recreational activities such as sports leagues, field trips, and camping expeditions. Another branch, geared towards young mares and stallions, focuses more on teaching military skills, instilling discipline, and providing up and coming soldiers with a sense of patriotism."
 LCT_for_the_prince_idea:0 "Fight for the Prince"
 LCT_for_the_prince_idea_desc:0 "Our military fights for one thing, and one thing alone, that is to fulfill the desires of our Grand Prince and expand his influence to the troubled lands of our neighbours. In their fervour to accomplish this, all thoughts of individualism and self-interest should be forgotten."
 LCT_princely_divinity_idea:0 "Work for the Prince"
 LCT_princely_divinity_idea_desc:0 "Our armies can not fight effectively, in the name of their Prince, without proper equipment. As such, our need for heavenly devotion should be extended to the industrial sector, where the factory work should be made aware that their self-sacrifice is no less important to our victory."
 LCT_citzenship_under_service_idea:0 "Vanguard Foreign Battalions"
 LCT_citzenship_under_service_idea_desc:0 "There is a deep-seated sense of xenophobia amongst many within the River Coalition against the various bordering Griffon regimes. By taping into these feelings, and offering enlistment to any Pony willing to fight Griffons, we can greatly increase the available pool of ponypower for our army."
 LCT_preparations:0 "Preparations"
 LCT_preparations_desc:0 "Our administration is pushing for total war against the terrors of Griffonkind. However, our economic system and equipment stockpiles are woefully underprepared for such a struggle. We must take immediate action to rectify both of these problems as quickly as possible."
 LCT_defend_against_griffs:0 "Frontier Defense"
 LCT_defend_against_griffs_desc:0 "The recent invasion of Griffon lands has moved our army beyond the protection of their previous fortifications. Immediate action must be taken to construct a new defensive network in order to ensure their safety."
 LCT_settle_lands:0 "Settle the Frontier"
 LCT_civilian_government:0 "Civilian Government"
 LCT_civilian_government_desc:0 "In the aftermath of February 4th, Wavebreaker and the SDP have moved towards rooting out the military's influence within Lake City's politics. While this move has ensured the loyalty of Lake City's bureaucrats, it has also brought the new administration into direct conflict with the military, an organization known to react violently to such confrontations."
 LCT_students_empowerd:0 "The Apprenticeship Program"
 LCT_students_empowerd_desc:0 "For generations the teaching of trades within Lake City has been handled by experienced tradeponies taking on apprentices and teaching them the skills needed for their work. While a bit archaic, this system has kept us abundantly supplied with skilled labour."
 LCT_free_healthcare_idea:0 "Socialized Healthcare"
 LCT_free_healthcare_idea_desc:0 "Ima keep it real with u 57th Grand Mayor of Lake City Wavebreaker. Ain't nobody solving that declining birth rate."
 LCT_self_defence_forces_idea:0 "Self-Defense Forces"
 LCT_self_defence_forces_idea_desc:0 "It is up to every citizen of Lake City to defend their homes from hostile aggression. This philosophy is the backbone of the SDFs, a collection of local militias which can be mobilized in times of crisis to defend Lake City, her citizens, and her democracy from threats, both foreign and domestic."
 LCT_commit_to_freedom_idea:0 "Committed to Freedom"
 LCT_commit_to_freedom_idea_desc:0 "The casting of ballots, printing of newspapers, and freedom of speech. These are the ideals of our democracy, a torch which shines bright against the ever-growing influences of communist, fascist, and regressive regimes. We are a nation must stand united behind these ideals and let the creatures of the world know that we are willing to sacrifice greatly in their defense, even if that defense may not always be at home."
 LCT_fortification_focus:0 "Fortification Focus"
 LCT_fortification_focus_desc:0 "We must develop a strong and complex defensive system in order to better defend our lands from the threats of Griffon raids and invasions."
 LCT_propaganda_idea:0 "Nationalistic Propaganda"
 LCT_propaganda_idea_desc:0 "Private Amethyst Edge (981-1005), killed in action. Private Edge was called upon to defend a small village in western Coltubarski from a column of Griffon bandits. His unit, of around 20 brave troopers, was beset on all sides by 250 Griffon warriors. For two days these brave Ponies held out until their ammunition had been spent. In total, 65 Griffons had been killed, along with 58 Ponies (18 soldiers and 40 civilians). Private Edge's story is especially memorable due to him personally holdiing off ten Griffons from ransacking the village's schoolhouse, which was being used as a refuge by the local population.\n\nHis story, along with hundreds like his, have become the focus of a propaganda campaign aimed at reminding the Ponies of Lake City of the bravery and honour displayed daily in their defense."
 LCT_national_research_council_idea:0 "Chamber of Innovation"
 LCT_national_research_council_idea_desc:0 "The mission of the Chamber of Innovation is to look into technological innovations made abroad and examine the feasibility and advantages of integrating them into our society."

 LCT_focus_on_offence_idea:0 "Griffon Intervention"
 LCT_focus_on_offence_idea_desc:0 "While we have no love for Griffons, we can appreciate that not all of their regimes are so abhorrent. By intervening strategically in Griffon affairs, we can ensure that stable and 'friendly' regimes are set up across Eastern Griffonia."
 LCT_civil_defence_draft_idea:0 "Civil Defense Draft"
 LCT_civil_defence_draft_idea_desc:0 "Our current conflict has forced us to slacken our recruitment standards in order to ensure that our military is properly staffed for the conflict ahead. While this decision is by no means popular, it is necessary if our army wishes to continue fighting."
 LCT_macb_infiltration:0 "MACB Infiltration"
 LCT_macb_infiltration_desc:0 "MACB (Military Assistance Command, Brodfeld) is a special operations forces which specializes in providing technical support and equipment to anti-communist rebels within Eastern Griffonia. Recently, their operations have seen them infiltrate our nation in an effort to undermine our revolution. Until these foreign reactionaries have been purged from our lands we can expect increased unrest, strikes, and outright rebellion against our regime."
 LCT_supplying_macb:0 "MACB"
 LCT_supplying_macb_desc:0 "Military Assistance Command, Brodfeld is showing much success in stirring up anti-communist sympathies in the former Kingdom of Brodfeld. While this department's mission is by no means cheap, it has done much to further our goals of ridding Eastern Griffonia of any traces of instable and hostile regimes. It won't be long before a counter-revolution is sprung and the citizens of Brodfeld liberate themselves."
 LCT_anti_commie_pact:0 "Anti-Communist Pact"
 LCT_anti_commie_pact_desc:0 "Our nation stands united with other anti-communist regimes of Eastern Griffonia, prepared to defend of our lands from the so called Griffon Liberation Army.

 LCT_naval_focus:0 "100 Ship Navy"
 LCT_naval_focus_desc:0 "Our objective must be to ensure the complete and utter security of our territorial waters. As such, we must embark upon an ambitious ship building programme that will see the size of our navy increased to 100 ships within the coming years."
 LCT_air_focus:0 "Aluminum Prioritization"
 LCT_air_focus_desc:0 "By prioritizing the flow of aluminum towards aircraft, we can ensure that our manufacturers have the materials necessary to construct more planes."
 LCT_navy_air_supremacy:0 "First Air Fleet"
 LCT_bloated_high_command:0 "Bloated High Command"
 LCT_bloated_high_command_desc:0 "With enough officers to manage a small country on their own, the massive inner circle of Lake City's military still projects power and prestige. To become a mere "brigadni general" is cause to turn a village upside-down in celebration. Fresh faces are picked to lead the army with strategies fit for a new century, while old beards are retained and venerated for their experience and wisdom from a century past.\n\nBut a long period of peace, as well as the social pressure of rising fast in the military coming to bear on a growing population, has made a burden out of Jezeragrad's high command. Bureaucratic elements have crept in to keep the inner circle from falling apart in the throes of office politics, and quick thinking has been slowly abandoned as every pony on board—with their hefty salaries and egos—wants to have a say on where Lakeponies must strike next."
 LCT_military_politics1:0 "Military Inolvement in Politics - Extreme"
 LCT_military_politics1_desc:0 "To be a valiant warrior is the peak of Lakeish culture, at least in its glory days. Was not Blessed Sword both a princely warrior and a warrior prince?\n\nBut in modern times, this ancient glorification of the army has created unsavoury realities. Bloodlines that can trace themselves to generals hoof-picked by Blessed Sword and his successors, along with new players born and bred in the murky trials of mercenary companies and those who have just amassed as many guns and hooves as they could, have been Jezeragrad's shadow mayor for as long as the republic has been alive. Fraud and embezzlement occur on a regular basis, with a new squad of soldiers to make up for the sudden disappearance of a thousand coins; death threats against representatives boast a high success rate when the agitators have dozens of guns and a few tanks pointed at your face.\n\nAs a result, participating in the political process is either asking for persecution or just going through the motions, for the generals and their officers make sure that there are no real alternatives on the list."

 LCT_military_politics3:0 "Military Inolvement in Politics - High"
 LCT_military_politics3_desc:0 "cant they just f off already"
 LCT_military_politics4:0 "Military Inolvement in Politics - Medium"
 LCT_military_politics4_desc:0 "Lake City's army wields substantial influence in its nation's politics. Parties tailoured for their cause, the presence of cliques hiding away in remote parts of the countryside, and officers possessing a direct line to elected politicians—votes may count, but the ones counting the votes have guns."
 LCT_military_politics5:0 "Military Inolvement in Politics - Low"
 LCT_military_politics5_desc:0 "Other countries have dabbled with the concept of separating the church and the state. In Lake City's case, they have successfully done something else: separating the military and the state.\n\nOf course, the military still performs its duty of defending every Lakepony in the land, and there will always be parties that bring to national attention the voices of the common soldier. However, the cushy positions clueless officers used to take are now headed by competent experts who listen to what everyday civilians want and need.\n\nLake City can rest, knowing that its soldiers are fully dedicated to walking the Soldier's Path without any distractions."
 LCT_reprimanded_industrialists: "Reprimanded the Cehovi"
 LCT_reprimanded_industrialists_desc: "Many are the failings of the Cehovi against Lake City, legal and moral; their reckoning was long overdue.\n\nWhile reprimanding them has encountered some resistance, most of the guilds have complied. It will take time for their workers to get used to their new freedoms, but knowing that the government cares for the downtrodden backbone of Lakeish society will energise them to work with pride and joy."

 LCT_gift_for_lords_baubles:0 "A Gift For Lords"
 LCT_gift_for_lords_baubles_desc:0 "Under the tradition of providing occasional gifts and donations to high officers, Star Talent and Flaming Hot have received a steady stream of baubles, enough to put a noticeable strain on our industry.\n\nAmong Star's requests were high-tech radio equipment from Equestria. Flaming Hot's requests, though, bordered immaturity: the latest automobiles and foreign alcohol from griffon countries like Feathisia."
 LCT_gift_for_lords_money:0 "A Gift For Lords"
 LCT_gift_for_lords_money_desc:0 "Under the guise of earmarking it for defense spending, vaults of money have been "donated" to Westerly Leeward and Smoke Signal. The development of Smoke's monstrous weapons of the future is understandably a long-term development, so results here will be moot for now, but Westerly has already stashed away his money for the next step of the Lords' plan, whatever that may be."
 LCT_gift_for_lords_land:0 "A Gift For Lords"
 LCT_gift_for_lords_land:0 "Under the auspices of military-led land reform policies, Daring Dream and Solid Rocks have sent in several squadrons to secure certain strategic locations, possessing resources or trade hubs.

LCT_ldp_successor_desc:0 "The LDP stands as the end-all, be-all of the above-ground politics in the City.

LCT_martial_law_desc: "The Vanredni Dekret or "The Extraordinary Decree" ostensibly declares a state of emergency, temporarily shuttering most civilian functions until further notice.

LCT_cut_civil_regulations: "Empower the Žandarmerija"
LCT_cut_civil_regulations_desc: "For the sake of a united army, overreaching freedoms must be curtailed. Our gendarmerie will be allowed to arrest dissidents without due process, flush out gatherings of pro-griffon sympathizers, and ask your neighbor nicely in the dead of night where they’d been the whole day and why, among other things..."

LCT_our_talented_industry: "Force an Economic Miracle"

LCT_dream_of_lake_army_desc: "All the guns and machines in the world will come to waste without a steady stream of hooves to bring them to life, so said Daring Dream as of late. A wider-reaching draft should be more than enough to realize her Lakeish dream."

LCT_where_theres_smoke: "A Thousand Smoking Guns"
LCT_where_theres_smoke_desc: "Smoke Signal has connections to black-market arms dealers in Longsword, and while their weapons aren’t exactly top-notch, they will more than suffice. It also goes without saying that said dealers possess enough materials to assemble some mean cannons." #Last sentence does admittedly need some more work to read well.

LCT_all_hands_on_deck: "A Garrisoned State"
LCT_all_hands_on_deck_desc: "Re-assign the workers from toasters to tanks, send the young mares on trains speeding to the front, and order the stallions to pilfer our granaries and warehouses for supplies. Our country will not have a military base; it will become one."

LCT_no_more_civil_government: "Dissolve the Skupština"
LCT_no_more_civil_government_desc: "The Skupština only represents the average Lakeish citizen; it does not exhort him or her to secure a brighter future. From now on, every organ of government will be run by the Lake Army to spur all ponies towards something greater."

LCT_mass_propaganda: "Amass the Media"
LCT_mass_propaganda_desc: "With Star Talent commandeering the printing presses, fiction and non-fiction will be replaced by the undeniable truth of propaganda. Soon, every Lakepony shall flow in concert, plumbing deep together like our own lake."

LCT_utilise_latent_xenophobia: "Exploit Western Exploitations"
LCT_utilise_latent_xenophobia_desc: "The twin orders of Hellquill and Longsword oppress our fellow ponies as second-class citizens at best, slaughtering them en masse at worst. However, that fact is the perfect brain fodder for the Lakeish herds who’ll happily march west to liberate our brethren."

LCT_deponya_to_flames: "The Ten-to-One Plan"
LCT_deponya_to_flames_desc: "The unfortunate truth is that backwards Deponya is ripe for taking by their neighbor Hellquill.

LCT_deponyan_western_forts: "Fort Lake-Deponya"

LCT_force_deponya: "The Future is Now, Old Country"
LCT_force_deponya_desc: "While the Lake army is the first and bravest army in the Riverlands,  it would be suicide to tackle the griffons on our own. A suitable ally must be found in Deponya; they have valuable ponypower and resources which we’ll put to good use, whether they’ll like it or not."

LCT_ten_minutes: "Ten Minutes"

LCT_hunt_honchos: "Hunt the Honchos Down"
LCT_hunt_honchos_desc: "Nobles, knights, Reformisten—every griff that has called the shots over the systematic degredation and massacre of our fellow kind will be rounded up and shot. That the firing squads will consist of solely Hellquillian and Longswordian ponies is not a coincidence."

LCT_a_few_paragons: "A Few Paragons"
LCT_a_few_paragons_desc: "While griffons make up the face of our enemy, it is only because our enemy is the Empire, who happens to wear a beak. The truth is, not all griffons have been complicit in the Empire’s crimes. And if that doesn’t convince our officers to get a few griffs into our ranks, the numbers advantage certainly will."

LCT_griffons_have_no_place: "They Have No Place"
LCT_griffons_have_no_place_desc: "If even one griff grabs enough power here, who knows if they won’t sow the seeds for another Reformisten or another Longswordian Genocide? No, the griffons must know where they stand, and that is far away from the nearest rifle."

LCT_party_like_desc: "The griffons’ cowardly retreats and surrenders has led to tons of looting in Vartai, with stolen luxuries fetching high prices and warm smiles.\n\n This isn’t a problem: We’re the ones doing the looting anyway! Come on, Jala, and dance with us!"

LCT_good_ol_days: "Three Hundred Years of Summer"

LCT_high_on_war_desc: "Put Vojnika, or "The Soldier’s Way," is an ancient code of conduct, instilling in our warriors the virtues of discipline and submission. With another drawn-out battle in the horizon, this country will be nothing but the ideal soldier, and they’re already hankering for it."

LCT_strengthen_mps_desc: "Its name roughly meaning "Higher Police," the Viša Žandarmerija is a military company given special training in efficiently handling subversive elements hiding among our great army. Everypony will do their part because we’ll be watching..."

LCT_beatings_will_continue: "The Beatings Will Continue..."
LCT_beatings_will_continue_desc: "Any organized resistance must be met with an organized anti-resistance, which is why the Viša Žandarmerija will collate its varied interrogation techniques into a one-size-fits-all hoofbook. Constables and majors alike will take a test to assess their knowledge, with several apprehended suspects as "answer sheets.""

LCT_put_em_to_work: "Put Them to Work"
LCT_put_em_to_work_desc: "Jumping from one war to another very soon, we can’t lose momentum. More hooves will be drafted to the home front, and if the front’s not big enough, we’ll make it so."

LCT_taking_stock: "Taking Stock"
LCT_taking_stock_desc: "A survey of both Vartai and our own lands will be conducted to designate the resources we haven’t fully utilized yet. But if that can’t fix it, then we can certainly ask our labourers to add an hour or two to their shifts."

LCT_coerced_labour: "Indefinite Work Hours"
LCT_coerced_labour_desc: "Ponies at the home front must be as alert and as disciplined as their rifle-toting, skull-cracking counterparts. They must wake when called, charge into the factories when needed, and lay down suppressing fire on creeping laziness and recreation."

LCT_special_economic_areas: "EPZs"
LCT_special_economic_areas_desc: "An idea Westerly toyed with was "export-processing zones" which will apparently attract guilds from across Griffonia to produce weapons and equipment for us and their other customers. Reducing tariffs on these international (and griffon-run) guilds seems suspect, but his old notes calculate that the profits would be worth it."

LCT_quotas_will_increase: "Quotas Will Increase..."
LCT_quotas_will_increase_desc: "The previous quotas assumed a constricting view on an individual pony’s abilities. Now that we’ve seen what a unified Lake Army could do when given the chance, it’s time to believe in ourselves much harder and push those limits much further."

LCT_until_morale_improves: "...Until Morale Improves"
LCT_until_morale_improves_desc: "The border state that is Vartai is in our control now, thanks to our local leaders and their loyal underlings. A nasty piece of work they did, getting everyone to fall in line for the Imperial war. The lords are impressed."

LCT_onto_important_matters_desc: "With the passing of Westerly Leeward, a replacement is urgently needed to assure everypony that everything will be all right."

LCT_aerial_takeover: "The Lone Domain Aerial Network"
LCT_aerial_takeover_desc: "The Herzlanders, united or not, are still creatures of flight; their synergy with aerial warfare cannot be denied. What can be denied, though, is entry into our airspace, thanks to a freshly constructed network of anti-air placements and one of those new-fangled radar things."

LCT_recruitment_drive: "The Nacrt Odluke"
LCT_recruitment_drive_desc: "The draft must increase to meet the ever-growing needs of our final showdown in the Herzland. If the griffons kill one of us, two will exact their revenge."

LCT_preparing_our_border: "The Anti-Herz Line"
LCT_preparing_our_border_desc: "Solid Rocks' success with The Anti-Ost Line spells a repeat performance to shut out the winged peril. His proposal for The Anti-Herz Line isn’t just sound, we’ve already ordered our worker-soldiers to build the foundations already."

LCT_logistics_officers: "Legitimise the Komanda Kamiona"
LCT_logistics_officers_desc: "Being part of the "Truck Command" used to draw in insults insinuating that you weren’t a "real" soldier. Not anymore.

LCT_load_the_guns: "Take Aim at the Vultures"
LCT_load_the_guns_desc: "The final struggle awaits us. We shall be tested, but what is war but not a cleansing fire from which our burning souls shall come out as the spirits’ warriors... and into which the Imperial vultures shall writhe forever?"

LCT_the_grifkings_riches_desc: "Of course, we’d like to acquire the entire Griffking river, but Vartai’s portion of it hides fertile fields ripe for the taking. Why haven’t we exploited these waters sooner? Get Big Money to negotiate some factory deals for the river now!"

LCT_a_ribbon_of_steel_desc: "Roads and rails are the veins of an army, that is true, with supplies being our blood. What else is true is that these can be made stronger. Get your shovels ready, and use your veins, everypony!"

LCT_guest_workers: "Enlist Guest Workers"
LCT_guest_workers_desc: "Vartai may be good people, but they could be better used back in the beating heart of the Army in Jezeragrad and elsewhere to bolster our high-octane manufacturing. The griffons among them should be thankful: they’re getting free tours of the city!"

LCT_cold_iron: "A Sword’s Cold Steel"
LCT_cold_iron_desc: "Flaming Hot’s told us that his contacts uncovered "various hot spots of iron ore activity" in Swordsson. While that’s not exactly the right term for it, this is great news for our war factories who’ll now have an easier time making steel. We won’t run out of bullets just yet!"

LCT_operation_jaburo: "Operation Jaburo"
LCT_operation_jaburo_desc: "The whole fiery front shall sing as our Army gallops into Griffenheim together! Expel the griffons from their high places, Lakesponies! Blood shall run by the Griffking for Lakeish glory and ponish freedom!"

LCT_dream_deeper: "Maximise Every Shot"

LCT_tune_the_howitzers_desc: "With the full support and assistance of our cannon-loving Smoke Signal, our artillery have been calibrated to the most minute of scales.

LCT_cutting_edge_firearms: "Cutting-edge Firearms"

 # SPRINGTIME FROST INTRO
 ###
 
 LCT_springtime_intro.1.t: "Long Day"
 LCT_springtime_intro.1.d: "The sumptuous smell of cauliflower soup wafted through the kitchen, and Everlasting Green was proud of it. It wasn't exactly grilled beans casserole, but her husband wasn't a picky eater. Soup was easy to cook without being "processed garbage", as he put it.\n\nThen, the door opened. Springtime was here to stay, though not for long. She knew his schedule: tonight, he'd visit the homes of several Demokratski clubs and factions, and promise them his support for this year's election campaign.\n\nHe sat at the dinner table, with baggy eyes. Everlasting grunted as kindly as possible, and he took it as his cue to pour his heart out.\n\nBy the time soup was ready and the children were called, Springtime had disclosed much. Parades, ceremonies, rituals, grand openings... and part of them were just subtle signs of acquiescence to the Cehovi businessponies who had bribed him before he had an idea what to use more money for, to the majors and generals who pushed him into office and, at gunpoint, gave him a list of what bills to approve.\n\n"Just one more year of this," he said once the foals finished their dinner early and galloped upstairs. "You won't have to worry about this soon, Ever. They've already guaranteed my safety after the election."\n\nEver frowned. "How can you be so sure? They burned the last Grand Mayor down, and he seemed to be doing well. No one knew...""
 LCT_springtime_intro.1.a: ""One more year, dear, just one more year...""
 
 LCT_springtime_intro.2.t: "Summer Days"
 LCT_springtime_intro.2.d: "Springtime was gone. For a few days on a Demokratski campaign trip.\n\nAfter accompanying the foals to school, Everlasting entered into her own little campaign, visiting various openings of schools and high-class cocktail parties throughout the day, with the Grand Mayor's blessing. Springtime was still just one pony, and if he was busy, social climbers didn't want to converse with clerks but with the pony closest to him. She didn't believe herself to be good at it, but she still saw herself as a thermometer of the political scene, helpful to her husband in her own way.\n\nWhen the sun melted into a dusk's orange, she headed home. City lights flickered on to the scent of coffee and gas. Cars, trains, and old carriages sped by, night- or graveyard-shifters moving into position, ignoring the facades of ancient fortresses from the River Empire's time as camera-toting tourists (even diamond dogs) visited.\n\nAt a park, foals were using slingshots to take down birds in flight. A recruiter "just passing by" came along, talking up the honour and valour of joining the army, of soon beating up "real birds" across the Longswordian border.\n\nOnly Ever and perhaps that recruiter knew anything of the vice grip that held the nation together. She, too, counted down the days. The love of her life was being ripped apart by his own people. What honour could a husband and father have if he bowed to every merciless demand they had?\n\nHer heart burned. The tears welled."
 LCT_springtime_intro.2.a: "Even if the lake goes up in flames: one more year."
 
 LCT_springtime_intro.3.t: "A Conviction to Serve"
 LCT_springtime_intro.3.d: "Springtime's office recently held meetings with several prominent military figures, among them Iron Gate of the Žandarmerija, Wild Tree of the Preko Drvoreda, and Star Talent of the Six Lords of War. One theme ran through them all: assurance.\n\nThe Grand Mayor proposed: Why does a newborn republic fall? Reaction from outside wasn't the only cause: it was pre-existing clans, cliques, or parties lacking assurance that, if they did not get elected, their power would fade and they would die. Kingdoms at least had bloodlines and traditions.\n\nSo, it was easy to discern that fear in the army, that they'd be reduced to a standing force that defended and did nothing more. Gone were the fantastic tales of Blessed Sword's last stands and impossible battles—they'd be replaced by faceless guns. Who needed the old army in office when anypony can pull a trigger to keep the peace?\n\nA deal was then struck: The army will retain most of its political privileges, provided that they work to deserve and keep them. The government will treat them just like a drill army sergeant would: you'd earn your stripes, and in this boot camp, they were all political privates. Uplift impoverished ponies, patrol crime-ridden areas, help out in paperwork: this was the least they could do.\n\nObjections were raised, but Springtime's argument held water. In this matter, they could do nothing but trust him."

 # DIRTY DEEDS INTRO
 ###
 
 LCT_dirty_intro.1.t: "Dirty Deeds"
 LCT_dirty_intro.1.d: "The concrete monolith of a headquarters betrayed its company's lack of old Cehovi heritage, home to The Industrial Development Corporation versus the historic Neighsan and Watersaki. Brutalist, windowless angles and edges spoke volumes of its founder and president.\n\nNow, in Deeds' traditional paper-walled office for today's meeting, a sour taste settled on Springtime's tongue, overpowering any desire to drink the brandy the famed Stallion of Eternal Construction had offered. Half of Jezeragrad's latest buildings had his name somewhere, having had funneled out-of-town farmers hoping to strike metaphorical gold in the capital, catapulting the city into a new century. Still, overheard words from military advisers of long hours, borrowed mattresses, and first aid teams having to be on standby block had made Springtime pause: Jezeragrad was growing up with blood on its hooves.\n\nBut Springtime kept nodding his head through the small talk. Soon, a deal would be offered to help stabilise the Demokratski and, therefore, the country, for next year's elections."
 LCT_dirty_intro.1.a: "Everyone has a price. Even demons."
 
 LCT_dirty_intro.2.t: "To Outsmart Wildlife"
 LCT_dirty_intro.2.d: ""...should you succeed in the first stage of voting," Springtime continued, "you still have to get through the debates with, among other candidates, the military's pick."\n\nDeeds took another sip of brandy. "The army's a good client, but... have you forgotten what they've done to the last pony to hold your office?"\n\nA fidgeting Springtime pushed the fiery memory out of his mind. "Dew Point was... too much of an idealist, not the compromising sort. You, however, are somepony the army cannot just manipulate, compromise or no. You have funds, assets, labourers and if you're willing to go that far, private militias." Effecting a sage nod, "It is a mistake to judge the army as a hive mind. They, too, are held by not much more than rifles and defence."\n\n"Alright, I'll take your word for it; I have my recourse. Still, Wild Tree is a... rather wild fellow."\n\n"Then use his radical nature against him. Push him to overstep the points he makes, then those in attendance will look to you to espouse something tamer. Your so-called crimes would be refreshing in comparison...""
 LCT_dirty_intro.2.a: "Deeds jotted down notes."
 
 LCT_dirty_intro.3.t: "The Demokratski's Great Unifier"
 LCT_dirty_intro.3.d: "Jumping headlong into politics as the Demokratski's conservative candidate still had his jaw drop. It took fifteen minutes for him to break up Springtime's monologue: "On the contrary, this is unnecessary. My subsidiaries already participate in the party's little 'membership clubs' for over a dozen factions."\n\n"Which might've been fine half a century ago, but all these socialists, supremacists, and other -ists have complicated matters. Those clubs have spun off into smaller, more numerous clubs and factions, until this party is nothing more but a loose confederation, vaguely united by... whose values are we conserving when there's a thousand petty squabblers who can't agree on what we should conserve?"\n\n"So you're asking me to somehow represent every single disparate Demokratski sect," Deeds flatly replied.\n\n"I'll grant you the freedom to figure out what to do for each one. Fortunately, it's not ideologies but simple-minded rivalries and heritages that keep this party divided. Join one, send money to another, retract support from some other, threaten a raid of still another..."\n\nAs Springtime explained the dense web of the party's splintering factions, he spotted Deeds smiling. He couldn't imagine the conglomerate stallion as a political warlord."
 LCT_dirty_intro.3.a: "Could he?"
 
 LCT_dirty_intro.4.t: "Golden Eggs"
 LCT_dirty_intro.4.d: ""This has been a productive meeting, Grand Mayor," Deeds finally said as they stood up, shook hooves, "but one more thing: I'd already made arrangements for my son to take over in my place. Local politics is intriguing, but I've heard that a fusion of angel investing, start-ups, and private military companies is a very lucrative mix in southern Griffonia and Zebrica."\n\nA conflagration of confusion mixed with wrath hit Springtime. He bit his lip, kept shaking hooves. "That is quite a shame, but I wish you safety on your endeavours, especially with them after you."\n\nDeeds raised a brow. "Who?"\n\n"You've raised up Dew Point once," said a suddenly frowning Springtime. "See, you misunderstand. No matter what happens to Tree, he and his supporters—and the whole army—desire your ample war chests. Don't you already support some of their own cliques with your deals? They would not want you and your moeny to leave." Deeds gulped, but Springtime kept on, "Tell me: What happens if they find out that their one and only goose laying their golden eggs is trying to leave? Or that he's ignored a direct order from their so-called puppet?"\n\nBoth stallions kept a firm grip on each other's hooves. Their stare could pierce the other's heart. His own heart shook, beating a thousand times a second.\n\nDeeds sighed, sat down, beckoned the president to do the same; only then could Springtime relax."
 LCT_dirty_intro.4.a: ""For a puppet, Grand Mayor, you're good at stringing deals your way.""
 
 LCT_dirty_intro.5.t: "Grease"
 LCT_dirty_intro.5.d: "On the surface, the Kicoltinda Mariners' Spot had odd-looking mariners drinking at the counter: suave suits, designer shoes, preference for wine over beer and ale. These, however, were politicians for an influential Demokratski faction in Kicoltinda, propped up by mercantile policies over its fishing industry, squeezing extra money out of griffons who didn't mind the ponies hauling in good trout so long as coins and fish swapped forelimnbs.\n\nSpringtime hung back on a chair, giving and receiving greetings, but he could spot Deeds making his way into the establishment. The businesspony got himself a glass of wine then started smooth-talking with his neighbours like long-time buddies. By the hour's end, even sailors who represented the Lake-River Patrol, what could pass for the Lake City's navy, were enraptured by Deeds' promises, any surprise at his announcement of running as a candidate long replaced by a passion to see impressive cash empower real change.\n\nThen, Springtime could smile. His last-minute bluff, the whole "golden eggs" shtick, had worked. The party would be safe with Deeds holding up the tent, keeping the attention off Springtime, especially when Deeds could maximise blackmail and more on less compliant clubs than the Mariners'. His superiors in the army had Deeds to deal with now, not just Springtime... assuming they wouldn't be paid off by Deeds' proposals for partnerships."
 LCT_dirty_intro.5.a: "A free, peaceful election has been bought."

 # CEHOVI INTRO
 ###
 
 LCT_cehovi_intro.1.t: "Cehovi"
 LCT_cehovi_intro.1.d: "The Cehovi, Lake City's biggest business guilds, had benign beginnings with a struggling merchant class making do in a society where warriors, especially the honourable Službuniti, were everypony's destinies. However, the sacking of Jezeragrad in the eighth century and the country's subsequent republican rebirth threw the traders into a new world where they could rally for greater corporate liberties. Seasoned sword-bearers soon joined them, finding value in the peaceful art of production for the ponies they used to defend. A succession of Grand Mayors recognised their work, with Grand Mayor Scatter Blossom, in the late 990s, elevating several chief executives to significant roles in the Ministry of the Economy.\n\nBut as Springtime stood before sleek, smiling neckties and their wearers in his office, the Grand Mayor wondered when the noble warrior-merchants turned sour. Liberal economic policies meant that the state wouldn't needlessly meddle in the economy, not the economy needlessly meddling in the state, asking for lower minimum wages, privatisation of bureaucracy, and bidding for government contracts for basic infrastructure.\n\nStill, Springtime might not've been genuinely elected by the people, but he was going to act for them and finally deny these laissez-faire requests and bribes. The polite smiles lessened, and he knew that rage lay silent within them, but the vultures saw Springtime growing a spine for once, and that was enough for today."
 LCT_cehovi_intro.1.a: "Dynasties of robber barons, they all are."

 LCT_cehovi_intro.2.t: "Such a Thing as Bad Publicity"
 LCT_cehovi_intro.2.d: "At the offices of The Jezeragrad Dailies, Springtime wrote his signature of approval, and they would be the final publication to be part of the plan: work overtime to print a couple anti-Cehovi fliers in the name of defunct or non-existent leftist parties, and get anonymous "youngblood on the street" to pen anti-Cehvoi columns.\n\nOver the week, Springtime read the papers with scrutiny. While the headlines were the usual speculation on the upcoming election, a certain Spoken Spell, supposedly a college student, had written a half-page treatise on "why the corporatist guilds, assuming that all actors seek their own gain (by their own liberal policies), will, with enough power, subvert the state into a neo-medieval state that is indistinguishable from serfdom".\n\nAs expected, the afternoon brought a deluge of letters and phone calls from the businessponies regarding Spoken Spell and other such ponies, concerned about when and how this sudden hotbed of communism had sprung. In response, Springtime said that the writers have a point, and if the Cehovi want to help maintain the facade of democracy, they may as well listen to the national dialogue and try to appease a new generation of morally conscious ponies."
 LCT_cehovi_intro.2.a: "If they don't, the army and their guns could persuade them."

 # WAVEBREAKER INTRO

 LCT_wavebreaker_intro.1.t: ""Wavebreaker""
 LCT_wavebreaker_intro.1.d: "That's the name of a pilot who, just twelve hours ago as the latest report states, rebuffed an entire squadron of raiders from Longsword, having shot down most of the enemy planes long before reinforcements arrived, forcefully convincing the rest to flee.\n\nHowever, as he headed back to base, his plane suffered an engine failure which was quickly followed by the breaking off of one of its wings. He crashed halfway between Prištinaigh and Jezeragrad.\n\nThat Wavebreaker was able to survive the impact was a miracle by itself. Then he survived being unattended for upwards of ten minutes before a farmer from a nearby village could reach him. Amazingly, he still lived after not receiving professional treatment immediately—the village did not have a fully fledged hospital—before spending half an hour in an ambulance carriage to Jezeragrad.\n\nTime will tell if Wavebreaker recovers well enough to return to active duty. Still, whatever his fate may be, the ace has already become the subject of national interest. Jezeragrad's brand-new radio station promises hourly updates straight from the medical staff themselves."
 LCT_wavebreaker_intro.1.a: "But if life passes like cherry blossoms..."
 
 LCT_wavebreaker_intro.2.t: "Discharged"
 LCT_wavebreaker_intro.2.d: "What should've been years of recovery has been reduced to two months' rest and check-ups, as today marks Wavebreaker's discharge from the hospital. He has, however, also been medically retired from active service due to significant damage to his eyesight. Wavebreaker has not been too saddened by this, as he finds "much gratitude to the spirits that have given me a new lease on life".\n\nThere is no question regarding his future, though, as Wavebreaker's first civilian act is to declare his membership in the harmonic Udruzenje Moderni Pohod, led by founder Deirdre Skye. Reporters expressed surprise at his political affiliation, but as Wavebreaker explained, his own account and later investigation of the crash emphasised the lack of enemy damage on his plane:\n\n"If it wasn't the griffons, then who? Either the guilds who made the plane or the officers who ordered the manufacture of such subpar planes. Do you see the scar on my face that banished me out of a plane forever? This is what you get when—and I say this hypothetically—a few finicky generals demand that the quota of fighters must be met immediately, no matter the cost: the common soldier suffers. This is why I join hooves with Skye, to restore the military to the ideals of the spirits and their Soldiers' Path."\n\nWavebreaker will be appointed to the party as an advisor on military policies. He is expected to join Skye on the campaign trail for the 1008 elections."\n\nWavebreaker will be appointed to the party as an advisor on military policies.

 LCT_wavebreaker_intro.3.t: "The Big Stick of Harmony"
 LCT_wavebreaker_intro.3.d: "The next city on the Udruzenje's campaign tour was Zasaddle, straddling the Griffking River. Collecting the scraps of Svetigrad's booming Coalition trade, the forgotten gateway to the Riverlands had seen much better days, with colourful riverside facades hiding impoverished peasants and struggling merchants.\n\nThe speeches of Skye and her chosen candidate for the Zasaddle mayoral race, however, were overcome by a political novice fast making a name for himself, his scarred face and fiery rhetoric contradicting the stereotype of "goody four-shoes" harmonites.\n\n"I cannot encourage you to send your foals to a dishonourable lair of cutthroats!" Wavebreaker shouted before the gathered masses. "Corruption has usurped the venerable Lake City and its army! I do not want your children to be in my place, to have suffered what I have at callous hooves whose unending passion for power contaminate the very system that dares to speak for the common pony! What happened to loyalty and responsibility to the ponies you defend, to your loved ones back home? The army is nothing more than a club of gun-toting ribbon-wearers!\n\n"So do not doom your children to a life where the Soldiers' Path is abandoned, where they will be debased into self-serving demons! Only in the Udruzenje may we finally have an army that carries both the rifle and the shovel, both the muscle to protect and the heart to serve!""
 LCT_wavebreaker_intro.3.a: "The cheers rang so loud, the Griffking rippled."
 
 LCT_wavebreaker_intro.4.t: "The Mare of the Thistle"
 LCT_wavebreaker_intro.4.d: "The Udruzenje's headquarters housed a smoking room for deliberations among the party's chairponies. There, Deirdre, remained silent in the stench as hooves passed reports and words typewritten in red, mixed with photos of half-empty crowds. The Pònaidh-blooded mare could smile: rare was the sight of professors, sergeants, and farmers exerting themselves so vigorously to obtain Harmony.\n\nBut she could sense that what stood between them and Harmony now was herself.\n\nThe general assembly that night confirmed her prediction. Passionate speeches crafted her condemnation: her recent Pònaidhean escapade stained the party's reputation with allegations of hyper-pacifism and dishonour, which only brought into light the flaws of her passive strategy, letting other parties scoop up a sizable power base with in-your-face crusades that nonetheless brought their causes to the constituents where they were.\n\nFour-fifths voted for a non-confidence resolution over Deirdre's Udruzenje leadership. All Deirdre showed was a bitten lip. An applause sent her off with profuse thanks for a quarter-century's worth of Harmonic service. While the next few weeks would leave the party headless, Deirdre said in soft tones that they would be fine.\n\nThe last representative to see her before she left saw her trot away, packing no bags, heading south-east. To her ancestral lands."

 LCT_wavebreaker_intro.5.d: "Great crowds flocked to the party's halls or tuned into the radio for the great debates between the remaining runners after a hectic round of preliminary voting. Among them were a Ponikami priest, Chanting Dawn, advocating for national obedience to the Soldiers' Path's virtues; a River Republic immigrant, Stardust Delight, emphasising peaceful friendship between all races; a refugee miner and Longswordian Genocide survivor, nicknamed Uncle Ingot, urging for anti-Cehovi restrictions and regulations.\n\nAnd there was Wavebreaker. While not the most elucidative, his rustic, even caustic, language raked in the most cheers and whoops from the audience. His calls for the honour-cleansing of the military, for exacting justice to the bloodbath-loving griffons of the west, and for stripping all military branches of extra-martial power so that high command and their army would serve Lake City selflessly—these demands had his opponents half-blushing, especially with their own lack of armed Lakeish service.\n\nThe second stage of votes came and went, and to even his own surprise, Wavebreaker won and was swiftly installed as the Udruzenje Moderni Pohod's president. Already, the press expressed praise for the pilot politician, having gone from a nobody in the scene of politics to the leader of a major Lake City party in less than half a year."

LCT_lords_intro.1.t: "A Gift For Lords"
LCT_lords_intro.1.d: "Within the sprawling system that makes up Lake City, there exists six powerful individuals known as the Lords of War. An incredibly exclusive military clique that holds a large amount of influence over our army. While the extent of their power is only truly known to us and our most veteran generals, the power they wield over Lake City and our military in particular cannot be understated. As their power is too great for us to simply tolerate, their level of influence demands that they be placated, else we risk losing all semblance of control within our own ranks. What they may want as a gift, however, depends on which one of them you ask.\n\nStar Talent and Flaming Hot ask for expensive trinkets and baubles. What they may want to do with those gifts is something we have no knowledge of whatsoever, but considering how much they value power, it would not be a stretch to assume they would try to use those items to enhance their own authority.\n\nWesterly and Smoke Signal ask for nothing more than money. Their clear agenda incentivizes that all resources be dedicated towards strengthening our military and ensuring victory at any cost. While Smoke Signal clearly pushes for her ideas of funding more "wonder weapons", Westerly's focus remains more grounded in reality.\n\nFinally, Daring Dream and Solid Rocks ask for nothing else but more land. Even as these two seem the most fiery than the rest, their goals seem to be clearly focused solely upon expanding their influence, even if they claim that more land under their control means better security."

LCT_six_lords.1.t: "Extraordinary Times" #they declare martial law
LCT_six_lords.1.d: ""The decree’s made it official: we’re under martial law."\n\nAnd Westerly closed the door to his office, the adrenaline from his latest speech to the Skupština finally leaving his veins.\n\nLeaving the rest of the dreaded Šest Vojvodi seated at the desk in the far end of the room.\n\nBut instead of getting back to work, they assaulted him with laughter and tears of joy. Flaming Hot reached for the closest batch of ice-cold Kiria-imported beer, Daring Dream guzzled down a wine bottle in seconds, and Solid Rocks kept slamming the table while repeating, "That’s how it’s done!"\n\nThe stench of Smoke Signal’s Rakija-laden breath reached Westerly’s nose as she grabbed his withers. "Whut’s wrung, Lee-wee?  We did the... coup-coup cluck, right? Took over those cuckoo griffons frem da—"\n\n"Get some water already, Smoke," Star Talent cut in as she sat her friend down; Star was the only other lord who hadn’t tasted alcohol tonight. "Sorry for the mess, Mr. Westerly. I’ll... keep her safe."\n\nThe commotion behind him continued as Westerly opened the nearest window. Outside, balloons flew to the sound of trumpets everywhere, with parades attracting flocks of hundreds if not thousands of citizens eager to see once more the military might of Lake City grace their every waking moment.\n\nIn the periphery of his vision, soldiers escorted a dozen Skupština representatives at gunpoint.\n\nWhere to, Westerly wouldn’t be told."

LCT_six_lords.2.d: ""Miss Salt Creek," Iron Gate, commander of the Žandarmerija, yammered to the resident with the broken-in door, "I need to know why you weren’t at home from two to three AM. Oh, didn’t know about the curfew? Sorry, but we’ll tear this place apart for suspicious activity, just to be sure, see?"\n\nShe wasn’t the first nor the last pony Iron had seen paralyzed, though sometimes, it wasn’t fear that did it but awe. In Salt’s face, it was the latter: her eyes portrayed confidence, like that of a foal who’d studied laboriously for an exam and knew she’d pass.\n\n"Yeah, got nothing," Iron muttered to himself after thanking Salt for her co-operation. He put a hoof on the pedal of his police car, and the engine roared to life again. "Now, stallions, Mud Flat’s next. High-minded type. You all know poets are griffon-commie lovers, right?"\n\nAt Mud’s bungalow, notebooks spilled from cardboard boxes filled with lines exalting "the same spirit that instills in hoof and claw their being." One look was all it took for Mud to be in cuffs, though he was the first prisoner today to sit passenger-side.\n\nThat meant Iron could pat him on the withers, gesturing at the blocks of homes where the Žandarmerija’s rifles, batons, and hoofcuffs could come and go as they pleased. They lived as petty kings.\n\n"Hey, colt, no hard feelings. I was just wondering why you’re having some pony inferiority complex, that’s all.""

LCT_six_lords.3.t: "The Final Session" #remove the civil government
LCT_six_lords.3.d: "The past weeks saw fear grip the remaining representatives who hadn’t been marched into who-knows-where. They’d welcomed the coup, unlike their harmonic brethren, but the Six Lords told them to wait their turn.\n\nThen, the Lords, represented by Westerly Leeward, allowed a session in the Skupština. Fifteen minutes, he said. The next morning, few answered; the rest had claimed it’d be a farce or a trap.\n\nThe anteroom before the House’s hall ended up as the venue, with Westerly standing in the middle of an impromptu semi-circle of occupied chairs.\n\n"We’ve instituted this parliament with good intentions," he began, pacing on the carpet. He made no eye contact. "Yet, a filth has spread across the nation. Democracy has turned our loyal soldiers into fickle voters, splintering into a disarray of disjointed interest groups. You may say that we are all united against the griffon and communist terrors, but you are blind to the greater terror that lies within this parliament, a wretched system where political divisions generate civil wars every day, only without the guns... even then, how else did Springtime come to power?"\n\nHe turned his back to them. Shadows marred the creases of his aging face.\n\n"Now, there’s only you, supposedly the most faithful. But the nature of creatures is predictable; leeches like you will gravitate to the greatest source of power. Which is us, I recognize, but once someone else dangles a fatter purse before your eyes, Jezeragrad will be nothing to you."\n\nWesterly raised a hoof.\n\nDoors from both sides opened. Uniforms and guns poured out, gloved hooves gagging the politicians and hoisting their struggling bodies out of their seats. Only then did those shrieking bodies notice Westerly having turned his face back to them.\n\n"The Skupština is a hovel of greedy pigs. The Lords shall make a clean sweep of this mess. We’ll lead the Lake Army against the griffon threat..."
LCT_six_lords.3.a: ""And you won’t take part in it.""

LCT_six_lords.4.t: "Hour 25" #mass propaganda time
LCT_six_lords.4.d: "Daring thought the idea was silly ever since the presses bowed to their control, and Smoke threatened to shoot her radio out of a cannon if she heard Star’s voice crackle through it.\n\nBut the neighsayers wouldn’t stop her.\n\nBefore sunrise, Star pranced to her new daytime job. Posters plastered on the walls exhorted passers-by to sign up for boot camp; the children and the elderly were preached at to buy bonds for a war that hasn’t happened yet; a bookstore boasted a sale for military treatises and the history of Blessed Sword and Lake City’s golden age of militarism and iron-hoof rule. Of course, the newspapers declared the same headlines about the latest in Lakeish rifle developments: Star’s personal squad stood in their offices, ready to fire combat spells should they find falsehoods get evading censors.\n\nThe looming gates of the brand-new Radio Jezeragrad station put Star in awe before she got out of her daze and trotted into the building. She’d heard of the wonders of this new technology, of utilizing the air to speak clearly to ponies throughout the nation and even across borders. Engineers had told her that, at a certain frequency, ponies hiding for safety from Hellquillian and Longswordian hooligans would hear her. Maybe a couple griffons, too, who’d managed to smuggle in a radio set.\n\nBut that audience would come later. The lights turned on in the studio, another engineer pointed at her, and the broadcast commenced. The microphone transmitted her words to the homes of Lakeponies eager to hear and heed what their new masters had to say about a promised glorious future.\n\n"Hello! This is Star Talent, and you’re listening to Hour 25, where the Lakeish truth matters! We’ve got a few songs lined up from our army’s field band, but before we get there—" she crumpled a blank sheet of paper "—I’ve received a letter from a poor pony persecuted by the Reformisten!""

LCT_six_lords.5.t: "Vultures" #exploiting xenophobia for the funsies
LCT_six_lords.5.d: "The news reached latchkey teenager Cobalt Pond at lunch break along with his classmates: a young private, only a few years older than Cobalt, was rushed to the local hospital, suffering life-threatening injuries from a roving band of griffon brigands that haunted Jezeragrad’s outskirts. The criminals had been arrested, sentenced to penal labour.\n\nClass were suspended. His friends headed out to the commotion across the street. They said the authorities had took the griffons out of jail just to show them off in the public square.\n\nMr. Leeway could be spotted, but the alien prisoners stole Cobalt’s attention. He’d never seen a griffon since foalhood, when his father took him out on border patrol to see a Longswordian watchtower staffed by the vile things: wings to send them leaps and bounds to their prey, claws to pin their helpless victims down, beaks to rip off the skin and bone of sinless creatures. Vultures, his father said, before showing off a claw’s scars around his neck.\n\n"This is the final state of those who’ve dipped their claws in bloodbaths!" Westerly’s words brought Cobalt back to the present. He stood so close to Lake City’s savior now; his father would’ve been proud. "Massacring the innocent blackens the soul until their husks devolve into lifeless wandering pillagers!"\n\n"The predators must pay for their genocide!" a mare in the crowd cried out. Applause overtook her.\n\n"Yes, they must! The beaked devils must pay for the genocide of the Vartai ponies! If we fall to apathy, to griffish passivity, these ponies’ torture shall continue for another century! Shall we wait for our neighbours, this sham of an alliance, to act? Shall we abandon our duty and compassion to our kind?"\n\nBut the rest of the speech would be lost on Cobalt. Westerly’s assistants had made space in the crowd before planting a sign by the outlaws: "Speak your mind to the vulture.""

LCT_six_lords.6.t_1: "At the Gates" 
LCT_six_lords.6.d_1: "Flags watched over the Skupština, where, unlike the politicians of old, the Lords withstood the elements on a modest platform of wood. Before them stood a lake's worth of ponies, with pegasi in the back flying just to get a good look. An unarmed citizen among them was a rarity.\n\nWesterly had already gone on about the vaunted history of ponykind in Griffonia, about the individual spheres of peace and prosperity of Equus and, closer to home, the River Coalition. "But," he moved on, "hatched from the Herzland's Imperial egg is the foul spirits that are the knightly orders to our west. Their simple-minded raiders blinded us to the fruits of their hideous roots, that the robbers were only the spring and summer to an autumn harvest of hatred: the calls to return to Grover II's conquests, the fearmongering stirring griffons up to view a foal with murderous intent, and their most odious blight upon the world—the Reformisten and their bloodbath.\n\n"As we speak, a winter of carnage has befallen our neighbours. While Hellquill's knights give free rein to Wingfried's cabal, Longsword wallows in gory anarchy between the ruthless legitimisers of genocide, the cowardly mercenaries of the status quo, and the naive vanguards of socialism!\n\n"Lakeponies, the unparalleled energy and firepower of our army endows upon us a heavy responsibility. Vartai belongs to Vartai, no more and no less! So, shall we sit on our hooves and be spectators to the incomparable tribulations of our friends and family? No! It is time we step in and forge a peace for Vartai... and ensure that Ost-Griffonia answers for their aspirations for an entire species' extermination!""

LCT_six_lords.6.d_2: "Scores of bodies huddled around in the plaza to listen to Westerly's next words. By now, war had already been declared against Hellquill and Longsword; the other Lords had long been at the front, performing last-minute preparations.\n\n"...they've replaced one exploded keg of dynamite with another," Westerly continued. "I would implore those who disagree with our righteous army to list down whoever runs Longsword: craven and remorseless raiders, Grover-inspired nobles and knights, or socialists who dare place a dishonourable griffon on the same level as a pony who's lost their home, their wealth, and their loved ones in the bloodshed of the past decade!\n\n"Whatever new face guides Longsword will only perpetuate the cycle of persecution. They bandage up a cancer with their supposed new turn in policies! But this disease—of the spirit and the heart—must be rooted out, neutralised at the source. Devilish spirits seek to kill and destroy ponykind, not as a test like our own oni, but for destruction without end, without purpose, lurking in the shadows of this new Longswordian order.\n\n"So enough of waiting! There is indeed honour in the Soldier's Path as so many of our blessed souls have taken, but more so once we submit in service to those in need! We shall depose of the knightly orders' final rulers, clean the slate so we can start fresh, take every griffons' deeds into account—both resentful murderers and willing bystanders—to secure a future for our friends and family in Vartai! Fight not for senseless bloodletting, Lake City, but for your honour... and theirs!"\n\nApplause rocked the plaza, went halfway to making Westerly deaf."

LCT_six_lords.6.d_3: ""Perhaps, in another world," Westerly continued before Jezeragrad's pony-flooded streets, "we and Starry Night's partisans would've been allies. She is a rare example of a kind-hearted socialist, an honest believer in her ideology's ideals. Were it not for her organisation, the Longswordian Bloodbath would've been a total annihilation of ponykind in Vartai.\n\n"But an honourable demon is still a demon. The trajectory of socialism and its brothers is a civil war of the classes, sundering apart tight-knit communities and families via needless struggle. Have we not read of Stalliongrad's bloody revolution, of the indiscriminate hanging of nobles on the flimsy grounds of their being nobles? The farmers' socialism Starry Night proclaims, idyllic on paper, will only falter in the face of a fast-industrialising reality, pitting sibling against sibling, neighbour against neighbour, until Vartai's very unifying identity crumbles under the weight of infinite squabbling classes.\n\n"And tell me, Lakeponies, how does Starry plan to treat the griffons? The genociders may be dead, but she extends amnesty to quails susceptible to griffon supremacy's poison. Reformisten remnants and radical knights will feign obedience until Starry and her confidants, blinded by socialism's naive ideals, find their backs peppered with knives!\n\n"We shall enforce peace in the frontier, make clear to the current government that we shall keep them safe from the griffon threat without and the socialist discord within. Under our hoof, Vartai shall no longer be divided—by species or by class—for both worker and industrialist shall join hooves against the griffon threat!""

LCT_six_lords.6.t_4: "Equal in Death" 
LCT_six_lords.6.d_4: ""I've spoken long enough about the terrors of the Reformisten,"  Westerly proclaimed at the very border of Jezeragrad, the gates flanked by a field of guns and cannons, "but our more immediate threat, Golden Morning and his idea-possessed followers, arm their words not with venom but honey. They claim to follow our ideals of a frontier without the spirit of slaughter.\n\n"But in his striving for that ideal, he fails to ground it in reality, instead founding a New Griffonia where ponies and griffons must be equal against their will! He does not vet said griffons for their pure hearts, does not cleanse them of the Herzland's toxin; he mashes both species together, like a hammer against a dozen nails, with blank forgiveness for all but the most heinous of leaders! What justice is that? What equality is that but an unsustainable bedlam? It is only a different face of griffon supremacy—for griffon genociders to get away with mass murders, while innocent ponies reap persecution for being too shy before a beak!\n\n"Golden Morning, therefore, cannot be negotiated with in good faith. By rifle and cannon, we shall rid this radical of his Herzland-infested mindset and save Vartai from its last griffon-hearted ruler. Vartai will only rest when we extract justice from every griff responsible and thoroughly wipe out the griffon threat in its totality!""

"Does he not see anything beyond the red mist of revenge?"\n\n"Surely, he could be valuable to us," Flaming suggested. "Give him enough guns to soften the Herzland for us in the near future. I can go there myself, actually—"\n\n"Have you not read his own speeches, heard what they say behind his back?" asked Westerly. "He seeks to burn Griffenheim and all of the Herzland into ash. The moment the rest of Griffonia learns of that, what then? After decimating Povner for good, every surviving griffon nation shall turn their sights on us and the rest of the River Coalition so the likes of him can never rise again! Do you understand me, Mister Flaming Hot? How this lunatic will drag us into a war we can't win?"\n\nThe other Lords, stunned silent, turned to Flaming. His ears turned down, wordless.\n\nWesterly's cough broke the cold feeling. "I apologise for that, but I've kept enough updates on the situation in Vartai to ascertain the... entity... this Povner is. No compromise of the sort shall be entertained, lest his stupidity has the landmass clamouring for our heads."\n\nWith that, Westerly stormed out of the carriage."

The woods afforded much cover and her mane matched the barks' colours, but Reformisten griffons took pride in being apex predators. She held on to images of family she'd saved from the house fire. She clutched a rifle she'd never fired in her life, counting the steps the griffon patrol made on untouched soil.\n\nBut a noise from the griffons' radios later, they flew away.\n\nExcited whispers from deeper in the shack echoed right after. Somepony was talking; everypony else was assured. They zeroed in on the right frequency; the photograhper and her comrades tuned in:\n\n"...but as Vartai has fallen under the boots of the skull-wielding Reformisten, the responsibility to shine as a beacon of liberty now falls upon us! All you honourable warriors, revitalised by the blood of Blessed Sword and his worthy successors, will tear the Imperial savages out of the homes they've raided, to answer for every single widow and orphan they've made to pay for the bloody ideal of griffon supremacy!\n\n"To those in Vartai who can hear me, know this!

The sight of worn down ghettos had him slackjawed. Even those with significant prior partisan help had decomposed into worse states than that of his own humble hometown. Tin roofs, unevenly stacked floors, muddy markings that shouldn't be called roads, putrid stinks across thinning fields of wilted crops.\n\nThe Vartai villagers' cautious curiosity then turned to relief when the soldiers unpacked food sacks and a squad carried materials to repair and plow.\n\nIt was a space of unity, dare he'd say "harmony". Rewarding the soldiers with Daring and Smoke for their boundless loyalty and strength in victory was for later. For now, it was time to rebuild and refocus: griffon leadership must still be dealt with; bread and proper homes were only bandages slapped on top of a deeper wound. Under the Lake Army's military command, reconstruction here would go well.\n\nReconstruction and rearmament. The knightly orders and the Reformisten were borne of a wicked Herzlander hen, after all."

The Lakeish forces had been helping, but the stealing away of neighbours to work camps, the random hangings of friends in broad daylight, the mass of "purified" griffons chanting for their extinction...\n\nA mother, taken away, executed in the mad count's own mansion for his amusement.

Companions, given lashes, pushed to the side, shot to pieces just so somegriff would turn them into changelings, holes in their legs and all.\n\nThe last straw: the inferno that ravaged her home; the griffon arsonists, caught fleeing but let go by the judge.

A few signatures; Caldera's own cutie mark stamped on it. She'd been called up.\n\nShe took a slow, chilly breath. All that was left to do was to be assessed by the clerks at the local conscription centre and see where she'd be placed: patrol duty in Vartai, or immediate training for the Herzland invasion force.\n\nDressed with a ceremonial robe at her mother's insistence, she exited her home. Lights turned on in her sleepy town under the soon-to-be twilight; she wasn't this morning's only conscript.\n\nShe heard scrapes, echoes of yelling. It was somepony young just like her, begging to stay home, to sleep a little longer.

"The pre-Boreas statuettes can go upwards of twenty thousand with Smoke’s network of archaeologists. Rumare’s runes can be offered back to the barony for a hefty sum..."\n\nAcross Vartai, Westerly and the other Lords ransacked every knightly estate, noble castle, and stocked-up armory of the griffon leadership, though most were not as exact as Westerly, with Flaming content to haul a count’s belongings in wagons for a non-stop trip to Lake City.\n\nBack in Westerly’s office in Jezeragrad, after raucous parades where loot had been thrown to the adoring population, Daring let go of her magical grip and the sack emptied of its valuables: gems, jewelry, heirlooms, and personal weapons (which Smoke laid claim on), along with the clanking of thousands of idols spilling out to a desk now creaking at the weight.\n\nAs the flow of idols gathered in Star’s hooves, a strange joy (or the booze) crept up. Flaming crowed about how he’d wear much of his jewelry to put Equestrian royalty to shame, and Solid said he’d have enough to reinvest into sturdier walls and forts on the front. On top of that, Daring was already scribbling approximations on how much wealth the whole Herzland would give them, if Vartai’s monetary harvest had already given this much.\n\nBut it was only then Star realized that Westerly hadn’t come back from his bathroom break.\n\nThe next morning, she’d learn that Westerly was still alive. And that he had spent the night discreetly visiting the shrines. The more humble Lakeponies had delivered the loot to their Ponikami as an offering and a welcome addition to the spirits’ earthly vessels."

LCT_six_lords.13.t: "Blessed Sword's Ambition" #everthing was better in the old days
LCT_six_lords.13.d: "Deep in Shayrmia, a bronze statue of Blessed Sword as high as pine trees towered over its visitors. His immortal image waved his famous longsword that'd slain over a thousand griffons.\n\nAt its base, a kiosk had established itself, selling limited edition books detailing Blessed Sword's life and conquests. Beside them, hoofbooks were also on sale, exhorting the reader to follow Put Vojnika or The Soldier's Way and all its virtues. The line stretched for half a kilometer, with patriotic marching music cracking out of the radios.\n\nAmid the festive atmosphere, Star and Westerly stood in line; the other four Lords had reserved their own book copies for delivery. The present Lords got nods and good wishes from the other visitors; they replied with hoofshakes and warm regards for loved ones who'd been spirited away to war.\n\nOnce the two got their books, they retreated to a park spruced up by Earth pony-grown cherry blossoms and the tinkling of artificial creeks. Shrines bloomed forth; fortune tellers predicted good omens for the future conflict with the Herzland. All of these, said a tour guide, were arranged according to first-century standards.\n\nThen, at the back of the park lay exhibits of the Službuniti, the River Empire's medieval military caste, purported to be the true ancestors to Nimbusia's armed citizen class. Names of these time-honoured Službuniti were emblazoned upon plates that also relayed tales of their heroic deeds. Foals pulled their parents to the statues, exclaiming how "cool" they looked and how "awesome" it must've been to be one of these super-warriors.\n\n"Blessed Sword would be so proud to see us returning to his ways," Star said. "Don't you agree?"\n\nWesterly's gaze had fixed itself upon the tallest armour. The sword it wielded pierced through a facsimile of a griffon's beak, its tongue sticking out. Bloodlessly.\n\nA pondering Westerly did not answer before they left for lunch."

LCT_six_lords.14.t: "Learn This and the War is Won" #everything is going just great, nothing can stop us now
LCT_six_lords.14.d: "When Westerly was invited by Star and Flaming to take a little nationwide trip visiting a couple schools, he accepted it as a break from the drudgery of commanding.\n\nThe first stop was a tiny farming village.\n\nA bungalow of wood and straw proudly reclined on a hill. The foals wore wooden sandals, not proper shoes or boots, clanking against the floor as they performed their drills, carrying sticks that substituted for rifles.\n\nTheir order-barking "sergeant" was propped up by wheels, her hindlegs amputated. Her voice was shrill and raspy, even when she moralised about the Soldier's Path and its virtues in between orders. Eyes front, present arms...\n\nOnce the drill was done, she wheeled herself to a student at the front, her tears welling up. "You and your classmates would do us proud, serving Lakeponies in the future. Maybe not in this war but surely in another to come, your descendants will thank you for your sacrifice and the good life you'll be giving them with your own... just as I have with two of my own legs."\n\nThe class erupted in applause, and when the stomping simmered down, they shelled her with questions about her own service, about the time wicked beaks held her up and would've taken her sacred life were it not for her determination and skill. She said that when the army calls her up once more, she would wheel herself to the front and shoot the griffs down from the sky—by their legs, when she can.\n\nWhen the hour ended, Star and Flaming thanked the teacher for her dedication to raise up the next generation of champions."

LCT_six_lords.15.d: ""The Lake Army plays a grand role in ponykind's struggle against the griffons!" boomed Westerly, shaking the podium in the Skupština  Representatives' Hall.\n\nCitizen-soldiers from all over had filed into the spacious room of ornate wood. No corrupt politicians stood here; only honourable warriors stood.\n\n"In the Herzland, every griff knows and believes nothing on their own, any striving for co-prosperity stymied by the honeyed deceptions of the Empire and its slaves! We shall cut this tree—this weed—at the root, and—"\n\n"You are the weed, you are the blight! For griffonkind!"\n\nFlames fell upon Westerly, catching the podium and his face.\n\nThe resulting stampede trampled the griffon infiltrator, beaten to death while soldiers ordered all to remain calm as they extinguished the molotov cocktail.\n\nHis face burned in half, a writhing Westerly was rushed into an ambulance. While the other Lords did damage control, vilifying griffonkind's savagery before their newfound audience, Star stayed by his side in the rocking vehicle, praying to a little shaking shrine.\n\nThe next day, a private funeral was held."

He found the irony in a defense specialist being the farthest in the front right now, waiting for the order.\n\n"Hey," a voice called; it was Star's. "Everyone's here."\n\nBottles popped open. Smoke called the soldiers stationed here "lucky" to be graced with the Lords' presence. A light drinking party commenced, not like the coup-fueled boozefest of months ago.\n\nThere was much to write home about. Tanks and special forces had paraded all across Lake City and Vartai; Flaming's last batch of ambassador visitors left with smiles and compliments; Smoke and Daring gushed over their battle plans and the numbers of guns posted through the frontline; Big Money reported matter-of-factly that his production lines could be sustained at historic highs for several years.\n\nSolid drew himself up on a rifle to peer through the bunker's viewpoint. No one yet, not from this angle. But he did appreciate good Earth pony-enchanted ground when he saw it.\n\nHe and the other Lords had dreamed of it for so long, their prize beyond the horizon: The Herzland, the Imperials, Griffenheim itself: the seat of ponykind's sacrilege. They would swoop in like six Blessed Swords, transcend him by the shattering of a thousand beaks, wings, and claws.\n\nOnly the blood of murderers could fertilise the Lords' soil, for ponykind and their children."

LCT_six_lords.17.d: "The pale of twilight fell upon those hastily marshaled at the buzzing Jezeragrad Harbor. The sun’s rays would soon hit the lake, reflecting its many lights bobbing along the surface like pearls.\n\nThe sun did rise with the rolling out of the steel titan: the flagship BP Jezeragrad. Over a dozen barrels stuck out from both ends its ends, showing off enough naval guns to flatten a continent, flanked by a bevy of AA and machine guns capable of downing entire air forces, all undergirded by arc-welded armor plates that stretched several inches thick, rendering the leviathan nigh unsinkable.\n\nThe Lords themselves sat in attendance, front and center. They cheered and whooped; the guests in the previous row couldn’t hear their own whispers. Then, Star Talent was asked by its admiral to sing an ancient ballad of the seas that preceded even Blessed Sword’s time. Everyone rose to sing along, though a few could be found merely mouthing the lyrics.\n\nThe ceremony ended when Smoke Signal swung down the ceremonial axe to cut off a piece of rope, the only thing holding the ship hostage in the air. BP Jezeragrad fell to its side before righting itself up, sending tremors across the lake. The Lords screamed to the air, high-hoofing each other and congratulating the officers and workers who engineered this miracle, claiming that it will patrol the Lake’s future oceans as its greatest guardian.\n\nThe rest of the audience—save for one madmare who didn’t understand etiquette and excitedly vowed to "marry me, BP!"—stomped the floor in tepid applause."

LCT_six_lords.18.d: "In the private room of a high-class restaurant, the Lords met with Dirty, sipping brandy over fragrant spiced cakes. After the greetings and pleasantries, Deeds started, "It's nice that you reward my continuous donations with a good meal."\n\n"Yes, you've been... generous to us," Star said, "so you're welcome." Then, she leaned in. "Yet there is one more gift we lack. Only then can we leave you alone."\n\nHis face soured. "If I were president, perhaps things would've been different." He arched a brow. "Maybe I could've been a Lord, hm?"\n\nWhen all he got from the Lords were cold expressions, he tapped the table, and in marched a young stallion, with combed and gelled mane. His smile was infectious, at least to Deeds.\n\n"This is Big Money, my son," Deeds said with a flourish. "A young and fresh face, shining with the promise of an illustrious career. I'll be in an advisory role in my conglomerate to train him in everything business, and you shall teach him in everything military. Make him your equal or get him to do your bidding... just keep him safe. I promise I will cause you no trouble; that's all I can offer."\n\nHis son performed a salute, that grin still stuck on his muzzle. "Big Money here, reporting for duty!"\n\nStar resisted the urge to slap a hoof to her face. No one could replace Westerly, but he knew the economy, had a hoof in a hoofful of booming enterprises, and otherwise had influence with the Cehovi's fledgling successors.\n\nA buffoon like Big Money was better than an empty seat in the war room."

A morbid curiosity grabbed him by the withers: nobility, knights, and the like would be marching down the streets. From what he'd heard, they already faced well-deserved abuse on the way here: from soldiers jeering at them in Griffenheim, through Vartai's Posniaks claiming that Boreas abandoned his own creation, to the western Lakeish villages where those who practiced Ponikami planted arrows and spikes for the griffons to avoid (while their pony superiors simply trotted on the sidewalks).\n\nThen, they came.\n\nPreceded first by Lake Army's brass band, the scores of griffons came marching in chains and shackles, under the close watch of the other soldiers and the local police. Their grimy, tallowy feathers and reeked of dirt, dust, mud, blood. Their beaks had been worn down, and dozens of wings had patches of feathers missing. Bloodshot eyes were the norm; a few raised their heads beyond a pronounced bow.\n\nNotably, some bloodstained chains were empty.\n\nThe crowds hemmed Cobalt in as they cheered the army then reviled their living, breathing spoils. Cobalt joined in, waving his flag, almost toppling the fence protecting him from blunted beaks and claws."

Or even less. She forgot. Sometimes, they stayed; sometimes, they moved. Back and forth, back and forth. March, patrol, wait. March again.\n\nAt nights, she and her squad hunkered down with a radio. Anthems played, dramas aired, and Star Talent wished them good night, for the rising sun to bless them tomorrow.\n\nThis morning, that rising sun brought home a speech. Star was addressing the nation again, in Jezeragrad with the other Lords: Go join the army! Don't wait for the draft! Work as one! Until the job is done!\n\nA recruit, fresh from the train ride, found his place beside her. Caldera put on a rehearsed smile for the new arrival. "Ready to see action?"\n\nHe scratched the mane that stuck out of his helmet. "I don't know. They told me we've got lots of action done, so my friends got here before me months ago. They don't come or write back. They're not dead, I know, but they're here, maybe, doing... something." A sigh left his chest. "I hope it's something, 'cause it felt like nothing back home. Here I am now, though... hope I'll do something to the griffons."\n\nCaldera's welcoming disposition cracked. "Don't worry, we will.""

LCT_six_lords.21.t: "The Enemy Advances" #loosing Herzland war (LCT_the_enemy_advances)
LCT_six_lords.21.d: "The war fever from months ago had always been fleeting, Star knew. Now, the Herzland invasion had become the Herzlanders' invasion. The radio show and the newspapers hallowed the increasing casualties as war heroes; nothing was more honourable than to die for Jezeragrad while walking The Soldier's Way. But there was a stark difference between martyrdom and mass suicide.\n\nShe yearned to keep her eyes shut all the way to the train station. The sidewalk asked her questions—about glory, about food, about griffons, about missing sons and daughters. The other Lords' shouting match that greeted her when she arrived at the farthest military base made her long to pierce her ears, to block out any interrogation.\n\nWhen peace finally prevailed in the war room, Star cleared her throat. "It's unmistakable that things haven't gone according to plan."\n\n"Great sleuthing, Sherclop Hooves!" Money yelled, but his everyone else's glares doused his cocky attitude. "Okay, okay! You do the talking..."\n\nStar rolled her eyes. "Speaking of plans: Daring, any Plan B's?" After Daring levitated a paper stack of Plans B to Z, Star continued, "See, it's not too bad!"\n\n"Say that to the ponies back home asking for strikes and protests," Flaming replied.\n\n"Yer PR," a hung-over Smoke said. "Kiss a tall beau'ful mare, marry griffons, make this all go 'way."\n\n"Yeah, smart idea from the 'tall beautiful mare' who pointed a cannon at a dissident and told her to 'be positive'."\n\n"What about ordering the civilians to fortify their homes with sandbags?" Solid tried to say over the ensuing five-way argument; he could scarcely be heard. "That way, they'll know how secure our army is and—"\n\n"Quiet!"\n\nAnd their rambling blame game crashed to a halt.\n\nStar rubbed her eyes.

Hyper-detailed feathers and beaks, in sets of six, dismembered the brain stew of an upside-down pony skull, sustained only by the the vomit of dark clouds, where devils' faces smouldered.\n\n"We know who they are," Star's solemn voice boomed from everywhere in the cinema. "The megalomaniacs are possessed by the evil spirits of the Herzland. They lump us ponies, a diverse set of creatures,  into a dangerous sum simply because we are different! Simply because we have land that they do not."\n\nThe next blasphemy was burning the flag of Lake City, with the Grovers and countless generic griffon subjects devouring it, bleeding the fabric dry as real blood flowed into the barren soil. No music played; only the crackle of flames tortured their ears.\n\n"How else could they have gotten this far into our sacred lands? Hatred has consumed them; the destructive spirits find them willing vessels! They find success only in the despisal's poison; they would rather exterminate every single one of us than face a noble death themselves!"\n\nBefore half the film's runtime was done, many eyes broke down crying, hooves renewed their allegiance to Lake City.

Blindfolded, tied up, beaks cracked. The ringleader's had been cut in half, exposing the flesh that had rotted over the past twelve hours.\n\n"We don't know a single thing about smuggling! We're just peasants!"\n\n"Sure, you and your peasant gangsters." Flaming said, his voice barely heard amid the din of the crowd. "You've been charged with high treason. Which is to be expected from your kind, but the spirits find a way to surprise the living."\n\nThe firing squad had been let in. "You griffons waved the white flag but it wasn't for a holy cause; it's so you can save your own hide. The moment we stopped watching you, what happens? Sabotage, espionage, aiding the enemy just enough to sow doubt among these proud ponies."\n\n"I swear, we've done nothing!" the ringleader yelled. He tried to yell more, but an acidic retch came out.\n\nThe guards raised their rifles; the mob cried out for blood.\n\n"You haven't cared for your fellow creatures, your fellow ponies who lived right next door, even when we gave you mercy. That's how you sniveling gluttons are, always looking out for your own selves... and so we'll cleanse Vartai from this filth.""

It helped that, this time, she never had to lie: with a solid foothold in the now former lands of the Empire, exaggeration had turned obsolete.\n\nBanners flew from houses blaring out the station’s curated recordings of the army’s field band. Trotting out on Jezeragrad’s ancient streets, Star was warmly greeted by fellow citizens who saluted her with newspapers showing off images of their latest victory: Lakeponies had stood tall in the night, hind hooves nailing down a bloodied griffon while the orange glimmers of a Herzlander base on fire lit up his fallen rifle.\n\nA train trip later to the frontlines, she found most of the Lords eagerly waiting for her. "Where’s Money?"\n\n"Playing taskmaster at a factory," Solid replied as the rest escorted her to a nearby base. "He is a coward, not coming here while we push forward with real progress."\n\nDaring laid a hoof on Star’s withers. "At this rate, if we follow the plan, we’ll be in Feathisia in a week!"\n\n"Just another opportunity to pound more beaks into submission," Smoke quipped, drifting like in a daydream. "It truly is a beauty, seeing the flames..."\n\n"And after that, you can see me," Flaming said, sidling up to Smoke’s wings. "Having studied Feathisian alcohol to a great extent, I believe a jenever would be suitable for us?"\n\nSolid’s chuckle distracted Star from the ensuing three-way argument.\n\nThe outside world, past the rumbling of tanks and planes, got her notice by the marching and singing of a new battalion in tune. A truck then wheeled in; she could overhear chatter about how many griffon helmets and medals they’d collect today.

Great thinking."\n\n"Are you calling my strategies foolish?"\n\n"Enough," said an exasperated Star; that got their attention. "Solid, where's Big Money? Company factory? Figures."

Her sight followed the river as it wound past noble mansions, old restaurants and granaries, marble statues and bronze monuments: the centuries' end-result of griffon culture, the jewel of Griffonia, the nexus of Imperial madness, Griffenheim itself, now under a Lakeish flag.\n\n"Come on!" It was Flaming who caught up to her on the balcony. "You've got to see the ballroom!"\n\nShe was pulled by the hoof, a starry view in exchange for a ballroom lazing about in a secluded part of the Imperial Palace. No orchestra played softly for a waltz; a bunch of table-smackers and Equestrian choir rejects belted out ballads while dozens danced to their erratic beat.\n\nStar could spot the other Lords who hadn't retired for the night: Smoke, who sat at a bar drinking the night away, and Big Money who lounged beside her. Past the happy chaos, Flaming led her there. "Hey, why don't you loosen up? Might as well get in some fun before we start the real work."\n\nBig Money loudly ordered for a little martini; a drunken Smoke lucidly passed it on to Star. "You... argh, desurf it... deserve!

Big Money said as he stood, smiling and waving by a paper-maiche mock-up of a caricatured griffon corpse. The spray of Aquilean champagne from a rooftop hit him square in the face; he almost didn't restrain his tongue at the exuberant celebrant.\n\n"If you think that's crazy," Flaming said, also waving to the crowd, "you should check the mares on the back!" Back there, Daring kept shooting magical beams into the air like a sapient spotlight, unable to remove the insane grin stuck on her muzzle, while Smoke kept mouthing "boom!" and pulling the rope on the empty artillery she was leading.\n\nWhen the Lords turned the corner, the roaring throng flooded Money's ears. "Jezeragrad can't hold a candle to this!" \n\nWhich prompted Flaming to pull Money to the side, discreetly whispering, "That's because we're rubbing it in their faces.

The Imperial Palace was blocks away, but his razor-sharp eyes helped him discern the unholy desecration taking place there. Paintings and jewelry were carted out en masse, crowns and fabrics transported out of the gates. Imported goods from Equus and Zebrica lay together in common sacks and rags, to be used by savages who knew no better. Religious scripture and relics were not exempt from their theft; he could only pray that Boreas would not burn the city while he was still in it.\n\nThe pounding grew louder.\n\nThe thought of flying had been killed when he injured his wings not in an attempt to hide from the ponies storming his home. He could imagine why they took so long getting to his room: commissioned paintings of his ancestors from five hundred years ago, swords and shield preserved through the ages, genealogical tomes that would be ripped apart or sold in the black market for petty cash—they were precious loot that couldn't be missed.\n\nThey yelled at the door, screaming his name.\n\nTo jump out the window and try to fly was a death sentence, and suicide would be a bleak full stop to the dynasty he should've held. But at the very least, he could stand before the barbarians as a noble, as a count.\n\nNot a count in title, but a count in heart.\n\nThe door opened: the left hoof wielded a sack of gold; the right, a gun."

They were the last to see the ancient map resting alone on the table, labeled in unreadable Herzlandish. Daring pumped her chest, claiming that she'd brought it from the Imperial Palace itself.\n\nSolid had declined taking any part of the Herzland, citing the need for Jezeragrad and Vartai to be protected by its most competent defender.\n\nAn eager Daring levitated the marker to draw a curve parallel to the northern border. "Imagine all the wargaming we could have there! The north's full of vicious foes we could fight a dozen times over!"\n\nSmoke, in her drunken stupor, did the same halfway through the south before her marker slipped off the table, leaving a red line across its surface. Her mumblings translated to "guns... birds..."\n\nFlaming pointed at the Herzland's southeast. "Heard the angry river and the catering got histories, and look at that! They're beautiful!" Ignoring Star's words of concerns about Angriver and Katerin's current conditions, Flaming won the rest of the Lords over his lot.\n\n"Say," Money said, gently putting Star's hoof over Griffenheim, "why don't you control the capital? It's already well developed. I'd rather have my work done in places that need improvement! That'd be a real accomplishment!"

Many government officials, being soldiers themselves, had been called up for the holy war, and their replacements couldn't light a candle to their administrative skill. That, combined with Big Money increasing production quotas even higher to keep the Empire's new gains from collapsing, the results showed themselves.\n\n"This is too much, Solid," said Iron Gate, the Žandarmerija's commander as he drove the Lord around in Jezeragrad. "Military cooperation can only get you far. We've got more houses than police here, and those trucks—hey, shut up!"\n\nSaid truck cut him off at an intersection, shouting drivel through loudspeakers and words painted on its body. They asked for proper compensation for workers and for their sons and daughters to come home.\n\n"My guys this morning arrested a factory arsonist; she said she couldn't rest after eighteen hours at the conveyor belt. And don't get me started about the shrines. We've got truants getting inside, pretending to be all prayerful when they're just having secret meetings and discourse. That's how communists are born!"\n\nSolid coughed. "And this has been happening everywhere, you say?"\n\n"Yes. Vartai has it worse because the enforcers aren't locals, Posniaks, the like.

LCT_six_lords.34.d: "The doors of a Palace office slammed open, precipitated by the thunderous steps of petty nobles crushing themselves into the room before straightening their postures.\n\nTheir representative, a count from what used to be Katerin, stormed straight to the desk. The Katerin count asked for an explanation from Star Talent. Star asked him why the royals didn't ask for her friends instead who stood on equal hoofing such as Solid and Smoke. That was dismissed as hogwash: Star was the sanest pony among them, not mentally unhinged or just plain unfit for the position.\n\nStar took the floor: Why were the nobles here? Katerin answered that they had heard about the new partitioning of the Herzland, that it was unacceptable. So said he, the lines had no respect for history, for ethnic boundaries, for culture groups or languages, not even for species as Bronzehill's dogs were divided up without thought. The whole of it was nonsense, an overtly malicious and short-sighted landgrab.\n\nStar asked why were the nobles here again. Katerin told her that, surely, as the most reasonable Lord of the six, she could bring reason back to their senses. It would certainly be easier to rule lands of a common culture, a common language, a common group of any kind—\n\nHis eyes met the barrel of her pistol.\n\nThe nobles' terrified exclamations were silenced by Star's last words: "Do. Not. Cross. Me."\n\nSo they fled.\n\nAn order was transmitted over radio from her office, and the Palace lit up in gunfire. The only blood that poured through its gilded halls was blue blood."

The squawking griffon that once graced its face had been erased.\n\nStreets that once teemed with proud griffons now lay sick with the overflow of pony occupiers in fatigues and helmets. Newly erected speaker towers gave them little shelter from the rising sun, emitting static before the Lords’ next speech, to be broadcast not from The Imperial Palace but from beneath the hallowed arches and stained-glass windows of the Grand Temple of Boreas.\n\nAt the pulpit fitted with a mountain of microphones, Flaming Hot, flanked by the other Lords in their cleanest uniforms, tapped the mikes. Before him sat a pony congregation griffons would term "irreverent," milling about with their rifles; those who couldn’t sit on the pews rested on their helmets, hearts stirred to swear their allegiance to the new flag hanging behind the preacher.\n\n"The Lakepony’s soul is the path of the soldier, laid out for us by the Ponikami! Wielding the sword on this divine path led Blessed Sword and his generation to the peak of virtue, cleansed from weakness by handling death and life!\n\n"But the griffons who’ve tormented us can never find honour in the sword. They speak of the holy war god Arcturius, but senseless hatred and bloodlust against innocent ponies is the result. If Arcturius is so dishonourable, then he is no god worthy of worship.\n\n"The spirits of the lake and the world, however, do sanctify us against the beaked monsters! To you, holy heroes, I say we are no longer of the lake alone. No! We are born out of our devotion to the Ponikami and their soldier’s path. Today, I speak into existence the Holy Pony Empire!

LCT_six_lords.36.d: "Swimming through murky water. It’s all Flaming could feel in the past hour, that faint recognition that he lay in a blinding white hospital, trapped in a patient’s bed.\n\nA familiar blur had sat by his side, coalescing into Solid Rocks as Flaming’s vision cleared. Solid’s words felt cloudy, but he could comprehend their gist: fortunate to survive a bullet close to the lungs, troops detained the griffon for a work camp assignment, Star and Money working overtime to placate the panic of a trigger-happy populace.\n\nSolid took out a letter. Said it was bad news.\n\nFlaming yanked it, ripped the envelope open.\n\n"COLTSTREAM" rested on the top, accompanied by the insignia of every treaty member. The title read, "THE EXPULSION OF THE HOLY PONY EMPIRE (FORMERLY KNOWN AS LAKE CITY) FROM THE RIVER COALITION".\n\n"Should’ve seen that coming." Solid’s speech rang more sober now. "’Against the alliance’s defensive nature’, ‘in breach of upholding peace in the region’... these restrictions are no longer necessary. Talkative Rijekans are already spreading the news, but that will only embolden the army here. We can hold our own as an independent state thanks to you and your bluster."\n\nFlaming’s heart only sunk. His eyes fluttered.\n\n"You budala, you’re our ambassador! We’ll have the upper hoof if you strike a deal with the Coalition, exact tribute from them in exchange for our troops, keep the other griffons in the dark until after we raid their homes—"\n\n"Let me sleep!"\n\nSo the diplomat turned, covering part of his face with his pillow, an avian spectre waiting at the door of his dreams.\n\nAfter two minutes, Solid took the letter out of Flaming’s hooves and left the room."

Developments bothered him thanks to Solid’s updates: Money’s reports of griffon mobilisation, Smoke’s talk of soldiers restless for more than garrison duty, and Star’s account of a resistance leader’s warning to "repent, lest Arcturius rush to Boreas’ aid with blades of thunder!"\n\nThe door slammed open, bringing in the only Lord who hadn’t visited Flaming yet.\n\nA grinning Daring said levitated a stack of letters, a dizzying mix of materials, sizes, and languages. "For convenience’s sake, I made this map of all the nations involved."\n\nThe other Lords grew bewildered looks. Flaming sat up in his bed. "Involved in what?"\n\n"You’ll find out." She floated her map to him.\n\nFlaming’s eyes narrowed as he read "the Holy Pony Empire’s belligerents" above the map. The tiny pointed-out Romau and Rumare left him unprepared for Kemerskai’s martial clique joining claws with Vedina’s knights. The revolutionarily experienced Aquileans made him quiver; the Wingbardians and the rest of Karthinia had him fidget. Affluent trading hubs like Skyfall gave him cause to yelp, especially when the merchants had teamed up with bandits and mercenaries from the north and south. His hooves shook upon the divided Prywhen and Verenia, the free-range Cossacks, and the followers of Sycaecia swearing an oath for Griffenheim. Finally, the rest of the list, though minor principalities, shocked his senses by the sheer griffonpower they could brag of and swarm the Empire with.\n\n"Harmonists, tyrants, communists, thieves, priests, republicans, industrialists... Flaming, it’s easier to list who we won’t fight."\n\n"H-How?" he sputtered, trembling. "How did they... why now?! Why everyone?!"\n\nHis perception fractured as the Lords burst into bickering, but one thing was clear: Arcturius had blasted his trumpet against the Ponikami."

Luck was with some, piecing families back together; tragedy broke others. Still, these were new lands for a new future: a dead spouse led to another marriage; dead friends led to new acquaintances. The Herzland was a land packed with opportunity for all except the winged natives who read the papers in fear of their overlords' whims.\n\nOn fields of gold and silver, the Palace lit up in more booze and music. A scant amount was left for the looting, so the conquerors contented themselves with a slower dance. The Lords shook hooves and pulled each other into games and singing, drinking the night away while awkwardly asking soldiers to join in their revelry.\n\nThe Herzland of morality's and divinity's runt had once been no more, but now..."

A logistical challenge, but challenges were meant to be overcome.\n\nHer mind raced to find the best strategies in capturing points of interest across the landscape then defending them before the next phase of her hypothetical attack. If it were solely up to her, she'd spend the rest of her life planning this out with her majors and colonels, in pursuit of the endless puzzles that warfare posed to her.\n\nBut warfare wasn't the only thing ponies breathed. In the territory of the Northern Occupation Righteous Forces, they still needed a stable government.\n\nSo she planned out a week-long tour through her lands, starting out with learning civilian economics from thrifty Bronzehill diamond dogs, then coming down to her strip of Strawberry where wine was served, and good talk was had with the local pony delegates as griffon musicians played in the background for pay. She capped off her trip by the sea, spending the weekend in Rottendedam by immersing her mind in the soft sounds of water rippling from her boat through the canals, all rowed by griffons under threat of execution.\n\nIt all ended with a relaxing game of chess with her confidants, drinking shots of delicious local alcohol. They laughed like crazy in the balcony over every upset, every outstanding move.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, several griffons watched from below that and the pegasus soldiers guarding the roof, fearful of their new sovereign, the mad strategist."

LCT_six_lords.41.d: "It'd been agreed upon that Star would lead the precious Imperial core of the heartlands, propped up by the innovative erudites of Yale and the hard-working diamond dogs of Bronzehill.\n\nBut concrete reasons lay behind the other Lords' eagerness to hoof such a treasure away: occupying Griffenheim for this long was still a blasphemy, a black mark that any pro-griffon movement would use to stir up violent support; Yale's scholars, in pursuit of progress, asked too many questions, a dangerous prerequisite for revolution; and finally, the adage would prove true that diamond dogs were a griffon's best friend—Bronzehill's stated loyalty to the Grovers could not be ignored when a usurper sat on the throne.\n\nBut she steeled her hoof. Nothing came easy, especially with having gone this far in trampling the Imperial threat once and for all, for the safety and freedom of ponykind.\n\nIt would be as ambitious as counting the stars.\n\nSo she took the microphone, the rush of the murmuring crowd before her coming back to her senses. She humbly stood at street level, right before the Palace's gates. While a great many ponies were in attendance, she found more than a few griffons listening in, their looks inscrutable for now.\n\nHer speech thus began, hopefully assuring her audience that the aspirations of the nation of Star Counter weren't empty promises."

LCT_six_lords.42.d: "Upon leaving the esteemed Imperial core, the difference was like time-traveling to the past: sturdy stone roads became muddy dirt paths, gallant and landed aristocrats made way for rugged farmers plowing the fields, and the scent of flowers died to a stench wafting its way into Flaming's nose. The high speed of his car trip couldn't chase the foul odour away.\n\n"Where are we?!" Flaming shouted at his driver. "We must've crossed the border to Griffonstone!"\n\n"No, this is it," said his driver calmly. "This is Katerin. Angriver's just further down. It's slightly better from what I've heard."\n\n"What do you mean 'slightly'? I thought... I thought Katerin and Angriver were historically significant locations!"\n\n"I've sacked better 'historically significant locations', sir," he said with a chuckle.\n\nHis entrance into Katerinburg only soured his first impressions. The stink of the marshes and the sewers (in the rare parts that had them) attacked his nose and made him puke; hastily reconstructed houses and stores looked more like rushed encampments than real livable buildings, thanks to the mad princess's ill-advised relocation of the entire city. The castle and palace, now his new base of operations with its imperious cleanliness, only provided a small relief.\n\nBut as those stately walls hid the outside world from view, he couldn't shake the feeling that he ruled over nothing but dregs."

LCT_six_lords.43.d: ""Fire!"\n\nA hundred howitzers rang out in song, filling the air with sputtering peals, firing at the command of a whiskey-drinking Smoke.\n\nShe'd had it good for the past few weeks. That her territory was one of the smaller ones didn't matter; it gave her less time to deal with the administrative grind, and more time to arm the nation with coercive "instruments of persuasion."\n\nHer civil servants eventually convinced her to stop firing shells into the river, so she moved on through captured towns and newly established military outposts, inspecting their arsenals along the way. Each loyal soldier she met could handle and maintain their rifle well; it pleased her that both young and old could operate a tank or coordinate to land a shell on target when called to it.\n\nAnd though the war had just ended, ponies were still lining up in recruitment centers. While Smoke initially resented "standing around and doing nothing but smile", she found herself with genuine joy and hope upon each pony who passed the standards then the test for conscription, even if they ended up in reserves. Belts in the religious style were made to commemorate each new private and sergeant, and come nightfall, a party was held to celebrate the high numbers of recruits. As was tradition, Smoke was first and last in line for drinks.\n\nWhile the griffons living in her territory fear whatever she would do next—rumors abounded that she'd build a black site where her researchers would devise unheard-of weapons of mass destruction—that was all overblown and hypothetical.\n\nFor now, there were howitzers to fire and soldiers to hire. And maybe an enemy to fire them on in the mire."

"Steel mills here in just a few months' time. Or weeks! You'll be building New Manehattan right here in no time!"\n\n"Sir, there's already a New Manehattan in New Mareland."\n\n"We'll call it New New Manehattan! That'll show them!"\n\nSupervising the work was surprisingly relaxing for once, a world of difference from his days in Vartai and Lake City as the benevolent dictator of manufacturing. Today, he got his reports from across his holdings via letter, putting to reality his plans for the rest of the region, that his entire chunk of land could be just like Manehattan every square meter of the way. It would be a haven for pony entrepreneurs disillusioned with the old money in Griffonia's other pony nations. And for arms dealers with their lucrative trade.\n\nBut the urban centers had yielded to him the most valuable assets of them all. Sure, some of his co-Lords and many of his employees had rather unsavoury views on the griffons, but given the abundance of griffons in the work gangs for these steel mills alone, one thing was clear:\n\nThey offered good labour on the cheap."

After the ceremony, everyone left quickly; tomorrow would bring great responsibilities.\n\nWhen everyone else left, the Lords stood up from the chairs on the dais. Under the warm glow of the map's light, the creases on their forehads had grown sharper, and the bags under their eyes had dug deeper. But when they smiled, the burdens of the Empire lifted from their withers. "It's been an honour," one of them said. It didn't matter who said it or who started the hoofshakes that turned into hugs and promises of seeing each other in a grand reunion one day.\n\nAfterwards, they, too, left. Solid exited first, the only one take a train, heading back to Lake City. Daring drove Money and Smoke to their territories before she retired to her own. Flaming took off with one uneasy wink at Star before rounding a corner, never to be seen in Griffenheim for a time.\n\nStar Talent was then alone, turning off the map's light."

 # lake festival preparation event, can't host during wartime. Option text is placeholder
 lakecityflavor.1.t:0 "Lake Festival"
 lakecityflavor.1.d:0 "Every year, Ponies from across Lake City come together in Jezeragrad for the city's annual Lake Festival. The festival originally dates back to the reign of Blessed Sword who used the occasion as a chance to shore up the unification of the various tribes around Jezeragrad. Throughout the First Lake City Principality, this holiday was celebrated with a week of parades, banquets, tournaments, and ended with a massive boat race around Jezeragrad Harbour. The winner of this race would then become quite the celebrity and be granted a private audience with the reigning monarch.\n\nAfter the fall of the monarchy, the holiday continued to be celebrated annually in much the same way. Though one noticeable difference is that the winner of the boat race would receive an audience with the Grand Mayor, a key to the city of Jezeragrad, and a generous prize of gold and other treasures.\n\nIn the last fifty years however, the festival has been in steady decline as the city of Jezeragrad has been struggling to finance the opulent festivities which once marked the occasion. The week is now a weekend, the banquets reduced in grandeur, the parades are now mostly made up of military formations, and the boat race only attracts a few diehard participants.\n\nIt would greatly increase the morale of our nation if we were to provide this event with proper funding, financing a week of festivities which could rival those of Blessed Sword's reign."
 lakecityflavor.1.a:0 "Earmark some funding for this year's festivities."
 lakecityflavor.1.b:0 "Don't we have better things to finance?"
 lakecityflavor.1.c:0 "A valiant goal but maybe we should wait until after this war is over."
 
 # Lake festival celebration. Option text is placeholder
 lakecityflavor.2.t:0 "A Week of Grandeur"
 lakecityflavor.2.d:0 "Two million Ponies entered the city of Jezeragrad this week, coming from all corners of Lake City and the River Coalition, attracted by what promised to be the grandest Lake Festival in a lifetime.\n\nA pier had been constructed on the waterfront, with an Equestrian styled theme park built upon it. The rides, which most foals had only ever heard rumours of, had been imported from Manehattan and Canterlot and were opened for public use. It was reported that the line for the Ferris Wheel got so long that Ponies were spending upwards of four hours in the queues. Yet, not even this dampened the spirits of the families who came to witness this.\n\nEvery night was marked by banquets, with millions of tonnes of grains, fruit, ales, salt, and other food products pouring into the city in preparation. The weekend feasts featured foods from all across the globe, including Griffking rye, Zebrican coffee and chocolate, and peppers from the jungle of southern Equestria.\n\nThe Friday parade lasted six hours and included military units which were showered in flowers and cheers, floats sponsored by Lake City's guilds celebrating their technological innovation and products, and exhibits from all manner of organizations and foreign sponsors. One memorable float was that of New Mareland which had an intricate mural of flowers planted upon it which showed the cooperation between our two nations.\n\nLastly, there was the boat race, held on Saturday evening. Last year, this race included 30 ships. This year registration had to be stopped at 300, until pressure called for a second, and later third race to be created. The winners of each of these races then went into a three-way tiebreaker. Overall, the tournament was won by the Bluenose in a photo finish.\n\nAs Sunday rolled around, the train station, roads, and waters leading out of Jezeragrad were clogged with Ponies attempting to exit the city. The festival had been a success, greatly contributing to national morale and the perception of our republic to outside nations."
 lakecityflavor.2.a:0 "How will they ever top this?"
 
 # Lake festival cancelation. Option text is placeholder
 lakecityflavor.3.t:0 "The Last Lake Festival?"
 lakecityflavor.3.d:0 "Today, the Ponies of Jezeragrad were dismayed to learn that their annual Lake Festival had been cancelled, citing diminishing attendance and increasing costs as the main contributing factors. While private benefactors are scrambling to re-establish a smaller scale event, the hopes of ever seeing a proper revitalization look grim.\n\nYet, the public outcry against this cancellation has been largely muted, as it would seem that few Ponies are really caught up in the mysticism of this once grand tradition."
 lakecityflavor.3.a:0 "An end of an era."
 
 # reports of lost fishermen, can choose to start a search, or ignore it
 lakecityflavor.4.t:0 "Lost on the Lake"
 lakecityflavor.4.d:0 "The Neighin Maru is one of a hundred fishing vessels which prowl the freshwaters off of Jezeragrad in order to find Walleye, Salmon, and Pike for the city's denizens. The ship left port about a week ago and was supposed to return yesterday morning burdened with fish. However, that wasn't the case.\n\nInstead, the vessel has been reported missing with the last known transmission happening three days ago on the southernmost edge of the lake.\n\nWhile it's not uncommon for vessels to go missing, the Neighin Maru was carrying renown Lake City biologist, Case Study. Already, the press within Jezeragrad has picked up this story and have begun to publish it, creating a public outcry to find the ship and its crew.\n\nCaptain Greenpeace of the Lake City Coastguard has asked for our permission to use the organization's fleet to begin prowling the waters in an effort to find the ship. This endeavour would be extremely costly but to do otherwise would likely sentence these fishingponies to their doom."
 lakecityflavor.4.a:0 "Find Case Study and the Neighin Maru."
 lakecityflavor.4.b:0 "Prepare a state funeral for Case Study."
 
 # No results from the search
 lakecityflavor.5.t:0 "The Search Continues"
 lakecityflavor.5.d:0 "The search of the Neighin Maru, and famed biologist Case Study, continues as vessels of the Lake City Coastguard prowl the lake's waters. An effort had been made to begin the search at the sight of the last known transmission and then move outwards in larger and larger circles.\n\nSo far, this search has failed to find any trace of the ship and the morale for this mission has steadily diminished. The only good news is that while there is no sign of the ship, there is also no sign of wreckage or debris which hopefully means the ship remains in one piece.\n\nThe mission is also running into troubles in terms of funding as the constant running, maintenance, and crewing of coastguard vessels has become a costly endeavour. Hopefully this search ends soon, for better or worse."
 lakecityflavor.5.a:0 "Continue the search, we must find this ship."
 lakecityflavor.5.b:0 "This is getting far to costly, we need to end this now."

 # search payoff, lake city ponies are relieved
 lakecityflavor.6.t:0 "The Neighin Maru is Found"
 lakecityflavor.6.d:0 "At dawn, a patrol craft of the Lake City Coastguard stumbled upon a small beach atoll located fourteen kilometers north-east of the site of the Neighin Maru's last transmission. Upon circling to the northern shore of the island, the craft discovered the beached remains of the Neighin Maru left in impeccable condition.\n\nSeveral minutes later, a flare was launched from the atoll and the patrol craft landed. The crew of the Neighin Maru, including famed biologist Case Study, were all accounted for upon this island in good health.\n\nApparently, the Neighin Maru had hit a gathering of rocks while returning to port, which punctured the ship's hull and allowed water into the electrical systems. In an effort to save his crew, the captain had headed for the nearest landmass and beached his ship. Since then, the crew had been surviving upon the local vegetation of the island, lake water, and the hold full of salted Pike.\n\nIt is expected that the Neighin Maru's crew will be returned to Jezeragrad in the coming hours."
 lakecityflavor.6.a:0 "Some desperately needed good news."
 
 # guild dispute, choose between invervening or leaving the guilds to solve it themselves
 lakecityflavor.7.t:0 "Griffking River Guild Dispute"
 lakecityflavor.7.d:0 "The Svetigrad Grain Commission is Lake City's chief producer, importer, and supplier of staple crops such as rice, rye, barely, and wheat. They were founded in 903 as a government corporation to help control the instable price of grains during the Eastern Griffonian droughts of 899-905. In 961, this corporation was privatized by the Storm Wind administration.\n\nMeanwhile, Republican Fruits is Lake City's chief producer, importer, and supplier of fruits, including oranges, mangos, and the highly profitable apple trade. They were founded in 974 when the Trotshima Citrus Collective bought a majority share in the Mareji Apple Estate, unifying the two companies.\n\nRecently, these two guilds came into conflict over a 7 square kilometer stretch of land along the Griffking river, a highly profitable location which has extreme fertility and produces high yields of agricultural goods.\n\nAt first glance, both companies seem to have a very strong claim to the land and they have entered into what promises to be a lengthy legal dispute. However, such a battle would leave these highly profitable lands fallow. As such, maybe we should bring both parties to the table and attempt to broker a government backed deal."
 lakecityflavor.7.a:0 "It's in our best interest to end this legal dispute."
 lakecityflavor.7.b:0 "The government should not interfere in private affairs."

 lakecityflavor.8.t:0 "[LCT.GetLeader]'s Administration Brokers a Deal"
 lakecityflavor.8.d:0 "After days of fierce negotiations, the land dispute between the Svetigrad Grain Commission and Republican Fruits has been settled with assistance from the government.\n\nWhile bargaining initially hit a rocky start, it was swiftly corrected with the assistance of [LCT.GetLeader] who was able to guide the two rival legal teams onto a more productive train of thought. Afterwards, it was mostly smooth sailing with the occasional bit of formal assistance offered to help smooth over some of the finer details.\n\nThe deal eventually reached would see the lands sold to a neutral third party, and the profits divided between the two firms in a 60-40 split, in Republican Fruits favour. Already, a bidding war has erupted over the lands with two of Lake City's largest timber barons putting forward the most generous bids.\n\nThe press is celebrating this as the deal of the year and both corporations have seen modest increases in the value of their stocks (BGC – up 2.51%, RFT – up 3.04%)."

 lakecityflavor.9.d:0 "After days of fierce negotiations, the land dispute between the Svetigrad Grain Commission and Republic Fruits has been settled.\n\nThe initially bargaining was especially rocky as the two rival legal teams were practically at each others throats. The tension between the two firms was so intense that it was reported that guild-sponsored military formations had been mobilized. Thankfully, a deal was offered at the eleventh hour, and from there things seemed to progress in a far more civilized manner.\n\nThe deal would see the Svetigrad Grain Commission acquire the disputed lands in exchange for a soy plantation located several kilometers inland. This deal would benefit the two guilds equally as the river front property is ideal for a rice farm while the former soy fields are rich in nitrogen which will help foster a productive apple orchard.\n\nThe press is already celebrating this as the deal of the decade and both companies stocks experienced respectable showings in the Jezeragrad Stock Exchange (BGC - up 5.61%, RFT - up 7.12%)."

The tension between the two firms was so intense that it was reported that guild-sponsored military formations had been mobilized. Unfortunately, the threat of violence did not taper the hostility of the two legal teams.\n\nWithin an hour, the first act of violence was reported as a petrol bomb burst inside of a Republican Fruits warehouse, setting it ablaze. This was followed almost immediately by a platoon of Lake City soldiers stopping a convoy of Svetigrad Grain Commission trucks and requisitioning them for 'official' military purposes.\n\nThe first death was reported ten minutes later as a Republican Fruits security officer shot a Pony he assumed was a rival saboteur. This was not the case.\n\nImmediately after this incident, the Lake City army was called in to stabilize the situation.\n\nThe press is already calling this incident a disaster and it is expected that the legal battle which will follow will take years and cost both firms millions. In response, both companies took a massive hit in the Jezeragrad stock exchange. (BGL – down 15.23%, RFT – down 18.68)."

 lakecityflavor.13.t:0 "A Royal Birthday"
 lakecityflavor.13.d:0 "During the First Principality of Lake City, the birthday of the Grand Prince or Princess was a national holiday that the entire nation celebrated. Across the land parades were planned, patriotic decorations adorned buildings, and the gates of Hoofboka Palace were opened for the public, a rarity considering the private nature of the monarch.\n\nAt noon, the Grand Prince or Princess would then stand upon one of the palace's balconies, with their entire family, and address the public, thanking them for their well wishes and loyalty. This was then followed by a small speech.\n\nWhile Heavenly Snow has requested that his birthday not be celebrated, his senior advisors are attempting to consult him to do otherwise. This event could act as a much-needed morale boost for our Ponies as the celebrations would hopefully distract them from the worst of the restoration's growing pains."

Buildings, both private and public, have decked themselves out in bunting embroiled with the royal emblem and colours.\n\nIn Jezeragrad, a parade passed through the city, making sure to detour near the palace. It lasted for well over an hour as military units, troops of performers, floats, and flocks of loving citizens joined together to celebrate the Grand Prince's birthday.\n\nLater in the day, the gates of Hoofboka Palace were opened and crowds numbering in the tens of thousands swarmed through to catch a rare opportunity of the royal grounds and gardens. Then, at noon, the Grand Prince and his wife took their place upon a balcony, waving to the crowds.\n\nHeavenly Snow thanked his subjects for coming out to wish him a Happy Birthday, and appreciated their loyalty. He then gave a brief speech discussing the bright future ahead for Lake City and his ambitions for a utopian society."

However, they respected the wishes of their monarch and will make sure to keep their celebrations private.\n\nHowever, the Prince seemed relieved at not having his birthday turned into a national event. He thanked his generals, ministers, and advisors for their support of his decision before retreating to his quarters for a more personal birthday ceremony.\n\nThis event was attended by just himself, his wife, and a few personal friends."

 #### DECISIONS ####
 LCT_improve_industry:0 "Improve Industry"
 LCT_develop_civ_industry:0 "Grant Land to the Guilds"
 LCT_develop_civ_industry_desc:0 "A number of Lake City's guilds have expressed interest in purchasing tracts of publicly held lands. By consenting to this request, we'd see a boon to economic growth as fallow lands are converted into farms, mines, and various other enterprises."
 LCT_develop_mil_industry:0 "Buy Weapons from the Guilds"
 LCT_develop_mil_industry_desc:0 "Most of Lake City's military equipment is produced by private firms who are awarded government contracts. An expansion of these contracts would greatly increase the quantity of armaments at our disposal."
 LCT_farming_modernisation:0 "Farming Modernization"
 LCT_farming_modernisation_desc:0 "Like most of Eastern Griffona, Lake City's agricultural sector is severally out of date. By bringing in modern machinery, chemicals, and land use practices we would not only increase the quantity and quality of good, but all free up massive amounts of labour for industrializations."
 LCT_road_works:0 "National Road Network"
 LCT_road_works_desc:0 "Outside of Jezeragrad, Lake City's transportation network is incredibly archaic, leading to the flow of goods being needlessly slow and risky. By investing into upgrading our road networks we could ensure that economic activity progresses unhindered."
 LCT_damm_the_river:0 "Dam the Griffking"
 LCT_damm_the_river_desc:0 "The construction of a hydroelectric dam upon the Griffking is no easy feat. However, if we were successful in constructing this project we'd greatly increase the quality of life within our nation as electricity is produced, irrigation becomes more manageable, and previously untapped resources become available."
 LCT_build_steekworks:0 "Svetigrad Steelworks"
 LCT_build_steekworks_desc:0 "The province of Svetazemlja is rich in iron but poor in coal. This means that the rich reserves have previously gone untouched as the heat needed to purify the iron has been absent. However, the completion of the Griffking Damn has allowed us to use its electricity to heat our newly constructed blast furnances."
 LCT_build_aluminium_plant:0 "Svetigrad Aluminium Plant"
 LCT_build_aluminium_plant_desc:0 "The construction of the Griffking Dam has both reduced the flow of the Griffking River and helped better manage its seasonal extremes. This means that previously unfeasible economic projects, on the banks of the river, have become a reality. One such project is an aluminum mine and corresponding smelter in the province's capital."
 LCT_expand_aluminium_plant:0 "Expand the Svetigrad Aluminium Plant"
 LCT_expand_aluminium_plant_desc:0 "The success of the Svetigrad Aluminum Plant has invigorated private investment into aluminum mines and smelters throughout the provinces of Svetazemlja. However, to truly capitalize on this boom we should invest a significant amount of public capital into subsidies and tax breaks."
 LCT_invest_in_neuculer_power:0 "Invest in Nuclear Power"
 LCT_invest_in_neuculer_power_desc:0 "The splitting of the atom has opened up a world of possibilities for us. One such opportunity has been the construction of a power generation facility which will be fueled by the controlled fission of uranium-235. This would offer us a secure and clean source of energy without relying upon foreign imports of coal and oil."
 
 LCT_improve_science_1:0 "Expand the University of Jezeragrad"
 LCT_improve_science_1_desc:0 "The University of Jezeragrad has been the premier location for Lake City students looking for an education in law, theology, and philosophy. However, it's been hindered by relatively weak science and engineering programs. By investing into upgrading this facility we'd not only gain valuable research space but also stem the tide of brain drain leaving our nation."
 LCT_improve_science_2:0 "Invest in our Scientists"
 LCT_improve_science_2_dessc:0 "The heavy emphasis on military spending has resulted in little funding being directed towards civilian research and development, hindering our ability to innovate. The investment of a small portion of our annual budget into the development of labratories and financing of grans would greatly assist in remedying this problem."
 
 LCT_broj_jedan:0 "Broj Jedan"
 LCT_war_efforts:0 "War Efforts"
 LCT_broj_jedan_desc:0 "The end of the war is in sight. With a final push and determined effort we can bring the conflict to a swift conclusion.

 LCT_conquer_river:0 "Conquer the Empire"

 LCT_army_issue_category:0 "Tackle Military Problem"
 LCT_army_issue_category_desc:0 "For too long the Military has been meddling in Lake City's politics. This most recent coup is just another example that they have grown out of control.

Born to a struggling logging family, a school-age Tree promised them that he would dispel their woes by serving in the Lake Army. Tree took the time to borrow hordes of books on the army's history to prepare, which evolved into selling some of his belongings to purchase copies of military philosophy from across the world.\n\nWhen he entered the academy, he knew the ins and outs of grand strategy, only to be stopped by envious old-timers who didn't want an upstart to replace them, but while backroom politics delayed his graduation by two years, graduate he did. More than a decade on, he's been called "the scholar with a gun" for his insistence on gleaning wisdom from ancient battles and history lessons, which has led him to found the Demokratski's right-wing: the Preko Drvoreda, banking on a platform of greater military privileges.\n\nYet, unbeknownst to all but his inner circle, his time with history books was only a front. Hushed inquiries led to archived documents, and their contents fomented a twisted love for the long-dead River Empire. To him, Lake City was a husk of the Lakeish spirit, anemic against against any griffon assault. Benchwarmers occupied the seats of power, making a mockery of the Soldiers' Path and the emperor's divine will.\n\nSo if the imperial restoration means setting a torch to democracy one day, so be it."

 ###Leader Descriptions
 POLITICS_SPRINGTIME_FROST_DESC:0 "Springtime Frost was destined to balance the nation by virtue of not rocking the boat. He was spoken well of in class and in his later career of Demokratski politicking thanks to agreeing to almost everyone's points of view while rarely voicing out his own. To his credit, he took joy in being a silent workhorse while everypony else spewed their bluster out.\n\nBut in 1004, the socially liberal Dew Point, the previous leader of the Demokratski as well as Grand Mayor of Lake City, died in a car explosion. Springtime publicly questioned the circumstances of Dew's death, but under-the-table deals and threats of "going out the same way" had him bow his head, join the party's snap elections, and sit on top of both party and country. Still, even as Springtime pushed for small-step reforms, he couldn't stop the Cehovi and military high command from snooping in on him with guns and money, politely asking for his support or else. Thus, the status quo has been maintained.\n\nAs the last leg of his party leadership—and his Lakeish presidency—runs its course, one thing Springtime kept close to heart is a genuine concern for his loved ones and his own life. The military had been merciful to let him not run for re-election and to keep all cars from exploding in his vicinity. All he has to do is to placate the shady muzzles while passing just enough reforms to legitimise democracy, and he can fade into the obscurity of a much safer career, like gardening."
 POLITICS_WAVEBREAKER_DESC:0 "While Wavebreaker's lineage can be traced back to one of Blessed Sword's loyal warlords, his fisherpony upbringing hid his passion for valour in battle. That secret soon spilled out into the open once news of the Longswordian Genocide made the rounds; he then swore to his parents that he would help save all of Vartai. They didn't stop him from volunteering, and fortunately, his entry coincided with a new development in the battlefield: aerial warfare.\n\nWavebreaker signed up for the program immediately. Over the rest of the 990s into the new millennium, while the lack of war, for most days, kept him in patrol duty, the experience freed him up to the sky's wonders while handling griffon raiders head-on, glad to safeguard the airspace of his fellow Lakeponies.\n\nBut youthful pride soon faded. Rumours of corruption among his superiors multiplied, that the successors of the River Empire's honour-bound warriors were spoiled stallion-children unworthy of their ranks. Thus, some say that his career-ending crash wasn't what started his fervent rise in harmonic politics—it was simply the last straw.\n\nWith a nakedly populist platform propelling him to the reins of the Udruzenje Moderni Pohod, the political rookie has his work cut out for him. One thing is for sure: for the first time, Lakeish Harmony will be on the offensive."
 POLITICS_DIRTY_DEEDS_DESC:0 "A self-made businesspony who departed from his ancestors' tradition of making brandy, Deeds studied abroad, where he learned economic schools of thoughts and how the state could benefit from the rise of mass industrialisation. Eager to make his mark on Lake City when he returned, his first course of action was to establish a construction company, accepting contracts from the military to upgrade their bases as well as Riverland businesses looking to expand into Jezeragrad.\n\nBut that's what his spokesponies would tell you; workers and Harmonites will claim it's not the whole story. As the newest face of money among the Cehovi, he's had to keep an iron grip on his position and his constant profits. Tales are told outside of his presence, of factory supervisors forcing workers to sleep beside assembly lines—or worse, to not sleep at all for dozens of hours—and of Deeds himself dividing construction workers into gangs where the best performers would get nice beds and warm food while the rest would be kicked out with only minimum wages.\n\nBut Deeds lets the neighsayers bray. He only cares about what the Cehovi and the army will say: they are his backers, after all, and they're asking for greater investments among the griffon demographic. Griffon workers in his factories, griffon enemies to justify defence spending... in a continent full of them, there's much money to be made."
 POLITICS_PRINCE_SNOW_DESC:0 "i dont wanna be here :("
 POLITICS_SIX_LORDS_DESC:0 "Until recently, only hushed whispers carried by the unspoken threat of dishonourable discharge or worse revealed to a scarce few the existence of the army's puppetmasters, the "Šest Vojvodi." The Six Lords.\n\nHow these six collaborated with each other is more disordered theories than a clear-cut story. The only thing that can be agreed upon is that five of them had already been on mutually good terms for a long time, but long after Westerly Leeward began pursuing politics, the Lords asked him to represent their interests in the civilian sector, and he accepted.\n\nHowever, the Lords have now thrust themselves and the entire Jezeragrad military into the chains of political command. While outside observers during the coup expected that the new leadership would base their legitimacy on restoring the River Empire, this has not been the case.\n\nInstead, they've set their sights on the west, declaring that their mission is "to exterminate the griffon threat for Lake City and ponykind, nothing else.""
 POLITICS_STARDUST_DELIGHT_DESC:0 "Rijekograd-born, Stardust moved to Lake City after college, stirred by the Harmonic ideals of her political science course to help the less fortunate. She faced backlash from local farmers for being a city-bound foreigner who only had "book smarts", but she made up for it by helping form microfinance initiatives to uphold farmers' self-sufficiency, paving the way for them to form their own small businesses.\n\nBut seeing how griffons were treated in Lake City stoked a greater fire within her. They were refugees who couldn't afford to be in more liberal countries, suffering Lakeish beliefs on foreigners as demonic outlanders and on the Herzland sin of extinguishing the blessed Grand Principality. No wonder the Udruzenje Moderni Pohod, Lake City's Harmonist party, found her housing two whole families of griffons in her already cramped home, giving them love and care while they scrounged up the funds to pack their bags to elsewhere.\n\nIt is thus a painful irony that she has come to power through violence, though not of her own doing. She happened to be the head of what was left of the Harmonist party in the wake of the previous administration, and many griffon rebels flocked to her side. She welcomed them, though only if they promised to kill if all other avenues of diplomacy have failed.\n\nAs Lake City was Griffonia's crossroads of ponies and griffons for centuries, it is only fitting that Stardust would oversee the fate of the two species. While ending generations of hatred is no easy feat, under Stardust's hopeful rule, maybe Lakeponies—and all of Griffonia—will finally join appendages and sing in harmony one day."

 ##Generals' Descriptions
 GENERAL_LCT_westerly_leeward_DESC: "Westerly spent his formative years in a village straddling close to Longsword. His single mother, a Ponikami oracle, relayed to him stories of his missing—then dead—father who'd been captured by griffon bandits. This, combined with the Lakeish pride found in serving the country, spurred Westerly to join to exact revenge against any griffon he would encounter.\n\nBut times would prove peaceful. His service consisted only of capturing griffon deserters and shooting at smugglers. Still, he proved effective at his post, gaining him several promotions... and shady deals that would lay the foundations of today's Six Lords.\n\nBut the Longswordian Genocide was a paradigm shift. A border skirmish with the radical Reformisten and a crisis of faith had him pull many strings to leave the army honourably. He took his experience to the political sphere, and while most of his parties were short-lived, a common message broke through: to give Lake City renewed purpose through a truly national army.\n\nNow the Six Lords' ambassador, he's the Lakeponies' face of unity, advocating for a decisive end to the griffon threat. Still, when he can, he visits his hometown, philosophizing upon the sacred soldier's path. And wondering if his deceased mother had become a Ponikami herself."
 GENERAL_LCT_star_talent_DESC: "Even before the coup, the social circles that knew of Star nicknamed her "The Lake's Lily of the Valley." Given the flower's Lakeish connotations of revived joys, the reason why becomes clear.\n\nDespite her agricultural ancestry, Star soon fell in love with the martial traditions of Jezeragrad. Growing food for the brave soldiers wasn't enough; she wanted to be a general, lapping up all the praise and honor for a successful operation. After convincing her parents to send her to a prestigious military academy, she graduated with flying colours due to her growing network of connections founded by her amiable personality.\n\nIt is unclear how she was roped into what would become the Six Lords. If third- and fourth-hoof reports are to be believed, she'd been kept around or made herself useful by enforcing an optimistic outlook among the likes of lieutenants and colonels through both threats and surprisingly well thought-out letters of encouragement. With the recent advent of radio, she'd even expressed starting a radio show just so she could maintain rapport with the common Lakepony.\n\nFor all that, however, her membership among the Six Lords has cast suspicion upon her positivity, that it's all a facade so everyone can do her bidding, no questions asked. If true, it lends her nickname an appropriate ambiguity: the lily of the valley is also a poisonous plant."
 GENERAL_LCT_solid_rocks_DESC: ""The best offense is a good defense." Fortunate are those who do not try correcting Solid on the real maxim.\n\nBut that disconnect only houses more enigmas in the burly Earth pony: His muscular physique and a reputation as an unruly high school record wouldn't have placed him today as a stoic stallion; passing participation in underground fighting rings shouldn't have shaped him up to value strategic defense above all else. Yet, that is his philosophy, and his cautious approach saved hundreds of lives  from ill-thought-out attacks of their own doing.\n\nIt could be said, though, that the disconnect still makes sense. The rare times the general raises his voice are when corpses pile up against his indefatigable strongholds, a fitting punishment for whoever dared set hoof, claw, or paw into Lake City."
 GENERAL_LCT_daring_dream_DESC: "Depending on who you ask, Daring Dream is either a magical genius who didn't need to finish her studies or an insane gloryhound who should've been barred from high command.\n\nEither impression fits her puzzling rise to power. No one is sure where or who she came from or if she's Lakeish to begin with. All that is known is that a teenage Dream showed up decades ago to answer a recruitment drive, and her affinity for both magic and strategy gained her notoriety among her peers.\n\nNowadays, she sometimes shouts "Charge!" to re-enact the glorious offensives of Blessed Sword himself, powering up a spell to blast her foes with... before realizing her error and getting her troops to retreat and actually strategise. But her gaffes are outweighed by her fervent military foresight, and the lucky few who have Daring in their pockets will have even the worst plans play right into her skillful hooves."
 GENERAL_LCT_smoke_signal_DESC: "Her eternally disheveled appearance and constant state of drunkenness runs counter to the soldier's virtue of self-control, but she's the exception rather than the rule, for her inebriated war tactics, with her penchant for the biggest guns the army can offer, result in bigger gains than when she's sober. Which is almost never.\n\nSaid penchant for guns has ended up her singular drive in life. Hoarding a personal collection of small arms this side of Griffonia,  she also has personal artillery, though inquiries as to where she's gotten some of these howitzers have encountered dead ends. What is more mysterious, though, is her retinue of researchers and runners who answer only to her, scouring the continent for scraps of other nations' tossed-out secret weapon prototypes for her—and Lake City's—benefit.\n\nDuring active conflict, Smoke can be seen living at an FOB, close to where she can drink, sleep, and battleplan to the beat of the artillery's drum."
 GENERAL_LCT_flaming_hot_DESC: "Graduated among the top ten in Lake City Army College, the smug pegasus is quite the wannabe charmer. He professes himself the smartest of his clique, and is more than willing to show neighsayers a record of his accomplishments on the field as a leader, though the whole truth—which he himself doesn't know—involved his father bribing the College to give him honors for the sake of an already established bloodline of majors and generals. The consequences show in Flaming's average-at-best performance, able to organise his soldiers to pursue an objective but not with enough tactical depth to do it efficiently.\n\nThose same consequences also show in his wanton mischief off the battlefield, wooing mares with middling success as well as a season of moonlighting as a substitute for the local hoofball team (which also involved bribery to keep him safe from being discharged for being AWOL).\n\nBut truth be told, he is a competent enough officer, and his associates have channeled his crass tendencies towards beneficial ends, like interesting him in the art of diplomacy. At the very least, coaxing leaders who rule entire countries is a step up from the Jezeragrad dating scene."
 GENERAL_LCT_big_money_DESC: "The son of businesspony and career politician Dirty Deeds, Big Money can say that he's had the honour of serving in the Lake City army, even if he won't tell you that he was forced to volunteer by his father. Fortunately, he did get over it, and the prospect of protecting the country grew on him, if only because it meant, one day, he'd boss ponies around as a commander. While that dream would later be granted to him, it remains to be seen if he will ever outgrow the insults spoken behind his back of being the unqualified spawn of nepotism.\n\nOn the side, he visits his company's factories, having adopted the tried-and-tested managerial strategy of shouting at soot-faced labourers until they produce bigger numbers."

 LCT_sunrise_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 20th of May, 970 in Equestria\n\n§YBiography§!:Born in a scenic oceanside village in the Sunny Shore, Sunrise's childhood was, on the surface, not unlike most Equestrian foals; However, Sunrise grew up in a household marred by alcoholism and abuse. After a particularly bad altercation which resulted in a kitchen knife being slashed over her eye, a 13 year old Sunrise ran away from home, stowing away on a merchant ship bound for Rottendedam.\n\nIn another turn of events, the merchant vessel was captured and sacked by Hauklander Pirates, taking Sunrise with them. After three years with the pirates, and another year on a Feathisian ship as a "expert guide to the crossroads pirates", Sunrise finally made it to Griffonia. Following a stint as a small-time criminal in Rottendedam, she became a mercenary under a griffon named Marcus Grimfeathers, and began travelling the continent as a soldier of fortune.\n\nShooting her way through the ranks (both literally and figuratively), Sunrise eventually found herself as Grimfeathers' right-hoof mare. Eventually the mercs found themselves in the employ of Count Caelan of Blackhollow in his war against Griffonstone, and Grimfeathers was met with an untimely demise, leaving Sunrise in command of the entire company. By 1001, she was hired by Lake City in an effort to maintain discipline within the Lakeish troops.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Scroup"

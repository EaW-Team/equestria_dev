  GFF_another_day:0 "New Year, Usual Headaches"
  GFF_another_day_desc:0 "The money vault is almost empty. Again. The administration tried to ration and distribute, but reserves vanished quicker than expected. Bandits and communist rebels are seizing the chaos to destabilise the country, while cannibals terrify the population. They are used to it, though. But, before asking for more funds from the overlords, a New Year meeting has to be held."

 ### IDEAS ##################################
 ###########################################

 ## Initial Ideas ##

 GFF_bandits:0 "The Bandit Issue"
 GFF_bandits_desc:0 "Ever since the Frontier's economy stagnated, poverty became one of the biggest concerns of our administration, which led to our resource distribution networks. However, as said networks proved to be more of a short-term solution when many towns reported getting no help, with the richest being safe from the consequences, bandits appeared left and right to survive, with their tactics of raiding and control further destabilising the country.\n\nOne of these groups is from a griffon called Virgil, known for being one of the few bandit leaders that raid the richest to genuinely distribute it all to the poor, which makes any town that we were unable to help resistant to any attempts of the administration to take back control.\n\nIncreasing our efforts in hunting them down would just risk anielating our people. If the administration wants to run them out, they need to find a way to properly distribute the necessary resources."

 GFF_cannibals:0 "The Mountains of Madness"
 GFF_cannibals_desc:0 "The region is not foreign to difficulties in finding or growing food. The majority of the land being mountains made logistics hard to establish or find land suitable to agriculture. The yak natives got used to it though and, through luck and skill, the region became more self-sufficient.\n\nBut the griffon settlers paid the price as they tried to live deeper in the mountains.\n\nThe climate was colder than what any griffon is used to and, despite knowing how to fly, navigating through the region became a challenge, leading to some even getting lost, even when construction works made some areas more acessible. And, as hunger and despair became the norm, many found the only way to save themselves from death: Cannibalism.\n\nThese cannibal clans are terrorising many villages to get ANYTHING to eat, leading to some of the places turning into ghost towns or, in the worst case scenario, some join the cannibal lifestyle as they had similar struggles to the clans. They even had a long time ago caused issues with the yaks of the bordering nation, which our overlords had to step in before the diplomatic incident turned into a war.\n\nWe can't let history repeat a second time."

 GFF_commies:0 "Maximalist Expatriates"
 GFF_commies_desc:0 "Years ago, Nova Griffonia almost fell to communists that were inspired by the revolution in Stalliongard. Despite their futile attempts, our overlords stomped out these rebels and, together with the normalisation of relations with the more moderates, we could be sure that the communists wouldn't terrorise any further.\n\nBut we would be forced to bite our tongues as reports of communist rebels taking over some villages came to our desk. And worse: We suspect that most were part of the overlord's attempted coup. While we are able to fend them off, for now, many villages started to sympathize with the communist cause.\n\nThe leader of the communist rebels is unknown to us and their guerrilla patterns are not consistent, making the job harder. But that won't make us give up on cracking them down and send them back to our overlords so that justice can be delivered to them."

 GFF_economic_chaos:0 "Economic Recession"
 GFF_economic_chaos_desc:0 "Our current funding has almost drained, way earlier than planned, and it's already causing issues ranging from the salaries of our garrison to the efficiency of our resource distribution networks. Getting more money isn't just urgent. It's necessary so that the so-called "constitutional anarchy" doesnt turn into a literal anarchy."

 GFF_commie_friends:0 "Redtail's Rebels"

### EVENTS #################################
###########################################
 frontier.1.t:0 "Grovel for Funds"
 frontier.1.d:0 "The frontier has had all sorts of issues ever since the first griffons decided to settle in the town of Frosthill, those issues have been ignored for decades now by incompetent governors. It's gotten to the point where bandits are actually threatening to take over the country! If we do not get funds to at least attempt to address the situation we are doomed!"
 frontier.1.a:0 "Now we just have to convince Teafeather..."
 frontier.2.t:0 "A Miracle"
 frontier.2.d:0 "Through some miracle we actually managed to get funding from Weter..."
 frontier.2.a:0 "A surprise, but a welcome one."
 frontier.3.t:0 "Expected Result"
 frontier.3.d:0 "Unsurprisingly our begging fell on deaf ears..."
 frontier.3.a:0 "Well we're screwed."
 frontier.4.t:0 "The Coming Storm"
 frontier.4.d:0 "Dark times are ahead of us, bandits are already gathering... for something, and with no funds we most likely won't be able to weather the storm."
 frontier.4.a:0 "Might as well pack my bags."
 frontier.5.t:0 "Apply for Statehood"
 frontier.5.d:0 "After all the turmoil and hardships we've finally managed to more or less fix our situation, and as such we should make a formal request to officially join Nova Griffonia as a proper province."
 frontier.5.a:0 "Here goes nothing..."
 frontier.6.t:0 "A Shipment"
 frontier.6.d:0 "All we've managed to buy with our meagre funds are some old Stalliongrader rifles from a rather dubious source. It's not much, but it is something."
 frontier.6.a:0 "At least they work."
 frontier.7.t:0 "Virgil Makes a Move"
 frontier.7.d:0 "In yet another unsurprising move, Virgil's Raider's sensing weakness descended from the mountains and took over practically every town in the Frontier with barely any resistance, taking over the country. Governor Muck has already fled back to Weter to inform the Nova Griffonian authorities of this new development."
 frontier.7.a:0 "Let us see how Teafeather responds..."
 frontier.8.t:0 "Nova Griffonia Proposes a Truce"
 frontier.8.d:0 "Teafeather and his cronies have been trying to put us down for months, but his troops can't compare to our experienced raiders. We've been pushing them back for a while, and soon after a messenger had arrived, asking to discuss terms of truce. On first sight, it seems pretty great for us - peace, independence, recognition and all of our territory, but on the other claw, why would they ask for truce if they weren't close to losing? The boss thinks we should take all of Nova Griffonia right now, but the other bandit leaders believe it would be more wiser to take the deal so we can build up for the next confrontation."
 frontier.8.a:0 "You can have your damned peace, Teafeather."
 frontier.8.b:0 "No peace, no rest - fight to the end!" 
 frontier.9.t:0 "The Boiling Point"
 frontier.9.d:0 "Anyone with two eyes could have seen it coming, after months of debating, mutual contempt and conflict of interests the situation between Redtail and Virgil has reached a boiling point. To make matters worse Redtail has already mobilised her Red Guard with the intent to march on Frosthill and seize control of our new Nation."
 frontier.9.a:0 "The Red Guard is beaten back and Redtail flees into the mountains."
 frontier.9.b:0 "Redtail and her Red Guard seize Frosthill and drive Virgil into the mountains."
 frontier.11.t:0 "The Griffons' Proposal"
 frontier.11.d:0 "It seems that the griffons have embraced Socialism, even better they've decided to send an ambassador in an attempt to join the Socialist Union, what shall we do?"
 frontier.11.a:0 "Allow them to join."
 frontier.11.b:0 "I don't trust those pigeons..."
 frontier.12.t:0 "Stalliongrad Accepts"
 frontier.12.d:0 "It seems that Stalliongrad has accepted our petition to join their union."
 frontier.12.a:0 "Workers of the world unite!"
 frontier.13.t:0 "Stalliongrad Refuses"
 frontier.13.d:0 "It seems that Stalliongrad has denied our petition to join their union."
 frontier.13.a:0 "I thought we were beyond sectarianism!"
 frontier.14.t:0 "Long Pork"
 frontier.14.d:0 "Truth be told the Frontier has never lacked in danger. However it takes a special kind of person to wake up one day and decide to eat their fellow citizen, and while many places would have to deal with cannibalism every once in a while we have to deal with it on an almost daily basis... while many of our citizens have accepted this fact at this point needless to say it doesn't exactly help reflect well on our government."
 frontier.14.a:0 "Just another day on the Frontier..."
 frontier.15.t:0 "Crime Lord Becomes Emperor!"
 frontier.15.d:0 "We've got to admit to ourselves, none of us saw the boss coming this far. First he convinced radically different groups to join forces with him, he fought off Teafeather and his cronies, prevented a rebellion and finally, we made our way to Weter. Teafeather's death threw the country in a lotta trouble, for sure, but that only made it easier for us to cement our rule across the entire Griffonian Colony.\n\nNow I ain't much for ceremonies, but it was a great blast to watch Virgil declare himself Emperor of all Western Griffonian Lands, as we forced the surviving civilians and government officials to spectate this spectacle. Perhaps we shelled Weter a bit too hard, but no problem, some other griffon will fix that. The only thing that would make this better would be if Teafeather was here to witness this! Bastard would have died again just from listening to our boss.\n\nDrunken revelry continued late in the night, but tomorrow morning, the boss had us start doing work again. We shall ensure our gains become permanent. All hail Emperor Virgil!"
 frontier.15.a:0 "Victory is ours!"
 frontier.151.t:0 "The New Emperor"
 frontier.151.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Following his recent victory over the Nova Griffonian Government the Bandit-King Virgil has declared himself Emperor of Western Griffonia, the coronation took place inside the bombed out ruins of Weter's parliament building. \nThose in Weter who survived the Virgilian takeover were forced out at gunpoint to watch the coronation of their new Emperor."
 frontier.151.a:0 "The Bandit won?"
 frontier.151.b:0 "All hail the Emperor!"
 frontier.16.t:0 "Virgil's End"
 frontier.16.d:0 "We've been hunting Virgil for weeks now. Bastard is a slippery one, I'll give him that, with many helpers and hideouts, but his time is at an end. We've spent a few days sitting in seedy taverns, until we cornered one of his close subordinates. It took some... persuasive methods to get him to squeal, but we got our info and he kept his miserable life.\n\nIt seemed like it would be easy: a secluded canyon perched between mountainsides. Only one way out, my griffons had the skies covered for any surprises, our guns were loaded and ready. It takes a cruel reminder never to relax on this job, however.\n\nI took two of my best colleagues with me to confront the bandit leader. As we approached the canyon valley where we knew Virgil was hiding, two gunshots were heard. I could almost see the bullets whizzing past me as they hit the poor sods in the wings, immediately causing them to fall over in pain, crippled. Cursing that son of a harlot, I immediately took flight and closed the distance, smug bastard standing with his revolver held high. I noticed unmarked tombstones behind him, but I didn't care. Now, it was personal.\n\nThere were no words exchanged between us. Quickly taking my reliable pistol with a firm claw grip, I intended to cut him down quickly, if it weren't for his unnatural agility. It was almost as if he danced, dodging my shots! Even worse, his aim was far better than mine. The feeling of bullets brushing close to my body really hurt. Gritting my teeth, I raised my gun and took a desperate shot. To my surprise, it found the mark in his neck. He almost looked surprised, dropping his revolver and slumping over in a heap. After I covered my wounds, I went back to check on my griffons, while our airborne scouts took notice of the events transpiring. We've done it!\n\nGovernor Muck's bounty better be worth all this trouble..."
 frontier.16.a:0 "Justice has been served."
 frontier.17.t:0 "Redtail's Final Stand"
 frontier.17.d:0 "Life has been changing slowly, but drastically in the Frontier ever since we've received funding from Weter. A semblance of law and order has been restored to our towns and villages, although it's being carried out by hired griffons instead of the incompetent police force. Nonetheless, groups determined to throw the Frontier to anarchy have continued operating, until today one of them was wiped out.\n\nSeveral groups of bounty hunters, driven by the thrill of the hunt and the promise of payment, have banded together to capture the infamous communist revolutionary Redtail. After several attacks on mountain strongholds known to be aligned with her, she was finally cornered. A week long siege ensued, and although the communists fought with great desperation, they couldn't prevent the capture of their leader.\n\nBound and gagged, feathers plucked, Redtail was dragged down to the authorities where she awaits her fate. Meanwhile, stores and taverns have been reporting greatly increased income..."

edgy_commie_bird_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 5th of April, 970 in Weter\n\n§YBiography§!: Heinrich Redtail's sister, Ulla remembers her young self enamored by the distant tyrannical Griffonian Empire breaking to Kemerskai's revolution. She sought to learn all she could while maturing, hoping to one day overthrow the chains she believed choked Nova Griffonia's populace.\n\nPrior to Stalliongrad's formation, Ulla joined the growing communist party within Nova Griffonia with her brother and gained a position of high influence. The circumstances that forced Stalliongrad to break from Equestria were the very same afflicting her homeland, and Ulla initiated her life-long plan and brought her own Revolution to Nova Griffonia in 996.\n\nUnlike Stalliongrad's success, Ulla's Revolution would be crushed by Nova Griffonia's forces engaging her widespread revolutionaries in brutal force. Her Revolution was snuffed out, and when faced with defeat and the forgone conclusion of her execution, Ulla took flight.\n\nHiding on the Frontier, Ulla allowed herself time to reflect hard on her failures before plotting again. She was downed, but her leftist ideals for Nova Griffonia were not yet defeated. In those moments, Ulla came to a conclusion—one as cold as it was universal: the only thing that mattered with ideologies... was force."

edgy_commie_bird_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 5th of April, 970 in Weter\n\n§YBiography§!: Heinrich Redtail's sister, Ulla remembers her young self enamored by the distant tyrannical Griffonian Empire breaking to Kemerskai's revolution. She sought to learn all she could while maturing, hoping to one day overthrow the chains she believed choked Nova Griffonia's populace.\n\nPrior to Stalliongrad's formation, Ulla joined the growing communist party within Nova Griffonia with her brother and gained a position of high influence. The circumstances that forced Stalliongrad to break from Equestria were the very same afflicting her homeland, and Ulla initiated her life-long plan and brought her own Revolution to Nova Griffonia in 996.\n\nUnlike Stalliongrad's success, Ulla's Revolution would be crushed by Nova Griffonia's forces engaging her widespread revolutionaries in brutal force. Her Revolution was snuffed out, and when faced with defeat and the forgone conclusion of her execution, Ulla took flight.\n\nHiding on the Frontier, Ulla allowed herself time to reflect hard on her failures before plotting again. She was downed, but her leftist ideals for Nova Griffonia were not yet defeated. In those moments, Ulla came to a conclusion—one as cold as it was universal: the only thing that mattered with ideologies... was force."

muck_stress_governor_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 16th February 960, Boreasfjord\n\n§YBiography§!: If Muck had been told that his leadership skills would be pushed to the their limit in the frontier, he would've thought the statement an exaggeration. Now, he thinks it would be an understatement.\n\nBorn to a middle-class family, Muck grew a reputation for his political acumen. From being the youngest mayor of his birth city to the governor of the whole region, his rise was meteoric. Battling crime, enduring strikes, and shrugging off thugs that sought to destroy everything he fought to preserve, there was no challenge he couldn't meet. His studious leadership even meant that his region was one of the few to remain stalwartly loyal to Nova Griffonia when the Revolution of 996 split the country. Even workers flocked to join Muck's militias.\n\nWith glowing reviews from representatives across of the government it was no surprise that, in 1001, Governor Teafeather offered him the position of governor of the Frosthill Frontier. While Muck knew of the hardships of the frontier, he figured his abilities were more than equal. Sure that with his claw on the tiller the frontier would turn from a rough piece of coal into a diamond that he could use to propel himself to even greater heights.\n\nThat was 6 years ago, Muck looks like he's aged 16. Despite his best efforts the frontier is bordering on collapse. A trashed economy, a corrupt administration under him, and unorganized militias that allow bandits and rebels to freely roam the countryside. To make it worse, each year of failure has brought a decrease in funding, despite his pleas.\n\n Though there are increasing calls from his friends and relatives to resign and save his battered mental health, Muck refuses. For he made a promise when he took on the governship: that he would save the frontier, and turn it into a model state. Despite it all, he still hopes to fulfil his promise.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Pakk"

###########################################

 GFF_another_day:0 "New Year, Usual Headaches"
 GFF_another_day_desc:0 "The money vault is almost empty. Again. The administration tried to ration and distribute, but reserves vanished quicker than expected. Bandits and communist rebels are seizing the chaos to destabilise the country, while cannibals terrify the population. They are used to it, though. But, before asking for more funds from the overlords, a New Year meeting has to be held."

 GFF_raid_the_raiders:0 "Raid the Raiders"
 GFF_raid_the_raiders_desc:0 "It's no secret that the region's lack of power to address poverty and economic inequality led to the rise of bandits, especially those popular for caring for the people. The most powerful of them, though, is the raiders of a griffon called Virgil. The good news is that an informant warned Muck that he found one of their operational sites. Time to fight fire with fire. The fire itself? A "raid"."

 GFF_equalise_help:0 "Balance the Distribution Funding"
 GFF_equalise_help_desc:0 "One major concern in the  country is the distribution networks, which provide food, clothes, and water to the more isolated towns. However, even with attempts to airlift supplies, many citizens reported not receiving anything and accused the administration of negligence. For now, Muck will revise how the funding for the networks is used to move the excesses to the most underfunded areas."

 GFF_try_trap_commies:0 "Corner the Maximalists"
 GFF_try_trap_commies_desc:0 "Despite Nova Griffonia's efforts, many coup revolutionaries from 996 have fled from their grasp. And said revolutionaries decided to use the Frontier as the new base of operations, with them taking over several villages, even attracting followers with their foolish ideas. The administration was warned of a truck carrying guns for these rebels, which could be the "bait" they needed to catch them."

 GFF_cut_other_increase_food:0 "Invest More in Food"
 GFF_cut_other_increase_food_desc:0 "Inefficient resource distribution has left the more isolated populace hungry and feeling abandoned. Some got desperate enough to turn cannibalism into part of their routine. The administration must intervene before the number of cannibals gets out of control. The remaining funds must be allocated for distribution and invested in food that lasts longer and that can quickly reach the populace."

 GFF_check_coal_mines:0 "Check the Mines"
 GFF_check_coal_mines_desc:0 "Coal mining became the most important economic activity ever since it gave hope to many settlers who longed for stability in the early years of the frontier, even more when the gold had run out. Nova Griffonia became the only possible partner, as everybody else doesn't recognise the Frontier. Hopefully, the annual meeting with the manager of the mining operations will give Muck good news."

 GFF_fortify_possible_targets:0 "Fortify the Expected Targets"
 GFF_fortify_possible_targets_desc:0 "[GFFortifyDesc]"
 GFF_fortify_possible_targets_desc_first:0 "After the operation against Virgil's raiders, Muck organised with the minister of defence plans to fortify some towns and cities with the presence of the rich who found it cheaper to own houses in the Frontier instead of Nova Griffonia."
 GFF_fortify_possible_targets_desc_second:0 "After the disastrous operation against Virgil's raiders, the plans to fortify the towns and cities with the presence of the rich became insufficient. The minister of defence suggested using part of the remaining army volunteers to patrol these areas. Hopefully, the budget allocated is enough to pay for this new job of theirs."

 GFF_suspend_ministries:0 "Partial Government Shutdown"
 GFF_suspend_ministries_desc:0 "With the funding for the governmental duties of the Frontier draining, Muck had no choice but to shut down some of the least critical ministries to save money."

 GFF_clean_commie_propaganda:0 "Crackdown on Commie Propaganda"
 GFF_clean_commie_propaganda_desc:0 "Fighting is useless if the Maximalists can attract many of the people to their cause, which not only makes it hard for the population to sympathise with the government but also makes the jobs of cracking them down more difficult. The militias will now have the explicit order to remove any type of propaganda of these communists."

 GFF_open_the_emergency_reserve:0 "Open the Emergency Vault"
 GFF_open_the_emergency_reserve_desc:0 "The emergency vault doesn't live up entirely to its name as it was always opened due to the funding constantly draining, which nowadays was more and more the norm. It will provide enough money to keep running the country while Muck is away to Weter."

 GFF_multitasking:0 "Accumulate Governmental Functions"
 GFF_multitasking_desc:0 "The suspension of ministries, while necessary, leaves some services down and withholds salaries of the workers under said services. As per protocol, the functions of the suspended ministries will be reassigned to the remaining cabinet members. Sure, it will be a bureaucratic mess, but there isn't much choice."

 GFF_the_dreaded_request:0 "The Dreaded Groveling"
 GFF_the_dreaded_request_desc:0 "At last, Muck will travel to Weter to convince Teafeather to provide more funds. He always dreaded this day, as it always seemed that his pleas to stop the funding from decreasing fell on deaf ears. But, if he plays his cards right, hopefully, the predictable failure won't happen."

 ### IDEAS ##################################
 ###########################################

 ## Initial Ideas ##

 GFF_bandits:0 "The Bandit Issue"
 GFF_bandits_desc:0 "Ever since the Frosthill Frontier's economy stagnated, poverty has become one of the biggest concerns of our administration. Our Resource Distribution Program sought to remedy this by providing the basics at little or no charge to our citizens. However, said networks have proven to be less effective than hoped. With many towns reporting getting none of the promised material while the richest enjoy the excess. Starving, yet unwilling to turn to the cannibal bands, many in these towns embraced banditry. Their raids further destabilising the country and the RDP.\n\nOne of the newest bandits groups is led by a griffon named Virgil. Known for being one of the few bandit leaders to raid the richest and be genuine in their promise of distributing the spoils to the poor.\n\nWith the likes of Virgil receiving increased public support our efforts to hunt these bands down risks alienating our people. If we're to finally run the bandits down then we need to reform the RDP into what it was always meant to be."

 GFF_cannibals:0 "The Mountains of Madness"
 GFF_cannibals_desc:0 "The frontier region is no stranger to food scarcity. The mountainous landscape makes agriculture difficult and wild game hard to find. Those who first settled the frontier acclimatized, and with some hard taught skill and luck the region became nearly self-sufficient in food.\n\nAs the griffon settlers who ventured deeper into the mountains would learn, nearly is not good enough.\n\nThe climate was colder than what any griffon was used to. Frequent blizzards and confusing geography meant that even with flight navigation was a challenge. Many griffins lost their way in the mountains and, as hunger and despair set in, found the only way to save themselves from death was cannibalism.\n\nThe descendents of these long dead settlers have turned into cannibal clans. Terrorising villages and travelers, still desperate for anything to eat. Many once prosperous villages have turned into ghost towns due to the cannabiles. They've even in the past caused issues with our neighbours. With war only avoided due to the intervention of our Weter overlords.\n\nWe must bring an end to this madness, lest it consume us."

 GFF_commies:0 "Maximalist Expatriates"
 GFF_commies_desc:0 "Years ago, Nova Griffonia almost fell to communists inspired by the revolution in Stalliongard. Their efforts proved futile when their forces were destroyed, and the moderate factions of the revolutionaries made peace. What remained of the movement was forced into the mountains. Eliminating the threat of a communist terror in the countryside, and saving the republic from a red takeover.\n\nUnfortunately, it is our mountains that the remains of the communists now seek shelter in. As Nova Griffonia sits happy with its revolutionary problem resolved, we're forced to bite our tongues as reports of rebel raids land on our desks. While we are able to fend them off, for now, the worsening living conditions have caused some villages to sympathize with the communist cause. Giving them a fertile ground from which to grow themselves.\n\nThe leader of this movement is unknown to us, and there is no consistent pattern to their guerrilla war against our rule, making fighting back all the harder. But, we have not lost hope. In due time we'll crack down and send the lot back to our overlords in Weter so that justice can finally be delivered. Silencing the last choking breaths of that failed revolution."

 GFF_economic_chaos:0 "Economic Recession"
 GFF_economic_chaos_desc:0 "Our current funding has almost drained, way earlier than planned, and it's already causing issues ranging from the salaries of our garrison to the efficiency of our resource distribution networks. Getting more money isn't just urgent. It's necessary so that the so-called "constitutional anarchy" doesnt turn into a literal anarchy."

 ## STARTING TREE IDEAS ##

 GFF_resource_networking:0 "Resource Distribution Networks"
 GFF_resource_networking_desc:0 "With the funding provided to the Frontier decreasing year by year, the necessity of a stable system to help the poorest of the state grew. So, in 984, Governor Burner announced the foundation of the Frontier's Resource Distribution Networks, intending to expand the range they can reach to provide the people with the necessities: Food, clothes, water and so on. In the first year, the networks became a huge success, which allowed for the reduction of poverty and a more equitable distribution.\n\nHowever, the cracks of this system started to appear as some towns reported having received no help from the administration yet. As months passed with no improvements, and a few villages even being emptied by either starvation or defection to cannibal clans, many started to criticise the system as unreliable long term. The fact that some of the richest that found it cheaper to live in the more remote areas are unaffected by this led to accusations of the administration misleading the people and the rise of bandits, with goals ranging from personal interests or giving back to the poor, both through raids.\n\nStill to this day, the networks saw no improvement. That has to end soon but unless more funds are provided, nothing can be done."

### EVENTS #################################
###########################################

 frontier.1.t:0 "Nothing Special"
 frontier.1.d:0 "In the past, the yearly meetings were something that Muck would wait for. A recap of their progress in growing the city or region, being validated by the people's cheers when he walked around. However, the Frontier killed any relief that he would have had, with him not even needing to read the reports provided by his cabinet to know what was wrong.\n\n"Sadly, our funds are running out again. We had expected it to last for..." The finance minister checks his papers. "-almost a year." He put down his papers, as the rest of the cabinet either groaned, yawned or sighed. "We are lucky to last around 4 months... unless we get more funds from the Governor..."\n\n"We can't sustain this!" The defence minister shouted, slamming his claws on the table. "I've repeatedly argued that we should have let Nova Griffonia handle the communists, bandits, and cannibals ruining this region. And guess what? Money wasted due to incompetence!"\n\n"And because the militias aren't paid properly!" The labour minister countered, rolling her eyes. "You don't feed griffons with words and guns. These funds should have been more focused on distributing the people's needs-" The defence minister cut her off. "How if we are constantly thwarted by these threats?!?"\n\nThe room erupted in an uproar, with all ministers voicing their concerns about what other way they should have allocated the funds. Muck just sighed, shaking his head and squinting at the blurry reports."
 frontier.1.a:0 "Nothing that he isn't used to"

 frontier.4.t:0 "The Hideout"
 frontier.4.d:0 "The militias of Neu Eindlem, in the region of Uulin Griffins, together with volunteers from the capital, were tasked with retaking a mountain area close to the town after receiving news of a huge presence of raiders, especially from Virgil. They isolated the area to avoid any travellers from being killed by mistake and went deep into the mountains with a lot of supplies.\n\nAs they approached the area, it already didn't smell good, as a nearby camp was a mess, with half-finished meals on the ground and coins scattered at a few tents, one of which was open. While first faking to leave, in case rebels were inside, the militias confirmed nobody was there.\n\nIt took a while for the raiders' operation site to be reached, with empty rifles on the ground greeting the militias. It barely had any sign of life, as the few barracks present in the area were broken into and confirmed to be empty, with nothing more than broken windows.\n\nIt was clear that the operation was a failure. Before the militias could discuss how to proceed, a gunshot echoed from the higher mountains, putting them on high alert and checking the perimeter... only for cannibals, having been scared by the gunshot, to meet them and try to get them as their dinner. The group had to be rescued by other militias when the former hadn't returned for hours."
 frontier.4.a:0 "The luck is that the only deaths were from cannibals"

 frontier.6.t:0 "Introduction to Virgil"
 frontier.6.d:0 "TODO"
 frontier.6.a:0 "TODO"

 frontier.7.t:0 "A Perfect Plan"
 frontier.7.d:0 "Two sets of explosive, placed strategically to fell a pair of trees on the road. One in front to stop the gun truck, one behind to prevent a reverse. In the trees on either side of the road two four griff teams of militia lie in wait. Ready to pop out the second the commies show their beaks. Arrest the driver, take the guns, and deal a crippling blows to the revolutionaries. All-in-all, a perfect plan, all they need to do is wait for the truck to appear.\n\nThus they wait.\nAnd they wait.\nAnd they wait some more.\n\nThe hours slowly tick by as the militiagriffs begin to grow restless. Occasionally popping their heads up and being yelled at to get back in cover, or wandering off to stretch their legs. When their canteens finally run out so does the yelling for discipline. Empty clawed after nearly half a day of waiting they abandon their posts with nothing to show for the warning about the truck and the countless hours spent in the frigid cold waiting for it. All except one, who seems rather unbothered about the time he just wasted."
 frontier.7.a:0 "Did they get a warning about our warning?"

 frontier.8.t:0 "Nova Griffonia Proposes a Truce" # TO BE REWRITTEN LATER
 frontier.8.d:0 "Teafeather and his cronies have been trying to put us down for months, but his troops can't compare to our experienced raiders. We've been pushing them back for a while, and soon after a messenger had arrived, asking to discuss terms of truce. On first sight, it seems pretty great for us - peace, independence, recognition and all of our territory, but on the other claw, why would they ask for truce if they weren't close to losing? The boss thinks we should take all of Nova Griffonia right now, but the other bandit leaders believe it would be more wiser to take the deal so we can build up for the next confrontation."
 frontier.8.a:0 "You can have your damned peace, Teafeather."

 frontier.9.t:0 "As The Sun Falls"
 frontier.9.d:0 "The howl of the wind fills Ulla's ears as the few griffins still milling about begin to retreat to their tents in search of badly needed warmth. They've been waiting hours for any signs of the gun truck and its cargo. Yet nothing has arrived, and all the griffins she's sent to scour the roads have come back with reports of nothing but dense trees and desolate trails.\n\nShe turns away from the road, a claw going up to adjust sling across her chest as she looks over the camp. It is the last embers from the Revolution of 996. Still trying the impossible even after having been forced from their homes, their nation, and into these mountains. The tents she sees are of shoddy construction, what few faces not tucked away are tried, and as the rifle settles against her back she knows it is aging and prone to jams. The gun truck has been the first sliver of aid they've received in years and with each passing second it seems more and more likely that their mole has failed and the supplies have slipped through their talons.\n\n'How many more years can we run on fumes and scrap?' She thinks to herself, before letting out a sigh and trying to push such a thought to the back of her mind. Then an echo, faintest sound of a truck's engine rebounding off the mountain's side reaches her ears. As she looks back she sees at a distance a pair of headlights cutting through the new darkness of the night.\n\nTonight each revolutionary would receive a new rifle."
 frontier.9.a:0 "Fumes and scraps no more."

 frontier.10.t:0 "Report on Local Mineral Extraction"
 frontier.10.d:0 "Papers pile up on the desk before Muck. Everyday his ministers add a new stack. Each one a whole new story of how Frosthill is rushing into the red financially. Nothing out of the ordinary from last year, and the years before. Nothing that can't be handled if the mines just- A knock at the door breaks Muck's train of thought. "Come in!" He calls.\n\nThe door creaks open and in steps the Manager of the local coal mining operation. In his claw a slim vanilla folder. Without wasting any time the Manager steps forward and holds the folder out. Reluctantly, Muck takes it and flips the cover open to reveal startlingly few sheets of paper inside.\n\n"Where's the rest of your report?" Muck says as he skims through the folder. "Typically you have enough to keep me up through the night, but this looks like it'll barely take me five minutes to read."\n\n"That's all there is." The Manager's tone grim.\n\nHe looks up at the Griffin, staring in disbelief  "No... Surely not. There has to be something in those mountains we can show off to Weter."\n\n"I'm sorry, Muck. I've gone down into the depths myself and we've pulled everything we can out of the ground."\n\nAn uneasy silence fills the air as Muck sinks back into his chair, dropping the folder onto his desk to join the rest. That's the only card he had for the meeting in Weter and now it's gone.\n\n"Well, I'll catch up with you later then." Muck's voice low as he clasps his claws together. "No point in having the full meeting anymore. I have some options I need to look into." As the Manager turns to leave Muck rests his head on his claws. Wondering what he's going to have to do to convince Teafeather the Frontier is worth turning on the money spigot for again."
 frontier.10.a:0 "...Maybe just plain old begging?" 

 frontier.11.t:0 "The Militia's New Posts"
 frontier.11.d:0 ""If Muck wants those positions staffed he can do it himself!" A young griffin by the name of Conrad yells from atop a hastily assembled stage made of old surplus crates in the yard of the Frosthill militia headquarters. The crowd of griffs around him cheered.\n\nThe assembly mode of the assembly shifts as a voice booms over them "What is the meaning of this?!" The Defense Minister's words quiets the crowd, though one might also attribute it to the two armed MPs flanking him. "You all have your orders, you were meant to have moved out two hours ago! So why in Boreas are you still here?"\n\nUndaunted, Conrad again speaks "We're not taking any orders until we get our pay. Not this poultry pittance we can't even feed our families with, but real and fair pay!" An unease has fallen over the militia with the presence of the MPs, though many still cry out 'aye!'s of agreement. "We aren't leaving our families to live in unheated barracks just so Muck can feel safe in his governor's mansion. We're staying right here!"\n\nA nasty scowl plants itself on the Defense Minster's beak as he surveys the crowd. The MPs next to him fidgeting with their rifles anxiously. The militia outnumbers and, despite the quality of their equipment, outguns them. The crowd may have the hint of fear among them but every word out of Conrad's mouth is emboldening them, enraging them. Allowing this gathering to persist risks a riot, and they certainly can't be compelled to their posts. "Disperse the lot of you and go back to your homes!"\n\nNot wanting a tussle and to get back to their families the crowd broke. Soon leaving no one in the yard but the Defense Minister and his relieved guards."

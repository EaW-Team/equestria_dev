edgy_commie_bird_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 5th of April, 970 in Weter\n\n§YBiography§!: Heinrich Redtail's sister, Ulla remembers her young self enamored by the distant tyrannical Griffonian Empire breaking to Kemerskai's revolution. She sought to learn all she could while maturing, hoping to one day overthrow the chains she believed choked Nova Griffonia's populace.\n\nPrior to Stalliongrad's formation, Ulla joined the growing communist party within Nova Griffonia with her brother and gained a position of high influence. The circumstances that forced Stalliongrad to break from Equestria were the very same afflicting her homeland, and Ulla initiated her life-long plan and brought her own Revolution to Nova Griffonia in 996.\n\nUnlike Stalliongrad's success, Ulla's Revolution would be crushed by Nova Griffonia's forces engaging her widespread revolutionaries in brutal force. Her Revolution was snuffed out, and when faced with defeat and the forgone conclusion of her execution, Ulla took flight.\n\nHiding on the Frontier, Ulla allowed herself time to reflect hard on her failures before plotting again. She was downed, but her leftist ideals for Nova Griffonia were not yet defeated. In those moments, Ulla came to a conclusion—one as cold as it was universal: the only thing that mattered with ideologies... was force."

muck_stress_governor_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 16th February 960, Boreasfjord\n\n§YBiography§!: If Muck had been told before that his leadership skills would be put to the test in the Frontier, he would've thought that they were exaggerating the challenge of administering said region.\n\nBorn in a middle-class family, Muck grew a reputation for his adaptability and quick thinking when the worst came. From the youngest mayor of his birth city to the governor of the whole region, he endured crime, strikes and thugs that tried to destroy everything he fought to preserve. His region was even one of the few to mostly be on the side of Nova Griffonia when the Attempted Revolution of 996 happened, as even workers joined the side of Muck's militias.\n\nWith glowing reviews from representatives of the government of Nova Griffonia, it was no surprise that, in 1001, Governor Teafeather offered him the position of Governor of the Frontier, after the last one resigned. While Muck knew the troubles and hardships of the Frontier, he figured out that it would be just a hard yet simple challenge to reorganise the administration.\n\nBut that was 6 years ago. Muck looked like he had aged more, as the Frontier is always almost collapsing with bandits and rebels proving impossible to defeat, thanks to unorganised, weak militias. The yearly funding decrease, despite Muck's pleas to stop it, made it harder and harder to stabilise and grow the region. His stress was so bad that his relatives suggested that he quit leading there to avoid a mental collapse.\n\nBut Muck had made a promise when he got the role: that he would save the Frontier from collapse until the last second. While the position he is in became a huge pain to deal with, he still hopes to fulfil his promise.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Pakk"

### FOCUSES LOCALISATION ####################
###########################################

 GFF_another_day:0 "New Year, Usual Headaches"
 GFF_another_day_desc:0 "The money vault is almost empty. Again. The administration tried to ration and distribute, but reserves vanished quicker than expected. Bandits and communist rebels are seizing the chaos to destabilise the country, while cannibals terrify the population. They are used to it, though. But, before asking for more funds from the overlords, a New Year meeting has to be held."

 GFF_raid_the_raiders:0 "Raid the Raiders"
 GFF_raid_the_raiders_desc:0 "It's no secret that the region's lack of power to address poverty and economic inequality led to the rise of bandits, especially those popular for caring for the people. The most powerful of them, though, is the raiders of a griffon called Virgil. The good news is that an informant warned Muck that he found one of their operational sites. Time to fight fire with fire. The fire itself? A "raid"."

 GFF_equalise_help:0 "Balance the Distribution Funding"
 GFF_equalise_help_desc:0 "One major concern in the  country is the distribution networks, which provide food, clothes, and water to the more isolated towns. However, even with attempts to airlift supplies, many citizens reported not receiving anything and accused the administration of negligence. For now, Muck will revise how the funding for the networks is used to move the excesses to the most underfunded areas."

 GFF_try_trap_commies:0 "Corner the Maximalists"
 GFF_try_trap_commies_desc:0 "Despite Nova Griffonia's efforts, many coup revolutionaries from 996 have fled from their grasp. And said revolutionaries decided to use the Frontier as the new base of operations, with them taking over several villages, even attracting followers with their foolish ideas. The administration was warned of a truck carrying guns for these rebels, which could be the "bait" they needed to catch them."

 GFF_cut_other_increase_food:0 "Invest More in Food"
 GFF_cut_other_increase_food_desc:0 "Inefficient resource distribution has left the more isolated populace hungry and feeling abandoned. Some got desperate enough to turn cannibalism into part of their routine. The administration must intervene before the number of cannibals gets out of control. The remaining funds must be allocated for distribution and invested in food that lasts longer and that can quickly reach the populace."

 GFF_check_coal_mines:0 "Check the Mines"
 GFF_check_coal_mines_desc:0 "Coal mining became the most important economic activity ever since it gave hope to many settlers who longed for stability in the early years of the frontier, even more when the gold had run out. Nova Griffonia became the only possible partner, as everybody else doesn't recognise the Frontier. Hopefully, the annual meeting with the manager of the mining operations will give Muck good news."

 GFF_fortify_possible_targets:0 "Fortify the Expected Targets"
 GFF_fortify_possible_targets_desc:0 "[GFFortifyDesc]"
 GFF_fortify_possible_targets_desc_first:0 "After the operation against Virgil's raiders, Muck organised with the minister of defence plans to fortify some towns and cities with the presence of the rich who found it cheaper to own houses in the Frontier instead of Nova Griffonia."
 GFF_fortify_possible_targets_desc_second:0 "After the disastrous operation against Virgil's raiders, the plans to fortify the towns and cities with the presence of the rich became insufficient. The minister of defence suggested using part of the remaining army volunteers to patrol these areas. Hopefully, the budget allocated is enough to pay for this new job of theirs."

 GFF_suspend_ministries:0 "Partial Government Shutdown"
 GFF_suspend_ministries_desc:0 "With the funding for the governmental duties of the Frontier draining, Muck had no choice but to shut down some of the least critical ministries to save money."

 GFF_clean_commie_propaganda:0 "Crackdown on Commie Propaganda"
 GFF_clean_commie_propaganda_desc:0 "Fighting is useless if the Maximalists can attract many of the people to their cause, which not only makes it hard for the population to sympathise with the government but also makes the jobs of cracking them down more difficult. The militias will now have the explicit order to remove any type of propaganda of these communists."

 GFF_open_the_emergency_reserve:0 "Open the Emergency Vault"
 GFF_open_the_emergency_reserve_desc:0 "The emergency vault doesn't live up entirely to its name as it was always opened due to the funding constantly draining, which nowadays was more and more the norm. It will provide enough money to keep running the country while Muck is away to Weter."

 GFF_multitasking:0 "Accumulate Governmental Functions"
 GFF_multitasking_desc:0 "The suspension of ministries, while necessary, leaves some services down and withholds salaries of the workers under said services. As per protocol, the functions of the suspended ministries will be reassigned to the remaining cabinet members. Sure, it will be a bureaucratic mess, but there isn't much choice."

 GFF_the_dreaded_request:0 "The Dreaded Groveling"
 GFF_the_dreaded_request_desc:0 "At last, Muck will travel to Weter to convince Teafeather to provide more funds. He always dreaded this day, as it always seemed that his pleas to stop the funding from decreasing fell on deaf ears. But, if he plays his cards right, hopefully, the predictable failure won't happen."

 ### IDEAS ##################################
 ###########################################

 ## Initial Ideas ##

 GFF_bandits:0 "The Bandit Issue"
 GFF_bandits_desc:0 "Ever since the Frontier's economy stagnated, poverty became one of the biggest concerns of our administration, which led to our resource distribution networks. However, as said networks proved to be more of a short-term solution when many towns reported getting no help, with the richest being safe from the consequences, bandits appeared left and right to survive, with their tactics of raiding and control further destabilising the country.\n\nOne of these groups is from a griffon called Virgil, known for being one of the few bandit leaders that raid the richest to genuinely distribute it all to the poor, which makes any town that we were unable to help resistant to any attempts of the administration to take back control.\n\nIncreasing our efforts in hunting them down would just risk alienating our people. If the administration wants to run them out, they need to find a way to properly distribute the necessary resources."

 GFF_cannibals:0 "The Mountains of Madness"
 GFF_cannibals_desc:0 "The region is not foreign to difficulties in finding or growing food. The majority of the land being mountains made logistics hard to establish or find land suitable to agriculture. The yak natives got used to it though and, through luck and skill, the region became more self-sufficient.\n\nBut the griffon settlers paid the price as they tried to live deeper in the mountains.\n\nThe climate was colder than what any griffon is used to and, despite knowing how to fly, navigating through the region became a challenge, leading to some even getting lost, even when construction works made some areas more acessible. And, as hunger and despair became the norm, many found the only way to save themselves from death: Cannibalism.\n\nThese cannibal clans are terrorising many villages to get ANYTHING to eat, leading to some of the places turning into ghost towns or, in the worst case scenario, some join the cannibal lifestyle as they had similar struggles to the clans. They even had a long time ago caused issues with the yaks of the bordering nation, which our overlords had to step in before the diplomatic incident turned into a war.\n\nWe can't let history repeat a second time."

 GFF_commies:0 "Maximalist Expatriates"
 GFF_commies_desc:0 "Years ago, Nova Griffonia almost fell to communists that were inspired by the revolution in Stalliongard. Despite their futile attempts, our overlords stomped out these rebels and, together with the normalisation of relations with the more moderates, we could be sure that the communists wouldn't terrorise any further.\n\nBut we would be forced to bite our tongues as reports of communist rebels taking over some villages came to our desk. And worse: We suspect that most were part of the overlord's attempted coup. While we are able to fend them off, for now, many villages started to sympathize with the communist cause.\n\nThe leader of the communist rebels is unknown to us and their guerrilla patterns are not consistent, making the job harder. But that won't make us give up on cracking them down and send them back to our overlords so that justice can be delivered to them."

 GFF_economic_chaos:0 "Economic Recession"
 GFF_economic_chaos_desc:0 "Our current funding has almost drained, way earlier than planned, and it's already causing issues ranging from the salaries of our garrison to the efficiency of our resource distribution networks. Getting more money isn't just urgent. It's necessary so that the so-called "constitutional anarchy" doesnt turn into a literal anarchy."

 ## STARTING TREE IDEAS ##

 GFF_resource_networking:0 "Resource Distribution Networks"
 GFF_resource_networking_desc:0 "With the funding provided to the Frontier decreasing year by year, the necessity of a stable system to help the poorest of the state grew. So, in 984, Governor Burner announced the foundation of the Frontier's Resource Distribution Networks, intending to expand the range they can reach to provide the people with the necessities: Food, clothes, water and so on. In the first year, the networks became a huge success, which allowed for the reduction of poverty and a more equitable distribution.\n\nHowever, the cracks of this system started to appear as some towns reported having received no help from the administration yet. As months passed with no improvements, and a few villages even being emptied by either starvation or defection to cannibal clans, many started to criticise the system as unreliable long term. The fact that some of the richest that found it cheaper to live in the more remote areas are unaffected by this led to accusations of the administration misleading the people and the rise of bandits, with goals ranging from personal interests or giving back to the poor, both through raids.\n\nStill to this day, the networks saw no improvement. That has to end soon but unless more funds are provided, nothing can be done."

### EVENTS #################################
###########################################

 frontier.1.t:0 "Nothing Special"
 frontier.1.d:0 "In the past, the yearly meetings were something that Muck would wait for. A recap of their progress in growing the city or region, being validated by the people's cheers when he walked around. However, the Frontier killed any relief that he would have had, with him not even needing to read the reports provided by his cabinet to know what was wrong.\n\n"Sadly, our funds are running out again. We had expected it to last for..." The finance minister checks his papers. "-almost a year." He put down his papers, as the rest of the cabinet either groaned, yawned or sighed. "We are lucky to last around 4 months... unless we get more funds from the Governor..."\n\n"We can't sustain this!" The defence minister shouted, slamming his claws on the table. "I've repeatedly argued that we should have let Nova Griffonia handle the communists, bandits, and cannibals ruining this region. And guess what? Money wasted due to incompetence!"\n\n"And because the militias aren't paid properly!" The labour minister countered, rolling her eyes. "You don't feed griffons with words and guns. These funds should have been more focused on distributing the people's needs-" The defence minister cut her off. "How if we are constantly thwarted by these threats?!?"\n\nThe room erupted in an uproar, with all ministers voicing their concerns about what other way they should have allocated the funds. Muck just sighed, shaking his head and squinting at the blurry reports."
 frontier.1.a:0 "Nothing that he isn't used to"

 frontier.4.t:0 "The Hideout"
 frontier.4.d:0 "The militias of Neu Eindlem, in the region of Uulin Griffins, together with volunteers from the capital, were tasked with retaking a mountain area close to the town after receiving news of a huge presence of raiders, especially from Virgil. They isolated the area to avoid any travellers from being killed by mistake and went deep into the mountains with a lot of supplies.\n\nAs they approached the area, it already didn't smell good, as a nearby camp was a mess, with half-finished meals on the ground and coins scattered at a few tents, one of which was open. While first faking to leave, in case rebels were inside, the militias confirmed nobody was there.\n\nIt took a while for the raiders' operation site to be reached, with empty rifles on the ground greeting the militias. It barely had any sign of life, as the few barracks present in the area were broken into and confirmed to be empty, with nothing more than broken windows.\n\nIt was clear that the operation was a failure. Before the militias could discuss how to proceed, a gunshot echoed from the higher mountains, putting them on high alert and checking the perimeter... only for cannibals, having been scared by the gunshot, to meet them and try to get them as their dinner. The group had to be rescued by other militias when the former hadn't returned for hours."
 frontier.4.a:0 "The luck is that the only deaths were from cannibals"

 frontier.7.t:0 "A Perfect Plan"
 frontier.7.d:0 "Two sets of explosive, placed strategically to fell a pair of trees on the road. One in front to stop the gun truck, one behind to prevent a reverse. In the trees on either side of the road two four griff teams of militia lie in wait. Ready to pop out the second the commies show their beaks. Arrest the driver, take the guns, and deal a crippling blows to the revolutionaries. All-in-all, a perfect plan, all they need to do is wait for the truck to appear.\n\nThus they wait.\nAnd they wait.\nAnd they wait some more.\n\nThe hours slowly tick by as the militiagriffs begin to grow restless. Occasionally popping their heads up and being yelled at to get back in cover, or wandering off to stretch their legs. When their canteens finally run out so does the yelling for discipline. Empty clawed after nearly half a day of waiting they abandon their posts with nothing to show for the warning about the truck and the countless hours spent in the frigid cold waiting for it. All except one, who seems rather unbothered about the time he just wasted."
 frontier.7.a:0 "Did they get a warning about our warning?"

 frontier.8.t:0 "Nova Griffonia Proposes a Truce" # TO BE REWRITTEN LATER
 frontier.8.d:0 "Teafeather and his cronies have been trying to put us down for months, but his troops can't compare to our experienced raiders. We've been pushing them back for a while, and soon after a messenger had arrived, asking to discuss terms of truce. On first sight, it seems pretty great for us - peace, independence, recognition and all of our territory, but on the other claw, why would they ask for truce if they weren't close to losing? The boss thinks we should take all of Nova Griffonia right now, but the other bandit leaders believe it would be more wiser to take the deal so we can build up for the next confrontation."
 frontier.8.a:0 "You can have your damned peace, Teafeather."

 frontier.10.t:0 "Report on Local Mineral Extraction"
 frontier.10.d:0 "Papers pile up on the desk before Muck. Everyday his ministers add a new stack. Each one a whole new story of how Frosthill is rushing into the red financially. Nothing out of the ordinary from last year, and the years before. Nothing that can't be handled if the mines just- A knock at the door breaks Muck's train of thought. "Come in!" He calls.\n\nThe door creaks open and in steps the Manager of the local coal mining operation. In his claw a slim vanilla folder. Without wasting any time the Manager steps forward and holds the folder out. Reluctantly, Muck takes it and flips the cover open to reveal startlingly few sheets of paper inside.\n\n"Where's the rest of your report?" Muck says as he skims through the folder. "Typically you have enough to keep me up through the night, but this looks like it'll barely take me five minutes to read."\n\n"That's all there is." The Manager's tone grim.\n\nHe looks up at the Griffin, staring in disbelief  "No... Surely not. There has to be something in those mountains we can show off to Weter."\n\n"I'm sorry, Muck. I've gone down into the depths myself and we've pulled everything we can out of the ground."\n\nAn uneasy silence fills the air as Muck sinks back into his chair, dropping the folder onto his desk to join the rest. That's the only card he had for the meeting in Weter and now it's gone.\n\n"Well, I'll catch up with you later then." Muck's voice low as he clasps his claws together. "No point in having the full meeting anymore. I have some options I need to look into." As the Manager turns to leave Muck rests his head on his claws. Wondering what he's going to have to do to convince Teafeather the Frontier is worth turning on the money spigot for again."

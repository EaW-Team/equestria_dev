BAK_communists_win_desc:0 "The ponies have spoken: they are sick of the exploitation of the working class, and have demanded true social and economic equality for all! It is now up to us to achieve this, in accordance with the theories of the great Caramel Marks."
BAK_communists_in_government:0 "The Social Revolution"
BAK_communists_in_government_desc:0 "Now that we are in control of the government, it is imperative that we take steps to guide the development of socialism in Bakara. This will not be a straightforward process, as many voices within the ZDS advocate making ideological adaptations and significant departures from Marksist-Stallionist orthodoxy."
BAK_dealing_with_reactonaries:0 "A Dagger in the Dark"
BAK_dealing_with_reactonaries_desc:0 "We must act swiftly to deal with reactionary elements within the Bakaran government. If left alone, these elements may plot to undermine the rule of the working class and foment counter-revolution."
BAK_rehabilitation_and_cooperation:0 "Mercy, Rehabilitation and Cooperation"
BAK_rehabilitation_and_cooperation_desc:0 "Although members of the more moderate parties opposed us during the election, they are not our true enemies. Many of them share our aim of improving conditions for the working class. There is no reason why we can not work with them in government to improve society."
BAK_to_the_work_camps:0 "Organise the GUT" #Glavna Uprava Tabora/Main Administration of Camps
BAK_to_the_work_camps_desc:0 "Socially dangerous elements still infest our government and wider political system; these disloyal elements must be isolated and neutralised. Corrective labour camps shall be established under the supervision of the Glavna Uprava Tabora (Main Administration of Camps), and will serve as a means of reeducation for disruptive ponies."
BAK_coopt_the_military:0 "A Slap on the Hoof"
BAK_coopt_the_military_desc:0 "Some within the military have voiced skepticism towards socialism in the past, but many other officers have expressed support towards our agenda. As long as we refrain from initiating any bloody reprisals, we will be able to gradually co-opt the military and turn them into a solidly loyal force."
BAK_purge_the_military:0 "The Little Black Book"
BAK_purge_the_military_desc:0 "As long as the Bakaran military maintains an independent ideology and power base, they will represent an unacceptable threat to the development of socialism. This threat can only be eliminated by purging disloyal elements from the officer corps and enforcing ideological orthodoxy from the top down. Publishing a book of quotations from President Bray Foam and distributing it widely would be a good start."
BAK_party_democracy:0 "Party Democracy"
BAK_party_democracy_desc:0 "We should not place restrictions on how the political parties in our new socialist utopia shall operate, doing so would deprive citizens of their well-earned freedoms! We trust that our people will be smart and will select those who only wish to improve the nation and guide the party towards a brighter socialist future. Of course, Bray Foam will still remain as chairman, though. Just to oversee the process."
BAK_military_commissars:0 "Found the VK" #Vojaški komisariat/Military commissariat
BAK_military_commissars_desc:0 "Surveillance of the civilian populace is a tactic of oppressive regimes that deny their people freedom. Surveillance of the military, however, is a necessary precaution against reactionaries and capitalists from using our national strength against us. We already encountered this problem with that damned Admiral, and we should take precautions to make sure we never need to deal with something similar again."
BAK_secret_service:0 "Create the UNV" #Uprava za nacionalno varnost/National Security Administration
BAK_secret_service_desc:0 "While we have risen to power by the will of the people, our nation is still filled to the brim with anti-revolutionaries and reactionary scum. As we saw in the case of Admiral Cobalt Wind, the capitalist scum who opposed our rise to power were more than happy to unite behind a military strongmare who would steal our citizen's new freedom."
BAK_judicial_socialisation:0 "Judical Socialisation"
BAK_judicial_socialisation_desc:0 "Bakara's republican legal codes are severely out of date for a modern society, and especially for a socialist one. We shall embark on a campaign of legal reform entrenching socialist policy in our legal system so that it will remain with our nation for many generations to come."
BAK_socialist_culture:0 "The Cultural Revolution"
BAK_socialist_culture_desc:0 "While Bakara's traditions of Republicanism are something socialists can look back on with pride, it is tainted by the effects of years of capitalist control and the evil influence of foreign powers who saw our system as a threat. With a few choice edits, we can offer an image of our republican past as one destined for socialism from the beginning, and that we continue that legacy."
BAK_economic_reorganisation:0 "The Economic Revolution"
BAK_economic_reorganisation_desc:0 "It is time to embark on our great economic reform of the nation! Socialism shall, of course, be the main focus, but branching out from there, we have many paths regarding how to proceed. Marksist-Stallionist orthodoxy dictates we ready our weapons for the inevitable great conflict, but Bakara is deeply in need of more civilian goods. How we proceed is ultimately up to Bray."
BAK_homes_for_the_people:0 "Nopony Left Behind"
BAK_homes_for_the_people_desc:0 "One of the great issues that has plagued Bakara recently is its rapidly growing population. Nowadays, there is a large urban class that is either homeless or living on the very edge of bankruptcy. We draw a large base of support from this class, and so it is time we address their needs. New housing and social programs shall be implemented to assist these poor citizens."
BAK_peoples_railways:0 "Found the LKI" #Ljudski komisariat za infrastrukturu/People's Commissariat For Infrastructure
BAK_peoples_railways_desc:0 "Another pressing issue for all Bakarans is the lack of paved roads across the country. Being a seafaring people, many of the inland regions are underdeveloped, and some citizens are disconnected from the rest of society. This is something that the new "People's Commissariat For Infrastructure" will work to address for the prosperity of all Bakarans."
BAK_educating_the_populace:0 "Revolutionary Science"
BAK_educating_the_populace_desc:0 "Science and knowledge are one of the great backbones of our revolution! As our citizens learn more and more about the greatness of socialism and the successes of its political and economic system, our nation shall grow stronger by the day."
BAK_the_materialist_manifesto:0 "Adopt the Materialist Manifesto"
BAK_the_materialist_manifesto_desc:0 "One of the final steps in our remaking of Bakaran society is finding a new basis for which we found our nation. Now that our ancient republican traditions have been damaged by the actions of reactionaries and tyrants, we must rebuild our societal image. And the idea of Socialist materialism is a good start, we shall value material progress made by our society over all other things."
BAK_the_economic_plan:0 "Reorganising the Economy"
BAK_the_economic_plan_desc:0 "As we move towards our socialist economic model, we need to decide on a direction towards which we shall aim our economy. Two ponies have each produced a plan of their own, and it is time to decide between them."
BAK_planned_economy:0 "Centralised Planning"
BAK_planned_economy_desc:0 "Orthodox revolutionary policy recommends a state-directed economic model from which we can better gear the nation up to increase production and streamline needless industrial bureaucracy. We must embrace this model for the good of the revolution as a whole, and what is good for the revolution shall be for the benefit of the people as a whole!"
BAK_worker_self_managment:0 "Worker Self Managment"
BAK_worker_self_managment_desc:0 "By employing a policy of industrial self-management, we can ensure that the workers in our factories are happy and productive. After all, the industrial state exists to benefit the workers not to oppress them. This may deviate us from the party line slightly, but we are sure we know what is good for the workers of Bakara."
BAK_collectivisation:0 "Collectivisation"
BAK_collectivisation_desc:0 "The efficiency of Bakara's agricultural production would be greatly increased if multiple farmers could be compelled to run their holdings as a joint enterprise. For the good of all citizens, we must implement a policy to integrate all individual landholding and labour into collectively-controlled farms."
BAK_agricultural_unions:0 "Cooperation"
BAK_agricultural_unions_desc:0 "Instead of embarking on a foolhardy program of economic repression, we must allow our citizens the freedom to self-organise and control their own destinies. Agricultural Unions should be allowed to form to protect and enhance the economic well-being and quality of life for farmers and their rural communities."
BAK_full_nationalisation:0 "All to the State!"
BAK_full_nationalisation_desc:0 "Guaranteeing the ascendency of the proletariat will require the nationalisation of all industries and the introduction of strict centralised management. The economic elite have had their run of oppression and exploitation for long enough. It's time we expropriate the expropriators!"
BAK_limited_nationalisation:0 "Selective Nationalisation"
BAK_limited_nationalisation_desc:0 "Although it is called for by orthodox doctrine, complete nationalisation of all sectors of the economy would be far too disruptive to Bakaran society. Fortunately, we can still attain close to the desired effect with the nationalisation of a few key industries."
BAK_coopt_capitalists:0 "Coerce the Capitalists"
BAK_coopt_capitalists_desc:0 "Utilising such crude methods as forced dispossession would anger many and surely lead to massive resistance; a softer touch is called for. There is much that can be gained if we persuade the capitalists to help us of their own accord, using the threat of expropriation to motivate them."
BAK_the_split:0 "The Foam-Haze Split"
BAK_the_split_desc:0 "Bray Foam has bravely led us down a more compassionate path then the one demanded by harsh orthodoxy, bringing peace and prosperity to Bakara. But we can not close our ears to what is happening under Haze's dictatorship, nor the suffering of so many ponies. We have no choice but to accept the truth: Haze must be dealt with, for the good of the World Revolution."
BAK_passing_the_torch:0 "The Passing of the Torch"
BAK_passing_the_torch_desc:0 "It is a tragedy that Caramel Haze was not able to put Marksist-Stallionist theories into practice himself. However, as long as we breathe, we will carry on his legacy and work tirelessly to bring about the liberation of all workers in the Riverlands. For Comrade Haze!"
BAK_maintain_orthodoxy:0 "Revolutionary Orthodoxy"
BAK_maintain_orthodoxy_desc:0 "Rejoice! Through our efforts and dedication we have transformed Bakara into a perfect realisation of Caramel Marks' revolutionary theories. Now, all that remains is for us to join hooves with Comrade Haze himself and work together to create a better future for every working pony."
BAK_war_of_liberation:0 "The Great Patriotic War of Unification"
BAK_war_of_liberation_desc:0 "Thus far, only a fraction of Riverlanders have been liberated from the chains of economic exploitation and political oppression; the forces of reaction still hold domain over the rest of the Riverlands. This cannot be allowed to stand any longer! Down with the old order, up with the workers!"
BAK_proclaim_union:0 "The Triumphant Revolution"
BAK_proclaim_union_desc:0 "It was inevitable that our righteous cause would shatter the fragile tyranny of the Riverlands' corrupt old rulers, and so it did. Now workers across the Riverlands stand together in solidarity, in the United Socialist River Republics!"
BAK_unite_the_army:0 "Unite the Armies"
BAK_unite_the_army_desc:0 "The armies of the formerly independent Riverlander states will have to be integrated as soon as possible. This will be no easy task, as difficulties related to linguistic differences or old political rivalries are just a few of the obstacles we must account for."
BAK_unite_the_culture:0 "Pan-Riverpony Ethos"
BAK_unite_the_culture_desc:0 "The old corrupt rulers of the Riverlands did their best to keep us separated and stymie the development of a Riverlands-wide identity. This shall no longer be the case. We must take steps to nurture a shared culture and promote working class unity across the land."
BAK_destroy_reactionaries:0 "Destroy the Reactionaries"
BAK_destroy_reactionaries_desc:0 "In order to preserve the accomplishments of the Revolution and guarantee the security of our nation, decisive actions must be taken against all enemies of social progress. Whatever their motivation, wherever they hide and scheme, we will find them."
BAK_integrate_economies:0 "Integrate the Economies"
BAK_integrate_economies_desc:0 "The scars of war can still be seen all across the land. Repairing the damage will require fully integrating the disparate Riverlander economies, and transitioning them towards socialism away from their previous, inferior economic systems."
BAK_stronghold_of_socialism:0 "The Stronghold of Socialism"
BAK_stronghold_of_socialism_desc:0 "Our efforts have transformed the Riverlands into a strong and eternal union, a beacon of hope for all historically oppressed classes. Let it be known that the USRR stands firm against exploitation and oppression, and will forever be a force for justice in the world!"
BAK_strike_hillponies:0 "Liberate the Hillponies"
BAK_strike_hillponies_desc:0 "Although we have brought peace and prosperity to many, the ponies to our north still suffer and languish beneath oppression. These primitive and backwards hillponies would benefit greatly from integration into our Union."
BAK_strike_frontier:0 "The Iron Curtain"
BAK_strike_frontier_desc:0 "We Riverponies require a buffer to combat the growing threat of Griffonian Imperialism. The lands to our west are vulnerable and ripe for the taking, they will prove invaluable in the effort to fortify our nation against griffon aggression."
BAK_strike_south:0 "Liberate the Estuary"
BAK_strike_south_desc:0 "To our south lie a chaotic collection of misguided creatures toiling in confusion. It is our duty to help the lower classes of these lands by advancing their societies. If it requires crushing their tyrannical leaders to accomplish this, then so be it!"
BAK_a_greater_union:0 "A Greater Union"
BAK_a_greater_union_desc:0 "Under the impeccable leadership of Bray Foam, we have forged a union greater than anypony could have imagined, free from economic exploitation and political oppression.

BAK_fascists_win:0 "The Rise of the BFZ"
BAK_fascists_win_desc:0 "The ponies have spoken! Having heard our promise, they have given us an unambiguous mandate to purge the chronic weakness and corruption from the Bakaran government. Our task now is making good on that promise, which we must do if we are to bring true justice to the Riverlands."
BAK_on_the_matters_of_economics:0 "On the Matters of Economics..."
BAK_on_the_matters_of_economics_desc:0 "Social and political instability has left the economy teetering on the brink of disaster.

BAK_state_unions:0 "Create the NZD" #Nacionalno združenje delavcev/National Worker Association
BAK_state_unions_desc:0 "It is time we did something about the troublesome trade unions; their socialist agitation has been extremely disruptive to the Bakaran economy. Rather than having multiple independent trade unions, there should be only one labour organisation under the direct control of the government, so that we may better harmonise the interests of workers and businesses."
BAK_price_controls:0 "Implementing Price Controls"
BAK_price_controls_desc:0 "The recent turbulence has seen prices for common household items spiral to absurdly high levels. We can not allow the exploitation of ponies by these greedy speculators to continue! Price controls will put a stop to such practices, while also helping to curb the threat of inflation."
BAK_militarise_economy:0 "Economic Militarism"
BAK_militarise_economy_desc:0 "Our task ahead demands that we reject the decadence of the old Bakaran status quo and militarise the economy. Beyond guaranteeing the security of our nation, an increase in military spending will boost our prosperity and raise the employment rate, due to increased demand."
BAK_scientific_advancement:0 "Restoring The Bakaran Academia"
BAK_scientific_advancement_desc:0 "As we strive towards creating a dynamic and modern society, we must not neglect the role of education. Achieving industrial and technological progress will not be possible if we fail to invest in universities and research institutes."
BAK_corporatism:0 "Corporatism"
BAK_corporatism_desc:0 "Utilizing corporate groups, the economy can be collectively managed by employers, workers, and state officials at the national level. Corporatism can better reconcile divergent interests into the state organically, leading to harmonious functioning and greater efficiency."
BAK_the_industrial_council:0 "The Grand Industrial Council"
BAK_the_industrial_council_desc:0 "We must recognise the importance of private initiative in organising society: the Grand Industrial Council shall be a body for representatives of all sectors of the economy to meet and resolve problems. This form of collective self-regulation will be far more effective than arbitrary government decrees."
BAK_massive_industrial_help:0 "Our Friends in the Factories"
BAK_massive_industrial_help_desc:0 "The Industrial Council has done an excellent job steering the economy, and many ponies on the Council have massively increased their wealth. Good for them! Hopefully these businessponies have not forgotten that private interests must always be subordinated to the interests of the nation."
BAK_on_the_matters_of_politics:0 "On the Matters of Politics..."
BAK_on_the_matters_of_politics_desc:0 "Our victory in the recent election must not make us complacent, there is still much work to be done. The rebirth of Bakara can not be accomplished without spreading the message of our new revolutionary civilisational order to every sector of society."
BAK_fascist_parliamentarism:0 "Reforming Parliament"
BAK_fascist_parliamentarism_desc:0 "We must tweak the rules of Parliament and change the electoral system to more accurately reflect the will of the ponies. Shifting away from proportional representation and towards majority representation will allow us to further solidify our control."
BAK_political_assistance:0 "Our Friends in the Capitol"
BAK_political_assistance_desc:0 "Thanks to savvy political manoeuvring, BFZ delegates are completely dominating Parliament! Their success in governing has left our enemies demoralised and incapable of putting up coordinated opposition. We should take this time to enlist their aid in furthering our larger project of national rebirth."
BAK_mixed_economics:0 "Good Old Fashioned Economic Principles"
BAK_mixed_economics_desc:0 "Rather than pursuing a radical and untested economic policy, we should stick with a stable blend of public and private enterprise. Using elements of both market and planned economies will allow us to best mediate between labour and business to promote national unity."
BAK_national_political_machine:0 "The National Political Machine"
BAK_national_political_machine_desc:0 "The political operatives of the BFZ performed admirably in the run-up to the election of 1007, but the complete renewal of Bakara will be an even more demanding task. The BFZ political machine must be restructured to gear it towards operating at a national level."
BAK_expand_radio_stations:0 "Officialise Radio Bakarska Enotnost"
BAK_expand_radio_stations_desc:0 "Radio Bakarska Enotnost is a vital tool for inspiring the ponies of Bakara and promoting national and social unity. Every citizen should be able to tune in on their radio and hear the call to action when the time comes to defend their nation!"
BAK_legitimise_blackshirts:0 "Legitimise the Kovačinaši"
BAK_legitimise_blackshirts_desc:0 "The Kovačinaši is the best organisation for self-defence available for all patriotic Bakarans. However, as an extension of the BFZ, it is currently merely paramilitary. We have it in our power to make the Kovačinaši an officially recognised and supported militia organisation, which would greatly boost its prestige and power."
BAK_anti_communism:0 "Beating Back the Hydra of Socialism"
BAK_anti_communism_desc:0 "We must take a hard-line stance against the Marksist-Stallionists and their materialist nonsense. Their misguided focus on class identity is nothing less than a rejection of the emotional and spiritual bonds that hold our nation together. In the name of national solidarity, this ideology can no longer be tolerated!"
BAK_proper_autarky:0 "Autarky"
BAK_proper_autarky_desc:0 "A strong nation must strive to stand on its own economically. Relying on our external assistance or international trade rather than our own resources would be pure folly. Limiting trade and attaining self-sufficiency is critical to maintaining our national security."
BAK_riverlands_the_nation:0 "Riverlands the Nation"
BAK_riverlands_the_nation_desc:0 "The Riverlands' petty and short-sighted leaders have long suppressed the Riverlander identity that binds us all together. And so it becomes our duty to revive the idea of a single nation to unite and renew the Riverlands. A single nation, to cleanse the Riverlands of decadence and tyranny!"
BAK_literally_the_ORPO:0 "Found the NP" #Naročite policija/Order Police
BAK_literally_the_ORPO_desc:0 "Traditionally, law enforcement in Bakara has been a local matter. This lack of centralised leadership and coordination has opened the possibility for chaos and disorder to spread rapidly. We must create an organisation to absorb all the police departments and get them under the control of the central government."
BAK_selective_philosophy:0 "Adapt the Way of the Waves"
BAK_selective_philosophy_desc:0 "Heavily influenced by our proximity to the sea, the Bakaran philosophical tradition has long emphasised the importance of resilience and social cohesion. We should do more to promote these ideas across facets of society, so all citizens might share a common way of thinking."
BAK_the_war:0 "A Flame the Ages Shall Not Extinguish!"

BAK_proclaim_union_fascist_desc:0 "Glorious triumph! We have emerged from our great struggle having struck down all the unjust and illegitimate governments of the Riverlands.

BAK_unite_the_culture_fascist_desc:0 "The old corrupt rulers of the Riverlands did their best to keep us separated and stymie the development of pan-Riverlander identity. This shall no longer be the case. We must take steps to nurture a shared culture and promote Riverlander unity."

BAK_strike_south_fascist_desc:0 "The lands to our south are infested with dangerous renegades, savages and illegitimate states.

BAK_a_greater_union_fascist_desc:0 "Under the strong leadership of Firm Scow, we have forged a union greater than anypony could have imagined, cleansed of decadence and unpatriotic materialism.

BAK_regulate_big_business_desc:0 "Bakara is home to many rich companies which form the backbone of the economy. But although they are capable of doing good, we must also take steps to ensure they act responsibly.

BAK_national_railways:0 "The Ebony Transportation Plan"
BAK_national_railways_desc:0 "Historically, railway systems throughout the Riverlands developed as separate privately owned companies operating regional networks, which has led to an overall level of infrastructure that is spotty at best.

BAK_devolve_government:0 "Amending the Constitution"
BAK_devolve_government_desc:0 "Bakara's current constitution, although it has served us reasonably well over the years, contains a number of flaws we must rectify if we are to stabilise the nation. Its degree of administrative centralisation is far too high, being both inefficient and a recipe for future tyranny. Increasing regional autonomy will empower local governments and give more control back to the people."
BAK_nightwatchpony_state:0 "Night-Watchpony State"
BAK_nightwatchpony_state_desc:0 "We recognise that the ideal state is one whose powers are limited and minimal, whose main functions are to provide its citizens with a military, police force, and courts to protect them from aggression, theft, and fraud.

BAK_encourage_entepanourship:0 "The Entrepreneur Spirit"
BAK_encourage_entepanourship_desc:0 "Bakarans have always been willing to take risks, recognising the value of initiative and creativity in the pursuit of profit.

BAK_block_coalition_focuses:0 "Throw a Wrench into the Works"
BAK_block_coalition_focuses_desc:0 "As the nations of the Coalition continue to grow ever closer, we must not let our partners get too hasty.

BAK_restrict_the_POS_desc:0 "The Pomorska Obveščevalna Služba (Naval Intelligence Service) is supposed to be responsible for reporting on the developments and activities of foreign navies and monitoring maritime threats. However, a recent trend has seen POS agents become overzealous and begin to overstep their authority.

BAK_townhall_democracy:0 "Town Hall Democracy"
BAK_townhall_democracy_desc:0 "Politicians have a bad habit of becoming disconnected from their constituents after being elected.

BAK_increase_army_wages:0 "Increase Army Wages"
BAK_increase_army_wages_desc:0 "All throughout the election of 1007, there were whispers of insurrectionary plots being hatched among certain elements of the military.

BAK_naval_intelligence_desc:0 "The Pomorska Obveščevalna Služba, our Navy intelligence service, has until now been relegated to military service and taking care of crime off our shorelines.

Only the POS can handle this responsibility."

BAK_political_prisoner_camps_desc:0 "The violent dissidents living under our regime are still Bakarans at heart, and while their leadership will surely meet their judgment day, the common pony has really done nothing wrong except be brainwashed by subversive ideologies. In this way, we shall create centres for reeducation of arrested enemies where they can do their service to the state and relearn what a good government is."
BAK_labour_camps:0 "Rehabilitation Through Labour"
BAK_labour_camps_desc:0 "Those ponies in our camps will provide industrial labour service to the government in exchange for their basic needs being provided for, as well as classes on political "philosophy".

BAK_penal_brigades:0 "Rehabilitation Through Patriotic Service" #Penal Brigades
BAK_penal_brigades_desc:0 "Creating military units out of political dissidents may seem like an odd idea, but it will allow them to work for their freedom, and hopefully, it will instill within them a pride for their nation as well as a desire to serve in the future as well.

BAK_mobilise_the_troops:0 "Sic the Hounds"
BAK_mobilise_the_troops_desc:0 "One of our strongest bases of support to restore order in Bakara has been our professional Marine Corps, along with a few of the most disciplined militias.

BAK_absorb_the_fascists:0 "Tea Time With Firm Scow"
BAK_absorb_the_fascists_desc:0 "While we do have a base of support amongst the military and some of the most anti-communist factions of our society, we still lack national prestige.

BAK_target_harmonists:0 "The Truncheon and the Carrot"
BAK_target_harmonists_desc:0 "Through her time at the Admiralty, Cobalt Wind has learned a few key things about discipline and order. When dealing with rowdy sailors, she soon learned the power of the truncheon and how to organise and discipline disorderly ponies, and reward those who did their duties well. We can apply the same ideas to dealing with the former regime's officials. The choice between the carrot or the truncheon is theirs."
BAK_national_progress:0 "The Four Modernisations Initiative"
BAK_national_progress_desc:0 "In order for Bakara to defend itself and preserve its national honour, we must modernise our national infrastructure.

BAK_focus_on_civlians:0 "Technology and Industry"
BAK_focus_on_civlians_desc:0 "The civilian sector of our economy runs on outdated technology and old ideas about industrial production. Part of the modernisation plan involves expansion of public transport and national subsidies for new industrial sectors. It is time to bring Bakara further into the second millennium and ensure our people never want for the essentials of life."
BAK_focus_on_military:0 "Defence and Agriculture"
BAK_focus_on_military_desc:0 "Right now, a large part of the government budget goes towards maintaining the military in its state of high prestige and de-facto rulership. So it makes sense then that the economy should be directed at supporting the military. New defence manufacturing jobs will pay good wages for workers, and new agricultural subsidies will make sure our soldiers are never hungry."
BAK_work_with_corporations:0 "State Capitalism"
BAK_work_with_corporations_desc:0 "Cooperation with national corporations will ensure the nation always has an abundance of necessary goods for both the civilian population and the military.

BAK_emergency_powers:0 "The Emergency Powers Act" #Legitimizes Cobalt Wind's Dictatorship
BAK_emergency_powers_desc:0 "The crisis we face is not yet over, and holding elections at this time would gravely threaten Bakara's stability. It is plain to see that maintaining a durable nation requires strong central authority, and so Admiral Cobalt Wind must be empowered to take all necessary actions to maintain peace and order, including unilaterally enacting laws."
BAK_facade_democracy:0 "Media Integration"
BAK_facade_democracy_desc:0 "We must not ignore the power of the media to direct and manipulate the actions of the populace. If left unchecked, pamphlets and newspapers could be the downfall of our regime.

BAK_controlled_opposition:0 "Controlled Opposition"
BAK_controlled_opposition_desc:0 "Bakara's situation has stabilised to the point where we can now consider easing up the restrictions on public debate.

BAK_encourage_philosophy:0 "The Way of the Waves"
BAK_encourage_philosophy_desc:0 "In recent years, the Bakaran philosophical tradition has been neglected as ponies turned their eyes outwards towards the Riverlands.

BAK_execute_the_nobility:0 "Cull the Slavers"
BAK_execute_the_nobility_desc:0 "Now that we are in control of the mountains, we can put a permanent end to that singularly despicable institution of slavery.

BAK_slave_reparations:0 "Slavery Reparations"
BAK_slave_reparations_desc:0 "Although slavery has been abolished, the profound effects it has had on the social, political, and economic lives of the dogs still remains. If we fail to compensate the former slaves, this legacy of inequality will only grow with time, leaving them slaves in all but name. The Kaza-ar-Bark Republic must be compelled to pay reparations to all former slaves."
BAK_the_dog_republic:0 "The Kaza-ar-Bark Concordat"
BAK_the_dog_republic_desc:0 "Now that the fighting has ended decisively in our favour, a delegation of representatives from the dogs have arrived to negotiate the final post-war settlement.

BAK_farbrookian_infiltration:0 "Operation: Radio Silence"
BAK_farbrookian_infiltration_desc:0 "Taking any aggressive military action in the north runs the risk of us provoking retaliation from the River Coalition.

BAK_naval_expansion:0 "Blomsport Dockyard Expansion Scheme"
BAK_naval_expansion_desc:0 "The natural harbour at Blomsport is of great strategic and economic importance, having served that city well throughout its history.

Glory to the Republic, bringer of peace and security!"
BAK_operation_chitinfall:0 "Operation: Queenbreaker"

BAK_townhall_democracy_2_desc:0 "Politicians have a bad habit of becoming disconnected from their constituents after being elected. This divide only grows larger the longer they remain ensconced in the capital.

Citizens can now rest easy, knowing that the Republic shall endure!"
BAK_operation_chainbreaker_2:0 "Operation: Chainbreaker"
BAK_operation_chainbreaker_2_desc:0 "The slave society of [DMT.GetNameDef] is a blight on the Riverlands, standing as an unnatural bastion of inequality and tyranny. We must liberate the dogs from their state of misery and bring true democracy to the mountains! Our agents are already in place, and if we strike fast we can achieve victory before any of the dogs' allies even realise what's happened."
BAK_execute_the_nobility_2:0 "Cull the Slavers"
BAK_execute_the_nobility_2_desc:0 "Now that we are in control of the mountains, we can put a permanent end to that singularly despicable institution of slavery.

BAK_slave_reparations_2:0 "Slavery Reparations"
BAK_slave_reparations_2_desc:0 "Although slavery has been abolished, the profound effects it has had on the social, political, and economic lives of the dogs still remains.

BAK_expanding_the_definition_of_citizenship_2:0 "Equal Citizenship Act"
BAK_expanding_the_definition_of_citizenship_2_desc:0 "Regrettably, current Bakaran law is far too restrictive when it comes to the matter of citizenship.

BAK_officer_review:0 "Review the Officer Corps"
BAK_officer_review_desc:0 "The ranks of our army are riddled with under-qualified officers who owe their ranks to personal connections rather than genuine ability.

Their plan to restructure the Bakaran economy and liberate the working classes will be difficult to achieve, especially since they must simultaneously address the deep rifts that have been exposed in Bakaran society. Despite their victory, the ZDS platform is still feared and opposed by many, and it remains to be seen if Bray Form will be able to consolidate his party's position."

Now vaulted to the forefront of Bakara's political scene, their task now is putting their ambitious agenda into effect.

That they may never feel the weight of tyranny on their shoulders and may be free from the chains that still hold them!"\n\nBray Foam's continued speech brought on cheers and shouts from the assembled crowd of ponies in the dock district of Bakara city. ZDS rallies had recently intensified throughout the city in the runup to the 1007 election, setting many in the town on edge. As the communists rallied, other Bakaran citizens looked on in a mix of interest, curiosity, and fear.\n\nBray Foam's speech began to reach a crescendo, riling the crowd into even further frenzy\n\n"And so our nation may reforge itself in the flame of socialism and make for itself a new future in a nation, and eventually a coalition of our own making!"\n\nFoam's remarks about the coalition worried many in other segments of society, especially the merchant classes of the city. They warn the government to try to prohibit Foam from making many of these speeches again, advising his radical foreign policy may cause a rift with the nation's allies. But just as well, many politicians point to the enshrined right to public gatherings that Bakara holds, and that trying to clamp down on Foam may simply incite further violence.\n\nWhatever the choice is, the ZDS seems set to gain."

The closing remarks of the new BFZ radio show are worrying. They now functioned as a significant political force for the upcoming election, and this radio channel could spread their ideas and further normalize them to the public. The BFZ's meteoric rise threatened the establishment of both of Bakara's center parties, and they seemed to be going all out for the 1007 runoff. This radio show, for now only localized to the Bakara urban area, seemed to be one of their primary efforts.\n\nWater Lily faced a difficult choice. Let the show remain, and risk losing support in the election, but possibly damage her rivals in the BSP as well. Or she could put her hoof down, trying to limit the reach of the program, curtailing their scope to the broader Bakaran public, but also provoking more extreme responses in turn.\n\nBakara's democracy was certainly not in an enviable position."

Enflamed by a rumor that the ZDS was planning to hold a rally out front of the BFZ headquarters, Radio Bakarska Enotnost called on all of its supporters to coalesce at the party office, and the crowd obeyed the call.\n\nOnce there, the crowd milled about with no aim. The spontaneous counter-demonstration had nothing to act against, and so they created themselves a target, one earth pony in the crowd shouted,\n\n"If the reds won't come to us, let's go to them!"\n\nAnd so the march on 37 Codd street, the ZDS central office began. As news filtered across the city, various worker groups left their jobs and arrived at Codd street, and eventually, Bray Foam appeared as well. He called on all ZDS members to block the "destructive riot" from reaching Codd street.\n\nAnd at the same time, police units began to mobilize.\n\nAs the BFZ crowd approached Codd street, they came face to face along the intersection of Codd and Mareywether. By now, the police had arrived. But they stayed away from the heart of the protest not wishing to incite further violence.\n\nBut as the crowds came face to face, one colt picked up a rock, and threw. The BFZ began to advance, trying to push the ZDS back to their office, and police tried to keep order.\n\nOne last push is made by the advancing crowd to make it through, but at the end of the day..."

But I must be going now..."\n\n"What would you do then?" One reporter shouted from the crowd.\n\nTea Dip paused, "I suppose I would ask the Marines to intervene. I wonder if Miss Lily would have the courage to do that", "I mean you could ask her" the reporter snapped. Smiling softly to herself, Tea Dip replied, "That sounds like a great idea. Here's a story for your papers. I challenge Water Lily to civil debate on all matters of national policy. I hope to see her there."\n\nTea Dip trotted away to her car with the throng of reporters following her, only leaving the reporter that had questioned Tea Dip left. Looking out towards the vehicle driving away, Water Lily raised the brim on her hat, "A debate, huh? I guess that's how she is playing it." Putting her hat back down, she disappeared into the urban Bakaran night..."

bakara.9.d:0 "On a starry night in the capital, an enormous crowd of ponies gathered inside the Carrack Civic Centre to witness the grand debate between Water Lily and Tea Dip. Up on the stage, the two rivals stood behind opposite podiums, Tea Dip smiling and looking out at the crowd while Water Lily remained focused on her opponent. Between them sat the debate moderator, an old stallion and respected journalist. The moderator asked for the room to quiet, then cleared his throat. "Tea Dip, you have often criticised the current government for its allocation of spending. What would you prioritise in your administration?"\n\n"My foremost priority will always be protecting the citizens of Bakara and safeguarding their liberties. To guard against external threats, we absolutely need greater investments in national defence." Tea Dip paused as polite stomps rippled through the audience. "However, as far as the recent unrest goes, I am not afraid to say that fighting and riots in the streets are the product of our failed status quo. These angry ponies distrust a government that has made far too many promises and failed to keep them. It's only natural that it would be blamed when so many are plunged into economic deprivation. The cure for all of this is greater political and economic freedom. With liberty as our guide, we can unite and unleash the full potential of our nation!" Tea Dip brought a hoof down hard on the podium, drawing loud cheers from the crowd.\n\nAfter the raucous noise had died down, the moderator turned to Water Lily. "You may respond."\n\n"Where to begin? Let me start by saying that I, too, believe in liberty. But I also believe in fairness." Water Lily frowned and spoke with a solemn tone. "After all, unlimited freedom means the freedom of the strong to abuse the weak. And the freedom for the deprived to remain deprived, until they at last waste away from neglect. If my opponent is to be believed, freedom is the cure for all our ills. But let me remind you that an easy solution is very often not one at all. It is an unavoidable fact that solving our nation's problems will require a strong government that helps our citizens, not a weak one that leaves them to fend for themselves.""

The incident took place outside her residence in Vetailje, and the identity of the assailant is still unknown at this time. In response, BFZ candidate Firm Scow has released the following statement:\n\n"Rift Strain was a brave pony, outspoken in her love of liberty and an unflinching champion of the downtrodden, who was abruptly taken from us in a despicable and cowardly way. In light of this loss, we must not allow her cause to fade from our memories. She knew better than anypony that the River Coalition is not to be trusted. As she so famously wrote: 'It is a hypocritical institution not worthy of our faith, an institution which has given free reign to slavers and despots, and an institution which sits idly and stays silent while evil festers within it.'\n\n"She made it her mission to warn us that if we do nothing, there will come a time when all ponies of virtue are crushed beneath an iron hoof of injustice. Ponies like Tea Dip and Water Lily tragically refuse to heed this warning. And so it is my solemn pledge to Rift Strain's memory that, if elected, my first act will be to formally withdraw our Republic from the corrupt River Coalition, so that we may lay the foundation of a new, truly righteous order for the Riverlands.""

bakara.11.t:0 "The Funeral of Rift Strain"
bakara.11.d:0 "The city of Vetailje has become engulfed by violent protests as tensions which have been long simmering at last boiled over following the funeral of Rift Strain. An outspoken anti-communist, Rift Strain earned enmity from the ZDS for her dismissive reviews for the works of Caramel Marks, as well as for her connection to union busting activities in the course of her work as an industrial psychologist.\n\nFor such a divisive figure, many citizens expected that the procession might not go smoothly, and so it was no surprise when ponies sympathetic to the ZDS appeared to protest at the funeral. Their peaceful protest quickly turned ugly as armed militia members appeared on the side of the BFZ. The ensuing confrontation fortunately has not resulted in any deaths, but it is yet another symptom of Bakara's growing polarisation, and the nation is starkly divided as to which side should shoulder blame for the dust-up."
bakara.11.a:0 "So uncivilised..."

bakara.12.t:0 "The Condemnation"
bakara.12.d:0 "Although the recent chaos and unrest at Vetailje has died down, the question remains as to which side of the confrontation bears greater responsibility for the escalation. The populace awaits an official statement on the matter, and our verdict will have much weight for any ponies still sitting on the fence. It is our duty to consider this matter carefully and come to a fair conclusion.\n\nBFZ spokesponies have decried the protests at Rift Strain's funeral as inappropriate and hugely disrespectful to the family of the slain pony. Those sympathetic to the ZDS have countered that the BFZ was the first to politicise her death, claiming that the inflammatory statement released by Firm Scow immediately after Rift Strain's assassination was bound to provoke a response. The question for us remains: should we side with the BFZ and condemn the communists for organising the protest, or should we defend the ZDS as merely exercising their right to free expression?"

Tea Dip trotted around the stage, addressing her supporters at a packed rally in Coltovac Gornji. "I know Water Lily is a well meaning and honourable pony, but good intentions are no substitute for good leadership, and putting Bakarans first is what a good leader ought to do." Tea Dip gestured towards her audience in a wide sweeping motion. "What has happened to our great nation? The rising prominence of political extremists, ponies fighting in the streets! I come to tell you that this is all a result of Pan-Riverlandism gone too far." Forceful stomping of agreement came from the crowd.\n\n"Now, I'm a sceptic when it comes to the River Coalition, but not because I harbour any ill-will towards our Riverpony cousins. Right now, it's plain to see that the Coalition lacks popular legitimacy and transparency, and that protecting the rights of Riverlanders is the furthest thing from its mind." Angry shouts came from the audience, denouncing the Coalition. Tea Dip nodded as she paused and waited for them to subside. "The current government is far too eager to surrender our sovereignty to the Coalition's wasteful bureaucracy. Although it has brought us some economic benefits, I pledge to oppose all calls for closer political integration from other members of the Coalition. Let us not allow this institution to become a new ball and chain for Bakara!" Tea Dip's proclamation was greeted with rapturous cheers from the crowd, only growing louder as she stepped down from the stage to shake hooves with her supporters."

After the recent party conference in Kotailia, allegations of inappropriate conduct have been made against several BFZ party officials, known to be close associates with Firm Scow herself. It has been reported that during the after-hours festivities which followed the conference, all manners of debauchery took place.\n\nAs reversing the moral degradation of Bakara is a key plank in the BFZ platform, reports of such conduct could prove especially damaging to the party. So far Firm Scow has chosen to remain silent about the incident, drawing criticism from those who accuse her of letting personal ties cloud her judgement."

It remains to be seen if the public will view this incident as the actions of a few bad ponies, or something which reflects a deeper corruption within the ZDS."

Water Lily's stern voice echoed throughout the streets of the capital as she addressed her supporters who had gathered in front of the Riverlands University of Bakara. "Believe me when I tell you that such ponies are dangerous to Bakaran democracy, and will lead us down the path to dictatorship." Water Lily frowned and shook her head.\n\n"When it comes to the actual record of my administration, the truth is unambiguous. It can be summed up in three words: peace, progress, prosperity." Water Lily punctuated each word by bringing down her hoof, prompting cheers from the crowd. "I implore you not to forsake the progress we have made. I have always been proud to stand on the side of the Little Pony, and if re-elected I will continue to do so. As you have placed your trust in me, I place my trust in you. I humbly ask that you not take that great leap into the unknown. Not when we are on the precipice of achieving such great things." Water Lily brought a hoof to her chest. "Thank you.""

Instead, the divisions have only gotten worse. The wounds have not healed, and throughout Bakara, neighbour still distrusts neighbour.\n\nMutual suspicion is the order of the day, with ponies' scepticism extending beyond the promises of the new administration to the Bakaran political system itself. After all, what good is a system which has fostered such bloody internal conflict? It is doubtful that the new government will be at all capable of bridging the divide.

She spoke sternly, harsh words channeling the scorn felt by many citizens.\n\n"Are you questioning the legitimacy of the government?" shouted a reporter.\n\n"I only question the process," replied the Admiral. "That campaign— I don't think it can be described as anything other than a disaster. It definitely did more to divide the nation that any event I can remember. I don't know if any government that came out of it would deserve the loyalty of the people."\n\nA cacophony of voices rose up to pose the next question to the Admiral.

The new government was in a precarious position. It was despised by many, and if threatened, few Bakarans would rush to its defence.\n\nIt would be easy to lead a detachment of Marines all the way to Parliament. While marching through the streets they would be cheered by the city's populace, hailed as bringers of order, cutting through the factional strife crippling Bakara. The loyalty of her soldiers was ironclad, they would follow her into tartarus, and would certainly have no qualms about overthrowing an unpopular government.\n\nAt that moment, Cobalt Wind knew she held all the cards. If she decided to go through with it, nopony would stop her. But she had to wonder: was it the right thing to do?"

Supported by about 40 Marines, Cobalt Wind cleared the chamber and dissolved the body by force. While on the floor the Admiral had harsh words for Parliament, which were quickly printed and circulated to great acclaim among the city's population.\n\nAlthough she has the backing of the military and most of the capital, several ponies in other cities have expressed outrage at Cobalt Wind's actions as a new wave of unrest ripples across the land. In light of this volatile situation, the Admiral has announced that she will serve as interim president until the nation's situation has fully stabilised. All looters apprehended by authorities so far have been harshly punished, with Cobalt Wind saying threats to public order will no longer be tolerated.

Today she was the mare who needed to appeal to all Bakarans, not just her supporters. An aide brought her a cup of coffee, and she slowly sipped it. Her staff bustled about outside her office, preparing. Some feared a ZDS attack, but she knew that Foam wouldn't do anything that brazen.\n\nAn exhausted stallion entered. "Miss Scow, It's time."\n\nFirm sauntered out to her balcony, overlooking the crowd. Many of the closer ones cheered with enthusiasm, but many of those further back darted their eyes back and forth in worry. Many still considered her a radical, after all.

We are at a turning point in our history, where the strong shall step above the weak and forge a new nation. Currently, our society is bound, held down by the elites who worship the River Coalition, but they have lost sight of its purpose! If they truly wished for Riverlands unity, they would bring the states together to create a greater destiny for all! But no, they want to control our nation from afar! They leave us as puppets to their establishment, which is now filled with monarchists and slavers! They let in those who would control and extort their own people! They try to separate the ponies of the Riverlands! To prevent us from achieving our true destiny of unification and the banishing of the old and corrupt order! I have fought for years to try to gain unity for the ponies, the dogs, and all the other citizens of the Riverlands! In this fight, I have seen the corruption of the establishment—how it lies through its teeth, how it says it wishes for "common prosperity." This is a lie. Their so-called "prosperity" is little more than slavery! It is submission to monarchs, it is domination by elites who care not for the common stallion or mare! I know they will not accept reason. With this, I declare that Bakara will no longer participate in the corrupt union that tries to control us. And that it shall be the goal of this nation to create a new union! A superior union! That shall unite all the Riverponies to achieve our true destiny! We shall enter a new era of greatness and opportunities! The coalition of Rijekograd has abandoned their mandate to bring together all the ponies of the east! And now Bakara must bear it! The dream of Riverland unity lives on in Bakara! Long live Bakara!

bakara.26.d:0 "Cobalt Wind stood by the coast in Vetailje amongst a grove of trees, looking out into the icy sound. The immaterial calm of the ocean waves reinforcing the Admiral's calm demeanor. As the sea spray coated her Navy uniform, she had absolute confidence in the actions she would undertake today. The Admiral heard cursing from the shrubbery behind her as Tea Dip broke through the treeline covered in twigs and pine needles.\n\n"Admiral! Where have you been! I'm most likely putting my life on the line here for your little maneuver, and you are out here sightseeing?! Can I have some explanation?"\n\nThe Admiral said nothing for a moment and then replied, "They say some days you can see Greneclyf from these shores. I haven't personally, but I like to take it as a metaphor, if nothing else. We here in the Navy always look forward to bigger things than petty political squabbles. And now it is time to put that philosophy into action."\n\n"Oh in the name of all that is good, stop it with the esoteric nonsense. You are the head of a coup here. You have my financial support, Firm Scow is out somewhere gathering the rest of her militia, and Water Lily isn't going to be an issue. You told us all you have a plan. Now, what is it."\n\nThe Admiral turned and smirked, "That's the type of attitude I like. Now it is relatively simple, the Kovačinaši will push up on land, and the commies will engage them, then me and Pearl Diver will sweep into Bakara proper on my capital ship with the Marines, and arrest Bray Foam. Easy."\n\nTea Dip blinked a few seconds. Before exclaiming sarcastically, "Oh, sure sure! Easy as Pie!" The Admiral snapped back, "I am the Military mare here. Trust me."\n\nTea Dip sighed, "I can only hope you are right about this."\n\n\n\n"Otherwise we are all suffering for it.""

bakara.27.d:0 "We finally have some good news out of the capital, as the brave soldiers of the Bakaran Revolutionary Militia faced down the counterrevolutionary Kovačinaši in fierce street fighting, winning a decisive victory. But that is not all: in the midst of the chaos, the traitor Cobalt Wind herself was apprehended alongside Pearl Diver, leading a small squad of marines intent on striking at the government's leadership. With these twin triumphs, the reactionary coup of Cobalt Wind and her co-conspirators has been utterly thwarted.\n\nFollowing the mobilisation of the Revolutionary Militia and the defeat of the coup, there has been a rush of admirals pledging their loyalty to the government and supporting the legitimacy of the election. Although their true loyalties may still not lie with us, the situation within the Navy has been quelled for the moment. The capture of Cobalt has dealt a hammerblow to the unified front organised by the opposition parties, who now have little hope of finding another leader popular enough to be acceptable to all three of the BFZ, SDH, and BSP. Active resistance continues, but fortunately the disparate rebel groups lack ordered leadership and coordination, and it is only a matter of time until they are isolated and neutralised.\n\nWhile the fighting is dying down, there is still no shortage of voices criticizing the government, not all of them residing within Bakara. Prominent members of the River Coalition's leadership have expressed harsh disapproval at the recent instability, refusing to outright back the mandate of the ZDS. This tacit support for Cobalt Wind and the other coup plotters has infuriated Bray Foam, who has released a statement denouncing the Coalition in even stronger language than usual.\n\n Although the current crisis may be over, there is no doubt we still have a long way to go before fully consolidating the nation."

bakara.28.d:0 "Across the entirety of Bakara, the violence and contention which consumed the nation after Cobalt Wind launched her insurrection has at last died down. The final rebel fighters holding out in Vetailje surrendered to government soldiers, bringing some semblance of peace back to the land. Although the fighting may be over, the societal divisions which led to the conflict remain, and will have to be somehow addressed by the new government if it is to survive. In the meantime, Cobalt Wind remains in custody, awaiting trial and probable execution.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the fighting, and in front of a rowdy and enthusiastic crowd in the capital, Bray Foam was officially sworn in as President of Bakara. The largely working-class supporters of the ZDS cheered their leader until they grew hoarse, as Bray once again promised to make achieving social equality his foremost priority in office. The completion of the much anticipated ceremony promises to usher in a new revolutionary era for the nation; one which is, for the moment, filled with hope."

Minister Ruby Shore has conducted a thorough survey of the newly integrated territories of the USRR, and reached an unsettling conclusion. She states that beneath the present superficial unity of the Riverlands lies frightening instability. Three areas are singled out for special attention in her report:\n\nFirstly, the various armed forces which fought against us during unification have yet to be integrated into a single army. These disintegrated armies represent an independent power base and unacceptable threat which may be used to undermine the Republics. Secondly, deep cultural divides remain in place along the old national borders. It will take some time to wipe away the ages of built-up enmity and misconceptions between our citizens. Thirdly, the economic systems developed by the other Riverlander states differ greatly from the superior socialist economy we developed in Bakara. Truly efficient cooperation across the entire Riverlands will be stymied until our system is implemented across the Republics.\n\nAs long as these issues remain unresolved, they will continue to fester and threaten the unity of the USRR.

The Bakarans have had their revolution against capitalist oppression and carried it out exactly as Caramel Marks and Steel Stallion prescribed, crushing all internal opponents to the advancement of socialism. Now they take the final step to fully unite with their fellow workers.\n\nFor the past few years, Bakara has been led by Bray Foam, a brilliant and loyal disciple of Caramel Haze. Foam has flawlessly implemented all of Marks' theories, which has resulted in a prosperous society run by a model dictatorship of the proletariat. Foam was instrumental in securing passage for the Act of Unification, as his strong desire to unite with his mentor fueled his forceful arguments in favour of annexation.\n\nUnits of border police have already begun the process of dismantling border posts, to much rejoicing from the common ponies.

Stepping up onto a platform, he took a moment to survey the massive chamber they occupied: a section of an unfinished museum, nonetheless impressive in its austere simplicity. The other members of the Congress were seated in a great semicircle in front of the platform, respectfully silent out of reverence for their leader. Shuffling his notes, Bray cleared his throat.\n\n"My friends, it was not long ago that the great legacy of our Republic was attacked. A pony who had sworn to defend Bakara instead decided to lead a sinister plot to subvert the will of its people," Bray said solemnly. "We were beset by villains who sought to undo centuries of progress and plunge us back into a dark age of autocracy. But we did not flinch! We beat back the traitors, winning a glorious victory for the workers against their bourgeois oppressors!" Bray raised his hoof high as his audience stomped in wild approval.\n\n"Our victory is a milestone which will mark the beginning of a new age of liberation and progress for Bakaran workers. But there are still great challenges to overcome." Bray took a deep breath. "In the face of such challenges, our foremost priority must be...""

bakara.32.t:0 "The Fate of Admiral Sea Lily"
bakara.32.d:0 "Ever since the capture of Cobalt Wind, there have been whispers from many ponies within the ZDS that she could not have been the only Admiral complicit in the reactionary plot; these ponies have seized on Admiral Sea Lily as a target of ridicule and suspicion. They assert that despite refusing to join Cobalt's insurrection openly, she instead acted as a spy intent on sabotaging the government response from within. Cited as evidence is the fact that, although she never articulated it publicly, it is widely known that in the run-up to the election Sea Lily fervently opposed the ZDS. She was also known to be friendly with the despicable arch-capitalist Tea Dip.\n\nAgainst these attacks, few ponies are eager to defend her. Her standing was damaged considerably after the nation learned of her involvement in the fiasco at Kotailia. Government forces held the city under her watch in the early days of Cobalt's coup, until her veteran marines were routed by a far inferior force of Kovačinaši. The embarrassment resulted in ceding control of the city to Cobalt's counter-revolutionaries. Her opponents assert that the only plausible explanation for this baffling defeat is that she intentionally weakened her position to undermine the defence of the city.\n\nThese facts form the basis for accusations that Sea Lily was involved in a treasonous conspiracy against the government, and that allowing her to retain her command would pose an unacceptable risk to Bakara's future. Although there is no definitive proof against the Admiral, the circumstances are enough to make anypony suspicious."

The arriving ponies were warmly welcomed by the already seated representatives of the ZDS, marking the end of an uncertain interregnum which has been plagued by mistrust and mutual suspicion. Some within the ZDS called for an extensive purge to bar anypony with suspected ties to Cobalt Wind's insurrection from participating, but ultimately these voices were not heeded. Bray Foam's policy is one of forgiveness and reconciliation.\n\nThe addition of respected ministers Star Chaser, Sunshine Carrack, and Ebony Wing is sure to bolster the credibility of the new administration. The ministers have indicated that they are excited to get down to business, and each expressed their total confidence in Bray Foam's leadership. In response, many ponies who were initially skeptical of the new government have already become cautiously optimistic. They hope that this will signal the end of the contentious bickering which recently immobilised Bakara, and the start of cooperation in which the differing parties work together to solve the challenges facing the nation."

bakara.34.t:0 "The First Trial"
bakara.34.d:0 "In the inaugural trial of Bray Foam's comprehensive review of the military, several high-ranking army officers stand accused of corruption, bribery, and misappropriation of state funds. Most scandalously, field marshal Tough Bunker is alleged to have sold Bakaran military secrets to foreign agents, with generals Direct Drive and Keen Perspective also being involved. All three ponies are also believed to have coordinated in the embezzlement of funds intended to go towards acquiring supplies for their troops, instead using the money to enrich themselves. These activities have left a substantial paper trail, giving prosecutors ample evidence to paint these three ponies as having been caught red-hooved. In their defence, the three claim that the allegations are false and that the documents proving their guilt are, in fact, forgeries produced by jealous rivals from within the army."

bakara.35.t:0 "The Second Trial"
bakara.35.d:0 "The next trial which demands our attention involves the prominent advisors Forest Green, Windy Breeze, and Morning Light. An investigation into their pasts has revealed that all three have connections to reactionary militia groups, several of which opposed the government during Cobalt Wind's insurrection. We can not know their level of commitment to these organisations, but it is obvious their ideological sympathies lie far from the ZDS platform. Given the current political climate, can we trust ponies like that? The three ponies do not deny their pasts, but they all claim to have ceased involvement with the militias long before the recent unrest, and they all seem to have opposed Cobalt during the insurrection. They adamantly swear that they have always served the government loyally, and pledge to continue doing so in the future, if allowed."

bakara.36.d:0 "The last trial of our military review involves some of the most serious allegations yet. Advisors Star Bristle, Arctic Breeze, and Pearl Diver stand accused of masterminding a vast and sinister counterrevolutionary plot. It is alleged that these three ponies have been scheming in the shadows since the election, making plans to overthrow the government and establish a military dictatorship. The basis for these allegations are documents recovered during a raid on Star Bristle's residence, although the documents are said to contain highly sensitive information and have thus been kept secret from the public. During the trial proceedings, the three were defiant, refusing to recognise the authority of the tribunal or respond to any inquiries. All three ponies are respected and well-regarded leaders, leaving many skeptical of the evidence without having seen it for themselves."

No longer will we have reason to look over our shoulders and fear insubordination from egomaniacal officers. Now there is no doubt that the soldiers of Bakara are on the side of the workers!\n\nWith this, the power of the old and corrupt military aristocracy of Bakara has been shattered. In its place rises an unquestionably loyal force, dedicated to advancing the righteous cause of socialism. When the time comes, our troops will fight, and they will fight with a revolutionary fervour that will be impossible to resist.

Although the trip was unannounced, it did not take long for an impromptu crowd of sailors and dock workers to gather and cheer on the famed champion of the people. The gracious Bray shook many hooves, all the while reiterating his promise to improve conditions for the lower classes. After the completion of his tour, Bray headed to the industrial district, where he was scheduled to give a speech in front of the city's largest factory. By the time he arrived, the factory courtyard was packed with ponies eager to hear his address.\n\n"My fellow citizens," began Bray. "As you know all too well, recent instability has had a devastating effect on our economy. Many ponies are out of work, hungry, and hopeless." Bray frowned deeply. "These are difficult times for all of us, but the only way we can move past them and ensure they never return again is by completely revolutionising our economic system. It will not be easy, but together, we can build a new economy, a better economy, and a fairer economy!" Bray raised his hoof in the air as the crowd cheered. "Things will improve, I promise you.

Two prominent advisors have each presented their own plans, but due to our limited resources we can only commit to one of them.\n\nRuby Shore's plan calls for massive investments in heavy industry: heavy equipment, large machine tools, and specialised structures. This is all in keeping with Marksist-Stallionist orthodoxy, which demands that we prioritise producing weapons for the defence and liberation of the workers. Shore also claims that directing resources towards this sector will result in massive economic benefits down the line.\n\nOn the other hoof, Violet Field's plan calls for massive investments in light industry. Investments in these consumer-oriented industries would allow us to produce more consumer goods, benefiting common ponies. Violet claims that directing resources towards this sector will result in greater happiness and prosperity for the average citizen. While not in keeping with revolutionary orthodoxy, this plan would more quickly bring tangible benefits to Bakarans and would probably prove more popular."

The revolution in Bakara began promisingly, but unfortunately it has regressed enough to produce a regime which makes a mockery of the concept of socialism. Now they have taken the final treacherous step to undermine those who truly try to protect the workers.\n\nFor the past few years Bakara has been led by Bray Foam, a pony who was once a loyal disciple of Caramel Haze, but who has morphed into a cowardly snake, eager to make concessions to anti-proletarian factions within Bakara. Foam has chosen to betray all of Marksist-Stallionist theories, which has resulted in a degenerate society which claims to be socialist, but is in reality built around economic exploitation and deception. Foam was instrumental in drafting this despicable denunciation, and it seems his strong desire to destroy his former mentor fueled his forceful arguments against Haze.\n\nIt is sad that it has come to this, but Bray Foam must be crushed, in the name of the Revolution!"

He fiddled with the flag pin on his jacket as he spoke.\n\n"That's wonderful!" exclaimed Firm Scow. "You know, it is of the utmost importance that we educate foals on their duty to the nation. It falls to ponies like us to set an example for them, don't you agree?" She raised an eyebrow at the stallion across from her.\n\n"Of course, Madame President." Lisica smiled nervously.\n\n"The Industrial Council has been doing excellent work. However, I do not believe the fruits of prosperity are being shared with the nation as they should be. It makes me question the patriotism of you and your fellow council members." Firm Scow frowned. The colour seemed to drain from Lisica's face. "Not to worry!"

But when Firm Scow approached the podium to speak, they swiftly fell silent out of respect for their leader.\n\n"Patriotic citizens of Bakara," began Firm Scow, "recent years have seen our nation suffer a long and slow decline caused by moral decay and decadence. Our victory gives us the chance to cleanse this decay. Together, we will reverse the decline and create a reborn Bakara, renewed by our communal spirit." Her tone was pointed and forceful, cutting through the warm air with its intensity. "This renewal will require devotion and sacrifice from every citizen, but what we will bring about is no less the dawn of a new cycle of history!" At this, the crowd stomped enthusiastically.\n\n"But not just for Bakara!" She raised a hoof emphatically. "We must foster the communal spirit of all creatures throughout the Riverlands, for we are all bound together by our eternal values and by our shared struggle against Griffonian Imperialism. Achieving this will necessitate slaying the morally bankrupt River Coalition." She brought her hoof down forcefully on the podium as the crowd booed and jeered at the mention of the Coalition.\n\n"The Riverlands are in crisis. The ponies must be saved from their current state of disintegration and injustice." Beads of sweat began to drip down Firm Scow's face: a result of her fervour. "It falls to us to combat the menace and unite them under a truly righteous banner. We shall see the Riverlands reborn!" Firm Scow raised her hoof high in the air.

bakara.52.d:0 "Today marked Bakara's first elections since Cobalt Wind's Patriotic Putsch, as ponies across the country were once again invited to have a voice in government. However, very few ponies took up the offer. Nationwide, turnout was extremely low, with the total number of ballots cast adding up to only a fraction of those cast during the hotly contested election of 1007. The BFZ was the only party to campaign heavily, with members of other parties reluctant to speak up out of fear of reprisal.\n\nThroughout the day, polling stations operated without incident, with the process being closely overseen by the military. After the polls closed the results were swiftly tabulated by soldiers, and it did not take long for the winners to become apparent. The election proved to be an overwhelming victory for the BFZ, with Firm Scow's party taking in north of 95 percent of the vote. In her victory speech, Firm Scow went out of her way to praise Cobalt Wind's leadership, and promised to put her full weight behind advancing the Admiral's agenda."
bakara.52.a:0 "Was there ever any doubt?"

bakara.53.t:0 "The Emergency Powers Act"
bakara.53.d:0 "Article 1. National laws may be enacted by the President as well as in accordance with the procedure established in the Constitution. This also applies to laws relating to the Republic's budget, including regulating all state revenues and expenses.\n\nArticle 2. The national laws enacted by the President may deviate from the Constitution as long as they do not affect the position of Parliament. The powers of the President remain undisturbed.\n\nArticle 3. Treaties of the Republic with foreign states which concern matters of national legislation do not require the consent of the bodies participating in legislation. The President is empowered to issue the necessary provisions for the implementation of these treaties."
bakara.53.a:0 "Order shall be maintained!"

bakara.54.t:0 "We the Ponies..."
bakara.54.d:0 "In a packed, sweltering hall in central Bakara City, a collection of representatives from across the country mingled. They were gathered for an amendments convention—the first in living memory—to decide whether to approve a series of amendments which would embed the principles of limited government and individual freedom into the very fabric of the nation. The representatives were supportive of the idea, although a vocal minority were skeptical, fearful that the amendments would have the effect of weakening the Republic's ability to operate effectively. President Tea Dip called for all their attention, rising to address the convention.\n\n"My friends, we are gathered here today to consider alterations to our Constitution, which I fervently believe are vital to preserving freedom in Bakara," Tea Dip began. "It is a simple fact that an all-powerful national government will always pose a threat to the liberties of the people. And so we must add to our Constitution specific guarantees of personal freedoms and rights, clear limitations on the government's power in judicial and other proceedings, and an explicit declaration that all powers not specifically granted to the Bakaran Parliament by the Constitution are reserved for the ponies." As Tea Dip spoke, sceptics in the crowd began to waver, slowly being swayed by her fervour.\n\n"The moral course of action for us is clear. Should a government, vested with supreme authority over a nation, be restricted by a declaration of rights? It certainly should!" Tea Dip thundered. "To secure our sacred ideals not just for today, but for generations to come, I humbly ask that you approve these amendments." Shouts of approval rained down from the gathered representatives."
bakara.54.a:0 "To life, liberty, and happiness!"

bakara.55.t:0 "Bakaran Filibustering"
bakara.55.d:0 "In an egregious display of obstructionism, Bakaran representatives to the River Coalition are stalling the advancement of any new proposals, hogging the floor and giving irrelevant, long-winded speeches. Their filibustering, along with the use of other procedural tricks to delay action by the body, seems intended to give Bakara time to strengthen its own position within the Coalition. Regardless, there is nothing we can do. Thanks to their stonewalling, the gears of the Coalition have been ground to a complete halt."
bakara.55.a:0 "What a bunch of mules..."

bakara.56.t:0 "The United Riverlands Philosophical Committee"
bakara.56.d:0 "Today marks the first meeting of the United Riverlands Philosophical Committee. The new gathering is being attended by representatives from all members of the River Coalition, with the stated goal of advancing Pan-Riverlandic thought. It has already brought together thinkers from across a broad political spectrum, providing them with the opportunity to discuss ideas about the future development of the Riverlands. The summit is a result of Bakaran insistence; it seems Bakara has become highly committed to the project of greater integration within the Coalition. Although the long term effects of the summit are yet to be seen, in the short term it has caused many of our people to take a liking to the Bakarans, as they seem genuinely interested in hearing our ideas."
bakara.56.a:0 "Great!"

bakara.57.t:0 "In Defence of Democracy"
bakara.57.d:0 "Across the entirety of Bakara, the fighting has at last died down and the forces of order have emerged victorious. After securing the capital and taking Bray Foam into custody, the communist rebels lost cohesion and were quickly isolated and overwhelmed by government soldiers, bringing some semblance of peace back to the land. It is clear that the ZDS has been shattered, with their partisans defeated and all of their prominent supporters imprisoned.\n\nNow it falls to Admiral Cobalt Wind to decide which party to invite to lead the new government and begin the process of rebuilding. The safe choice, and the one most Bakarans are expecting, would be Water Lily and the SDH. Her return would boost confidence in the new regime, helping to stabilise the situation. The SDH does have an unfortunate Pan-Riverlandic streak, although Cobalt Wind's influence would fix that problem easily.\n\nOn the other hoof, some within the Admiralty are advocating for Tea Dip the BSP. The selection would be unconventional, but not without definite upsides. Tea Dip still carries the support and confidence of Bakaran business interests. The loyalty of these wealthy ponies could be secured by allying with the BSP. Tea Dip would also add some much-needed rhetorical heft to the government, being a persuasive advocate for the ideals of freedom and liberty.\n\nThere is no doubt that both parties have their merits. For the Admiral, the choice will not be an easy one."
bakara.57.a:0 "Cobalt Wind chooses to work with the SDH."
bakara.57.b:0 "Cobalt Wind chooses to work with the BSP."

bakara.58.t:0 "Water Lily's Speech"
bakara.58.d:0 ""Fellow citizens," began Water Lily, addressing the crowd gathered in front of Parliament, "As you know, I have always been a believer in the River Coalition. For decades I trusted wholeheartedly in its principles and its mission, but now it pains me to admit that that trust was misplaced." She closed her eyes and took a sombre breath as gasps came from the audience. "Recent unrest has demonstrated all too clearly the impotence of the Coalition and the emptiness of its promise." The crowd, at first incredulous, began to mumble in approval.\n\n"I come to tell you that we must be willing to move forward and put the corrupt and unjust Coalition behind us." Water Lily brought a hoof down forcefully. "It's time to begin a new chapter in our nation's history. It's time for Bakara to put Bakarans first! We must take back control and recover our lost sovereignty, for only through our own strength is it possible for us to secure our own future. Thank you, and long live the Republic." Water Lily stepped down from her podium to a wall of rapturous cheering from the crowd."
bakara.58.a:0 "The Coalition abandoned us, we don't owe them anything!"

bakara.59.t:0 "The Pardons"
bakara.59.d:0 "This morning, Admiral Cobalt Wind released a statement announcing pardons for hundreds of ponies who were imprisoned for having connections to the ZDS. The Admiral called the release of these prisoners "the compassionate thing to do" saying that a degree of mercy would be needed to help the nation heal and rebuild. The pardons were specifically reserved for ponies with no history of violent actions: communist sympathisers who were taken into custody purely as a preventative measure. News of their release was greeted favourably by most of the public, although some hard-liners within the military have expressed disapproval towards the show of clemency."
bakara.59.a:0 "Not all of them were as bad as Bray Foam."

bakara.60.t:0 "Bureaucratic Reforms"
bakara.60.d:0 "After brief debate, the Civil Service Reform Act has been passed with an overwhelming majority in Parliament. The law was championed by both Water Lily and Cobalt Wind, and was conceived as a response to reports of subversive influence within the bureaucracy. The act establishes the Bakaran Civil Service Commission, an organisation tasked with regulating the employment and working conditions of civil servants, overseeing hiring and promotions, and promoting the values of public service. Detractors suspect the act's true purpose is to serve as a pretext to purge government agencies of ponies with ties to the ZDS, while supporters say it will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the government, as well as increasing accountability."
bakara.60.a:0 "It's time we cleaned house, anyway."

bakara.61.t:0 "Homecoming"
bakara.61.d:0 "This morning, Admiral Cobalt Wind released a statement calling for more ponies to embrace the "spirit of economic patriotism" saying that further domestic development will be necessary to preserve Bakara's self-sufficiency and political autonomy. In response, several prominent Bakaran businessponies have already announced their intent to scale back ties to foreign businesses, and economists anticipate the flow of capital out of the country will soon slow to a crawl. Advocates of this new policy argue that further Bakaran industrialisation will be key to securing the nation's future, and will also have positive spillover effects on the rest of the economy."
bakara.61.a:0 "It's time we put the prosperity of Bakara first!"

bakara.62.t:0 "Tea Dip's Speech"
bakara.62.d:0 ""My friends," began Tea Dip, addressing the crowd gathered in front of Parliament, "I know these are uncertain times for our nation. In fact, many ponies have come to me expressing concerns about the new government. I am sympathetic to those who fear for their freedoms, but these fears are simply unfounded." She held up a hoof for emphasis. "Those who call the actions of Cobalt Wind 'illegal' misunderstand the real issue. A communist state would have meant the end of Bakaran liberty as we know it. The fact is that the military was justified in their defence of the people, just as the people are justified when defending themselves." The crowd, at first sceptical, began to mumble in approval.\n\n"I know Cobalt Wind, Cobalt Wind is a friend of mine. I know her to be a pony of integrity, with only the best interests of the nation at heart." Tea Dip pleaded. "I urge you to put your trust in our government, because all the while I will be working tirelessly to protect your liberties. With your support, we will build a new Bakara; one that respects the rights of every pony, seeing us to new heights of freedom and prosperity!" Tea Dip pointed to the horizon, drawing waves of rapturous cheering from the crowd."
bakara.62.a:0 "Military rule isn't particularly libertarian..."

bakara.63.t:0 "Order and Progress"
bakara.63.d:0 "In the office of Admiral Cobalt Wind, she smiled and was greeted by her esteemed guest, Zvit Lisica of the Lisica Textile Manufacturing Company. "It is a pleasure to meet you, Admiral." Zvit reached out a hoof to shake his host's.\n\n"Ah, there's no need to be so formal here," replied the Admiral. "Call me Cobalt."\n\n"Of course!" laughed Zvit. "I must say, you did Bakara a great service standing up to those damn reds. It's times like these when we need to have a pony with your courage at the helm." Zvit pointed at Cobalt. "Not to compare myself to you, but in the past I've had to deal with them myself, you know. They masterminded a strike at our largest factory that lasted for weeks! In the end we had to call in a specialist. Nasty business, that." Cobalt nodded, pretending to be interested. "But that's besides the point. I've talked with Tea Dip and she vouched for you, which is good enough for me. You have my complete confidence and support."\n\n"I'm glad to hear that," said Cobalt. "Rest assured that the situation is stable; Bakara is looking at a prolonged period of economic growth. What our new government represents is order and progress."\n\n"Now I like the sound of that." Zvit smiled widely. "To order and profits!""
bakara.63.a:0 "Wonderful!"

bakara.64.t:0 "An Offer From Bakaran Comrades"
bakara.64.d:0 "Bakara has requested that we join to aid in their "Great Patriotic War of Unification" against the River Coalition. They claim that this is the ultimate conflict that will liberate the peoples of the Riverlands from the chains of economic exploitation and political oppression. This offer is made somewhat less appealing by the fact that their wording makes it clear that if we accept we would be a junior partner in the coalition, sacrificing much of our autonomy. Refusal could also be dangerous, as the Bakarans heavily imply that refusing to join them will cause us to be treated the same as all other forces of reaction and dealt with accordingly."
bakara.64.a:0 "We must join together in solidarity!"
bakara.64.b:0 "We're fine as we are, thanks."

bakara.65.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Joins Our Cause"
bakara.65.d:0 "Today is a glorious day, as [FROM.GetLeader] has accepted our invitation to join together in the great liberation of the Riverlands. We salute this display of revolutionary solidarity! With our combined might, ultimate victory against the forces of reaction will be far easier to achieve."
bakara.65.a:0 "Onward to liberation!"

bakara.66.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Betrays the Revolution"
bakara.66.d:0 "In a stunning display of cowardice, [FROM.GetLeader] has declined our invitation to join together in the great liberation of the Riverlands. They have made a grave mistake, as they could have played a part in shattering the tyranny of the Riverlands' corrupt rulers. Instead, they will be crushed along with all the other forces of reaction and oppression."
bakara.66.a:0 "We should have expected this..."

bakara.67.t:0 "The Tea Party"
bakara.67.d:0 ""Oh yes, the reason for you being here is simple, my regime is not yet fully strengthened. We still have many subversives to deal with, but there is a group I still trust, and that is your BFZ party. We have the same goals, in essence, strengthen Bakara, assist and protect her people. It was a simple choice for me, really." Firm Scow crooked her head to the side, "I have always wanted to lead Bakara. It was the wish of my father before me, and I have inherited his legacy. But we also accept the dream of a united Riverlands, and you have always been against tha-", "Stop." The admiral cut Firm Scow off, "I understand your belief in this idea of a united Riverlands. Applying your ideas far and wide, but you must accept that it can not happen. Why do you think the election turned out to be the firestorm it was? Because of all these foreign meddlers! The communists have always been supported by their "comrades" abroad, and arguments over our place in this Federation of ours caused violence on a huge scale, my intelligence has also shown me that foreign agitators have been responsible for much of the conflict rocking Bakara.", the Admiral takes out sheets and sheets of reports and places them in front of Firm Scow, who in turn begins to shuffle through them.\n\nAn intense redness overcomes Firm Scow, distress gnawing at her face, "How... communists from Rijekograd, donations to the BSP from Wittenland and Nimbusia?"\n\nCobalt Wind suddenly noticed something, her negotiation partner was... upset? She always knew that Firm Scow would not be comfortable with the loss of her political power, but this was genuine sadness? Cobalt Wind felt a strange compulsion in her chest, a warm throbbing to try to comfort this Mare, something she had never felt penetrate her cold steel military demeanor. Walking around her desk, she places a hoof on Firm Scow's shoulder, "Do not be too upset, you can still help Bakara. Come with me and help me lead Bakara into a new future, free from the slavers and communists from abroad, Bakara tried to open herself to the world, and the world rejected and abused her. So Bakara must keep to her own."\n\nFirm Scow pulled herself together and turned to face the military mare who now rested on her shoulder, face red as a beet she stammered out a few words, "Y-yeah, you shall have the support of the BFZ from now on. You will make Bakara proud." The Admiral chuckled, "Well, you are coming with me, of course? You will lead by my side, and maybe you can be by my side in other places too?" Firm Scow jumped back at this and out of her chair, "Y-you what? I... I mean, I guess so. B-but, where would this be?" The Admiral smiled, the warm feeling in her chest intensifying...\n\n"Well... let's try my personal quarters?"" 
bakara.67.a:0 "What a lovely mare..."

# "§YBorn§!: \n\n§YBiography§!: \n\n§YPortrait By§!: "
POLITICS_WATERLILY_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 964, Rural Bakara near Mareibor \n\n§YBiography§!: Born to a relatively poor farming family in the rural countryside of Bakara, far from the coasts for which the nation is famous, Water Lily surely would not have expected to be where she is today. Moving to Bakara city to pursue higher education, she became a teacher and was able to support herself and her new husband, a fellow university graduate. As a teacher, she became involved in her community and began to see the poverty that surrounded her in Bakara. In an attempt to amend this, she ran for the Mayorship of the city as a dark horse candidate and won against all the odds. It has been many years since then, and now Water Lily, the head of the SDH, must hold to her values and protect democracy and unity in Bakara against huge odds. This isn't just the classroom anymore. \n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
POLITICS_TEA_DIP_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 968, Bakara City \n\n§YBiography§!: Tea Dip is the type of mare where you will never see a frown on her face. Endlessly charismatic and eternally suave, she rose up from a simple dock worker to the prodigal daughter of the CEO of the largest shipping company in Bakara. When he passed, she began a battle over company leadership with his biological son, eventually winning out through business guile, and a marriage proposal. With her new husband in tow, Tea prepared to do what she loved the most. Making obscene amounts of money. But to her dismay, she found herself liberated by the economic freedom allowed by the treaty of Coltstream, but stifled by the political aspects of the same body, and countless other Bakaran merchants felt the same way. Finding something to fight for, she handed control of her company to her husband and used her wealth to found the "Bakarska Stranka Pravica" and has campaigned with it ever since. Now as leader of her nation she will finally have the chance to put her ideas into practice.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Ignacio"
POLITICS_BRAY_FOAM_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!:940, Marelje \n\n§YBiography§!: Son of a common laborer in the north-west of Bakara, Bray Foam quickly began to rise above the circumstances of his birth. Becoming fascinated with numbers and statistics, he eventually began to study economics in depth. He soon left his town to study this in Rijektograd and returned as a economic advisor to his community. But while in Rijekograd, he met a pony by the name of Caramel Haze. While at the time they both had little to do with politics, the meeting would change both their lives. They began a correspondence and slowly both adopted socialist ideas, with Foam becoming Haze's "2nd" in many ways. From there, Bray Foam became more and more involved in Bakaran politics, and one day, when the former de facto leader of the nation's socialists died in a mining strike, many turned to the modern educated economist in their midst. From there, Bray brought the Bakaran socialists closer to their brothers in the River Republic, but whether he keeps that course remains to be seen.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Twotail813"
POLITICS_FIRM_SCOW_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 983, Bakara City \n\n§YBiography§!: Firm Scow is the inheritor of a legacy, and has a lot to prove to her family and her nation. The daughter of her party's previous leader, the infamous Scorch Scow, Firm has definitely made a name for herself separate from her father's legacy. While he was known to be curt and harsh, Firm is open and amenable. Where he shut the party's doors to all but the most fanatical, Firm opened the BFZ to the wider population. And this change in leadership marked a sea change for the party. Growing from a minuscule fringe under her father, Firm Scow has lead a massive expansion and is hailed as a leader many times that of her dad. But none would say this to her face, her father is many years dead now. Struck down by a "sleeping sickness". And despite her distant and often seriously troubled relationship with him, she guards his memory fiercely. And now Firm Scow stands at her nation's helm. Ready to guide it, and the Riverlands as a whole into a new age of prosperity and opportunity. And if it is not that easy, she only needs to remember her father's old adage, "Mares and stallions may say they don't want something. But there is always something that can convince them. Always." \n\n§YPortrait By§!: Vanilla Swirl"
POLITICS_COBALT_WIND_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 978, Vetailje \n\n§YBiography§!: Admiral Cobalt Wind has lived her life as almost all would expect. The daughter of two former admirals, she has grown up in the family profession and embraced her inherited role as Bakara's greatest Admiral. An intelligent mind with a knack for being in front of cameras, Cobalt has brought the Navy to the forefront of the Bakaran mindset once again, and has become a public figure in her own way. This is where her similarities to her parents end though, while they were generally a-political, Cobalt has never held her tongue on matters of national policy and has spoken out many times against government policies, while never directly aligning herself with any of the opposition parties. The one view she has made clear however, is her hatred of communism, which she sees as the cause of societal degradation, and has made a point of trying to keep socialist sympathies out of the Navy. But now it seems her life takes a new heading. As Bakaran head of state, Cobalt Wind will apply her military mindset to national governance. And her citizens can only guess how that will end up.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Silverstorm"

BAK_build_roads_in_DEP_desc:0 "Deponya shares a border with griffon territory, but their borderlands lack proper infrastructure. If the Coalition is to properly defend themselves against any sudden threats, our forces should be able to quickly move towards the border. Deponya lacks sufficient industrial capacity to do undertake a large public works effort in the area, so it is up to us to prepare the borderlands for military manoeuvres."
BAK_development_grants_DEP:0 "Development Grants for Deponya"
BAK_development_grants_DEP_desc:0 "More must be done to lift the state of Deponya up to the level of the rest of the Coalition. We will make development grants available to their government. The Deponyans might be a bit clingy towards their traditions, but with enough compensation, even they might see the value in progress!"
BAK_develop_FRE:0 "Invest in Pònaidhean"
BAK_develop_FRE_desc:0 "Pònaidhean is one of the weaker members of the Coalition. Their country consists mostly of rugged highlands. By investing in large scale excavation, we can make a larger part of the country actually fit for industrialisation. Surely the tribes will enjoy their newfound wealth." 
BAK_build_roads_in_FRE:0 "Build Roads in Pònaidhean"
BAK_build_roads_in_FRE_desc:0 "Pònaidhean shares a border with the deer clans to the south. The exact motives of these creatures are unknown to us, but it wouldn't hurt to prepare infrastructure in the area, in case large troop movements are required. Who knows, maybe this will help bring Pònaidhean's tribes closer together?"
BAK_development_grants_FRE:0 "Development Grants in Pònaidhean"
BAK_development_grants_FRE_desc:0 "More must be done to lift the state of Pònaidhean up to the level of the rest of the Coalition. We will make development grants available to their government. Some Pònaidheans might prefer to stay as isolated tribes, but they will soon see the value of cooperation!"
BAK_found_the_rdc:0 "The River Development Company"
BAK_found_the_rdc_desc:0 "The Coalition has, informally, done much to develop the most backward member nations. To formalise this development, we will make an independent River Development Company. We will give them the experts and funding they need to develop industry and infrastructure for the entire Coalition. If we get all our friends to help, we will all benefit!"
BAK_found_the_rec:0 "The River Economic Community"
BAK_found_the_rec_desc:0 "The RCSC has been a resounding success. We must now push forward and try to integrate more sections of the economy. This will make our economies less dependent on the outside and more resilient. To help in this plan we shall propose that the RCSC will be transformed into the River Economic Community. It is time to call for another treaty conference!"
BAK_social_fund:0 "Establish a Social Fund"
BAK_social_fund_desc:0 "The differences between labour laws and social security between the different member states is a cause for concern. We cannot integrate our economies while our social programs remain different. To curtail the worst situations, we will establish the Social Fund to protect workers from all member states."
BAK_rdc_rail_projects:0 "RDC Rail Projects"
BAK_rdc_rail_projects_desc:0 "The RDC has made it her mission to connect the many far-flung places in Eastern Griffonia. By inviting their engineers we will be able to connect our hinterlands together. We have but to draft an official plan and request to the Company."
BAK_eastern_transport_fund:0 "Fund RiverTrans"
BAK_eastern_transport_fund_desc:0 "RiverTrans is a proposal by the River Development Company to increase connectivity across the member states by making an international transportation company. RiverTrans will develop the traditionally neglected border roads and railroads to ensure that it is as easy to travel between countries as it is within countries. "
BAK_beings_rights:0 "Write the Convention on Racial Tolerance"
BAK_beings_rights_desc:0 "The River Coalition has creatures of many different races living within its member states. Not only various equine races, but Diamond Dogs as well. To show that the River Coalition is happy to accept all races into its ranks, be they changelings, deer or even griffons, we should draft the Convention on Racial Tolerance, aimed at promoting equality between races."
BAK_river_parliament:0 "Found the River Parliament"
BAK_river_parliament_desc:0 "The project of integration of the river states is not a project of the elites alone. We must be sure to keep the citizens involved as well. A directly elected parliament of the River Community shall be created. By giving this parliament a say in some matters that concern the entire Community, we are sure to increase popular support for more integration."
BAK_rdc_industry_projects:0 "RDC Industrial Projects"
BAK_rdc_industry_projects_desc:0 "One of the RDC's primary goals is increasing economic growth. By opening up new industrial sectors and guaranteeing private investors, the Company increases industrial capacity. We can make use of their services ourselves, granting us a state of the art factory."
BAK_rdc_local_investment_funds:0 "RDC Investment Funds"
BAK_rdc_local_investment_funds_desc:0 "The RDC has several funds available to invest in regional projects. We could spend some time to lobby to the Company that they should invest more into our country. Not only might this help our industry, it may help to convince our population that the River Coalition is beneficial for our country."
BAK_develop_friends:0 "Send Delegations to the Northern Ponies"
BAK_develop_friends_desc:0 "The isolated Northern Ponies are a somewhat unknown factor to us. But most of the ponies in the Coalition see them as their long lost cousins either way. It is time to send some delegates and some precious gifts to these pony states so we can open up diplomatic contact."
BAK_develop_firtree:0 "Assist Firtree"
BAK_develop_firtree_desc:0 "The Firtree Villages are an agrarian society who have yet to fully industrialise. We can use the development grant program to help the Bonedrift government along. Perhaps if we show the ponies of Firtree our generosity, they will want to be our friends."
BAK_develop_farbrook:0 "Assist Farbrook"
BAK_develop_farbrook_desc:0 "Farbrook is the largest of the Northern Pony states, but the ponies there don't have it any better when it comes to their industry. If we assist the ponies of Farbrook, surely they will want to stick with us!"
BAK_develop_watertowns:0 "Assist the Watertowns"
BAK_develop_watertowns_desc:0 "We heard stories of the Legendary Holy Springs near the Watertowns. However, Holy Water seems to be about the only thing the small state has going for it. By assisting the Watertowns with industrial aid, they might be willing to establish closer ties with us."
BAK_friends_with_greneclyf:0 "Send an Emissary to the Changelings"
BAK_friends_with_greneclyf_desc:0 "Of the coast lies an island inhabited by strange creatures called Changelings. They surely look more like ponies than the griffons do and we have heard stories about their Queen being a harmonist. Perhaps if we reach out to them, we will be able to make an unlikely friend?"
BAK_expand_the_federation:0 "Offer Membership to the North"
BAK_expand_the_federation_desc:0 "Much has been done to improve ties between the Riverlands and the northern pony states. Emissaries have even been sent to the changelings of Greneclyf. It is time to go even farther and formally ask these states to join the treaty of Coltstream!"
BAK_free_movement:0 "A Free Travel Area"
BAK_free_movement_desc:0 "If our economies are to be integrated, it makes no sense that goods and people can't easily travel between the member states of the REC. We will propose a Free Travel Area between the countries, so that all our citizens can freely move around. This will surely help economic growth. With luck, it will also help create understanding between all the different people of the Community."
BAK_centeral_bank:0 "River Central Bank"
BAK_centeral_bank_desc:0 "To control the monetary matters of the Community, we must coordinate the efforts of the national banks of the member states. A Supranational Central Bank will make sure that the all national banks play fair. If we push this idea, perhaps we can deliver the Bank's first President, increasing our power in the expanding Community bureaucracy."
BAK_the_rivbit:0 "The Rivbit"
BAK_the_rivbit_desc:0 "It is a very annoying matter to exchange currency whenever you go abroad. This matter is even worse for companies that trade in more of the member state. To show both political unity and to help improve trade between the Community Members, let us propose a single currency, the Rivbit!"
BAK_the_river_union:0 "The River Union"
BAK_the_river_union_desc:0 "There has been a wild growth of institutions, tasks and laws regarding the River Economic Community. We will need a new Treaty Conference to make sense of it all and to untangle the bureaucratic mess we have created. With a free trade area, free travel and a single currency, we can proudly call ourselves The River Union now!"
BAK_river_army:0 "The River Army"
BAK_river_army_desc:0 "The Riverponies have stood side-by-side against foreign invaders for centuries. Having a unified River Army would help ensure the everlasting safety and security of the Union whilst helping pushing down the cost of defence for our member states."
BAK_river_government:0 "A United River Government"
BAK_river_government_desc:0 "It is time to reconsider the sovereignty of the Member State Governments. The River Union has proven way more competent in dealing with issues than the squabbling national governments. We will pressure them into resigning their veto for changing the treaty of Coltstream, effectively remodelling the River Commission into a united River Government."
BAK_the_federation:0 "The River Federation"
BAK_the_federation_desc:0 "After years of gradual integration, the River Union now finds itself ready to take the last step towards Federalisation. By revoking the right of secession and officially declaring the River Government the primary authority, the member states of the Coalition will cease to exist as a separate entity on the world stage. A dream for many, the River Federation will rise in their place as a global superpower."

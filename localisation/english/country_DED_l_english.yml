dread_start.2.desc:0 "" #TODO Rosa enters the room where Corpus is talking about his plans. There's clear discomfort with some elements of it amongst the assembled officers, Rosa can either speak out or stay silent. Maybe Corpus & Dominus talking about his hit on Order leadership?

dread_start.2.a:0 "Rosa speaks out." #TODO Gotta challenge the old man's authority, ya know? Leads into the next event.
dread_start.2.b:0 "Rosa stays silent." #TODO Sometimes unity in stupidity, is better than being a dividing smartass. Gives Rosa a national leader trait about her 'Stalwart' nature. Best for appeasing factions later on.

dread_start.201.t:0 ""
dread_start.201.desc:0 "" #TODO This event only fires is Rosa choses to speak out, this is Corpus's response to her where he tries to shoot her down... to which she may back down but the officers will take note and partly implement her ideas.

And maybe an off mention of Rubra being out doing her little sightseeing in Griffonia (Poor Corpus, his brainrot made him forgor.)

Known for his extensive narcissism, Corpus would have been just another lich if he had not possessed enough magical talent to overpower anyone who challenged him. Within his first few years of unlife, he had already proven himself to be more adept at necromancy than the vast majority of his peers. His skills attracted the attention of the Salvific Ossuary, which quickly inducted Corpus into their order.\n\nIn the centuries that followed, Corpus steadily rose through the ranks of the cult. This drew the ire of his fellow cultists, who knew that he obtained his positions not through religious zealotry, but through his natural talents. Perhaps the greatest heresy in their eyes was when Corpus became the High Priest in 941. Corpus didn't care about their religion in the slightest, but he couldn't resist the power that came with the position, for it earned him a seat on the Dread Council.\n\nSince then, he had neglected to do anything of substance for the religion he was in charge of, instead using and abusing his power to secure his position above all else. In 996, resentment within the cult's ranks had nearly reached a boiling point when their greatest wish came true: Corpus renounced his position as High Priest. He had taken a greater seat of power, one that previously belonged to the late Luvenis Maledicta, who had suffered her final death in her ill-fated conquest against the Arcturians.\n\nThus began the reign of the newest Dread King, Corpus Maledictus. A selfish lich who only takes action when it benefits him, and few are powerful enough to stand in his way.\n\n§YPortrait By:§! Neither"

She pursued her dreams, not realising how closely her talents treaded to taboo magic. Eventually, her reputation caught up with her, and she fled the country, then the continent. For the next thirty years, she travelled Griffonia as a nomadic scholar, gathering knowledge wherever she went. When she learned of a country on the fringe of the world that not only accepted, but actively dedicated itself to her particular talent, well, she just had to see it, didn't she?\n\n§YPortrait By§!: StardustSpix"

skellinore_gen_desc:0 "§YSummoned§!: 19th of October 992, in Neyhorn\n\n§YRank§!: Militia Leader\n\n§YBiography§!: Skellinore's post-death existence, in many ways, is an accident on the part of an Animus necromancer, Obit Animata, who sought to raise a mighty warrior to lead his army. Skellinore is not and never has been a warrior in her past life, and when the truth came out, her summoner was very displeased. Had any other necromancer done the deed, they would have cut the tendrils of unlife on a seemingly useless being.\n\nObit Animata, however, deemed the ritual of raising an intelligent undead too much of an investment to rid himself of Skellinore. He instead drafted the former scholar as a leader of his militia, despite Skellinore's reluctance and ineptitude.\n\nWith the threat of oblivion should she disappoint her new master, Skellinore had no choice but to take the helm as Obit Animata's militia leader. Though she had many difficulties, Skellinore has grown into her new position. In time, she has developed the logistical and experience needed to lead Obit Animata's hosts with a degree of competency that has yet to upset him.\n\nThis was not a path that Skellinore had ever considered in her previous life or this unlife. However, it is one that she can perhaps excel at despite all of the odds stacked against her. Maybe one day, she may even break free of her unlife of indentured servitude.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"

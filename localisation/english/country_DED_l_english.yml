DED_START_inspection_of_the_horde:0 "Another Day at the Helm"
DED_START_inspection_of_the_horde_desc:0 "The time has come for Corpus Maledictus to begin the yearly inspection of the undead hordes. As many suspect, it will probably be about as productive as the previous inspections.\n\nWhich is to say, not at all."

DED_START_echos_of_thunder:0 "Echoes of Thunder"
DED_START_echos_of_thunder_desc:0 "Rumours have surfaced of increased activity in the lands protected by the Arcturian Knights. To better assess the situation, Corpus has asked his most trusted informant to look into the matter and prepare a report for him."

DED_START_boons_of_the_library:0 "Bask in the Boons of the Library"
DED_START_boons_of_the_library_desc:0 "The Library of Magehold is many things, but it is never boring. It has been here long before we first arrived, and yet we have still only barely scratched the surface of the secrets within it. But no mountain was ever excavated all at once, and so we must pick it apart one tome at a time."

DED_START_empty_the_catacombs:0 "Prepare to Empty the Catacombs"
DED_START_empty_the_catacombs_desc:0 "It has been eleven years since Luvenis was slain, and we have spent the time since recuperating the losses sustained in her failed invasion. Now, Corpus believes that we must ready our undead armies for war once more. The only problem is, who is going to control them?"

DED_START_every_last_scrap:0 "Use Every Last Scrap of Metal"
DED_START_every_last_scrap_desc:0 "The vast majority of the undead are mindless, stupid creatures, but for the most part they are capable of holding a weapon and swinging it. A basic ghoul with a knife is much more dangerous than one with nothing at all. To that end, Corpus has mandated that every undead soldier be provided with at least a simple weapon."

DED_START_workshop_of_the_flesh_stitchers:0 "Commission the Stitcher of Flesh and Bone"
DED_START_workshop_of_the_flesh_stitchers_desc:0 "The Stitchers of Aeternum are by and far the biggest oddballs of the League. They reject almost all normal forms of necromancy, instead preferring to perform experiments so bizarre and grotesque that it has the rest of the League questioning whether or not they should be allowed to exist. But there is one who is worse than all of the others, and Corpus needs his help."

DED_START_directive_205:0 "Invoke Addendum V"
DED_START_directive_205_desc:0 "And so decrees Corpus Maledictus: This is now a time of crisis. As per the articles agreed upon by the first bearer of the Cursed Crown and their subjects, all able-bodied mages not serving an existing role within the League are henceforth conscripted into service to defend Magehold and any secondary territories from threats until said threats are neutralized."

DED_START_every_drop_of_blood:0 "And Every Drop of Blood"
DED_START_every_drop_of_blood_desc:0 "Though the undead hordes may be mighty, they have their limitations. Such shortcomings could be addressed by the multitude of vampires present throughout the League. To that end, Corpus believes that if the League is to succeed in the coming war, then he must enlist the help of the oldest, largest, and most powerful vampire house of all."

DED_START_new_hordes:0 "The New Hordes"
DED_START_new_hordes_desc:0 "Magehold is home to many numbers of necromancers with many different specialties. However, Corpus wishes for all of the newly conscripted mages to study the traditional methods of necromancy for what he claims will be their "biggest conflict yet". To this end, the Circle of the Salvific Ossuary has volunteered to host the first trainees in one of their grand cathedrals."

DED_START_whispers_of_dissent:0 "Murmurs of Dissent"
DED_START_whispers_of_dissent_desc:0 "It is widely known that Corpus Maledictus is unpopular among the mages of the League, but to what extent remains to be seen. Perhaps if he had not failed to crush the Arcturians after Luvenis was slain, he might hold more respect. One thing is certain, though: dissent is rising."

DED_START_the_snake_in_the_coup:0 "Consult the Webweaver"
DED_START_the_snake_in_the_coup_desc:0 "The illusive Count Dominus is not a vampire to be trifled with. Many say that he knows almost everything that goes on in the peninsula, and a lot of what goes on outside of it. In light of increasingly worrying events, Corpus has decided that the vampire lord needs to be reminded of his allegience."

DED_START_blade_in_their_shadow:0 "A Most Dangerous Game"
DED_START_blade_in_their_shadow_desc:0 "For some, the most powerful individuals are the ones who do not play their cards. The moment they do, the realities of their abilities become known to all. But if one's cards are strong enough... well, it doesn't matter if one uses them all at once, for there will be no enemies left to retaliate."

DED_START_to_surpass_luvenis:0 "To Surpass Luvenis"
DED_START_to_surpass_luvenis_desc:0 "Luvenis Maledicta, the previous ruler of the League, was feared and respected by almost everyone in Magehold. Her most notable feat was her nearly successful extermination of the Arcturian Knights in 996. While Corpus holds no such accomplishments, he knows that he must command the same respect if he is to stand up to her legacy."

DED_START_the_hunt:0 "Begin The Hunt"
DED_START_the_hunt_desc:0 "Just because the Rebound prevents most acts of violence within Magehold doesn't mean that everyone gets along. There are many individuals who have angered or slighted one another, especially those higher up than them on the totem pole. However, these acts cannot go unpunished, and so with Corpus' blessing, these troublemakers will be tracked down and their crimes identified for later judgement."

DED_START_a_hundred_names:0 "A Hundred Names"
DED_START_a_hundred_names_desc:0 "The guilty have been accounted for and their identities gathered. While Count Dominus knows they cannot be dealt with immediately, their names should still be given to Corpus."

DED_START_sounding_the_war_horns:0 "Incipimus Bellum"
DED_START_sounding_the_war_horns_desc:0 "The pieces are in place. Corpus Maledictus has manuevered his way through treachery and disloyalty, securing his rule. All that remains is his final decree, his magnum opus. This war shall cement his name in history."

dread_start.1.t:0 "Inspection of the Horde"
dread_start.1.d:0 "It was supposed to be an ordinary inspection. One of the many duties of the Dread King was to ensure that the undead armies of the League were ready for battle at any time. Normally a few liches would meet with Corpus Maledictus to accompany him throughout the inspection, yet when he arrived at the entrance to the Catacombs, there was nobody there to meet him.\n\nHe had gone in anyways, marching straight past the animated skeletons guarding the entrance. Soon after, he found the liches he had been looking for: a pair of bishops from the Circle of the Salvific Ossuary. They were speaking with a fancifully dressed vampire from the House of Rubra, whose grin only seemed to widen as she noticed Corpus approaching.\n\nAfter exchanging some heated words and unpleasantries, the vampire left, leaving Corpus with the two bishops. The atmosphere remained tense as the inspection began, for Corpus suspected that his accomplices had purposefully disregarded protocol out of disrespect, or perhaps even-\n\nA sudden explosion rocked the hall, causing Corpus to lose his purchase on the cold, stone flooring. His horn ignited, and the glimmerings of a magical barrier began to form around him. Unfortunately for the old lich, the ceiling collapsed before he could fully form the shield. He was crushed by the rubble, and his long-dead body ceased its movements once and for all."

dread_start.101.t:0 "What Is Dead May Never Die" #I lived, b*tch
dread_start.101.d:0 ""And the old fool got flattened! It was a sight to see!" Bishop Pravus laughed heartily, retelling the tale of Corpus' demise to a group of acolytes within his church. "And yet... it is hard to believe that it has been a few days since then. Feels like it occurred just a moment ago."\n\nThe acolytes, all mortals, seemed mesmerized by the bishop's tale. One, however, raised his hoof, "Bishop Pravus, what of Corpus' phylactery? Surely it would have revived him."\n\nThe bishop nodded towards the inquisitive pony. "Normally yes, though Corpus was always suspected to carry his phylactery on himself. He was quite paranoid that it would be stolen, and so he never hid it out of fear of-"\n\n"Fear of what, my good bishop?"\n\nAll heads turned to see a severely-pissed off walking corpse. Despite its heavily rotted and misshapen form, it was easily distinguishable as the one and only Corpus Maledictus.\n\nThe skeletal bishop flinched, taking a few steps back, "I... why it is good to see you again, Corpus! The entire council believed you to have perished and they were about to begin the process of-"\n\n"Need I remind you that I am a Lich, you conniving worm." Corpus approached the bishop and gently put a hoof onto his back, taking care not to trigger the Magisterium's favourite spell. "I don't know who tried to end me. But I will find out. And when I do, I will feed them and their phylactery to the Stitchers' monstrosities. Is that clear?" Corpus got only a short nod from the bishop."
dread_start.101.a:0 ""Good. Now kindly stop lying to your flock about my assumed death.""

dread_start.2.t:0 "Ruminations"
dread_start.2.d:0 "The candlelight was dim, casting little more than the faintest glow upon the parchment in front of Corpus. He was alone inside of his personal chambers, analyzing a report discreetly delivered to him by his most trusted informant, Count Dominus. The report indicated that the Arcturians were beginning to get rather serious about their militarization. To make matters worse, they were also working day and night to create advanced weapons that could destroy an undead so utterly that they could not be revived again.\n\nCorpus grimaced. This was not good, not good at all. His undead hordes were great in number, but slow and limited to simply throwing themselves and loose objects at their enemies. If the details in this report were true...\n\nHe paused to retrieve his phylactery from an enchanted strongbox hidden within the wall. Corpus gazed into the shaped onyx that guaranteed him immortality. The attempt on his unlife had left him shaken, and it was only because of this jewel that he had survived. He clutched it tightly as he felt a chill enter the room. If his assailants wanted him dead so badly, then they would surely try to steal away his phylactery. He couldn't afford to lose it. Perhaps... perhaps it would be best if he kept it with him from now on. They wouldn't dare strike his body down again, would they? Surely not... especially after it was made clear that he didn't keep his phylactery on him.\n\nThe ancient lich returned to his desk. His eyes fell upon a line near the bottom of the report. An addendum by Dominus. The vampire lord was suggesting that should the League not take this threat seriously, then the knights might very well be able to march all the way to Magehold with relative ease.\n\nCorpus needed to act. Yet enemies from within would attempt to destroy him even though it would spell their doom. How dare they! Corpus ignited his horn and incinerated the report. He was more powerful than the traitors working in the shadows! More powerful than all other necromancers, even the late Luvenis! Even the esteemed Vetus! He channeled his anger and threw his head down, whispering a prayer to Mordator. Corpus owed the dark god nothing, but He always listened to those who dared to utter His Name. The lich finished his prayer and stormed out of his quarters to make preparations for the coming war."
dread_start.2.a:0 "In the frozen darkness, a prayer was heard."

#Fires on completion of DED_START_boons_of_the_library ## This one describes the return of the latest expedition in the depths of the Library. Probably could have Rosa and Vetus appear in this one. Especially if we mention the specific book Rosa gets ... didn't you already write this one from the previous design? I have no idea, maybe I'm the one with brainrot ...
dread_start.3.t:0 "The Latest Expedition"
dread_start.3.d:0 "Among the Library of Magehold's myriad of oddities, its non-euclidean, ever-changing layout was perhaps its most interesting feature. Every so often, official expeditions would be organized by the Magisterium to search for new secrets and wonders to extract from the seemingly limitless wealth of magical knowledge held beneath their hooves.\n\nAt the main entrance of the Library sat an ancient lich known as Vetus Maledictus. Being the original Librarian of this place, he had visited the depths of the labyrinth on countless occasions, though he seldom went in anymore due to his declining mental health. Nowadays he spent his time looking through and cataloguing the new findings by more adventurous mages.\n\nAs the latest group to exit the Library passed off some spellbooks and artifacts to Vetus, he reflected on his last journey down there. Eighty years ago, was it? And he'd gotten lost for so long that the search party numbered in the thousands! They had even ended up finding him in the-\n\n"Excuse me, Vetus? Did they find it?"\n\nVetus tried to collect himself. Where was he? Ah yes, the entrance. And this unicorn before him... Right! A student of the Animus Institute! And a talented one at that! He attempted a smile, though the muscle tissue in his face had long since rotted away.\n\nThe unicorn shuffled in place, seemingly unsure of whether or not he heard her. "Um, Vetus? Everything okay? I was really hoping that they found some information on 'Organic-Inscription Matrices' like I had requested."\n\nThe old lich was unresponsive for a moment. The unicorn was about to gently shake him, but his hoof suddenly rose, "Yes, actually. Right here." Vetus picked up one of the many tomes retrieved by the expedition and levitated it over to the unicorn before him.\n\nA wide smile spread across her face as she accepted the tome, "Oh, thank you so much! You have no idea how important this is to my research!"\n\nVetus stared at her as she turned to leave. Such a nice young mare, she was. She trotted away with a spring in her step unique to few ponies in this forsaken corner of the world."
dread_start.3.a:0 "The unlife of a Librarian is never without its moments."

dread_start.4.t:0 "A Worrying Decree"
dread_start.4.d:0 "The central chambers of the Catacombs was profoundly massive in size, second only to the depths of the Library of Magehold. Being available to the public, the Catacombs often played host to many events and games by bored necromancers. Untold numbers of corpses in various states of decay were stored here and categorized according to how intact or preserved they were. Normally liches of the Salvific Ossuary would be attending to them, however...\n\n"I want all of you to prepare for a massive influx of new necromancers!" Corpus barked at the fancily-robed liches, "They are to be trained to raise and maintain at minimum four-hundred combat-ready undead each!"\n\nThe liches offered small bows, then one looked up. "But my lord, we are not teachers! Why not ask the instructors in the Animus Institute?"\n\n"I have other plans for them. You are Ascendants of the Salvific Ossuary, you know better than to question my orders. You shall instruct the next generation of necromancers for what is to come."\n\nAfter some hesitation, the liches bowed again. "Of... of course, my lord."\n\nIf Corpus noticed the hesitation, he didn't show it. "Good."\n\nBefore the concerned liches could ask further questions, Corpus turned to leave. This left them all very concerned. "We're preparing for war? Now?" murmured one as she looked between her colleagues. They all shrugged at her. It would seem that Corpus' orders had caught all of them by surprise."

dread_start.5.t:0 "Putting the Dead and Dying to Work"
dread_start.5.d:0 ""All right you rot, listen up!"\n\nThe glaze-eyed thralls and ghouls inside of the blacksmith's workshop halted their work, then turned to face the commanding voice. At the entrance to the workshop was a somewhat decayed pony who, despite not having lungs anymore, held a cigarette from a faraway land in his mouth. Something he seemed to treasure quite closely.\n\nFollowing his old smoking habits, the blacksmith tried to breathe in the fumes, only to remember that he could not do so anymore. He grumbled, then continued speaking, "Yous has been workin' hard, but we gots some new orders from above! The boneheads running the show want us to arm their ghoulies and skellies to the teeth! They promised me some right good bones for this, so here's what we need..."\n\nFrom swords, to spear tips, to basic armor for the mages, the blacksmith listed off all sorts of tools of war to be made. The thralls and ghouls listened wordlessly to every item, and when the blacksmith finished, they obediently began crafting the requested equipment. The blacksmith grinned as he watched his workers do their jobs. Acquiring thralls from the House of Rubra and hoof-crafted ghouls from the Animus Institute was definitely the best decision he had ever made. This was far more satisfying than his old life, for sure. To top it off, he didn't even have to pay his workers!"
dread_start.5.a:0 "They don't complain about the long hours, either!"

#Fires on completion of DED_START_workshop_of_the_flesh_stitchers
dread_start.6.t:0 "The Surgeon"
dread_start.6.d:0 "The workshops of the Stitchers of Aeternum were a place that no sane creature would ever set hoof in. Profane defilements to the concept of life were on display in every hall, every wall, and some were even strung from the ceiling. The worst were those that thrashed about when anything got near them.\n\nSuch vile abominations were precisely the reason why Corpus Maledictus was now here. After some brief difficulty in finding the necromancer he was looking for, he came across an open door with crackling sounds and flashing lights coming from within. Approaching the door, Corpus peered inside to see a screaming, writhing mass of flesh and limbs struggling against the restraints holding it to an operating table. Beside it was a blood-soaked unicorn with ragged eyes and sunken cheeks. Said unicorn briefly glanced at his visitor, then beckoned Corpus over with the bone saw in his hoof.\n\nThere were scarce few things that bothered the 700-year-old lich, but the monster in front of him was unnerving, even for him. Nevertheless, he skipped the pleasantries. "I require your services, Magnus Medicus."\n\n"To use my full title means that this must be rather important," The unicorn set down his bone saw and leaned against the table, "What ever can I do for you, Maledictus?"\n\n"There is going to be war with the Arcturians. I need an army of these... things."\n\nAn eerie, unnatural smile formed on the unicorn. "Of course. Any opportunity to test out my creations is a welcome one. I will need time to make more, however."\n\nCorpus eyed the creature on the table. It seemed like it once was an ordinary pony, but now with several extra limbs in unnatural locations, along with sharpened bone fragments jutting out of it. It reeked of repeated necromantic magicks. Evidently it had died several times during surgery, only to be brought back again and again. He saw an eye open and stare at him. It looked like it was... pleading?\n\nThe lich tried to ignore thought that this abomination might still be conscious. "I want these to be the first things that the Arcturians see when we meet them in battle.""
dread_start.6.a:0 "Which is the real monster? The creation, or the creator?"

#Fires on completion of DED_START_directive_205
dread_start.7.t:0 "A Proclamation to the Institute"
dread_start.7.d:0 "Gathered in the great hall of the Animus Institute were thousands of necromancers of all sorts. Normally they would be listening to a seminar by the esteemed Praeceptor Vitae, but when the time came for the scheduled speech, instead they were surprised to see the Dread King and his attendants enter the stage instead of the Institute's headmaster. Their surprise was magnified as Corpus' aide began to speak on a topic that the League was rather unfamiliar with: Conscription.\n\n"...And so, by order of Corpus Maledictus, all non-essential members of the Animus Institute shall prepare themselves to report to the Catacombs for training in the traditional methods of necromancy, as well as..." The speaker droned on, giving no heed to the shocked faces and rising murmurs in the crowd before them.\n\nThough the necromancers of the Institute were vaguely aware of the possibility that they may be required to help defend the League if it were ever threatened, this had always seemed so unlikely, so impossible that many of them couldn't believe it. Some older liches grumbled at the annoyance of having to go deal with the knights again, while others worried about their work being copied or stolen, and many even outright protested at the very idea of being forced to practice rudimentary necromancy.\n\nEventually, the complaints got so loud that Corpus interrupted his aide. "Enough! I am your king, and you shall obey me! Report to the Catacombs in two weeks, or I shall have the Magisterium blacklist you from the Rebound! I'm sure that you will be fine with being the only creatures in Magehold who aren't protected by their ridiculous spell."\n\nThe crowd went silent almost immediately, save for a few mages near the back. A young, mortal mare and her small group of colleagues continued to whisper amongst themselves. They were so close to a breakthrough in sapience matrices, and this was the last thing they needed..."
dread_start.7.a:0 "Conscription? Really? As if the knights could ever get to Magehold!"

#Fires nearly two weeks after dread_start.7
dread_start.701.t:0 "Vita Post Mortem"
dread_start.701.d:0 "The atmosphere within the east wing laboratory was tense. A few mages of the Animus Institute had been working tirelessly to finalize their creation before they were forced to report to the Catacombs. One such mage was analyzing the test subject, a freshly deceased pony, looking between a parchment and the corpse. "You're sure that the matrix will work, Wilt? These spells aren't supposed to be combined like this."\n\nThe young mare sighed in response, but did not cease her magical tinkering with the spell matrix surrounding the corpse. "We're out of time. It has to work if we are to convince Corpus and the others that what we're doing here is the future of necromancy."\n\n"You know that they won't listen. They're too stuck in their ways." said another mage.\n\nWilted Rose closed her eyes and took a deep breath. They were right, and she knew it, but she couldn't just give up now. "Look. Stupid undead like those that the Ossuary raises are just tools, and semi-intelligent ghouls are too limited to accomplish anything meaningful. What we're trying to do here could change everything. If we can manage to create an undead just as smart as the day they died - with the ability to use magic - then maybe they could do great things. Things that could surprise everyone."\n\nOne of the mages set down their parchment and put a hoof on Wilted's back. "You are trying to do something that is impossible. Truly intelligent ghouls akin to living beings are exceedingly difficult to make, but ghouls with magical capabilities of their own? We know this project means a lot to you, but... it's madness to keep beating your head against a wall like this."\n\nWilted looked down, staring into the cold, lifeless eyes of the body before her. She was silent for a moment, then without moving she spoke again, "Let's just run the test one more time, okay?"\n\nShe heard a sigh. "Very well." All of the mages present ignited their horns and focused their magic on the corpse. Each had a role to play, trying to weave an intricate web of spell upon spell into the matrices that would sustain their creation. One misalignment could render it non-functional, and so they took their time casting the spells. When it was all said and done, they waited patiently for the corpse to move. Though as the seconds turned into minutes, the mages resigned in defeat. One by one, they left the room, leaving Wilted Rose all by herself with her failed experiment. But just as she got up to leave..."

dread_start.8.d:0 "Upon two lush chairs recently "imported" from the region of Westkeep were two of the most influential beings in Magehold. One had gone out of his way to wear his regalia, while the other wore a fine, white dress with a lavish hat.\n\n"I do appreciate you taking time out of your 'busy' schedule to meet with me, Lady Rubra."\n\n"Of course, my dear Corpus. The timing of my recent vacation was most unfortunate, but know that my House is always looking for opportunities to show our superiority."\n\nThe vampire sitting across from Corpus was sipping from a teacup filled with fine red liquid, taking great care not to spill any. Being the oldest vampire in Magehold, she was also one of the most powerful. Her bloodline held some of the fiercest vampires and strongest thralls, and that was why Corpus was here today.\n\n"May I ask a favour of you, my Lady?" Corpus bit his rotting tongue. He hated having to treat her as an equal, but the infamous Crimson Mare held too much sway in Magehold for him to utilize his kingly status.\n\nShe stood from her chair, rising a full head taller than Corpus and most other ponies for that matter. Rubra's earth pony heritage had blessed her with a larger stature than most; a fact that she utilized quite often to intimidate others. "Well that depends upon what it is you need, 'O King'." She grinned, emulating the mannerisms of Count Dominus.\n\nCorpus remained seated as Rubra turned to browse a large cabinet of blood-infused wine. "I humbly request some of your finest warriors. The Arcturians are preparing to invade us."\n\nRubra's ears perked, "What an interesting request..." She closed the cabinet and turned to approach Corpus, "Though I am curious, what do I get out of this?" Corpus said nothing for a moment, seeming to be carefully considering his next words. As he opened his mouth, Rubra interrupted him, "Ah, I jest. You are king, are you not? I would be happy to serve the rightful ruler of Magehold in any way I can." She grinned again, offering an overly deep bow, "You shall have my House at your command.""

It's insulting!"\n\n"Calm down Wilt, the High Priestess is here. Don't make a scene."\n\nThe recently conscripted necromancers of the League were assembled inside one of the Salvific Ossuary's cathedrals above the Catacombs. Standing upon the platform before them was one of the many bishops belonging to the Ossuary. He was preaching ad naseum about the traditional methods of raising the dead, and how if they wanted to be successful in the coming war, then they needed to practice and perfect those methods.\n\nWilted Rose eyed the fancily-robed lich sitting on an ornate throne behind the bishop. "Just because she's in the Dread Council doesn't mean I have to respect her. She's just as responsible for this mess as Corpus is."\n\nThe young lich standing next to Wilt shrugged. "Maybe, but it's not like we can do anything about it. The Animus Institute is probably going to be disbanded soon."\n\n"We could if they saw what we were working on..." She grumbled to herself.\n\nAs the bishop droned on, he seemed to notice the apathetic reception to his speech. He turned towards the seated lich behind him and whispered a few words. They nodded to each other, and then the bishop spoke once more. "You will now have the opportunity to hear a sacred lesson from our venerated High Priestess! Behold, Sanctae Tenebrae of the Circle of the Salvific Ossuary!"\n\nAny murmurs in the crowd immediately dissipated as the High Priestess took to the stand. Sanctae Tenebrae held significant sway in Magehold, and anything she said was not to be taken lightly, even if one wasn't a member of her fanatical church.\n\nHer voice was as commanding as it was solemn. "Servants of Mordator! We exist in perilous times. The loathsome knights of Arcturius gather to strike us even now, and in our pride we sit here and do nothing!" Sanctae rose her forehooves above her in reverence, "O Mordator, grant us the strength to bless our enemies with the eternal sleep thou'st desirest for all the unholy! The faith to slay the wicked who steal away years they have no right to live! With this, we pray to thee!""

Naught but books and the occasional cleaning ghoul were around them, granting them a rare opportunity to speak freely without potential eavesdroppers.\n\n"What I'm saying," continued the young, mortal mare, "is that we're not the only ones unhappy with the way Corpus is running things."\n\nThe sole vampire of the group chuckled and shook his head, "Come on, Wilt. I find it hard to believe that this was more than just an isolated prank. What you're suggesting is that-"\n\n"If they can kill Corpus once then they can do it again!" The mortal mare put her hoof on the table, meeting the gaze of everyone at the table. "And maybe they'll find his phylactery too, and that'll be the end of him.

He had summoned some trusted aids from the Salvific Ossuary and went to one of Lady Rubra's extravagantly decorated manors with the intent to speak with her, but it had been nearly ten minutes without a sign of the infamous Crimson Mare. So now he stood in the finely crafted foyer with his entourage.\n\nEventually, a scrawny, well-dressed mortal with glazed eyes appeared from one of the many doors. "I'm very sorry my lord, but I regret to inform you that Her Ladyship is not home at present, and is currently away on vacation in the region of Aquileia-"\n\nCorpus gritted his teeth. "This is ridiculous. Why does she not inform me of her comings and goings? As a member of the Dread Council she should know better than to waste my time." As he finished speaking, the thought occurred to him that she might have left him in the dark on purpose out of disrespect. This only irritated him further.\n\nHe suddenly turned to leave the manor, leaving his accomplices surprised and scurrying to catch up with him. As they regained pace with him, Corpus began to rant, "This is unacceptable! Traitors trying to murder me, disrespect at every opportunity, leaving me uninformed on crucial matters, and worst of all, they do it behind my back!"\n\nOne of the liches accompanying Corpus attempted to calm him. "With all due respect, perhaps the great Count Dominus could aid you in this matter? His web of knowledge stretches far, and he has never failed you."\n\n"That's... not a terrible idea," Corpus paused to consider the suggestion. The self-proclaimed Lord of Secrets might be able to help him root out the traitors responsible for undermining his authority. It was likely his best option now. "Send word to the good Count that I am summoning him for an audience."\n\n"Consider it done." The lich nodded and bowed, then quickly departed."

dread_start.11.d:0 ""My lord, Count Dominus has arrived."\n\nCorpus nodded, then signaled to his undead servants to let him in. The grand doors to the throne room were pulled open by two teams of skeletons, and in walked a finely robed vampire with a demeanour to match. He sauntered with such precision that all but the most astute observers would believe him to be floating across the ground.\n\nThe vampire stopped when he was but a few paces before Corpus. With a humble bow, he spoke, "To what do I owe the pleasure, O king?"\n\nCorpus allowed himself a smirk. At least the good Count still treated him with the respect he deserved. "I require an update on your infiltration of the Arcturian Knights."\n\n"They have their claws and hooves full dealing with my children and their spawn," Dominus rose to meet Corpus' gaze, "I have eyes and ears nearly everywhere in their land." The vampire then glanced around at the servants present in the throne room. The barest hint of annoyance crossed his face before dissipating. "Though I am still working on securing an agent in their strongholds."\n\nAt least something is going well, Corpus thought. "I need you to make preparations to strike them soon. Eliminate their precious headmaster and his cohorts before he leads them into battle."\n\nDominus' expression was inscrutable. "This will be a very costly manuever. Are you sure you want me to do this?"\n\n"Burn any assets you have to do it. I don't care how much it takes, I want him dead! I will be known as the one who struck down the knight who slew Luvenis!"\n\nThe vampire lord briefly closed his eyes. "It will be done, O king. Will there be anything else?"\n\n"As a matter of fact, yes," Corpus brought a hoof to his chin in thought, "Investigate the matter of the attempt on my unlife. I want the traitor responsible found and brought before me!"\n\nDominus bowed once more, hiding a smile, "With respect, I am already investigating this matter. I will know who murdered you before long.""

dread_start.12.d:0 "Within an inconspicuous manor on the outskirts of Magehold was a certain chamber. A chamber that held enough information on everyone in Magehold to bring the city tumbling down if it fell into the wrong hooves. On top of that, it contained various maps of the Arcturian territories as well as lands beyond theirs. On those maps were multiple markings indicating vampire cells and their positions. There were several scattered around the Tarpian Rock, with the occasional cell positioned in the tribal villages of Farbrook and the Watertowns.\n\nStaring at one map was a single individual: the self-proclaimed Lord of Secrets. Count Dominus was pondering whether or not it was worth it to obey Corpus' order. The fool had demanded something truly asinine; that Dominus sacrifice nearly every single one of his vampiric agents to take out as much of the Arcturians' leadership structure as possible.\n\nDominus frowned. This would set him back at least a decade. Maybe two. Good infiltrators were hard to mould, especially ones as skilled as his.\n\nHis eyes drifted towards the eastern section of one map. On it was a mysterious island with a big question mark on it. It made his blood boil knowing that he would have to wait even longer to make another attempt to infiltrate that blasted island with its cursed shapeshifters. Every single vampire he had sent to it never reported back...\n\nDominus averted his gaze. He would establish a cell there eventually. For now, he plucked some pins from the map and moved them all into a circle around the primary fortresses of the Arcturians. He knew that the act he was about to perform would only serve to infuriate and embolden the knights, but perhaps there was a small chance that he could remove enough of them that Corpus could be replaced with a competent leader before the knights could reorganize themselves and attack.\n\nHe smiled as a thought passed his mind. It was ironic; he had engineered a successful assassination on Corpus Maledictus, and now he was about to do the same to the infamous Torygg of the Arcturian Order. The only difference here was that the aging mortal wouldn't get back up."

He paced back and forth, mumbling words to himself over and over.\n\n"...And when we launch our counterattack against the Arcturians, I shall finish what my predecessor, Luvenis Maledicta, had started-" The door hinges squeaked, causing Corpus to whip his head towards the intrusive noise. "Who is there?! Begone, I am busy!"\n\nFor a moment, all he could sense was a chilly breeze from the open door. As he ignited his horn to slam it shut, a skeleton knocked at it, then poked its head inside. "My lord, I have the new robes you have ordered."\n\nCorpus paused, restraining his desire to shout at his secretary. "Bring them in, then go. Have the bellbones announce that I will be making a city-wide declaration soon... and make sure they convey that this will be the most important one yet!"\n\nThe skeletal servant deftly placed the robes onto a table, then meekly nodded as it departed. Corpus levitated the clothing over to himself and examined them. A fine black robe emblazoned with white symbols and red outlines all over, with severed unicorn horns propped up around where his neck would fit.\n\nHe allowed himself to smile. For once, he was pleased with his tailor's work.\n\nBut what if he couldn't live up to the great accomplishments of Luvenis? Insecurity seemed to wash over him as that blasted breeze filtered into his quarters. He slammed the door shut and continued to practice his speech in peace and quiet."

As they reached it, they took up positions surrounding the modest structure. One of the vampires approached the front door and knocked on it. After a moment, a drowsy unicorn answered the door.\n\n"Why do you immortal bastards insist on waking the living in the middle of the night? What do you even want?" The unicorn yawned as he rubbed his eyes.\n\n"We want only one thing," the vampire smiled, fangs glistening in the moonlight, "You attempted to kill Corpus."\n\nThe unicorn seemed perplexed at first, then unnerved as the vampire before him waited patiently. "I... what? I did no such thing. And what do you mean by 'we'?"\n\nThe unicorn was suddenly grasped from above by more vampires as they hefted him onto the roof. He attempted to yell, but a hoof to his mouth silenced any calls for help.\n\nThe first vampire rose to the roof and stood overtop the mortal unicorn. "I am not asking 'Did you attempt to kill Corpus?' I am merely telling you that you did. Are we clear?"\n\nThe unicorn whimpered and nodded quickly. Then as quickly as his assailants arrived, they departed, leaving the poor pony stranded on his rooftop.\n\nAs the vampires made their way to their next target, one of the others spoke up, "Why make them say that? We're not fooling anyone."\n\n"The Count wishes for us to make his enemies confess to this specific crime. Ask any more questions and you will find yourself added to that list...""

dread_start.15.d:0 "The silence of midnight gave way to a knock at the door. Despite the faintness of the sound, it roused Corpus from his bed. His mind began to race. His servants knew never to interrupt his rest, especially since lately he had extreme difficulty in casting the sleeping spell on himself. Even in immortality, a lich's mind could only stay conscious for so long before mental exhaustion began to set in. Sleeping spells helped to remedy that issue, forcing the mind to enter a state of rest even when the body itself could not slip into slumber.\n\nAs Corpus reached the door, he preemptively cast a shield spell around himself. Just in case, he reasoned. He then swung open the door, prepared to face an adversary, only to be met with the stoic face of Count Dominus. Corpus immediately composed himself. "Ah, my good Count... I was not expecting you."\n\nThe vampire lord procured a small parchment from his cloak and offered it to Corpus. "I have confirmed the identities of those who conspired against you."\n\nCorpus took the parchment and examined it. Worry began to form on his face. "This is many more names than I would have thought. Are you sure that their treachery runs this deep?"\n\nDominus' expression remained neutral. "My agents are very thorough. All of the individuals on this list have confessed to undermining your rule, or to helping in your attempted assassination. The Rebound, however, prevented me from granting them the oblivion they deserve."\n\n"Yes, yes of course..." Corpus murmured as he began to pace back and forth. "Keep tabs on them all, if possible. Soon I will bend the Magisterium to my will, then I'll have the traitors on this list blacklisted from their stupid spell. You have done admirably, Count Dominus. Now go, I must return to my rest."\n\nWithout another word, Dominus bowed and departed from Corpus' chambers. Once he was fully out of sight, a slight grin appeared on his face. The undead fool would certainly have all of those "guilty" creatures killed at the first opportunity. He didn't need to know that all of the names present on the list were not in fact enemies of the Dread King, but instead were those that had crossed Dominus in the past."

dread_start.16.d:0 "All throughout Magehold, thousands had gathered in the central courtyard to listen to what Corpus' bellbones had said would be the "single most important announcement in the League's history". Many had questions and concerns regarding the recent conscriptions and supposed militarization of the Arcturians, though none could find any firm answers about either. They hoped that whatever would be said today would address their worries.\n\nAtop the castle balcony, Corpus gazed out towards his subjects. Though he seldom wore his regalia, today he was not only wearing his crown, but also a pompous black robe adorned with tawdy decorations. Beside him were some members of the Dread Council, including Count Dominus, Lady Rubra, and Sanctae Tenebrae.\n\nCorpus lifted a hoof, quieting the crowd. "Throughout our history, there have been many great wars fought between the League and the Arcturians. From the drawn-out conflicts of old to the costly battles of yesteryear, neither of us has managed to fully destroy the other.\n\n"However," he paused, "There has been some developments. The Arcturians have been developing advanced weapons as well as replenishing their numbers since Luvenis' failed invasion. Even now they prepare to march into the peninsula with the goal to destroy us. But we are not mere mortals with swords, we are the most talented mages in history! They cannot hope to stand up to us, so long as we are ready!\n\n"With the threat of extermination at our doorstep, you shall bring the fight to the Arcturians before they can take a single step into the peninsula! I shall finish what my predecessor, Luvenis Maledicta, had started! Tonight you shall march towards the border and meet them in glorious battle, and you shall not stop until every last one of them is a rotting corpse under your command!"\n\nDespite the zeal in Corpus' speech, only a scarce few of the assembled inhabitants of Magehold seemed to share it. Some cheered, but stopped as they realized that no one else was joining in."

This is idiotic!"\n\nAs Corpus tried to silence the crowd, Count Dominus stepped forward and spoke with a commanding voice unfamiliar to all but his personal agents. "It would seem," he began, "That Corpus has finally succumbed to Mind Rot."\n\nIf looks could kill, the Rebound would have struck Corpus for the sheer malevolence in his gaze towards the vampire lord. "You..."\n\nDominus did not pay Corpus any heed. "My children have been monitoring the Arcturians for some time. Despite the heavy losses we inflicted on them years ago, they are now stronger than ever. As some of you may know, the occasional knight has used new, portable ranged weaponry in recent times. Now they are procuring so many of these weapons that if we were to assault them with the same tactics of old, our forces would be cut down before we even reached their walls."\n\nThe atmosphere became filled with suspense as all eyes and ears centered upon Dominus and Corpus. While the Dread Lord was visibly simmering, Dominus continued before Corpus could get any words in. "Marching to war in our current state would be not only disastrous, but it would likely also spell the end of our existence if the Arcturians decided to invade the peninsula. It has become clear that with the recent questionable or outright atrocious decisions made by Corpus, he is no longer capable of leading the League. With the Dread Council's approval, I would like to invoke the Rite of the Immortal Games, allowing anyone in Magehold to prove their worth and to challenge Corpus Maledictus for the throne."\n\nThough Corpus immediately tried to call out Dominus for his treachery, the now-lively crowd drowned out any hope of resolving this mess through any means other than the ancient tradition."

Known for his extensive narcissism, Corpus would have been just another lich if he had not possessed enough magical talent to overpower anyone who challenged him. Within his first few years of unlife, he had already proven himself to be more adept at necromancy than the vast majority of his peers. His skills attracted the attention of the Salvific Ossuary, which quickly inducted Corpus into their order.\n\nIn the centuries that followed, Corpus steadily rose through the ranks of the cult. This drew the ire of his fellow cultists, who knew that he obtained his positions not through religious zealotry, but through his natural talents. Perhaps the greatest heresy in their eyes was when Corpus became the High Priest in 941. Corpus didn't care about their religion in the slightest, but he couldn't resist the power that came with the position, for it earned him a seat on the Dread Council.\n\nSince then, he had neglected to do anything of substance for the religion he was in charge of, instead using and abusing his power to secure his position above all else. In 996, resentment within the cult's ranks had nearly reached a boiling point when their greatest wish came true: Corpus renounced his position as High Priest. He had taken a greater seat of power, one that previously belonged to the late Luvenis Maledicta, who had suffered her final death in her ill-fated conquest against the Arcturians.\n\nThus began the reign of the newest Dread King, Corpus Maledictus.

Had any other necromancer done the deed, they would have cut the tendrils of unlife on a seemingly useless being.\n\nObit Animata, however, deemed the ritual of raising an intelligent undead too much of an investment to rid himself of Skellinore.

Though she had many difficulties, Skellinore has grown into her new position. In time, she has developed the logistical and experience needed to lead Obit Animata's hosts with a degree of competency that has yet to upset him.\n\nThis was not a path that Skellinore had ever considered in her previous life or this unlife. However, it is one that she can perhaps excel at despite all of the odds stacked against her. Maybe one day, she may even break free of her unlife of indentured servitude.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"

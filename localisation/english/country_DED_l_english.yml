DED_START_inspection_of_the_horde:0 "Another Day at the Helm"
DED_START_inspection_of_the_horde_desc:0 "The time has come for Corpus Maledictus to begin the yearly inspection of the undead hordes. As many suspect, it will probably be about as productive as the previous inspections.\n\nWhich is to say, not at all."

DED_START_echos_of_thunder:0 "Echoes of Thunder"
DED_START_echos_of_thunder_desc:0 "Rumours have surfaced of increased activity in the lands protected by the Arcturian Knights. To better assess the situation, Corpus has asked his most trusted informant to look into the matter and prepare a report for him."

DED_START_boons_of_the_library:0 "Bask in the Boons of the Library"
DED_START_boons_of_the_library_desc:0 "The Library of Magehold is many things, but it is never boring. It has been here long before we first arrived, and yet we have still only barely scratched the surface of the secrets within it. But no mountain was ever excavated all at once, and so we must pick it apart one tome at a time."

DED_START_empty_the_catacombs:0 "Prepare to Empty the Catacombs"
DED_START_empty_the_catacombs_desc:0 "It has been eleven years since Luvenis was slain, and we have spent the time since recuperating the losses sustained in her failed invasion. Now, Corpus believes that we must ready our undead armies for war once more. The only problem is, who is going to control them?"

DED_START_every_last_scrap:0 "Use Every Last Scrap of Metal"
DED_START_every_last_scrap_desc:0 "The vast majority of the undead are mindless, stupid creatures, but for the most part they are capable of holding a weapon and swinging it. A basic ghoul with a knife is much more dangerous than one with nothing at all. To that end, Corpus has mandated that every undead soldier be provided with at least a simple weapon."

DED_START_workshop_of_the_flesh_stitchers:0 "Commission the Stitcher of Flesh and Bone"
DED_START_workshop_of_the_flesh_stitchers_desc:0 "The Stitchers of Aeternum are by and far the biggest oddballs of the League. They reject almost all normal forms of necromancy, instead preferring to perform experiments so bizarre and grotesque that it has the rest of the League questioning whether or not they should be allowed to continue them. But there is one who is worse than all of the others, and Corpus needs his help."

DED_START_directive_205:0 "Invoke Addendum V"
DED_START_directive_205_desc:0 "And so decrees Corpus Maledictus: This is now a time of crisis. As per the articles agreed upon by the first bearer of the Cursed Crown and their subjects, all able-bodied mages not serving an existing role within the League are hence forth conscripted into service to defend Magehold and any secondary territories from threats until said threats are neutralized."

DED_START_whispers_of_dissent:0 "Murmurs of Dissent"
DED_START_whispers_of_dissent_desc:0 "It is widely known that Corpus Maledictus is unpopular among the mages of the League, but to what extent remains to be seen. Perhaps if he had not failed to crush the Arcturians after Luvenis was slain, he might hold more respect. One thing is certain, though: dissent is rising."

DED_START_the_snake_in_the_coup:0 "Consult the Webweaver"
DED_START_the_snake_in_the_coup_desc:0 "The illusive Count Dominus is not a vampire to be trifled with. Many say that he knows almost everything that goes on in the peninsula, and a lot of what goes on outside of it. In light of increasingly worrying events, Corpus has decided that the vampire lord needs to be reminded of his allegience."

DED_START_blade_in_their_shadow:0 "A Most Dangerous Game"
DED_START_blade_in_their_shadow_desc:0 "For some, the most powerful individuals are the ones who do not play their cards. The moment they do, the realities of their abilities become known to all. But if one's cards are strong enough... well, it doesn't matter if one uses them all at once, for there will be no enemies left to retaliate."

#Fires during DED_START_inspection_of_the_horde
dread_start.1.t:0 "Inspection of the Horde"
dread_start.1.d:0 "It was supposed to be an ordinary inspection. One of the many duties of the Dread King was to ensure that the undead armies of the League were ready for battle at any time. Normally a few liches would meet with Corpus Maledictus to accompany him throughout the inspection, yet when he arrived at the entrance to the Catacombs, there was nobody there to meet him.\n\nHe had gone in anyways, marching straight past the animated skeletons guarding the entrance. Soon after, he found the liches he had been looking for: a pair of bishops from the Circle of the Salvific Ossuary. They were speaking with a fancifully dressed vampire from House Rubra, whose expression was inscrutable as she noticed Corpus approaching.\n\nAfter exchanging some heated words and unpleasantries, the vampire left, leaving Corpus with the two bishops. The atmosphere remained tense as the inspection began, for Corpus suspected that his accomplices had purposefully disregarded protocol out of disrespect, or perhaps even-\n\nA sudden explosion rocked the hall, causing Corpus to lose his purchase on the cold, stone flooring. His horn ignited, and the glimmerings of a magical barrier began to form around him. Unfortunately for the old lich, the ceiling collapsed before he could fully form the shield. He was crushed by the rubble, and his long-dead body ceased its movements once and for all."

dread_start.101.t:0 "What Is Dead May Never Die" #I lived, b*tch
dread_start.101.d:0 ""And the old fool got flattened! It was a sight to see!" Bishop Pravus laughed heartily, retelling the tale of Corpus' demise to a group of acolytes within his church. "And yet... it is hard to believe that it has been a few days since then. Feels like it occurred just a moment ago."\n\nThe acolytes, all mortals, seemed mesmerized by the bishop's tale. One, however, raised his hoof, "Bishop Pravus, what of Corpus' phylactery? Surely it would have revived him."\n\nThe bishop nodded towards the inquisitive pony. "Normally yes, though Corpus was always suspected to carry his phylactery on himself. He was quite paranoid that it would be stolen, and so he never hid it out of fear of-"\n\n"Fear of what, my good bishop?"\n\nAll heads turned to see a severely-pissed off walking corpse. Despite its heavily rotted and misshapen form, it was easily distinguishable as the one and only Corpus Maledictus.\n\nThe skeletal bishop flinched, taking a few steps back, "I... why it is good to see you again, Corpus! The entire council believed you to have perished and they were about to begin the process of-"\n\n"Need I remind you that I am a Lich, you conniving worm." Corpus approached the bishop and gently put a hoof onto his back, taking care not to trigger the Magisterium's favourite spell. "I don't know who tried to end me. But I will find out. And when I do, I will feed them and their phylactery to the Stitchers' monstrosities. Is that clear?" Corpus got only a short nod from the bishop."
dread_start.101.a:0 ""Good. Now kindly stop lying to your flock about my assumed death.""

#Fires on completion of DED_START_echos_of_thunder
dread_start.2.t:0 "Ruminations"
dread_start.2.d:0 "The candlelight was dim, casting little more than the faintest glow upon the parchment in front of Corpus. He was alone inside of his personal chambers, analyzing a report discreetly delivered to him by his most trusted informant, Count Dominus. The report indicated that the Arcturians were beginning to get rather serious about their militarization. To make matters worse, they were also working day and night to create advanced weapons that could destroy an undead so utterly that they could not be revived again.\n\nCorpus grimaced. This was not good, not good at all. His undead hordes were great in number, but slow and limited to simply throwing themselves and loose objects at their enemies. If the details in this report were true...\n\nHe paused to retrieve his phylactery from an enchanted strongbox hidden within the wall. Corpus gazed into the shaped onyx that guaranteed him immortality. The attempt on his unlife had left him shaken, and it was only because of this jewel that he had survived. He clutched it tightly as he felt a chill enter the room. If his assailants wanted him dead so badly, then they would surely try to steal away his phylactery. He couldn't afford to lose it. Perhaps... perhaps it would be best if he kept it with him from now on. They wouldn't dare strike his body down again, would they? Surely not... especially after it was made clear that he didn't keep his phylactery on him.\n\nThe ancient lich returned to his desk. His eyes fell upon a line near the bottom of the report. An addendum by Dominus. The vampire lord was suggesting that should the League not take this threat seriously, then the knights might very well be able to march all the way to Magehold with relative ease.\n\nCorpus needed to act. Yet enemies from within would attempt to destroy him even though it would spell their doom. How dare they! Corpus ignited his horn and incinerated the report. He was more powerful than the traitors working in the shadows! More powerful than all other necromancers, even the late Luvenis! Even the esteemed Vetus! He channeled his anger and threw his head down, whispering a prayer to Mordator. Corpus owed the dark god nothing, but He always listened to those who dared to utter His Name. The lich finished his prayer and stormed out of his quarters to make preparations for the coming war."
dread_start.2.a:0 "In the frozen darkness, a prayer was heard."

#Fires on completion of DED_START_boons_of_the_library ## This one describes the return of the latest expedition in the depths of the Library. Probably could have Rosa and Vetus appear in this one. Especially if we mention the specific book Rosa gets ... didn't you already write this one from the previous design? I have no idea, maybe I'm the one with brainrot ...
dread_start.3.t:0 "The Latest Expedition"
dread_start.3.d:0 "Among the Library of Magehold's myriad of oddities, its non-euclidean, ever-changing layout was perhaps its most interesting feature. Every so often, official expeditions would be organized by the Magisterium to search for new secrets and wonders to extract from the seemingly limitless wealth of magical knowledge held beneath their hooves.\n\nAt the main entrance of the Library sat an ancient lich known as Vetus Maledictus. Being the original Librarian of this place, he had visited the depths of the labyrinth on countless occasions, though he seldom went in anymore due to his declining mental health. Nowadays he spent his time looking through and cataloguing the new findings by more adventurous mages.\n\nAs the latest group to exit the Library passed off some spellbooks and artifacts to Vetus, he reflected on his last journey down there. Eighty years ago, was it? And he'd gotten lost for so long that the search party numbered in the thousands! They had even ended up finding him in the-\n\n"Excuse me, Vetus? Did they find it?"\n\nVetus tried to collect himself. Where was he? Ah yes, the entrance. And this unicorn before him... Right! A student of the Animus Institute! And a talented one at that! He attempted a smile, though the muscle tissue in his face had long since rotted away.\n\nThe unicorn shuffled in place, seemingly unsure of whether or not he heard her. "Um, Vetus? Everything okay? I was really hoping that they found some information on 'Organic-Inscription Matrices' like I had requested."\n\nThe old lich was unresponsive for a moment. The unicorn was about to gently shake him, but his hoof suddenly rose, "Yes, actually. Right here." Vetus picked up one of the many tomes retrieved by the expedition and levitated it over to the unicorn before him.\n\nA wide smile spread across her face as she accepted the tome, "Oh, thank you so much! You have no idea how important this is to my research!"\n\nVetus stared at her as she turned to leave. Such a nice young mare, she was. She trotted away with a spring in her step unique to few ponies in this forsaken corner of the world."
dread_start.3.a:0 "The unlife of a Librarian is never without its moments."

#Fires on completion of DED_START_empty_the_catacombs
dread_start.4.t:0 "A Worrying Decree"
dread_start.4.d:0 "The central chambers of the Catacombs was profoundly massive in size, second only to the depths of the Library of Magehold. Being available to the public, the Catacombs often played host to many events and games by bored necromancers. Untold numbers of corpses in various states of decay were stored here and categorized according to how intact or preserved they were. Normally liches of the Salvific Ossuary would be attending to them, however...\n\n"I want all of you to prepare for a massive influx of new necromancers!" Corpus barked at the fancily-robed liches, "They are to be trained to raise and maintain at minimum four-hundred combat-ready undead each!"\n\nThe liches offered small bows, then one looked up. "But my lord, we are not teachers! Why not ask the instructors in the Animus Institute?"\n\n"I have other plans for them. You are Ascendants of the Salvific Ossuary, you know better than to question my orders. You shall instruct the next generation of necromancers for what is to come."\n\nAfter some hesitation, the liches bowed again. "Of... of course, my lord."\n\nIf Corpus noticed the hesitation, he didn't show it. "Good."\n\nBefore the concerned liches could ask further questions, Corpus turned to leave. This left them all very concerned. "We're preparing for war? Now?" murmured one as she looked between her colleagues. They all shrugged at her. It would seem that Corpus' orders had caught all of them by surprise."
dread_start.4.a:0 "Why are we mobilizing now of all times?"

dread_start.5.t:0 "Putting the Dead and Dying to Work"
dread_start.5.d:0 ""All right you rot, listen up!"\n\nThe glaze-eyed thralls and ghouls inside of the blacksmith's workshop halted their work, then turned to face the commanding voice. At the entrance to the workshop was a somewhat decayed pony who, despite not having lungs anymore, held a cigarette from a faraway land in his mouth. Something he seemed to treasure quite closely.\n\nFollowing his old smoking habits, the blacksmith tried to breathe in the fumes, only to remember that he could not do so anymore. He grumbled, then continued speaking, "Yous has been workin' hard, but we gots some new orders from above! The boneheads running the show want us to arm their ghoulies and skellies to the teeth! They promised me some right good bones for this, so here's what we need..."\n\nFrom swords, to spear tips, to basic armor for the mages, the blacksmith listed off all sorts of equipment to be made. The thralls and ghouls listened wordlessly to every item, and when the blacksmith finished, they obediently began crafting the requested equipment. The blacksmith grinned as he watched his workers do their jobs. Acquiring thralls from the House of Rubra and hoof-crafted ghouls from the Animus Institute was definitely the best decision he had ever made. This was far more satisfying than his old life, for sure. To top it off, he didn't even have to pay his workers!"
dread_start.5.a:0 "They don't complain about the long hours, either!"

#Fires on completion of DED_START_workshop_of_the_flesh_stitchers
dread_start.6.t:0 "The Surgeon"
dread_start.6.d:0 "The workshops of the Stitchers of Aeternum was a place that no sane creature would ever set hoof in. Profane defilements to the concept of life were on display in every hall, every wall, and some were even strung from the ceiling. The worst were those that thrashed about when anything got near them.\n\nSuch vile abominations were precisely the reason why Corpus Maledictus was now here. After some brief difficulty in finding the necromancer he was looking for, he came across an open door with crackling sounds and flashing lights coming from within. Approaching the door, Corpus peered inside to see a screaming, writhing mass of flesh and limbs struggling against the restraints holding it to an operating table. Beside it was a blood-soaked unicorn with ragged eyes and sunken cheeks. Said unicorn briefly glanced at his visitor, then beckoned Corpus over with the bonesaw in his hoof.\n\nThere were scarce few things that bothered the 700-year-old lich, but the monster in front of him was unnerving, even for him. Nevertheless, he skipped the pleasantries. "I require your services, Magnus Medicus."\n\n"To use my full title means that this must be rather important," The unicorn set down his bonesaw and leaned against the table, "What ever can I do for you, Maledictus?"\n\n"There is going to be war with the Arcturians. I need an army of these... things."\n\nAn eerie, unnatural smile formed on the unicorn. "Of course. Any opportunity to test out my creations is a welcome one. I will need time to make more, however."\n\nCorpus eyed the creature on the table. It seemed like it once was an ordinary pony, but now with several extra limbs in unnatural locations, along with sharpened bone fragments jutting out of it. It reeked of repeated necromantic magicks. Evidently it had died several times during surgery, only to be brought back again and again. He saw an eye open and stare at him. It looked like it was... pleading?\n\nThe lich tried to ignore the possibility that this abomination might still be conscious. "I want these to be the first things that the Arcturians see when we meet them in battle.""

There are ways around it."\n\nA small group of mages, mostly necromancers, sat around a circular table inside of the Animus Institute's primary study room. Naught but books and the occasional cleaning ghoul were around them, granting them a rare opportunity to speak freely without potential eavesdroppers.\n\n"What I'm saying," continued the young, mortal mare, "is that we're not the only ones unhappy with the way Corpus is running things."\n\nThe sole vampire of the group chuckled and shook his head, "Come on, Wilt. I find it hard to believe that this was more than just an isolated prank. What you're suggesting is that-"\n\n"If they can kill Corpus once then they can do it again!" The mortal mare put her hoof on the table, meeting the gaze of everyone at the table. "And maybe they'll find his phylactery too, and that'll be the end of him. For good."\n\nThere was a brief silence, then a sigh. One mage, a recently ascended lich, stood from the table. "Look, I don't like Corpus as much as anyone. But he's not stupid, he keeps his phylactery hidden like everyone else. I doubt that anyone will ever find it."\n\nThe vampire grinned, "Yeah?

dread_start.1001.t:0 "Problems and Solutions"
dread_start.1001.d:0 ""Where is she..." Corpus muttered. He never liked waiting, but this was ridiculous. He had summoned some trusted aids from the Salvific Ossuary and went to one of Lady Rubra's extravagently decorated manors with the intent to speak with her, but it had been nearly ten minutes without a sign of the infamous Crimson Mare. So now he stood in the finely crafted foyer with his entourage.\n\nEventually a scrawny, well-dressed mortal with glazed eyes appeared from one of the many doors. "I'm very sorry my lord, but I regret to inform you that Her Ladyship is not home at present, and is currently away on vacation in the region of Aquileia-"\n\nCorpus gritted his teeth. "This is ridiculous. Why does she not inform me of her comings and goings? As a member of the Dread Council she should know better than to waste my time." As he finished speaking, the thought occurred to him that she might have left him in the dark on purpose out of disrespect. This only irritated him further.\n\nHe suddenly turned to leave the manor, leaving his accomplices surprised and scurrying to catch up with him. As they regained pace with him, Corpus began to rant, "This is unacceptable! Traitors trying to murder me, disrespect at every opportunity, leaving me uninformed on crucial matters, and worst of all, they do it behind my back!"\n\nOne of the liches accompanying Corpus attempted to calm him. "With all due respect, perhaps the great Count Dominus could aid you in this matter? His web of knowledge stretches far, and he has never failed you."\n\n"That's... not a terrible idea," Corpus paused to consider the suggestion. The Opulent Lord of Secrets might be able to help him root out the traitors responsible for undermining his authority. It was likely his best option now. "Send word to the good Count that I am summoning him for an audience."\n\n"Consider it done." The lich nodded and bowed, then quickly departed."

dread_start.11.d:0 ""My lord, Count Dominus has arrived."\n\nCorpus nodded, then signaled to his undead servants to let him in. The grand doors to the throne room were pulled open by two teams of skeletons, and in walked a finely robed vampire with a demeanour to match. He sauntered with such precision that all but the most astute observers would believe him to be floating across the ground.\n\nThe vampire stopped when he was but a few paces before Corpus. With a humble bow, he spoke, "To what do I owe the pleasure, O king?"\n\nCorpus allowed himself a smirk. At least the good Count still treated him with the respect he deserved. "I require an update on your infiltration of the Arcturian Knights."\n\n"They have their claws and hooves full dealing with my children and their spawn," Dominus rose to meet Corpus' gaze, "I have eyes and ears nearly everywhere in their land." The vampire then glanced around at the servants present in the throne room. The barest hint of annoyance crossed his face before dissipating. "Though I am still working on securing a spy in their strongholds."\n\nAt least something is going well, Corpus thought. "I need you to make preparations to strike them soon. Eliminate their precious headmaster and his cohorts before he leads them into battle."\n\nDominus' expression was impenetrable. "This will be a very costly manuever. Are you sure you want me to do this?"\n\n"Burn any assets you have to do it. I don't care how much it takes, I want him dead! I will be known as the one who struck down the knight who slew Luvenis!"\n\nThe vampire lord briefly closed his eyes. "It will be done, O king. Will there be anything else?"\n\n"As a matter of fact, yes," Corpus brought a hoof to his chin in thought, "Investigate the matter of the attempt on my unlife. I want the traitor responsible found and brought before me!"\n\nDominus bowed once more, hiding a smile, "With respect, I am already investigating this matter. I will know who murdered you before long.""

dread_start.12.t:0 "Strike at the Heart"
dread_start.12.d:0 "Within an inconspicuous manor on the outskirts of Magehold was a certain chamber. A chamber that held enough information on everyone in Magehold to bring the city tumbling down. On top of that, it contained various maps of the Arcturian territories as well as those beyond. On those maps were multiple markings indicating vampire cells and their positions. There were several scattered around the Tarpian Rock, with the occasional cell positioned in the tribal villages of Farbrook and the Watertowns.\n\nStaring at one map was a single individual: the self-proclaimed Lord of Secrets. Count Dominus was pondering whether or not it was worth it to obey Corpus' order. The fool had demanded something truly asinine; that Dominus sacrifice nearly every single one of his spies to take out as much of the Arcturians' leadership structure as possible. \n\nDominus frowned. This would set him back at least a century. Maybe two. Good infiltrators were hard to mold, especially ones as skilled as his.\n\nHis eyes drifted towards the east section of one map. On it was a mysterious island with a big question mark on it. It made his blood boil knowing that he would have to wait even longer to make another attempt to infiltrate that blasted island with its cursed shapeshifters. Every single vampire he had sent to it never reported back...\n\nDominus averted his gaze. He would establish a cell there eventually. For now, he plucked some pins from the map and moved them all into a circle around the primary fortresses of the Arcturians. He knew that the act he was about to perform would only serve to infuriate and embolden the knights, but perhaps there was a small chance that he could remove enough of them that Corpus could be replaced with a competent leader before the knights could reorganize themselves and attack.\n\nHe smiled as a thought passed his mind. It was ironic; he had engineered a successful assassination on Corpus Maledictus, and now he was about to do the same to the infamous Torygg of the Arcturian Order. The only difference here was that the aging mortal wouldn't get back up."

DED_deccat_faction_system_desc:0 "#TODO The Dread League was founded upon the alliance of the Salvific Ossuary and Ouroboroses some thousand years ago to defend themselves from the Arcturian Order. Since then, the balance of power has changed immensely within the League. From the rise of House Rubra, causing a split within the vampires, to the rise of the Magisterium, Institute and Stitchers, going through the mysterious rise to prominence of Count Dominus.\n\nFor you, all it matters is who works for you, and who works against you.\n"

These bodies may be used in various ways, but will need to be raised as undeads first.\n\nAn important truth that need to be understood with undeads is that they don't both function similarly to living ponies, while not doing so as well. They're tool. Tools break when used, or sometimes just cease functionning for unexpectable reasons. This creates a natural attrition of our undead population, a 'death rate' per say. This effectively means we'll constantly freshly raised undeads to fill our needs, and also means that one necromancer as an effective cap on how many undeads he has raised that stay as such at the same time."

DED_corpus_maledictus_name_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 313 ALB, Somewhere in the Dread Peninsula\n\n§YAscended:§! 349 ALB\n\n§YCoronated:§! 996 ALB\n\n§YBiography:§! Known for his extensive narcissism, Corpus would have been just another lich if he had not possessed enough magical talent to overpower anyone who challenged him. Within his first few years of unlife, he had already proven himself to be more adept at necromancy than the vast majority of his peers. His skills attracted the attention of the Salvific Ossuary, which quickly inducted Corpus into their order.\n\nIn the centuries that followed, Corpus steadily rose through the ranks of the cult. This drew the ire of his fellow cultists, who knew that he obtained his positions not through religious zealotry, but through his natural talents. Perhaps the greatest heresy in their eyes was when Corpus became the High Priest in 941. Corpus didn't care about their religion in the slightest, but he couldn't resist the power that came with the position, for it earned him a seat on the Dread Council.\n\nSince then, he had neglected to do anything of substance for the religion he was in charge of, instead using and abusing his power to secure his position above all else. In 996, resentment within the cult's ranks had nearly reached a boiling point when their greatest wish came true: Corpus renounced his position as High Priest. He had taken a greater seat of power, one that previously belonged to the late Luvenis Maledicta, who had suffered her final death in her ill-fated conquest against the Arcturians.\n\nThus began the reign of the newest Dread King, Corpus Maledictus. A selfish lich who only takes action when it benefits him, and few are powerful enough to stand in his way.\n\n§YPortrait By:§! Neither"

DED_skellinore_name_desc:0 "§YSummoned§!: 19th of October 992, in Neyhorn\n\n§YRank§!: Militia Leader\n\n§YBiography§!: Skellinore's post-death existence, in many ways, is an accident on the part of an Animus necromancer, Obit Animata, who sought to raise a mighty warrior to lead his army. Skellinore is not and never has been a warrior in her past life, and when the truth came out, her summoner was very displeased. Had any other necromancer done the deed, they would have cut the tendrils of unlife on a seemingly useless being.\n\nObit Animata, however, deemed the ritual of raising an intelligent undead too much of an investment to rid himself of Skellinore. He instead drafted the former scholar as a leader of his militia, despite Skellinore's reluctance and ineptitude.\n\nWith the threat of oblivion should she disappoint her new master, Skellinore had no choice but to take the helm as Obit Animata's militia leader. Though she had many difficulties, Skellinore has grown into her new position. In time, she has developed the logistical and experience needed to lead Obit Animata's hosts with a degree of competency that has yet to upset him.\n\nThis was not a path that Skellinore had ever considered in her previous life or this unlife. However, it is one that she can perhaps excel at despite all of the odds stacked against her. Maybe one day, she may even break free of her unlife of indentured servitude.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"

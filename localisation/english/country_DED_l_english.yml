#Fires during DED_START_inspection_of_the_horde
dread_start.1.t:0 "Inspection of the Horde"
dread_start.1.d:0 "It was supposed to be an ordinary inspection. One of the many duties of the Dread King was to ensure that the undead armies of the League were ready for battle at any time. Normally a few liches would meet with Corpus Maledictus to accompany him throughout the inspection, yet when he arrived at the entrance to the Catacombs, there was nobody there to meet him.\n\nHe had gone in anyways, marching straight past the animated skeletons guarding the entrance. Soon after, he found the liches he had been looking for: a pair of bishops from the Circle of the Salvific Ossuary. They were speaking with a fancifully dressed vampire from House Rubra, whose expression was inscrutable as she noticed Corpus approaching.\n\nAfter exchanging some heated words and unpleasantries, the vampire left, leaving Corpus with the two bishops. The atmosphere remained tense as the inspection began, for Corpus suspected that his accomplices had purposefully disregarded protocol out of disrespect, or perhaps even-\n\nA sudden explosion rocked the hall, causing Corpus to lose his purchase on the cold, stone flooring. His horn ignited, and the glimmerings of a magical barrier began to form around him. Unfortunately for the old lich, the ceiling collapsed before he could fully form the shield. He was crushed by the rubble, and his long-dead body ceased its movements once and for all."

dread_start.101.t:0 "What Is Dead May Never Die" #I lived, b*tch
dread_start.101.d:0 ""And the old fool got flattened! It was a sight to see!" Bishop Pravus laughed heartily, retelling the tale of Corpus' demise to a group of acolytes within his church. "And yet... it is hard to believe that it has been a few days since then. Feels like it occurred just a moment ago."\n\nThe acolytes, all mortals, seemed mesmerized by the bishop's tale. One, however, raised his hoof, "Bishop Pravus, what of Corpus' phylactery? Surely it would have revived him."\n\nThe bishop nodded towards the inquisitive pony. "Normally yes, though Corpus was always known to carry his phylactery on himself. He was quite paranoid that it would be stolen, and so he never hid it out of fear of-"\n\n"Fear of what, my good bishop?"\n\nAll heads turned to see a severely-pissed off walking corpse. Despite its heavily rotted and misshapen form, it was easily distinguishable as the one and only Corpus Maledictus.\n\nThe skeletal bishop flinched, taking a few steps back, "I... why it is good to see you again, Corpus! The entire council believed you to have perished and they were about to begin the process of-"\n\n"Need I remind you that I am a Lich, you conniving worm." Corpus approached the bishop and gently put a hoof onto his back, taking care not to trigger the Magisterium's favourite spell. "I don't know who tried to end me. But I will find out. And when I do, I will feed them and their phylactery to the Stitchers' monstrosities. Is that clear?" Corpus got only a short nod from the bishop."
dread_start.101.a:0 ""Good. Now kindly stop lying to your flock about my assumed death.""

dread_start.2.t:0 "Ruminations"
dread_start.2.d:0 "The candlelight was dim, casting little more than the faintest glow upon the parchment in front of Corpus. He was alone inside of his personal chambers, analyzing a report discreetly delivered to him by his most trusted informant, Count Dominus. The report indicated that the Arcturians were beginning to get rather serious about their militarization. To make matters worse, they were also working day and night to create advanced weapons that could destroy an undead so utterly that they could not be revived again.\n\nCorpus grimaced. This was not good, not good at all. His undead hordes were great in number, but slow and limited to simply throwing themselves and loose objects at their enemies. If the details in this report were true...\n\nHe paused to retrieve his phylactery from an enchanted strongbox hidden within the wall. Corpus gazed into the shaped onyx that guaranteed him immortality. An attempt on his life had left him shaken, and it was only because of this jewel that he had survived. He clutched it tightly as he felt a chill enter the room. If his assailants wanted him dead so badly, then they would surely try to steal away his phylactery. He couldn't afford to lose it. Perhaps... perhaps if he kept it with him from now on. They wouldn't dare strike his body down again, would they? Surely not... especially after it was made clear that he didn't keep his phylactery on him.\n\nThe ancient lich returned to his desk. His eyes fell upon a line near the bottom of the report. An addendum by Dominus. The vampire lord was suggesting that should the League not take this threat seriously, then the knights might very well be able to march all the way to Magehold with relative ease.\n\nCorpus needed to act. Yet enemies from within would attempt to destroy him even though it would spell their doom. How dare they! Corpus ignited his horn and incinerated the report. He was more powerful than the traitors working in the shadows! More powerful than all other necromancers, even the late Luvenis! Even the esteemed Vetus! He channeled his anger and threw his head down, whispering a prayer to Mordator. Corpus owed the dark god nothing, but He always listened to those who dared to utter His Name. The lich finished his prayer and stormed out of his quarters to make preparations for the coming war."
dread_start.2.a:0 "In the frozen darkness, a prayer was heard."

#Fires on completion of DED_START_boons_of_the_library ## This one describes the return of the latest expedition in the depths of the Library. Probably could have Rosa and Vetus appear in this one. Especially if we mention the specific book Rosa gets ... didn't you already write this one from the previous design? I have no idea, maybe I'm the one with brainrot ...
dread_start.3.t:0 "The Latest Expedition"
dread_start.3.d:0 "Among the Library of Magehold's myriad of oddities, its non-euclidean, ever-changing layout was perhaps its most interesting feature. Every so often, official expeditions would be organized by the Magisterium to search for new secrets and wonders to extract from the seemingly limitless wealth of magical knowledge held beneath their hooves.\n\nAt the main entrance of the Library sat an ancient lich by the name of Vetus Maledictus. Being the original Librarian of this place, he had visited the depths of that labyrinth on countless occasions, though he seldom went in anymore due to his declining mental health. Nowadays he spent his time looking through and cataloguing the new findings by more adventurous mages.\n\nAs the latest group to exit the Library passed off some spellbooks and artifacts to Vetus, he reflected on his last journey down there. Eighty years ago, was it? And he'd gotten lost for so long that the search party numbered in the thousands! They had even ended up finding him in the-\n\n"Excuse me, Vetus? Did they find it?"\n\nVetus tried to collect himself. Where was he? Ah yes, the entrance. And this unicorn before him... Right! A student of the Animus Institute! And a talented one at that! He attempted a smile, though the muscle tissue in his face had long since rotted away.\n\nThe unicorn shuffled in place, seemingly unsure of whether or not he heard her. "Um, Vetus? Everything okay? I was really hoping that they found some information on 'Organic-Inscription Matrices' like I had requested."\n\nThe old lich was unresponsive for a moment. The unicorn was about to gently shake him, but his hoof suddenly rose, "Yes, actually. Right here." Vetus picked up one of the many tomes retrieved by the expedition and levitated it over to the unicorn before him.\n\nA wide smile spread across her face as she accepted the tome, "Oh, thank you so much! You have no idea how important this is to my research!" \n\nVetus stared at her as she began to leave. Such a nice young mare, she was. She trotted away with a spring in her step unique to few ponies in this forsaken corner of the world."

There are ways around it."\n\nA small group of mages, mostly necromancers, sat around a circular table inside of the Animus Institute's primary study room. Naught but books and the occasional cleaning ghoul were around them, granting them a rare opportunity to speak freely without potential eavesdroppers.\n\n"What I'm saying," continued the young, mortal mare, "is that we're not the only ones unhappy with the way Corpus is running things."\n\nThe sole vampire of the group chuckled and shook his head, "Come on, Wilt. I find it hard to believe that this was more than just an isolated prank. What you're suggesting is-"\n\n"If they can kill Corpus once then they can do it again!" The mortal mare put her hoof on the table, glancing at everyone at the table. "And maybe they'll find his phylactery too, and that'll be the end of him. For good."\n\nThere was a brief silence, then a sigh. One mage, a recently ascended lich, stood from the table. "Look, I don't like Corpus as much as anyone. But he's not stupid, he keeps his phylactery hidden like everyone else. I doubt that anyone will ever find it."\n\nThe vampire grinned, "Yeah?

These bodies may be used in various ways, but will need to be raised as undeads first.\n\nAn important truth that need to be understood with undeads is that they don't both function similarly to living ponies, while not doing so as well. They're tool. Tools break when used, or sometimes just cease functionning for unexpectable reasons. This creates a natural attrition of our undead population, a 'death rate' per say. This effectively means we'll constantly freshly raised undeads to fill our needs, and also means that one necromancer as an effective cap on how many undeads he has raised that stay as such at the same time."

DED_corpus_maledictus_name_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 313 ALB, Somewhere in the Dread Peninsula\n\n§YAscended:§! 349 ALB\n\n§YCoronated:§! 996 ALB\n\n§YBiography:§! Known for his extensive narcissism, Corpus would have been just another lich if he had not possessed enough magical talent to overpower anyone who challenged him. Within his first few years of unlife, he had already proven himself to be more adept at necromancy than the vast majority of his peers. His skills attracted the attention of the Salvific Ossuary, which quickly inducted Corpus into their order.\n\nIn the centuries that followed, Corpus steadily rose through the ranks of the cult. This drew the ire of his fellow cultists, who knew that he obtained his positions not through religious zealotry, but through his natural talents. Perhaps the greatest heresy in their eyes was when Corpus became the High Priest in 941. Corpus didn't care about their religion in the slightest, but he couldn't resist the power that came with the position, for it earned him a seat on the Dread Council.\n\nSince then, he had neglected to do anything of substance for the religion he was in charge of, instead using and abusing his power to secure his position above all else. In 996, resentment within the cult's ranks had nearly reached a boiling point when their greatest wish came true: Corpus renounced his position as High Priest. He had taken a greater seat of power, one that previously belonged to the late Luvenis Maledicta, who had suffered her final death in her ill-fated conquest against the Arcturians.\n\nThus began the reign of the newest Dread King, Corpus Maledictus. A selfish lich who only takes action when it benefits him, and few are powerful enough to stand in his way.\n\n§YPortrait By:§! Neither"

Skellinore is not and never has been a warrior in her past life, and when the truth came out, her summoner was very displeased. Had any other necromancer done the deed, they would have cut the tendrils of unlife on a seemingly useless being.\n\nObit Animata, however, deemed the ritual of raising an intelligent undead too much of an investment to rid himself of Skellinore. He instead drafted the former scholar as a leader of his militia, despite Skellinore's reluctance and ineptitude.\n\nWith the threat of oblivion should she disappoint her new master, Skellinore had no choice but to take the helm as Obit Animata's militia leader. Though she had many difficulties, Skellinore has grown into her new position. In time, she has developed the logistical and experience needed to lead Obit Animata's hosts with a degree of competency that has yet to upset him.\n\nThis was not a path that Skellinore had ever considered in her previous life or this unlife. However, it is one that she can perhaps excel at despite all of the odds stacked against her. Maybe one day, she may even break free of her unlife of indentured servitude.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"

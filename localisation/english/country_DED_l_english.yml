dread_start.101.d:0 "The long night had reached its peak when The First arrived. "The Famine is nearly upon us. Yet you still wait. Do you not understand the severity of inaction?"\n\nThe Architect preceded many, but was still bound by familial bonds to answer The First's call. "I do. Patience will be rewarded with a Feast, my beloved."\n\nThe First scoffed at this. "Patience will only get us so far. Already many of the Lesser have succumbed, yet the Famine itself hasn't even arrived. The plan must be set in motion. Now."\n\n"Just a little while longer," reassured the Architect, "I have been grooming the Heir for most of its life. It will be the perfect Vessel to bring about the Feast. All that remains is for the Fool to be removed, and for the Heir to take its place."\n\n"Do not presume that you can put off my demands until later. Yet I see this plan of yours is not without merit. You have until the Heir's mortal coil is extinguished. If your plan is not enacted by that point, then I shall see that you suffer the same fate the Lesser."\n\nThe First departed, leaving the Architect alone to watch over the night once more.

dread_start.20.t:0 "The Latest Expedition"
dread_start.20.d:0 "Among the Library of Magehold's myriad of oddities, its non-euclidean, ever-changing layout was perhaps its most interesting feature. Every so often, official expeditions would be organized by the Magisterium to search for new secrets and wonders to extract from the seemingly limitless wealth of magical knowledge held beneath their hooves.\n\nAt the main entrance of the Library sat an ancient lich by the name of Vetus Maledictus. Being the original Librarian of this place, he had visited the depths of that labyrinth on countless occasions, though he seldom went in anymore due to his declining mental health. Nowadays he spent his time looking through and cataloguing the new findings by more adventurous mages.\n\nAs the latest group to exit the Library passed off some spellbooks and artifacts to Vetus, he reflected on his last journey down there. Eighty years ago, was it? And he'd gotten lost for so long that the search party numbered in the thousands! They had even ended up finding him in the-\n\n"Excuse me, Vetus? Did they find it?"\n\nVetus tried to collect himself. Where was he? Ah yes, the entrance. And this unicorn before him... Right! A student of the Animus Institute! And a talented one at that! He attempted a smile, though the muscle tissue in his face had long since rotted away.\n\nThe unicorn shuffled in place, seemingly unsure of whether or not he heard her. "Um, Vetus? Everything okay? I was really hoping that they found some information on 'Organic-Inscription Matrices' like I had requested."\n\nThe old lich was unresponsive for a moment. The unicorn was about to gently shake him, but his hoof suddenly rose, "Yes, actually. Right here." Vetus picked up one of the many tomes retrieved by the expedition and levitated it over to the unicorn before him.\n\nA wide smile spread across her face as she accepted the tome, "Oh, thank you so much! You have no idea how important this is to my research!" \n\nVetus stared at her as she began to leave. Such a nice young mare, she was. She trotted away with a spring in her step unique to few ponies in this forsaken corner of the world."

dread_start.140.t:0 "The Immortal Games"
dread_start.140.d:0 "Magehold had not seen this many beings gathered for hundreds of years. The Immortal Games were not something that occurred every day, after all, though Corpus had garnered a rather unpopular reputation in recent years. As the contenders signed up by the thousands, many of them extremely talented in their fields, it quickly became apparent that a fan favorite, the Voice of Mordator, would not be the sure successor to Corpus Maledictus.\n\nConceived in 213 after Carnes Maledictus' untimely demise had caused a succession crisis, a civil war, and a significant loss of territory to the Arcturians, the Immortal Games serve as the official method for succeeding or challenging the previous Dread Lord for the throne. It also had the side effect of drastically reducing the number of coup attempts and efforts to incite civil wars, as most immortal beings preferred to stay immortal.\n\nUnlike most tournaments, contestants in the Immortal Games are not required to directly participate. Instead, they can choose or create a single champion who will fight in their stead. For necromancers, this meant that they usually raised their finest undead. Vampires often selected their strongest thrall. The foolish often signed themselves up with no champion at all.\n\nThough there are no rules against enchanting or otherwise altering your champion prior to the start of each round, once a round has begun the only thing that you can do is issue orders to them. On this occasion, necromancers and vampires alike began to do everything they could to increase the likelihood of their champion coming out on top, from protective spells to empowering thralls with vampiric blood.\n\nThere would be four rounds to thin the vast number of aspirants this time. In the end, the sole winner of the Immortal Games would face off against Corpus Maledictus himself. Should they succeed, a new monarch would take their rightful place upon the throne.\n\nThe bell tolled, signifying that the first round of the 36th Immortal Games was starting."
dread_start.140.a:0 "Let the Games begin."

dread_start.1401.t:0 "The Culling"
dread_start.1401.d:0 "The first round was a slaughter. A massive free-for-all that saw thousands of contenders reduced to just over two hundred in a matter of hours. Several of the remaining contenders looked at one another nervously, as they had already been forced to pull from every trick in their respective books just to remain in the Games.\n\nThough the second round was less chaotic, it was equally fierce, if not more so. Each contender was given a random target to eliminate and another to protect. The fights were brutal, as many were they were forced to cooperate or their mutual loss was assured. By the end of it, there were only one hundred and two remaining.\n\nThe third round was perhaps the bloodiest of them all. The contenders' champions underwent several increasingly dangerous tests of strength and fortitude, from resisting the blows of stolen weapons from Arcturian Magesmiths to surviving inside of a nullified room that sapped away all forms of magic. Many ghouls simply crumbled to dust, while several thralls either collapsed, or in some cases, exploded in gory viscera. At the end of this round, only sixteen contenders remained.\n\nAnd yet it was the fourth round where things began to get truly interesting, for not one, but two mortal necromancers had made it this far, a feat unheard of in over four hundred years."
dread_start.1401.a:0 "The Games continue..."

dread_start.1402.t:0 "Mortal Combat"
dread_start.1402.d:0 "The fourth round saw each of the remaining contenders preparing to face one another in successive one-on-one battles. Many made their preparations in secret, scraping at every bit of power and knowledge they had left in order to ensure that their champion was successful in the battles to come.\n\nAnd the battles did come. Some were cold, calculated executions, while others were ferocious, as some simply threw everything they had at one another. In a surprising turn of events, after all the dust had settled, the two mortal necromancers were the last ones standing.\n\nOne of these contenders was a young mare, a talented necromancer in the Animus Institute. She had prepared to show what she was capable of for quite a long time, though she could hardly have predicted that she would have to do it in such a violent matter. Intelligent ghouls were hard to raise, but hers was especially difficult to maintain due to its special nature.\n\nAs she was making some last-minute adjustments to the sapience spell matrix that powered her undead champion, she spotted something that shocked her: The opponent she had to face.\n\nOn the other side of the arena was the Voice of Mordator, the chosen contender of the Circle of the Salvific Ossuary. She knew that she might have to face them eventually, but what she did not expect was to be met with the face of an old friend: Silent Night, the same pony she had fled Equestria with all those years ago.\n\nHe was too far away for her to speak with, but she could tell that he was different, somehow. He was... darker? The influence of that blasted cult had gotten to him, she could tell. They had gone their separate ways after entering Magehold, so she supposed that she shouldn't have been that surprised at how different he was, but still... seeing her friend succumbing to the darkness of this land tore at her heart. Nevertheless, she had to push on. She couldn't allow him and by extension the CSO take the throne. It would mean the end of everything she'd worked for.\n\nThe bell tolled once more, signifying that the fight was to begin. The young mare loosed her creation into the arena, and..."
dread_start.1402.a:0 "...it adapted to the other champion's moves and crushed it!"

dread_start.1403.t:0 "The Penultimate Moment"
dread_start.1403.d:0 "The spectators roared at the upset. The Voice of Mordator defeated at the very end? And not by a lich or vampire, but by a fellow mortal mage? It was inconceivable. Many had bet large sums of bones on the Voice of Mordator claiming his destiny, but here he had been stopped by some researcher from the Institute!\n\nAnd yet it was clear what must happen next. The Dread Council stood from their seats and quieted the crowd. Among them, the representative from the Magisterium cast a spell that amplified their voice across the entire arena. "Congratulations Wilted Rose, you have won the 36th Immortal Games. As such, you have earned the right to challenge Corpus Maledictus for the throne. Do you wish to make this challenge?"\n\n"Yes!" The young mare tried to answer calmly, but her nerves betrayed her. Just one more. She was almost there. Just one more fight and then she could change the world.\n\n"Then prepare yourself, for the Dread Lord will soon meet you in battle."\n\nHer heart raced. She was about to fight the most ruthless and power-hungry lich in the Dread League. She would likely never have this opportunity again, at least not while she was alive. She looked at her creation, a semi-intelligent ghoul which she had spent months perfecting. It had received a few bruises during the previous fight, along with some of its bones showing signs of cracks. There wasn't much time, she needed to fix it up and make more adjustments, but she couldn't finish everything before the final battle began.\n\nShe grit her teeth and ignited her horn, deciding to go all-in on reinforcing its defining feature: the Sapience Spell Matrix."
dread_start.1403.a:0 "Hopefully she could outsmart Corpus..."

dread_start.1404.t:0 "The Showdown"
dread_start.1404.d:0 "The climactic fight began with all the fierceness that one would expect from the most powerful lich in the Dread League. Corpus Maledictus may have been old and decrepit, but his champion was his polar opposite. A tall, equine skeleton with broad bones that moved much more swiftly than any undead that Wilted had seen before. She didn't even have time to command her ghoul to move out of the way of the first blow, but fortunately her champion possessed enough intelligence to dodge the incoming strike of its own accord.\n\nThe two champions exchanged blows, with Corpus' horn glowing brightly as he micromanaged nearly every move that his puppet made. Wilted on the other hoof was quickly being backed into a corner as her ghoul was forced to make increasingly uneven trades against the elder lich's champion. She was faced with the nightmarish task of keeping up with the amount of control her opponent was exerting on removing her options.\n\nThings took a turn for the worse as Corpus' champion broke off a sharp bone fragment from itself and sliced off a limb from Wilted's ghoul. The crowd began chanting as Wilted's ghoul was now effectively crippled. Corpus purposefully slowed his puppet's movements, seemingly preparing for a stylistic execution.\n\nIt was then that Wilted's ghoul propelled itself at its opponent. Her heart skipped a beat, she didn't want it to do that! She was trying to buy time to think of a strategy! The unexpected move by the ghoul caught both Wilted and Corpus off guard. A glow emanated from the ghoul's horn as it tightly wrapped itself around the skeleton with its remaining limbs.\n\nCorpus' champion haphazardly sliced and tugged at the ghoul, attempting to dislodge it, but after a moment of struggling... his skeleton stopped responding to his commands. Wilted stared at her ghoul, mouth agape, as she realized what it had done: Her ghoul had cast a spell independent of her command. It had severed the connection between Corpus and his champion.\n\nWith relative ease, Wilted's ghoul dislodged itself from the inert skeleton and shoved it to the ground, shattering it into hundreds of pieces.\n\nThe crowd erupted into chaos."
dread_start.1404.a:0 "That... that can't be a legal move, can it?"

dread_start.1405.t:0 "The Dread King's Defiance"
dread_start.1405.d:0 "It was impossible, countless necromancers had said. A rudimentary ghoul casting a spell? Such a thing had never been done, not by any necromancer, not ever. The crowd was on the verge of rioting, with nearly everyone arguing about whether or not Wilted Rose had broke new ground in necromancy or somehow circumvented the rules to steal a win.\n\nDue to the rampant chaos that followed the upset, the Dread Council opted to convene at a separate, quieter location to discuss the ruling of the match. With Corpus and Wilted joining them, the council presented their ruling: "It was a valid tactic and a well-earned win."\n\nCorpus' decayed face immediately contorted into fury, "No, she CHEATED! Casting spells during the match is forbidden! It always has been!"\n\nSeveral members of the Dread Council smirked as they explained their verdict. "The rules state that the Contender cannot cast spells during a match. She did not cast the spell. Her champion did. You lost, Corpus."\n\nHe stomped his hoof. "No! I will not accept this, you vile traitors! She did not play by the rules, and I will not relinquish my authority to a scheming, pathetic mortal!"\n\n"Mortal or not, she will be the next Dread Queen. The rite dictates it so. Surrender your throne, or you will risk dooming this land to civil war."\n\n"I..." Corpus' eye twitched as he glanced between Wilted Rose and the Dread Council. A crazed look seem to overcome him. "...I don't have to abdicate if she isn't alive to steal it from me!"\n\nCorpus' horn began to burn brightly as he charged a magical blast. Wilted's ears drooped. She turned to run, but she couldn't escape before he fired the spell. The magical beam began closing in on her... and then she heard a terrible, gutteral scream from behind her. She stopped and turned back around. Where Corpus once stood was a pile of charred flesh and burned bones. She looked up at the Dread Council in confusion. One of them smiled at her.\n\n"The Magisterium does not permit unsanctioned violence within Magehold. Nobody is exempt from this, not even the great Corpus Maledictus.""
dread_start.1405.a:0 "What is dead can in fact truly die."

dread_start.1406.t:0 "The New Dread Queen"
dread_start.1406.d:0 ""Throughout the history of the Dread League, there have only ever been six individuals who held the title of Maledictus. The first was Vetus, our esteemed Librarian..."\n\nWilted Rose knelt before the throne as an Archbishop from the Circle of the Salvific Ossuary began the ceremony. Though externally she appeared calm and collected, she couldn't have felt more on edge if she tried. Everything had happened so fast! What was she even doing here?! She glanced towards the Dread Council to her right, who bore expressions ranging from apathy to extreme interest. She wasn't fully convinced that they actually wanted her to rule.\n\nShe pushed her thoughts aside as she tried to pay attention to the Archbishop's words. "...Now that Corpus has perished during the Rite of the Immortal Games, another has risen to claim the throne. Though her flesh persists and her mind is young, she has proven herself to possess the strength necessary to do what must be done! To destroy the weak and to hold great power over her enemies! It is not Corpus who will destroy the Order, it is this mortal mare with a sharp mind and an eternity to use it!"\n\nWilted furrowed her brow. That's not like her at all. She didn't want Corpus to die, she didn't want to rule or conquer anyone. She wanted to help everyone.\n\nAll the while the Archbishop continued, "And of course, a new queen needs a new name. Henceforth, she shall no longer be known as Wilted Rose within the halls of Magehold," He paused, then offered a crown to her, "now, recite the Oath."\n\nWilted Rose took a deep breath and grasped the crown with her telekinetic grip, "I have taken this curse upon myself by my own powers and, as such, with this crown I shall bear the name of Maledicta. Rosa Maledicta."\n\nAs the frigid crown touched her head, the Archbishop commanded her to rise. She looked around at the vast sea of evil as they began to celebrate. Her spine shivered as the skeletal Archbishop drew close to her ear, whispering, "May your reign be... prosperous."\n\nEven now, the Ossuary gave veiled threats to her. This land had truly collected the most vile, malevolent beings over the past millennia. Despite their boundless experience, she had one thing they didn't: a dream of a better world. The road ahead would be difficult, perhaps impossible, but she would prove to everyone that 'dark magic' wasn't so dark at all. Though lingering fears remained of her losing her way, much like her friends had."

Since then, the balance of power has changed immensely within the League. From the rise of House Rubra, causing a split within the vampires, to the rise of the Magisterium, Institute and Stitchers, going through the mysterious rise to prominence of Count Dominus.\n\nFor you, all it matters is who works for you, and who works against you.\n"

DED_corpus_maledictus_name_desc:0 "§YBorn:§! 313 ALB, Somewhere in the Dread Peninsula\n\n§YAscended:§! 349 ALB\n\n§YCoronated:§! 996 ALB\n\n§YBiography:§! Known for his extensive narcissism, Corpus would have been just another lich if he had not possessed enough magical talent to overpower anyone who challenged him. Within his first few years of unlife, he had already proven himself to be more adept at necromancy than the vast majority of his peers. His skills attracted the attention of the Salvific Ossuary, which quickly inducted Corpus into their order.\n\nIn the centuries that followed, Corpus steadily rose through the ranks of the cult. This drew the ire of his fellow cultists, who knew that he obtained his positions not through religious zealotry, but through his natural talents. Perhaps the greatest heresy in their eyes was when Corpus became the High Priest in 941. Corpus didn't care about their religion in the slightest, but he couldn't resist the power that came with the position, for it earned him a seat on the Dread Council.\n\nSince then, he had neglected to do anything of substance for the religion he was in charge of, instead using and abusing his power to secure his position above all else. In 996, resentment within the cult's ranks had nearly reached a boiling point when their greatest wish came true: Corpus renounced his position as High Priest. He had taken a greater seat of power, one that previously belonged to the late Luvenis Maledicta, who had suffered her final death in her ill-fated conquest against the Arcturians.\n\nThus began the reign of the newest Dread King, Corpus Maledictus. A selfish lich who only takes action when it benefits him, and few are powerful enough to stand in his way.\n\n§YPortrait By:§! Neither"

Skellinore is not and never has been a warrior in her past life, and when the truth came out, her summoner was very displeased. Had any other necromancer done the deed, they would have cut the tendrils of unlife on a seemingly useless being.\n\nObit Animata, however, deemed the ritual of raising an intelligent undead too much of an investment to rid himself of Skellinore. He instead drafted the former scholar as a leader of his militia, despite Skellinore's reluctance and ineptitude.\n\nWith the threat of oblivion should she disappoint her new master, Skellinore had no choice but to take the helm as Obit Animata's militia leader. Though she had many difficulties, Skellinore has grown into her new position. In time, she has developed the logistical and experience needed to lead Obit Animata's hosts with a degree of competency that has yet to upset him.\n\nThis was not a path that Skellinore had ever considered in her previous life or this unlife. However, it is one that she can perhaps excel at despite all of the odds stacked against her. Maybe one day, she may even break free of her unlife of indentured servitude.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Egil"

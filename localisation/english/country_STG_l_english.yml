# central branch #
STG_12th_year_of_revolution:0 "Twelfth Year Of The Revolution"
STG_12th_year_of_revolution_desc:0 "When the ponies of Severyana rose up against the exploitation back in 995, nopony had an exact idea how far we'd come. Since then, the revolution has not only endured, but prospered as well. For more than 12 years Stalliongrad stands as a beacon of hope, shining for all those wishing to escape unjust conditions imposed by capitalists or 'harmonic' autocrats. Our work is far from done, however."
STG_problems_in_party:0 "Factions In Our Ranks"
STG_problems_in_party_desc:0 "While most agree that having many opinions on building socialism has brought more benefits than drawbacks, there is plenty of disagreement on how we should proceed. The revolution has not solved every problem we faced before 995, and many of our current measures have been a temporary adjustment until the road can be paved for actual socialism."
STG_socialism_program:0 "The Socialist Program"
STG_socialism_program_desc:0 "rewrite the event following this focus"
STG_cominform:0 "Parties from Around the World"
STG_cominform_desc:0 "Communism is an international movement, and it seems our movement is finally catching on. We will begin sending out envoys to other Marksist, Marksist-Stallionist and Revolutionary Socialist parties to organise a conference to discuss and coordinate our efforts. Perhaps this could be the start of a true Communist International?"
STG_skynavia_kekw:0 "Visit to Skynavia"
STG_skynavia_kekw_desc:0 "The Skynavians may be unorthodox, and they may be tiny, but they are worth reaching out to. Who knows, perhaps they will have something interesting to say..."
STG_prywhen_why:0 "Assist Prywhen"
STG_prywhen_why_desc:0 "The Prywhenians have been fighting a protacted war for years against the tyrant King Kloseau, and while we know very little of what is going on there, we must send what aid we can to our comrades across the seas."
STG_Zebrica_4head:0 "The White Sun of Arabia"
STG_Zebrica_4head_desc:0 "Civil war has broken out in the once powerful state of Saddle Arabia. If the Arabian Popular Front can win, we will gain a powerful ally. We must send what aid we can to our comrades in Zebrica."
STG_only_thing_we_all_agree_on:0 "The Only Thing We All Agree On"
STG_only_thing_we_all_agree_on_desc:0 "The Only Thing We All Agree On"
STG_commission_of_inner_policy:0 "Inner Policy Commission"
STG_commission_of_inner_policy_desc:0 "The principle of democratic centralism has gone unenforced in practice for some time now. While we cannot yet put an end to factionalism, we can clarify some internal policies to make it very clear which issues have already been decided."
# right branch #
STG_peasants_and_workers:0 "The Peasants and the Workers"
STG_peasants_and_workers_desc:0 "Write about the necessity of the joint efforts of laborers in the city and in the countryside"
STG_peasants_and_workers_tt:0 "Unlocks unplanned profit decisions"
STG_petershoof_foreign_trade:0 "Open Petershoof for Foreign Trade"
STG_petershoof_foreign_trade_desc:0 "While the Equestrian blockade remains in place, our policy of Socialism in One Country has nonetheless born some fruit in that most other states no longer regard us as a pariah-state or dangerous zealots. Thus, we can now open the port of Petershoof to foreign trade, bringing in goods from Zebrica and Griffonia."
STG_amogus_trade:0 "Equestrian Shell Companies"
STG_amogus_trade_desc:0 "We maintain several shell companies and front operations within Equestria, working to siphon small funds back to Severyana and provide intelligence for our future operations. After years of buildup, we are ready to reap the benefits of these operations."
STG_telegraph_agency:0 "Stalliongrad Telegraph Agency"
STG_telegraph_agency_desc:0 "The party leadership certainly can't agree on everything, this is to be expected. But if the common pony were to know of our disunity, they could start losing hope in the socialist dream. Ensuring that the right information is transmitted to the public, assisted by the principle of democratic centralism, would ensure that the popular perception remains positive towards the state."
STG_state_warehouse_system:0 "State Reserve System"
STG_state_warehouse_system_desc:0 "Despite the current hardships, we must prepare for harder times still. The twin specters of war and hunger never sleep, and so we have organised a network of state-owned warehouses dotting the countryside, only to be opened when those specters again appear."
STG_support_the_colhoz:0 "Support Collective Farms"
STG_support_the_colhoz_desc:0 "Many great and wonderful things can be achieved through simple cooperation. One of the primary tenets of Marks discusses reorganisation of privately owned farmland into a joined block, that would be provided by the state with modern tools for increased output. The mainstream thought within the SCP believes it to be a solution against further famine."
STG_draka_s_kulakami:0 "Continue Wealth Redistribution"
STG_draka_s_kulakami_desc:0 "Although the industrial revolution brought substantial progress and quality of life for many ponies in Equestria, it also solidified one of the greatest evils in history: capitalistic exploitation. Factory owners would glut themselves with profit while paying a pittance! The party is committed towards eliminating this injustice."
STG_another_year_of_stability:0 "Another Year of Stability"
STG_another_year_of_stability_desk:0 "Despite the factionalism within our ranks, the people of Stalliongrad can see that progress is being made and that the SCP's rule has brought relative stability. Slowly but surely we are coming together, and that in itself is worth celebrating."
# left branch #
STG_about_freedom_and_unity:0 "Establish The Party Line"
STG_about_freedom_and_unity_desc:0 "An idea cannot be made into reality unless it has firm convinction behind it, and the easiest way to achieve that is by having ponies vouch in its favour. The SCP, nominally representing everycreature in Severyana, is showing signs of fracture as different party officials espouse their own plans for the future. Should this varied thinking be encouraged, or should we commit to a single goal?"
STG_doubters_on_left:0 "Should We Go Faster?"
STG_doubters_on_left_desc:0 "Masha, slow down a bit and work as everybody else"
STG_reliable_center:0 "Following Stallion's Way"
STG_reliable_center_desc:0 "Stallion told us what to do, he was smart and studied mommy Marks, mommy always knows best"
STG_send_in_sosister:0 "Renovate The Party Control Committee"
STG_send_in_sosister_desc:0 "time to re-register the party members, Sinister is a good boy, he can handle it"
STG_pessimists_on_right:0 "Remind about Deviations"
STG_pessimists_on_right_desc:0 "Stallion didn't tolerate deviations. Karamelka is a cool waifu, but Stallion opposed her views on our revolution, and DW basically wants to sell our independence to Celestia for vague plan of building socialism hoof-by-hoof with literally monarch"
STG_can_there_be_unity:0 "Can There be Unity?"
STG_can_there_be_unity_desc:0 "let's not forget that we shall prevail only if we are united, that's what Stallion has decreed"
# final focus of the starting tree #
STG_scp_congress:0 "Tenth Party Congress"
STG_scp_congress_desc:0 "The SCP will once more be meeting in its official capacity, to discuss important matters of state. Most are interested, however, whether Vasiliy Wheatin's ideas for Stalliongrad will convince the various opposing factions within the party to cooperate. The winds of change might change Severyana's course, or things could remain the same. The party will make its decision."


STG_socialism_in_one_country:0 "Socialism In One Country?"
STG_socialism_in_one_country_desc:0 "The chains must be broken, and any worker, be they pony, thestral, griffon or other deserves a decent life, their voice taken into account, to take pride in their fruits of labour. But how can Stalliongrad assist in spreading the socialist ethos abroad, if we cannot claim with certainty that the revolution is secure at home?"
STG_red_army_structure:0 "The Red Army Debate"
STG_red_army_structure_desc:0 "Our struggle for freedom was certainly bloody, but owing to the typical peaceful mindset, Stalliongrad has not faced a serious external threat since 995. But as the world situation further develops, the Red Army must be prepared to meet the challenge. For now, we must discuss and figure out its organisation and how to implement it in the near future."
STG_reminats_of_fleet:0 "Remnants Of The Royal Navy"
STG_reminats_of_fleet_desc:0 "The port of Petershoof was the location of the first uprising in 991, and it remained favourable to the ideas of revolution despite many suppressive crackdowns. As such, when the fighting continued in 995, many warships of the Equestrian Royal Navy were seized and turned against their uncaring masters. However, naval matters have rarely been given the time of the day, and we must modernise to keep up."
STG_reorganize_the_industry:0 "Industrial Buildup"
STG_reorganize_the_industry_desc:0 "Stalliongrad's stability comes from the workers, and it is our utmost duty to ensure all who have placed their hearts and minds towards a socialist future have the means of participating in it. However, resources are stretched thin and we cannot simply open a factory after factory, for obvious reasons. Several competing development plans have emerged in the SCP, and should be given a discussion."

STG_status_quo:0 "Status Quo In The Party"
STG_status_quo_desc:0 "The party has not reached agreement. The opposition has not been impressed with Vasiliy's speeches, and according to protocol, further debates will be held. We remain resolute that a consensus will be reached, for everypony holds a personal stake in Stalliongrad. It can and will be found."
STG_unity_in_party:0 "Unity Has Been Achieved"
STG_unity_in_party_desc:0 "Much to everypony's surprise, Comrade Vasiliy's proposals have each been met with the required majority needed for approval. He will certainly now rise to the position of General Secretary, and his ideas will guide and shape Stalliongrad for the time being. We all expect the glory of the revolution to remain unextinguishable, to spread wherever a worker remains oppressed and unfree."

STG_nothing_is_changed:0 "Nothing Has Changed"
STG_nothing_is_changed_desc:0 "Despite the best efforts of Vasiliy and his allies, the SCP is still a factionalized mess. This situation cannot go on forever, as while we bicker and argue our ponies lose confidence in us and our agricultural situation deteriorates."
STG_sysem_of_goszakaz:0 "Implement A System Of State Orders"
STG_sysem_of_goszakaz_desc:0 "The food and industrial situation is becoming too dire to let procedural correctness get in the way of a solution. Gensec Altidiya will implement a series of state orders, bypassing the Supreme Soviet and getting our economy back on track, or at least buying us a little more time."
STG_prodrazverstka:0 "Food Stocks Audit"
STG_prodrazverstka_desc:0 "We need to find out exactly how much time we have. We will send out auditors to the farms, collective and private, and to the village granaries to determine how close we are to disaster."
STG_countinue_kolhoz_support:0 "Provide Support for Collective Farms"
STG_countinue_kolhoz_support_desc:0 "All factions can agree that we need to subsidize the collective farms to secure our food supply. It is a stopgap situation, but for now it will help those in need."
STG_skaynavia_delegates:0 "Send Delegates to Skynavia"
STG_skaynavia_delegates_desc:0 "The Socialist Republic of Skynavia has finally overcome their own internal divisions, at least for the moment, and is beginning to secure their situation. We should contact these comrades across the sea, and set up trade relations with one of the few other countries in the world which share at least most of our ideals."
STG_atyldia_muhozhuk:0 "Suspicious Silence"
STG_atyldia_muhozhuk_desc:0 "General Secretary Altidiya Kobylkova has prepared a speech exhorting the SCP to find common ground. At the end of it, she will announce her plans to resign just before the next party congress, both for her health and because a GenSec election at the next congress may be the only way to shake the SCP out of its stalemate."
STG_save_revolution:0 "Save Our Revolution"
STG_save_revolution_desc:0 "The majority is either too unaware or too unwilling to stop the left faction's takeover. Our revolutionaries will storm the Supreme Soviet, dissolve Altidiya's weak government, and declare a national emergency. We will secure the revolution."
STG_fire_on_right:0 "Fire to the Right"
STG_fire_on_right_desc:0 "Dark Wing, Psychic Sigil, Karamelka Sladkaya, the whole rightist faction have done nothing but stall the revolution. With the true revolutionaries in control, we will round them all up to await their trials for betraying the revolution. Some will be released, some will be expelled, some will be imprisoned or shot, but for now they will be out of the way."
STG_sinnie_purge:0 "Serov's Purge"
STG_sinnie_purge_desc:0 "Sinister knows Vasiliy Wheatin better than anypony, and he knows that Vasiliy will not support a coup, no matter how righteous. For the time being, we will keep him and the other leaders of the Majority under house arrest, so that they cannot derail our course."
STG_sinnie_leatherman:0 "The Grey Cardinal"
STG_sinnie_leatherman_desc:0 "Masha Norushkina's provisional government cannot last forever. Fortunately, Sinister Serov is ready to lead the revolution. We will call an emergency party congress to appoint Sinister Serov as general secretary of Stalliongrad."
STG_time_for_breakthrough:0 "Time To Make a Breakthrough"
STG_time_for_breakthrough_desc:0 "The time of weakness and indecision is over. With our enemies absent and more and more of the majority coming over to our side, the Supreme Soviet has confirmed Sinister as our new leader. Now, the real revolutionary work begins."
STG_revolutionary_order:0 "Bring the Revolutionary Order"
STG_revolutionary_order_desc:0 "With the rightist faction out of the way, Masha and Sinister will approach Vasiliy Wheatin to legitimate their new program in an emergency session of the SCP congress. Surely, they will see our point of view."
STG_Vasya_unity:0 "Ending the Uncertainty"
STG_Vasya_unity_desc:0 "We have dealt with the ultra-left plot, and despite being shaken by his friend's betrayal Vasiliy Wheatin is ready to lead us forward, into a new era."
STG_time_to_offensive:0 "Time to Start the Offensive"
STG_time_to_offensive_desc:0 "The last few years have been a tumultuous time for our republic, but the SCP now stands united in purpose, galvanized by having almost lost it all. It is time to return to Steel Stallion's program, finish collectivization, and advance the cause of the worker's revolution."
STG_save_democracy:0 "Save Our Democracy"

# Industrial Branch
STG_plan_of_industrial_development:0 "Industrial Development Plan"
STG_plan_of_industrial_development_desc:0 "In preparation for the wars ahead, Stalliongrad must revolutionize its industry as never before. Only by working harder, longer, and smarter will we be able to compete with Equestria's industrial capacity."
STG_NEP_folding:0 "Scrap the NEP"
STG_NEP_folding_desc:0 "The small businessponies, proto-capitalists all, have had their fun. It is time we scrap the reactionary mistake that was the NEP, and send its beneficiaries them back into the proletariat where they belong."
STG_pcdi:0 "The People's Commissariat of Defence Industry"
STG_pcdi_desc:0 "The hybrid system of the NEP and endless compromises in the local Soviets meant an unnecessary number of planning committies, commissariats, and ministries. Too much red tape, exemplified by the eight separate offices handling war production. We will amalgamate what is necessary from these offices into the People's Commissariat of Defence Industry, and abolish the rest."
STG_massive_investments_in_magic_industry:0 "Kickstart Magical Industry"
STG_massive_investments_in_magic_industry_desc:0 "Bourgeois understandings of magic relegate it to a privileged class of trained unicorns, a remnant old aristocracies. A revolutionary theory of magic places it at the heart of the industrial process, practiced by the whole of the people and applied to every possible benefit to the worker's state. With industrial planning finally centralised, we can make the necessary investments to put this theory into practice."
STG_investments_in_crystal_mining:0 "Expand Crystal Mining"
STG_investments_in_crystal_mining:0 "Severyana is not like the Crystal Empire, where magical crystals can be collected right off the ground. Our crystals are fragile and deep underground, require careful and expensive mining operations to extract, but we will soon have great need of them."
STG_sinisters_design_bureau:0 "Expand Seroye Design Bureau"
STG_sinisters_design_bureau_desc:0 "Before the revolution, Sinister Serov was an amateur inventor with a particular interest in magical contraptions. His blueprints have since been refined by his old comrades at Seroye Design Bureau, scaling up from backyard experiments to a magical weapons testing facility. It's time to scale up again."
STG_first_profits_of_magic_industry:0 "Lay the Foundations"
STG_first_profits_of_magic_industry_desc:0 "The first magic-enhanced assembly lines are ready for activation. Telekinetic conveyor belts, crystalline conductors, exotic materials... the facilities are secret and experimental now, but as we roll this technology out to more and more factories our military production will soar."
STG_radio_for_everypony:0 "Expand the Radio Industry"
STG_radio_for_everypony_desc:0 "Magical production methods are particularly beneficial for the telecommunications industry, and have resulted in a surplus of radios. We will distribute these to our population, so that every single pony will have the voice of the revolution in their homes."
STG_second_profits_of_magic_energy:0 "Flip the Switch"
STG_second_profits_of_magic_energy_desc:0 "Our first forays into magical industry have been a huge success. It is time to roll out these technologies en masse to our military-industrial sector. Stalliongrad will crackle with the magic of industry!"
STG_massive_investments_after_grf:0 "Fine-Tune the Machine"
STG_massive_investments_after_grf_desc:0 "A factory is a machine of machines, an industry is a machine of factories. Just as the first line of automobiles rolled off the assembly lines gives a machinist data to fine-tune their machine, completing our first major war has given us the data we need to fine-tune our military-industrial complex as a whole."
STG_massive_investments_after_cry:0 "Open the Floodgates"
STG_massive_investments_after_cry_desc:0 "For all the benefits magical industry has brought us, we were always limited by the availability of magical crystals. With the Crystal Empire in our hooves, the possibilities are truly endless."


# Diplomacy Branch
STG_every_crisis_an_opportunity:0 "Every Crisis Is An Opportunity"
STG_every_crisis_an_opportunity_desc:0 "The war consuming Equus is the direct result of the contradictions of capitalism. Attacking Equestria during this crisis is not cowardly; it is our most sacred duty as revolutionaries."
STG_revolution_waits_for_nobody:0 "The Revolution Waits For Nopony!"
STG_revolution_waits_for_nobody_desc:0 "A true revolutionary does not wait for the workers to rise on their own: a true revolutionary strikes the moment they are able, to inspire the workers through their deeds and shake the foundations of capitalismwith their courage. To arms, soldiers! To arms, revolutionaries!"
STG_war_to_end_all_wars:0 "The War To End All Wars"
STG_war_to_end_all_wars_desc:0 "Capital is the root of all war. It demands war, both to profit from it and to destroy international solidarity. So this war is not only a war against Equestrian capitalism, it is a war against war itself! Our victory will herald a new age of peace, justice, equality and friendship among all workers."
STG_sicklestroke:0 "Operation Sicklestroke"
STG_sicklestroke_desc:0 "We will target the tendons and veins of the Equestrian war machine. Cut off their raw materials with naval strikes to New Mareland and Baltimare, striking where they thought they were safe, then watch the body wither and die."
STG_heart_thrust:0 "Operation Heartbreaker"
STG_heart_thrust_desc:0 "We will target the soft underbelly of the Equestrian war machine. By seizing their source of magical crystals, we'll be able to fuel a new generation of magical warfare and open up a vast northern front. The crystal ponies, newly suffering under the yoke of capitalism, will surely welcome us as liberators!"
STG_hammerblow:0 "Operation Hammerblow"
STG_hammerblow_desc:0 "We will strike the head of the Equestrian war machine. Smash through their border defences and charge down the east coast, seizing the largest industrial cities and threatening Canterlot itself, throwing their logistics and chain of command into disarray."
STG_rain_fire:0 "Rain Fire on Them"
STG_rain_fire_desc:0 "Every blow struck against Equestria's industry is a blow against capitalism. Every factory that goes up in flames is a beacon of hope to the workers. Let our bombers be the revolution's harbingers."
STG_provisional_governments:0 "Set Up Provisional Governments"
STG_provisional_governments_desc:0 "The first few months after a liberation are the most important. If we provide rations, law and order, and representation in the form of provisional Soviets in the major cities then the newly-liberated workers will become model revolutionaries. If not, they will fall to reactionary propaganda and see us as nothing but invaders."
STG_holding_the_line:0 "Holding the Line"
STG_holding_the_line_desc:0 "Now that we have made our move, Equestria prepares a counterattack. We will move in prefabricated pillboxes and millions of landmines to turn our new holdings into fortresses. Even obsolete tank turrets will be made into fortifications."
STG_by_other_means:0 "Politics By Other Means"
STG_by_other_means_desc:0 "Sinister Serov has no interest in playing queenmaker to any changeling tyrant, returned sorcerer-king, or other despot. Now that our primary war aim is achieved, we will make a truce with the Equestrians and focus on the continental threat. We know it won't last. They know it won't last. But the political situation may just force their hooves."

 STG_open_hoof_equestria_desc:0 "The separation from Equestria was bloody and traumatic for all parties involved, yet for that very reason it must be viewed soberly.

### EVENTS #####
stalliongrad_start.1.t:0 "Home of the Revolution"
stalliongrad_start.1.d:0 "The story of socialism in Severyana begins in 940s, when unicorn mare named Caramel Marks and her friend and colleague – Fire Angel, a griffon – decided to settle in the region after their long travel across Equestria, seeking to observe how the nation was changing in the wake of the industrial revolution. They saw the North-Eastern Autonomy – the official name of Severyana during Celestia's rule. This place turned out to be the one where the class contradictions were the strongest. It's here where they created the Union of Struggle for Justice.\n\nThey weren't able to see the fruits of their labor, however. Caramel Marks died in 954 ALB, and Fire Angel fled to Skyfall, where he promoted the ideas of Marksism to the broad griffon masses.\n\nBut they laid the seeds through their organisations and ideas, which would culminate in the alliance of Karamelka Sladkaya's "Workers' Association" and USJ, led by Steel Stallion. These two would break the stagnation and create the North-Eastern Labour Party, a precursor to the modern day Severyanian Communist Party. Thus the following events were inevitable: the Petershoof uprising, Pastilá Strike, declaration of the Republic of Severyana – the first nation to become independent from Equestria for centuries – followed by the Revolutionary War, when the first tanks were deployed in battle, and resulting in freedom and independence.\n\nWhat is left to be done? Shortly after the revolution, "Reorganization Period" was proclaimed by Stallion, aimed at gathering power and resources for the future socialist construction. But even after twelve years, the revolution has not yet entrenched itself in Severyana, largely known now as Stalliongrad. Ponies, thestrals, griffons and others live in much better conditions than they ever did under Celestia, but after the death of Steel Stallion, his party stands at the crossroads. Various socialist movements have sprung up beyond the borders of Severyana, and very few have achieved success compared to ours. If the workers are to be liberated, and petty bourgeoisie destroyed as a class, then we have much work ahead of us."
stalliongrad_start.1.a:0 "Long Live the Republic!"

stalliongrad_start.2.t:0 "A Party Divided"
stalliongrad_start.2.d:0 "Our great leader, the Founding Father of the Republic, has always taught the communists to stay strong and united. However, after Steel Stallion's death in 1003, the situation in the SCP has deteriorated.\n\nThe majority of the Party, led by prominent ponies, follows his line: reconstructing the economy, preparing to build socialism, helping the communists and the progressive forces abroad. Altydia "Alty Coggydeer" Revoltsova, Stallion's "left hoof", has managed to become the new General Secretary of the Party.\n\nNot all the comrades, however, agree with the line. Facing the current difficulties, they think a different line should be taken. The problems of trade, agriculture, and economic planning stil plague us; though we have had twelve years to muster it, the Red Army is still hardly a mighty force.\n\nWhile the majority of the party still believes in the program set out by Steel Stallion, the opposition factions have pointed to our failures to solve the problems brought on by the December Revolution as evidence that a major change of course is needed. They seem to become more and more popular both among some workers who have lost the optimism of the early days and among young socialists full of starry-eyed idealism and yearning to recapture the true spirit of revolution.\n\nWith factionalism, clashing egos, infighting and bureaucracy stymieing efforts at implementing long-term solutions, party unity has become the number one issue. For without unity, none of the other problems can be solved, and the revolution will never be able to move forward."
stalliongrad_start.2.a:0 "We shall not disgrace the Stallion's banner!"

stalliongrad_start.3.t:0 "Announcing the 10th Party Congress"
stalliongrad_start.3.d:0 "On the right, Caramelka takes every opportunity to point out the flaws in Stalliongrad’s governance. On the far left, extremists wish to take our young nation even further through brutal and uncompromising means. Vasiliy calls for the party to gather and address the growing problems plaguing the state. Optimistic followers of Stallion believe that Vasiliy and Altidiya will unite the party and prove the efficacy of Stalliongrad’s communist theory. Meanwhile, fringe groups hold their breaths, awaiting ineffective reform from the center-left."
stalliongrad_start.3.a:0 "Hurrah"

stalliongrad_start.4.t:0 "Majority"
stalliongrad_start.4.d:0 "The Majority is not officially a faction, but in the leadup to the Tenth Party Congress they have become tired of the infighting and are ready to move forward, rallying around a troika of prominent figures to bring unity to the party.\n\nPremier Vasiliy is the leader, and many hope that he will one day become General Secretary. Long thought of as a policymaker above factional conflict, he has come out strongly against disunity and revisionism in the party, arguing that the SCP must remember its purpose and serve the people and the revolution rather than their private interests. He has announced that he will propose an ambitious program of unity and anti-corruption measures at the next Congress.\n\nThe second figure is Gold Muffin, the Changeling revolutionary. After becoming a voice for calm and reconciliation within the SCP, Muffin was appointed to the post of Chaircreature of the Supreme Soviet. In this role, he has worked to moderate debates between the factions and encourage unity around the General Secretary. He is also a close personal friend of Vasiliy, and believes that his rise to power will be the best result for all creatures of Severyana.\n\nThe final figure is the most controversial: the firebrand, Sinister Serov. A dangerous pony, many blame him stoking factionalism within the Party, in addition to flirting with the ultra-left opposition in the past. However, it seems his deep friendship with Vasiliy has caused him to throw his support behind Vasiliy's program, at least for now, and his charismatic appeals have swayed many on-the-fence party members. Only time will tell if this coalition will last."
stalliongrad_start.4.a:0 "Let us hope Vasiliy succeeds..."

stalliongrad_start.5.t:0 "The Opposition. Left Wing"
stalliongrad_start.5.d:0 "Passionate, militaristic, and controversial, Masha unites the ultra-left through her devotion to an eternal revolution. Despite her tough early years, her dedication and extremism are often only seen in the young. Her undying loyalty to communism makes her, and her followers incorruptible, but her proposed methods are brutal. She refuses to tolerate or consider the ideas and practices of capitalists and far-right ideologies and insists that the oppressors must be punished without mercy. Naturally, she despises Karamelka and views her as a corrupt bureaucrat. The young Masha is useful to the party as long as they give her proper guidance. However, if she is given more independence, the militant ultra-left may become a threat to Stalliongrad’s stability."
stalliongrad_start.5.a:0 "Great"

stalliongrad_start.6.t:0 "The Opposition. Right Wing" #why does this mention Masha? 
stalliongrad_start.6.d:0 "Since Steel Stallion's death, opposition factions have formed. They vote together, consistently support each other, and frequently reopen debates which were previously closed, skirting the principle of democratic centralism and aggravating the party's indecisiveness. The main opposition factions are the rightists and the ultra-leftists. While they both agree on preserving their ability to oppose the majority and frequently vote together on administrative and procedural issues, they could not be more different in terms of their ultimate aims.\n\nThe rightists, led by the universally-respected Karamelka and the universally-despised Dark Wing, advocate consolidating the NEP and an approach of "new thinking" and "openness," whereby they would reintroduce some capitalist elements into the Stalliongrad economy and pursue a thaw in relations with Harmonist neighbours, with the goal of slowly spreading socialist ideas in Equestria. They maintain that under their program, our productive capacities and standard of living would leapfrog past Equestria, and in the long term socialism would become more popular than if we hold strictly to Marksist orthodoxy.\n\nThe ultra-left faction on the other hoof has no official leader, but is generally dominated by radical general Masha Norushkina. They argue Steel Stallion did not go far enough, and that the NEP should be immediately scrapped and collectivisation accelerated. They also advocate for massive military buildup, a drastic reduction in bureaucracy, and immediate preparation for total war with Equestria to bring the revolution by force."
stalliongrad_start.6.a:0 "They seem disruptive."

stalliongrad_start.7.t:0 "His First Friend" #Danielle suggested
stalliongrad_start.7.d:0 ""I still cannot believe you threw in your lot with Vasily," grumbled Natasha, "Where were those 'Socialism in One Country' types when you were fighting on the streets of Ditrysium?"\n\n"Well if I recall correctly, at the time Vasya was trying to keep the schools running and Altidiya was keeping you all fed."\n\nMuffin took a sip of his soup as emphasis. "Your wife truly does make amazing Okroshka, my friend," Muffin noted, "It has been too long since we saw each other."\n\n"Well," said Natasha, levitating a glass of wine to her mouth, "Politics takes up a lot of time, for both of us. Gold Muffin the Earthpony."\n\nMuffin grinned. When he first came to Stalliongrad, he'd disguised himself as a pony and adopted the name "Gold Muffin" as a cover identity, not knowing if Stalliongrad would welcome a changeling. Natasha had taken him in and shown him around, and she and Vasily had embraced him when he'd revealed his true nature. The name stuck.\n\n"So," Natasha declared, "You want me to support Vasily too. I understand why, you've always advocated unity, but I joined Comrade Masha for a reason. I'm still not quite convinced."\n\n"I understand," said Muffin, "And I won't force you. But I do hope you'll join us. When I first arrived here, while Steel Stallion was still alive, there was this optimism and comradeship in the air. I haven't felt hungry for Love in years. Now though... everypony is becoming entrenched in their factions. The grievances and feuds have piled up. I fear if Vasya fails, that spirit will vanish and never return.""
stalliongrad_start.7.a:0 "Natasha defects to the Centre faction."
stalliongrad_start.7.b:0 "Natasha sticks with Masha."

stalliongrad_start.8.t:0 "Sinister and farmers" #Danielle suggested
stalliongrad_start.8.d:0 ""And what, comrades, have the Rightist faction ever done for you?" Sinister demanded. He was giving a speech at a rural Soviet, which despite representing the farmers of a collective farm had sent a rightist delegate to represent them at the higher levels of the Soviet Republic. One of them had invited Sinister to the barn where they held their meetings, and he had done a fairly good job of convincing them to replace their delegate.\n\n"Well," said one of the farmers, an old pegasus stallion, "There was the NEP.

Masha sat down stiffly, thanking the waiter as he brought them their meal of fish and potatoes. Masha sniffed the fish.\n\n"Tartar sauce, Sladkaya?"\n"Yes?"\n"I am sure you are aware that none of my enlisted soldiers get tartar sauce on their fish rations. Why should generals like me and party officials like yourself eat better than the common soldier?"\n\n"Mashka, I merely wanted to-"\n"To subtly bribe me? To curry favour? And another thing. My friends can call me "Mashka" or "Vampirenok," but from you it is insulting. I am not some child any more, comrade Sladkaya."\n\nKaramelka sighed. So young, so fiery... she just needed a few more years to figure herself out and she'd be an admirable communist, but until that happened she was just insufferable.\n\n"Look, Comrade Norushkina. Are we going to discuss how to prevent Vasiliy from destroying both of our factions' ability to do anything, and possibly have us both expelled from the party as revisionists-"\n"I am no revisionist!"\n"Once Vasiliy secures control, he'll get to decide who is and is not a revisionist.

It had been mixed with distilled love, passively gathered by Gold Muffin from all the friends and comrades he'd made since his fateful flight cacross the tundra to Stalliongrad. Vasiliy was waxing poetic about his plans again, more than a little tipsy. Sinister liked him like this, casual and enthusiastic. It was a side not many got to see of the premier, who most thought was a dour bureaucrat all the time.\n\n"And thank you, Sinister!" the red-maned stallion slurred, turning to his friend, "Without you, and uh, and you too Muffin! And you too. But I'll get to that in a sec, without you, I woulda stayed in the planning office forever! And everypony told me to ditch you, but I knew, I knew! You've really come through Sinister, with all those things you've been doing in the place with those ponies..."\n\nGold Muffin laughed. Sinister gave a mock curtsy. "I live to serve the revolution, my dear Vasya!"\n\n"To the revolution!" Vasiliy proclaimed, then realized his glass was empty. Muffin gave a tiny shake of his head, indicating there would be no more for the premier. Sinister smiled.

stalliongrad_start.26.d:0 ""...Although our efforts have thus far focused on supporting comrades in Baltimare's trade unions and the socialist sailors in Vanhoover, we the undersigned believe in accordance with the principle of internationalism that more must be done. In particular, there are two major untapped populations. First, we hold that the Crystal Ponies would be receptive to us, as they feel the alienation of capitalism more acutely due to only recently being proletarianised after long existence in a pre-capitalist state."\n\n"For similar reasons, the batponies of Equestria would turn to socialism easily if given the right push. Many batponies have only recently joined the proletariat, having been displaced into the cities by primitive accumulation and facing particularly poor working conditions. While many of them cling to monarchism in the vain hope that Princess Luna will help, the last seven years of inaction have resulted in many turning to more radical voices. If we do not act soon, they will turn to reactionary nationalism or other alternative ideologies for a solution. To facilitate this, we the undersigned recommend a 20% increase in funding to the program for helping revolutionaries abroad..."\n\nAltidiya considered the proposal. It was signed not only by Masha's clique of radicals, but by several members of the majority, including Sinister Serov and Gold Muffin. It was bold, dangerous even. Karamelka had just come to her last week, suggesting that funding communists in Equestria was taking vital resources away from the people of Stalliongrad, and that "poking the Equestrian Ursa" risked an unwinnable war if our operations were discovered.\n\nVasiliy, for his part, had insisted that our current operations were quite secure, but that expanding to the Crystal Empire and the batponies would surely result in our discovery. As a matter of clandestine operations, the decision was Altidiya's alone to make."

stalliongrad_start.27.t:0 "Socialism in One Country?"
stalliongrad_start.27.d:0 "One of the more controversial doctrines adopted during the Altidiya years is Socialism In One Country, that is to say, the doctrine that our efforts should primarily focus on building a shining, self-sufficient socialist state in Severyana.\n\nThe ultra-lefts in particular have always opposed that move, arguing in line with classical Marksism that the revolution is international in character and that our worker's state will degenerate into state capitalism unless we rapidly spread the revolution to Equestria, at the bare minimum.\n\nThe right opposition are also skeptical, but instead argue that a period of state capitalism is actually necessary to expand the means of production and improve standards of living. All in preparation for spreading the revolution through economics, diplomacy, and force as a last resort. Still, they advocate against scrapping the policy because it clearly communicates to the world that we are not going to invade our neighbours at will.\n\nThe center is divided on the topic, with Sinister Serov largely siding with the ultra-lefts, but Vasiliy arguing that it is possible. He believes that the material conditions in Stalliongrad are sufficient to support, if not full communism, then at least a robust socialism, but only if we are courageous and unified in our pursuit of a better life."

stalliongrad_start.28.t:0 "Freedom of factions or unity?"
stalliongrad_start.28.d:0 "The SCP runs on the principle of democratic centralism, meaning that issues are to be vigorously debated and voted on but then considered closed: once the party has made a decision, it behooves all representatives of the party to support that decision, or to resign. This allows us to maintain democracy and make good decisions, but also to move forward with unity and purpose. "Freedom of Debate, Unity of Action," in theory.\n\nIn practice, the emergence of factions within the party undermines the efficacy of this principle. Party members privately dissent from policies they already had a chance to contest publicly, then those dissensions find their way to the press and chip away at even the appearance of unity. Debates are reopened again and again.\n\nVasiliy's ally Sinister Serov has argued that if this principle is to mean anything, we must curtail factionalism. While it is too soon to ban factions outright, the general secretary can release an official statement condemning them, and institute new rules of order within the Supreme Soviet to better enforce democratic centralism. The ultra-leftist and rightist factions have both objected that these rules will stifle the freedom of debate within the party and lead to rigidity and dogmatism, to which Vasiliy retorted that they would not have been necessary if the factions had not made them necessary with their ceaseless infighting."

This surprised many, who expected him to keep his role as it provided him considerable influence, but Vasiliy insisted that for the good of the people, he had to allow somepony else to fill the role who has more time to devote to it.\n\nHis ally Gold Muffin has suggested Konzan University engineering professor Alevtina Qubysheva as his replacement. She has only ever dabbled in politics, but seems to be a favour high-tech industries as the core of Stalliongrad's economic progress. Her professional, apolitical stance has caused some within the Right opposition to support her too.\n\nThe left opposition has put forward their own candidate, a more well-known pony named Psychic Sigil who was responsible for the developing our armaments industry. Whoever is chosen will have a big task ahead of them, as Stalliongrad's industry grows larger and more complicated by the day, and coordinating it all is quickly becoming a monumental task."

While we have not had a true famine yet, the People's Commissariat of Agriculture reports that we are perhaps one bad winter away from one.\n\nAccordingly, the party voted at the 1004 SCP Congress to prioritise the production of agricultural machinery. Now we must decide where to distribute these combine harvesters, tractors, and other equipment. Vasiliy suggests that we send the majority out to the collective farms, and if the private farms want them, they can buy them from the state. This will cause more farmers to embrace collectivisation and generate state revenue.\n\nThe opposition argue that now is not the time to play favourites and that we should ship the machinery out to all our farmers. Many suspect the left opposition has sided with the rightists on this because of some deal, or because they see no need to encourage collectivisation through economics when they plan to do it by force."

Vasiliy waited as Altidiya officially opened the tenth party Congress, barely hearing her words as his mind raced with what could go wrong. He almost didn't hear when the General Secretary announced it was time for him to propose his first resolution.\n\nIt had taken so much effort to get Vasiliy's anti-corruption resolution to the top of the list, but Vasiliy knew it would be worth it. This would allow him to set the tone for the entire Congress. Stepping up to the podium, he began:\n"Comrades, I am not going to mince words. The Party is in distress. I have long spoken out against factionalism, this you all know, but today I would like to begin with something that unites us all: the duty of every representative of the SCP to serve the interests of the people and the revolution, rather than their private interests."\n\n"It is precisely the temptation to profit off of their offices which turns factionalism from a healthy part of party democracy into a source of deadlock. Therefore, I propose a new set of countermeasures to ensure that every official be subject to proper performance evaluations, and that corruption be dealt with swiftly and conclusively."\n\nAfter a few minutes of clarifying questions from Karamelka, the vote was called, and the resolution passed easily."

Comrade Sladkaya, your efforts kept us from famine, and brought the prosperity you have always believed we needed before creating socialism. For that, we thank you."\n\nVasiliy glanced at Masha's crowd. Good. Sinister was where he was supposed to be, keeping the batpony distracted so she couldn't rally her faction to denounce Muffin as a revisionist or whatever insult she thought of for somecreature with something good to say about the NEP. Muffin finished his speech. As expected, Karamelka Sladkaya got up to argue against him.\n\n"Thank you, comrade Muffin, for your kind words. However, I argue that we have not achieved the prosperity necessary to go forward with collectivisation. As Comrade Muffin said, the NEP generates prosperity and security, increasing median real income yearly since its adoption and limiting inflation. Why should we throw it away?"\n\nVasiliy relaxed. Of course, Karamelka would argue against it, but he could already feel her losing the delegates as she got into dry economic data, sounding more like a bourgeois economist by the moment. Sinister was joking around with some of the delegates, and it was clear Karamelka wouldn't be able to stop it. When the vote came, even some of the rightists voted in favour of phasing out the NEP."

For that, we thank you."\n\nThe first sign something was wrong was when Dark Wing, not Karamelka, got up to speak against the resolution. "Comrade Muffin declared that we are prosperous. This begs the question: prosperous relative to whom? Certainly not Manehattan, or the other large cities which have access to the Equestrian market." Dark Wing took a moment, letting the ultra-left faction jeer at him, Sinister failing to stop Masha from yelling "Counter-revolutionary!"\n"There is another thing I find interesting. Obviously, Comrade Muffin, you are complimenting Karamelka as part of Vasiliy's plans to implement measures to, in his words, 'Advance the revolution and serve the people.' As if those are always the same thing. I did find it ironic you started with anti-corruption, given where Serov gets the money for his walk-in closet full of dresses and his other one full of suits."\n\n"This again, Dark Wing?" Sinister shouted, "You and your cronies have already had me investigated for corruption twice and they found nothing; I am simply very good at shopping!"\n\n"Very good at not getting caught!" hollered one of the rightist delegates.\n"Comrades, enough shouting!" said  Dark Wing, but the damage was done. The room descended into accusations and personal attacks, with every potentate of every faction feeling the need to deliver a lengthy speech on the last speech. The first day fo the Congress closed before they got to voting on the resolution."

Maybe Comrade Norushkina is ready to choke on burners, but I, like  most of our comrades, prefer to eat delicious pies.

She had saved the republic from its enemies, and all those voices which once whispered behind her back had fallen silent.\n\n"Comrades," she began, "It is with great humility that I accept the position of General Secretary of the Stalliongradian Communist Party. Our Socialist Republic has gone through much in these last years. So much anger and violence. But now, it is a new day. Now, Stalliongrad is united once more, and ready to face the future. There can be no equality without freedom, and there can be no freedom without equality. Socialism and liberty go hoof-in-hoof, and from this day forward, we will stand as a beacon of both. From this day forth, we will go forward fearlessly, our resolve tempered by mercy yet unshakable all the same. I accept this solemn duty, and invite you all to walk the path of revolution with me. Thank you.""

stalliongrad_start.83.d:0 "Masha and Sinister sat across from the two generals. Stremmenoy and Ketola: two ponies who had expressed sympathies towards the ultra-left, and who hadn't been shy about getting involved in politics. They had been talking for hours about the sorry state of the SCP and the need for action.\n\n"In the end, all you'd have to do would be to do nothing," Masha argued, "You'll be on standby unless somepony else tries to interfere. My own troops would handle the wetwork..."\n\nIt was then that the SePo entered the room. The four immediately got up, realising too late that they hadn't come armed. Three SePo ponies stood at attention as Danila Bagryan, former chief of the SePo, stepped into the room.\n\n"My my my," Danila said, "What do we have here? No, don't answer, I already know." He closed the door before continuing. "You are preparing a coup d'etat, are you not?"\n\n"Danila, comrade," began Sinister, but Danila waved a hoof.\n\n"Oh come now Sinnie. If I wanted to stop you, I wouldn't have come here myself. Just be glad it was I who found out and not Mistina or one of the others. No, I'm here to join you. Don't look so surprised! Everything you've been blathering about, I already know. Altidiya has gone soft. If Steel Stallion could see our party now, he would throw up. I warned him what would happen if he didn't purge Karamelka and the other weaklings, but alas, Stallion always had a soft side. It's a pity. So, here is my offer: I'll help you, if you reinstate my doctrines of Revolutionary Terror and allow me and the SePo a free hoof to pursue our duty to guard the revolution. Deal?"

Again and again, she muttered to herself: "How did it come to this?"\n\nEventually, the pair came upon a body which hadn't been cleaned up yet. One of their enemies, a pegasus in the uniform of the Pioneers and bearing a crudely-stitched Sinister badge, half-buried under debris and still clutching his pistol. Karemelka nearly collapsed at the sight.\n\n"Oh- oh sweet Celestia-" she whispered involuntarity, "H- help me," her legs gave way, and Dark Wing had to hold her up.\n\n"He was a child," Karamelka whispered while Dark Wing stared on, expressionless, "He should never have gotten involved...

For whatever reason, Princess Cadance is more willing to deal with us than Princess Celestia. In 1005, when we faced raw material shortfalls under blockade, Vasiliy and Karamelka brokered a deal with the resource-rich but technology-poor nation to help both of us. The "Copper for Crystals deal," as it was called, had us send engineers and electricians to electrify the Crystal City and lay down telephone wires across the nation, in exchange for large shipments of magical crystals, raw iron, and other resources.\n\nThat deal never sat well with the Ultra-Left faction. To them, the Crystal Empire should be a beachhead, not a trading partner. Repeatedly, Masha Norushkina has argued that we should seek to radicalise the Crystal Ponies, given that they are new to capitalism and not infected with its ideology. Instead, she lamented, we directly gave them the benefits of electricity and let their princess take the credit, endearing them to capitalist monarchy even more.\n\nNow, with the time coming to send an ambassador to the Crystal Empire, she has made a push within the Soviets to have herself sent over rather than Karamelka. Doubtless, she would use that visit to make contact with dissidents in the Empire. Karamelka for her part is looking forward to attending a banquet and meeting Princess Flurry Heart, as well as discussing further trade between our nations."

He asked to see our camps, some towns under our control, asked us what we'd done with certain reactionaries... Apparently he nearly threw up when his handler told him the details. He ended his visit by leaving a scathing letter for [GRW.GetLeader], disparaging our methods.\n\nOur soldiers had a good laugh after he was gone. It seems these days the 'Home of the Revolution' is being run by eggheaded, holier-than-thou theorists rather than actual revolutionaries.

 stalliongrad.200.d:0 "I have been advised by many of my peers that writing this letter is not only an exercise in futility, but a betrayal of those who died when we tore ourselves away from the Equestrian motherland. You are autocrats, they insist, and in doing this we will throw away all that we achieved and become once again slaves under distant, uncaring demigoddesses. I, perhaps naively, write with the intent to prove these ponies wrong. Though it would be delusional to deny the scars of our history and the blood that was spilled when we rose up, the actions taken by Princess Celestia during the revolution tells me that, despite what accusations may be levied against her, she stands in stark contrast to countless other autocrats who would have refused to stay their hoof where she did.\n\nThe division that has plagued the state of Severyana in recent times is no secret, nor has the grace and restraint shown by Canterlot gone unnoticed. Though we have been less than perfect neighbours since the division between us, this accusation cannot by any metric be levied against Equestria. What then should the course of Severyana be? Should it seem to foment unrest and further violence, or should it remember the oldest tales of our people, the tales that speak of division overcome by hope, and how trust forged unity and survival for all of ponykind? I am not a scholar enough to judge the veracity of these tales, but I can see the hoof that has remained outstretched to us, and I can recognise that bitter pride does not build a worthwhile future.\n\nAs General Secretary of Severyana, I hereby wish to affirm my government's desire to re-open negotiations regarding the relationship between our two nations. Though our shared past has been painful, wounds can heal, and scars can fade, if they are but given proper care."

He raised one eyebrow as he put down the latest report on her desk.\n\n"Yes, the rest of the ultraleftists. Those who knew of this and kept silent. Those who cheered for it. Those in the streets with guns. This rot goes deep, and if we want to excise it-"\n\n"Rot!?" Karamelka snapped at him in disbelief. "These are our comrades! The ones whom we fought alongside to free Severyana! Have you forgotten that? What, are you imagining we should just purge them wholesale? Is that where we're at now?! Are you really that bitter, that you would throw so many of our ponies in arms aside now?! This is not a rot, it's a wound! It needs healing, not more cutting!"\n\n"You know, Sladkaya." Dark Wing sighed as his adjusted his glasses. "The princess' great fault was that she did too little, too late, until the situation boiled over. I'd suggest you take that lesson to heart, because you can't afford to make the same mistake." With that, he turned around and left Karamelka alone with her thoughts."
stalliongrad_karamelka.1.a:0 "There will be justice, but there cannot be vengeance."

stalliongrad_karamelka.2.t:0 "The Masterminds"
stalliongrad_karamelka.2.d:0 "Serov and Norushkina were not alone in their plans to coup the presidium. Dozens of high ranking officials and officers have been uncovered as part of the conspiracy. If the coup had succeeded, they would have been able to assume total control of the apparatus of state. The question is what is done about these ponies now. Karamelka has argued for a light touch and that every effort should be taken to rehabilitate as many of them as possible. For all that just happened, a harsh response will only drive more comrades away. This is especially true as a heavy-hoofed response would risk costing us many capable leaders and functionaries. Delegate Dark Wing has publicly spoken out against the idea of mercy, comparing them to the officers of the Royal Guard during the revolution and saying they deserve as little consideration. Blood runs in the streets and it was spilled on their orders. This, Dark Wing insists, is a betrayal of the highest order and cannot be forgiven."
stalliongrad_karamelka.2.a:0 "We save those whom we can, and condemn those whom we cannot."
stalliongrad_karamelka.2.b:0 "Their only mercy is not facing the same fate of those who died because of them."

stalliongrad_karamelka.3.t:0 "The Rank and File"
stalliongrad_karamelka.3.d:0 "Hundreds of militants flooded the streets during the coup attempt, and though many of them have gone into hiding, many more have been rounded up and are awaiting our decision. Just letting them go is out of the question, but the issue is what we do with them. In the end, they were technically just following orders, and with the confused chain of command for the militias it is no wonder that even those who were not very ideologically motivated ended up getting swept along. Karamelka is of the opinion that they should be facing either prison or penal labour - their choice - and that upon completion of their sentence the matter should be considered settled. A less messy system would not have allowed this, and in this the delegates - not the soldiers - failed. Dark Wing is less charitable, believing they should also be censured and considered ineligible for any positions of authority ever again. Taking up arms and marching against your comrades is much more than a simple mistake, and the consequences are theirs to bear."
stalliongrad_karamelka.3.a:0 "Make use of this second chance, comrades."
stalliongrad_karamelka.3.b:0 "At some point, each pony bears responsibility for her actions."

stalliongrad_karamelka.4.t:0 "The Bystanders"
stalliongrad_karamelka.4.d:0 "Conspiracies never stay entirely hidden. For every additional pony who knows of something, the risk of leaks grow exponentially. The fact that so many were involved with this and yet the affair stayed hidden proves that dozens if not hundreds of ponies knew of it even if they weren't actively involved, and yet they did nothing to stop it. Karamelka has been happy to leave this matter be beyond a public statement. Investigating and prosecuting this would be a massive task, one that would all too easily take the form of a purge. Dark Wing insists that this must be followed up as well. Those who are revealed to have known about the coup and did not alert the presidium were happy to watch arguments be traded for violence, and that cannot be the Severyana that the presidium wants to see. Political violence such as what the left wing attempted is unforgivable, and those who could have stopped it showed where they stood in this."
stalliongrad_karamelka.4.a:0 "Enough with this paranoia, it is time to come together."
stalliongrad_karamelka.4.b:0 "Question key ponies and prosecute those we can."

stalliongrad_karamelka.5.t:0 "Out of the Night"
stalliongrad_karamelka.5.d:0 ""Comrades of the presidium, I address you today with hope and sadness in equal measure. We come out of the events of the last months with new scars and sorrows, having faced division so severe it saw us turn on each other. The events of this winter will forever live in infamy, but at the same time we must take heart and learn from them. We allowed disunity and pride to fester, and in the end the unthinkable seemed rational." Karamelka was certain she'd relive these last weeks for the rest of her life, but the future waited for no mare.\n\n"Our system - born out of a struggle for freedom and for food - has not kept up with the changes of these last years, and we are must reevaluate ourselves. How did this happen, and how can we make sure it never happens again? I say it is because we stand divided on how we shall advance the socialist cause, and have been trying to do all things at once. If we are to navigate these waters, we must remember why we do what we do, and who we do it for."\n\n"We rose not for nationalist pride or global revolution, we rose so that our neighbors could eat, and to take charge of our own destiny. It is time we remember this. We have housed many of our people, but we need to go further and make the Severyanian worker's home the envy of the world. We have opened the political arena, but we must secure it against future radicalisation. We have given Severyana hope, but we must give it a future. Instead of dreaming of wars and death for the sake of the revolution, we must establish a model state for all to see. Our system was described by Caramel Marks as the end goal of history, and rather than inviting hostility through aggression, we shall let the flower of socialism bloom and let the results speak for themselves."\n\n"Comrades of the Presidium, let us build our All Ponies' Home together, and let the world see that we can do better. Thank you." She smiled for the first time now as the applause of the gathered delegates filled the presidium. Despite all that had been, and no matter how dark the night was, they still had hope."

### Dark Wing Events ###

stalliongrad_darkwing.1.t:0 "The Motion of No Confidence"
stalliongrad_darkwing.1.d:0 "Dark Wing stared Karamelka down, the mask finally slipping as he allowed his cold anger at her to be plainly visible. Over and over he had warned her, and it had all been in vain. Cradling that naive hope that the fence could be mended between them and the ultraleftists, she would let that rot back in among them. Unity above all, even if you'd let a mad animal back into your home.\n\n"124 votes for, 107 against. Delegate Dark Wing's motion of no confidence passes," Gold Muffin's voice echoed through the presidium, Dark Wing raising his hooves to begin applauding the decision and still looking straight at Karamelka. He didn't plan to flinch from what he had done, even as he could tell how deeply it hurt her that 'Krylyshko' had turned on her like this. Rising from her seat, she struggled to collect herself before addressing the presidium.\n\n"The presidium has spoken, and I will abide by its choice. I only ask that we remain united, and that despite our troubled history we do not further turn on each other." With that, she stepped away from the seat and walked towards the exit, right by him. "I really didn't think you'd be the one..." she murmured as she passed him by.\n\nDark Wing didn't reply. He could say many things. He could tell her she never really knew him, that not everypony was so enamoured by 'unity' as she was, that she was a useful idiot for those who'd see her in fetters or killed. He didn't though, there was no point. Severyana was what mattered right now."
stalliongrad_darkwing.1.a:0 "It's time to get to work."

stalliongrad_darkwing.2.t:0 "General Secretary Dark Wing."
stalliongrad_darkwing.2.d:0 "With Karamelka Sladkaya's attempts at mercy having reached a fever pitch, she had alienated not only many of her own faction, but many centrists as well. While she might have believed that there was still hope for reconciliation, she had missed the whispers behind her that had pressured her fellow rightists about whether they truly believed that the murderous ultraleftists would not see weakness instead of clemency. They had already attempted to overthrow the presidium, so why would they not try again when all their failure earned them was some hoof-waggling and disapproving looks? A pruned tree would grow branches yet again, and Karamelka refused to even consider the axe.\n\nHad he stabbed the mare that trusted him when nopony else did in the back? Yes. Had he essentially proven the ones that had viewed him with suspicion right? Yes. Could it be argued he proved the ultraleftists right? Yes. Politics did that to you, and he had know about this ever since he served under the pre-revolutionary Duma. Still, he was done placing his faith in other ponies."
stalliongrad_darkwing.2.a:0 "If not me, then who?"

stalliongrad_darkwing.3.t:0 "A Military Beyond Reproach"
stalliongrad_darkwing.3.d:0 ""The neutrality of our armed forces shall therefore be written into the Severyanian constitution. As the event of these previous months have shown, those who took oaths to defend our nation and people cannot be embroiled in factional infighting. Severyana, all of it, relies on them for protection, and this protection must be one that takes no sides other than that of the nation and the revolution." The applause filled the presidium, and Dark Wing smiled slightly as he looked towards Lunin, who was sitting in the audience.\n\nHe knew what the old warhorse was thinking. While this did offer the military guarantees, it also meant that from now on it would be trivial to demand that any politically uncomfortable officers be expelled or censured. This included Lunin, who now would have the government breathing down his neck to trot the line. Lunin knew this. Dark Wing knew that he knew, and Lunin knew that Dark Wing knew.\n\nOf course he could buck these rules, but that would mean bringing the military into open revolt and be forced to seize control himself without a shred of legitimacy. Until then though, the military would be under control."
stalliongrad_darkwing.3.a:0 "Long Live the Loyal Defenders of Severyana."

stalliongrad_darkwing.4.t:0 "No Patience for Those who Sought Blood"
stalliongrad_darkwing.4.d:0 "The expulsion of the ultraleftists was swift, but steady, and within a few days they were effectively undone as a serious political force. With their leaders already imprisoned, the remaining delegates were brought to heel by a new anti-extremist bill that outlawed any political organisation that had participated in violent activities against the state and expelled any representatives who had supported such actions from the SCP. Even if some ultras could hang on by the skin of their teeth, they were reduced to a tiny fraction on the very fringe whose association with the failed coup would tarnish them.\n\nThe expelled delegates meanwhile would spend weeks if not months bickering about who would become the new figureheads of whatever new organisation they'd create, and as they bickered there would be plenty of time for SePo to pick off more of them for whatever actions they took that were even slightly out of line and leave the more obviously insane or unstable ones around to scare ponies off. In the end the movement would be discredited and reduced to a small rabble of howling lunatics taken seriously by nopony.\n\nThat was the thing about crushing something. You could try to do it in one move, but many times a slow squeeze worked even better."
stalliongrad_darkwing.4.a:0 "There won't be a second chance for them."

stalliongrad_darkwing.5.t:0 "The Stavropon Congress"
stalliongrad_darkwing.5.d:0 "The old estate right outside of Stavropon had been built over two centuries ago for the then new Tsaritsa of Severyana - Princess Celestia. Yet while it had seen the occasional use, she had rarely come here as she had preferred to be in the capitol among other ponies when visiting. The choice of venue was quite intentional though, and Dark Wing smiled for the cameras as he shook hooves with the ponies that came up the stairs to it.\n\nAfter the coup attempt, all of Severyana had been tense, and Karamelka's limp-hoofed handling of the ultraleftists had not helped. There was fear and uncertainty still, and unlike some, Dark Wing was not too good to speak with those who had kept Severyana going.\n\n"Thank you, everypony, for being here today," he addressed the crowd as they all had moved into the ballroom which now was used as a congress hall. "I speak to you today not merely as the General Secretary, but as somepony who has worked for the betterment of Severyana for decades. We have all gone through a trying period of time recently - a period that was the apex of years of confusion and lack of direction. We sought unity, yet fanatics responded with trying to claim dominance. Fortunately, disaster was avoided, but we should not treat this matter as settled. There will always be those who view our struggle for the common pony as a religious purity test, and who will gladly view the moderates among them as traitors or heretics. I have assembled you all - industrialists, artists, civil servants, union leaders, academics - here today to not to preach, but to listen. I expect there to be disagreements, but I also know that these will not end in bloodshed. Not here, not among us. Thank you for being here, and may sanity prevail in the end.""
stalliongrad_darkwing.5.a:0 "A toast to a new start!"

stalliongrad_darkwing.6.t:0 "The Liberalisation Debate"
stalliongrad_darkwing.6.d:0 "The Stavropon Congress is not playing host only to the captains of industry, but also of culture and arts. One of the foremost among these is the former diplomat and playwright Maxim Mukhomorov. After he decided that he should mock the communist party as relentlessly as he did the Duma, the old eccentric was 'convinced' to retire lest he become charged with spreading reactionary propaganda. Retirement however has not dulled the old writer, only made him even more of a firebrand, and he's argued ferociously for that Severyana must liberalise and open itself not only to the world, but to its people. What kind of liberty leaves one having to cower in fear of angering the wrong people he asks. If one claims to struggle for the common pony, they should have more freedom and not less.\n\nThough the congress has promised to be an open space, his bluntness has nevertheless made many uncomfortable as he. Thankfully during the later parts of the day he has been largely absent, being last seen out in the garden taking an extended post-lunch (and post-twenty drinks) nap. This has given Ryabinka Terpkaya, recently returned from Skyfall after the revolution saw her life's work ruined, time to speak up.\n\nTerpkaya too wants to see the average Severyanian empowered, but believes that the best way to do so is to remember who they are. With the desire to build a new communist identity, what happens then with the old Severyanian ways? Ripping it all up by the roots will just leave the Severyanian ponies adrift in the world, and if the congress is to call for anything, it should be the revitalisation of Severyana's culture instead of trying to throw it all away. Change should empower, not alienate, and if Severyana remembers who she is she will be stronger for it, and the world will hear her."
stalliongrad_darkwing.6.a:0 "Mukhomorov is right! Freedom is non-negotiable, and we must fight for it!"
stalliongrad_darkwing.6.b:0 "Maybe Terpkaya is right... in the struggle for a new world, we forgot who we are."

stalliongrad_darkwing.7.t:0 "The Future of Industry"
stalliongrad_darkwing.7.d:0 "Severyana has been an industrial powerhouse since the industrial revolution, but that does not mean that it has not faced issues in recent times. For all the importance placed on industry and construction by the SCP, there is a lot of discontent regarding how things have been managed. Mitya Gearin and his sister Meachta have spoken out against the political involvement in factory management, and how the presidium's grandstanding plans repeatedly have produced situations where Severyana's economy has been hamstrung by the need to be more socialist about how they run things. The recent attempt to open Severyana more to international trade owes its failure to this confusion, and Meachta, who was deeply involved in said project, has urged the congress to push for greater freedom of management. Running a factory, or encouraging international trade is not a matter of being the most socialist, and too much political interference only weakens Severyana.\n\nIn the other end, Shpala Beryozkina of the civil service has argued that the problem is not found in the presidium per se, but rather the inability to commit to one overarching plan. The government is more than capable of providing the stability that Severyana's industry needs, and should commit to fulfilling this role properly. This is especially true when it comes to infrastructure and housing, as good transportation, well-housed workers and political stability will be as important to ensure good productivity."
stalliongrad_darkwing.7.a:0 "The Gearins are bold, but they have a point."
stalliongrad_darkwing.7.b:0 "Beryozkina's ideas are attractive, and uncontroversial too."

stalliongrad_darkwing.8.t:0 "The Declaration of the 231"
stalliongrad_darkwing.8.d:0 "With the Congress of Stavropon finishing, the attending ponies have made a unified statement not as a political body, but as captains of industry, academic heads, cultural thought-leaders and union leaders, all addressing the presidium and the General Secretary.\n\nThe central role of the SCP since the revolution made its voice supreme, and due to this it has sometimes drowned out other voices. In the quest for political balance, academia has found itself curtailed in fields due to their findings making certain extremists accuse them of reactionary activity. Local factory managers and union leaders have found themselves needing to conform to various national level decisions and socialist doctrines instead of having room to adapt to local conditions. International trade has been all but nonexistent and what little has managed to survive is forced to leap through countless hoops. The cultural sphere finds itself curtailed more than even before the revolution by the demand that it does not question the powers that be, and many of those most fervent critics of the old Duma now are expected to fawn over and praise the SCP to not rock the boat.\n\nTogether, these voices are calling for the reformation and liberalisation of the Severyanian system to ensure that the knowledge of its cultural, economic and scientific experts is not wasted due to political dogmatism. Severyana can still blossom even more if only its greatest minds are afforded the freedom to adapt and improve."
stalliongrad_darkwing.8.a:0 "To Progress and to Freedom!"

stalliongrad_darkwing.9.t:0 "The Open Hoof"
stalliongrad_darkwing.9.d:0 "The ultraleftists were marginalised, and the Stavropon congress had created a political momentum that wasn't constrained by SCP dogma. Maybe it was too early to make the next move, but Dark Wing wasn't going to let the moment slip away. Right now, more than ever before, Severyana was pliable, and he studied the letter he had written and rewritten a dozen times by now.\n\nAddressed to Princesses Celestia and Luna, it informed them that Severyana was willing to reopen negotiations regarding the relationship between the two nations. Throwing in some references to the Hearthswarming Miracle, he signalled that he was hoping for more than just rapproachment. The implications would be clear; if Equestria played her cards right, Severyana might come back to them. Not as a constituent nation, that was much too bold a thought, but as an aligned nation for sure.\n\nDark Wing had never been very enthusiastic about the idea of Severyanian independence. There was a reason the last Tsar had given up his crown to Celestia, and whatever blame one laid at her hooves, she had overseen a thousand years of stability whereas Severyana had managed ten before they began killing each other in the streets. In little more than a decade, the revolution had become a deity, and the ultras were its prophets fighting the heretics. At least the Sun would not want to kill him.\n\nSeveryana had proved how easy it was to fall to political infighting and violence, and even if many ponies would not be humbled by it, Dark Wing was. It was time to offer a chance to make amends, and try a different path. They could call him whatever they liked, he was long past caring what violent zealots and murderers thought of him."
stalliongrad_darkwing.9.a:0 "Sent in greatest secrecy, the letter reached Canterlot three days later."
    
stalliongrad_darkwing.10.t:0 "To the Sovereigns of Equestria, Princesses Celestia and Luna."
stalliongrad_darkwing.10.d:0 "I have been advised by many of my peers that writing this letter is not only an exercise in futility, but a betrayal of those who died when we tore ourselves away from the Equestrian motherland. You are autocrats, they insist, and in doing this we will throw away all that we achieved and become once again slaves under distant, uncaring demigoddesses. I, perhaps naively, write with the intent to prove these ponies wrong. Though it would be delusional to deny the scars of our history and the blood that was spilled when we rose up, the actions taken by Princess Celestia during the revolution tells me that, despite what accusations may be levied against her, she stands in stark contrast to countless other autocrats who would have refused to stay their hoof where she did.\n\nThe division that has plagued the state of Severyana in recent times is no secret, nor has the grace and restraint shown by Canterlot gone unnoticed. Though we have been less than perfect neighbours since the division between us, this accusation cannot by any metric be levied against Equestria. What then should the course of Severyana be? Should it seem to foment unrest and further violence, or should it remember the oldest tales of our people, the tales that speak of division overcome by hope, and how trust forged unity and survival for all of ponykind? I am not a scholar enough to judge the veracity of these tales, but I can see the hoof that has remained outstretched to us, and I can recognise that bitter pride does not build a worthwhile future.\n\nAs General Secretary of Severyana, I hereby wish to affirm my government's desire to re-open negotiations regarding the relationship between our two nations. Though our shared past has been painful, wounds can heal, and scars can fade, if they are but given proper care.\n\n"Sincerely\nGeneral Secretary Dark Wing.""
stalliongrad_darkwing.10.a:0 "Of course we shall hear you out!"

stalliongrad_darkwing.11.t:0 "The Young Princess' Arrival"
stalliongrad_darkwing.11.d:0 "The approaching train was pulled by a steam locomotive painted in vibrant colors, and in its wake, Severyana would be changed forever. Dark Wing took a stedy, deep breath as it pulled into the station and came to a slow stop. There was no turning back now he thought as he saw movement inside the train. After a brief delay, six ponies stepped out of the lead cart, Dark Wing studying them quietly.\n\nThe six heroes of Equestria, Princess Twilight Sparkle and her friends. Heroes who had intervened in crisis after crisis during the last few years, and through their actions risen to become exemplars of the nation, heroes of Harmony. They were barely more than fillies... or perhaps he was just too old. He came out of his reverie as Twilight Sparkle slowly came up towards him, awkwardly nodding in greeting.\n\n"Thank you for your invitation, General Secretary Dark Wing. We... we are not running late, are we?" Dark Wing realized he had been looming again and cleared his throat.\n\n"Not at all, Princess Sparkle," he assured her. "Welcome to Severyana. I am happy to receive you and your friends." He held out a hoof towards her to shake it. She reciprocated, thankfully, and he followed suit with her friends. "Please, let us head for your accommodations. There is much to discuss, but I am sure you'll want to rest after your journey." He followed them out to the waiting cars, actively focusing on keeping his face in check.\n\n"Did you not get enough sleep tonight because you were nervous?" Pinkie Pie was her name, Baker and Party Planner. She bounced up next to him, surprisingly fast, "We were nervous too! Twilight didn't sleep a wink because she was too busy-" Whatever she was about to say was cut off as Twilight, mortified, shoved a hoof in her face to stop her. The entire display left Dark Wing giving them a small smile."
stalliongrad_darkwing.11.a:0 ""Thank you for your consideration, but I will be fine.""

stalliongrad_darkwing.12.t:0 "The Issue of Severyanian Autonomy"
stalliongrad_darkwing.12.d:0 "While neither side has even mentioned the idea of reestablishing the Duma and both sides have taken it for granted that the Severyanian Presidium will remain, the question of what the exact nature of the relationship between Severyana and Equestria remains unsolved. The presidium has pushed for maintaining as much autonomy as possible, and want the Equestrian interference in Severyanas affairs to be kept at an absolute minimum. Any deference to Equestria should be purely technical, and Severyana should have the final say in all laws and agreements it accepts.\n\nEquestria, meanwhile, is hoping for Severyana to actually integrate into the Equestrian sphere instead of merely technically. This will demand that Severyana make certain concessions regarding its laws and its autonomy, and would make the Dark Wing, in essence, "Minister of Severyana". Equestria has guaranteed that the only Minister Severyana sees is the one it elects for itself, but it is still a hard sell.""
stalliongrad_darkwing.12.a:0 "Minister of Severyana Dark Wing it is."
stalliongrad_darkwing.12.b:0 "The Presidium will remain separate and have the final say."

stalliongrad_darkwing.13.t:0 "The Development Exchange Programme"
stalliongrad_darkwing.13.d:0 "Already before the revolution, the Severyana ponies' technical acumen was well known, and during it, Severyana's improvised armored vehicles changed warfare forever. The topic of these inventions and technical development was inevitably going to become a hot-button issue. The presidium has pushed for maintaining Severyana's technical institutes separate from Equestria's, and that if technology is shared, it will only be after prior authorisation from the presidium.\n\nIn the other end, Equestria is pushing for complete scientific integration as keeping the two nations apart will only weaken them both. Severyana has benefitted enormously from Equestrian development as well, and Equestria entertains no plans on limiting Severyana's access. All they ask for is reciprocity."
stalliongrad_darkwing.13.a:0 "There is no reason to keep our systems separate."
stalliongrad_darkwing.13.b:0 "For now at least, we will approve technological sharing on a yearly basis."

stalliongrad_darkwing.14.t:0 "The Expansion of Private Ownership"
stalliongrad_darkwing.14.d:0 "Equestria guarantees its ponies wide-ranging rights, including property rights, and Celestia has always been loath to interfere with this. This became part of why the revolution erupted, as so much wealth had been focused in the hooves of the Duma and other nobles. Yet, if Severyana is to align itself with Equestria, this must be addressed. Compromise can only reach so far, and the Presidium is pushing hard for keeping a cap on private ownership to ensure that there cannot ever again be the kind of concentration of wealth that sparked the uprising.\n\nDue to the sensitivity of the topic, Equestria has been modest with their demands. They request that instead of a strict cap, Severyana entertains the idea of progressive taxation  that caps out at 90%. As much as they respect Severyana's reservations regarding personal wealth, mass seizures of property is a step too far for them, and would mean that they would abandon many ponies in southern Severyana to have their property seized."
stalliongrad_darkwing.14.a:0 "Progressive taxation it is, but we set the tax brackets."
stalliongrad_darkwing.14.b:0 "The cap will remain in place, but we will discuss compensations."

stalliongrad_darkwing.15.t:0 "The Reparations Debate"
stalliongrad_darkwing.15.d:0 "The final and most infected question of the negotiations concern reparations for those who suffered during the revolution. To many Severyanians, the concept of paying reparations to the wealthy elites that starved them for centuries is as absurd as it is obscene. The Presidium has instead suggested continuing to pay pensions to their own wounded and widowed, and are asking that Equestria pays the old landowners themselves if they view the matter as so important.\n\nEquestria is adamant that Severyana reconsiders. If the goal is to find reconciliation, the reparations are too important to be left aside. The majority of those affected by the revolution were not landowners, but regular ponies who fled their homes to escape the fighting. If the wounds are to heal, both sides must be committed to giving compensation to those who suffered."  
stalliongrad_darkwing.15.a:0 "We will pay all that is asked, and Equestria will do the same."
stalliongrad_darkwing.15.b:0 "We will pay a standardised sum per pony, but that is all we can offer."

stalliongrad_darkwing.16.t:0 "The Signing of the Severyanian-Equestrian Accords"
stalliongrad_darkwing.16.d:0 "He really did not have a face for smiling Dark Wing thought as he looked at the newspaper. No wonder Sladkaya had always said he 'loomed', the smile he was wearing on the picture looked almost forced. Yet, he had felt happiness at that moment, or at least satisfaction. Severyana and Equestria were now aligned, with Severyana formally having joined the UPA and started to reintegrate into the Equestrian economic sphere.\n\nYet at the same time, its independence was guaranteed, and Equestria would undertake no actions to challenge it. Only a majority vote by the Severyanian people would change this, and no such vote could happen for at least three years. Additionally, Equestria would not interfere with the organisation or advocacy of any socialist groups as long as they were not espousing violence. Severyana meanwhile would not seek to overthrow the Equestrian government. Of course, that rule applied to the government, and not the Severyanian unions. Celestia's disciple had not had it in her to try to demand that the ponies of Severyana would be politically quarantined.\n\nSeveryana once again walked side by side with Equestria, only now its people would have absolute freedom to advocate and organise unions, protests, marches and strikes across Equestria. Any infringement on this would violate the accords, and he remembered the despair in Celestia's eyes at the end of the revolution and  the signing of the peace treaty. If Celestia let Severyana go over this, she would have proven to herself that she was like any old tyrant, more concerned with stability than with her little ponies. Dark Wing planned to exploit this to the fullest."

stalliongrad_darkwing.17.d:0 ""I know this must have been hard for you," the princess told Dark Wing as they stood on the balcony overlooking the city. Mugs of warm tea as well as the hearty dinner they had enjoyed kept them warm in the cool evening. "You've gone against many of your comrades from what I hear. Comrades who still believe in this whole project. To abandon it takes a strong pony."\n\n"What project are we seeking to abandon?" Dark Wing asked before taking a sip of his tea. "Do you mean the socialist project? The problems that Caramel Marks wrote about have not gone away. We want to restore our bonds with Equestria, but that doesn't mean we will stop fighting for the common pony."\n\n"But princess Celestia addressed them," Twilight objected. "In the wake of the revolution she ordered reforms across Equestria. She established welfare programs, shored up labour rights. It took time, I know, but she came around. It didn't have to be this way..."  Dark Wing looked at her for a few seconds, deathly silent, before sighing.\n\n"Be very careful here. She was our monarch, and we spent decades, centuries, starving because she could not act in time. Generations lived and died in poverty because she played a great game of balance. What would you tell those hungry and downtrodden? 'Suffer in silence, for in time, surely the eternal monarch will do something?' Do you understand what an insult that is for those who learn to boil tree roots and mix bark into their flour to make it last? We won't - cannot - go back to being nothing but sedate subjects. We are empowered to take charge of our fate, and we have the scars to show what happens when you don't do that. She did more for us than any other monarch would have, we remember that, but we also remember how she failed us." He leaned in closer to her, staring her down, "Is that unacceptable to Equestria? Must our return be followed by absolute subjugation? Carefully consider that, Iskorka, for it will determine what happens going ahead.""

 STG_ELYTRA_DESC:0 "Though born into the role of queen, Elytra had to flee the changeling lands after her hive was conquered by Chrysalis during the unification of the hives. Along with a small band of survivors, she fled as far away as she could and ended up in Severyana. Hiding among the ponies there, she and her former hivemates ended up dragged into the revolution as the ponies that had welcomed them took up arms. Elytra's military experience aided the revolutionaries greatly, and she was made an officer at the end of the war.\n\nAs an officer however, the inconsistencies in her background that had remained hidden came to light, and she was forced to reveal her true identity. Though her status as a royal has drawn suspicion, she was nevertheless allowed to keep her rank. She now serves to protect the only home she has."
 POLITICS_SINISTER_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: March 15, 971 ALB, Konzan\n\n§YBiography§!: Hailing from the city of Konzan, the life of Sinister Serov (or Sinnie to friends) has been one of constant restructuring and inventing. Born into a family of workers, and before that, peasants, Serov, despite being an earth pony, would take an active interest in magic and in the technological uses of it. First in his family to attain technical education as a machinist, a chance meeting between him and a friend would change the trajectory of his life.\n\nRecruited into the NELP in the summer of 995 by his friends, he would join the underground cell as their weaponsmith, a talent appreciated by his comrades, not so much by their enemies and would advance in the grades, managing the militias in Konzan during the revolution. Following the Revolution, he would rise through the ranks within the party, going from rank-and-file bureaucrat to member of the Supreme Soviet by 1001 as part of his promotion to a member of the People’s Commissariat of Economic Development. A promotion to the Central Committee in 1003 would soon follow, striking up a friendship with Vasiliy on the way to the current day.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
 ADVISOR_SINISTER_DESC:0 "Sinister does exercise pretty strict messaging control once he's committed to something though, but his flair and charisma are his strongest traits. He also has a bit of exaggerated self-esteem. Sinnie wants to keep all the things he can get his hooves on in order. He is an experienced technician, however, and can find himself in high-tech research.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
 POLITICS_VASILY_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: February 14, 969 ALB, Petershoof\n\n§YBiography§!: Vasiliy was born in a family of poor city officials. Reading became one of his hobbies since childhood, as he was able to visit the library and read parents' books while they were at work. After graduating from school, he attended Petershoof University, where he studied history and economics, eventually learning the ideas of Caramel Marks and accepting them. During the formation of the NELP he joined their "Young Guards" section. Vasiliy proved to be useful when spreading socialist agitation among his classmates and the workers of nearby factories.\n\nHe engaged in many workers' strikes and social protests in 994 ALB. During the December Revolution, the district organization of NELP under his leadership managed to take control of a major newspaper printing house. He was working in the Petershoof Soviet and was elected to be a member of the Severyanian delegation to negotiate with Equestrians in 995-996 ALB. In 998 ALB he was appointed in the Central Committee of the renamed SCP. During this period he became close friends with Sinister and helped Karamelka Sladkaya in organizing the education system in the Republic. After Stallion's death Vasiliy, Altydia, Sinister and several other leading members of the SCP kept supporting the passed leader's ideas of the development of the country and the revolution, thus leading the Majority of the Party. Since 1004 ALB he has been working as the General People's Representative in Education.\n\nVasiliy can be characterized as a smart pony, he can find an approach to many. However, it was a tough moment for him to choose between Sladkaya as a person and opposing her ideas as "right-wing deviation". While being a bit soft, he knows that his work is required for the good of the revolution and manages to deal with the lack of self-esteem by relying on the help of his party comrades and his friends, including Sinister.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

 POLITICS_ALTY_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 965 ALB, Severokholm\n\n§YBiography§!: Altidiya was born in the workers’ family and became a factory worker herself from childhood, worsing her health for years. She always wanted to change her life to the better and got interested in the ideas of Caramel Marks in youth.\n\nIn 981 she became a member of the Stallion’s “Union of Struggle for Justice” and was engaged in revolutionary activity. She was responsible for USJ’s and later the Labor Party’s activity in Southern Severyana, picking the pseudonyms "Alty Coggydeer" and “Comrade Revoltsova”. During the December Revolution and the following War of Independence she was organizing factories’ militias across the country. Altydia is one of the authors of the first tank projects, which helped Severyanian forces in advancing during the war.\n\nShe was elected representative of the factory she worked in in Severokholm and became a member of the Central Committee in 997. From now Altydia was responsible for re-organizing the party, becoming Stallion’s “left hoof”.\n\nShe became the General Secretary and the leader of the Supreme Soviet after Stallion’s death. Together with her other comrades, Altydia formed the leadership of the Majority of the Severyanian Communist Party. Revoltsova is a well-known organizer in the party, but as the time passes, many say that she is slowly giving back due to health problems and should be put on less responsible work or given a rest as party’s veteran.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
 POLITICS_CARAMELKA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 945 ALB, Petershoof\n\n§YBiography§!: Karamelka Sladkaya was born in a family of weavers and clothes makers, setting the tone for the rest of her life. Her family had enough to get by daily, and she learned her parents' trade quickly, becoming fascinated with cloth, dye, and weaving. Soon she became a respected figure in the ports of the city, helping negotiate between the sailors, the craftsponies, and the traders going around the city's administration. \n\nIn the 980s, she became a leader in the Workers’ Association – a trade union federation, leading it to unification with USJ into the North-Eastern Labour Party. Near her 50th birthday, the city of Petershoof burst into flames as dissenting workers seized the city and declared the Commune. During the fighting to retake the city, Karamelka fled to Manehattan and began to write her works in socialist theory. A year after the Commune was crushed, Karamelka was officially pardoned by the Boyars for charges of treason, and they invited her to a meeting of reconciliation. Her presence at the netting was seen as a sign of progress, that is, until the trap was sprung. Karamelka only barely escaped the massacre of the labor leaders.\n\nAfter the revolution Karamelka was involved in organizing the education and cultural sphere in the Republic, as well as reforming the light industry. Steel Stallion soon passed away, and the choice of a new General Secretary had to be made. Karamelka, of course, put her hat into the ring. And while a considerable faction of the party backed her, a unity candidate, Altidya, won out in the end.\n\nDespite her age, many ponies find Karamelka to be quite attractive. Rumors claim that her jewelry has something to do with the ancient Severyanian magic, but Sladkaya keeps her secrets unrevealed.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

 POLITICS_DARK_WING_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 957 ALB, a small village outside Novoczernushsk\n\n§YBiography§!: Dark Wing was born to a well off farming family as the youngest foal of eight, He was considered the family’s pride due to his sharp mind and ambitious nature, the latter of which made him able to leave for Petershoof to study law after he impressed his teachers. During his student years, he came to sympathise with the USJ and later the NELP, however he avoided joining them as he held political ambitions. Taking a job as a clerk in the Duma, he chose to simply feed information to the socialists to try to advance their cause while also working to try to claim a seat in the Duma.\n\nDuring the revolution, Dark Wing was the eye of the socialists within the duma. As a high-ranking clerk, he had access to every decision they made, and he fed it all to the revolutionaries. He was the one who made sure the Pastilá Strike could happen, he warned the socialists of the ponyhunt that was about to begin, and when violence exploded, it was Dark Wing who had made sure the Duma’s response was as haphazard and disjointed as it was. Yet while he sympathized with the movement and believed in the ideas they espoused, Dark Wing was, and still is, a staunch believer in the ideals of Equestria.\n\nDespite his misgivings, he and his sympathizers continued to work with the movement to push for reconciliation, yet he soon found himself alienated from large parts of the movement, as he became viewed as a "last minute revolutionary" and "fence-sitter". His cooperation with Karamelka Sladkaya was in the end due to her being the only one willing to even entertain the idea.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
 ADVISOR_DARK_WING_DESC:0 "To him, there's no point in drawing a distinction between Severyana and Equestria, and the revolution that saw it break away more culpable for their following troubles than most would accept. He saw a chance to affect change across all of Equestria thrown away for what seemed to him petty Severyanian nationalism, and the princess that could have listened had they given her a chance dismissed for illogical reasons."

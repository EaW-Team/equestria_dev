STG_12th_year_of_revolution:0 "Twelfth Year Of The Revolution"
STG_12th_year_of_revolution_desc:0 "When the ponies of Severyana rose up against the exploitation, back in 995, nopony had an exact idea how far we'd come. But under the guidance of our leaders, the revolution has not only endured, but prospered as well. Stalliongrad stands as a beacon of hope for all those wishing to escape unjust conditions imposed by capitalists and autocrats. Our work is far from done, however."
STG_problems_in_party:0 "Factions In Our Ranks"
STG_problems_in_party_desc:0 "While a majority of ponies can agree that socialist thought and independence has brought more benefits than drawbacks, there is plenty of disagreement how we should proceed in the future. The revolution has not solved every problem we faced before 995, and many of our measures have been a temporary adjustment until the road can be paved for true communism to realise itself."
STG_telegraph_agency:0 "Stalliongrad Telegraph Agency"
STG_telegraph_agency_desc:0 "The party leadership certainly can't agree on everything, this is to be expected. But if the common pony were to know of our disunity, they could start losing hope in the socialist dream. Ensuring that the right information is transmitted to the public, assisted by the principle of democratic centralism, would ensure that the popular perception remains positive towards the state."
STG_commies_in_eqs:0 "Our Southern Comrades"
STG_commies_in_eqs_desc:0 "Once the revolution was successful, there was no more turning back time: similar movements rose up to prominence in Griffonia, and unconfirmed rumours suggest that even down in Zebrica there is a growing socialist population. But our focus should be closer to home - what to do with the vanguard located in Baltimare, Vanhoover, Manehattan and other major Equestrian cities?"
STG_socialism_in_one_country:0 "Socialism In One Country?"
STG_socialism_in_one_country_desc:0 "The chains must be broken, and any worker, be they pony, thestral, griffon or other deserves a decent life, their voice taken into account, to take pride in their fruits of labour. But how can Stalliongrad assist in spreading the socialist ethos abroad, if we cannot claim with certainty that the revolution is secure at home?"
STG_about_freedom_and_unity:0 "Establish The Party Line"
STG_about_freedom_and_unity_desc:0 "An idea cannot be made into reality unless it has firm convinction behind it, and the easiest way to achieve that is by having ponies vouch in its favour. The SCP, nominally representing everycreature in Severyana, is showing signs of fracture as different party officials espouse their own plans for the future. Should this varied thinking be encouraged, or should we commit to a single goal?"
STG_red_army_structure:0 "The Red Army Debate"
STG_red_army_structure_desc:0 "Our struggle for freedom was certainly bloody, but owing to the typical peaceful mindset, Stalliongrad has not faced a serious external threat since 995. But as the world situation further develops, the Red Army must be prepared to meet the challenge. For now, we must discuss and figure out its organisation and how to implement it in the near future."
STG_reminats_of_fleet:0 "Remnants Of The Royal Navy"
STG_reminats_of_fleet_desc:0 "The port of Petershoof was the location of the first uprising in 991, and it remained favourable to the ideas of revolution despite many suppressive crackdowns. As such, when the fighting continued in 995, many warships of the Equestrian Royal Navy were seized and turned against their uncaring masters. However, naval matters have rarely been given the time of the day, and we must modernise to keep up."
STG_reorganize_the_industry:0 "Industrial Buildup"
STG_reorganize_the_industry_desc:0 "Stalliongrad's stability comes from the workers, and it is our utmost duty to ensure all who have placed their hearts and minds towards a socialist future have the means of participating in it. However, resources are stretched thin and we cannot simply open a factory after factory, for obvious reasons. Several competing development plans have emerged in the SCP, and should be given a discussion."
STG_support_the_colhoz:0 "Support Collective Farms"
STG_support_the_colhoz_desc:0 "Many great and wonderful things can be achieved through simple cooperation. One of the primary tenets of Marks discusses reorganisation of privately owned farmland into a joined block, that would be provided by the state with modern tools for increased output. The mainstream thought within the SCP believes it to be a solution against further famine."
STG_draka_s_kulakami:0 "Continue Wealth Re-Distribution"
STG_draka_s_kulakami_desc:0 "Although the industrial revolution brought substantial progress and quality of life for many ponies in Equestria, it also solidified one of the greatest evils in history: capitalistic exploitation. Factory owners would glut themselves with profit while paying a pittance! The party is committed towards eliminating this injustice."
STG_scp_congress:0 "Tenth Party Congress"
STG_scp_congress_desc:0 "The SCP will once more be meeting in its official capacity, to discuss important matters of state. Most are interested, however, whether Vasily Pantsushenko's ideas for Stalliongrad will convince the various opposing factions within the party to cooperate. The winds of change might change Severyana's course, or things could remain the same. The party will make its decision."
STG_status_quo:0 "Status Quo In The Party"
STG_status_quo_desc:0 "The party has not reached agreement. The opposition has not been impressed with Vasily's speeches, and according to protocol, further debates will be held. We remain resolute that a consensus will be reached, for everypony holds a personal stake in Stalliongrad. It can and will be found."
STG_unity_in_party:0 "Unity Has Been Achieved"
STG_unity_in_party_desc:0 "Much to everypony's surprise, Comrade Vasily's proposals have each been met with the required majority needed for approval. He will certainly now rise to the position of General Secretary, and his ideas will guide and shape Stalliongrad for the time being. We all expect the glory of the revolution to remain unextinguishable, to spread wherever a worker remains oppressed and unfree."

STG_flag_status_quo:0 "The Party Lives On"
STG_flag_unity_in_party:0 "Vasily has Unified the Party"

STG_nothing_is_changed:0 "Nothing Has Changed"
STG_nothing_is_changed_desc:0 "Despite the best efforts of Vasily and his allies, the SCP is still a factionalized mess. This situation cannot go on forever, as while we bicker and argue our ponies lose confidence in us and our agricultural situation deteriorates."
STG_sysem_of_goszakaz:0 "Implement A System Of State Orders"
STG_sysem_of_goszakaz_desc:0 "The food and industrial situation is becoming too dire to let procedural correctness get in the way of a solution. Gensec Altidiya will implement a series of state orders, bypassing the Supreme Soviet and getting our economy back on track, or at least buying us a little more time."
STG_prodrazverstka:0 "Food Stocks Audit"
STG_prodrazverstka_desc:0 "We need to find out exactly how much time we have. We will send out auditors to the farms, collective and private, and to the village granaries to determine how close we are to disaster."
STG_countinue_kolhoz_support:0 "Provide Support for Collective Farms"
STG_countinue_kolhoz_support_desc:0 "All factions can agree that we need to subsidize the collective farms to secure our food supply. It is a stopgap situation, but for now it will help those in need."
STG_skaynavia_delegates:0 "Send Delegates to Skynavia"
STG_skaynavia_delegates_desc:0 "The Socialist Republic of Skynavia has finally overcome their own internal divisions, at least for the moment, and is beginning to secure their situation. We should contact these comrades across the sea, and set up trade relations with one of the few other countries in the world which share at least most of our ideals."
STG_atyldia_muhozhuk:0 "Suspicious Silence"
STG_atyldia_muhozhuk_desc:0 "General Secretary Altidiya Kobylkova has prepared a speech exhorting the SCP to find common ground. At the end of it, she will announce her plans to resign just before the next party congress, both for her health and because a GenSec election at the next congress may be the only way to shake the SCP out of its stalemate."
STG_save_revolution:0 "Save Our Revolution"
STG_save_revolution_desc:0 "The majority is either too unaware or too unwilling to stop the left faction's takeover. Our revolutionaries will storm the Supreme Soviet, dissolve Altidiya's weak government, and declare a national emergency. We will secure the revolution."
STG_fire_on_right:0 "Fire to the Right"
STG_fire_on_right_desc:0 "Dark Wing, Psychic Sigil, Karamelka Sladkova, the whole rightist faction have done nothing but stall the revolution. With the true revolutionaries in control, we will round them all up to await their trials for betraying the revolution. Some will be released, some will be expelled, some will be imprisoned or shot, but for now they will be out of the way."
STG_sinnie_purge:0 "Serov's Purge"
STG_sinnie_purge_desc:0 "Sinister knows Vasily Pantsuschenko better than anypony, and he knows that Vasily will not support a coup, no matter how righteous. For the time being, we will keep him and the other leaders of the Majority under house arrest, so that they cannot derail our course."
STG_sinnie_leatherman:0 "The Grey Cardinal"
STG_sinnie_leatherman_desc:0 "Masha Norushkina's provisional government cannot last forever. Fortunately, Sinister Serov is ready to lead the revolution. We will call an emergency party congress to appoint Sinister Serov as general secretary of Stalliongrad."
STG_time_for_breakthrough:0 "Time To Make a Breakthrough"
STG_time_for_breakthrough_desc:0 "The time of weakness and indecision is over. With our enemies absent and more and more of the majority coming over to our side, the Supreme Soviet has confirmed Sinister as our new leader. Now, the real revolutionary work begins."
STG_revolutionary_order:0 "Bring the Revolutionary Order"
STG_revolutionary_order_desc:0 "With the rightist faction out of the way, Masha and Sinister will approach Vasily Pantsuschenko to legitimate their new program in an emergency session of the SCP congress. Surely, they will see our point of view."
STG_Vasya_unity:0 "Ending the Uncertainty"
STG_Vasya_unity_desc:0 "We have dealt with the ultra-left plot, and despite being shaken by his friend's betrayal Vasily Pantsuschenko is ready to lead us forward, into a new era."
STG_time_to_offensive:0 "Time to Start the Offensive"
STG_time_to_offensive_desc:0 "The last few years have been a tumultuous time for our republic, but the SCP now stands united in purpose, galvanized by having almost lost it all. It is time to return to Steel Stallion's program, finish collectivization, and advance the cause of the worker's revolution."
STG_save_democracy:0 "Save Our Democracy"
STG_save_democracy_desc:0 "We are a socialist republic, not a military junta! With Karamelka tipped off to the plot, the rightist faction will move quickly to reshuffle garrisons and alert loyal commanders so that Masha's conspirators cannot overthrow our democracy."
STG_remove_radicals:0 "Remove The Radicals"
STG_remove_radicals_desc:0 "More and more SCP members are becoming aware of just how close we came to losing our democracy, and it is time to publicly expel Masha Norushkina and the other conspirators from the SCP and the Red Army."
STG_conspiracy_revealed:0 "The Conspiracy Is Revealed"
STG_conspiracy_revealed_desc:0 "New evidence has come to light that Vasily's former ally Sinister Serov was one of the ringleaders of the coup. He will be detained, and his role in the mutiny assessed. With him in custody, we will dispel the uncertainty in other countries and confirm that the situation is under control."

### EVENTS #####
stalliongrad.1.t:0 "Home of the Revolution"
stalliongrad.1.d:0 "When Bilon Plinth and Day Ray each wrote their vaunted works on economic theory, it would later attract the attention of two friends and colleagues, Caramel Marks and Fire Angel. They would travel across Equestria, seeking to observe how the nation was changing in the wake of the industrial revolution. What did they uncover? Systematic exploitation by an uncaring, basically slaveholding class of aristocrats, while the workers were living in misery, poverty and uncertainty.\n\nBut the two comrades against injustice would not see the results of their labour. They laid the seeds through their organisations and ideas, which would culminate in the alliance of Karamelka Sladkova and Steel Stallion. The two of them would break the stagnation and infighting that grew common within the Union of Struggle for Justice (USJ), a precursor to the modern day Stalliongrad Communist Party (SCP). Thus the following events were inevitable: the Petershoof uprising, Pastilá Strike, declaration of the Severyana Republic, the first tanks deployed in battle and ultimately, freedom and independence.\n\nWhat is left to be done? Even after twelve years, the revolution has not yet entrenched itself in Stalliongrad. Ponies, thestrals, griffons and others live in much better conditions than they ever did under Celestia, but the infighting within the SCP has grown steady over the last years, especially after the death of Steel Stallion. Various socialist movements have sprung up beyond the borders of Severyana, but very few have achieved success compared to ours. If the workers are to be liberated, and petty bourgeoisie destroyed as a class, then we have much work ahead of us."
stalliongrad.1.a:0 "Slava Revolyutsii!"

stalliongrad.2.t:0 "A Party Divided"
stalliongrad.2.d:0 "Since Steel Stallion's death, the situation in the SCP has deteriorated. While the party has become more open and democratic under Altidiya, and the worker's soviets have largely remained supportive, the party has lost its sense of purpose. The problems of trade, agriculture, and economic planning stil plague us, and though we have had twelve years to muster it, the Red Army is still hardly a mighty force.\n\nWhile the majority of the party still believes in the program set out by Steel Stallion, they frequently disagree on the specifics, and opposition factions have pointed to our failure to solve the problems brought on by the Winter Revolution as evidence that a major change of course is needed. They have grown increasingly popular both among older workers who have lost the optimism of the early days and among young socialists full of starry-eyed idealism and yearning to recapture the true spirit of revolution.\n\nWith factionalism, clashing egos, infighting and bureaucracy stymyeing efforts at implementing long-term solutions, party unity has become the number one issue. For without unity, none of the other problems can be solved, and the revolution will never be completed."
stalliongrad.2.a:0 "We must stand together, or we shall fall."

stalliongrad.10002.t:0 "Majority"
stalliongrad.10002.d:0 "The Majority is not officially a faction, but in the leadup to the Tenth Party Congress they have become tired of the infighting and are ready to move forward, rallying around a triumvirate of prominent figures to bring unity to the party.\n\nPremier Vasily Pantsushenko is the leader, and many hope that he will one day become General Secretary. Long thought of as a policymaker above factional conflict, he has come out strongly against disunity and revisionism in the party, arguing that the SCP must remember its purpose and serve the people and the revolution rather than their private interests. He has announced that he will propose an ambitious program of unity and anti-corruption measures at the next Congress.\n\nThe second figure is Gold Muffin, the Changeling revolutionary. He was also considered a figure who did not engage in factionalism, instead serving as a voice of comradeship, reconciliation, and compromise among the different factions. He is vital to holding the majority together, and creating lasting unity after the Congress should they succeed.\n\nThe final figure is the most controversial: the firebrand, Sinister Serov. A dangerous pony, many blame him for the Winter Revolution being so bloody, and he has flirted with the ultra-left opposition. However, it seems his deep friendship with Vasily has caused him to throw his support behind Vasily's program, at least for now, and his charismatic appeals have swayed many on-the-fence party members. Only time will tell if this coalition will last."

stalliongrad.11002.t:0 "The Opposition"
stalliongrad.11002.d:0 "Since Steel Stallion's death, opposition factions have formed. They vote together, consistently support each other, and frequently reopen debates which were previously closed, skirting the principle of democratic centralism and aggravating the party's indecisiveness. The main opposition factions are the rightists and the ultra-leftists. While they both agree on preserving their ability to oppose the majority and frequently vote together on administrative and procedural issues, they could not be more different in terms of their ultimate aims.\n\nThe rightists, led by the universally-respected Karamelka and the universally-despised Dark Wing, advocate consolidating the NEP and an approach of "new thinking" and "openness," whereby they would reintroduce some capitalist elements into the Stalliongrad economy and pursue a thaw in relations with Harmonist neighbours, with the goal of slowly spreading socialist ideas in Equestria. They maintain that under their program, our productive capacities and standard of living would leapfrog past Equestria, and in the long term socialism would become more popular than if we hold strictly to Marksist orthodoxy.\n\nThe ultra-left faction on the other hoof has no official leader, but is generally dominated by radical general Masha Norushkina. They argue Steel Stallion did not go far enough, and that the NEP should be immediately scrapped and collectivisation accelerated. They also advocate for massive military buildup, a drastic reduction in bureaucracy, and immediate preparation for total war with Equestria to bring the revolution by force."

stalliongrad.4.d:0 ""...Although our efforts have thus far focused on supporting comrades in Baltimare's trade unions and the socialist sailors in Vanhoover, we the undersigned believe in accordance with the principle of internationalism that more must be done. In particular, there are two major untapped populations. First, we hold that the Crystal Ponies would be receptive to us, as they feel the alienation of capitalism more acutely due to only recently being proletarianised after long existence in a pre-capitalist state."\n\n"For similar reasons, the batponies of Equestria would turn to socialism easily if given the right push. Many batponies have only recently joined the proletariat, having been displaced into the cities by primitive accumulation and facing particularly poor working conditions. While many of them cling to monarchism in the vain hope that Princess Luna will help, the last seven years of inaction have resulted in many turning to more radical voices. If we do not act soon, they will turn to reactionary nationalism or other alternative ideologies for a solution. To facilitate this, we the undersigned recommend a 20% increase in funding to the program for helping revolutionaries abroad..."\n\nAltidiya considered the proposal. It was signed not only by Masha's clique of radicals, but by several members of the majority, including Sinister Serov and Gold Muffin. It was bold, dangerous even. Karamelka had just come to her last week, suggesting that funding communists in Equestria was taking vital resources away from the people of Stalliongrad, and that "poking the Equestrian Ursa" risked an unwinnable war if our operations were discovered.\n\nVasily, for his part, had insisted that our current operations were quite secure, but that expanding to the Crystal Empire and the batponies would surely result in our discovery. As a matter of clandestine operations, the decision was Altidiya's alone to make."

stalliongrad.5.t:0 "Socialism in One Country?"
stalliongrad.5.d:0 "One of the more controversial doctrines adopted during the Altidiya years is Socialism In One Country, that is to say, the doctrine that our efforts should primarily focus on building a shining, self-sufficient socialist state in Severyana.\n\nThe ultra-lefts in particular have always opposed that move, arguing in line with classical Marksism that the revolution is international in character and that our worker's state will degenerate into state capitalism unless we rapidly spread the revolution to Equestria, at the bare minimum.\n\nThe right opposition are also skeptical, but instead argue that a period of state capitalism is actually necessary to expand the means of production and improve standards of living. All in preparation for spreading the revolution through economics, diplomacy, and force as a last resort. Still, they advocate against scrapping the policy because it clearly communicates to the world that we are not going to invade our neighbours at will.\n\nThe center is divided on the topic, with Sinister Serov largely siding with the ultra-lefts, but Vasily arguing that it is possible. He believes that the material conditions in Stalliongrad are sufficient to support, if not full communism, then at least a robust socialism, but only if we are courageous and unified in our pursuit of a better life."

stalliongrad.6.t:0 "Freedom of factions or unity?"
stalliongrad.6.d:0 "The SCP runs on the principle of democratic centralism, meaning that issues are to be vigorously debated and voted on but then considered closed: once the party has made a decision, it behooves all representatives of the party to support that decision, or to resign. This allows us to maintain democracy and make good decisions, but also to move forward with unity and purpose. "Freedom of Debate, Unity of Action," in theory.\n\nIn practice, the emergence of factions within the party undermines the efficacy of this principle. Party members privately dissent from policies they already had a chance to contest publicly, then those dissensions find their way to the press and chip away at even the appearance of unity. Debates are reopened again and again each time a faction thinks it can win.\n\nVasily's ally Sinister Serov has argued that if this principle is to mean anything, we must take steps to curtail factionalism. While it is too soon to ban factions outright, the general secretary can release an official statement condemning division and factionalism within the SCP, and institute new rules of order within the Supreme Soviet to better enforce democratic centralism. The ultra-leftist and rightist factions have both objected that these rules will stifle the freedom of debate within the party and lead to rigidity and dogmatism, to which Vasily retorted that they would not have been necessary if the factions had not made them necessary with their ceaseless infighting."

stalliongrad.9.d:0 "Adding new members to the Politburo is always cause for debate, and often the Supreme Soviet will argue for weeks before settling on somepony to fill a vacancy. With Vasily Pantsushenko taking an increasingly active role in party politics, he has announced that he will resign as People's Commissar for Industrial Planning. This surprised many, who expected him to keep his role as it provided him considerable influence, but Vasily insisted that for the good of the people, he had to allow somepony else to fill the role who has more time to devote to it.\n\nHis ally Gold Muffin has suggested Konzan University engineering professor Alevtina Qubysheva as his replacement. She has only ever dabbled in politics, but seems to be a forceful advocate of central planning and prioritizing high-tech industries as the core of Stalliongrad's economic progress.\n\nThe right opposition has put forward their own candidate, a more well-known pony named Psychic Sigil who was responsible for the most succcessful parts of the NEP, and has since played a major role in developing our armaments industry. Whoever is chosen will have a big task ahead of them, as Stalliongrad's industry grows larger and more complicated by the day, and coordinating it all is quickly becoming a monumental task."

stalliongrad.10.d:0 "Although the NEP allowed market forces into the agricultural sector, the core of our food supply comes from collective farms. These farms have had difficulty meeting quotas, and between the Equestrian embargo and the loss of our most arable land in the revolution, food insecurity has been a constant problem. While we have not had a true famine yet, the People's Commissariat of Agriculture reports that we are perhaps one bad winter away from one.\n\nAccordingly, the party voted at the 1004 SCP Congress to prioritise the production of agricultural machinery. Now we must decide where to distribute these combine harvesters, tractors, and other equipment. Vasily suggests that we send the majority out to the collective farms, and if the private farms want them, they can buy them from the state. This will cause more farmers to embrace collectivisation and generate state revenue.\n\nThe opposition argue that now is not the time to play favourites and that we should ship the machinery out to all our farmers. Many suspect the left opposition has sided with the rightists on this because of some deal, or because they see no need to encourage collectivisation through economics when they plan to do it by force."

Vasily waited as Altidiya officially opened the tenth party Congress, barely hearing her words as his mind raced with what could go wrong. He almost didn't hear when the General Secretary announced it was time for him to propose his first resolution.\n\nIt had taken so much effort to get Vasily's anti-corruption resolution to the top of the list, but Vasily knew it would be worth it. This would allow him to set the tone for the entire Congress. Stepping up to the podium, he began:\n"Comrades, I am not going to mince words. The Party is in distress. I have long spoken out against factionalism, this you all know, but today I would like to begin with something that unites us all: the duty of every representative of the SCP to serve the interests of the people and the revolution, rather than their private interests."\n\n"It is precisely the temptation to profit off of their offices which turns factionalism from a healthy part of party democracy into a source of deadlock. Therefore, I propose a new set of countermeasures to ensure that every official be subject to proper performance evaluations, and that corruption be dealt with swiftly and conclusively."\n\nAfter a few minutes of clarifying questions from Karamelka, the vote was called, and the resolution passed easily."

Comrade Sladkova, your efforts kept us from famine, and brought the prosperity you have always believed we needed before creating socialism. For that, we thank you."\n\nVasily glanced at Masha's crowd. Good. Sinister was where he was supposed to be, keeping the batpony distracted so she couldn't rally her faction to denounce Muffin as a revisionist or whatever insult she thought of for somecreature with something good to say about the NEP. Muffin finished his speech. As expected, Karamelka Sladkova got up to argue against him.\n\n"Thank you, comrade Muffin, for your kind words. However, I argue that we have not achieved the prosperity necessary to go forward with collectivisation. As Comrade Muffin said, the NEP generates prosperity and security, increasing median real income yearly since its adoption and limiting inflation. Why should we throw it away?"\n\nVasily relaxed. Of course, Karamelka would argue against it, but he could already feel her losing the delegates as she got into dry economic data, sounding more like a bourgeois economist by the moment. Sinister was joking around with some of the delegates, and it was clear Karamelka wouldn't be able to stop it. When the vote came, even some of the rightists voted in favour of phasing out the NEP."

I stayed out of politics, I didn’t want to get involved."\n\nKaramelka put her hoof in front of him, stopping his pacing. "Major Morozov. I know you are not a stallion of intrigue, I trust you, what is going on?"\n\nThe pegasus sighed and threw the folder onto the desk, "Three days ago I was contacted by general Masha asking for her help in a plot. She has made a pact with Sinister Serov to overthrow the government at the next Congress. She wanted my unit to play a role, so I said yes to get out of the conversation. I knew I had to tell someone, I know you’re the only one Sinister would never be able to get on side. I’ll do whatever you need me to. Just stop Sinister. I don’t know how he bent Masha’s leg, but we can’t let this happen."\n\nKaramelka took everything in, and laughed internally. It was just like the days of the revolution. But it seemed this time she was on the other end of things. "Of course, thank you for your help.""
stalliongrad.30.a:0 "We must stop this."

stalliongrad.31.t:0 "Dusk to Dawn"
stalliongrad.31.d:0 "Masha looked over the plans in front of her. The maneuvers for the day of reckoning, when she would finally save the revolution. Everything was in place. The Red Guards would enter the Congress building, the shock troops would secure the important government buildings. Sinister would make his speech, and everything would go as planned. There was just the issue of-\n\n"Masha..." the thestral looked up to see Major Morozov standing in the doorway. The stallion stared her dead in the eyes with an expression like steel. What was going on? "There's a visitor for you." Before Masha could respond, Morozov stepped out of the way, revealing Karamelka Sladkova.\n\nThe General spoke with aprehension, "Comrade Sladkova, it's a surprise to see you." Masha shifted slightly, she didn't know what was going on, and she began to move for where she kept her hidden pistol.\n\n"It's not a surprise to see you, General. And don't bother looking for your weapon, it's not there." Masha's eyes widened and her heart sank when she realized what had happened. The coup had been sold out, and she had no way to fight back. As Masha froze, Karamelka walked over and put a hoof on her shoulder, "I'm sorry child. Your zeal got the better of you." Before turning around to the door, "Comrade Flyagin, place Masha Norushkina under arrest."\n\nAnd as Masha was put into a car outside her building, she could only wonder how it all went so wrong."
stalliongrad.31.a:0 "At least no blood was spilled tonight."

stalliongrad.32.t:0 "A New Motion"
stalliongrad.32.d:0 ""Order! Order! I call order to this congress!" Gold Muffin bellowed from his podium before the Supreme Soviet. The timid and reserved changeling let his voice out for the first time in many months to calm the chaos of the chamber. Delegates stood, not taking their seats, and whispered to one another, it was complete anarchy. "I will not have this congress devolve into chaos!"\n\nSinister Serov rose and shouted above the murmuring, "This congress will achieve order once we find out what happened to General Norushkina! We cannot have officers of the state disappearing with no action from the administration!"\n\nGold Muffin began to lose patience, but then, out of the corner of his eye, he saw Karamelka enter the chamber. Finally, this torture could end. He despised acting like this to the congress, and especially his friend Sinister. Or, what was once his friend. Karamelka looked the changeling in the eyes and nodded.\n\nMuffin took in a deep breath, and bellowed as loud as his voice would allow him, "Silence!" Waiting for the room to become quiet, he continued, "I believe Comrade Sladkova has something to say." Muffin looked from Sladkova to Sinister. Sinister wasn't looking back. His eyes were trained on Karamelka, an unnatural focus consuming him. His plot couldn't proceed without Masha, but he didn't know it was all over already.\n\nKaramelka stood from her seat and cleared her voice, "I would like to present a motion on the condemnation of the conduct of Comrade Serov." On queue, the left wing of the hall erupted. Sinister himself soon rose and fired back, "Doing the wishes of Dark Wing now are you? I thought this nonsense was his job!"\n\n"Seconded!"\n\nThe hall went silent, as all eyes looked to Gold Muffin. He never approved motions before, so all knew something was afoot. Karamelka smirked as horror set in on Serov's face, "I formally charge Sinister Serov with collaboration with and participation in a military coup against the Communist Party, I charge him with anti-socialist behavior-" By now the yelling in the hall was getting louder, with left delegates trying to snuff out Karamelka's cries. "With working with the traitorous General Masha Norushkina, and with plotting to destroy the revolution! And I declare you under arrest!"\n\nOn queue with the finishing of her speech, Gold Muffin sighed, and pressed the button under his podium. The next few minutes were a blur as Morozov's soldiers stormed the hall and arrested the plotters, but Muffin couldn't stop thinking about how it all came to this."
stalliongrad.32.a:0 "Where did he lose his way?"

stalliongrad.33.t:0 "An Old Comrade"
stalliongrad.33.d:0 "Gold Muffin, Chaircreature of the Supreme Soviet, normally didn't have much actual power. He had a lot of soft power, everypony liked him except for a few hardliners, but he wasn't in charge of any serious portfolio. But for what Karamelka was about to do, the Changeling Revolutionary was vital.\n\nShe needed somepony - or someling, in his case - who was seen as unimpeachable, not part of the rightist faction and only vaguely associated with the center. And as chair of the Supreme Soviet, Muffin could second her motion to arrest Sinister from a position where everypony would listen.\n\nKaramelka made no appeals. She just gave Muffin her dossier and waited. Muffin's compound eyes betrayed nothing, but the slight quivering of his jaw told her everything she needed to know. He believed her.\n\n"I..." Muffin began, "I wish it hadn't come to this. I really thought... Oh Karamelka, is there any way this is a misunderstanding?"\n"I'm afraid not."\n"I knew Sinister was trouble, but I really thought..." he took a drink of water, and then looked at her with a pleading expression. "I know what I have to do, but... Sinister... I don't want to. Is there any other way?"\n"I suppose you could talk to him."\nMuffin laughed bitterly.\n\n"No, you're right. Talk never worked for Sinister. I really thought that between Vasily and me, if he just had some good friends who really cared about him... but no, Sinister Serov is Sinister Serov. He won't change, and he won't back down.""

Sticking out to sea early, and rising through the ranks thanks to a lack of officers in the ranks, Neon has been attracted to the concept of the carrier and has wedded her career to them. This has brought her into conflict with Karina, another admiral in the navy who has another view. However, for her kind, Neon remains firmly convinced of both her own supremacy.\n\nSome might say she has some non-revolutionary habits like her love of wine and cocoa...but never to her face."

# central branch #

STG_12th_year_of_revolution:0 "Twelfth Year Of The Revolution"
STG_12th_year_of_revolution_desc:0 "When the ponies of Severyana rose up against the exploitation back in 995, nopony had an exact idea how far we'd come. Since then, the revolution has not only endured, but prospered as well. For more than 12 years Stalliongrad stands as a beacon of hope, shining for all those wishing to escape unjust conditions imposed by capitalists or 'harmonic' autocrats. Our work is far from done, however."
STG_problems_in_party:0 "Factions In Our Ranks"
STG_problems_in_party_desc:0 "While most agree that having many opinions on building socialism has brought more benefits than drawbacks, there is plenty of disagreement on how we should proceed. The revolution has not solved every problem we faced before 995, and many of our current measures have been a temporary adjustment until the road can be paved for actual socialism."
STG_socialism_program:0 "The Socialist Program"
STG_socialism_program_desc:0 "rewrite the event following this focus"
STG_cominform:0 "Parties from Around the World"
STG_cominform_desc:0 "Communism is an international movement, and it seems our movement is finally catching on. We will begin sending out envoys to other Marksist, Marksist-Stallionist and Revolutionary Socialist parties to organise a conference to discuss and coordinate our efforts. Perhaps this could be the start of a true Communist International?"
STG_skynavia_kekw:0 "Visit to Skynavia"
STG_skynavia_kekw_desc:0 "The Skynavians may be unorthodox, and they may be tiny, but they are worth reaching out to. Who knows, perhaps they will have something interesting to say..."
STG_prywhen_why:0 "Assist Prywhen"
STG_prywhen_why_desc:0 "The Prywhenians have been fighting a protacted war for years against the tyrant King Kloseau, and while we know very little of what is going on there, we must send what aid we can to our comrades across the seas."
STG_Zebrica_4head:0 "The White Sun of Arabia"
STG_Zebrica_4head_desc:0 "Civil war has broken out in the once powerful state of Saddle Arabia. If the Arabian Popular Front can win, we will gain a powerful ally. We must send what aid we can to our comrades in Zebrica."
STG_only_thing_we_all_agree_on:0 "The Only Thing We All Agree On"
STG_only_thing_we_all_agree_on_desc:0 "The Only Thing We All Agree On"

# right branch #

STG_peasants_and_workers:0 "The Peasants and the Workers"
STG_peasants_and_workers_desc:0 "#Write about the necessity of the joint efforts of laborers in the city and in the countryside"
STG_peasants_and_workers_tt:0 "#Unlocks unplanned profit decisions"
STG_petershoof_foreign_trade:0 "Open Petershoof for Foreign Trade"
STG_petershoof_foreign_trade_desc:0 "While the Equestrian blockade remains in place, our policy of Socialism in One Country has nonetheless born some fruit in that most other states no longer regard us as a pariah-state or dangerous zealots. Thus, we can now open the port of Petershoof to foreign trade, bringing in goods from Zebrica and Griffonia."
STG_amogus_trade:0 "Equestrian Shell Companies"
STG_amogus_trade_desc:0 "We maintain several shell companies and front operations within Equestria, working to siphon small funds back to Severyana and provide intelligence for our future operations. After years of buildup, we are ready to reap the benefits of these operations."
STG_telegraph_agency:0 "Stalliongrad Telegraph Agency"
STG_telegraph_agency_desc:0 "The party leadership certainly can't agree on everything, this is to be expected. But if the common pony were to know of our disunity, they could start losing hope in the socialist dream. Ensuring that the right information is transmitted to the public, assisted by the principle of democratic centralism, would ensure that the popular perception remains positive towards the state."
STG_state_warehouse_system:0 "State Reserve System"
STG_state_warehouse_system_desc:0 "Despite the current hardships, we must prepare for harder times still. The twin specters of war and hunger never sleep, and so we have organised a network of state-owned warehouses dotting the countryside, only to be opened when those specters again appear."
STG_support_the_colhoz:0 "Support Collective Farms"
STG_support_the_colhoz_desc:0 "Many great and wonderful things can be achieved through simple cooperation. One of the primary tenets of Marks discusses reorganisation of privately owned farmland into a joined block, that would be provided by the state with modern tools for increased output. The mainstream thought within the SCP believes it to be a solution against further famine."
STG_draka_s_kulakami:0 "Continue Wealth Redistribution"
STG_draka_s_kulakami_desc:0 "Although the industrial revolution brought substantial progress and quality of life for many ponies in Equestria, it also solidified one of the greatest evils in history: capitalistic exploitation. Factory owners would glut themselves with profit while paying a pittance! The party is committed towards eliminating this injustice."
STG_another_year_of_stability:0 "Another Year of Stability"
STG_another_year_of_stability_desk:0 "Despite the factionalism within our ranks, the people of Stalliongrad can see that progress is being made and that the SCP's rule has brought relative stability. Slowly but surely we are coming together, and that in itself is worth celebrating."

# left branch #

STG_about_freedom_and_unity:0 "Establish The Party Line"
STG_about_freedom_and_unity_desc:0 "An idea cannot be made into reality unless it has firm convinction behind it, and the easiest way to achieve that is by having ponies vouch in its favour. The SCP, nominally representing everycreature in Severyana, is showing signs of fracture as different party officials espouse their own plans for the future. Should this varied thinking be encouraged, or should we commit to a single goal?"
STG_doubters_on_left:0 "Should We Go Faster?"
STG_doubters_on_left_desc:0 "#Masha, slow down a bit and work as everybody else"
STG_reliable_center:0 "Following Stallion's Way"
STG_reliable_center_desc:0 "#Stallion told us what to do, he was smart and studied mommy Marks, mommy always knows best"
STG_send_in_sosister:0 "Renovate The Party Control Committee"
STG_send_in_sosister_desc:0 "#time to re-register the party members, Sinister is a good boy, he can handle it"
STG_pessimists_on_right:0 "Remind about Deviations"
STG_pessimists_on_right_desc:0 "#Stallion didn't tolerate deviations. Karamelka is a cool waifu, but Stallion opposed her views on our revolution, and DW basically wants to sell our independence to Celestia for vague plan of building socialism hoof-by-hoof with literally monarch"
STG_can_there_be_unity:0 "Can There be Unity?"
STG_can_there_be_unity_desc:0 "#let's not forget that we shall prevail only if we are united, that's what Stallion has decreed"

# final focus of the starting tree #

STG_scp_congress:0 "Tenth Party Congress"
STG_scp_congress_desc:0 "The SCP will once more be meeting in its official capacity, to discuss important matters of state. Most are interested, however, whether Vasiliy Wheatin's ideas for Stalliongrad will convince the various opposing factions within the party to cooperate. The winds of change might change Severyana's course, or things could remain the same. The party will make its decision."

# Outcome of the Congress #

STG_status_quo:0 "Status Quo In The Party"
STG_status_quo_desc:0 "The party has not reached agreement. The opposition has not been impressed with Vasiliy's speeches, and according to protocol, further debates will be held. We remain resolute that a consensus will be reached, for everypony holds a personal stake in Stalliongrad. It can and will be found."
STG_unity_in_party:0 "Unity Has Been Achieved"
STG_unity_in_party_desc:0 "Much to everypony's surprise, Comrade Vasiliy's proposals have each been met with the required majority needed for approval. He will certainly now rise to the position of General Secretary, and his ideas will guide and shape Stalliongrad for the time being. We all expect the glory of the revolution to remain unextinguishable, to spread wherever a worker remains oppressed and unfree."

#STG_socialism_in_one_country:0 "Socialism In One Country?"
#STG_socialism_in_one_country_desc:0 "The chains must be broken, and any worker, be they pony, thestral, griffon or other deserves a decent life, their voice taken into account, to take pride in their fruits of labour. But how can Stalliongrad assist in spreading the socialist ethos abroad, if we cannot claim with certainty that the revolution is secure at home?"

#STG_reorganize_the_industry:0 "Industrial Buildup"
#STG_reorganize_the_industry_desc:0 "Stalliongrad's stability comes from the workers, and it is our utmost duty to ensure all who have placed their hearts and minds towards a socialist future have the means of participating in it. However, resources are stretched thin and we cannot simply open a factory after factory, for obvious reasons. Several competing development plans have emerged in the SCP, and should be given a discussion."
#STG_commission_of_inner_policy:0 "Inner Policy Commission"
#STG_commission_of_inner_policy_desc:0 "The principle of democratic centralism has gone unenforced in practice for some time now. While we cannot yet put an end to factionalism, we can clarify some internal policies to make it very clear which issues have already been decided."

STG_end_of_discussions:0 "End Of Discussions"
STG_end_of_discussions_desc:0 "The last years of disunity show the need to return to the strict democratic centralism of Steel Stallion, rather than the watered-down version practiced under Altidiya. Issues will be discussed through proper party-state channels, and once a decision has been reached, any party member dissenting will be suspended.

STG_something_terrible_desc:0 "When we learned about the Changeling’s attempted coup in 1002, it hardly provoked a reaction. Replacing one tyrant with another means nothing for the proletariat and working ponies. However, now their tanks roll across Equestrian lands in an unstoppable charge. Once they conquer the lands of Celestia, we will surely be next. What is our stance on the war?"

STG_severyana_at_war_desc:0 "#Despite our disagreements, we decided to side with Equestria. We can come to agreement with Celestia.

STG_joint_military_production:0 "Establish Allied Industry Committee"
STG_joint_military_production_desc:0 "Severyana is a powerful industrial nation but needs Equestria's immense ponypower. However, if we don’t cooperate with our harmonious allies, we will be sending them bullets when they don’t have guns. Once we establish a joint committee, Celestia will have tracks for every tank and shells for every cannon."
STG_joint_equipment_designers:0 "Unified Tank Program"
STG_joint_equipment_designers_desc:0 "Tanks! A Severyana classic now brought to Equestria in full force. Ponies are producing more tanks across Equus than ever before in history. If we want to use them efficiently, we need to gather the greatest minds that Ponykind can offer to develop the ideal tank and blunt Chrysalis’s spearhead."
STG_joint_resources_research:0 "Together Through Rocks and Stones"
STG_joint_resources_research_desc:0 "Industry means nothing if we don’t have steel for guns, aluminum for planes, and tungsten for anti-tank shells. Mining communities across Equus are more important than ever! We shall gather our most experienced miners and place them in the richest regions of our nations, mining the resources we desperately need."
STG_establish_joint_partisan_movement:0 "Organize the Resistance"
STG_establish_joint_partisan_movement_desc:0 "Every city and every village occupied by the fascist regime gives birth to resistance fighters inspired by the first-hand experience with Changeling brutality. However, they are disorganized, scattered, and inexperienced. If we can organize a center for working with the partisans and coordinating their efforts with our military, we can create an irregular fighting force that disrupts the Changeling's every move."
STG_technologies_exchange:0 "Expand Industrial Cooperation"
STG_technologies_exchange_desc:0 "The factories of Ponykind are clogged with orders from every army and is only able to supply each one with a fraction of what they need. By streamlining the process and making the factories more efficient, we can ensure that each pony has what they need. The brave workers will have to work harder, but more sweat in the factory means less blood on the battlefield."
STG_air_bases_building:0 "Prepare Bases for Strategic Bombings"
STG_air_bases_building_desc:0 "The air war has been largely defensive, establishing air superiority across the front and intercepting bombers that fly over Equestrian industrial centers. By creating long-range bombers and placing them in carefully placed airfields, we can flip the roles and send Severyan bombers into the Changeling’s heartland. Their industry will soon slow down and crawl as we reduce factories to rubble."
STG_cracking_the_enigma:0 "Crack Their Secrets"
STG_cracking_the_enigma_desc:0 "Changelings are biologically ideal for espionage, and Chrysalis has used that to her advantage. Spies, infiltration companies, and advanced ciphers have been a consistent problem throughout the war. However, ponies, if nothing else, are diligent creatures. If we collect a force of skilled ponies, we can crack any cipher they have."

STG_red_army_structure:0 "The Red Army Debate"
STG_red_army_structure_desc:0 "Our struggle for freedom was certainly bloody, but owing to the typical peaceful mindset, Stalliongrad has not faced a serious external threat since 995. But as the world situation further develops, the Red Army must be prepared to meet the challenge. For now, we must discuss and figure out its organisation and how to implement it in the near future."
STG_reminats_of_fleet:0 "Remnants Of The Royal Navy"
STG_reminats_of_fleet_desc:0 "The port of Petershoof was the location of the first uprising in 991, and it remained favourable to the ideas of revolution despite many suppressive crackdowns. As such, when the fighting continued in 995, many warships of the Equestrian Royal Navy were seized and turned against their uncaring masters. However, naval matters have rarely been given the time of the day, and we must modernise to keep up."

STG_sysem_of_goszakaz_desc:0 "The food and industrial situation is becoming too dire to let procedural correctness get in the way of a solution.

STG_skaynavia_delegates_desc:0 "The Socialist Republic of Skynavia has finally overcome their own internal divisions, at least for the moment, and is beginning to secure their situation.

STG_atyldia_muhozhuk_desc:0 "General Secretary Altidiya Kobylkova has prepared a speech exhorting the SCP to find common ground.

STG_NEP_folding:0 "Scrap the NEP"
STG_NEP_folding_desc:0 "The small businessponies, proto-capitalists all, have had their fun. It is time we scrap the reactionary mistake that was the NEP, and send its beneficiaries them back into the proletariat where they belong."
STG_pcdi:0 "The People's Commissariat of Defence Industry"
STG_pcdi_desc:0 "The hybrid system of the NEP and endless compromises in the local Soviets meant an unnecessary number of planning committies, commissariats, and ministries. Too much red tape, exemplified by the eight separate offices handling war production. We will amalgamate what is necessary from these offices into the People's Commissariat of Defence Industry, and abolish the rest."
STG_massive_investments_in_magic_industry:0 "Kickstart Magical Industry"
STG_massive_investments_in_magic_industry_desc:0 "Bourgeois understandings of magic relegate it to a privileged class of trained unicorns, a remnant old aristocracies. A revolutionary theory of magic places it at the heart of the industrial process, practiced by the whole of the people and applied to every possible benefit to the worker's state. With industrial planning finally centralised, we can make the necessary investments to put this theory into practice."
STG_investments_in_crystal_mining:0 "Expand Crystal Mining"
STG_investments_in_crystal_mining:0 "Severyana is not like the Crystal Empire, where magical crystals can be collected right off the ground. Our crystals are fragile and deep underground, require careful and expensive mining operations to extract, but we will soon have great need of them."
STG_sinisters_design_bureau:0 "Expand Seroye Design Bureau"
STG_sinisters_design_bureau_desc:0 "Before the revolution, Sinister Serov was an amateur inventor with a particular interest in magical contraptions. His blueprints have since been refined by his old comrades at Seroye Design Bureau, scaling up from backyard experiments to a magical weapons testing facility. It's time to scale up again."
STG_first_profits_of_magic_industry:0 "Lay the Foundations"
STG_first_profits_of_magic_industry_desc:0 "The first magic-enhanced assembly lines are ready for activation.

STG_radio_for_everypony:0 "Expand the Radio Industry"
STG_radio_for_everypony_desc:0 "Magical production methods are particularly beneficial for the telecommunications industry, and have resulted in a surplus of radios. We will distribute these to our population, so that every single pony will have the voice of the revolution in their homes."
STG_second_profits_of_magic_energy:0 "Flip the Switch"
STG_second_profits_of_magic_energy_desc:0 "Our first forays into magical industry have been a huge success. It is time to roll out these technologies en masse to our military-industrial sector. Stalliongrad will crackle with the magic of industry!"
STG_massive_investments_after_grf:0 "Fine-Tune the Machine"
STG_massive_investments_after_grf_desc:0 "A factory is a machine of machines, an industry is a machine of factories. Just as the first line of automobiles rolled off the assembly lines gives a machinist data to fine-tune their machine, completing our first major war has given us the data we need to fine-tune our military-industrial complex as a whole."
STG_massive_investments_after_cry:0 "Open the Floodgates"

STG_revolution_waits_for_nobody_desc:0 "A true revolutionary does not wait for the workers to rise on their own: a true revolutionary strikes the moment they are able, to inspire the workers through their deeds and shake the foundations of capitalismwith their courage.

STG_war_to_end_all_wars_desc:0 "Capital is the root of all war. It demands war, both to profit from it and to destroy international solidarity.

STG_sicklestroke:0 "Operation Sicklestroke"
STG_sicklestroke_desc:0 "We will target the tendons and veins of the Equestrian war machine. Cut off their raw materials with naval strikes to New Mareland and Baltimare, striking where they thought they were safe, then watch the body wither and die."
STG_heart_thrust:0 "Operation Heartbreaker"
STG_heart_thrust_desc:0 "We will target the soft underbelly of the Equestrian war machine. By seizing their source of magical crystals, we'll be able to fuel a new generation of magical warfare and open up a vast northern front. The crystal ponies, newly suffering under the yoke of capitalism, will surely welcome us as liberators!"
STG_hammerblow:0 "Operation Hammerblow"

STG_rain_fire:0 "Rain Fire on Them"
STG_rain_fire_desc:0 "Every blow struck against Equestria's industry is a blow against capitalism. Every factory that goes up in flames is a beacon of hope to the workers. Let our bombers be the revolution's harbingers."
STG_provisional_governments:0 "Set Up Provisional Governments"
STG_provisional_governments_desc:0 "The first few months after a liberation are the most important. If we provide rations, law and order, and representation in the form of provisional Soviets in the major cities then the newly-liberated workers will become model revolutionaries. If not, they will fall to reactionary propaganda and see us as nothing but invaders."
STG_holding_the_line:0 "Holding the Line"
STG_holding_the_line_desc:0 "Now that we have made our move, Equestria prepares a counterattack. We will move in prefabricated pillboxes and millions of landmines to turn our new holdings into fortresses. Even obsolete tank turrets will be made into fortifications."
STG_by_other_means:0 "Politics By Other Means"
STG_by_other_means_desc:0 "Sinister Serov has no interest in playing queenmaker to any changeling tyrant, returned sorcerer-king, or other despot. Now that our primary war aim is achieved, we will make a truce with the Equestrians and focus on the continental threat. We know it won't last. They know it won't last. But the political situation may just force their hooves."

 STG_dark_wing_wins:0 "Farewell to Sladkaya"
 STG_dark_wing_wins_desc:0 "Karamelka overplayed her hoof when dealing with the ultraleftists, and her faction rebelled against her as a result. Dark Wing now stands ready to take up the premiership, and ensure that the ultraleftists never again threaten Severyana."
 STG_cleaning_up_politicial_arena:0 "Cleaning up the politicial arena"
 STG_cleaning_up_politicial_arena_desc:0 "With the madness of the last months, Severyana was brought to the brink. It cannot be just left there, but must be actively pulled back from madness and towards sanity. Unlike Karamelka, Dark Wing does not plan let this be a half measure."
 STG_stavropon_congress:0 "Stavropon Congress"
 STG_stavropon_congress_desc:0 "The SCP tore itself apart in its power struggles, and it is clear that it has gone unchallenged for too long. To ensure that the political arena is opened up enough to let select critical voices in, the presidium will for a grand conference in Stavropon, one attended by exclusively non-delegates. Let the rest of Severyana be heard."
 STG_open_hoof_equestria:0 "An Open Hoof to Equestria"
 STG_open_hoof_equestria_desc:0 "The separation from Equestria was bloody and traumatic for all parties involved, yet for that very reason it must be viewed soberly. What other ruler would have given the concessions Celestia did? What other leader gave their subjects so many centuries of stability? Forgiving and forgetting are two different things, especially when the other party has proven herself."
 STG_enshrining_military_neutrality:0 "Enshrining Military Neutrality"
 STG_enshrining_military_neutrality_desc:0 "The fact that high ranking officers participated in the coup is a stain of the worst kind on the Severyanian military. It must be thoroughly reviewed, and those who sympathize with the coup attempt must be relived of command."
 STG_strength_right_wing:0 "Strengthening the Right Wing of the party"
 STG_strength_right_wing_desc:0 "If the new government is going to be stable enough, it needs to have the right ponies in the right places. Thankfully, the ongoing reorganisation means there's plenty of openings that need to be filled."
 STG_expelling_the_ultras:0 "Expelling the Ultras"
 STG_expelling_the_ultras_desc:0 "The ultraleftists should not, can not, be viewed as merely one political faction. They proved this when blood ran in Stalliongrad's streets, and with the government reorganised, we are in a position where we can ensure they will never again be a serious political force."
 STG_issue_of_liberalisaton:0 "The issue of Liberalisation"
 STG_issue_of_liberalisaton_desc:0 "Severyana fought for freedom during the revolution, but this revolution left too many with continued economic instability, a government that did not tolerate most dissidence and a lot of high-minded talk of a new Severyanian pony. The question has been raised what this freedom actually is supposed to mean."
 STG_issue_of_industry:0 "The issue of Industry"
 STG_issue_of_industry_desc:0 "Though Marksism was born from industrialism and the issues this spawned, Severyana remains lacking. Lack of trade, political interference and a laundry list of other issues has left us economically crippled. Instead of asking yet more ideologues and firebrands what should be done, we will ask the factory managers and civil servants."
 STG_declaration_the_231:0 "The Declaration of the 231"
 STG_declaration_the_231_desc:0 "With the congress coming to a close, the participants have issued a public statement of their intentions and desires and they have done so without the input of the presidium or the SCP. What they say is their desire, free of SCP dogma and representing Severyana in a way the party haven't been able to."
 STG_a_royal_visit:0 "A Royal Visit"
 STG_a_royal_visit_desc:0 "Canterlot has responded to our overtures, and Princess Twilight Sparkle - untainted by the events of the revolution or the historical actions of Nightmare Moon - will head the delegation travelling to Stalliongrad to meet with Dark Wing and the Presidium."
 STG_the_severyana_equestrian_accords:0 "The Severyana-Equestrian Accords"
 STG_the_severyana_equestrian_accords_desc:0 "The accords are signed, and Severyana is aligning itself once again with Equestria. What once was unthinkable is now a reality. Yet even as some celebrate and some rage, Dark Wing and his closest advisors know that their efforts are only just beginning. They are after all friends with Equestria again, and surely friends can talk politics?"
 STG_three_betterments:0 "The Three Betterments"
 STG_three_betterments_desc:0 "Dark Wing's plan for Severyana does not concern itself with massive military projects or grand propaganda constructions, instead formulating the vision for how Severyana and Equestria shall progress around three principles: A better industry, a better system and a better tomorrow."
 STG_a_better_industry:0 "A Better Industry"
 STG_a_better_industry_desc:0 "Industrialisation is the engine that has driven the emergence of the modern world, and it changes every day. Severyana puts pride in its industry, but she must also be humble and always accept that they can do more, do different, do better."
 STG_implemented_incrementalism:0 "Implemented Incrementalism"
 STG_implemented_incrementalism_desc:0 "Development does not happen in singular great leaps, but rather small steps each day, sometimes so tiny that it is only afterwards that you see the effect it had. This idea of small, incremental improvement must be held up as the most important doctrine for all of us."
 STG_gearinite_principles:0 "Gearinite Principles"
 STG_gearinite_principles_desc:0 "The Gearin siblings have struggled to have their ideas acknowledged by the Severyanian government. Thankfully, Dark Wing has listened to them from the start, and their technocratic ideas are now becoming the state doctrine of the new, modern Severyana."
 STG_severyanian_polytechic_institute:0 "The Severyanian Polytechnic Institute"
 STG_severyanian_polytechic_institute_desc:0 "This venerable institution has languished in recent years, and restoring it to its former glory is of utmost importance for the new Severyana. If she is to lead the way into the future, she must have the know-how to achieve it."
 STG_three_legs_of_industry:0 "Three Legs of Industry"
 STG_three_legs_of_industry_desc:0 "Industry is not a director yelling orders from behind a desk, nor is it a government calling for more factories. Industry is the united efforts of a government, of industrialists and of workers come together for a greater whole, and none of these parts can be forgotten."
 STG_the_great_eastern_line:0 "The Great Eastern Line"
 STG_the_great_eastern_line_desc:0 "With the revolution, the train connections between Severyana and Equestria were strangled, and the veins of commerce died. To ensure proper integration into the greater Equestrian whole, Severyana and Equestria will rebuild and expand the train lines along the eastern coast."
 STG_new_model_industry_and_commerce:0 "New Model Industry and Commerce"
 STG_new_model_industry_and_commerce_desc:0 "The industrial revolution may well be described as just one of several paradigm shifts. History is nowhere close to finished, and the modern theories of industry already give suggestions for what the new paradigms will become after this one."
 STG_harmonic_technocracy:0 "Harmonic Technocracy"
 STG_harmonic_technocracy_desc:0 "If the experts are to be called upon to take charge of industry, we risk creating an oligarchic elite, not too different from the Duma. The harmonic principles such as friendship, kindness and honesty are more than just words however, they may well be the antidote we need for this."
 STG_lsix_pioneers_in_griffonia:0 "Large Scale Industrial Experiments: The Pioneers of Griffonia"
 STG_lsix_pioneers_in_griffonia_desc:0 "Severyana's model of industry is controversial, but it can be implemented beyond Severyana's borders. Thankfully, the government of New Mareland has been open to the idea of allowing Severyana to set up experimental industries oversea."
 STG_lsix_the_old_heartland:0 "Large Scale Industrial Experiments: The Old Heartland"
 STG_lsix_the_old_heartland_desc:0 "Severyana's model of industry is controversial, but it can be implemented beyond Severyana's borders. There is a strong symbolism in the idea of implementing these ideas in Equestria itself, indeed it is a vindication o Marks' struggle."
 STG_lsix_the_empire_of_crystals:0 "Large Scale Industrial Experiments: The Empire of Crystals"
 STG_lsix_the_empire_of_crystals_desc:0 "Severyana's model of industry is controversial, but it can be implemented beyond Severyana's borders. The Crystal Empire, recently returned after many centuries, is still reeling in this new world, and Severyana can help the crystal ponies avoid being entirely subsumed into capitalism."
 STG_the_severyanian_model_region:0 "The Severyanian Model Region"
 STG_the_severyanian_model_region_desc:0 "Severyana is more than merely an autonomous region of Equestria. It is a model region that shows how the synthesis of socialism and harmony can empower the population and spur progress unlike any other."
 STG_a_better_system:0 "A Better System"
 STG_a_better_system_desc:0 "Equestrian harmony has its limits. If it didn't, Caramel Marks would not have needed to call for first reform and then revolution. The Severyana that rose in the end however also had its limits, and blood ran in the streets. Each was better than what came before however, and this process is nowhere near finished."
 STG_incremental_hardness_of_power:0 "Incremental Hardness of Power"
 STG_incremental_hardness_of_power_desc:0 "When the soft word does not suffice, the firm demand follows. After this comes the threat, which in turns is followed by direct action. The details and nuances shift, but each of these tools are part of the arsenal of the state, and no tool fits every situation."
 STG_severyanian_enfranchisement:0 "Severyanian Enfranchisement"
 STG_severyanian_enfranchisement_desc:0 "All power comes from the creatures of the nation, and either this holds true for all or it holds true for none. Enfranchisement cannot be limited to nobility, nor can it be held only by those who have the 'right' opinions."
 STG_clasped_hooves_across_class_lines:0 "Clasped hooves across class lines"
 STG_clasped_hooves_across_class_lines_desc:0 "The problem with violent action is that the scope of targets all too easily grows. Instead of targeting first counter-revoultionaries, then reactionaries, then "fence-sitters" and lastly "the wrong kind of socialists", we pledge ourselves to unity across class lines."
 STG_informed_participation:0 "Informed Participation"
 STG_informed_participation_desc:0 "We expect that all citizens participate in the political system, but is it fair to expect a factory worker to understand the intricacies of foreign policy or economic growth? If the government does not properly communicate what they do to the citizens they exclude them, and therefore the language used by the government and civil service must be reformed to be comprehensible to all."
 STG_multilayered_representation:0 "Multilayered Representation"
 STG_multilayered_representation_desc:0 "Each creature is part of many circles, and while the members of the presidium may represent their region, their street, their community and their workplace is  as much part of who they are, and should not be ignored."
 STG_socialism_with_equestrian_harmony:0 "Socialism with Equestrian Harmony"
 STG_socialism_with_equestrian_harmony_desc:0 "Marks' first great project was the reforming - not overthrowing - of Equestria. Abandoning this was her great failure, and with the ultraleftists out of the political arena this fact can be acknowledged without leading executions in the streets. Instead, we can start working towards this goal once again, and this time we will be successful."
 STG_bringing_the_exiles_home:0 "Bringing the Exiles home"
 STG_bringing_the_exiles_home_desc:0 "Many thousands fled Severyana when we rose up, and they now are scattered across the world, bereft of their homeland. Yet, many of them have great wealth and many contacts, and by offering amnesties and reparations, we can hopefully convince them to return and labour for the good of the nation again."
 STG_watchtower_democracy:0 "Watchtower Democracy"
 STG_watchtower_democracy_desc:0 "Popular rule does not mean populism, nor does it mean to stand idly by when those opposed to it seek to abolish it. We will work together to face our ideological opponents with the right tools for the job, whichever those may be."
 STG_reforms_for_red_harmony:0 "Reforms for Red Harmony"
 STG_reforms_for_red_harmony_desc:0 "The socialist project is the greatest advancement in modern political history, yet it should not be expected to wipe away all that came before it. Instead, it will contribute its part to the political advancement of all creatures."
 STG_inevitanle_but_responsible_change:0 "Inevitable, but Responsible Change"
 STG_inevitanle_but_responsible_change_desc:0 "We are not going to pretend that change should be done unilaterally and without consideration, but neither should we dismiss the idea of it. We will push on, and we will foment change in the world, but it shall be done responsibly so."
 STG_ever_committed_to_the_revolution:0 "Ever commited to the revolution"
 STG_ever_committed_to_the_revolution_desc:0 "Compromise is a fine thing, but there are certain things that cannot be compromised away. The need for socialist change is one of these things, and as much as we are happy to once again walk alongside our Equestrian kin, both they and we should know that we haven't abandoned the struggle for change."
 STG_harmonic_socialist_technology:0 "Harmonic-Socialist Technocracy"
 STG_harmonic_socialist_technology_desc:0 "The harmonic ideals of Equestria helped Severyana grow and develop in peace and prosperity, and the socialist doctrine of Caramel Marks helped to mobilise and empower the average pony. Together, the whole of Severyana is now greater than the sum of its components"
 STG_a_better_tomorrow:0 "A Better Tomorrow"
 STG_a_better_tomorrow_desc:0 "Progress is the foundation of socialism. Nothing will ever remain the same forever, and either change is welcomed or it will force itself in. Economically, culturally and politically, Severyana will embrace this change eagerly, because tomorrow can always be better."
 STG_economic_exchanges:0 "Economic Exchanges"
 STG_economic_exchanges_desc:0 "In only a few short years, Severyana and Equestria grew in different directions. Instead of trying to unify and become the same however, we shall learn from these differences, pick the best of both worlds and use this to grow even more."
 STG_empowering_the_equestrian_working_class:0 "Empowering the Equestrian Working Classes"
 STG_empowering_the_equestrian_working_class_desc:0 "By the accords signed between us and Equestria, the government must not infringe on labour organisation, nor are Severyanian ponies restricted from travelling through Equestria. Consequently, local Equestrian labour organisations need only ask, and they will get all the aid Severyana can provide."
 STG_union_cooperation_agreements:0 "Union Cooperation Agreements"
 STG_union_cooperation_agreements_desc:0 "To assuage concerns among the Equestrian elite, Severyana's unions and activists will pledge themselves to a set of argeements limiting what they can and cannot do. This, however, places expectations on the industrialists and landowners as well, and if they don't play nicely, our Equestrian comrades will act as one to counter them."
 STG_the_international_corps:0 "The International Corps"
 STG_the_international_corps_desc:0 "Equestria showed kindness and restraint of a kind few other nations would have, and we repay this in kind. Yet even under Dark Wing, Severyana will not stand idly by as tyrants and reactionaries go after those who fight for their rights."
 STG_funding_the_labour_unions:0 "Funding the Labour Unions"
 STG_funding_the_labour_unions_desc:0 "The labour unions are not part of the government, and indeed can serve as the opposition when the government does not take their members' needs into account. This independence means that they cannot be directly funded by the government, but it also means that they have more leeway in how they fund their operations. We will not stand in the way."
 STG_encouraging_factory_floor_consultations:0 "Encouraging Factory Floor Consultations"
 STG_encouraging_factory_floor_consultations_desc:0 "It is absurd that the talents and experiences of the common worker is so lightly put aside, even today. The unions are preparing to push for factory floor consultations across Equestria, where the bosses will be forced to take the advice of their workers into account. The fact that it will also serve as a first taste of factory democracy is a nice little bonus."
 STG_countrywide_labour_organisations:0 "Countrywide labour organisations"
 STG_countrywide_labour_organisations_desc:0 "A hundred small organisations can achieve much, but if they all pull together in one direction, they will achieve so much more. Before, the memory of the Severyanian revolution put a damper on such sentiment, but thankfully this is now no longer an issue."
 STG_severyanian_summer_cooperatives:0 "Severyanian Summer Cooperatives"
 STG_severyanian_summer_cooperatives_desc:0 "Our union members fight for the right to the fruits of their labour, but nopony lives only to work. With the resources at our unions' disposal, they can also create communally run summer camps as well. Here, they and their foals will get to enjoy rest and relaxation not due to the charity of a noble or industrialist, but due to their own efforts."
 STG_the_canterlot_agreement:0 "The Canterlot Agreement"

#### EVENTS #####
### starting tree events ###
stalliongrad_start.1.t:0 "Home of the Revolution"
stalliongrad_start.1.d:0 "The story of socialism in Severyana begins in 940s, when unicorn mare named Caramel Marks and her friend and colleague – Fire Angel, a griffon – decided to settle in the region after their long travel across Equestria, seeking to observe how the nation was changing in the wake of the industrial revolution. They saw the North-Eastern Autonomy – the official name of Severyana during Celestia's rule. This place turned out to be the one where the class contradictions were the strongest. It's here where they created the Union of Struggle for Justice.\n\nThey weren't able to see the fruits of their labor, however. Caramel Marks died in 954 ALB, and Fire Angel fled to Skyfall, where he promoted the ideas of Marksism to the broad griffon masses.\n\nBut they laid the seeds through their organisations and ideas, which would culminate in the alliance of Karamelka Sladkaya's "Workers' Association" and USJ, led by Steel Stallion. These two would break the stagnation and create the North-Eastern Labour Party, a precursor to the modern day Severyanian Communist Party. Thus the following events were inevitable: the Petershoof uprising, Pastilá Strike, declaration of the Republic of Severyana – the first nation to become independent from Equestria for centuries – followed by the Revolutionary War, when the first tanks were deployed in battle, and resulting in freedom and independence.\n\nWhat is left to be done? Shortly after the revolution, "Reorganization Period" was proclaimed by Stallion, aimed at gathering power and resources for the future socialist construction. But even after twelve years, the revolution has not yet entrenched itself in Severyana, largely known now as Stalliongrad. Ponies, thestrals, griffons and others live in much better conditions than they ever did under Celestia, but after the death of Steel Stallion, his party stands at the crossroads. Various socialist movements have sprung up beyond the borders of Severyana, and very few have achieved success compared to ours. If the workers are to be liberated, and petty bourgeoisie destroyed as a class, then we have much work ahead of us."
stalliongrad_start.1.a:0 "Long Live the Republic!"

stalliongrad_start.2.t:0 "A Party Divided"
stalliongrad_start.2.d:0 "Our great leader, the Founding Father of the Republic, has always taught the communists to stay strong and united. However, after Steel Stallion's death in 1003, the situation in the SCP has deteriorated.\n\nThe majority of the Party, led by prominent ponies, follows his line: reconstructing the economy, preparing to build socialism, helping the communists and the progressive forces abroad. Altydia "Alty Coggydeer" Revoltsova, Stallion's "left hoof", has managed to become the new General Secretary of the Party.\n\nNot all the comrades, however, agree with the line. Facing the current difficulties, they think a different line should be taken. The problems of trade, agriculture, and economic planning stil plague us; though we have had twelve years to muster it, the Red Army is still hardly a mighty force.\n\nWhile the majority of the party still believes in the program set out by Steel Stallion, the opposition factions have pointed to our failures to solve the problems brought on by the December Revolution as evidence that a major change of course is needed. They seem to become more and more popular both among some workers who have lost the optimism of the early days and among young socialists full of starry-eyed idealism and yearning to recapture the true spirit of revolution.\n\nWith factionalism, clashing egos, infighting and bureaucracy stymieing efforts at implementing long-term solutions, party unity has become the number one issue. For without unity, none of the other problems can be solved, and the revolution will never be able to move forward."
stalliongrad_start.2.a:0 "We shall not disgrace the Stallion's banner!"

stalliongrad_start.3.t:0 "Announcing the 10th Party Congress"
stalliongrad_start.3.d:0 "On the right, Caramelka takes every opportunity to point out the flaws in Stalliongrad’s governance. On the far left, extremists wish to take our young nation even further through brutal and uncompromising means. Vasiliy calls for the party to gather and address the growing problems plaguing the state. Optimistic followers of Stallion believe that Vasiliy and Altidiya will unite the party and prove the efficacy of Stalliongrad’s communist theory. Meanwhile, fringe groups hold their breaths, awaiting ineffective reform from the center-left."
stalliongrad_start.3.a:0 "Hurrah"

stalliongrad_start.4.t:0 "Majority"
stalliongrad_start.4.d:0 "The Majority is not officially a faction, but in the leadup to the Tenth Party Congress they have become tired of the infighting and are ready to move forward, rallying around a troika of prominent figures to bring unity to the party.\n\nPremier Vasiliy is the leader, and many hope that he will one day become General Secretary. Long thought of as a policymaker above factional conflict, he has come out strongly against disunity and revisionism in the party, arguing that the SCP must remember its purpose and serve the people and the revolution rather than their private interests. He has announced that he will propose an ambitious program of unity and anti-corruption measures at the next Congress.\n\nThe second figure is Gold Muffin, the Changeling revolutionary. After becoming a voice for calm and reconciliation within the SCP, Muffin was appointed to the post of Chaircreature of the Supreme Soviet. In this role, he has worked to moderate debates between the factions and encourage unity around the General Secretary. He is also a close personal friend of Vasiliy, and believes that his rise to power will be the best result for all creatures of Severyana.\n\nThe final figure is the most controversial: the firebrand, Sinister Serov. A dangerous pony, many blame him stoking factionalism within the Party, in addition to flirting with the ultra-left opposition in the past. However, it seems his deep friendship with Vasiliy has caused him to throw his support behind Vasiliy's program, at least for now, and his charismatic appeals have swayed many on-the-fence party members. Only time will tell if this coalition will last."

stalliongrad_start.5.d:0 "Passionate, militaristic, and controversial, Masha unites the ultra-left through her devotion to an eternal revolution. Despite her tough early years, her dedication and extremism are often only seen in the young. Her undying loyalty to communism makes her, and her followers incorruptible, but her proposed methods are brutal. She refuses to tolerate or consider the ideas and practices of capitalists and far-right ideologies and insists that the oppressors must be punished without mercy. Naturally, she despises Karamelka and views her as a corrupt bureaucrat. The young Masha is useful to the party as long as they give her proper guidance. However, if she is given more independence, the militant ultra-left may become a threat to Stalliongrad’s stability."

stalliongrad_start.6.t:0 "The Opposition. Right Wing" #why does this mention Masha? 
stalliongrad_start.6.d:0 "Since Steel Stallion's death, opposition factions have formed. They vote together, consistently support each other, and frequently reopen debates which were previously closed, skirting the principle of democratic centralism and aggravating the party's indecisiveness. The main opposition factions are the rightists and the ultra-leftists. While they both agree on preserving their ability to oppose the majority and frequently vote together on administrative and procedural issues, they could not be more different in terms of their ultimate aims.\n\nThe rightists, led by the universally-respected Karamelka and the universally-despised Dark Wing, advocate consolidating the NEP and an approach of "new thinking" and "openness," whereby they would reintroduce some capitalist elements into the Stalliongrad economy and pursue a thaw in relations with Harmonist neighbours, with the goal of slowly spreading socialist ideas in Equestria. They maintain that under their program, our productive capacities and standard of living would leapfrog past Equestria, and in the long term socialism would become more popular than if we hold strictly to Marksist orthodoxy.\n\nThe ultra-left faction on the other hoof has no official leader, but is generally dominated by radical general Masha Norushkina. They argue Steel Stallion did not go far enough, and that the NEP should be immediately scrapped and collectivisation accelerated. They also advocate for massive military buildup, a drastic reduction in bureaucracy, and immediate preparation for total war with Equestria to bring the revolution by force."

Not sure how we'd've kept us all fed without the NEP." Murmurs of ascent. Sinister knew he had to do something.\n\n"The NEP!" Sinister railed, "A system which lets wealthy kulaks hoard grain whenever they wish, lets them get all the best equipment and leaves none for you. The NEP turns a blind eye to anti-Soviet elements and wreckers in our midst! Comrades, the NEP is not the solution, the NEP is the problem!"\n\nSinister had nothing else to say.

It was a side not many got to see of the premier, who most thought was a dour bureaucrat all the time.\n\n"And thank you, Sinister!" the red-maned stallion slurred, turning to his friend, "Without you, and uh, and you too Muffin!

"I live to serve the revolution, my dear Vasya!"\n\n"To the revolution!" Vasiliy proclaimed, then realized his glass was empty. Muffin gave a tiny shake of his head, indicating there would be no more for the premier. Sinister smiled.

stalliongrad_start.26.d:0 ""...Although our efforts have thus far focused on supporting comrades in Baltimare's trade unions and the socialist sailors in Vanhoover, we the undersigned believe in accordance with the principle of internationalism that more must be done. In particular, there are two major untapped populations. First, we hold that the Crystal Ponies would be receptive to us, as they feel the alienation of capitalism more acutely due to only recently being proletarianised after long existence in a pre-capitalist state."\n\n"For similar reasons, the batponies of Equestria would turn to socialism easily if given the right push. Many batponies have only recently joined the proletariat, having been displaced into the cities by primitive accumulation and facing particularly poor working conditions. While many of them cling to monarchism in the vain hope that Princess Luna will help, the last seven years of inaction have resulted in many turning to more radical voices. If we do not act soon, they will turn to reactionary nationalism or other alternative ideologies for a solution. To facilitate this, we the undersigned recommend a 20% increase in funding to the program for helping revolutionaries abroad..."\n\nAltidiya considered the proposal. It was signed not only by Masha's clique of radicals, but by several members of the majority, including Sinister Serov and Gold Muffin. It was bold, dangerous even. Karamelka had just come to her last week, suggesting that funding communists in Equestria was taking vital resources away from the people of Stalliongrad, and that "poking the Equestrian Ursa" risked an unwinnable war if our operations were discovered.\n\nVasiliy, for his part, had insisted that our current operations were quite secure, but that expanding to the Crystal Empire and the batponies would surely result in our discovery. As a matter of clandestine operations, the decision was Altidiya's alone to make."

stalliongrad_start.27.d:0 "One of the more controversial doctrines adopted during the Altidiya years is Socialism In One Country, that is to say, the doctrine that our efforts should primarily focus on building a shining, self-sufficient socialist state in Severyana.\n\nThe ultra-lefts in particular have always opposed that move, arguing in line with classical Marksism that the revolution is international in character and that our worker's state will degenerate into state capitalism unless we rapidly spread the revolution to Equestria, at the bare minimum.\n\nThe right opposition are also skeptical, but instead argue that a period of state capitalism is actually necessary to expand the means of production and improve standards of living. All in preparation for spreading the revolution through economics, diplomacy, and force as a last resort. Still, they advocate against scrapping the policy because it clearly communicates to the world that we are not going to invade our neighbours at will.\n\nThe center is divided on the topic, with Sinister Serov largely siding with the ultra-lefts, but Vasiliy arguing that it is possible. He believes that the material conditions in Stalliongrad are sufficient to support, if not full communism, then at least a robust socialism, but only if we are courageous and unified in our pursuit of a better life."

This allows us to maintain democracy and make good decisions, but also to move forward with unity and purpose. "Freedom of Debate, Unity of Action," in theory.\n\nIn practice, the emergence of factions within the party undermines the efficacy of this principle. Party members privately dissent from policies they already had a chance to contest publicly, then those dissensions find their way to the press and chip away at even the appearance of unity. Debates are reopened again and again.\n\nVasiliy's ally Sinister Serov has argued that if this principle is to mean anything, we must curtail factionalism. While it is too soon to ban factions outright, the general secretary can release an official statement condemning them, and institute new rules of order within the Supreme Soviet to better enforce democratic centralism. The ultra-leftist and rightist factions have both objected that these rules will stifle the freedom of debate within the party and lead to rigidity and dogmatism, to which Vasiliy retorted that they would not have been necessary if the factions had not made them necessary with their ceaseless infighting."

She has only ever dabbled in politics, but seems to be a favour high-tech industries as the core of Stalliongrad's economic progress.

Now we must decide where to distribute these combine harvesters, tractors, and other equipment. Vasiliy suggests that we send the majority out to the collective farms, and if the private farms want them, they can buy them from the state. This will cause more farmers to embrace collectivisation and generate state revenue.\n\nThe opposition argue that now is not the time to play favourites and that we should ship the machinery out to all our farmers. Many suspect the left opposition has sided with the rightists on this because of some deal, or because they see no need to encourage collectivisation through economics when they plan to do it by force."

Or at least it would be if it weren't for the muffled sounds of somepony pounding on his door.\n\n"Is it the SePo or the mailpony? Either way come back later," Sinister drawled, poking his head just above the water.\n"It's Vasya!" came a muffled voice from the other side of the door. Sinister blinked. What did Vasiliy want?\n"Fine, fine, you have the spare key, just come on in!"\n\nVasiliy entered the suite mid-sentence: "...didn't want to barge in if you were- oh-for-the-love-of-Tartarus!"\n"Bathing?" finished Sinister, grinning devilishly as Vasiliy gave an exasperated sigh.\n"Yes, that. What are you doing?"\n"Bathing."\n""The Party Congress starts in less than an hour and we need to coordinate!"\n"Oh I'm terribly sorry Vasya, it slipped my mind. I'm sure I can make it up to you by blowing everypony away at the Congress with another stellar speech in your favour..."\n"Have you even prepared anything?"\n"Come now, you know I simply get going and say what I feel like."\n\nVasiliy finally made eye contact with his friend, narrowing his eyes.\n"Not this time, Sinnie. This time you're not riling up a crowd, you're making a case to party delegates who deserve to know what they're getting into if they endorse my program. You need to actually be professional, for once."\n"Oh I'll need more than an hour of prep for that, my dear Vasya!"\n"Oh, don't worry.

All his efforts had come to this: either Sinister's fire, Muffin's diplomacy and Vasiliy's hard work would unite the party, or it would all come to nothing. Vasiliy waited as Altidiya officially opened the tenth party Congress, barely hearing her words as his mind raced with what could go wrong. He almost didn't hear when the General Secretary announced it was time for him to propose his first resolution.\n\nIt had taken so much effort to get Vasiliy's anti-corruption resolution to the top of the list, but Vasiliy knew it would be worth it. This would allow him to set the tone for the entire Congress. Stepping up to the podium, he began:\n"Comrades, I am not going to mince words. The Party is in distress. I have long spoken out against factionalism, this you all know, but today I would like to begin with something that unites us all: the duty of every representative of the SCP to serve the interests of the people and the revolution, rather than their private interests."\n\n"It is precisely the temptation to profit off of their offices which turns factionalism from a healthy part of party democracy into a source of deadlock. Therefore, I propose a new set of countermeasures to ensure that every official be subject to proper performance evaluations, and that corruption be dealt with swiftly and conclusively."\n\nAfter a few minutes of clarifying questions from Karamelka, the vote was called, and the resolution passed easily."

Comrade Sladkaya, your efforts kept us from famine, and brought the prosperity you have always believed we needed before creating socialism. For that, we thank you."\n\nVasiliy glanced at Masha's crowd. Good. Sinister was where he was supposed to be, keeping the batpony distracted so she couldn't rally her faction to denounce Muffin as a revisionist or whatever insult she thought of for somecreature with something good to say about the NEP. Muffin finished his speech. As expected, Karamelka Sladkaya got up to argue against him.\n\n"Thank you, comrade Muffin, for your kind words. However, I argue that we have not achieved the prosperity necessary to go forward with collectivisation. As Comrade Muffin said, the NEP generates prosperity and security, increasing median real income yearly since its adoption and limiting inflation. Why should we throw it away?"\n\nVasiliy relaxed. Of course, Karamelka would argue against it, but he could already feel her losing the delegates as she got into dry economic data, sounding more like a bourgeois economist by the moment. Sinister was joking around with some of the delegates, and it was clear Karamelka wouldn't be able to stop it. When the vote came, even some of the rightists voted in favour of phasing out the NEP."

This begs the question: prosperous relative to whom? Certainly not Manehattan, or the other large cities which have access to the Equestrian market." Dark Wing took a moment, letting the ultra-left faction jeer at him, Sinister failing to stop Masha from yelling "Counter-revolutionary!"\n"There is another thing I find interesting. Obviously, Comrade Muffin, you are complimenting Karamelka as part of Vasiliy's plans to implement measures to, in his words, 'Advance the revolution and serve the people.' As if those are always the same thing. I did find it ironic you started with anti-corruption, given where Serov gets the money for his walk-in closet full of dresses and his other one full of suits."\n\n"This again, Dark Wing?" Sinister shouted, "You and your cronies have already had me investigated for corruption twice and they found nothing; I am simply very good at shopping!"\n\n"Very good at not getting caught!" hollered one of the rightist delegates.\n"Comrades, enough shouting!" said  Dark Wing, but the damage was done. The room descended into accusations and personal attacks, with every potentate of every faction feeling the need to deliver a lengthy speech on the last speech.

Maybe Comrade Norushkina is ready to choke on burners, but I, like  most of our comrades, prefer to eat delicious pies. So let's make Celestia herself jealous of our pie".\n\nThe resolution prepared by Sladkaya recognized the insufficient preparedness of the Severyana's economy for the construction of socialism, urged the government to maintain the current course and indicated the need for further measures aimed at developing the country's economy and strengthening stability.

He jostled his right hoof, shaking a manila folder stuffed hastily with papers. "I need to come inside. Please." Karamelka knew the sound in his voice, and she knew it well. It was the sound of someone making a very hard decision that they were about to back out of. So she let the major in.\n\nThe pegasus began to pace around her office, gripping the papers extremely hard, "As you know, during the revolution I had the honor of commanding our pegasi shock corps. And I have continued this responsibility to this day." Karamelka nodded as Morozov rattled off his accomplishments during the revolution, "Since then, I formed a friendship with general Masha. But it was just that, we were friends. I stayed out of politics, I didn't want to get involved."\n\nKaramelka put her hoof in front of him, stopping his pacing. "Major Morozov. I know you are not a stallion of intrigue, I trust you, what is going on?"\n\nThe pegasus sighed and threw the folder onto the desk, "Three days ago I was contacted by general Masha asking for her help in a plot. She has made a pact with Sinister Serov to overthrow the government at the next Congress. She wanted my unit to play a role, so I said yes to get out of the conversation. I knew I had to tell someone, I know you're the only one Sinister would never be able to get on side. I'll do whatever you need me to. Just stop Sinister. I don't know how he bent Masha's leg, but we can't let this happen."\n\nKaramelka took everything in, and laughed internally. It was just like the days of the revolution. But it seemed this time she was on the other end of things. "Of course, thank you for your help.""

stalliongrad_start.79.d:0 "Masha looked over the plans in front of her. The maneuvers for the day of reckoning, when she would finally save the revolution. Everything was in place. Bagryan's SePo would secure the Congress building, the shock troops would secure the important government buildings. Sinister would make his speech, and everything would go as planned. There was just the issue of-\n\n"Masha..." the thestral looked up to see Major Morozov standing in the doorway. The stallion stared her dead in the eyes with an expression like steel. What was going on? "There's a visitor for you." Before Masha could respond, Morozov stepped out of the way, revealing Karamelka Sladkaya.\n\nThe General spoke with aprehension, "Comrade Sladkaya, it's a surprise to see you." Masha shifted slightly, she didn't know what was going on, and she began to move for where she kept her hidden pistol.\n\n"It's not a surprise to see you, General. And don't bother looking for your weapon, it's not there." Masha's eyes widened and her heart sank when she realized what had happened. The coup had been sold out, and she had no way to fight back. As Masha froze, Karamelka walked over and put a hoof on her shoulder, "I'm sorry child. Your zeal got the better of you." Before turning around to the door, "Comrade Flyagin, place Masha Norushkina under arrest."\n\nAnd as Masha was put into a car outside her building, she could only wonder how it all went so wrong."

stalliongrad_start.80.t:0 "A New Motion"
stalliongrad_start.80.d:0 ""Order! Order! I call order to this congress!" Gold Muffin bellowed from his podium before the Supreme Soviet. The timid and reserved changeling let his voice out for the first time in many months to calm the chaos of the chamber. Delegates stood, not taking their seats, and whispered to one another, it was complete anarchy. "I will not have this congress devolve into chaos!"\n\nSinister Serov rose and shouted above the murmuring, "This congress will achieve order once we find out what happened to General Norushkina! We cannot have officers of the state disappearing with no action from the administration!"\n\nGold Muffin began to lose patience, but then, out of the corner of his eye, he saw Karamelka enter the chamber. Finally, this torture could end. He despised acting like this to the congress, and especially his friend Sinister. Or, what was once his friend. Karamelka looked the changeling in the eyes and nodded.\n\nMuffin took in a deep breath, and bellowed as loud as his voice would allow him, "Silence!" Waiting for the room to become quiet, he continued, "I believe Comrade Sladkaya has something to say." Muffin looked from Sladkaya to Sinister. Sinister wasn't looking back. His eyes were trained on Karamelka, an unnatural focus consuming him. His plot couldn't proceed without Masha, but he didn't know it was all over already.\n\nKaramelka stood from her seat and cleared her voice, "I would like to present a motion on the condemnation of the conduct of Comrade Serov." On queue, the left wing of the hall erupted. Sinister himself soon rose and fired back, "Doing the wishes of Dark Wing now are you? I thought this nonsense was his job!"\n\n"Seconded!"\n\nThe hall went silent, as all eyes looked to Gold Muffin. He never approved motions before, so all knew something was afoot. Karamelka smirked as horror set in on Serov's face, "I formally charge Sinister Serov with collaboration with and participation in a military coup against the Communist Party, I charge him with anti-socialist behavior-" By now the yelling in the hall was getting louder, with left delegates trying to snuff out Karamelka's cries. "With working with the traitorous General Masha Norushkina, and with plotting to destroy the revolution! And I declare you under arrest!"\n\nOn queue with the finishing of her speech, Gold Muffin sighed, and pressed the button under his podium. The next few minutes were a blur as Morozov's soldiers stormed the hall and arrested the plotters, but Muffin couldn't stop thinking about how it all came to this."
stalliongrad_start.80.a:0 "Where did he lose his way?"

stalliongrad_start.81.t:0 "An Old Comrade"
stalliongrad_start.81.d:0 "Gold Muffin, Chaircreature of the Supreme Soviet, normally didn't have much actual power. He had a lot of soft power, everypony liked him except for a few hardliners, but he wasn't in charge of any serious portfolio. But for what Karamelka was about to do, the Changeling Revolutionary was vital.\n\nShe needed somepony - or someling, in his case - who was seen as unimpeachable, not part of the rightist faction and only vaguely associated with the center. And as chair of the Supreme Soviet, Muffin could second her motion to arrest Sinister from a position where everypony would listen.\n\nKaramelka made no appeals. She just gave Muffin her dossier and waited. Muffin's compound eyes betrayed nothing, but the slight quivering of his jaw told her everything she needed to know. He believed her.\n\n"I..." Muffin began, "I wish it hadn't come to this. I really thought... Oh Karamelka, is there any way this is a misunderstanding?"\n"I'm afraid not."\n"I knew Sinister was trouble, but I really thought..." he took a drink of water, and then looked at her with a pleading expression. "I know what I have to do, but... Sinister... I don't want to. Is there any other way?"\n"I suppose you could talk to him."\nMuffin laughed bitterly.\n\n"No, you're right. Talk never worked for Sinister. I really thought that between Vasiliy and me, if he just had some good friends who really cared about him... but no, Sinister Serov is Sinister Serov. He won't change, and he won't back down.""
stalliongrad_start.81.a:0 ""So we'll have to cut him down.""

stalliongrad_start.82.d:0 "It had taken her long, so much longer than she'd expected, to reach this point. After Steel Stallion's death, many had assumed she would be the natural successor. The veteran revolutionary, the champion of the NEP, seen by many as Stallion's right hoof. But then Stallion's testament had been distributed, their disagreements had been made public, her association with Dark Wing had backfired, and it had all gone wrong. Karamelka had fallen from grace as younger ponies like Altidiya swept the carpet out from under her.\n\nIt had taken years to rebuild her power base. But in the end, she had all but resigned herself to playing second fiddle to Altidiya or Vasiliy. As Karamelka approached the podium to give her address, she almost wanted to thank Sinister, though he languished in a cell now. His coup had given her a chance to prove herself once more. No longer was she Karamelka the timid, Karamelka the weak, Karamelka the revisionist. Now, she was Karamelka the hero. She had saved the republic from its enemies, and all those voices which once whispered behind her back had fallen silent.\n\n"Comrades," she began, "It is with great humility that I accept the position of General Secretary of the Stalliongradian Communist Party. Our Socialist Republic has gone through much in these last years. So much anger and violence. But now, it is a new day. Now, Stalliongrad is united once more, and ready to face the future. There can be no equality without freedom, and there can be no freedom without equality. Socialism and liberty go hoof-in-hoof, and from this day forward, we will stand as a beacon of both. From this day forth, we will go forward fearlessly, our resolve tempered by mercy yet unshakable all the same. I accept this solemn duty, and invite you all to walk the path of revolution with me. Thank you.""

stalliongrad_start.83.d:0 "Masha and Sinister sat across from the two generals. Stremmenoy and Ketola: two ponies who had expressed sympathies towards the ultra-left, and who hadn't been shy about getting involved in politics. They had been talking for hours about the sorry state of the SCP and the need for action.\n\n"In the end, all you'd have to do would be to do nothing," Masha argued, "You'll be on standby unless somepony else tries to interfere. My own troops would handle the wetwork..."\n\nIt was then that the SePo entered the room. The four immediately got up, realising too late that they hadn't come armed. Three SePo ponies stood at attention as Danila Bagryan, former chief of the SePo, stepped into the room.\n\n"My my my," Danila said, "What do we have here? No, don't answer, I already know." He closed the door before continuing. "You are preparing a coup d'etat, are you not?"\n\n"Danila, comrade," began Sinister, but Danila waved a hoof.\n\n"Oh come now Sinnie. If I wanted to stop you, I wouldn't have come here myself. Just be glad it was I who found out and not Mistina or one of the others. No, I'm here to join you. Don't look so surprised! Everything you've been blathering about, I already know. Altidiya has gone soft. If Steel Stallion could see our party now, he would throw up. I warned him what would happen if he didn't purge Karamelka and the other weaklings, but alas, Stallion always had a soft side. It's a pity. So, here is my offer: I'll help you, if you reinstate my doctrines of Revolutionary Terror and allow me and the SePo a free hoof to pursue our duty to guard the revolution. Deal?"

Again and again, she muttered to herself: "How did it come to this?"\n\nEventually, the pair came upon a body which hadn't been cleaned up yet. One of their enemies, a pegasus in the uniform of the Pioneers and bearing a crudely-stitched Sinister badge, half-buried under debris and still clutching his pistol. Karemelka nearly collapsed at the sight.\n\n"Oh- oh sweet Celestia-" she whispered involuntarity, "H- help me," her legs gave way, and Dark Wing had to hold her up.\n\n"He was a child," Karamelka whispered while Dark Wing stared on, expressionless, "He should never have gotten involved...

For whatever reason, Princess Cadance is more willing to deal with us than Princess Celestia. In 1005, when we faced raw material shortfalls under blockade, Vasiliy and Karamelka brokered a deal with the resource-rich but technology-poor nation to help both of us. The "Copper for Crystals deal," as it was called, had us send engineers and electricians to electrify the Crystal City and lay down telephone wires across the nation, in exchange for large shipments of magical crystals, raw iron, and other resources.\n\nThat deal never sat well with the Ultra-Left faction. To them, the Crystal Empire should be a beachhead, not a trading partner. Repeatedly, Masha Norushkina has argued that we should seek to radicalise the Crystal Ponies, given that they are new to capitalism and not infected with its ideology. Instead, she lamented, we directly gave them the benefits of electricity and let their princess take the credit, endearing them to capitalist monarchy even more.\n\nNow, with the time coming to send an ambassador to the Crystal Empire, she has made a push within the Soviets to have herself sent over rather than Karamelka. Doubtless, she would use that visit to make contact with dissidents in the Empire. Karamelka for her part is looking forward to attending a banquet and meeting Princess Flurry Heart, as well as discussing further trade between our nations."

### Karamelka Events ###
stalliongrad_karamelka.1.t:0 "In the Wake of the Storm"
stalliongrad_karamelka.1.d:0 ""The perpetrators are in custody, and will stand trial. We are in control of the city, and the army is chasing down any remnant units." Karamelka looked out through the window. The rain was coming down hard, and she couldn't help but wish that it could just wash everything that had happened these last weeks away. Yet the rain would not save her, not from what just had happened, and not from what would come. When had it all gone so horribly wrong? "The big question is what we do with the rest of them."\n\n"'The rest of them' Krylyshko? "She asked softly, looking back at Dark Wing. He had come in as unflappably as always, giving her his update on the situation. She envied him his cool, but right now she felt worried. He raised one eyebrow as he put down the latest report on her desk.\n\n"Yes, the rest of the ultraleftists. Those who knew of this and kept silent. Those who cheered for it. Those in the streets with guns. This rot goes deep, and if we want to excise it-"\n\n"Rot!?" Karamelka snapped at him in disbelief. "These are our comrades! The ones whom we fought alongside to free Severyana! Have you forgotten that? What, are you imagining we should just purge them wholesale? Is that where we're at now?! Are you really that bitter, that you would throw so many of our ponies in arms aside now?! This is not a rot, it's a wound! It needs healing, not more cutting!"\n\n"You know, Sladkaya." Dark Wing sighed as his adjusted his glasses. "The princess' great fault was that she did too little, too late, until the situation boiled over. I'd suggest you take that lesson to heart, because you can't afford to make the same mistake." With that, he turned around and left Karamelka alone with her thoughts."
stalliongrad_karamelka.1.a:0 "There will be justice, but there cannot be vengeance."

stalliongrad_karamelka.2.t:0 "The Masterminds"
stalliongrad_karamelka.2.d:0 "Serov and Norushkina were not alone in their plans to coup the presidium. Dozens of high ranking officials and officers have been uncovered as part of the conspiracy. If the coup had succeeded, they would have been able to assume total control of the apparatus of state. The question is what is done about these ponies now. Karamelka has argued for a light touch and that every effort should be taken to rehabilitate as many of them as possible. For all that just happened, a harsh response will only drive more comrades away. This is especially true as a heavy-hoofed response would risk costing us many capable leaders and functionaries. Delegate Dark Wing has publicly spoken out against the idea of mercy, comparing them to the officers of the Royal Guard during the revolution and saying they deserve as little consideration. Blood runs in the streets and it was spilled on their orders. This, Dark Wing insists, is a betrayal of the highest order and cannot be forgiven."
stalliongrad_karamelka.2.a:0 "We save those whom we can, and condemn those whom we cannot."
stalliongrad_karamelka.2.b:0 "Their only mercy is not facing the same fate of those who died because of them."

stalliongrad_karamelka.3.t:0 "The Rank and File"
stalliongrad_karamelka.3.d:0 "Hundreds of militants flooded the streets during the coup attempt, and though many of them have gone into hiding, many more have been rounded up and are awaiting our decision. Just letting them go is out of the question, but the issue is what we do with them. In the end, they were technically just following orders, and with the confused chain of command for the militias it is no wonder that even those who were not very ideologically motivated ended up getting swept along. Karamelka is of the opinion that they should be facing either prison or penal labour - their choice - and that upon completion of their sentence the matter should be considered settled. A less messy system would not have allowed this, and in this the delegates - not the soldiers - failed. Dark Wing is less charitable, believing they should also be censured and considered ineligible for any positions of authority ever again. Taking up arms and marching against your comrades is much more than a simple mistake, and the consequences are theirs to bear."
stalliongrad_karamelka.3.a:0 "Make use of this second chance, comrades."
stalliongrad_karamelka.3.b:0 "At some point, each pony bears responsibility for her actions."

stalliongrad_karamelka.4.t:0 "The Bystanders"
stalliongrad_karamelka.4.d:0 "Conspiracies never stay entirely hidden. For every additional pony who knows of something, the risk of leaks grow exponentially. The fact that so many were involved with this and yet the affair stayed hidden proves that dozens if not hundreds of ponies knew of it even if they weren't actively involved, and yet they did nothing to stop it. Karamelka has been happy to leave this matter be beyond a public statement. Investigating and prosecuting this would be a massive task, one that would all too easily take the form of a purge. Dark Wing insists that this must be followed up as well. Those who are revealed to have known about the coup and did not alert the presidium were happy to watch arguments be traded for violence, and that cannot be the Severyana that the presidium wants to see. Political violence such as what the left wing attempted is unforgivable, and those who could have stopped it showed where they stood in this."
stalliongrad_karamelka.4.a:0 "Enough with this paranoia, it is time to come together."
stalliongrad_karamelka.4.b:0 "Question key ponies and prosecute those we can."

stalliongrad_karamelka.5.t:0 "Out of the Night"
stalliongrad_karamelka.5.d:0 ""Comrades of the presidium, I address you today with hope and sadness in equal measure. We come out of the events of the last months with new scars and sorrows, having faced division so severe it saw us turn on each other. The events of this winter will forever live in infamy, but at the same time we must take heart and learn from them. We allowed disunity and pride to fester, and in the end the unthinkable seemed rational." Karamelka was certain she'd relive these last weeks for the rest of her life, but the future waited for no mare.\n\n"Our system - born out of a struggle for freedom and for food - has not kept up with the changes of these last years, and we are must reevaluate ourselves. How did this happen, and how can we make sure it never happens again? I say it is because we stand divided on how we shall advance the socialist cause, and have been trying to do all things at once. If we are to navigate these waters, we must remember why we do what we do, and who we do it for."\n\n"We rose not for nationalist pride or global revolution, we rose so that our neighbors could eat, and to take charge of our own destiny. It is time we remember this. We have housed many of our people, but we need to go further and make the Severyanian worker's home the envy of the world. We have opened the political arena, but we must secure it against future radicalisation. We have given Severyana hope, but we must give it a future. Instead of dreaming of wars and death for the sake of the revolution, we must establish a model state for all to see. Our system was described by Caramel Marks as the end goal of history, and rather than inviting hostility through aggression, we shall let the flower of socialism bloom and let the results speak for themselves."\n\n"Comrades of the Presidium, let us build our All Ponies' Home together, and let the world see that we can do better. Thank you." She smiled for the first time now as the applause of the gathered delegates filled the presidium. Despite all that had been, and no matter how dark the night was, they still had hope."
stalliongrad_karamelka.5.a:0 "Now it is time to fulfil it."

### Dark Wing Events ###

 stalliongrad_darkwing.1.t:0 "The Motion of No Confidence"
 stalliongrad_darkwing.1.d:0 "Dark Wing stared Karamelka down, the mask finally slipping as he allowed his cold anger at her to be plainly visible. Over and over he had warned her, and it had all been in vain. Cradling that naive hope that the fence could be mended between them and the ultraleftists, she would let that rot back in among them. Unity above all, even if you'd let a mad animal back into your home.\n\n"124 votes for, 107 against. Delegate Dark Wing's motion of no confidence passes," Gold Muffin's voice echoed through the presidium, Dark Wing raising his hooves to begin applauding the decision and still looking straight at Karamelka. He didn't plan to flinch from what he had done, even as he could tell how deeply it hurt her that 'Krylyshko' had turned on her like this. Rising from her seat, she struggled to collect herself before addressing the presidium.\n\n"The presidium has spoken, and I will abide by its choice. I only ask that we remain united, and that despite our troubled history we do not further turn on each other." With that, she stepped away from the seat and walked towards the exit, right by him. "I really didn't think you'd be the one..." she murmured as she passed him by.\n\nDark Wing didn't reply. He could say many things. He could tell her she never really knew him, that not everypony was so enamoured by 'unity' as she was, that she was a useful idiot for those who'd see her in fetters or killed. He didn't though, there was no point. Severyana was what mattered right now."
 stalliongrad_darkwing.1.a:0 "It's time to get to work."

 stalliongrad_darkwing.2.t:0 "General Secretary Dark Wing."
 stalliongrad_darkwing.2.d:0 "With Karamelka Sladkaya's attempts at mercy having reached a fever pitch, she had alienated not only many of her own faction, but many centrists as well. While she might have believed that there was still hope for reconciliation, she had missed the whispers behind her that had pressured her fellow rightists about whether they truly believed that the murderous ultraleftists would not see weakness instead of clemency. They had already attempted to overthrow the presidium, so why would they not try again when all their failure earned them was some hoof-waggling and disapproving looks? A pruned tree would grow branches yet again, and Karamelka refused to even consider the axe.\n\nHad he stabbed the mare that trusted him when nopony else did in the back? Yes. Had he essentially proven the ones that had viewed him with suspicion right? Yes. Could it be argued he proved the ultraleftists right? Yes. Politics did that to you, and he had know about this ever since he served under the pre-revolutionary Duma. Still, he was done placing his faith in other ponies."
 stalliongrad_darkwing.2.a:0 "If not me, then who?"

 stalliongrad_darkwing.3.t:0 "A Military Beyond Reproach"
 stalliongrad_darkwing.3.d:0 ""The neutrality of our armed forces shall therefore be written into the Severyanian constitution. As the event of these previous months have shown, those who took oaths to defend our nation and people cannot be embroiled in factional infighting. Severyana, all of it, relies on them for protection, and this protection must be one that takes no sides other than that of the nation and the revolution." The applause filled the presidium, and Dark Wing smiled slightly as he looked towards Lunin, who was sitting in the audience.\n\nHe knew what the old warhorse was thinking. While this did offer the military guarantees, it also meant that from now on it would be trivial to demand that any politically uncomfortable officers be expelled or censured. This included Lunin, who now would have the government breathing down his neck to trot the line. Lunin knew this. Dark Wing knew that he knew, and Lunin knew that Dark Wing knew.\n\nOf course he could buck these rules, but that would mean bringing the military into open revolt and be forced to seize control himself without a shred of legitimacy. Until then though, the military would be under control."
 stalliongrad_darkwing.3.a:0 "Long Live the Loyal Defenders of Severyana."

 stalliongrad_darkwing.4.t:0 "No Patience for Those who Sought Blood"
 stalliongrad_darkwing.4.d:0 "The expulsion of the ultraleftists was swift, but steady, and within a few days they were effectively undone as a serious political force. With their leaders already imprisoned, the remaining delegates were brought to heel by a new anti-extremist bill that outlawed any political organisation that had participated in violent activities against the state and expelled any representatives who had supported such actions from the SCP. Even if some ultras could hang on by the skin of their teeth, they were reduced to a tiny fraction on the very fringe whose association with the failed coup would tarnish them.\n\nThe expelled delegates meanwhile would spend weeks if not months bickering about who would become the new figureheads of whatever new organisation they'd create, and as they bickered there would be plenty of time for SePo to pick off more of them for whatever actions they took that were even slightly out of line and leave the more obviously insane or unstable ones around to scare ponies off. In the end the movement would be discredited and reduced to a small rabble of howling lunatics taken seriously by nopony.\n\nThat was the thing about crushing something. You could try to do it in one move, but many times a slow squeeze worked even better."
 stalliongrad_darkwing.4.a:0 "There won't be a second chance for them."

 stalliongrad_darkwing.5.t:0 "The Stavropon Congress"
 stalliongrad_darkwing.5.d:0 "The old estate right outside of Stavropon had been built over two centuries ago for the then new Tsaritsa of Severyana - Princess Celestia. Yet while it had seen the occasional use, she had rarely come here as she had preferred to be in the capitol among other ponies when visiting. The choice of venue was quite intentional though, and Dark Wing smiled for the cameras as he shook hooves with the ponies that came up the stairs to it.\n\nAfter the coup attempt, all of Severyana had been tense, and Karamelka's limp-hoofed handling of the ultraleftists had not helped. There was fear and uncertainty still, and unlike some, Dark Wing was not too good to speak with those who had kept Severyana going.\n\n"Thank you, everypony, for being here today," he addressed the crowd as they all had moved into the ballroom which now was used as a congress hall. "I speak to you today not merely as the General Secretary, but as somepony who has worked for the betterment of Severyana for decades. We have all gone through a trying period of time recently - a period that was the apex of years of confusion and lack of direction. We sought unity, yet fanatics responded with trying to claim dominance. Fortunately, disaster was avoided, but we should not treat this matter as settled. There will always be those who view our struggle for the common pony as a religious purity test, and who will gladly view the moderates among them as traitors or heretics. I have assembled you all - industrialists, artists, civil servants, union leaders, academics - here today to not to preach, but to listen. I expect there to be disagreements, but I also know that these will not end in bloodshed. Not here, not among us. Thank you for being here, and may sanity prevail in the end.""
 stalliongrad_darkwing.5.a:0 "A toast to a new start!"

 stalliongrad_darkwing.6.t:0 "The Liberalisation Debate"
 stalliongrad_darkwing.6.d:0 "The Stavropon Congress is not playing host only to the captains of industry, but also of culture and arts. One of the foremost among these is the former diplomat and playwright Maxim Mukhomorov. After he decided that he should mock the communist party as relentlessly as he did the Duma, the old eccentric was 'convinced' to retire lest he become charged with spreading reactionary propaganda. Retirement however has not dulled the old writer, only made him even more of a firebrand, and he's argued ferociously for that Severyana must liberalise and open itself not only to the world, but to its people. What kind of liberty leaves one having to cower in fear of angering the wrong people he asks. If one claims to struggle for the common pony, they should have more freedom and not less.\n\nThough the congress has promised to be an open space, his bluntness has nevertheless made many uncomfortable. During the later parts of the day he has thankfully been largely absent, being last seen out in the garden taking an extended post-lunch (and post-twenty drinks) nap. This has given Ryabinka Terpkaya, recently returned from Skyfall after the revolution saw her life's work ruined, time to speak up.\n\nTerpkaya too wants to see the average Severyanian empowered, but believes that the best way to do so is to remember who they are. With the desire to build a new communist identity, what happens then with the old Severyanian ways? Ripping it all up by the roots will just leave the Severyanian ponies adrift in the world, and if the congress is to call for anything, it should be the revitalisation of Severyana's culture instead of trying to throw it all away. Change should empower, not alienate, and if Severyana remembers who she is she will be stronger for it, and the world will hear her."
 stalliongrad_darkwing.6.a:0 "Mukhomorov is right! Freedom is non-negotiable, and we must fight for it!"
 stalliongrad_darkwing.6.b:0 "Maybe Terpkaya is right... in the struggle for a new world, we forgot who we are."

 stalliongrad_darkwing.7.t:0 "The Future of Industry"
 stalliongrad_darkwing.7.d:0 "Severyana has been an industrial powerhouse since the industrial revolution, but that does not mean that it has not faced issues in recent times. For all the importance placed on industry and construction by the SCP, there is a lot of discontent regarding how things have been managed. Mitya Gearin and his sister Meachta have spoken out against the political involvement in factory management, and how the presidium's grandstanding plans repeatedly have produced situations where Severyana's economy has been hamstrung by the need to be more socialist about how they run things. The recent attempt to open Severyana more to international trade owes its failure to this confusion, and Meachta, who was deeply involved in said project, has urged the congress to push for greater freedom of management. Running a factory, or encouraging international trade is not a matter of being the most socialist, and too much political interference only weakens Severyana.\n\nIn the other end, Shpala Beryozkina of the civil service has argued that the problem is not found in the presidium per se, but rather the inability to commit to one overarching plan. The government is more than capable of providing the stability that Severyana's industry needs, and should commit to fulfilling this role properly. This is especially true when it comes to infrastructure and housing, as good transportation, well-housed workers and political stability will be as important to ensure good productivity."
 stalliongrad_darkwing.7.a:0 "The Gearins are bold, but they have a point."
 stalliongrad_darkwing.7.b:0 "Beryozkina's ideas are attractive, and uncontroversial too."

 stalliongrad_darkwing.8.t:0 "The Declaration of the 231"
 stalliongrad_darkwing.8.d:0 "With the Congress of Stavropon finishing, the attending ponies have made a unified statement not as a political body, but as captains of industry, academic heads, cultural thought-leaders and union leaders, all addressing the presidium and the General Secretary.\n\nThe central role of the SCP since the revolution made its voice supreme, and due to this it has sometimes drowned out other voices. In the quest for political balance, academia has found itself curtailed in fields due to their findings making certain extremists accuse them of reactionary activity. Local factory managers and union leaders have found themselves needing to conform to various national level decisions and socialist doctrines instead of having room to adapt to local conditions. International trade has been all but nonexistent and what little has managed to survive is forced to leap through countless hoops. The cultural sphere finds itself curtailed more than even before the revolution by the demand that it does not question the powers that be, and many of those most fervent critics of the old Duma now are expected to fawn over and praise the SCP to not rock the boat.\n\nTogether, these voices are calling for the reformation and liberalisation of the Severyanian system to ensure that the knowledge of its cultural, economic and scientific experts is not wasted due to political dogmatism. Severyana can still blossom even more if only its greatest minds are afforded the freedom to adapt and improve."
 stalliongrad_darkwing.8.a:0 "To Progress and to Freedom!"

 stalliongrad_darkwing.9.t:0 "The Open Hoof"
 stalliongrad_darkwing.9.d:0 "The ultraleftists were marginalised, and the Stavropon congress had created a political momentum that wasn't constrained by SCP dogma. Maybe it was too early to make the next move, but Dark Wing wasn't going to let the moment slip away. Right now, more than ever before, Severyana was pliable, and he studied the letter he had written and rewritten a dozen times by now.\n\nAddressed to Princesses Celestia and Luna, it informed them that Severyana was willing to reopen negotiations regarding the relationship between the two nations. Throwing in some references to the Hearthswarming Miracle, he signalled that he was hoping for more than just rapproachment. The implications would be clear; if Equestria played her cards right, Severyana might come back to them. Not as a constituent nation, that was much too bold a thought, but as an aligned nation for sure.\n\nDark Wing had never been very enthusiastic about the idea of Severyanian independence. There was a reason the last Tsar had given up his crown to Celestia, and whatever blame one laid at her hooves, she had overseen a thousand years of stability whereas Severyana had managed a dozen before they began killing each other in the streets. In little more than a decade, the revolution had become a deity, and the ultras were its prophets fighting the heretics. At least the Sun would not want to kill him.\n\nSeveryana had proved how easy it was to fall to political infighting and violence, and even if many ponies would not be humbled by it, Dark Wing was. It was time to offer a chance to make amends, and try a different path. They could call him whatever they liked, he was long past caring what violent zealots and murderers thought of him."
 stalliongrad_darkwing.9.a:0 "Sent in greatest secrecy, the letter reached Canterlot three days later."
    
 stalliongrad_darkwing.10.t:0 "To the Sovereigns of Equestria, Princesses Celestia and Luna."
 stalliongrad_darkwing.10.d:0 "I have been advised by many of my peers that writing this letter is not only an exercise in futility, but a betrayal of those who died when we tore ourselves away from the Equestrian motherland. You are autocrats, they insist, and in doing this we will throw away all that we achieved and become once again slaves under distant, uncaring demigoddesses. I, perhaps naively, write with the intent to prove these ponies wrong. Though it would be delusional to deny the scars of our history and the blood that was spilled when we rose up, the actions taken by Princess Celestia during the revolution tells me that, despite what accusations may be levied against her, she stands in stark contrast to countless other autocrats who would have refused to stay their hoof where she did.\n\nThe division that has plagued the state of Severyana in recent times is no secret, nor has the grace and restraint shown by Canterlot gone unnoticed. Though we have been less than perfect neighbours since the division between us, this accusation cannot by any metric be levied against Equestria. What then should the course of Severyana be? Should it seem to foment unrest and further violence, or should it remember the oldest tales of our people, the tales that speak of division overcome by hope, and how trust forged unity and survival for all of ponykind? I am not a scholar enough to judge the veracity of these tales, but I can see the hoof that has remained outstretched to us, and I can recognise that bitter pride does not build a worthwhile future.\n\nAs General Secretary of Severyana, I hereby wish to affirm my government's desire to re-open negotiations regarding the relationship between our two nations. Though our shared past has been painful, wounds can heal, and scars can fade, if they are but given proper care.\n\n"Sincerely\nGeneral Secretary Dark Wing.""
 stalliongrad_darkwing.10.a:0 "Of course we shall hear you out!"

 stalliongrad_darkwing.11.t:0 "The Young Princess' Arrival"
 stalliongrad_darkwing.11.d:0 "The approaching train was pulled by a steam locomotive painted in vibrant colors, and in its wake, Severyana would be changed forever. Dark Wing took a steady, deep breath as it pulled into the station and came to a slow stop. He thought to himself that there was no turning back now as he saw movement inside the train. After a brief delay, six ponies stepped out of the lead cart, Dark Wing studying them quietly.\n\nThe six heroes of Equestria, Princess Twilight Sparkle and her friends. Heroes who had intervened in crisis after crisis during the last few years, and through their actions risen to become exemplars of the nation, indeed heroes of Harmony. They were barely more than fillies... or perhaps he was just too old. He came out of his reverie as Twilight Sparkle slowly came up towards him, awkwardly nodding in greeting.\n\n"Thank you for your invitation, General Secretary Dark Wing. We... we are not running late, are we?" Dark Wing realized he had been looming again and cleared his throat.\n\n"Not at all, Princess Sparkle," he assured her. "Welcome to Severyana. I am happy to receive you and your friends." He held out a hoof towards her to shake it. She reciprocated, thankfully, and he followed suit with her friends. "Please, let us head for your accommodations. There is much to discuss, but I am sure you'll want to rest after your journey." He followed them out to the waiting cars, actively focusing on keeping his face in check.\n\n"Did you not get enough sleep tonight because you were nervous?" Pinkie Pie was her name, Baker and Party Planner. She bounced up next to him, surprisingly fast, "We were nervous too! Twilight didn't sleep a wink because she was too busy-" Whatever she was about to say was cut off as Twilight, mortified, shoved a hoof in her face to stop her. The entire display left Dark Wing giving them a small smile."
 stalliongrad_darkwing.11.a:0 ""Thank you for your consideration, but I will be fine.""

 stalliongrad_darkwing.12.t:0 "The Issue of Severyanian Autonomy"
 stalliongrad_darkwing.12.d:0 "While neither side has even mentioned the idea of reestablishing the Duma and both sides have taken it for granted that the Severyanian Presidium will remain, the question of what the exact nature of the relationship between Severyana and Equestria remains unsolved. The presidium has pushed for maintaining as much autonomy as possible, and want the Equestrian interference in Severyanas affairs to be kept at an absolute minimum. Any deference to Equestria should be purely technical, and Severyana should have the final say in all laws and agreements it accepts.\n\nEquestria, meanwhile, is hoping for Severyana to actually integrate into the Equestrian sphere instead of merely technically. This will demand that Severyana make certain concessions regarding its laws and its autonomy, and would make the Dark Wing, in essence, "Minister of Severyana". Equestria has guaranteed that the only Minister Severyana sees is the one it elects for itself, but it is still a hard sell.""
 stalliongrad_darkwing.12.a:0 "Minister of Severyana Dark Wing it is."
 stalliongrad_darkwing.12.b:0 "The Presidium will remain separate and have the final say."

 stalliongrad_darkwing.13.t:0 "The Development Exchange Programme"
 stalliongrad_darkwing.13.d:0 "Already before the revolution, the Severyana ponies' technical acumen was well known, and during it, Severyana's improvised armored vehicles changed warfare forever. The topic of these inventions and technical development was inevitably going to become a hot-button issue. The presidium has pushed for maintaining Severyana's technical institutes separate from Equestria's, and that if technology is shared, it will only be after prior authorisation from the presidium.\n\nIn the other end, Equestria is pushing for complete scientific integration as keeping the two nations apart will only weaken them both. Severyana has benefitted enormously from Equestrian development as well, and Equestria entertains no plans on limiting Severyana's access. All they ask for is reciprocity."
 stalliongrad_darkwing.13.a:0 "There is no reason to keep our systems separate."
 stalliongrad_darkwing.13.b:0 "For now at least, we will approve technological sharing on a yearly basis."

 stalliongrad_darkwing.14.t:0 "The Expansion of Private Ownership"
 stalliongrad_darkwing.14.d:0 "Equestria guarantees its ponies wide-ranging rights, including property rights, and Celestia has always been loath to interfere with this. This became part of why the revolution erupted, as so much wealth had been focused in the hooves of the Duma and other nobles. Yet, if Severyana is to align itself with Equestria, this must be addressed. Compromise can only reach so far, and the Presidium is pushing hard for keeping a cap on private ownership to ensure that there cannot ever again be the kind of concentration of wealth that sparked the uprising.\n\nDue to the sensitivity of the topic, Equestria has been modest with their demands. They request that instead of a strict cap, Severyana entertains the idea of progressive taxation that caps out at 90%. As much as they respect Severyana's reservations regarding personal wealth, mass seizures of property is a step too far for them, and would mean that they would abandon many ponies in southern Severyana to have their property seized."
 stalliongrad_darkwing.14.a:0 "Progressive taxation it is, but we set the tax brackets."
 stalliongrad_darkwing.14.b:0 "The cap will remain in place, but we will discuss compensations."

 stalliongrad_darkwing.15.t:0 "The Reparations Debate"
 stalliongrad_darkwing.15.d:0 "The final and most infected question of the negotiations concern reparations for those who suffered during the revolution. To many Severyanians, the concept of paying reparations to the wealthy elites that starved them for centuries is as absurd as it is obscene. The Presidium has instead suggested continuing to pay pensions to their own wounded and widowed, and are asking that Equestria pays the old landowners themselves if they view the matter as so important.\n\nEquestria is adamant that Severyana reconsiders. If the goal is to find reconciliation, the reparations are too important to be left aside. The majority of those affected by the revolution were not landowners, but regular ponies who fled their homes to escape the fighting. If the wounds are to heal, both sides must be committed to giving compensation to those who suffered."  
 stalliongrad_darkwing.15.a:0 "We will pay all that is asked, and Equestria will do the same."
 stalliongrad_darkwing.15.b:0 "We will pay a standardised sum per pony, but that is all we can offer."

 stalliongrad_darkwing.16.t:0 "The Signing of the Severyanian-Equestrian Accords"
 stalliongrad_darkwing.16.d:0 "He really did not have a face for smiling Dark Wing thought as he looked at the newspaper. No wonder Sladkaya had always said he 'loomed', the smile he was wearing on the picture looked almost forced. Yet, he had felt happiness at that moment, or at least satisfaction. Severyana and Equestria were now aligned, with Severyana formally having joined the UPA and started to reintegrate into the Equestrian economic sphere.\n\nYet at the same time, its independence was guaranteed, and Equestria would undertake no actions to challenge it. Only a majority vote by the Severyanian people would change this, and no such vote could happen for at least three years. Additionally, Equestria would not interfere with the organisation or advocacy of any socialist groups as long as they were not espousing violence. Severyana meanwhile would not seek to overthrow the Equestrian government, not work against it. Of course, that rule applied to the government, and not the Severyanian unions. Celestia's disciple had not had it in her to try to demand that the ponies of Severyana would be politically quarantined.\n\nSeveryana once again walked side by side with Equestria, only now its people would have absolute freedom to advocate and organise unions, protests, marches and strikes across Equestria. Any infringement on this would violate the accords, and he remembered the despair in Celestia's eyes at the end of the revolution and  the signing of the peace treaty. If Celestia let Severyana go over this, she would have proven to herself that she was like any old tyrant, more concerned with stability than with her little ponies. Dark Wing planned to exploit this to the fullest."

 stalliongrad_darkwing.17.d:0 ""I know this must have been hard for you," the princess told Dark Wing as they stood on the balcony overlooking the city. Mugs of warm tea as well as the hearty dinner they had enjoyed kept them warm in the cool evening. "You've gone against many of your comrades from what I hear. Comrades who still believe in this whole project. To abandon it takes a strong pony."\n\n"What project are we seeking to abandon?" Dark Wing asked before taking a sip of his tea. "Do you mean the socialist project? The problems that Caramel Marks wrote about have not gone away. We want to restore our bonds with Equestria, but that doesn't mean we will stop fighting for the common pony."\n\n"But princess Celestia addressed them," Twilight objected. "In the wake of the revolution she ordered reforms across Equestria. She established welfare programs, shored up labour rights. It took time, I know, but she came around. It didn't have to be this way..."  Dark Wing looked at her for a few seconds, deathly silent, before sighing.\n\n"Be very careful here. She was our monarch, and we spent decades, centuries, starving because she could not act in time. Generations lived and died in poverty because she played a great game of balance. What would you tell those hungry and downtrodden? 'Suffer in silence, for in time, surely the eternal monarch will do something'? Do you understand what an insult that is for those who learn to boil tree roots and mix bark into their flour to make it last? We won't - cannot - go back to being nothing but sedate subjects. We are empowered to take charge of our fate, and we have the scars to show what happens when you don't do that. She did more for us than any other monarch would have, we remember that, but we also remember how she failed us." He leaned in closer to her, staring her down, "Is that unacceptable to Equestria? Must our return be followed by absolute subjugation? Carefully consider that, Iskorka, for it will determine what happens going ahead.""

 stalliongrad_darkwing.18.t:0 "The Three Betterments" #The Three Betterments 
 stalliongrad_darkwing.18.d:0 "Dark Wing had spent years being subtle about his actual beliefs. With madmares like Norushkina on the opposing side, it had been a matter of survival. There were only a few who had been privy to his true beliefs, all of them trusted ponies such as the Gearin siblings, his fellow civil servant Beryozkina, the entrepreneur Ryabinka and lastly, Maxim Mukhomorov. All of them ponies he had known since before the revolution and who had been there to discuss with him before he needed to start keeping his cards so close to his chest. He had defined his own political program only where it was necessary, preferring to make as much of an imprint on Karamelka's as possible. She had been a kindred spirit in that sense, and they had found accord around many of his ideas, enough that he hadn't even really needed to publicly state his own platform.\n\nOf course, now that all had changed. Karamelka was out of politics, likely forever, and Dark Wing no longer could rely on her to be the face of his ideas. The new face was called 'The Three Betterments', defining what he wanted to accomplish around three main pillars; a better system, a better industry and a better future. It was short and punchy, easy to remember, but inside of it he had defined in greater detail what he wanted to accomplish and how. Also, they were broad enough to apply both in Equestria and in Severyana. Unlike Karamelka he had not lost faith that peaceful change could be induced in Equestria.\n\nFor a second he stopped, looking up at the ceiling as he remembered the eraser Karamelka had lobbed at his head before the twelfth congress to snap him out of his reverie. If she only had seen sense... While he never had doubted the necessity of stabbing her in the back... " 
 stalliongrad_darkwing.18.a:0 "...he did regret the necessity."

 stalliongrad_darkwing.19.t:0 "A Better System" #A better system
 stalliongrad_darkwing.19.d:0 "Dark Wing had been involved in the civil service for some thirty-odd years at this point, and if there was anything he knew, it was how flawed any government was if you looked deep enough. Centuries of traditions, customs and institutions established by different governments did not make for one unified whole, but rather a house of cards where every card leaned against several others. Things fell by the wayside, was bounced from one department to another, fell under arcane old laws or sometimes just got ignored for the sake of expediency.\n\nThe revolution had offered a promise in that regard, a promise of a clean slate. With the Duma and all the old traditions and laws done away with, there had been hope for a better political system. Yet, civil and bureaucratic reform had not been prioritised. There had been other issues, more short-term such, to consider, and over time the goverment had made itself comfortable. Wheatin's big tent SCP had not given much room for implementing changes without bickering about it for weeks on end, especially when some members had viewed their system with religious fervour.\n\nThe government, like everything, was malleable, and it had to be aware of its own flaws. Democracy was not a on-off button, 'justice' was an entirely subjective term, the list went on. A government that did not recognize this and which did not work to refine itself was one doomed to stagnation, and in stagnation waited tyranny."

 stalliongrad_darkwing.20.t:0 "A Better Industry" #A better industry
 stalliongrad_darkwing.20.d:0 "Of all the insane ideas that the more fervent left wing socialists had dragged up in previous years, the idea of political officers overseeing how the industries of Severyana were run had been a particularly vexing one. The idea had been to ensure that the factory managers did not adopt 'reactionary management methods'. He distinctly recalled how Mitya Gearin had been near chewing on the furniture in frustration after having spent weeks dealing with that project before it was thankfully cancelled.\n\nAs he always had known, and as the ultraleftists had had to find out the hard way, Cogs and engines did not care for political doctrine. The most effective methods would show themselves not through doctrinal purity, but through trial and error and industrial experiments. The role of socialism was to find ways to integrate best practices in a way that did not disenfranchise the workers, not to be the light that would guide the faithful to said practices.\n\nOne might call it technocracy, Dark Wing was not opposed to the label, but the fact remained that the beating heart of the modern world - its industry - was a complex beast that would change over and over again. While he could not for the life of him remember where he had heard the term, the phrase 'second industrial revolution' bounced around in his head as a description for the waves of new developments that spawned planes, mechanical calculators, tanks and similar inventions. The industry that produced these things was entirely different from the one that produced steam engines, trains and the likes - the things that stood as icons of the first industrial revolution.\n\nIf a second, might there not be a third, a fourth or indeed a fifth revolution? And would the labourers of the first industrial revolution have a home there? That was his concern, not socialist production methods."

 stalliongrad_darkwing.21.t:0 "A Better Future" #A better future
 stalliongrad_darkwing.21.d:0 "To be a socialist was to have hope; hope of something better, something more. To lock oneself away within the confines of one's nation to view all others as enemies was a betrayal of this hope. In doing so, you would cradle your own hope without sharing it, hoarding it when others went without. If you had benefited, should not others as well? When others starved, should they not have means to feed themselves? When others were lost, should they not be guided? Socialism had to be internationalist, lest it degenerated into nationalist pride in one's superior system.\n\nOn that point most of them had agreed, only that where some believed that blood and death was the only way, Dark Wing knew well that where sometimes that sword was called for, other times the pen would serve better. Equestria lay open for them, and the Equestrians valued harmony and friendship. So why not give them both? Flood their markets with Severyanian goods, teach their young colts and fillies to argue for socialist ideals, build side by side and through all this find every little crack in the Equestrian paradise to push against it and demand change.\n\nDark Wing did not hate Celestia, he respected her, but she was flawed. Of course she was, she was a thousand-year immortal who presided over a rapidly changing country. The system built around her was inherited from old tyrants, and her gentle hoof was insufficient to push for the changes necessary. Blood had flowed since she had indulged the duma for too long, and only afterwards had she enacted change across Equestria. This pattern would repeat again and again unless he could force her hoof.\n\nAs for those other leaders? The tyrants and reactionaries who would rather crush the socialist dream with arms? Simple, if they wanted war they would have it, and Severyana would still stand on the side of those fighting for the workers' freedom and dignity."

 stalliongrad_darkwing_great_war.0.d:0 "Dire news have reached us from the far west of Equus, where Queen Chrysalis is marshalling the Changeling hives. Her target; Equestria, and with that Severyana. The Presidium called an emergency session the instant news broke, and general Elytra was called to testify before it. As a survivor of the changeling unification wars, she could give a more in depth analysis of what to expect than most, and her prognosis was grim.\n\nWhere the Equestrian Royal Guard had shown restraint during their advances to avoid civilian casualties, Chrysalis' changelings would gladly open fire with everything they had. Where the royal guard had tried to end the fighting with a minimum of casualties, Chrysalis would seek to maximise them. The royal guard numbered a few thousands, Chrysalis' army in the tens or indeed hundreds of thousands. All in all, Equestria was facing down a vast army of countless thousands of hard-bitten, ideologically motivated soldiers who saw ponies only as cattle, commanded by a monster who'd gladly burn the continent to the ground in order to rule it.\n\nAfter her testimony, Dark Wing addressed the presidium to ask what Severyana should do. A darkness unlike any other was gathering on the distant horizon, and gentle Equestria would soon bear the brunt of this tyrant among tyrants' ambitions. Should Severyana withdraw from the [EQS.GetFactionName] and hope for mercy, or should they - like they did in 996 - face the bleak reality that awaited them with grim determination and desperate fury? Should they cower in fear, or should they rush to their gentle southern cousins' side, and if so need be carry the fight until the Equestrians could get ready? Should they falter alone, or should they triumph together?"

We stand along our Equestrian brothers and sisters, hardened by the trials that we've endured and ready to fight - together - to the bitter end."

 stalliongrad_darkwing_great_war.2.d:0 "The revolution had been bloody. Though Equestria's response had been measured, and the Royal Guard had fought to minimize casualties, Severyana had still buried so many ponies in the aftermath. During the victory celebration, they had published the name of all the dead, a list that had taken up an entire page of fine text in the newspapers.\n\nCasualties against the changelings were now approaching a hundred times that.\n\nAll the death of the revolution, all the suffering, was a single percentage point in the horrific carnage unfolding on the front lines. The Changelings fought mercilessly, with cold, calculating malice and absolutely no interest in restraint. Though the ponies stood united, and though their entire alliance worked as hard as they could to turn the tide, the price still towered above them in its gruesome totality. When would it even end? How many more did he have to send to their graves? Dark Wing couldn't help but envision himself pouring the lives of Severyanian stallions and mares down into a grinder, trying to make it stop but only pouring and pouring more and more.

Tanks could stride through artillery fire, shrugging off all but direct hits. Trenches could give sanctuary from all but the heaviest shells, and the list went on. Artillery was the queen of the battlefield, but when the queen became complacent, she would fail in her duties. Elytra appreciated the irony, or at least coincidence, of that statement.\n\nThe usage of artillery demanded discipline and precise calculations, not just targeting a general area and shooting until things stopped moving. To wield artillery was not a strategy, it was a science of geometry, trigonometry and ballistics, which all came together so that a skilled enough artillerypony would be able to wield their cannon with precision enough to hit even singular tanks, and a hundred artillery pieces would be able to fire in such perfect synchronisation that all their shells landed within a few seconds of each other. The more precise and synchronized artillery was, the more it could be wielded as one, and the more it could be wielded as one..."

Through the tartarus of the battlefield, in the sweltering steelyards and factories, on the railroads, dockyards and airfields they all worked together for the greatest of cause; freedom from tyranny and the sanctity of their lands and homes.\n\nIn a broadcasted speech, Dark Wing has addressed the Severyanian ponies to praise them for their victory, for the victory belongs to them. No high minister, distant princess or lone hero delivered ponykind in this dark hour. Rather it was the average pony, the workers and farmers, that stood up and fought. Without them, there would have been no victory, and no matter what else comes to pass, no matter what leaders claim this or that, and no matter what the world wants to tell them, the average pony is and remains the saviour of Equus."

We both remember that the old government was flawed, and that though we laboured to see it reformed, it was too little, too late.

He had told Pinwheel that some might take exception to the topic, but she had been determined.\n\n"I also wish to remind the audience that these debates are held in the spirit of good faith and mutual respect, and that this extends to the audience. Even if some may find this topic controversial, that is all the more reason to handle this in a friendly and constructive manner." He didn't use the old sergeant voice often, but when it did, it worked. Giving it over to the debate teams, he stepped aside to let them take the stage and quietly pondered how the world had changed. Severyana had been the reason he resigned from the royal guard, and now he sat here as his students held a debate on that very topic."

 stalliongrad_dark_wing_reform_stages.4.d:0 ""Would you say that the Severyanian experiment and the writings of Dark Wing has been an inspiration?" The newspony asked Soft Serve. When the icecream vendor out of nowhere had erected a communal bank it had raised quite a few eyebrows, especially when it was suddenly able to fund a new bridge over the local river.\n\n"Both yes and no, really." Soft Serve admitted. "See I had gone away to visit my family and shut down the stand, but the newspapers still got delivered and my customers came to buy them. When I came back, there was a large pile of money in the mailbox waiting for me. I had read some of those fliers on the train to Fillydelphia, and the writer talked about "taking responsibility for something without owning it". I decided to do something with it. We needed a new stove, and I took money from there and paid it back with ten percent interest, and well, then my neighbor needed money as well, he repaid his too, and it's grown ever since."n"An inspiring story indeed. Is this something you would say other ponies should do as well?"\n\n"Oh definitely! When everypony chips in, it's so easy to do the things that we need to do. We didn't have to wrangle a bank for weeks on end or wait for some company to show up. We were enough, and we could do it together!""

 stalliongrad_dark_wing_reform_stages.5.t:0 "To Princess Twilight Sparkle" 
 stalliongrad_dark_wing_reform_stages.5.d:0 "Thank you for your letter on the political developments in Equestria. I will not feign ignorance as to the source of these, it would be a waste of your time. I want to stress however that I have only ever spoken, written, given advice and supported the peaceful labour of those who wish to see change in Equestria. Nowhere have your laws been violated, and I have taken steps to ensure that none of the organisations we have supported violate the agreements reached.\n\nI stress this fact as the concern in your letter leaves me somewhat dismayed. I know that you value the Equestrians' right to determine the course of their own lives, and for all creatures to become all they can be. Why then would this not extend to who should control the means of production of Equestria? Is it because you fear that the change will cause social upheaval? If so I wish to ask you the following; in a nation where a filly born into a family of wealth will get everything, and where ponies like you and Celestia labour so to bring those options to those less fortunate, are you truly upholding a just society, or are you merely putting a bandaid on an open wound?\n\nThe services rendered by Princess Celestia to ponykind are unequalled, and you have been a stellar student of her ways, yet when the systemic injustices inherited from the pre-Celestia era remain in place out of a desire to not cause upset, does that not mean that those who always were left behind remain so? And as the tragic events of 996 show, when a princess does not act preemptively, the suffering is magnified many times over.\n\nI understand well the worries you feel over the political winds that blow, but urge you to see the promise carried on them. Equestria's ponies call out for change, and where petty tyrants across the world answer with violence, Equestria's princesses have the chance to hear them, and live up to the ideals they represent."

The old stallion had uncermoniously sat down next to her a couple stops ago and when the socialite across the seating area had sniffed contemptuously, he had pounced in seconds. Having started off merrily chatting about this and that, he had soon turned the tables on the socialite's standoffish answers and begun picking them apart. In the end, the Manehattanite had stood up and left the seating area, leaving the old mushroom pony to cluck happily before looking to her.\n\n"You know what the best part about all this was?" he asked with a raspy laughter. "That's the horseapple that invited me to Manehattan to speak at his conference. I guess they thought just because I like my cider, I don't know how to talk and they could use me as a punching bag. Instead I get a free trip and a bunch of hoity-toity horseapples to buck around the room for an evening. Cider?" He asked as he held up a bottle to her."\n\n"If you're offering, thank you," Starlight said politely. Having just seen the old pony tearing somepony to shreds for two hours, she would rather not be on his bad side right now. "Are you from Severyana?"\n\n"Well I used to be from Equestria, now I'm from Severyana and for a while that was really really important but now it isn't as important any longer. Maybe I'll be from Equestria again some days. Borders are ridiculous anyway, we're all ponies until somepony draws a line and tells you those on the other side are bad... Anyway, a toast to ponies across the world, may we all transcend borders and nations one day!" the old mushroom pony offered a toast, and Starlight reciprocated the toast with a small grin."

The police officers, meanwhile, stepped up to the podium and addressed the speaker.\n\n"Mitya Gearin, you are under arrest." The lead policepony, a gangly stallion with a buzzcut, told the massive Severyanian. If he had respected some reaction, it probably was not a bark of loud laughter.\n\n"For what, precisely, snookums?" Mitya asked merrily, not moving from the podium.

Many of the present ponies joined in now, and the entire arrest turned more and more farcical as Mitya towered up to his full length, dwarfing the policeponies.\n\n"Now I don't know if you are an avid reader, snookums, but as you toss me into jail, make sure to look up the Severyanian-Equestrian Accords.

stalliongrad.132.t:0 "Sinister speaks against Changeling aggressors"
stalliongrad.132.d:0 "Comrades! The working people of Stalliongrad!\n\nWe face an enemy more terrible than bourgeois plutocracy. Monsters, whose motives are the same as those of an animal - endless hunger and bloodthirsty cruelty.\n\nThat is why today, our duty is not only to defend our motherland, but also bring the justice to this abomination by our sword.\n\nWithout the official declaration of war from the chitinous imperialists, their divisions have already entered our land. Now we must answer them with our steel determination.\n\nRemember who you are, proud Stalliongradians! We are a people who have thrown off the heavy chains of Equestrian exploitation. We have become a country of true democracy, freedom and order. Our technologies, our industry and our powerful weapons are famous all over the world. Knowing this, our cruel enemy intends to capture all our achievements. Bring it to yourself, just like a barbarian, as they really are.\n\nWe must show the true honour and courage of our people, trampling the invaders with the horseshoe straight into the swamps from which they all came. Our determination in the fight against the changeling swarm should be an example for every state in the world.\n\nAllow your rifle to carry the word about our righteous ideology through the counter strike to the abominable bug.\n\nThis is a sacred war; it is a war that under no circumstances could be failed. History always requires us to choose: life or death, freedom or slavery. Let the whole world see in our working people heroes who purge the whole continent from the aggression of those cruel creatures.\n\nStand strong and brave, comrades! We will prevail!"

stalliongrad.133.t:0 "Sinister speaks against Equestrian aggression"
stalliongrad.133.d:0 "Comrades! I want to announce the news as exciting as the great ones. Our righteous socialist country was attacked, and by these actions Equestria finally showed its true face - the disgusting face of the reactionary plutocracy.\n\nA great people such as the Stalliongradians cannot remain in suspense and we are proud to participate in this gigantic struggle which is destined to transform the world geographically, politically and spiritually. Truly, there is taking place today a formidable struggle between two worlds. Never has the history seen a similar drama, a drama in which we are now among the great leading characters.\n\nThe task of the hour is one and only one: To fight, to fight all together. The comradeship between us becomes closer day by day, becomes a way of common life. We are similar enough and different enough to understand each other, to esteem each other mutually, to fuse together all our energies, since the cause is one. No longer can distinctions be made; our enemies do not make any.\n\nThe Equestrian plutocracy are conducting this war with one sole purpose: They want to reduce the globe to the state in which Buffalo State is today. They want all of people to work in order to give the Equestrian Bourgeoisie an another millennium of another name of exploitation - a "Harmony". They want a world of slaves in order to guarantee for the Canterlot aristocracy their five daily digestions. They want to destroy Communism, and under this name they include all the movements such as include Starlight ideology that named as Equality...\n\nNow, comrades, we must fight for the living ones, fight for the future, but also for the dead. We must fight so that the sacrifice of our dead be not in vain, so that the sacrifice of those who fell in the revolutionary war.\n\nThey, the dead, imperiously command us to fight through till victory. We obey."

stalliongrad.134.t:0 "Sinister's speech against capitalist Equestria"
stalliongrad.134.d:0 "Comrades! Heroes of the revolution! Stallions and Fillies of Stalliongrad! An hour appointed by destiny has struck in the heavens of our Motherland.\n\nThe declaration of war has already been delivered to the ambassadors of Equestria. We go to battle against the plutocratic and reactionary "Harmony" of fake goddesses who, at every moment have hindered the advance and have often endangered the very existence of the Stalliongradian people.\n\nRecent historical events can be summarised in the following phrases: promises, threats, blackmail and sabotage. With you the entire world is witness that Communist Stalliongrad has done all that is possible to avoid the torment which is throwing our continent into turmoil; but all was in vain. It would have sufficed to revise the treaties to bring them up to date with the changing needs of the life of our nation and not consider them untouchable for eternity.\n\nBut now all of that belongs to the past. If now today we have decided to face the risks and the sacrifices of a war, it is because the honour, the interests, the future impose an iron necessity, since a great people is truly such if it considers sacred its own duties and not evade the supreme trials which change the course of history.\n\nWe take rifles in hooves to free the working people of all Equestria from exploitation and plutocracy, which in the minds of the masses is indestructible and endless.\n\nThis gigantic struggle is nothing other than a phase in the logical development of our revolution; it is the struggle of peoples that are poor but rich in workers against the exploiters who hold on ferociously to the monopoly off all the riches and all the gold of the world; it is the struggle between our century and two ideas.\n\nProletarian Stalliongrad stands up again, strong, proud, and united as never before. The single order of the day is categorical and obligatory for all. And this order is... Victory! And we will win, in order finally to give a long period of peace with justice to Stalliongrad, to Equestria, and to the world.\n\nComrades!\nThis is a war to end all wars!"

stalliongrad.135.t:0 "Sinister: Stalliongrad will liberate the people of [From.GetName]"
stalliongrad.135.d:0 "Comrades! I think history itself guides us to the role of the liberator of the [From.GetAdjective] proletariat. We, the people of Stalliongrad, see an opportunity to help the class struggle in this country by importing the revolution, strengthening the unity of the proletarians of all countries by destroying the [From.GetAdjective] exploiters.\n\nOnce we proclaimed ourselves as defenders of the poor and oppressed; and we bound ourselves by sacred duty. It is a duty to protect all the working people from oppression and violence. The time has come to fulfil our promises.\n\nPeople of [From.GetNameDef] will be glad to get rid of the chains of capital with the help of our brave people's army, and then replenish the ranks of fighters with the bourgeoisie of the whole world.\n\nLong live Stalliongrad! Long live the [From.GetAdjective] proletariat!\n\nLiberation is coming!"

 STG_ELYTRA_DESC:0 "Though born into the role of queen, Elytra had to flee the changeling lands after her hive was conquered by Chrysalis during the unification of the hives. Along with a small band of survivors, she fled as far away as she could and ended up in Severyana. Hiding among the ponies there, she and her former hivemates ended up dragged into the revolution as the ponies that had welcomed them took up arms. Elytra's military experience aided the revolutionaries greatly, and she was made an officer at the end of the war.\n\nAs an officer however, the inconsistencies in her background that had remained hidden came to light, and she was forced to reveal her true identity. Though her status as a royal has drawn suspicion, she was nevertheless allowed to keep her rank. She now serves to protect the only home she has."
 POLITICS_SINISTER_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: March 15, 971 ALB, Konzan\n\n§YBiography§!: Hailing from the city of Konzan, the life of Sinister Serov (or Sinnie to friends) has been one of constant restructuring and inventing. Born into a family of workers, and before that, peasants, Serov, despite being an earth pony, would take an active interest in magic and in the technological uses of it. First in his family to attain technical education as a machinist, a chance meeting between him and a friend would change the trajectory of his life.\n\nRecruited into the NELP in the summer of 995 by his friends, he would join the underground cell as their weaponsmith, a talent appreciated by his comrades, not so much by their enemies and would advance in the grades, managing the militias in Konzan during the revolution. Following the Revolution, he would rise through the ranks within the party, going from rank-and-file bureaucrat to member of the Supreme Soviet by 1001 as part of his promotion to a member of the People’s Commissariat of Economic Development. A promotion to the Central Committee in 1003 would soon follow, striking up a friendship with Vasiliy on the way to the current day.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
 ADVISOR_SINISTER_DESC:0 "Sinister does exercise pretty strict messaging control once he's committed to something though, but his flair and charisma are his strongest traits. He also has a bit of exaggerated self-esteem. Sinnie wants to keep all the things he can get his hooves on in order. He is an experienced technician, however, and can find himself in high-tech research.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
 POLITICS_VASILY_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: February 14, 969 ALB, Petershoof\n\n§YBiography§!: Vasiliy was born in a family of poor city officials. Reading became one of his hobbies since childhood, as he was able to visit the library and read parents' books while they were at work. After graduating from school, he attended Petershoof University, where he studied history and economics, eventually learning the ideas of Caramel Marks and accepting them. During the formation of the NELP he joined their "Young Guards" section. Vasiliy proved to be useful when spreading socialist agitation among his classmates and the workers of nearby factories.\n\nHe engaged in many workers' strikes and social protests in 994 ALB. During the December Revolution, the district organization of NELP under his leadership managed to take control of a major newspaper printing house. He was working in the Petershoof Soviet and was elected to be a member of the Severyanian delegation to negotiate with Equestrians in 995-996 ALB. In 998 ALB he was appointed in the Central Committee of the renamed SCP. During this period he became close friends with Sinister and helped Karamelka Sladkaya in organizing the education system in the Republic. After Stallion's death Vasiliy, Altydia, Sinister and several other leading members of the SCP kept supporting the passed leader's ideas of the development of the country and the revolution, thus leading the Majority of the Party. Since 1004 ALB he has been working as the General People's Representative in Education.\n\nVasiliy can be characterized as a smart pony, he can find an approach to many. However, it was a tough moment for him to choose between Sladkaya as a person and opposing her ideas as "right-wing deviation". While being a bit soft, he knows that his work is required for the good of the revolution and manages to deal with the lack of self-esteem by relying on the help of his party comrades and his friends, including Sinister.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

 POLITICS_ALTY_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 965 ALB, Severokholm\n\n§YBiography§!: Altidiya was born in the workers’ family and became a factory worker herself from childhood, worsing her health for years. She always wanted to change her life to the better and got interested in the ideas of Caramel Marks in youth.\n\nIn 981 she became a member of the Stallion’s “Union of Struggle for Justice” and was engaged in revolutionary activity. She was responsible for USJ’s and later the Labor Party’s activity in Southern Severyana, picking the pseudonyms "Alty Coggydeer" and “Comrade Revoltsova”. During the December Revolution and the following War of Independence she was organizing factories’ militias across the country. Altydia is one of the authors of the first tank projects, which helped Severyanian forces in advancing during the war.\n\nShe was elected representative of the factory she worked in in Severokholm and became a member of the Central Committee in 997. From now Altydia was responsible for re-organizing the party, becoming Stallion’s “left hoof”.\n\nShe became the General Secretary and the leader of the Supreme Soviet after Stallion’s death. Together with her other comrades, Altydia formed the leadership of the Majority of the Severyanian Communist Party. Revoltsova is a well-known organizer in the party, but as the time passes, many say that she is slowly giving back due to health problems and should be put on less responsible work or given a rest as party’s veteran.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
 POLITICS_CARAMELKA_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 945 ALB, Petershoof\n\n§YBiography§!: Karamelka Sladkaya was born in a family of weavers and clothes makers, setting the tone for the rest of her life. Her family had enough to get by daily, and she learned her parents' trade quickly, becoming fascinated with cloth, dye, and weaving. Soon she became a respected figure in the ports of the city, helping negotiate between the sailors, the craftsponies, and the traders going around the city's administration. \n\nIn the 980s, she became a leader in the Workers’ Association – a trade union federation, leading it to unification with USJ into the North-Eastern Labour Party. Near her 50th birthday, the city of Petershoof burst into flames as dissenting workers seized the city and declared the Commune. During the fighting to retake the city, Karamelka fled to Manehattan and began to write her works in socialist theory. A year after the Commune was crushed, Karamelka was officially pardoned by the Boyars for charges of treason, and they invited her to a meeting of reconciliation. Her presence at the netting was seen as a sign of progress, that is, until the trap was sprung. Karamelka only barely escaped the massacre of the labor leaders.\n\nAfter the revolution Karamelka was involved in organizing the education and cultural sphere in the Republic, as well as reforming the light industry. Steel Stallion soon passed away, and the choice of a new General Secretary had to be made. Karamelka, of course, put her hat into the ring. And while a considerable faction of the party backed her, a unity candidate, Altidya, won out in the end.\n\nDespite her age, many ponies find Karamelka to be quite attractive. Rumors claim that her jewelry has something to do with the ancient Severyanian magic, but Sladkaya keeps her secrets unrevealed.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

 POLITICS_DARK_WING_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 957 ALB, a small village outside Novoczernushsk\n\n§YBiography§!: Dark Wing was born to a well off farming family as the youngest foal of eight, He was considered the family’s pride due to his sharp mind and ambitious nature, the latter of which made him able to leave for Petershoof to study law after he impressed his teachers. During his student years, he came to sympathise with the USJ and later the NELP, however he avoided joining them as he held political ambitions. Taking a job as a clerk in the Duma, he chose to simply feed information to the socialists to try to advance their cause while also working to try to claim a seat in the Duma.\n\nDuring the revolution, Dark Wing was the eye of the socialists within the duma. As a high-ranking clerk, he had access to every decision they made, and he fed it all to the revolutionaries. He was the one who made sure the Pastilá Strike could happen, he warned the socialists of the ponyhunt that was about to begin, and when violence exploded, it was Dark Wing who had made sure the Duma’s response was as haphazard and disjointed as it was. Yet while he sympathized with the movement and believed in the ideas they espoused, Dark Wing was, and still is, a staunch believer in the ideals of Equestria.\n\nDespite his misgivings, he and his sympathizers continued to work with the movement to push for reconciliation, yet he soon found himself alienated from large parts of the movement, as he became viewed as a "last minute revolutionary" and "fence-sitter". His cooperation with Karamelka Sladkaya was in the end due to her being the only one willing to even entertain the idea.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"
 ADVISOR_DARK_WING_DESC:0 "To him, there's no point in drawing a distinction between Severyana and Equestria, and the revolution that saw it break away more culpable for their following troubles than most would accept. He saw a chance to affect change across all of Equestria thrown away for what seemed to him petty Severyanian nationalism, and the princess that could have listened had they given her a chance dismissed for illogical reasons."

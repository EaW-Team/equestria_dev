STG_12th_year_of_revolution:0 "Twelfth Year Of The Revolution"
STG_12th_year_of_revolution_desc:0 "When the ponies of Severyana rose up against the exploitation, back in 995, nopony had an exact idea how far we'd come. But under the guidance of our leaders, the revolution has not only endured, but prospered as well. Stalliongrad stands as a beacon of hope for all those wishing to escape unjust conditions imposed by capitalists and autocrats. Our work is far from done, however."
STG_international_secretariat:0 "#International Secretariat"
STG_problems_in_party:0 "Factions In Our Ranks"
STG_problems_in_party_desc:0 "While most agree that socialist thought and independence has brought more benefits than drawbacks, there is plenty of disagreement on how we should proceed. The revolution has not solved every problem we faced before 995, and many of our measures have been a temporary adjustment until the road can be paved for true communism."
STG_socialism_program:0 "The Socialist Program"
STG_socialism_program_desc:0 ""

STG_cominform:0 "Parties from Around the World"
STG_cominform_desc:0 "Communism is an international movement, and it seems our movement is finally catching on. We will begin sending out envoys to other Marksist, Marksist-Stallionist and Revolutionary Socialist parties to organise a conference to discuss and coordinate our efforts. Perhaps this could be the start of a true Communist International?"
STG_skynavia_kekw:0 "Visit to Skynavia"
STG_skynavia_kekw_desc:0 "The Skynavians may be unorthodox, and they may be tiny, but they are worth reaching out to. Who knows, perhaps they will have something interesting to say..."
STG_prywhen_why:0 "Assist Prywhen"
STG_prywhen_why_desc:0 "The Prywhenians have been fighting a protacted war for years against the tyrant King Kloseau, and while we know very little of what is going on there, we must send what aid we can to our comrades across the seas."
STG_Zebrica_4head:0 "The Arabian Revolution" #Don't touch before merge with Zebrica
STG_Zebrica_4head_desc:0 "Civil war has broken out in the once powerful state of Saddle Arabia. If the Arabian Popular Front can win, we will gain a powerful ally. We must send what aid we can to our comrades in Zebrica."
STG_only_thing_we_all_agree_on:0 "The Only Thing We All Agree On"

STG_commission_of_inner_policy:0 "Inner Policy Commission"
STG_commission_of_inner_policy_desc:0 "The principle of democratic centralism has gone unenforced in practice for some time now. While we cannot yet put an end to factionalism, we can clarify some internal policies to make it very clear which issues have already been decided."

STG_peasants_and_workers:0 "The Peasants and the Workers"
STG_peasants_and_workers_desc:0 ""
STG_petershoof_foreign_trade:0 "Open Petershoof for Foreign Trade"
STG_petershoof_foreign_trade_desc:0 "While the Equestrian blockade remains in place, our policy of Socialism in One Country has nonetheless born some fruit in that most other states no longer regard us as a pariah-state or dangerous zealots. Thus, we can now open the port of Petershoof to foreign trade, bringing in goods from Zebrica and Griffonia."
STG_amogus_trade:0 "Equestrian Shell Companies"
STG_amogus_trade_desc:0 "We maintain several shell companies and front operations within Equestria, working to siphon small funds back to Severyana and provide intelligence for our future operations. After years of buildup, we are ready to reap the benefits of these operations."
STG_state_warehouse_system:0 "State Reserve System"
STG_state_warehouse_system_desc:0 "Despite the current hardships, we must prepare for harder times still. The twin specters of war and hunger never sleep, and so we have organised a network of state-owned warehouses dotting the countryside, only to be opened when those specters again appear."
STG_another_year_of_stability:0 "Another Year of Stability"
STG_another_year_of_stability_desk:0 "Despite the factionalism within our ranks, the people of Stalliongrad can see that progress is being made and that the SCP's rule has brought relative stability. Slowly but surely we are coming together, and that in itself is worth celebrating."
STG_telegraph_agency:0 "Stalliongrad Telegraph Agency"
STG_telegraph_agency_desc:0 "The party leadership certainly can't agree on everything, this is to be expected. But if the common pony were to know of our disunity, they could start losing hope in the socialist dream. Ensuring that the right information is transmitted to the public, assisted by the principle of democratic centralism, would ensure that the popular perception remains positive towards the state."
STG_support_the_colhoz:0 "Support Collective Farms"
STG_support_the_colhoz_desc:0 "Many great and wonderful things can be achieved through simple cooperation. One of the primary tenets of Marks discusses reorganisation of privately owned farmland into a joined block, that would be provided by the state with modern tools for increased output. The mainstream thought within the SCP believes it to be a solution against further famine."
STG_draka_s_kulakami:0 "Continue Wealth Redistribution"
STG_draka_s_kulakami_desc:0 "Although the industrial revolution brought substantial progress and quality of life for many ponies in Equestria, it also solidified one of the greatest evils in history: capitalistic exploitation. Factory owners would glut themselves with profit while paying a pittance! The party is committed towards eliminating this injustice."

STG_about_freedom_and_unity:0 "Establish The Party Line"
STG_about_freedom_and_unity_desc:0 "An idea cannot be made into reality unless it has firm convinction behind it, and the easiest way to achieve that is by having ponies vouch in its favour. The SCP, nominally representing everycreature in Severyana, is showing signs of fracture as different party officials espouse their own plans for the future. Should this varied thinking be encouraged, or should we commit to a single goal?"
STG_reliable_center:0 "The Reliable Center"
STG_reliable_center_desc:0 ""
STG_send_in_sosister:0 "Send in Sinister"

STG_can_there_be_unity:0 "Can There be Unity?"
STG_can_there_be_unity_desc:0 ""

STG_commies_in_eqs:0 "Our Southern Comrades"
STG_commies_in_eqs_desc:0 "Once the revolution was successful, there was no more turning back time: similar movements rose up to prominence in Griffonia, and unconfirmed rumours suggest that even down in Zebrica there is a growing socialist population. But our focus should be closer to home - what to do with the vanguard located in Baltimare, Vanhoover, Manehattan and other major Equestrian cities?"
STG_socialism_in_one_country:0 "Socialism In One Country?"
STG_socialism_in_one_country_desc:0 "The chains must be broken, and any worker, be they pony, thestral, griffon or other deserves a decent life, their voice taken into account, to take pride in their fruits of labour. But how can Stalliongrad assist in spreading the socialist ethos abroad, if we cannot claim with certainty that the revolution is secure at home?"
STG_red_army_structure:0 "The Red Army Debate"
STG_red_army_structure_desc:0 "Our struggle for freedom was certainly bloody, but owing to the typical peaceful mindset, Stalliongrad has not faced a serious external threat since 995. But as the world situation further develops, the Red Army must be prepared to meet the challenge. For now, we must discuss and figure out its organisation and how to implement it in the near future."
STG_reminats_of_fleet:0 "Remnants Of The Royal Navy"
STG_reminats_of_fleet_desc:0 "The port of Petershoof was the location of the first uprising in 991, and it remained favourable to the ideas of revolution despite many suppressive crackdowns. As such, when the fighting continued in 995, many warships of the Equestrian Royal Navy were seized and turned against their uncaring masters. However, naval matters have rarely been given the time of the day, and we must modernise to keep up."
STG_reorganize_the_industry:0 "Industrial Buildup"
STG_reorganize_the_industry_desc:0 "Stalliongrad's stability comes from the workers, and it is our utmost duty to ensure all who have placed their hearts and minds towards a socialist future have the means of participating in it. However, resources are stretched thin and we cannot simply open a factory after factory, for obvious reasons. Several competing development plans have emerged in the SCP, and should be given a discussion."
STG_scp_congress:0 "Tenth Party Congress"
STG_scp_congress_desc:0 "The SCP will once more be meeting in its official capacity, to discuss important matters of state. Most are interested, however, whether Vasily Pantsushenko's ideas for Stalliongrad will convince the various opposing factions within the party to cooperate. The winds of change might change Severyana's course, or things could remain the same. The party will make its decision."
STG_status_quo:0 "Status Quo In The Party"
STG_status_quo_desc:0 "The party has not reached agreement. The opposition has not been impressed with Vasily's speeches, and according to protocol, further debates will be held. We remain resolute that a consensus will be reached, for everypony holds a personal stake in Stalliongrad. It can and will be found."
STG_unity_in_party:0 "Unity Has Been Achieved"
STG_unity_in_party_desc:0 "Much to everypony's surprise, Comrade Vasily's proposals have each been met with the required majority needed for approval. He will certainly now rise to the position of General Secretary, and his ideas will guide and shape Stalliongrad for the time being. We all expect the glory of the revolution to remain unextinguishable, to spread wherever a worker remains oppressed and unfree."

STG_nothing_is_changed:0 "Nothing Has Changed"
STG_nothing_is_changed_desc:0 "Despite the best efforts of Vasily and his allies, the SCP is still a factionalized mess. This situation cannot go on forever, as while we bicker and argue our ponies lose confidence in us and our agricultural situation deteriorates."
STG_sysem_of_goszakaz:0 "Implement A System Of State Orders"
STG_sysem_of_goszakaz_desc:0 "The food and industrial situation is becoming too dire to let procedural correctness get in the way of a solution. Gensec Altidiya will implement a series of state orders, bypassing the Supreme Soviet and getting our economy back on track, or at least buying us a little more time."
STG_prodrazverstka:0 "Food Stocks Audit"
STG_prodrazverstka_desc:0 "We need to find out exactly how much time we have. We will send out auditors to the farms, collective and private, and to the village granaries to determine how close we are to disaster."
STG_countinue_kolhoz_support:0 "Provide Support for Collective Farms"
STG_countinue_kolhoz_support_desc:0 "All factions can agree that we need to subsidize the collective farms to secure our food supply. It is a stopgap situation, but for now it will help those in need."
STG_skaynavia_delegates:0 "Send Delegates to Skynavia"
STG_skaynavia_delegates_desc:0 "The Socialist Republic of Skynavia has finally overcome their own internal divisions, at least for the moment, and is beginning to secure their situation. We should contact these comrades across the sea, and set up trade relations with one of the few other countries in the world which share at least most of our ideals."
STG_atyldia_muhozhuk:0 "Suspicious Silence"
STG_atyldia_muhozhuk_desc:0 "General Secretary Altidiya Kobylkova has prepared a speech exhorting the SCP to find common ground. At the end of it, she will announce her plans to resign just before the next party congress, both for her health and because a GenSec election at the next congress may be the only way to shake the SCP out of its stalemate."
STG_save_revolution:0 "Save Our Revolution"
STG_save_revolution_desc:0 "The majority is either too unaware or too unwilling to stop the left faction's takeover. Our revolutionaries will storm the Supreme Soviet, dissolve Altidiya's weak government, and declare a national emergency. We will secure the revolution."
STG_fire_on_right:0 "Fire to the Right"
STG_fire_on_right_desc:0 "Dark Wing, Psychic Sigil, Karamelka Sladkaya, the whole rightist faction have done nothing but stall the revolution. With the true revolutionaries in control, we will round them all up to await their trials for betraying the revolution. Some will be released, some will be expelled, some will be imprisoned or shot, but for now they will be out of the way."
STG_sinnie_purge:0 "Serov's Purge"
STG_sinnie_purge_desc:0 "Sinister knows Vasily Pantsuschenko better than anypony, and he knows that Vasily will not support a coup, no matter how righteous. For the time being, we will keep him and the other leaders of the Majority under house arrest, so that they cannot derail our course."
STG_sinnie_leatherman:0 "The Grey Cardinal"
STG_sinnie_leatherman_desc:0 "Masha Norushkina's provisional government cannot last forever. Fortunately, Sinister Serov is ready to lead the revolution. We will call an emergency party congress to appoint Sinister Serov as general secretary of Stalliongrad."
STG_time_for_breakthrough:0 "Time To Make a Breakthrough"
STG_time_for_breakthrough_desc:0 "The time of weakness and indecision is over. With our enemies absent and more and more of the majority coming over to our side, the Supreme Soviet has confirmed Sinister as our new leader. Now, the real revolutionary work begins."
STG_revolutionary_order:0 "Bring the Revolutionary Order"
STG_revolutionary_order_desc:0 "With the rightist faction out of the way, Masha and Sinister will approach Vasily Pantsuschenko to legitimate their new program in an emergency session of the SCP congress. Surely, they will see our point of view."
STG_Vasya_unity:0 "Ending the Uncertainty"
STG_Vasya_unity_desc:0 "We have dealt with the ultra-left plot, and despite being shaken by his friend's betrayal Vasily Pantsuschenko is ready to lead us forward, into a new era."
STG_time_to_offensive:0 "Time to Start the Offensive"
STG_time_to_offensive_desc:0 "The last few years have been a tumultuous time for our republic, but the SCP now stands united in purpose, galvanized by having almost lost it all.

STG_save_democracy:0 "Save Our Democracy"

STG_end_of_discussions:0 "End Of Discussions"

### EVENTS #####
stalliongrad.1.t:0 "Home of the Revolution"
stalliongrad.1.d:0 "The story of socialism in Severyana begins in 940s, when unicorn mare named Caramel Marks and her friend and colleague – Fire Angel, a griffon – decided to settle in the region after their long travel across Equestria, seeking to observe how the nation was changing in the wake of the industrial revolution. They saw the North-Eastern Autonomy as the region, where class contradictions were the strongest. It's here where they created the Union of Struggle for Justice – an underground organization that will fight against injustice.\n\nThey weren't able to see the fruits of their labor, however. Caramel Marks died in 954 ALB, and Fire Angel fled to Skyfall, where he promoted the ideas of Marksism to the broad griffon masses.\n\nBut they laid the seeds through their organisations and ideas, which would culminate in the alliance of Karamelka Sladkaya's "Workers' Association" and USJ, led by Steel Stallion. The two of them would break the stagnation and create the North-Eastern Labour Party, a precursor to the modern day Severyanian Communist Party (SCP). Thus the following events were inevitable: the Petershoof uprising, Pastilá Strike, declaration of the Republic of Severyana – the first nation to become independent from Equestria for centuries – followed by the Revolutionary War, when the first tanks were deployed in battle, and resulting in freedom and independence.\n\nWhat is left to be done? Shortly after the revolution, "Reconstruction Period" was proclaimed by Stallion, aimed at gathering power and resources for the future socialist construction. But even after twelve years, the revolution has not yet entrenched itself in Severyana, largely known as Stalliongrad. Ponies, thestrals, griffons and others live in much better conditions than they ever did under Celestia, but after the death of Steel Stallion, his party stands at the crossroads. Various socialist movements have sprung up beyond the borders of Severyana, and very few have achieved success compared to ours. If the workers are to be liberated, and petty bourgeoisie destroyed as a class, then we have much work ahead of us."
stalliongrad.1.a:0 "Long Live the Republic!"

stalliongrad.2.t:0 "A Party Divided"
stalliongrad.2.d:0 "Our great leader, the Founding Father of the Republic, has always taught the communists to stay strong and united. However, after Steel Stallion's death in 1003, the situation in the SCP has deteriorated.\n\nThe majority of the Party, led by prominent ponies, follows his line: reconstructing the economy, preparing to build socialism, helping the communists and the progressive forces abroad. Altydia "Alty Coggydeer" Revoltsova, Stallion's "left hoof", has managed to become the new General Secretary of the Party.\n\nNot all the comrades, however, agree with the line. Facing the current difficulties, they think a different line should be taken. The problems of trade, agriculture, and economic planning stil plague us, and though we have had twelve years to muster it, the Red Army is still hardly a mighty force.\n\nWhile the majority of the party still believes in the program set out by Steel Stallion, the opposition factions have pointed to our failures to solve the problems brought on by the December Revolution as evidence that a major change of course is needed. They seem to become more and more popular both among some workers who have lost the optimism of the early days and among young socialists full of starry-eyed idealism and yearning to recapture the true spirit of revolution.\n\nWith factionalism, clashing egos, infighting and bureaucracy stymieing efforts at implementing long-term solutions, party unity has become the number one issue. For without unity, none of the other problems can be solved, and the revolution will never be able to move forward."

stalliongrad.10001.t:0 "Majority"
stalliongrad.10001.d:0 "The Majority is not officially a faction, but in the leadup to the Tenth Party Congress they have become tired of the infighting and are ready to move forward, rallying around a triumvirate of prominent figures to bring unity to the party.\n\nPremier Vasily Pantsushenko is the leader, and many hope that he will one day become General Secretary. Long thought of as a policymaker above factional conflict, he has come out strongly against disunity and revisionism in the party, arguing that the SCP must remember its purpose and serve the people and the revolution rather than their private interests. He has announced that he will propose an ambitious program of unity and anti-corruption measures at the next Congress.\n\nThe second figure is Gold Muffin, the Changeling revolutionary. He was also considered a figure who did not engage in factionalism, instead serving as a voice of comradeship, reconciliation, and compromise among the different factions. He is vital to holding the majority together, and creating lasting unity after the Congress should they succeed.\n\nThe final figure is the most controversial: the firebrand, Sinister Serov. A dangerous pony, many blame him for the Winter Revolution being so bloody, and he has flirted with the ultra-left opposition. However, it seems his deep friendship with Vasily has caused him to throw his support behind Vasily's program, at least for now, and his charismatic appeals have swayed many on-the-fence party members. Only time will tell if this coalition will last."

stalliongrad.11002.t:0 "The Opposition. Right Wing"
stalliongrad.11002.d:0 "Since Steel Stallion's death, opposition factions have formed. They vote together, consistently support each other, and frequently reopen debates which were previously closed, skirting the principle of democratic centralism and aggravating the party's indecisiveness. The main opposition factions are the rightists and the ultra-leftists. While they both agree on preserving their ability to oppose the majority and frequently vote together on administrative and procedural issues, they could not be more different in terms of their ultimate aims.\n\nThe rightists, led by the universally-respected Karamelka and the universally-despised Dark Wing, advocate consolidating the NEP and an approach of "new thinking" and "openness," whereby they would reintroduce some capitalist elements into the Stalliongrad economy and pursue a thaw in relations with Harmonist neighbours, with the goal of slowly spreading socialist ideas in Equestria. They maintain that under their program, our productive capacities and standard of living would leapfrog past Equestria, and in the long term socialism would become more popular than if we hold strictly to Marksist orthodoxy.\n\nThe ultra-left faction on the other hoof has no official leader, but is generally dominated by radical general Masha Norushkina. They argue Steel Stallion did not go far enough, and that the NEP should be immediately scrapped and collectivisation accelerated. They also advocate for massive military buildup, a drastic reduction in bureaucracy, and immediate preparation for total war with Equestria to bring the revolution by force."

stalliongrad.11003.d:0 ""I still cannot believe you threw in your lot with Vasily," grumbled Natasha, "Where were those 'Socialism in One Country' types when you were fighting on the streets of Ditrysium?"\n\n"Well if I recall correctly, at the time Vasya was trying to keep the schools running and Altidiya was keeping you all fed."\n\nMuffin took a sip of his soup as emphasis. "Your wife truly does make amazing Okroshka, my friend," Muffin noted, "It has been too long since we saw each other."\n\n"Well," said Natasha, levitating a glass of wine to her mouth, "Politics takes up a lot of time, for both of us. Gold Muffin the Earthpony."\n\nMuffin grinned. When he first came to Stalliongrad, he'd disguised himself as a pony and adopted the name "Gold Muffin" as a cover identity, not knowing if Stalliongrad would welcome a changeling. Natasha had taken him in and shown him around, and she and Vasily had embraced him when he'd revealed his true nature.\n\n"So," Natasha declared, "You want me to support Vasily too. I understand why, you've always advocated unity, but I joined Comrade Masha for a reason. I'm still not quite convinced."\n\n"I understand," said Muffin, "And I won't force you. But I do hope you'll join us. When I first arrived here, while Steel Stallion was still alive, there was this optimism and comradeship in the air. I haven't felt hungry for Love in years. Now though... everypony is becoming entrenched in their factions. The grievances and feuds have piled up. I fear if Vasya fails, that spirit will vanish and never return.""

stalliongrad.11004.t:0 "Sinister and farmers" #Danielle suggested
stalliongrad.11004.d:0 ""And what, comrades, have the Rightist faction ever done for you?" Sinister demanded. He was giving a speech at a rural Soviet, which despite representing the farmers of a collective farm had sent a rightist delegate to represent them at the higher levels of the Soviet Republic. One of them had invited Sinister to the barn where they held their meetings, and he had done a fairly good job of convincing them to replace their delegate.\n\n"Well," said one of the farmers, an old pegasus stallion, "There was the NEP. Not sure how we'd've kept us all fed without the NEP." Murmurs of ascent. Sinister knew he had to do something.\n\n"The NEP!" Sinister railed, "A system which lets wealthy kulaks hoard grain whenever they wish, lets them get all the best equipment and leaves none for you. The NEP turns a blind eye to anti-Soviet elements and wreckers in our midst! Comrades, the NEP is not the solution, the NEP is the problem!"\n\nSinister had nothing else to say. He'd raised the stakes so high that the only question left was whether they believed him."
stalliongrad.11004.a:0 "When their delegate returned the next morning, she was out of a job."
stalliongrad.11004.b:0 "Sinister was booed out of the barn."

stalliongrad.11005.t:0 "A Tense Dinner" #Danielle suggested
stalliongrad.11005.d:0 ""Comrade Sladkaya," said General Masha Norushkina, "I assume you have brought me here to discuss Vasily's plan?"\n\n"Of course, Vampirenok," said Karamelka, referring to Masha by her nickname, "Please, sit down." Masha sat down stiffly, thanking the waiter as he brought them their meal of fish and potatoes. Masha sniffed the fish.\n\n"Tartar sauce, Sladkaya?"\n"Yes?"\n"I am sure you are aware that none of my enlisted soldiers get tartar sauce on their fish rations. Why should generals like me and party officials like yourself eat better than the common soldier?"\n\n"Mashka, I merely wanted to-"\n"To subtly bribe me? To curry favour? And another thing. My friends can call me "Mashka" or "Vampirenok," but from you it is insulting. I am not some child any more, comrade Sladkaya."\n\nKaramelka sighed. So young, so fiery... she just needed a few more years to figure herself out and she'd be an admirable communist, but until that happened she was just insufferable.\n\n"Look, Comrade Norushkina. Are we going to discuss how to prevent Vasily from destroying both of our factions' ability to do anything, and possibly have us both expelled from the party as revisionists-"\n"I am no revisionist!"\n"Once Vasily secures control, he'll get to decide who is and is not a revisionist. So, are we going to discuss strategy, or are we going to bicker all night?""
stalliongrad.11005.a:0 "The two bicker all night."
stalliongrad.11005.b:0 "The two get down to discussing strategy."

stalliongrad.11006.t:0 "Three Comrades"
stalliongrad.11006.d:0 "Sinister took another sip of Muffin's special vodka, savouring the taste. It had been mixed with distilled love, passively gathered by Gold Muffin from all the friends and comrades he'd made since his fateful flight cacross the tundra to Stalliongrad. Vasily was waxing poetic about his plans again, more than a little tipsy. Sinister liked him like this, casual and enthusiastic. It was a side not many got to see of the premier, who most thought was a dour bureaucrat all the time.\n\n"And thank you, Sinister!" the red-maned stallion slurred, turning to his friend, "Without you, and uh, and you too Muffin! And you too. But I'll get to that in a sec, without you, I woulda stayed in the planning office forever! And everypony told me to ditch you, but I knew, I knew! You've really come through Sinister, with all those things you've been doing in the place with those ponies..."\n\nGold muffin laughed. Sinister gave a mock curtsy. "I live to serve the revolution, my dear Vasya!"\n\n"To the revolution!" Vasily proclaimed, then realized his glass was empty. Muffin gave a tiny shake of his head, indicating there would be no more for the premier. Sinister smiled. He didn't know why Vasily trusted him, after all the enemies he'd made, but he was grateful he did. Without friends like Vasily and Muffin, Sinister would be lost. So he raised his glass with a toast of his own."

stalliongrad.4.d:0 ""...Although our efforts have thus far focused on supporting comrades in Baltimare's trade unions and the socialist sailors in Vanhoover, we the undersigned believe in accordance with the principle of internationalism that more must be done. In particular, there are two major untapped populations. First, we hold that the Crystal Ponies would be receptive to us, as they feel the alienation of capitalism more acutely due to only recently being proletarianised after long existence in a pre-capitalist state."\n\n"For similar reasons, the batponies of Equestria would turn to socialism easily if given the right push. Many batponies have only recently joined the proletariat, having been displaced into the cities by primitive accumulation and facing particularly poor working conditions. While many of them cling to monarchism in the vain hope that Princess Luna will help, the last seven years of inaction have resulted in many turning to more radical voices. If we do not act soon, they will turn to reactionary nationalism or other alternative ideologies for a solution. To facilitate this, we the undersigned recommend a 20% increase in funding to the program for helping revolutionaries abroad..."\n\nAltidiya considered the proposal. It was signed not only by Masha's clique of radicals, but by several members of the majority, including Sinister Serov and Gold Muffin. It was bold, dangerous even. Karamelka had just come to her last week, suggesting that funding communists in Equestria was taking vital resources away from the people of Stalliongrad, and that "poking the Equestrian Ursa" risked an unwinnable war if our operations were discovered.\n\nVasily, for his part, had insisted that our current operations were quite secure, but that expanding to the Crystal Empire and the batponies would surely result in our discovery. As a matter of clandestine operations, the decision was Altidiya's alone to make."
stalliongrad.4.a:0 "Vasily is right."
stalliongrad.4.b:0 "Masha is right, we should be bolder."
stalliongrad.4.c:0 "Karamelka is right, we need to be cautious."

stalliongrad.5.t:0 "Socialism in One Country?"
stalliongrad.5.d:0 "One of the more controversial doctrines adopted during the Altidiya years is Socialism In One Country, that is to say, the doctrine that our efforts should primarily focus on building a shining, self-sufficient socialist state in Severyana.\n\nThe ultra-lefts in particular have always opposed that move, arguing in line with classical Marksism that the revolution is international in character and that our worker's state will degenerate into state capitalism unless we rapidly spread the revolution to Equestria, at the bare minimum.\n\nThe right opposition are also skeptical, but instead argue that a period of state capitalism is actually necessary to expand the means of production and improve standards of living. All in preparation for spreading the revolution through economics, diplomacy, and force as a last resort. Still, they advocate against scrapping the policy because it clearly communicates to the world that we are not going to invade our neighbours at will.\n\nThe center is divided on the topic, with Sinister Serov largely siding with the ultra-lefts, but Vasily arguing that it is possible. He believes that the material conditions in Stalliongrad are sufficient to support, if not full communism, then at least a robust socialism, but only if we are courageous and unified in our pursuit of a better life."
stalliongrad.5.a:0 "We will build socialism here and now."
stalliongrad.5.b:0 "Our central concern must be to develop the means of production."
stalliongrad.5.c:0 "If we do not liberate all the workers of the world, we shall perish."

stalliongrad.6.t:0 "Freedom of factions or unity?"
stalliongrad.6.d:0 "The SCP runs on the principle of democratic centralism, meaning that issues are to be vigorously debated and voted on but then considered closed: once the party has made a decision, it behooves all representatives of the party to support that decision, or to resign. This allows us to maintain democracy and make good decisions, but also to move forward with unity and purpose. "Freedom of Debate, Unity of Action," in theory.\n\nIn practice, the emergence of factions within the party undermines the efficacy of this principle. Party members privately dissent from policies they already had a chance to contest publicly, then those dissensions find their way to the press and chip away at even the appearance of unity. Debates are reopened again and again.\n\nVasily's ally Sinister Serov has argued that if this principle is to mean anything, we must curtail factionalism. While it is too soon to ban factions outright, the general secretary can release an official statement condemning them, and institute new rules of order within the Supreme Soviet to better enforce democratic centralism. The ultra-leftist and rightist factions have both objected that these rules will stifle the freedom of debate within the party and lead to rigidity and dogmatism, to which Vasily retorted that they would not have been necessary if the factions had not made them necessary with their ceaseless infighting."
stalliongrad.6.a:0 "We must clamp down on all this bickering!"

stalliongrad.9.d:0 "Adding new members to the Politburo is always cause for debate, and often the Supreme Soviet will argue for weeks before settling on somepony to fill a vacancy. With Vasily Pantsushenko taking an increasingly active role in party politics, he has announced that he will resign as People's Commissar for Industrial Planning. This surprised many, who expected him to keep his role as it provided him considerable influence, but Vasily insisted that for the good of the people, he had to allow somepony else to fill the role who has more time to devote to it.\n\nHis ally Gold Muffin has suggested Konzan University engineering professor Alevtina Qubysheva as his replacement. She has only ever dabbled in politics, but seems to be a favour high-tech industries as the core of Stalliongrad's economic progress. Her professional, apolitical stance has caused some within the Right opposition to support her too.\n\nThe left opposition has put forward their own candidate, a more well-known pony named Psychic Sigil who was responsible for the developing our armaments industry. Whoever is chosen will have a big task ahead of them, as Stalliongrad's industry grows larger and more complicated by the day, and coordinating it all is quickly becoming a monumental task."

stalliongrad.10.t:0 "Support Collective Farms"
stalliongrad.10.d:0 "Although the NEP allowed market forces into the agricultural sector, the core of our food supply comes from collective farms. These farms have had difficulty meeting quotas, and between the Equestrian blockade and the loss of our most arable land in the revolution, food insecurity has been a constant problem. While we have not had a true famine yet, the People's Commissariat of Agriculture reports that we are perhaps one bad winter away from one.\n\nAccordingly, the party voted at the 1004 SCP Congress to prioritise the production of agricultural machinery. Now we must decide where to distribute these combine harvesters, tractors, and other equipment. Vasily suggests that we send the majority out to the collective farms, and if the private farms want them, they can buy them from the state. This will cause more farmers to embrace collectivisation and generate state revenue.\n\nThe opposition argue that now is not the time to play favourites and that we should ship the machinery out to all our farmers. Many suspect the left opposition has sided with the rightists on this because of some deal, or because they see no need to encourage collectivisation through economics when they plan to do it by force."

It was truly exquisite, the way Prokoniev's sonatas sounded with one's head immersed in hot water. Or at least it would be if it weren't for the muffled sounds of somepony pounding on his door.\n\n"Is it the SKVD or the mailpony? Either way come back later," Sinister drawled, poking his head just above the water.\n"It's Vasya!" came a muffled voice from the other side of the door. Sinister blinked. What did Vasily want?\n"Fine, fine, you have the spare key, just come on in!"\n\nVasily entered the suite mid-sentence: "...didn't want to barge in if you were- oh-for-the-love-of-Tartarus!"\n"Bathing?" finished Sinister, grinning devilishly as Vasily gave an exasperated sigh.\n"Yes, that. What are you doing?"\n"Bathing."\n""The Party Congress starts in less than an hour and we need to coordinate!"\n"Oh I'm terribly sorry Vasya, it slipped my mind. I'm sure I can make it up to you by blowing everypony away at the Congress with another stellar speech in your favour..."\n"Have you even prepared anything?"\n"Come now, you know I simply get going and say what I feel like."\n\nVasily finally made eye contact with his friend, narrowing his eyes.\n"Not this time, Sinnie. This time you're not riling up a crowd, you're making a case to party delegates who deserve to know what they're getting into if they endorse my program. You need to actually be professional, for once."\n"Oh I'll need more than an hour of prep for that, my dear Vasya!"\n"Oh, don't worry. Your only job today is to sit near Mashka and make sure she doesn't disrupt everything. Your big day is tomorrow. I know you, Sinister, and I knew I'd have to wrangle you one way or another."\n\nSinister Serov chuckled, rising out of the bath and lazily walking over to get a towel while Vasily looked on in exasperation."

stalliongrad.122.d:0 "Vasily Pantsuschenko couldn't help but feel giddy as the last delegates took their seats at the Tenth Party Congress. All his efforts had come to this: either Sinister's fire, Muffin's diplomacy and Vasily's hard work would unite the party, or it would all come to nothing. Vasily waited as Altidiya officially opened the tenth party Congress, barely hearing her words as his mind raced with what could go wrong. He almost didn't hear when the General Secretary announced it was time for him to propose his first resolution.\n\nIt had taken so much effort to get Vasily's anti-corruption resolution to the top of the list, but Vasily knew it would be worth it. This would allow him to set the tone for the entire Congress. Stepping up to the podium, he began:\n"Comrades, I am not going to mince words. The Party is in distress. I have long spoken out against factionalism, this you all know, but today I would like to begin with something that unites us all: the duty of every representative of the SCP to serve the interests of the people and the revolution, rather than their private interests."\n\n"It is precisely the temptation to profit off of their offices which turns factionalism from a healthy part of party democracy into a source of deadlock. Therefore, I propose a new set of countermeasures to ensure that every official be subject to proper performance evaluations, and that corruption be dealt with swiftly and conclusively."\n\nAfter a few minutes of clarifying questions from Karamelka, the vote was called, and the resolution passed easily."

Comrade Sladkaya, your efforts kept us from famine, and brought the prosperity you have always believed we needed before creating socialism. For that, we thank you."\n\nVasily glanced at Masha's crowd. Good. Sinister was where he was supposed to be, keeping the batpony distracted so she couldn't rally her faction to denounce Muffin as a revisionist or whatever insult she thought of for somecreature with something good to say about the NEP. Muffin finished his speech. As expected, Karamelka Sladkaya got up to argue against him.\n\n"Thank you, comrade Muffin, for your kind words. However, I argue that we have not achieved the prosperity necessary to go forward with collectivisation. As Comrade Muffin said, the NEP generates prosperity and security, increasing median real income yearly since its adoption and limiting inflation. Why should we throw it away?"\n\nVasily relaxed. Of course, Karamelka would argue against it, but he could already feel her losing the delegates as she got into dry economic data, sounding more like a bourgeois economist by the moment. Sinister was joking around with some of the delegates, and it was clear Karamelka wouldn't be able to stop it. When the vote came, even some of the rightists voted in favour of phasing out the NEP."

Comrade Sladkaya, your efforts kept us from famine, and brought the prosperity you have always believed we needed before creating socialism. For that, we thank you."\n\nThe first sign something was wrong was when Dark Wing, not Karamelka, got up to speak against the resolution. "Comrade Muffin declared that we are prosperous. This begs the question: prosperous relative to whom? Certainly not Manehattan, or the other large cities which have access to the Equestrian market." Dark Wing took a moment, letting the ultra-left faction jeer at him, Sinister failing to stop Masha from yelling "Counter-revolutionary!"\n"There is another thing I find interesting. Obviously, Comrade Muffin, you are complimenting Karamelka as part of Vasily's plans to implement measures to, in his words, 'Advance the revolution and serve the people.' As if those are always the same thing. I did find it ironic you started with anti-corruption, given where Serov gets the money for his walk-in closet full of dresses and his other one full of suits."\n\n"This again, Dark Wing?" Sinister shouted, "You and your cronies have already had me investigated for corruption twice and they found nothing; I am simply very good at shopping!"\n\n"Very good at not getting caught!" hollered one of the rightist delegates.\n"Comrades, enough shouting!" said  Dark Wing, but the damage was done. The room descended into accusations and personal attacks, with every potentate of every faction feeling the need to deliver a lengthy speech on the last speech. The first day fo the Congress closed before they got to voting on the resolution."

Now, these telephone poles were attended by Red Guard, who would tear down any posters pushing another narrative, and scare off anypony trying to do the same to their own.

Confess to espionage, confess to treason, confess to anti-Soviet activity, and confess to bribery or blackmail or whatever methods you used to get the Red Guard to join you!"\n\nFinally, Sinister understood. Drawing himself up, he looked into Vasily's eyes. "I will confess to treason and to anti-Soviet activity. But I will not confess falsely. I did not pay a single bribe, or issue a single threat. The Red Guard, the ultra-left faction, Masha... all I did was talk to them, telling them that the revolution had lost its way and that it was their duty to save it. Think upon that, my dear Vasily.""

stalliongrad.28.t:0 "The Hard Conversations"
stalliongrad.28.d:0 "Vasily had known, back in the days of the Winter Revolution, what kinds of conversations Steel Stallion had with his Chekists. The hard decisions he'd had to make to secure the state. He'd hoped he would never have to step into Stallion's shoes. At first, he didn't want to be General Secretary, then even when he threw his hat in, he thought he'd be able to govern by consensus. That the age of Revolutionary Terror was over.\n\nNow he sat in front of Mistina, newly-appointed chief of the SKVD, looking over lists. Those accursed lists. It was so... perfunctory. "Name: Danila Bagryan. Position: SKVD underchief. Level of involvement: Total. Evidence: See appendix C. Recommended Action: Liquidation. Sign here." Mistina had been quite thorough. Each time Vasily had checked the appendixes, he'd been fully convinced, and Mistina had complained he was taking valuable time. Time. Time was central. Sinister was accounted for, but there was no telling what would happen if Vasily delayed. No telling what his followers would do. Still, whenever "Liquidation" came up, Vasily couldn't help but look up at the pegasus.\n\n"Are you sure that's necessary?" he asked.\n\n"Absolutely," she replied. "Bagryan is a stain on the SKVD. He was supposed to watch for this kind of treason, but instead he aided it. Giving him a trial or delaying would allow him to use the state secrets -he is a former SKVD chief, he knows everything- to damage us, or to blackmail whoever is presiding over his trial."\n\nVasily nodded and gritted his teeth."

stalliongrad.30.d:0 ""Sladkaya? Are you in there?"\n\nKaramelka looked up from the papers on her desk, it had been hours since she had sat down to get some work done for the upcoming congress, and she barely knew what time it was. But judging from the lack of light outside, it was probably the early hours of the morning already. She got up from her desk, having to steady herself after sitting down for so long.\n\nWho could it be at this time? Why does someone need to talk to her now of all hours?\n\nOpening the door, she did not see a familiar face. Rather one she had only met once or twice in person. But she could remember his name.\n\n"Major Morozov. How... interesting to see you at this hour?" The stallion looked visibly regretful that he had come at such a strange time, but equally insistent he be let inside.\n\n"Comrade Sladkaya, I apologize for disturbing you but I have something that will be of utmost importance to you." He jostled his right hoof, shaking a manila folder stuffed hastily with papers. "I need to come inside. Please." Karamelka knew the sound in his voice, and she knew it well. It was the sound of someone making a very hard decision that they were about to back out of. So she let the major in.\n\nThe pegasus began to pace around her office, gripping the papers extremely hard, "As you know, during the revolution I had the honor of commanding our pegasi shock corps. And I have continued this responsibility to this day." Karamelka nodded as Morozov rattled off his accomplishments during the revolution, "Since then, I formed a friendship with general Masha. But it was just that, we were friends. I stayed out of politics, I didn't want to get involved."\n\nKaramelka put her hoof in front of him, stopping his pacing. "Major Morozov. I know you are not a stallion of intrigue, I trust you, what is going on?"\n\nThe pegasus sighed and threw the folder onto the desk, "Three days ago I was contacted by general Masha asking for her help in a plot. She has made a pact with Sinister Serov to overthrow the government at the next Congress. She wanted my unit to play a role, so I said yes to get out of the conversation. I knew I had to tell someone, I know you're the only one Sinister would never be able to get on side. I'll do whatever you need me to. Just stop Sinister. I don't know how he bent Masha's leg, but we can't let this happen."\n\nKaramelka took everything in, and laughed internally. It was just like the days of the revolution. But it seemed this time she was on the other end of things. "Of course, thank you for your help.""

There was just the issue of-\n\n"Masha..." the thestral looked up to see Major Morozov standing in the doorway. The stallion stared her dead in the eyes with an expression like steel. What was going on? "There's a visitor for you." Before Masha could respond, Morozov stepped out of the way, revealing Karamelka Sladkaya.\n\nThe General spoke with aprehension, "Comrade Sladkaya, it's a surprise to see you." Masha shifted slightly, she didn't know what was going on, and she began to move for where she kept her hidden pistol.\n\n"It's not a surprise to see you, General. And don't bother looking for your weapon, it's not there." Masha's eyes widened and her heart sank when she realized what had happened. The coup had been sold out, and she had no way to fight back. As Masha froze, Karamelka walked over and put a hoof on her shoulder, "I'm sorry child. Your zeal got the better of you." Before turning around to the door, "Comrade Flyagin, place Masha Norushkina under arrest."\n\nAnd as Masha was put into a car outside her building, she could only wonder how it all went so wrong."

stalliongrad.32.d:0 ""Order! Order! I call order to this congress!" Gold Muffin bellowed from his podium before the Supreme Soviet. The timid and reserved changeling let his voice out for the first time in many months to calm the chaos of the chamber. Delegates stood, not taking their seats, and whispered to one another, it was complete anarchy. "I will not have this congress devolve into chaos!"\n\nSinister Serov rose and shouted above the murmuring, "This congress will achieve order once we find out what happened to General Norushkina! We cannot have officers of the state disappearing with no action from the administration!"\n\nGold Muffin began to lose patience, but then, out of the corner of his eye, he saw Karamelka enter the chamber. Finally, this torture could end. He despised acting like this to the congress, and especially his friend Sinister. Or, what was once his friend. Karamelka looked the changeling in the eyes and nodded.\n\nMuffin took in a deep breath, and bellowed as loud as his voice would allow him, "Silence!" Waiting for the room to become quiet, he continued, "I believe Comrade Sladkaya has something to say." Muffin looked from Sladkaya to Sinister. Sinister wasn't looking back. His eyes were trained on Karamelka, an unnatural focus consuming him. His plot couldn't proceed without Masha, but he didn't know it was all over already.\n\nKaramelka stood from her seat and cleared her voice, "I would like to present a motion on the condemnation of the conduct of Comrade Serov." On queue, the left wing of the hall erupted. Sinister himself soon rose and fired back, "Doing the wishes of Dark Wing now are you? I thought this nonsense was his job!"\n\n"Seconded!"\n\nThe hall went silent, as all eyes looked to Gold Muffin. He never approved motions before, so all knew something was afoot. Karamelka smirked as horror set in on Serov's face, "I formally charge Sinister Serov with collaboration with and participation in a military coup against the Communist Party, I charge him with anti-socialist behavior-" By now the yelling in the hall was getting louder, with left delegates trying to snuff out Karamelka's cries. "With working with the traitorous General Masha Norushkina, and with plotting to destroy the revolution! And I declare you under arrest!"\n\nOn queue with the finishing of her speech, Gold Muffin sighed, and pressed the button under his podium. The next few minutes were a blur as Morozov's soldiers stormed the hall and arrested the plotters, but Muffin couldn't stop thinking about how it all came to this."

stalliongrad.33.d:0 "Gold Muffin, Chaircreature of the Supreme Soviet, normally didn't have much actual power. He had a lot of soft power, everypony liked him except for a few hardliners, but he wasn't in charge of any serious portfolio. But for what Karamelka was about to do, the Changeling Revolutionary was vital.\n\nShe needed somepony - or someling, in his case - who was seen as unimpeachable, not part of the rightist faction and only vaguely associated with the center. And as chair of the Supreme Soviet, Muffin could second her motion to arrest Sinister from a position where everypony would listen.\n\nKaramelka made no appeals. She just gave Muffin her dossier and waited. Muffin's compound eyes betrayed nothing, but the slight quivering of his jaw told her everything she needed to know. He believed her.\n\n"I..." Muffin began, "I wish it hadn't come to this. I really thought... Oh Karamelka, is there any way this is a misunderstanding?"\n"I'm afraid not."\n"I knew Sinister was trouble, but I really thought..." he took a drink of water, and then looked at her with a pleading expression. "I know what I have to do, but... Sinister... I don't want to. Is there any other way?"\n"I suppose you could talk to him."\nMuffin laughed bitterly.\n\n"No, you're right. Talk never worked for Sinister. I really thought that between Vasily and me, if he just had some good friends who really cared about him... but no, Sinister Serov is Sinister Serov. He won't change, and he won't back down.""

stalliongrad.34.d:0 "It had taken her long, so much longer than she'd expected, to reach this point. After Steel Stallion's death, many had assumed she would be the natural successor. The veteran revolutionary, the champion of the NEP, seen by many as Stallion's right hoof. But then Stallion's testament had been distributed, their disagreements had been made public, her association with Dark Wing had backfired, and it had all gone wrong. Karamelka had fallen from grace as younger ponies like Altidiya swept the carpet out from under her.\n\nIt had taken years to rebuild her power base. But in the end, she had all but resigned herself to playing second fiddle to Altidiya or Vasily. As Karamelka approached the podium to give her address, she almost wanted to thank Sinister, though he languished in a cell now. His coup had given her a chance to prove herself once more. No longer was she Karamelka the timid, Karamelka the weak, Karamelka the revisionist. Now, she was Karamelka the hero. She had saved the republic from its enemies, and all those voices which once whispered behind her back had fallen silent.\n\n"Comrades," she began, "It is with great humility that I accept the position of General Secretary of the Stalliongradian Communist Party. Our Socialist Republic has gone through much in these last years. So much anger and violence. But now, it is a new day. Now, Stalliongrad is united once more, and ready to face the future. There can be no equality without freedom, and there can be no freedom without equality. Socialism and liberty go hoof-in-hoof, and from this day forward, we will stand as a beacon of both. From this day forth, we will go forward fearlessly, our resolve tempered by mercy yet unshakable all the same. I accept this solemn duty, and invite you all to walk the path of revolution with me. Thank you.""

My Red Guard would handle the wetwork..."\n\nIt was then that the SKVD entered the room. The four immediately got up, realising too late that they hadn't come armed. Three SKVD ponies stood at attention as Danila Bagryan, former chief of the SKVD, stepped into the room.\n\n"My my my," Danila said, "What do we have here? No, don't answer, I already know." He closed the door before continuing. "You are preparing a coup d'etat, are you not?"\n\n"Danila, comrade," began Sinister, but Danila waved a hoof.\n\n"Oh come now Sinnie. If I wanted to stop you, I wouldn't have come here myself. Just be glad it was I who found out and not Mistina or one of the others. No, I'm here to join you. Don't look so surprised! Everything you've been blathering about, I already know. Altidiya has gone soft. If Steel Stallion could see our party now, he would throw up. I warned him what would happen if he didn't purge Karamelka and the other weaklings, but alas, Stallion always had a soft side. It's a pity. So, here is my offer: I'll help you, if you reinstate my doctrines of Revolutionary Terror and allow me and the SKVD a free hoof to pursue our duty to guard the revolution. Deal?"

The "Copper for Crystals deal," as it was called, had us send engineers and electricians to electrify the Crystal City and lay down telephone wires across the nation, in exchange for large shipments of magical crystals, raw iron, and other resources.\n\nThat deal never sat well with the Ultra-Left faction. To them, the Crystal Empire should be a beachhead, not a trading partner. Repeatedly, Masha Norushkina has argued that we should seek to radicalise the Crystal Ponies, given that they are new to capitalism and not infected with its ideology. Instead, she lamented, we directly gave them the benefits of electricity and let their princess take the credit, endearing them to capitalist monarchy even more.\n\nNow, with the time coming to send an ambassador to the Crystal Empire, she has made a push within the Soviets to have herself sent over rather than Karamelka. Doubtless, she would use that visit to make contact with dissidents in the Empire.

All our propaganda: better world, utopia, everypony must do their part... don't you see? He heard our words, he saw the reality, and of course he tried to fight us. And now he's dead. He'll never learn better. Because of us, Dark Wing. I... I need to go inside. I need to be alone. Dark Wing, get me home.""

What positions Nightmare Moon's military were able to hastily erect in the chaos of the ongoing civil war were quickly swept away, troops fleeing in their wake. Nightmare Moon was unable to be reached for comment, but Gensec [STG.GetLeader] was quoted as saying that the morning's events were a natural consequence of Equestrian alicorncracy. Despite both sides saying that they did not wish to escalate the conflict at the current time it's undoubtable that this will lead to conflicts in the future."

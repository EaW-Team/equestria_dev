 EQC_maresoc_rename_mareland:0 "Rename Mareland"
 EQC_maresoc_rename_mareland_desc:0 "Now that we have secured control of Mareland, we must erase all records which contradict the fact that New Mareland was always called Marelandia, and that there is no other place called Mareland in the world."
 
 ### FOCUSES ###
 EQC_seize_the_opportunity:0 "Entrench The Revolution"
 EQC_seize_the_opportunity_desc:0 "We have successfully overthrown the corrupt and capitalist regime of the old, but our grasp of the nation is tenuous at best. Reforms must begin which will restore order and ensure our total control of all."
 
 EQC_the_purge:0 "The Great Purge"
 EQC_the_purge_desc:0 "No one can be trusted. Not even those within the Party. We must vaporize those who could threaten the revolution before they cause any issues: The celestial loyalists, the capitalists and those who are too intelligent. Any mentions of their names will be removed from all records. It will be like they never existed in the first place."
 
 EQC_seize_the_ecomony:0 "Collectivize the Economy"
 EQC_seize_the_ecomony_desc:0 "The markets are our markets. We must uproot capitalism from our nation and burn it to ashes. The Party will own everything. Foreign trade must end too; any interaction with those outside our nation will be punishable by death. We can't have any influences entering the minds of our citizens that isn't strictly authorised by the state itself."
 
 EQC_reclass_the_population:0 "Reclass the Population"
 EQC_reclass_the_population_desc:0 "All societies across the world, throughout history, have been divided into three groups: The High, the Middle, and the Low. Our society, too, will have such a structure. The Inner Party will be the High, the Outer Party will be the Middle, and the Proletariat will be the Low. This new meritocratic order must be entrenched permanently."
 
 EQC_begin_mind_control:0 "Big Sister Is Watching You"
 EQC_begin_mind_control_desc:0 "To embody the Party and its values, an individual is needed. This person will be the public face of the Party, for emotions of love and fear are more easily focused on a single relatable pony. Her face will soon be displayed across the nation, with posters plastered on every wall with the slogan "Big Sister is Watching You.""
 
 #Ministry of Truth#
 EQC_found_minitrue:0 "Ignorance Is Strength"
 EQC_found_minitrue_desc:0 "Who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past. As long as the Party retains control of the past, the truth is whatever the Party wants it to be. If we say that black is white, then everyone must say that it is so, and believe that it is so, and know that black has always been white."
 
 EQC_alter_the_past:0 "Alter The Past"
 EQC_alter_the_past_desc:0 "The past exists only in memory and records, and both are mutable. Therefore Marelandia has always been called Marelandia, and it was never a colony. There is no place called "Mareland" in the world. We have always been at war with Equestria. All this is truth, and everything that contradicts truth must be rectified or erased. The Party is infallible."
 
 EQC_prolefeed:0 "Prolefeed"
 EQC_prolefeed_desc:0 "Like all cattle, proles require sustenance to remain content. Prolesec, a department of Minitrue, will provide them with prolefeed, superficial entertainment that shall also shape their worldview to our liking. Produced en masse with versificators and other such devices, it consists of newspapers, novelettes, films, songs and radio plays, filled with nothing of substance."
 
 EQC_newspeak:0 "Introduce Newspeak"
 EQC_newspeak_desc:0 "Language is the foundation of thought. If we want to prevent heretical thoughts, then we must clearly modify the language. It will be simplified, its vocabulary greatly reduced and any nuance or innuendo made impossible. Every word will have only one meaning, and if that meaning cannot be orthodox, then the word will be erased. The new language can be used without thinking."
 
 EQC_hate_campaigns:0 "Hate Campaigns"
 EQC_hate_campaigns_desc:0 "The low quality of life and our harsh rule make citizens subconsciously frustrated and angry. However, this emotion can be directed at our foes, both existent and non-existent, away from MARESOC. By dedicating two minutes each day and one week a year to hate, we can allow the citizens to vent their bottled up anger. They will learn to despise the enemies of state."
 
 EQC_doublethink:0 "Doublethink"
 EQC_doublethink_desc:0 "Doublethink is the refined art of having two contradictory beliefs simultaneously, yet genuinely thinking both of them are true. Yet it is not simply the control of one's beliefs, but also the mastery of one's memories and the ability of unconscious thought. While newspeak is the method for controlling the mind through language, doublethink is the method of directly controlling the mind."
 
 #Control#
 EQC_found_miniluv:0 "Freedom Is Slavery"
 EQC_found_miniluv_desc:0 "Power is in tearing minds to pieces and putting them back together in new shapes of your own choosing. Ponies of Marelandia will not know the "magic" of friendship, nor will they know honesty, generosity or kindness. They will only know love of Big Sister. We shall squeeze them empty of harmony, and fill them with ourselves."

 EQC_MARE_extradite_griffons:0 "Expulse The Griffons"
 EQC_MARE_extradite_griffons_desc:0 "The griffon minority in our country cannot be trusted. They are a potential fifth column that our eastern foes are eager to use to their advantage when they eventually seek to destroy us. Not only that, but their race is inherently capitalistic, with many of them refusing to integrate into our society and serving in the army. We have tolerated their dissident behaviour long enough."
 
 EQC_MARE_transrads:0 "A Transrad In Every Home"
 EQC_MARE_transrads_desc:0 "The Transrad is a new invention created by the finest MARESOC engineers. It is similar to the radio, but in addition to acting as a receiver it can also transmit audio as well as visual data, hence the name. Equipped with a sensitive microphone and a miniature camera, it will allow us to closely monitor every party member. Especially those belonging to the Outer Party."
 
 EQC_MARE_joycamps:0 "Open Joycamps"
 EQC_MARE_joycamps_desc:0 "We have tens of thousands of prisoners languishing in custody, and their number grows each day. But now we are finally opening correctional facilities where the prisoners will be forced to work for the state. This serves two purposes: To punish the prisoners and to extract labour from them. The prisoners will be told that if they work hard enough, they will be freed. They never will be."
 
 EQC_MARE_the_spies:0 "The Junior Spies"
 EQC_MARE_the_spies_desc:0 "We cannot allow citizens to remain more loyal to family than to the party. The bonds must be broken from within, by having the foals join the Junior Spies, a nation-wide youth organization promoting patriotism and party values. After the offspring are indoctrinated, they will become fanatically loyal to the party, eagerly spy on their parents and report any divergent behaviour."
 
 EQC_MARE_thought_police:0 "Thought Police"
 EQC_MARE_thought_police_desc:0 "In Marelandia, we are free from oppressive laws. There is only one crime that can be committed, from which all other devious deeds derive from: Thoughtcrime. To prevent it, the Thought Police shall be established, dedicated to monitoring Outer Party members and their behaviour for any signs of dissidence. Those who are found guilty will then be cleansed of heresy in Room 84."
 
 #MiniPlenty#
 EQC_MARE_found_miniplenty:0 "Poverty Is Prosperity"
 EQC_MARE_found_miniplenty_desc:0 "The Ministry of Plenty, the Ministry responsible not only for agriculture, but also for manufacturing goods the masses may think they want, and for goods that we know we will need. A loyal group of ponies dedicated to ensuring numbers are met and that the populace is kept in a permanent state of absolute poverty."
 
 EQC_MARE_war_rations:0 "War Rationing"
 EQC_MARE_war_rations_desc:0 "The populace believes us to be at war, and we are. We are at war with the system of capitalism. This permanent state of emergency means resources must be redirected away from senseless civilian consumption into the vital war economy. The records, of course, will state that rations have in fact been increased. Those who say this isn't true will be accused of committing thoughtcrime."

 EQC_MARE_command_economy:0 "Command Economy"
 EQC_MARE_command_economy_desc:0 "MiniPlenty must have complete and total control over our economy. It is their duty to impose quotas on the hordes of proles so they produce an excessive amount of bullets, guns, rockets, tanks and more. By forcing the populace to spend most of their time working, they won't have leisure time that can potentially be used for thoughtcrime."
 
 EQC_MARE_repurpose_factories:0 "Enforced Destitution"
 EQC_MARE_repurpose_factories_desc:0 "We cannot allow the proles to have any wealth or access to the means of production. If they are kept in a state of abject poverty, they will rely on the Party for survival and cannot afford education. A poor, ignorant populace is far easier to dominate, after all. Thus we will repurpose facilities used for civilian production into military use."
 
 EQC_MARE_state_lotteries:0 "State Lotteries"
 EQC_MARE_state_lotteries_desc:0 "MARESOC can afford to give the proles a sliver of false hope, to improve their morale and to provide us funding. National lotteries will be regularly held, promising huge prizes for the participants. However, no awards will ever be given to anyone. The Ministry of Truth will of course publish news about lottery winners, but they will not be real. The only one who wins is Big Sister."
 
 EQC_MARE_live_long_and_prosper:0 "Live Long And Prosper"
 EQC_MARE_live_long_and_prosper_desc:0 "Annual reports claim production is ever increasing. In truth it is ever decreasing in every sector except the military one. Reports claim rations are increased, quotas surpassed, that each generation of Marelandians is more prosperous and healthy than the last. It is all lies, of course, and the only ones enjoying wine and chocolate are Inner Party members."
 
 #Ministry of Peace
 EQC_found_minipax:0 "War Is Peace"
 EQC_found_minipax_desc:0 "The Ministry of Peace will be responsible for maintaining a state of perpetual war forever. It is vital that we are strong enough to survive, yet not too strong to end our wars too quickly. Constant war preserves the special mental atmosphere that a hierarchical society needs."

 EQC_MARE_loyalist_officers:0 "MARESOC Officers"
 EQC_MARE_loyalist_officers_desc:0 "Prior to MARESOC's coup, many officers remained loyal to such abhorrent things as democracy and Equestria. Now those officers never existed. New ones are needed to restore order in the leaderless army. Promising and orthodox party members will thus be rewarded with positions of command in the military."

 EQC_MARE_army_work_placements:0 "Marelandia, 'Tis For Thee"
 EQC_MARE_army_work_placements_desc:0 "It is the patriotic duty of every party member and prole to safeguard their country from counter-revolutionary aggression and despicable foreigners. Military training will be mandatory and everypony must be ready to serve in the army if necessary."

 EQC_MARE_peace_forces:0 "The Military Reborn"
 EQC_MARE_peace_forces_desc:0 "The old army of New Mareland has been moulded in our image. Heretics have been culled and discipline restored. Every soldier is willing to die for Big Sister. This is the embryo of a mighty army that will one day crush all our rivals and enemies."

 #Minipax Army
 EQC_MARE_land:0 "The New Army of Marelandia"
 EQC_MARE_land_desc:0 "An army, loyal to the whims of the Party, is the only way to truly hold territory gained, and to defend MARESOC against any external threats. Their task is to ensure war can be maintained for as long as possible, and to waste surplus production on warfare."

 EQC_MARE_new_ways_to_kill:0 "Technology of Death"
 EQC_MARE_new_ways_to_kill_desc:0 "Technological progress is only allowed to happen when innovations can be used for oppression or conquest. Improved rifles and heavy guns contribute to the latter and strengthen our army. Such innovations must be encouraged, for they will eventually allow MARESOC to overcome all its enemies."

 EQC_MARE_war_machines:0 "Marelandia Is Indestructible"
 EQC_MARE_war_machines_desc:0 "Already, nopony is allowed to cross the border. It must be fortified even further in preparation for enemy aggression. Thousands of workers shall labour ceaselessly, to the death if need be, to turn our nation into an unassailable, invincible fortress. Nothing can threaten the rule of MARESOC."
 
 EQC_MARE_mass_combat:0 "A Wave of Flesh"
 EQC_MARE_mass_combat_desc:0 "Marelandia is small and weak. If we wish to accomplish our goal of total world conquest, we must become strong. Our army must rival that of our neighbours despite our lesser population and industry. We will forcefully conscript as many ponies as we need to drown our enemies in the blood of our soldiers."

 EQC_MARE_mass_production:0 "Mass Production"
 EQC_MARE_mass_production_desc:0 "Our army is always in need of more tools of slaughter. The proles shall be sent into the arms factories to labour ceaselessly and fill the production quotas. Sacrifices will have to be made in regards to quality, but several soldiers dying from malfunctioning weaponry is an acceptable loss."

 EQC_MARE_extermination_research:0 "Unrestricted Experimentation"
 EQC_MARE_extermination_research_desc:0 "In Marelandia science, in the old sense, has almost ceased to exist. Methods of empiricism and rationality, which contradict the principles of MARESOC, are only applied where necessary, such as development of new weapons. As morality is whatever the Party wants it to be, this research can now be unshackled."

 #Minipax Airforce
 EQC_MARE_air:0 "The New Airforce of Marelandia"
 EQC_MARE_air_desc:0 "We are the rightful inheritors of the New Mareland Airforce, and we will repurpose it into a tool of destruction. Whoever rules the skies rules the battlefield, and whoever rules the battlefield will eventually rule the world. Our ample supply of aluminium and experienced pilots allow us to wield the mightiest airforce on the continent."

 EQC_MARE_fighters:0 "Aerial Supremacy"
 EQC_MARE_fighters_desc:0 "Our aircraft need to be ever faster, nimbler and more lethal. Each new model must surpass the previous one. Yet quantity must not be sacrificed for quality. If we not only outclass the enemy, but outnumber them, we will achieve total domination of the sky. Engineers and factory workers must get to work!"

 EQC_MARE_bombers:0 "Death From Above"
 EQC_MARE_bombers_desc:0 "If we wish to bound our foes into complete submission, we need to bombard the civilians and destroy the factories. When we show them how vulnerable they are, strike at their dearest monuments and massacre helpless civilians, their morale will be devastated, and they will become weak from fear."

 EQC_MARE_atomic_purges:0 "Weapons of Mass Destruction"
 EQC_MARE_atomic_purges_desc:0 "The ultimate show of force is the only way to guarantee MARESOC's rise and the utter eradication of capitalism, and what better way than a mixture of science and magic so dangerous it should not be used bar the most extraordinary of circumstances?"

 #Minipax Navy
 EQC_MARE_sea:0 "The New Navy of Marelandia"
 EQC_MARE_sea_desc:0 "The ships of the Royal Mareland Navy have been collectivized by the state. They shall now be put to use to defend our long coastline and to control the ocean around us, cutting off any maritime supply lines and trade links of our enemies."

 EQC_MARE_convoy_raiding:0 "Choke Them"
 EQC_MARE_convoy_raiding_desc:0 "Any Equestrian force that invades Marelania would have to bring supplies across the seas to keep their troops supplied. Hunting and sinking these logistics ships will leave any invaders stranded and starving, making them easy prey for our soldiers."

 EQC_MARE_terror_ships:0 "Floating Fortresses"
 EQC_MARE_terror_ships_desc:0 "It is inevitable that our navy will have to fight in direct combat with another navy, and ensuring our capital ships are top of the line will prevent us from being defeated. Constructing huge mobile behemoths of steel armed to the brim with weaponry will guarantee naval dominance."

 EQC_MARE_sea_of_death:0 "Sea of Death"
 EQC_MARE_sea_of_death_desc:0 "Filling the seas with submarines will bring death to all merchant shipping, as well as surface fleets our enemies will inevitably send after us."

 ##I cannot fucking believe maresoc did not have any events whatsoever, really shows how poorly done this path was
 ##anyways yes here's event loc
 
 mareland.69.t:0 "Rocket Bombs Hit Sunset!"
 mareland.69.d:0 "At midday a loud shriek could be heard above Sunset, moments before the sound of a booming explosion echoed in the streets. A grey trail of smoke pierced the sky, left by a rocket that had travelled faster than sound. It had landed near the city center, in an industrial district during the busiest working hours. A large factory had been reduced to a huge, smoking crater, with bits of flesh scattered around it.\n\nIt did not take long for propaganda to spread news of the event. Equestria had launched a rocket across the sea and killed 156 innocent civilians and wounding several hundred others. It was clear to all now that Celestia was a callous tyrant who was not above murdering helpless ponies to break Marelander morale. More rocket bombs were to be expected, but the citizens of Marelandia were not afraid. No, they were emboldened, and more willing than ever to fight against the despicable, immoral foe! Young ponies flocked to the recruitment centers and enthusiastically joined the army and airforce, eager to defend their homes from such strikes."
 mareland.69.a:0 "Death to Equestrian scum!"
 
 mareland.70.t:0 "Two Minutes Hate"
 mareland.70.d:0 "The entire department had come to a halt as every worker gathered in a hall with a large projection screen. There were hundreds of seats, but soon they were all filled. As the ponies waited for the Two Minutes Hate to begin, there was excited chatter in the air. They went silent as a large black-and-white face appeared on the screen.\n\nIt was Jet Set, the former governor of New Mareland, the primary enemy of Marelandia. His face was sorrowful, and he began to plead to the audience, saying that they had made a grave error and that it was not too late to turn back. Several ponies in the audience responded with angry shouts. Jet Set continued, his voice increasingly brittle, as he spoke about the magic of friendship, and Princess Celestia, and how she still loved them and would forgive them if they embraced her again. But as he spoke, grim Equestrian soldiers began marching forth from behind him. The audience gasped and began shouting more and more. As the soldiers' boots stamped on the ground, Jet Set continued to whimper, tears coming from his eyes. He was so miserably pathetic that it was impossible to not despise him.\n\nThen, Jet Set's face faded, and Celestia herself appeared, shaking the filthy claw of a griffon barbarian. Now the pony soldiers marched alongside griffons towards the audience, wielding rifles and guns and knives, with a murderous look in their eyes. The audience screamed and yelled, some began to panic while one pony threw a Newspeak Dictionary at the screen.\n\nBut then the screen went black and silent. Slowly, Big Sister's calming face appeared, quietly staring at the viewers. They responded with praise, relieved that she had saved them from the tyrant Princess and her savage allies, and began chanting her name in joy."
 mareland.70.a:0 "B--S! B--S! B--S!"
 
 mareland.71.t:0 "Griffon Refugees From Marelandia"
 mareland.71.d:0 "Our border guards report that thousands of destitute griffons have been crossing the border day and night, coming from the neighbouring country of Marelandia. They are part of the griffon minority in the nation, but now it seems like the ruling party of MARESOC has decided to extradite most griffons living inside their borders. The refugees say that they were suspected of being spies, saboteurs and potential members of a fifth column.\n\nWe have no option but to let the masses of poor griffons enter our country. Sending them back into the dystopian nightmare of Marelandia is clearly out of the question. This means we have to figure out what to do with all the refugees pouring in."
 mareland.71.a:0 "Those ponies have gone too far..."
 
 mareland.72.t:0 "We Can Hear You"
 mareland.72.d:0 "Paper Pusher, a member of the Outer Party, glanced to his sides as he neared his home. He had to make sure no one was following him before he entered the apartment building. His saddlebags contained an item which would result in capital punishment if discovered, but thankfully no one had a reason to check its contents.\n\nHe climbed up the creaking, dilapidated stairs and quietly opened the door of his apartment, trying not to attract attention. He slipped inside, closed the door and breathed a sigh of relief. The transrad in his room was playing patriotic songs; it was impossible to turn it off, so it had been on while he was gone. He walked to his desk and took off his saddlebag. Hesitantly, he opened it, and then just in case pulled moth-eaten curtains over the windows. With trembling hooves he took out the blasphemous, criminal object.\n\n"The Journal of Friendship," he mumbled in awe. The book contained the lessons of Twilight Sparkle and her friends. Contraband from overseas. Branded as "Harmonist brainwashing propaganda" by MARESOC. On these pages, the magic of friendship remained even as it was gone from the rest of New Mareland. This tome was as precious as it was dangerous.\n\nHe carefully opened the cover and flipped the pages, to check that it was real. Indeed it was, filled with stories of friendship and harmony. He was looking forward to reading it every day and reminisce the past, when ponies of New Mareland had been friends with each other.\n\nThere was a loud thump on the door. Then another. Paper Pusher gasped and scrambled to hide the book. But it was already too late as the door shattered into wooden splinters. The police officers entered, aiming guns at him and ordering him to drop the book and lie down with hooves on his back.\n"Did you think you could hide your thoughtcrime from us?" one of the officers barked. "Remember, Big Sister is not only watching you. She is hearing you as well."\nBefore he could respond, an officer smacked him in the head with a baton, knocking him out."
 mareland.72.a:0 "Another criminal caught in the act."
 
 mareland.73.t:0 "Curing Insanity"
 mareland.73.d:0 ""Do you know where you are, Paper Pusher?" an Inner Party member asked.\n"Inside the Ministry of Love."\n"How long have you been here?"\n"I don't know. Weeks, months, years?"\n"And why do you think we bring ponies here?"\n"To make them confess."\n"Wrong."\n"To punish them?"\n"No! We bring them here to be cured. So they can be sane again. You too shall be sane."\n\nPaper Pusher was lying on a stretcher, his limbs tied and his body immobilized. Several wires were attached to him. "You still cling on to your delusions that friendship and harmony should be strived for, even fought for. Once we are done with you, you will know what truly matters. Tell me, what is the purpose of MARESOC?"\n"You claim to protect us from capitalism and imperialism while securing your fragile rule with tyranny."\nHe flicked a switch and Paper Pusher screamed from pain. "No. Try again."\n"You... rule us for our own good." He screamed again from pain. The Inner Party member shook his head in disappointment. "You don't understand. MARESOC's goal and purpose is power. Power not over matter, but over the mind. We do not allow heresy to blossom. We cleanse it as soon as we find it. Tell me, how can you make sure another person obeys you?"\n"With suffering?"\n"With suffering. Pain is the essence of power. And power is all we seek. Therefore we make rebels and traitors suffer until they break, until we cure them and make them loyal, until we triumph. This is what we desire. Victory after victory, complete domination. We are not like other tyrants of the world, like Chrysalis who claimed to fight for honour, or Kemerskai who claimed to fight for democracy. We want nothing but power for its own sake."\n"But... why did you abandon friendship and harmony? Why weren't you happy with it?"\n"You must understand this, Paper Pusher. Friendship is a temporary relief. Friends die. Harmony stagnates and dies. But the Party is forever. If an individual obliterates themselves and becomes one with the Party, if all their thoughts and actions derive from the Party, they are immortal. Thus they have power over even death."\n"I don't care for immortality or power. I just want to have friends again, like before."\nThe Inner Party member sighed. "It seems there is only one option left for you.""
 mareland.73.a:0 ""Room 84.""
 
 mareland.74.t:0 "A Normal Day"
 mareland.74.d:0 "After sixteen hours of work at the munitions factory, Light Sky headed towards her home. She was wearing nothing except grey rags, her only pieces of clothing, which barely covered her emaciated form. Wearily she walked along the cracked and unmaintained streets as the sun set, having no public transport or personal vehicle to use. She walked past a band of known robbers and drug dealers, who glanced at her and ignored her, seeing how poor she was.\n\nAfter an hour Light Sky finally arrived at her shack, nestled in the vast slum surrounding Sunset. She remembered living in an apartment once, but those were now reserved for Party members only. She hoped her colt could one day pass the examinations and join the esteemed ranks of MARESOC, and live a better life than her.\n\nThat foal came to meet her and immediately demanded food. He was hungry, though he had more fat and muscle around his bones than she did. She nodded and went to the kitchen section of the room. There were no other rooms in the shack. She rummaged through the creaky cupboard next to the rusty stove, and managed to find some stale, moldy bread in the corner. She then used a metal shard she had stolen from the factory like a knife to cut off the moldy bits and split the loaf in half. But when she offered one half to her foal, he was unhappy and stomped the floor with his hooves, ordering her to give him the other loaf as well, or else he'd report her theft of the piece of metal to the Ministry of Love. She complied without resistance. Yet another day without food. But it was worth it as long as her son would live."
 mareland.74.a:0 "Such is the pathetic life of a disgusting prole."
 
 mareland.80.t:0 "Racial Harmony"
 mareland.80.d:0 "Not all griffons were forced to leave the country. Those who willingly joined the party and espoused its values were warmly welcomed into Big Sister's fold. In fact, there was no racial discrimination in the process of becoming a party member, as everycreature was given an equal chance as long as they fulfilled the numerous other prerequisites, most importantly absolute loyalty to MARESOC. Griffons, thestrals and zebras soon rose through the ranks, some even joining the Inner Party.\n\nOfficial propaganda continued to portray griffons as an alien, hostile race, but even this was a temporary arrangement. Once the griffon states were inevitably crushed, there would be no reason to promote anti-griffon hatred, and the propaganda machine would swiftly change gears to promote griffons as brothers and sisters, no different than ponies. Similar propaganda was already being made about thestrals, who had long been regarded as secondary citizens, albeit treated better than in Equestria. Marelandia, after all, was a free and equal country, so racial solidarity was to be expected.\n\nEquestrians, however, are misguided and savage creatures, bent on destroying Marelandia. Big Sister will give them no mercy. She will destroy Equestria and eradicate its degenerate populace! Death to Equestria! B--S! B--S! B--S!"
 mareland.80.a:0 "All races united under one banner!"

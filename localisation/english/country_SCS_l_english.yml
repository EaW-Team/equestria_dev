 braeburn_desc:0 "A member of the ancient Apple family, Braeburn was just a humble farmer before Equestria's descent into chaos. When the South declared independence, he rose to prominence as one of the most vocal opponents of the Neighvis government. Though he felt a fierce desire to simply march over the border and join the Equestrian army, his family persuaded him that his place was here, in Appleloosa. Instead, he joined the Equestrian Sun Party and quickly rose through its ranks through charisma and sheer force of conviction.\n\nNow the leader of a nation he wishes didn't exist, Braeburn is sure to align the South back toward Equestria. Whether that means requesting re-annexation or just fighting alongside the Princess remains to be seen."
 neighvis_desc:0 "Born to one of the oldest monied dynasties in the South, Neighvis was practically destined for a life of comfort - that was, until his family fell on hard times following a series of poor business decisions. A young Neighvis was forced to watch as the home of his birth was sold to Northern up-and-coming businessponies, and that grudge has been nursed over the course of fifty-odd years of life.\n\nNeighvis built his name gradually, bit by bit, through constant application to the art of letters, writing on a wide variety of topics until he eventually became a popular author. In his twenties he founded the Coltlumbia Party, a fringe group advocating for Southron independence. He is best known for his political essays about the uniqueness and importance of Southern culture as opposed to Northerner culture, which would sometimes rise to the point of screaming Jeremiads against Canterlot. Now that the Southrons are finally a free and independent people, Neighvis will go to any length to ensure that they remain that way."
 silverstar_desc:0 "Silverstar, Sherriff of Appleloosa, wouldn't have been anypony's first choice for the leader of a political party. However, looks can be very deceiving. However, when the Harmony-Unity Party was founded, he was elected as chairpony specifically *because* he hadn't stepped up for the job, and was therefore considered more trustworthy than the career politicians who most felt were only in it for themselves.\n\nStubborn, honest, and uncompromising, Silverstar is hesitant about change in general. While he wasn't thrilled by the decision to break away from Equestria, now that the ponies have chosen it he will defend it with uncompromising grit and gumption."
 rockfeller_desc:0 "Rockfeller's life has been one of catastrophic ups and downs. Born to a poor shoesmithing family, he fell into such destitution in his youth that he wandered into the desert to die. However, fate smiled on him as he uncovered an oil well, leading to the foundation of the Rockfeller business empire. His General Petroleum Company is practically the only oil business in southern Equus, and through years of graft and bribery he has amassed a powerful network of clients and patrons that runs through all of Southron society.\n\nNow that that fool Neighvis is out of the way, Rockfeller is free to pursue his dream, of a South as rich and free as he himself. So what if a few eggs have to be broken along the way?"
 SCS_dixie_horse_desc:0 "Born to an unprepared and uninterested single mother, Sorren grew up in the small southern town of Appleloosa without much, if any parental guidance. When he was of age, after a rough childhood of working in the railyards and driving trains, he volunteered for the Equestrian military, and it was quickly discovered that the large, rough-and-tumble pegasus was not suited for delicate operations. He was bold, aggressive, impulsive, and would often disregard orders in favor of his own gut feeling, to surprising and impressive success in the field. Sorren's relationship with Equestria's military was rocky, however; the pegasus was useful, but had to be kept on a very tight leash, one that he did not enjoy wearing.\n\nHoping to keep Sorren and those under his command out of trouble by relegating them to a lonely garrison in the south, Equestrian brass had done the exact opposite, as it was no less than two weeks later when the southern states proudly declared their secession from the north. It wasn't long before Sorren and his garrison were approached by southern militia, who brought with them a simple proposition: surrender, or join. Without a word, Sorren tore the rank and insignia from his Equestrian uniform, stepped forward to shake hooves, and joined the southern states."
 SCS_apple_waifu_desc:0 "Born to the established, and widely known and influential Apple Family, or at least one of many branches of the family, Apple Ale grew up with hard work, and a love of freedom and independence in life as foundations for her lessons throughout growing up.\n\nGrowing into becoming not only a bar owner and cider enthusiest, but would at a younger age than most Apples, inherit a plantation of her own. Before establishing a second and third, even buying more as she grew and expanded the Apple Ale miniature empire. After long a few factories, plantations, groves, and having a very arm chair, cider and cigar form of friendship and influence among other ponies of stature in the South of Equestria and throughout the rest of the nation. It came as no surprise when the South would give it's cry for independence, wanting Freedom and Independence to choose for itself over the Monarch's rule, that Ale was approached along with many other ponies in similar status and title, to lead and direct aspects of the new quickly established government. With minor hesitation and reluctance, she accepted and found herself at the forefront of the war effort. With her knowledge of supply and demand, and logistical prowess, no pony would go without proper supply under her command."
 SCS_moonshine_desc:0 "Moonshine was born in Hoofington, Southern Equestria, to a railways inspector and his wife. Combining her passion for history with an innate talent for music, she's enjoyed some popularity for her songs of great battles long passed.\n\nBy the time Equestria was torn asunder in civil war, Moonshine had developed a strong sense of Southern identity. With enemies on all sides and within, she will stand to defend her homeland to her last and write a song or two while she's at it. Sic semper tyrannis."

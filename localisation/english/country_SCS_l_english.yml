 rockfeller_desc:0 "Rockfeller's life has been one of catastrophic ups and downs. Born to a poor shoesmithing family, he fell into such destitution in his youth that he wandered into the desert to die. However, fate smiled on him as he uncovered an oil well, leading to the foundation of the Rockfeller business empire. His General Petroleum Company is practically the only oil business in southern Equus, and through years of graft and bribery he has amassed a powerful network of clients and patrons that runs through all of Southron society.\n\nNow that that fool Neighvis is out of the way, Rockfeller is free to pursue his dream, of a South as rich and free as he himself. So what if a few eggs have to be broken along the way?"

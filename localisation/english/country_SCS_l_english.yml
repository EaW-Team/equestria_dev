 SCS_grand_army_of_the_confederacy_desc:0 "The militia forces of the Minuteponies served us well, but we cannot rely on ad hoc irregular forces forever. A commission must be formed to create a new Grand Army of the Confederacy."
 SCS_right_to_bear_arms:0 "The Right To Bear Arms"
 SCS_right_to_bear_arms_desc:0 "The Gun shaped our culture, and few ponies in the south are far from one, even an old one. They keep the monsters and the bandits at bay... but we may have a bit of a problem with potential... friendly fire."
 SCS_national_security_act:0 "The National Security Act"
 SCS_national_security_act_desc:0 "The nation is newborn, and still weak. Untrustworthy ponies running around with guns is too much to handle right now. Law, order, rights, and peace!"
 SCS_the_southern_economy:0 "The Southern Economy"
 SCS_the_southern_economy_desc:0 "The Southern Economy rests on two things--oil and agriculture. The first we have in abundance, and the second is constantly threatened. Living as we do in the deserts and dry plains between Equestria and the Jungle, we must capitalize every advantage."
 SCS_no_regulations:0 "No Regulations, No Limits"
 SCS_no_regulations_desc:0 "The barons built the South, and they promise with unfettered hooves they can complete their work. Give them but a few years at least without restraint or unnecessary regulation, and they will create the Great Society we all long for And the Confederacy will be Rich."
 SCS_sober_middle_ground:0 "The Sober Middle Ground"
 SCS_sober_middle_ground_desc:0 "The extremes of dangerous deregulation and stifling over-regulation must be avoided. We cannot afford at this moment to strangle our nascent industry, but we refuse to crush the poor workers under the weight of the rich. Let us find a middle path."
 SCS_nanny_state:0 "Top-Down Regulation"
 SCS_nanny_state_desc:0 "Efficiency is not worth the cost in lives and quality of life. We can be efficient without being cartoonishly monstrous as the barons want. Let us preserve the rights of the workers and protect our society from these predators."
 SCS_the_agricultural_sector:0 "Physiocracy"
 SCS_the_agricultural_sector_desc:0 "The strength and wealth of nations lies in their agricultural production, or at least that's what our leading intellectuals say. It stands to reason that we should look to improve our farms."
 SCS_support_apple_barons:0 "The Apple Barons"
 SCS_support_apple_barons_desc:0 "The families which dominate the apple trade are some of the most powerful in the south. War and chaos has cut into their profits and their massive plantations require a market the size of Equestria itself to be sustainable. Perhaps subsidies?"
 SCS_support_small_farmers:0 "Pioneer Farming"
 SCS_support_small_farmers_desc:0 "The myth of the pioneer is strong, but the truth is that most family farms are a string of disasters. With education and resources, perhaps we can make these farms successful."
 SCS_massive_farms:0 "Big AgriBusiness"
 SCS_massive_farms_desc:0 "The diversifying Apple Barons need a bit more land, and we could use the extra tax income. Smaller farms and homesteads are practically a step away from failure, and letting the barons gobble up the land helps us all."
 SCS_new_frontier_ranches:0 "Farmer Co-Ops"

 SCS_land_clearance:0 "Clearing New Land"
 SCS_land_clearance_desc:0 "Now that our farmers have a better idea of how to use the land, its time to prepare more of it for cultivation and expansion. We've offered small but good loans to city ponies looking to farm who will train first, and they need space."

 SCS_public_rails:0 "Atlas Broken"
 SCS_public_rails_desc:0 "The royal rail lines have been abandoned, and must be reclaimed for the common ponies that depend on them to maintain their livelihoods! State ownerships keeps them away from the Baron's greed."
 SCS_state_capitalism:0 "A New South"
 SCS_state_capitalism_desc:0 "The Barons have had their years of luxury and unquestioned power. They wanted more unearned and unfought-for riches at our expense, and we refused. The South will rise by our work!"

 SCS_public_funding_guns:0 "Guns of the South"
 SCS_public_funding_guns_desc:0 "The Confederacy needs guns, and lots of them. To arm our troops and our state militias, the central government should empower the states and finance the construction of Confederal and State armories."

 SCS_harmonious_economy:0 "To Benefit All"
 SCS_harmonious_economy_desc:0 "The economy should serve the needs of ponies, and not ponies the needs of the economy. Our markets and systems were created to provide for our needs and desires, not to enslave us. We've set it all aright."

 SCS_drill_north_croissant:0 "Drill North Trotsas"
 SCS_drill_north_croissant_desc:0 "Drilling in the Central Trotsas has gone swell, but it could be better. Our geologists say that there's reserves north of our fields which would be ripe for the picking."

 SCS_marines_bonus:0 "Confederate Marines"
 SCS_marines_bonus_desc:0 "While amphibious assaults are a bit beyond us at the moment, establishing a marine corps might not be such a bad idea! If nothing else, fast and sturdy light infantry is already our modus operandi and has been since the militia."
 SCS_subs_cruisers_cost_discount:0 "Subs and Cruisers"
 SCS_subs_cruisers_cost_discount_desc:0 "Submarines to disrupt landings and enemy supply and cruisers to provide a wall of protection around our own ports and shoreline, that is what we need. Our new production techniques should make both easier to produce."

 SCS_heavy_planes:0 "Flying Fortresses"
 SCS_heavy_planes_desc:0 "Never get stuck picking the enemy apart on a small scale when you can deprive him of supplies all over. The senate has pushed our nascent airforce in the direction of strategic and tactical bombing, focusing on long distances over flashy flying."
 SCS_light_planes:0 "Harriers of the Sky"
 SCS_light_planes_desc:0 "The south hasn't had knights of any sort in a century or three, but that hasn't stopped the romanticism from carrying over. Tales like Ivanhorse have inspired generations of wouldbe southern cavaliers, and they are eager to take to the skies."
 SCS_air_doctrine_bonus:0 "Tuning Our Air Doctrines"
 SCS_air_doctrine_bonus_desc:0 "Just as had to tune our ground and naval doctrines, so to must our approach to war in the air be perfected. This is all new to us, and there is so little margin for error when you're in a flying machine far above the ground ready to explode."
 SCS_radar_bonus:0 "Scanning the Skies"
 SCS_radar_bonus_desc:0 "There were some that doubted RADAR was anything more than a pipedream, but the Confederate joint chiefs have put their faith behind it. RADAR is the way of the future, and we'll need to capitalize on its potential quickly."

 SCS_plane_production_cost_bonus_desc:0 "Some said it was impossible, but we've proven them wrong. The grand air force of the Confederacy stands ready to defend our blessed land's skies and to send packing any invasion of our airspace at a moment's notice."
 SCS_golden_circle_idea:0 "The Golden Horseshoe idea"
 SCS_golden_circle_idea_desc:0 "Stagnation is death. If the South is to remain strong, it paradoxically must be more than just the South. Some speak of making a golden horseshoe, expanding the meaning of 'south' to include colonies in the savage lands of Zebrica."

 SCS_guns_bonus:0 "Invest in Gun Tech"
 SCS_guns_bonus_desc:0 "Our old weapons are fine tools, but even the best tools become outdated. We need better rifles, but we also need artillery and machine guns for the wars of modernity. An investment today is victory tomorrow."
 SCS_tanks_light_or_heavy:0 "Confederate Armor"
 SCS_tanks_light_or_heavy_desc:0 "Some of our old militia captains were a bit hesitant about this tank business, but we've won them over. Armor is the way of the future, and any infantry force without it is toast. We need some of our own!"
 SCS_motorised_bonus:0 "Truckin' Along"
 SCS_motorised_bonus_desc:0 "Now, if there's one thing a southern soldier is excited about, its a nice new truck. Trucks are the range pony of modern warfare--they're reliable, fast, and carry a lot. Give us a few thousand of these and nothing will be out of our reach."
 SCS_fieldmarshal_advisor_stuart_recon_bonus:0 "General Stewed Apple"
 SCS_fieldmarshal_advisor_stuart_recon_bonus_desc:0 "Success in battle often comes down to who knows what. All the guns in the world won't win the day if they're not pointed the right way."
 SCS_skilled_scouts:0 "Confederate Scouts"
 SCS_skilled_scouts_desc:0 "We may have started as more rabble than army, but we're not fools. Before you can fight effectively, you need to know the lay of the land. Who better as scouts than frontier ponies?"
 SCS_breakthrough_bonus:0 "...To the Other Side"
 SCS_breakthrough_bonus_desc:0 "We have the charge down, but minimizing casualties and maximizing the effectiveness of our assaults is key to getting the most out of our brave boys. Better tactics means a safer Confederacy."
 SCS_eyes_and_ears_decryption:0 "Know Your Enemy"
 SCS_eyes_and_ears_decryption_desc:0 "Frontier ponies resourcefulness sometimes expresses itself in odd ways. We take inspiration from the courteseans and night doves of old who spied for the cause."
 SCS_armor_specialisation:0 "Heavy Metal Thunder"
 SCS_armor_specialisation_desc:0 "Nothing gets a country colt grinning like the sound of heavy machinery! Tanks that can punch through the enemy's line or hold onto valuable real estate will be what wins wars."
 SCS_fieldmarshal_advisor_lee:0 "Field Marshal Neigh"

 SCS_get_more_recruits:0 "Drum Up Some Fresh Blood"
 SCS_get_more_recruits_desc:0 "The frontier isn't exactly densely populated, so ponypower will always be an issue. But we can smooth that problem out in the short run with the help of some vigorous recruitment drives and signing bonuses."

 SCS_marse_robert_morale_desc:0 "A happy, confident soldier or citizen is a productive and useful one. This is a dangerous time, and we need everypony on deck if the States are to survive. Motivation and vigilance will keep our armies tough and our factories running."
 SCS_fieldmarshal_advisor_stonewall:0 "Field Marshal Stone Wall"
 SCS_fieldmarshal_advisor_stonewall_desc:0 "While Neigh is the strategic thinker, no pony alive has ever bested Stone Wall in the tactical game. His forces move thrice as fast and hit thrice as hard as they should--he is a ghost out of the jungle."
 SCS_anti_tank_anti_air:0 "Crack Those Tanks!"
 SCS_anti_tank_anti_air_desc:0 "Our infantry will struggle with tanks, but our air support might have better luck. We'll invest in research and development on close air support to give us the edge against armor."
 SCS_fire_discipline_soft_attack_bonus:0 "Trigger Discipline"
 SCS_fire_discipline_soft_attack_bonus_desc:0 "Our boys are brave, but sometimes a little rowdy. That's a good problem to have! We'll get them to wait till they see the whites of their eyes, and then we'll give 'em Tartarus."
 SCS_standing_like_a_stone_wall:0 "Standing Like a Stone Wall"
 SCS_standing_like_a_stone_wall_desc:0 "The general who said it of Stone Wall may have said it in exasperation, but now we say it with reverance. Stone Wall's trained his forces in defense and it will take an act of Celestia to move them."
 SCS_preserve_soldiers:0 "Every Life is Precious"
 SCS_preserve_soldiers_desc:0 "We may have left Equestria behind, but we kept some of their values. Harmony's concern for the value of pony life isn't just moralism--for us, it is practical. We can't afford to lose too many with our demographics."
 SCS_bigguns_doctrine:0 "Gunsmoke"
 SCS_bigguns_doctrine_desc:0 "A rifle is mighty fine, but a howitzer? Now there's what I'm talkin' 'bout! Get some of those bad boys a-firin', and ain't nopony gonna shrug it off."
 SCS_dugout_doctrine:0 "Southern Redoubts"
 SCS_dugout_doctrine_desc:0 "Every inch of our border is zeroed in and mapped out. Our soldiers can dig trenches and fortify literally anything in a matter of hours, turning every town, hill, and glade into a potential bastion."
 SCS_artillery_bonus:0 "Long Tall Sally"

 SCS_magical_weapons_desc:0 "Unicorns aren't quite as common down here as they are in Canterlot, but we have our share. We have some of our mages workin' hard on weaponizing magic for the common pony, and with a bit of funding..."
 SCS_engineers_bonus:0 "Dixie Engineering Program"
 SCS_engineers_bonus_desc:0 "As we pour more money into education and training, a nice byproduct is that our once ragtag forces now have access to actual, genuine engineers in abundance for the first time. We're putting them to work all over."

 SCS_stabilise_southeast_desc:0 "Soon after the outbreak of civil war in Equestria, the neighbouring south-eastern peninsula erupted into chaos and conflict.

 SCS_begin_the_island_hop_desc:0 "A Golden Horseshoe stretching across the islands, one where we can readily explo- civilize the islands of the ocean for the betterment of all, and which will be in our far more capable hooves than whatever pathetic excuse for a "government" they have set up. This is our destiny, to spread Confederate values across the seas!"
 SCS_the_summer_isles:0 "Occupy the Summer Isles"
 SCS_the_summer_isles_desc:0 "The Summer Islands are a quaint tourist destination with little economic value, but present themselves as the first step in our island hopping strategy. Nominally under Equestria's ownership, recent troubles means they will be exceptionally hard pressed to defend them, and this is the opportunity to strike."
 SCS_les_meridiennes:0 "Seize Les Meridiennes"
 SCS_les_meridiennes_desc:0 "Further below is the Aquileian colony of Les Meridiennes, known for its eclectic demographics and diverse culture. Ever since the isles exchanged ownership from the Saddle Arabians, Aquileia has more or less neglected them. Truly they would be better off under our guidance."

 SCS_drive_out_the_seaponies_desc:0 "The seaponies, arrogant as they are, consider themselves to be the owners of all beneath the waves and currents. They can keep those (for now), but we are more interested in claiming the various islands they've settled for our purposes."
 SCS_talk_with_wingbardy:0 "Buy Wingbardy's Colonies"
 SCS_talk_with_wingbardy_desc:0 "While most major powers in Equus or Griffonia hold little influence down under in Zebrica, [WNG.GetNameDef] has recently seized territory from Abyssinia. Their rule is proving unpopular with the locals, and their troubles at home mean their hold is tenuous. Perhaps some of their idols will convince them to leave them under our care?"
 SCS_invade_abyssinia:0 "The Abyssinian Hoofhold"
 SCS_invade_abyssinia_desc:0 "Abyssinia is a derelict nation that's been defiled twice, first by the Storm King, then by the Wingbardians.

 SCS_will_attract_investment:0 "§YWill attract increased investment from Equestrian expats.§!"

 braeburn_desc:0 "A member of the ancient Apple family, Braeburn was just a humble farmer before Equestria's descent into chaos. When the South declared independence, he rose to prominence as one of the most vocal opponents of the Neighvis government. Though he felt a fierce desire to simply march over the border and join the Equestrian army, his family persuaded him that his place was here, in Appleloosa. Instead, he joined the Equestrian Sun Party and quickly rose through its ranks through charisma and sheer force of conviction.\n\nNow the leader of a nation he wishes didn't exist, Braeburn is sure to align the South back toward Equestria. Whether that means requesting re-annexation or just fighting alongside the Princess remains to be seen."
 neighvis_desc:0 "Born to one of the oldest monied dynasties in the South, Neighvis was practically destined for a life of comfort - that was, until his family fell on hard times following a series of poor business decisions. A young Neighvis was forced to watch as the home of his birth was sold to Northern up-and-coming businessponies, and that grudge has been nursed over the course of fifty-odd years of life.\n\nNeighvis built his name gradually, bit by bit, through constant application to the art of letters, writing on a wide variety of topics until he eventually became a popular author. In his twenties he founded the Coltlumbia Party, a fringe group advocating for Southron independence. He is best known for his political essays about the uniqueness and importance of Southern culture as opposed to Northerner culture, which would sometimes rise to the point of screaming Jeremiads against Canterlot. Now that the Southrons are finally a free and independent people, Neighvis will go to any length to ensure that they remain that way."
 silverstar_desc:0 "Silverstar, Sherriff of Appleloosa, wouldn't have been anypony's first choice for the leader of a political party. However, looks can be very deceiving. However, when the Harmony-Unity Party was founded, he was elected as chairpony specifically *because* he hadn't stepped up for the job, and was therefore considered more trustworthy than the career politicians who most felt were only in it for themselves.\n\nStubborn, honest, and uncompromising, Silverstar is hesitant about change in general. While he wasn't thrilled by the decision to break away from Equestria, now that the ponies have chosen it he will defend it with uncompromising grit and gumption."
 rockfeller_desc:0 "Rockfeller's life has been one of catastrophic ups and downs. Born to a poor shoesmithing family, he fell into such destitution in his youth that he wandered into the desert to die. However, fate smiled on him as he uncovered an oil well, leading to the foundation of the Rockfeller business empire. His General Petroleum Company is practically the only oil business in southern Equus, and through years of graft and bribery he has amassed a powerful network of clients and patrons that runs through all of Southron society.\n\nNow that that fool Neighvis is out of the way, Rockfeller is free to pursue his dream, of a South as rich and free as he himself. So what if a few eggs have to be broken along the way?"
 SCS_dixie_horse_desc:0 "Born to an unprepared and uninterested single mother, Sorren grew up in the small southern town of Appleloosa without much, if any parental guidance. When he was of age, after a rough childhood of working in the railyards and driving trains, he volunteered for the Equestrian military, and it was quickly discovered that the large, rough-and-tumble pegasus was not suited for delicate operations. He was bold, aggressive, impulsive, and would often disregard orders in favor of his own gut feeling, to surprising and impressive success in the field. Sorren's relationship with Equestria's military was rocky, however; the pegasus was useful, but had to be kept on a very tight leash, one that he did not enjoy wearing.\n\nHoping to keep Sorren and those under his command out of trouble by relegating them to a lonely garrison in the south, Equestrian brass had done the exact opposite, as it was no less than two weeks later when the southern states proudly declared their secession from the north. It wasn't long before Sorren and his garrison were approached by southern militia, who brought with them a simple proposition: surrender, or join. Without a word, Sorren tore the rank and insignia from his Equestrian uniform, stepped forward to shake hooves, and joined the southern states."
 SCS_apple_waifu_desc:0 "Born to the established, and widely known and influential Apple Family, or at least one of many branches of the family, Apple Ale grew up with hard work, and a love of freedom and independence in life as foundations for her lessons throughout growing up.\n\nGrowing into becoming not only a bar owner and cider enthusiest, but would at a younger age than most Apples, inherit a plantation of her own. Before establishing a second and third, even buying more as she grew and expanded the Apple Ale miniature empire. After long a few factories, plantations, groves, and having a very arm chair, cider and cigar form of friendship and influence among other ponies of stature in the South of Equestria and throughout the rest of the nation. It came as no surprise when the South would give it's cry for independence, wanting Freedom and Independence to choose for itself over the Monarch's rule, that Ale was approached along with many other ponies in similar status and title, to lead and direct aspects of the new quickly established government.

 SCS_moonshine_desc:0 "Moonshine was born in Hoofington, Southern Equestria, to a railways inspector and his wife. Combining her passion for history with an innate talent for music, she's enjoyed some popularity for her songs of great battles long passed.\n\nBy the time Equestria was torn asunder in civil war, Moonshine had developed a strong sense of Southern identity. With enemies on all sides and within, she will stand to defend her homeland to her last and write a song or two while she's at it. Sic semper tyrannis."

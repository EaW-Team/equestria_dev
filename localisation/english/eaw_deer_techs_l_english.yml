 tech_deer_misc_desc:0 "Through their special connection with spirits, some deer can detect minerals through the soil. It is similar to what certain ponies can accomplish, but our prowess goes further and wider."
 tech_deer_misc2:0 "Modern Economic Theory"
 tech_deer_misc2_desc:0 "For long our economics have been backwards, and in order for us to have hope of competing in the future, we must modernise."

 tech_deer_naval:0 "New Shipbuilding Methods"

 tech_deer_naval3:0 "Merchant Ship Designs"
 tech_deer_naval3_desc:0 "While it may be tempting for us to focus all of our naval resources on warfare, we must not forget what fuels the war machine- trade. By modernising the trade fleet of our merchant classes, we can produce them much more efficiently, and therefore trade more."

 tech_deer_seer_a:0 "Strategic Visions"
 tech_deer_seer_a_desc:0 "We must not let our intelligence programs go unaffected by a practice that could benefit it as much as it can from seeing- by training old and new spies and specialists in gaining and deciphering glimpses of the future, we can hopefully prevent and attempts at infiltration by enemies of the state."

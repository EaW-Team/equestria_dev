### Country leader descriptions ###
TAL_duchess_ginerva_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 13th of May, 965 in Talononte\n\n§YBiography§!: Ginevra di Chiazbini was born the eldest child of Duke Giovanni III of Talouse. She grew up in the comfort of the Ducal Palace, and was mostly carefree, consuming the knowledge given to her by her mentors. At an early age, she demonstrated a level of unmatched decisiveness, as well as her infamous temper, which greatly contrasted her patient and naive father. Her pleasant life was turned upside down by the Falcor War, which raged from 985-989 ALB. As the war progressed, she saw her father's health rapidly deteriorate, alongside the nation's economy. After the war's end, there was a glimmer of hope for Ginevra when she married her lifelong sweetheart, the handsome Victor di Altomondi. This time of good feelings was short-lived however, as in 992, her father died of a heart attack, and the young griffoness was crowned Duchess. Ever since then, she has been a staunch pacifist, denouncing war and its horrors. Even though she was a pacifist, her belligerent constitution remained, being further incensed by the post-war economic issues. During the strike of 1003, she famously stormed into Parliament, demanding that a resolution be passed, and quickly. While this garnered the support of the common folk, she alienated parts of the upper echelons of Talousian society, who viewed it as barbaric and improper for a lady of such high standing. Today, the Duchess is mostly well-liked, and many workers herald her as a people's monarch. However, trouble is brewing in Talouse, and it remains to be seen whether Ginevra will lead her family's ancient legacy to greatness, or be its downfall. \n\n§YPortrait By§!: Scroup"

TAL_marco_paltori_desc:0"§YBorn§!: 15th of March, 972 in Talononte\n\n§YBiography§!: Marco Paltori was born in a suburb of Talononte just days after Talouse's fateful secession from the Griffonian Empire. The establishment of a national Parliament and the Duchy's first industrialisation programmes came shortly after, coinciding with the rise of the Karthinian Pact as the premier power bloc in Southern Griffonia. All throughout his childhood, Paltori saw a world that was changing rapidly, and his imagination became captivated by new possibilities for himself and his country.\n\nHis time spent studying political philosophy in university caused him to become sympathetic towards the Partito Liberale, and shortly after graduating he made his debut onto the political scene as a PL candidate for Parliament. Paltori emerged victorious, and before long gained a reputation as a passionate reformist determined to bring Talouse into the modern age. His rhetoric coupled individual freedom with national pride, and his unequivocal opposition to the Coal Clause made him stand out from the older generation of PL figures. In light of this, it did not take long for him to surpass them all in popularity.\n\nPaltori's high standing with the people propelled the PL to new heights of electoral success, and he completed his meteoric rise to the position of Prime Minister just a few years after first entering Parliament. However, Paltori's tenure as Prime Minister proved to be a rocky one. Despite his youthful energy, he was still a novice in the political sphere, and this inexperience greatly hindered his agenda. He struggled with Parliament to put his economic reforms into practice and, most embarrassingly, he was unable to secure Wingbardian cooperation for his first attempt to end the Coal Clause.\n\nDespite these setbacks, Paltori remains undaunted and committed to transforming Talousian society. His public statements strike an optimistic tone towards the project of liberalisation, and he frequently claims that he will not rest until Talouse stands free and proud: out from the shackles of the past and ready to seize its own future.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: MonAx"
TAL_amilcare_fetivola_desc:0"§YBorn§!: 2nd of May, 961 in Navarro\n\n§YBiography§!: Undoubtedly the most controversial voice in Talousian politics, Amilcare Fetivola began his pursuit of truth at a young age. By the time he reached university, he believed firmly in the value of traditional wisdom, and eventually developed his ideas into a fully-realised ideology, seeing a return to tradition as a remedy to the ills of modernity. Fetivola's brief stint as a history professor was cut short by his own restlessness—not content to live the life of an academic, he decided to enter into politics, joining the FLT in 991 and becoming active in the socialist movement.\n\nHis membership in the party lasted only four years before he was expelled for espousing ideas incompatible with the FLT's core platform. Shortly after this, Fetivola published his manifesto: "Revolt Against The Modern World," in which he described his beliefs about renewing faith in Arantigos, restoring the customs and language of ancient Talonsia, and resurrecting the glorious "Warden of the South."\n\nHis manifesto attracted a small but devout following drawn from the middle class, poor farmers, anti-communists, and youths disillusioned by the economic depression. Leading these "Fetivolists," he went on to form the Lega per il Restauro Nazionale (LRN), which became the major far-right group in Talouse, supplanting the pro-Wingbardian Succursale Talousiano delle Ali Nere (STAN). Now that the LRN has completed its meteoric rise, Fetivola finally has the power to take control of the nation, and work towards the destiny he knows awaits him.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: MonAx"
TAL_emmanuel_talnara_desc:0"§YBorn§!: 7th of August, 964 in Talononte\n\n§YBiography§!: For nearly two decades, one griffon has stood alone at the forefront of Talouse's labour movement: Emmanuel Talnara. Born to a working-class family in a poor neighborhood in Talononte, Talnara received a mediocre education, going straight to work in a factory after graduating from secondary school in 981. He toiled there for six long years before becoming a journalist for an underground newspaper promoting Marksist ideas, an influential period of his life which saw his interest in revolutionary activity fully blossom.\n\nThe end of the Falcor War in 989 left the Wingbardian economy in tatters, and the domino effect proved devastating for the Talousian economy as well. Sensing an opening, Talnara used his platform to unite the many discontented workers into the Fronte Laburista Talusiano (FLT), attracting legions of urban labourers and coal miners. He organised the failed strike of 998, which resulted in his brief incarceration, as well as the Great Strike of 1003, the largest in Talousian history.\n\nAlthough he has achieved astonishing victories over the years and already cemented his status as a titan of the socialist movement, simply keeping the FLT together may prove to be his toughest task yet. He is quite moderate compared to the newer generation of leftists, having dedicated himself to forging a lasting compromise between the urban syndicalist and the miner communalist factions of his party. Despite these efforts, many suspect that he is past his prime, and that the beast he created will inevitably break free from his control.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: MonAx"
TAL_colliverde_desc:0"§YBorn§!: 24th of June, 953 in Luchihoot\n\n§YBiography§!: The favourite daughter of Luchihoot and member of a minor noble family hailing from northern Talouse, Antonia di Colliverde is a throwback to a simpler era of Talousian politics. She came of age during the South's secession from the Griffonian Empire, and witnessed first-claw the economic boom that followed. Seeing the hope and prosperity which was gained through cooperation greatly influenced her worldview, and to this day she remains one of the most unabashedly pro-Wingbardian figures in Talouse.\n\nShe joined the Partito Conservatore shortly after its creation, and eventually won a seat in parliament during the PC's landslide victory in the snap elections of 983. However, the start of the Falcor War just two years later would mark a turning point for the party's fortunes. Over the four year course of the war, around 20,000 Talousian soldiers were sent to the Falcorian front, with thousands dying before it ended. Those that returned were scarred by the horrors of war, and many began to voice discontent with the nation's diplomatic policy. In addition, the conflict had left the Wingbardian economy in tatters, leaving them unable to pay back their debts to Talouse. The ensuing economic devastation shattered a generation of young griffons' trust in the status quo, signalling the start of a long and slow decline in PC popularity, paving the way for the Partito Liberale to rise and become the dominant force in parliament.\n\nThroughout all her years in public life, di Colliverde has been a staunch supporter of conservative economic and social policies. These are mainly geared toward recreating the conditions of 970s Talouse, which she believes to have been its golden age. While realising the necessity of limited reform, she does not favour completely eliminating the Coal Clause, a position not favoured by the general populace. Despite these headwinds, she has presided over a genuine resurgence for her party, at last gaining a chance to repair the nation's rifts and forge an even stronger alliance with Wingbardy.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: MonAx"
TAL_giulia_rosbeccini_desc:0"§YBorn§!: 18th of December, 981 in Talononte\n\n§YBiography§!: Much like her predecessor, Emmanuel Talnara, Giulia Rosbeccini was born in a poor working neighborhood in Talononte to a left-leaning family. As such, she was exposed to the FLT at a young age and quickly became enamored with both syndicalism and the theory of worker's liberation. This affinity carried over into adulthood, and she joined the FLT only a few months after beginning work in a factory in 1001.\n\nThanks to her natural intellect and ability to rile up crowds with passionate speeches, she rapidly rose through the ranks of the party. Her claim to fame came when she was tasked with organising nearly half of Talononte's industrial workers to strike in the infamous Strike of 1003, which she did impeccably. By 1007, she was second only to Talnara in terms of authority and popularity within the FLT, having gained a reputation as an uncompromising radical and figurehead of the hard-line syndicalist faction.\n\nAfter the party's acrimonious schism, circumstances called for a fresh face to take the reins of the party's leadership, and Rosbeccini was eager to step up. Although she still respects the old griffon Talnara, she always saw him as too weak and idealistic. Events have proved her right, having demonstrated that for all Talnara's attempts at compromise, in the end there was no common ground on which to stand. Believing that a worker's Talouse will never survive if it stands alone against the rest of the world, she is dedicated to the prospect of spreading the Revolution to the rest of Southern Griffonia and establishing a grand, region-wide union.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: MonAx"

#LRN Voting Focuses
TAL_a_new_start:0 "Elections of 1007"
TAL_a_new_start_desc:0 "Talouse, a land once noble and wealthy, has succumbed to corruption and poverty. The economy continues to falter, and the population grows restless. While Paltori's cabinet has enacted some reforms, many feel that they are not enough, putting forward their own visions for Talouse. With the elections fast approaching, only one of these designs for the small nation will make it out on top."
TAL_vote_for_LRN:0 "Support the LRN"
TAL_vote_for_LRN_desc:0 "The Lega per il Restauro Nazionale (LRN) is one of the more radical factions in Talousian politics. Headed by the eccentric, yet charismatic, Amilcare Fetivola, the party seeks to eradicate what they perceive as the corruptions of modernity, and restore the institutions of ancient Talonsia, a successor of the Kingdom of Sparléos that once ruled over Talouse."
TAL_speakout_against_other_partiesandmonarchy_LRN:0 "Denounce Our Rivals"
TAL_speakout_against_other_partiesandmonarchy_LRN_desc:0 "The LRN has been a laughing stock for the corrupt bigwigs and unionists for decades. We must right these slanders, and show the commoners the monsters that have run this country into the ground."
TAL_promote_old_language_and_culture:0 "Remind the People"
TAL_promote_old_language_and_culture_desc:0 "Our ancient ways were glorious, and once brought us great power. However, they have been lost and forgotten and it is up to us to remind the people of what they have lost."

TAL_a_glourious_future_desc:0 "Many griffs doubt our intentions, thinking us, at best, loons. We must convince them that we have their best intentions at heart and that we wish to lead Talouse to the glorious future it deserves."
TAL_by_any_means_necessary:0 "Secure the Ballot"
TAL_by_any_means_necessary_desc:0 "The LRN is not one of the large parties of Talouse. We lack both corporate backing and mainstream attention. If we want a shot at victory, we must use all methods possible to secure it. \n\n§RYou must keep an eye on your Decisions otherwise the path for an LRN victory becomes harder.§!"
TAL_recieve_funds_from_supporters:0 "Donations From Supporters"
TAL_recieve_funds_from_supporters_desc:0 "The LRN is not a corrupt political machine, with billions to spend on a campaign. As such, we will rely on donations from our generous supporters, which is the way things should be."
#PC Voting Focuses
TAL_vote_for_PC:0 "Support the PC"
TAL_vote_for_PC_desc:0 "The Partito Conservatore (PC) is one of Talouse's oldest political parties, and was once at the forefront of Talousian politics. However, the party has lost steam in recent years, known only for its appeal to seniors. The party prides itself on championing traditional values and maintaining good relations with Wingbardy and the rest of the Karthinian Pact."
TAL_promote_PC:0 "Promote the Party"
TAL_promote_PC_desc:0 "For the past decade, the party's popularity has been on a noticeable decline. If we want any shot at victory, we must promote our party and our values and spread the word so that people may know that the PC is not yet lost."
TAL_give_speeches_PC:0 "Speeches and Rallies"
TAL_give_speeches_PC_desc:0 "To restore the people's faith in our party, we will host a series of rallies across the nation. We will travel from city to city, and give speeches to rouse the people's spirit and secure their vote. As an added benefit, we can use this as an opportunity to throw some shade at the FLT and weaken their hold over the commonfolk."
TAL_recieve_boomer_funding:0 "Collect Civilian Funding"
TAL_recieve_boomer_funding_desc:0 "As the years have gone by, our voter base has come to largely consist of senior citizens that dote fondly on post-Imperial Talouse. While this has somewhat tarnished our party's reputation, we can use this to our advantage. Considering most of our supporters are wealthy pensioners, we can rekindle their nostalgia for our golden days to collect sufficient funding for our campaign."
TAL_denounce_the_other_parties:0 "Decry the Opposition"
TAL_denounce_the_other_parties_desc:0 "The number of opposition parties has grown since the end of the Falcor War. These radicals seek nothing but the total destruction of Talouse's values and diplomatic relations. We must show the people that they have been misled by these extremists and that Talouse must return to the ways of tradition, and embrace her position on the global stage."
TAL_donate_to_good_causes:0 "Donate to Charities"
TAL_donate_to_good_causes_desc:0 "One of the values our party espouses is generosity. To that end, we will donate some of our campaign money to good charities, not only to support noble causes that we believe in, but to also demonstrate our dedication to upholding our values, and those of our forefathers."
#PL Voting Focuses
TAL_vote_for_PL:0 "Support the PL"
TAL_vote_for_PL_desc:0 "The Partito Liberale (PL), which had secured the Parliament in 1005, has been the leading party in Talousian politics recently. Led by the well-loved Marco Paltori, the party has been pushing for reform, advocating for greater economic freedom and increased protection for workers. With the Duchess' support, it is well on its way to bringing real change to Talouse."
TAL_rally_the_supporters:0 "Rally Our Supporters"
TAL_rally_the_supporters_desc:0 "As the election gets underway, it is vital for the party to reach out to its members across the nation. By rallying our supporters, we can ensure a high turnout of pro-PL voters, and secure our re-election."
TAL_allocate_funding_to_social_programs:0 "Fund Social Programs"
TAL_allocate_funding_to_social_programs_desc:0 "The PL is the wealthiest political organization in all of Talouse, with millions of idols coming in from public donations and corporate backers. With all of this wealth in our possession, we can afford to allocate some of it to fund social programs to aid the lower classes. This would serve to improve the party's opinion in the eyes of both the lower classes and our current voter base."
TAL_promote_harmonic_ideals:0 "Promote Our Ideals"
TAL_promote_harmonic_ideals_desc:0 "Over the past decade, radical beliefs have spread through Talouse, and extremist groups are becoming more and more popular. We must use our platform to spread our ideals of liberty and equality across the nation, and speak out against the spread of extremist organizations and their beliefs."
TAL_support_monarchy_and_parliment:0 "Uphold Our Institutions"
TAL_support_monarchy_and_parliment_desc:0 "In recent years, support for the monarchy and the Parliament, especially, has declined from a combination of insufficient action to address the Falcor War's fallout and extremist rhetoric. While these institutions aren't perfect, they provide stability for the nation, and, if run properly, can be very effective. As such, we must endorse these government bodies, and show our support for these vital institutions."
TAL_aid_to_those_in_need:0 "Aid the Needy"
TAL_aid_to_those_in_need_desc:0 "Ever since the end of the Falcor War, Talouse has seen an increase in poverty, unemployment, and homelessness. Starving griffs wander the streets, scraping by on donations from kind strangers. This state of affairs is appalling. We will use some of our campaign funding, as well as public donations, to launch welfare programs to aid those in need. This will provide a long-term benefit to the economy and our party."
#FLT Voting Focuses
TAL_vote_for_FLT:0 "Support the FLT"
TAL_vote_for_FLT_desc:0 "The Fronte Laburista Talusiano (FLT) has spearheaded the Talousian labour movement since the end of the Falcor War over 20 years ago. The front consists of a coalition between the urban syndicalist faction and the Highland communalist faction. Though the coalition is uneasy at times, its goal of drastic economical, societal, and political reform in pursuit of the workers' liberation keeps it together."
TAL_unite_the_party:0 "Unify the Front"
TAL_unite_the_party_desc:0 "Even though the FLT seeks to liberate Talouse's workers, the two factions disagree on how to achieve it. Disagreements and factionalism have weakened the coalition, and something must be done to alleviate this, lest the front collapse all together. To that end, we will organize meetings and other events to promote unity in the front, and ensure that election goes over smoothly."
TAL_speak_out_against_PL_PC_LRN_monarchy:0 "Expose the Oppressors"
TAL_speak_out_against_PL_PC_LRN_monarchy_desc:0 "The people of Talouse have been hoodwinked by the bourgeois oppressors into supporting their capitalist regime. This has gone on for far too long! The people must be shown the corruption of their government, the hypocrisy of the PL and PC, and the destructive madness of the LRN. The commongriffs will see the rot that surrounds them and join together to bring it down."

TAL_promote_communist_ideals_desc:0 "To secure the vote, we must enlighten the Talousian voters, and inspire them to join the revolutionary struggle. To ensure our message is heard far and wide, we will produce a manifesto that displays the front's core values and display it in every town across the nation. That way, the people will know of our ideals and our dedication to their liberation."
TAL_do_anything_to_win:0 "Ensure Our Victory"
TAL_do_anything_to_win_desc:0 "The front has many enemies, waiting for an opportunity to sabotage it. As such, we must always remain vigilant, and do whatever is necessary to ensure that the revolution succeeds. \n\n§RYou must keep an eye on your Decisions otherwise the path for an FLT victory becomes harder.§!"
TAL_worker_union_strikes:0 "Organize Miner Strikes"
TAL_worker_union_strikes_desc:0 "The front represents the industrial labourers of Talouse, as well as her miners. We must stand in solidarity with the latter, who have been exploited ruthlessly for decades. We will begin a series of small strikes and march in the streets to show our devotion to the miners' cause and our intolerance for the oppression of the proletariat."
#PC Main Tree
TAL_PC_start:0 "PC Victory"
TAL_PC_start_desc:0 "Against all odds, the PC has seemingly rebounded from its decline, and has managed to achieve victory in the election, reclaiming the Parliament from the PL. The party will now dedicate itself towards the preservation of Talouse's values and its rightful place as a member of the Karthinian Pact."
TAL_the_PC_win_the_majority_of_seats:0 "The Real Work Begins"
TAL_the_PC_win_the_majority_of_seats_desc:0 "We have won the contest of popularity, true, but our true test still lies ahead: governing wisely and improving the state of the nation. We must always remember this overriding imperative as we take our seats in parliament."
TAL_discuss_coal_clause:0 "Discuss the Coal Clause"
TAL_discuss_coal_clause_desc:0 "Over the years, our government has been extraordinarily patient with Wingbardy, even as our people have grown more and more incensed at the sight of foreign mining interests claiming the resources of Talouse as their own. Simply put, public dissatisfaction has grown to the point where something has to give. Surely Wingbardy must understand this as well."
TAL_reach_agreement_with_WNG:0 "Reach an Agreement"
TAL_reach_agreement_with_WNG_desc:0 "Fortunately, Wingbardian representatives have proven to be every bit as reasonable as we had hoped! We have come to a mutually satisfactory agreement, and all that remains is to apply the finishing touches before revealing it to the world."
TAL_use_money_to_jump_start_economy:0 "Jump Start the Economy"
TAL_use_money_to_jump_start_economy_desc:0 "Now that we are receiving a great deal of compensation for our lost resources, we can use this money to provide a jolt to the stagnant economy. We must not delay—even small investments now will pay huge dividends down the road."
TAL_evaluate_domestic_situation:0 "Evaluate the Domestic Situation"
TAL_evaluate_domestic_situation_desc:0 "Although Talouse avoided a disastrous outcome in the recent election, the fact remains that our nation is still deeply divided and plagued by instability. Unless we address the root causes, this unrest might boil over into outright violence at any time."
TAL_support_karthinian_pact:0 "Reinforce the Pact"
TAL_support_karthinian_pact_desc:0 "Membership in the Karthinian Pact has been vital for maintaining our security these past decades, as well as being responsible for Talouse's transition to a modern industrialised state. Let the world know that we will continue to do all we can to bolster this indispensable alliance!"
TAL_promote_idea_other_parties_are_a_threat:0 "Talouse: One and Indivisible"
TAL_promote_idea_other_parties_are_a_threat_desc:0 "Undoubtedly the greatest threat to our future prosperity is the rise of divisive factionalism which does little more than weaken the nation. If Talouse is to survive and prosper, its people must put an end to their petty squabbling and come together in support of their government."
TAL_build_local_industries:0 "Build Up Local Industries"
TAL_build_local_industries_desc:0 "Now that the Coal Clause has been restructured to be more equitable, the time has come for us to move beyond such heavy reliance on foreign aid. We must begin the process of building up our own industry, so that more griffons will be free to leave the shrinking agricultural sector."
TAL_obtain_additional_aid_in_exchange_for_resources:0 "Aid for Resources"
TAL_obtain_additional_aid_in_exchange_for_resources_desc:0 "There are many sources of foreign capital which have expressed an interest in investing in Talouse over the years. It would be a simple matter to acquire additional economic aid in exchange for some of our resources."
TAL_endorse_the_duchess:0 "Extoll Ginevra"
TAL_endorse_the_duchess_desc:0 "After a period of such fear and uncertainty, the nation is in need of a symbol to rally around—Duchess Ginevra is that symbol. Soon she will commence a tour of the country, which will provide a golden opportunity for the whole nation to come together and heal in the spirit of unity."
TAL_attempt_to_employ_the_lower_income:0 "Put an End to Poverty"
TAL_attempt_to_employ_the_lower_income_desc:0 "The only way to create a stable, prosperous society is by eliminating poverty and improving living conditions for residents of low-income communities. Helping the poor gain access to economic opportunities long denied them will greatly harm the recruiting efforts of revolutionary groups."
TAL_expand_industries:0 "Industrial Expansion"
TAL_expand_industries_desc:0 "As our current level of economic development is somewhat behind the times, a renewed push to improve our industrial capabilities is a no-brainer in terms of beneficial actions available to us. Let us embark on this initiative without delay."
TAL_education_health_reforms_PC:0 "Education and Health Reforms"
TAL_education_health_reforms_PC_desc:0 "A key part of our domestic programme must be expanding the government's roles in education and health care as poverty reduction strategies. After all, our aim is not only to relieve the symptom of poverty, but to cure it and, above all, to prevent it."
TAL_figure_out_whats_next:0 "Looking Outwards"
TAL_figure_out_whats_next_desc:0 "It took some doing, but we have reversed the economic downturn and put the country back on the right track. In addition, due to our ambitious set domestic programmes, the portion of Talousians living below the poverty line has declined dramatically. None can deny that the times of hardship are behind us, and the nation is finally ready to step out into the world."
TAL_breakoff_from_pact:0 "Abandon the Pact"
TAL_breakoff_from_pact_desc:0 "Tragically, Wingbardy's fall to the forces of radicalism renders our values incompatible with those of the Karthinian Pact: a sad day for an alliance which once represented a light of hope for the South. The nation we looked to for guidance countless times in the past now serves as little more than a cautionary tale for the price of failure."
TAL_build_mil_PC:0 "Prepare for War"
TAL_build_mil_PC_desc:0 "Without the protection provided by our old alliance, we are forced to defend ourselves. Fending off Wingbardy will require an army larger and more ferocious than any Talouse has ever raised before, but we do not shrink from the challenge. Countless citizens have already risen to the occasion by enlisting, and several brilliant new generals are finally ready to take command."
TAL_address_the_nation:0 "Steel Our Spirits"
TAL_address_the_nation_desc:0 "Recent events have forced Talouse into a somewhat precarious position, estranged from our longtime allies. This upheaval has sent destabilising ripples of fear and uncertainty throughout the populace. In times such as these, griffons turn to their leaders for guidance, and so we must reassure our citizens to bolster their confidence in the government."
TAL_on_our_own_PC:0 "Defiant to the End"
TAL_on_our_own_PC_desc:0 "Come what may, Talouse stands proud in defence of our sovereignty, as we did alongside Wingbardy in the glorious year of 972. Even as those values have been betrayed by our former allies, our nation will always be a force for stability in the region and prosperity for its people, and we will never surrender!"
TAL_become_the_stronk_money_power_for_allies:0 "Bankroll Our Allies"
TAL_become_the_stronk_money_power_for_allies_desc:0 "Now that the Talousian economy has fully recovered, we are finally in a position to provide substantial monetary support to our alliance. By making such commitments, we can become the premier financial power in the Karthinian Pact: a prestigious title indeed!"
TAL_build_more_industries:0 "Talousian Industry"
TAL_build_more_industries_desc:0 "Although we understand the value of inter-Pact cooperation, at the same time we must not neglect the need to further build up our industrial capacity. After all, we can not effectively provide aid to others if we are not completely stable ourselves."
TAL_invest_more:0 "New Investments"
TAL_invest_more_desc:0 "The investments we made after receiving our first batch of Coal Clause compensation look to be extremely promising. Thanks to our close alliance with Wingbardy, funds for Talousian development are easier to acquire than ever, and another round of investment would be highly beneficial."
TAL_for_our_pact_PC:0 "Towards an Age of Peace"
TAL_for_our_pact_PC_desc:0 "It is with great pride that we stand alongside our Wingbardian brothers—they have walked the same path we have while sharing the values which we have come to cherish. In light of this, we shall remain eternally committed to the Karthinian Pact, so that together we might usher in an era of peace and prosperity for all the South."
TAL_limited_trade:0 "Assertiveness"
TAL_limited_trade_desc:0 "Now that it has become obvious that Wingbardy has shifted away from their old politics, the time has come for us to adopt a stronger posture towards the Pact. In the face of a new government with uncertain aims, we must use all our leverage to advance Talousian interests."
TAL_allow_some_trade:0 "Allow Some Trade"
TAL_allow_some_trade_desc:0 "Merchants from far and wide already flock to Talousian ports, eager to make a profit in lucrative southern trade networks. Opening up trade with our allies will grow this bustling exchange even further, providing new and exciting money making opportunities which will no doubt be a great boon to the Talousian economy."
TAL_support_our_own_economy_and_mil:0 "By Our Own Bootstraps"
TAL_support_our_own_economy_and_mil_desc:0 "Being a member of the Karthinian Pact does not mean we should come to rely on our allies too heavily. We must continue to develop our army and military industry, so that Talouse will be prepared to defend itself should the need ever arise."
TAL_a_different_path_PC:0 "The Southern Bulwark"
TAL_a_different_path_PC_desc:0 "Along the shores of southern Griffonia, Talouse stands a stronghold of stability: a nation whose citizens are safer and more secure than any others in the world. We, the stalwart defenders of order, preserve peace in the region so that its griffons will be eternally safe from the dangers of radicalism and tyranny."
#PL Main Tree
TAL_PL_start:0 "PL Victory"
TAL_PL_start_desc:0 "In spite of the tough competition, the PL has managed to hold on to their Parliamentary majority. With the election cycle behind him, Paltori can resume his initiative of much-needed reforms to Talouse's economy, society, and politics, so that Talouse may shine as brightly as the star upon her flag."
TAL_start_to_kill_the_coal_clause_PL:0 "Kill the Coal Clause"
TAL_start_to_kill_the_coal_clause_PL_desc:0 "Our party secured reelection in large part due to Paltori's promise to revoke the Coal Clause. On this issue, the will of the Talousian people is clear: the time has come for us to reassert control over our natural resources! Unfortunately, the process will not be so straightforward, and we will have to work with Wingbardy every step of the way to come to an agreement."
TAL_phase_1:0 "A Firm Clawshake"
TAL_phase_1_desc:0 "It is important to strike the right tone when greeting our guests: friendly, but determined. Earning their respect is critical to being taken seriously in the negotiations, otherwise the Wingbardians might well see us as subordinates rather than partners."
TAL_phase_2:0 "Use Our Leverage"
TAL_phase_2_desc:0 "Despite what the casual observer might think, Wingbardy does not hold all the cards in these negotiations: the Talousian Highlands contain many resources which are vital to the functioning of Wingbardy's economy. Simply reminding them of the importance of maintaining this essential relationship should make them think twice about pushing us too far."
TAL_phase_3:0 "Play Hardball"
TAL_phase_3_desc:0 "As the past few decades have demonstrated, grovelling is a poor diplomatic track to take, and something we must put behind us. The Wingbardians must know that our entire nation stands united in our desire to see this unjust clause repealed, and are willing to fight beak and claw to regain what is rightfully ours."
TAL_invest_in_coal:0 "Invest in Coal"
TAL_invest_in_coal_desc:0 "We have been blessed with a land rich in natural resources, and now that the profits from exploiting them are no longer flowing into foreign pockets, there is no reason not to get in on the action ourselves. Coal extraction is simply too lucrative to neglect. "
TAL_invest_in_other_industries:0 "Diversify the Economy"
TAL_invest_in_other_industries_desc:0 "We must not become overly dependent on coal, as its extraction generally has few direct effects on the rest of the economy. Investing more and more heavily in resource extraction would only cause us to neglect industrial development and education, a recipe for losing our economic strength. In light of this, investing in other sectors is absolutely crucial."
TAL_the_conclusion:0 "The Conclusion"
TAL_the_conclusion_desc:0 "The Wingbardians have finally relented: we have hashed out a repeal of the Coal Clause that is mutually satisfactory, and have no need for further negotiations. After so many years, this agreement is ready to be unveiled, surely to the delight of the Talousian people!"
TAL_fill_the_seats_of_parliment:0 "Fill the Seats of Parliament"
TAL_fill_the_seats_of_parliment_desc:0 "Now that the threat posed by the FLT and their violent revolutionaries has been dealt with, the nation's political climate has stabilised significantly. Without the looming possibility of the state being overthrown, our position is secure enough that we can finally get down to the business of governing without any distractions."
TAL_address_economic_issues:0 "Issue Number One"
TAL_address_economic_issues_desc:0 "The single most important thing we must address is, without a doubt, improving the state of the economy: these are the everyday concerns that confront ordinary griffons on a daily basis. After all, a prosperous economy means happy citizens, which means more Talousians enthusiastic to support the PL come next election."
TAL_minimal_government_intervention:0 "Minimal Government Intervention"
TAL_minimal_government_intervention_desc:0 "The damage done to our economy in the aftermath of the Falcor War was both devastating and far-reaching, as the scars have still not fully healed. Clearly some amount of state action is called for, although we must be careful not to go too far and set a dangerous precedent for the future."
TAL_construct_new_factories:0 "Construct New Factories"
TAL_construct_new_factories_desc:0 "As our current level of industrial development is somewhat behind the times, renewed investment in improving our industrial capabilities is a no-brainer in terms of beneficial actions available to us. Let us embark on this initiative without delay."
TAL_remove_useless_taxes:0 "Remove Useless Taxes"
TAL_remove_useless_taxes_desc:0 "Overall economic well-being is maximized by lowering the barriers to producing goods and services, and the current Talousian tax rate is far too punishing a burden on enterprises, raising their costs and stifling innovation. Lowering the tax burden is simply a prerequisite for getting the most out of our businesses."
TAL_remove_useless_tariffs:0 "Remove Useless Tariffs"
TAL_remove_useless_tariffs_desc:0 "Tariffs are a form of government intervention in the free market which inhibits free trade and open competition: yet another unneeded distortion to the free market. Their negative effect on economic growth and economic welfare is well-documented, and so their abolition shall be swift and decisive."
TAL_promote_invest_local_businesses:0 "Support Local Businesses"
TAL_promote_invest_local_businesses_desc:0 "Talousians have always been willing to take risks, recognising the value of initiative and creativity in the pursuit of profit. This entrepreneurial spirit came from the trading opportunities available from our position between Aquileia and Wingbardy. We should do all we can to foster this spirit in order to bolster innovation and achieve prosperity."
TAL_open_trade_with_neighbors:0 "Open Trade With Our Neighbours"
TAL_open_trade_with_neighbors_desc:0 "Talouse's era of protectionism is over and an era of free trade is upon us. Increased international trade will grant us access to markets which otherwise would not have been available to us, allowing our economy to grow more efficiently. In addition, a market containing greater competition means more competitive prices, meaning cheaper products for the average Talousian."
TAL_open_trade_with_aquilea:0 "Trade With Aquileia"
TAL_open_trade_with_aquilea_desc:0 "The collapse of the Griffonian Empire gravely isolated the Aquileian economy from the rest of the continent. What limited trade with Wingbardy still existed in the aftermath was conducted through the arduous land route through Tarrin and Francistria. We have the chance to step in and establish a new trade route through Talononte, becoming the primary gateway to the South."
TAL_open_trade_with_new_mareland:0 "Trade With New Mareland"
TAL_open_trade_with_new_mareland_desc:0 "Cultural and political differences have perpetually undermined attempts at Talousian-New Marelander cooperation. Even after centuries of coexistence, the relationship between our two nations has been plagued with mutual distrust and misunderstanding. Putting this mindset behind us is of the utmost importance, so that both our populaces might reap the benefits of trade."
TAL_open_trade_with_nova_griffonia:0 "Trade With Nova Griffonia"
TAL_open_trade_with_nova_griffonia_desc:0 "The economic potential of Nova Griffonia has long been overlooked by griffons who lack vision, but we can look ahead far enough to see a future where Nova Griffonian markets will rival any on our continent. We should get in as early as possible to stake our claim while the colony is still unattractive and largely undeveloped."
TAL_even_less_regulations:0 "Deregulation"
TAL_even_less_regulations_desc:0 "In response to the recent downturn some have proposed sweeping new regulations across the economic sphere. We reject this idea, as overregulation will simply lead to lower competitiveness, lower productivity, and inefficiency. Sometimes, the best thing the government can do is stay out of the way."
TAL_smaller_government:0 "Shrink the Beast"
TAL_smaller_government_desc:0 "We recognise that the ideal state is one whose powers are limited and minimal, whose main purpose is defending the lives and property of its citizens; allowing them to flourish instead of trying to control them. This state will provide the framework for a political system that respects fundamental individual rights, always preserving the liberty of Talouse."
TAL_proclaim_to_be_economic_powerhouse:0 "The Economic Powerhouse of the South"
TAL_proclaim_to_be_economic_powerhouse_desc:0 "Thanks to our bold reform programme, the full potential of the Talousian nation has at last been unleashed. No longer stymied by anti-growth restrictions, unprecedented quantities of wealth now flow through our ports, with every citizen reaping the benefits!"
TAL_breakoff_from_pact_PL:0 "Break From the Pact"
TAL_breakoff_from_pact_PL_desc:0 "Unfortunately, Wingbardy's pivot towards extremism means our values are no longer compatible with those of the Karthinian Pact: a sad day for an alliance which once represented a light of hope for the South. We stand opposed to totalitarianism in all forms, and it seems we will have to do so alone."
TAL_build_mil_PL:0 "Military Buildup"
TAL_build_mil_PL_desc:0 "Without the protection provided by our old alliance, we are forced to defend ourselves. Fending off Wingbardy will require an army larger and more ferocious than any Talouse has ever raised before, but we do not shrink from the challenge. Countless citizens have already risen to the occasion by enlisting, and several brilliant new generals are finally ready to take command."
TAL_address_the_nation_PL:0 "Address the Nation"
TAL_address_the_nation_PL_desc:0 "Recent events have forced Talouse into a somewhat precarious position, estranged from our longtime allies. This upheaval has sent destabilising ripples of fear and uncertainty throughout the populace. In times such as these, griffons turn to their leaders for guidance, and so we must reassure our citizens to bolster their confidence in the government."
TAL_on_our_own_PL:0 "On Our Own"
TAL_on_our_own_PL_desc:0 "Talouse proudly stands alone athwart tyranny—undaunted by the forces arrayed against us, never wavering in defence of liberty. This righteous purpose burns in the heart of every Talousian. Our people shall always resist the rising tide of radicalism, and preserve the light of freedom for all the South!"
TAL_strong_economic_ally_PL:0 "A Strong and Loyal Ally"
TAL_strong_economic_ally_PL_desc:0 "It is with great pride that we look towards our friends in Wingbardy—they have walked the same path we have while sharing the values which we have come to cherish. In light of this, we must reiterate our commitment to the Karthinian Pact and do all we can to reinforce this indispensable alliance."
TAL_build_more_industries_PL:0 "Masters of Industry"
TAL_build_more_industries_PL_desc:0 "By committing ourselves to further building up our industrial capacity, we can get Talouse to the point where it produces more, better, and faster than any other nation. We can achieve this, as hard work, discipline, and ingenuity are ingrained in the Talousian character."
TAL_invest_more_PL:0 "New Investments"
TAL_invest_more_PL_desc:0 "Many members of our government have good relations with business leaders in Wingbardy and beyond. Leveraging these connections in order to influence their decisions will be a simple matter. We can use this influence to push the flow of their investments in our preferred direction, while at the same time boxing out our rivals."
TAL_for_our_pact_PL:0 "For Our Pact"
TAL_for_our_pact_PL_desc:0 "The world is becoming a dangerous place, with forces rising who might soon threaten peace in our region. But Talouse is prepared to face these threats undaunted, for we stand shoulder to shoulder with Wingbardy in defence of democracy. As long as the Karthinian Pact remains strong, freedom in the South shall never be extinguished!"
TAL_minimal_trade_with_neighbors_PL:0 "Realpolitik"
TAL_minimal_trade_with_neighbors_PL_desc:0 "Although our values may not be in perfect alignment, simple pragmatism compels us to remain allied with Wingbardy. Their protection will no doubt prove invaluable in an increasingly dangerous world, and so we must make an effort to maintain cordial relations with the Karthinian Pact."
TAL_allow_some_trade_PL:0 "Encourage Trade"
TAL_allow_some_trade_PL_desc:0 "Merchants from far and wide already flock to Talousian ports, eager to make a profit in lucrative southern trade networks. Closer ties with our allies will grow this bustling exchange even further, providing new and exciting money making opportunities which will no doubt be a great boon to the Talousian economy."
TAL_support_our_own_economy_and_mil_PL:0 "Stand on Our Own"
TAL_support_our_own_economy_and_mil_PL_desc:0 "Being a member of the Karthinian Pact does not mean we should come to rely on our allies too heavily. We must continue to develop our army and military industry, so that Talouse will be prepared to defend itself should the need ever arise."
TAL_a_different_path_PL:0 "A Slightly Different Path"
TAL_a_different_path_PL_desc:0 "Along the shores of southern Griffonia, Talouse stands a beacon of progress: a nation whose citizens are freer and more prosperous than any others in the world. Together with our brothers in Wingbardy, we preserve peace in the region, so that our peoples can reap the benefits of trade and advance towards a brighter future."
TAL_remove_the_FLT_influence:0 "Curb Extremist Influence"
TAL_remove_the_FLT_influence_desc:0 "Despite our clear victory in the recent election, many more radical griffons have not given up the fight. As we speak, the FLT is ceaselessly plotting to overthrow their legitimate government. These terrorists pose a grave threat to the future of our democracy, and must be dealt with as quickly as possible."
TAL_promote_market_liberalism:0 "Promote Our Ideals"
TAL_promote_market_liberalism_desc:0 "It is not enough to merely suppress terrorist organisations, we ourselves must also provide an attractive ideology for the people to rally behind. Every citizen must know that the PL's goal is a society which combines a market economy with personal liberty: always defending a griffon's freedom, economic or otherwise."
TAL_campaign_against_FLT:0 "Campaign Against the FLT"
TAL_campaign_against_FLT_desc:0 "Combating FLT influence throughout the country will be no easy feat, as they have had decades to build support among both urban workers and rural miners as well as entrench themselves in many disparate regions. Identifying and apprehending their leaders is just the first step in what will be a long campaign to permanently break the group's power."
TAL_social_welfare_PL:0 "Social Welfare"
TAL_social_welfare_PL_desc:0 "The substantial pressure currently being applied by the workers's movement compels us to adopt a 'carrot and stick' approach to combating extremism. If we provide a basic level of well-being for all through subsidised social services, we can address worker grievances, making them happier and less prone to radicalisation. This will lessen the appeal of the FLT and degrade the group's cohesion."
TAL_a_harmonic_society:0 "A Harmonious Society"
TAL_a_harmonic_society_desc:0 "Our campaign against the FLT has been a resounding success, leaving the danger posed by such radical agitators completely neutralised. With everygriff dedicated to preserving democracy, the position of the government has finally stabilised. Now that this threat lies behind us, the entire Talousian nation stands united; ready to defend our sacred values of freedom and liberty!"
#LRN Main Tree
TAL_LRN_start:0 "LRN Victory"
TAL_LRN_start_desc:0 "The LRN has surpassed all expectations, achieving a slim victory in the elections. Now, Fetivola and his allies can begin to enact their radical reforms, and work to restore Talouse's long-lost glory. Gloria alla Talusia!"
TAL_dispose_coal_clause:0 "Dispose of the Coal Clause"
TAL_dispose_coal_clause_desc:0 "Now that the spineless Paltori has been forced out of power, it is time for the griffons of Talonsia to reassert sovereignty over their country. No longer will the rights to Talonsian resources be sold off to Wingbardian mining companies, who shamelessly exploit our beloved homeland for the benefit of their foreign masters."
TAL_sieze_assest_of_coal_comapnies:0 "Seize Coal Company Assets"
TAL_sieze_assest_of_coal_comapnies_desc:0 "As their operations are no longer legal, all foreign companies in the business of extraction, processing, and exporting of coal in Talonsia shall be compelled to forfeit all coal stockpiles, mining machinery, and facilities. This long-overdue expropriation will result in an influx of valuable capital from the pockets of foreign vultures to the Talonsian people."
TAL_break_from_WNG_pact:0 "Break From the Pact"
TAL_break_from_WNG_pact_desc:0 "Talonsia was once a strong and proud realm: an unconquerable bastion standing athwart all invaders. But today, few can even remember a time when our leaders were anything other than Wingbardian stooges. No longer! We are not afraid to take control of our own destiny."
TAL_jump_start_economy:0 "Jump Start the Economy"
TAL_jump_start_economy_desc:0 "Although the previous government left our economy in a truly pitiful state, we have been entrusted to improve it, and so we shall. Massive investments in all sectors will be needed to help our people get back on their paws and restore prosperity."
TAL_social_projects_for_LRN:0 "Social Projects"
TAL_social_projects_for_LRN_desc:0 "Years of research have illuminated a wide range of services with the potential to help needy griffons unable to care for themselves, promoting the well-being of individuals, families and the larger Talonsian society. Creating such services will be necessary to eliminate the incidence of social problems, resulting in a united and strong nation."
TAL_build_new_factories:0 "Industrial Buildup"
TAL_build_new_factories_desc:0 "A strong nation must strive to stand on its own economically. Relying on our external assistance or international trade rather than our own ingenuity would be pure folly. Talonsia must be capable of producing all the tools and weapons it needs to thrive, or else be slaves to the fickle whims of foreign interests."
TAL_form_new_military:0 "Calling All Patriots!"
TAL_form_new_military_desc:0 "Our ascendance has been cause for great excitement among Talonsians, especially the LRN's staunchest supporters, who have traditionally organised themselves into paramilitary groups. These passionate volunteers are exactly the type of griffons we will need in the new Talonsian army!"
TAL_additional_mil_factories:0 "Forges of a New Talonsia"
TAL_additional_mil_factories_desc:0 "Our task ahead demands that we reject the decadence of the old Talousian status quo and militarise the economy. Beyond guaranteeing the security of our nation, an increase in military spending will boost our prosperity and raise the employment rate, due to increased demand."
TAL_new_investments_for_LRN:0 "Coordinated Investments"
TAL_new_investments_for_LRN_desc:0 "Although we certainly appreciate the value of our mining and farming sectors, industrial capacity is the single most important measure of a nation's power. A significant level of industrialisation will be necessary for the task ahead. And so we must make extensive investments in the economy to boost our manufacturing capabilities."
TAL_build_new_defensive_lines:0 "Fortify the Border"
TAL_build_new_defensive_lines_desc:0 "The great Marco Talonostra's mountain forts were legendary for their majesty and impregnability, before regrettably falling into disrepair over the centuries. We shall rectify this mistake by restoring and adapting them for modern combat, so that they will once again serve as a formidable deterrent against our foes."
TAL_revival_of_old_lang_and_culture:0 "Revive Our Old Ways"
TAL_revival_of_old_lang_and_culture_desc:0 "Talonsia's decline coincided with a lack of interest in classical Talonsian culture, which over centuries became corrupted by sinister Wingbardian influence. Before we can rise and take our rightful place in the world, our people must remember the language and traditions that once made us strong."
TAL_promote_it_through_the_churches:0 "Support the Temples"
TAL_promote_it_through_the_churches_desc:0 "Temples are the heart and soul of the Talonsian nation, and their importance demands that we provide financial support for their operations. After all, temples are where great numbers of faithful Talonsians are likely to hear and absorb the wisdom of our message."
TAL_restore_cult:0 "Restore the Cult"
TAL_restore_cult_desc:0 "For far too long, the followers of Arantigos-Boreas have been forced to worship in secret, being targets of persecution whose actions were frowned upon by governments in the past. But no longer! Believer Fetivola has triumphed with its blessing, and so the Cult shall be officially embraced and elevated in Talonsian society."
TAL_enforce_ideals:0 "Enforced Morality"
TAL_enforce_ideals_desc:0 "As society-wide decay is made possible only by spiritual decay among the individuals who comprise the nation, ensuring our citizens behave morally is of the utmost importance.

TAL_encourage_the_faithful_to_join_military:0 "Recruit the Faithful"
TAL_encourage_the_faithful_to_join_military_desc:0 "Our embrace of the spiritual has met with an enthusiastic popular response all across the land, inspiring countless young griffons to flock to temples. These griffons should instead be encouraged to do their part defending the faith by joining the military, where they will surely be needed in the years ahead."
TAL_send_unfaithful_to_camps:0 "Punish the Faithless"
TAL_send_unfaithful_to_camps_desc:0 "Although countless griffons have accepted the wondrous truths being revealed in our temples, there exists a stubborn segment of the population who continue to remain aloof. These griffons represent a dangerous element, and their very existence is corrosive to national unity. Sending them to camps where they might be enlightened is the most merciful action we can take."
TAL_an_army_of_talouse:0 "Soldiers of Talonsia"
TAL_an_army_of_talouse_desc:0 "By all accounts, the Talonsian cultural revival has completely transformed the ranks of our army. Griffons who were once listless are now fanatical in their devotion, harbouring no doubts about the importance of their divinely ordained mission. With such determined troops, we shall not fail in our righteous struggle."
TAL_fill_the_rest_of_parliment_with_LRN_supporters:0 "Pack Parliament"
TAL_fill_the_rest_of_parliment_with_LRN_supporters_desc:0 "We must tweak the rules of Parliament and alter its composition to more accurately reflect the will of the national body. After all, maintaining an iron grip over this institution will be crucial to enacting all of our future plans."
TAL_abolish_monarchy_LRN:0 "One Dynasty Ends..."
TAL_abolish_monarchy_LRN_desc:0 "For centuries, helpless Talonsians have been forced to watch with dismay the decadence and incompetence of their royals. Instead of leading us to the greatness we deserved, they instead cozied up to Wingbardy and abandoned the interests of their true subjects. Thanks to the LRN, the country has moved beyond having any need for such disgraceful figureheads."
TAL_declare_regent:0 "...Another Begins"
TAL_declare_regent_desc:0 "It has long been said that when the time is right, one griffon will rise to seize the reins of destiny and lead Talonsia to untold triumph and glory. We know in our hearts that this will one day come to pass. Until then, Amilcare Fetivola shall serve as regent and watch over the country in this figure's absence, so that when they are revealed to us, we will be ready."
TAL_proceed_to_remove_other_parties:0 "Silence All Dissension"
TAL_proceed_to_remove_other_parties_desc:0 "The years ahead will no doubt be difficult, and only a populace fully united in purpose will be able to withstand them. Opposition parties are disruptive to the emotional and spiritual bonds that hold our nation together. In the name of national solidarity, public dissension can no longer be tolerated!"
TAL_start_purging_FLT_members:0 "Purge the Socialists"
TAL_start_purging_FLT_members_desc:0 "For as long as the LRN has existed, the FLT has been our fiercest enemy, and that is true now more than ever. Within the FLT itself, there are increasingly frequent whispers of forming a full-blown resistance movement against the government. Since they clearly can not be reasoned with, our only recourse is to hunt down and crush the organisation mercilessly."
TAL_oust_duchess:0 "Oust the Duchess"
TAL_oust_duchess_desc:0 "Duchess Ginevra presided over years of economic decline, social unrest, and soaring crime rates, all while conducting herself with barbaric impropriety. From any objective standpoint, her removal is much deserved and long overdue."
TAL_solidify_control:0 "Solidify Control"
TAL_solidify_control_desc:0 "Thanks to an abundance of savvy political manoeuvring, our hold over power has become ironclad, with no other group having the strength to challenge us. In fact, Parliament itself is no longer really needed for governance, as Fetivola has all the tools necessary to rule directly for the good of the Talonsian people."
TAL_warden_of_the_south:0 "The Warden of the South"
TAL_warden_of_the_south_desc:0 "Warden of the South—a title once bestowed upon Marco Talonostra by Arantigos himself, representing the tremendous responsibility which rested with his new realm. Over the centuries, Talonostra's descendents forgot their purpose and abandoned the title, but now that Talonsia has been fully restored, the time is right to resurrect it."
TAL_the_epiphany:0 "Enlightenment"
TAL_the_epiphany_desc:0 "The country is ready. Cured from all its economic, cultural, and political ills, it is ready to take its rightful place in the world. Now all we can do is wait for the one who will bring us to glory. If we dedicate all our energy to prayer and contemplation, perhaps their identity will be revealed to us?"
TAL_rally_the_nation:0 "Rally the People"
TAL_rally_the_nation_desc:0 "No doubt, times ahead will be tough; our citizens will be forced to withstand hardships and privation while our armies are fighting in the field. The population must be inspired in order to endure this great weight. They must know why we fight, and be fully cognizant of the glorious new future their sacrifices will bring about."
TAL_consult_with_the_military:0 "Consult with the Military"
TAL_consult_with_the_military_desc:0 "The coming campaign will require an army larger and more ferocious than any Talonsia has ever raised before, but we do not shrink from the challenge. A new generation of creative and talented officers have been rising through the ranks, and in military exercises these leaders have already shown strategic genius along with the ability to achieve swift and decisive victory."
TAL_get_ready_for_war:0 "Talonsia Awakens!"
TAL_get_ready_for_war_desc:0 "A great conflict is nearly upon us: one final chance for redemption after countless years of shame and humiliation. War plans have been drawn and the people are ready, but it will not be an easy fight. We will all have to make great sacrifices, but we do not fear, for that is the price of victory."
TAL_target_frn:0 "The Western Plains"
TAL_target_frn_desc:0 "Ever since the bastard Francis I Martlewing first carved out his little realm, the land of Francistria has been a domain home to arrogant warrior-rulers, notable only for their subservience to Wingbardy. Striking down this collection of pampered griffons should pose no challenge."
TAL_target_ara:0 "The Home of Arantigos"
TAL_target_ara_desc:0 "Arantiga is a place of great historical importance, the cradle from which sprang an empire mightier than any which graced the world before or since. Unfortunately, their decline is not one that they will be able to reverse on their own. The reality is that we are heirs to the Arantigan identity, and we are the ones who must bring it back to greatness."
TAL_target_wng:0 "The Southern Jewel"
TAL_target_wng_desc:0 "Long ago, when our nation was young, three devastating wars were fought between Talonsia and Karthin, ultimately ending in a stalemate. There was never a fourth, as our foes became overrun by Wingbardian invaders and were helpless as the ruthless barbarians sacked Karthin itself. After far too long, the time has come to settle the score and take the ancient capital for ourselves."
TAL_our_achievement:0 "An Empire Restored"
TAL_our_achievement_desc:0 "Glorious triumph! We have emerged from our great struggle having defeated all the corrupted nations which dishonoured the memory of the empire they sprang from. The South now stands united under the Talonsian banner, for we are the true guardians of Arantigos' legacy!"
TAL_assign_additional_generals_and_troops:0 "Expand the Ranks"
TAL_assign_additional_generals_and_troops_desc:0 "The past few years, Talonsians have had the good fortune to witness military triumph after triumph, but maintaining our momentum will be difficult without a fresh influx of griffons to replace our losses. Fortunately, there is no shortage of patriotic citizens eager to do their part, either as soldiers or as commanders."
TAL_total_war:0 "Total War"
TAL_total_war_desc:0 "Our new empire finds itself threatened by a powerful coalition of hostile nations, and fighting them off will require getting the most out of our territories. In the pursuit of ultimate victory, we must practice total war against our enemies by organising all available resources, including military personnel, non-combatant workers, intelligence, transport, money, and provisions."
TAL_talk_of_bigger_glory:0 "Reclaim the Rest"
TAL_talk_of_bigger_glory_desc:0 "Although what we have achieved thus far is quite impressive on its own terms, the ancient empire of Arantigos was far grander, and much of it still lies unredeemed. By our righteous claw, this travesty will be rectified in short order."
TAL_target_fal:0 "The Third Eagle"
TAL_target_fal_desc:0 "Falcor's history has always been closely entwined with Wingbardy's, as they share an almost identical culture and language. The two fought side by side conquering Karthin over a millennium ago, and so it is only fate that Falcor should follow Wingbardy in becoming part of our empire."
TAL_target_sic:0 "The Free Parishes"
TAL_target_sic_desc:0 "The Sicameonese have always been an odd bunch—jealously protective of their liberties and independence. Their decentralised federation fought off many aggressors over the years, but they have obviously never faced a foe like us before."
TAL_target_equestrian_colony:0 "The Lost Province"
TAL_target_equestrian_colony_desc:0 "The lands to our west are rightfully part of Talonsia, stolen from us hundreds of years ago through Equestrian treachery. This injustice will be tolerated no longer: the time has come to take our province back!"
TAL_reclaim_griffon_stone:0 "The Heart of Griffonia"
TAL_reclaim_griffon_stone_desc:0 "The birthplace of griffonkind has become corrupt and decayed, and its people are crying out for prosperity. We are called to restore it to its former glory; we must bring it into the fold of our glorious empire!"
TAL_core_the_nations:0 "Territorial Integration"
TAL_core_the_nations_desc:0 "The Talonsian Empire, like the Kingdom of Sparléos of old, is a multi-ethnic society home to many different nationalities and faiths. We recognise the necessity of accommodating these disparate groups, while at the same time promoting a larger Talonsian identity."
TAL_fix_and_make_griffenstone_great_again:0 "Economic Reconstruction"
TAL_fix_and_make_griffenstone_great_again_desc:0 "The scars of war can still be seen all across the land, as the enormous cost of the war effort took a high toll on our empire's economic infrastructure. Repairing this physical destruction will require a substantial commitment, but we will not shrink from the challenge."
TAL_look_to_the_future:0 "Forgotten No Longer"
TAL_look_to_the_future_desc:0 "In an astonishingly short time, Talonsia has gone from an obscure backwater to a vast and mighty empire, having finally taken its place among the Great Powers of the world. In light of our ascendancy, we can finally stop chasing the past and look forward to a bright and prosperous future."
TAL_befriend_aquileia_LRN:0 "The Talononte Accord"
TAL_befriend_aquileia_LRN_desc:0 "Now that we have restored our honour, rebuilt our empire, and stand strong among the great powers of the world, the time has come to begin seeking foreign allies. While we will never allow ourselves to be subjugated as we were under the Wingbardians, a defensive partner could prove valuable. [JER.GetName] may be amenable to warmer relations..."
#FLT Main Tree
TAL_FLT_start:0 "FLT Victory"
TAL_FLT_start_desc:0 "The FLT has managed to claim victory in the election after nearly 20 years of failed attempts. No longer shall the workers of Talouse have to suffer from the oppressive grip of the capitalists and robber-barons. With the FLT at the helm, Talouse shall become a bastion of the revolution and free itself from its bourgeois shackles."
TAL_dispose_coal_clause_FLT:0 "End Foreign Exploitation"
TAL_dispose_coal_clause_FLT_desc:0 "Now that the corporate puppet Paltori has been forced out of power, it is time for the griffons of Talouse to reassert sovereignty over their country. No longer will the rights to Talousian resources be sold off to foreign mining companies, who exploit both nature and workers in their endless quest for profit."
TAL_get_rid_of_other_parties:0 "Neutralise the Opposition"
TAL_get_rid_of_other_parties_desc:0 "Although we have secured a temporary victory, the fact remains that the other political parties represent a dangerous threat. If left alone, it would only be a matter of time before they enacted some manner of plot to subvert the will of the workers and plunge society back into the abyss. And so we must be swift and decisive in dealing with them: no hesitation, no remorse."
TAL_get_rid_of_mafia:0 "Crack Down on Crime"
TAL_get_rid_of_mafia_desc:0 "Despite the many slanders directed towards us, the fact is that the FLT is no friend of the Talousian Mafia. That lumpenproletariat crime syndicate is symptomatic of the capitalist corruption that has taken root in this country since industrialisation, and must be eliminated if we are to build a truly fair and just society."
TAL_abolish_monarchy_FLT:0 "Abolish the Monarchy"
TAL_abolish_monarchy_FLT_desc:0 "The Talousian monarchy is the most embarrassing remnant of feudalism that has yet to be purged from our society. It has long been evident that appointing a head of state using the hereditary principle is undemocratic, unfair, and elitist. The age of royalty is well and truly over, and the age of the workers has finally begun!"
TAL_remove_parliment:0 "Remove Parliament"
TAL_remove_parliment_desc:0 "Parliament served its purpose well enough in transitioning Talouse away from feudalism and towards modern industrial capitalism, but with our ascension it has become clear that the institution has outlived its usefulness. It must be replaced by a new body: one less prone to squabbling and inaction, and more responsive to the needs of the workers."
TAL_quell_any_uprisings:0 "Quell Any Uprisings"
TAL_quell_any_uprisings_desc:0 "While resistance to the FLT began immediately after election day, our flurry of aggressive reforms has become a catalyst for the formation of new anti-government groups within Talouse, all of which pose a serious threat to the nation's stability. We must be prepared to put down any armed insurrection that they attempt, and hunt down any griffon that provides aid to rebel groups."
TAL_party_disagreements:0 "Party Disagreements"
TAL_party_disagreements_desc:0 "It is a cruel irony that in the wake of the FLT's greatest triumph, this supposedly united front is beginning to come apart at the seams. Now that actual power has been achieved, differences in philosophy which were papered over during the struggle against Talouse's entrenched oppressors are finally coming to the fore. Such arguments are only becoming louder and more rancorous."
TAL_miners_split:0 "Spiritual Communalism"
TAL_miners_split_desc:0 "It has finally arrived: our chance to lead Talouse away from centuries of greed and moral degeneracy, and back towards the Gods! Now that the time is here, we must be swift in wresting control away from Talnara and his corrupt cronies, before they have a chance to solidify their grasp on power."
TAL_syndicalist_split:0 "Orthodox Syndicalism"
TAL_syndicalist_split_desc:0 "We must not pay any heed to those radicals who would have us place temples at the center of Talousian society. It was the actions of Talnara that lead to the workers gaining the upper claw in the class struggle, not the trite moralising of a few miners! We have our mission, and it will not be derailed by trite appeals to spiritualism."
TAL_curtail_the_syndis:0 "Curtail the Syndicalists"
TAL_curtail_the_syndis_desc:0 "Combating syndicalist influence throughout the country will be no easy feat, as they have had decades to build support among urban workers and entrench themselves in industrialised areas. Identifying and apprehending syndicalist leaders is just the first step in what will be a long campaign to permanently break the faction's power."
TAL_speak_out_about_syndis:0 "Against Materialism"
TAL_speak_out_about_syndis_desc:0 "It is plain for all to see that the syndicalist faction is filled to bursting with unsophisticated brutes and reckless militarists. And the syndicalist leadership has demonstrated that they are a cadre completely ignorant of all spiritual matters and of morality in general. How could Talouse ever allow such griffons to gamble with the fate of our nation?"
TAL_begin_the_sabatoge:0 "Plot Sabotage"
TAL_begin_the_sabatoge_desc:0 "Our rival faction must be dealt with, and we are well past the point where words alone are capable of doing the job. A campaign of sabotage will definitely allow us to gain the upper claw in this struggle. It may be a messy business, but desperate times call for desperate measures."
TAL_some_sneaky_operations:0 "Cloak and Dagger"
TAL_some_sneaky_operations_desc:0 "Our fight against the syndicalists is not one that will be won out in broad daylight, but instead will be decided in the shadows. Thanks to our contacts with certain unsavoury characters, underground operations making use of stealth and subterfuge are among the most potent weapons we can bring to bear."
TAL_some_dirt_flinging:0 "A Little Dirt Flinging"
TAL_some_dirt_flinging_desc:0 "We are the only force in the country which is still strong enough to thwart the miners: we are all that stands between Talouse and a new age of ignorance. Our cause is just and our goals are noble. In pursuit of these goals, would it be so wrong to stretch the truth once in a while? Certainly not!"
TAL_speak_out_against_miners_religion:0 "Against Superstition"
TAL_speak_out_against_miners_religion_desc:0 "We offer no comforting stories and instead present a harsh truth: religion is the most insidious of all the chains which have kept Talouse rooted in feudal barbarism. The temples, far from offering freedom, are in fact organs of reaction used for the exploitation and stupefaction of the working class. Modern progress demands that we look away from Gods, and seize our own salvation."
TAL_denounce_the_miners:0 "Denounce the Miners"
TAL_denounce_the_miners_desc:0 "It is plain for all to see that the ranks of the miners are filled to bursting with religious fanatics and pacifists who would irrevocably jeopardize Talouse's security. We must not entrust the defence of this nation to griffons who would be operating on a wing and a prayer! "
TAL_convince_the_population_about_syndis:0 "Spread the Word"
TAL_convince_the_population_about_syndis_desc:0 "Talnara has spent years propagandising among urban workers, and those workers will not abandon the syndicalist faction on a whim. Clearly, brute force alone will not be sufficient to break the syndicalists' power, and will have to be accompanied by a charm offensive of our own aimed at winning the confidence of all the Talousian people."
TAL_convince_the_population_about_miners:0 "Convince the People"
TAL_convince_the_population_about_miners_desc:0 "Although we have spent decades propagandising among urban workers and converting them to our cause, our message has not spread very far outside Talouse's industrialised regions. As a result, many rural griffons feel more sympathetic towards the miners. Clearly, we will have to launch a persuasion campaign aimed at winning the confidence of all the Talousian people."
TAL_oust_the_syndies:0 "Oust the Syndicalists"
TAL_oust_the_syndies_desc:0 "This ugly power struggle is finally over: the syndicalist faction has been well and truly broken, leaving us alone as the victors. Where there once were many, there is now only one path forward. Having narrowly averted disaster, Talouse's future rests in our capable claws."
TAL_oust_the_miners:0 "Oust the Miners"
TAL_oust_the_miners_desc:0 "This ugly power struggle is finally over: the miners' faction has been well and truly broken, leaving us alone as the victors. Where there once were many, there is now only one path forward. Having narrowly averted disaster, Talouse's future rests in our capable claws."
TAL_improve_society_miners:0 "A Truly Just Society"
TAL_improve_society_miners_desc:0 "Our foremost priority must be addressing the unnatural inequality that has come to pervade Talousian society, with some griffons hoarding obscene amounts of wealth while others wallow in misery. Guided by the lights of morality and spirituality, injustice and inequality shall be eliminated from our holy land."
TAL_promote_miner_ideals:0 "Promote Our Ideals"
TAL_promote_miner_ideals_desc:0 "Conservative, regressive and aristocratic values have permeated the culture of Talouse due to centuries of despotic rule. But as these old laws are torn down, griffons shall hear our message and become liberated, not just physically but spiritually as well."
TAL_invest_in_industrialization:0 "Invest in Industrialisation"
TAL_invest_in_industrialization_desc:0 "Although we certainly appreciate the value of our mining and farming sectors, the path of the modern nation is clear, and it is industrial. A significant level of industrialisation will be necessary for our continued survival. And so we must make extensive investments in the economy to boost our manufacturing capabilities."
TAL_convert_churches_to_promote:0 "Support the Temples"
TAL_convert_churches_to_promote_desc:0 "Temples have long been the soul of the Talousian nation, and recent upheavals have led to more and more griffons from all segments of society flocking to them in their search for meaning. Without a doubt, temples represent the single best vehicle available for us to impart the wisdom of our message to the masses."
TAL_establish_the_national_congress:0 "Establish the National Congress"
TAL_establish_the_national_congress_desc:0 "Our new society requires a new body to govern it; one that is not dominated by the interests of the rich or well-born, but instead represents the will of the common griffons. And so we invite representatives from every commune to come together in a National Congress, to serve as faithful servants of the Gods and the Talousian people."
TAL_reinvigorate_economy:0 "Economic Reinvigoration"
TAL_reinvigorate_economy_desc:0 "The economy of Talouse is in a truly pitiful state, and we have been empowered to improve it through a truly bold plan. Massive government investments into the nation's industrial base and research infrastructure are merely the first phase. A sturdy industrial base will prove essential as we move towards our socialist economic model."
TAL_build_up_industries_FLT:0 "Build Up Industries"
TAL_build_up_industries_FLT_desc:0 "A strong nation must strive to stand on its own economically. Relying on our external assistance or international trade rather than our own resources would be pure folly. Limiting trade and attaining self-sufficiency is critical to maintaining our national security."
TAL_build_up_defenses:0 "Fortify the Border"
TAL_build_up_defenses_desc:0 "As a small nation vulnerable to aggression from our larger neighbours, the best way to ensure our survival is by building formidable enough fortifications that it will force any potential enemy to think twice before attacking. Marco Talonostra's mountain forts were legendary for their impregnability, and our forts will be as well, once fully renovated and modernised."
TAL_industrialize_the_nation:0 "Industrialise the Nation"
TAL_industrialize_the_nation_desc:0 "Our Revolution heralds a period of great social and economic change that will transform Talouse from a backwards agrarian society into a modern industrial society. This process will involve an extensive re-organisation of the economy to promote investment in manufacturing sectors."
TAL_promote_the_revolution:0 "Promote the Revolution"
TAL_promote_the_revolution_desc:0 "Change is in the air! At long last, the Talousian people have triumphed over centuries of political, social, and economic oppression to establish a glorious new order. Truly, Talouse stands apart as an inspiration for working griffons everywhere!"
TAL_setup_the_national_assembly:0 "Found the National Assembly"
TAL_setup_the_national_assembly_desc:0 "The old Parliament was a breeding ground of political incompetence: an institution run by backroom deals and filled to bursting with politicians focused solely on enriching themselves. Our new National Assembly will be free from such despicable corruption, being composed of representatives selected from labour unions all across the land."
TAL_geared_for_war:0 "Geared for War"
TAL_geared_for_war_desc:0 "Modern conflicts are no longer fought between small numbers of professional warriors, but have grown in scope to encompass entire nations. In preparation for this total war, the whole Talousian nation must be made ready to endure it while manufacturing the weapons that will be needed to ensure our victory."
TAL_denounce_neighbors:0 "Denounce Our Neighbours"
TAL_denounce_neighbors_desc:0 "What we have accomplished thus far is not enough: we know that working-class creatures of all countries must unite across national boundaries in order to overthrow capitalism. The oppressed proletariat who suffer beyond our borders must know that we stand with them in international solidarity, and will work tirelessly to bring about their liberation."
TAL_bread_and_circuses:0 "Bread and Circuses"
TAL_bread_and_circuses_desc:0 "A happy populace is one that won't start causing trouble on the homefront. Distributing food and sponsoring public entertainment will strengthen unity among the people, as well as keeping them content."
TAL_call_on_commie_allies:0 "Call On Allies"
TAL_call_on_commie_allies_desc:0 "It is fortunate that we do not stand alone in our righteous struggle against exploitation and injustice. Other nations share our values and are sympathetic to our cause. It would be prudent to reach out to them diplomatically in order to foster closer cooperation, and hopefully agree to mutual defence."
TAL_the_isolated_nation:0 "On Our Own"
TAL_the_isolated_nation_desc:0 "We must isolate ourselves from the affairs of our neighbours by declining to enter into alliances, foreign economic commitments, or international agreements. Instead we shall devote the whole of our efforts to moral societal advancement, while remaining in a perpetual state of peace by avoiding foreign entanglements and responsibilities."
TAL_the_revolution_nation:0 "The Southern Vanguard"
TAL_the_revolution_nation_desc:0 "In just a short time, Talouse has been completely transformed. Overcoming the dark depths of ignorance and superstition, the nation has wholeheartedly embraced reason and enlightenment. No longer rural, but metropolitan. No longer conservative, but egalitarian. Talouse is no longer just a country: it is Revolution incarnate."
TAL_rally_the_people:0 "Rally the People"
TAL_rally_the_people_desc:0 "No doubt, times ahead will be tough; our citizens will be forced to withstand hardships and privation while our armies are fighting in the field. The population must be inspired in order to endure this great weight. They must know why we fight, and be fully cognizant of the glorious new future their sacrifices will bring about."
TAL_setup_and_gear_the_military_for_war:0 "Rapid Military Buildup"
TAL_setup_and_gear_the_military_for_war_desc:0 "The coming campaign will require an army larger and more ferocious than any Talouse has ever raised before, but we do not shrink from the challenge. Countless citizens have already risen to the occasion by enlisting, and new generals have demonstrated their ability to lead us to swift victory."
TAL_for_the_syndis:0 "For the Revolution!"
TAL_for_the_syndis_desc:0 "Thus far, only a fraction of the South has been liberated from the chains of economic exploitation and political oppression; the forces of reaction still hold domain over the rest. This cannot be allowed to stand any longer! Down with the old order, up with the workers!"
TAL_target_frnL_for_the_syndis:0 "The Middle County"
TAL_target_frnL_for_the_syndis_desc:0 "Ever since Francis I Martlewing subjugated the cities of Piumont, the subjects of Francistria have suffered terribly under a succession of belicose warrior-rulers. Fortunately, their moment of emancipation is finally at claw, and soon, they will be able to look to a brighter and more peaceful future."
TAL_target_araL_for_the_syndis:0 "The Conqueror's Folly"
TAL_target_araL_for_the_syndis_desc:0 "In ancient times, Arantigos' legendary conquests comprised a majority of the entire continent, but those days are long past. Working Arantigans must cease looking backwards towards long-dead emperors and instead seize their own future. If their leaders are too stubborn to realise this, then we will have to take action ourselves, for their sake."
TAL_target_wngL_for_the_syndis:0 "The Jewel of the South"
TAL_target_wngL_for_the_syndis_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Wingbardy once rose from the ashes of Karthinia, one of the successors of ancient Sparléos. And now from the ashes of the Kingdom shall rise a new revolutionary society, free from economic exploitation and political oppression: the ultimate triumph of the working class. A red jewel, shining for all the world to see!"
TAL_target_falL_for_the_syndis:0 "The Little Sibling"
TAL_target_falL_for_the_syndis_desc:0 "The Falcorian people still bear many scars from their war with Wingbardy, which was a tragic, unnecessary mistake: in truth, the workers of both nations are allies in the class struggle, blinded by manipulative politicians who stoke nationalist resentments for their own gain. Our leadership will ensure that a war between Falcor and Wingbardy never erupts again."
TAL_our_greatest_achievement:0 "Our Greatest Achievement"
TAL_our_greatest_achievement_desc:0 "It was inevitable that our righteous cause would shatter the fragile tyranny of the South's corrupt old rulers, and so it did. Now workers across the South stand together in solidarity, in the Socialist Republic of Southern Griffonia!"
TAL_befriend_aquileia_FLT:0 "A Worker's Friendship"
TAL_befriend_aquileia_FLT_desc:0 "With our own power firmly secured, now we can look outward to find friends. Some comrades believe that the North will return to conquer us once more. Surely [JER.GetName] would be open to a defensive pact, to ensure our mutual sovereignty against opponents!"
#Industry/Education/Society Tree
TAL_rebuild_the_economy:0 "Rebuild the Economy"
TAL_rebuild_the_economy_desc:0 "The end of the Falcor War left the Wingbardian economy in tatters, and the domino effect gravely impacted Talouse. Lowered demand for coal led to mass layoffs in the mining companies, which devastated mountain communities across the country. We must take steps to build back, and in a way that leaves us more resistant to such shocks in the future."
TAL_make_use_of_mountainsides:0 "Make Use of the Mountainsides"
TAL_make_use_of_mountainsides_desc:0 "Although it is already part of the griffon architectural tradition to incorporate elements of natural landscapes into our structures, Talouse's unique geography demands that we become even more aggressive when constructing on vertical terrain. Fully developing the mountains will allow us to make the most of our limited space."
TAL_electronics_research:0 "The Electronic Revolution"
TAL_electronics_research_desc:0 "The identification of the electron has led to the creation of the entirely new field of electronics and is poised to usher in a new age of scientific advancement. Research into this field is crucial, as it is already being applied by others to design cutting-edge communication and information processing technologies."
TAL_education_for_everyone:0 "Education for Everygriff"
TAL_education_for_everyone_desc:0 "We must be proactive and take measures to combat the unacceptable level of illiteracy which still exists in our nation. A focus on education is a prerequisite for taking our economy into the modern age."
TAL_farmland:0 "Support Our Farmers"
TAL_farmland_desc:0 "Talouse's agricultural sector has long been neglected, with far more attention having been paid to mining and, more recently, to industrialisation. Extending financial aid to farms will help low-income farmers and further the process of rural development."
TAL_country_roads:0 "Country Roads"
TAL_country_roads_desc:0 "Past infrastructure initiatives focused heavily on urban areas while not adequately addressing the unique needs of rural communities. These communities were the ones hit hardest by the economic crash of 1003, and farmers' and miners' ability to meet domestic demands depends greatly on a robust and reliable infrastructure."
TAL_green_gold:0 "Blue Gold"
TAL_green_gold_desc:0 "Excitingly, recent geological surveys have uncovered substantial crystal deposits in the Highlands. Ready access to these crystals will allow us to conduct previously unfeasible research into harnessing their unusual properties."
TAL_magic_boosts:0 "Promote Magical Research"
TAL_magic_boosts_desc:0 "Although it is common knowledge that there exists magical energy inherent in all living things, until now it has been regarded as a mere curiosity. New experiments into the nature of magic have conclusively demonstrated its untapped power. The possibility of manipulating this magical energy warrants further investigation."
TAL_mining:0 "Dig Deeper"
TAL_mining_desc:0 "Since the discovery of Talouse's coal motherlode in 968, mining has been a driving engine of the national economy. However, our crystal deposits are presenting a challenge, as they lie deeper and are proving much harder to extract than coal. Full exploitation will require the development of novel excavation and processing techniques."
TAL_nuclear_winter_this_year:0 "Project: Silent Spring"
TAL_nuclear_winter_this_year_desc:0 "Our new stockpile of crystals has accelerated research into magical reactions; the recent discovery of magical fission and its theoretical explanation has made possible the development of a weapon with previously unimaginable destructive power. An eccentric cadre of scientists have stepped forward, seeking to make this glorious weapon a reality."
TAL_connect_the_nation:0 "Connect the Nation"
TAL_connect_the_nation_desc:0 "The growing importance of international trade has made improving our infrastructure an absolute necessity. Further development of the country's road network will stimulate the economy as well as strengthen public unity."
TAL_griffing_industry:0 "Urban Development"
TAL_griffing_industry_desc:0 "During the 1003 crash, mining layoffs pushed huge numbers of griffons to move from the mountains to the cities in search of opportunity. These workers will play a crucial part in our revitalisation by building a new industrial backbone for the nation."
TAL_new_steel_mills:0 "New Steel Mills"
TAL_new_steel_mills_desc:0 "The development of new machine tools has opened the door for massive increases in the efficiency of the milling process. We must dedicate resources and effort to integrating these new machines into our industry."
TAL_black_gold:0 "Black Gold"
TAL_black_gold_desc:0 "It has been apparent for some time that oil is a resource of vital importance for the functioning of a modern economy. Unfortunately, our land lacks any significant oil reserves, and so our only option is to refine the process of coal liquefaction: converting coal into liquid fuels and petrochemicals."
TAL_the_first_oil_comp:0 "Our Own Oil Company"
TAL_the_first_oil_comp_desc:0 "Very soon, coal liquefaction will become an integral part of the nation's industry. In fact, the first Talousian oil company has already initiated industrial production of synthetic fuels. Once all their planned plants are operational, we will have no problem supplying enough petroleum to meet our needs."
TAL_arms_industry:0 "Military Industry"
TAL_arms_industry_desc:0 "The Talousian arms industry has been historically underdeveloped, probably due to complacency given the country's easily defensible geography. But a modern age of warfare threatens to make our storied mountain forts obsolete, and we can not afford to fall behind in the production of new weapons systems."
TAL_automobile_industry:0 "Talousian Automobiles"
TAL_automobile_industry_desc:0 "Although domestic demand for cars took a hit during the crisis, adversity did not stop new manufacturers from sprouting up. Now recent efforts of innovation and industrialisation have set the condition for our automotive industry to truly take off, and in short order it will surely prove to be the backbone of Talousian manufacturing in the new century."
TAL_science_base_improvement:0 "Scientific Methods"
TAL_science_base_improvement_desc:0 "If we are to place our nation at the forefront of the world's advanced economies, we have no choice but to dedicate ourselves to scientific-technological methods. Technology has proven its utility for improving standards of living across societies, and we must always strive to stay on the cutting edge."
TAL_land_grants:0 "Land Grants"
TAL_land_grants_desc:0 "The aftermath of Talouse's industrialisation left most of the country's land monopolised by a small clique of wealthy businessgriffs: a far from ideal state of affairs. The best way to salvage the situation is to put some of this land back in the claws of independent farmers, giving them a pathway to prosperity."
TAL_public_schools:0 "Public Schools"
TAL_public_schools_desc:0 "Education is the right of every citizen. By building a system of compulsory schooling, we can close gaps in opportunity between urban and rural areas so that no griffon may be denied the chance to learn and flourish."
TAL_repair_the_bank:0 "Repair the Bank"
TAL_repair_the_bank_desc:0 "The economic slump left our National Bank teetering in a precarious position, but we are now finally in a position to shore things up. No longer will anygriff have a reason to doubt the financial stability of the nation."
TAL_industrial_projects:0 "Large-Scale Investments"
TAL_industrial_projects_desc:0 "Heavy industries are key to our economic prosperity. Unfortunately, we have a deficit of heavy equipment, large machine tools, and specialized structures necessary to support them. Directing subsidies towards this sector will result in massive financial benefits down the line as well as increased employment, and must be done if we are to maintain military parity with our potential enemies."
TAL_new_economy:0 "A New Economy"
TAL_new_economy_desc:0 "Thanks to our tireless efforts, the nation's revitalisation is complete and the years of decline and despair now seem like nothing more than distant memories. No longer overdependent on mining, the economy is stronger and more diverse than ever, and is capable of easily withstanding any future shocks in coal demand. Truly, happy days are here again!"
#LRN Army Tree
TAL_army_for_LRN:0 "A New Talonsian Army"
TAL_army_for_LRN_desc:0 "Now that the griffons of this land have risen up to restore it to its former glory, our soldiers must be retrained for the task ahead. They must be taught to revere our history. They must remember the deeds of Marco Talonostra, as well as Talonsia's heroic victories against countless Karthinian incursions. As we never fell then, so shall we never fall now."
TAL_superior_firepower_lrn:0 "Supremacy of Fire"
TAL_superior_firepower_lrn_desc:0 "We recognise the fundamental truth that an army should aim not at occupying territory, but instead at the complete destruction of enemy forces. War is simply a matter of amassing and properly applying overwhelming firepower: destroying the enemy with fire rather than clever operational manoeuvre."
TAL_mobile_warfare_lrn:0 "Supremacy of Speed"
TAL_mobile_warfare_lrn_desc:0 "Defence is just another word for sitting and waiting for defeat! If we want victory we must be aggressive in seizing it. Modern technology has opened up new possibilities, and by making use of motorised war machines we can outmanoeuvre the enemy, putting ourselves in position to land a swift, devastating blow before they have any chance to prepare."
TAL_the_lrn_infantry:0 "Griffons on the Ground"
TAL_the_lrn_infantry_desc:0 "Infantry forces form the backbone of our army, having closest contact with the battlefield and bearing the largest brunt in warfare. As they are absolutely vital for engaging enemy positions, defending ground, and securing battlefield victories, we must ensure they are properly equipped."
TAL_mountaineer_research:0 "Mobilise the Mountaineers"
TAL_mountaineer_research_desc:0 "Throughout its history, Talonsia has relied on mountaineers as a vital line of defence. These elite troops have the ability to traverse rough terrain and place themselves in advantageous positions. No doubt their skills will prove vital to our survival in the future as well."
TAL_arty_guns:0 "Shells in the Sky"
TAL_arty_guns_desc:0 "Artillery plays a crucial role in supporting our infantry forces, devastating enemy positions and giving our troops cover to advance. Today's heavy artillery pieces are weapons of great versatility, providing a larger than ever share of our army's total firepower."
TAL_moterized_and_tanks:0 "Steel On Wheels"
TAL_moterized_and_tanks_desc:0 "Motorisation greatly increases the strategic mobility of our infantry units, which would otherwise be forced to rely on arduous marches or preexisting railroads. This advantage in mobility combined with armoured toughness will allow our forces to effectively outfight and outmanoeuvre any enemy."
TAL_new_tanks_models:0 "Heavier Tank Models"
TAL_new_tanks_models_desc:0 "Despite their speed, motorised infantry possess no direct tactical advantage in small-unit combat, as trucks and light tanks are still quite vulnerable to artillery and small arms fire. Heavier tanks will be needed; only they have the firepower and toughness to break through entrenched opposition, opening the way for faster troops."
TAL_support_mountainbois:0 "High-Altitude Support"
TAL_support_mountainbois_desc:0 "Artillery pieces are difficult to use in mountain warfare, as the Highlands are an area where standard wheeled transport is not possible. Fortunately, modern artillery can be manufactured from light-weight materials, which can be transported in pieces and assembled at will."
TAL_mountain_guns:0 "Mountain Guns"
TAL_mountain_guns_desc:0 "Mountains at any time of year are dangerous – lightning, strong winds, rock falls, avalanche, snow pack, ice, extreme cold, and the general uneven terrain are just a few of the hazards. Such conditions require weaponry specially suited for use in rough terrain."
TAL_mountainbois:0 "Talonsian Tenacity"
TAL_mountainbois_desc:0 "Talonsians possess a special tenacity and resolve, born out of necessity from fighting in hostile terrain: these traits will serve us well in our fight for survival. Generations of training and experience in Highland combat have sharpened our mountain combat skills to a deadly point, and we shall not allow them to atrophy."
TAL_steel_factories:0 "Feed the Forges"
TAL_steel_factories_desc:0 "We must be prepared for the long war ahead, but manufacturing the weapons of war is not possible without a sufficient supply of raw materials. The mountains of this land are rich in unexploited minerals lying just below the surface; up to this point, we have simply lacked the will to dedicate effort towards extracting them."
TAL_oil_factories:0 "The Oil Problem"
TAL_oil_factories_desc:0 "The core disadvantage of motorisation is that fuel is critical; if motorised divisions run out of fuel, they may be required to abandon their vehicles and lose all effectiveness. Unfortunately, as our land lacks any significant oil reserves, our only option is to refine the process of manufacturing synthetic oil in order to meet our demands."
TAL_superior_fire_idea:0 "Revive the Talonsian Spirit"
TAL_superior_fire_idea_desc:0 "Many other nations have been corrupted by modernity and become soft in the process, causing them to underestimate the power of the griffon spirit. But we know the truth: a well-motivated infantrygriff is superior to all the modern weaponry and technology of the industrialised powers!"
TAL_mobile_idea:0 "Legacy of Arantigos"
TAL_mobile_idea_desc:0 "One unfortunate side-effect of modernity has been the stunting of the Talonsian imagination. Having forgotten the legendary conquests of Arantigos and Talonostra, generations of military thinkers have concerned themselves mainly with defensive infantry tactics. But no longer! We remember our legacy, while making use of modern weaponry and technology in pursuit of our ancient glory."
TAL_beef_up_mil_production:0 "Ramp Up Production"
TAL_beef_up_mil_production_desc:0 "Modern conflicts are no longer fought between small numbers of professional warriors, but have grown in scope to encompass entire nations. In preparation for this total war, the whole Talonsian nation must be made ready to endure it while manufacturing the weapons that will be needed to ensure our victory."
TAL_additional_training:0 "More Intensive Training"
TAL_additional_training_desc:0 "A comprehensive review has exposed many inadequacies in our current recruit training programme. The process has failed to produce the quality of soldier we require, and will be replaced with a more traditional process of physical and psychological training and resocialisation."
TAL_recruitment_programs:0 "New Recruitment Programme"
TAL_recruitment_programs_desc:0 "In a nation which strives for greatness but which is surrounded by powerful neighbours, every citizen should be a soldier and every soldier should be a citizen. If Talonsia wishes to seize control of the future, its army must be aggressive in requisitioning griffons for service."
TAL_experimental_weapons:0 "Experimental Weapons"
TAL_experimental_weapons_desc:0 "The discovery of crystal reserves in the Highlands have brought to our attention the possibility of developing a crystal-based infantry weapon. While developments in this field are largely experimental, and have proved only marginally successful, it's theorised that such weaponry could one day be highly effective in combat."
TAL_radar_projects:0 "Radio Towers"
TAL_radar_projects_desc:0 "Our researchers have made strides towards developing a promising new detection technology which makes use of radio waves. This system would give our military the ability to detect enemy vehicles in the air, on the ground, or at sea from a great distance away. We must not delay getting this technology out in the field."
TAL_special_projects:0 "Cryptographic Projects"
TAL_special_projects_desc:0 "For centuries, ciphers have been used to encode and decode messages in order to provide a more secure way of military correspondence.

#PC Army Tree
TAL_PC_army:0 "The Talousian Army"
TAL_PC_army_desc:0 "Although many years have passed since it ended, our military remains haunted by the horrors of the Falcor War. In the conflict, outdated tactics and poor leadership led to countless Talousian soldiers falling in the fields of Asbolus and streets of Falcor. We must adapt our strategies to the conditions of modern combat, so that such missteps are never again repeated."
TAL_battleplan:0 "Trust in the Plan"
TAL_battleplan_desc:0 "In this age of modern industrialised warfare, the way to achieve victory with the lowest cost and greatest certainty is by engaging in extensive preparation coupled with strategic prudence. Excessive freewheeling and improvisation is sure to lead to disaster: although methodical battle may take time to get results, odds are those results will be good."
TAL_send_steel_not_men:0 "Trust in Steel"
TAL_send_steel_not_men_desc:0 "In this age of modern industrialised warfare, the way to achieve victory with the lowest cost and greatest certainty is by investing in better artillery. History has shown us that unsupported infantry charges lead to disasters with unacceptable casualty rates. Although material superiority will take time to build up, the resulting firepower is sure to leave any enemy dazed and confused."
TAL_the_new_troops:0 "Militia Integration"
TAL_the_new_troops_desc:0 "Over the past several decades, Talousian patriots across the land have self-organised themselves into groups dedicated to the defence of the nation. These militia companies could be of even greater use if they were to be whipped into shape and incorporated into the army proper."
TAL_this_is_our_land:0 "Defend Our Homeland"
TAL_this_is_our_land_desc:0 "The world of today is a dangerous place, as many sinister forces have risen to threaten its peace and stability. Against these enemies, our entire way of life is threatened, and defeat would mean the end of Talouse as we know it. Every citizen must know that in this fight for our very existence as a nation, surrender is not an option."
TAL_a_better_infantry:0 "Modern Infantry"
TAL_a_better_infantry_desc:0 "Although the current generation of small arms has served our armed forces well enough for the last few decades, their age is beginning to show as they become outclassed by newer designs. As such, it is time that we design a new standard issue rifle better suited to the challenges of modern combat."
TAL_stock_up:0 "Quickly Amass Arms"
TAL_stock_up_desc:0 "The fighting spirit of our troops will prove quite useless if they lack the material means necessary for the conduct of large-scale operations. And so we must do everything we can to acquire and maintain a good-sized stockpile of weapons and equipment."
TAL_support_squads:0 "Combat Support"
TAL_support_squads_desc:0 "Developments across the world have clearly shown an increase in combat effectiveness when adding supporting companies onto traditional infantry divisions.

TAL_the_knights_power:0 "The Duchess' Finest"
TAL_the_knights_power_desc:0 "Our knights belong to one of any number of storied institutions which trace their histories all the way back to the misty time of the Kingdom of Talonsia.

TAL_recruit_more_knights:0 "Expand the Orders"
TAL_recruit_more_knights_desc:0 "Although our knights are unmatched in skill and bravery, their small numbers are a great hindrance to their ability to turn the tide of wars.

TAL_special_forces:0 "Special Forces"
TAL_special_forces_desc:0 "Throughout its history, our nation has relied on specialised troops familiar with the shores or the mountains as a vital line of defence.

TAL_superior_firepower_for_harmony:0 "Fortress Talouse"
TAL_superior_firepower_for_harmony_desc:0 "As a small nation vulnerable to aggression from our larger neighbours, the best way to ensure our survival is by amassing enough firepower that it will force any potential enemy to think twice before attacking.

TAL_stockpile_additional_guns:0 "Stockpile Rifles"
TAL_stockpile_additional_guns_desc:0 "The Talousian military suffers from a lack of fully-stocked arsenals, gravely hindering its fighting capability.

TAL_artillery_divisions:0 "Artillery Divisions"
TAL_artillery_divisions_desc:0 "Without a doubt, artillery is the most important form of land-based weaponry in this age of industrialised warfare, as it is responsible for the vast majority of combat deaths. And so we must do all we can to acquire artillery pieces to be used by our army."

talouse.1.t:0 "Fetivola's Speech"
talouse.1.d:0 ""I confess that in these times, I weep for Talouse. I weep, for it pains me to see our great nation brought low by the incompetence of our so-called leaders." At the LRN rally in Chiazbeacle, Amilcare Fetivola addressed his enraptured audience. Despite the party being at the fringes of Talousian politics, a surprising number of devoted supporters had turned out to show their dedication to Fetivola and the LRN. "Those prominent griffons all bear responsibility for our sad state of affairs, as it was their moral degeneration that made it possible."\n\n"It was the treachery of Emmanuel Talnara, who asks workers to forgo their proud national identity in favour of an imaginary class identity." Fetivola raised a finger for each political rival he listed off. "It was the small-minded cowardice of Antonia di Colliverde, who is content to maintain our nation's exploitation and humiliation. Most of all, it was the avarice of our Prime Minister. Marco Paltori has proven himself willing to sell out the interests of Talouse in exchange for gifts of gold to him and his corporate friends!" The crowd booed fiercely at the mention of Paltori.\n\n"The fact is, our Parliament is infested with unpatriotic griffons and their despicable ilk. As this institution succumbs to corruption and incompetence, our nation is served poorly by its monarch. Duchess Ginevra is a weak ruler, clearly out of her depth and incapable of rising to meet the current challenge. Such is the sad state of Talouse." Fetivola shook his head. "I don't know about you, but I've had enough! Are you content to live your lives as Wingbardian lapdogs?" In response, a deafening shout of "No!" came from the crowd. "Then vote LRN, and together we will forge a new Talouse to regain our lost glory!" Fetivola raised his fist in the air to wild cheers from his supporters."
talouse.1.a:0 "This griffon tells it like it is!"

talouse.2.t:0 "The Forgotten Legacy"
talouse.2.d:0 "In the Peckreit lodge of the Falcor Veterans of Talouse, Amilcare Fetivola shook claws and exchanged pleasantries with a stream of griffons excited to meet him. The hall was filled with former soldiers who had come to attend an LRN event where volunteers were giving out copies of Fetivola's book, "Revolt Against the Modern World." After talking individually with a good portion of the crowd, Fetivola flew up on a platform to address them.\n\n"My friends, you all know better than anygriff what it means to be proud of your country, what it means to fight for it. If only more griffons today had your spirit!" Fetivola brought a fist to his chest. "Talouse has a truly glorious legacy. It has always been a bastion of civilisation in the face of barbarian aggression. Unfortunately, this legacy has been forgotten and neglected, as modernity has caused severe moral rot in our society. It saddens me to see that so many Talousians have lost their pride in our nation." Fetivola frowned as grumbles of disapproval came from the crowd.\n\n"This is disgraceful! Talouse can never forget the blood you shed nor the sacrifices you made." Fetivola pointed forcefully at his audience. "As we move forward into the new millennium, we must look to our past and at the same time as our future. It is time to restore our legacy, and take up the glorious mantle of Warden of the South once again!" He raised his fist in the air to raucous cheering from the veterans. "Stand up! Vote LRN, and defend our nation's honour!""
talouse.2.a:0 "We shall rise again!"

talouse.3.t:0 "Every Bit Counts"
talouse.3.d:0 "Amilcare Fetivola called to the devoted crowd that remained after the conclusion of an LRN rally. "Friends, in this most crucial endeavour we rely solely on your generous support to fund our operations," pled Fetivola. "So please, give whatever you can!" He gestured towards a large donation bin beside him where supporters swiftly lined up to make their contributions. Most tossed in coins, but others gave anything from pocket watches to glistening jewelry.\n\n"You!" Fetivola heard a weathered voice call to him. In no time, an old griffon in a fine suit was upon him and excitedly shaking his claw. "That was fantastic! In all my years, I don't think I've ever heard a politician speak with your ferocity and conviction. And it's so rare to see a griffon with such respect for our traditions, too. Boreas bless you!"\n\n"Oh, you are far too kind." Fetivola bowed his head modestly. "I am but a humble messenger."\n\n"Nonsense! You are exactly the leader this country needs, and I want to do whatever I can to help you out," said the old griffon. Fetivola subtly tilted his head towards the donation bin. After a short pause, the old griffon nodded in understanding and winked. He rummaged through his pockets before extending a shaky claw and tossing a single idol into the bin.\n\nFetivola's mouth slowly curved into a smile. "Ah... that will do.""
talouse.3.a:0 "It's for a good cause."

talouse.4.t:0 "Strategy"
talouse.4.d:0 "On a pitch black night, a guard patrolled the entrance to a nondescript warehouse, wiping his brow in the damp and heavy air. No moonlight filtered through the oppressive overcast sky, and so he anxiously swept his lantern in a wide arc ahead of him, on the lookout for intruders. Inside the building, a collection of the highest-ranking LRN party lieutenants sat at a table with their leader, a stone-faced Amilcare Fetivola. Smoke filled the shadowy air as several of the griffons lit cigarettes while others tapped their claws impatiently. After a long and tense silence, Fetivola leaned forward.\n\n"Gentlegriffs, I have called you here for a sensitive discussion," rumbled Fetivola. "As you know, our mission is absolutely vital. The future of Talouse hangs in the balance. In defence of it, all actions are justified." He frowned and narrowed his eyes. "To be honest with you, our party is in a precarious position. As Talnara continues to poach workers away from us, we will need every edge we can get." Fetivola tapped his claw on a pro-FLT poster on the table in front of him.\n\n"We will have to use unsavoury methods, and obtain help from unsavoury characters." As he spoke, Fetivola pulled out a knife and ran his claw along the edge. "Violence, intimidation, vote rigging; everything is permitted. The only concern is victory. Victory at any cost." As punctuation, he plunged the knife into the table, through the FLT poster. "Can I trust you all to do what is necessary?" Fetivola looked around to his lieutenants and saw no doubt in any of them, only steely-eyed determination."
talouse.4.a:0 "No hesitation. No remorse."

talouse.5.t:0 "The Upset of the Century"
talouse.5.d:0 "After much bickering and consternation, the campaign of 1007 has at last come to end. Talousians across the country cast their ballots in a tense election day, one marred by accusations of intimidation and reports of scattered violence at polling places, but after all the votes were counted the results were clear: In a stunning turn of events, the far-right LRN had emerged triumphant.\n\nRegarded as a fringe movement by most serious observers, no griffon could have anticipated such a strong showing for the party. Speaking to a throng of passionate supporters, LRN candidate and founder Amilcare Fetivola claimed the result represented "an end to our nation's decadent status quo" and hailed the beginning of a new age for Talouse. Having achieved victory, Fetivola finally has the power to enact his bold agenda, but what Talouse's future will look like remains to be seen."
talouse.5.a:0 "What were the odds?"

talouse.6.t:0 "The End of the Coal Clause"
talouse.6.d:0 "This morning, Amilcare Fetivola officially announced in a much-anticipated press conference Talouse's unilateral abrogation of the Transnational Mining Clause in Article II of the Karthinian Pact Charter. The nullification of the hated Coal Clause was cause for celebration across the country, and prompted an equal amount of claw-wringing in the boardrooms of Wingbardian mining corporations, whose Talousian operations are now in legal limbo.\n\nThe move has already increased tensions along the border with Wingbardy. In one high profile incident, a convoy of trucks transporting minerals and equipment into Wingbardy was stopped at a border post, leading to an uneasy stand-off. Fetivola's brief time in power has marked a rapid deterioration in Talouse's relations with the Karthinian Pact, and harsh words came in swiftly from other Pact nations after his announcement. Anonymous officials have called the move "unacceptable" and "incompatible with the Pact's mandate of cooperation." In response, Fetivola has stated that this move is only the first step on the path to building a stronger, independent Talouse."
talouse.6.a:0 "Our sovereignty is non-negotiable!"

talouse.7.t:0 "Our Own Path"
talouse.7.d:0 "Ever since the LRN's incredible victory in the recent elections, Fetivola has been hard at work crafting a strong, assertive foreign policy for our nation. Abrogating the Coal Clause was just the beginning; our citizens are sick of the Karthinian Pact and the exploitation that comes with it. No longer will Talouse remain content to wallow in Wingbardy's shadow! All the details have been ironed out, and the time has finally come to leave the evil Pact for good. This bold act marks the beginning of a glorious new era for our nation and the reassertion of our independence. At last, the time has come to seize our own future with our own claws. Gloria alla Talusia!"
talouse.7.a:0 "Free from foreign influence at last!"

talouse.901.t:0 "Talouse Leaves the Karthinian Pact"
talouse.901.d:0 "Following the victory of ultranationalist Amilcare Fetivola and the LRN in the Talousian elections, relations between our two nations have rapidly disintegrated. Infamous for his anti-Wingbardian rhetoric and a griffon obsessed with ancient hatreds, Fetivola has proven himself quite immune to any form of reason. His unilateral nullification of the Coal Clause was just the most egregious in a long series of provocative acts intended to undermine our alliance. And so it was no surprise when we received a letter informing us of Talouse's decision to formally withdraw from the Karthinian Pact. This is a sad day, as a nation which was once a close friend has become an implacable foe."
talouse.901.a:0 "How unfortunate."

talouse.8.t:0 "Revival"
talouse.8.d:0 "Encouraged by new government incentives, the entire nation is seeing a surge of interest in its ancient history and culture. The campaign—a lifelong passion of Fetivola's—has sparked a revival of Talouse's old language, and the tongue is now being taught in school houses and spoken in the halls of power with increasing frequency. Along with this revival comes a rejection of a multitude of modern ideas, particularly Wingbardain ones.\n\nTaking their cues from the LRN, many scholars no longer call the country "Talouse" due to the name's Wingbardian origins, preferring instead to call it "Talonsia." These scholars take it as a given that in order for Talonsia to become strong and prosperous, it must look to its ancient glories for guidance. The rising prominence of such views is yet another indication of Fetivola's growing sway over the country 's intelligentsia."
talouse.8.a:0 "Our old ways are far from forgotten."

talouse.9.t:0 "The Great Awakening"
talouse.9.d:0 "Across Talonsia, more and more griffons from all segments of society are flocking to temples in their search for meaning. These griffons—mostly commoners with little formal education— say that temple attendance has led them to engage in introspection and to commit themselves to a new standard of personal morality. The rising prominence of the temples is partly due to a massive influx of financial resources thanks to the government.\n\nSince their victory in the recent election, the LRN has made it a priority to devote hefty sums of state funds for temples. This spending, accompanied by a campaign of courting and charming religious leaders, is part of the party's effort to bolster the country's cultural and spiritual foundation. These efforts have already caused a sharp increase of interest in religion, along with a profound sense of conviction and redemption on the part of those affected."
talouse.9.a:0 "Temples are the soul of our nation!"

talouse.10.t:0 "The Cult Rises"
talouse.10.d:0 "Outside the mainstream of Griffon religion, there have been griffons who, after the death of Arantigos, believed that the legendary conqueror had merged with Boreas. As their practices became more solidified, this sect became known as the Cult of Arantigos-Boreas. Although denounced as heresy by the Archons in Griffenheim, the Cult has persisted for centuries in pockets all along southern Griffonia.\n\nNow with official support from the government, the Cult is rapidly gaining acceptance among the Talonsian population. In fact, Fetivola himself has revealed that he is a believer in Arantigos-Boreas. As it steps out from the shadows of society, the Cult is gaining large amounts of followers, and believers from other countries as well are flocking to Talonsia, where their practices will enjoy greater tolerance."
talouse.10.a:0 "Arantigos, hear our prayers!"

talouse.11.t:0 "The End of an Era"
talouse.11.d:0 "In his first address to Parliament following its restructuring, Fetivola unleashed a fiery broadside against the Talousian monarchy, denouncing it for leading the country to ruin and asserting that "when a monarchy fails in its duties, it loses every reason for being." He went on to say "the state we want to establish will be national in the highest sense of the word; that is, it will be Talonsian, thus returning to our origins. No longer should arrogant Dukes and Duchesses stand in the way of our glorious destiny!"\n\nFetivola's landmark speech was well received by Parliament, during which he formally put forth a proposal for the abolition of the Talousian monarchy. The proposal was taken up and swiftly passed by the LRN-dominated body, not a surprise given the fact that Duchess Ginevra has clearly lost the confidence of both the government and the general populace."
talouse.11.a:0 "Good riddance."

talouse.12.t:0 "Duchess Ginevra Ousted!"
talouse.12.d:0 "In the wake of Parliament's formal abolition of the monarchy, soldiers were dispatched to occupy the Royal Palace and evict Duchess Ginevra from the residence. With the cooperation of the Royal Guard, their mission proceeded without incident and all of the mansion's wealth and treasures have been confiscated by the state. Supporters of the LRN hailed the operation and celebrated the removal as representing a "new dawn" for the nation.\n\nThe revocation of the Duchess's titles and privileges marks the downfall of a centuries-old dynasty. An ignominious conclusion for such a storied bloodline, but in the end few griffons were willing to rise in her defence. Ginevra's future plans are not known for certain, although she is rumoured to be contemplating fleeing the country."
talouse.12.a:0 "Serves her right!"

talouse.13.t:0 "The Regency"
talouse.13.d:0 "This morning, Fetivola released a bizarre statement in which he proclaimed the beginning of a new regency for the nation. In rather cryptic language, the announcement makes allusions to a divinely ordained "chosen one" who is destined to lead Talonostra's sons to glory. Fetivola has declared himself regent for this mythical figure, who he says will come in the future. When this chosen one will be revealed, along with any details about their identity, he professes not to know."
talouse.13.a:0 "One day, we will seize our destiny."

talouse.14.t:0 "Return to Grandeur"
talouse.14.d:0 "In the streets of Talononte, a massive crowd had gathered in front of a towering temple devoted to Arantigos-Boreas. They were there to witness a speech from Fetivola, and although the sun had already set, the excitement of the crowd had not dissipated in the slightest. When Fetivola finally stepped up to the podium, he called for silence before clearing his throat. "Throughout my life, I have been told many times that Talonsia is dead, that it is a thing which exists only in fairy stories and history books," he began. "It is quite strange that so many still make this assertion. By any measure, it is false. The griffons of Talonsia? Their descendents stand proudly before you. Talonsian culture? It is all around you!" Fetivola stretched his arms out wide to polite applause. "Our nation is alive and well."\n\n"But truthfully, it is more than any one of these aspects alone," he continued. "There is a Talonsian spirit—a vital essence that binds us all together. Over the centuries, that spirit was corrupted by cowardice and decadence, but in a few short years we have repaired it. We have ceased squabbling amongst ourselves over petty matters, and rediscovered our faith." Fetivola looked up to the starry sky in wonder. "We now stand united, stronger than our enemies ever thought possible!" Shouts of agreement rang out from the audience.\n\n"Thanks to our heroic efforts, this great nation has been cleansed of the barbaric influences that made us weak. True, for a shameful period we lost our way, but we are now ready to reclaim our rightful mantle. We have a sacred duty to honour our legacy, and so we shall always stand firm as a bulwark against barbarism and degeneracy!" Fetivola clenched his claw into a fist. "I proudly proclaim that Talonsia is once again the Warden of the South!" He raised his fist high in the air, and in response a deafening wave of cheers erupted from the crowd."

It is to your grace that I owe all my accomplishments," he said softly. "I have done much... but what am I to do now? I await your chosen, but I know not who to look for." He squeezed his eyes shut even tighter, trembling slightly. "Who am I waiting for?" For a long moment, the air was still and full of silence.\n\nSuddenly, Fetivola felt a strange sensation as an unnatural warmth washed over him. It was as if he had become untethered from the material world and entered into the spiritual realm. He heard a voice, but not through his ears. It spoke directly to his mind, and said only one word. In an instant, Fetivola was back in his garden.\n\nHis eyes snapped open. He knew the answer. He had always known. "I understand!" He was to forge a new empire: Talonsian, but built in the image of ancient Sparléos. And he had been the one chosen to lead it to glory. "It is my destiny." His mind raced—there would need to be an announcement organised without any delay. He could not afford to waste any time readying the nation.\n\nThere was still much work to be done."

For years Talousians have been fervent in their desire to modify the hated Coal Clause and secure more favourable terms for their country, and after much wrangling the new conservative government eventually secured Wingbardian cooperation. Ahead of the negotiations, Prime Minister di Colliverde stated that she is confident that they will reach a settlement that will address her citizen's grievances and bring prosperity back to Talouse."

Although Article II remains in place, Talouse will now receive significant monetary compensation for resources extracted by foreign mining interests, due to its unique circumstances. Early polling indicates that a majority of Talousians are satisfied by the arrangement, and di Colliverde's approval rating has soared as a result. The Prime Minister has promised that this new money will go towards boosting the Talousian economy and improving the lives of the citizenry."

She went on to call the alliance "the Light of the South" and asserted that maintaining it was vital for keeping the region peaceful and stable. Her address was much praised both inside and outside Parliament, as most Talousians are in favour of closer cooperation within the Pact. Since the PC's election victory, the government has been on a diplomatic charm offensive, and Talouse's relations with the other Pact nations have been improving steadily. Thanks to efforts such as these, confidence in the alliance is higher than ever."

The Duchess was met by ecstatic crowds from Peckreit to Chiazbeacle, who hung on her every word in praise of the nation and its spirit. Yearning for an end to the violence and chaos of recent years, many Talousians have come to view the royal as above factional politics and petty disagreements, a visible symbol of national unity. Intellectuals from the PC have been the foremost voices promoting this new view of the Monarchy, and it is already catching on among influential segments of the population."

Some have misinterpreted the root cause of this as dissatisfaction with our political system, which is ludicrous." She flicked a dismissive claw.\n\n"The actual complaint of the worker is the insecurity of his existence; he is unsure if he will always have work, he is unsure if he will always be healthy and he can predict that he will reach old age and be unable to work." di Colliverde frowned. "If he falls into poverty, and be that only through prolonged illness, he will find himself totally helpless being on his own, and society currently does not accept enough responsibility towards him beyond the usual provisions for the poor, even if he has been working all the time ever so diligently and faithfully. The fact is, the ordinary provisions for the poor leave much to be desired." She shook her head slowly as murmurs spread through the chambre.\n\n"Today I declare that we must do more to provide for them!" di Colliverde raised an emphatic claw. "We must give our workers the security that they have been unjustly denied, and improve their deplorable conditions. By giving workers a stake in the existing order, Talouse will continue to stand strong, and her griffons will stand more loyal than ever!" In response, all of Parliament erupted with shouts of agreement."

Under her firm stewardship the economy has rebounded and citizens of all stripes have seen their standard of living greatly increase, particularly urban industrial workers. This material prosperity has brought with it stabilisation of the political sphere, and the domestic unrest and violence that once plagued the nation has been completely eradicated.\n\nMore and more, Talousians are looking outwards towards their neighbours. Much has changed since the long ago campaign of 1007, during which di Colliverde urged closer cooperation with Wingbardy and the Karthinian Pact. Developments in the world situation now call for a reevaluation of Talouse's geopolitical situation and foreign policy. This is a pivotal moment, with the country's future hanging in the balance, but a choice must be made."

These are times which will test us, demanding all our resolve in order to weather." di Colliverde's face was grim as she delivered her speech to the crowd that had assembled outside Parliament. "It was with great sadness that we witnessed the fate of our partners in Wingbardy. Plagued by chaos, the Wingbardian nation suffers under a reign of tyranny. A land once full of hope has fallen to the forces of radicalism." She narrowed her eyes and looked towards the horizon. "A terrible shadow now looms over the South." For a long moment, the air was completely silent.\n\n"But we do not despair!" di Colliverde thundered, standing tall and pointing emphatically. "In this solemn hour, we will not shrink from the challenge. We are ready to face it; to endure it; and to retaliate against it. We will always stand firm against the scourge of totalitarianism." Cheers swept through the audience, and a few voices began shouting anti-Wingbardian slogans. "We remember those glorious days when we secured our independence from the Empire, and that spirit remains with us. We will never falter, for we fight to defend the sacred cause of freedom!" di Colliverde raised a fist high in the air, prompting a second wave of cheering, far louder than the first.

As fear and uncertainty spread throughout Griffonia, radical ideologies are on the rise, and Talouse is no exception," she said, as murmurs of agreement spread throughout the audience.\n\n"Look no further than the FLT, which riles up workers and directs them to upend the social order. Talnara and his cronies want nothing more than to destroy our way of life and turn the world upside down," di Colliverde said forcefully, raising her claws in exasperation. "But they are far from alone. Do not be fooled by the LRN's appeals to tradition: they are no less revolutionary than the communists they claim to despise. Despite what that madgriff Fetivola might tell you, rejecting all modernity is not the answer." di Colliverde raised a stern talon. "Griffons like them will not bring prosperity, only chaos. If elected, they would threaten our diplomatic relations and set us on the road to ruin."\n\n"The fact is, Paltori is incapable of preventing this; the PL has proven itself feckless. Times such as these call for strong leadership, not leaders like our current Prime Minister, who will bend whichever way the wind is blowing." di Colliverde's rebuke of Paltori drew shouts of approval from her supporters. "I know that Talouse must always stand as a bastion against radicalism. For if we fall, the rest of the south will fall with us." di Colliverde brought a fist down hard on the podium. "But I will never allow this to happen!" In response, deafening cheers came from the crowd, filling the air."

talouse.26.d:0 "On a balmy afternoon in Peckreit, Antonia di Colliverde stood in front of the town's largest factory, ready to address the griffons who had turned out to attend a scheduled PC rally. The building's walls were grimy and faded. It was no secret that the town's prospects had worsened considerably since the factory was originally constructed three decades ago. "I will not lie to you; these are difficult times," di Colliverde began. "It is true that our glory days are a little ways behind us, but we can bring them back. I know this because I believe in the Talousian spirit." She glanced upwards towards the smokestacks that towered above the rest of Peckreit's modest skyline.\n\n"I believe that we can overcome the obstacles we face, unlike the FLT saboteurs who seek to undermine our economy even further," di Colliverde said sternly, causing boos and shouts deriding the FLT to rain down from the audience. "Revolutionary agitation is one of the many illnesses ailing Talouse, and it is one which we must confront head-on. Let me be unequivocal: overturning all of society is not the answer." di Colliverde waggled a lecturing talon. "No, sir. I'm a patriot! Where is their pride for their nation? I remember when we threw off the shackles of the Empire and asserted our independence, and that's something that deserves to be celebrated." In response, a wave of applause spread throughout the crowd.\n\n"Talouse now has allies which treat us as partners, not subjects," di Colliverde said with a growing smile. "I am hopeful that by working more closely with our allies in the Karthinian Pact, we can revitalise the economy. Talousinas yearn for security, quiet, and peace. I promise you that all this and more can be achieved through diplomacy and good faith negotiation. So vote PC, and together we can preserve our traditions and put Talouse back on the path to prosperity!" di Colliverde shouted, waving enthusiastically to the crowd.

Speaking to supporters in the capital, PC candidate Antonia di Colliverde claimed the result reflected "the average Talousian's desire for peace and stability" and pledged her commitment to closer cooperation with the nation's allies within the Karthinian Pact.

Convincing a majority of the clubs would be a difficult process, but he had to do it one speech at a time. "The task before us now is simply too important," he concluded, looking out at a sea of sceptical faces.\n\nWithin seconds, a burly griffon arose from the front row, clearly agitated. "Spare us the lectures!" he spat. "You syndicalists are very eloquent, but we've heard it all before. For years we've gone along with all your strikes and it hasn't gotten us anywhere!" He glanced around to rouse his fellow miners, prompting them to give shouts of sympathy. "Why should we keep following along when it's obvious you don't really care about us?"\n\nA wave of unrest rippled through the crowd, and Talnara waited for it to die down before responding. "We do not share the same aims," he said, stepping down from his podium. "But you know we share the same enemies." He approached the audience, eventually coming face to face with the brawny heckler. "They are wealthy, they are powerful, and they have been oppressing griffons like us for countless generations. Do you really believe you can topple them on your own?" Talnara raised his claws to punctuate the question.\n\n"Talouse is at a crossroads. If we expend our energy fighting each other at this moment, then all hope is already lost. The simple truth is we can only win by working together and combining the potency of our organisations." Talnara extended a claw towards his irritated opponent. A long pause followed, with the griffon's face twisting into a scowl.\n\nFinally, he opened his beak. "You're right." He took Talnara's claw and shook it begrudgingly. "We do need you.""

The nullification of the hated Coal Clause was cause for celebration across the country, and prompted an equal amount of claw-wringing in the boardrooms of Wingbardian mining corporations, whose Talousian operations are now in legal limbo.\n\nThe move has already increased tensions along the border with Wingbardy. In one high profile incident, a convoy of trucks transporting minerals and equipment into Wingbardy was stopped at a border post, leading to an uneasy stand-off. Talnara's brief time in power has marked a rapid deterioration in Talouse's relations with the Karthinian Pact, and harsh words came in swiftly from other Pact nations after his announcement. Anonymous officials have called the move "unacceptable" and "a stick to the eye of Talouse's allies." In response, Talnara has stated that this move is only the first step on the path to creating a new, working-class led nation, and boldly proclaimed Talouse's secession from the Pact, effective immediately."
talouse.48.a:0 "No more capitalist exploitation!"

talouse.49.t:0 "Operation Lupara Bianca"
talouse.49.d:0 "Under Talnara's direction, police forces initiated an unprecedented crackdown on the Talousian Mafia with the intent of eradicating it from the country. The notorious crime syndicate had a rapid rise to prominence in recent decades, becoming heavily involved in numerous illegal activities including protection racketeering, smuggling, and loan sharking, but now it all is coming to an end. The government's campaign has already produced impressive results as leading figures from all of the Talousian Families have been taken in custody, leaving the organisation scattered and disorganised.\n\nRevelations related to the operation sparked a minor scandal when it was discovered that many Talousian politicians ousted in the recent election had Mafia links, including some of the FLT's most vocal opponents. Crushing the notorious criminal enterprise has earned the FLT much praise, and so easily accomplishing what previous administrations struggled to accomplish has greatly legitimised their rule, along with strengthening Talnara's leadership."
talouse.49.a:0 "We will put an end to corruption wherever it tries to hide."

talouse.50.t:0 "Confiscate the Crown!"
talouse.50.d:0 "During the campaign of 1007, Talnara criticised the Talousian monarchy as anachronistic and outdated; something Talouse had long since outgrown but that was still holding society back. Most provocatively, he called for its complete abolition, saying that an undemocratic, hereditary monarchy was incompatible with a classless society. Now the FLT has emerged triumphant, it finally has the power to deal with the issue definitively.\n\nThe formal abolition of the monarchy took place this morning without much fanfare, carried out by FLT officials in a closed-door session. Afterwards, soldiers were dispatched to occupy the Royal Palace and evict Duchess Ginevra from the residence. Facing no resistance from the Royal Guard, their mission proceeded without incident and all of the mansion's wealth and treasures were confiscated. Supporters of the FLT hailed the operation and celebrated her removal as ushering in an "age of equality" for the nation.\n\nThe revocation of the Duchess's titles and privileges marks the downfall of a centuries-old dynasty. An ignominious conclusion for such a storied bloodline, but in the end few griffons were willing to rise in her defence. Ginevra's future plans are not known for certain, although she is rumoured to be contemplating fleeing the country."
talouse.50.a:0 "Good riddance."

talouse.51.t:0 "Overthrow"
talouse.51.d:0 "In their most aggressive move yet since seizing power, the FLT has taken the extraordinary step of completely abolishing the Talousian parliament. The building itself was closed down, with soldiers preventing any MPs who wished to enter from doing so. Speaking in support of the action, Emmanuel Talnara claimed in a speech that Talouse had "outgrown the bourgeois institution of parliament" and that the country's administrative structure would be overhauled to "facilitate the transition to a lasting communist society." However, what that new administrative structure will look like has yet to be firmly defined, and reports indicate that there is a passionate debate within the FLT itself over what it should look like."
talouse.51.a:0 "We'll figure it out eventually."

talouse.52.t:0 "The Schism"
talouse.52.d:0 "After emerging victorious from the recent elections, the FLT has been extremely active, taking aggressive actions to free Talouse from the chains of its history. The accomplishments are piling up, but even in this moment of triumph, disagreements within the party have grown more heated than ever. Tensions are so high that Talnara, no longer seeing a united path forward, has announced his retirement as leader of the FLT.\n\nThe removal of parliament and the monarchy, along with Talnara's surprise retirement, have set up a vicious struggle between factions within the FLT, with a great deal of contention over how to fill the power vacuum. The orthodox syndicalist faction, led by Giulia Rosbeccini, view trade unions as the natural building blocks of a post-capitalist society. The syndicalists stress the importance of being prepared for war, and hold dreams of spreading the Revolution to Talouse's neighbours.\n\nOpposed to them are Talouse's various independent mountain communities, composed of pious miners and other eclectics. The miners have unconventional views, including a far more isolationist foreign policy stance, and are fearful of political domination by urban industrial workers. The priests of these communities have long preached a doctrine of radical equality, and the miners have taken it to heart in their vision for a peaceful, utopian society.\n\nAt this point, things have finally come to a head. The positions of the two factions are irreconcilable, and only one can seize Talouse's future."

They seek to create a Talouse where urban workers would politically dominate the entire country. This mindset has caused them to lose sight of our Revolution's true purpose! On top of that, their reckless warmongering would surely lead Talouse to ruin. And so, the independent griffons of this land are compelled to take the reins of power and not let go. We must secure our position by persuading the populace, only then can we lead Talouse into a glorious new future."

On top of that, their suicidal pacifism would surely lead Talouse to ruin. And so, the working-class griffons of this land are compelled to take the reins of power and not let go. We must secure our position by crushing all who oppose us, only then can we lead Talouse into a glorious new future."

These dangerous radicals pose a grave threat to our peace and prosperity, and have already proven themselves to be quite intransigent. But the unjust will inevitably fall when confronted by our righteous cause! Our campaign shall be multifaceted, consisting of equal parts persuasion and coercion. A push to convince the population of the wisdom of our doctrine will be accompanied by a coordinated effort to find and apprehend prominent syndicalist agitators. This combination will serve to marginalise and isolate remaining pockets of resistance, destroying the cohesion of the syndicalist menace."

talouse.56.t:0 "Sending a Message"
talouse.56.d:0 "As we stand locked in a high-stakes ideological battle with Talouse's syndicalist faction, determined action will be required to win it. The value of propaganda can not be overstated; in this situation the pen truly is mightier than the sword. Fortunately, none of our brave followers have forgotten this truth, and they have already begun a coordinated effort to tar the reputation of syndicalism with a myriad of underground operations. These operations seek to target and subvert symbols of syndicalist power, demonstrating their helplessness to the Talousian people. This far-reaching campaign will help us greatly in our struggle against the incompetent extremeists who oppose us, and will serve to bolster our popularity even further."
talouse.56.a:0 "Excellent."

talouse.57.t:0 "The Intellectual War"
talouse.57.d:0 "A pamphlet titled "Against Superstition," recently published by an anonymous Talousian, has become an immediate sensation across the country. Within it the author uses clear and persuasive prose to marshal moral and political arguments encouraging common griffons to oppose the greed and corruption of the temples. A general scepticism towards religion is accompanied by particularly harsh vitriol directed towards the Archons, and it not so subtly implies that a victory for the miners would result in an Archonate-dominated Talouse. The pamphlet has proven to be a smash hit, and is being sold and distributed widely and read aloud at taverns and meeting places in every city. This fortuitous development will help us greatly in our struggle against the ignorant miners who oppose us, and will serve to bolster our popularity even further."

We will never allow such superstitious rabble to commandeer the ship of state! Our campaign shall be multifaceted, consisting of equal parts persuasion and coercion. A push to convince the population of the wisdom of our ideals will be accompanied by a coordinated effort to find and apprehend prominent religious agitators.

Such was the way of Talouse for countless miserable generations.\n\n"But no longer! The spiritual griffon judges according to the light of equality and reason that all griffonkind ought to have a quiet subsistence and freedom to live upon earth; and that there shall be no bond-griffon nor beggar in all this holy land.\n\n"None shall lay claim to any creature, and say, 'This is mine, and that is yours.

Their message has been heard all across the land, and the populace has embraced it enthusiastically.\n\nToday marks a momentous occasion, as the first session of the recently-created National Congress officially begins. Consisting of representatives from each of the Talousian communes, the Congress represents the culmination of the country's righteous revolution, with power no longer in the claws of monied nobles, but common griffons.

talouse.62.d:0 "On a chilly morning in Talononte, a massive crowd had gathered to hear Rosbeccini's much-anticipated address to the nation. As she looked out over row after row of packed streets, the city seemed barely recognisable from the one she had grown up in. In a few short decades, the storied and ancient city had undergone a seismic shift. From a storm of chaos and uncertainty its populace emerged transformed, more determined and conscious than ever before. The city was the cradle of Revolution, and its citizens had defended it every step of the way. It was a renewed city, an ideal capital for a renewed nation.\n\n"My fellow citizens," began Rosbeccini. "It is with immense pride that I stand before you today. Not so long ago, it was the brave griffons of this city who were instrumental in demolishing the oppressive institutions of Talouse, and paving the way for the ultimate triumph of labour!" she thundered, causing the crowd to unleash a forceful round of applause. "But you were not alone. Unions across the country stood together in solidarity, and they all played a part in securing our glorious Revolution."\n\n"But we did not stop at mere political reform," Rosbeccini boasted, raising a talon. "We also took steps to bring about economic prosperity. Thanks to a campaign of aggressive industrialisation, we launched Talouse into the modern age. We put an end to capitalist exploitation, all the while making every effort to uplift formerly oppressed griffons." She smiled proudly. "Yes, we have forged a more just Talouse than ever existed before." In response, rapturous cheers erupted from the audience.\n\n"But we must not grow complacent," her voice turned stern. "As the vanguard of the international Revolution, we must always stand prepared to defend our nation and our righteous values. We must serve as an example: a shining light for workers everywhere!" Rosbeccini clenched her claw into a determined fist. "It is our duty—for as long as we draw breath, that light will never be extinguished.""

Fetivola cast a steely gaze over Parliament as he spoke, with his trademark intensity that made it impossible not to become enthralled. "Of course, we know this to be false. For centuries, Talonsians have endured! Beset on all sides by hostile powers, we fought and we survived." He smiled, his words ringing out with pride. "And soon, we will rise to take our rightful place."\n\n"For on the horizon lies our ultimate conflict: the final struggle for our very survival. It is a momentous challenge, but once we overcome it there will be no force on this world to deny us our destiny. All we must do is stand united in the face of adversity, always staying vigilant for signs of treachery and defeatism." Fetivola raised a talon for emphasis as Parliament erupted with applause and shouts of agreement. "Yes, we must never underestimate the importance of spirit! A strong will can overcome any material obstacle, no matter how daunting," He explained, radiating a calming certainty. "I promise you that with our unshakable spirit, we will seize our future.""

talouse.64.d:0 "At an army base near the eastern border, the unsuspecting garrison was surprised to find their morning routine interrupted by a visit from their supreme commander himself. The troops marched out from their barracks, forming rows in front of the platform where Fetivola stood. Once they were all in proper position, Fetivola cleared his throat. "Greetings!" His voice boomed as he smiled widely. "It warms my heart to see such dutiful servants of Talonsia. Truly, your skills are indispensable, and all your dedication will be needed for the fight which lies ahead of us." His expression abruptly lost its joviality, turning deadly serious. "The hour is nearing for our final confrontation with the Wingbardian menace. They, along with their enslaved minions, seek nothing less than the destruction of our entire nation." A blanket of tense unease fell over the base.\n\n"This struggle will demand every citizen and soldier's total commitment. Trepidation, hesitation, and the like are signs of weak spirit and cowardice, which have no place in the heart of a Talonsian," Fetivola continued, casting a determined gaze over the troops. "Each of us must remember our old superiority as mountain fighters. In ancient times we brave warriors beat back the Wingbardians and stood up to them unshakably, in order to keep Talonsia safe from barbarism." He brought a clenched fist against his chest. "There must be no doubt: he who wavers has forfeited his life. Cowardice has no place in our ranks!" Fetivola's words thundered across the base, inspiring spontaneous cheers from his audience.

talouse.65.d:0 "The sun burned hot over the streets of Sparleto, sending ripples through the air as Fetivola toured his recent acquisition. He felt no discomfort, though, as the place had captured him utterly. Everywhere he looked, he could not help but marvel at the wonders of the storied and ancient city: grand buildings built millennia ago, exquisite tapestries, artifacts of the Kingdom of Sparléos. Such culture! Fortunately, Sparleto was now in Talonsian claws, and Talonsians would be far better caretakers of this culture than Arantigans.\n\nHe walked through the city at a steady pace until he saw something that stopped him in his tracks. In a plaza near the city centre, a large statue of immaculate marble towered over him. The figure was unmistakable, it was the legend himself: Arantigos. Sword in claw, from the era of his most glorious conquests. Fetivola was awed at the majesty, and could do little except lower himself out of reverence. It was a humbling moment; realising that despite all his achievements up to now, he was nowhere close to the legend that loomed before him.\n\nHumbling, but far from disheartening. Fetivola clenched his claws in determination. He wasn't finished yet. His empire has only just been revived, and he promised himself that he would not rest until it entered into a new age of glory to match the old. He would see it done.\n\nNo matter what."

talouse.66.t:0 "Destiny"
talouse.66.d:0 "Fetivola tapped a claw idly as he looked over the map of Griffonia that lay before him. The map was sprawling, so big that it barely fit on the grand table he and his high-ranking military staff had gathered around. He appreciated his generals, although they too often neglected the strategic aspects of warfare, becoming bogged down in operational tactics and minutiae.\n\n"You all have done well so far," Fetivola said, looking at each of the military griffons around him. "The boundaries of our empire have become quite formidable, but there are still opportunities near us waiting to be seized." His claw swept across the map from New Mareland, east to Falcor and Sicameon, and finally north to the ancestral home of griffonkind, Griffonstone. "Our armies will march to reclaim all these territories, and the Talonsian Empire's majesty will be known throughout the world!" The generals around him all nodded without a trace of hesitation. It went without saying that they would carry out Fetivola's will, or die trying."

talouse.67.t:0 "Talonsia Reborn"
talouse.67.d:0 "As he felt a cool breeze from the ocean sweep over him, Fetivola gave a contented sigh. It had been far too long since he stopped to truly appreciate Talononte. Thanks to his efforts, the city had been transformed from the one he knew as a child. Looking out over it from his mansion, it was hardly recognisable. From an unremarkable trading port to the centre of a glorious empire!\n\nIts citizens reaped the fruits of their empire, as wealth and treasures once unfathomable now flowed daily through Talononte. Artisans and scholars from across Griffonia flocked to the city to share in the riches of Talonsia. Fetivola smiled. It was the return of prosperity, the revival of an ancient culture. The return of pride.\n\nIt was the vindication of all he had fought for: a new empire to match the highest heights of the old! His life's work had been achieved. Fetivola removed his glasses as tears began to well in his eyes.\n\nFor the first time in life, he was filled with joy."

This new federal state represents the realisation of Rosbeccini and other syndicalists' ultimate dream: the triumph of labour and the creation of a new worker-based economic organization of society across the entire South. It was not an easy road to get there, requiring the defeat of once-mighty empires, but in the end all the oppressive regimes fell, leaving the region united under Talouse's righteous standard. No doubt this momentous event marks the beginning of a new era of peace, prosperity, and equality for our citizens."

As I speak, our enemies are gathering strength, intent on crushing the Revolution and undoing all the progress we have made." Looking out over her audience, Rosbeccini could see that the delegates all recognised the gravity of the situation. "Powerful forces of reaction have arrayed themselves against us, but we will not shrink from the challenge."\n\n"We must ready our arms and fortify our spirits for the task ahead. And we must not sit passively, but be aggressive in confronting those who seek to destroy us." Rosbeccini continued, prompting a number of delegates to let loose shouts of agreement. "We will never abandon our righteous mission to liberate all workers from oppression and exploitation!" She raised a fist for emphasis, her booming voice filling the assembly chambre. "I promise you that we will face our enemies, and we will win. Because we fight not just for our own nation, but for workers everywhere!"

Most importantly, this story is a true one, for it is your story." Fetivola pointed to the crowd gathered around him as his words took on a wistful air. "This is the story of the sons of Arantigos."\n\n"Long ago, the great conqueror Arantigos swept through this land, defeating the scattered tribes and uniting them under his nephew, Marco Talonostra. Talonostra brought order and initiated many great building projects, including the construction of this very city!" Fetivola raised his claws in wonder. "It was he who gave this land its name: Talonsia. Arantigos bestowed upon it the glorious title of Warden of the South. And so it was the duty and honour of Talonsia to be the stalwart defenders of civilisation."\n\n"The Talonsians there were the happiest and most prosperous griffons on the entire continent! But their ascendency was not to last. Instead of staying true to their traditions, over time they intermingled with barbarians and became corrupted by savagery." Fetivola frowned and shook his head. "They lost their way, and now their glorious empire is nothing but a distant memory. Yes, it is a sad ending." He looked into his audience and saw a sea of gloomy and dejected faces.\n\n"But is it truly an ending?" Fetivola raised an eyebrow. "Because I believe that one day those griffons will become strong again; that they will remember the wisdom of their old ways, and use it to regain their rightful position!" The crowd began to murmur in agreement. "But that is just my belief. In the end, it will be up to you all to make it a reality.""

But despite the ever-present splendour of the Eternal City, he found himself feeling troubled, for although the city itself was eternal, Karthinian civilization had fallen long ago. After countless cruel centuries, all that remained of their ancient glory was myths and legends: it was the same fate Talonsia had come precariously close to sharing.\n\nHad Antonesius Vitarro himself—grandson of Palino, great reshaper of the Karthinian Republic, first Imperator—once paraded down these very streets, Fetivola wondered. Had he breathed in this same air, content, assured of his own immortality, and of his people's perpetual ascendancy? Fetivola sighed. He would have to push such thoughts aside: there were still important decisions to be made.\n\nNow that he had completed his tour of the Empire's newly acquired territory, the time had come to consider the selection of a new capital. Naturally, Sparleto would bolster Talonsia's claim as being successors to the ancient Kingdom of Sparléos, as well as demonstrating the reverence they held for Arantigos. Alternatively, Karthin's central location and strategic importance made it an attractive option as well. But still, the thought could not escape Fetivola. Would it truly be wise to abandon Talononte?"

news_talouse.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]A shocking development has come out of Southern Griffonia today. Amilcare Fetivola, leader of Nova Talonsia, has declared the creation of a new Talonsian Empire that would act as a spiritual successor to the ancient Kingdom of Sparléos. For years, Fetivola has espoused rhetoric about "bringing southern Griffonia back into the fold of Talonsia", but it was mostly regarded as the ravings of a lunatic. Now however, it seems that Fetivola has turned his dreams into reality, and his empire is now the rising power in Southern Griffonia. Many of his neighbors have denounced him as a violent conqueror, and are shoring up their defenses against the self-proclaimed "Chosen of Arantigos-Boreas"."

At the end of her announcement, she expressed desires of spreading the revolution even further, and liberating all workers of the world from the oppression of the bourgeoisie.\n\nFor now, however, it seems that Rosbeccini's ambition has been sated, but her neighbors have grown apprehensive, and fear that they may be next."

TAL_coal_clause_desc:0 "§WResource rights of some states are given to:§! @WNG§Y[WNG.GetName].§!\n\nThe Transnational Mining Clause in Article II of the Charter of the Karthinian Pact allows for Pact members to have resource extraction operations in each other's territories, as well as the ability to openly transport it without strict border regulation and trade agreements. A section of this Clause refers to the ability of Wingbardian mining corporations to continue their pre-secession operations in other Pact countries. Colloquially referred to as the "Coal Clause" in Talouse, it has allowed for the Wingbardian corporations to operate without restraint in the Talousian Highlands. These companies often engage in unethical practices in the pursuit of profit and efficiency. The lack of benefits to both the workers and the nation, combined with the awful conditions, has led to the Clause being, near universally, viewed with disdain, and most of Talouse's parties agree that it must be abolished."

TAL_flt_influence_desc:0 "Shortly after the end of the Falcor War, the Fronte Laburista Talusiano was formed, led by Emmanuel Talnara, factory worker turned journalist. The party sought to protest the abhorrent conditions in Talousian industry and appealed to urban labourers and the coal miners in the Highlands. Today, the party consists of a coalition of the majority- syndicalist factory workers and the more unorthodox miner communes. The FLT is said to have its claws wrapped around the neck of the nation's industry, with almost every factory worker in Talouse seemingly in their pocket. Though its grasp is gentle now, if it is upset, it may choose to tighten its grip, "choking" the industry and, alongside it, the economy."

When the war ended, Wingbardy couldn't pay back its debts, and the Wingbardian companies laid off thousands of workers. This drained the Talousian economy, and it has continued to decline ever since. Though there was some recovery in the late 990s, it was not enough, and the Great Strike of 1003 reversed any gains made. Today, Talouse's economy continues to suffer, primarily from a combination of political deadlock, a reduction in regional trade, and the closure of several young corporations in the fallout of 1003."

north_war.1.t:0 "The Peace With Honour"
north_war.1.d:0 "The Chiropterrans and the Colthaginians have sent us an envoy, demanding the surrender of our mainland Zebrican holdings in exchange for peace and the release of our Prisoners of War. They say that it is pointless to continue fighting, as our armies are no match for theirs, but that they have no desire to invade our home islands.\n\nMilitary projections are currently grim: we have not made significant progress in the war in six months, and our population is beginning to become exhausted by the war. If we refuse, we would face a long and gruelling war, with a very real possibility of them slowly overtaking our navy and airforce and invading all of [HIP.GetName]."
north_war.1.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept defeat..."
north_war.1.b:0 "We will never surrender!"

north_war.2.t:0 "Victory"
north_war.2.d:0 "Excellent news! [HIP.GetName] has accepted our terms, and signed an armistice officially ending the North Zebrican War. No longer shall they be the dominant power in North Zebrica, and if our intelligence reports are to be believed a national crisis is already brewing inside the country which will prevent them from interfering with our plans for some time."
north_war.2.a:0 "Praise the Nightmare"
north_war.2.b:0 "At long last, we have defeated Hippogriff Imperialism!"

north_war.4.t:0 "The Hippogriffs Refuse"
north_war.4.d:0 "[HIP.GetLeader] has sent back a perfunctory telegram, indicating that they have no intention of surrendering and will "Go on till the end." They also included a host of insults towards our leader, both diplomatic and not so diplomatic. This marks a turning point in the war, as it seems rather than simply having to defeat their ground forces, we will have to find some way to crack the heavily-defended Hippogriff home islands.\n\nHowever, some good news has reached us. It seems that with their defeat in Zumidia and with news of our peace offer being leaked, popular discontent and defeatism are on the rise in Hippogriffia. This discontent will get worse and worse the longer they fail to take Ain Trotgurait, eventually leaving the country ripe for invasion."

north_war.13.d:0 "Our enemies have sent us an envoy, demanding the surrender of our mainland Zebrican holdings, several of our outer islands, and the establishment of a treaty port in the city of Winggarden in exchange for peace and the release of our Prisoners of War. They say that it is pointless to continue fighting, as our armies are no match for theirs, but that they have no desire to invade our home islands.\n\nOur generals are urging us to accept the offer, as we have made no progress on land in the last six months, and the Wingbardian navy rivals our own meaning that refusal could very well result in a full scale invasion of Aris. Our population is also growing weary and exhausted by the war, and news of our refusal could cause popular protest against continuing a war which many believe we cannot win."

north_war.50.t:0 "Hippogriffia Begs For Peace"
north_war.50.d:0 "We have received a message suing for peace from [HIP.GetName]'s ambassador bearing the personal seal of [HIP.GetLeader]. In it, they promise to abide by the terms of the treaty we proposed to them earlier, plus granting us the right to enforce a limited naval disarmament on them, and in addition they have offered us extraction rights to the oil on and around Terracia and Grand Aludia as war reparations.\n\nThe Hippogriffs must be truly desperate, if they are willing to offer us these concessions, which will permanently hamper their war machine and make it all but impossible for them to project power off their little islands, meaning we would easily defeat them in any future conflict. Most of our advisors suggest accepting the proposal immediately, as it would permanently secure our dominance over the Hippogriffs. A few of our generals however have suggested publishing the letter and dropping it over Hippogriffia. Such undeniable proof that their own leaders think the war unwinnable will finally break the Hippogriff will to fight, and make it possible for us to conquer Aris itself."
north_war.50.a:0 "We shall accept, of course!"

The region was left devastated in the aftermath of the Storm King's conquests, and these two powers have enjoyed a meteoric rise to power, finally turning to challenge the armies which once defeated the yeti warlord.\n\nWhile [CTH.GetLeader] has assured international observers that [CTH.GetName] seeks only to liberate their Zonician brothers and sisters from [HIP.GetAdjective] imperialism, it is anycreature's guess how this war will end, or what motivated the hermit state of [BAT.GetName] to strike."
north_war.101.d2:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Tensions within North Zebrica have boiled over, as [CTH.GetNameDef] has launched an invasion against the once isolationist state of [HIP.GetName]. The region was left devastated in the aftermath of the Storm King's conquests, and ever since [CTH.GetNameDef] has taken a hard stance against the [HIP.GetAdjective] occupation of Zumidia, which they call "[Hip.GetAdjective] Imperialism" and "An insult to our Zonician brothers and sisters," invoking an ancient civilization which once controlled what is now Zumidia and Colthage.\n\nWhile [CTH.GetLeader] has assured international observers that [CTH.GetName] seeks only to liberate Zumidia, it is anycreature's guess how this war will end."

The region was left devastated in the aftermath of the Storm King's conquests, and since defeating him the Hippogriffs have seemingly pivoted from isolationism to imperialism, with Crack Lightning proclaiming today the beginning of Hippogriff Hegemony over North Zebrica.\n\nWhat that "Hegemony" will look like, and whether [HIP.GetName] will prove capable of defeating the militarized hermit state of [BAT.GetName], is anycreature's guess."
north_war.101.d5:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Tensions within North Zebrica have boiled over, as the once isolationist state of [HIP.GetName] has been invaded by its neighbours after long territorial disputes over the [HIP.GetAdjective] mandate in Zumidia. The region was left devastated in the aftermath of the Storm King's conquests, and brushfire wars have been a constant ever since his defeat.\n\nWith [HIP.GetLeader] vowing to defend [HIP.GetName]'s continental holdings, and mobilising the armies which once defeated the Storm King, this war is shaping up to be no mere brushfire conflict. The North Zebrican War is likely to decide the fate of the region for decades to come."

north_war.1.t:0 "The Peace With Honour"
north_war.1.d:0 "[north_war_peace_demands] They say that it is pointless to continue fighting, as our armies are no match for theirs, but that they have no desire to invade our home islands.\n\nMilitary projections are currently grim: we have not made significant progress in the war in six months, and our population is beginning to become exhausted by the war. If we refuse, we would face a long and gruelling war, with a very real possibility of them slowly overtaking our navy and airforce and invading all of [HIP.GetName]."
north_war.1.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept defeat..."
north_war.1.b:0 "We will never surrender!"
north_war.1.peace_with_wingbardy_and_winggarten_demands:0 "Our enemies have sent us an envoy, demanding the surrender of our mainland Zebrican holdings, several of our outer islands, and the establishment of a treaty port in the city of Winggarden in exchange for peace and the release of our Prisoners of War."

north_war.1.peace_demands:0 "Our enemies have sent us an envoy, demanding the surrender of our mainland Zebrican holdings in exchange for peace and the release of our Prisoners of War."

north_war.2.t:0 "Victory"
north_war.2.d:0 "Excellent news! [HIP.GetName] has accepted our terms, and signed an armistice officially ending the North Zebrican War. No longer shall they be the dominant power in North Zebrica, and if our intelligence reports are to be believed a national crisis is already brewing inside the country which will prevent them from interfering with our plans for some time."
north_war.2.a:0 "Praise the Nightmare"
north_war.2.b:0 "At long last, we have defeated Hippogriff Imperialism!"

north_war.4.t:0 "The Hippogriffs Refuse"
north_war.4.d:0 "[HIP.GetLeader] has sent back a perfunctory telegram, indicating that they have no intention of surrendering and will "Go on till the end." They also included a host of insults towards our leader, both diplomatic and not so diplomatic. This marks a turning point in the war, as it seems rather than simply having to defeat their ground forces, we will have to find some way to crack the heavily-defended Hippogriff home islands.\n\nHowever, some good news has reached us. It seems that with their defeat in Zumidia and with news of our peace offer being leaked, popular discontent and defeatism are on the rise in Hippogriffia. This discontent will get worse and worse the longer they fail to take Ain Trotgourait, eventually leaving the country ripe for invasion."
north_war.4.a:0 "As was expected"
north_war.4.b:0 "So they have chosen death!"

north_war.5.t:0 "Hippogriffia Begs For Peace"
north_war.5.d:0 "We have received a message suing for peace from [HIP.GetName]'s ambassador bearing the personal seal of [HIP.GetLeader]. In it, they promise to abide by the terms of the treaty we proposed to them earlier, and have offered the isle of Terraceia with its oil and strait connecting it to the mainland as a further concession.\n\nThe Hippogriffs must be truly desperate, if they are willing to offer us these concessions. Most of our advisors suggest accepting the proposal immediately. A few of our generals however have suggested publishing the letter and dropping it over Hippogriffia. Such undeniable proof that their own leaders think the war unwinnable will finally break the Hippogriff will to fight, and make it possible for us to conquer Aris itself."
north_war.5.a:0 "We shall accept, of course!"
north_war.5.b:0 "No. I think not."

north_war.6.t:0 "The Legation City"
north_war.6.d:0 "By official memorandum signed on [GetDate] by delegates of [BAT.GetName], [WNG.GetName], [CTH.GetName] and [HIP.GetName], the International Mandate for the Concessions, Settlements and Legations in Winggarden has been established as part of the Twelve Concessions. The city will be governed under a shared administration of the first three signatories, called the Legation Council. Legally, the city will remain as part of [HIP.GetNameDef], although Hippogriff military forces shall be forbidden from entering it. A strip of land surrounding the city, averaging around 30 kilometers in width, will be completely demilitarized and made into a neutral zone to guarantee the safety of the mandate territory, while remaining under administration of Mount Aris. In case of breach of the peace treaty that ended the North Zebrican War, the first three signatories will intervene with military force if necessary to guarantee the continued existence of the mandate. Winggarden will be a tax-free zone and economic enterprises are to be freely established by the first three signatories. The fourth signatory will not be permitted to impose tariffs on imports and exports passing through Winggarden. Rather, this responsibility will be delegated to the mandate administration. Permanent diplomatic legations will be established by the first three signatories. With the signing of this memorandum, all signatories wish for lasting peace in North Zebrica."
north_war.6.a:0 "This will keep the Hippogriffs in line."
north_war.6.b:0 "Pack my bags, we're going to Winggarden!"

north_war.7.t:0 "The Hippogriffs Surrender!"
north_war.7.d:0 "News has reached us that the Hippogriff foe has signed a treaty giving over their possessions on the mainland to their enemies. Whatever designs we had on those territories, we will no longer be able to achieve them by fighting against the Hippogriffs. Their government appears to be entering a crisis as the remnants of their army withdraws to the island, and they have sent us a telegram suing for peace, saying that there is no longer any reason to continue fighting."
north_war.7.a:0 "We agree."
north_war.7.b:0 "This simply makes our job easier."

north_war.8.t:0 "The Formation of the Government of National Unity"
north_war.8.d:0 "Today, prominent businessgriff and investor Plumage Moonfeather has announced the creation of the "Government of National Unity" in Aris. He has promised a big tent coalition to unite the country after the nation's catastrophic loss in the North Zebrican War. He has focused his hatred especially on communists, but the Aris First movement has also been attacked by Moonfeather. While official reports are unclear on what exactly he plans to do with Aris, the victors in the North Zebrican War are just happy to see a stable, functional government standing atop Aris."
north_war.8.a:0 "Yeah right."
north_war.8.b:0 "Let's see what's going on over there..."

north_war.32.t:0 "Victory over [WNG.GetNameDef]"
north_war.32.d1:0 "When [WNG.GetLeader] joined the war against us many thought our days were numbered, but we have proven them all wrong. Our forces have decisively routed the [WNG.GetAdjective]s in every theater and crippled their capacity to wage war. Aris is secure, and the [WNG.GetAdjective] tyrant has been forced to surrender all his Zebrican territories to us!\n\nNow we must decide what to do with these territories. The island of Purrsia and the treaty port of Katren have historically been part of the Kingdom of Abyssinia. However, the island was sold to Wingbardy in 979 and the port was lost after the Storm King conquered Abyssinia. The Abyssinian government has repudiated these territorial losses and formally requested that we return what is rightfully theirs."
north_war.32.d2:0 "When [WNG.GetLeader] joined the war against us many thought our days were numbered, but we have proven them all wrong. Our forces have decisively routed the [WNG.GetAdjective]s in every theater and crippled their capacity to wage war. Aris is secure, and the [WNG.GetAdjective] tyrant has been forced to surrender his Abyssinian colony to us!\n\nNow we must decide what to do with Abyssinia. Since occupying a nation of millions of cats with a completely alien culture is out of the question, we have already invited the Abyssinian king to restore the government that ruled before the Wingbardian invasion.\n\nBut what should we do with the territories held by Wingbardy before the war? The island of Purrsia and the treaty port of Katren have historically been part of the Kingdom of Abyssinia. However, the island was sold to Wingbardy in 979 and the port was lost after the Storm King conquered Abyssinia. The Abyssinian government has repudiated these territorial losses and formally requested that we return what is rightfully theirs."
north_war.32.a:0 "Of course, we have no interest in Purrsia."
north_war.32.b:0 "We shall control Purrsia for the time being."
north_war.32.c:0 "We shall take Purrsia and the treaty port."

north_war.34.t:0 "The First Year of War"
north_war.34.d1:0 "Today marks one full year since the Wingbardians declared war on us. It has been a long and difficult year, with thousands of lives lost at sea over the opportunistic aggression of one griffon. Despite all the enemies arrayed against us, Aris has held firm, and [HIP.GetLeader] gave a speech commemorating the dead and promising that victory will come.\n\nNo message has reached us from [WNG.GetNameDef]. It seems Il Duce's pride is too invested in this war for him to contemplate peace now, despite the war not being the quick little adventure he promised his troops."
north_war.34.d2:0 "Today marks one full year since the declaration of war against [HIP.GetNameDef]. It has been a long and difficult year, with thousands of lives lost at sea over Hippogriff stubbornness in the face of certain defeat. While a year is quite a long time for what was supposed to be a quick land grab, the duration of the war thus far is not entirely beyond [WNG.GetLeader]'s expectations, and he has categorically denounced calls by some remaining liberals and peace-lovers to negotiate a ceasefire as insults to the [WNG.GetAdjective] military.\n\nIl Duce has given a speech to the navy congratulating them for their service, and promising that victory is just around the corner. Only time will tell if he is right."
north_war.34.a:0 "And so the second year begins."

north_war.35.t:0 "The Second Year of War"
north_war.35.d1:0 "Today marks two full years since [WNG.GetNameDef] declared war on us. Despite the odds, Aris has endured, and [HIP.GetLeader] gave a speech commemorating the dead and calling on all [HIP.GetAdjective] citizens to contribute whatever they can to the war effort.\n\nOur general staff reports that any hope of anti-war sentiment causing [WNG.GetNameDef] to finally accept a ceasefire have been dashed, as Blackwings have successfully silenced any "treasonous" voices against the war and even now, two years in, Beakolini promises victory just around the corner. We will have to knock Wingbardy's allies out of the North Zebrican War to have any hope of peace in the foreseeable future."
north_war.35.d2:0 "Today marks two full years since the declaration of war against [HIP.GetNameDef]. This year has seen even more lives lost to Hippogriff resistance, and [WNG.GetLeader] has privately confided in his advisors that he has gained a grudging admiration for their tenacity, and expressed disappointment with our allies' lack of resolve.\n\nFor a brief moment it looked like the public might turn against the war, given that they have been embroiled for two full years in what was supposed to be an easy victory, but the Blackwings did their job and silenced such unpatriotic voices.\n\nIl Duce has given another speech, this time to the Blackwings, promising that victory will come soon so long as we have the will to see it through."
north_war.35.a:0 "And so the third year begins."

north_war.36.t:0 "Another Year of War"
north_war.36.d1:0 "Today marks another anniversary of the war. In what has become almost ritualistic by this point, [HIP.GetLeader] gave a speech commemorating the "victorious dead" and urging the people to stay strong. The public is demoralised, and any optimism that once existed has been replaced with a grim, bloody-minded determination to simply outlast the enemy.\n\nPundits in the press have expressed their opinions speculating on what the next year of war will bring, and whether [WNG.GetNameDef] will ever abandon their foolish endeavour. Only time will tell."
north_war.36.d2:0 "Today marks another anniversary of the war. Unlike in earlier years, even Il Duce no longer promises swift victory. What began as an opportunistic strike at an enemy we thought easily bested has turned into an interminable slog, and rumours have it that Beakolini remarked that he never would have joined this war if he knew his allies would be so "unfathomably incompetent."\n\nBefore his speech commemorating the anniversary of the war, graffiti had to be washed from the Altar of the Fatherland depicting Il Duce as a stubborn donkey. Despite this, organised opposition to the war continues to be suppressed, and it remains far enough away that the average civilian has not been affected, so we will be able to press on until the end."
north_war.36.a:0 "I guess this is just our lives now..."

north_war.101.t:0 "The North Zebrican War"
north_war.101.d1:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Tensions within North Zebrica have boiled over, as [CTH.GetNameDef] and [BAT.GetName] have joined forces to attack the once isolationist state of [HIP.GetNameDef]. The region was left devastated in the aftermath of the Storm King's conquests, and these two states have enjoyed a meteoric rise to power, finally turning to challenge the armies which once defeated the yeti warlord.\n\nWhile [CTH.GetLeader] has assured international observers that [CTH.GetNameDef] seeks only to liberate their Zonician brothers and sisters from [HIP.GetAdjective] imperialism, it is anycreature's guess how this war will end, or what motivated the hermit state of [BAT.GetName] to strike."
north_war.101.d2:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Tensions within North Zebrica have boiled over, as [CTH.GetNameDef] has launched an invasion against the once-isolationist state of [HIP.GetNameDef]. The region was left devastated in the aftermath of the Storm King's conquests, and ever since [CTH.GetNameDef] has taken a hard stance against the [HIP.GetAdjective] occupation of Zumidia, which they call "[Hip.GetAdjective] Imperialism" and "An insult to our Zonician brothers and sisters," invoking an ancient civilization which once controlled what is now Zumidia and Colthage.\n\nWhile [CTH.GetLeader] has assured international observers that [CTH.GetNameDef] seeks only to liberate Zumidia, it is anycreature's guess how this war will end."
north_war.101.d3:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Tensions within North Zebrica have boiled over, as [BAT.GetName] has launched an invasion against the once isolationist state of [HIP.GetNameDef]. The region was left devastated in the aftermath of the Storm King's conquests, and Chiropterra has enjoyed a meteoric rise to power, finally turning to challenge the armies which once defeated the yeti warlord.\n\nNocreature truly knows the motives of the [BAT.GetAdjective] leadership, as the hermit state has only recently entered the international scene, and it is anycreature's guess how this war will end."
north_war.101.d4:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Tensions within North Zebrica have boiled over, as [HIP.GetNameDef] has launched an invasion against their neighbours on the continent. The region was left devastated in the aftermath of the Storm King's conquests, and since defeating him the Hippogriffs have seemingly pivoted from isolationism to imperialism, with [HIP.GetLeader] proclaiming today that [HIP.GetNameDef] would sweep aside the corrupt regimes of North Zebrica.\n\nWhere the [HIP.GetAdjective] conquests will stop, and whether [HIP.GetNameDef] will prove capable of defeating their heavily militarized neighbours, is anycreature's guess."
north_war.101.d5:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Tensions within North Zebrica have boiled over, as the once isolationist state of [HIP.GetNameDef] has been invaded by its neighbours after long territorial disputes over the [HIP.GetAdjective] mandate in Zumidia. The region was left devastated in the aftermath of the Storm King's conquests, and brushfire wars have been a constant ever since his defeat.\n\nWith [HIP.GetLeader] vowing to defend [HIP.GetNameDef]'s continental holdings, and mobilising the armies which once defeated the Storm King, this war is shaping up to be no mere brushfire conflict. The North Zebrican War is likely to decide the fate of the region for decades to come."
north_war.101.a:0 "We shall fight on till the end!"
north_war.101.b:0 "Good luck, [HIP.GetLeader]!"
north_war.101.c:0 "The Hippogriffs will not stand in our way."

north_war_alliance.1.t:0 "Against The Hippogriffs"
north_war_alliance.1.d:0 "As we prepare for war with the Hippogriffs, there is no secret that another nation likewise gears for war with them: [?NZW_alliance_receiver.GetName]. Like us, they have set their eyes on the valuable land Hippogriffia still holds on the continent. It seems therefore natural to consult with their leadership about possible cooperation – to form an axis against Aris. The [ROOT.GetAdjective] military leadership has also come out in favour of such a deal, since, despite the strength of our armed forces, the Hippogriffs have remained the leading military power in North Zebrica ever since the Storm King was defeated – and some claim that we may not be ready yet to challenge them alone.\n\nIn case that we can reach an agreement, this would also open the question of how to split the lands the Hippogriffs currently control. Our diplomats have developed a plan to split the area, with all lands south of the Zuthul River going to [NZ2.GetName] and all lands north going to [NZ1.GetName]. [north_war_alliance_1_zinder_text]"
north_war_alliance.1.a:0 "A great idea."

north_war_alliance.1.zinder_offer:0 "In addition, our diplomats have added the offer to cede the state of Zinder to make the proposed borders fairer."

north_war_alliance.2.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Proposes An Alliance"
north_war_alliance.2.d:0 "[FROM.GetAdjective] relations with the Hippogriffs have greatly soured in recent years, and it is no secret that armed conflict between the two of them is lurking on the horizon. In light of this, [From.GetLeader] asks for our cooperation in the creation of an Anti-Hippogriff alliance: a formal pact to act together if either of us enters into a state of war with Hippogriffia. This is our chance to ensure that we have a strong nation on our side in the case of our own war, although some ponies question exactly how reliable of an ally [FROM.GetName] would be.\n\nThe proposal also includes a proposed split of the land the Hippogriffs currently occupy. According to this plan, all lands south of the Zuthul River would to [NZ2.GetName] and all lands north to [NZ1.GetName]. [north_war_alliance_2_zinder_text]"

north_war_alliance.4.t:0 "Alliance Declined"
north_war_alliance.4.d:0 "Our envoys return bearing grim news: [FROM.GetName] has foolishly rejected our offer of an alliance, dealing a deathblow to the dream of an Anti-Aris Axis. Having failed to secure the cooperation of the bats, we are now forced to face down the Hippogriffian menace all by ourselves: a truly daunting prospect, but our only option remaining. It will require the total dedication of every citizen if we are to have any chance of victory in the conflict ahead, but we are left with no alternative."

north_war_alliance.5.t_CTH:0 "The Alliance or the Dream?" # Formerly colthage_others.211
north_war_alliance.5.d:0 "The war with Hippogriffia is finally over. It has been described as the defining war for the future of North Zebrica, as a pivotal moment in history, and as a fight for the destiny of our nation. Upon the Hippogriff's surrender, celebrations broke out all over the countryside, for our nation was to finally enjoy its well-earned peace.\n\nBut among some members of our political leadership, the jubilations have been more restrained. Before the war, we signed an alliance with [?NZW_alliance_receiver.GetName], and so far, we have shared the price. But was this alliance ever more than an act of political and military convenience? Have our nations really the potential to work together in the future? Their ambitions are not any smaller than our own, and so some in the administration urge [ROOT.GetLeader] to dissolve this unstable pact and prepare to fight for the true, unchallenged hegemony in North Zebrica." # El generico
north_war_alliance.5.d_CTH:0 "Looking out across the rolling hills of Aurez at his new Zumidian citizens, some part of Zalathel felt he had reached the end of the road of conflict he'd walked for so many years. But he wasn't at the end: merely another crossroads.\n\n"I know what you're thinking, Zal," said Zago, lounging in the grass beside him, "Wouldn't it be better if we could have all of Zonicia? Why do we have to share? Well, if you look at these zebras below us, I think you'll see the answer. They've seen so much war, and if you let them enjoy peace, they'll love you for it."\n\nZalathel was about to turn to Zasdrubal, expecting his militaristic brother to offer a counterpoint, when a bitter laugh cut through the silence. Looking behind them, the brothers saw Zaphod had caught up with them.\n\n"These zebras had plenty of peace before we came to 'liberate' them. And now we've won. We've 'liberated' millions of them in Zirta and Warzena to toil under our good friends, the Chiropterrans."\n\nThe brothers were momentarily dumbstruck. Zago got to his hooves and glared at her.\n\n"We just won the toughest war since the Storm King. Do you have to ruin it, Zaphod?"\n\nZasdrubal spoke in a low voice: "I think our sister is suggesting we betray our allies. Is that it, Zaphod?"\n\nZaphod nodded. "I was against this alliance from the start. We've fought with the Chiropterrans. We know what they're like. We know what they're going to do now that they don't have external threats. Now that they can really get to work."\n\nZalathel remained silent. To betray his one ally, to subject his citizens to yet another terrible war... unthinkable. But to abandon his fellow Zonicians to the Lunarist yoke... also unthinkable.\n\nZalathel's eye rested on some of the Zumidian farmers below, finally getting a good enough look to see what they were doing. They were removing an unexploded landmine from their fields." # Formerly colthage_others.211

After the Hippogriffs lay defeated, its future had become uncertain – as the common enemy was gone, tensions over future dominance in North Zebrica had flared up.\n\nBut now, cooler heads have prevailed. [NZ2.GetLeader] and [NZ1.GetLeader] both publicly stated their intention to prevent further war and build on the foundations of the Axis. The new treaty, quickly dubbed the "Agzhat Pact" after the town where it was negotiated, establishes a comprehensive framework of economic, diplomatic, and military cooperation. Media outlets from both nations have celebrated the news, and "Peace in North Zebrica" has become the credo of the hour."

They expressed their frustrations with the Treaty of Trotgourait – despite the fact that the borders had been previously agreed upon – and instead demanded further concessions. The tone and scope of the demands made it abundantly clear that there was little interest on their side in conducting serious negotiations.\n\nAnd so, the alliance was laid to rest, as the future of North Zebrica seems uncertain once more.

north_war.1.d:0 "The Chiropterrans and the Colthaginians have sent us an envoy, demanding the surrender of our mainland Zebrican holdings in exchange for peace and the release of our Prisoners of War. They say that it is pointless to continue fighting, as our armies are no match for theirs, but that they have no desire to invade our home islands.\n\nMilitary projections are currently grim: we have not made significant progress in the war in six months, and our population is beginning to become exhausted by the war. If we refuse, we would face a long and gruelling war, with a very real possibility of them slowly overtaking our navy and airforce and invading all of [HIP.GetName]."

They say that it is pointless to continue fighting, as our armies are no match for theirs, but that they have no desire to invade our home islands.\n\nOur generals are urging us to accept the offer, as we have made no progress on land in the last six months, and the Wingbardian navy rivals our own meaning that refusal could very well result in a full scale invasion of Aris.

The city will be governed under a shared administration of the first three signatories, called the Legation Council. Legally, the city will remain as part of [HIP.GetNameDef], although Hippogriff military forces shall be forbidden from entering it. A strip of land surrounding the city, averaging around 30 kilometers in width, will be completely demilitarized and made into a neutral zone to guarantee the safety of the mandate territory, while remaining under administration of Mount Aris. In case of breach of the peace treaty that ended the North Zebrican War, the first three signatories will intervene with military force if necessary to guarantee the continued existence of the mandate. Winggarden will be a tax-free zone and economic enterprises are to be freely established by the first three signatories. The fourth signatory will not be permitted to impose tariffs on imports and exports passing through Winggarden. Rather, this responsibility will be delegated to the mandate administration. Permanent diplomatic legations will be established by the first three signatories. With the signing of this memorandum, all signatories wish for lasting peace in North Zebrica."

north_war.32.d1:0 "When [WNG.GetLeader] joined the war against us many thought our days were numbered, but we have proven them all wrong. Our forces have decisively routed the [WNG.GetAdjective]s in every theater and crippled their capacity to wage war. Aris is secure, and the [WNG.GetAdjective] tyrant has been forced to surrender all his Zebrican territories to us!\n\nNow we must decide what to do with these territories. The island of Purrsia and the treaty port of Katren have historically been ruled by the Kingdom of Abyssinia, though they were ceded by treaty to Wingbardy. The Abyssinian government claims they were coerced into signing that treaty and have formally requested that we return what is rightfully theirs."

Aris is secure, and the [WNG.GetAdjective] tyrant has been forced to surrender his Abyssinian colony to us!\n\nNow we must decide what to do with Abyssinia. Since occupying a nation of millions of cats with a completely alien culture is out of the question, we have already invited the Abyssinian king to restore the government that ruled before the Wingbardian invasion.\n\nBut what should we do with the territories held by Wingbardy before the war? The island of Purrsia and the treaty port of Katren have historically been ruled by the Kingdom of Abyssinia, though they were ceded by treaty to Wingbardy. The Abyssinian government claims they were coerced into signing that treaty and have formally requested that we return what is rightfully theirs."
north_war.32.a:0 "Of course, we have no interest in Purrsia."
north_war.32.b:0 "We shall control Purrsia for the time being."
north_war.32.c:0 "We shall take Purrsia and the treaty port."

north_war.33.t:0 "The Hippogriffs Surrender!"
north_war.33.d:0 "News has reached us that the Hippogriff foe has signed a treaty giving over their possessions on the mainland to their enemies. Whatever designs we had on those territories, we will no longer be able to achieve them by fighting against the Hippogriffs. Their government appears to be entering a crisis as the remnants of their army withdraws to the island, and they have sent us a telegram is suing us for peace, saying that there is no longer any reason to continue fighting."
north_war.33.a:0 "We agree."
north_war.33.b:0 "This simply makes our job easier."

north_war.34.t:0 "The First Year of War"
north_war.34.d1:0 "Today marks one full year since the Wingbardians declared war on us. It has been a long and difficult year, with thousands of lives lost at sea over the opportunistic aggression of one griffon. Despite all the enemies arrayed against us, Aris has held firm, and [HIP.GetLeader] gave a speech commemorating the dead and promising that victory will come.\n\nNo message has reached us from [WNG.GetNameDef]. It seems Il Duce's pride is too invested in this war for him to contemplate peace now, despite the war not being the quick little adventure he promised his troops."
north_war.34.d2:0 "Today marks one full year since the declaration of war against [HIP.GetNameDef]. It has been a long and difficult year, with thousands of lives lost at sea over Hippogriff stubbornness in the face of certain defeat. While a year is quite a long time for what was supposed to be a quick land grab, the duration of the war thus far is not entirely beyond [WNG.GetLeader]'s expectations, and he has categorically denounced calls by some remaining liberals and peace-lovers to negotiate a ceasefire as insults to the [WNG.GetAdjective] military.\n\nIl Duce has given a speech to the navy congratulating them for their service, and promising that victory is just around the corner. Only time will tell if he is right."
north_war.34.a:0 "And so the second year begins."

north_war.35.t:0 "The Second Year of War"
north_war.35.d1:0 "Today marks two full years since [WNG.GetNameDef] declared war on us. Despite the odds, Aris has endured, and [HIP.GetLeader] gave a speech commemorating the dead and calling on all [HIP.GetAdjective] citizens to contribute whatever they can to the war effort.\n\nOur general staff reports that any hope of anti-war sentiment causing [WNG.GetNameDef] to finally accept a ceasefire have been dashed, as Blackwings have successfully silenced any "treasonous" voices against the war and even now, two years in, Beakolini promises victory just around the corner. We will have to knock Wingbardy's allies out of the North Zebrican War to have any hope of peace in the foreseeable future."
north_war.35.d2:0 "Today marks two full years since the declaration of war against [HIP.GetNameDef]. This year has seen even more lives lost to Hippogriff resistance, and [WNG.GetLeader] has privately confided in his advisors that he has gained a grudging admiration for their tenacity, and expressed disappointment with our allies' lack of resolve.\n\nFor a brief moment it looked like the public might turn against the war, given that they have been embroiled for two full years in what was supposed to be an easy victory, but the Blackwings did their job and silenced such unpatriotic voices.\n\nIl Duce has given another speech, this time to the Blackwings, promising that victory will come soon so long as we have the will to see it through."
north_war.35.a:0 "And so the third year begins."

north_war.36.t:0 "Another Year of War"
north_war.36.d1:0 "Today marks another anniversary of the war. In what has become almost ritualistic by this point, [HIP.GetLeader] gave a speech commemorating the "victorious dead" and urging the people to stay strong. The public is demoralised, and any optimism that once existed has been replaced with a grim, bloody-minded determination to simply outlast the enemy.\n\nPundits in the press have expressed their opinions speculating on what the next year of war will bring, and whether [WNG.GetNameDef] will ever abandon their foolish endeavour. Only time will tell."
north_war.36.d2:0 "Today marks another anniversary of the war. Unlike in earlier years, even Il Duce no longer promises swift victory. What began as an opportunistic strike at an enemy we thought easily bested has turned into an interminable slog, and rumours have it that Beakolini remarked that he never would have joined this war if he knew his allies would be so "unfathomably incompetent."\n\nBefore his speech commemorating the anniversary of the war, graffiti had to be washed from the Altar of the Fatherland depicting Il Duce as a stubborn donkey. Despite this, organised opposition to the war continues to be suppressed, and it remains far enough away that the average civilian has not been affected, so we will be able to press on until the end."
north_war.36.a:0 "I guess this is just our lives now..."

north_war.50.t:0 "Hippogriffia Begs For Peace"
north_war.50.d:0 "We have received a message suing for peace from [HIP.GetName]'s ambassador bearing the personal seal of [HIP.GetLeader]. In it, they promise to abide by the terms of the treaty we proposed to them earlier, plus granting us the right to enforce a limited naval disarmament on them, and in addition they have offered us extraction rights to the oil on and around Terracia and Grand Aludia as war reparations.\n\nThe Hippogriffs must be truly desperate, if they are willing to offer us these concessions, which will permanently hamper their war machine and make it all but impossible for them to project power off their little islands, meaning we would easily defeat them in any future conflict. Most of our advisors suggest accepting the proposal immediately, as it would permanently secure our dominance over the Hippogriffs. A few of our generals however have suggested publishing the letter and dropping it over Hippogriffia. Such undeniable proof that their own leaders think the war unwinnable will finally break the Hippogriff will to fight, and make it possible for us to conquer Aris itself."
north_war.50.a:0 "We shall accept, of course!"
north_war.50.b:0 "No. I think not."

north_war.101.t:0 "The North Zebrican War"
north_war.101.d1:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Tensions within North Zebrica have boiled over, as [CTH.GetNameDef] and [BAT.GetName] have joined forces to attack the once isolationist state of [HIP.GetNameDef]. The region was left devastated in the aftermath of the Storm King's conquests, and these two powers have enjoyed a meteoric rise to power, finally turning to challenge the armies which once defeated the yeti warlord.\n\nWhile [CTH.GetLeader] has assured international observers that [CTH.GetNameDef] seeks only to liberate their Zonician brothers and sisters from [HIP.GetAdjective] imperialism, it is anycreature's guess how this war will end, or what motivated the hermit state of [BAT.GetName] to strike."

He has focused his hatred especially on communists, but the Aris First movement has also been attacked by Moonfeather.

DEL_AF_event_prep.2.d: ""Yesterday's logs said something about Talarayi? Why?"\n\n"Well-" the bosun began, but was cut off by the helmsgriff.\n\n"It was a bright, green light, like a pillar of magic, that shot out from the jungle." She said, eyes wide. "It lasted about six seconds before it dissipated, but the clouds still rippled away for a few minutes. From the north, this was."\n\nThe Feathisian executive stared at the two of them, beak scrunched up in suspicion, before turning to the bosun. "And you also saw this?" \n\nThe bosun, a Senkinese kirin they'd picked up from Lotus, was much more hesitant. "I did see an odd flash of light coming from the continent... but I was indoors. In fact, I only saw it as a reflection on the sea." \n\n"Look," the disinterested executive said, absentmindedly polishing his spectacles with a wing feather, "Talarayi will do what Talarayi does best: being mysterious and producing rumours. It only becomes our business if they actually become capable of doing business. A spooky green light doesn't change anything. Now, I told you I wanted the report on Fragrance's trade growth yesterday! I expect it within the next three hours. No more of these distractions."\n\nThe helmsgriff and bosun exchanged a glance as the executive marched out the office, with the griffon leaning across her chair. "What do you think? Big ritual maybe? Something to do with the Golden City?"\n\nThe bosun narrowed his eyes."

DEL_AF_news_event.1.d: "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]News has been emerging from the southern seas of Zebrica over the last few days bringing concerning tidings from the Golden City of Tampuk. While reports are few and far between from many of the tribes and confederations that inhabit the region, there have been consistent throughlines of a new dark magic growing in the jungles. Disappearances have been growing at a shocking rate as the Feathisian Envoy to the region has been unable to get in contact with any local leaders. A crisis may be brewing at the southern edge of the world, and it seems that it reeks."

DEL_AF_event_start.1.d: "The heat and the burning sands subsided, from an eternity of torment, a moment of clarity, as the Emperor of Castanor walked forwards, his legs taking him to a destination he knew not where. Removing his hand from his eyes, he looked out before him and saw sweeping green fields, and mighty White Walls.\n\nBy the Silver Dragon, how the walls had grown, he had to return and help his mighty engineer complete their work. How long had he been gone? And even more shocking, how fortunate was he to have been returned to Castonath after all this time? After however many years he had been battling in hell? It could only be the will of the gods, a just reward. But he must go now, he must find the ruling Castan, and there must be a celebration! The end of the Second Great Cleansing!\n\nCastan Beastbane walked down from the mountain, his armor gleaming in the sunlight as he descended from the foot of the Trialmount, approaching the villages outside of Castonath. Finding the town in the midst of a market day, Castan revealed himself to his people once more with a wave of his arm, and a beckoning to his subjects, Castan spoke,\n\n"Subject of the Empire of Castan, I, Castan Beastbane have returned from the depths of hell, my quest to the gates of hell to eradicate the beasts most foul has been completed at last! Come, Castanates all, bring my to the Castan that yet lives, for as the White Walls yet stand, all cannot be lost!\n\nCastan watched as the people of this quaint town began to grip one another in joy, exchanging smiles from ear to ear, shrill cries and bells of churches rang as the Emperor returned to his land. As all was well and all was noble once more in Castanor."

DEL_AF_event_start.2.t: "A Fate Undone" #Claimed by Comma   Hi Comma
DEL_AF_event_start.2.d: "The head of a dozen families had gathered every able zebra body to the far edge of his village. The rest of the population, Selunam had ordered to flee after hearsay had given way to reputable reports from the chiefs of other confederations before they, too, fled. The weak, the young, and the old would survive in distant lands. Someone had to slow the monsters down.\n\nThen, a verdant rolled from the mountains, descending to face them—vanishing until he could see a white wall of zebras freshly killed as flanked by some wicked taunt. Foreign bones and barely any skin held up these bodies, yet one gaunt spectre of a "man"—as they'd called it—stood amidst them all, tormenting their full fat and flesh with nothing but the glow of his skeleton. "Spawns!" the mass of bones roared. "You behold before yourselves the Emperor of Castan, second of his name, whose rightful title is Beastbane! I see that my best efforts to eradicate evil ones have only just begun, and they come into so many new perverted forms! Still! Let the survivors know this: that from the wellspring of your righteous deaths, Castan yet lives!"\n\nUnder the gleam of the enemy's sword, Selunam and his mighty band stood their ground. In the seconds-long chaos afterwards, suffocating in the undead's green smoke and mist, nearly all fell, and Selunam could feel his lungs and heart defying the very notion of life, standing still, unwilling to budge in the face of his willpower. Then, in his dying moments, after calling for a retreat, he felt his soul slip away, attempting to rest and sleep away from his body—until, under the shrill cries of corpses and the twang of metal meeting metal and spells over there, a foul force, green and smelling of death, entvined over Selunam's soul and pulled it back in:\n\nTired, dazed, sapped of any true and real will. There was only obedience."
DEL_AF_event_start.2.a: "A Death Refused."
DEL_AF_event.1.t: "Total Victory"
DEL_AF_event.1.d: "The scouts scored the first few kills, beginning to skirt around what they suspected to be a new den of beasts. Castan beamed at the news, and made a mental note to congratulate the scouts. With each reconnaissance mission, the details on their target became clearer.\n\nIt seemed as if the beasts were flocking to this warren in the valley, likely some sort of staging ground for whatever grisly plans they had for his people. His mood became resolute. No beast, however fearsome, would cause harm on the great Beastbane's watch! Refusing to rest for the night (as he had on many other nights), Castan marshalled his finest company of warriors, giving the order to advance towards this confluence of hellspawn, posthaste. Usually such a distance was not something that could be marched across in one night, but his soldiers, clearly inspired, made it so.\n\nAs dawn broke over the valley, Beastbane's army crested the hills. Swords and spears raised, the host moved to surround the warren, shouting battlecries and cheering their emperor on. The white banners of Castanor gleamed alongside their bearers' armour, the full might of humanity on display. Resplendent in the morning's early rays, Castan raised his sword, signalling the attack.\n\nAnd the the heavenly calls of the clarions answered.\n\nThe attack went off without a hitch. The warren's structure had no chance against Beastbane's army, with many tunnels collapsing with the monsters inside. The soldiers rushed forward to slay the stragglers, their losses minimal. Sweeping into the central nests, the vicious progeny came next, posing even less of a threat. It was all over in minutes, with victorious cheers erupting from the army. Castan walked joyously through the destroyed warren, surrounded by his comrades, all shouting "Beastbane! Beastbane!""
DEL_AF_event.1.a: "And the hunt continued, week by week."
DEL_AF_event.2.t: "Absolute Horror"
DEL_AF_event.2.d: "It had started with rumours. "Something had happened to Talarayi." But many tales sprung from the southeast, this was just the latest story that would be buried by a competing rumour in due course. The village did not care. And indeed, many more stories came, but they kept repeating. Something had happened – something bad had happened – to Talarayi. With each rumour the outlines of the petrifying truth became clearer.\n\nThen came the refugees. The mood shifted to panic quickly. Something had consumed the southeast, an unholy stain of black magic and death. Only the healthy and fit had been able to outpace its tireless advance spread. The survivors begged the village to flee, describing in horrid detail what had happened to their own communities. Struggling against the shock, the elders agreed and ordered an evacuation. But it would take time; this was not something that could happen over night.\n\nToo late did they realise their window had passed. A dark and silent horde spilled over the hills and through the trees like a sentient wave of sewage, reeking of rot. The village was encircled, with only a few able to escape ahead of their advance. The rest looked out from their palisade, the nightmarish army of corpses having paused, hope draining from the community. The necromantic host was a menagerie, with zebras, griffons, kirin and many others in their ranks, all in various conditions of decomposition. Atop a crag they spotted what must have been their leader: a skeletal, wingless gargoyle, raising his sword.\n\nAnd Tartarus followed with him.\n\nThere was no battle as the undead descended. The palisade crumbled as the horde piled up against it like a great wave, flooding into the village. The warriors were slain in droves, pierced by rusted spears or mauled by broken limbs. The doomed civilians fell next, none able to defy fate as the dead swept into every household, killing methodically and mercilessly. Some burned themselves and their families to deny the horde bodies, but few succeeded before the flames were smothered by animated corpses. As the victorious lich walked the village's once lively streets, his victims arose as his newest puppets."

DEL_AF_event.3.t: "Living Out in the Light" #Claimed by Comma
DEL_AF_event.3.d: "Fires the color of moss and magic swirled around the false sunlight that called himself Jaddar, burning away the walls of the city Tobuck to make room for this battlefield of destiny. Despite the beauty this Jaddar possessed, Beastbane had the power to see past the illusions: the light hid the darkness, the undead skeleton that called himself the divine sun, this Jaddar, and dared usher in the power of all things holy.\n\nYet this trick of the light—a sure sign of a jesting Unseelie—could still hurt, maim, and kill, for solar beams shot through Beastbane's forces, and he smelled the stench of Jaddar's witchery. No, not one more dead soul under his watch! He charged through mountains of Jaddar's useless legions and served as a shiny distraction for Jaddar to waste his powers on, deflecting every beam shot at him with his faithful blade. The belligerent legions, however, dared swarm on top of him, and for a second, when their sickly flesh washed over him and threatened to consume him alive, even the brave Beastbane faltered in his faith in the gods.\n\nBut at the last moment, the one that turned the tide was not Beastbane himself but his steadfast army, answering with a swarm of their own, beating back Jaddar's devilish legions, scraping their limbs away with whatever they could scrounge from the ground. Then, after freeing their humble hero, they turned their sights to a depowered Jaddar—he had already been immobilized by several thrown rocks.\n\nOne thing led to another: to fashion this evil one an ignoble end, he wouldn't die in a duel nor alone in peace but as the target of one huge angry mob of warriors, stoned by the entire army and a singular laughing, triumphant Beastbane. From pebbles and more rocks to broken swords and armor pieces, up to random garbage from the former city—Jaddar endured it all, then expired out of sheer humiliation."

Had there been more? Had his inheritors committed more to push the borders of the First true Empire of Man? Or had there been more as the abominable feylings and their brood overran the land?\n\nIt truth, it mattered not if this was the third or fourth or fifth cleansing. Just like Castanor would rise to be the Final Empire, this would be the Final cleansing. Cannor would be made clean. undiluted by the spawn of Agrados.\n\nAnd so his legions marched and marched again. And what would fall against them! Not even during the second Great Cleansing would he see fey things so strange and abominable, so filled with strange magics. They roared with fire, flung spells that twisted flesh at his men and sometimes would even wear steel. Had the fey of Deepwoods worn steel before? He could not recall. But it would not matter, for they would all perish!\n\nYet despite triumph after triumph strange visions and dreams had begun plaguing him. Sometimes, if only for a moment, the shining silver legions were replaced by walking corpses, butchering and raising more of their kind. And his own hands had not looked like that of man.

DEL_AF_event.7.d: "Vanavond was een van die zeldzame avonden dat Maya Schoppenboer naar beneden kwam om avond te eten met haar familie. Normaal zat ze in stilte aan tafel, als ze er wel zat, maar vandaag was geen gewone dag.\n\nMymy en Coco waren vanochtend net terug gekomen, onder de krassen en blauwe plekken, nadat ze het hele weekend vermist waren.Mymy, met haar Nerf-musket in haar hand, zag eruit alsof ze een enorme strijd had doorstaan en stonk naar zeewater, terwijl Coco nog steeds haar kenmerkende glimlach op haar gezicht had terwijl ze een rugzak met zich meesleepte vol spullen die Maya nog nooit eerder had gezien.Ze waren allebei helemaal uitgeput en gingen na het douchen meteen naar bed, en stelden de vragen van hun ouders tot etenstijd uit. De antwoorden waren... op zijn zachtst gezegd bizar.\n\n''Echt waar! Ik heb vijf vijandelijke schepen opgeblazen, en als het niet voor dat ene geluksschot op de munitieopslag was geweest, had ik de zesde ook nog eens kunnen raken!'' Mymy herinnerde zich haar laatste gevecht tegen Beastbane's ondode troepen, en zwaaide opgewonden met haar marinesabel. Coco's verhaal was daarentegen minder spannend. ''Ik snap nog steeds niet waarom de griffioenen mij als Staatspresident hebben gekozen, ik denk dat het iets te maken heeft met hoe ik Afrikaans tegen ze sprak, maar ik weet het niet zeker. Ze hebben er wel voor gezorgd dat ik er uiteindelijk uit kwam, die arme wezens...'' Ze speelde met de medaille in haar hand, een afscheidscadeau van Atlas Steyn, voordat ze elkaar in de woestijn vaarwel wensten.\n\n''Wat het ook is, ik ben blij dat jullie beiden veilig thuis zijn gekomen.'' Hun moeder haalde opgelucht adem terwijl hun vader knikte. Ondertussen sprak de altijd zwijgzame Maya voor het eerst in wat een eeuwigheid leek: ''Coco, Mymy, kunnen jullie allebei... mij later alles over je avonturen vertellen?'' Alsof ze op dit moment wachtte, zei Coco enthousiast met een grote stralende glimlach: ''Natuurlijk Maya!''" #Note to translator: Doesn't need translating

DEL_AF_event.8.d: "Tonight was one of the rare nights that Maya Schoppenboer came downstairs to have dinner with the family. Normally, she sat through the conversations at the dinner table in complete silence if she was ever there, but today was no ordinary day.\n\nMymy and Coco just came back in the morning after going missing for the weekend with scrapes and bruises. Mymy, nerf musket in hand, looked like she went through a huge battle and reeked of seawater, while Coco was still wearing her signature smile on her face as she was hauling a rucksack of items Maya had never seen before. Both of them were completely worn out and went straight to bed after a shower, leaving questions from their worried parents until dinner time. The answers were... wild to say the least.\n\n''It's true! I managed to blow up five enemy ships, and if it wasn't for that one lucky shot at the ammo dump, I would have gotten the sixth!'' Mymy recalled her last stand against Beastbane's undead forces, waving her naval sabre in excitement. Coco's story, on the other hand, was less exciting. ''I still don't get why the griffons selected me as Staatspresident, I think it's something about how I spoke Afrikaans to them but I'm not sure. They did ensure that I got out in the end, those poor people...'' She fiddled with the medal in her hand, a parting gift from Atlas Steyn before bidding each other farewell in the desert.\n\n''Whatever it is, I'm glad both of you came home safe.'' Their mother sighed a huge breath of relief while their father nodded. Meanwhile, the ever silent Maya spoke up for the first time in what seemed like an eternity: ''Coco, Mymy, can both of you... tell me all about your adventures there later?''\n\nAs if waiting for this moment, Coco enthusiastically said with a huge, gleaming smile, ''Of course, Maya!''"

The griffons, who found her passed out in a corner Griffeveld, spoke in something resembling Afrikaans. After a bit of banter, Coco ended up being received with a personal audience from the leader of the Zuid-Zebrikaansche Vrystaat, Atlas Steyn. She was then shoved behind a desk in the presidential office and proclaimed Staatspresident of the Vrystaat in front of an enthusiastic audience, much to her confusion. \n\nNow stuck in this land known as Zebrica, Coco's first order of the day is to look for Mymy, who had arrived a little earlier than her and had apparently colonized a piece of land under the name of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. She is going to have a talk with Mymy about this whole mess afterwards."

Dejected from this setback, she then had a bright idea while munching on her stroopwafel for breakfast, “why not go for another world to colonize and spread the glorious Dutch Empire?”\n\nJumping straight into action, she put together a device that took her into a brave new world and landed in the Feathisian South Zebrides under the colonization of Feathisian griffons. Using her musket with reusable bullets, she has taken over the South Zebrides, re-established the VOC, and proclaimed the Dutch South Zebrides while renaming Beakavia to Japsterdam. If she can get Coco that landed somewhere on Zebrica to join her, the banner of Oranje-Nassau shall fly across the whole planet in their combined might."

 POLITICS_DAYBREAKER_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography§!: Myths and fables tell of two regal sisters who ruled together, creating harmony for all the land. The eldest used her alicorn powers to raise the sun at dawn; the younger brought out the moon to begin the night. While it is obvious today that the tales speak of the Royal Pony Sisters who rule Equestria, few, if any concrete facts are known about their history.\n\nFor over a thousand years, Princess Celestia has safeguarded her ponies, and the land of Equestria. Doing it solely from the goodness of her own heart, she didn't ask for any compensation, nor demanded their absolute loyalty. Everything the Princess wished was for her little ponies to be protected. Contemporary times, however, are not kind to the ideals of friendship and harmony, with the growing threats on all sides leaving very little room for pleasantries.\n\nThus came the ascension of Daybreaker. Infuriated by the gall of her enemies, the former Princess, now Empress, wasted little time in reorganising the state to something far greater. Many ponies protest in the face of sudden, radical changes, but Daybreaker cares little for the complaints of a minority: all she needs is a devoted herd ready obey her every order.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Twotail813"

All her doubts are gone, all the regrets burned away. What remains is a roaring, determined flame that burns brightest in the deepest darkness. A gorgeous, magnificent light with an aura of awe... Hahaha! Why did I not do this sooner?"

 #MISC NOTES ABOUT WRITING DAYBREAKER BASED ON STARLIGHT'S FEVER DREAM FROM THE SHOW (NO NIGHTMARE KNIGHTS IS NOT CANON FUCK OFF)
 #Daybreaker is bombastic, arrogant, pompous and aggressive. Power-hungry, greedy, spiteful, thinks she doesnt need anyone else. She often laughs, cackles and grins, as if she really enjoys being herself. She likes to mock her enemies and despises her sister, thinking she should've killed her ages ago. She appears unhinged, yet can think clearly and make intelligent decisions. She looks down upon everyone and thinks she can rely entirely on herself. She is extremely powerful with magic, but doesnt casually use this power, except to destroy her enemies.

 # Events
 solarempire.1.t:0 "Confrontation"
 solarempire.1.d_luna:0 "TODO Luna goes to Celestias room to check how shes doing only to see Daybreaker feeding Philomena. Luna asks what happened and is shitting herself. Daybreaker casually says shes fine, compares her state to Philomena's rebirth. Luna tries to cope with the situation and basically nervously says everything will be fine, she mentions using the elements to fix her, like Luna herself was fixed, then Daybreaker says "Oh you wanna banish me to the sun bitch?" goes apeshit (while laughing) and attacks Luna. Chase sequence happens and Luna somehow manages to flee (figure out how). see my initial draft for a slightly different kind of event in the comment below for inspiration."
 solarempire.1.d_no_luna:0 "TODO same as above except its Twilight Sparkle instead, and she does get captured. She doesnt mention the elements due to the possibility of rarity being captured by NM when this event happens. Instead, something else triggers the fight, up to you what."
 #"Princess Celestia-" Raven Inkwell managed to say before being interrupted.\n"Raven dear, what did I tell you about my title and name?" Daybreaker said softly as she fed her pet Phoenix bird.\nThe white pony somehow appeared paler than she already was. "O-oh, my apologies, I'm still not used to-"\n"I forgive you this time, as you've helped me for so many long years. But I expect better of you, Raven. You're the best assistant I could hope for. So don't disappoint me next time, will you?" She turned to look down at her.\nRaven felt like the bright orange irises with slit pupils illuminated even the darkest reaches of her mind. "Y-yes ma'am. I-I wanted to say that your sister, along with Twilight Sparkle and her friends, want to meet with you."\nDaybreaker raised her eyebrows. "Really? Let them come in, then!" She cackled as Raven walked to the door.\n\nA group of ponies and a dragon walked inside, their steps careful and slow, looking at Daybreaker with concern.\n"I hope you don't mind I'm feeding Philomena, do you?" Daybreaker said casually.\n"S-sister, I... we need to talk," Luna said, doing her best to sound stern.\n"Oh? Now you want to talk? You didn't want to talk about your problems a thousand years ago, and NOW you want to TALK?" Despite the words, Daybreaker chuckled in amusement.\nLuna was speechless, so Twilight Sparkle stepped forth. "Celestia, you've suffered the same fate Luna did. Please, let us use the Elements of Harmony to-"\n"What, banish me into the sun? Ha! Good luck with that." She finished feeding her bird and turned to face them. "Let me stop you right there. Fluttershy, remember when you thought Philomena died, only to realize she was reborn from the ashes?"\n"U-um... yes?"\n"THAT is my fate. I was like a sickly old bird, but now I feel better than ever."\n"You're delusional!" Rainbow Dash exclaimed. "We're gonna blast you with a rainbow and fix you right up!"\nDaybreaker burst into laughter. "Go then! Go fetch your precious elements! But know that you won't be welcome back here."\nAs the other ponies galloped outside, Luna looked at her sister with teary eyes. "I-I'm so sorry..."\n"I don't need to hear your mewling. Get out of MY SIGHT!"

 solarempire.2.t:0 "The Elements of Harmony"
 solarempire.2.d_m6_together_th:0 "TODO mane six (and spike) are going to the tree of harmony to fetch the elements, clearly in a bit of a rush and with the implication they need to do so to save celestia from herself. But to their horror, Daybreaker is already there, says she was expecting them to come sooner. her horn glows and the exit is blocked by fire, and daybreaker does the cliche evil villain maniac laugh. She threatens to destroy the tree of harmony and the elements if they dont surrender immediately. the mane six are in complete shock and disbelief initally, not believing she'd do it as the tree was planted by starswirl the bearded, celestia's mentor. with a smug smile, she blasts the tree, damaging it severely. twilight says smth about the everfree forest going loose without the tree, daybreaker says shes well aware and will just burn the entire forest and everything in it, shocking fluttershy the animal lover, however only doing so after the forest consumes ponyville. the mane six argue with each other about what to do, with rainbow dash optionally saying they just fight her anyways because saving equestria is more important than ponyville/everfree. Twilight then suddenly steps forth and asks daybreaker to spare her friends and ponyville and just take her prisoner. daybreaker accepts, twilight and triumphant daybreaker are engulfed in flames and disappear, leaving behind the mane six to process what just happened and why"
 solarempire.2.d_m6_together:0 "TODO Mane six boldly arrive at Daybreaker's headquarters (full of royal guard) with the elements, saying theyre gonna blast her with a rainbow. Daybreaker laughs in their face, telling them that there are far worse threats to deal with as even the everfree forest is occupied by an invading enemy, and that she is the only one who can stop them. the mane six hesitate for a moment, which gives an opportunity for daybreaker to tell the royal guard the mane six plan to attack her with the elements and banish her into the sun. the mane six try to reason with the guard and say theyre just trying to turn daybreaker back to celestia, but daybreaker says they might also be trying to turn her into stone. royal guard, with no way to predict what the elements will do, tell the mane six that using the elements against her is legally speaking treason. Then daybreaker accuses the mane six of high treason and plotting against her, and tells the guard to arrest them. as the guard approach, twilight panics and says that she will admit her crime if her friends are pardoned. daybreaker accepts the offer, twilight teleports her protesting and furious friends away, and is arrested by the royal guard."
 solarempire.2.d_m6_separated:0 "TODO without rarity and/or twilight, and aware that both luna and celestia have gone evil, the remaining mane six (and spike) realize their situation is hopeless as they cant use the elements of harmony. they are discussing their plan in some secret meeting place (not the castle of harmony, this can happen during civil war/war so it may be occupied) and agree that they need to go into hiding and potentially organize/join a larger resistance movement, coz by themselves theres nothing they can do."
 solarempire.2.a:0 "My greatest threat has been taken care of."

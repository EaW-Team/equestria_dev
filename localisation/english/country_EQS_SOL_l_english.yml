 POLITICS_DAYBREAKER_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography§!: Myths and fables tell of two regal sisters who ruled together, creating harmony for all the land. The eldest used her alicorn powers to raise the sun at dawn; the younger brought out the moon to begin the night. While it is obvious today that the tales speak of the Royal Pony Sisters who rule Equestria, few, if any concrete facts are known about their history.\n\nFor over a thousand years, Princess Celestia has safeguarded her ponies, and the land of Equestria. Doing it solely from the goodness of her own heart, she didn't ask for any compensation, nor demanded their absolute loyalty. Everything the Princess wished was for her little ponies to be protected. Contemporary times, however, are not kind to the ideals of friendship and harmony, with the growing threats on all sides leaving very little room for pleasantries.\n\nThus came the ascension of Daybreaker. Infuriated by the gall of her enemies, the former Princess, now Empress, wasted little time in reorganising the state to something far greater. Many ponies protest in the face of sudden, radical changes, but Daybreaker cares little for the complaints of a minority: all she needs is a devoted herd ready obey her every order.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Twotail813"

All her doubts are gone, all the regrets burned away. What remains is a roaring, determined flame that burns brightest in the deepest darkness. A gorgeous, magnificent light with an aura of awe... Hahaha! Why did I not do this sooner?"

 #MISC NOTES ABOUT WRITING DAYBREAKER BASED ON STARLIGHT'S FEVER DREAM FROM THE SHOW (NO NIGHTMARE KNIGHTS IS NOT CANON FUCK OFF)
 #Daybreaker is bombastic, arrogant, pompous and aggressive. Power-hungry, greedy, spiteful, thinks she doesnt need anyone else. She often laughs, cackles and grins, as if she really enjoys being herself. She likes to mock her enemies and despises her sister, thinking she should've killed her ages ago. She appears unhinged, yet can think clearly and make intelligent decisions. She looks down upon everyone and thinks she can rely entirely on herself. She is extremely powerful with magic, but doesnt casually use this power, except to destroy her enemies.

 solarempire.1.t:0 "Confrontation"
 solarempire.1.d_luna:0 ""It's not too late," Luna kept telling herself on her way to her sister's sanctum. "It's not too late, you can still help, but only you can. You have to do this, you have to, you have to, it's what she would have done for you if she'd known about it earlier..."\n\nWhere once Celestia's sanctum had been an ordered chaos of letters, books and mementos, now it was pristine. Where once you could find a pillow or a plush rug or a reading chair to sit anywhere, now everything soft in the room was gone, exposing the hard tile floors. Luna cleared her throat. Her sister had heard her coming in, how could she not? But she didn't look up from her phoenix. "Sister. I see you've decided to confront me. Speak."\n\nLuna's voice caught in her throat for a moment. "You... sister, you are unwell. Your mane, it burns. Please, for yourself as much as anypony else, let me help you."\n\n"Of course I am different. I am Daybreaker, and Daybreaker is me. I always have been, just as the acorn is the oak and the Philomena before you is the same one that shall emerge, purified and stronger, from her own pyre. So tell me, what sort of help did you have in mind? And do consider your next words carefully," she added, her burning eye finally fixing on Luna, "For yourself as much as anypony else."\n\nLuna bowed her head. Daybreaker looked back at her phoenix, not noticing the subtle shift. "I would give you the same help you gave me. I would summon the element bearers, that they could free you of this curse of our kind."\n\nDaybreaker laughed, long and loud. "Comparing your childish tantrum to my apotheosis is the funniest, most pathetic joke I have heard all year. We'll see what else you have to say in the dungeons!" A roiling arc of fire sliced through the air, wrapping around Luna like a snake. It pulled taught, dragging her off her hooves and towards her sister. Then, she was gone. The Luna before Daybreaker dissolved into purple glittering mist, while the true Luna had already left, already taken flight, was already soaring higher and higher, as if she could outfly her failure."
 solarempire.1.d_no_luna:0 "TODO same as above except its Twilight Sparkle instead, and she does get captured. She doesnt mention the elements due to the possibility of rarity being captured by NM when this event happens. Instead, something else triggers the fight, up to you what."
 solarempire.1.a:0 "I'll deal with you later, "sister"."
 solarempire.1.b:0 "You still have much to learn, my faithful student."
 
 solarempire.2.t:0 "The Elements of Harmony"
 solarempire.2.d_m6_together_th:0 "TODO mane six (and spike) are going to the tree of harmony to fetch the elements, clearly in a bit of a rush and with the implication they need to do so to save celestia from herself. But to their horror, Daybreaker is already there, says she was expecting them to come sooner. her horn glows and the exit is blocked by fire, and daybreaker does the cliche evil villain maniac laugh. She threatens to destroy the tree of harmony and the elements if they dont surrender immediately. the mane six are in complete shock and disbelief initally, not believing she'd do it as the tree was planted by starswirl the bearded, celestia's mentor. with a smug smile, she blasts the tree, damaging it severely. twilight says smth about the everfree forest going loose without the tree, daybreaker says shes well aware and will just burn the entire forest and everything in it, shocking fluttershy the animal lover, however only doing so after the forest consumes ponyville. the mane six argue with each other about what to do, with rainbow dash optionally saying they just fight her anyways because saving equestria is more important than ponyville/everfree. Twilight then suddenly steps forth and asks daybreaker to spare her friends and ponyville and just take her prisoner. daybreaker accepts, twilight and triumphant daybreaker are engulfed in flames and disappear, leaving behind the mane six to process what just happened and why"
 solarempire.2.d_m6_together:0 "TODO Mane six boldly arrive at Daybreaker's headquarters (full of royal guard) with the elements, saying theyre gonna blast her with a rainbow. Daybreaker laughs in their face, telling them that there are far worse threats to deal with as even the everfree forest is occupied by an invading enemy, and that she is the only one who can stop them. the mane six hesitate for a moment, which gives an opportunity for daybreaker to tell the royal guard the mane six plan to attack her with the elements and banish her into the sun. the mane six try to reason with the guard and say theyre just trying to turn daybreaker back to celestia, but daybreaker says they might also be trying to turn her into stone. royal guard, with no way to predict what the elements will do, tell the mane six that using the elements against her is legally speaking treason. Then daybreaker accuses the mane six of high treason and plotting against her, and tells the guard to arrest them. as the guard approach, twilight panics and says that she will admit her crime if her friends are pardoned. daybreaker accepts the offer, twilight teleports her protesting and furious friends away, and is arrested by the royal guard."
 solarempire.2.d_m6_separated:0 "TODO without rarity and/or twilight, and aware that both luna and celestia have gone evil, the remaining mane six (and spike) realize their situation is hopeless as they cant use the elements of harmony. they are discussing their plan in some secret meeting place (not the castle of harmony, this can happen during civil war/war so it may be occupied) and agree that they need to go into hiding and potentially organize/join a larger resistance movement, coz by themselves theres nothing they can do."
 solarempire.2.a:0 "My greatest threat has been taken care of."
 
 solarempire.3.t:0 "The Imperial Proclamation"
 solarempire.3.d_canterlot:0 "A huge crowd of curious ponies had gathered in a plaza in front of the Canterlot Castle, having heard that Princess Celestia was about to hold an important speech. Rumours swirled about what had happened to her, so they were eager to see their ruler.\n\nThe creature who appeared on the balcony was indeed a white alicorn, but with a flaming mane and a wicked grin. As the ponies stared at her changed form, she began to speak without hesitation in the loud and bombastic royal canterlot voice:\n"My little ponies! On this day we mark a transition. For a thousand years, Equestria stood as the crowning achievement of civilized beings. But there were those who would set us against one another, and we took up arms to defend our way of life against our enemies.\n"To foil the wicked plans of those who dream of our ruin and doom, I have taken the decision to unlock my full potential as an alicorn. Do not be alarmed by my incandescent appearance. Despite all the changes, the same pony still rules and guards you. I simply ask you to place your devotion and trust in me as you always have, as we step forth to a brighter tomorrow.\n"In my new form, I shall be called Daybreaker. Equestria too shall change, to become a stronger and more secure society, bereft of strife and weakness. Now, the Solar Empire will rise from the ashes of old like a brilliant Phoenix. As its Empress, I swear to guide the nation with a firm and determined hoof, and vanquish all those who stand in the way of harmony. We have been tested, but we have emerged stronger. We move forward as one people: the Imperial citizens of the Solar Empire. Together we shall prevail!"\n\nSome years ago, every pony in the crowd would have been mortified by the speech. But now, hundreds of them stomped their hooves and cheered. Daybreaker's shining eyes saw those who did not."

They mention that a lot of ponies have deserted lately and gone into hiding (see the event effect for full list if needed). Sunset surprisingly says she will stay loyal, but says the two shouldnt worry and that she has a plan. she asks starlight and tempest to find the mane six if possible, but avoid communication with her to avoid any risks."

 POLITICS_DAYBREAKER_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography§!: Myths and fables tell of two regal sisters who ruled together, creating harmony for all the land. The eldest used her alicorn powers to raise the sun at dawn; the younger brought out the moon to begin the night. While it is obvious today that the tales speak of the Royal Pony Sisters who rule Equestria, few, if any concrete facts are known about their history.\n\nFor over a thousand years, Princess Celestia has safeguarded her ponies, and the land of Equestria. Doing it solely from the goodness of her own heart, she didn't ask for any compensation, nor demanded their absolute loyalty. Everything the Princess wished was for her little ponies to be protected. Contemporary times, however, are not kind to the ideals of friendship and harmony, with the growing threats on all sides leaving very little room for pleasantries.\n\nThus came the ascension of Daybreaker. Infuriated by the gall of her enemies, the former Princess, now Empress, wasted little time in reorganising the state to something far greater. Many ponies protest in the face of sudden, radical changes, but Daybreaker cares little for the complaints of a minority: all she needs is a devoted herd ready to give their all to protect what was once known as Equestria.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Twotail813"

All her doubts are gone, all the regrets burned away. What remains is a roaring, determined flame that burns brightest in the deepest darkness. A gorgeous, magnificent light with an aura of awe... Hahaha! Why did I not do this sooner?"

 solarempire.1.t:0 "Confrontation"
 solarempire.1.d:0 ""Princess Celestia-" Raven Inkwell managed to say before being interrupted.\n"Raven dear, what did I tell you about my title and name?" Daybreaker said softly as she fed her pet Phoenix bird.\nThe white pony somehow appeared paler than she already was. "O-oh, my apologies, I'm still not used to-"\n"I forgive you this time, as you've helped me for so many long years. But I expect better of you, Raven. You're the best assistant I could hope for. So don't disappoint me next time, will you?" She turned to look down at her.\nRaven felt like the bright orange irises with slit pupils illuminated even the darkest reaches of her mind. "Y-yes ma'am. I-I wanted to say that your sister, along with Twilight Sparkle and her friends, want to meet with you."\nDaybreaker raised her eyebrows. "Really? Let them come in, then!" She cackled as Raven walked to the door.\n\nSeven ponies walked inside, their steps careful and slow, looking at Daybreaker with concern.\n"I hope you don't mind that I feed Philomena, will you?" Daybreaker said casually.\n"S-sister, I... we need to talk," Luna said, doing her best to sound stern.\n"Oh? Now you want to talk? You didn't want to talk about your problems a thousand years ago, and NOW you want to TALK?" Despite the words, Daybreaker chuckled in amusement.\nLuna was speechless, so Twilight Sparkle stepped forth. "Celestia, you've suffered the same fate Luna did. Please, let us use the Elements of Harmony to-"\n"What, banish me into the sun? Ha! Good luck with that." She finished feeding her bird and turned to face them. "Let me stop you right there. Fluttershy, remember when you thought Philomena died, only to realize she was reborn from the ashes?"\n"U-um... yes?"\n"THAT is my fate. I was like a sickly old bird, but now I feel better than ever."\n"You're delusional!" Rainbow Dash exclaimed. "We're gonna blast you with a rainbow and fix you right up!"\nDaybreaker burst into laughter. "Go then! Go fetch your precious elements! But know that you won't be welcome back here."\nAs the other six ponies galloped outside, Luna looked at her sister with teary eyes. "I-I'm so sorry..."\n"I don't need to hear your mewling. Get out of MY SIGHT!""

 solarempire.2.t:0 "A Change of Command"
 solarempire.2.d:0 ""I truly am glad that so many of you answered my call," Daybreaker said to the commanders of the royal guard who had assembled in her throne room. "There must be an awful lot of evil rumours about me swirling around."\nThe officers stood at attention, yet glanced at each other with uncertainty.\nThe former Princess smiled while her flaming mane crackled. "As you can see, I have indeed changed in many ways. You may even be reminded of what happened to Luna. A Princess has become an Empress. But what does this mean for you? Let me tell you this: I expect you to continue to fulfill your duties and obey my orders. There has been no change of command. I 
 
 
 
 While Nightmare Moon was a corrupted version of Luna, I am an improvement, far stronger than Celestia ever was."\nThe royal guard now struggled to maintain their stoic faces, especially as Daybreaker walked down the steps of her dais.\n"I see you do not believe me. That is fair, I have yet to prove myself." She chuckled softly, closely observing the facial expressions of each pony in the room. "So please, don't make any drastic decisions and give me a chance. And remember, you can always resign if you want to." "
 
 
 
 But let me tell you this: Celestia never truly appreciated you for your work, now did she?"  "Without you, who would defend Equestria from its enemies? Who would maintain order? Who would keep my little ponies safe?" She stopped in front of one of the older officers. "You may remember the Winter Revolution, when Celestia ordered you to stand down. Was that not weakness? Should she not have let you fulfill your duty and maintain the unity of Equestria?"\nSome of the royal guards nodded.\nDaybreaker's smile widened into a grin that revealed a row of glittering sharp fangs. "I promise far greater respect for your work. In return, I simply ask you to trust me and follow my orders. Isn't that what good soldiers do?"\n"Yes, ma'am!" some of the guards replied. Daybreaker kept in mind who did not do so."

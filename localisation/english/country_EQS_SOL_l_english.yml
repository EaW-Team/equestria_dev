 POLITICS_DAYBREAKER_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography§!: Myths and fables tell of two regal sisters who ruled together, creating harmony for all the land. The eldest used her alicorn powers to raise the sun at dawn; the younger brought out the moon to begin the night. While it is obvious today that the tales speak of the Royal Pony Sisters who rule Equestria, few, if any concrete facts are known about their history.\n\nFor over a thousand years, Princess Celestia has safeguarded her ponies, and the land of Equestria. Doing it solely from the goodness of her own heart, she didn't ask for any compensation, nor demanded their absolute loyalty. Everything the Princess wished was for her little ponies to be protected. Contemporary times, however, are not kind to the ideals of friendship and harmony, with the growing threats on all sides leaving very little room for pleasantries.\n\nThus came the ascension of Daybreaker. Infuriated by the gall of her enemies, the former Princess, now Empress, wasted little time in reorganising the state to something far greater. Many ponies protest in the face of sudden, radical changes, but Daybreaker cares little for the complaints of a minority: all she needs is a devoted herd ready to give their all to protect what was once known as Equestria.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Twotail813"

All her doubts are gone, all the regrets burned away. What remains is a roaring, determined flame that burns brightest in the deepest darkness. A gorgeous, magnificent light with an aura of awe... Hahaha! Why did I not do this sooner?"

 #MISC NOTES ABOUT WRITING DAYBREAKER BASED ON STARLIGHT'S FEVER DREAM FROM THE SHOW (NO NIGHTMARE KNIGHTS IS NOT CANON FUCK OFF)
 #Daybreaker is bombastic, arrogant, pompous and aggressive. Power-hungry, greedy, spiteful, thinks she doesnt need anyone else. She often laughs, cackles and grins, as if she really enjoys being herself. She likes to mock her enemies and despises her sister, thinking she should've killed her ages ago. She appears unhinged, yet can think clearly and make intelligent decisions. She looks down upon everyone and thinks she can rely entirely on herself. She is extremely powerful with magic, but doesnt casually use this power, except to destroy her enemies.

 solarempire.1.t:0 "Confrontation"
 solarempire.1.d:0 "TODO Luna goes to Celestias room to check how shes doing only to see Daybreaker feeding Philomena. Luna asks what happened and is shitting herself. Daybreaker casually says shes fine, compares her state to Philomena's rebirth. Luna tries to cope with the situation and basically nervously says everything will be fine, she mentions using the elements to fix her, then Daybreaker goes apeshit and attacks Luna. Chase sequence happens and Luna somehow manages to flee (figure out how). see my initial draft for a slightly different kind of event in the comment below for inspiration."
 #"Princess Celestia-" Raven Inkwell managed to say before being interrupted.\n"Raven dear, what did I tell you about my title and name?" Daybreaker said softly as she fed her pet Phoenix bird.\nThe white pony somehow appeared paler than she already was. "O-oh, my apologies, I'm still not used to-"\n"I forgive you this time, as you've helped me for so many long years. But I expect better of you, Raven. You're the best assistant I could hope for. So don't disappoint me next time, will you?" She turned to look down at her.\nRaven felt like the bright orange irises with slit pupils illuminated even the darkest reaches of her mind. "Y-yes ma'am. I-I wanted to say that your sister, along with Twilight Sparkle and her friends, want to meet with you."\nDaybreaker raised her eyebrows. "Really? Let them come in, then!" She cackled as Raven walked to the door.\n\nA group of ponies and a dragon walked inside, their steps careful and slow, looking at Daybreaker with concern.\n"I hope you don't mind I'm feeding Philomena, do you?" Daybreaker said casually.\n"S-sister, I... we need to talk," Luna said, doing her best to sound stern.\n"Oh? Now you want to talk? You didn't want to talk about your problems a thousand years ago, and NOW you want to TALK?" Despite the words, Daybreaker chuckled in amusement.\nLuna was speechless, so Twilight Sparkle stepped forth. "Celestia, you've suffered the same fate Luna did. Please, let us use the Elements of Harmony to-"\n"What, banish me into the sun? Ha! Good luck with that." She finished feeding her bird and turned to face them. "Let me stop you right there. Fluttershy, remember when you thought Philomena died, only to realize she was reborn from the ashes?"\n"U-um... yes?"\n"THAT is my fate. I was like a sickly old bird, but now I feel better than ever."\n"You're delusional!" Rainbow Dash exclaimed. "We're gonna blast you with a rainbow and fix you right up!"\nDaybreaker burst into laughter. "Go then! Go fetch your precious elements! But know that you won't be welcome back here."\nAs the other ponies galloped outside, Luna looked at her sister with teary eyes. "I-I'm so sorry..."\n"I don't need to hear your mewling. Get out of MY SIGHT!"

 solarempire.2.t:0 "The Elements of Harmony"
 solarempire.2.d_rarity:0 "TODO mane six are going to the tree of harmony to fetch the elements, clearly in a bit of a rush and with the implication they need to do so to save celestia from herself. But to their horror, Daybreaker is already there, says she was expecting them to come sooner. her horn glows and the exit is blocked by fire,and daybreaker does the cliche evil villain maniac laugh as she destroys the tree of harmony and the elements. then she says "your turn" and basically threatens to kill the mane six right there. she fires a big burrito blast and twilight makes a magic shield to protect them. in panic the mane six talk about reforming the elements like during the nightmare moon fight, but they cant reach the elements. as twilight's shield is about to break, daybreaker suddenly stops. she makes a devils offer: if twilight stays with her, she will let her friends go. otherwise she will deadass just kill them all. her friends tell her not to take the offer, but twilight knows daybreaker really is too strong. she teleports her friends away. End scene with daybreaker basking in triumph or whatever"

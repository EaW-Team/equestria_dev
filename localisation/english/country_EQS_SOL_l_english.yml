 POLITICS_DAYBREAKER_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: Time Immemorial\n\n§YBiography§!: Myths and fables tell of two regal sisters who ruled together, creating harmony for all the land. The eldest used her alicorn powers to raise the sun at dawn; the younger brought out the moon to begin the night. While it is obvious today that the tales speak of the Royal Pony Sisters who rule Equestria, few, if any concrete facts are known about their history.\n\nFor over a thousand years, Princess Celestia has safeguarded her ponies, and the land of Equestria. Doing it solely from the goodness of her own heart, she didn't ask for any compensation, nor demanded their absolute loyalty. Everything the Princess wished was for her little ponies to be protected. Contemporary times, however, are not kind to the ideals of friendship and harmony, with the growing threats on all sides leaving very little room for pleasantries.\n\nThus came the ascension of Daybreaker. Infuriated by the gall of her enemies, the former Princess, now Empress, wasted little time in reorganising the state to something far greater. Many ponies protest in the face of sudden, radical changes, but Daybreaker cares little for the complaints of a minority: all she needs is a devoted herd ready obey her every order.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Twotail813"

 #MISC NOTES ABOUT WRITING DAYBREAKER BASED ON STARLIGHT'S FEVER DREAM FROM THE SHOW (NO NIGHTMARE KNIGHTS IS NOT CANON FUCK OFF)
 #Daybreaker is bombastic, arrogant, pompous and aggressive. Power-hungry, greedy, spiteful, thinks she doesnt need anyone else. She often laughs, cackles and grins, as if she really enjoys being herself. She likes to mock her enemies and despises her sister, thinking she should've killed her ages ago. She appears unhinged, yet can think clearly and make intelligent decisions. She looks down upon everyone and thinks she can rely entirely on herself. She is extremely powerful with magic, but doesnt casually use this power, except to destroy her enemies.

 solarempire.1.t:0 "Confrontation"
 solarempire.1.d_luna:0 ""It's not too late," Luna kept telling herself on her way to her sister's sanctum. "It's not too late, you can still help, but only you can. You have to do this, you have to, you have to, it's what she would have done for you if she'd known about it earlier..."\n\nWhere once Celestia's sanctum had been an ordered chaos of letters, books and mementos, now it was pristine. Where once you could find a pillow or a plush rug or a reading chair to sit anywhere, now everything soft in the room was gone, exposing the hard tile floors. Luna cleared her throat. Her sister had heard her coming in, how could she not? But she didn't look up from her phoenix. "Sister. I see you've decided to confront me. Speak."\n\nLuna's voice caught in her throat for a moment. "You... sister, you are unwell. Your mane, it burns. Please, for yourself as much as anypony else, let me help you."\n\n"Of course I am different. I am Daybreaker, and Daybreaker is me. I always have been, just as the acorn is the oak and the Philomena before you is the same one that shall emerge, purified and stronger, from her own pyre. So tell me, what sort of help did you have in mind? And do consider your next words carefully," she added, her burning eye finally fixing on Luna, "For yourself as much as anypony else."\n\nLuna bowed her head. Daybreaker looked back at her phoenix, not noticing the subtle shift. "I would give you the same help you gave me. I would summon the element bearers, that they could free you of this curse of our kind."\n\nDaybreaker laughed, long and loud. "Comparing your childish tantrum to my apotheosis is the funniest, most pathetic joke I have heard all year. We'll see what else you have to say in Tartarus!" A roiling arc of fire sliced through the air, wrapping around Luna like a snake. It pulled taught, dragging her off her hooves and towards her sister. Then, she was gone. The Luna before Daybreaker dissolved into purple glittering mist, while the true Luna had already left, already taken flight, was already soaring higher and higher, as if she could outfly her failure."
 solarempire.1.d_no_luna:0 "TODO same as above except its Twilight Sparkle instead, and she does get captured. She doesnt mention the elements due to the possibility of rarity being captured by NM when this event happens. Instead, something else triggers the fight, up to you what."

 solarempire.2.t:0 "The Elements of Harmony"
 solarempire.2.d_m6_together_th:0 "TODO mane six (and spike) are going to the tree of harmony to fetch the elements, clearly in a bit of a rush and with the implication they need to do so to save celestia from herself. But to their horror, Daybreaker is already there, says she was expecting them to come sooner. her horn glows and the exit is blocked by fire, and daybreaker does the cliche evil villain maniac laugh. She threatens to destroy the tree of harmony and the elements if they dont surrender immediately. the mane six are in complete shock and disbelief initally, not believing she'd do it as the tree was planted by starswirl the bearded, celestia's mentor. with a smug smile, she blasts the tree, damaging it severely. twilight says smth about the everfree forest going loose without the tree, daybreaker says shes well aware and will just burn the entire forest and everything in it, shocking fluttershy the animal lover, however only doing so after the forest consumes ponyville. the mane six argue with each other about what to do, with rainbow dash optionally saying they just fight her anyways because saving equestria is more important than ponyville/everfree. Twilight then suddenly steps forth and asks daybreaker to spare her friends and ponyville and just take her prisoner. daybreaker accepts, twilight and triumphant daybreaker are engulfed in flames and disappear, leaving behind the mane six to process what just happened and why"
 solarempire.2.d_m6_together:0 "TODO Mane six boldly arrive at Daybreaker's headquarters (full of royal guard) with the elements, saying theyre gonna blast her with a rainbow. Daybreaker laughs in their face, telling them that there are far worse threats to deal with as even the everfree forest is occupied by an invading enemy, and that she is the only one who can stop them. the mane six hesitate for a moment, which gives an opportunity for daybreaker to tell the royal guard the mane six plan to attack her with the elements and banish her into the sun. the mane six try to reason with the guard and say theyre just trying to turn daybreaker back to celestia, but daybreaker says they might also be trying to turn her into stone. royal guard, with no way to predict what the elements will do, tell the mane six that using the elements against her is legally speaking treason. Then daybreaker accuses the mane six of high treason and plotting against her, and tells the guard to arrest them. as the guard approach, twilight panics and says that she will admit her crime if her friends are pardoned. daybreaker accepts the offer, twilight teleports her protesting and furious friends away, and is arrested by the royal guard."

 solarempire.2.d_m6_separated:0 "TODO without rarity and/or twilight, and aware that both luna and celestia have gone evil, the remaining mane six (and spike) realize their situation is hopeless as they cant use the elements of harmony. they are discussing their plan in some secret meeting place (not the castle of harmony, this can happen during civil war/war so it may be occupied) and agree that they need to go into hiding and potentially organize/join a larger resistance movement, coz by themselves theres nothing they can do."

 solarempire.3.d_canterlot:0 "A huge crowd of curious ponies had gathered in a plaza in front of the Canterlot Castle, having heard that Princess Celestia was about to hold an important speech. Rumours swirled about what had happened to her, so they were eager to see their ruler.\n\nThe creature who appeared on the balcony was indeed a white alicorn, but with a flaming mane and a wicked grin. As the ponies stared at her changed form, she began to speak without hesitation in the loud and bombastic royal canterlot voice:\n"My little ponies! On this day we mark a transition. For a thousand years, Equestria stood as the crowning achievement of civilized beings. But there were those who would set us against one another, and we took up arms to defend our way of life against our enemies.\n\n"To foil the wicked plans of those who dream of our ruin and doom, I have taken the decision to unlock my full potential as an alicorn. Do not be alarmed by my incandescent appearance. Despite all the changes, the same pony still rules and guards you. I simply ask you to place your devotion and trust in me as you always have, as we step forth to a brighter tomorrow.\n\n"In my new form, I shall be called Daybreaker. Equestria too shall change, to become a stronger and more secure society, bereft of strife and weakness. Now, the Solar Empire will rise from the ashes of old like a brilliant Phoenix. As its Empress, I swear to guide the nation with a firm and determined hoof, and vanquish all those who stand in the way of harmony. We have been tested, but we have emerged stronger. We move forward as one people: the Imperial citizens of the Solar Empire. Together, we shall prevail!"\n\nSome years ago, every pony in the crowd would have been mortified by the speech. But now, hundreds of them stomped their hooves and cheered. Daybreaker's shining eyes saw those who did not."

Daybreaker cackles triumphantly and says she should've done this a thousand years ago instead of banishing her to the moon. barely conscious NM looks up at her in a state of emotional turmoil and screams "I HATE YOU" which is an epic reference to star wars episode 3 the revenge of the sith (available on blu-ray).

 solarempiresparkles.9.d:0 "TODO In the laboratory, an array of focusing crystals have been arranged to shoot into a single point. They fire a blast of magical energy that creates a glowing sphere. TS is then lowered into it, immersing her in raw magic against her will. Inside the sphere, she absorbs the magic and transforms, and as the sphere dissipates Midnight Sparkle appears. Daybreaker cackles and approaches her, asking how it feels like to have so much power. Midnight chuckles and looks her in the eyes, saying that before Nightmare Moon's return this might have worked, but since then Twilight has learned that true magic comes from honesty, kindness, generosity, loyalty and laughter. An angered Daybreaker laughs and blasts her with fire, but Midnight easily deflects it, then expels her excess magical energy in a blast aimed at the ceiling, creating a hole and knocking Daybreaker back. Twilight, having transformed back to normal then flies away. Daybreaker is left seething in the destroyed laboratory."

They come to a land of millions, a wealthy and prosperous nation, and they will learn what a mistake they made when they underestimated us. \n\nTraitors, Changelings, Yaks, Griffons, Minotaurs, it matters not. If they dare to threaten us I will crush them, I will break them all and leave them whimpering in fear before me, begging for mercy! I will sweep across the world like a storm of fire, burning all who would hurt my ponies! The very earth will fear my wrath, and Tartarus will bar its gates for fear of me kicking them down!\n\nAnd as those who would challenge me lie broken in the dirt before me, as all they ever knew and loved burns to ashes before their eyes, they will know the price of threatening Equestria."
 # solarempire.45.d_m:0 "Oh my, oh my... My little ponies, what a mess you have made of things. Even after so long, even when I watched over you and provided for you, you still stumble and fail. You're all such good little ponies. You work so hard and try so fervently... and yet everything still turns so bleak.\n\nThere's no shame in admitting you are too weak to manage yourself. There is no shame in failing, as long as you can admit when you can't survive on your own. You weren't meant to be thrown into the world to make your own decisions, surely you can see that. If you were, would we have reached this point? No, we wouldn't, and we are here because you did not listen.\n\nBut don't be afraid my little ponies. You are so weak and so helpless, but I am still here, am I not? Even if I have changed, I am still here to protect you and watch over you, just like how I always have. Luna only ever turned on you when you didn't give her what she didn't deserve, Little Twilight's friendship projects were fads that never could truly last. But I am here, I am always here.\n\nCome to me, my little ponies. I have protected you for a thousand years, and you are smart enough to see that, aren't you? You don't need other princesses or rulers, you don't need the friendship of other ponies or species. You need me, you have only ever needed me. So trust in me, my little ponies, my dear children."
 # solarempire.45.d_g:0 "I am the sun that shines in the sky. I am the life that nurtures your crops. I am the warmth that keeps you from freezing to death. I am the light that guides your path and reveals the things that would hurt you. I drove away the thing that sought to cast the world into eternal night, and for a thousand years I have guided you to prosperity.\n\nDo you imagine that you would have prospered without me? That the Three Tribes on their own could have sealed away Discord? Could you have fought Sombra or Tirek? Could you have brought down Nightmare Moon on your own? Or would you have been broken and subjugated several times over?\n\nYou would not. Equestria exists because of me, YOU exist because of me, and no longer shall I sit silently in obscurity to let lesser ponies take the credit for the nation's prosperity! You have been spoiled for centuries, and now your ruler calls upon you to give her the worship she is due.\n\nBow before me, mortals, for the true queen - nay empress - of these lands will no longer sit in silence. She to whom you owe all will now claim her rightful place as your Empress and your Goddess! Bow before me, let the world tremble at my brilliance, and let all ponies worship their rightful mistress!"

 # solarempire.46.d:0 "Brought before Daybreaker in chains, Twilight Sparkle stood in front of the throne, staring into the floor instead of up at the radiant being seated on the Solar Throne before her. She was utterly silent, and from her half-hidden expression she was ready to remain so for hours if needed. \n\n"My faithful student..." Daybreaker began only to be cut off.\n\n"Don't say that!" Twilight snapped in anger. "You... you're not her."\n\n"I am more than she ever was, my faithful student." Daybreaker replied, descending from her throne. "Tell me... could Celestia keep you safe from the Changelings? Could she stop Tirek? Or Sombra? Tell me, how many ponies suffered because of Celestias, of MY, weakness? How many times did she fail, and what was the price?"\n\n"Shut up!" Twilight screamed, tears running down her face as she tore at the chains, trying to get free.\n\n"No, I will not. Because you are going to listen, and you are going to learn. You cannot help but learn after all, my faithful student, and right now your eagerness to learn will have to trump your pride.""
 # solarempire.46.a:0 "You will listen, and you will learn."

 # solarempire.47.t:0 "The Faltering Student"
 # solarempire.47.d:0 ""A new order is rising in Equestria, Twilight." Daybreaker told the chained pony before her. "Whether you like it or not, countless ponies out there cheer my name and adore me. You have seen it, haven't you? They want me. They fear what I might be, but they adore what I promise, and they will fight for that promise. We've taught them well, haven't we?" Daybreaker asked with a smirk.\n\n"You're telling them lies!" Twilight snapped back at her. "You traded Harmony for Oppression! You cast aside Friendship in favour of Subjugation!"\n\n"Really?" Daybreaker asked. "Tell me, when your friend Pinkie Pie fell into depression, did you not defy her wishes to be left alone because you knew what was the best for her? Have you not humbled Rainbow Dash many times when she forgot her place? Have you not used subterfuge to deal with your enemies, be they dragons, ponies or other creatures, all for the greater good?"\n\n"I sought to get through to them, help them grow as people, not subjugate them!"\n\n"Oh really, but what does that make you currently?" Daybreaker asked, getting in close to Twilight's face and staring her down. "You have seen how ponies cheer my name and how they fall in line under me, praising the strength and the security I give them. What of them, Twilight? Will you fight them as well? Will you stand in the ruins of Manehattan, or Ponyville, or Baltimare? Will you strike down pony after pony whose only crime was believing in me? Will you create orphans out of fillies, destroy loving families and leave countless lovers to weep, all because they did not obey your ideals?""
 # solarempire.47.a:0 "Is that not what you would condemn me for doing?"

 # solarempire.48.t:0 "The Breaking Student"
 # solarempire.48.d:0 ""If you would break me, maybe even seal me in the Sun, what then? When you ascend the throne, or maybe even shove Luna onto it, will you bear that burden? Having thousands whisper silently, when no one else can hear, of how you brought down Tartarus itself upon those who believed in the princess that finally became a queen. It would be called the right thing, of course it would, you will force it to be called so... but you will be hated, more than anyone else... and you wouldn't do it because of your love for your friends, but because you sought to twist the world to your liking."\n\n"I... I..."\n\n"Twilight..." Daybreaker said, her voice turning from imperious to beckoning. "You do not have to do that. You can choose. You can choose to say "enough". You can choose to say to all those who want to harm Equestria that they can try, but that they will suffer the consequences. And yet instead you would start a civil war, a civil war where how many ponies will die? Where how much death and pain will be wrought because you were so arrogantly confident you knew best? And in doing so... How are you different from me, or rather what you think I am?\n\nBut you can choose. You can see what I offer my little ponies and have faith. You can join me, hope to temper my worst excesses and transform what you've learned into a new age, an age you will help me shape, where Equestria will still have peace and prosperity instead of being torn asunder by war and death. Twilight... if you truly believe in what I once taught you, then help me to once again save Equestria from calamity."\n\nTwilight didn't say anything, only staring at the floor as her defiance slowly left her. Though she didn't see it, Daybreaker smirked where she stood, towering over the slowly breaking mare."

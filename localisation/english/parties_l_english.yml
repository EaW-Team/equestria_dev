 alicornrule:0 "Alicorn Rule"
 alicornrule_desc:0 "This monarchical government is ruled by magical alicorn princesses that have lived for thousands of years. Their wisdom is just as old they are, to stand against them would be a great folly. They command endless respect and adoration from their subjects. However, they are not authoritarian and prefer the citizens to govern themselves, only intervening when needed."
 tribal_federation:0 "Tribal Federation"
 tribal_federation_desc:0 "This form of government is composed of numerous traditional kinship groups that are often called tribes. These tribes share power relatively equally and usually elect their leaders. Councils composed of elected or hereditary chieftains are a common feature in this type of polity, with each member tribe being represented. Decisions are made by votes and consensus in a remarkably democratic fashion. Sometimes central government may be weak or nonexistent, meaning it is more accurate to call the nation a tribal confederation instead."
 conservatism:0 "Benevolent Absolutism"
 conservatism_desc:0 "A form of monarchy that is guided by the principles of Harmony, with the monarch being a responsible ruler and guardian. While these monarchies usually have some democratic elements, the monarch is ultimately the one safeguarding the well-being and liberties of their subjects."
 harmonic_constitutionalism:0 "Democratic Monarchism"
 harmonic_constitutionalism_desc:0 "Democratic Monarchism refers to a type of harmony that combines republican and monarchist elements, usually in the form of a constitutional monarchy. The monarch has a reduced role and oversees a democratically elected parliament. It is not usually perfectly balanced: For example, when it leans strongly on republicanism, it becomes a ceremonial monarchy."
 liberalism:0 "Harmonic Republicanism"
 liberalism_desc:0 "Harmonic republicanism has been heavily influenced by the philosophy of Harmony, but is defined by the unshaken belief that true harmony is only possible with democratically elected leaders. It is therefore opposed to monarchies or dictatorships, sometimes even harmonic ones. Compared to mainstream republicans, harmonic republicans are fierce advocates of personal liberty and societal harmony."
 socialism:0 "Social Harmonism"
 socialism_desc:0 "Striving for equality and socialism by gradualist and reformist means, social harmonism condemns violent revolutions and radical changes. The ideology seeks to implement change through existing institutions without upending them completely. For example, social justice is preferably enacted through welfare rather than forced redistribution of wealth. Economically, social harmonism rejects the dichotomy between capitalism and socialism, existing in between the two."
 harmonic_theocracy:0 "Irenic Theocracy"
 harmonic_theocracy_desc:0 "The clergy of this nation guides the populace while allowing democratic institutions to exist under their watchful eye. Religious values are highly regarded and the gods are worshipped faithfully, with there being no separation between faith and state."
 holy_order_h:0 "Chivalric Knightly Order"
 holy_order_h_desc:0 "Knightly orders are guided by a fundamental religious or martial code, with decisions made in reference to the code's doctrine. The state is run by a military order with sacred rituals and customs. The code serves as a guiding light to aid the society in upholding harmonic values."
 harmonic_libertarianism:0 "Harmonic Libertarianism"
 harmonic_libertarianism_desc:0 "Harmonic Libertarianism is a philosophy that upholds liberty as a core principle and seeks to safeguard the rights of individual citizens in accordance to the harmonic ideals. The state governs in cooperation with the people via a democratic form of government."
 harmonic_magocracy:0 "Harmonic Magocracy"
 harmonic_magocracy_desc:0 "Magocracy is the rule of spellcasters, often unicorns, where magical talent is the most valued trait among the people. A peasant who has magical skill can quickly rise to the upper class. In a harmonic magocracy, the rule of the mages is benevolent, and they act as caretakers of the common folk."
 social_banditry:0 "Social Banditry"
 social_banditry_desc:0 "Most bandits across the world are seen as cruel outlaws who deserve death sentences. But some criminals have a more noble cause and can even be considered heroes by the common populace. These social bandits stand against oppression, rob exclusively from the rich and privileged, and redistribute wealth to the poor. While they are breaking the law, their actions are seen as justified by the wider society."
 liberation_front:0 "Liberation Front"
 liberation_front_desc:0 "Often appearing in response to authoritarian or tyrannical regimes, Liberation Fronts are united by one or a few individuals who hold near-absolute power in their desire to see the oppressed freed from those that would abuse them. As a result of this, the finer aspects of governing are pushed aside, usually resulting in a transition to a different form of government once their goals have been achieved."

 marxism:0 "Marksism"
 marxism_desc:0 "Both a theory of history and a worldview, Marksism refers to the strains of Caramel Marks' thought that do not agree with the idea of the vanguard party found in Vanguard Socialism. Mass class struggle and the need for transition to a society based on common ownership of the means of production characterize this ideology. If democracy is present in a Marksist state, it is usually in a diminished form, only allowing other socialist parties or factions to compete. Marksists include a variety of strains, such as council communists and industrial unionists, with a common thread of criticism of anarchism and vanguardism."
 leninism:0 "Vanguard Socialism"
 leninism_desc:0 "Vanguard Socialism seeks to establish a socialist state by a vanguard party leading a revolution, overthrowing the capitalist or feudal ruling class. Once in power, the party rules through a system whereby policies are open for internal debate until a decision has been made. In this form of communism, elections are often still present for party leaders and representatives. The Winter Revolution in Stalliongrad inspired many other communist movements around the world to follow their example."
 stalinism:0 "Revolutionary Dictatorship"
 stalinism_desc:0 "Centralized, authoritarian, and single-party in nature, a state adhering to Revolutionary Dictatorship takes its name from Marks' idea of a dictatorship of the proletariat. Using a highly concentrated or perhaps even autocratic administration, these forms of government see little place for democracy within the party, and none outside it. Rapid industrialization and collectivization, as well as the need for an overwhelmingly strong socialist state to purge any counter-revolutionary elements, are held as vital."
 anti_revisionism:0 "Anti-Revisionism"
 anti_revisionism_desc:0 "A reaction to the many ideologies claiming to be successors to Marksism, Anti-Revisionism advocates retaining key elements of original revolutionary theory. Mainly opposing incorporation of capitalist economic elements into socialist systems, it is hostile to communist states that deviate from orthodox Marksism, claiming them to be "state capitalist" and "social imperialist". This hostility separates them from other Marksist movements."
 anarchist_communism:0 "Anarcho-Communism"
 anarchist_communism_desc:0 "One of the largest strains of anarchism, Anarcho-Communism argues for the immediate abolition of the state. In its place, it desires a society based on voluntary associations, collective ownership, and mutual aid. Denounced by statist socialists as fools destroying organizational power, and by individualist anarchists as no better than the statists, anarcho-communists still cling to the dream of a truly free society. No gods nor masters!"
 primitive_communism:0 "Agrarian Socialism"
 primitive_communism_desc:0 "Agrarian socialism advocates for a peaceful, traditional and rural society, where all property is owned communally by villagers and all important decisions are made by peasants' councils. Forms of agrarian socialism can appear in less developed societies as well."
 oligarchical_collectivism:0 "Oligarchical Collectivism"
 oligarchical_collectivism_desc:0 "Oligarchical collectivism is a political theory developed by the Marelander Socialist Party, otherwise known as MARESOC. It seeks to implement communist ideals by placing the means of production into the hooves of a select group of bureaucrats, who manage them on behalf of the people. This bureaucracy is strictly hierarchical and meritocratic, with little tolerance for deviancy from the Party's ideology. In oligarchical collectivism there is no concept of the past or future, only the present, and all social advances are based purely on commitment to the purity of the Party's orthodoxy. The sole goal and purpose of oligarchical collectivism is power."
 equalism:0 "Equalism"
 equalism_desc:0 "Based on the original ideas of Starlight Glimmer, Equalism seeks to totally overhaul society through massive social engineering projects. While its creator was exposed as a fraud and a hypocrite, a small core of true believers remained, mixing their own ideas with what she had proposed. With an uncompromising commitment to preempting any form of hierarchy, Equalism holds that anything less than full economic, social, and in some cases even biological equality is a betrayal of the revolution. It has drawn criticism from other socialists for its allegedly-cultlike nature, but the Equalists believe that the revolution must be to the utmost or it will inevitably produce a new ruling class. And as Starlight Glimmer said, "Join in our utopia, come out of the dark!"" 
 rozenkampism:0 "Ethno-Socialism"
 rozenkampism_desc:0 "Combining racial or ethnic supremacy with left-wing economics, Ethno-Socialism envisions a glorious society for the members of its chosen group, and immense suffering for the parasites who feed on them. While many other communists would call this "fascism in red," the Ethno-Socialists know that only their people deserve a better life."
 democratic_socialism:0 "Democratic Socialism"
 democratic_socialism_desc:0 "Democratic socialism is a left-wing ideology that seeks to retain democratic institutions, allowing the participation of bourgeois parties in elections, while seeking to abolish private property. It considers capitalism to be incompatible with true liberty and equality."
 syndicalism:0 "Syndicalism"
 syndicalism_desc:0 "Syndicalism is a left-wing ideology that advocates for worker-based local organisation and the advancement of socialism through strikes. Their ultimate goal is to replace the central state with a "federation" of trade unions and other voluntary organisations. It is separate from Marksism and tends to struggle with it for dominance among the left. Where Marksism tends to regard a strong state as necessary to advance workers' interests, Syndicalism believes that this is just another form of tyranny, and that any significant change must come about through concerted, direct action by the people themselves."
 socialist_monarchism:0 "Socialist Monarchism"
 socialist_monarchism_desc:0 "Socialist Monarchism is a strange system which blends socialist economics with a hereditary head of state such as an emperor, king or queen. Many more-orthodox Marksists denounce such states as not proper socialists, pointing to the conservative, inegalitarian nature of monarchy and the fact that most of these states arose through reform rather than revolution."
 religious_socialism:0 "Religious Socialism"
 religious_socialism_desc:0 "Theocratic socialism is based on religious values. It sees capitalism as idolatry and sin that goes against the teachings of religious leaders. According to its advocates, the Gods intended for all living beings to be equal and not oppress one another."
 esoteric_socialism:0 "Esoteric Socialism"
 esoteric_socialism_desc:0 "While some socialists have drawn on traditional faith for strength and liberation, in rare cases a wholly new religion is created from scratch, shocking the old power structures. But also critical to this strain is the pivotal role of the secret society. Separate from all traditional methods of left-wing organization, Esoteric Socialism relies on initiation rituals, bizarre and elaborate procedures, and above all, immense secrecy about their true beliefs and goals, even towards lower-ranked members. Sometimes seen as little more than a cult, the question remains: if socialism is to liberate the workers from their shackles, why not liberate their souls as well?"
 dengism:0 "Market Socialism"
 dengism_desc:0 "Like other variants of socialism, market socialism maintains public or shared ownership but retains a competitive free market system. There can be exceptions to this rule: some private companies may also be allowed to exist as long as the majority of businesses remain collectively owned, and there can be a degree of economic planning involved. Profits either go to the state or are distributed to employees or the population in general."
 juche:0 "Great Leader Theory"
 juche_desc:0 "Great Leader Theory is the belief that the masses cannot self-regulate, but rather must be guided by a 'Great Leader' who is the mastermind of the working class. The Great Leader is without flaw and never commits mistakes, is always benevolent and always rules for the masses. The Great Leader protects the working class from foreign imperialists and reactionaries by keeping the nation totally self-sufficient. The masses in turn must love, protect and follow the Great Leader without hesitation."
 technosocialism:0 "Futurist Socialism"
 technosocialism_desc:0 "Many socialists have written about the civilizational transformation that would occur for all creatures upon reaching true post-scarcity communism. To the regimes categorized as Futurist Socialism, that transformation is not something to wait for, but something to begin work on right now. Blending technocracy, communism, beautiful dreams of the future, and social engineering, these socialists tend to take an even more revolutionary line on culture than others of their ilk."

 nazism:0 "Autocracy"
 nazism_desc:0 "In an autocracy, a single individual (often a monarch) holds absolute power. An autocratic state often goes great lengths to ensure that dissident and seditious ideas are suppressed. The autocrats usually seek to increase their personal power and wealth by pursuing a policy of expansionism."
 falangism:0 "Authoritarian Theocracy"
 falangism_desc:0 "With the head of state being a member of the clergy or a proclaimed god, authoritarian theocracy uses faith to unite the nation, with the word of the leader becoming law."
 fascism_ideology:0 "Fascism"
 fascism_ideology_desc:0 "Originating in Wingbardy, fascism typically venerates devotion to the state and uniting the people under a strong leader. It is fiercely nationalistic, militaristic and expansionistic. Economically, it usually favours corporatism and state interventionism."
 rexism:0 "Reactionarism"
 rexism_desc:0 "Reactionarism arose as a radical response to revolutionary and progressive movements. It espouses using any means possible to maintain the traditional status quo of society, including violence. Reactionaries usually seek to empower the clergy and the monarchy, while vehemently opposing any forms of democracy or socialism."
 bandit:0 "Kleptocracy"
 bandit_desc:0 "Kleptocracy is the rule of thieves, where corrupt leaders use their power to exploit their citizens and the natural resources of their nation, all to extend their personal wealth, might and reputation. Usually appears in failed states whose economies are based entirely on robbery, looting and plundering."
 magocracy:0 "Tyrannical Magocracy"
 magocracy_desc:0 "Magocracy is the rule of spellcasters, often unicorns, where magical talent is the most valued asset. A peasant with magical skill can quickly rise to the upper class, while those of lesser talent are consigned to serve their superiors. In a tyrannical magocracy, mighty sorcerers lead the government, and the nation's people are considered of secondary importance to the advancement of magical research."
 plutocracy:0 "Plutocracy"
 plutocracy_desc:0 "Plutocracy, or rule by the wealthy, is rarely codified into an ideology as such. While the former governing institutions of this country (be they hereditary succession, democratic election, or some other means) may remain, they have been thoroughly co-opted to ensure that the wealthiest ruling class of society retain all of the real power."
 reformisten:0 "Reformisten" #Needs to be a separate subideology for the unique subideology icon
 reformisten_desc:0 "The Reformisten ideology is a recent worldview born in the Griffonian Frontier. While its exact tenets, philosophy and mythology are very much in flux and highly dependent on individual leaders, their unifying belief is a fanatical exaltation of some form of griffon identity, a complete hostility to the presence of independent pony nations on the Griffonian continent, and the need to achieve their vision through brutal military means."
 kratokracy:0 "Kratocracy"
 kratokracy_desc:0 "In a kratocracy, might makes right. Laws and rules mean little to those who believe that all political power ultimately comes from coercion and threat of violence. Aside from physical force, rule is maintained through subterfuge and manipulation, which can help keep rivals and the general populace in check. Strength is pursued above all else, while the weak are freely subjugated and exploited."
 stratocracy:0 "Stratocracy"
 stratocracy_desc:0 "Stratocracy covers military juntas, military republics, and military dictatorships. While the armed forces may not be officially in charge, they have the final say and legitimize themselves as maintainers of political stability. If elections are held, the military has to approve the results. Peace is viewed as a sign of weakness, and warfare is a glorious affair citizens should be proud to take part in."
 ultranationalism:0 "Ultranationalism"
 ultranationalism_desc:0 "Ultranationalism upholds the nation as the ultimate good, taking nationalism to the extreme. Unlike fascism, it is not necessarily authoritarian, as the idea of the nation is above everything, even the leader of the state or the gods themselves. Ultranationalists see their own nation as superior to all others, regarding foreigners with disdain."
 corporatocracy:0 "Corporatocracy"
 corporatocracy_desc:0 "In corporatocracy, the state is an extension of industry and big business. Laws are enacted to protect monopolies and punish strikes, and any regulatory ministries function as rubber-stamp agencies. Bankruptcy may be replaced by debt slavery, and any crimes against the corporations are punished swiftly and harshly."
 maarite_minion:0 "Maar Worship"
 maarite_minion_desc:0 "Maar, the griffon god of murder, cruelty, and evil, is very rarely worshipped. In this state, however, worship of the dark god is mandatory. Occultism, blood sacrifice, necromancy, and even demonology are glorious affairs. Orthodoxy is heresy. Death is life. Evil is good."
 undead_horde:0 "Necrocracy"
 undead_horde_desc:0 "In necrocracies, the dead rule. Ghouls and other sapient undead comprise the bulk of the citizens, with mindless zombie and skeleton armies. The few living citizens are necromancers, and most of them eventually embrace undeath. The rulers of a necrocracy are mighty liches and vampire lords and ladies."
 national_communism:0 "National Communism"
 national_communism_desc:0 "An unusual ideology claiming to be a variant of communism, national communism is radically expansionist, totalitarian, and establishes a personality cult. The leader of the nation is all-powerful and all-good, and the state exists to aid the leader in his or her wonderful goals. The nation has an obligation to liberate all other peoples of the world from the shackles of capitalism, and there is no higher service than to die for the nation and the leader."
 holy_order_f:0 "Zealous Knightly Order"
 holy_order_f_desc:0 "Knightly orders are guided by a fundamental religious or martial code, with decisions made in reference to the code's doctrine. The state is run by a military order with sacred rituals and customs. The most extreme measures are taken in the pursuit of the code, and insufficiently devoted members are ruthlessly purged."
 neofeudalism:0 "Neo-Feudalism"
 neofeudalism_desc:0 "Feudalism was once a common political system in many kingdoms, but it has been largely abandoned as society has progressed into the industrial age. Neo-feudalism demands a radical return to traditional hierarchies, with nobles owning all land in the nation, and the peasants bound to the land in turn. Factory workers fare no better, being bound to the factories they work at. Peasants and urban workers have barely any rights, being only just above slaves, and can be ordered to work or be conscripted as the nobility desires. Neo-feudalism accepts elements of modern society such as factories and science as useful, but refuses to let them erode the old hierarchies it deems necessary."
 esotericism:0 "Esotericism"
 esotericism_desc:0 "Though most authoritarian governments seek power largely for its own sake, the same cannot not be said for Esoteric Authoritarians. This ideology is not a specific political movement; rather it categorizes governments which organize their country like a nation-wide cult. They devote total loyalty to a set of mystical and perhaps insane ideals so radical that it is difficult to imagine one coming to power in the first place."
 celestial_cult:0 "Celestial Cult"
 celestial_cult_desc:0 "For millennia, the immortal alicorns ruled over Equestria. Through their magic powers and wisdom gained from uncountable experiences and years of life, they secured harmony for Equestria, and let the little ponies live out their lives, freely and without care for the dangers in the world. However, as this has continued, so has Equestria's dependence on the princesses. With their disappearance, Equestria has been left rudderless. But some still believe. Some still believe that they are still around, and they will return, one day, and lead Equestria boldly onwards. All of these rumours, theories, hypotheses and delusions has come to rest upon the newest Princess of Equestria and now the Celestial Regent, Twilight Sparkle.\n\nThe corpse of what was once the Home of Ponykind, the birthplace of the Magic of Friendship, held together by fear, nostalgia and a virulent hatred for all perceived enemies of Celestia and her little ponies, the sole goal of the Celestial Cult is to hasten the return of the alicorns to Equestria. To this end, the Regent and her supporters believe in mobilizing all the resources of Equestria towards hastening her return, hoping that she will return when the Regent and her ponies have learned enough friendship lessons and proven that they are worthy of her grace.\n\nOrders have been given to systematically cleanse all opposition to their vision of Equestria in general and Celestia in particular, enforced friendship amongst everyone and the construction of grand monuments to 'friendship', 'harmony' or Celestia. Their system of surveillance and of extreme punishment is inspired, some would even dare say copied from a fringe group in New Mareland, and the submission of the ponies from the worst of literature.\n\nYet, it is unclear how it can perpetuate itself. For every day that goes without Celesta returning, the cult, its supporters and even the Regent herself grows more desperate. Soon, they fear, there will not be an Equestria for Celestia to return to."
 surveillance_state:0 "Surveillance State"
 surveillance_state_desc:0 "While nearly all supremacist regimes monitor their populations, surveillance states take this to new heights. They strive to map and catalogue every personal relation, every business transaction, and eventually every thought of their subjects to maximize efficiency and preempt threats. The paranoia of the leaders quickly filter down into every stratum of society, as anyone could be an informer. But is it paranoia if they really are watching you?"
 destructive_force:0 "Destructive Force"
 destructive_force_desc:0 "While many governments can be said to lead their citizens, this government, if you could call it such, is more akin to a force of destruction bent on annihilating its neighbors and possibly itself as well. Diplomacy and other common political actions are so alien to this "nation" that one must wonder if the creature or entity leading it is even capable of reason to begin with."
 
 despotism:0 "Despotism"
 despotism_desc:0 "Despotism is an ancient form of government in which a single person, usually a hereditary monarch, rules with absolute power. However, the ruler's policies are moderate and conservative as they seek to maintain the status quo."
 oligarchism:0 "Oligarchy"
 oligarchism_desc:0 "Oligarchy is a form of government in which power is shared between a small group of privileged individuals, such as aristocrats, merchants or chiefs. They are interested in little else besides maintaining their power and prestige."
 centrism:0 "Centrism"
 centrism_desc:1 "Centrists avoid political extremes both on the left and right, promoting moderate and pragmatic reforms which seek to find the middle ground. While often found in republics, centrists also appear in constitutional monarchies."
 anarchism:0 "Anarchism"
 anarchism_desc:0 "While many anarchists hold to anarcho-communism, by no means all do. From individualists to mutualists, this loosely organized group firmly rejects the forced collectivization of property, while still desiring the abolition of the state and of hierarchical power structures."
 technocracy:0 "Technocracy"
 technocracy_desc:0 "Technocracy is a system of governance in which decision-makers are selected on the basis of their expertise, particularly with regard to scientific or technical knowledge. Although it contrasts with democracy, it does not necessarily imply eliminating elected representatives, but leaders are judged on their expertise rather than political affiliation. A technocratic government tries to use the scientific method to solve social problems and uses logical calculus to find the most rational solution to any given problem based on the information available."
 libertarianism:0 "Libertarianism"
 libertarianism_desc:0 "Libertarianism as an ideology advocates liberty above all else. They usually oppose state authority and restrictions on freedom. Capitalist libertarianism, in contrast to socialist libertarianism, supports the free market and defends private property rights. Libertarianism's tolerance of the state ranges from anarchism to minarchism, usually opposing any government welfare or interventionism."
 tribal_council:0 "Tribal Chiefdom"
 tribal_council_desc:0 "This form of government is composed of numerous traditional kinship groups that are often called tribes. These tribes are subservient to one or more powerful paramount chiefs who are either elected or hereditary rulers. These chieftains seldom have absolute power and may have to share it with a council of tribal representatives. While a central government may exist, it is usually weak and rules its subjects indirectly."
 republicanism:0 "Republicanism" #We needed a generic Neutrality Republic sub-ideology
 republicanism_desc:0 "Republicanism encompasses a wide range of ideologies that claim that the people, not the king or queen, are sovereign. Republicanism holds the only legitimate government is one chosen by the people, and is fiercely opposed to monarchy and feudalism. Republican government is built around political parties, with checks and balances in place to prevent excessive radicalism."
 populism:0 "Populism"
 populism_desc:0 "Populism broadly refers to ideals that praise the people and criticize the elite. Both left-populism and right-populism exist, differing primarily on economic policy. Most populist governments have at least some support for the lower class, and failings are generally attributed to the sabotage of an 'other' or an 'elite'."
 holy_order_n:0 "Knightly Order"
 holy_order_n_desc:0 "Knightly orders are guided by a fundamental religious or martial code, with decisions made in reference to the code's doctrine. The state is run by a military order with sacred rituals and customs. Measures are calm and temperate, and change is approached gradually."
 theocracy_subideology:0 "Theocracy"
 theocracy_subideology_desc:0 "In a theocracy, priests or shamans lead the nation, attempting to preserve their traditions in a changing world. Their policies are moderate, as they believe the only way to maintain the faith is to avoid drastic change. Depending on the specific theocracy, there may be a figurehead secular leader (often a monarch), but all real power lies in the clergy."
 conservative_liberalism:0 "Conservative Liberalism"
 conservative_liberalism_desc:0 "Conservative liberalism is a combination of liberal values and policies, such as a strong constitutional government and equality before the law, with conservative stances on social and ethical issues."
 khakistocracy:0 "Military Government"
 khakistocracy_desc:0 "This polity is ruled by an authoritarian government where political power is concentrated in the armed forces, and where the country is usually led by a dictator who exercises total control over the military, or by a dictatorate of top generals or admirals — a military junta. Such polities are often described as being an "army with a state". A state formerly under civilian rule might first take on such characteristics after a military coup, before transitioning into a fully fledged stratocracy."

While they are breaking the law, their actions are seen as justified by the wider society."

 marxism:0 "Marksism"
 marxism_desc:0 "Marksist politics seek to apply the theories of Caramel Marks to political practice. Class struggle and the need for transition to a society based on common ownership of the means of production characterize these ideologies. A society under Marksism claims to fight against capitalist exploitation of the working class, usually via a centrally planned economy. If democracy is present in a Marksist state, it is usually in a diminished form, only allowing other socialist parties or factions to compete."

 leninism_desc:0 "Equestrian Socialism seeks to establish a socialist state by a vanguard party leading a revolution, overthrowing an capitalist society. Once in power, the party rules through a system whereby policies are open for internal debate until a decision has been made.

 oligarchical_collectivism_desc:0 "Oligarchical collectivism is a political theory developed by the Marelander Socialist Party, otherwise known as MARESOC. It seeks to implement communist ideals by placing the means of production into the hooves of a select group of bureaucrats, who manage them on behalf of the people. This bureaucracy is strictly hierarchical and meritocratic, with little tolerance for deviancy from the Party's ideology. In oligarchical collectivism there is no concept of the past or future, only the present, and all social advances are based purely on commitment to the purity of the Party's orthodoxy. The sole goal and purpose of oligarchical collectivism is power."

 syndicalism:0 "Syndicalism"
 syndicalism_desc:0 "Syndicalism is a left-wing ideology that advocates for worker-based local organisation and the advancement of socialism through strikes. Their ultimate goal is to replace the central state with a "federation" of trade unions and other voluntary organisations. It is separate from Marksism and tends to struggle with it for dominance among the left. Where Marksism tends to regard a strong state as necessary to advance workers' interests, Syndicalism believes that this is just another form of tyranny, and that any significant change must come about through concerted, direct action by the people themselves."
 socialist_monarchism:0 "Socialist Monarchism"
 socialist_monarchism_desc:0 "Socialist Monarchism is a strange system which blends socialist economics with a hereditary head of state such as an emperor, king or queen.

Its detractors call it a blatant form of state capitalism that can hardly be considered true socialism."

 plutocracy:0 "Plutocracy"
 plutocracy_desc:0 "Plutocracy, or rule by the wealthy, is rarely codified into an ideology as such. While the former governing institutions of this country (be they hereditary succession, democratic election, or some other means) may remain, they have been thoroughly co-opted to ensure that the wealthiest ruling class of society retain all of the real power."
 reformisten:0 "Reformisten" #Needs to be a separate subideology for the unique subideology icon
 reformisten_desc:0 "The Reformisten ideology is a recent worldview born in the Griffonian Frontier. While its exact tenets, philosophy and mythology are very much in flux and highly dependent on individual leaders, their unifying belief is a fanatical exaltation of some form of griffon identity, a complete hostility to the presence of independent pony nations on the Griffonian continent, and the need to achieve their vision through brutal military means."

 neofeudalism:0 "Neo-Feudalism"
 neofeudalism_desc:0 "Feudalism was once a common political system in many kingdoms, but it has been largely abandoned as society has progressed into the industrial age. Neo-feudalism demands a radical return to traditional hierarchies, with nobles owning all land in the nation, and the peasants bound to the land in turn. Factory workers fare no better, being bound to the factories they work at. Peasants and urban workers have barely any rights, being only just above slaves, and can be ordered to work or be conscripted as the nobility desires. Neo-feudalism accepts elements of modern society such as factories and science as useful, but refuses to let them erode the old hierarchies it deems necessary."
 esotericism:0 "Esotericism"
 esotericism_desc:0 "Though most authoritarian governments seek power largely for its own sake, the same cannot not be said for Esoteric Authoritarians. This ideology is not a specific political movement; rather it categorizes governments which organize their country like a nation-wide cult. They devote total loyalty to a set of mystical and perhaps insane ideals so radical that it is difficult to imagine one coming to power in the first place."
 celestial_cult:0 "Celestial Cult"
 celestial_cult_desc:0 "For millennia, the immortal alicorns ruled over Equestria. Through their magic powers and wisdom gained from uncountable experiences and years of life, they secured harmony for Equestria, and let the little ponies live out their lives, freely and without care for the dangers in the world. However, as this has continued, so has Equestria's dependence on the princesses. With their disappearance, Equestria has been left rudderless. But some still believe. Some still believe that they are still around, and they will return, one day, and lead Equestria boldly onwards. All of these rumours, theories, hypotheses and delusions has come to rest upon the newest Princess of Equestria and now the Celestial Regent, Twilight Sparkle.\n\nThe corpse of what was once the Home of Ponykind, the birthplace of the Magic of Friendship, held together by fear, nostalgia and a virulent hatred for all perceived enemies of Celestia and her little ponies, the sole goal of the Celestial Cult is to hasten the return of the alicorns to Equestria. To this end, the Regent and her supporters believe in mobilizing all the resources of Equestria towards hastening her return, hoping that she will return when the Regent and her ponies have learned enough friendship lessons and proven that they are worthy of her grace.\n\nOrders have been given to systematically cleanse all opposition to their vision of Equestria in general and Celestia in particular, enforced friendship amongst everyone and the construction of grand monuments to 'friendship', 'harmony' or Celestia. Their system of surveillance and of extreme punishment is inspired, some would even dare say copied from a fringe group in New Mareland, and the submission of the ponies from the worst of literature.\n\nYet, it is unclear how it can perpetuate itself. For every day that goes without Celesta returning, the cult, its supporters and even the Regent herself grows more desperate. Soon, they fear, there will not be an Equestria for Celestia to return to."
 surveillance_state:0 "Surveillance State"
 surveillance_state_desc:0 "While nearly all supremacist regimes monitor their populations, surveillance states take this to new heights. They strive to map and catalogue every personal relation, every business transaction, and eventually every thought of their subjects to maximize efficiency and preempt threats.

 technocracy:0 "Technocracy"
 technocracy_desc:0 "Technocracy is a system of governance in which decision-makers are selected on the basis of their expertise, particularly with regard to scientific or technical knowledge. Although it contrasts with democracy, it does not necessarily imply eliminating elected representatives, but leaders are judged on their expertise rather than political affiliation. A technocratic government tries to use the scientific method to solve social problems and uses logical calculus to find the most rational solution to any given problem based on the information available."
 libertarianism:0 "Libertarianism"
 libertarianism_desc:0 "Libertarianism as an ideology advocates liberty above all else. They usually oppose state authority and restrictions on freedom.

 theocracy_subideology_desc:0 "In a theocracy, priests or shamans lead the nation, attempting to preserve their traditions in a changing world. Their policies are moderate, as they believe the only way to maintain the faith is to avoid drastic change.

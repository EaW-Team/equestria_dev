ZUG_territorial_army:0 "Ugabi Central Territorial Army"
ZUG_territorial_army_desc:0 "The UCTA was created in 990 to liberate Ugabi from Mazwi vassalage by Nnabakyala Mukisa. Zebras were sent to Saddle Arabian military academies while foreign arms were purchased for the modern regiments. Yet, it was all for naught as the Storm King razed Mazwi, shattering the large realm and freeing Ugabi. This left the new army without a purpose yet a powerful position in the free nation, enough to rival the monarchy itself. Over the years, the UCTA has only grown in influence, directly taking control of the economy in key areas and only paying lipservice to the ruler."

ZUG_gulu_tablet:0 "The Gulu Tablet Convention"
ZUG_gulu_tablet_desc:0 "In 1001, Nnabakyala Mukisa signed the Gulu Tablet that ended slavery in Ugabi lands to secure support of an abolitionist coalition to counter the army's growing influence. Over the years, however, the original abolitionist coalition has grown into a broad alliance for further reforms. More alarmingly, many of its leaders are also chieftains of influential eastern tribes and this has given the movement legitimacy, even amongst the traditional elite."

ZUG_golden_fields:0 "Golden Fields"
ZUG_golden_fields_desc:0 "The wealth of Ugabi lay in its fertile fields. For centuries, food and various cash crops have been the base of the Ugabian economy, and continue to be to this day."

ZUG_sky_celebration:0 "End the Celebration"
ZUG_sky_celebration_desc:0 "The year's celebration festival is drawing to a close. The ancestral spirits have been appeased and the Sky God honoured, it is time for Ugabi to reenter its usual routine. Across the nation, Nnabakyala Mukia's subjects crowds the villages with baited breath for her heralds, while the capital awaits her arrival with bated breath."

ZUG_address_fears:0 "The Fear of the New"
ZUG_address_fears_desc:0 "It's a hard truth to swallow, but it's undeniable that Ugabi has, and remains far behind its northern and western neighbours, largely due to the population's aversion to change. Even small innovations, brought to Ugabi have raised fears from the citizenry, with Mukisa finding herself hardpressed to address their concerns."

ZUG_modern_innovations:0 "The Wonder Tools"
ZUG_modern_innovations_desc:0 "Internal combustion, motorized vehicles and the like are nothing new to the Ugabi population. However, recent developments have turned what was once used only martially, into a critical asset for the civilians, in the form of a tractor in the fields. Spurred by the success of this new tool, Mukisa wishes to acquire more, gifting them to her people at her wallets expense."

ZUG_western_railroad:0 "The Western Railroad"
ZUG_western_railroad_desc:0 "The Kamarela-Ruguzu railroad, a dream project of Mukisa's late father, is now nothing but rusted iron and broken foundations after being razed during the Storm King's invasion. Mukisa had always wanted to rebuild it, but this cannot be done with the UCTA's control of the western regions. Yet, even if she could do that, what would stop the military from seizing control of it if she does not maintain order?"

ZUG_eastern_fields:0 "The Eastern Marshes"
ZUG_eastern_fields_desc:0 "Most of the land in Karagaweze is comprised of wet, marshy, useless soil. Plans to drain the marshes and create farms have been planned for decades, yet none have come to fruition, making the population lose faith, driving them to support the seemingly more effective Gulu clique. It is time to show them how wrong they are."

ZUG_industrious_subjects:0 "Celebrate The Great Patriots"
ZUG_industrious_subjects_desc:0 "While there are many in the world who view Ugabi as a backwater, an undeveloped nation still stuck in the dark ages, there are many who work hard to improve these lands. The forward-thinking, industrious patriots should be remembered, their work celebrated."

ZUG_farmers_to_workers:0 "Protect the Workers"
ZUG_farmers_to_workers_desc:0 "The Gulu clique's promises of workers rights and fair rents, laws that protect zebras from abuse by their landlords have for a long time won them great favour in the eyes of the population. While these demands are fair and just, these so-called reformers only use these as excuses and lies built to destabilize the country. It is time to defang these dissidents by offering our working people the protection they desire."

ZUG_enflame_western_unrest:0 "Spread Whispers in the West"
ZUG_enflame_western_unrest_desc:0 "There are whispers of a reckoning in the west, the commoners whisper how the UCTA butchers will meet their end by summer, the soldiers whisper amongst each other that Mukisa will exact vengeance on them unless they kneel, and priests whisper in silent about how God shall see order restored. Whispers mean a lot when they reach the right ears, and some UCTA commanders may not be so bold any longer."

ZUG_discredit_clique:0 "Discredit the Clique"
ZUG_discredit_clique_desc:0 "The clique claims to be acting on behalf of the common zebra, to be goodhearted reformers seeking to save our people from their oppressors. In truth, these are all lies. The Gulu clique is an organization of megalomaniacs who will stop at nothing to get the power they seek, just like the UCTA. Mukisa shall let her subjects know the truth, letting her people decide for themselves the facts."

ZUG_sway_key_reformers:0 "New Friends, New Futures."
ZUG_sway_key_reformers_desc:0 "A letter arrived in the night, the messenger tired, his clothes ragged. He brings a requst for a secret meeting with a group of reformers who wish to treat with her in good faith. An opportunity she gladly accepts."

ZUG_entice_traders:0 "Entice the Traders"
ZUG_entice_traders_desc:0 "The desolation brought by the Storm King has left trade routes broken, caravans scattered. Yet a slow recovery has seen the trade networks re-open, linking Ugabi to the world at large. While it has filled the coffers of Ugabi, it has also introduced dangerous foreign ideas to our people. To counter this, Mukisa shall seek to align the traders to her reign with monopoly rights and lucrative tarrif exemptions."

ZUG_court_parlays:0 "The Court of Nnabakyala"
ZUG_court_parlays_desc:0 "As part of her daily duties, Mukisa holds court in her royal palace. One part of this a public forum where any subject can appeal to her for justice or seek wisdom.

ZUG_hear_merchants:0 "Hear the Merchants"
ZUG_hear_merchants_desc:0 "A group of merchants has recently appealed to the throne for an amend to an edict concerning foreign trade. Mukisa shall listen to what they'll have to say and pass her judgement."

ZUG_modern_friends:0 "To A New Friendship!"
ZUG_modern_friends_desc:0 "Even if part of the traditional elite, Mukisa can feel where the wind is blowing; the ascendance of merchants who are learned in modern arts has created a new powerbase without ancient lineages. An asset that would be most useful in the future."

ZUG_listen_nobles:0 "Host the Nobles"
ZUG_listen_nobles_desc:0 "Part of Mukisa's duties is to host lavish parties for the nobles to showcase her wealth and power. One such party has been planned, and Mukisa intends for this one to be especially grand."

ZUG_traditional_allies:0 "To A Continued Alliance!"
ZUG_traditional_allies_desc:0 "As the old proverb goes, one should not play with fire. The ancient tribes and capital nobility are an established powerbase and it would be foolish to risk their ire. Instead, Mukisa will ensure their loyalty and friendship to secure her plans."

ZUG_royal_authority:0 "Power of the Nnabakyala"
ZUG_royal_authority_desc:0 "Ugabi might be an union of many tribes but there is only one Nnabakyala — and her name is Mukisa."

ZUG_charitable_leader:0 "One Who Cares for All"
ZUG_charitable_leader_desc:0 "The Nnabakyala have always cared for their subjects but has there ever been such a charitable leader lie Mukisa? Her wealth has seen the poor fed, roads constructed and the fields expand across the land. Her wealth is Ugabi's wealth, one and the same."

ZUG_liberation_icon:0 "One Who Led the Liberation"
ZUG_liberation_icon_desc:0 "Ugabi would never have been freed without the work of the venerated Mukisa. It was she who created the armed forces who pushed the invaders out. It was she who freed the slaves from their chains. Without her, there would be no Ugbai today and she will let her subjects know this."

ZUG_ancestral_guidance:0 "One With the Ancestors"
ZUG_ancestral_guidance_desc:0 "As it was and shall be, the Nnabakyala acts as the link between the living and the dead. Her person unites the present, past and the future into one being. Who would dare to question such a vessel of wisdom?"

ZUG_repay_loyalty_desc:0 "TODO"

ZUG_royal_estates:0 "Loyal Subjects"
ZUG_royal_estates_desc:0 "Much land across Ugabi belongs to the throne and most are occupied by local farming communities.

ZUG_visible_monarchy:0 "Modern Approach"
ZUG_visible_monarchy_desc:0 "Mukisa has seen fit to become more approachable to her subjects all across Ugabi. While for years she has held festivals in the capital that have been commemorated by heralds in her name, she now wishes to speak to the directly with the help of modern technology."

ZUG_popular_sovereign_desc:0 "No ruler cannot rule if their subjects oppose them.

While they may retain their positions, the throne will become closer to its subjects and earn their unquestioning devotion."

ZUG_damned_traitors:0 "Damnation to the Traitor"
ZUG_damned_traitors_desc:0 "TODO"

ZUG_divine_agents:0 "Loyal Priesthood"
ZUG_divine_agents_desc:0 "Of all the factions in Ugabi, the priests of the Sky and various other religious officials remain staunchly loyal to Mukisa and the institution she stands for. Some have already taken the initiative to wield their influence over the masses by preaching loyalty to their Nnabakyala and how one must be ready to even cast aside their chieftains if they are to oppose her rule. Such forward thinking must be repaid."

ZUG_watchful_spirits:0 "Watchful Spirits"
ZUG_watchful_spirits_desc:0 "Us mortals cannot escape attention of our forebears even after their depature. They watch and protect us. Yet they also punish the wicked and cruel. To betray the Nnabakyala is a crime against the Sky himself and the traitor's soul is cast aside by the winds upon death, never to exist again. Who would risk such damnation?"

ZUG_blessed_dynasty:0 "Blessed By the God"
ZUG_blessed_dynasty_desc:0 "It is clear that the Sky favours Nnabakyala Mukisa. Her dynasty has ruled Ugabi since time immemorial, surviving while other rulers and tribes  have been vanquished. Now, she stands above all as a divinely ordained ruler, one who speaks with voice of countless ancestors and is connected to the God himself. To serve her is a privilege and every devout subject stands ready to fulfill her commands."

ZUG_absolutism:0 "My Name is Mukisa"
ZUG_absolutism_desc:0 "Ugabi is nothing without its ruler, and that ruler is Mukisa. Anyone who dares to oppose her rule is nothing but a filthy traitor in defiance of God who should be opposed at all costs.

ZUG_plan_tour:0 "Announce the Royal Tour"
ZUG_plan_tour_desc:0 "Amidst the great stir over the upcoming Summer Summit, Mukisa has also declared her intention to tour the land and visit the local chieftains.

ZUG_invite_into_royal_guard_desc:0 "The royal Horn Guardians are the traditional household soldiers of the Nnabakyala, meant to protect both the royal family and the Golden Horn.

ZUG_expand_traditional_rights:0 "Promise Tribal Rights and Lands"
ZUG_expand_traditional_rights_desc:0 "As a show of good faith and benevolence, Mukisa shall expand the traditional rights given to the tribes and dole out royal land grants to them. This will be combined with special tribe assignments as well. Though, beyond the veil however, most of these rewards will be rather superficial, dealing only in specific local matters, and the lands are mostly backwater territories currently unused."

ZUG_commemorate_liberation:0 "Commemorate Liberation "
ZUG_commemorate_liberation_desc:0 "Ugabi is a free realm and answers to no foreigners will. But, this freedom if we are honest was not won in glory: the original invasion by the Storm King shed the blood of the Mazwi while leaving us safe, so when the Storm King continued his war it was easy to defeat the scant garrisons of the Mazwi. This truth, however, would do little good for the people and a beautiful lie serves a better purpose, does it not?"

ZUG_sudden_visit:0 "At the Barracks"
ZUG_sudden_visit_desc:0 "The Ugabi Central Territorial Army might be united by their belief of superioirity they are, in reality, fractured into multiple power groups, each ruled by a powerful officer.

ZUG_secure_arms:0 "Tactics and Gunpowder"
ZUG_secure_arms_desc:0 "Courage and will alone will not win battles. Modern warfare has no room for the old ways. Something that the accursed UCTA has proven time and again. But a question remains; why let them have the monopoly to this power?"

ZUG_eastern_spies:0 "Pay Attention to the East"
ZUG_eastern_spies_desc:0 "It is important to not ignore the Gulu Clique's military assets either. Rumours speak of hidden arms caches in the swamps that are ready to be wielded by an army of revolutionaries blinded by their own self-righteousness. Even if the truth may be stretched, it would be foolish to not heed them."

ZUG_host_military_officers:0 "Host the Honourable Officers"
ZUG_host_military_officers_desc:0 "A recent announcement has raised quite a few eyebrows across Ugabi. Mukisa has seen fit to hold a banquet at the capital dedicated entirely to honouring the achievements of the UCTA.

ZUG_gulu_knowledge:0 "Consult Gulu Experts"
ZUG_gulu_knowledge_desc:0 "As per her agreement with the Gulu dissenters, Mukisa now stands ready to listen to what their plans for reforming Ugabi. Though not an expert and bit suspicious, the plan for exhaustive reformation of Ugabi through a modernization program does sound very promising."

ZUG_advisor_circle:0 "The Throne's Advisors"

ZUG_automated_operations_desc:0 "TODO while steam-powered machines are nothing new in Ugabi, they are of limited usage in certain industrial sectors due to their size and cost, especially after the downfall of Mazwi.

ZUG_disband_guilds:0 "Decree On Economic Liberalisation"
ZUG_disband_guilds_desc:0 "TODO time has come to once and for all to break ugabi's ties to past. No longer shall the market be controlled by guilds of artisans or merchant cliques.

ZUG_son_msh_war:0 "The Northern Realms"
ZUG_son_msh_war_desc:0 "TODO Mukisa can see that she is not the only one with plans for the Great Lakes. In the north, past the Aorandan fields, the two states of Zar-Hay and Macigena are ruled over by madstallions: one who leading a kingdom with no sovereign and the other claiming the mantle of a prophet. Mukisa therefore orders her troops to prepare for march northwards."

ZUG_warriors_question:0 "The Captured Warriors"
ZUG_warriors_question_desc:0 "TODO Mukisa knows the value of good warriors and the Zar-Hayans are well respected in this regards.

ZUG_disperse_the_flock_desc:0 "TODO while Mukisa has no desire to tell non-Ugabians how to believe in God, the faith spoken by the Prophet is a thrat for the ancient traditions and is inherently aggressive towards how others view God.

ZUG_desert_tribes_alliance:0 "The Hardy Zebharan Tribes"
ZUG_desert_tribes_alliance_desc:0 "TODO Mukisa judges that the desert tribes allied to the Alawi are no threat to her.

ZUG_northern_territories:0 "The Nothern Territories"
ZUG_northern_territories_desc:0 "TODO the city of TImbucktu will act as a regional capital of the north barring the border frontier.

Meanwhile the desert border will be under joint local tribal and military garrison governance."

ZUG_the_last_player:0 "The Last Players"
ZUG_the_last_player_desc:0 "TODO Only one region of the Great Lakes still remains outside Mukisa's hooves.

ZUG_formalize_officer_training_desc:0 "TODO UCTA is starting to run short on formally traine and comissioned officers and at times regular soldiers have had to be promoted on the field to fill the ranks. The Security Council therefore establishes an officer education program where a prospecting cadet goes through a course before being assigned to an experienced officer."

ZUG_lessons_mobile_warfare:0 "Manual On the Procedures of Warfare"
ZUG_lessons_mobile_warfare_desc:0 "TODO Security Council gathers notes and experience in implementing the military doctrine on the battlefield. While it has so far worked, some issues in terms of terminology, procedures, signals, maintenance etc. has come to light.

ZUG_military_priests:0 "Soldier Priests"
ZUG_military_priests_desc:0 "TODO for a while priests have tagged along the Territorials offering guidance, offering sacrifaces and conducting burials to the fallen.

ZUG_restructure_army_hierarchy:0 "Restructure the Territorial Army"
ZUG_restructure_army_hierarchy_desc:0 "The modern nature of war is not made from the top down, it will be the individual heroes of the battlefield, acting with their squads to take hardpoints and hold off the enemy.

ZUG_new_tank_trials_desc:0 "TODO while the trusty DN-TM1 and its improved models have served Ugabi well, the tractor-tanks are showing their age and weakness against heavier weaponry.

ZUG_war_time_production:0 "War-Time Procurements"
ZUG_war_time_production_desc:0 "TODO the recent reforms have occured alongside expansion of the army. Some soldiers march into the battle equipped with ever older rifles and often without proper armour or tools. Not to mention the heavier weaponry, that require time and resources.

ZUG_motorized_convoys_desc:0 "TODO while great amount of supplies are transported with ships in the rivers and with trains in the more developed regions, in the inland areas much of the supplies still need to be transported in zebra-drawn wagons.

ZUG_tank_gun_developments:0 "Standartised Cannon Calibers"
ZUG_tank_gun_developments_desc:0 "TODO due to their improvised origins, the old DN-TM1s never had standartised schematics and models could often differ in appearance and reliability.

ZUG_support_unit_development:0 "The Experts of Battlefield"
ZUG_support_unit_development_desc:0 "TODO unlike in the past, it is no longer enough to simply have more or braver soliders than one's foe. Modern armies require specialized support units with skills that aide the main force in their tasks."

ZUG_cult_warriors:0 "Cult of Warriors"
ZUG_cult_warriors_desc:0 "War is part of Ugabi. It was through war against the wraiths that united Ugabian tribes. All across time an history, Ugabians have fought, bled and died.

ZUG_break_guilds:0 "End of the Guilds"
ZUG_break_guilds_desc:0 "TODO Ugabi's economy has for too long been shackled by the self-serving guilds that stiffle competition and limit market opportunities.

ZUG_war_against_ignorance_desc:0 "TODO the reform-minded members of the clique have long advocated adoption of a formal education system so that every Ugabian has a chance to learn to write and read.

While there are traditions of summits, conclaves and councils, they were often very small and limited to local affairs. Gulu Clique, however, has a vision to see Ugabi embrace common rule and decision making, so everyone has a voice. It will take time but in due time, every Ugabian will know what democracy means."

ZUG_national_summit:0 "The All-Ugabian Summit"
ZUG_national_summit_desc:0 "TODO while the Summer Summit has continued to gather and hold meetings its power basis has no legal basis. Therefore Etteka and his close firends have written a proposal that would transform the summit into a national body compromised of representatives from the tribes, towns and villages. It also mandates set days when the summit holds meetings and how affairs are discussed."

ZUG_class_equality:0 "The Citizenship Act"
ZUG_class_equality_desc:0 "TODO social classes have dominated concept of what it means to be an Ugabian. Some are commoners, some are nobles. Others are tribals while others are urban denizens.

ZUG_modern_warbands:0 "Sound the War Horns"
ZUG_modern_warbands_desc:0 "TODO with end of the Territorial Army, Ugabi's defence is left to the warbands of the greatest tribes. Chieftain Okusaba has especially raised this concern to his colleagues and the Nnabakyala: to defend Ugabi, there needs to be a new army."

ZUG_urban_guard:0 "The Urban Guard"
ZUG_urban_guard_desc:0 "TODO while tribal warbands have formed the ancient core of Ugabi's soldierly and Kamarela's defended by the grim Spirit Warriors, the many towns and cities have equally long tradition of organising militias or guard units meant to fight crime and quell unrest.

ZUG_every_ugabian_warrior:0 "Ugabians, What Is Your Profession?"
ZUG_every_ugabian_warrior_desc:0 "TODO an old saying tells how each Ugabian is born with a spear in hoof and dies with a spear in hoof. Martial traditions have been safeguarded by the tribes and remembered by the urban subjects.

ZUG_kargaweze_alchemists:0 "2nd Kargaweze Alchemist Detachment"
ZUG_kargaweze_alchemists_desc:0 "TODO a rather peculiar formation has gained attention in Kargaweze where the local guard units have integrated alchemist squads into the ranks. These talented zebras aide the soldiers by aiding the wounded and offering various potions to enhance fighting prowess."

ZUG_capture_zwa_desc:0 "TODO Ugabi is not whole. In the past, its northern areas were chopped off by the Mazwi and now the so-called Aoranda is ruled by tyrannical warlords and power-hungry chieftains with the common zebra suffering. The Gulu Clique, the Nnabakyala, the tribes and cities all stand united to save their kin and re-unify Ugabi."

ZUG_enforced_reparations:0 "Repay the Great Sins"
ZUG_enforced_reparations_desc:0 "TODO slavery is a great evil and now it has come to an end in Aoranda. Yet its scars still remain and unless we want the fomer slaves to remain poor, or worse to starve, direct actipns are needed.

After so-called Aoranda's capitulation, he has spent days meeting those notables who fought against the republics vices. Great focus in these talks has been the restoration of peace and order after years of the republic's tyranny.

After so-called Aoranda's capitulation, he has spent days meeting those notables who fought against the republics vices. Strange phenomenon Etteka's observed is how the Nnabakyala is seen as a long-sought liberator. Not one to miss a chance, Etteka quickly has the Nnabakyala make a tour in the new territories and give them a chance to fight for their Nnabakyala."

ZUG_warlord_stockpiles:0 "Tools of the Bandits"

With the downfall of the Mazwi, the Great Lakes are in turmoil and divided, with the ancient vassals and upstarts seeking to carve each other. While many in Ugabi simply seek to defend Ugabi from these threats, others, in particular the Gulu leadership, see a chance to bring light of democracy to the Lakes.

ZUG_ekirombe_control:0 "The Heart of River Network"

ZUG_return_of_azkhai_desc:0 "TODO immediately after we occupied Zar-Hay the occupation authorities were contacted by a mysterious group. They were loyalists of the Zughe Family, the old rulers of Zar-Hay. The lawful heir Azkhai had been hiding from the warlord Zonni and readying to reclaim his throne.

ZUG_buy_guns:0 "The Old Smuggling Routes"
ZUG_buy_guns_desc:0 "In the early days of the UCTA, Ugabi didn't have a single factory capable of producing the weapons we needed. So, we turned to foreign "merchants."

ZUG_ship_artillery:0 "Explosive Ordnances"

ZUG_purchase_planes:0 "Purchase Modern Planes"
ZUG_purchase_planes_desc:0 "As we once did with the equipment that began the UCTA, we must go abroad to find aircraft to start our airforce. We lack the resources and experience to start it ourselves, but hopefully this will be the boost we need to get going."

ZUG_paratroopers_investigation:0 "The Golden Berets"
ZUG_paratroopers_investigation_desc:0 "Created as a formation of the air force, and not the army, the Golden Berets will hopefully become an elite unit to stand out amongst our soldiers. Defending Ugabi from whatever the threat may be, on land or in the skies."

ZUG_army_support_force:0 "Supporting Air Force"
ZUG_army_support_force_desc:0 "Our Air Force must exist to support our army in its operations, what use is bombing enemy cities if our soldiers continue to die on the front lines? There is none. Our ground troops will always have the full support of their brothers above."

ZUG_strike_force:0 "Lead the Attack"
ZUG_strike_force_desc:0 "Our pilots must become experts in the heat of battle, using their guns and bombs to strike at the enemies down bellow them, being the spearhead for God's advance over the world."

ZUG_pilot_courses:0 "Start Pilot Courses"
ZUG_pilot_courses_desc:0 "Training both our pilots and officers in the art of aerial combat is essential to the success of our infant Air Force. All of them must be skilled enough to make up for our industrial deficiencies and lack of experience in these matters."

ZUG_independent_air_force:0 "Independent Air Force"
ZUG_independent_air_force_desc:0 "To strike at the enemy's heart when no one else can, that is the objective of the Air Force. While we can fly above their cities, and rain hell upon the industries of war, they have no response. Their factories, mines, and cities shall fall to our Godly flying corps."

ZUG_foster_initiative:0 "Foster Initiative"
ZUG_foster_initiative_desc:0 "It is the initiative of the pilot that shall ensure an operation succeeds. We give them a target, but then it is up to the officers and crewzeebras to make that goal a reality. Protect the bombers, guide them to their target, and let loose. Make it all work like a well oiled machine."

ZUG_modern_air_wings:0 "Those Zebras In Their Flying Machines"
ZUG_modern_air_wings_desc:0 "The development of our Air Force and its doctrine is slowly coming along, one day we might even be counted amongst the world's air powers. But we still have a long way to go to develop a strong tradition. But as they say, onwards and upwards!"

### Military Tree

ZUG_begin_recruitment:0 "Begin Recruitment"
ZUG_begin_recruitment_desc:0 "Now that Ugabi once again stands united and stable, time is apt for expansion of the armed forces to protect the nation. A new generation will be given chance to enlist and serve Ugabi."

ZUG_new_royal_army:0 "Royal Army of Ugabi"
ZUG_new_royal_army_desc:0 "What Ugabi Central Territorial Army proved was that ambitious and political officers can corrupt an institution to its core. There is no point in saving UCTA as an organisation or entitty. Instead, a new army will be created for Ugabi. One that will serve the nation, its zebras and its ruler."

ZUG_past_warfare:0 "Gaze Into Past"
ZUG_past_warfare_desc:0 "While modern warfare is an entirely different ordeal to past this doesn't discount old tales and records. With the downfall of UCTA's dominance and with it adherence to modernity, the royal army is in prime position to inspect alternative means of war and combat."

#ZUG_spirit_warriors:0 "Potions of Old"
#ZUG_spirit_warriors_desc:0 "In the past, the legendary Nnabakyalas wielded a force of fierce warriors infused by the power of potions and tonics. These Spirit Warriors were disbanded after Ugabi bend the knee to Mazwi but their legacy lives on. It is time for return of these warriors."

ZUG_cult_of_warriors:0 "Cult of Warrior"
ZUG_cult_of_warriors_desc:0 "War is part of Ugabi. It was through war against the wraiths that united Ugabian tribes. All across time an history, Ugabians have fought, bled and died. It is therefore only natural to not only respect but revere warriorhood. By elevating the aspects that make a true warrior —loyalty, courage and determination— the Royal Army hopes to inspire not only soldiers but the entire nation."

ZUG_new_officers:0 "New Officer Generation"
ZUG_new_officers_desc:0 "With the downfall of UCTA, an entire cadre of well trained officers has been lost. In order to compensate for this it is vital for the Royal Army to encourage and elevate new talent. While it may take time, the new generation will prove themselves fit."

ZUG_new_drill_form:0 "Return of Drill Manuals"
ZUG_new_drill_form_desc:0 "While UCTA had its failings, one legacy it did leave behind was a belief in strict discipline. By forgoing own thoughts and absorbing any given orders, the soldier will set out to achieve their given order without a thought. For this sake, the old drill methods will be re-implemented for the royal army."

ZUG_teach_spirits:0 "Spiritual Guidance"
ZUG_teach_spirits_desc:0 "To simply follow orders is not enough. Every Ugabian soldier must also be found ableminded and spiritually healthy. For this purpose, drill will be expanded to cover lessons and teachings about God and spirits that watch over their lives."

ZUG_military_clergy:0 "Officiate Military Priesthood"
ZUG_military_clergy_desc:0 "Faith in God is what defines Ugabi. Spirits of ancestors watch over Ugabians, both protecting them and paying attention at their actions. As this faith deepends amongst the army, prietss have become a common sight. By decree, they will be integrated into the Royal Army as the spiritual guardians and keepers of faith."

ZUG_new_ugabian_soldier:0 "New Ugabian Soldier"
ZUG_new_ugabian_soldier_desc:0 "Ugabian soldier will never falter. He knows his duty. She will remain loyal. They are all filled with an unified mind, one that will seek to protect Ugabi from all threats."

ZUG_quantity_army:0 "Storm of Flesh"
ZUG_quantity_army_desc:0 "It would be foolish to turn away a willing zebra ready to serve Ugabi. The Royal Army shall open its ranks to all whom seek a path to honour and glory."

ZUG_quality_army:0 "Quality of Bodies"
ZUG_quality_army_desc:0 "It is a simple fact that not all are fit to be soldiers. In order to maintain efficiency of the Royal Army, new recruitment standards and trials will be introduced to gauge minds and bodies of the recruits."

ZUG_comission_rifle:0 "Comission New Rifles"
ZUG_comission_rifle_desc:0 "Despite aquiring weapons from UCTA's stokcpiles they aren't simply enough or are already outdated single-shot rifles of various different models. What the new Royal Army needs are modern rifles and machineguns. For this purpose, a comission will be established to pursue development of a standard weapon."

ZUG_study_tanks:0 "Study the Armoured Tractors"
ZUG_study_tanks_desc:0 "Despite their silly appearance and expensive maintenance costs, the armed tractors UCTA deployed proved to be a terrifying weapon, impenetrable by rifles and breaking through fortified outposts. Despite their ultimate failure, it would be unwise to not examine them for own use."

ZUG_royal_armories:0 "Royal Arms and Armour Industries"
ZUG_royal_armories_desc:0 "At the behest of our monarch, a new state conglomerate shall be established to control the manufacturing of much of the army's equipment and supplies. Hopefully, this will create a source of war material separate from old institutions possibly still tainted by the UCTA."

ZUG_support_equipment_introduction:0 "Introduce Support Batallions"
ZUG_support_equipment_introduction_desc:0 "A regiment in the modern battlefield is supported by various integrated units like engineers, medics and radio operators. To ignore the potential these additions would be disasterous. For this sake, the Royal Arms and Armour will expand to include production of vital support equipment."

ZUG_expanded_infantry_kit:0 "Only the Best Arms and Uniforms"
ZUG_expanded_infantry_kit_desc:0 "Modernizing out infantry tactics and equipment is not a fancy side of warfare like the affairs of armored units, but it is necessary nonetheless. It is time to update the standard-issue equipment roster for the average soldier."

ZUG_artillery_training:0 "Horns of God"
ZUG_artillery_training_desc:0 "Like how the Golden Horn was used to blast away the wraiths in dawn of time, so too does the modern artillery blast the battlefields, shredding soldiers apart. Such awe-inspiring weapons must be aquired by the Royal Army and put to good use."

ZUG_expanded_arsenal:0 "Refine Military Production"
ZUG_expanded_arsenal_desc:0 "Expanding the Royal Arms and Armor arsenal will allow us to produce even more equipment for our armies, doubtless needed for the upcoming conflicts that will rock Ugabi in the coming years."

ZUG_investigate_new_weapons:0 "Investigate New Weapons"
ZUG_investigate_new_weapons_desc:0 "Distant and foreign reports speak of new weapons that are unlike anything seen so far. Gasses that will choke the enemy from their forts, shells that explode into a firestorm that water cannot douse. While many spoken out against looking into these weapons, the army has made its position clear: Ugabi must remain protected."

ZUG_royal_officer_college:0 "Royal Military College Kargaweze"
ZUG_royal_officer_college_desc:0 "Deep in the Karagaweze marshes, we shall set up a new officer school on an island surrounded by swamp. It shall embrace new tactics, and provide a harsh environment to ensure that the officers trained there will come out as the most skilled and disciplined in the Great Lakes. Far outperforming their UCTA predecessors."

ZUG_cryptography:0 "Found Cryptology Department"
ZUG_cryptography_desc:0 "Rooted in the ancient religious script of God himself, our military cryptology department shall be founded on the Ekyaama code, using the words of the divine to conceal our communications from the enemy. Just one more way God protects Ugabi from all its enemies."

ZUG_wargames:0 "Institute Wargames"
ZUG_wargames_desc:0 "Curious souvenier from distant Griffonia has recently spread like wildfire amongst the officer students in the military academy; Kriegsspiel. Using map, statistics and figurines to emulate battlefield situations players decide upon tactics and outcomes are based on mathematical calculations. It would be wise to sponsor this hobby amongs the officers."

ZUG_new_tank_designs:0 "Modern Armor Designs"
ZUG_new_tank_designs_desc:0 "Armor designs advance rapidly, with engineers always finding new ways to refine and develop the technologies of modern warfare. We mustn't be left behind, our best researchers shall be put to work ensuring our armored corps is up to scratch with the rest of Zebrica."

ZUG_reforged_ucta:0 "Reforged Territorial Army"
ZUG_reforged_ucta_desc:0 "Despite rampant factionalism, Ugabi Central Territorial Army is still the best defence Ugabi has against foreign threats. Instead of abandoning the progress it has gained the army will be reformed to serve Ugabi"

ZUG_ekiso_plan:0 "Ekiso's Plan"
ZUG_ekiso_plan_desc:0 "Despite being a proponent for a modern style warfare applying a combined force of infantry and armoured vehicles, Ekiso is also proponent for mass-mobilization of the country and adherence to a non-hierarchical model of warfare. He sees that in this day and age, an era of strictly hierarchical warfare has come to an end and at local level officers must be given room to improvise in order to achieve goals."

ZUG_strict_discipline:0 "Institute Strict Discipline"
ZUG_strict_discipline_desc:0 "An order given by an officer is absolute. When given one, a soldier's duty is to heed it, not to toy with petty thoughts of reason. Only by instituting strict discipline and punishments amongst the entire army can this transformation be achieved."

ZUG_begin_officer_training:0 "Open Officer Academy"
ZUG_begin_officer_training_desc:0 "If we are to let our local officers take charge of their sections of the front, and leave victory in their hooves, we need to ensure they are as skilled as possible. A new native military academy shall be established, borrowing from what the UCTA learned in Saddle Arabia to create and teach Marshal Ekiso's new doctrines."

ZUG_reserve_statistics:0 "Additional Reserves"
ZUG_reserve_statistics_desc:0 "Through the creation of a national reserve designation program, all able-bodied Ugabi citizens shall be placed on a draft registry, ready to be called up when their nation needs them, to fight and gain victory for God and country. In addition, logistics will be set up to ensure these reserves are always ready to replace their comrades who have passed into the next life."

ZUG_military_industrial_partnership:0 "Partner with the Industrialists"
ZUG_military_industrial_partnership_desc:0 "In order to supply our soldiers at the front, we will need equipment and logistics. Ugabi is not a land rich in industry, and so to do this, we will need to partner with those few industrial magnates in our land to ensure our soldiers will always have the means to fight their hardest for their land."

ZUG_doctrine_exploration:0 "Continued Doctrine Development"
ZUG_doctrine_exploration_desc:0 "We must never stop innovating for the good of Ugabi. Our enemies will always try to invent ways to best our modern tactics, but we must always be one step ahead, always changing, ever-evolving so that we can dominate the fields of battle wherever we meet the enemy."

ZUG_ekiso_academy:0 "Ugabian War College"
ZUG_ekiso_academy_desc:0 "Establishing a new Military Academy in the capital will ensure our officers are always close to the heart of innovation; using our education in Saddle Arabia we can create a teaching curriculum based on the Marshal's refined tactics. This will ensure our officers are always at their peak."

ZUG_secret_section:0 "Bureau of Alternative Warfare"
ZUG_secret_section_desc:0 "Under the covert name of the "Innovation and Specialization Division," Marshal Ekiso has begun an investigation on applying both biological and chemical weapons on a larger scale in modern war. While many may look down upon their use, Ugabi knows that it must do whatever it can to survive. God shall forgive us, for we may not be able to forgive ourselves."

ZUG_plans_plans:0 "Plans, Plans and Plans"
ZUG_plans_plans_desc:0 "Planning, both on the grand scale and on the scale of individual units, is the key to modern war. These plans, however, must be able to shift with the conditions of the battlefield so that we can outmaneuver our enemies, and achieve both a tactical and strategic victory in all battles."

ZUG_national_fervor:0 "Ugabian Superiority"
ZUG_national_fervor_desc:0 "We are Ugabi! The breakers of Mazwi tyranny! The defiers of the Storm King! The nation with the greatest and most modern army in the Great Lakes! And a nation blessed by God himself! This utter truth shall be the foundation of our army, we know we are superior, and we must show that to our enemies at all costs."

ZUG_national_faith:0 "In Death Duty Continues"
ZUG_national_faith_desc:0 "Marshal Ekiso, along with the priests of the land, have delivered a revelation unto the soliders of our army. In our faith, when warriors of great valor fall in battle, they become spirits of the battlefield, riding upon the wind to deliver victory to their brothers in arms. Then, in these times of strife, the priests have reasoned, all fallen soliders of Ugabi shall return themselves to aid the fight!"

ZUG_subservient_faith:0 "Belief In Nation"
ZUG_subservient_faith_desc:0 "Our faith in God guides the ship of state, and so belief in God therefore begats trust in the state, and more importantly the army. Our soldier must know that their faith in God the protector shall guide them in their service of Ugabi. So our soldiers shall go forth with new faith in heart, knowing they are doing God's will in their service."

ZUG_integrated_faith:0 "God and Army"
ZUG_integrated_faith_desc:0 "Many of the nation's most faithful are already members of our army. We can use this by encouraging the personal faith of our soldiers and previding them with chaplains through which to channel their divine belief. Fighting with renewed vigor, our soldiers shall know this mantra:\n§RTheir gun is God's blade, their resolve, His weapon, their soul, His alone.§!"

ZUG_new_regiment_model:0 "New Regiment Formations"
ZUG_new_regiment_model_desc:0 "Marshal Ekiso has placed forth a plan for the creation of new regiment formations based on his understanding of modern war. This is probably his least controversial military proposal and includes modernizing and updating the equipment for various infantry formations and further specializing his New Model Regiments."

ZUG_expand_tank_corps:0 "Expand the Tank Brigade"
ZUG_expand_tank_corps_desc:0 "Ugabi's armored forces are the cornerstone of the UCTA's military successes. While they are still far behind the rest of the world's armored corps, it shouldn't be hard to get our program up to speed. With intense research, we can ensure we will have the best, and possibly only armored forces in the great lakes, ensuring our domination."

ZUG_infantry_support_armor:0 "Shield of the Attack"
ZUG_infantry_support_armor_desc:0 "The Infantry Tank stands ready to revolutionize the concept of the infantry attack into a new form of warfare. Serving as the shield of the infantry, we can now have formations attack in small units with one or two tanks, and they will be protected as they advance to destroy our enemies."

ZUG_spearhead_armor:0 "Tip of the Charge"
ZUG_spearhead_armor_desc:0 "Armored spearheads will be the best way to use our tanks in these new days of modern war. Breaking through the lines of the enemy to encircle and crush them, this is the pinnacle of armored warfare, and we must ensure that our tank regiments operate as such."

ZUG_tank_trials:0 "Experiment and Test New Models"
ZUG_tank_trials_desc:0 "While we have imported our tank designs from other powers for a long time, it is time for the UCTA to begin developing its own armored designs. A new UCTA development team will be created to begin the work of placing our theoretical designs for new armor into practical use, and with these new vehicles, Ugabi shall triumph."

ZUG_modern_warfare:0 "Cult of Armoured Warfare"
ZUG_modern_warfare_desc:0 "While the description that some of our officers have given to our military strategy, that it is a "Cult" around armored war is incredibly heretical in all forms, we can not deny that the concept of mobile, modern war has become an obsession of the UCTA. It is time to make this impression a reality, and truly embrace all facets of this type of warfare."

ZUG_olukalu_charge:0 "Olukalu's Charge"
ZUG_olukalu_charge_desc:0 "A pecualiar doctorine —or rather a self-realized theory— by officer Olukalu is one of continued aggression against the foe. Through this one will ultimately achieve a breakthrough by eliminating your foe's chance to recover and stabilize their frontlines. An individual soldier will put aside their person and merge with their comrades into an unbreakable force."

ZUG_updated_tactics:0 "Emphasize Aggressive Tactics"
ZUG_updated_tactics_desc:0 "If we are not on the offense at all times, then we are fighting war wrong. We shall never let our enemies take from us like the Mazwi, and the Yetis did! We shall refine our war down to the bone and ensure that all Ugabi soldiers know, they must advance, at all costs, and inflict defeat upon the enemy. And if they fail? They shall attack again, to give their lives with honor so that Ugabi may yet prosper without them."

ZUG_storm_weapons:0 "Overwhelming Firepower"
ZUG_storm_weapons_desc:0 "War is destruction, this is a simple fact that must be acknowledged by all soldiers and commanders. And since this is true, we must ensure that our weapons are in peak form to ensure this destruction comes about in the name of God, wiping clean the slates of our enemies and purifying them in a storm of fire and wrath."

ZUG_motorization:0 "Army On Wheels"
ZUG_motorization_desc:0 "Motorizing our army is the key to ensuring top combat performance. Together with our doctrines of offense and self-sacrifice we can give our soldiers the tools they need to realize the full extend of Marshal Olukalu's military plans. Decisive movement shall combine with decisive attack to produce a winning strategy for Ugabi."

ZUG_spread_propaganda:0 "Leaflets and Speeches"
ZUG_spread_propaganda_desc:0 "Our army must know why we fight! We fight for the preservation of Ugabi! All who stand against our great nation stand against the will of God and our inevitable victory! All soldiers must have a fire that burns in their hearts to see our destiny fulfilled, and so they shall have the courage to make it so."

ZUG_virtue_aggression:0 "Virtue of Aggression"
ZUG_virtue_aggression_desc:0 "Aggression is now ingrained in our tactics through the reforms of the brave Marshal Olukalu. But now we must engrain it within our soldiers. We shall value those who show more aggression, more violence, and encourage this behavior in training exercises. So that when war comes to Ugabi, our enemies will face the most furious fighters in Zebrica."

ZUG_morale_officers:0 "Introduce Morale Officers"
ZUG_morale_officers_desc:0 "In order to maintain morale and our army's core principles, Olukalu has created a corps of Morale Officers who's job it is to keep the Marshal's ideals alive in the army, and keep it loyal to the state. They shall promote our ideas of aggression amongst the soldiers, and ensure that if any soldier considers cowardice, they know what is behind them may be worse than what is ahead."

ZUG_dead_individuality:0 "Death of Individuality"
ZUG_dead_individuality_desc:0 "Each individual soldier, while important, is not to be seen as some heroic singular factor. An army operates in units, comrades fighting together to achieve objectives. War is a game of statistics and destruction, and our high command must approach it as such. There is no worth in reminiscing on individual lives, and all military staff, from generals to privates, must be aware of that."

ZUG_relentless_attacks:0 "Without Mercy for Others and Self"
ZUG_relentless_attacks_desc:0 "Mercy is a tool of the old age of feudal chivalry, with no place in modern war. Soldiers now must be entirely selfless regarding pain and death, forgoing their own emotions and thoughts in service of the greater aim of victory. Their death and suffering is in the place of greater suffering for their comrades, and all pain and death they inflict alleviates the pain upon Ugabi's soul. And by God, may they not hurt Ugabi."

ZUG_officer_purity:0 "Ensure Officer Loyalties"
ZUG_officer_purity_desc:0 "Only the most faithful and dedicated can serve in our officer corps. They must have proven themselves worthy of serving both Ugabi and God, by understanding the Marshal's realities of war. Since for God's chosen nation, there is no alternative to these truths, and there is no point in waging war any other way."

ZUG_daredo_brigades:0 "Dare-Do Brigades"
ZUG_daredo_brigades_desc:0 "Those soldiers who have failed to exemplify our doctrine before, or have failed to accept the truths of the Marshal have one chance to make up for their failure. Participation in the Dare-Do brigades, for one final assault against the enemy, for one final victory.\n\n§LIn death, peace. In life, shame. In God, atonement.§!"

ZUG_soldier_oath:0 "Oath of Death"
ZUG_soldier_oath_desc:0 "In the blackest days, and in the deepest nights, in Ugabi's days of strife, for not myself shall my life go, but for the nation, the army, for the God who loves me so.\n\n§LAnd so this oath, on fields of blood made, shall make my flesh strong, and my spirit saved.§!"

This left the new army without a purpose yet a powerful position in the free nation, enough to rival the monarchy itself. Over the years, the UCTA has only grown in influence, directly taking control of the economy in key areas and only paying lipservice to the ruler."

More alarmingly, many of its leaders are also chieftains of influential eastern tribes and this has given the movement legitimacy even amongst the traditional elite."

Over the years, however, the original abolitionist coalition has grown into a broad alliance for further reforms. More alarmingly, many of its leaders are also chieftains of influential eastern tribes and this has given the movement legitimacy even amongst the traditional elite.\n\nUnder Gulu rule, Ugabi has slowly began to embrace the concept of shared decision making. The reality is, however, that such ambition will take time and effort before true democracy can be achieved without endangering the freedoms gained. Until that day comes, the Gulu Clique will continue to oversee the process."

### Power struggle events

zugstart.1.t:0 "Her Vision"
zugstart.1.d:0 "As Mukisa was brought to the ceremonial platform in the traditional palanquin, she displayed the cool demeanour a Nnabakyala ought to in public as the chief messenger of their God. Yet she couldn’t help but be worried. It was the first grand winter festival since the danger of the Storm King’s armies waned. If she failed in rousing the people, who knew what would become of Ugabi with so many clouds gathering. She knew it was all up to her, God’s tool among mortals, a thought she repeated as she took her seat on the platform. Then, silence was called by the court griot. The moment of truth.\n\n“Our most beloved people, o faithful ones of Ugabi. As this festival’s end nears, our God smiles upon all of you and in his infinite love and wisdom, he granted our royal person a vision of things to come.\n\nWe have seen a Storm blowing over our lands, bringing misery and snuffing out ill-tended to hearths and torches alike. We have seen the earth tremble and roar, bringing down the towers of vanity of foolhardy upstarts and greedy chieftains. But for all the cries of the storm and the roars of the earth, we foresaw a city of gold emerging unbroken and defiant, glistening under the clear sky.\n\nThat city, o our people, was Ugabi. Our God warned us of difficult times ahead and as his messenger, we warn you in turn with this promise. A time of gold and milk and honey awaits us. In faith, we will prevail!”\n\nAs the people - seemingly without worry about her vision - applauded her, Mukisa left the podium and made her way to the other podium where the ceremonial golden horn had been placed. There, she would fulfill her role as Nnabakyala and blow it as a warning to the cold wraiths who would dare threaten Ugabi. As she picked up, she couldn’t help but marvel at the details of the forgery her advisor Chausiku had ordered made since the Storm King stole the real one. That devious mare might as well be magical herself with all her tricks. If she was concerned about the need for the real one, she didn’t let anyzebra there notice and blew it. As the fake horn loudly blew, with only the most acute ears being able to remember the difference in sound, the people erupted in cheers as a firework displayed fired in the background."
zugstart.1.a:0 "Three cheers to our Nnabakyala!"

zugstart.2.t:0 "Tumultuous Spring"
zugstart.2.d:0 "Follow-up event where Mukisa is in her private parlour, reading reports about the military expanding bandit hnting activities to yet another village (read as them just beginning to extort it) and a certain high ranking Gulu clique reformer has escaped house captivity. Mukisa essentially explains to herself and the player the tumultuous political situation Ugabi is in and how either the military or the Gulu clique can move her aside if they gain the power and popularity. To counter this, she has a plan. She will summon the tribes to a summit in the early summer where she will call upon them to reneve their oaths to her and therefore enforce her authority publicly to the nation. However, she will need to cement her position over the spring and make sure neither faction will be powerful enough to oppose her. If Mukisa plays her cards right, then she will be truly in charge of Ugabi."
zugstart.2.a:0 "Let the game begin."

zugstart.3.t:0 "Unfounded Fears"
zugstart.3.d:0 "In the event Mukisa is walking outside the capital on one of her fields where a Maregyptian tractor is being shown to her by a pony engineer. Her royal entourage whisper in the back while further away commoners watch the happening. In her mind Mukisa wonders why there is such a fuzz over such a simple machine but she knows the commoner fears the machines due to the military using them for war. She asks the engineer if anyone can drive such a machine. Given a yes, she tells a guard to fetch the oldest commoner in the crowd. That commoner is then ordered by Mukisa to climb onto the tractor alongside the pony engineer. After a while, the vehicle comes active and begins to drive, operated by the old zebra. This should break fear amongst the common masses, who now look in amazement, especially as the tractor breaks the soil so easily."
zugstart.3.a:0 "A tool is a tool, and nothing more."

zugstart.4.t:0 "An Unusual Strike"
zugstart.4.d:0 "When Mukisa arrived at the meeting, she quickly noticed the tense atmosphere. Jengo was nervously fiddling with his papers while Munganajua seemed to incarnate the perfect stiff Ugabian court stiff upper lip but he couldn’t hide the slight twitching in his back leg. As for Chausiku, well, the mare seemed unphased but then again, when was she not? All rose for her and only after she blessed the meeting would they sit down. She then gave voice to Jengo.\n\n“I’m afraid I come as the bearer of bad news. Incomprehensible ones too. Work on the western railroad grinded to a halt. The workers have gone on strike, claiming bad work conditions. They demand a paid compensation. I’ve tried to bargain with them as I had planned for better accommodation to be shipped on site anyway but they wouldn’t have any of it. They demand pay and won’t hear reason. I fear they will escalate and even resort to sabotage. It’s incomprehensible.”\n\nMukisa shurgged: “We do not allow strikes or sabotage. Send in the UCTA. If there’s one thing they’re still good for, it’s beating up uppity but defenseless civilians.”\n\nChausiku intervened: “Would be unwise, your Majesty. It’s not a strike. The UCTA is pressuring the workers so they can get a cut of the money. Well, more like the workers will get a small cut of the UCTA bribe. If we send them in, they’ll break more than the strikers as payback and blame it on them.”\n\n“How would you know about that”, inquired Munganajua, glaring at the mare.\n\n“Because I taught that trick. We used it on the Malwians during the armament years. Very effective”, answered Chausiku\n\nJengo angrily snapped back: “You sound mightily proud of having sabotaged our infrastructure effort.”\n\nChausiku shrugged quietly: “A blacksmith doesn’t stop being proud of his work because a thief stabbed him with one of his swords. Or only very briefly.”\n\n“Even if it is so, we mustn’t pay anything. It would be a public humiliation for her Majesty and her government to even acknowledge such lowly demands. They’ll get back to work soon enough or starve”, concluded Munganajua.\n\nJengo immediately countered that doing so would drastically hurt the project. Adding her support, Chaukisu also pointed out that the cost of just the delay would be worse for the royal coffers than paying. This only caused Munganajua to accuse them of putting money before principles.\n\nFrom then on, the discussion devolved into an argument between the advisors. Finally, Mukisa raised her hoof and all quieted down. The Nnabakyala would decide."
zugstart.4.a:0 "§RJust give them the damned gift to make them go.§!"
zugstart.4.b:0 "YRPWe must bide our time for now.§!"

zugstart.5.t:0 "Report Review"
zugstart.5.d:0 "A backfire event where the comission sent to review and plan the drainign process. It has, however, become obvious that there's been serious misscalculations done; it is simply impossible to fulfill the lofty goals with the current budget. This leaves Mukisa with two options; either she downscales her plans but raise ire of the locals, certainly making some go back to the Gulu faction, or increase the comission's budget from her own wealth."
zugstart.5.a:0 "§OPerhaps some plans can be backscaled?§!"
zugstart.5.b:0 "YRDip into the royal treasury to fulfil the plans.§!"

zugstart.6.t:0 "An Evening Story"
zugstart.6.d:0 "In the event a griot finishes telling a tale in a Western Ugabian village. Afterwards, she continues on to tell about Mukisa, her wealth and fierce prowess. How her rule is wise and just. Essentially tells propaganda of her reign, and how the locals should never forget how their Nnabakyala is still their rightful overlord. Should cause some to leave, out of fear for reprisals from the military while others, silently, avert her gaze. She should make a mental note at the end how she needs to leave when everyone's asleep, or risk meeting end of a barrel the coming morning."
zugstart.6.a:0 "Thankless work, even if for a good pay."

zugstart.7.t:0 "Claims Gone Too Far"
zugstart.7.d:0 "A backfire event where the rumours meant to discredit and ruin image of the Gulu reformers has spilled over to Mukisa's own faction; an influential court noble is accused of being a foul cultist due to a past association to a Gulu reformer accused of being one too. By law this should lead to a trial by the temple, so that the accused is either punished or proven innocent. Problem is that Mukisa knows this noble's daughter is also a member in the military and her spies say he plans to escape to the military's camp if a trial is arranged. But if she does not follow up on charge, she will be seen as weak and unjust, favouring her courtiers over the laws."
zugstart.7.a:0 "§YSay nothing on the matter.§!"
zugstart.7.b:0 "§gArrange for a trial.§!"

zugstart.8.t:0 "Clandestine Meeting"
zugstart.8.d:0 "In the event Mukisa has a meeting with two important Gulu reformers who have come to parlay with her. In return for implementing certain reforms and decrees in the future, she will have their support. Mukisa should bark back, calling some of them such as an elected assembly an affront to her God's blessed rule. She counters by admitting that she sees wisdom in some of their wishes, even going as far as calling them true Ugabians for daring to oppose her to see Ugabi rise. But she calls them fools for forgetting to whom the right to rule belongs and how their ideas of collective rule will simply give rise to anarchy. She tells them that she will agree to heed their advice in the future and raise them to be her councillors. The two ultimately agree to her, severly culling Gulu Clique's leadership."
zugstart.8.a:0 "A fruitful discussion."

zugstart.9.t:0 "Love and Lust"
zugstart.9.d:0 "An event where Mukisa's day in the court is overwhelmed by a fierce debate over an incident that had occured in the capital. Two zebras ended up in a drunken argument over some shared love interest, over which they ended up having a fight over that spilled over into a massive group-on-group riot. Issue for Mukisa is, however, that both defendants come from her rivalling factions and while supporting one will lower influence of the loosing faction it will also increase influence of the winner's side. But as the room comes to a silence, Mukisa must make a choice."
zugstart.9.a:0 "§OThe officer caused this entire situation.§!"
zugstart.9.b:0 "§gChieftain's daughter was in the wrong.§!"

zugstart.10.t:0 "Royal Splendour"
zugstart.10.d:0 "An event about a royal parade being organised in the capital to the awe of the people. At first not all too out of the ordinary but Mukisa's appearance shatters this; unlike her normal appearance, she is now clad in ceremonial armor, with her face painted in blue like the Ugabian rulers don in their ascension ceremony. She also wield the Pearl Sword, an ancient sword that was gifted to the hero Ekitala by God to beat back the cold demons and united the Ugabian tribes. Mukisa is descendant of this hero."
zugstart.10.a:0 "All hail!"

zugstart.11.t:0 "Seat of Honour"
zugstart.11.d:0 "An event about an evening dinner party in the countryside after the royal tour draws to its conclusion. However, a rather peculiar scene has developed towards the evening between some military officials and elite associated with the Gulu Clique. They are fighting over the honour of sitting besides Mukisa. Whilst Mukisa knows the tour has been a success and will see her position elevate, having either party gain a place of honour in this dinner party will leech some of that success, elevating their side's popularity. But she will have to choose her poison with a smile."
zugstart.11.a:0 "§gHonourable officer.§!"
zugstart.11.b:0 "§OMost gracious chieftain.§!"

zugstart.12.t:0 "Sullen Oath"
zugstart.12.d:0 "An event where a serious incident threatens the court. For onw of the recent recruits to the new royal guard is, in reality, a deserter from the UCTA and the regiment he is from has issued a formal request to have them be handed over. By the law, the deserter should be handed over to the regiment but this would showcase power of the UCTA while keeping him would break the law and therefore sullen Mukisa's image."
zugstart.12.a:0 "§gLaw is law, give them the deserter.§!"
zugstart.12.b:0 "§YNo.§!"

zugstart.13.t:0 "Serious Charge"
zugstart.13.d:0 "An event where Mukisa find herself sitting upon her seat whilst a delegation of various chieftains are paying their respects to her. But in middle of it all, a group of officers interrupt the affair to level an accusation at one chieftain for crime of betraying Ugabi and harbouring bandits. The chieftain rejects these claims as lies and fabrications. Irregardless of the truth, Mukisa finds herself with two choices; either accept the charge levelled and apprehend the chieftain, which would break Gulu unity but elevate UCTA's position, or reject the charges, showcasing her own authority but also publicly defending a Gulu supporter."
zugstart.13.a:0 "§gApprehend the accused for proper investigation.§!"

It doesn't escape Mukisa that the officer harbors no love for her, as she is a known closet-socialist, even as far as rumouredly blaspheming the spirits and God. Issue is that now, after a ceremony where many officers were commemorated and gifted with enough gold to be sure of a shifted loyalty, only this one officer remains. But as Mukisa is about to gift this socialist officer, she surprised Mukisa by bowing and requesting a God's blessing instead. This presents an issue to Mukisa however; as a warrior the officer is perfectly in her right to request it however the blessing would mark the warrior as spiritually healthy, something she is not and it is an open-secret. It'd make a fool of Mukisa. But if she were to refuse the offer that would be seen as a slight, playing into the belief within UCTA that Mukisa does not care for them at all and is only interested at the old ways."

The agents want to know more about the arms stashed in the swamps, who smuggled them in and who are his partners. The agent interrogated should refuse and the royal agents are left with no choice but to start emplying harder methods. Likely better these methods are simply implied until the agent begins to crack up."

How they had met once, at the ceremony before the to-be officers travelled to Saddle Arabia for training, how they returned only to see the blight of the Storm King but also how the Ugabians held out. In the end, Ekiso breaks the ice; he knows the UCTA is in a bad spot while Mukisa's tuhority is growing. He, therefore, offers to pledge his soldiers and allied regiments to her, under one condition. That being UCTA will be reformed, not disbanded. Mukisa should retort by saying Ekiso's faction does contain anti-royalist officers. To this, he does agree and offers to see them be disposed of. At least the ones not toeing the line. With this, Mukisa accepts and rises up to offer a toast to Ekiso before the crowds, cementing their alliance."

It was his first day home in over four years, having spent time away in Timbucktu and Klugetown. A few months ago, he received a letter emblazoned with the golden horn of the crown, beckoning him home. But it was not signed by any royal official but by Etteka, his friend and leader within the Gulu Clique. The letter had called him home for two important tasks. Officially, he was to manage a new system of village dikes controlling the marshes around his home village using his skills as a civil engineer. His unofficial job was getting his father, Chief of the Entikko tribe, to sign onto the Gulu's pressure against the Nnabakyala.\n\nOktuwa watched the free laborers work in front of him, and he helped one of them out of a ditch and handed another a shovel. His first assignment was going well, his second... not so much. His father was stubborn and stuck in his ways. It had taken months of begging to convince him to let Oktuwa go to university, and that only happened because he was his father's fourth son.\n\nMaybe he should talk to his brothers? They were more amenable and may agree with the need for modernization. Whatever the future held, Oktuwa would need to put his full force into every action if his home were to become truly prosperous."

Now all that was needed was for them to get the heel turn correct. But before she could see if they succeeded, she felt a hoof on her shoulder, and she was flung around to see the face of her commanding officer. And was that... alcohol on his breath?\n\n"Sergeant! I need the troops for an operation of extreme importance!" Half his words were slurred, and he burped often. "Amalwa village has a store of *hic* contraband in its brewery, and I need *hic* everything inside brought to my office as soon as possible."\n\nEmpima nearly shuddered with disgust but maintained her steely facade, "Commander, the new recruits have not performed their drills per Section Four of the UCTA drill manual, and are not permitted to perform operations like that until they do."\n\nThe officer groaned, "I thought you were the best of the best! Have you failed to establish discipline yet? I should have the Nnabakyala condemn you for this! You *hic* are a shame to God and Ugabi! You will take the troops to the village and get me my booze- I mean contraband. *hic.* Treat it as a live fire exercise, and do not return until you have succeeded."\n\nAs the officer walked dizzily away, Empima seethed and ground her teeth. One day she would be free of him. One day she would truly be able to serve. If she were another mare, she would have laughed as she heard her officer faceplant into a hole behind her. But she was Empima, a blade of the Nnabakyala, and she would carry out the divine will, even if, for now, it came from that dimwit."

Ashura and the Warriors just stare in horror at the sight while the protestors cram towards the narrow alleys but all cannot escape, as the tank turns its turret at the packed mass and opens fire with the machine guns. After few seconds, the firing stops and everything is silent. The tank's top hatch opens and Wonzi climbs out. He yells at Ashura to open the way, they are here to defend the Nnabakyala.

zugmukisa.2.d:0 "The liner’s first class mess hall was abuzz with hundreds of wealthy passengers, many of which were trying to catch a glimpse of the Ugabian heir over their morning coffee. Some would have revelled in the attention but Amanyi’s mind was lost in his own thoughts, desperately trying to remember these moments on the campus’s communal breakfasts amidst the soothing noise of the Re'emite cicadas.\n\nHis mother’s message had come not as a letter of a mother to her son but in the form of a posse of noblezebras and servants. They ordered him to go at once, though hidden in the oh so honeyed ways of Ugabian court life. There was no point in arguing really, so he packed up and left. Despite it all, he tried to enjoy this breakfast. Despite its luxury, a passenger liner’s mess hall still had a fleeting aura of normalcy and he wished to make the most of it.\n\nHe got up and went to get a cup of tea at the but seeing he was about to pour, a noblezebra scrambled and hurried to take the cup out of his hooves, pour the tea and put sugar in it before presenting it to Amanyi. He took a sip and tried to smile through the ghastly taste of a Chitali white tea blend ruined by sugar, thanking the noblezebra.\n\nSome time later, they finally arrived at Kamarela, welcomed by the thundering noise of coastal batteries firing. A huge crowd had gathered to welcome him. Cheers and applause from the moment the liner had entered the harbour to the moment Amanyi finally touched ground. He felt a bit unsure of what to do. It was strange how quickly one stopped being used to addressing large crowds. A noblezebra informed him to stay put as a welcome party would come to him and so he did.\n\nThen the crowd cleared and all bowed as Mukisa approached him, flanked by a few griots who were silencing the crowd by properly introducing Mukisa with their singing voices. Then, they stopped, causing the harbour to fall into some form of silence. Finally, his mother spoke.\n\n“My son. Welcome back home.”\n\nAnd proceeded to hug Amanyi. He hugged her back. Right hoove on the left shoulder. Three pecks on the cheeks. Left. Right. Left. No contact. Then eyes closed and a touch of the forehead. Four seconds. Eyes open. End of the touch. Hooves down. Solumn smile. End of embrace.\n\nAh, the cold embrace of a public display of affection carefully in line with protocole rules."

zugmukisa.3.d:0 "It was a beautiful morning as Amanyi wandered about the palace garden, cheerfully humming some tune he couldn’t quite remember the title of. It was a welcome moment of peace, away from his courtly duties and formality. Well, for as long as he could escape his retinue of servants, Spirit Warriors and courtiers trailing him by walking a little bit faster at each turn among the bushes. As they turned around and caught up to him, Amanyi fell silent once more. Surely the heir of Ugabi humming a Re'emite tune would cause a scandal at court and he would rather not deal with the headache that it would entail. Keeping the peace and all that...\n\nYet, he couldn’t get the song out of his head and so, as another turn was near, he began to discreetly trot so he could resume his humming for a bit. No other way to clear the head from an earworm after all. But then, bam. A young foal was walking and Amanyi tripped on him and flew over him. Both ended up on the ground.\n\n“Oh goodness! My apologies!”\n\nAmanyi tried to laugh it off and get back up to help out the poor zebra and dust off. But the only thing he could see was a bunch of aghast faces. The foal had frozen on the ground, the courtiers looked as if there had been a murder and the Spirit Warriorss were scrambling. Two ran up to him to “help him”, effectively straightening him up quite roughly while the others tried to apprehend him. He had to scream over the noise of the servants dusting him off to prevent the guards from roughing up the poor foal. The situation calmed down for just a second before one of the gardeners rushed to bow, scraping the floor, to be for mercy, apologizing for his son’s mistakes and promising to punish him. Amanyi could barely get a word in as some of the courtiers were already scolding the gardener in his place as befitting protocole. He eventually just stopped talking, seeing as nozebra really listened to what he was saying and walked away, forcing the courtiers and servants to follow him. He turned his head to make sure that none of his followers stayed behind to make things painful for the gardeners and his son and only hoped that the gardener wouldn’t be too hard on the innocent foal. On the next turn, he only allowed himself to sigh, unsure of who he even was anymore."

zugmukisa.6.d:0 "That afternoon, Amanyi had decided to go and read on the balcony overlooking the western gardens. It was a welcome moment of respite but he was quickly distracted from his reading. His mother had decided to hold her court in the gardens below. He noticed that it was a case heard in last recourse in front of the Nnabakyala, one that hadn’t been planned by the law and for which there was no precedent. He had missed the early part but could discern that it was something about land rights. A scholar had come to argue about the case but his mother interrupted his oral argument and declared on the spot that she was ordering a change in the law in favor of the defendant. No argument followed and both parties were dismissed. Just like that, the law had changed.\n\nAnd just like that, the ruling was done and the law had changed. This impressed Amanyi and struck him despite it not being the first time he had seen his mother rule like that. But he hadn’t learnt at the time. He reminisced about his time in Re’em where he learned about the various political systems of the world. How absolute rule like they had in Ugabi was rarely the norm and how laws, institutions and mere citizens could frustrate the ruler’s decision in a peaceful fashion. It had surprised him at first but he had come to practice it. He had grown fond of it. The confrontation of different points of view, the diversity of methods to tackle an issue, the introduction of new information by the more knowledgeable on such or such matter. Oh! The work of synthetism. Such thrills for one’s mind! They could talk all they long and still could improve on the conclusion, if there even was one to find!\n\nThis made him think about absolute rule and how he would be entrusted with its power. He shivered at the thought. Could one rule supreme and alone effectively? Sure, there was the benefit of rapidity and consistency but was that true indeed? Was a lone zebra not a slave to their own emotions, their fears, their ignorance, their obsessions and their blind spots. Does one rule better alone, surrounded by fearful sycophants, than together with mind bogglingly talkative contrarians? Or maybe absolutism was simply a tool, one that required learning, care and experience to be weld properly.\n\nHe looked around him and sighed. There was nozebra to answer but him."

She tells Amnyi he must understand that one day he will be the Nnabakyala, the heart of Ugabi's spiritual life and for that reason it is ill-adviced to be openly so friendly with the Reemites who are viewed suspiciously by traditionalists at the court, who the court depends upon. Amanyi says nothing but is displeased. Mukisa continues to say she must do something to appease them but she doesn't know yet what it will be. For now she has ordered the Aorandan enclave to be investigated and Amanyi looks at her in horror.

When she, however used her grenade, one she had asked a priest to bless before the battle, it flew and exploded with such force it tore apart the wall. Mukisa can hear general Lasi stiffle a chuckle but the Nnabakyala doesn't react. The unaware private and her comrades rushed the breach and captured the location. The private insist spirits of God must have intervened to aide her that day. Mukisa nods with a smile, thanks the private for the tale and bids her to wait outside as she ponders this event. Once she is outside, Lasi finally laughs properly as Ekiso looks at her dissapointed. Mukisa, confused, asks Lasi what's wrong. The general then tells she was suspicious and had the grenade batch checked and turns out few of them were overloaded with gunpowder. It is a miracle the grenade didn't explode before being used. Ekiso concurs but states his theory: because she had the grenade blessed, the private had been cautious with it and kept it secure. In that way spirits were with her and God ensured the grenade was saved for the right moment. Mukisa nods at this in agreement."

He then says one day he decided to experiment with magical crystals he had bought from an unicorn merchant. This merchant has shown him a fire spell she could use and that gave him an idea. Mukisa sees that this fire has a purple hue as the alchemist loads it onto a plower and blows it at the iron ball. The Nnabakyala and the advisors are amazed to see the iron ball begin to bubble and melt slightly. Gleaming with a smile, the alchemist stops the plower and bows before Mukisa. Immediatelly Mukisa asks if he can reproduce the recipe and the alchemist nods eagerly. But one of the military advisors steps in and then asks how much time does it make to produce it. And how expensive it is. At this the alchemist grimaces and acknowledges that the current recipe takes time and relies upon imported magical crystals. Hearing this, the military advisors turns to Mukisa with a bow and suggests the throne supports this alchemist in his experiments and the army will ask the alchemical corps to look into ways to utilize this discovery in its limited form on the battlefield.

### UCTA events 

zugmilitary.1.t:0 "UCTA"
zugmilitary.1.d:0 "The city is quiet this morning. Some citizens still walk the streets, though many stay in their homes, fearful of the marching outside. But none dared to speak. Not while the jackboots marched, at least.\n\nThey came marching into Kamarela from all sides. Some regiments in columns, marching two by two, some as mobs without order or tact. But they marched all the same. Their boots clacking against the city streets' hard earth, eyeing up citizens, looking for traitors and heretics. Just as the marching began to stop, as the people just got a break from the rhythm of fear, just as the regiments had all filtered into the city and took positions around government buildings and temples, the troops set up loudspeakers. Crackling to life, the entire Capital heard the same message, broadcast loud and clear.\n\n"Attention loyal and devout residents of Kamarela. Do not afraid. At the request of the ill Nnabakyala Mukisa, and in response to threats on her life, the UCTA has arrived to protect her and the nation from the taint that threatens it. Mukisa and her belongings have been liberated from the Capital, and are on their way to a safer location where her ailment can be treated. UCTA regiments will now begin a search of the city for known traitors, and will begin executing God's will. You are all expected to provide full cooperation. Non-compliance will be acknowledged as resistance. Reporting a traitor to your local company will be rewarded."\n\nThe radios cut out for a moment, before sparking back to life with a line reverberating throughout the city; "Glory be to God."\n\nThen the city heard the firing lines begin, and the crack of heels on earth was replaced with the crack of gunshots."
zugmilitary.1.a:0 "The capital and all of Ugabi holds its breath."

zugmilitary.2.t:0 "Utter Chaos"
zugmilitary.2.d:0 "It was supposed to be easy but nothing went according to plan. During the whole morning, the troops had encountered little resistance in Kamalera but then it was as if God blinked, Ekiso thought. The royal forces mounted a stiff resistance around the palace and royalist franc-tireurs cropped up all around the city. Ambushes cut off units and soon, the swift takeover transformed into a street-by-street brawl. Perhaps Chaukisu had seen their move and betrayed them, Ekiso mused as he raised his binocular towards the city.\n\nHe could see very little but puffs of smoke and lonely explosions here and there. The only part of the city without smoke was the Blue Temple but no wonder, he had ordered caution about it. Eventually, he managed to zero in a tank and a squad fighting on its flank. Then, a lone zebra snuck out from a small street on the opposite side, climbed up the tank and dropped grenades in it before fleeing. Ekiso grumbled as he saw the tank, his pride and glory, exploding and bringing down their supporting infantry around them. They would have to adapt. Now and later. He barked at his officers.\n\n“Retreat all tanks from small streets and regroup around the barracks and guard stations. They’ll run out of ammunition soon enough.”\n\nAs he continued his observation, the marshall noticed a few mortar explosions. The damnable heretics and traitors had prepared well, he thought before noticing a shell had missed its target and was flying wild in the air. He lowered his binoculars and looked up as the shell dropped in his direction.\n\n“If I am wrong, o God, smite me indeed”, he murmured unflinchingly.\n\nThe shell hit his car behind him, causing him to smile. God’s way of warning him. That was fine. Unlike his soldiers who were scrambling to take cover as if a barrage was coming. The marshall roared over the sound of distant battle.\n\n“Steady up, soldiers! We’re in battle, not a tea party! There’ll be plenty running around when you’ll have foals, no need to start early!”"
zugmilitary.2.a:0 "And call in reinforcement. It’s going to be a tough one!"

zugmilitary.3.t:0 "The Old and Young"
zugmilitary.3.d:0 "The shattered glass crunched on the ground as Ekiso jumped out of his tank. He dusted himself before sighing. The city was eerily quiet. The shelling and fighting was over. There was only the gentle grumbling of his tank and the crunching of debris as he made his way to the Njia Panda Inn. The guns may have gone quiet but the battle was not over, not really. The UCTA was the only force left in town but half of the city was now in the hooves of the blue and black armbanded goons of general Olukalu. Ekiso had wished to prevent that but there they were. And the little insolent knew. His troops had tried hailing and radioing them but they were only met with silence. When he heard about the silent troops, Ekiso knew. He ordered them to radio in an offer to meet their leader. An answer was radioed back: “Njia Panda Inn. Alone.”\n\nThe interior of the inn was just as calm as the outside though there was little difference. The glass panels had been blown away. Ekiso firmed his grip on his sidearm as he looked around before freezing when he noticed his date, lounging at a table, sipping on a glass of waragi.\n\n“General Olukalu. A pleasure.”\n\n“Oh but likewise, sir. It has been some time now since the last meeting of the general UCTA staff. Would you like a drink?”\n\n“I don’t drink. Now let us cut to the chase. What do you want?”\n\nOlukalu smirked and playfully shrugged.\n\n“My what a strange question, sir! I’m only here acting on orders to serve and protect our Nnabakyala for the eternal glory of God and Ugabi. And I’m doing my perfect duty. Guarding the Ugabian east and half of Kamarela. Surely only the densest heretics would dare remove me.”\n\nEkiso returned a smile. He grabbed a chair and loudly pushed towards Ekiso, quietly praying to God to grant him the patience not to shoot her in the tongue. The idea finally repressed, he sat down.\n\n“Good. That is good. With the army, in all its. Eh. Diversity firmly united in service of Ugabi, our enemies won’t be in a position to threaten us but Ugabi’s enemies need more than deterrence, they need to be put down. It ought to be our priority. We can do it together. The Nnabakyala has two ears after all. It’s only fair that she is assisted by two members of her military.”\n\n“What a wonderful idea! You’ll see, my dear friend, you’ll love us two working together. I have plenty of great ideas for Ugabi. To advise her Majesty, of course.”\n\n“Of course... Good. It’s settled then. Now let us go and inform her Majesty of our joint decision, general Olukalu. There is still a lot to be done.”\n\nHe extended a hoof towards Olukalu who looked at him and tilted her head, smiling, letting him hang. He smiled back through his teeth."
zugmilitary.3.a:0 "Marshal Olukalu."

zugmilitary.4.t:0 "To Ease Their Pain"
zugmilitary.4.d:0 "Event from the POV of a priest walking down the factory floor admist smog and fire. They are with guards and assistants. The priest preaches to all about how Ugabi, now truly blessed by God, shall bring forth a new age, where Ugabians, God's chosen children, shall inherit the Great Lakes from degenerates who have forsaken Him. Now, however, they must all endure grueling work until that time comes for rest."
zugmilitary.4.a:0 "Endure for God and Ugabi!"

zugmilitary.5.t:0 "Left, Right..."
zugmilitary.5.d:0 "Event from the POV of an officer inspecting a worker militia column that is presenting itself. The officer should likely scowl at their rowdy appearance and lack of finesse but still helds a speech, applauding them for volunteering to serve Ugabi and the Marshalls. With their comrades in the UCTA, they shall too march against Ugabi's enemies as one. The worker-soldiers salute and march, with the officer rolling eyes at their messy marching order."
zugmilitary.5.a:0 "We shall bleed for victory."

zugmilitary.6.t:0 "On the Road"
zugmilitary.6.d:0 "Event from POV of a normal Ugabian who was a Gulu supporter, now amongst many whom are marching on the rural plains watched over by guards. Until in the distance a camp emerges and they march through it. There, they are lined up into rows and columns before a crippled UCTA officer. She addresses herself as camp-colonel, whom oversees their rehabilition into loyal Ugabians. As long as they will work, they will be fed, and through rigorous labour, they may see themselves freed."
zugmilitary.6.a:0 "Sweat washes all sins."

zugmilitary.7.t:0 "To Swear An Oath"
zugmilitary.7.d:0 "On any other day, Mukisa thought, the sight in front of her would be an impressive one. Regiments of Ugabi's army stood arrayed in the halls, the seats occupied by its officers and other "royal guests." It was a grand display, but all Mukisa could feel was contempt.\n\nA griot called out, "And so, by the grace of God, the court of the Nnabakyala welcomes Marshal Ekiso and General Olukalu." Mukisa thought to herself, "So the officers were finally here then, only a few minutes late." The two zebras appeared at the chamber entrance, entering through the two massive bronze gates, wearing not traditional Ugabian garb like other members of the court, but their military dress uniforms. But where were those traditional members now, where was the Gulu? Mukisa knew where they were, gone one way or another, and likely never to return to her. Sure, the disloyal dissidents were gone, but so were her close friends and advisors, with those two being responsible. Even Munganajua was gone.\n\nThe two generals proceeded down the carpet-lined floor towards Mukisa, and as they passed, UCTA soldiers stood at attention and saluted, not for their monarch, but for their generals. Arriving at the foot of her throne, the generals kneeled before Mukisa. Never before she had felt so humiliated by a servant's kneeling, and Mukisa's contempt only grew as she began to recite the speech she had been given.\n\n"Faithful subjects of Ugabi, we are gathered for a grand occasion this day. Through their loyal service to the state and efforts to root out God's enemies in our land, the UCTA has proven themselves worthy of guiding Ugabi and its people into the times ahead. Ugabi has a destiny to fulfill, a destiny ordained by God, and there is no one more worthy to guide us there than the two Zebras before me." Mukisa choked on her words, and had to force herself with all her willpower to continue speaking. "As Nnabakyala, I shall be stepping back from the affairs of state to more effectively serve God and our nation, and in my stead, the officers of the UCTA shall hoofle these duties. And so, I anoint you, Marshal Ekiso, Guardian of the Realm, and you, General Olukalu, are promoted to Marshal, and shall serve alongside Ekiso as the realm's second Guardian. Do you accept this responsibility in the service of God, nation, and the monarch?"\n\nEkiso and Olukalu both nodded, and Mukisa began again, "Then rise, Guardians of Ugabi and serve your Nnabakyala." The two generals picked up their heads, and for the first time, Mukisa could see their faces clearly, Ekiso was nearly beaming, so pleased with himself for gaining power. But Olukalu? She smiled as well, but it was a wicked smile, one Mukisa would do anything to wipe off her face. But now she was powerless, and as the Generals stood, the court clapped, and the soldiers banged their rifle butts on the floor, and over the rhythmic slamming, Mukisa could see the bronze gates closing again, the last door, closed upon her golden cage."
zugmilitary.7.a:0 "So wills the Nnabakyala."

zugmilitary.8.t:0 "To Purify Ugabi"
zugmilitary.8.d:0 "Event from POV of a kid at an impromptu school located by the local temple, to be taught by a new firebrand priest who's come from the capital. He/she begins the lesson with a prayer for health of the Nnabakyala and for God to bless the Marshalls with wisdom. Then he/she should tell them that they, as Ugabians, must do their part as the next generation to bring forth prosperity yet seen in the land, to venerate God like their ancestors and to always oppose the foreign ideals that seek to overthrow their tradition."
zugmilitary.8.a:0 "God's Ugabi must remain!"

zugmilitary.9.t:0 "To Begin Anew"
zugmilitary.9.d:0 "Event from POV of a kid at a mass book burning and public condemnation of intellectuals and decadent aristocrats whom are blamed for all the voews in the land. The thing is led by officers from UCTA whom hold a fiery speech on how the past and foreign ideals have chained Ugabi, subdued it. To be truly free, they must all look to the future and to the Marshalls, to a new age."
zugmilitary.9.a:0 "For a new, better age is upon us."

zugmilitary.10.t:0 "Ink Stamp"
zugmilitary.10.d:0 "Akiki could hear them in the other room. They weren't subtle; they didn't need to be. Those officers walked with the blessing of the Holy Marshals, and when they came into the office, there was no use or reason to oppose them. All of the employees, workers in the agricultural ministry, were lined up one after another. The soldiers checked their lists, and vetted the group. First they took Dembe, then Sanyu, and dragged them into Akiki's office.\n\nSo he worked outside, laying on the ground, going through the papers and reports from the small villages, ignoring the disruptions from his old office. He could hear the bludgeoning strikes, the hoofbeats, the wails. It was an interrogation room. Akiki knew well what the soldiers wanted, Dembe had always held sympathies for the Gulu, and Sanyu was known to question God at times. But the Marshals' agents zeal surprised even Akiki, no one saw it coming, or so Akiki thought. Nasiche was the exception. Nasiche fled for her life, she was the deputy minister, closely aligned with the Gulu, and she made a run for it. And now the Marshals want to know where she is.\n\nAkiki heard a crack, and the wailing stopped. A few minutes later, the soldiers emerged, Sanyu was on a stretcher, and Dembe looked like he lost all the life in his eyes. He turned and looked at Akiki, but Akiki had no pity for him. If he was truly a heretic, then this is what the punishment for that was. For Akiki was loyal and faithful; he knew the same would never happen to him.\n\nIt was why he reported the two of them in the first place. He simply followed God's will."
zugmilitary.10.a:0 "Keep your head low and shuffle papers."

zugmilitary.11.t:0 "Field Lesson"
zugmilitary.11.d:0 ""Alright, Cadets. You have all been given the sacred responsibility of serving in the army of God, in service of the Nnabakyala and the Marshals. Today will be your first field training; you shall learn how to operate this two creature heavy machine gun. Any questions?"\n\nThe Captain turned to the audience of his speech, a collection of foals from the local village, and sighed deeply. Pointing to one, he says, "Kid... please stop picking your nose, you'll damage the machinery." The foal stops, and turns to the Captain. "So we get to shoot guns together now, right? I want to be partnered with Natukunda! Or I won't do it!" With this, all the other foals began shouting out who they wanted to "play" with, and the Captain became overwhelmed quickly. "Quiet! Quiet all of you! In the name of God, quiet!" The foals settled down again, culled by the Captain's harsh words.\n\n"Now you all need to listen closely. Your service here is an honor for you and your families. In their wisdom, the Marshals have granted you the privilege of serving in their youth brigades to prepare for Ugabi's great divine struggle. You shall direct weapon teams, transport supplies, and..." The Captain paused. He knew this was wrong. Making kids fight? That's insane. The oldest here was 13, the youngest 9. That just can't be okay. He hoped they would only be reserves, and not deployed to the fronts.\n\n"You know what, let's just start the lesson. Now all 16 of you will pair up... wait. I only see 15 of you. Where's the last one?" One of the foals spoke up, "Look over there! He's playin already!"\n\nThe Captain whirled around in shock as he saw the foal who had his hoof in his snout already at a machine gun, and had it aimed right at him. "Kid! Don't you dare touch anything!" The foal giggled, "Die heretic!" he shouted, and pulled down on the trigger.\n\nA click, and then nothing. Thank God he hadn't loaded the guns yet, the Captain thought.\n\nHe tried to remain calm. He really did, but these kids, they didn't understand. He went over and grabbed the foal by the nape of his neck, carrying him over to his laughing friends. Scowling now, he spoke again, now in a harsh barking tone, "You all think this is fun and games? You are here to serve, not to have fun. This will be war, you understand that? You are here to kill Ugabi's enemies, to fight, and maybe even die for the Nnabakyala. That is no laughing matter." At the talk of death, the kids began to quiet down, but that wasn't enough. "You all need to understand one thing. I am here to command you, and you will obey me. As soldiers, we are the dealers of death, and there is no room for humor in that craft. Now you will all go to one of the guns with the foal beside you. And no more fooling around.""
zugmilitary.11.a:0 "Now first, a word about trigger discipline."

zugmilitary.12.t:0 "Back In Charge"
zugmilitary.12.d:0 "Event detailing how the old rule has returned to former Hayzeb, with the old slave masters and those opposed to the freed slaves returning to power under the Ugabian Military Administration. The former Queen and her armies lay splintered, with those found and imprisoned found guilty or put back to chains. Fate of the Queen, however, should be ambiguous."
zugmilitary.12.a:0 "What was has returned to Hayzeb."

zugmilitary.13.t:0 "Fractured Diarchy"
zugmilitary.13.d:0 "Event that sets up how with the Great Lakes united, the UCTA has assumed full control across the land. However, fractures have begun to settle in between the two Marshalls and their factions. Tense serenity rests in the land, until it occurs; massacres occur in each barracks across the land, with both faction taking control in key parts.

### Ekiso events

zugekiso.1.t:0 "Solemn Thoughts"
zugekiso.1.d:0 "Event where Ekiso all by himself at his quarters, sitting before a private altar in middle of prayers and thoughts. Admist it, the window to his room opens and he in panic lifts his pistol to kill an incoming assasin. But none come and he chides himself for panicking before return gto prayer. But a whisper of wind from the ajar window gets him to get up and close it. As he does so, he looks to the capital city at night. Scars from the battles are still present. Then, he looks up to the skies. Just above lays the grand royal towers that remain empty from their mistress. Then, one by one, starts appear to the night sky. Moon comes out from hiding behind clouds, shining light from just behind the Nnabakyala's tower. Ekiso stands breathless in the sight of this and his mind begins to stir. He turns around to his desk and reaches for paper and pen, beginning to write."
zugekiso.1.a:0 "God and Nnabakyala. These powers together form the axis of power on the mortal realm..."

zugekiso.2.t:0 "Most Holy Pledge"
zugekiso.2.d:0 "Event from PoV of the priest and their family amongst the population awaiting to hear the news, forced there by the soldiers. The loudspeakers crackle until the recorded voice begins to speak; due to the unforeseen betrayals and traitors to the throne still evidently lurking admist the shadows, all loyal Ugabians now arise to the call and join forces with the resurgent royal government to combat the heretical threats who question God's annointed rule. Very much done at a gunpoint, with anyone even slightly looking dejected being taken to the side."
zugekiso.2.a:0 "I do solemnly pledge my life and soul to the Nnabakyala. So help me God."

zugekiso.3.t:0 "Unexpected Request"
zugekiso.3.d:0 "Event where Ekiso awaits in a lavish royal hall with food and drinks, holding a book in his hooves. The doors open and soldiers lead a skittish looking zebra in suit and glasses, who is led to Ekiso who stands up in smiles, dissmissing the soldiers. He shakes the hooves and welcomes Akyama, thanking the writer had time for the visit. Surpised, the writer mumbles a thanks before he is seated down and offered a drink. Ekiso continues on, saying how he is an admirer of his work, citing the Origin Theory especially; one that stipulates all zebras originally came from Ugabian lands before spreading to rest of Zebrica. Akyama, again, gives thanks in wonder of why he is even there. Ekiso will then ask why is it he then is unpopular amongst his collegues. Akyama gulps, citing that his research has been put to question by fellow collegues and historians. Quickly adding in most are gone now, having been mainly Gulu affiliated. Ekiso snorts, saying how their influence naturally wished to see Ugabi be put down. He continues on, saying how now that the realm is united and at peace, many changes are to come in Ugabi. He then drops the bombshell and asks if Akyama would be ready to aid the government in further research to Ugabi's history and the origin Theory. Stunned, Akyama doesn't respond but Ekiso quickly does add in he does have some questions. The researcher manages to mumble an affirmation."
zugekiso.3.a:0 "Has your research touched upon the Nnabakyalas and God?"

zugekiso.4.t:0 "The Great Truth"
zugekiso.4.d:0 "Event from PoV of some UCTA officer amongst others who have gathered to listen Ekiso. The marshal appears upon a podium and begins to speak. About how Ugabi stands victorious and the dominant power in the Great Lakes. How this victory has come from tireless work of the army. Now, however, the time has come for UCTA to arise to yet another call of duty; the restore what has been lost. Most officers look confused but Ekiso continues on, citing how God had created zebras to live upon chosen lands, to graze and multiply to all corners of the land. But as they grew, so too did they become estranged from not just their past but God's infinite grace. Ugabi, however, has remained. The silence is heavy as the officers sit in awe, gawking at what the marshal is saying. Ekiso, in ecstatic mood, how the old wrongs must be righted. How all zebras must be united and brought back under God's grace, to once again become Ugabians. He swears a binding holy oath to make this his life work and asks all present to join him upon this divinely ordained quest."
zugekiso.4.a:0 "Arise, Ugabi, arise to glory."

zugekiso.5.t:0 "The Visionary Nnabakyala"
zugekiso.5.d:0 "Event about death of Mukisa. Though sudden, her withdrawal and absence from public life has let rumours stir, such as her being victim of a sudden disease, a long-term illness hidden or even something far more foul. Ekiso has made a brief public statement, calling upon all the land to pray for their death sovereign and give thanks to God, for He is merciful. Temples all across the land, even in occupied territories, are made to pay fealty to the deseaced Nnabakyala. Meanwhile new rumours stir about the empty throne; most of Mukisa's children have been vanishing or fleeing ever since UCTA took control, leaving only few weak-blooded around and the favoured candidate, Amanyi, Mukisa's eldest child, still resides in Re´em from where some rumours say he has refused to travel from back home.

He holds a speech about need for the realm to unify in loyalty to the Nnabakyalas, of whom there is only one and his name is Amanyi. This is followed by a frothing attack against Re´em, who he claims are keeping him away from his rightful throne. So he calls upon the warriors and soldiers of UCTA alongside all of Amanyi's loyal subjects to unite in freeing their sovereign from grasps of vile heretics who deny God's rule in Zebrica."

zugekiso.7.d:0 "Amanyi Kamarela sat silently on the throne, unmoving and expressionless. He was still in a daze, feeling as though he was in a bad dream. He had hoped until the very last moment that this wouldn't happen, that the crazed power games that had swallowed his mother would pass him by and leave one of his siblings to lead. And yet...\n\nHe felt the Pearl Sword being strapped onto his waist, and he wanted to throw the damn thing away. Why him of all zebras?  Out of all his siblings, why was he the one chosen? As the roaring of the crowd almost deafened him, he looked to his side to glance at Ekiso who stood there in his uniform, stomping the ground alongside all the others. It was absurd. That fat horseapple had all but couped his mother, and now thrown him onto the throne to rule in his name.\n\nEkiso's eyes turned to face him, and Amanyi almost recoiled in fear as Ekiso nodded for him to stand up. Amanyi toyed with the idea of resisting, yet in the end didn't find the strength to. He stood up, raising one hoof to greet the rapturous crowd as they greeted their Nnabakyala."
zugekiso.7.a:0 "Hail Amanyi!"

zugekiso.8.t:0 "The Holy Nnabakyala"
zugekiso.8.d:0 "To be the Nnabakyala of Ugabi was to be elevated, to stand where common zebra didn't, and to experience a different world. To His Majesty Amanyi, this world currently was a mixture of boredom and embarrassment as he nodded his head to the mare that bowed deeply in front of him. She was the daughter of... some chieftain, he couldn't remember what the herald had called out. In his head, he called her Twenty Seven. As she left he noticed that she had a slightly relieved look on her face. Not much time to dwell on it though, not as Twenty Eight came walking towards him.\n\nHe knew his mother's Ugabi thrived on custom and traditions, but after his time in Re'em, he just could not get back into this mindset. He found the whole thing absurd, and he felt sorry for the poor mares who were paraded in front of him like prize cattle in order for him to pick one. Nodding to Twenty Eight, he glanced towards Ekiso. The old goat was watching over the entire affair, standing there all smug in his uniform. Amanyi wondered if he could get back at Ekiso somehow. Maybe tell the mares that whoever gave him the marshal's head would be his spouse? He dwelled on the idea for a few seconds, knowing he'd never have the guts to go through with it. Besides, it'd probably just lead to either him being laughed out of the room or a lot of blood all over the place.\n\nRealizing that Twenty Nine stood in front of him, he quickly remembered himself and bowed his head. How long had he spaced out there? When she left he noticed her little smile. Ancestors, she probably thought he had been smitten with her or something. Should he do the same with Thirty to throw her off? He decided against it, realizing he had almost a hundred mares left to greet. He needed a plan. Could he choose... a dozen for "further encounters" maybe? That way he could at least get some grasp on who they were. He just hoped not all of them were power-hungry madmares."

zugekiso.9.t:0 "The Loyal Servant"
zugekiso.9.d:0 "It had taken a while, not the least since he had to manouver around all the rituals of the palace, but finally Amanyi could engage in something he actually wanted to. True, Soil Chemistry wasn't very regal, but Amanyi guessed that was why he had pursued it in Re'em. It was monotonous, but so were all the rituals, so he didn't mind it. At least he had chosen this, and he poured over the soil samples he had managed to acquire, having set himself the goal of actually investingating the soil of every province in Ugabi. It'd take time, but was there anything he had more of than time currently? Then the door slammed open and he sighed, not even needing to look to know who it was.\n\n"Your humble servant greets the Nnabakyala," Ekiso's voice came from behind Amanyi, who turned around.\n\n"The Nnabakyala greets his humble servant," he responded with a sigh, watching the Zebra that had ruined his life stand in the doorway with that scowl of his.\n\n"Your absence has been noted throughout the palace," Ekiso said evenly. "It is your humble servant's hope that these distractions have not caused you to forget the duties you carry. It would be most unfortunate if that was the case."\n\n"I am aware of my duties, marshal," Amanyi responded listlessly. "And I will do them." He really wouldn't get any peace anywhere, would he? As Ekiso departed, he stared after the zebra, feeling the anger inside him. What was he meant to do? When a small cough came from his left he startled as he looked to the guard captain, who bowed deeply.\n\n"Your humble servant asks if he is allowed to speak," the captain said, Amanyi grimacing as he motioned for the zebra to continue. Always with that convoluted way of speaking."The Marshal will not cease his demands, not if he is given permission to continue. There is one Zebra who can remind him of his place, you."\n\n"And you have a suggestion of how I do that?" Amanyi asked dryly before noticing the captain's smile."
zugekiso.9.a:0 "If His Majesty would hear me, I do."

zugekiso.10.t:0 "A Gentle Reminder"
zugekiso.10.d:0 "'You are the Nnabakyala, your word is law, and all the power in the nation, by the grace of God, lies in your hooves. The fish cannot forget to swim. The bird cannot forget how to fly. The Nnabakyala cannot divest themselves of their power.'Amanyi sat in his throne, deep in thought as he heard the gates to the throne room open. Looking up, he saw Ekiso entering the throne room, alone.\n\n"Your humble servant greets the Nnabakyala," Ekiso greeted Amanyi with a deep bow. Amanyi looked to the guards by the door, who took his hint and closed and sealed them. On this sign, Spirit Warriors stepped out from behind the pillars of the throne room and Ekiso found himself surrounded in all directions by them. They kept their distance, but their hooves were resting on their weapons.\n\n"The Nnabakyala greets his humble servant," Amanyi answered, feeling like he was going to faint but keeping his poker face up. "Tell me something, marshal. I am the Nnabakyala, I cannot abandon my power any more than a bird can stop flying. Right?"\n\n"That is true, honored Nnabakyala." Ekiso answered calmly.\n\n"That means that my word and my will is absolute in this palace? And if it is so, it would behoove my servants to be mindful of themselves, and to not take liberties when addressing me, right?" The spirit warriors stepped closer to him when he finished.\n\n"That is all true, honored Nnabakyala" Ekiso answered, seemingly calm, but Amanyi noticed the small glance he threw towards the Spirit Warriors. He nodded slowly, trying to appear deep in thought, but in the end sat up.\n\n"That is all then," he said, "You may leave." With that, the Spirit Warriors stepped up to escort Ekiso out of the throne room. Amanyi felt how his head spun, and Ekiso was barely out of the chambers before he collapsed back in his throne with an explosive sigh of relief.\n\n"Your honored servant can only praise you," Ashura said to his left, Amanyi glancing up at the Zebra. The grizzled guard captain smiled as he bowed his head towards him, and Amanyi couldn't help but smile himself, even if it was a melancholy smile."
zugekiso.10.a:0 "I cannot divest myself of this power."

zugekiso.11.t:0 "Rewards are the Nnabakyala's Perogative"
zugekiso.11.d:0 "Thunderous chanting echoed across the temple, filling the cavernous building with cacophonous noise and movement. Swaying supplicants rocked back and forth in massive islands across the temple, as the walkways between them were filled with priests carrying the holy icons of the Nnabakyala, braziers of incense and holy scriptures. Drums and horns joined the chanting, as did the crackling of the loudspeakers lining the walls to make the holy songs almost deafening.\n\nThen, in one moment, it all came to a stop. At the front of the temple, high above his servants, the Nnabakyala of Ugabi rose from the golden throne to look out across the silent sea of Zebras. From left to right, he saw the countless faces that watched him, waiting to see what he would do. A servant came up by his side, carrying the the sole relic of his family that had been left after the Storm King's ravages; the Pearl Sword of the Hero. Amanyi silently took the representation of the Nnabakyala's martial aspect. He was a holy zebra, and he could not carry the sword as well. That was why he had servants to carry out his will, and the time had come to assign it.\n\n"The sincere servant asks for nothing, and is given what he is deemed due. In duty there is purpose, and in purpose there is happiness." He spoke as he walked across the giant platform, to where the candidates - four as the ritual dictated - stood. His voice was amplified across the temple, almost deafeningly so. "To speak of what is deserved is arrogance, to speak of what is earned is pride, to speak of what is entrusted is humility." Standing before the four of them - the Marshal, the Captain of the Guard, the highest decorated soldier in service and the oldest still serving - he glanced at each of them, lingering on Ekiso for a second. There was only one realistic candidate, wasn't there? That was the game he was playing. By being given this sword, his arc would be completed, a reward for his services, and proof of his unquestioned position by the Nnabakyala's side.\n\n"Guard Captain Ashura," Amanyi therefore spoke, "I entrust you with this sword, to stand as my right hoof, and be the symbol of my might." He was the Nnabakyala, he rewarded and punished as he saw fit. And if Ekiso truly was the patriot he claimed to be, he could go unrewarded."

zugekiso.12.t:0 "The Nnabakyala Judges All"  
zugekiso.12.d:0 ""I suppose you think you're awfully clever," Ekiso's voice came from behind as Guard Captain Ashura stopped in his tracks, smiling as he looked back through the giant hallway towards the Marshal.\n\n"I really do not, honored Marshal," Ashura answered evenly, "I am a humble servant of Nnabakyala, nothing more, and I was deemed worthy."\n\n"Are we really doing this song and dance?" Ekiso asked. "You are not stupid, neither am I, drop the pretenses. What is your game?" At this, Ashura's smile grew colder.\n\n"My 'game', marshal, is simply the Nnabakyala's well-being, and it has been that all along."\n\n"Odd how that landed you with the Pearl Sword," Ekiso drawled sarcastically. "Are you planning to dictate policy in the end as well? Will you attempt to subvert me? You stand in the perfect position for it."\n\n"Actually, by order of the Nnabakyala I will not raise a hoof against you under any circumstances," Ashura admitted. "He knows you are what holds the Ugabi you crafted together. You are indispensible, and will continued to serve, but he will make sure you live as you teach. You will be given no rewards, no medals and no recognition from the throne, and your mausoleum will be splendid, but anonymous. Duty is its own reward after all: thus commands the Nnabakyala." Silence reigned in the hallway as Ekiso stood still, staring Ashura down before he suddenly laughed.\n\n"You should consider yourself clever, then," he said dryly. "Channelling his anger like that is inspired. At least I won't have to rack my brain over how to bribe you to keep you in line." Holding his hoof to his chest, he bowed his head to Ashura. "Salutations to the Hero," he greeted Ashura formally before departing, leaving Ashura alone in the hallway to watch his retreating back."

zugekiso.13.t:0 "A Calm Morning."
zugekiso.13.d:0 ""Has it been leaked to the media that I read this newspaper?" Amanyi asked his butler as the zebra brought him his breakfast.\n\n"Your honored servant cannot say for certain. It will be investigated. Have you noticed something off?" The butler responded politely as he poured Amanyi some tea.\n\n"This one used to have a comic - a kind of crass one," Amanyi said as he held up the newspaper. "It's gone though. Instead they have this full page spread praising me. Track down the artist of 'Little Sadiki', and for tomorrow, try to get me a newspaper that the comic appears in." Amanyi ordered before taking a sip of the tea. Looking to the window, he found himself pensive.\n\nThe full power of the Nnabakyala, thrown at finding a zebra who drew funny pictures. He once would have balked at the idea, but he had found some kind of peace with it. It was his personal little reward for his part in all this. He couldn't divest himself of the Nnabakyala's power, it was his and it had to be wielded.\n\nThe choice of 'how' was his though. God would forgive him for abusing it to get the funnies back into his newspapers. In return, he would serve his people, stand as their uniting symbol in both large and small gestures, and hopefully bring them a good purpose. He didn't know what awaited - contrary to what his subjects thought, he did not see the future. He did know, however, that he felt at least confident in what he was supposed to do, and how to carry it out. Smiling to himself he thought of that creed he had repeated so many times.\n\n'In purpose there is happiness.'"

zugekiso.16.t:0 "His Holy Image"
zugekiso.16.d:0 "The world was a big place, bigger than most could understand, and to the peasants of the small, nameless village by the river, what lay beyond the horizon. They had their lives and their farm to focus on, so the affairs of mighty zebras high above them didn't concern them. The weather, their crops, pests and the temperament of the river, those were the things that concerned them and which they typically stuck by. Other things did not help them make their living and was therefore largely uninteresting, especially since the wider world just seemed to be full of wars, taxes and misery.\n\nTherefore, when the soldiers had arrived in town to put up a portrait in the middle of the village square, they hadn't know what the armed zebras had been gobbing on about. Something about God? Their dialect had been nigh incomprehensible anyway, and they hadn't seemed willing to entertain questions. Therefore they had simply let them pass and made sure to stick to the orders they had gotten regarding the portrait.\n\nFor this reason, one of the younger farmers was left hurrying back to the village one early morning. He had left by dawn, remembering first after an hour's walk what he had forgotten. Reaching the portrait, he quickly bowed deeply before it. That was apparently something they were supposed to do every morning from now on. The zebra in the portrait seemed nice enough, if a bit weedy, and some had wondered if he was being properly fed. Why exactly they were supposed to bow to it was still a mystery, but as said before, the peasants didn't care much for digging into mysteries. Best to just roll with what the world threw at you and not ask too many questions."

Being an Ugabian denotes someone as spiritually pure and worthy of glory, whereas those wretched who hold onto the corrupted, false ways will incur God's wrath for opposing His rule. At the end, Ekiso rolls the scroll and bows to Amanyi, then leading the crowd to cheer the Nnabakyala, thanking him for his wisdom."

There, at the center of Ugabi and in the halls of their sovereign stood ranks upon ranks of warriors; veterans, lone wanderers, devout and monster slayers, all clad in golden armour and armed with tall swords forged by the Throne's personal witch-smith. Their faces remained half-hidden by their helmets, and betrayed neither emotion nor fatigue.\n\nAmong these, the warrior Ashura was elevated; his dream, to serve the Nnabakyala, had finally come true. His old wounds and scars, earned in battles against foes and monsters alike, no longer ached with the pain of early morning. The tonics and brews had perhaps done their part, but Ashura prayed to both God and Nnabakyala in thanks for blessing him with both this duty and a body to carry it with dignity.  Even moreso, given the special honour granted to him.\n\nThe first rays streamed across the sky and the horn blared, yet the warriors remained still in their post, only raising their heads up towards the balcony. The horn blared again and as Sun arose, the Nnabakyala strode out. The ranks moved for first time since their watch began and hoisted their swords upwards in His honour. Ashura, though, had a different duty, for he lowered a barren battle-banner in greeting to the sole being for which he'd bow.\n\nThe Nnabakyala raised his hoof and the weapons fell down. "I greet you, warriors of Ugabi," he began, his words strenuous and voice quiet, "I greet you, my Spirit Warriors, servants of the Golden Throne. You all have sworn a holy oath before God, to protect both my being and my subjects' at the cost of yours. I now ask you: does this oath still bind you?"\n\n"Yes, Holy Sovereign," came the reply, like a thunderclap.\n\n"Then bear my battle-standard and do your duty."

Wars weren't ripping her home apart, foreign invaders weren't trying to destroy it, rebels weren't threatening it. It was peaceful, it was safe.\n\n"Tomorrow's adventures now call, they can't come too soon." She continued to sing to her beloved boy, given the name Amanyi after the divine Nnabakyala that had put everything back into order. She had never thought she'd be able to sit like this. The wars of unification had taken her first filly already in the belly, and her husband had fought in the wars for so long. Yet it was over, and he had come back home to her. They had a house, they had food and all the amenities she could have dreamed of as a child, they had a community united under god.\n\n"But now rest here in you safe hall, glowing in the moon." She had heard so much talk about this and that, how the Nnabakyala supposedly was just a puppet, or how her beliefs were tyranny, or so many other things, but Jamani didn't care. The Nnabakyala and his servants had given her Kheri back, and it had blessed her with peace to have their child. Sometimes she still froze when hearing thunder, thinking it was artillery, but her little Amanyi would never have that, and it was all thanks to his namesake.\n\n"Nnabakyala one day will call, but now sleep my boon," she finished the verse, watching as Amanyi's eyes had fallen shut and his breathing turned steady. Falling silent, she sat there just looking at him. After all the darkness of so many years, she had hope, just how she knew all others would have.

The dominion is well within its right to strike and take back the land from them, yet the dervishes are noted for their martial skill and their relentless tenacity both. War would be a costly affair, and maybe it would be needless as well.\n\nConsulting the Nnabakyala, Ekiso has been given a letter which can be extended to the Hyenas 'if the marshal deems it reasonable' in which the Nnabakyala offers them vassalage under the Dominion. They will transfer the land in question and acknowledge him as the one true emissary of God, but in return they will be allowed to keep nominal independence and their own leaders, as well as be given economic aid to ensure that their people can live as well as any other subjects of the Nnabakyala."

If we take it, we will yield the Konkaymaha region to them and be forced to swear fealty to the Nnabakyala and their 'god', but in return we will be guaranteed continued independence and self-governance as well as economic aid.\n\nSeveral voices have risen in anger, saying that it would be absurd to accept another foreign overlord after our struggle to reclaim our independence. If the Zebras seek to attempt what the Storm King attempted, they should be met in the same manner; with steel and death. Others have pointed out that if a hollow oath to a nonexistent deity and a weak king will ensure that we avoid more bloodshed, then it is a small price to pay if we guarantee our continued survival.

Their response did not even address him, but instead the Marshal, and said that they had not thrown off the yoke of the Yetis to accept the yoke of the Zebras, and that if Ekiso wished to build an empire for himself, he would have to pay the price for it.\n\nThe audacity of their words has made any peaceful resolution an impossibility, as backing down would be an insult to all that we have fought for. Ekiso has publicly declared that the Dominion will go to war with the Dervishes. Not to 'build an empire' as the mad dogs claim, but to avenge this affront to the Nnabakyala and to show the world that Ugabi will not stand before this kind of heresy."

zugekiso.42.t:0 "Sudden Collapse"
zugekiso.42.d:0 "Early today, Marshal Ekiso was found unconscious in his office by Adjutant Nasozi. He was rushed to the hospital as fast as possible, and though attempts were made to cover it up, rumours quickly leaked out among the populace, with terrifying results. The news of the marshal's condition has caused chaos, with local bandit and dissident groups have seized the opportunity and launched rag-tag attacks across the dominio as the fear has spilled over into rioting and looting in several cities. The authorities' response has been slow and doddering as the marshal has been unable to sign off on the deployment of armed forces. The Imperial Spirit Warriors have kept an iron cordon around the palace since then, and the adjutant has done what she can to restore order, but her authority is limited.\n\nIn and of themselves, the troubles should have been easily handled by the Dominion's forces, but without the marshal at the helm the nation is powerless. By all reports his condition is stable, and the doctors claim he will make a full recovery. This does little to quell the current chaos, but the worst case scenario has not come true at least, and the Dominion is riding out the chaos caused by its absent marshal."

zugekiso.43.d:0 "Saluting his superior, Cadet Mwaka departed the office and headed towards the barracks. Everything was still chaotic, and barely anyone knew anything certain. Except, of course, for him. Being on good terms with his regimental commander meant he knew more than he strictly should, and what he had learned worried him. Ekiso's condition had come like a lightning bolt from a clear sky for them all. His superiors seemed convinced things would go back to normal, but Mwaka remembered the power struggles that had preceded the marshal's rise to power. It had been so close back then, and merely a brief absence of Ekiso had threatened things to spill over into chaos again.\n\nThe Dominion's achievements were beyond questioning and comparison, and they offered not just Ugabi, but all of zebrakind, a glorious future, but it was all so fragile still. Mwaka had long since committed himself to the Imperial truth, and he refused to sit silently by and watch it fall apart, but the question was what he could even do. The next time this happened, their enemies would be ready, so something had to be done soon.\n\nThe Marshal held everything together, but Mwaka wondered if Ekiso could even fathom a world without Ekiso. Who was meant to keep things together afterwards? That shadow of a Zebra that was his adjutant? Mwaka doubted it, and he couldn't see any other creature around with the strength and force of personality to ensure the continuity of the Dominion. Wasn't that ironic? They were where they had been before the dominion; crying out for a strong leader to ensure the continuity of the nation. He sighed, the seed of a plan beginning to germinate in his head. It bounced around the edges of his mind, little more than a dream at the moment but, slowly taking shape."

### Dominion Coup event chain

zugdominioncoup.1.t:0 "Sudden Stab" #Sweet
zugdominioncoup.1.d:0 "They had chosen to not gather before this moment, instead trusting in their carefully laid plans rather than risk being caught. Every five days at a rotating schedule, they had visited a gaming parlor and written their names in the guest book, thanking the proprietor for their services, and the presence of these signatures had been their only confirmation they had not been discovered. Now, however, the time had finally come.\n\nOnce again, Marshal Ekiso had fallen ill, and once again Ugabi was teetering on the brink. But what had been the point of these last years if no one had learned anything? Why had Ekiso done all he did if he would turn out to stand alone in the end? The Marshal's sycophants and careerists would start scrambling for power soon, and when they did Ugabi would fall apart.\n\nThat was why they, the Preservationists, now struck across the capitol. Over a thousand young cadets and officers had been inducted into their conspiracy, and these one thousand would now defy fate once again, break through the schemers who otherwise would seize the government, restore the Nnabakyala to his rightful position and preserve their beloved nation, no matter the cost!\n\nExplosions rocked the capitol building as the armories were bombed, the roads were blocked by commendeered vehicles and swarms of armed Zebras descended on the garrison to fight through to the government buildings. They had but one chance, and they had to make it count: for the dominion and for the Nnabakyala."

zugdominioncoup.2.t:0 "Preservationists Prevail" #Sweet
zugdominioncoup.2.d:0 "The fighting raged throughout the city for most of the day, turning the once orderly heart of Ugabi into a burning Tartarus. Pushing through the High Gates and into the Temple District, the main Preservationist force fought its way forward, heedless of any danger. Despite fervent attempts to regroup and dig in, their opponents simply didn't manage in time before the Preservationists were upon them again. With the telegraph and phone lines cut, there were no reinforcements to be called upon, and in the end the last units of the garrison was driven up against the Orchid Walls and forced to surrender, lest they all die like cornered animals.\n\nAs the dust settled, the hospital that held the marshal was captured, the garrrison disarmed or killed and most Ekiso loyalists rounded up. As messages began to flow from the capitol again, they were telling the army to stand down. With the end of the fighting, a squad of Spirit Warriors left the Palace and marched for the Preservationist Headquarters. Pounding the floor with one hoof as he entered the meeting room where the Preservationist leadership had gathered, Captain Ashura greeted them with calm stoicism, as if nothing was out of the ordinary.\n\n"By order of the Nnabakyala, the one who claims leadership of this uprising is hereby summoned to answer before Him! They will accompany us back here and now. Who will come?"\n\nWordlessly, the former cadet Mwaka stepped forward, falling in to be escorted to the palace."

zugdominioncoup.3.d:0 "Amanyi had wanted to drown himself in the garden fountain when the news of the coup came. As if he didn't have enough headaches as it was, now a coup? At least Ashura was on the case and had sealed the palace, but that didn't change the fact that out of nowhere, Ekiso had been deposed. The news that the officers who had seized control still honored the Nnabakyala helped, but only a little. Knowing what Ekiso had been capable of, what would these new madzebras do? This was why he had summoned a representative from the officers to the throne room. He needed to meet them.\n\nYet, as he awaited the zebra, the shock and dismay had changed into something else; anger. Was it never going to end? Was he going to bounce from one crisis to another, and for how long? Was it never enough? It all just grew in him, and when the officer bowed deeply before him and began to speak he cut him off at once.\n\n"Quiet," he snapped. Compared to Ekiso, this zebra seemed just... so small. So plain. Was this really one of the new leaders of Ugabi? God help them all. "I've already heard about your antics." He leaned forward as he glared at the young officer. "And to be honest I want to, more than anything else, have my guards start separating necks from heads. Ugabi has suffered enough in the last years that this idiotic thing was the last thing we needed! Explain yourself, and make it good, because I am really, really not happy right now!"\n\nAs he finished, something else happened. While the officer stood firm in front of him, Ekiso's unflinching calm was nowhere to be found. Rather, he seemed almost scared. He bowed hurriedly and deeply, his voice almost tumbling over itself as he began to explain himself. Amanyi glanced to Ashura, rolling his eyes in exasperation."

He languished on his knees in front of Mukisa, who looked upon him with eyes devoid of all emotion, her empty mood very much contrasting the beautiful courtyard where they gathered.\n\n"She is not a witch, only a mare." the Nnabakyala replied. "If she were a witch, I would have some respect for her abilities. Ashura, help our good friend here up." From behind, the towering figure of Ashura emerged and helped the priest to his hooves. "Whatever she is," he continued, "it means nothing good for the faithful. And I implore you, oh Nnabakyala, please save your faithful! You are the herald of almighty God,  who shall save Ugabi always and forever! Surely is this not the time for the chosen of God to act?!"\n\nAs he spoke, the sound of engines could be heard outside the compound, followed by shouting, then gunshots, then a moment of silence. The priest stood, terrified at the sound of gunshots, muttering prayers under his breath. But the silence did not last for long, as a thunder of hooves began to gather, getting louder by the second.\n\nThe instant the shot rang out, Ashura grabbed Mukisa's hoof and began to help her up, before being stopped by the Nnabakyala. "Ashura. My time has come. I have a task for you." Ashura, shocked by her refusal for help, began to show emotion for the first time in years. "I shall do whatever my Nnabakyala commands of me." Mukisa noded, "Good, good." She pulled out from her robe the Pearl Sword, as well as a piece of parchment, handing them to Ashura she said, "There is a secret passage within the bathhouse. It will take you two miles west. You must go to Re'em. Find my son, find Amanyi. He is the future of Ugabi now. You need to protect him." Then, she pointed to the priest, she said, "You go with him. Give Ashura God's protection so that he may get to my son." Ashura blinked a few times, opening his mouth, he began to speak, "Mukisa, you are worth too much to let this traitor have you, I will fight and die so that you may escape, I can't leave you-" Ashura stopped as he looked into Mukisa's eyes. The eyes that minutes before held nothing but apathy now contained a steely determination. Going silent, he simply nodded to Mukisa, who laid back down on the ground. "By the will of God, I will make it work. Come on." Grabbing the priest by the robe, the two of them stormed into the building nearby, running to the bathhouse.\n\nMukisa looked into the sky wistfully, wondering what she had done that this would befall her land. As shots began to ring about the estate, she could hear her other guards engaging the traitor's forces. Was all her work for nothing? All her effort planning to liberate Ugabi from the Mazwi, was all she had done created the monster that now attacked her? She couldn't be sure. But as she looked up, she thought she could see a shooting star in the sky, possibly a sign of good luck. Then, it hurtled towards her."

Once on the stage. she walks to a podium and overlooks the crowds. There, she announces happily how Great Lakes have seen great changes in pursuit of the Revolution. But she also says not enough has yet been done and promises to continue her hardwork to ensure prosperity across the land. For this purpose, she officially announces dissolution of past and foundation of the Revolutionary Zebra State, with herself as the Premier. She vows to follow teachings of Garamel Markz, the brave forerunner of the Revolution, and commands everyone to follow her in turn. As she ends, in smiles, the crowds reception is aghast and silence.

zuggulu.1.d:0 "Thirty-seven steps. That many Otulo counted from the entrance to the throne. There she stood with her companions; Okusaba, the chieftain of Nessasi, on her right and Etteka, a graduate of Timbucktu, to her left. They had waited there for forty-three minutes already, only accompanied by fifteen palace servants, five guards and their three personal aides. Yet the one zebra who should have been there to greet them was late but the leader of Gulu Clique knew that it was not their place to question their Nnabakyala.\n\nThe chime of bells and opening of doors signaled Her arrival and the zebras bowed their heads, and remained prone, eyes on the floor, as they heard the laborous steps of Mukisa trek up the steps to her throne. Only once silence reigned in the room again did they raise their eyes to see their sovereign. The one whose absolute reign they had protested against. Against whom they'd raised arms and had won.\n\nOtulo put her hoof over her head and gave a nod. "This humble servant Otulo greets the Nnabakyala."\n\nMukisa, in turn, nodded. "And your Nnabakyala hears you," she replied, words heavy like stones rolling down the hill, "now give me your words. Or have you come to end it all?"\n\nOtulo cocked her head but had no time to reply before Okusaba spoke. "Nothing is over, Mukisa. Do not take us for the robbers of UCTA." Mukisa scoffed at the chieftain. "No but I do take you for the traitors you are," she quipped back, making Okusaba blush in shame, and openly showed her distaste to them, leaders of the common subjects. Otulo heard the guards move but stopped when the Nnabakyala lifted her hoof. Otulo took her chance then.\n\n"Our shared distaste for the army aside," she began while taking a step too, "insults will not get us anywhere. We have come to bargain, Mukisa. Will you hear us?"\n\nNine terse seconds passed in manner of minutes before the Nnabakyala nodded and the Gulu leaders smiled."

zuggulu.2.t:0 "Resolution of the Nnabakyala"
zuggulu.2.d:0 ""I will not resign! Ever!" Mukisa's voice boomed like a thunderbolt on God's clear sky. Even in her old age, her voice still commanded respect and garnered shivers from the hearing ears. But the three Gulu leaders stood their ground and showed stern expressions. "No righteous Nnabakyala has ever resigned!"\n\n"There is precedent, this humble servant bears to remind." Etteka spoke softly, almost like a whisper but still a pleasant lull. "Nnabakyalas in past have let their heirs rule in their stead when they've found their strength or mind faltering."\n\nMukisa's nostrils flared in challenge. "I am not feeble in mind or body!"\n\n"It is the only way to save the throne," Okusaba pleaded, "your alignment with the Territorial Army, all the blood that has been shed, all the bodies crushed by tractor treads. It is too much, and your subjects—"\n\n"Shall remain mine, by blessing of God and right granted by my ancestor." Mukisa gasped for breath at last and had, at last, tired herself out. Otulo, who had stood in silence, finally spoke. "Ugabi is nothing without the Nnabakyala. We seek not to destroy the traditions that this realm is build upon, far from it. We wish to preserve it. But the recent troubles clearly show that there must be changes else we risk loosing everything dear to us. Dear to Ugabi." The mare paused for a moment to let her words sink in to the listeners. "And we all have our part to play in preserving Ugabi."\n\n"A part you wish for me to play no part in?" Mukisa did not yell but her voice still weighed heavy. But Otulo didn't falter and nodded firmly."Indeed. I hate to use crass language in your presence but you took a gamble and lost. Your subjects feel like you have betrayed them and they want justice. They want change. You must vacate the throne and call to your son to take helm. For the good of Ugabi."\n\nSpark of revelation now shone in Mukisa's eyes. One that led to a simple nod that changed Ugabi."

I can see that you meant everything you said in the Kamarela Declaration. I may have underestimated you."\n\n"Thank you, your majesty. It does my heart good to hear the Chainbreaker speak highly of our work. We both want a federation of sovereign realms, united but maintaining their distinctness."\n\nThe two talked for some time. While the Chainbreaker was more radical than the Gulu, their end goals were similar. A union seemed just around the corner. "I didn't expect this to be so easy," said Etteka, "I am sure Amanyi will see the importance of acquiring the Hayzeb lands without bloodshed."\n\n"Ah," said Bamina, "I have misunderstood you. I am afraid... we Hayzeb fought a three-year revolution. We won't bow to an Ugabian god-king."\n\n"That is not what a Nnabakyala is!" shouted one of Etteka's entourage, "And besides, you hold more temporal power than Amanyi does you hypocrite!"\n\nEtteka silenced his retainer. "I am afraid the Ugabians are anxious at the reduction of the Nnabakyala's power. To have him submit to a foreign queen... the people would demand he dismiss us and tear up the treaty."\n\nBamina closed her eyes for a moment. "A dual monarchy isn't an option, is it? Both realms are so decentralised, it would guarantee fragmentation down the road. We would condemn our descendents to clean up our mess because we lacked the resolve to... settle the issue."\n\nEtteka nodded, resigned. They agreed on so much... too much, it turned out. Including that the Great Lakes would unite, or perish. As Etteka got up to leave, Bamina stopped him. "I want to make a pact with you.

zugdiplo.2.t:0 "Ceremony of Loyalty"

zugdiplo.3.t:0 "Failed Diplomacy"
zugdiplo.3.d:0 "An event from POV of Amanyi receiving the bad news of Re´emian refusal. He should likely be saddened by this, since he genuenly does want to protect them. However, a part of his court feels like this is an insult upon the kingdom and king, with some sabre-rattlers wishing to make the foolish Re´emians submit by force. Amanyi should be more on the side of avoiding war, however a part of him does think that a brief conflict to make them submit would ensure the city he loves will be protected into the far future."

ZUG_political_spring_desc:0 "§YNnabakyala Mukisa,§! divine sovereign of @ZUG §CUgabi§! has lost much of her authority in recent years. The army and the treasonous Gulu have whittled it away from under her, but she §Yrefuses to go quietly.§! On her authority as the envoy of God, Mukisa must gather power so she may modernize and strengthen the realm and reassert §Rher God given right to rule.§!\n\nStarting as a push to abolish slavery, the §OGulu Clique§! has evolved into a broad push to modernize and democratize @ZUG §CUgabi§!. Named after the convention that first ended slavery, their goals for the country are far from any griffonian or equestrian republic. The Gulu believe in the §2ancient rights of the tribes§! of @ZUG §CUgabi§! to have a measure of self-government outside of the Nnabakyala's control. This manifests in a desire for reformed decentralized government with a modern economy and bureaucracy. While they remain loyal to the position of Nnabakyala, their affection for Mukisa has §Rlong been waning.§!\n\nFounded in 990 by Mukisa to free @ZUG §CUgabi§! from @MAZ §CMazwi§! rule, §gthe UCTA§!, commonly called the Territorials, has now become a thorn in the Nnabakyala's side and a §gblade aimed at @ZUG §CUgabi's§! heart.§! Fanatically loyal to Mukisa in name, they shun her tribal advisors and traditional leanings and seek to seize her by the collar and show her the benefits of modernity by force if needed, while giving sufficient divine reverence of course. While the vast majority of territorials are true believers in the authority of the Nnabakyala, there are factions within that may not believe so strongly, who are able to hide under the army's colors due to the UCTA's political power. Despite rampant factionalism, their one unifying belief is this; §Ronly the UCTA can lead Ugabi to glory.§!\n\nThe victor of the §YSummer Summit mini-game§! will be determined by §Cwhich faction§! is the first to gain §Cfive§! £army_experience §Yvictory points§! in a series of events that fire upon conclusion of the §YSummer Summit§! -mission. Each faction will gain points depending upon two factors: what their §Cfaction's power§! is at the start of the §YSummer Summit§! and by what choices §YMukisa§! does in the starting tree. These two factors determine the outcome of the events.\n\nThe amount of £army_experience §Yvictory points§! each faction possesses can be seen by hovering over the faction's bar.\n\nBeware, while all choices are beneficial to §YMukisa,§! they can also be §Rutilized§! by either the §OGulu Clique§! or the §gUCTA§! if their §Rfaction's power is too high.§!"

ZUG_mukisa_advisor_2_desc:0 "Embaata is one of the wealthiest merchants in Kamarela and over the years has become somewhat of a voice for the various merchants in Ugabi.

However she is also a known warrior who in her earlier days fought in the Spirit Warriors against revolting slaves. While she rarely talks about her experiences, it has given her some insight into how to improve levy management but thesedays she spends most of her times studying and reading."
ZUG_mukisa_advisor_4:0 "Ensasis"
ZUG_mukisa_advisor_4_desc:0 "TODO Ensasis is a rather controversial yet also inspirational stallion. He is a bastard of a long-line of witch-smiths in Kamarela. Despite working hard and having talent in singing iron into steel, he could never become a true smith due to his bastardhood. So he left the family and founded his own foundry, specializing in the idea of mass-production method. Thanks to this innovation, his foundry found success in producing rudimentary metal tools and items at a scale so far unseen in Ugabi. While they could not outmatch the quality of the witch-smith hoofcrafts, only Ensasi could produce weapons at great quantity and his wealth has bought him a way into the palace where Mukisa is happy to entertain him."

Once he became the chieftain Okusaba became an advocator for tribal rights against growing centralization of authority in Kamarela. This led to him becoming associated with other reformers and believer in a democratic Ugabi. Over the years he has convinced other eastern chieftains to join the Gulu.

gulu_clique_desc:0 "The Gulu Clique is a political organisation that is united by a common goal of reform and democracy. It was founded after abolishment of slavery by the abolitionists in 1003. The clique's membership compromises primarily of influential nobility, merchants, intellectuals and chieftains. While the organisation is internally governed by meetings and mutually agreed policies, it is led by the founding leadership triumvirate.\n\n§COtulo§!\n§YBorn§!: January 3rd, 957\n§YBiography§!:Otulo is an influential Kamarela aristocrat from a venerated line of Nnabakyala's advisors. In her youth she worked in the court advocating for abolishing slavery against the conservative block and even the Nnabakyala herself. It was during this time Otulo made contacts among other abolitionists and once the Gulu Tablets were enacted, she founded the Gulu Clique with the help of Okusaba and Etteka. Known as the Silent Emincence, Otulo is still an influential voice in the court and considers herself loyal to the Nnabakyalas of Kamarela although she feels Mukisa has done too many mistakes.\n\n§COkusaba§!\n§YBorn§!: August 13th, 968\n§YBiography§!:Okusaba is the Chieftain of Nessasi, one of the largest tribes in Ugabi. In his youth he gained fame as a spearzebra and was even offered the chance to join the Spirit Warriors by Mukisa. Once he became the chieftain Okusaba became an advocator for tribal rights against growing centralization of authority in Kamarela. This led to him becoming associated with other reformers and believer in a democratic Ugabi. Over the years he has convinced other eastern chieftains to join the Gulu. Although often accused of being too conservative, even authoritarian, by some clique members, Okusaba is respected as a warrior. Yet he does believes that the Nnabakyalas still have a role to play in Ugabi's politics.\n\n§CEtteka§!\n§YBorn§!: April 4th, 969\n§YBiography§!:Etteka is the only commoner in the leadership, being son of a merchant. He studied economics and math in Timbucktu where he became a fan of various foreign republican and democratic writers. After graduation he had to briefly escape to Ovingoland when the Mazwi Empire fell to a civil war before returning to Ugabi in 999. Etteka was part of the original abolitionist coalition, famously writing the Gulu Tablets which Mukisa signed into law. Through this work he became an icon among the modernizers, in particular the intellectuals and rare republicans. Because of this he has been accused of being a revolutionary and an anti-monarchist. Claims which Etteka has denied as he doesn't think his democratic goals clash with the monarchy.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: BunnyShrubby"

ashura_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: March 7th, 972\n\n§YBiography§!: Born to a family of woodworkers in a small town close to the capitol of Kamarela, Ashura's life took a sharp turn in his teens. A monster attacked his town and crushed his parents' workshop, with them still inside. Ashura, in anger and fright, hurled a chisel at the monster to distract it from his father, who had been trapped under the ruins. Managing to strike the beast right in the eye, Ashura was able to drag his his father out of the ruined shop while the beast was put down by the royal guards of Mukisa Kamarela, the Nnabakyala of Ugabi. His heroic actions earned him Mukisa's favour, and before the entire town, she granted him the right to serve as one of her bodyguards.\n\nEver since that day, Ashura has remained in the palace as a tireless and zealous servant of the throne. Deeply religious even before his induction, Ashura's faith has only deepened, and he views himself as an instrument of God. His normal life ended when he was blessed by the Nnabakyala, and now he lives for the purpose of safeguarding the Nnabakyala. Politics do not concern him, and he is apathetic towards most other causes as they are not within his remit. Yet he is not a sycophant and blind servant. He is in fact a canny player of the political game, but only when the Nnabakyala calls for it.\n\nThis has been part of why one of his roles have been an attentive ear for Mukisa in the few moments when she needed it, as well as a humble, but honest answer to the few questions she felt compelled to ask. Ashura does not speak of these things though. It is all a part of his service, as is his recent elevation to captain of the Spirit Warriors. The Nnabakyala is Ugabi, and Ugabi is the Nnabakyala. For many, that answer would not suffice, but to Ashura it does. \n\n§YPortrait By§!: RyanManDraws"

ZUG_territorial_army_desc:0 "The UCTA was created in 990 to liberate Ugabi from Mazwi vassalage by Nnabakyala Mukisa. Zebras were sent to Saddle Arabian military academies while foreign arms were purchased for the modern regiments. Yet, it was all for naught as the Storm King razed Mazwi, shattering the large realm and freeing Ugabi. This left the new army without a purpose yet a powerful position in the free nation, enough to rival the monarchy itself. Over the years, the UCTA has only grown in influence, directly taking control of the economy in key areas and only paying lipservice to the ruler."

ZUG_gulu_tablet:0 "The Gulu Tablet Convention"
ZUG_gulu_tablet_desc:0 "In 1001, Nnabakyala Mukisa signed the Gulu Tablet that ended slavery in Ugabi lands to secure support of an abolitionist coalition to counter the army's growing influence. Over the years, however, the original abolitionist coalition has grown into a broad alliance for further reforms. More alarmingly, many of its leaders are also chieftains of influential eastern tribes and this has given the movement legitimacy, even amongst the traditional elite."

 ZUG_melee_equipment_0_short:0 "Bows & Spears"
 ZUG_melee_equipment_0_desc:0 "The humble spear and the bow have been the traditional weapons of choice for warriors in the Great Lakes region. The spears and arrows usually have tips of sharpened well-forged iron, capable of piercing the most commonly used protection, padded armour and wooden shields, effectively. Additionally, arrows are often coated in deadly poisons created by potion-makers, meaning even a minor wound can be lethal."
 ZUG_melee_equipment_1:0 "Mazwian Matchlock Musket"
 ZUG_melee_equipment_1_short:0 "Mazwian Musket"
 ZUG_melee_equipment_1_desc:0 "The matchlock musket was a revolutionary weapon in the Great Lakes. With their extensive gold reserves, the Mazwians imported thousands of firearms from abroad and eventually learned to make them by themselves. This weapon was instrumental in their rapid expansion which led to the domination of the Imperial Mazwi for two centuries."
 ZUG_infantry_equipment_0:0 "Rifle-Musket"
 ZUG_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "Rifle-Musket"
 ZUG_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "Rifled barrels started appearing in the Great Lakes only when foreign rifles were imported from abroad. While initally used alongside traditional smoothbore weapons, the barrels of muskets were gradually replaced with rifled ones. These transitional weapons were rather crude as local blacksmiths were still learning the rifling process and the creation of conical hollow bullets that made rifles more effective than muskets."
 
 ZUG_artillery_equipment_0:0 "Iron Cannons"
 ZUG_artillery_equipment_0_short:0 "Iron Cannons"
 ZUG_artillery_equipment_0_desc:0 "As zebras in the Great Lakes acquired artillery from abroad, they primarily used them on war canoes to dominate the many rivers and lakes of the region. This gave waterborne vessels impressive firepower and greatly increased their importance in warfare. Of course, sometimes it was necessary to use such cannons on land. In such cases cannons were mounted on wheels dragged by a group of slaves."

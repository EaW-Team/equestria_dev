GRF_beak_mines_desc:0 "The Beak Mountains are rich with minerals, minerals necessary to industrialise our nation. While the Beak Mountains have a number of smaller private owned mines, they hardly have the capacity to supply our fledgling nation. If we wish to see any progress, we must form a central mining company that shall carefully and in a somewhat organised manner, extract the resources found on the mountainside."
GRF_dulli_mines:0 "Dulli Mines"
GRF_dulli_mines_desc:0 "The Dulli Mountains are a barely inhabited, but mineral rich strip of land. Opening up mines there would certainly be profitable, but we should remember to invest in some warm clothes for the workers."

GRF_what_in_the_god_damn:0 "Wildcard"
GRF_what_in_the_god_damn_desc:0 "While many advocate to maintain a authoritarian government, and argue who should lead said government, it would instead be better to relax our grip on the citizens, and let them act freely.

GRF_privatize_healthcare:0 "Privatise Healthcare"
GRF_privatize_healthcare_desc:0 "The state has better things to pay for than healthcare for all. Instead, only those who can actually afford it should be granted healthcare. The rich gain the most and best healthcare. Those who lack the money will simply have to be more careful nowadays."
GRF_abolish_income_tax:0 "Abolish the Income Tax"
GRF_abolish_income_tax_desc:0 "The Income Tax, as it stands, is nothing but legalised theft, during which the state sucks dry its citizens. No more! Our citizens should be allowed to keep the money they so desperately worked for."
GRF_privatize_education:0 "Privatise the Education System"
GRF_privatize_education_desc:0 "The state has no business in the education of the next generation. Privatisation of the education system would do well, seeing as how companies and private investors could put more funds into schools than the state could ever have!"
GRF_illegal_experimentation:0 "Dubious Experiments"

GRF_mcnuke:0 "Recreational Nuclear Weapons"
GRF_mcnuke_desc:0 "While some people might see it as dangerous, allowing nuclear weapons to be built, bought and maintained by private investors and companies will only encourage further competition in the free market, AND it will deter foreign forces, as well. Let's just hope nobody actually presses the red button..."
GRF_revoke_labour_laws:0 "No More Labour Laws"
GRF_revoke_labour_laws_desc:0 "Labour laws are unjust and hinder employers in their rightful ability to deal with their employees as they see fit. If an employee does not want to work under the conditions the employer puts him under, why doesn't he just leave and find a better job? Easy as that!"

GRF_unhindered_industrailisation_desc:0 "In order to further our national industry, we must sooner or later be forced to make sacrifices. In this case, some of our workers shall be forced out of their houses, which will consequently be demolished so that factories can be built there."

GRF_private_armies:0 "Private Armies"
GRF_private_armies_desc:0 "A national army is nonsense. A state cannot simply force citizens into service like it has in the past. Instead, companies and other influential figures shall be allowed to raise their own private armies, so long as they can pay for the maintenance of course. What they actually do with this army is, obviously, up to them. But that's not really our problem."
GRF_the_power_of_money:0 "The Power of Money!"
GRF_the_power_of_money_desc:0 "Through the power of money, one can achieve anything! With money, you can fullfill any dream in an instant, and more! The state and the nation shall strive towards only one goal: Making the most profit."

GRF_the_falcons_march_desc:0 "Reyhard Ironclaw and his Party of Griffon Interests (FfIfG for short) have been on the radar of the government for a long time now. They are well-known radicals who wish to further the interests and well-being of griffons and griffons only, while ruthlessly exploiting other races.

GRF_legalize_falcons:0 "Officialise the Falcons"

GRF_nationalization:0 "Mass Nationalisation"
GRF_nationalization_desc:0 "Private ownership is a mistake that must be corrected at once. Private owners are wasteful and ill-coordinated, and don't know what is best for all. By nationalising the economy, we can truly control the industry and economy, and better adjust it to our needs."
GRF_local_democracy:0 "Democracy for the Griffons"
GRF_local_democracy_desc:0 "Highhill's coup and the following period under the military junta had effectively silenced any sign of democracy in the country, and the people are now eager to regain their voice in politics.

GRF_haukland_plan:0 "The Haukland Plan"

GRF_the_great_northern_war:0 "The Great Northern War"

GRF_slavery:0 "Slavery"
GRF_slavery_desc:0 "We now govern over previously foreign subjects, many of which are not even Griffons. Obviously, they shall not be made citizens of our new Order, but instead be forced into slavery. With this new cheap labour force, we can drastically increase our economic prospects."

GRF_crown_ironclaw_desc:0 "Through fierce, merciless power, Ironclaw has made it clear to us that it is he who knows best, and that he will stop for nobody to secure glory for Nova Griffonia. Let us march onwards, to claim and carve out a new Empire for ourselves! Long live Firer Ironclaw!"

GRF_hunt_the_tyrants:0 "Hunt the Tyrants"
GRF_hunt_the_tyrants_desc:0 "Highhill's grab at power, sadly, is somewhat popular. We must root out the potential traitors in our midst before they can strike from behind!"
GRF_send_in_saboteurs:0 "Send In Saboteurs"
GRF_send_in_saboteurs_desc:0 "Highhill and his cronies have taken to call any worker wanting a better life a 'saboteur' or a 'wrecker'. Why don't we show him what REAL sabotage looks like?"
GRF_freedom_aviator_corps:0 "Freedom Aviator Corps"
GRF_freedom_aviator_corps_desc:0 "Our soldiers on the ground are doing their best, but the vile junta continues to contest the skies. It's hard to break a line when the air is full of bullets and bombs! We should reach out to Stalliongrad for help with this."

GRF_protect_the_working_class_desc:0 "In our liberalization of society, we must make sure that we do not forget the common griffons in the fields and in the streets. They must not be unfairly exploited by their superiors. Freedom of opportunity must be ensured, by law if necessary."
GRF_tax_breaks:0 "Tax Breaks"
GRF_tax_breaks_desc:0 "To properly kick our economy into gear, and to make sure that we will soon have a flourishing consumer market, we will initiate a large number of tax breaks.

GRF_support_small_business_desc:0 "And so we arrive at our goal, a place where every family will have a chicken in their pot, a nice house to call their own and a loving family to come home to. Just one last push needs to start the economic boom."
GRF_interparty_cooperation:0 "Interparty Cooperation"
GRF_interparty_cooperation_desc:0 "No Griffon Rules Alone.\n\nThat is as true today as it has always been. To undertake our more ambitious initiatives we must sit down with the NGSDF and FfNGSP to move forward."
GRF_reassure_socialists:0 "A Dinner With Redtail" #void
GRF_reassure_socialists_desc:0 "Redtail is an old Marksist. That much is known publically. Less well-known is that the griffon is also a reasonable person and if we explain our goals to him over a nice, friendly dinner, he will surely become more agreeable to working together with us for now. "

GRF_dismantle_the_falcons_desc:0 "Now with a strong mandate and Redtail behind us, we can take the next step. The Falcons of Griffonstone, those that enabled and helped the coup go ahead shall meet their end before the courts. It is more mercy than what they ever wished on us."

GRF_linguistic_pluralism_desc:0 "Nova Griffonia is a nation built on immigrants. Cloudburians, Aquileians, Herzlanders, all have immigrated here to create themselves a better life.

GRF_anti_monopoly_laws_desc:0 "Too much of the economy is stuck in grand monopolies that are more concerned with quashing any challengers than providing quality service, and this will not stand. These monopolies shall be broken up and laws hall be enacted to make sure that no single entity can choke the market."
GRF_old_believer_work_ethic:0 "Old Believer Work Ethic"
GRF_old_believer_work_ethic_desc:0 "While marginalized in Griffonia, the Old Believers have entrenched themselves well here in the new world. Instead of continuing the policy of ignoring them, we should instead look to them and hold up some of the things they do as examples for all to follow. Whether or not they like archons is irrelevant to us but their appreciation for dilligence and honest labor is not."
GRF_support_homesteaders:0 "Support The Homesteaders"
GRF_support_homesteaders_desc:0 "How many hundreds and indeed thousands have bravely set forth into these cold lands to build their homes and carve out a life for themselves?

GRF_create_jobs:0 "Jobs For The People"
GRF_create_jobs_desc:0 "To earn a decent living is imperative for our citizens, and if there are not enough jobs to be had, then we should intervene and make sure that more are created.

GRF_arrest_the_falcons:0 "Arrest Ironclaw"
GRF_arrest_the_falcons_desc:0 "Highhill was a threat to democracy, and we could only deal with it when he actually struck.

GRF_reinforce_judicial_branch:0 "Judicial Reforms"
GRF_reinforce_judicial_branch_desc:0 "Too many in our nation lack proper access to justice, be it through old imperial laws that were dragged along when we arrived, exceptions for various minorities or what have you.

GRF_national_minority_administration:0 "The Nashanal Minoriti Administratyon"
GRF_national_minority_administration_desc:0 "It is, when you think about it, absurd how so many bleat about how griffons tamed these empty lands. They were not empty at all!

The National Minority Administration will be tasked with rectifying this."
GRF_urbanisation_campaign:0 "Mass Urbanisation"
GRF_urbanisation_campaign_desc:0 "Too many of our griffons in the inlands are stuck in small frontier villages, and in order to kickstart the economic growth of the Kingsmare as well as the southern areas, we are going to heavily invest in the local urban centres to ensure that the reach of the government will not be stuck just at the coasts.

GRF_mass_education_reforms_desc:0 "We can do better, and we shall do better. Disregard those who say "well not everycreature is meant for higher education". Everycreature should have the chance, at least, and none shall ever have to feel they never got the opportunity to better themselves."

GRF_work_with_the_unions_desc:0 "The Unions have a strong presence in Nova Griffonia, as we seek to implement our policies they can become a quite helpful ally. Concessions will have to be made, but they will be worth it to ensure that the common griff is protected."
GRF_public_works_projects:0 "Efntlekhe Verk Prajex"
GRF_public_works_projects_desc:0 "In part in order to rally the nation and provide work for the unemployed and in part to strengthen the economy, a grand public works project will be undertaken. The Nova Griffonian infrastructure is more or less nonexistent in large parts of the nation, and during the coming year we will focus all efforts on building up this network."
GRF_commies_win:0 "The FfNGSP Mandate"
GRF_commies_win_desc:0 "Without blood in the streets and without all the horrors that civil war would cause, the FfNGSP have managed to sway the people to their side. We put our trust in the system, and it did not disappoint us. Now - at last - we can start transforming Nova Griffonia into a socialist example for the world."
GRF_fight_the_falcons:0 "Outlaw The Falcons"
GRF_fight_the_falcons_desc:0 "The Falcons are a one threat beyond all others to Nova Griffonia's future, and we must deal with them posthaste. The Liberals will cry "tyranny", but if tyranny are murderous fascists being locked away to never hurt anygriff else again, then it is the best version of tyranny imaginable."
GRF_cooperate_with_socdems:0 "Cooperate With The NGSDF"
GRF_cooperate_with_socdems_desc:0 "There are some that would denounce the NGSDF as revisionists and traitors to the working class, but there is a difference of degrees, not kind, between us and the Social Democrats. They can still be valuable political allies and it'd be foolish to discard them."
GRF_voting_law_reform:0 "The Referendum Act"
GRF_voting_law_reform_desc:0 "In order to ensure that the average worker will always have a claw in the rule of the nation, the FfNGSP are working to establish a system of direct democracy to work in conjunction with the council."

GRF_nova_griffonian_exceptionalism_desc:0 "This nation built itself where there was nigh nothing, and though the old empire from which it was born fell apart, it has always prevailed. We are not merely distant colonists to some uncaring emperor, we are the best sides of Griffonia and Equus brought together in on nation, and we are proud of this!"
GRF_support_language:0 "Niukultur Movement"
GRF_support_language_desc:0 "Among the species of our nations there are many ideals and cultures. There is much to laud about all of them, but also much to criticize. In order to bring the nation together we should not cling to the archaic ways, but instead seek unity in a new, common Nova Griffonian culture which neither automatically excludes nor elevates anycreature."
GRF_mass_nationalisation:0 "Mass Nationalisation"
GRF_mass_nationalisation_desc:0 "Too many industries are in the claws of capitalists, and most of them are anything but happy with our triumphs. While we could rally for violent a seizure of the means of production, most of them will still be amenable to peaceful nationalization. We will pay enough, and unless a luxurious budget for top hats and bespoke suits is mandatory, they won't need to fear starvation."
GRF_worker_self_managment:0 "Worker Self-Managment"
GRF_worker_self_managment_desc:0 "With the means of production under the control of the people, we can start implementing a new form of labour management in the factories. Gone will be the days of aloof bosses showing up, barking orders and then going back to their offices: now those who know what they are doing will be the ones to manage the industries."
GRF_settle_the_area:0 "Planned Townships"
GRF_settle_the_area_desc:0 "There are endless expanses of land out there, and yet our population is overwhelmingly concentrated at the coastlines in crammed cities that have grown up over time. As we begin expanding our towns and cities we have a great opportunity to plan them thoroughly, both to make them more efficient and make them feel like true communities."
GRF_industrialisation_plan:0 "The Redtail Plan"
GRF_industrialisation_plan_desc:0 "In order to bring Nova Griffonia into the future, our chairgriff has proposed a radical one year plan during which all the efforts of the nation shall be turned to expansion and industry. It will be a stark year for our people, but it will help build our children's future."
GRF_federal_republic:0 "The Federal Republic"
GRF_federal_republic_desc:0 "Nova Griffonia might be young, but she is a world unto herself. We should embrace this and ensure that local autonomy is preserved, not attempt to shoehorn everycreature in under the same overreaching central government."
GRF_unitary_republic:0 "The United Republic"
GRF_unitary_republic_desc:0 "For all of Nova Griffonia's size, she is still one entity, settled by the same people whether north or south, struggling with the same challenges and reaping the same kind of rewards, and so the government shouldn't be scattered and divided, but united and vigorous."
GRF_northern_bloc:0 "Create The Northern Bloc"
GRF_northern_bloc_desc:0 "The world is getting more and more dangerous, and Nova Griffonia sits in the position of being one of the stronger forces in its little corner of the world. We cannot face all the dangers ahead alone though, and neither can our neighbors. That is why it has been proposed that we form an alliance for our mutual security."

GRF_order_frontier:0 "Bring Order to the Griffon Frontier"
GRF_order_frontier_desc:0 "The Frontier has existed for many years now, it is a sparsely populated underdeveloped 'nation' run by bandits and thieves. Virgil needs to be removed from power, the lands of the frontier need to be brought back into civilised society and integrated into our nation."
GRF_invite_PNG:0 "Invite the Penguins to the NRB"
GRF_invite_PNG_desc:0 "Pingland is one of our closest geographical neighbours, they could also be one of our closest allies. We should invite them to the Northern Bloc to start building a mutually beneficial relationship and protect their sovereignty. Shaking talon to wing, we can forge an agreement that will make the world a better place. Let us hope they agree to it."
GRF_invite_PLB:0 "Invite the Polar Bears to the NRB"
GRF_invite_PLB_desc:0 "The polar bears to the west of us, the isolationist bears should be able to see what we have to offer from this proposal.

GRF_invite_JAK:0 "Invite Jaki-Clan to the NRB"
GRF_invite_JAK_desc:0 "Jaki-Clan lies west of us, standing against the aggressors that surround them.

GRF_invite_YAK:0 "Invite Yakyakistan to the NRB"
GRF_invite_YAK_desc:0 "Yakyakistan lies west of our nation, bordering the changelings and the lands of ponies, they stand vulnerable to their aggressors. We should invite them to the Northern Bloc to start building a mutually beneficial relationship and protect their sovereignty.

GRF_support_allies:0 "Support for Our Allies"
GRF_support_allies_desc:0 "We have now established the Northern Bloc, a political union that should stand the test of time. We must look to our allies now, and negotiate future terms and treaties with our political partners. These treaties should strengthen the ties that bind our new political alliance."
GRF_joint_courts:0 "Joint Government Initiative"
GRF_joint_courts_desc:0 "We need to look within before we reach out. The leading states in the Northern Bloc need to consolidate themselves and that their governments is running efficiently. This proposed joint court treaty will give new powers to member nations to aid in the continued functionality of their governments."
GRF_allied_military:0 "Combined Military Programmes"
GRF_allied_military_desc:0 "The Northern Bloc needs a proper military to begin defending the values of democracy and the rights of it's citizens. We should set up a military exchange between the nations, whilst not a jovial exchange of war-stories, this presents an opportunity to share military experience between nations. Exchange soldiers from each country will be able to allow each country to bolster their forces."
GRF_allied_movement:0 "Open Border Proposal"
GRF_allied_movement_desc:0 "The next sensible step for us to take as a modern democratic union, is to open up our borders to each other and allow our citizens to move freely between our nations. Each and every citizen should have the same rights in the country that they move to, provided they follow the laws of the country they are in."
GRF_tech_sharing:0 "NRB Technological Committee"
GRF_tech_sharing_desc:0 "The nations of the Northern Bloc stand to gain from a mutual putting together the greatest minds they have. There, they will come up with innovations that benefit all member states, and further strengthen the stability of the union. Not one nation will reap the rewards of technological breakthroughs, as they are a right to all people."
GRF_allied_research:0 "Collaborative Research Effort"
GRF_allied_research_desc:0 "Establishing the NRBTC was a massive success. However to further improve our nations, we must all put equal effort into these scientific pursuits.

GRF_allied_uni:0 "Open Weter University to Our Allies"
GRF_allied_uni_desc:0 "Following the introduction of new laws regarding the issue of science, application to Weter university has been opened to member states of the Northern Bloc. With smart people from around the NRB coming to apply at our prestigious university, we will most certainly see more breakthroughs originate from Weter University."
GRF_allied_industry:0 "Collaborative Industrial Effort"
GRF_allied_industry_desc:0 "The Northern Bloc lacks significant industrial development. Drafts of an international construction plan have been put forth and approved by the heads of all member states. Civilian sector industrial capacity will be increased across all countries involved with this effort."
GRF_allied_air_bases:0 "NRB Joint Air-force Initiative"
GRF_allied_air_bases_desc:0 "The Northern Bloc must look to the air. Whilst our union may be strong, our attention to the skies is wavering. Across the nations of the NRB, we find our capacity to send warplanes into the air lacking. We will institute news plans to construct airfields across the Bloc."
GRF_allied_oil:0 "Oil Trade Negotiations"
GRF_allied_oil_desc:0 "The Northern Bloc seeks to end one of its issues, the concern over oil demand and availability. Each nation shall construct a refinery to handle the processing of crude oil in their borders. With these built, we shall be able to build a larger army to defend our political union."
GRF_fortify_the_south:0 "The Severnyan Menace"
GRF_fortify_the_south_desc:0 "However much one can sympathize with the Stalliongraders' reason for revolting against Equestria, one cannot make the mistake of presuming them as gentle as their former masters. They are a threat to us, a serious one, and we have no excuse to not prepare for the worst."
GRF_the_volunteer_army:0 "Guardians Of The Free World"
GRF_the_volunteer_army_desc:0 "Due to our remote location from the central powers of the world, whatever threat that might come our way will have stepped over the ruins of many other sovereign nations first. In order to safeguard Nova Griffonia, we must understand and commit to the fact that liberty does not know borders, nor does freedom cease to be worth fighting for under a different flag."
GRF_stronghold_of_democracy:0 "Bastion Of Liberty"
GRF_stronghold_of_democracy_desc:0 "Nova Griffonia started out as a few colonists on the shores of a new and strange land, but she has grown into a great nation no longer beholden to the old world's order. She is free, she is just, and she is proud of this."
GRF_ties_with_the_republic:0 "Nurture The Republican Dream"
GRF_ties_with_the_republic_desc:0 "Do you see it in the distance? On those far-away shores a banner still flies, one that could have died in 979. The Republican Dream still lingers, rising from its slumber as it prepares to once again do battle with the emperors that one day may well demand our allegiance again. Their dream is ours, and we should make that clear to the world."
GRF_send_material_aid:0 "Material Aid"
GRF_send_material_aid_desc:0 "Words and praise are all well and good but they will not win the battle that is to come and Cloudbury is a poor substitute for the industrial might of the Herzland. That is why we shall make sure the Republican armies are properly geared for war. Equestria can settle for praise if they should choose so, Nova Griffonia deals in concrete material."
GRF_the_volunteer_corps:0 "The Nova Griffonian Volunteer Corps"
GRF_the_volunteer_corps_desc:0 "If the Republic is to survive, it will survive through the sacrifices of many brave griffons, and Nova Griffonia is not lacking in bravery. We shall not sit here comfortably on Equus while the Republicans face the wrath of the Empire head on, but instead we shall rally everygriff willing to fight for democracy, arm them and send them to Griffonia."
GRF_arsenal_of_democracy:0 "The Arsenal Of Democracy"
GRF_arsenal_of_democracy_desc:0 "We have no illusions of being equal to the Empire industrially, but by Boreas we shall try to be it all the same.

GRF_decry_the_empire:0 "Decry The Empire"
GRF_decry_the_empire_desc:0 "Our old overlord is a tyrant by its very nature, and for all the time that we were its subject we were not a province to be respected, but a place for resources and exploitation. Our course is already set for collision, and thus we may as well let the empire know that Nova Griffonia will never, never, never bow!"
GRF_guarantee_kemerskai:0 "The Republic's Cause is Ours"
GRF_guarantee_kemerskai_desc:0 "Liberty, Equality, Prosperity. These values are worth fighting for, indeed they are worth dying for.If the Empire chooses to beset the Republic, then Nova Griffonia and her allies will stand by democracy."
GRF_logistical_aid:0 "Logistics Support"
GRF_logistical_aid_desc:0 "With the kind of harsh conditions and rugged terrain that is all too common in our country we have been forced to sharpen our skills when it comes to logistics and reconnaissance. These skills are not inconsiderable at this point, and several volunteers among our rangers and scouts have all but pleaded with us to be allowed to go to Griffonia and share this knowledge with the republicans."
GRF_republican_loan:0 "Economic Aid"
GRF_republican_loan_desc:0 "The Griffonian Republicans may be heroes fighting for a good cause, but they are soldiers, not economists, and their economy is not where it could be. The sinews of war are made from infinite money, and Nova Griffonia has the know-how and resources to boost the Republican economy as well."
GRF_full_economic_support:0 "All In"
GRF_full_economic_support_desc:0 "Do we truly think that the empire will not want to reclaim its old vanity project on Equus? Do we think that the aid we already have given the republic will be ignored? Of course not, and therefore we cannot afford half-measures. The Republic's economy is Nova Griffonia's economy, and we can worry about the debt later!"

GRF_state_military:0 "The State of the Military"
GRF_state_military_desc:0 "We should commission a report on the state of our military. With the country moving into the new millennium our armed forces will face new challenges, and before we can tackle those, we will need a precise summary on our current situation."
GRF_state_army:0 "The Nova Griffonian Army"
GRF_state_army_desc:0 "Since our independence nearly thirty years ago, our army has been comprised mostly of local militias following elected leaders. While this has done wonders for morale, it is proving itself to be a bigger and bigger issue as our military operations grow in both complexity and size. No matter the solution, this issue must be fixed and it must be fixed soon."
GRF_automous_army:0 "Increase Militia Autonomy" 
GRF_automous_army_desc:0 "The militias have done a decent enough job so far, we may as well give their officers more autonomy. Who but the officers would know how to lead their griffons best?"
GRF_compromise_army:0 "The Art of Compromise" 
GRF_compromise_army_desc:0 "In the end we have decided to let the militias have a limited degree of autonomy. They shall retain the right to elect their officers. However, those officers must follow orders from high command, whether they like them or not."
GRF_organized_army:0 "Reform the Militias"
GRF_organized_army_desc:0 "It is time to rid ourselves of the quarrelsome militias. Our country will not suffer any insubordination in its army. Only a unified command structure following orders from the top down will be able to face the challenges of modern war."

GRF_grand_battleplan_f:0 "Trench Warfare"
GRF_grand_battleplan_f_desc:0 "Our doctrine will be modelled after the old art of besieging castles. We shall dig miles of deep trenches to protect our precious soldiers while they close in and slowly occupy more ground."
GRF_superior_firepower_f:0 "Creeping Barrage"
GRF_superior_firepower_f_desc:0 "Let's flood our enemies in an ocean of fire and steel! Shells from our cannons will blot out the sun!"
GRF_mobile_warfare_f:0 "Copy the Changelings"
GRF_mobile_warfare_f_desc:0 "The Changeling Army is probably the best fighting force on Equus, if not the entire world. Therefore, their revolutionizing doctrine of mobile warfare is the best choice for our military."
GRF_military_research_department:0 "Create the Military Research Department"
GRF_military_research_department_desc:0 "As a country located on Equus, we need to compete in terms of military research with countries miles ahead in technology compared to old Griffonia. We need military technology which can compete with the changelings and equestrians. This won't be an easy task, but with determination and endurance we shall prevail!"
GRF_radio_f:0 "Radio Implementation"
GRF_radio_f_desc:0 "The world rapidly changes around us. We have access to things we thought to be magic and witchcraft just a few decades ago. One of these things is the radio. This ground-breaking piece of technology can vastly improve communication all across the Army. We should implement it immediately."
GRF_rocket_artillery_f:0 "Adopt the Nebelwerfer"
GRF_rocket_artillery_f_desc:0 "Our old overlords from Griffenheim have developed a new rocket launcher - the "Nebelwerfer". They wanted to keep their project a total secret. However, during the final phase of development one of the scientists betrayed the Empire and escaped. And so it happens that there is one particular country which is always keen to give asylum to all imperial exiles... "
GRF_light_tank_f:0 "Import Changeling Panzers"
GRF_light_tank_f_desc:0 "Recently our government received an interesting proposal from the changeling government. They offer to sell some of their older panzer models for a surprisingly low price. These tanks will be an excellent base for future development of armoured vehicles. Send a telegraph to Vesalipolis at once!"
GRF_medium_tank_f:0 "Thicker Plating"
GRF_medium_tank_f_desc:0 "We managed to learn a lot from the field tests conducted on the panzers provided by the changelings. If implemented correctly, these metal monsters can wreak havoc on the battlefields. However, anti-tank guns are being developed in tandem with the tanks. If we are to keep an edge over enemy infantry, we need to produce tanks with thicker plates and bigger guns."
GRF_magical_rifles:0 "Our Own Magical Rifles"
GRF_magical_rifles_desc:0 "Equestrian scientists from the Luna Nova Academy recently come to a stunning discovery. It turns out that the magical energy from the purple crystals often found in the mountains can be used in weaponry! This is an opportunity we cannot miss. Nova Griffonia will produce its own magical rifles."
GRF_standard_rifles:0 "Standardise Rifle Models"
GRF_standard_rifles_desc:0 "After our separation from the Empire we were forced to import many differently designed rifle models from abroad. This caused logistical and production problems. In order to fix these issues we need analyse the current situation and choose one common rifle model for the entire army."
GRF_standard_artillery:0 "Implement The Cowitzer"
GRF_standard_artillery_desc:0 "A few years ago we managed to strike a great deal with Equestria. We acquired a modern artillery piece called "Cowtizer," we need to inspect it and create a new version suitable to our needs. May Eyr bless our shells!"
GRF_standard_support:0 "Support Squad Implementation"
GRF_standard_support_desc:0 "Recent military conflicts such as the Battle of Canterlot in 1002 showed us that in order to succeed, regular infantry needs to be supported by smaller units of soldiers trained for specific tasks. Intelligence reports say that other armies are already adding these companies to their divisions. Why shouldn't we?"
GRF_motorized_f:0 "Army Motorisation Effort"
GRF_motorized_f_desc:0 "Only a fool would deny the military potential of wheeled machines such as cars and trucks. We need to focus our efforts on motorizing the army to ensure its speed and modernity."
GRF_heavy_tank_f:0 "A Heavy Tank"
GRF_heavy_tank_f_desc:0 "As technology progresses it is becoming clear that we need a heavier tank variant to round out our arsenal of mobile weapons. With the thickest armour and the most devastating guns, these panzers will be able to break through any enemy strongpoint with ease. All we need is a design."
GRF_general_staff:0 "Reform the General Staff"
GRF_general_staff_desc:0 "The army's General Staff is comprised mostly of old veterans of the countless wars which plagued Griffonia in the 970s. Although the old guard's skill and experience cannot be questioned, we should allow younger officers to put their creative plans and strategies to the test. We cannot be stuck in the 10th century forever."
GRF_ranger_corps:0 "Create the Nova Griffonian Ranger Corps"
GRF_ranger_corps_desc:0 "Nova Griffonia is a vast country - forests and mountains often stretch for hundreds of kilometers. In order to patrol this wilderness more efficiently we should establish a new military force - The Nova Griffonian Ranger Corps. Claw-picked from the best units, the Rangers will specialise in reconnaissance, survival and combat in difficult terrain"
GRF_mountain_training:0 "Standing On the Back Of Giants"
GRF_mountain_training_desc:0 "Northern Nova Griffonia is almost entirely comprised of mountain ranges. Our army needs to excel at fighting in this type of terrain. This will require special high-altitude flying lessons, as well as specialised lightweight equipment for easy manoeuvres in a three-dimensional combat environment."
GRF_train_officers:0 "Standardised Officer Training"
GRF_train_officers_desc:0 "Ever since Nova Griffonia became independent the general skill and quality of our officer corps is all over the place. Although we are lucky to have some experienced exiles from Griffonia, most of the officers are young griffons from local militia units - with often little to no training at all. This is why we need to make efforts to put officer training standards on a higher level."
GRF_expand_corps:0 "Expand the Ranger Corps"
GRF_expand_corps_desc:0 "The introduction of the Ranger Corps turned out to be a giant success. The combat potential of our army has been greatly increased thanks to these brave griffons. We need to play to our strengths by expanding the corps."
GRF_reserveist_system:0 "Implement The Reservist System"
GRF_reserveist_system_desc:0 "As griffons we need to remember that we are surrounded by creatures of different races and cultures - they will never fully trust us. That's why we need to implement a special system of emergency military service in case of an external military threat."
GRF_armoury_system:0 "Standardised Armouries"
GRF_armoury_system_desc:0 "Our arms industry has fallen behind compared to those of larger Equus countries. We need to create more military factories designed to produce large amounts of modern equipment."
GRF_finish_reforms:0 "The Finest Army On Equus"
GRF_finish_reforms_desc:0 "Finally, after years of bold reforms we managed to create an effective and powerful military force. Glory to the Nova Griffonian Army, the Shield of Griffonkind on Equus!"

GRF_state_airforce:0 "The Nova Griffonian Air Force" 
GRF_state_airforce_desc:0 "The state of our current air corps is embarrassing to griffonkind. We must modernise our air force and reclaim the skies!"
GRF_strat_destruction:0 "Bomb Them To Tartarus"
GRF_strat_destruction_desc:0 "The only way to truly break an enemy is to break their will, break their morale and ruin their spirit. To hear the enemy planes bombing you to Tartarus as the soldiers rush at you, feeling the shrapnel go through your skull and break your bones. This is the warfare of the future."
GRF_air_superior:0 "Control The Skies"
GRF_air_superior_desc:0 "In combined arms warfare it is just as important to control the air as it is to control the ground, aerial support for the ground army paves the way for them to push into the enemy lines, while breaking enemy pushes with aerial bombardment and close air support. This is the warfare of the future."
GRF_operational_integrit:0 "Operational Integrity"
GRF_operational_integrit_desc:0 "Combining the griffon, the tank and the plane. We must train our troops and drill into them a cooperation between branches that they will never forget. To defeat our ever improving opponents we ourselves must improve and keep to the times, get ahead of the curve and defeat them. This is the warfare of the future."
GRF_expand_airbases:0 "A Nation of Airfields"
GRF_expand_airbases_desc:0 "We could have all the planes in the world, but with no runways to fly those from they are useless. The new airfields will stretch all across Nova Griffonia, from Weter to Federstadt, we will control the skies with all our might."
GRF_strat_bombers_focus:0 "Strategic Bombing"
GRF_strat_bombers_focus_desc:0 "We could easily waste thousands of bombs destroying every inch of our enemies, breaking their homes, workplaces and stores. But this is only a waste of potential. Bombing specific industrial sectors, fortifications and roads, combined with aerial support for our army will make the enemy buckle under our pressure."
GRF_tact_bombers_focus:0 "Develop Long Range Bombers"
GRF_tact_bombers_focus_desc:0 "To bomb our enemies we must reach them first, if we are to fight a large nation more powerful than us we must be able to use our planes. So to do this we shall make our finest scientists find new technology for long-range aerial bombardment."
GRF_jets:0 "Jet Experiments"
GRF_jets_desc:0 "Yet all know that in flight, speed is key. Reaching our enemies shores, bombarding their industries, shooting down their fighters. For this we will need new technology, which outpaces our enemies in leaps and bounds. Jet technology is strapping a rocket to a plane and hoping it doesn't explode. Can't be that complicated, can it?"
GRF_close_air_support_focus:0 "Aerial Ground Support"
GRF_close_air_support_focus_desc:0 "With close air support our troops will have all the help they need, their enemies mowed down by a fighter's turret, their artillery wracked by aerial barrages and the enemy's morale lowered as they hear the din of our engines, but not their own."
GRF_paratroopers:0 "The Skyhawks Elite"
GRF_paratroopers_desc:0 "We can invade our enemies through land, through the seas or now as the scientists tell us. Through the air! Giving our griffons parachutes and having them jump off of transport planes. Landing in enemy territory, taking their airfields and forts, striking them from behind before they even know what hit them."
GRF_fighter_focus:0 "Develop Fighter Craft"
GRF_fighter_focus_desc:0 "To control the air we must have fighters to hold it, the newest technology and the strongest of turrets. We must have wings of aluminium and pilots with hearts of steel. We will control the sky, there is no doubt."
GRF_heavy_fighter_focus:0 "Heavy Fighter Craft"
GRF_heavy_fighter_focus_desc:0 "While fighters are powerful things, they are light and soft. So, what better way to counter this than to make our own heavy fighters, turning our enemies' planes to dust and destroying their bombers?"
GRF_rule_the_skies:0 "The Kings of The Skies"
GRF_rule_the_skies_desc:0 "The griffon has been the king of the sky for as long as the world can remember and now we have reasserted our position as the kings of the sky. This time, however, with the help of technology. We have become a great aerial power that will find no match against our enemies. Truly, we have done a good job here."

GRF_state_navy:0 "The Nova Griffonian Navy"
GRF_state_navy_desc:0 "For too long our Navy has been getting the short end of the stick, and as such has been left in a dismal sate. We must improve our naval power!"
GRF_cat_base_strike_f:0 "Base-Strike Doctrine"
GRF_cat_base_strike_f_desc:0 "The Base-Strike Doctrine is simple, if we destroy our enemies' fleets while they are still at base they will be easily sunk to the bottom of the sea."
GRF_carrier_f:0 "Carrier Experiments"
GRF_carrier_f_desc:0 "The Aircraft Carrier has been a concept thrown around by our leading naval theorists for years. The idea of a ship designed for sea based airfields is tantalizing though expensive. But it is finally time to invest in this idea."
GRF_naval_aviation_f:0 "Naval Aviation Department"
GRF_naval_aviation_f_desc:0 "The naval bomber is a fine idea, a plane designed specifically for bombing our enemies' fleets into the depths of the sea, never to be found again."
GRF_cat_fleet_in_being_f:0 "Old School Tactics"
GRF_cat_fleet_in_being_f_desc:0 "The old naval doctrine has worked fine for us for many years, with its focus on large ships to project power. A fleet of the finest battleships, a massive fleet ready for battle at a moment's notice and able to tear a ship in half with one battery!"
GRF_mystic_dock:0 "Construct the Nouvelle Aquila Shipyards"
GRF_mystic_dock_desc:0 "We cannot have a proper navy if we do not have dockyards to build it, but this will be changed with the all new Nouvelle Aquila Shipyards. The perfect place for us to build a new fleet to rival all of our enemies with."
GRF_light_cruiser_f:0 "The Cruiser Squadrons"
GRF_light_cruiser_f_desc:0 "A squadron of cruisers to patrol our seas will be a useful thing indeed, with enough of them supporting our ships we will be able to defeat any enemy that tries to best us."
GRF_battlecruiser_f:0 "Battlecruiser Experiments"

 ### Events ###
 griffons.1.t:0 "Events, Dear Griff, Events"
 griffons.1.d:0 "Teafeather gave a long, exhausted sigh. Today would be long and arduous, and he had just finished three hours of preliminary planning and brainstorming at the Emperor's Head. His critics probably thought his visits to such a humble beerhouse were attempts to boost his reputation, but the reality was that he liked their coffee, and the eighth-century construction gave the establishment a welcoming and homely feel.\n\nThe conclusion he had reached after his seventh beverage was that Nova Griffonia was in dire straits, but far from a lost cause. Institutional rationalisation was on the top of the agenda, then measures to curb the recession, then a fundamental restructuring of the armed forces. That would take about three years, and Teafeather was confidant that, ignoring unusual circumstances, he and the administration could achieve it. But that was the problem – unusual circumstances. The entire world seemed to have taken a turn for the unusual, and this epidemic of chaos was bound to reach Nova Griffonia eventually. For all his strategising, the disruptive power of an unforeseen event remained unbeatable.\n\nPerhaps that was the next step: preparing for the unexpected. Teafeather began drafting a mental list. A corruption scandal or similar blow to the NAK could give the Falcons and socialists an edge. An assassination could spark political violence, regardless of the target. Most troublesome would be an external threat, be it from the wild west, the old continent, or most likely, Stalliongrad. All possibilities, all very concerning. Teafeather added them to the agenda, then got up from his seat.\n\nThen, the world came to a sudden halt.\n\nThe glass next to him shattered as a bullet burrowed its way through his left shoulder and pierced its way through the griffon's torso, the fragments stopping a centimetre from his heart. Screaming echoed around him as Teafeather attempted to process what was happening. He had been shot. That... wasn't ideal. He gave a weak leap away from the window before collapsing below the table, his coffee dripping onto his feathers, dodging a second bullet whizzing into the sofa. A panicked looking waitress hurried over, before Teafeather, seething in pain, shooed her away.\n\n"Get back, get to cover!" The governor barked through pained breaths. "I'm...""
 griffons.1.a:0 ""I'm perfectly fine...""
 
 griffons.2.t:0 "A Long Day in Weter"
 griffons.2.d:0 "As the news of Teafeather's death has spread, the old colony has fallen into utter chaos. A confused anarchy has suffused Weter and is currently infecting the rest of the country. The griffon himself passed away a minute before the ambulance arrived, but the autopsy showed that saving him would have proven extremely difficult, with extensive damage collapsing the left lung. No other creature was hurt.\n\nAlmost as devastating as an assassinated head of state is the fact that the killer has completely alluded us. Beyond the ammunition used, we have no other information on the assassin. For all we know, it could've been a polar bear monarchist, a Vedinan irredentist or simply a griffon who despised the beerhouse and just so happened to hit the head of state. In the absence of evidence, Nova Griffonia's radicals have begun tearing each other apart, with republicans, Falcons and socialist paramilitaries battling in the streets. Law and order has collapsed entirely, with the epidemic of confusion evidently having reached the commanders of the police and militias. What stability the Nashanal Administratyon Kamiti offered has vanished into thin air with its leader gone. It seems the old colony has been plunged into a second crisis in half a century, and whether or not it weathers the storm is anyone's guess."
 griffons.2.a:0 "Can someone tell me what in Tartarus is going on!"
 
 griffons.3.t:0 "Ablaze"
 griffons.3.d:0 "It was a sick irony: No one knew who fired the first shot. What everyone did know was that Marshal Highhill had stormed the chambers of the provisional government as the head of his own personal army. Every representative was stuck up at gunpoint before Highhill yelled, "Freeze, you chicklets, and no one will get hurt! Comply and maybe we will grant you some leniency for not using your powers to the fullest extent so Nova Griffonia may be whole again!"\n\n"And what will you have us do?" a gutsy representative shot back, standing up and revealing the derringer he'd hidden from sight. "Slavishly follow every order you give? Bow our heads for every swaggering move you make as a dictator? Shoot us all and have it your way, 'Marshal,' but you will run this country to the ground with your petulant bullying!"\n\n"And what will YOU have me do? Talk and negotiate in a safe room while Nova Griffonians kill each other outside and—?"\n\nThen a bang, then another shot. Both speakers checked themselves to see if they'd been hit. Nothing. They swiftly turned to the source of the sound: a security officer versus a soldier, both crumpled now and bleeding.\n\nFor a second, there was peace, a time to process what had just happened before angry looks devolved into murderous stares amid the din of a gunfight, and like a conflagration, the violence would spread through the tightly packed Old Griffonian-style districts to the more colonial-looking outskirts. Weter would quickly fall to Highhill, shoving the republicans out to fight another day. The skies had been lit ablaze, for any sense of order had collapsed—any order but for two: the forces of republicanism and the forces of the marshal, locked in a battle for the hearts and souls of what had once been a precious colony."
 griffons.3.a:0 "For the Marshal!"
 griffons.3.b:0 "For the Republic!"
 
 griffons.4.t:0 "The Elections of [GetYear]"
 griffons.4.d:0 "After the scare of Highhill's attempted coup, the political parties of Nova Griffonia have all come together, rallying around the need for democracy, liberty and open and fair eleections for the nation. As Nova Griffonia begins its first grand elections, three parties have coalesced to contend for leadership.\n\nThe first is the Liberal Front, who seeks to largely continue the Teafeather administration's policies to ensure a free market and a stable society. Nova Griffonia is built on commerce, they say, and should continue so.\n\nSecondly is the Nova Griffonian Social Democratic Party, whose party leader worked closely with the old governor and who wishes to rebuild Nova Griffonia into a welfare state with a more restricted approach to market economics.\n\nThe last contender is the Federation of Nova Griffonian Socialist Parties, who despite their radical ideas have sworn respect the democratic process and to abide by the election results. They are seeking to remake Nova Griffonia - democratically - into a socialist state.\n\nThe ballots have been counted and the nation awaits the result with bated breath."

 griffons.13.d:0 "For 200 years we have merely been a colony of the Grand Griffonian Empire, but yet here we stand a bulwark of Griffonkind while the old empire lies in ruin. Here we stand more united then ever while our former countrygriffs shed each others blood in the names of false prophets, and yet we allow these idiots to claim themselves the descendants of our glorious empire! An empire that once spanned continents, an empire that once had millions upon millions of people living under it's glorious banner, but now it is dead, an empire now reduced to rubble. The time has come for us to face the facts; the East is lost, but our empire can rise again... this time in the West."
 griffons.13.a:0 "The Empire lives on!"
 
 griffons.14.t:0 "The New Keyser"
 griffons.14.d:0 "Following his recent coup d'etat, Highhill, newly appointed Leader of Nova Griffonia, has now ordered for him to be officially crowned Emperor of the Griffons. The coronation took place inside the Grand Barracks of the capital, followed up by a speech from Highhill to his subjects and a mighty military parade. "The days of chaos and instability are over," Highhill spoke to his people. "Our nation shall be one of unison, strength and determination. It is time for us to rise up and reclaim our rightful spot on the world stage! It is time to reclaim the honour and glory of the empire!" The speech was followed up by mighty choirs of cheering griffons down in the streets of the capital. Although he seems hot-headed and determined, it is still to see whether he is really to come back on his promises and goals. The world is holding its breath for the time being."
 griffons.14.a:0 "Long live the Keyser!"
 
 griffons.15.t:0 "The New Firer"
 griffons.15.d:0 "Following Highhill's recent coup d'etat, fascist party leader Ironclaw was made leader of the griffons. Unsurprisingly, he and his followers would not be satisfied with the election result itself, and it was today announced that the griffons had given absolute power to their leader, including rule by decree. Many hundreds of griffons arrived to see the spectacle. A marching band of over 2000 soldiers commenced the ceremony, followed up by a speech from Ironclaw himself after which he then declared himself Firer. "Today is our day," Ironclaw said in his speech. "Today is the day we rid ourselves from the corrupt, degenerate and weak democracy that has been plaguing our beautiful country. Today we look forward eagerly. A new, bright future awaits us! Our destiny awaits us!" The griffons' neighbours have visibly been growing nervous over these recent developments, and the world as a whole will have to look out for a stronger, united griffon folk. We shall watch how this situation develops."

Many hundreds of griffons arrived to see the spectacle. A marching band of over 2000 soldiers commenced the ceremony, followed up by a speech from Ironclaw himself after which he then declared himself Firer. "Today is our day," Ironclaw said in his speech. "Today is the day we rid ourselves from the corrupt, degenerate and weak democracy that has been plaguing our beautiful country. Today we look forward eagerly. A new, bright future awaits us! Our destiny awaits us!" The griffons' neighbours have visibly been growing nervous over these recent developments, and the world as a whole will have to look out for a stronger, united griffon folk. We shall watch how this situation develops."

 griffons.21.t:0 "Highhill's Criticism" #Ardent
 griffons.21.d:0 "Even with the previous Governor gone, his close friend and former military governor, Highhill, still causes headaches for our Provisional Government. The old Field Marshal actively takes to criticizing our attempts to restore order throughout the country instead of actually helping. Topping it all, Highhill openly displays the nerve to preen his words with flagrant insults to everygriffon in the administration!\n\nHow this decrepit griffon who dare calls this Provisional Government an "idiotic flock of headless chickens" retains the respect of most in the military is ludicrous, almost as ludicrous as the new rumors of him plotting a coup. That information would be concerning... if it was not contradicted by Highhill dedicating all his energy and time toward conjuring up new phrases to insult us with.\n\nThe Provisional Government only needs to put up with the Field Marshal's verbal abuse until the griffon eventually tires himself out, but the ordeal will be a headache regardless."

Several members of the FfIfG and even the infamous Falcons of Griffonstone have taken it upon themselves to open several soup kitchens in an effort to feed the poor. Why they've done this can only be speculated upon, but to most it is welcome to see that even in these dark times some basic kindness can still be found in the most unexpected places."

The more zealous members of each side took it upon themselves to violently clash in the middle of Weter, resulting in a heap of collateral.\n\nDeaths number in the several dozen, hundreds remain injured, and the worst of this is the damage in Weter totaling over hundreds of thousands in bits!\n\nHow can the official representatives of these two sides even hope to have say in the Provisional Government when this debacle shows what little say they hold over their rampant constituents?"

As a day ago Field Marshal Highhill marched upon the governmental palace at the front of a column of soldiers and proceeded to dissolve the Provisional Government.

Public support for this war is already very low, so we must finish this up before our people rise up against us, or even worse, join these rebels.

 griffons.283.d:0 "Rusty Bucket was no longer an obstacle, even if the pony archeologist felt sorry for him. Climbing up a large pile of snow, all of them could easily get up to the mountain and begin the ascent. As the six had said, they had little trouble climbing up the cliffs, but Abram had to carry the pony on his back. The winds were strong yet they held on, working together to get up the rocks without falling. It took them many hours, but they finally reached the summit, only to find a wide, windy chasm. On the other side was another snowy peak, with a frozen path leading up to a cavern.\n\nThe six and one debated how to get across. The wind was strong and the distance was long. In the end, it was the pony who provided the solution to the problem."

 griffons.36.t:0 "An Offer To Join The Northern Bloc"
 griffons.36.d:0 "We have been approached by a griffon envoy from the nation of Nova Griffonia. The diplomats speak of offering our nation the chance to join the Northern Bloc, a democratic union which promotes the basic rights of every individual. They mention a wide variety of plans, plans such as collaborative technological pursuits, an industrial development initiative, and several military drills that can be planned and implemented in the future.\n\nDo we accept, or do we decline? We may not see another proposal like this again."
 griffons.36.a:0 "We see no reason to decline this offer."
 griffons.36.b:0 "We see nothing to gain from this.\nWe must decline."
 
 griffons.37.t:0 "Member State Of The Northern Bloc"
 griffons.37.d:0 "Now a member state of the Northern Bloc, we stand to gain from our new-found allies and friends. Many great things await us down the path of cooperation, we were wise to accept their offer."
 griffons.37.a:0 "To a long and prosperous future!"
 
 griffons.38.t:0 "An Offer Refused"
 griffons.38.d:0 "Diplomatic or cultural differences have lead us to declining the offer to join the Northern Bloc. Cooperation simply wasn't possible between out nations, so we must simply observe the consequences of our decision."
 griffons.38.a:0 "It is a shame, but it never would have worked."
 
 griffons.39.t:0 "A Difficult Choice"
 griffons.39.d:0 "Nova Griffonia has given us an ultimatum, we must either accept their terms and integrate into the nation, or we can resist and get "crushed under their talons" as they put it. Nova Griffonia seems eager to honour this promise though, choose wisely."
 griffons.39.a:0 "We must accept these terms, we can stand to lose everything."
 griffons.39.b:0 "Never! We will not let ourselves be bullied into submission by them!"
 
 griffons.40.t:0 "The Integration of the Frontier"
 griffons.40.d:0 "Virgil has given in to our demands.\n\nThe Frontier will undergo a process of integration that should see the banditry and lawlessness eradicated from those lands. The Frontier was a mistake that should have been dealt with sooner."
 griffons.40.a:0 "We are glad we could end this issue peacefully."
 
 griffons.41.t:0 "The Frontier Resists"
 griffons.41.d:0 "Virgil did not take our threat as seriously as we thought he would. We can follow through with our promise, or simply turn the blind eye and pretend they don't exist.\n\nWe must advise against the latter option however, as public opinion would plummet dramatically in response to our sudden change of mind."

 griffons.45.t:0 "Village Up North Successfully Captured"
 griffons.45.d:0 "In a great achievement for our colony our troops have forced out the Equestrians stationed in the State Up North. While the fleeing Equestrian transport ships sailed over the horizon our troops moved into the Village Up North, the townsfolk looking on in fear as the engines of the Nova Griffonian war machine rolled past. To alleviate their concerns many pony troops were given leave to talk up how much better life is under our flag than that of the warring Equestrians, and by the end of the day at least some of the populace have decided to give our government a shot. It is unknown how the proposed plan to rename the city will affect this, but at the moment it is still only a proposal."
 griffons.45.a:0 "They will all soon be fully [Root.GetAdjective]."

 griffons.46.t:0 "Ponies Beat Back Our Bid"
 griffons.46.d:0 "For many years the populace of [Root.GetName] considered the Equestrian city rather precisely named Village Up North to be rightfully part of their territory. Unfortunately, our hopes to use the recent civil war in Equestria to take control of this territory has failed. After a long and brutal border battle the Equestrian contingent in the State Up North was able to hold on long enough for the general in command to break off the attack in accordance with the previously agreed upon plan. Our diplomats will now try to play down the event while our press secretary for the people."

 griffons.47.t:0 "Stalemate on the Border"
 griffons.47.d:0 "Recently, an attack was made across the border by units of the griffon military into Equestria's territory of State Up North. Units from the Equestrian military intercepted them, but while the battle raged for several hours at the end of the day casualties were minor and the outcome indecisive. It looks like the current state of affairs will remain the same up north, which is good news for Equestria and allows them to focus more of their attention on their ongoing civil war."
 griffons.47.a:0 "The more things change, the more they stay the same."

 griffons.48.t:0 "[Root.GetName] Stands Strong in the North"
 griffons.48.d:0 "In a small bright spot in a sea of sorrow, our troops in the northernmost part of the nation have held back an attack by griffon troops who attempted to seize the city of Village Up North. The commander in charge has been sighted for heroism, and so have several soldiers under his command. In this time when everything seems to be falling apart this news shall surely boost morale."
 griffons.48.a:0 "Heroes, one and all."

 griffons.49.t:0 "Northernmost Point Captured by Griffonians"
 griffons.49.d:0 "In one more shameful event among many shameful events of late, the Village Up North, once famous for being the northernmost point of the nation, was seized by griffon troops following an intense border skirmish that left many on both sides dead. The local commander felt that his position would soon be overrun, and so ordered all troops to evacuate the state. He justified his position by stating that his supplies were threatened with being cut off, and that his troops could be put to far better use on the mainland."
 griffons.49.a:0 "Another landmark lost to the flames of war."

 griffons.50.t:0 "The Long March"
 griffons.50.d:0 "All the way from Weter, our troops marched onwards towards the northwest. As our forces reached the hills, communist guerrillas began skirmishing the exhausted troops, but all was not lost. Highhill rallied the soldiers and lead them on a counterattack which broke the spirit of the terrorists in no time. Soon enough the hills and mountains were cleansed of communist scum. Victory is ours, at least this day."
 griffons.50.a:0 "It's a long way to the Kingsmare..."
 
 griffons.51.t:0 "The Skirmish at Guidonuovo"
 griffons.51.d:0 "The communist-controlled town of Guidonuovo was an important center of rebellion. Here the red flag was raised first, as soon as news of the coup arrived, and the local garrison expelled after a fierce battle. It had since become a fortified bastion of socialism which would not fall easily. Highhill knew he had to be cunning to avoid a costly siege.\n\nOur troops marched through local forests during the night, hiding their advance until revealing themselves just outside the city. It was not a pleasant experience for anyone involved and a group of soldiers were even ambushed by an Ursa Major. However, it was all worth it as they emerged out of the forest at dawn, arriving from a direction which had been left completely undefended. The reds had no time to prepare and organise a response and the city was quickly taken by our brave soldiers. Once more, we have defeated these vile traitors!"
 griffons.51.a:0 "Send the prisoners to the camps!"
 
 griffons.52.t:0 "The Pacification of Kluv Valley"
 griffons.52.d:0 "After the coup, communist partisans joined forces with local yak insurgents in Kluv Valley, promising to recognize them as equal citizens of Nova Griffonia if they aided them. The local yak populace has long been a thorn on our side and this only proves that thorn should've been removed before it was too late.\n\nHighhill's forces first occupied the hills and mountains surrounding the valley which the rebels had foolishly left undefended. Then he brought in his artillery to rain fires of Tartarus upon the unprepared enemy. With fierce fire support, the infantry easily shattered pockets of resistance and took thousands of prisoners. Yaks, however, proved to be resilient fighters who stubbornly refused to surrender. After heavy casualties they were finally driven across the border into Jakistan."
 griffons.52.a:0 "We've got those bastards on the run!"
 
 griffons.53.t:0 "The Battle at the Kingsmare"
 griffons.53.d:0 "A clash between two gigantic forces, ours and that of the communists, took place on the shores of the Kingsmare lake to our northwest.\n\nWhat was initially a skirmish developed into an all-out battle, with artillery and airplanes. Griffons, both loyalist and communist, perished on the battlefield by the hundreds. Although the casualties were high, the reds were the ones to sound the retreat at the end of the day. Our fighters mowed them down without mercy as they tried to escape by running and flying."
 griffons.53.a:0 "The Kingsmare is ours!"
 
 griffons.54.t:0 "Up the Beak Mountains"
 griffons.54.d:0 "By using old, largely forgotten mountain paths, a small detachment of troops managed to sneak past several republican patrols. They managed to make their way into the camp of the rebels, which were defended by a small force. A shootout quickly turned into a lengthy skirmish with traior guerrillas as enemy reinforcements arrived. The mountainous terrain did not favour our troops in any way, but through sheer willpower, valiant effort and Highhill's leadership, our troops pushed ever onwards and eventually captured the camp and its supplies, which caused the rebels who were left to surrender."
 griffons.54.a:0 "It was a tough battle..."
 
 griffons.55.t:0 "The Battle for the North"
 griffons.55.d:0 "Our troops marched north, aiming to reclaim the frigid fjords and mountains from the traitors. It did not take long for them to engage in a series of small battles with the local resistance. The rebels pulled back before ambushing our troops once more, then pulling back again. This would repeat at least five times before the enemy finally dispersed for good, but the casualties are truly something to be mourned."
 griffons.55.a:0 "What a pain."
 
 griffons.56.t:0 "The Battle of Ny Winghagen"
 griffons.56.d:0 "The coastal city of Ny Winghagen, an old settlement that had always had republican sentiment, had been taken by rebel troops after Highhill's coup. They had celebrated Kemerskai's "liberation" of their old homeland decades ago and continued to advocate the establishment of a Nova Griffonian republic.\n\nThat nonsense ended today when our troops tore down the republican tricolour from the flagpole at the center of Ny Winghagen. The fighting had been some of the fiercest yet, but, after taking many casualties during the urban fighting in the city, the troops managed to secure each building. The democratic rebels who remained alive were scattered into a retreat.\n\nWhile this is a great victory, it foreshadows the fighting soon to occur in the city of Nouvelle Aquila, not far from Ny Winghagen."
 griffons.56.a:0 "We're almost there..."
 
 griffons.57.t:0 "The Battle for Nouvelle Aquila"
 griffons.57.d:0 "It was a bloodbath, indeed.\n\nThe republican defences in and around Nouvelle Aquila were a deadly obstacle. The city itself was the capital of the NGDF, who saw it as the Nova Griffonian beacon of democracy. After the counter-revolution in Aquileia many years ago, the King had exiled thousands of republicans here, and they had not abandoned their pathetic ideology since. Many of them saw the current unrest as an opportunity to redeem themselves by overthrowing the government and establishing a republic, like they had done in 980.\n\nArtillery howled in the deep of the night, shelling enemy foxholes and barricades in the suburbs. Then, shortly after, the first assault battalions engaged. Machine guns sang and rifles barked. The occasional muzzle flash from the enemy's guns was all the soldiers could aim for during those late hours. And although the casualties were greater than expected, our troops overran the outer defences.\n\nLater, at sunrise, a renewed barrage of high-explosive shells bombarded the city itself. Windows shattered, roofs caved in, fires took hold of a quarter of the city. The rebel troops, discouraged by this, held on by a thread. By the time our troops engaged them in close-quarters combat, even melee combat in some cases. Though their resistance was fierce, they were soon made to surrender.\n\nThe day is ours, and the voice of democracy has been silenced for good."
 griffons.57.a:0 "A costly victory."
 
 griffons.58.t:0 "The End of the Civil War"
 griffons.58.d:0 "After many months, and plenty of skirmishes and battles, we have come out on top and defeated those who wished to depose our rightful government. We have restored order and justice in Nova Griffonia, and it is now time to march onwards! A new government will be formed under the watchful eye of Erwin Highhill, the hero of the conflict. He will ensure it will be a strong and united one, free from deviant and destabilising communism and democracy. However, Reyhard Ironclaw proved himself to be a charismatic and fierce leader during the fighting, gaining popular support in the process and swelling the ranks of his party. None can also deny that Skeiron Goldfeather's industries fueled the war effort and enabled us to gain victory. Now there are whispers that Ironclaw is planning to seize power and Skeiron seeks to bribe Highhill and become the leader of a truly free Nova Griffonia. Whatever the case, a new government must be organized soon, lest Nova Griffonia falls into chaos again."
 griffons.58.a:0 "Let none question our rule!"
 
 griffons.59.t:0 "The Falcons Dispersed"
 griffons.59.d:0 "The FfIfG, or Party of Griffon Interests, is a relatively well-known radical movement, which aims to further only griffon interests while abandoning other species entirely, and leaving behind the weak-minded and weak-bodied.\n\nAdditionally, this party has long had a unofficial paramilitary wing: The Falcons of Griffonstone. Though they are in the service of the party, many see them as nothing but thugs, thiefs and simple criminals. We must make it clear that we do not allow these types of movements in our nation, anymore. Their organisation must be banned at once, and the members prosecuted accordingly."
 griffons.59.a:0 "I never liked those bastards anyway."
 
 griffons.60.t:0 "The Wildcard"
 griffons.60.d:0 "The Civil war has ended, but the nation is still undecided on what to do now. Erwin Highhill appears as the obvious answer, having lead us through the civil war, though also having caused the civil war in the first place. Reyhard Ironclaw of the FfIfG is also very keen on seizing power himself, in order to establish a totalitarian state.\n\nSkeiron Goldfeather, the richest Griffon in Nova Griffonia and the leading economic advisor, can only laugh at these two. He knows that true power doesn't come from controlling the citizens of the state, and enforcing ridiculous laws and regulations, but rather the opposite. Goldfeather knows that money is the only thing that can make any Griffon happy, and that with enough money in one's pockets, you could achieve just about anything.\n\nAfter a few backdoor talks, and a very, very generous donation, Highhill has dissolved the military junta, and has declared Skeiron Goldfeather as the new head of state. The nation now awaits what Goldfeather, a rather unknown dark figure to many, has planned."
 griffons.60.a:0 "We're open for business!"
 
 griffons.61.t:0 "The March of the Falcons"
 griffons.61.d:0 "Today was the day. When the Civil War ended, Reyhard Ironclaw and all party members of the FfIfG knew that this was their only shot at seizing power, when Highhill was weakest.\n\nThe Falcons of Griffonstone, the infamous militant wing of the FfIfG, gathered outside Weter today, and with Ironclaw leading them, they marched onwards. The City's inhabitants were stunned. The local police could do nothing against this march with their few numbers, and many officers fled the city in fear.\n\nIn the end, Ironclaw and his lackeys seized power and arrested Highhill. A new Order shall rise, under a new leadership."

And yet, one of the guests were quite not like the ones usually received by the new Governor. Indeed, Blackpeak's guest wasn't dressed in any ornate clothes, or even something that didn't have any patches. The Red Eagle, Redtail had come for dinner. \n\n"I might prefer the simple diet of a worker, but even I can enjoy a good meal and a good glass of wine," Redtail said as he sipped a glass of Marelandian red wine. \n\nBlackpeak himself sipped another glass of wine, looking to Redtail "I am happy that it falls in your taste. Now, I wanted to talk to you about the new ideas we have for the country." \n\nRedtail glared at Blackpeak. "Yes, I've heard of it. I hope you're not planning that extensive a societal wrecking." \n\n"We do a bit on the side. But we are open to compromise, should the opportunity arise," Blackpeak mused as he chewed on a piece of steak. \n\nRedtail studied Blackpeak's facial expressions "Hm?" \n\n"We want to compromise. I'm not some sort of dogmatic idiot," Blackpeak muttered as he indulged in another glass of wine. \n\n"Aha. And your big manifesto?" Redtail deadpanned. \n\n"Flexible," Blackpeak said.\n\nRedtail stared for a second on Blackpeak "I'm sure we can agree on something. But first, let us eat.""

 griffons.75.t:0 "Cutting The Red Tape"
 griffons.75.d:0 "Many times, Nova Griffonia's bureaucracy grew up organically. New challenges arose for the colony, and the administration solved the issues where they arose. It is an understandable method to approach things, but it has left the bureaucracy of the nation bloated in several areas. After a thorough review, the issues found includes but are not limited to\n\n-A department for the establishment of a proper Nova Griffonian presence around the Kingsmare (achieved twenty years ago and leaving a pack of bureaucrats twiddling their claws and earning paychecks)\n-Six different forms for requesting monetary aid for infrastructure projects(Including one which was grandfathered in from the Empire pre-colonization)\n-Two separate auditing departments(neither of which had the mandates needed to effectively carry out its duties)\n-Four offices found in a downward spiral of requesting forms from each other(Forms which requested other forms, which in return would request the original form from the correspondent)\n\nIt was known that the bureaucracy needed to be cleaned up, but few expected it was quite this bad. Nevertheless, the process of cutting down on these superfluous departments and offices has proceeded with good speed, and the apparatus of state is already starting to flow more smoothly than before."

 griffons.76.t:0 "Our New Friends"  
 griffons.76.d:0 "In a public event, the council of Nova Griffonia, along with representatives from the "Landorganizatsye", the umbrella organization for the Nova Griffonian labor unions, has officially signed into effect the "Zaltsimvane agreement", under which the government has outlawed strikebreakers, lockouts and guaranteed sweeping labor rights for all workers in Nova Griffonia, no matter where.\n\nIn return, the Landorganizatsye have agreed to forbid its members from going on strikes unless negotiations have been carried out, as well as formalize the process of salary negotiation and collective bargaining.\n\nThe Council's laws could have paralysed the employers' ability to handle striking without capitulating, and the Landorganizatsye's promises in many areas neutered them. Yet, put these two things together and the framework has been laid for labour relations ruled not by antagonism, but by concord."

 griffons.77.d:0 "The NGSDF and FfNGSP have much in common, not the least their appreciation for the democratic process, but they also are different in many areas. Not the least the NGSDF's quiet endorsement of the capitalist system has been a source of friction between the two parties, and conversely, many in the NGSDF view the FfNGSP as too radical.\n\nYet, the time comes where one must put on the adult hat and work for the betterment of all. For the last few days, the parties have been in intense negotiations to find a path forward that can be satisfactory for both sides, where the FfNGSP can count on aid in the council from the NGSDF.\n\nThe details are numerous and the minutiae doubly so, but after nearly two weeks, the two parties have announced that they have reached a mutually satisfactory arrangement. From now on, the communists can count on the aid of the Social Democrats in order to execute their policies."

 griffons.78.d:0 "In order to move democracy closer to the people and avoid any risk of turning Nova Griffonia into an autocracy, a grand project has begun to implement public referendums to help guide the nation alongside the council. It will be ambitious, but the foundation of the nation's power is its people and thus the will should be well and truly represented even in the day to day affairs of policy and lawmaking, not just in the few months before the elections.\n\nImplementing this system on a nation as vast and sometimes empty as Nova Griffonia will be a challenge, but it is a challenge that spurs us to action. Distant villages will receive telephone lines and so that they can more easily be informed of the referendums and to inform of their results, the larger towns will build assembly halls so that the people have somewhere to gather, and our system for counting ballots will be updated. It will be a lot of work, but it is an exciting challenge, and the people are cheering for the right that is now given back to them."

 ### New events for BoP and soft rework stuff ###
 griffons.88.t:0 "First Snow" 
 griffons.88.d:0 ""We won't work, it's as easy as that!" the strikeleader's voice hissed out like steam against the winter air. He hovered above the gathered crowd, a hundred or so workers who blocked the entrance of Weter Electronics.\n\n"We won't work for substandard wages! We won't work ourselves to death! We won't work until we're given the respect we deserve! Fair pay-" he roared through the din of the agreeing crowd, "for fair work!"\n\nThe policegriffs were nervous. The energy in the street was rising, angry and resentful. These griffs had suffered economic downturn after economic downturn. Now they weathered the worst of it- the most affected, the least thought of. They were tired, and looking for a release. All the officers there knew better than to add onto it. All but one. He was stationed at the picket line itself. Looking out at the sea of malcontents he scoffed and muttered to himself, "Lazy bastards..."\n\nInstantly a head from the crowd whipped back to that officer. "What'd you say?" said a thin, reedy white griffon. The officer bit his tongue. "No, no, say that again-" he stormed closer to the officer. When no answer came he shoved him in a blind rage. "SAY THAT AGAIN, YOU-" He was tackled to the ground by another officer, and arrested on the spot.\n\nTartarus let loose.\n\nGriffons scattered. The strikeleader screeched incomprehensibly in the cacophony. Here a griffon cursed as he was restrained, there one tackled an officer so that another could escape. Sirens wailed in the distance. Yelling. Pushing. Shoving. Clawing. The noise was endless.\n\nThese same scenes exploded across Nova Griffonia. The great general strike, the unified front for the workers of the nation, devolved into a spectacle of frustration and violence." 
 griffons.88.a:0 "This is just the beginning."
 
 griffons.89.t:0 "Strikes in Nouveau Aquileia!"
 griffons.89.d:0 "Teafeather sighed deeply as he looked at the reports scattering his desk. Nouveau Aquileia's workers were making demands, and they refused to back down from them. This was his most pressing concern. Or, it was, before Highhill had burst into his office.\n\n"It's anarchy out there, Teafeather. Pure bloody chaos, the lot of it." Highhill paced in front of him, occasionally stopping to gesticulate, as if he was orating to an audience. "You've made your bed now. All that faff about not giving my army its bits is biting your tail. We could have swept the streets by now, brought back order, but those damn Stallionites are keeping my griffs busy- can't even do that!" Each word brought more venom than the last.\n\n"Alright, Erwin. It seems you have all the answers. What would you do?" Teafeather asked, deadpan. Highhill opened his beak, but he interrupted him once more. "And if you say you want a bigger budget I will end this conversation right now."\n\nThe marshal scoffed, but then straightened himself up and adjusted his collar. "You know Ironclaw, don't you? Stand-up fellow. He has friends of his own. Not very stand up ones, but they're reliable griffs. Griffs in enforcement. Bring them in, let them take care of those- miscreants, and the matter will be solved. Simple. How does that sound?"\n\nTeafeather frowned. It would certainly take care of the 'problem'. But it was a crude solution. Perhaps it was necessary, but it didn't sit well with him to treat griffons like that during a crisis. He looked at the report once more, and sighed again."
 griffons.89.a:0 ""Fine. Get Ironclaw to help. But do not let him go too far.""
 griffons.89.b:0 ""We cannot beat our problems into submission. You are dismissed.""
 
 griffons.90.t:0 "The Two Harmonists"
 griffons.90.d:0 ""You cannot just buy a workers dignity!" Silverwing snapped.\n\n"It would be a start. We won't get anywhere with just promises," Triton raised his beak high, glaring down at the pink griffon.\n\nIf Teafeather thought talking to two self-professed harmonists would lead to less headaches, he was proved sorely wrong. They seemed to disagree on the very principles on how to solve the worker's strike. The demands were simple: A full raise for all employees, and increased union representation within the company. But the governor couldn't force both through, not with everything else that demanded his attention.\n\nTriton rolled his eyes, as if talking to a chick. "We need to pay them now so they can get back to work. If we need to take from the national treasury, then so be it. But production is already at an all-time low- we need to stop what we can by any means necessary!"\n\n"Is that so? Why don't you pay them out of your own pocket?" Silverwing snapped, causing Triton to let out an offended squawk. He ignored him, and turned to Teafeather with a resolute expression. "There are strikes because there is no trust between us and the workers. A raise is only temporary. We need to show them that we are listening by empowering their union. They will work with us instead of against us, then."\n\nThe former officer gulped as he finished his speech. Both griffons looked at him, anticipating his decision."
 griffons.90.a:0 ""We need to get them back to work as soon as possible. Triton, get a check ready.""
 griffons.90.b:0 ""Silverwing is correct. He will take over the negotiations.""
 
 griffons.91.t:0 "Riot In Zerkshed Skall!"
 griffons.91.d:0 ""Goldfeather."\n\n"Teafeather."\n\nThe two griffons glared at each other. Though they were in the governor's office, Teafeather felt disconcerted by the sight of the little white griffon. "I did not expect to see you. To what do I owe the pleasure?" he said in a cool voice.\n\nGoldfeather smiled. Though his tone was light, there was a palpable, barely concealed rage in his voice. "The communist scum have taken over my railway, mostly. I just swung on by to get your permission to scatter the bastards away. I was just about to hire strikebreakers too, but then I remembered that would undermine your authority in this wonderful administration you have running. And you know how much I'd hate to step on your claws." His voice dripped with faux-sincerity.\n\nTeafeather frowned. He had just gotten the reports from the city that morning. A coalition of workers led by Heinrich Redtail had demanded for immediate control of the railway and all its assets to the local union. The demand itself was peaceful, but the ensuing tensions had boiled over to city-wide riots. The local militia had its claws full.\n\n"I'm glad you came to me," he said after some thought, "Because such an action would have been completely out of your purview. Especially with negotiations still underway."\n\n"Negotiations? You are seriously considering their outrageous demands?!" Goldfeather scoffed, "Listen to yourself- this red disease cannot be reasoned with! We need to break them now or else it'll be Severyana all over again!"\n\nThe governor steeled his gaze."
 griffons.91.a:0 ""...you may have a point. Strikebreakers, was it?""
 griffons.91.b:0 ""Peace requires compromise, Goldfeather. It is best if you accept that now.""
 
 griffons.92.t:0 "Miner's Strike In Weter!"
 griffons.92.d:0 "Never before in all of Teafeather's years as governor had he felt the urge to drink on the job. But now, crisis after crisis, he almost gave in to the temptation. Especially with the miners in Weter going on strike. If he strained his hearing, he could almost make out their chanting outside.\n\nOf course, it didn't help that Highhill was on his case again. "It's easy, Teafeather, the easiest thing you'll ever have to do!", he was saying, continuing from some tangent he had tried very hard to disregard. "Just- get me in there. I'll go there myself, I'll grab a company or two. We'll show them the stocks of our rifles, push them around some, and throw some bits their way. It's perfect! They get what the want, and they'll know Weter's not the place to pull this stunt!"\n\nTeafeather did not share the marshal's enthusiasm. The workers wanted a liveable salary, not the paltry minimum wage the mining company had set. As always, Highhill's solution was fast, easy, and crude. These days, he found himself wondering if things would ever go back to how they were.\n\nTeafeather exhaled deeply through his nose and pinched the bridge of his beak."
 griffons.92.a:0 ""Gods, Highhill, fine. You take care of it.""
 griffons.92.b:0 ""Stop. I will talk to the company, maybe we can still reach an accord with the workers.""
 
 griffons.93.t:0 "A Simple Decision"
 griffons.93.d:0 "Highhill popped open the vintage without much fanfare, and filled his wine glass to the brim. "Aquileians are a bunch of chickens," he roughly set the bottle down, spilling some wine onto the table, "but this stuff is great!"\n\nTeafeather chuckled, "What happened to whiskey?" He nursed a cup of coffee in his talons. He preferred not to indulge. Besides, today marked a rare moment of respite through this hellish crisis, and he wanted to face it properly with his friend. He smiled to himself at that, friend! It was so easy to forget when the marshal insisted on being so difficult on the job.\n\n"I'm tired of it! It all tastes the same. Now, this?" Highhill took what was a careful sip for him, "I was a bloody idiot!"\n\n"You better not be fantasizing about opening a vineyard- don't give me that look, I remember your distillery adventure!"\n\n"Well, I don't see why not. We've already got a city, why not take their damn wine too? Just think: all we need is to go out to the country, hire a few farmers-" Highhill stopped abruptly, then snapped his claws. "This reminds me!"\n\nThe governor sighed, "Don't tell me there's been a revolt."\n\n"Nothing like that! But you know me. I've got soldiers posted over in the country, and they've been telling me griffs out there are scared. So I got to thinking, it would be great if I went out and showed them that Highhill's there for them." He pounded his chest with a claw, "That my griffs are there to protect them, and no mess from the cities will spill out! Ah, but you need paperwork to get anything done these days. So, I ask you now. How about it?"\n\nTeafeather laughed and shook his head. And here he thought there was some kind of disaster!"
 griffons.93.a:0 ""Go ahead, friend! Let the countryfolk be at ease.""
 griffons.93.b:0 ""Thank you, Highhill. But for this, please let me take care of it. You're doing enough as is.""
 
 griffons.94.t:0 "Dampened Flames"
 griffons.94.d:0 "To say that Teafeather had been stressed lately would be putting it mildly. For the governor, being in office felt like trying to stay the course in the middle of a hurricane. He could do his best to weather the storm, and keep his crew safe, but he could do nothing to fight against its destruction. He could not show it, of course, but every morning he dreaded seeing the papers pile up on his desk. Those were the news bulletins, the reports and missives from all corners of Nova Griffonia explaining to him in great detail how dire the situation was. A riot here, a protest there, a murder he needed his griffs to investigate, the list always went on and on. And always, despite the nagging thought in the back of his mind that told him it would be for naught, he worked to resolve it.\n\nIt was with this mindset that he began his morning. As Teafeather rifled through his daily reports, however, his expression softened. There were still fires to put out, it was nothing as miraculous as a stop-gap in the chaos, but there was something different. In plain black-and-white he read about griffs going back to work, mining towns cooling their tempers, the economy stopping its freefall in its tracks to something manageable. It seemed that for once, things were going well.\n\nThe governor let himself smile. That fateful strike, it seemed, was not the spark of the second revolution he so feared. He couldn't get ahead of himself just yet, but just this once he allowed his heart to hope that all would be well in the end."

 griffons.95.d:0 "It was dark, windy, and cold enough for his feathers to start frosting at the tips. Still, Klaus felt a bead of sweat drip down his forehead. He lay on his belly, rifle in claw, and gave his companion a glance. Eckhart crouched low, binoculars glued to his face, and clicked his tongue. "Yup," he said, "Those are commies."\n\nThey looked down from a steep hill, covered by sheer rock and pines. It overlooked a rough, rarely used trail below. From this distance they could see a line of griffons and ponies trudging along it. They walked with no light. Some carried rifles, but most of them were hauling crates between them. This close to the southern border, it didn't take a genius to figure out what they were arms smugglers. Klaus cursed internally. He had one job! Pull the patrols away from the partisans, that was it! But Eckhart was too persistent. He liked him, even so far as to call him a friend. But he was no communist, not like Klaus.\n\n"Let's head back," the griff in question said. "No point in shooting these guys out, ey? Let's just write it down, they can't call us slackers then."\n\nKlaus looked on as the scout turned his back. What could he do? Let him talk and the whole operation would be compromised. Silence him, and he would remember it for the rest of his days. He didn't have the time to consider it any longer though. He stood up and raised his rifle..."

 griffons.96.d:0 "The governor's office was in chaos, more so than usual. Even through the thick, wooden doors, any griffon with half their hearing intact could tell that the situation inside was dire.\n\n"-and I do not appreciate being called an idiot for offering the sensible solution! Stalliongrad is hardly stable, if we just negotiate them then they will have no choice but to listen-" Triton's voice, already strained, was interrupted harshly.\n\n"Idiot!" Highhill barked, "I'll call you that again, because only an idiot would try bribing a communist! Those ponies hate money- they'll hang you for even trying!" Triton gasped, protesting to the marshal's vulgarity, but he was promptly talked over. "There's only one language these creatures understand, and that's the wrong side of an R1!"\n\nTeafeather massaged his temples. There had already been reports of rising hostilities, stolen equipment, and even missing soldiers, along the southern border. But now the situation had turned for the worse: it turned out there had been a massive arms smuggling campaign directed by Stalliongrad-affiliated ponies, right under the army's beak! Not only was this embarrassing, it meant that an uncountable number of guns were now in the claws of communist partisans. The governor took the time to mentally curse Redtail, and the justice system too for not imprisoning him any longer.\n\n"-call me a warhawk all you want," he heard Highhill say through the maelstrom of his thoughts, "but those mountains aren't a playground. If we don't strike now, they'll think they can do anything!"\n\nTeafeather was tired. More tired than he had ever been before. He was a fool to think the strikes would be the end of his troubles. He wondered, like he had done many times before, if he could call himself a good leader after the way he handled so many of those crises. All the same, moping about it wouldn't solve anything. Teafeather sighed and cleared his throat, "Alright, gentlegriffs, listen...""
 griffons.96.a:0 ""Stalliongrad will deny everything. We will only reinforce the border.""
 griffons.96.b:0 ""They might want to help their 'comrades', but we can still negotiate with them.""

 griffons.97.t:0 "Our Town Is Ours!"
 griffons.97.d:0 "The bartender fiddled with the radio, tuning it this way and that as he tried to find the colonial broadcast channel. "When's the last time we listened to that?: he asked himself. He was met with a battery of replies from the patrons huddled around him, mostly telling him to hurry up and pour them a drink. Finally, static sputtered from the speaker, and a warbled voice came into focus.\n\n"-And what's this 'Our Town' business anyway?!" The marshal's voice came out, clear as day. "We let Severyana have that land out of honour! We let Stalliongrad keep it because we're not a bunch of warmongers! But now they have the gall to- to use that little outpost to plot against us? Well, to that I say: TARTARUS NO!"\n\n"That's OUR territory! That's OUR land! That's OUR town!"\n\nThe bartender blinked in shock. In fact, the whole bar had gone silent from the brash declaration against that little pony commune in the south. Suddenly, a very drunk griffon from the back of the bar spoke- well, slurred. "He has a point, y'know!"
 griffons.97.a:0 "This town is our town~ This town is our town~"
 
 griffons.98.t:0 "Highhill Denounces Stalliongrad!"
 griffons.98.d:0 ""Nova Griffonians, let me ask you this: what has Stalliongrad done for us?" the question hung in the air, silent as everygriff in the barracks held on to the marshal's every word. Then, like thunder, he barked into the microphone. "Nothing good, that's what!"\n\n"I won't lie to you. I won't sugarcoat things for you. I won't look you in the eye and tell you that everything is fine, because it isn't." Every word seemed to be punctuated with the metaphorical talon slam on the table. "We're fighting- fighting for our very existence, and every step of that way we have been fighting because some other idiot mucked it up for us! And now- these freakin' extremists, down south, they come up here, they stir up trouble- been for years-" he caught his breath, "and we just let them?!"\n\n"No more!" he roared, "They're a threat, plain and simple, and we need to protect ourselves before it's too late. Watching the border isn't enough, no, we need to strike first- bloody the snouts of those starving commies and show them they can't mess with us anymore! How do we do that?" This time, there was an audible slam. "We take Sovyenok! We take Zvezdopadovo! We get ourselves a new frontier, and contain the red threat once and for all! If they think Nova Griffonia is theirs to take, they're dead wrong!"\n\nThough the speech continued, most of it was rendered to incomprehensible garble as the soldiers cheered wildly, chanting one name only."

Among many things, they cited growing tensions between them and Stalliongrad, as well to the widespread rumours of our territory serving as supply hubs for Soviet forces. While we have vehemently denied these claims, they have fallen on deaf ears, and now the future of [STL.GetName] is cast into shadow."

 griffons.100.t:0 "Aggression From The North"
 griffons.100.d:0 "Nova Griffonia has been in turmoil for the past few months. Unfortunately for us, power fell into the claws of Highhill – the leader of the reactionaries. In order to plunge workers into chauvinism and nationalist hysteria, his government started to spread outright false information that in ancient times the colonial territories included some of the current northern regions of our Republic.\n\nThe status of the border lands remained unclear for a long time, and the few historical sources provide controversial information.\n\nObviously, the Nova Griffonian military is preparing for war and wants to conquer our lands in the same way as the lands of the yaks and penguins were once conquered. Our agents claim that they can try to negotiate with the Equestrian aristocrats on the question of conquering Severyana. Nevertheless, we can use their actions to make counter demands and claim their own regions."
 griffons.100.a:0 "We don't need their land, but we won't give up an inch of our own."

 griffons.101.d:0 "Another meeting for the Central Committee of the Communist Party was in progress. Having finished discussing the agenda, the leaders began to collect their things, but they were interrupted by Wheatin's voice: "Don't disperse, comrades, we have one more very important issue left. A special commissioner from the Socialist Federation of Nova Griffonia has arrived with an appeal from his leadership. Comrade Miron, you can speak now."\n\nA dark green griffon, dressed in a coat and hat, came out. Placing his hat on the table, he pulled out from his inner pocket a yellowed note with traces of moisture on it. Unfolding it, the griffon cleared his throat and began to read. The letter was written in Severyanian, but the griffon read it with the characteristic burry accent of the inhabitants of Nova Griffonia. The essence of the letter was that a crisis has been brewing in his state for a long time. Now that the forces of reaction are poised to seize power, the progressive forces of his country need the support of their more capable comrades in the south more than ever.\n\n"...Everything suggests that a revolutionary situation is approaching. In this regard, we ask our Severyanian comrades to help the cause of the coming socialist revolution. We consider it imperative to ensure the supply of equipment necessary for our forces to successfully fight the reactionaries- for democracy, republic and independence. The most preferred route for such supplies would be a remote pass in the mountains to our border. The technical side of the operation would be entrusted to a special Military Revolutionary Committee, formed by a number of our leaders from the Federation and led by Comrade Redtail..." the griffon said. The griffon finished, and waited for the council's response as he creased the note he had read from in his claws."
 griffons.101.a:0 "We have to support our comrades!"
 griffons.101.b:0 "We can offer nothing above the current level of aid."
 
 griffons.102.t:0 "Hopes Are Crumbling"
 griffons.102.d:0 "The young griffon ran along the bank, stumbling over stones and barely holding onto the rifle attached to his worn-out belt. Bullets whistled around him, showering everything around with dirt and dust.\n\nWhat should have been an easy and quick push to capture the border outpost at the bridge turned into a long battle. Apparently, the communists were warned and prepared in a timely manner. When the soldiers in the cover of night approached the guardhouse of the Severyanian border guards, a machine-gun burst was heard out of nowhere. The riflegriffon chain scattered, leaving several of their comrades lying on the ground in front of the fence. The Severyanians did not spare any cartridges.\n\nSoon the roar of engines was heard, and a column of armoured cars appeared in front of the building. Behind them, trucks were turning around, unloading more and more detachments of Red Army soldiers, ready for a counterattack.\n\nAt some point, his company was cut off from the rest by strong rifle fire and driven along the river bank, driving into the lowlands across the river. He did not know how things were in other areas, and did not think about it, wanting only to save his life. Highhill's adventure has failed, and Severyanians will certainly not just let it go."
 griffons.102.a:0 ""What was the purpose? We could sit peacefully and drink Severyanian beer...""
 
 griffons.103.t:0 "Well Deserved Victory"
 griffons.103.d:0 "The Severyanians did not expect this attack. Having easily killed the few border guards, the soldiers of Nova Griffonia quickly settled into new positions, satisfied with the quick victory. Chaos reigned in the guardhouse abandoned by the Reds: scraps of documents and dirty, torn red cloths with which the griffins wiped their paws were scattered everywhere, and outside the window more and more wagons with goods looted from the surrounding villages could be seen.\n\n"Let's celebrate our victory!" one of the soldiers shouted, flying through the window, holding a crate with beer bottles in his bosom. He was met with a roar of approval. Soon the room was filled with the clinking of caps and bottles of foamy drink. It was a victory, and everyone there knew who they should drink to."

 griffons.104.t:0 "The Border Conflict Ends With Uncertainty"
 griffons.104.d:0 "Despite initial success, we were unable to gain a foothold in the occupied territories. However, Severyanians were not able to completely return the border under their control as well. The conflict escalated into a series of skirmishes along the entire border.\n\nWe may not have achieved all of our goals, but nevertheless we showed our strength. Our southern neighbours will have to reckon with Nova Griffonia and its army."
 griffons.104.a:0 "Remind me why we started all this?"
 
 griffons.105.t:0 "The Red Army Was Defeated On the Border"
 griffons.105.d:0  "The attack of the griffons came as a surprise to the Severyanian troops. Local units of the Red Army were unable to cope with the raid. The Nova Griffonian forces managed to take control of many sections of the border and began to carry out raids deep into their territory, killing local government employees, communists, and plundering local settlements.\n\n"How did it even happen that these bastards attacked us unexpectedly?!" Norushkina asked angrily, looking from one commander to another. "Where were our recons looking? And what about the border guards?" the thestral jumped up to one earth pony commander, who lowered his eyes guiltily.  "Look at me, you fool! You must have been drinking beer while these bastards were setting up machine guns! Aren't you ashamed at all? Our illustrious army was defeated by some ragamuffins! Comrade Stallion would spit in your muzzles if he were alive!"\n\nHaving spoken, she sighed heavily and turned to the map, on which the griffon troops and the territories they had captured were marked. "Soon a train with artillery will approach, and we will be able to knock them out of there. But I cannot roll out our heavy guns to every border incident. If this goes on, they will not keep dumping these gangs on us, but their regular army.""
 griffons.105.a:0 "This conflict will be a bloody lesson for all of us."
 
 griffons.106.t:0 "Masha Strikes!"
 griffons.106.d:0 "Commander Masha Norushkina sat in one of the rooms of the local Soviet building temporarily used as the headquarters of the Northern Operational Group. She was reading the latest report from the front. The Nova Griffonian reactionaries claimed the southern villages under Severyana's control, yet they couldn't even make it past the mountains! The Stalliongradians predicted their every move and destroyed the invaders at every turn.\n\nHer smile grew more ominous as she looked over the numbers of equipment and prisoners captured. "You were naive to think you would win, Highhill," she whispered.\n\nShe heard hoofsteps approaching the room. The door opened and a middle-aged pegasus in a Red Army uniform entered the room, pulling a packet of papers from his pocket.\n\n"New reports from the river up north, Comrade Commander. Another wave of invaders has been eliminated by the local garrison," he said.\n\n"Even better!" The thestral beamed with satisfaction as she scanned the report, letting out an uncharacteristic foalish giggle as she did. Her wings fluttered with excitement, "We've kicked those insolent bastards right in the teeth!" Norushkina kept speaking as she glanced up from the reports scattering her desk. The sight that greeted her was a strange one: a blushing soldier. "I don't mean to be impertinent, but," the courier's eyes met hers with a little smile, "happiness suits you very well."\n\n"-which should have been delivered to the militia units on the northern border last Friday..." The commander's mouth kept moving, but her words slowed to a halt as she fully digested the courier's words. Her face flushed deep red as a stunned silence followed.\n\nThe pegasus coughed, still smiling. "I await your further orders". Norushkina's face twisted into a scowl, and she barked at him to get out. It was only after the door hurriedly slammed shut that she let herself sink into her seat. "Fool!" she scolded herself, "You are tarnishing the image of the Red Commander in the eyes of ordinary workers like that pegasus. Unacceptable!" She buried her head in her hooves, only feeling better when she remembered their victory against Nova Griffonia."

 griffons.107.t:0 "New Reality"
 griffons.107.d:0 "The attack of the reactionaries from Nova Griffonia was met as all invaders should be met: with lead and steel. In general, we have regained control over the border, but these events force us to draw a not so pleasant conclusion: our neighbours are becoming stronger and more insolent. The griffon troops pose a serious threat.\n\nThis brutal battle fought on the northern border of our Republic showed that we must make the security of our country a top priority and focus all our efforts on developing our military."

They also claim Severyanians support them with money and arms, and demand that we stop supporting these, as they write, "bandits and disruptors of public order".\n\nIt is curious that at the same time they are offering us to make a small trade agreement. Obviously this is an attempt to buy our neutrality, but perhaps there is a point in it."

 griffons.109.t:0 "A Deal To Celebrate"
 griffons.109.d:0 "There was a pop, and white foam sprayed out wildly from the bottle of champagne. The governor's ballroom was packed with what seemed to be the entire Harmonic coalition. Triton, standing in the center of it all, raised the bottle high with a grin on his face. "Let us rejoice now, friends, for we have just bought our peace with the Stalliongradians! Let us drink for our bright future!" Cheers rippled through the crowd, and the party kicked into full swing. The atmosphere was alive with music and dance. After all, not only had they avoided war, but had also cut off the radicals from their very source.\n\nNot everygriff was happy. Marshal Highhill stood off in his own dark corner, glowering, nursing a shot of whiskey. Finally, Triton made his way to the old Marshal. "What's the matter now, Erwin?"" he asked, no brightness left in his voice. "I invited you as a point of courtesy. Why do you look as if you'll bite somegriff's head off?"\n\n"Do you really believe all that peace nonsense?" Highhill asked bluntly. "It's all clearly a charade, and we should be preparing to protect ourselves, instead of drinking ourselves stupid!"\n\nTriton was taken aback by the suddenness of his outburst, but he recovered. "I wouldn't have said it if I didn't believe it, and I don't appreciate you insinuating otherwise. But to your point, I think you're far too cynical, marshal! You see, it doesn't matter what the ponies say they believe, they still bent to our bits, didn't they? And they will keep bending, so long as we don't blink. I thought you of all griffons would understand this."\n\nHighhill gave him a level glare, and the two stood in a tense standoff. It was Triton that turned away first, and as he walked away he said, "I do hope you enjoy the rest of the party, Marshal. Good day.""

They also vehemently rejected our trade deal, Governor." He watched Teafeather let out a long, suffering sigh as he massaged his temples. Highhill, meanwhile, burst out in laughter.\n\n"And what did I tell you, featherbrain? They were never going to agree, but you didn't listen, and now look at us: we're a laughingstock!" He snapped his head to the Governor, "-and you! You agreed to this! You've let these commies make a mockery out of us!"\n\n"Watch your tone, Erwin," Teafeather snapped, "I'm no idiot for not wanting to spill blood."\n\n"Ah, but now we'll have to! I'm your friend, so I forgive you anyhow. Now though, now you listen to me. We need to strike hard, and strike now! Only battle will wash this humiliation from us!"\n\n"No," Triton spoke up, having snapped himself out of his shock. "We absolutely cannot afford any kind of conflict. Even pressuring them will be disastrous for us! Governor, please, see reason! For the sake of the colony, retreat."\n\nGovernor Teafeather clasped his talons together and thought hard as the other two griffons got into another shouting match. War, or humiliation? How far was he willing to push Nova Griffonia? He sighed again, and a determined expression spread across his face. "Enough!" he shouted, loud enough to silence the two, "No more squabbling.

It didn't seem to affect the Governor at all.\n\n"I would not call this a discussion," Teafeather said, not looking up from the stack of reports he was paging through. Highhill snapped. He surged forward to slam his talon on top of the reports. Teafeather paused. Slowly, his gaze turned upwards to meet Highhill's.\n\n"Because there doesn't need to be one," Highhill answered Teafeather's unspoken question. "We need it, and I can't see a single reason why you should refuse me!"\n\nThe two griffons were beak-to-beak now. They held each other's gaze. Teafeather smirked, "I can think of at least one." He broke away from Highhill and moved to the large window behind him. He swept the curtains open to reveal the large gathering below. Griffons marched in circles. They chanted inaudibly through the thick glass, but many held up signs. One said "BREAD, NOT BULLETS!" Another showed a talondrawn caricature of the Marshal, with the words "WARMONGER" painted in red. "I had an interesting conversation with the griffons down there," Teafeather said, "About army funding, and how depreciated our social security service is in comparison. That is reason enough to deny you."\n\nHighhill stood silent. When he spoke, his voice was clear. "You aren't thinking about the future, Teafeather. What use is giving a griff bread when communists and revolutionaries are at our doorstep trying to rip it away from him? When all these troubles are over, I won't bother you again.  I wouldn't demand for it if it wasn't necessary.""

The council chambers were silent as the old soldier began to speak, calmly but with force.\n\n"There is trouble brewing in our countryside, Governor. In every corner of our colony, thugs calling themselves Falcons commit crimes in broad daylight, with impunity! There is nowhere our non-griffons are safe with these criminals about. Bigotry is just the start of it." He revealed a slim manila folder, and held it up in his claw, "I've seen what these griffons preach, and it is nothing short of revolutionary sentiment! If we don't curve their outrageous behaviour now, then I fear that Nova Griffonia is at risk of a crisis it will not be able to bear." There was grumbling now, rising from across the room where his more conservative councilgriffs sat. Silverwing continued, "To this end, I propose that we recognize these so-called 'Falcons' as what they are: terrorists, and deal with them accordingly. Anything less is a threat to state security."\n\nIt wasn't a second after he had finished speaking when rebuttals flew across the room. Voices slammed into one another, clawing for dominance as each side lobbed insults and insinuations ran free. In the chaos, Teafeather deliberated. He knew the Falcons. They were a useful cudgel against communism, and their leader was all but officially endorsed by Highhill himself. Still, he could not deny that their recent behavior was abhorrent. How much could he excuse, he wondered, before it all backfired?\n\nThrough the cacophony, Governor Teafeather raised his claw. In an instant the council went quiet. He spoke."

Besides, he thought, those puppet harmonites wouldn't know what hit them. He smirked at the thought as he cocked his rifle. "Now," he said, signaling two of his griffs forward, "let's get ourselves a country."\n\nThe doors slammed open. Highhill stormed into the council chamber, his soldiers following after, rifles flared. "Freeze, you chicklets, and..." his words stopped short as he took full stock of the room. The provisional government was in session, alright, but there only seemed to be soldiers - his soldiers - present. And they were all pointing their rifles straight at him. "What's the meaning of this?!" he yelled, whirling as his aim landed on troop after troop.\n\n"Is it not obvious? They're here to stop a coup." Wilhelm Silverwing seemed to appear out of nowhere. Soldiers parted as he made his way to the Marshal. Highhill began to sweat. Still, he did not drop his rifle. "Now, you listen to me. I'm in the only griff on this whole continent strong to save Nova Griffonia! Teafeather chose me! I-"\n\nSilverwing gave him a hard look. Without a word, he slid a pistol out of his coat and placed the barrel right against his forehead. "You are under arrest for seditious conspiracy and treason. You will be given a fair trial, afterwards of which you will be found guilty on all charges and hanged. Now," a distinctive click rang out across the room from his pistol, "drop your weapon before this becomes a firing squad."\n\nFor once, Highhill did as he was told. His griffs followed after.

Still, he held on to his rifle with an iron grip. His squad was routed by the fascists- he could hear the pops of gunfire storming outside- and he had taken refuge in a dilapidated cabin. But it was no fort. Sooner or later Highhill's thugs would rush in, and...\n\nHe let out a shaky breath. The soldier couldn't know why it had all gone wrong. He only knew that somewhere along the way, they had started to run out of everything. More of his comrades came back dead or hurt badly enough that they wished they were. The glory of battle had run dry. No longer did he feel like he was a part of something larger than himself, righteous and just in every way. Now, he just wanted to go home. The sounds of battle grew closer. He had lost too much blood. He slumped, and waited for the inevitable.\n\nSuddenly, he heard a rumble in the distance. It grew closer, and closer, and the shouts of battle changed. With all his strength, he pulled himself up to the window. He couldn't believe his eyes. Rushing forwards were tanks, with red stars proudly shining on them! The fascists broke, turning tail and flying. Ponies, galloping behind the tanks, shot them down. The soldier collapsed, and though he felt cold and his vision blurred, his heart beat with elation. He heard hoofsteps, he felt himself being pulled away. But all he could think was that if the Severyanans were here, there was still a chance for a bright future. After so much bloodshed, they would finally win the war.\n\nThe soldier couldn't know the game of politics that had been played. If he lived, he wouldn't understand until years afterwards. Nova Griffonia lived-"
 griffons.121.a:0 "But it lived at the cost of true freedom."
 
 griffons.122.t:0 "Beginning Of The End"
 griffons.122.d:0 "Heinrich Redtail sat alone. His makeshift war room, a repurposed storage closet, was empty. His map table was scattered with papers. He remembered the early days of the war, so full of enthusiasm. Now, the fire that had led him here was flickering. He felt cold as he looked at report after report of the front, all grim. But what his heart truly freeze was a nearly opened envelope, with the Soviet seal broken. Redtail took a drink of some hard liquor he had been able to scrounge up. It tasted like engine fuel.\n\nUnexpectedly, there was a knock at the door. He didn't say anything as Silverwing entered and saluted him. He nodded. "Wilhelm," he started, his voice more tired than he'd meant to show, "I didn't expect to see you here."\n\n"Truthfully, I am needed elsewhere. But I heard that we received a response from Stalliongrad. Communications are breaking down. If we want to coordinate anything with our allies then-" but the sickly griffon raised his talon to silence Silverwing. With another shuddering sigh, Redtail shook his head. "It's fine, forget about all that," he said, pointing his head towards the envelope, "It'll all be the same as before."\n\nSilverwing's expression twitched. He quickly strode to his desk and swept up the letter. His eyes flit down the page in with wide eyes. It took him many false starts before he could speak properly again. "This- This can't be. We have no proper alternatives if Stalliongrad will not support us. Griffs are losing spirit, platitudes are not going to get us out of this mess we have made!"\n\n"Nothing will," Redtail said with a strange emptiness in his voice. Silverwing stared in astonishment at him, but he continued. "The only thing we can do is keep fighting, and hope that we will beat Highhill back. To be honest, though-" he took another swig."
 griffons.122.a:0 ""I doubt that will happen.""
 
 griffons.123.t:0 "An Unwelcome Guest"
 griffons.123.d:0 "Between the traitorous Jaki, the communist Ghenikhan and his hesitant Equestrian allies, Prince Rutherford had enough to worry about. He was already in a bad mood when he was told a griffon had arrived in Yakistown.\n\n"Catbirds not welcome in Yakyakistan!" Rutherford yelled at the intruder, "Leave now or else!"\n\n"Come now, Your Majesty," the griffon replied with a smirk, "Is that any way to treat a foreign dignitary? Especially when I have something to offer."\n\nRutherford's expression softened. "What catbird want?"\n\n"We've heard about your little civil war, and we'd like to help. I'm prepared to offer weapons, but in addition to payment I'll need a promise from you. The land in Nova Griffonia inhabited by yaks-"\n\n"The land catbirds stole from yaks!"\n\n"Yes, well, be that as it may, it's our land now. We'd like a promise that you won't make any trouble for us there in the near future."\n\nRutherford considered the deal. Griffons had been the enemies of yaks for generations, and accepting the current border with Nova Griffonia would be very unpopular. Yet in the here and now he needed guns. Equestria only offered a pittance, and Stalliongrad's help came with strings attached. Maybe this trade was worth the cost?"
 griffons.123.a:0 ""Yaks accept. Catbirds bring guns now!""
 griffons.123.b:0 ""No deal! Leave before yak SMASH catbird!""
 
 griffons.124.t:0 "An Offer From An Old Enemy"
 griffons.124.d:0 "Prince Bradford knelt in front of the shrine, his eyes closed. He prayed for accord amongst his allies, and discord amongst his enemies. He prayed that his ancestors would see the justice of his cause and guide him. He prayed-\n\n"Prince Bradford, big news!" said an approaching messenger.\n\n"What yak want?" the Prince asked, annoyed.\n"Strange catbird arrive in Saihan Tolgod, wants to speak with Prince yak."\n\nBradford choked on his words, too furious to speak. The griffons were the yaks' ancient enemies; butchers who had driven the eastern clans from their ancestral lands. How dare a member of that accursed species make an appearance in his capital!\n\n"Prince Bradford will not meet with catbird! Ask what catbird wants and report back!"\n\nThe messenger departed, then returned a few moments later. "Catbird says wants to trade guns. Will give yaks guns in return for payment and promise not to attack catbird lands."\n\nBradford struggled to formulate a response. Making a deal with the griffons, especially an agreement to respect the current border, went against everything he stood for. But he couldn't afford to dismiss this out of hoof. His brother was already scheming with the ponies of Equestria and Stalliongrad, selling out the nation in exchange for their support. If the Jaki hoped to win the coming war they would need all the help they could get."

 griffons.132.d:0 "Overthrowing the reactionary forces that plagued Nova Griffonia would not be easy. Redtail did not expect miracles, the fact that they had gathered so much support and claws on the ground already was miracle enough. Yet, what else could he call the report?\n\nWaves of volunteers from Stalliongrad had flooded past the southern border. Near universally they cited their desire to help Nova Griffonia fight for a better future- or at least one in line with the vision of his old friend. Even now their comrades from abroad were being prepared for the fight to come. Not just them, but other Nova Griffonians that were spurred on too. Ponies, yaks, penguins, even their long estranged frontier brethren, all now fought for their cause. It was enough to make a griff cry.\n\nInstead, Redtail steadied himself. He couldn't get ahead of himself, not when he was closer than ever to achieving his dream. He would help guide Nova Griffonia into a new age, however that looked like. And with the hopes of so many resting on this new revolution..."
 griffons.132.a:0 "Victory was all but assured."
 
 griffons.133.t:0 "From Weter, With Hope"
 griffons.133.d:0 ""In short," said Hivesmarschall Trimmel, "Marshal Highhill would like our military aid in crushing the communist revolt in Nova Griffonia. He says it is strategically imperative that the strong nations of Equus band together against communism." He paused, and then added, "He also says some tanks would not be unappreciated."\n\nChrysalis didn't attempt to hide her contempt. She burst out in mocking laughter, "He dares compare his nation to ours, in the same breath that he begs for our panzers to fight in his war!" She let out one last cackle before sighing, wiping a tear from her eye. "I would consider this offer a grievous insult if it wasn't so completely pathetic."\n\n"However true that may be, my Queen, this does present us with a unique opportunity." Trimmel added, "If we offer our support now, we could leverage it later and force the griffons to open a second front in Equestria. Or at the very least, to distract Stalliongrad. Of course, there is always the risk they will refuse, or accept and still fail to regain control of Nova Griffonia. Whatever the case will be, the choice is yours to make."\n\nThe queen tapped her hoof in thought. She had always considered the griffon colony a target, and with all the preparations being made to beat Equestria to the ground, even she was hesitant to muddy the waters further with a scheme that might not even turn out well. Still, if she sent in just a few outdated panzers, she could win herself a great boon. After thinking it over, she made her decision."
 griffons.133.a:0 ""Tell them we accept, with our little condition. Let's see how far the old marshal will go.""
 griffons.133.b:0 ""Tell that old bird he's lucky my Heer is far too busy to crush his insipid colony.""
 
 griffons.134.t:0 "The Price Of Victory"
 griffons.134.d:0 "A response from the Changelings had come, and Highhill wasn't happy. His voice, full of rage and indignation, roared through the halls of the governor's mansion. "Are you out of your mind?!"" he yelled, "I only signed on that 'request' to get you from riding my tail! If I wasn't going to accept before, why in Tartarus would I accept now? They'll drag us into some war we have nothing to do with!"\n\nIronclaw remained steadfast, even with the marshal getting spittle all over him. He took out a handkerchief and wiped his beak clean, speaking calmly. ""They're simply asking for military support..." Highhill scoffed at that, turning away as if he couldn't bear to look at his top general any longer. Ironclaw continued, "whatever you believe will happen in the future, the facts of the present are clear: Either we accept their aid and have a chance of finally ending this insurrection once and for all, or we doom ourselves to die a slow death. I am no fan of these... international parasites, but like it or not we need their aid."\n\nThe marshal took in a deep breath. He felt deep shame that he was even considering Ironclaw's words. But whether he liked it or not, his army was in dire straits. He felt the urgency build within him, battling with his pride and sense of duty. Finally, he turned back to Ironclaw."
 griffons.134.a:0 "Curse it all, you're right. Tell that messenger that... we accept their conditions."
 griffons.134.b:0 "...I would rather die and see this colony fall than become an insect's weapon."
 
 griffons.135.t:0 "Nova Griffonia Under Our Hoof"
 griffons.135.d:0 "Chrysalis cackled as she read the response from the Nova Griffonian emissary. "Those idiots actually said yes!" She grinned manically, turning to her Hivesmarschall as she pushed the response aside. "Now all we need to do is make sure those fools stay alive long enough to reap the rewards."\n\n"I have already sent for the needed panzers," Trimmel replied, his face betraying no emotion other than cold satisfaction. "They may be outdated, but perhaps with a little instruction from our military aides, the griffons will be able to turn the tide of their war."\n\n"They better," snapped the Queen, "even they can't be incompetent enough to waste our 'help'." But her mood quickly turned, and she smiled once more. "If only I could be there to feel the fear of those little ponies once they realize they're surrounded on all sides." She laughed darkly, "I can hardly wait.""
 griffons.135.a:0 "It is obvious that the powers that be stand with us."
 
 griffons.136.t:0 "Nova Griffonia Insults Us!"
 griffons.136.d:0 "Queen Chrysalis's face twitched as she read the response from the Nova Griffonian emissary. Insect. That had been what that detestable Highhill had called her. After he had been the one to come crawling to her. The air in her office seemed to boil.\n\nPerhaps unwisely, Hivesmarschall Trimmel cleared his throat and spoke. "I can assure you, my Queen, their rejection is of no loss to us. Our Heer is-" he was interrupted by his Queen slamming her hoof down, hard enough that he heard the distinct crack of wood denting. The response had been crumpled badly at the point of impact. Trimmel shut his mouth.\n\n"There's no need for consolation," she said in a strangely calm voice. "If the marshal wants to be ungrateful, fine. I was always going to crush Equestria on my own. But when the time comes, and that weakling is somehow still alive..." In a flash, the room was engulfed in a sickly green light as the response burst into flames that licked the ceiling. She broke into a manic grin, watching as the paper curled and burnt to nothing. "He will wish he never came begging to me at all!""
 griffons.136.a:0 "We're going to need an extinguisher in here."
 
 griffons.137.t:0 "Well, We Tried"
 griffons.137.d:0 "Ironclaw's beak gaped as he read the Changeling missive over and over again. No matter how many times he re-read, the answer was the same."B-But..." he sputtered, "How could they reject us, and so cruelly? We..."\n\nHighhill, on the other claw, was much less broken up about it. In fact, he actually seemed glad they had been rejected so thoroughly. He snatched the paper from Ironclaw. "Oh, get over it already! You see those words here?" he pointed and read out loud, "'I would crush your insipid colony right now if my Heer wasn't busy?' That's not going to change! So get back to work. The more time you spend crying, the more time those commies have to slash at our ankles!"\n\nHe brusquely walked away, but not before crumpling up the missive and throwing it to the trash. Ironclaw watched after him before taking a deep breath. Right. Back to work."
 griffons.137.a:0 "But he still couldn't understand."
 
 griffons.138.t:0 "Our Unfortunate Promise"
 griffons.138.d:0 "In our hour of greatest need, when we were surrounded by traitors and communists, the Changelings extended their hoof to us. While some may scoff at the extent of their involvement in the face of the blood we spilled, we must remember that it was no small kindness. They could have rejected us, and then where would we be?\n\nWe must also remember that they are a powerhouse unlike anything this continent has ever seen. Once they are finished with Equestria, they will be at our doorstep. So now that their Queen calls us to arms, we will answer. Not out of self-preservation, or petty selfishness, but for honour and glory!"
 griffons.138.a:0 "Besides, it's not like we can refuse."
 
 griffons.139.t:0 "The Vultures From Weter"
 griffons.139.d:0 "It seems vultures are circling above Equestria as envoys from Weter land in Vesalipolis. The griffons of Nova Griffonia have smelled blood in the water, and are now offering to fight alongside us against the ponies. Of course, this comes with a condition: we must guarantee them portions of Stalliongradian territory when all is said and done. While this would very much be an alliance of opportunity and convenience, the chance to see Equestria surrounded at all sides is certainly a tempting one."
 griffons.139.a:0 "They will make a nice ally. For now."
 griffons.139.b:0 "As if the Hegemony needs the help of these backwater chickens!"
 
 griffons.140.t:0 "What We've Always Deserved"
 griffons.140.d:0 "Soldiers are beginning to mass at the southern border as confirmation of a successful Changeling alliance comes to light. While it is true we had little reason to care about the so-called "Great War" before, Stalliongrad's own mobilization against the Queen presented us with the opportunity of a lifetime. It would be foolish to not strike them when their back is turned! Soon we will crush the communists once and for all, and when all is done, we will take the land that is rightfully ours. That is, if the Changelings win. But with us at their side, how could they lose?"
 griffons.140.a:0 "In for a penny, in for a pound."
 
 griffons.141.t:0 "A Missed Chance"
 griffons.141.d:0 "The despicable, treacherous, conniving Queen Chrysalis has rudely rejected our offer to join her fight against Equestria and Stalliongrad! While it is true that we had little real reason to join the fight, the chance to strike at our communists neighbours while their backs were turned was too tempting to ignore. Not that it matters now. Without an alliance secured with the Changelings, any gains we make on Stalliongrad will be for nothing. Humiliating as it is, it is hard to say that we alone could stand against the might of the Hegemony in the event of a future conflict. It seems we will have to move our dreams of conquest to a later date..."
 griffons.141.a:0 "Those insects don't know what they're missing."
 
 griffons.142.t:0 "The End Of Duty"
 griffons.142.d:0 "Tired soldiers stood in haphazard rows at attention as an officer paced in front of them. He spoke of bravery, courage, and tenacity in the face of battle. They had all forged a bond unlike any other. They had lost, and been broken, but their spirits were still burning, he said. The soldiers looked on ahead with steely gazes at his words. Except for the old, middle-aged griff who scoffed and began to smoke. And the hen who collapsed onto the ground and began to sob. A few feet next to her, a line was processing forward as the losers were stripped of their equipment.\n\nNova Griffonia was shifting. As camps were dismantled, as battlefields were swept away, creatures began to teem throughout the former colony. The victors and the defeated both, they all desired but one thing, and they would go to any length to get there. Trains were overcrowded, and griffons roosted on top the rail-cars. Those that didn't know the way back home flew after them. Roads were congested and clogged with a similar mass procession. On paw, many returned to their farms. Some were just like they left it. Others were just gone. Back to march they went.\n\nThe mass always lead back to the cities. A father returned to his wife and children, battered but alive. A sister marched in step on a victory parade, her family cheering loudly for her on the sidelines. A son stood in front of a house that had been destroyed by artillery fire. However they fought, however it went, they had come through the light at the end of the tunnel. The civil war was finally over. Duty was put to rest."
 griffons.142.a:0 "We have returned to our nests."
 griffons.142.b:0 "We can't be complacent now."

 griffons.143.t:0 "On the Matter Of Severyana"
 griffons.143.d:0 "Following our victory against Stalliongrad, the question now arises on what to do with their former lands. Occupation is proving difficult as communist elements have firmly embedded themselves within the territory. So while we could continue as is, we must consider the option of leaving the administration to a puppet government as to not waste our own resources. Still, perhaps we can still make something of the situation."
 griffons.143.a:0 "No changes are necessary, we will figure something out."
 griffons.143.b:0 "A Republican government will do the region good."

 griffons.144.d:0 "After their victory in the civil war, in which our support played an important role, Nova Griffonia was in a state of transition.\n\nDuring the transition period, our advisers helped the people's government restore order in the country and lay the foundations for socialist construction. However, we now have serious problems concerning the question of independence, considering our own history. The representatives of the Socialist Federation of Nova Griffonia ask us to give them more independence in making decisions regarding the internal policies of their country.\n\nWe must be sure that they will not allow any opportunist or revisionist distortion to their government, and will carry out the ideals of socialism in Nova Griffonia to the end at all costs."
 griffons.144.a:0 "They showed themselves capable of governing the country on their own."
 griffons.144.b:0 "The transition period has not yet ended."
 
 griffons.145.t:0 "A Dream Rekindled"
 griffons.145.d:0 "Redtail wasn't entirely satisfied, and a part of his pride still stung. It hurt to know that Nova Griffonia had to rely on Stalliongrad so heavily to be able to stand on their own again. But as he looked over Weter, and the creatures bustling in the streets below, he felt nothing but pride at what he had accomplished. The hardships of the civil war were all worth it now, and the humiliation he felt when Stalliongrad first occupied the colony were washed away. That which he had dreamed of ever since he met Steel Stallion had finally come true: a socialist Nova Griffonia, soon to bloom in full.\n\nHe understood then that it had been necessary. Counter-revolutionary thought had been strong, and the nation needed stability more than anything. Still, he embittered himself, and worked hard to make sure Stalliongrad could see Nova Griffonia has a nation they could rely on, instead of a simple puppet. Now it had all paid off. After a formal request for more political independence, Stalliongrad had accepted. Even now he watched as Stalliongradian troops made their way out of the city and back to their home. He wouldn't miss them at all.\n\nYes, it was true that Nova Griffonia was still under its neighbours influence, but the fact that they agreed at all confirmed that it would not always be so. Perhaps it wouldn't be in his lifetime, and perhaps it would take years more, but in time Nova Griffonia would break free. True independence was possible, and he would make sure to lay the foundation for it."
 griffons.145.a:0 "Despite the circumstances, the future looked bright."
 
 griffons.146.t:0 "A Frayed Dream"
 griffons.146.d:0 "Redtail stood on the balcony of the People's mansion and looked over the glowing city of Weter. That which he had dreamed of ever since he met Steel Stallion had finally come true: a socialist Nova Griffonia. One that could stand beside Stalliongrad as a bastion of progress for all the world to see. Yet, the reality wasn't the dream he had envisioned. He never expected to become a vassal for the Severyanans, for one.\n\nAfter the devastation of the civil war, he had welcomed Stalliongrad's help. Everything needed to be rebuilt: from the structure of the new socialist government to the cities decimated by war. But Stalliongrad never left. Its influence festered in every aspect of Nova Griffonia, and before he knew it they had become a permanent presence. He saw what was happening and still he blinded himself to the truth. He told himself that as soon as he demonstrated that his nation could thrive on his own, Stalliongrad would be bound to leave them be.\n\nWhat a fool he was.\n\nHe still remembered pleading with them one last time. How he had assured them that they could be equals, that they were ready to stand on their own paws and claws now. But it had all come crashing down. None of it mattered in the end. The 'transition period', has they had called it, would continue. He knew what it really meant. Nova Griffonia would never achieve true independence. It would always be another nation's colony."
 griffons.146.a:0 "Where did he go wrong?"
 
 griffons.147.t:0 "I"
 griffons.147.d:0 ""What will you fight for?"\n\nThe question caught Frederick off-guard. He expected the old sergeant to throw him a rifle the second he asked to sign-up. Instead, the griffon across from him only crossed his forelegs and looked at him expectantly. Frederick gulped, and he forced out an answer. "F-Freedom, sir!"\n\nHe was met with a silent, withering stare.\n\nFrederick felt his face burn. He was in the middle of a military camp, and he was being needled for why he wanted to fight. Didn't these creatures need all the bodies they could get? Why was he suddenly being put on the spot like this? Still, he calmed himself. "Freedom's the most noble thing anyone could fight for, or anyone with sense..." But the sergeant's stare did not let up. He pressed on, "Freedom from- from tyranny, from insane old griffs ruling behind the barrel of a gun. From him ruining what the unions have done for this colony, or from my family being crushed under his claw!"\n\nThe old griffon looked at him for a long time. Enough that Frederick began to think he had blown his chance to join the army. His rising panic must have been obvious, because suddenly the sergeant burst out in peals of laughter. "You should've seen the look on your face!" he said, giving his shoulder a hearty slap. "I was just yankin' your chain. You youngins' are always so serious."\n\nHe sighed, "But that's what we like to hear! Come with me- you'll be shooting fascists soon enough.""
 griffons.147.a:0 "Frederick smiled and followed after, thinking about what he would tell his sister."
 
 griffons.148.t:0 "II"
 griffons.148.d:0 "Frederick's rifle rested on the sill, pointing out on to the forest. The fort was old, on the rear, and unlikely to be attacked. Still, he knew better than to trust the calm. The last time he got careless like that, he was awoken in the middle of the night by a fascist commando trying to stab him through the eye. So, he kept watch, and neither gaze nor aim ever left those trees.\n\nHe heard shuffling behind him, the slight clatter of wood and the rustling of paper. He did not turn back, but he knew his sergeant had sat down on the rickety old table behind him with a newspaper in his claws. "Listen to this," he said, crinkling the paper, "'Talon Industries to open more armouries- profits higher than ever', can you believe this? Little Skeiron is making a killing, killing us! He's the only one too, see here?" The sergeant scoffed, "Now we know who to thank when we're getting shot at. Greedy prick."\n\n"He wasn't the nicest griff before," Frederick said, not looking back. "It's not a surprise he is showing his true colours now. Better for it, or else we would have to deal with him once we get all this over with." The older griff said something in agreement, but Frederick wasn't listening anymore. His grip on his weapon tightened as he remembered every single comrade of his that was shot down by a Talon bullet.\n\nWhat fools, he thought, those so-called 'nationalists' must be to throw their lives away to line the coffers of leeches like Goldfeather. Everyone, not just the soldiers. Bigoted, ignorant griffons, unaware of their own lot in life, blindly following fascists and capitalists off a cliff. Every time he thought of it, his heart ached. His sister was one of those fools. Frederick blinked. He couldn't worry about that now. Tomorrow he would be out on the front again. It just wasn't the time."

 griffons.149.d:0 "Frederick struck the shopkeeper with the butt of his rifle. The other griffon staggered to the ground, and he struck him again. "That's what you get," Frederick spat, "Soldiers are bleeding and dying for you as we speak, and here you are- complaining!"\n\n"It's my life!" the shopkeeper warbled out, covering his head with his claws, "And it's all gone, thanks to you! No one asked for this war, except you commies. None of this would be happening if the governor was still alive!" For that, he was struck again, hard enough that Frederick heard a crack as he swung his rifle again.\n\nFrederick's stomach ached with hunger. He was just about to finish his rounds on the town and receive his meagre rations when he overheard the shopkeeper insulting the republic. For months he had been in constant combat, without rest or time to think but the endless gauntlet of death. He would not be insulted by a civvie that only knew how to run away. If he and his ilk took that same energy to march towards the enemy, they would have won the war by now.\n\n"You think you have it hard, don't you?"" The shopkeeper held his beak, blood slipping through his claws as he looked up at the Frederick in terror. "You don't know a thing about hardship- not until you're well and truly alone." He slipped his sidearm out and held it to the griffon's head. It clicked. Maybe it was the hunger, making him act unwell, he thought. "I'll give you something to cry about," he said coldly.\n\n"Please," the griffon cried through tears, "I have a family."\n\nFrederick did not react. To him, family was happenstance, spoiled blood. If Helga had followed him, they could had taken this war on together. Instead, he was on his own, and he had long stop bothering to remember the names of his comrades. He had no more pity to spare, and no more sorrow to feel. There was nothing left inside him.\n\nHe pulled the trigger. There was a thud."

 griffons.150.d:0 ""What are we fighting for?"\n\nHelga only vaguely recognized Reyhard Ironclaw at the podium, though she only knew he was one of the new generals in the marshal's army. A small crowd gathered around him, but he spoke as if he was leading a packed temple. "The communists fight to rend our nation- yes, nation- from the inside out. Their weak-willed harmonic 'comrades' fight for a red republic, one that only appeals to foreign interests." He spoke calmly, but she could see a fire burning behind his eyes. "We fight for Nova Griffonia. We fight for its glory, for its health, for its prosperity." More griffons had joined the crowd, and she felt herself rub shoulders with her fellow urbanites.\n\n"Wolves are snarling at our doorsteps, griffons, so I ask you now: who among you will stand and beat these mutts back?"\n\nThere was a murmur among the crowd, and Helga found herself stepping forward. "I will." she said, "I never liked those troublemakers in the first place." Just remembering those strikes made her blood boil, how they almost sent the colony down the drain just because they wanted some more bits! "I won't sit still while they kill us!"\n\nShe saw Ironclaw smile, and he motioned her to the stage. "Won't anygriff else join this brave hen in battle?""
 griffons.150.a:0 "Helga went to stand besides the general. She couldn't help but think of her idiot runaway brother."

 griffons.151.d:0 "Helga adjusted the scope of her rifle before resting it on the sill, pointing it out towards the forest beyond. Up from the temple tower, she could see leagues and leagues of trees stretching out into the horizon. Beautiful as it was, she knew what lay beyond. Scum. Infesting her beautiful Nova Griffonia, swarming to invade and infect.\n\n"It was the Stallionites that laid the seed,"" she remembered General Ironclaw say. She had just finished basic training then, and she had been so proud to finally be part of the Falcons divisions. "They are foreign parasites- creatures that loathe to see the common clay of our nation thrive. It was the grifftraitors that saw their malevolent vine grow and constrict our people, and in their greed they turned their backs on us." The general's voice never raised, never hitched. Everything he said, it was calculated, and she never doubted for a second that it was true.\n\n"Now, it is up to you brave griffons to take back what is ours,"" she mouthed the last string of the speech he had given that day, "and run this red disease back before it destroys us all." This was a mantra she repeated to herself every day so that she would not forget what she was fighting for. A part of her, one that was growing smaller with every firefight and every raid, thought it was sad that some griffons could believe the lies the communist ponies peddled. Her brother was been one of them. Now, he was somewhere beyond those trees. Unaware or uncaring that he would thrown away the second he was no longer useful.\n\nShe shook her head, snapping herself from those soft thoughts. He had made his choices. Nothing but the trial of battle and victory over the traitors could bring him redemption. So she fixed her gaze beyond again, and waited. That trial would come soon enough."

 griffons.152.d:0 "Fifty-three.\n\nThe gnat panicked. It shouted into the forest, pointing its rifle to nowhere and shooting wildly into the same when it didn't get a response. Hidden far as she was, she could see the panic in its eyes. Wild, rolling, like the diseased animal it was. Helga had seen this act countless times before. A crack rang out a second time, and the gnat crumpled to the ground.\n\nFifty-four.\n\nNo others came to swarm, but she did not let herself relax. Not when the nation was still diseased. The vectors of it came in every form- yak, penguin, and foreign creatures alike. But the ponies were the most infectious of all. They festered the red plague, and enthralled the poor griffon into turning traitor. It was all their fault, this and everything else. She didn't believe it before, but she had learned. In every friend she had seen blown to pieces or torn apart by gunfire. In the blood on her claws that wouldn't wash off. In the numbing of her heart which felt emptier every day. Even so, if the war ended tomorrow she would still keep fighting on, until Nova Griffonia was purged of all its impurities.\n\nA twitch of movement led her eyes to the underbrush. As she guided her aim to the point she thought of Frederick. It was hard not to mourn her brother. She didn't know how she hadn't seen it, but he was sick long before the war began. She couldn't help him. Dead or alive, there was no cure to save the grifftraitor. If the day ever came where she met him again, she was duty-bound to put him out of his misery. She found that her heart had finally stopped hurting at the thought.\n\nThe underbrush moved again. A pony head poked out, just enough that she could see the sliver of its garish coat. She shot. Another crack whipped through the forest. Helga did not see the body, but she knew she had delivered the only mercy a Falcon could give."

 griffons.153.d:0 "It was too early to make out the bodies littering the field. They were dark mounds, contorted in their place like puppets cut from their strings. Only the most basic of uniforms were used throughout the war, but now even those caps and patches were dirty with mud and gore. The stench was overwhelming. The battle that took place here had been one of the last, which still raged on even as peace was secured. Now, the cacophony of war was replaced with near silence. Birds called in the distance, at least those that weren't busy with picking off the corpses. Masked griffons roved the field, trudging through blasted and uneven ground. One by one, the limp bodies were put onto stretchers or just dragged off.\n\nThe dead were mostly shot, that was a given, though sometimes decomposition made it hard to see exactly where. Sometimes they looked as if they were sleeping. However they went, it was rarely novel, and the vultures present didn't give them a second thought. Until...\n\nIn the midst of the clean-up, two bodies were found. Soldiers, clawing into one another in the perfect picture of animal rage, talons gripping into flesh that even in death they could not be pried apart. As the sky began to lighten, the features of these two griffons became more clear. One of the vultures present remarked that they looked related- like brother and sister, even. The group gathered laughed about that. Then, the novelty wore off. It was, after all, just another tragedy. They were dragged off, and as they did in life, they were buried in death. When all was said and done, a priest would pray over the mass grave."

 griffons.154.d:0 "Cold winds greeted Redtail's visit to the training camp alive with activity. Everycreature seemed moving about with a determined sense of purpose, and 'everycreature' was the exact word Redtail could use to describe what he was seeing. Races of all kinds composed the ranks of drilling soldiers, talking comrades, and the marching voices echoing out cadences. The very proof of their cause being so true that it transgressed the barriers of physical appearance made Redtail smile, and rounding a barracks corner gifted him a fine example of that with the sight of a senior sergeant berating a newly arrived lieutenant.\n\n"I DON'T CARE IF YOU ARE LEADING BATS OR MONKEYS OR MAGIC-FORSAKEN ALICORNS, YOU ARE LEADING THIS PLATOON AND THAT'S AN ORDER!!"\n\nThe new lieutenant flinched, "B-but I don't know anything about these creatures! What if—"\n\nThe senior sergeant thwacked the lieutenant with a swift flick of a wing and kneeled to beak level with the lieutenant knocked into the snow. "THEN MOLT SOME FEATHERS, AND GET OVER IT. OR GET OUT!!!"\n\nRedtail observed the senior sergeant storm off and leave the lieutenant to pick himself up, who jumped at the sudden line of ponies standing-to with salutes. They were the lieutenant's platoon, and the griffon had his orders.\n\n"At ease! I'm Lt. Henri Preen...a-and, I'll be your new commanding officer."\n\nRedtail beamed with pride and left the lieutenant to his introductions."

 griffons.155.t:0 "The Gift From Vesalipolis"
 griffons.155.d:0 "Ironclaw looked down at the military parade from the balcony of the Governor's Mansion. Weter had awoken to a mode of full festivity. Highhill's insistence on maintaining the military bands had finally paid off- they played patriotic music to the tune of staccato boots. But what he cared the most about was that massive line of panzers, three full divisions, that rumbled down the street. The masses that surrounded them, rainbow-coloured specks from his view, cheered wildly as they waved their flags and threw their streamers. The soldiers that marched now would join the front soon enough, and they would bring victory against the traitors.\n\nPride swelled in the general's breast, and he saluted at his Panzerfalcons as they passed the mansion. His Falcons saluted back, and in a practised synchronization, yelled out "Hail Ironclaw!" in unison as they passed by. He smirked and nodded.\n\n"Nice pigeons you've got trained there," Highhill glowered next to him. He'd almost forgotten he was there. Next to the marshal, further down, were the Changeling aides. They seemed more invested in the parade than Highhill sneering at him. "Got them doing flips for you too, don't you?"\n\nIt took all of Ironclaw's will not to sneer right back. He composed himself, "They are not simple prey animals, good marshal. They are hunters, Falcons! These gifts from the Queen will show those red degenerates what the true inheritors of griffonhood are capable of!"\n\nHighhill was undaunted. "I sold a part of Nova Griffonia's soul for these rust buckets. You better hope that rhetoric of yours actually kills some bloody commies, or else I'll scatter away this little flock of yours."\n\nIronclaw gulped. Ever since the start of the civil war the marshal had been much, much more ornery than he had ever known him to be. It was obvious to him that he couldn't keep up with the stresses of rulership. Nevertheless, he nodded."

This turn of events is not unexpected at all as they had made a show of threatening us before. This time, however, there is no bluff. We must now seriously consider what to do. There are those of our number that want us to raise up arms against the griffons to make them bleed for every inch of our commune. Meanwhile, the much, much, much more moderate voices of our community say that we should just listen to their demands and hope they don't kill us. Whatever the case is, there is one thing we can all agree on: the whole situation is rotten."

The question now is what to do with the commune we've been granted. The initial plan was always to annex it into our own lands and be done with it. But considering how easy they've made it for us, and the surprising amount of ponies that live there, perhaps it would be better to grant them "independence"... under our guidance, of course."

While it is incredibly idiotic for such a tiny-nation state to stand against us, it presents us with a problem all the same. Some members of our military staff seem to think the ponies of that commune are planning something dastardly, and fighting against them will only end in a military embarrassment that will make us the laughing stock of Equus. Our more competent generals have decried this as the coward's talk that it is, and demand that we rush in guns first and get it over with. "

 griffons.159.d:0 "Morning broke over Nova Griffonia. The colony was awake, and for the first time in a long time, it awoke to peace. In all major cities griffons who had been taking up picket signs for months made their way to work. To the factories that they had blocked, to the railways they had held hostage, to the mines which they had used as their linchpin against the industrialists. There was still a sense of tension there, the insecurity of not knowing what would come next, but it had abated. For now, at least, they were content.\n\nIn the countryside, yeogriffs and ranchers had been up for hours. Here the worries of the urban dwellings were worlds away. Still, the steady stream of news from before- where protests, counter-protests, riots, and all sorts of urbanite ills captured their imagination and, many times, made them glad they weren't there, had petered out. One thing less for them to worry about.\n\nFurther afield into the country, in the true outskirts, were the agitators, the dreamers, and those who sat in wait with rifle and knife in claw. To them, this was simply a lull in the battle for freedom as they saw it. An opportunity, many of them thought, would make itself known soon enough.\n\nAnd finally, in the governor's mansion in Weter, Teafeather looked over reports from all over the colony. Crisis after crisis, strike and riot, he had been pushing his new economic policy for the chance that it would stabilize Nova Griffonia. At least, long enough for him to be able to build it up to the valuable vassal he knew it was. To his surprise, it seemed his efforts had finally paid off. For the first time in what seemed like a lifetime, he felt at ease. His hopes of a pleasant break from it all were finally within reach.

You have an excellent vision for the future of warfare, seeing as you've come to me." He said, calm yet eager, smiling softly to the sensation of air brushing against his face and mane.

Is this an acceptable price to support the revolution at our borders?"
 griffons.177.a:0 "Absolutely!"
 griffons.177.b:0 "We're sorry. We can't afford this."
 
 griffons.178.t:0 "High Time"
 griffons.178.d:0 "Do not get us wrong, we are all up for free relationships in our beloved country. Even the politicians are entitled to have their private lives set up the way they want - of course, as long as they do keep them private and not let their fancies influence the fate of the common griff.\n\nSo what about our darling Marshall Highill, very good friend of the late governor Teafeather? There is surely no need to recount all his merits. After all, he is quite generous (with the size of donations taken), ever so brave (against the greatest enemy of the nation, lawful protesters) and definitively diligent (alas, not in the official duties). Do we truly deserve such a grand defender in the face of adversities the world around intends to bring at our doorstep? Of course, we would never doubt his prowess on the battlegrounds of pillows and blankets, and even the numerous unconfirmed rumors regarding his slight incompatibility with trifles such as logistics or military tactics only strengthen our adoration.\n\nOn a pointedly unrelated note, if the readers consider visiting our history section, they will find the most curious article about ancient customs of our ancestors. We advise special attention to the practice of burying the partner of a departed ruler with them, regardless of their own closeness to mortality. Back then it was dignified, now it is most certainly barbaric, but maybe for the sake of the good old times we should revive this tradition, just once?"

 newsg.2.t:0 "Governor of Nova Griffonia Shot Dead!" #TODO: CONSIDER REWRITING
 newsg.2.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Anarchy has consumed Nova Griffonia as Governor Teafeather has been declared dead this morning after an unidentified assassin shot him at the beerhouse Emperor's Head. An emergency government is being set up to lead in his place amid the armed political movements reported to have been consolidating control over the colony's different regions. While the death count is relatively low so far, reaching under double digits, it remains to be seen who the new government will select for leadership. However, any new governor will face the challenge of uniting a nation sharply divided between radical republicans and radical authoritarians."

 newsg.3.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]After a protracted struggle, the socialists and republicans reign victorious after the surrender of Field Marshal Highhill's remaining forces. In the wake of the political disaster that began with Governor Teafeather's assassination, proponents of democracy armed themselves, hoping to not only overturn a dictator but also the entire government with the purpose of uplifting the common griffon. With their victory today, it seems that Nova Griffonia no longer needs masters, whether marshal or emperor, as every citizen is invited to participate in the country's first ever elections."

In the wake of the political disaster that began with Governor Teafeather's assassination, proponents of democracy armed themselves, hoping to not only overturn a dictator but also the entire government with the purpose of uplifting the common griffon. With this counter-coup, it seems that Nova Griffonia no longer needs masters, whether marshal or emperor, as every citizen is invited to participate in the country's first ever elections."

 newsg.5.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Following his recent coup d'etat, Highhill, newly appointed Leader of the Nova Griffonia, has now ordered for him to be officially crowned Emperor of the Griffons. The coronation took place inside the Grand Barracks of the capital, followed up by a speech of Highhill to his subjects and a mighty military parade. "The days of chaos and instability are over," Highhill spoke to his people. "Our nation shall be one of unison, strength and determination. It is time for us to rise up and reclaim our rightful spot on the world stage! It is time to reclaim the honour and glory of the empire!" The speech was followed up by mighty choirs of cheering griffons down in the streets of the capital. Although he seems hot-headed and determined, it is still to see whether he is really to come back on his promises and goals. The world is holding its breath for the time being."

 newsg.6.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]After a recent military coup d'etat, Reyhard Ironclaw and his supporters seized power in Nova Griffonia. The following months, Ironclaw made an attempt at realising his ambitions, by enacting policies that supported Griffon superiority, even going as far as to revive slavery of foreign races.\n\nNow, after having conquered foreign lands for himself, he has been given by his puppet-parliament absolute power, including rule by decree, under much celebration. The neighbours of the new Western Griffonian National State are now worried that Ironclaw's ambitions might not yet end there, and they are preparing for a possible invasion from this new, rising National State."

 newsg.7.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Today, Stalliongrad officially accepted the request of direct military intervention from Republican Nova Griffonia. Already, tanks and planes rush north to reinforce the dream of a free Nova Griffonia. The National Salvation Junta has denounced Stalliongrad as well as the Republicans for calling in foreign aid, but this may well turn the tide of the civil war."

The former Imperial colony has long claimed that the settlement and its surrounding region should be ceded to them, and with Equestria's Civil War still raging they decided to finally act rather than wait for a diplomatic solution. Officials from all of the competing Equestrian governments we were able to contact had no comment on the matter, but [From.GetLeader] was quick to declare the annexation a mission of mercy to save those in the area from the harrows of war that have so engulfed the rest of Equestria. Residents inside the village were wary of their new overlords, with many claiming that they really didn't have a choice in the matter but that it was better than dying for some distant ruler, while others were more enthusiastic for the change."

 newsg.9.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]To great surprise of everyone in Nova Griffonia, Erwin Highhill has dissolved the military junta that had been established following his coup. In his place steps a relatively unknown figure, Skeiron Goldfeather, who, as some rumours say, aims to bring radical changes to Nova Griffonia and its society.\n\nThe state, as Goldfeather argues, has had too much control over the life and wealth of the citizens of Nova Griffonia. As such, the state should take a backseat, and allow for a wave of privatisation. For now, it appears that the authoritarian rule in Nova Griffonia has ended. However, it is unclear to the world what exactly Goldfeather and his government have in store."

 newsg.10.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]The military leader of Nova Griffonia, Erwin Highhill, has today been overthrown by yet another coup, carried out by a paramilitary group of Griffons. These griffons, also called the 'Falcons of Griffonstone' are controlled by the FfIfG party, a party that is fiercely griffon supremacist.\n\nReyhard Ironclaw, the leader of the movement and now dictator of Nova Griffonia, has already attempted to calm the people down. He says there will be no harm done to them, and that he and his followers only wish to strengthen Nova Griffonia and the Griffon species as a whole."

### Leader Descriptions ###
 teabird_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 17th of May, 950 in Crona\n\n§YBiography§!: One of the nation's last semblance of stability, Imperial Governor Teafeather is no stranger to political upheaval. His noble lineage provided him a well-rounded education before his appointment as Nova Griffonia's Imperial Governor, a position he retained even after the Kemerski Revolution unfolded on the Griffonia mainland.\n\nAcross the ocean, the distant lands of Nova Griffonia eventually felt the ripple of this Revolution in the form of Ulla Redtail's coup in the 990's, but the attempt would be quashed. Despite failure forcing Ulla into hiding, many radical ideas still broil in the minds of Nova Griffonians, especially within left-leaning factions. Teafeather's abilities—particularly his forte for diplomacy between all parties—prevented further mass turmoil and bloody destruction, but this had led to the volatile political landscape of Nova Griffonia today.\n\nTeafeather continues trying to balance the rapidly changing country, but he dreams to fly off on vacation to visit his beloved niece, Runa Teafeather; even despite ridiculous rumors of her pro-republicanism. Yet despite having many opportunities, the Imperial Governor is compelled to remain and rescue the deteriorating state of affairs, for lives of all in Nova Griffonia. Perhaps when circumstances are better, Teafeather can finally take his vacation leave..."
 always_depressed_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 17th of September, 968 in Nieuw Mirabelle\n\n§YBiography§!: Once enlisted in Nova Griffonia's army, Private Silverwing reached the rank of Sergeant during his time serving in the Frontier performing security and anti-gang operations. Unlike his older superiors, who had been serving since Nova Griffonia's expansion into yak territories, Silverwing held no racial disdain nor prejudice towards non-griffons, a view he would keep to himself even beyond his end-service date. Only when Nova Griffonia's precursor republican political group opened a branch in his hometown of Nieuw Mirabelle did Silverwing finally expressed his beliefs, and his service merits and understandings later elected him to lead representative of republicanism in his hometown.\n\nContrary to his rough exterior, Silverwing made the decision to not let his constituents partake in Ulla's Revolution during the 990's. Backlash would be harsh, but the decision ultimately spared his hometown from the Revolution's crackdown, leaving him and faint number of smaller non-participant branches the last republican representatives left for Imperial Governor Teafeather to negotiate with after. Thus, the party was reformed and soon elected Silverwing's office as its core.\n\nYet instability has driven radicalism on all sides, and Silverwing must navigate his party's direction carefully if the Republican dream is to have any chance of surviving."
 chadhill_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of June, 949 in Griffenheim\n\n§YBiography§!: Describing Marshal Highhill as old only testifies to his role in Nova Griffonia's history. Hailing from one of the Griffonian Empire's many prestigious imperial officer schools, he would make landfall in the colony of Nova Griffonia and spend years working his rank up to General. These promotions, all well-earned, lauded him enduring respect of Nova Griffonia's forces, and it would be him who led the colony's army in taking the last additional territories from the yaks.\n\nHe accomplished all of this, and then the Kemerski Revolution fractured the Griffonian Empire he pledged his life to. So when Ulla Redtail attempted a revolution of her own, General Highhill led the ground forces crushing it, showing restraint in the aftermath only by request from his close friend: Nova Griffonia's own Imperial Governor Teafeather. Highhill soon was promoted to the rank of Marshal afterwards, though this hasn't stopped pro-republican presses from publishing scandalous libel about his relationship to Teafeather—one that Highhill has refuted many times as simply one of very close colleagues.\n\nMuch of the army disregards these rumors, only viewing Marshal Highhill as a proven exemplar of good leadership, and many more are willing to follow wherever he leads."
 ultimate_griffon_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of June, 951 in Skyfall\n\n§YBiography§!: Those who quickly decry Goldfeather as 'greedy' never had the level of ambition needed to succeed like Goldfeather. Through personal connections within the Skyfall Trade Federation, Goldfeather set out to Nova Griffonia for profit and now sits with fancy clothes as its wealthiest industrial magnate. Mines and factories around the Weter and Dulli Mountains bear Goldfeather's logo and expand the griffon's pockets and width by the day. If money makes the world go round, Goldfeather sees no reason to not be the one who directs the flow and be one who enjoys its finer qualities—even if it continues to expand his suit size.\n\nBeneath his greedy ambition and gluttonous feathers hidden by tailored suits, however, is the mind of a shrewd and practical business owner. Many audits have yielded nothing outside the bounds of Nova Griffonia's laws, no matter how hard the smug griffon's business rivals have tried; though, that isn't to say Goldfeather will not play dirty when opponents aren't playing fair...\n\nWhereas the situation in Nova Griffonia is widely seen as dire, Goldfeather sees it as a dire opportunity not to waste. Regardless, Goldfeather aims to gain from whichever side proves most profitable; including maybe his own?"
 caesar_from_fnv_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 3rd of December, 967 in Vot\n\n§YBiography§!: Leader of Nova Griffonia's nationalism movement, Ironclaw has risen to the leader of the Falcons—a nationalistic and racist organization serving as the answer to many whom live in the rural regions of the country. Born behind the mountainsides and away from the more developed east, Ironclaw experienced firstclaw much of the resentment and prejudices of non-griffon minorities inhabiting the frontier lands like many other young griffons growing up there, finding himself either the victim or the perpetrator of racially-motivated scuffles.\n\nBy the time Ulla Redtail's revolution erupted in Nova Griffonia, Ironclaw was already a member of the Falcons, and he with many other griffons flocked the countryside to snuff out any revolutionary elements they could find. Widely seen as a group responsible for keeping order in the broader rural areas of Nova Griffonia, the Falcons now use their recognition to grow and push for their group's beliefs in the theatre of politics.\n\nIronclaw's bold mannerisms and fierce words often cause many politicians to reject many of organization's proposals (including one blatantly calling for the removal of all non-griffons), but the Falcons' membership grows as many griffons begin viewing Ironclaw's extreme ideas as the only real countenance to change..."

Becoming a staunch follower of Caramel Marks' ideas, he routinely communicated with Steel Stallion and took many visits back even after returning to Nova Griffonia. Joining his country's growing communist party, Redtail worked to expand its bureaucracy. The aging griffon's ideals and loyalty, however, would be put to the test when his sister—Ulla Redtail—assumed control over the party and launched her violent Revolution across Nova Griffonia. Unable to betray his sister, let alone his ideals, Heinrich joined the revolution, if only to manage its administration.\n\nThe Revolution ended in failure, and order was restored harshly. His sister would end up fleeing her death sentence, leaving him as last official of authority for Imperial Governor Teafeather to deal with. Surprisingly, Teafeather decided to spare him, and concessions were negotiated.\n\nHowever, as the last organization of communism in Nova Griffonia, Heinrich finds his party swelling, particularly with far-left radicals who believed in Ulla's methods. By legalities and ideals, Heinrich strives to bring the ideals of Caramel Marks to Nova Griffonia for the betterment of all creatures."

Inheriting assets spanning from the northern coast to across the straight and finally several large factories in Nouveau Aquileia, Blackpeak flexed his wings and assumed possession. Under the young griffon's ownership, these far-flung assets would become the foundations to Blackpeak's current industrial conglomerate.\n\nWith change roiling throughout Nova Griffonia, it comes as a shock that Blackpeak—ever so committed to his business industry—listens and communicates with the unions he's allowed to organize among his employees.\n\n"I—the proprietor—need to care for all factors to grow my business, including the needs of my employees which are more easily managed via unions. The 990's Revolution showed me that the radical communist wants to tear down something they think wronged them, and an autocrat wants to take everything because they say so. The regular communist is generally more open to negotiation and compromise than the everyday autocrat."\n\nHow effective this blend of ideals serves him and his businesses throughout Nova Griffonia's powder-keg, Blackpeak assumes, will be determined fairly soon."

Being the only child, Daniel had a very happy early life in Winghagen. Just like his father, he decided to apply to the officer academy and managed to graduate.\n\nIt was at this time where his political beliefs started to take shape. As an idealistic harmonist he argued that the emergency powers granted to President Kemerskai were a step too far that threatened the future of the Republic. Eventually these concerns grew to the point that made him decide to abandon the republican cause. Knowing desertion to be a serious crime he decided to escape to Nova Griffonia – a well-known safe haven for political exiles and outcasts. Thanks to his officer experience he got accepted into the Nova Griffonian military and quickly rose through the ranks, eventually becoming a Militia Commander.\n\nHe is a stout supporter of Wilhelm Silverwing and his Nova Griffonian Social Democratic Front. In 1003 ALB Daniel was part of the Nova Griffonian delegation to the Equestria Games held in Crystal City. During his short stay there he managed to learn a lot about new developments in the art of warfare thanks to contact with military officers from other delegations.\n\nDaniel sternly considers himself Gryphussian despite being raised in Northern Griffonia. He believes that all creatures of the world are created equal – no matter the race. In his opinion Griffonia should be united once again under a democratic federation of nations, arguing that a centralized state is too vulnerable to corruption and injustice.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Scroup"

While the circumstances of her birth have been clouded by Rockfeller's own efforts, we have extrapolated that she is indeed his biological daughter from medical records taken from Celestia's Sun Hospital in Las Pegasus.\n\nIn 1006 she made her eighteenth attempt at running away following an arranged marriage with [REDACTED] of HorseCo. She managed to flee North to Nova Griffonia and escaped to an island under Stalliongrad's control known as "Azkaban." She was subsequently offered for ransom by "rogue" elements of the Communist Party there.\n\nThe bounty hunter Jean De Basse, on contract from General Petroleum, performed a successful rescue mission but has refused to return her to the company.

Jarvet was killed fighting against the 985 Reign of Terror in Aquileia, forcing Jean to flee to Skyfall with his mother as a child.\n\nWhat happened in his youth cannot be determined without asking the griffon himself. All that is known for sure is the young De Basse accrued a large debt while working for the various oligarchs in Skyfall as hired muscle with his inheritance: his father's armor.\n\nEventually, the oligarchs decided to collect on their debt. A contract opened on Jean in 1001 and he fled once more to Nova Griffonia. Late in 1006, Jean De Basse was forced into a contract to capture Paddy Rockfeller. A shocking series of escapades, skirmishes, and adventure led to Jean breaching his contract and fleeing with Paddy to Nova Griffonia to fight for their freedom...all for highest bidder, of course."
 GRF_DESC_SUS_GRIFFON:0 "An objective too far? Perhaps.\n\nThe ideological violence drew the distant interest of the Changeling Lands, and an attache was dispatched to assist with putting down the communists. The attache's cadre made its way to the lands of Nova Griffonia... and were mocked and ostracized by abject racism encouraged and practiced by the population. Promptly, the changeling attache was banished with extreme prejudice.\n\nYet a tank specialist of the attache remained undeterred. The changeling morphed into a griffon and assumed the name "Russel Schwanz". Highhill and his junta, who before spurned the changeling attache away, eagerly accepted this fellow 'griffon' possessing the abilities and knowledge to help defeat them defeat communists.\n\nWith the supremacists prevailing, Russel Schwanz's efforts have lauded him to the rank of General and command over new tank divisions inspired by Nova Griffonia's own Falcons. Against his wishes, the changeling is now forced to keep the appearance of General "Russel Schwanz" at all times and lead these racist, nationalistic griffons into battle."

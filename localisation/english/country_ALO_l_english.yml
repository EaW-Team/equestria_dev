ALO_remnant:0 "Broken Kingdom"
ALO_remnant_desc:0 "Alwani was once a great Kingdom, controlling the lands which today belong to Timbucktu and the Central Zebrican Empire. But the rising Mazwi in the south shattered them and subjugated their people. The royal family survived as they were taken hostage, while a governor from Ziani was sent out to govern the north.\n\nAfter the Storm King's invasion and the collapse of Mazwi, the rightful King of Alwani fled north to his homeland and demanded fealty from all former subjects of his dynasty. Yet the rich city of Timbucktu had grown haughty and rejected him, and a mad yeti warlord seized the eastern lands. Not many zebras swore fealty to him, leaving the King in control of a tiny strip of land, and the legitimacy of the Kingdom is shaky at best."
ALO_desert_tribes:0 "Allied Desert Tribes"
ALO_desert_tribes_desc:0 "Among the most loyal followers of the King are the nomadic tribes of the Zubian desert and refugees from the Central Zebrican Empire. They are hardy zebras, adapted to the harsh Zebhara desert, and have mastered the art of hit-and-run warfare. Their skills are already being spread to the slowly growing Royal Army."

### equipment ###

 ALO_melee_equipment_0:0 "Iron-Tipped Bows & Spears"
 ALO_melee_equipment_0_short:0 "Bows & Spears"
 ALO_melee_equipment_0_desc:0 "The humble spear and the bow have been the traditional weapons of choice for warriors in the Great Lakes region. The spears and arrows usually have tips of sharpened well-forged iron, capable of piercing the most commonly used protection, padded armour and wooden shields, effectively. Additionally, arrows are often coated in deadly poisons created by potion-makers, meaning even a minor wound can be lethal."
 ALO_melee_equipment_1:0 "Mazwian Matchlock Musket"
 ALO_melee_equipment_1_short:0 "Mazwian Musket"
 ALO_melee_equipment_1_desc:0 "The matchlock musket was a revolutionary weapon in the Great Lakes. With their extensive gold reserves, the Mazwians imported thousands of firearms from abroad and eventually learned to make them by themselves. This weapon was instrumental in their rapid expansion which led to the domination of the Imperial Mazwi for two centuries."
 ALO_infantry_equipment_0:0 "Rifle-Musket"
 ALO_infantry_equipment_0_short:0 "Rifle-Musket"
 ALO_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "Rifled barrels started appearing in the Great Lakes only when foreign rifles were imported from abroad. While initially used alongside traditional smoothbore weapons, the barrels of muskets were gradually replaced with rifled ones. These transitional weapons were rather crude as local blacksmiths were still learning the rifling process and the creation of conical hollow bullets that made rifles more effective than muskets."
 
 ALO_artillery_equipment_0:0 "Iron Cannons"
 ALO_artillery_equipment_0_short:0 "Iron Cannons"
 ALO_artillery_equipment_0_desc:0 "As zebras in the Great Lakes acquired artillery from abroad, they primarily used them on war canoes to dominate the many rivers and lakes of the region. This gave waterborne vessels impressive firepower and greatly increased their importance in warfare. Of course, sometimes it was necessary to use such cannons on land. In such cases cannons were mounted on wheels dragged by a group of slaves."

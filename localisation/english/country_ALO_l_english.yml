ALO_remnant:0 "Broken Kingdom"
ALO_remnant_desc:0 "Alwani was once a great Kingdom, controlling the lands which today belong to Timbucktu and the Central Zebrican Empire. But the rising Mazwi in the south shattered them and subjugated their people. The royal family survived as they were taken hostage, while a governor from Ziani was sent out to govern the north.\n\nAfter the Storm King's invasion and the collapse of Mazwi, the rightful King of Alwani fled north to his homeland and demanded fealty from all former subjects of his dynasty. Yet the rich city of Timbucktu had grown haughty and rejected him, and a mad yeti warlord seized the eastern lands. Not many zebras swore fealty to him, leaving the King in control of a tiny strip of land, and the legitimacy of the Kingdom is shaky at best."
ALO_desert_tribes:0 "Allied Desert Tribes"
ALO_desert_tribes_desc:0 "Among the most loyal followers of the King are the nomadic tribes of the Zubian desert and refugees from the Central Zebrican Empire. They are hardy zebras, adapted to the harsh Zebhara desert, and have mastered the art of hit-and-run warfare. Their skills are already being spread to the slowly growing Royal Army."

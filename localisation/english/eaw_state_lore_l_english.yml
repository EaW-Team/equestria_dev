state_lore_text_container_state_name_75:0 "The §YCity that Never Sleeps§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_75:0 "Throughout its illustrious history, §CManehattan§! has been given many titles: the City of Dreams; the Big Apple; Caput Mundi — the Capital of the World. Situated where the Hayston River meets the Celestial Sea, the §YThree Boroughs§! — Manehattan and its satellites, §YHayston§! and §YBronclyn§! — make up this sprawling megalopolis on the §CEast Coast§! of Equestria.\n\nBeing Equestria's largest and most populous city, Manehattan is also the most diverse. As the premier seaport of the continent, centuries of continuous foreign immigration has meant that, alongside the ponies of the Three Tribes, there exist substantial communities of thestrals, hippogriffs, zebras, kirin, and griffons within the metropolis. Canterlot may be the seat of the Diarchy, but it is the melting-pot of Manehattanite society that truly embodies the Equestrian spirit — that of harmonious coexistence, strength in diversity, and friendship free of prejudice.\n\nThe glamour of Manehattan's nightlife and entertainment industry, and its unassailable status as an international locus of arts and culture, all belie the true roots of the city's wealth — its §Ymassive industrial base§!, located on the outskirts of the suburbs. If one should gaze to the west from the crown of the Mare Statue, over and beyond the elegant arches of the Bronclyn Bridge, they would glimpse the smokestacks and cranes that juxtapose a parallel skyline — one that is gritty and grimy, yet no less grand — against the opalescence of the skyscrapers downtown.\n\nThe §CCelestial Sea Fleet§! — the backbone of the §YEquestrian Royal Navy§! — has its moorings in the deep waters and sheltered bays of Manehattan Harbour. Where prodigious amounts of capital flow through the wharfs and dockyards of Bronclyn, from Griffonia, Zebrica, and §Ybeyond§!, the iron hoof of maritime law ensures that the waters around the metropolis are kept safe, from threats both monstrous and mundane.\n\nLike all big cities, Manehattan has its fair share of problems. Only a few blocks away from the glitzy shopping avenues of Bridleway are run-down waterfront neighbourhoods teeming with the city's immigrant proletariat, and in the shadow of Manehattan's skyscrapers lie the inner-city slums and ghettoes — the proverbial undergrowth of the concrete jungle. Should the centuries-long peace in Equestria collapse, there is no doubt that strife and scarcity will come to Manehattan; in the face of rationing, curfews, and blackouts, it is all too easy to forget about solidarity and friendship.\n\nNow, in the new millennium, the city is threatened from without and within. Across the sea, §RGriffonia§! is poised for a decade of brutal conflict, whilst Manehattan's own §CLunarists§! grow more belligerent by the day, as the horrors of mechanized warfare encroach on ponies' nightmares. In the years to come, what fate will befall this great city?\n[eaw_state_lore_75_addendum]"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_75_addendum:0 "\n—————————————————————————————————————\n\nFollowing the defeat of the Principality of Equestria in the §RGreat War§!, the East Coast fell under the control of the victorious Changeling Hegemony. In the year §Y[?MAN.MAN_WS_GetFormDate]§!, §GQueen Chrysalis§! would subsequently devolve the governance of the East Coast to a military Protectorate centered around Manehattan.\n\nUpon the arrival of the §CProtectress Lilac§! in the city, the §GChangeling Administration§! commandeered the Crystaller Building — the tallest skyscraper in all of Equestria — as the headquarters for the new regime, whilst the Garrison's Schutzbataillons occupied the barracks and military bases vacated by the disbanded Equestrian army.\n"

Walking down the storied streets and avenues that make up the pristine city, you can spot the small tell-tale signs of the §R1002 Canterlot Invasion§!. And yet, looking at the vibrant life in the city; the cafés, the restaurants, the theaters, the parties, the soirees, you wouldn't be able to tell. Canterlot, as with the rest of Equestria, has moved on, content in their idea that the changelings were a bad event but one that will never repeat itself. Least of all anyone expects is for §RQueen Chrysalis§! to come back. But whatever the history, Canterlot is, and has been in step with the rest of the country. As Equestria grew under those first years under Luna and Celestia, so did Canterlot. When Equestria industrialized and grew past the years of medieval castles and nobles, Canterlot did too, when Luna was welcomed into the fold, it happened in Canterlot. Be it during the battle against Nightmare Moon, the battle against the Changelings, or indeed, as it has been for most of its history, the vibrant capital of Equestria, the home of ponies and Harmony, watched over by Princess Celestia's gaze, Canterlot has always been a snapshot of Equestria and its condition.\n\nBut indeed, if you took up the railroad to Canterlot, arriving at the palace, you will find the curriculum at the School for Gifted Unicorns the same as it has always been, and at galas at the Canterlot Palace they stick to routines from decades ago. While it may serve Equestria well now, they are outdated for the era, and are overdue for an overhaul. However, if a storm should hit, it would be a woeful one indeed.\n\nTime will tell what will happen to Canterlot as a new era dawns on the world. An era of opportunity, and an era of risk."
state_lore_text_container_state_description_3_special:0 "§YCanterlot§!, the capital of the realm of §CEquestria§!, is still the definitive nexus of the pony nation. Walking down the storied streets and avenues that make up the pristine unicorn city, the battle scars of the §YGreat War§! — and the subsequent defeat of Equestria that would allow the unicorn race to reclaim their rightful hold on the city, in cooperation with their newfound changeling allies — have all but healed. Looking at the vibrant life in the city; the cafés, the restaurants, the theaters, the parties, the soirees, you wouldn't be able to tell that anything was ever amiss. Canterlot, as with the rest of Equestria, has moved into a new golden era under the Pax Chrysalia. The §CGreat Queen Chrysalis§! has avenged her defeat in 1002, and with her return to the city, new opportunities for the unicorns of Equestria have dawned on the nation. Now more than ever, Canterlot is, and always will be, a §Gshining beacon§! for §Cchangeling-unicorn cooperation§! for the rest of the country.\n\nYet the scars of the past are not so easily healed, and must be remembered. As Equestria grew under those first years under Luna and Celestia, so did Canterlot, and with them, the prominence of unicorns in the Equestrian system. When Equestria industrialized and grew past the years of medieval castles and nobles, Canterlot did too, and the unicorns adapted to a new world of politicians and bureaucrats, finding new ways to cement their natural primacy over the lesser races. When Luna was welcomed into the fold, it happened in Canterlot, and the unicorns were the first to welcome their long-lost diarch back into the nation, §Reven as the pegasi and earth ponies rejected her§!. Be it during the battle against Nightmare Moon, the battle against the Changelings, or indeed, as it has been for most of its history, the vibrant capital of Equestria, the home of ponies and Harmony, watched over by Princess Celestia's gaze and a unicorn's guiding hoof, Canterlot has always been a snapshot of Equestria and its condition.\n\nBut indeed, if you took up the railroad to Canterlot, arriving at the palace, you will find the curriculum at the School for Gifted Unicorns revitalized like it never has been before, and the galas at the Canterlot Palace have been overhauled to tailor to unicorns and their changeling friends, with the lesser races excluded from attendance. Finally, after so long, the history of Equestria now reveals the truth of unicorn primacy, and does away with the insidious lie that all equine races were created equal. The unicorns of Equestria have weathered the storm of oppression and forced equality for centuries, and now, it is time to step into the light and assume our rightful place in the sun.\n\nOnly time will tell what will happen to Canterlot, at the dawn of the era of the Pax Chrysalia — an era of industrial opportunity, interracial harmony, and mutual prosperity.\n"

state_lore_text_container_state_description_12:0 "One of the largest cities on the Equestrian east coast only rivaled by §YManehattan§!, Fillydelphia has long been regarded as a center of industry and learning, and one of the cradles of the §YIndustrial Revolution§! in Equestria. It was once known as the workshop of the world, producing goods for export across the planet, and is famed for its medical school located beneath the pegasus district of Bells Air (commonly known as "Little Cloudsdale"). Other notable features of the city are its all-unicorn police force and §RDragon Town§!, a district inhabited exclusively by dragons, as well as the yearly Grapefruit Festival. In recent times the city was struggling with a severe §Cparasprite§! infestation, which took years to clear out.\n\nThe city has a long and rich history, being founded before Luna's Banishment over a thousand years ago, when the Princesses were still young. Indeed, the nickname of the city refers to the mutual love the sisters had for each other, which unfortunately meant that after the Banishment Celestia did everything she could to avoid the city. Despite Canterlot's neglect, Fillydelphia thrived nevertheless. After Luna's return and reformation a grand celebration was held in the city in honour of the Princesses' reconciliation, and the ponies of the city happily welcomed Celestia who could once more visit them without issue."

Both of them have benefited greatly from the recent return of Crystal Empire from limbo, growing even more as centers of commerce and industry. Many crystal ponies inhabit the city and imports from the north are always on sale.\n\nWhinnyapolis surpassed its smaller twin Riverpool during the Industrial Revolution. Flour mills and sawmills powered by the rapids between the towns formed the core of their economy. Nowadays the city is more reliant on commercial services such as banking and transportation, being known as §C"The Gate to Crystal Empire"§!."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_74:0 "Bales is an ancient city, one of the oldest ones in Equestria. Containing countless libraries and book stores, it was known as the §Y"City of Wisdom"§!. However, several decades ago the bustling city §Yvanished into thin air§!, and no one knew why. It remained a mystery until relatively recently.\n\n§GPrincess Twilight Sparkle§! managed to find the hidden city and break the curse that had made it vanish. She learned that a wizard named §YComet Tail the Starry-Eyed§! had cast a spell to protect the many books of the city from harm, but because he did the ritual at the wrong time, it ended up hiding the city entirely from outsiders. She cast the spell at the right time, breaking the curse and revealing the city. The ponies living in it, who had become reclusive over the years, were overjoyed when visitors flooded Bales.\n\nAt the present Bales is a center of learning, trade and book printing, producing ever more tomes not only for its own libraries, but for all the libraries of Equestria. The yearly §YBook Festival§! held in autumn draws ponies from across the nation."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_2:0 "Ponyville, located next to the §GEverfree Forest§! southwest of Canterlot, was for most of its history an unremarkable rural settlement. The first pony inhabitants of the area were part of the §YApple Family§!, who were granted the land as a gift by §YPrincess Celestia§! herself almost a century ago. The first apple orchards were planted, but while the trees grew, the ponies discovered magical §CZap Apples§! inside the Everfree Forest. The jam prepared from these apples became famous, attracting many migrants. Stinkin' Rich, the grandfather of the entrepreneur Filthy Rich, opened a market selling the jam, which soon grew into a burgeoining business. The Apple and Rich families still live in the town to this day and are honoured as its founders.\n\nIn the years since, many ponies have moved to Ponyville, making it a very diverse town. All three races are present and live together in harmony. It is for this reason why Princess Celestia sent her young pupil, §YTwilight Sparkle§!, to live in the town and make some friends. She and the ponies she met soon became close friends and the wielders of the §YElements of Harmony§!, who have saved Equestria from countless threats. After her ascension to Alicornhood and her defeat of §RLord Tirek§!, Twilight Sparkle now lives in the §CCastle of Friendship§! north of the town. Next to it, she has opened the §YSchool of Friendship§! which has students from all across the world.

Such towns are made out of clouds, which only pegasi can walk on, and float in the sky. §CCloudsdale§! is the oldest such town, and is regarded as the home of the Pegasus race.\n\nIt is famed for its architecture, its tall pillars and high halls made entirely from vapor and held together by magic. It also has the largest §CWeather Factory§! in Equestria, for pegasi are responsible for weather management. The clouds, rainbows and snowflakes made in the town are distributed all across the nation. Another notable feature is the §YCloudeseum§!, where the annual Best Young Flyer competition is held.

state_lore_text_container_state_description_13:0 "Baltimare is the largest settlement in the Equestrian South-East, located in the Horseshoe Bay. Originally a small fishing settlement, it industrialized and grew rapidly, mostly thanks to its natural harbour. It became a center of shipping and manufacturing with thriving docks.\n\nHowever, the workers have been treated worse than in many other Equestrian cities, especially during the reign of the last Mayor. Because of this Baltimare became the center of the Equestrian labour movement, housing the headquarters of the CAN-TER anarcho-syndicalist federation of trade unions and anarchists. A large protest had been held in the city during the Winter Revolution in Stalliongrad, and the Mayor of the city had been sacked by Celestia herself.\n\nDue to being located in the South-East, the city also houses a considerable minority of thestrals, whose conditions are even worse than that of the workers, but who are not allowed to join unions. Many Coltjuns from Hayseed Swamps inhabit the city as well, speaking their strange creole of Equestrian and Aquileian."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_38:0 "Surrounded by countless §Yrock farms§! and nestled among hills, Rockville is a center of mining industry and mineral processing. Its name derives from tonnes of rock regularly brought into the city from the farms for refinement. It was an insignificant village before the §Ygemstone rush§! of 931 ALB which attracted countless migrants.\n\nRockville is a city of foundries, steel mills and mines. The landscape around the city is barren and the air in the settlement itself is difficult to breathe. Yet it is also a prospering town, producing a large amount of gold, coal, sulfur, tin, copper, platinum, gemstones and more.\n\nIts inhabitants are grim-faced, their faces often covered in soot, but hard-working and relentless. Some call it the least friendly place in Equestria, but those outsides who have earned the trust of a Rockville pony know that they are the most trusty and reliable companies one may have. The Element of Laughter, §YPinkamena Pie§! (more commonly known as Pinkie Pie) breaks the stereotype by being one of the cheeriest ponies in the country, despite coming from a hardy family of rock farmers."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_66:0 "Among the sparser areas of Southwest Equestria, Las Pegasus stands out as the largest city in the Southwest and is known as the gambling capital and entertainment capital of the continent. It's filled with luxurious hotels, casinos, arcades, amusement parks and restaurants that brought the city much fame. Despite it being a floating cloud-city, even earth ponies and unicorns can walk on it thanks to more modern magical engineering, with long platforms of metal and concrete functioning as walkable streets. The service-orientated economy is thriving, and though there is a lack of farmland to sustain the city, food has always been imported from elsewhere in Equestria. There's something for everyone here, from newborns and young partiers to elders looking for something new and exciting.\n\nUnder this shining cloud-city however is the second half of Las Pegasus. Here, large companies such as Horseco and Rockville Oil dominate, their factories cluttering the cityscape. Gigantic steel foundries churn out endless tonnes of stainless steel, which is used by the huge shipyards in the construction of new luxury cruise ships and military vessels. Surrounding this industrial heart are the apartments of the common workers, who toil in service of large companies. It is fertile ground for leftist movements, some more radical than others, and the ponies of the cloud-city above demand the police to ensure that Stalliongradian influence does not spread. So far, they have only been moderately successful, but as long as Equestria remains stable the proletariat are unlikely to cause trouble."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_14:0 "Located in Luna Bay, Vanhoover contains an excellent natural harbour, and has thus long been a vital port-city. Founded on the ruins of an earlier settlement which had been destroyed by §COlenian Vikings§!, it grew into an important trade port even before industrialisation, being located near the mouth of an important river as well.\n\nAfter the Industrial Revolution, the city grew even more, becoming a vital base of the §YEquestrian Navy§! and a center of shipbuilding. It is the terminus of the transcontinental Equestrian railway and its port is among the largest in the country. Its primary trade good is lumber, imported from Vaverfront across the Luna Bay, but in recent years the service sector has continued to grow. Many movies are filmed here, earning it the nickname "Applewood North", and numerous tourists come there from the south to enjoy the cold weather.\n\nA large portion of the populace consists of Olenian deer, who work on the docks or sell their wares at the markets. There are even some changelings living in the city, though they are viewed with suspicion by the rest of the inhabitants. In recent years the countless dock workers and sailors of the city have unionized and now agitate for better rights. There are rumours that they receive support from the Supreme Soviet of Stalliongrad, but it is not known if this is true."

Despite its size, one might easily think it's a small rural town, thanks to its rustic buildings, many parks and numerous trees. Yet it is in the end an industrial city, as evidenced by the high grain silos and the car traffic on the streets.\n\nTall Tale grew from a humble farming village to a proper city after the Industrial Revolution. Yet it never forgot its roots, being surrounded by farmland and having food processing and transportation as its economic foundations. An important railway leading to §YVanhoover§! passes through the city, and is used to transport countless bags of grain and other farm produce for export. The city is especially famous for its bread, said to be the best in Equestria.\n\nNotable sights include the centuries-old Tall Bridge, the Farmers' Market in the central square of the city, and the Museum of Agriculture. The yearly §YHarvest Festival§! attracts tens of thousands of visitors each year thanks to its generous offering of delicious baked goods."

Established by Equestrian settlers, it is surrounded by apple orchards which are used to produce the town's primary export, famed apple pies. Unsurprisingly, many inhabitants of the town are part of the vast Apple family. It is governed by §YSheriff Silverstar§! who maintains law and order. The town has a saloon known as the Salt Block, a clock tower and a stage for musical performances. It is known for its horse-drawn horse-drawn carriages and local mild west dances.\n\nIn 1001 ALB, Appleloosa was at the epicenter of the short but violent conflict known as the §RApple War§!. It erupted after nearby buffalo tribes demanded the ponies to tear down their orchards, for they had been planted on their traditional stampeding grounds. The ponies refused to destroy their livelihoods and the buffalo attacked. Compromise was only reached when Chief Thunderhooves was downed by an apple pie, which he found to be delicious. Soon a historic agreement was signed: The ponies get to keep their orchards, as long as they gift apple pies to the buffalo. Ever since, peace has prevailed between the two races, but time will tell if it lasts."

In fact, when explorers from northern Equestria first discovered it, they called it a "Lost City" even though it has been continuously inhabited for over a millennium. To this day, the ponies of the Neighua tribe live in the city like their ancestors did.\n\nSurrounding Tenochtitlan is a vast network of canals, gaining their water from the river which flows past the city. On these canals, as well as the river itself, one may find the famed §GFloating Gardens§! -- or what remains of them, at least. The natives still use them to grow plants such as maize, beans and flowers, though many of them are overgrown.\n\nIn the center of the city itself stands the imposing §YPyramid of the Sun§!, the primary religious site of the Neighua. Although it has seen far less use under Celestia's rule (and no sacrifices whatsoever), locals still use it to affirm their loyalty to the Princess. In return, she provides modern medicine, fertilizer, machine tools and more, albeit the natives are left alone to live their peaceful lives in the traditional manner, in huts of stone, mud and wood."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_30:0 "Ayacachtli"
state_lore_text_container_state_name_30:0 "The §YCity§! of the §YMoon§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_30:0 "There is a charm in the city of Ayacachtli that begets wonderous thoughts in anypony; here is a city, that was ancient before Equestria had even been formed. Located in the southern jungles, in the mountains on the border of Badlands, Ayacachtli has the dubious honour of being the oldest thestral city in the world. Legends hold it, that it was constructed by a thestral Moonspeaker with the aid of an Ursa Major. Historians, however, place its origins to many millenia ago, to the times when thestral tribes and the Neighua came into conflict and a need for a safe haven was born. Whatever it may have been, thestrals have been living in the city for so long, that only bare estimates can be given with current historical records.\n\nQuite an unusual aspect about Ayacachtli is the fact it is located inside the mountain range, inside a cast cavern dug over time by its denizens. Even as times have advanced, majority of the city is still located safely there, with just part of the more modern city located outside. Where, along with them, plenty of terraces for farming are located to feed the mountain city. But it is not food that Ayacachtli is known for; for the mountains contain many riches such as copper, silver and gold. Historians have traced many ancient trade routes leading to Ayacachtli from the north, carrying goods such as iron weapons and armour in exchange for the mined minerals. Evidence shows that Ayacachtli served as a vital link for trade between the jungles and north, through which luxury goods such as sugar and cocoa from jungle tribes passed by. Once the princesses proceeded with their formation of Equestria, Ayacachtli found itself in a favourable position - at least until the incident with Nightmare Moon occured. Now shunned, the thesrals returned to living amongs themselves, in fear of respitals and revenge for siding with the horrid monster that had once been their beloved princess. This especially hurt Ayacachtli and the city endured for centuries as but a hollow shell of a once mighty realm.\n\nToday, Ayacachtli stands as a testament for vigority of thestralkind as a near total majority of its denizens are made up of thestrals. Even the ponies there are usually tribals from the jungles, who have interacted with the thestrals far longer than any northener has and even tend to share a common tongue with. Modernization is present in the city but mixed in to tradition and the peculiar aspects of thestrals; Ayacachtli has no real streets, as near-every denizen can fly. This has led to the city developing not horitzontally as a traditional city but primarily vertically. Tall towers, reaching from the cavern's ceiling to the floor, dot the vast cave, with the odd bridge crossing the gaps between them. Even with modern electricity, most of Ayacachtli is cast in but dim light, to better suit the sensitive eyes of thestrals. Further caverns extend out from the main one, which lead to the many mining tunnels; Ayacachtli even to this day is mostly dependant upon its ore exports to many Equestrian industries north; one could perhaps find some irony in how some things never change.\n\nCentral part of the city and an aspect that cannot be missed is the Temple of Moon, located at the city's center and remains a staunchly visited complex by the thestrals. It is the place where every Moonspeaker comes to learn the traditional ways and read the ancient texts stored within there. Some said to more than millenia old but no outsiders are permitted to see them, not even a certain Princess of Books. But what a visitor can see is already extraordinary, and a sight to rival even that of Canterlot. For right past its entrance, visitors are met with a giant dome covering the main hall. On this dome there is a vividly well-detailed star map, one born from countless generations of work from the Moonspeakers. Every possible inch of the carved stone accurately details the wonders of the night sky to the point that astronomers from Princess Luna's Academy of Stars have praised the meticulous work the priests have done, even rivalling achievements historical astronomers such as Galloping Galley and Leap Ordinance. There have been calls to preserve the temple complex for sake of history but for thestrals, however, the temple still serves its original purpose, as it did since its inception; to venerate the Moon, as their forebears did before them. A work that continues on, and will do so for more millenia to come."

But those days of splendour ended when Luna was consumed by jealousy and became §RNightmare Moon§! who tried to slay her beloved sister. Much of the castle was destroyed and Luna was banished to the Moon, but Celestia was overcome with sorrow. She and the entire court abandoned the castle, leaving behind nothing but painful memories.\n\nThe location is avoided almost entirely by ponies, for it is rumoured to be haunted by the dreaded §gPony of Shadows§!. Those few who have dared to enter the ruins have quickly become lost in the labyrinthine hallways of stone, watched by statues of stone dragons eroded by centuries of rain. They will also quickly discover the numerous hidden passages and traps that Princess Luna had commissioned for her amusement, and possibly stumble upon the personal library of Princess Celestia, or what remains of it.\n\nThe §YElements of Harmony§! were hidden in the castle before Nightmare Moon's return, after which they were retrieved by the Wielders of the Elements. In a ravine near the castle is a cave with the §CTree of Harmony§!, planted by the ancient §YPillars of Old Equestria§! a thousand years ago. It is a magical tree which controls and contains the Everfree Forest, and held the Elements before they were used by the Princesses to defeat Discord.

Within centuries, it was one of the largest cities in Equestria, a thriving center of industry always covered in thick smog, especially during cold winters.\n\nYet the growth of the city had a dark side. Its workers were mistreated and discontent grew. Due to its distance from the capital, Princess Celestia remained unaware of the tension before it was too late. The workers revolted, inspired by the writings of Caramel Marks and led by §RSteel Stallion§!, and seceded from Equestria in the Winter Revolution.\n\nAfter Steel Stallion died from illness, the Supreme Soviet renamed Princessyn in his memory to §RStalliongrad§!, which remains the city's name to this day. Nowadays Stalliongrad is a proletarian city, with any remains of capitalism erased. Gone are the houses of the merchants, the markets and the shops, the colourful adverts and the luxurious cars. It is now exclusively the city of smokestacks, factories, apartment blocks, machines, cogs, smoke and steel. In the center stands the imposing Palace of the Soviets, a grand project that has been years in the making, a testament to the industriousness and ambition of the Stalliongradian proletariat."

Weter, near uniquely, is more like Griffonia than the rest of the nation, with tighly packed old-style buildings near the city centre and an opulent gubernatorial palace overlooking a city plaza in which a statue of Grover I stands. Further out, however, the Griffonian veneer fades quickly, and already at the outskirts of the city one can see the more uniquely Nova Griffonian identity spring forth.

Yet, at the same time Nouveau Aquila had had time to develop its own political system of elected mayors and a town council, a system that clashed with the royalist leanings of many of the newcomers. In the end, it was the arrival of Griffonian Empire's fleet and the demand for subjugation under the new colony of §YNova Griffonia§! that stopped things from exploding into outright fighting.\n\nAs Griffonian settlers began to arrive in the town as well, the Aquileian refugees chose to keep to themselves, creating what would become known as §YThe Aquileian Quarter§!, a district of the city that even to this day has a clear Aquileian feel to it in everything from the cuisine to the architecture and even the language. In some ways, this region has kept hold of old cultural artefacts from the old kingdom more than Aquileia ever has.\n\nAlso, ever since its inclusion into Nova Griffonia, the city has considered itself the actual heart of Nova Griffonia, viewing Weter as a colonialist overlord not truly part of the colony. Nouveau Aquilan Griffons have always been eager to settle the deeper regions of the colony, explore new opportunities, serve in the Nova Griffonian militias and however they can leave a mark on their homeland. Weter may the Griffonian Charter, but these descendants of those Aquileian refugees and fishers have worked tirelessly to create their own niches.

The columns and the rooms are, despite the aged look from the outside, brand new, and the conversations are not about who to oppress, but rather how to best prepare for the final war. The outskirts of the city reflects this too. While there were once fields, now massive industrial complexes and tenements tower there, all less than a decade old.

Nowadays, most of the changelings in the city work to maintain the Grand Changeling Armada based in Ditrysium's naval base, a fleet which the changeling admiralty hopes will one day best the Equestrians on the high seas.

For some unknown reason, the lake exhibits magical properties, making it a valued object for study and a source of clear drinking water.\n\nThe city itself straddles the coast of the lake and is way longer than it is wide, with most changelings preferring to live as close to the waterfront as possible. Luckily, waterborne transportation makes it easy to move from one side of the city to the other and the lake is always filled with boats of all shapes and sizes. Because of the northern climate and the relative lack of industry, the air is clear and the city itself feels clean and tidy, a reprieve from some of the more industrialised hives.

However, when one takes a closer look and walks on the streets, there are no massive crowds of griffons from all over the continent like before, the markets sell local products with very few if any exotic luxuries, and the military parades of the Reichsarmee are not what they used to be.\n\nThe city was founded by §YEmperor Grover I§! himself as a capital for his newborn Empire. He chose the marshland in the confluence of the grand §YGriffking river§! and put thousands of prisoners of war to work draining it. Within a decade Griffenheim had become a rapidly growing center of trade, administration, religion and industry. Even the §YArchonate of Boreas§! was moved from Griffonstone to Griffenheim, a decision which remains controversial to this day. As the city grew, it expanded to the other sides of the rivers, requiring gigantic bridges to be built across them. They remain remarkable achievements of construction and are among the longest ones in the world. There are dozens of them, with the latest one being a railway bridge commissioned by Emperor Grover V.\n\nThe capital of the Empire retains the massive state apparatus and the infrastructure required to support it, despite the greatly diminished size of the nation. §YThe Imperial Palace§! is the beating heart of the city, a huge collection of ornate buildings dedicated to housing the Emperor and his vast court. Near it are countless ministries and bureaucratic offices, green gardens and parks, army barracks and famed military academies.

The historical centre is based on rings of canals, lined by the houses of rich merchants, build in the Feathisian style with stair-step gables.

In addition, its distinct warrior traditions and its law codes made it a notable power in the region, one that could well have been a threat to the rising §YGriffonian Empire§!.\n\nAlas, the Katernii fell not on the battlefield, but due to treason.

While it may not be a political center as powerful as say Griffenheim, Canterlot or Rijekograd, it is the most prosperous and industrious city on the continent. Many exquisite goods come out of the city, be them diamonds, cars or fashionable Griffonian clothes, and while Equestria still maintains the lead on modern manufacturing globally, Skyfall is home of the most technically advanced factories and craftgriffs in all of Griffonia. The currently most famous one is the Kessler automobile plant which produces some of the most widely used cars in Griffonia.\n\nSkyfall is known as a city but it is actually a metropolitan community of nineteen smaller towns, each ruled by a mayor and their own local councils. This is merely a near-folkloric archaism as these "towns" have no recognizable borders and some streets can belong to several towns. Even distinguishing them between on the basis of wealth, activities or style is impossible as Skyfall is so chaotically organized that one may leave a street of insalubrious houses only to find mansions just around the corner. Lack of uniformity and charming chaos are indeed the defining features of the city, making it a divisive place to visit. To some, it is an endless wonder to stroll in while an ignominious mess to the more orderly-minded.\n\nSkyfall is home to many landmarks, both old and new. At its historical center sits the Grote Markt, the historical market of the city which was home to the most prestigious guild halls of the city decorated with golden gables, balustrades and statues. Not far of the Grote Markt stands the Skyfall Stock Exchange built in the style of a religious temple and which is the busiest stock exchange in the continent. North of the city, you can find the great Groverian Park, Skyfall's largest park area where the three great temples dedicated to Eyr, Arcturius and Boreas have been built. The great harbour is also known for some of its old market places and warehouses as well as hosting the former Imperial Navy which has been seized and nationalized during Guichard's secession. A hill on the southern part of the city is home to a gigantic palace of justice designed by Joseph Poulaert, a Fezeran-born architect who had sought to create a monument showcasing the might of the law and the Griffonian judiciary. Originally planned under Grover IV's reign, it was finished by Ghislain Guichard's government as a tribute to the Trade Federation dedication to the rule of law though not without the help of some corner-cutting.\n\nSkyfall's population is one of the most diverse on the continent if not the world. Virtually every sentient species is represented in some way despite Griffons forming a plurality of the population. Skyfallians are known to be educated, festive and gregarious if perhaps a bit unsophisticated and plagued with a bizarre accent. They are also known to both rageously enjoy criticizing their city and fiercely call out any foreigners who would dare try to do it themselves. The typical Skyfallian is fatter than the average and usually enjoys more than a little beer or strong liquors as well fried food. It is also known that Skyfallian are very prone to organize themselves in groups and the city is teeming with corporations, old guilds, more recent labour movements, cooperatives and organized crime.

Indeed, the capital of §CAquileia§! is one of the shining beacons of the arts and science in Griffonia and while many cities rest upon the past, Aquila remains forward looking. The beginning of the eleventh century saw the city undergo one of the greatest urbanistic experiments in the history of the continent. As this text is being written, workers are tearing down the old squalid neighborhoods and preparing to build a city design with modernity and reason in mind.\n\nShould one decide to take a walk in the city, they will find many great landmarks and a preview of the city to come: grand avenues decorated to please the eye of the strollers, an innovative subway, modern and delightful rows of apartment buildings, private palaces and hotels and luxurious shops. They will be able to find the great Trinity Hill - finally free of squalor - on top of which lies the three great white temples dedicated to Eyr, Boreas and Arcturius. It is there that the kings of Aquileia have traditionally been crowned as shown by the royal banners and tapestries of the ruling king. The Promenade des Ducs is also a major attraction on the banks of the great Belle river. This fancy avenue is home to many museums, libraries, theaters and private salons where the literate, wealthy or artistic elites meet and mingle. On the western edge of the cities lies the Vieux Fort, an old citadel whose black walls barely survived the sacking of the city by §RGrover II§!, and is now home to the university of the city. In the eastern part of the cities, they will find the Domaine Royal with its great parks and palaces home to the Discret dynasty and the royal government. For those with a taste for the stranger things, many parts of the city hosts a peculiar undercity called the Catacombs which acted for centuries as the city's boneyard. It is said that in the ancient times, it was a holy site dedicated to the banished god Maar.\n\nThe story of Aquila is a unique one for it is one of the few great Griffonian cities that did not owe anything to the old Kingdom of Sparléos. Instead, it was the bastion of freedom for many confederated tribes that would form the realm of Aquileia a century before our era. After becoming the capital of the kingdom, the city became a thriving trading and crafting center, one of the economic hearts of the kingdom. This long era of prosperity saw its decline in the eighth century when Aquileia was subjugated by the §YGriffonian Empire§! and finally ended in 785 when the kingdom and much of its capital was burned down by Grover II's armies. To add insult to injury, the princess Giselda Discret was forced to marry the angry emperor in the ruined temple of Arcturius on Trinity Hill. This saddest of weddings is still commemorated today and princess Giselda hailed as a martyr of the city. After this, the city slowly recovered but it is only after independence in 972 that the city finally saw a return to greatness. Much investment was made into the city by the Republicans between 980 and 985 and finally during the Discret restoration which saw the beginning of the great transformation of the city."

Many merchants were boasting wealth that could easily compete with nobility, and they made sure to show it. Their houses and villas were often opulent and decorated by famous artists.\n\nHowever, for all the splendour many were not lucky to live this lifestyle. To them constant show of wealth and prosperity was nothing short of an insult. When the Revolution took hold of Aquileia, many joined the revolutionaries, managing to wrest control of the City and proclaiming the §RCommune of Pridea§!.\nThis state of affairs lasted until now infamous pirate lord Dennis Discret arrived to pacify the city. For days he §Rbombarded the city with his navy§!, leaving much of the city in ruins before he landed and brutally dealt with the revolutionaries.\n\nThese days Pridea is ruled by the now §YBaron Dennis Discret§!, who gained Pridea for his own as a reward for his actions during the Revolution. Over the years, the city managed to recover from the scars of revolution. The port that once was dominant in the city was rebuilt to its former glory, although these days you might see fewer merchants and more of the former 'associates' of the Baron. Many houses were rebuilt as well though they never reached the level of opulence from before the Revolution. Undoubtedly the new dominant part of the city is the new central square, hosting the new theatre built by the Baron, townhall and cafés and many other establishments, as well as a small park with a fountain for relaxation.\n\nNaturally, when talking about Pridea we cannot forget to mention their Police force established after the Revolution. Pridea was always a home to a §Glarge pony minority§!. During the Revolution, they were quintessential to securing the city. Over the years, Baron Dennis Discret came to rely on them often and they became a regular part of the police force.

The first griffons were given shape by Eyr, giving them their body; wings to reach towards the heavens and beaks to praise the divine. Arcturius gave the griffons their strength; the strength to overcome all evils they might encounter, the strength to build mighty structures and tools and to overcome personal hardships. Boreas gave them intelligence, an understanding of themselves and of truth and rationality. An understanding of law and government, so that the structure of below might reflect the structure of the heavens. Lastly, Maar gave the griffons souls. With a soul they could make their own decisions and feel and decide on what was right and wrong.\n\nHaving been granted these boons, the first griffons flew out from the Solarspike to found Griffonstone, before spreading all over the continent. Much of the early history of Griffonia is shrouded in myth, but records of places of worship around the Solarspike go back to the very earliest days of known history.\n\nTo this day, there exists a small place of worship at the foot of the mountain, where pilgrims can bring offerings. From there, to show your humility towards the gods, you can walk up the stairway leading up the mountain, foregoing the use of wings. Those wishing to climb to the summit will be met with disappointment, however, as the trail ends halfway to the top of the holy mountain. There, a small shrine marks the edge of the mundane world. It contains small stone figures of the Trinity, with a broken statuette laying down in shame outside the shrine. At the zenith of where a mortal is allowed to wander, in the quiet solace of the thin mountain air, the pilgrim can rest and contemplate on the journey. To go any higher would be to tread into the realm of the divine and blasphemy. All must eventually turn back and accept that for all their hard work, divinity is outside their reach."

Nevertheless, the impact of the cossacks on the city itself is clear, drawing many young griffons from the city off to fight against the ponies on the grand frontier, and many of the artisans of the city to focus their craft on supplying the steppe warriors.

It is a place where the nobility live in halls of great opulence, while thousands of their thrall servants live in abject poverty. \n\nRecords of a settlement at Hornavík's location range as far back as 180 ALB, but the city would only truly start to grow when the so-called golden age of Austurland began. Shortly after the countries establishment, Viking raids brought a great deal of wealth back to the city and solidified its status as the economic heart of Austurland. With the end of the golden age development slowed down somewhat, but despite this, the city kept expanding.\n\nThe city itself is divided into three districts, which roughly correspond with the steps of the Austurlandic social ladder. The outskirts house the commondeer, who still choke under the yoke of feudalism and perform much of the menial labor within the city. Traveling further one would reach the harbor district, which serves as the economic heart of Hornavík. Traditional Austurlandic architecture gives way to styles inspired by Griffenheim and Rijekograd, and merchant ships docking to unload their wares are a common occurrence. This is the home of the freedeer, who lack any obligations to feudal lords except the Jarl, and make up Austurland's small but growing middle class. \n\nThe harbor itself is said to be the site where deer first landed on Griffonia, and an occasional Viking longship still returns full of plunder and thralls, though these are mostly the last vestiges of a dying profession. The days of the Vikings are over, and only the nobility's desire for more thralls keeps the profession alive. \n\nThe harbor district also contains the few signs of industrialization within Austurland. Manufactories have slowly but surely started to replace artisanal craftsmanship, though the noble owners of the land in the city are notoriously reluctant to allow any new development. A notable landmark within the district is Sturla's temple, the largest temple in the country, which serves as the main center of worship for the cities inhabitants and is the tallest structure in the country. The temple itself is opulently decorated and was personally funded by Herjólfur Sturla, a noble who briefly came to dominate Austurland's political sphere around 700 ALB, before his death would usher in a brief but intense conflict between rival noble families.\n\nThe third and final section of the city is the noble district, which is, as the name implies, mostly composed of noble estates, along with the great hall of the Jarl. Imposing walls that date back to the founding of the city separate the noble district from the rest of the city and Huskarls stand ready to eject any unwanted visitors.

state_lore_text_container_state_description_369:0 "Ever since its foundation in the post-Arantigan era, Wrobert has been a bustling port city thanks to its location on the mouth of the great §CFolino river§!. Yet its true era of significance would not come until centuries later.\n\nSome years after the founding of §GNew Mareland§!, ponies began to migrate into the city from the west. They brought their higher literacy and prosperity with them, and thus became members of the middle and upper classes. Close trade ties were established with Equestria and the city began to grow rapidly. This accelerated exponentially when the ponies brought the §RIndustrial Revolution§! to Wrobert, making it the first city in all of southern Griffonia to industrialize. The city's famed port was greatly expanded, factories were built and griffons flooded in from the countryside. Soon, Wrobert became a city that rivaled Karthin itself.\n\nWhile Karthin is the traditional and political capital of Wingbardy, some would argue that Wrobert is the economic heart of the nation. Most of Wingbardy's imports and exports pass through the city, and it is home to important shipyards, business districts and industrial companies. The §YOld Town§! near the port is a small remnant of the past separated from the vast urban sprawl by ancient stone walls. Many famed historical landmarks can be found there, most notably the iconic §YLighthouse of Wrobert§!. It also has one of the oldest §Ybank buildings§! in Griffonia. After the declaration of independence in 972 ALB, the old architecture has been extensively renovated, much to the delight of Equestrian tourists.\n\nThe large proletarian population and close ties to Equestria proved to be fertile ground for §Rcommunist movements§!, so it is no surprise that Wrobert is the home of the §RPCW§!. The city's council has the highest portion of leftists out of any Wingbardian city, and there have even been socialist mayors in the past. Yet in recent years, the §LBlackwings§! have been gathering support in the city, spreading propaganda that is aimed at the wealthy ponies. The communists have responded with their own propaganda that is based on class rather than race.\n\nIncreasing tensions led to many ponies migrating away from the city, taking their assets and expertise with them. This has contributed to the economic downturn that Wrobert is suffering from at the moment of writing. This in turn has further radicalised the city's working populace, so clashes between communists and fascists have become a daily occurrence. Those caught in the middle pray that the government in Karthin will soon find a solution and manage to restore order in their beloved city."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_22:0 "The §YOld Frontier§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_22:0 "When Equestrians first began to settle in the sparsely populated lands of the buffalo in the 900s, they established §YFort Dodge§! to guard a vital trail to the §OMild West§!. Soon, a frontier settlement sprung up nearby as accomodations for travellers and adventurers were built. By the time a railway connected the settlement to the rest of Equestria, it had already grown into a prospering town known as §YDodge City§!. Thanks to its new railway junction, it soon also became known as §YDodge Junction§!. Both names are used to refer to the place, although Dodge City is the more common one.\n\nAn influx of settlers made the town grow at an exponential rate. Soon enough business boomed there: Countless saloons, rodeo arenas and parks were built, which attracted even more visitors and migrants. The unique culture of the Mild West is still the strongest here, and many ponies come visit just to experience it firsthoof.\n\nYet the primary economic activity is not tourism, but agriculture. Dodge City's most well known exports are yellow and red cherries grown at the sprawling §PCherry Hill Ranch§!, owned and managed by Cherry Jubilee. At the same time, when the cherry trees blossom in spring, it also attracts even more visitors, strengthening the tourism sector further.\n\nWhile Dodge City is still seen as a place that embodies the Mild West, many original settlers and frontiersponies have left the city, moving to greener pastures. The small frontier town has become just another bustling city dominated by business, and some would even call it a tourist trap. It is likely that those who left went searching for the true spirit of the Mild West that was lost in Dodge City."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_67:0 "The §YQueen§! of the §YNorth§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_67:0 "Trottingham, located on a small peninsula in the §YGriffish Isles§!, is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Equestria. When the three tribes first migrated south, some of the seafaring ponies decided to settle on uninhabited islands east of the lands which later became known as §CSeveryana§!. It is not known when exactly the city was founded, but the earliest records come from before Luna's Banishment.\n\nThe settlement quickly became an important center of trade when overseas routes to §OGriffonia§! were established, which gave the islands their name. This importance further increased when Celestia became the ruler of Severyana in 592 ALB, integrating the neighbouring region into Equestria. Trottingham's harbour was greatly expanded and thousands of migrants arrived from both Severyana and Griffonia, diversifying the population. During the §YIndustrial Revolution§!, textile manufactories were founded, lace became one of the primary exports and the town grew into a true city.\n\nThe inhabitants of the Griffish Isles still speak a dialect that derives from §YOld Ponish§!, which is one of the more distinct accents of Equestria. This means that ponies coming from the Griffish Isles can easily be recognized for their archaic way of speaking. The age of the venerable city can also be seen in its architecture, with its buildings having various styles from different periods and cultures. The most famous sights are the historical Lace Market, the Council House, the Great Harbour, the remains of the city's stone walls and the nearby Trottingham Castle. Many who visit the historical center of the city say that it almost feels like travelling back in time. However, this illusion fades away the further away you go, as the outskirts of the city are more recently constructed and far more modern.\n\nMore recently, the Trottingham's history has taken a darker turn. With the §RWinter Revolution§! in Severyana, one of the most important trade partners was lost, causing an economic downturn and making the city more reliant on aid from Canterlot. This in turn has led to unrest among the workers, partially thanks to communist agitation. In addition, the breakup of the §OGriffonian Empire§! caused an influx of griffon migrants and refugees, which have caused increased racial tensions. The city's future is now uncertain, but nopony doubts that the ancient city will continue to stand the test of time."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_136:0 "The §YCity§! of §YTwo Races§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_136:0 "Since its foundation, the city of Acornage has been defined by the relationship between ponies and changelings. Indeed, the first encounters between the two races occured near §YFort Acorn§!, the predecessor to the city itself that was founded by Equestrian settlers who colonized the uninhabited wilderness of northwestern Equestria. Different sources explain the nature of these outcomes differently. According to Equestrian historiography, it was cautious but ultimately friendly, as ponies presented gifts to the strange shapeshifting creatures. Traditionally, Changeling records did not mention gifts, but during the reign of §GQueen Chrysalis§! history has been reinterpreted and the encounters are seen as hostile and even violent.\n\nWhatever the case, the fort soon became a trading post, and then a town. It was the only place in Equestria where ponies could acquire finely woven §GChangeling silk§!, so commerce boomed and thousands of migrants arrived. Changelings arrived in the city as well, initially living in a separate quarter but soon integrating into the populace, often shapeshifting into ponies to fit in better. Acornage was - and still is - the one place in the world where one can see changeling hive spires next to traditional Equestrian houses.\n\nWhen the changelings were unified under one nation in 982 ALB, the border of the newborn country was drawn right next to the city. Equestrians agreed to Chrysalis' demands, thinking it would be the foundation of a friendly relationship between the two nations. They would later regret this when relations soured and the complete lack of a buffer zone made the city strategically vulnerable. Despite the rising tensions, business in the city continued as usual, with the local changelings and ponies remaining on friendly terms. This changed in §R1002 ALB§!, when Canterlot itself came under attack. The treacherous stab at the heart of Equestria shocked everypony, especially the inhabitants of Acornage. Overnight, the mood in the city changed, and many saw changelings as unreliable and a potential fifth column. Racial harmony was replaced with racial tensions, and thousands of fearful changelings fled the city across the border.\n\nAfter the initial harsh reactions, the situation calmed down as Chrysalis licked her wounds in Vesalipolis. There was an attempt at making amends, but most citizens felt like there was no going back. Yet, deep in their hearts, the inhabitants of Acorange know that their home city is proof that changelings and ponies can not only get along, but be true friends with one another."

state_lore_text_container_state_name_19:0 "The §YPride§! of the §YSouth§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_19:0 "Like many other settlements in the Equestrian south, Hoofington was founded as a small fort by pony settlers coming from the north. The fort was built on a river island that was easy to defend from §Ybuffalo raiders§! or §Rmonsters§!. This hoof-shaped island gave the settlement its name as it grew around the fort. Despite its location, it was nevertheless §Rdestroyed§! by a fearsome buffalo raid that used canoes to cross the river. A pony who led the defence and perished, §YFlanchard§!, became the mythical founding hero of Hoofington.\n\nAfter making peace with the natives, the determined settlers rebuilt Hoofington from the ground up as a modern planned city. Mining operations in the eastern §YMacintosh mountains§! and increased trade with the buffalo resulted in rapid growth of the town. Soon enough, money began pouring in from Canterlot and the §YCelestia Dam§! was built, creating the Hoofington reservoir. Investments into education also allowed the opening of many research facilities and schools. With the expanded knowledge base, a source of energy and a steady supply of raw materials, industrial facilities soon opened, and with them came a flood of workers from the north. Within years, Hoofington rivaled §YDodge City§! in size, despite being much younger.\n\nProspectors dug many tunnels around and beneath the city in search of ores. While they didn't find any, there are plans to use the tunnels for metro stations, as the rapidly growing city could greatly benefit from new methods of transportation. What the miners did find was a §glarge and ancient meteorite§! that had magical properties. It has been studied for many years now, and researchers hope that it could one day be used as a source of energy. In the meantime, a second hydroelectric dam was recently built, and it was named the §3Luna Dam§!, to honour the reformed Princess of the Night.\n\nWhile the §Y"Spirit of the Mild West"§! is almost nonexistent in Hoofington, it has nevertheless established itself as one of the greatest cities of the Equestrian south. It is a testament to the diligence of ponykind and a shining example of what ponies can accomplish in mere decades by working together."

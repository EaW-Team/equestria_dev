Situated where the Hayston River meets the Celestial Sea, the §YThree Boroughs§! — Manehattan and its satellites, §YHayston§! and §YBronclyn§! — make up this sprawling megalopolis on the §CEast Coast§! of Equestria.\n\nBeing Equestria's largest and most populous city, Manehattan is also the most diverse. As the premier seaport of the continent, centuries of continuous foreign immigration has meant that, alongside the ponies of the Three Tribes, there exist substantial communities of thestrals, hippogriffs, zebras, kirin, and griffons within the metropolis. Canterlot may be the seat of the Diarchy, but it is the melting-pot of Manehattanite society that truly embodies the Equestrian spirit — that of harmonious coexistence, strength in diversity, and friendship free of prejudice.\n\nThe glamour of Manehattan's nightlife and entertainment industry, and its unassailable status as an international locus of arts and culture, all belie the true roots of the city's wealth — its §Ymassive industrial base§!, located on the outskirts of the suburbs. If one should gaze to the west from the crown of the Mare Statue, over and beyond the elegant arches of the Bronclyn Bridge, they would glimpse the smokestacks and cranes that juxtapose a parallel skyline — one that is gritty and grimy, yet no less grand — against the opalescence of the skyscrapers downtown.\n\nThe §CCelestial Sea Fleet§! — the backbone of the §YEquestrian Royal Navy§! — has its moorings in the deep waters and sheltered bays of Manehattan Harbour. Where prodigious amounts of capital flow through the wharfs and dockyards of Bronclyn, from Griffonia, Zebrica, and §Ybeyond§!, the iron hoof of maritime law ensures that the waters around the metropolis are kept safe, from threats both monstrous and mundane.\n\nLike all big cities, Manehattan has its fair share of problems. Only a few blocks away from the glitzy shopping avenues of Bridleway are run-down waterfront neighbourhoods teeming with the city's immigrant proletariat, and in the shadow of Manehattan's skyscrapers lie the inner-city slums and ghettoes — the proverbial undergrowth of the concrete jungle. Should the centuries-long peace in Equestria collapse, there is no doubt that strife and scarcity will come to Manehattan; in the face of rationing, curfews, and blackouts, it is all too easy to forget about solidarity and friendship.\n\nNow, in the new millennium, the city is threatened from without and within. Across the sea, §RGriffonia§! is poised for a decade of brutal conflict, whilst Manehattan's own §CLunarists§! grow more belligerent by the day, as the horrors of mechanized warfare encroach on ponies' nightmares. In the years to come, what fate will befall this great city?\n[eaw_state_lore_75_addendum]"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_75_addendum:0 "\n£line_break\n\nFollowing the defeat of the Principality of Equestria in the §RGreat War§!, the East Coast fell under the control of the victorious Changeling Hegemony. In the year §Y[?MAN.MAN_WS_GetFormDate]§!, §GQueen Chrysalis§! would subsequently devolve the governance of the East Coast to a military Protectorate centered around Manehattan.\n\nUpon the arrival of the §CProtectress Lilac§! in the city, the §GChangeling Administration§! commandeered the Crystaller Building — the tallest skyscraper in all of Equestria — as the headquarters for the new regime, whilst the Garrison's Schutzbataillons occupied the barracks and military bases vacated by the disbanded Equestrian army.\n"

Walking down the storied streets and avenues that make up the pristine city, you can spot the small tell-tale signs of the §RChangeling attack on Canterlot§! that happened in 1002. And yet, looking at the vibrant life in the city; the cafés, the restaurants, the theaters, the parties, the soirees, you wouldn't be able to tell. Canterlot, as with the rest of Equestria, has moved on, content in their idea that the changelings were a bad event but one that will never repeat itself. Least of all anyone expects is for §RQueen Chrysalis§! to come back. But whatever the history, Canterlot is, and has been in step with the rest of the country. As Equestria grew under those first years under Luna and Celestia, so did Canterlot. When Equestria industrialized and grew past the years of medieval castles and nobles, Canterlot did too, when Luna was welcomed into the fold, it happened in Canterlot. Be it during the battle against Nightmare Moon, the battle against the Changelings, or indeed, as it has been for most of its history, the vibrant capital of Equestria, the home of ponies and Harmony, watched over by Princess Celestia's gaze, Canterlot has always been a snapshot of Equestria and its condition.\n\nBut indeed, if you took up the railroad to Canterlot, arriving at the palace, you will find the curriculum at the School for Gifted Unicorns the same as it has always been, and at galas at the Canterlot Palace they stick to routines from decades ago. While it may serve Equestria well now, they are outdated for the era, and are overdue for an overhaul. However, if a storm should hit, it would be a woeful one indeed.\n\nTime will tell what will happen to Canterlot as a new era dawns on the world. An era of opportunity, and an era of risk."

Walking down the storied streets and avenues that make up the pristine unicorn city, the battle scars of the §YGreat War§! — and the subsequent defeat of Equestria that would allow the unicorn race to reclaim their rightful hold on the city, in cooperation with their newfound changeling allies — have all but healed. Looking at the vibrant life in the city; the cafés, the restaurants, the theaters, the parties, the soirees, you wouldn't be able to tell that anything was ever amiss. Canterlot, as with the rest of Equestria, has moved into a new golden era under the Pax Chrysalia. The §CGreat Queen Chrysalis§! has avenged her defeat in 1002, and with her return to the city, new opportunities for the unicorns of Equestria have dawned on the nation. Now more than ever, Canterlot is, and always will be, a §Gshining beacon§! for §Cchangeling-unicorn cooperation§! for the rest of the country.\n\nYet the scars of the past are not so easily healed, and must be remembered. As Equestria grew under those first years under Luna and Celestia, so did Canterlot, and with them, the prominence of unicorns in the Equestrian system. When Equestria industrialized and grew past the years of medieval castles and nobles, Canterlot did too, and the unicorns adapted to a new world of politicians and bureaucrats, finding new ways to cement their natural primacy over the lesser races. When Luna was welcomed into the fold, it happened in Canterlot, and the unicorns were the first to welcome their long-lost diarch back into the nation, §Reven as the pegasi and earth ponies rejected her§!. Be it during the battle against Nightmare Moon, the battle against the Changelings, or indeed, as it has been for most of its history, the vibrant capital of Equestria, the home of ponies and Harmony, watched over by Princess Celestia's gaze and a unicorn's guiding hoof, Canterlot has always been a snapshot of Equestria and its condition.\n\nBut indeed, if you took up the railroad to Canterlot, arriving at the palace, you will find the curriculum at the School for Gifted Unicorns revitalized like it never has been before, and the galas at the Canterlot Palace have been overhauled to tailor to unicorns and their changeling friends, with the lesser races excluded from attendance. Finally, after so long, the history of Equestria now reveals the truth of unicorn primacy, and does away with the insidious lie that all equine races were created equal. The unicorns of Equestria have weathered the storm of oppression and forced equality for centuries, and now, it is time to step into the light and assume our rightful place in the sun.\n\nOnly time will tell what will happen to Canterlot, at the dawn of the era of the Pax Chrysalia — an era of industrial opportunity, interracial harmony, and mutual prosperity.\n"

It was once known as the workshop of the world, producing goods for export across the planet, and is famed for its medical school located beneath the pegasus district of Bells Air (commonly known as "Little Cloudsdale"). Other notable features of the city are its all-unicorn police force and §RDragon Town§!, a district inhabited exclusively by dragons, as well as the yearly Grapefruit Festival. In recent times the city was struggling with a severe §Cparasprite§! infestation, which took years to clear out.\n\nThe city has a long and rich history, being founded before Luna's Banishment over a thousand years ago, when the Princesses were still young. Indeed, the nickname of the city refers to the mutual love the sisters had for each other, which unfortunately meant that after the Banishment Celestia did everything she could to avoid the city. Despite Canterlot's neglect, Fillydelphia thrived nevertheless. After Luna's return and reformation a grand celebration was held in the city in honour of the Princesses' reconciliation, and the ponies of the city happily welcomed Celestia who could once more visit them without issue.\n\n\n\n"

She learned that a wizard named §YComet Tail the Starry-Eyed§! had cast a spell to protect the many books of the city from harm, but because he did the ritual at the wrong time, it ended up hiding the city entirely from outsiders. She cast the spell at the right time, breaking the curse and revealing the city. The ponies living in it, who had become reclusive over the years, were overjoyed when visitors flooded Bales.\n\nAt the present Bales is a center of learning, trade and book printing, producing ever more tomes not only for its own libraries, but for all the libraries of Equestria.

The first apple orchards were planted, but while the trees grew, the ponies discovered magical §CZap Apples§! inside the Everfree Forest. The jam prepared from these apples became famous, attracting many migrants. Stinkin' Rich, the grandfather of the entrepreneur Filthy Rich, opened a market selling the jam, which soon grew into a burgeoining business. The Apple and Rich families still live in the town to this day and are honoured as its founders.\n\nIn the years since, many ponies have moved to Ponyville, making it a very diverse town. All three races are present and live together in harmony. It is for this reason why Princess Celestia sent her young pupil, §YTwilight Sparkle§!, to live in the town and make some friends. She and the ponies she met soon became close friends and the wielders of the §YElements of Harmony§!, who have saved Equestria from countless threats. After her ascension to Alicornhood and her defeat of §RLord Tirek§!, Twilight Sparkle now lives in the §CCastle of Friendship§! north of the town.

It became a center of shipping and manufacturing with thriving docks.\n\nHowever, the workers have been treated worse than in many other Equestrian cities, especially during the reign of the last Mayor. Because of this Baltimare became the center of the Equestrian labour movement, housing the headquarters of the CAN-TER anarcho-syndicalist federation of trade unions and anarchists. A large protest had been held in the city during the Winter Revolution in Stalliongrad, and the Mayor of the city had been sacked by Celestia herself.\n\nDue to being located in the South-East, the city also houses a considerable minority of thestrals, whose conditions are even worse than that of the workers, but who are not allowed to join unions.

It's filled with luxurious hotels, casinos, arcades, amusement parks and restaurants that brought the city much fame. Despite it being a floating cloud-city, even earth ponies and unicorns can walk on it thanks to more modern magical engineering, with long platforms of metal and concrete functioning as walkable streets. The service-orientated economy is thriving, and though there is a lack of farmland to sustain the city, food has always been imported from elsewhere in Equestria. There's something for everyone here, from newborns and young partiers to elders looking for something new and exciting.\n\nUnder this shining cloud-city however is the second half of Las Pegasus. Here, large companies such as Horseco and Rockville Oil dominate, their factories cluttering the cityscape. Gigantic steel foundries churn out endless tonnes of stainless steel, which is used by the huge shipyards in the construction of new luxury cruise ships and military vessels. Surrounding this industrial heart are the apartments of the common workers, who toil in service of large companies. It is fertile ground for leftist movements, some more radical than others, and the ponies of the cloud-city above demand the police to ensure that Stalliongradian influence does not spread. So far, they have only been moderately successful, but as long as Equestria remains stable the proletariat are unlikely to cause trouble.\n"

It is the terminus of the transcontinental Equestrian railway and its port is among the largest in the country. Its primary trade good is lumber, imported from Vaverfront across the Luna Bay, but in recent years the service sector has continued to grow. Many movies are filmed here, earning it the nickname "Applewood North", and numerous tourists come there from the south to enjoy the cold weather.\n\nA large portion of the populace consists of Olenian deer, who work on the docks or sell their wares at the markets. There are even some changelings living in the city, though they are viewed with suspicion by the rest of the inhabitants.

The town has a saloon known as the Salt Block, a clock tower and a stage for musical performances. It is known for its horse-drawn horse-drawn carriages and local mild west dances.\n\nIn 1001 ALB, Appleloosa was at the epicenter of the short but violent conflict known as the §RApple War§!. It erupted after nearby buffalo tribes demanded the ponies to tear down their orchards, for they had been planted on their traditional stampeding grounds. The ponies refused to destroy their livelihoods and the buffalo attacked. Compromise was only reached when Chief Thunderhooves was downed by an apple pie, which he found to be delicious. Soon a historic agreement was signed: The ponies get to keep their orchards, as long as they gift apple pies to the buffalo.

state_lore_text_container_state_name_short_30:0 "Ayacachtli"
state_lore_text_container_state_name_30:0 "The §YCity§! of the §YMoon§!:"
state_lore_text_container_state_description_30:0 "There is a charm in the city of Ayacachtli that begets wonderous thoughts in anypony; here is a city, that was ancient before Equestria had even been formed. Located in the southern jungles, in the mountains on the border of Badlands, Ayacachtli has the dubious honour of being the oldest thestral city in the world. Legends hold it, that it was constructed by a thestral Moonspeaker with the aid of an Ursa Major. Historians, however, place its origins to many millennia ago, to the times when thestral tribes and the Neighua came into conflict and a need for a safe haven was born. Whatever it may have been, thestrals have been living in the city for so long, that only bare estimates can be given with current historical records.\n\nQuite an unusual aspect about Ayacachtli is the fact it is located inside the mountain range, inside a cast cavern dug over time by its denizens. Even as times have advanced, majority of the city is still located safely there, with just part of the more modern city located outside. Where, along with them, plenty of terraces for farming are located to feed the mountain city. But it is not food that Ayacachtli is known for; for the mountains contain many riches such as copper, silver and gold. Historians have traced many ancient trade routes leading to Ayacachtli from the north, carrying goods such as iron weapons and armour in exchange for the mined minerals. Evidence shows that Ayacachtli served as a vital link for trade between the jungles and north, through which luxury goods such as sugar and cocoa from jungle tribes passed by. Once the princesses proceeded with their formation of Equestria, Ayacachtli found itself in a favourable position - at least until the incident with Nightmare Moon occured. Now shunned, the thesrals returned to living amongs themselves, in fear of reprisals and revenge for siding with the horrid monster that had once been their beloved princess. This especially hurt Ayacachtli and the city endured for centuries as but a hollow shell of a once mighty realm.\n\nToday, Ayacachtli stands as a testament for vigority of thestralkind as a near total majority of its denizens are made up of thestrals. Even the ponies there are usually tribals from the jungles, who have interacted with the thestrals far longer than any northener has and even tend to share a common tongue with. Modernization is present in the city but mixed in to tradition and the peculiar aspects of thestrals; Ayacachtli has no real streets, as near-every denizen can fly. This has led to the city developing not horitzontally as a traditional city but primarily vertically. Tall towers, reaching from the cavern's ceiling to the floor, dot the vast cave, with the odd bridge crossing the gaps between them. Even with modern electricity, most of Ayacachtli is cast in but dim light, to better suit the sensitive eyes of thestrals. Further caverns extend out from the main one, which lead to the many mining tunnels; Ayacachtli even to this day is mostly dependant upon its ore exports to many Equestrian industries north; one could perhaps find some irony in how some things never change.\n\nCentral part of the city and an aspect that cannot be missed is the Temple of Moon, located at the city's center and remains a staunchly visited complex by the thestrals. It is the place where every Moonspeaker comes to learn the traditional ways and read the ancient texts stored within there.

But what a visitor can see is already extraordinary, and a sight to rival even that of Canterlot. For right past its entrance, visitors are met with a giant dome covering the main hall. On this dome there is a vividly well-detailed star map, one born from countless generations of work from the Moonspeakers. Every possible inch of the carved stone accurately details the wonders of the night sky to the point that astronomers from Princess Luna's Academy of Stars have praised the meticulous work the priests have done, even rivalling achievements historical astronomers such as Galloping Galley and Leap Ordinance. There have been calls to preserve the temple complex for sake of history but for thestrals, however, the temple still serves its original purpose, as it did since its inception; to venerate the Moon, as their forebears did before them.

Many exquisite goods come out of the city, be them diamonds, cars or fashionable Griffonian clothes, and while Equestria still maintains the lead on modern manufacturing globally, Skyfall is home of the most technically advanced factories and craftgriffs in all of Griffonia. The currently most famous one is the Kessler automobile plant which produces some of the most widely used cars in Griffonia.\n\nSkyfall is known as a city but it is actually a metropolitan community of nineteen smaller towns, each ruled by a mayor and their own local councils. This is merely a near-folkloric archaism as these "towns" have no recognizable borders and some streets can belong to several towns. Even distinguishing them between on the basis of wealth, activities or style is impossible as Skyfall is so chaotically organized that one may leave a street of insalubrious houses only to find mansions just around the corner. Lack of uniformity and charming chaos are indeed the defining features of the city, making it a divisive place to visit. To some, it is an endless wonder to stroll in while an ignominious mess to the more orderly-minded.\n\nSkyfall is home to many landmarks, both old and new. At its historical center sits the Grote Markt, the historical market of the city which was home to the most prestigious guild halls of the city decorated with golden gables, balustrades and statues. Not far of the Grote Markt stands the Skyfall Stock Exchange built in the style of a religious temple and which is the busiest stock exchange in the continent. North of the city, you can find the great Groverian Park, Skyfall's largest park area where the three great temples dedicated to Eyr, Arcturius and Boreas have been built. The great harbour is also known for some of its old market places and warehouses as well as hosting the former Imperial Navy which has been seized and nationalized during Guichard's secession. A hill on the southern part of the city is home to a gigantic palace of justice designed by Joseph Poulaert, a Fezeran-born architect who had sought to create a monument showcasing the might of the law and the Griffonian judiciary. Originally planned under Grover IV's reign, it was finished by Ghislain Guichard's government as a tribute to the Trade Federation dedication to the rule of law though not without the help of some corner-cutting.\n\nSkyfall's population is one of the most diverse on the continent if not the world. Virtually every sentient species is represented in some way despite Griffons forming a plurality of the population. Skyfallians are known to be educated, festive and gregarious if perhaps a bit unsophisticated and plagued with a bizarre accent. They are also known to both rageously enjoy criticizing their city and fiercely call out any foreigners who would dare try to do it themselves. The typical Skyfallian is fatter than the average and usually enjoys more than a little beer or strong liquors as well fried food. It is also known that Skyfallian are very prone to organize themselves in groups and the city is teeming with corporations, old guilds, more recent labour movements, cooperatives and organized crime.

This curse of mediocrity has always haunted it.\n\nFounded by §YFeathisian merchants§! many centuries before the rise of the §OGriffonian Empire§!, its inhabitants quickly took advantage of the settlement's excellent natural harbour to conduct overseas trade with Equestria, which is exactly what Skyfall's traders did as well. The competition between the two was fierce. There were short periods when Griffton secured lucrative trade deals and dominated the market, but Skyfall always found a way to recover. Eventually, the city could simply not keep up. By the time §YEmperor Grover I§! arrived on the shores of the west, Griffton was going bankrupt.\n\nGriffton was made into a §YImperial Free City§!, and the new privileges saved it from certain economic doom. Yet it was clear that competition with Skyfall was doomed to fail, so the city's merchants began to establish closer ties with their sister city instead. This helped bring prosperity to Griffton, but Skyfall's influence increased at an alarming rate. More and more companies and manufactories were bought out by Skyfallian merchants as the years went by. Even §YRadio Griffton§!, the first broadcasting company on all of Griffonia, was soon in foreign ownership. In the eve of the §RRepublican Revolution§!, it was clear to everyone that Griffton had become Skyfall's puppet.\n\nIn the chaos that followed, it was therefore inevitable that Griffton would join the newly formed §YSkyfall Trade Federation§!. Its privileges were revoked, and under the rule of the §LIron Chancellor§!, its autonomy was largely erased. The current mayor of the city does whatever the Skyfallian officials tell her to do, as long as they pay her enough bribes. It is therefore no surprise that modern Griffton is nothing more than an extension of Skyfall itself."

The western borough of the city has a notorious slum, a small sea of wooden shacks infested with rats, while the city proper has gorgeous architecture, masterfully mixing Aquileian and Herzlander styles.

Indeed, the capital of §CAquileia§! is one of the shining beacons of the arts and science in Griffonia and while many cities rest upon the past, Aquila remains forward looking. The beginning of the eleventh century saw the city undergo one of the greatest urbanistic experiments in the history of the continent. As this text is being written, workers are tearing down the old squalid neighborhoods and preparing to build a city design with modernity and reason in mind.\n\nShould one decide to take a walk in the city, they will find many great landmarks and a preview of the city to come: grand avenues decorated to please the eye of the strollers, an innovative subway, modern and delightful rows of apartment buildings, private palaces and hotels and luxurious shops. They will be able to find the great Trinity Hill - finally free of squalor - on top of which lies the three great white temples dedicated to Eyr, Boreas and Arcturius. It is there that the kings of Aquileia have traditionally been crowned as shown by the royal banners and tapestries of the ruling king. The Promenade des Ducs is also a major attraction on the banks of the great Belle river. This fancy avenue is home to many museums, libraries, theaters and private salons where the literate, wealthy or artistic elites meet and mingle. On the western edge of the cities lies the Vieux Fort, an old citadel whose black walls barely survived the sacking of the city by §RGrover II§!, and is now home to the university of the city. In the eastern part of the cities, they will find the Domaine Royal with its great parks and palaces home to the Discret dynasty and the royal government. For those with a taste for the stranger things, many parts of the city hosts a peculiar undercity called the Catacombs which acted for centuries as the city's boneyard. It is said that in the ancient times, it was a holy site dedicated to the banished god Maar.\n\nThe story of Aquila is a unique one for it is one of the few great Griffonian cities that did not owe anything to the old Kingdom of Sparléos. Instead, it was the bastion of freedom for many confederated tribes that would form the realm of Aquileia a century before our era. After becoming the capital of the kingdom, the city became a thriving trading and crafting center, one of the economic hearts of the kingdom. This long era of prosperity saw its decline in the eighth century when Aquileia was subjugated by the §YGriffonian Empire§! and finally ended in 785 when the kingdom and much of its capital was burned down by Grover II's armies. To add insult to injury, the princess Giselda Discret was forced to marry the angry emperor in the ruined temple of Arcturius on Trinity Hill. This saddest of weddings is still commemorated today and princess Giselda hailed as a martyr of the city. After this, the city slowly recovered but it is only after independence in 972 that the city finally saw a return to greatness. Much investment was made into the city by the Republicans between 980 and 985 and finally during the Discret restoration which saw the beginning of the great transformation of the city."

Their houses and villas were often opulent and decorated by famous artists.\n\nHowever, for all the splendour many were not lucky to live this lifestyle.

The first griffons were given shape by Eyr, giving them their body; wings to reach towards the heavens and beaks to praise the divine. Arcturius gave the griffons their strength; the strength to overcome all evils they might encounter, the strength to build mighty structures and tools and to overcome personal hardships. Boreas gave them intelligence, an understanding of themselves and of truth and rationality. An understanding of law and government, so that the structure of below might reflect the structure of the heavens. Lastly, Maar gave the griffons souls. With a soul they could make their own decisions and feel and decide on what was right and wrong.\n\nHaving been granted these boons, the first griffons flew out from the Solarspike to found Griffonstone, before spreading all over the continent. Much of the early history of Griffonia is shrouded in myth, but records of places of worship around the Solarspike go back to the very earliest days of known history.\n\nTo this day, there exists a small place of worship at the foot of the mountain, where pilgrims can bring offerings. From there, to show your humility towards the gods, you can walk up the stairway leading up the mountain, foregoing the use of wings. Those wishing to climb to the summit will be met with disappointment, however, as the trail ends halfway to the top of the holy mountain. There, a small shrine marks the edge of the mundane world. It contains small stone figures of the Trinity, with a broken statuette laying down in shame outside the shrine. At the zenith of where a mortal is allowed to wander, in the quiet solace of the thin mountain air, the pilgrim can rest and contemplate on the journey. To go any higher would be to tread into the realm of the divine and blasphemy. All must eventually turn back and accept that for all their hard work, divinity is outside their reach."

To the §YGriffonian Empire§! in the West, Hellquill is the valiant bulwark of the griffons, home to those knights who have sworn themselves to protect their brethren against the pony threats. To those in the §GRiverlands§!, be them Diamond Dogs or Ponies, Hellquill is a city of butchers and raiders sitting on stolen grounds and built with stolen wealth.\n\nIts story began with the great eastwards expansion of Grover II. The great emperor conquered what came to be known as the Griffonian Frontier and tasked the §YOrder of Brothers of the Griffon House of Prelate Aloysious in Cloudbury§! with guarding it. When the emperor died against a simple Nimbusian soldier and his successor cared little for his father's crusade, the knights of Hellquill settled down and began to build a series of military cities, towns and villages surrounding impressive castles and fortresses, Hellquill being the mightiest of them all.\n\nThe greatest landmark of the city is the Order's castle which stands on a hill overlooking the city and dominates the banks of the Griffking River. East of the castle stands the river port to which trade flows and where the Order surveils any trader attempting the journey between the Empire and the Riverlands. West of the castle is the pony ghetto. The walled neighbourhood is known for its poverty and squalor, caused by decades of discrimination and lack of investment from the Order. The city of Hellquill in itself stands north of the riverside districts. Its streets are one of the finest display of early groverian architecture and has seemed to maintain an atmosphere of tradition despite the march of industry. The only concession to modernity is the asphalt on the major streets, allowing for easy movement of troops and military vehicles and allowing easy access to the three great temples dedicated to Boreas, Eyr and Arcturius as well as Hellquill's Imperial Railway station which remains to this day an unfinished mess, unconnected to the Empire. The city is governed in a strange fashion with the knights delegating municipal powers to the guilds of crafters and merchants and the local prelates."

However, in 539 an ambitious warrior named Gobdan overthrew Drogus and declared himself §YPrince of Kivessin§!. Thus, the third principality of Prywhen was born.\n\nThanks to its location in the middle of the §YEvi Valley§!, in the confluence of rivers, Kivessin quickly grew into a city. It was sacked several times by Zaphzan griffons, but after §YEmperor Grover I's§! conquests in 705 peace and order were maintained on the frontier.

Other places of interest are the §YGrand Temple of Eviliana§!, the primary center of worship for the eastern river-goddess, the old §YMarket Square§! with its medieval architecture, and the Chapterhouses of the local knightly orders.\n\nBefore the §RPrywhen Civil War§!, the outskirts of the city had been demolished and rebuilt anew, with modern apartment buildings and factories rising high above the low buildings of the historic center. This clash between old and new is still one of the most striking features of the city, even though the communists now threaten it.\n\nThere is widespread concern that many historical landmarks will be torn down if the PLA manages to secure the city due to their association with monarchy, religion and the mercantile class. During the civil war, the city has been extensively fortified, with barricades on the streets, and its once thriving market square is now empty. With the recent PLA offensives most of the inhabitants have fled, turning Kivessin into a ghost town. The fate of the city depends entirely on the outcome of the ongoing civil war."

To this day, Sydia functions as the second capital of the realm.\n\nIts location near the mouth of the river and its natural harbour have always been the keys to its success as a city. Tonnes of grain, rice, timber, honey and other products from all of Evi Valley are brought here and exported to distant lands. Numerous fishergriffs depart the docks every day and bring countless fish for sale at the city's famed Seaside Market. The ornate headquarters of the Gryphussian trade company §YGryps-Süd GmbH§! is located nearby, as is the old Princely Palace which functions as the summer residence of the King.\n\nSydia is a maritime city, as shown by the countless sailing ships and steam boats in its harbour and the constant squarking of seagulls. Indeed, legend says the last Princess of Sydia was a sailor herself, and sailed off into the sunrise to discover distant lands, only to never return. The Prince of Brodfeld then inherited the vacant throne.\n\nWhile the population of Prywhen is largely homogenous, Sydia is an exception. Here one may find Gryphussians, Wingbardians, Cyanolisians, Sicameonese and even members of other races such as Asterionese minotaurs, Macawian harpies and Colthaginian zebras. When walking in the alleys in the warm evening, one may hear a dozen languages spoken as customers haggle for better prices.\n\nWhile Sydia has so far largely avoided the devastation of the §RPrywhen Civil War§!, its effects can still be seen on the streets. The citizens are anxious, the factory workers prone to protest, the city guard are on high alert. Executions of suspected communists occur daily and the price of goods on the market has skyrocketed as traffic in the port has reduced greatly.

Formerly a notable settlement, Kaiv grew into the most prosperous city in the nation after assuming the role of its capital.\n\nKaiv's prosperity under the kingdom continued for a while, but the §Gcossacks§! of the plains caused instability, resisting any centralization attempts by the monarchy. In 579, the Kingdom finally fell apart and the cossacks seized control of the nation. After swearing oaths of fealty to §YEmperor Grover I§! in 749, the nation became known as the §GGryphian Host§!.\n\nThese cossacks are perhaps the thing Kaiv is most known for- despite the fact that they largely operate outside of the city. Nevertheless, the impact of the cossacks on the city itself is clear, drawing many young griffons from the city off to fight against the ponies on the grand frontier, and many of the artisans of the city to focus their craft on supplying the steppe warriors. Kaiv is also the city in which the §YRada§! is held, an assembly in which the next Hetman is chosen.\n\nWhen looking past the rich history of the city, however, you will find nothing but a city out of time. Held back by their §Rbellicose society§! and largely §Gagricultural economy§!, Kaiv struggles to find its footing as the cities of the western griffons and of the eastern ponies stride into the industrial era. The griffons who inhabit the city are slow to let go of their traditions, least of all the §Goft-romanticised cossacks§!, and the streets of Kaiv are filled not with workers of industry and foreign business, but with farmer's markets and local craftgriffs, blacksmiths and tailors.

Of course, one of the theatre companies that inhabits the theatre is known to be notorious tricksters, much to the irritation of the resident orchestra and scenographers in the theatre.

And after tens, if not hundreds, of kilometres they end in smaller holds of their own. A great time ago these holds were connected by an §6outside wall§!, one that lays mostly ruined these days.

Much of it remains §gwastes§!, only sometimes interrupted with farmer settlements for the whelps that take care of tubers and roots, and holds and holdings of clanless bears. Even rarer still are statues and shrines to §DAll-Father§!, many of them enduring even as holds or settlements they were part of turned into ash and dust.\n\nSo great is this vastness is that there are lands which were never marched upon by ursine armies. While usually such lands are merely more ice and snow and taiga, there are rumours of §1great abominable beasts§! and §1singular creatures§!, older than the current bear civilization that dwell within.\n\nYet after §YPaw Wellington§! returned from his exile this great vastness is being transformed. For slowly more and more holds are raised and built by bears attracted to the lands by the great experiment of §Yursine unity§!. And the first city of ursines is expanding. While it's merely a dream now, some claim, that perhaps in merely a few generations, the largest of all cities will rise from the fortified skeleton of §YClan Scyfling§!'s capital hold."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_412:0 "Hornavík is a city at odds with itself, and is in many ways a microcosm of Austurlandic society as a whole. It is a place of surprising modernity and immense poverty. It is a place where the nobility live in halls of great opulence, while thousands of their thrall servants live in abject poverty. \n\nRecords of a settlement at Hornavík's location range as far back as 180 ALB, but the city would only truly start to grow when the so-called golden age of Austurland began. Shortly after the countries establishment, Viking raids brought a great deal of wealth back to the city and solidified its status as the economic heart of Austurland. With the end of the golden age development slowed down somewhat, but despite this, the city kept expanding.\n\nThe city itself is divided into three districts, which roughly correspond with the steps of the Austurlandic social ladder. The outskirts house the commondeer, who still choke under the yoke of feudalism and perform much of the menial labor within the city. Traveling further one would reach the harbor district, which serves as the economic heart of Hornavík. Traditional Austurlandic architecture gives way to styles inspired by Griffenheim and Rijekograd, and merchant ships docking to unload their wares are a common occurrence. This is the home of the freedeer, who lack any obligations to feudal lords except the Jarl, and make up Austurland's small but growing middle class. \n\nThe harbor itself is said to be the site where deer first landed on Griffonia, and an occasional Viking longship still returns full of plunder and thralls, though these are mostly the last vestiges of a dying profession. The days of the Vikings are over, and only the nobility's desire for more thralls keeps the profession alive. \n\nThe harbor district also contains the few signs of industrialization within Austurland. Manufactories have slowly but surely started to replace artisanal craftsmanship, though the noble owners of the land in the city are notoriously reluctant to allow any new development. A notable landmark within the district is Sturla's temple, the largest temple in the country, which serves as the main center of worship for the cities inhabitants and is the tallest structure in the country. The temple itself is opulently decorated and was personally funded by Herjólfur Sturla, a noble who briefly came to dominate Austurland's political sphere around 700 ALB, before his death would usher in a brief but intense conflict between rival noble families.\n\nThe third and final section of the city is the noble district, which is, as the name implies, mostly composed of noble estates, along with the great hall of the Jarl. Imposing walls that date back to the founding of the city separate the noble district from the rest of the city and Huskarls stand ready to eject any unwanted visitors. The nobility of Austurland rule with little care for anything besides maintaining their bases of power and a significant amount of the city is underdeveloped due to their indifference on developing it."

However, in 905, §Ran invasion§! by Austurland razed and looted the city, leaving it as a broken husk with its ancient buildings left as nothing but rubble.\n\nModern day Seguro is an odd combination of old and modern ways born from its past; while the ancient walls still ceremonially mark the inner and outer city, in reality the city has far extended outwards from its original confinements.

Nearby to this park rises many estates held by the rich, build in the 910s during the reconstruction of the capital with aid of a Macawian architect; these buildings combine elements of the old Wittenlandic buildings with the more luxurious style from Macawia.

It was in the mountains surrounding the hidden city that the religion known as §CThe Way of Fire§! is said to have had its genesis, where the monks and mystics came down from the mountains to share everything they learned from communing with the divine fire being, §GConcord§!, with the local population. In time, as The Way of Fire spread throughout the §YRealm of Kiria§!, the city only grew in importance and size. Due to its spiritual and political importance as the birthplace of the Way of Fire and the seat of the Vermilion Dynasty, Vermilion became the largest city in the realm, complete with a sprawling palace complex, a bureaucratic and diplomatic quarter, and magnificent gardens, though this was not to last.\n\nAs Kiria entered a period of tumultuous change brought about by the advent of industrialization and capitalism, the teachings of The Way of Fire could no longer calm the excesses of a populace drunk on the heady prospects of modernisation. In 902, a merchants' protest against a decree by §YMatriarch Superior Noctilucent Charm§! restricting the establishment of monoculture tea plantations in the Vermilion Basin was confronted by a mob of commoners, enraged that the merchants would question the wisdom and authority of their Matriarch. Nokirin is sure who changed first, but in the midst of the brawling, somekirin turned into a §Rnirik§!, and the chaos spread like wildfire. By the end of the day, four-fifths of Vermilion had been burnt to the ground, with the last flames finally extinguished only a week later. The inferno claimed hundreds of lives, injuring tens of thousands, and most of Vermilion's population was left homeless. It was the scars left upon Noctilucent Charm's psyche by this tragedy that would directly lead to her series of radical decrees and proclamations that established §RThe Silence§!.\n\nVermilion was slowly rebuilt over the following century, and still serves as the seat of the Vermilion Dynasty, though The Silence has robbed it of all its authority. Yet here, more than anywhere else in the realm, The Way of Fire is still strong, and the Matriarch's authority still holds absolute sway over the kirin that live here. Following the determined efforts of an Equestrian diplomatic mission to make contact with §YMatriarch Superior Rain Shine§! in 1006 ALB, The Silence was lifted locally around the city.

Fragrance once handled the bulk of the realm's trade between the deer of the north and the parrots of §YMacawia§!, with some traders reaching as far as §YSouthern Griffonia§! during the city's most prosperous years. As such, it was always the first to receive new ideas and put them into action, helping to further culturally separate the city from the rest of the kirin heartlands, as species from all across the globe settled into the city to open businesses and ply their trade. It was also in the city of Fragrance that the §Ymodernization of Kiria§! began, with the advent of capitalism and the establishment of an ever-growing kirin bourgeoisie only further radicalizing the changes happening within the city. There was some pushback from local leaders who feared that modernization of the country would come between the common kirin and the divine authority of their §YMatriarch§!, but these voices were unable to stop the changes happening to the city. Within years, Fragrance had grown into the richest city in Kiria, and it seemed like it would only grow richer with time.\n\n§RThe Silence§! put a swift and brutal end to that. When the decrees from the capital outlawed money, property, and hierarchical organization, the economy of Fragrance collapsed overnight. The trade routes the city needed to thrive simply disappeared, and the workers that toiled in the factories returned to the countryside to farm. Though bourgeoisie and merchants from throughout the realm fled to Fragrance in a hope to salvage their businesses and way of life, the damage had already been done. Fragrance, a city built around trade and business, suddenly lost its purpose.\n\nIn time, Fragrance would turn to less morally responsible activities to sustain itself and its populace. §RPirates§!, §Rsmugglers§!, and §Ymercenaries§! sought to keep the city alive and its citizens fed by finding some way of bringing money into the city.

When she rested at the site for the night, she fell in love with its beauty and splendor, and felt that this land had, more than almost anywhere else in Kiria, been blessed by Concord herself. Before she departed to continue her ascent to the mountaintops, the Priestess decreed the spot where she rested a suitably auspicious site to build a city dedicated to the reverence of Concord, and began to directly organize the settlement of the region when she returned to Vermilion. A small cadre of Vermilion Priests led ten thousand followers over the mountains and hills between the capital and the decreed spot, choosing the name of §CRhapsody§! upon breaking ground for the first building, in celebration of the many hymns praising Concord the expedition sang on their journey. In time, Rhapsody would grow to become an impressive metropolis devoted to the study and worship of Concord's teachings, growing to rival both §YVermilion§! and §YFragrance§! in spite of — or perhaps, owing to — its relative isolation from either.\n\nIt was this isolation that has allowed Rhapsody to flourish despite the imposition of §RThe Silence§!. In 779 ALB, a rebellious sectlet of Vermilion Priests relocated to the city after expressing their dissatisfaction with the reigning Matriarch's policies and supposedly hedonistic lifestyle. Over the following decades, this branch of the theocracy worked to distance Rhapsody from what they saw as the crumbling divine authority of the Vermilion Dynasty in Vermilion, though they never went so far as to outright say so. The kirin of Rhapsody soon came to believe that they knew the Way of Fire better than the scholars and mystics in the capital, and as such, they had a truer interpretation of Concord's teachings than even the Matriarch. Though this caused §Ofriction§! between Vermilion and Rhapsody, nothing came of it until §RThe Silence§! was decreed in 902 ALB. While the rest of the nation slowly began to crumble, decay, and decentralize as a result of §YMatriarch Superior Noctilucent Charm's§! decrees, Rhapsody resisted them, believing that the Matriarch had wrongly interpreted Concord's divine solution to the nirik problem. While cities across the realm slowly depopulated as The Silence strengthened, many fled to Rhapsody, which continued to grow in size and influence. The city carefully wielded its religious fervor to halt the changes and modernization that had caused so much chaos in the rest of the realm without resorting to implementing the Matriarch's policies, and so survived the intervening century relatively unscathed.\n\nNowadays, §CRhapsody§! boasts the largest population in all of the realm, and the city is larger and more prosperous than any other kirin city in the world. The kirin of Rhapsody are fiercely independent and envision themselves as a cut above the rest of their kind, empowered and enlightened by their interpretations of Concord's teachings.

Verdant is that city, once strong and grand on a level to rival even the city of §YRhapsody§! far to the east, and even wrestling with the city of §YFragrance§! as the realm's most important trading city. Verdant controls all the trade flowing out of the realm's heartlands and into the South Kirin Sea, and once enjoyed close trade ties with the city of §YBlossom§! in the nearby breakaway state of §YSen Kinh§!.\n\nWhere other cities such as Rhapsody, Fragrance, and even the imperial capital of §YVermilion§! grew up and out into dense cities, Verdant capitalizes on its unique geography by spreading out across the Great Mellifluve, with raised communities perched on the many islands and the flat riverbanks, causing the city to completely dominate the mouth of the river. Spread out as it is, roads within and around the city are small and scarce; rather, the kirin of Verdant travel from place to place using hundreds of canals and thousands of small boats. This serves them well during the spring flood season, where the banks of the Great Mellifluve swell and the river can rise as high as ten meters, submerging any surface roads for weeks at a time. To combat this, the buildings of Verdant are raised on wooden and bamboo stilts that keep them elevated above the Great Mellifluve in all but the worst floods. When the river is at its highest during the flooding season, the islands in its waters disappear, and the raised buildings appear to float on the water, thus giving rise to its second moniker: §CThe City that Floats§!.\n\nThe collapse of river trade during the institution of §RThe Silence§! took a great toll on the city's economy. Without a reliable stream of goods and trade flowing down the river toward the city, Verdant's economy sharply contracted, forcing the growing capitalist and industrialist classes to flee north to Fragrance, the city that still desperately tried to maintain trade relations with the rest of Zebrica, and so the best remaining hope for the businesskirin to hold onto what assets they had left. As for the rest of the kirin in Verdant, many migrated out of the city into the surrounding farmlands to take up subsistence farming, or slowly isolated themselves into one of the city's many island communities, taking up fishing to survive. With the city fragmenting into dozens, if not hundreds of communities isolated by water and canals, it was perhaps a surprise to find that the city did not suffer or decline too greatly in power and influence in the region. Seeing the resilience of their city, many priests and mystics of §CThe Way of Fire§! took this as a sign that The Silence could yet be compatible with the teachings of §GConcord§!, and pointed toward the communalism of the city's communities for proof. Over the decades, this way of thinking has created a new sect of The Way of Fire known as §CThe Rising Fire§!, which argues that improved and reorganized communal societies can keep the realm strong while also paying homage to Concord and abiding by the decrees of The Silence. For now, the priests and mystics of The Rising Fire only hold sway over Verdant and the cities connected to the western branches of the Great Mellifluve, but were The Silence to end, surely they would begin to take their ideas further inland and spread their teachings far and wide.\n"

Humbled by the favor the divine Matriarch gave them, the people of Sorghum and the surrounding farmlands began to refer to their small corner of the realm as §YPeace-And-Plenty§!, a name that soon found its way into official records in the capital.\n\nYet Sorghum was not always peaceful, nor did it have plenty to offer for the kirin that lived there. While much of the modern Realm of Kiria had been united under §CThe Way of Fire§! by 552 ALB, Sorghum and its surrounding lands remained an independent, brutal state under the hoof of the cruel warlord known as §RCinder Scales§!. Under his rule, thousands of peasants were slain in failed uprisings put down by his fiercely loyal and disciplined soldiers, and mystics in the city of §YVerdant§! once claimed that the only thing the fisherkirin could catch for a season were the bodies of slaughtered peasants from up north, their spilt blood tingeing the river crimson.\n\nAttempting to put a stop to the horrible atrocities happening in Sorghum and finally unify the nation, the §OVermilion Priestess§! §CIridescent Dawn§! ventured into Sorghum with a procession of her fellow priests and priestesses to convince Cinder Scales and his followers to repent of their sinful ways, and embrace the wisdom of the fire goddess §GConcord§!. Cinder Scales imprisoned the procession instead, yet when he attempted to execute the monks upon a massive funeral pyre to show how powerless their deity was, Iridescent Dawn instead emerged from the fire as a §Gmajestic kirin§! twice the size of every other kirin, seemingly gifted with Concord's divine blessing. The warlord repented upon seeing this display of divinity, and with a promise to build the city's first temple to The Way of Fire and Concord, Sorghum was finally integrated into the realm as the city in which the §YFirst Matriarch Superior§! of the §OVermilion Dynasty§! had consummated her §Cascension§!.\n\nLike the rest of the realm, the imposition of §RThe Silence§! on the nation has seen Sorghum's fortunes slowly decline. The city itself has largely been depopulated, with most of the inhabitants moving back out into Sorghum's ample farmlands to resume their way of life before the introduction of modernization. Now, with The Silence beginning to recede across the nation, Sorghum stands ready to return to the glory it once held, and perhaps peace and plenty will return to the city of Iridescent Dawn's ascension once more.\n"

state_lore_text_container_state_description_1081:0 "Fed by the waters flowing down from the §YCinereous Strath§! mountains, the city of §YChrysanthemum§! is the most westward urban province of the §YRealm of Kiria§!. As such, it has long held its own sense of self-identity, and, given the sparse population of western Kiria when compared to the densely-populated east, the region has historically been somewhat of a backwater, insulated from the hustle and bustle of the eastern dynastic heartland. Even in the tumultuous centuries before §CThe Way of Fire§! had unified Kiria, Chrysanthemum had avoided the worst of the bloodshed and violence commonplace throughout the realm, for few built-up towns and settlements inhabited the rural western countryside, and thus organised conflict between different kirin communities rarely erupted.\n\nIn those times, the settlement of Chrysanthemum served as an informal hub for riverine trade along the western tributaries of the §YGreat Mellifluve§!. Chrysanthemum, then merely a sparsely-populated fishing village, would eventually swell in size as farmers and craftskirin would travel there en masse during the summer to sell their goods to river traders. Obviously, so many kirin traveling to one city would more often than not result in §Rtempers flaring§!, but the impermanence of the gathering spot and its temporary structures lent itself well to weathering §Rnirik transformations§!, and so the annual convergence continued without too much trouble.\n\nChrysanthemum only underwent true urban development once The Way of Fire had been introduced to the area, allowing the kirin communities to establish a larger, more permanent settlement along the river, with the teachings and tenets of the fire goddess §GConcord§! serving as a means to suppress the nirik state and facilitate the integration of the nearby rural communities into the city. Chrysanthemum has, ever since then, served as the unifying hub that connects the rural western communities to the authority and decrees of the §OVermilion Dynasty§!, and its influence reaches even the most isolated communities in the western realm.\n\nHowever, §RThe Silence§! effectively separated the city from the capital of §YVermilion§! and the rest of the Realm. Chrysanthemum, now left as a lonely hub of religious authority in the west, found itself desperately trying to maintain connections with the cities further down the Great Mellifluve, asking for instruction and support from both its neighboring urban centers and the fire goddess, as its population declined and kirin began to return to their neighboring communities. The city might have dissolved entirely had it not been for a revitalization of religious preaching and fervor spread by the city of §YVerdant§!, which had begun professing its own sect of The Way of Fire known as §CThe Rising Fire§!. In the new teachings, which promised a way to marry the decrees of The Silence to egalitarian communalist ideals, the leaders of Chrysanthemum found hope that they could keep their city from fading away again as it once had done centuries ago. With its authority and control over the west, Chrysanthemum has begun spreading the teachings of The Rising Fire to the rural communities surrounding it, and thanks to their efforts, the sect is firmly rooted in the western realm.\n\nWith the Silence ending, however, there must soon come a reckoning between The Way of Fire in the east and The Rising Fire in the west. Only time will tell if Chrysanthemum can peacefully reconcile with long-distant Vermilion, and once again serve as its hub of imperial authority in the west, or if it will instead try to spread this new religious sect all the way down the Great Mellifluve, potentially altering kirin society forever.\n"

Up until §RThe Silence§!, the city of Radiance received hundreds of ships a year, each carrying traders, petitioners, and foreign dignitaries on their way to the capital of Vermilion, where the Matriarch Superior of the §OVermilion Dynasty§! rules over the Realm. Though not as important of a trading city as §YFragrance§! or §YVerdant§!, Radiance was able to maintain a robust economy and a healthy population due to its importance and proximity to Vermilion, and had begun to rival Fragrance in the years leading up to The Silence. The roads connecting it to Vermilion were some of the largest and most modern in the Realm before The Silence wrapped the nation in its stifling grip, and many nobles and members of the Vermilion Dynasty maintained homes and estates in and around the city to enjoy the warm weather of summer by the shore.\n\nUnfortunately, its greatest strength became its most crippling weakness when The Silence was declared more than a century ago. With the advent of The Silence, petitioners and foreign dignitaries seeking an audience with the Matriarch Superior dwindled to nothing, and trade between Vermilion and Radiance all-but ceased.

At its center lies the §OShrine of the Flaming Lotus§!, a small altar with a jade box said to contain a perpetually burning lotus blossom — proof of Concord's Divine Will. From this sacred place, the monastery expanded outwards, with other temples built around the central shrine, followed by walls to protect it all. To protect the monastery and the spark housed within, the wood-and-earth architecture of the fortress and its walls were supplemented by fortified stone baileys and citadels surrounded by open fields, meticulously cultivated to be pleasure gardens in peacetime that could be razed and prepared to become deadly killing fields during a siege. Moats were also carved to provide water to the inner sanctum, and to provide another line of defense. Soon, the complex outgrew its first ring of defence, and another layer had to be built. This would repeat a total of §Ythree times§!, with each ring of fortifications representing another age of the city's history. In accordance with the Divine Will of Concord, these sacred rings were built to resemble the petals of a §Plotus flower§!, showing that the burning blossom would always be the city's sacred heart.\n\nWhile the kirin in the north were eventually able to unify under the teachings of §CThe Way of Fire§!, the various city-states of §YZaikiria§! remained fractured and hostile towards each other for a far longer time, even as the religion of §GConcord§! began to permeate into the south. Of these city-states, the cities of §YLotus§! and §YBlossom§! were two of the strongest, and often utilized the smaller city-states between them to engage in regional §Rproxy wars§! to prevent the other from growing too sharply in power and influence. This age of warring states was soon put on hold around 800 ALB when the influence of the §OVermilion Dynasty§! managed to effectively assert itself over the kirin city-states and warlords in the region of §Ysouthern Kiria§!, bringing these kirin into the fold as semi-autonomous protectorates under the jurisdiction of the divine §GMatriarch Superior§! in Vermilion. Given enough time, Zaikiria would have been absorbed into the kirin realm proper, with Lotus being the last hold out of the region, but the abrupt arrival of §RThe Silence§! brought about by rapid modernization of the Vermilion Realm severed the Matriarch's influence in the region. Without the unifying force of the Vermilion Realm's influence to hold them together, the city-states of Zaikiria once again split apart into violent rivalries and fighting.\n\nLotus found itself in a peculiar situation following the establishment of The Silence in the northern realm. A large portion of kirin §Gintellectuals and capitalists§! fled to the city from the Matriarch's realm, trying to find a new home among kirin lands that was free of the oppressive policies of The Silence. This core group of educated kirin became just the tool that Lotus' warlord, §GCinder Tempest§!, would need to expand and solidify his power over Lotus and Zaikiria as a whole. Occupying the Citadel of the Lotus Crown as his headquarters and assimilating these educated kirin into his court, Cinder Tempest embarked on a long §Rcampaign of conquest§! that marched northwards, subjugating each of the Zaikirian city-states in turn, until he finally sacked and subdued Lotus' long-time rival of Blossom.\n\nCinder Tempest returned to Lotus with the spoils of his conquest of Blossom and declared himself King of Sen Kinh and §CBearer of the Lotus Crown§!. Lotus became the capital of his new kingdom, and to celebrate his achievements, Cinder subverted the beliefs of the Southern Way of Fire and declared himself a divine ruler akin to the Matriarch Superior in the north. With his divine authority firmly established, Cinder used the Southern Way as a tool to §Ymaintain social control§! over his new realm, preventing it from falling apart after his death.\n\nNowadays, Lotus remains the seat of the Kingdom of Sen Kinh, though its influence and authority over the rest of the region is beginning to wane as the city-states once again §Ragitate for independence§!.

Caught between the unified §YRealm of Kiria§! and the squabbling city-states of §YZaikiria§!, Blossom has long had to play off of the strengths and weaknesses of its neighbors to survive. Before the divine gaze of the kirin §GMatriarch Superior§! turned her attention to the south, Blossom engaged in an endless series of proxy wars and regional conflicts with its biggest rival, the city-state of §YLotus§!, to the south of the Zaikiria region. But as §CThe Way of Fire§! unified the northern kirin realm and began to spread southwards, Blossom found itself as the first target of an expanding kirin hegemony over the south. As the religion of the north began to permeate the city and its society at every level, the local leaders of Blossom soon found themselves unable to withstand the growing influence of the north in their dominion, and soon were forced to swear fealty to the Matriarch Superior of Kiria, lest the city collapse into open revolt fueled by the religion of The Way of Fire. Blossom found itself established as the §OVermilion Realm's§! power base in the south as the capital of the §YCommandery of Zaikiria§!, from where it could continue to exert its influence and authority over the region. Temples to the fire goddess §GConcord§! replaced any and all shrines to previous gods and deities, and a powerful clergy soon found itself vying for control of the city with its old leaders.

Many kirin in the city believed that, as a bastion of the Matriarch's influence in the south, they should abide by the decrees of The Silence and follow the example of their northern brethren. The kirin who had long hoped for independence from the north, however, saw this as an opportunity to once more establish the dominance of Blossom in Zaikiria. The internal divisions within the city left it weak and ill-prepared to resist the advances of the other Zaikirian city-states, and it was not long before §RCinder Tempest§!, a warlord from the city-state of Lotus, stormed Blossom's walls and sacked the city. Instead of The Silence affording Blossom a chance to rise into renewed glory, it only brought about the ruination of the northernmost city-state, and it was forced to swear fealty to a master for a second time, this time from the south.

state_lore_text_container_state_description_1083:0 "In the dark days before §YKirian unification§! under the §OWay of Fire§! and the §CMatriarchs Superior§!, Kiria was a land of anarchy, warfare, and devastation. Regional warlords and petty tyrants ruled over a myriad of incessantly warring fiefdoms through terror and violence. It was away from this landscape of fear and tears that a steady trickle of kirin peasantry made their way south to the §GZaikirian frontier§! — a sparsely-populated and untamed land yet-untouched by the nirik warlordism that ravaged Kiria.\n\nIt was on the northern bank of the §CMarekong River§! that the furthest kirin settlement in the south of Zaikiria — §OMadrepore§! — was founded during the beginning of the 6th century. Refugees from Kiria Proper had established settlements all throughout the Zaikirian interior and coastline, but Madrepore's favourable location at the mouth of the Marekong River, its expansive deepwater harbour, and a general consensus among the refugee diaspora that the settlement — situated, far away from the chaos of the homeland they had fled, in the southernmost reaches of Zaikiria — was as auspicious a place to put down roots as any, meant that it attracted a significant influx of kirin immigrants that would only increase as Madrepore grew in size.\n\nWhile the kirin settlements in the territories of what would later become known as §PKhamrin§! determinedly rejected any form of central government to maintain the sovereignty and independence of each settlement, the informal and hidden forces of trade, commerce, and population exchange meant that Madrepore, making full use of its geographical advantages, was able to §Ydominate the smaller inland polities§! in economic, cultural, and therefore, political, terms. While the member-settlements of the §PLeague of Khamrin§! each retain and maintain their own standing militia-armies in accordance with the §YTreaty of Terramare§!, thus ensuring a significant degree of local autonomy and self-rule, it is undeniable that Madrepore is the lynchpin and mainspring of the League.\n\nMadrepore's location also made it the primary site for cross-cultural exchange between the kirin settlers and the §Yzebra natives of the Far South§!. Even after Kirian unification, Madrepore, far away from Vermilion, escaped the all-encompassing influence of the Way of Fire that would become a permanent defining feature of society and politics in kirin civilisation. The legend of the §RThunder Tiger§! — the powerful, incomprehensible, and all-too-real mystical deity which protects the §YGolden Temple§! — would inspire the kirin of Khamrin to come to terms with the §Onirik state§! by their own means.\n\nThe Khamrini kirin interpreted stories of zebra villagers living in the vicinity of the Golden Temple who, upon encountering would-be looters or tomb raiders, would attack them in a fit of §Rpsychotic rage§! attributed to possession by the §RThunder Tiger§!, to conceive of the §Onirik state§! as something caused by spiritual or mystical forces beyond the control of ordinary kirin. Unlike the Kirian §CWay of Fire§!, which stigmatised the nirik state and mandated the ostracisation of those who had lapsed, the Khamrini §PSect of Southerly Lumination§! tolerated those kirin who had turned nirik, holding that they were not at fault for losing control of their selves, while maintaining that a kirin who turned nirik had a moral and civic duty to compensate those among their peers who had suffered injury as a result of their lapse.\n\nThe authority of the doctrine of the Sect of Southerly Lumination among the Khamrini kirin meant that it came to serve a similar political, if not as strictly absolutist, role as the Way of Fire in Kiria — as an arbitrator, and occasional arbiter, in disputes initially relating to lapses into the nirik state, but whose remit eventually expanded to encompass matters of civics, commerce, and culture. Although the §Yindustrialisation of Khamrin§! and the emergence of a new social class of capitalists, businessmares, and traders would eventually, peacefully and over time, put an end to the Sect's monopoly on political power, the priests and mystics of the Southerly Lumination still constitute a formidable and well-entrenched interest group in Madreporean and Khamrini politics today.\n\nMadrepore has miles of §Cdocklands, wharves, and shipyards§!, along both banks of the Marekong River as well as on the shores of the city's deepwater harbour. The headquarters of the Madrepore Merchant Marine are located in the heart of the metropolis, alongside the §LBastion of the Lantern§!, which houses the archives and bureaucracy of the Southerly Lumination. The §GDiet of the Khamrini League§! is also situated in Madrepore, making it the de-facto capital of the League, although the stately palace in which it is housed, constructed out of wood and stone in traditional 8th-century Zaikirian architectural style, is overshadowed by neighbouring modern neo-Pegasopolian edifices housing the head offices of Madreporean corporate §Yparastatals§! and conglomerates. Significant too is the §RCaliginous Penitentiary§! on the outskirts of the metropolis, a prison and work camp where those who had lapsed into the nirik state — and were unable to pay the charges levied by the Southerly Lumination for absolution from their transgression — strive to earn their redemption through hard labour.\n"

However, as the Talonostras' power waned in the 2nd century BLB, so too did the city's wealth. The §RDeath of King Marus§! in 34 BLB was the final straw, and the §Rcivil war§! that followed left the city devastated, marking the beginning of the city's §R"Dark Age,"§! which would continue until the 2nd century ALB, when the revival of trade routes between §YWingbardy§! and §YAquileia§! would allow the city to return to its former splendor. This newfound prosperity would continue to increase with the §GUnification of Talouse§! under §CGiovanni di Chiazbini§! in 602 ALB and its designation as the new nation's capital. Talouse's peaceful submission to §OGrover I§! and Talononte's relative isolation from the rest of the §OEmpire§! meant that it remained mostly unchanged during Imperial rule, and that very little Groverian influence found its way into the city. \n\nThe city today has still managed to retain much of its ancient charm, in spite of the advances of modernity.

Beyond the downtown lie vast suburbs composed of countless apartment blocks and slums that house the city's workers. This is Talononte's dark underbelly, where the §RMafia thrives, socialists rule, and crime is rampant.§! Meanwhile, smokestacks and industrial blocks line the Arneo, pouring smoke into the sky, and polluting the river's waters as the city's burgeoning industrial sector continues to grow and expand. \n\nThe city's peaceful appearance makes it hard to believe that it was the stage of one of the largest §Rstrikes§! in Griffonian history, as thousands of workers made their way down the streets to demand improved conditions. Although the marchers are now back at work, their impact can still be felt, as an uneasy tension hangs over the city.

Close trade ties were established with Equestria and the city began to grow rapidly.

The city's famed port was greatly expanded, factories were built and griffons flooded in from the countryside.

When the three tribes first migrated south, some of the seafaring ponies decided to settle on uninhabited islands east of the lands which later became known as §CSeveryana§!. It is not known when exactly the city was founded, but the earliest records come from centuries before Luna's Banishment.\n\nThe settlement quickly became an important center of trade when overseas routes to §OGriffonia§! were established, which gave the islands their name. This importance further increased when the port of §YPetershoof§! was founded in 590 ALB. Trottingham's harbour was greatly expanded and thousands of migrants arrived from both Severyana and Griffonia, diversifying the population. During the §YIndustrial Revolution§!, textile manufactories were founded, lace became one of the primary exports and the town grew into a true city.\n\nThe inhabitants of the Griffish Isles still speak a dialect that derives from §YOld Ponish§!, which is one of the more distinct accents of Equestria. This means that ponies coming from the Griffish Isles can easily be recognized for their archaic way of speaking. The age of the venerable city can also be seen in its architecture, with its buildings having various styles from different periods and cultures. The most famous sights are the historical Lace Market, the Council House, the Great Harbour, the remains of the city's stone walls and the nearby Trottingham Castle. Many who visit the historical center of the city say that it almost feels like travelling back in time. However, this illusion fades away the further away you go, as the outskirts of the city are more recently constructed and far more modern.\n\nMore recently, the Trottingham's history has taken a darker turn. With the §RWinter Revolution§! in Severyana, one of the most important trade partners was lost, causing an economic downturn and making the city more reliant on aid from Canterlot. This in turn has led to unrest among the workers, partially thanks to communist agitation. In addition, the breakup of the §OGriffonian Empire§! caused an influx of griffon migrants and refugees, which have caused increased racial tensions. The city's future is now uncertain, but nopony doubts that the ancient city will continue to stand the test of time."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_136:0 "Since its foundation, the city of Acornage has been defined by the relationship between ponies and changelings. Indeed, the first encounters between the two races occured near §YFort Acorn§!, the predecessor to the city itself that was founded by Equestrian settlers who colonized the uninhabited wilderness of northwestern Equestria. Different sources explain the nature of these outcomes differently. According to Equestrian historiography, it was cautious but ultimately friendly, as ponies presented gifts to the strange shapeshifting creatures. Traditionally, Changeling records did not mention gifts, but during the reign of §GQueen Chrysalis§! history has been reinterpreted and the encounters are seen as hostile and even violent.\n\nWhatever the case, the fort soon became a trading post, and then a town. It was the only place in Equestria where ponies could acquire finely woven §GChangeling silk§!, so commerce boomed and thousands of migrants arrived. Changelings arrived in the city as well, initially living in a separate quarter but soon integrating into the populace, often shapeshifting into ponies to fit in better. Acornage was - and still is - the one place in the world where one can see changeling hive spires next to traditional Equestrian houses.\n\nWhen the changelings were unified under one nation in 982 ALB, the border of the newborn country was drawn right next to the city. Equestrians agreed to Chrysalis' demands, thinking it would be the foundation of a friendly relationship between the two nations. They would later regret this when relations soured and the complete lack of a buffer zone made the city strategically vulnerable. Despite the rising tensions, business in the city continued as usual, with the local changelings and ponies remaining on friendly terms. This changed in §R1002 ALB§!, when Canterlot itself came under attack. The treacherous stab at the heart of Equestria shocked everypony, especially the inhabitants of Acornage. Overnight, the mood in the city changed, and many saw changelings as unreliable and a potential fifth column. Racial harmony was replaced with racial tensions, and thousands of fearful changelings fled the city across the border.\n\nAfter the initial harsh reactions, the situation calmed down as Chrysalis licked her wounds in Vesalipolis. There was an attempt at making amends, but most citizens felt like there was no going back. Yet, deep in their hearts, the inhabitants of Acorange know that their home city is proof that changelings and ponies can not only get along, but be true friends with one another."

The fort was built on a river island that was easy to defend from §Ybuffalo raiders§! or §Rmonsters§!. This hoof-shaped island gave the settlement its name as it grew around the fort. Despite its location, it was nevertheless §Rdestroyed§! by a fearsome buffalo raid that used canoes to cross the river. A pony who led the defence and perished, §YFlanchard§!, became the mythical founding hero of Hoofington.\n\nAfter making peace with the natives, the determined settlers rebuilt Hoofington from the ground up as a modern planned city. Mining operations in the eastern §YMacintosh mountains§! and increased trade with the buffalo resulted in rapid growth of the town. Soon enough, money began pouring in from Canterlot and the §YCelestia Dam§! was built, creating the Hoofington reservoir. Investments into education also allowed the opening of many research facilities and schools. With the expanded knowledge base, a source of energy and a steady supply of raw materials, industrial facilities soon opened, and with them came a flood of workers from the north. Within years, Hoofington rivaled §YDodge City§! in size, despite being much younger.\n\nProspectors dug many tunnels around and beneath the city in search of ores. While they didn't find any, there are plans to use the tunnels for metro stations, as the rapidly growing city could greatly benefit from new methods of transportation. What the miners did find was a §glarge and ancient meteorite§! that had magical properties. It has been studied for many years now, and researchers hope that it could one day be used as a source of energy. In the meantime, a second hydroelectric dam was recently built, and it was named the §3Luna Dam§!, to honour the reformed Princess of the Night.\n\nWhile the §Y"Spirit of the Mild West"§! is almost nonexistent in Hoofington, it has nevertheless established itself as one of the greatest cities of the Equestrian south.

Because of its central location and religious significance, Mount Aris has stood throughout the ages as the foremost city of the island. When the hippogriffs and seaponies were §Punited§! into one kingdom, the first monarchs naturally chose the city as their capital, although they maintained a coequal seat of government beneath the waves in §CSeaquestria§!.\n\nAs a visitor explores the city center, admiring the §YRoyal Palace§! and the famous Royal Guard regiments that protect it, they will find it hard to believe that not long ago the entire city was §Rabandoned§!.

The years spent in exile were hard for the city's inhabitants, as they dealt with fear and privation in an unfamiliar environment while their city became a §Rghost town§!. Yet the Arisians managed to preserve the essential elements of their economy and industry while in underwater exile, so the city bounced back quickly when the hippogriffs returned after their victory over the Storm King's forces.\n\nJust outside the city you will find the §YHarmonizing Heights§!, one of the most sacred locations in all of Hippogriffia. The heights are famous for their natural beauty, diverse §Gflora and fauna§!, and the unique acoustics from which they get their name. Visitors will find that even the sound of a simple gust of wind becomes a whimsical chime on the heights. The neighborhoods near the heights are filled with dazzling examples of traditional hippogriff architecture, a far cry from the dull apartment buildings that dominate the §gindustrial districts§! on the far side of the mountain.\n\nAlthough it is located at the center of Aris, Mount Aris has a seapony population comparable to any of the island's coastal cities.

To accommodate them, the city has numerous §Cpools and fountains§! in public areas, as well as locations specifically designed for long-term seapony living.\n\nAmid the sea of instability that has consumed North Zebrica in recent years, Mount Aris stands as a shining beacon of harmony, prosperity, and hope."

So great was their splendour and so high their acclaim that, during the early days of intercontinental exploration, they became a popular stopping-off point for both established and emerging naval powers of the age. From Sicameonese traders to Equestrian explorers, their generosity and unwavering cultural tolerance had transformed them into a beacon of multiculturalism in the Meridian.\n\nThis tolerance, combined with their deeply interpersonal political system, would ultimately lead to their absorption into Saddle Arabia through a series of diplomatic maneuvers, with the rest of the isles following not long after.

Rather, the colder climate of what is now referred to as ‘the home isle’ was already a biological §gnon-issue§! and the mountainous terrain surrounded by water offered an excellent spot to build a city §Yprotected from the elements and from outsiders§!. It’s most likely that in subsequent years fishing and limited supplementary farming allowed the settlement to grow as it remained relatively unaccosted by other yeti tribes. When it inevitably grew larger, the naturally-afforded peacefulness §Rwaned§! as its desirability as a potential capital or as a fiefdom in its own right §Gwaxed§! in kind.\n\nNeedless to say that when the §CStorm King§! rose to prominence, the aptly named city soon became the centre of his §Yunprecedented empire§!; although the practicality of the fortress he built inside it is certainly §gdebatable§!.\n\nDuring his brief but influential reign, the §Galready industrialising§! city developed rapidly into the heart of §Ymilitary production§! for the kingdom; in particular pioneering many new and unique methods of manufacturing §Cairship components§!. Additionally, the unusually potent §Ycrystal§! formations located below the city and within the surrounding mountains were thoroughly explored during a five-year excavation project. The mineral exploitation was spearheaded by none other than §3Ikvus Hailstorm§! during his tenure as an advisor to §CHis Majesty§! and has quickly become a vital industry of the city, in no small part because of additional deposits of §Ytungsten and steel§! which were also discovered as a result.\n\nMuch like §CKaren§!, §Cthe Eye of the Storm§! has also received a significant influx of §3storm creatures§! over the last few years; although for wholly §Ydifferent reasons§!. Some have made the newly hollowed mountains their home, whilst others are simply veterans of §CThe Deluge§! crawling back; §Rsometimes literally§!. The latter have been §gproblematically asocial§! even compared to their kin, verging occasionally on §Rcomplete unresponsiveness§!. Sadly, the world continues turning all the same.\n\nToday the §Cgreat city of yetikind§! stands tall and §Grelatively untarnished§! by the many wars waged by its previous ruler. Some even say that the §gancestors§! have watched over them from the spires of the §Yblizzardstone palace§! at its very centre, keeping them §Gsafe§! from the horrors of §Rwar§!.\n"

state_lore_text_container_state_description_1031:0 "As the §Ysecond largest§! majority-yeti city, §CKaren§! has developed a life all of its own. Nobody knows who founded the city or why it was built so far inland, yet its position between two large tributaries of the Neighle is the likely reason for its current size and §Grelative prosperity§!. In addition, the city regularly reports an unusually large number of §3storm creature§! residents and workers; many of whom have moved there from the mountains either over generations or more recently en masse with the arrival of §3Gyz Windborn§!.\n\nThanks in no small part to the downriver trade as well as the surrounding fertile farmland, §CKaren§! quickly developed an §geconomic and political elite§! that are §Yprolific§! in the current era. They are the reason for the region’s continued prosperity but also its §Rlacking industrialisation§! as productive reforms were avoided in favour of traditional revenue sources with the intent of maintaining a profitable §gstatus quo§!.\n\nOf course, everything changed when the §CStorm King§! arose.\n\nThe §gelites§! claim that he emerged from their great city and only later marched on the true capital, although this remains unproven. It is however known that he at least conquered §CKaren§! and the surrounding territories §Yvery early on§! during the his §Cunification wars§!, marking the start of a short-lived relationship between his §3advisors§! and the §CKareni§! elite. §YThe latter would provide soldiers§! as they began industrialising their enterprises and §Ythe former returned the favour with additional spoils§! from their ruler’s conquests.\n\nAs with the nation as a whole, this system fell apart when news came of the §CStorm King’s§! passing. The sudden cessation of loot shipments quickly sent the §gelite§! into a §Rfrenzy§!, doing their best to §Yredevelop§! their beloved city and §Yrefill their rapidly draining coffers§!; allowing popular discontent to §Rrise§! in the background as starving soldiers they had pressed into service returned to their homes.\n\nIt was no surprise when they started clamouring for §Rchange§!.\n"

state_lore_text_container_state_description_775:0 "Traditionally, the §rKingdom of Abyssinia§! had a mobile §Yitinerant capital§!, as the royal court moved across the Kingdom to govern it more effectively. As such, there was no official "capital city" for many centuries. This changed after the §YClawomonic Restoration§!, as Queen Mewodora II decided to establish a permanent capital city in 901 ALB to modernize and centralize her realm. She started the construction of a grand royal palace in a city called Panthera.\n\nIt is unclear when Panthera was founded, as it originated as a small market town on the Panther river. It was chosen as a capital due to its relatively central location and proximity to both the coastline and the trade routes that crossed the desert to the Arabian Sea. It expanded rapidly during Queen Mewodora's reign and was practically rebuilt from the ground up as the first truly modern city in all of Abyssinia with the help of §PWingbardian companies§!. As such, its streets are well-lit and carefully planned, its buildings are tall and there is even some plumbing. Countless irrigation channels were dug around the city to create pastures for cattle, so there would be enough food for every cat. However, as the city grew and attracted countless artisans, shopkeepers and slaves, its outskirts turned into crowded slums with traditional circular mud huts. The city is strictly divided into neighbourhoods (sefer) which are clearly divided by wealth, with aristocat and bureaucat neighborhoods appearing completely different from working class ones.\n\nThe royal palace eventually became famous for all the wealth stored in its treasury. This unsurprisingly attracted the attention of a certain Yeti known as the §CStorm King§!, who invaded Abyssinia. Panthera was the last bastion of resistance to fall, and many buildings were burned down during the attack. The cats had no counter to the yetis' airships however and §YKing Gomez§! decided to surrender to save his subjects from further suffering. The Storm King then completely emptied the royal treasury and promptly left, leaving behind a devastated capital city.\n\nRebuilding efforts have already begun and many cats are picking up the pieces on their own as the government remains paralyzed. While the city remains calm, there are clear signs of anxiety and discontent in the air, with restless slaves, growing food prices and ruins scattered everywhere. It is impossible to tell if the city will be able to recover from the Storm King's wrath."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_741:0 "Coltoba originated as little more than a humble fishing village whose foundation date is unclear. There are some ruins that might be from the period of the ancient §YMaregyptian Pharaohs§!, which would mean ponies have lived there for over a thousand years. The village only rose to prominence after the §rKingdom of Abyssinia§! seized the lands during §YQueen Pawkuno's§! reign in 10 ALB. Two years later, she chose Coltoba as the location of a provincial capital which would be the residence of the governor of §GManedalusia§!. The small village would quickly grow to become a notable regional port town.\n\nWhen §GSaddle Arabia§! invaded Abyssinia, Manedalusia was the first region their soldiers managed to take. While they managed to push deeper into the feline kingdom, they suffered from severe attrition in the mountains. In 672 ALB, a peace treaty was signed where Abyssinia became a tributary of Saddle Arabia and Manedalusia was ceded to them. Soon after, Coltoba became the capital of a newly established §Yautonomous region§! which would be dominated by Saddle Arabian merchants. A new trade route was established, with countless ships sailing from the north and unloading their goods, which were taken by caravans across the desert to Klugetown and then to Farasrah or Timbucktu, and vice versa. This was the golden age of Manedalusia: Coltoba grew to a considerable size and wealthy merchants funded the construction of madrashas and the Great Watrazi Temple. Soon the city became the heart of a new Manedalusian culture, which mixed Maregyptian language, culture and religion with Saddle Arabian ones.\n\nGood times do not last forever. After the §RClawomonic Restoration§! in 901 ALB, Abyssinia ceased to pay tribute to the ever-weakening and decadent Saddle Arabia. Unrest grew in Maregypt, culminating in the §RBirthday Revolt§! in 987 ALB, where the independent §YKingdom of Maregypt§! was established. The two kingdoms both had claims on Manedalusia, which remained loyal to Saddle Arabia, so chaos ensued. According to Maregypt, Abyssinian troops illegally crossed into Manedalusia, which prompted a swift mobilization and response from the ponies who wanted to "save" their "fellow estranged Maregyptians" from the feline slavers. Thus in 988 ALB, the brutal §RManedalusian War§! was fought and ended in a stalemate, with Manedalusia partitioned between the two Kingdoms. A ceasefire was signed which has lasted to this day, but it is an uneasy peace as both sides - and especially the local Manedalusians - are unhappy with it. Coltoba is a powderkeg ready to explode, as the locals despise their feline overlords who have enslaved thousands of ponies."

state_lore_text_container_state_description_15:0 "While §CStableside§! was never the most famous or well-traveled city in §PEquestria§!, there was a sort of quaint pleasantness to it that resulted in the once-small town quietly becoming a §Ysizable port city§! over the centuries. Yet despite this, it never lost the tranquil charm that came with the land surrounding it.\n\nDue to its proximity to the jungles of the Equestrian Southeast, Stableside has a §Ydecently-sized minority population§! of §2thestrals§! and what some refer to as the §Gnative ponies§! of the region, though the local culture has become its own unique, yet still harmonious blend. Minor tensions that existed elsewhere in Equestria did not seem to affect Stableside, as its residents believed in friendship and harmony above all else.\n\nPerhaps it was due to this belief in harmony that the formation of a group known as the §OFriendship Lodge§! was so notable. Founded in 993 by a pony named Sunday School, the Friendship Lodge began as a simple §Yponytarian organization§! who desired to help one another throughout their daily struggles. Their acts of charity in the name of §PCelestia§! steadily garnered a following, as nearly everypony could agree that the princess of the sun was a good pony and that helping others was also good. Non-members often found their §Yborderline obsession with Celestia§!, her teachings, and to a lesser extent §rTwilight Sparkle§!'s recently published §PJournal of Friendship§! to be grating at best, though there has been nothing to suggest that the Friendship Lodge has any ulterior motives. Despite §Yclaiming to not be a religion§!, the Friendship Lodge's influence has begun to expand beyond their ponytarian origins, even going so far as to encourage its members to donate a small portion of their income to the organization, while at the same time opening the occasional business. By 1004, they had begun to send "§Yfriendship envoys§!" to other cities, even other nations in attempts to promote their beliefs.\n\nAt the dawn of 1006, §CStableside§! had become quite the tourist destination for the wider Equestrian populace, leading to the city's economy becoming truly prosperous. Perhaps in time, Stableside might join the ranks of §YFillydelphia§!, §YLas Pegasus§!, or the other great port cities of Equestria."

### Ideas ###
AES_unity_act_spirit:0 "National Unity Act"
AES_unity_act_spirit_desc:0 "The National Unity Act was signed after the tumultuous period of the Storm King and subsequent Karkadannistan invasions of Aestlonia. Its primary goal was to unite the country and facilitate its reconstruction. To achieve this, the Act formalized proper political parties, while also granting representation and power to the Millenary Path. This was intended to ensure that all factions had a say in the country's governance in exchange for their cooperation.\n\nWhile the Act accelerated Aestlonia's recovery from the war, it now poses an obstacle to further political and economic reforms. The structure it established has led to a perpetual political standstill, as parties rarely reach full agreement on any reform."
AES_aestlonia_identity:0 "Aestlonian Identity"
AES_aestlonia_identity_desc:0 "From the great migration, to the wrath of the cultists, the rule of the Arabs and now independence. Our great nation has endured a lot. With carefully planned reforms and programs, a new wave of nationalistic fervor has risen amongst our people who identify first as Aestlonian."
AES_ajloun_batallion:0 "Legacy of the Ajloun Brigade"
AES_ajloun_batallion_desc:0 "Formed in the sixth century after the formation of the Governorate of Hestraya, the Ajloun Brigade were a reaction to the resurgence of cultist attacks upon the civilian population of the region. While one out of many such groups, it was the most well known and has a rich and storied history of protecting the weak; something that it carries out even to this day.\n\nHowever, as much as it has been a boon to the people, the archaic organization of such groups cannot stand against the armies of nations today. While how far should our modernization efforts go remains in question, no one can doubt that the current militias are very much out of date."
AES_equipment_bad_standards:0 "Lowered Production Standards"
AES_equipment_bad_standards_desc:0 "The quality of our products are being lessened, in the hopes of keeping pace with our military’s needs and requirements. While not as lethal as they should be, the weapons produced are still no less deadly."
AES_equipment_bad_standards_v2:0 "Optimized System"
AES_equipment_bad_standards_v2_desc:0 "Our factories have worked tirelessly, managing to work out a system to efficiently hammer out equipment without compromising on its quality and still delivering on time."
AES_production_complex_idea:0 "National Production Complex"
AES_production_complex_idea_desc:0 "With the choice of focusing over an organized industrial basis that produces high quality weaponry, the guilds of our nation are steadily transformed into a production complex that fulfills the needs of our army. Grey smoke stacks fill the skylines of the capital in contrast to the blue-white panorama of our winters, and factories aplenty churn out the tools to protect our sovereignty; with more being built on the horizon."
AES_production_complex_idea_v2:0 "The Fires of Industry"
AES_production_complex_idea_v2_desc:0 "With sufficient coordination, planning and provisions from the crown, the once few factories that dotted our nation are now turned into vast industrial complexes. Investment is high, opportunities are plentiful and employment even more so; leading to a boom in the development of our country. The fires of these modern-day forges burn red hot, running strong even in the bleak midwinter, to provide Aestlonia with its needs."
AES_karkad_war_buffs:0 "Never Again"
AES_karkad_war_buffs_desc:0 "##TODO, We might have once lost to Karkadannistan, but this mistake will not repeat. We are fully committed to safeguard our freedom, we have learnt from the past and we're still here to say it proudly: "Aestlonia shall be free!""
AES_3_plus_1_languages:0 "3+1 Issue"
AES_3_plus_1_languages_desc:0 "Made up of many communities of different cultural backgrounds, the Aestlonian nation is home to a diverse population that speaks 3 different languages. To make matters worse, after the Arabs imposed their rule upon the region, their own language was introduced as the “universal” language which was used to draft official documents and records. Centuries later, this poses a hurdle for the nation where Arab communities (while a significant minority) constitute a small percentage of the population; most of which are not versed in their language."
AES_3_plus_1_languages_v2:0 "Slowly Forming Identity"
AES_3_plus_1_languages_v2_desc:0 "For centuries, the communities of Aestlonia have not had the opportunity to take a breather and appreciate the diversity of culture and languages of their nation. Now, with recent efforts undertaken by the Princess, work is being done on forging a nascent Aestlonian identity."
AES_army_language_spirit:0 "Army Language"
AES_army_language_spirit_desc:0 "The various languages, once a major hindrance to a unified cultural zeitgeist, has allowed our armed corps to communicate in a unique manner unseen in any other nation's armed forces and has helped foster a closer understanding of the different cultures inhabiting our nation; leading to a bond over shared heritage and belonging."
AES_the_evil_pact:0 "Lumetorm Pact"
AES_the_evil_pact_desc:0 "##TODO, with the temporary pact officialized the cultist have gotten a lot more influence over the Aestlonian government. But, at least, the cultists might start joining the army."
AES_windigo_spirit_preparationtree:0 "Warriors of the Ice Spirits"
AES_windigo_spirit_preparationtree_desc:0 "##TODO, The cultists have created this whole concept around the Windigos, one that has started to resonate even with part of our army. People are now doing near to fully suicidal missions and acts in name of the spirits."
AES_for_harmony:0 "Fighting for Harmony"
AES_for_harmony_desc:0 "##TODO, we're not fighting because we want war, we're fighting simply to protect what's ours. They started this fire, not us. If they want a fight, they will have one. But we won't forget our principles."
AES_ponykind_volunteers:0 "Pony Volunteers"
AES_ponykind_volunteers_desc:0 "##TODO, all over pony nations our call has been heard. One of resistance against a foreign enslaving enemy that wants to destroy our lands and people. These brave volunteers will help our country in more ways than just manpower, as their presence allows us to learn from their teachings."
AES_arab_volunteers:0 "Arab Volunteers"
AES_arab_volunteers_desc:0 "##TODO, our righteous message was able to convince quite a few of the horses of Arabia and beyond to fight for our cause. Not only are they helping us by holding our frontlines but they're also providing much of their advanced knowledge."
AES_worker_support:0 "Union Support"
AES_worker_support_desc:0 "##TODO, with the union on our side our production complex can only get better."
AES_volatile_politics:0 "Volatile Politics"
AES_volatile_politics_desc:0 "##TODO, with our decision to rip up the act so suddenly and without anything to replace it with the political landscape has been left quite shaken."
AES_uncoop_army:0 "Uncooperative Army"
AES_uncoop_army_desc:0 "##TODO, due to the signing of the Lumetorm Pact most of those in our army have lost a lot of faith in our administration. Leading to them not fighting as hard. While there are others who are just straight up deserting."
AES_cultist_opposition:0 "Cultist Sabotage"
AES_cultist_opposition_desc:0 "##TODO, with our refusal to work with them the cultist have taken to sabotage us in our war against Karkadannistan."
AES_arab_resentment:0 "In Limbo"
AES_arab_resentment_desc:0 "##TODO, after recent events the considerably sized Arab community has been left in a state of limbo due to Zaida's push to create a more "native" Aestlonian identity. The state now needs to decide if it will try to adopt this culture back into the new cultural framework in some way or if it will work to phase it out."

### Army coup/Republic ideas###
AES_new_regime:0 "Aspirant Republic"
AES_new_regime_desc:0 "##TODO, with the establishment of the republic many political and social groups have become agitated and even enthusiastic to take part in the new regime. But this doesn't mean that our time ruling the country will be easy. Politics are messier than ever and it might be hard to hold onto our popularity in the future as the people demand a true Republic."
AES_recognition_no:0 "Diplomatic Isolation"
AES_recognition_no_desc:0 "##TODO, even if Aestlonia wasn't known for it's web of diplomatic and trade partners, we still had something to fall back on. Now even that is gone with the sudden change of regime, with our few foreign allies feeling uneasy about giving this so-called Republic any legitimacy."
AES_liberal_approach:0 "Liberal Approach"
AES_liberal_approach_desc:0 "##TODO, The way of the sword is not the way that we wish to rule this country. It's clear that our liberal approach of working with the less extremist groups is the best way to ensure stablity and a bright future for the new republic."
AES_liberal_approach_harmonic:0 "Further Liberalization"
AES_liberal_approach_harmonic_desc:0 "##TODO, our efforts to liberalize our ways of governance has been greatly expanded."

AES_authoritarian_approach:0 "Authoritarian Approach"
AES_authoritarian_approach_desc:0 "##TODO, it's best not to be too trusting at times like these. We need to secure the new republic no matter the costs."
AES_authoritarian_approach_fascist:0 "Revival Society Empowered"
AES_authoritarian_approach_fascist_desc:0 "##TODO, even though other Maregyptian revival societies and scholars have denounced the MRS, they were still a needed partner in our quest to rule the nation."
AES_authoritarian_approach_neutral:0 "Army At The Realm"
AES_authoritarian_approach_neutral_desc:0 "##TODO, it was only natural to increase the power of the army over the politics of our new republic. We were the ones to proclaim it after all."

AES_unhappy_pones_desc:0 "##TODO, Be it for political or for personalistic reasons, despite all her mistakes, the Princess certainly made herself liked by the many castes of society. The sudden change certainly hasn't made them happy, and they are sure to let us know."

### Midgame trees shared ideas ###
AES_economy_crash:0 "Post-War Economic Crash"
AES_economy_crash_desc:0 "##TODO, spirit talking about the economy crashing on itself after the end of the war with Karkad as it wasn't very civilian focused. Basically the fire has been put out and there is nothing keeping it going anymore with things returning to normalcy."

AES_unstable_politics:0 "Unstable Politics"
AES_unstable_politics_desc:0 "##TODO, spirit describing that with the end of the war with Karkad the political situation in Aestlonia has now worsened. This being due to the fact that Zaida has abolished the national unity act earlier on in the tree, and without the war thing keeping the political parties distracted they are now demanding that Zaida make true on her promise to decide what happens to the leadership of the nation."
AES_unstable_politics_v2:0 "Stabilizing Politics"
AES_unstable_politics_v2_desc:0 "##TODO, spirit about how politics aren't as chaotic as they used to be right after the end of the Karkad war, but there's still clearly more that needs fixing."

AES_reorganize_army:0 "Reorganize the Militias"
AES_reorganize_army_desc:0 "In centuries past, our people organized into militias to fight against mere cultists. But the armies of our enemies today demand a more professional and modern solution. We shall take the values and experience of groups like the Ajloun Brigade and reforge it into a force capable of holding back the oncoming Karkad incursion."
AES_internal_security:0 "Intensify Internal Security"
AES_internal_security_desc:0 "Aestlonia is not stranger to conflicts within its own borders, particularly with errant cultist cells. As the conflict against Karkad approaches, it would be best to spend some resources to keep better tabs on these forces and cull the threat of internal rebellion. A war on two fronts is the last thing we need."
AES_overdrive:0 "Into Overdrive"
AES_overdrive_desc:0 "Our provisional army is small, weak and outdated. To hold back on modernizing it would spell disaster for us all. Galvanizing our military industrial complex is the best way forward to necessitate our survival."
AES_more_is_more_new:0 "More is More"
AES_more_is_more_new_desc:0 "In the past, Aestlonians formed groups to protect themselves from marauding cultists. But now, entire nations and their armies threaten our sovereignty and our way of life. It is time for every son and daughter of this great nation to do their part for the nation, not just pre-existing militias."
AES_overwhelming_speed_new:0 "Overwhelming Speed"
AES_overwhelming_speed_new_desc:0 "More than simply reframing our forces, we should also focus on evolving them to contemporary standards.

AES_a_true_production_complex_new:0 "A True Production Complex"
AES_a_true_production_complex_new_desc:0 "An army needs more than trained soldiers to defend its borders. It also needs proper and reliable equipment. We must begin investing in infrastructure and tools in order to facilitate such a goal."
AES_all_in_new:0 "All In"

AES_while_the_iron_is_hot_new_desc:0 "The forges of our past now stand transformed into massive factories that churn out weapons of the same high quality but on a much larger scale. While they are more expensive to build, the results of our efforts will far outweigh these costs."
AES_rely_on_our_ways:0 "Rely On Our Ways"
AES_rely_on_our_ways_desc:0 "Despite the Storm King’s incursion, our army still stands equal to most of its enemies. A long tradition of loyalty and protection of the weak has been our ethos for generations. That is why reform, rather than revolution, is what our armed forces require."
AES_need_for_professionalism_new:0 "Need for Professionalism"
AES_need_for_professionalism_new_desc:0 "The backbone of an army is a soldier. And good soldiers are those that follow orders properly and work together like a well oiled machine. Good soldiers do not die easily.

AES_breaking_through_new:0 "No Room for Cowardice"
AES_breaking_through_new_desc:0 "A soldier knows the risks. He knows he joined to fight for his country and die for it. That he will either spill the blood of his enemies or have his own be spilled. When faced with this reality, fear cannot exist. Onwards, soldier! Fight with all you have and make the enemy fear you instead! Make them regret ever attacking our beloved nation!"
AES_secure_old_equipment_new:0 "Secure Old Equipment"
AES_secure_old_equipment_new_desc:0 "A weapon is a weapon, as long as it can kill. While outdated by modern standards, the Ajloun Brigade’s stockpiles must be recovered and integrated into the wider provisional army."
AES_lower_production_standards_new:0 "Lower Production Standards"
AES_lower_production_standards_new_desc:0 "The old forges of Aestlonia cannot keep up with the demand for good quality weapons. Production lines are to be recalibrated in order to increase our stockpile before the war, even if it means lowering quality standards. When the conflict is over and our nation endures, perhaps then we can think about revamping our industry."
AES_optimise_construction_new:0 "Optimize Construction"

AES_unite_the_groups:0 "Unity Effort"
AES_unite_the_groups_desc:0 "The last time Hestraya was united under a common entity, it left behind a significant cultural minority in an already diverse region.

AES_ajloun_institute_of_information:0 "Ajloun Institute of Information"
AES_ajloun_institute_of_information_desc:0 "Education, some say, is the highest form of liberation. Liberation from illiteracy and ignorance. If we help our people understand each other, they can go beyond fearing their differences and learn what truly unites them. The Ajloun Institute of Information will not just be a place of learning. It will be the forge of new ideas and even cultural revanchism."
AES_army_language:0 "An Army Language"
AES_army_language_desc:0 "Forming an armed corps that speaks at least three different languages is no easy feat. As such, a need for a common tongue is necessary for quick and easy communication between divisions and their commanding generals.

AES_welfare_for_service_new:0 "Welfare for Service"
AES_welfare_for_service_new_desc:0 "By providing guaranteed healthcare and social safety nets to those who are willing to serve, we can both increase our military conscription base and deal with our lagging economy. Who could take issue with such an arrangement?"

AES_reaffirm_our_commit:0 "Reaffirm Our Commitment"
AES_reaffirm_our_commit_desc:0 "##TODO, Zaida has grown worried that the people might think she isn't fully committed due to her family's more Arab background. We shal quell those worries by reaffirming her loyalty to Aestlonia, harmony and it's people."
AES_a_hard_choice:0 "A Hard Choice"
AES_a_hard_choice_desc:0 "##TODO, with the war approaching us each day it is time to decide who we should ask for help within our nation. The choice seems simple at first, but, one must not forget about the fact that our enemy is much stronger than we are. Might be time to leave morals aside."
AES_look_to_our_allies:0 "Look To Our Allies"

AES_utilize_the_freeloaders:0 "Utilize the Freeloaders"
AES_utilize_the_freeloaders_desc:0 "##TODO, "Freeloader" is the term that the cultists use when referring to prisoners. Ever since the cult has begun to work with us they have demanded that we form penal battalions to aid in the war. We might just have to accept."

AES_arabian_civil_war_lesson_desc:0 "##TODO, as some kind of twisted game some of the members of the cult have gone to "help out" in the Arabian civil war. Even if their goals clearly weren't benevolent their teachings about the need for supply are still helpful."

aestlonia.1.t:0 "The Path Forward"
aestlonia.1.d:0 "From the icy south wastes to the towering northern mountains, from the kelpie-styled docks of Zarmarej to the weary spires of Ajloun, the whispers of change could be heard in every corner of Aestlonia. Indeed, many ponies believed in them and eagerly carried the words about transformation further on, while some were brave enough to act upon these murmurs, bringing their own vision for the country closer to reality. Still, for now, there was only one creature whose ambition to shift the realm matched their capabilities to do so.\n\nPrincess Zaida paced across her private study impatiently. Whereas her late mother, Princess Rawiya, second of the name, spent a lot of time in the audience chambers, hosting various factions and balancing their expectations, the young ruler had quickly lost any faith in the process of holding an all-pleasing court. In her eyes, the political forces across the Advisory Council were abusing the National Unity Act to focus on their petty problems, burying truly important issues under worthless squabbles. Even the growing threat of Karkadannistani invasion, one promising the very end of their proud nation, was not enough to resolve the constant state of deadlock.\n\nStopping in front of a large window, Zaida pulled the heavy curtains to the sides, allowing in the cold bright sun. The view of her beloved city calmed the princess somewhat, sharpening her focus and tempering her frustration into determination. As always, she needed to act on her own, charting the new course with a sure hoof no matter how rough the coming storm was shaping up to be."
aestlonia.1.a:0 "Emergency royal decrees were drafted shortly."
aestlonia.2.t:0 "Reign and Rein"
aestlonia.2.d:0 "As the heiress apparent, Zaida had experienced an upbringing entirely devoted to the duties and best practices of an enlightened leader. Although the lessons she learned so diligently turned out to be needed much sooner than she had expected, the princess used this core knowledge with great confidence over the last few years.\n\nAmong the different subjects, history had been one of her favorites. There was something especially fascinating and profound to be observed in the rise and fall of the great powers of the world, be it the now obvious collapse of Sa'adles or Grovers, or the smaller signs of decadence seen in the mighty Equestria, promising it a similar path. From where Zaida was standing, all of these examples of decline had common symptoms: bloated bureaucracy, neglected military, technological stagnation, and harmful deference to the traditions. \n\nWith the recent edicts, she did everything to combat the spread of the former three ailments inside of Aestlonia, at least everything possible in the current legal framework. Nonetheless, this was clearly not enough to ensure the survival of the country, and the biggest barrier preventing future reforms became painfully obvious. The princess felt no joy in tearing down her mother's legacy, but she could not afford to delay the next steps any longer, and so, after a short deliberation within the inner circle of the court, a new order was released, one to become a title of many front pages and a top point for many debates."
aestlonia.2.a:0 ""By royal will, National Unity Act is null and void.""
aestlonia.3.t:0 "The Reaction"
aestlonia.3.d:0 "Winter Qalam held little doubt that the present session of the Advisory Council was the most dynamic in the last few months, perhaps even since the coronation of Zaida. Naturally, their gracious ruler was the reason for this perturbation too.\n\n"To sum up, no offense to all the fine folks here, these meetings were really becoming a drag." Steel Raud, the imposing representative of AGWU, currently occupied the speaker's podium. "Her majesty is not only well within her rights to change the laws - this is the only way out of our snowdrifts."\n\nThe creatures in the room started clamoring. The wing occupied by Millenary Path was expectedly united in their vocal disapproval, but Winter noticed negative remarks coming from other parties as well, including some members of his own TBT.\n\n"Order in the assembly!" His duties as a chairpony were sure to be tested today, but the realm needed every bit of stability if Zaida's plans were to work. "We have heard the opinion of the Union, and now would like to invite commentary for further discussion. Honorable Snowstorm, we would be grateful if you could present the opinion of your faction."\n\nA white-maned pony - a cultist, even though Winter never liked the term - rose up after silence finally fell down. "Thank you. This… decision enforced by the princess is nothing but regression to the oppressive regime of the past. Not only does she remove the voice from the common Aestlonians, but she also robs them of the chance to defend their traditions, so nobly provided by her late mother…"\n\nThe rest of the sentence was drowned in the rising wave of accusations, jeering and hollers of support. With a sigh, Winter reached for his gavel again."
aestlonia.3.a:0 ""Order! Order, fillies and gentlecolts!""
aestlonia.4.t:0 "Hour of Sword"
aestlonia.4.d:0 "No war could be fought without the soldiers, and no soldiers would march without a commander. Luckily, Zaida had no delusions regarding her own military prowess, but the upcoming conflict demanded more than an honest assessment of her capabilities. In order to finalize the development of Aestlonian Provisional Army and ensure that its officers would be fully immersed in the reforms, the top brass was summoned to the royal palace for a series of planning sessions and battle plan elaborations.\n\nField marshal Golden Sayif and her generals arrived promptly, ready and able to contribute to the discussions. While Zaida respected Golden’s abilities and accomplishments, as she was sitting in the chamber-turned-headquarters and listening to the officers’ presentations, the princess could easily see that it would be a while before the gruff mare would show her any reverence beyond that dictated by the etiquette.\n\n"We are standing at the crossroads, your majesty. As it was explained prior, troop quality and quantity have their merits, and even with your commendable swiftness we do not have time to achieve both." Marshal’s voice, trained by thousands of orders, rang crisply across the room. "The final decision is yours, and it would be wise to make it today. Permission to speak freely?"\n\n"Granted." Nodding, Zaida wordlessly wondered whether she could stop her from speaking freely at all.\n\n"The Karkad incursion will be short, one way or the other. After it is over, if Aestlonia stands, the power you have to change it will be curtailed." Golden gave the princess a hardened stare. "Use it well, and remember, when the strife comes, the corruption from within will raise its head too. Do not allow the damned cult to spread its taint with abandon again.""
aestlonia.4.a:0 ""Your... advice is noted, lady marshal.""
aestlonia.6.t:0 "Grind Down, Build Anew"
aestlonia.6.d:0 ""You! Private!" Golden Sayif focused all her attention on a single recruit in the long line, causing him to visibly shake. "How many laps did you make in the allotted time?"\n\n"T-t-ten." The heavy breaths and ample amount of sweat indicated that this was the extent of the stallion's current physical form. Golden had no doubts that a green member of the old Ajloun Brigade would make fifteen with a leisurely trot. Shivering under her heavy gaze still, the unfortunate pony felt a need to add something else. "Y-your highness."\n\nFrom a certain point of view, the marshal felt sorry for this lot. The decision to have enough bodies to properly cover the entire front line with Karkadannistan was strategically sound, but it also meant that the quality of the future defenders of the nation was, as one of the officers tactfully put it, below average. Thus, it fell to Golden to make these pathetic whelps into something presentable.\n\n"YOUR HIGHNESS? You can call a mare you are trying to woo "your highness", though I don’t think you have a chance with muscles like that." With every booming word, the recruit seemed to shrink away further and further. "You will call me Marshal Golden, or ma’am. Is. That. Clear?"\n\n"Yes. Marshal Golden. Ma’am." After whispering his answer, the pony winced as laughter from the tail end of the formation reached his ears. Golden, meanwhile, was happy to pounce on the new target.\n\n"Oh, the privates who made less than ten find it funny? Well, all of you can have fun." She raised her voice to the full commanding power, causing everyone to snap to attention immediately. "Five minutes of rest for you all, and another run. All who fail to get twelve make a third attempt. IS THAT CLEAR?""
aestlonia.6.a:0 ""Yes, Marshal Golden, ma’am!""
aestlonia.7.t:0 "Building Upon the Old"
aestlonia.7.d:0 "Golden Sayif had a faint smile on her face, a sight as rare as a hot summer in Aestlonia. In the distance, the enemy dummy stood peppered with a few holes; specifically, three in the chest and two in the head.\n\nFive perfect shots. The shooter himself was crouched beside her, skillfully unloading the breech cartridge and hanging the rifle by his side with a similar proud look on his face. Along the same range, other soldiers and recruits from the old Ajloun Brigade scored similar shots on their targets. In the distance, Golden could hear the reverberating chants of soldiers marching in synchronized steps; their guns hung ready on their shoulders.\n\nThis is what an army should be, she thought. Even if the days of disorganized militias were past, their legacy and experience would still carry on the torch of the nation in battles henceforth. Even so, her thoughts lingered in doubt.\n\nWill it be enough? The enemy was vast and would no doubt outnumber them and their smaller army...\n\n“Marshal Golden!”\n\nTurning to the source of the sound, she saw that all the recruits had finished taking their shots at the targets. Perfect scores, all of them.\n\n“Good shooting, recruits! Keep working this hard and you will be ready for any battle! Now...give me ten laps around the ground in half an hour!” she bellowed.\n\nIt will have to be enough..."
aestlonia.7.a:0 "Professionals have standards."
aestlonia.8.t:0 "Meeting With Raud"
aestlonia.8.d:0 "##TODO, event about Zaida meeting with the leader of the national workers union, Steel Raud, and thanking her for the help she's providing for the war effort against Karkad in the way of some miner militias. Raud doesn't talk much, she is pretty cryptic and silent, also slightly imposing due to her size, but in the end it's clear Raud likes Zaida and wishes to work together with her in the future. Even joining the army as a general"
aestlonia.8.a:0 "Friendship sure is great."
aestlonia.9.t:0 "An Encounter to Remember"
aestlonia.9.d:0 "##TODO, event about a pony from the western tribe (estonian-speaking) meeting a pony from the central tribe (more standard uralic language speaker). At first they have a lot of trouble communicating, so instead they decide to use the snow and a stick to draw little pictures to communicate with one another. By the end of it they know they're going to be big friends, even if they don't understand a word of what the other is saying."
aestlonia.9.a:0 "A friendship that surpasses barriers."
aestlonia.10.t:0 "A New Page"
aestlonia.10.d:0 "##TODO, event about Zaida renaming the states and cities of Ajloun and Zarmarej to something that better represents the Aestlonian culture. As she writes down the edict that will officialy change the names Winter Qalam hovers over her shoulder, reassuring her that she's doing the right thing and that he will support her no matter what. She also changes another name, her own. But instead of getting rid of Zaida she simply gives herself a new surname. One that Qalam references in the option of the event."
aestlonia.10.a:0 ""Or, as I should say. Princess Zaida Lumesadu.""
aestlonia.11.t:0 "Course Selection"
aestlonia.11.d:0 "With every piece of objective information at hoof and after receiving every possible advice, Princess Zaida had to chart the future course of the realm once more. The attack was coming, and without a reliable plan it would crush Aestlonia in a matter of weeks.\n\nThe sensible option, of course, was to stick with the proven loyalists, TBT or AGWU. By putting the international connections of the former or the popular support of the latter to the forefront of the preparation campaign, reasonable progress could be achieved in the remaining time. Still, what if reasonable was not enough?\n\nA tinge of fear, a speck of desperation, maybe even a shade of dark ambition highlighted another possibility. The cultists of Millenary Path were more than capable fighters, and without the National Unity Act they were turning against the state once more, putting even more pressure on the overextended army. This situation could be reversed, new negotiations initiated, starting a risky bargain with a steep price of success and failure alike."
aestlonia.11.a:0 "This land will not give in to any evil."
aestlonia.11.b:0 "The salvation is worth the cost."
aestlonia.12.t:0 "Things Unsaid"
aestlonia.12.d:0 ""I trust your journey to the capital went well." Despite the softness of palace armchairs, Zaida struggled to sit comfortably. "It is quite appreciated that you were able to do it on such short notice."\n\nA barely visible head motion, which could be counted as a nod only under the most generous interpretation, was the only answer.\n\n"Well. To business then." Glancing to the sides, the princess shifted forward slightly. "I was told that you have brought a final draft of the pertinent agreement?"\n\nThere was a ringing noise of clasp removed, a rustle of paper sheets and finally a soft knock on the table as the documents were placed in front of Zaida. As per the many legal lessons from her younger days, she took time reading every word and measuring their dark implications. Unfortunately, this was exactly the list of measures necessary to save Aestlonia.\n\n"It goes without saying that we expect a very strict reading of the text." She tried to sound assertive. "Millenary Path shall act civilized, exactly as it portrays itself to the outside world, and never as a harmful sect." Since there was no indication of any interruption or comment, Zaida pushed on. "There is also the matter of the ending clause. You and your people need to understand that most of these privileges will be withdrawn after the war, subject to royal review depending on the past circumstances."\n\nStorm Alsaqie remained frozenly still."
aestlonia.12.a:0 "Silence was consent."
aestlonia.13.t:0 "Aestlonia Demands our Surrender"
aestlonia.13.d:0 "##TODO, event where Aestlonia demands the returnal of their lands from Karkad after capturing the states, also asking them to return the Maretonian lands to Maretonia in exchange for peace, this is an event Karkad gets, and, it's down the path where Aestlonia waited to be attacked, instead of attacking first."

aestlonia.15.t:0 "Kabja Returns from Arabia"
aestlonia.15.d:0 "##TODO, event about the cultist Vastik Kabja returning from his little "volunteer action" in the Arabian civil war on the side of the National Salvation Government. There's some signs he did it as a way to get some "ancient Arab glory", not really caring about what would happen to the people living there. The army is keeping an eye on him as he's considered dangerous due to his infamy as the "Butcher of Badimane", this title being a new one he got recently during said civil war, and the reason he was basically "kicked out" of Arabia and forced to return to Aestlonia."
aestlonia.15.a:0 "Keep an eye on that one."
aestlonia.16.t:0 "Victory!"
aestlonia.16.d:0 "##TODO, we won over Karkad, and now can get on with our political ambitions."

aestlonia.17.d:0 "##TODO, (EQS POV), event that Equestria receives, in this one it talks about Aestlonian diplomats arriving in Equestria and politely asking for material or volunteer support for their conflict with Karkad."

aestlonia.19.a:0 "Unfortunate."
aestlonia.20.t:0 "Cultists Threaten to Attack Zarmarej!"
aestlonia.20.d:0 "##TODO, event about Millenary Path cultists Threatening to attack the city of Zarmarej a few days after Zaida abolishes the National Unity Act, it clearly being a direct response to it and a way of revenge by the part of the cultists, since now their control over the governance has been compromised. But, not only that, with the Act gone they also aren't obligated to follow the agreements of the Act, one being they would stop the attacks on cities. They seem to be holding back from the attack for now. Likely waiting for some sort of deal."
aestlonia.20.a:0 "Someone has to stop these maniacs! Defend the city!"
aestlonia.20.b:0 "Offer them concessions!"
aestlonia.21.t:0 "Cultist Protest Over Development"
aestlonia.21.d:0 "##TODO, event about the cultist complaining about the government's effort to build infrastructure over areas of the Aestlonian wilderness. The cultists say this interferes with their way of life and that the government must do something to make it right, this basically being the cultists asking for money and more power."
aestlonia.21.a:0 "We don't negotiate with the likes of them anymore."
aestlonia.21.b:0 "If it keeps them quiet."
aestlonia.22.t:0 "Consequences"
aestlonia.22.d:0 "##TODO, event about the Aestlonian economy crashing after the war with Karkad has finished, with the over-militarization falling over itself as the war concluded, not only that but politics are now more unstable than ever as without the war to keep the political factions busy they're now demanding changes."
aestlonia.22.a:0 "Can we talk this out?"
aestlonia.23.t:0 "War Looming!"
aestlonia.23.d:0 "##TODO, (AES or MTO POV) Karkad is going to invade soon! What do we do?"

aestlonia.24.t:0 "The Weirdest Meeting"
aestlonia.24.d:0 "##TODO, event about Zaida meeting up with the cultist Vastik Kabja to see about him offering his services in the Karkad war. Zaida feels really intimidated by the cultist and expects the worst, (specially due to his recent fame as the Butcher of Badimane) even though she's in a secure location surrounded by loyal soldiers that could come help her if something goes south in the room. Funnily enough the cultist doesn't seem very aggressive at all, he's even somewhat polite to Zaida and points out that they have something in common, that being their arabic blood, therefore he respects her in that way. It's still clear he's not a good guy by any means, but it does show that even evil can be pleasent."

The field marshal of Aestlonia, Golden Sayif, is also present. Said marshal had the plan to shoot Snowstorm with her revolver, not caring if Zaida likes it or not. But she's left completely dumbfounded as even some of her own troops start cheering Snowstorm on and stomping their hooves in animosity after the end of her speech. Making her completely forget about the assassination idea."

aestlonia.29.d:0 "##TODO, event where Winter Qalam, Zaida and Steel Raud are present, Winter and Steel being in either side of Zaida, with the princess right in the middle. The speech goes from Winter, to Raud, before ending with Zaida's part.

aestlonia.30.d:0 "##TODO, a group of armed ponies have arrived at the port in our capital.

This, however, didn't come without some consequences. The decently sized Arab community within the nation feels uncertain about the future, most are willing to adapt to whatever is decided by the government, even if it means having to slowly let go of their old culture, but no real decision was made about their fate. They feel like they're in a state of limbo, like they're simply being ignored, like they never even existed. It's apparent that they just want some clear directions from the government about it's stance and what lies ahead."

This, however, doesn't mean the elections will happen right away, instead she promises to allow elections when she believes the country, situation and it's people are stable enough to be able to survive such an election.

aestloniacoup.2.d:0 "##TODO, event about a new party being declared, this party being the MRS, the Maregyptian Revival Society. Their leader is the ex-businessmare known as Alter Tähenduses. The mare once was a very important figure within the nation at a time in it's history. Being part of the Financial Center and helping to build much of Aestlonia's economy, later she would be disconnected from the Center due to some corporate drama. People find it weird how this party popped up mere days after the operation against the cultists and Storm's disappearance. A considerable amount of our allies having the suspicion that this might be some kind of front for the cultists who are trying to rebrand.

The TBT still denounces the coup, but are willing to work in the new system as Zaida's actions during the Karkad war are hard to fully defend. Snow Qalam, Winter's sister, takes inspiration from many arab republican movements, as well as Equestria's system and ideas about harmony and friendship.

Her ex-slave backstory inspired many to throw their support behind her, including Raud herself who always saw the zebra as her number 2."

She knows she doesn't have much time to organize or to prepare for them, and she can't delay them either or she would basically be asking for a popular revolt. But, even then, she still has a limited amount of time where she could give a bit of a help to one of the parties to aid them in winning the upcoming elections if she chooses to do so.

Zaida turns down the offer, saying that she has no wishes to take the country by force, even saying that she recognizes that what she did was a mistake. She tells Royal to accept the winds of change and try to make the country work, instead of attempting to work against it. She even jokes by commanding him to do so, like she is still a princess."

Others, the more moderate ones, say that it might not be a native culture, but it still should be preserved as Aestlonia isn't like Saddle Arabia and shouldn't try to suppress any cultures, specially considering there are many ponies who now are part of this culture, not only horses.

The other idea is to approach Stalliongrad as even if the coup wasn't communist in nature it still broke with the old order, therefore allowing some political common-ground.

### Character Descs
AES_storm_alsaqie_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 3rd of September 971, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: Despite the recent government efforts to reform the Millenary Path into a proper political force, very little is known about their current leader, Storm Alsaqie. It is understood that she originally came from the capital and became one of the first few city dwellers to be accepted into the group. More macabre rumors claim that the tooth she wears on a necklace belongs to her first sacrifice, a yeti warrior, and that her ascension was paved by scores of other bloody offerings.\n\nAs the guide of the cult, Storm embraced some of the trappings of modernity, actively inducting into the faith those who would be considered outsiders by the traditionally frontier-oriented believers. This, however, should not be mistaken for a change in the brutal nature of Windigo worshippers, but rather viewed as a convenient tool to spread the influence of their morbid masters.\n\nWith successful recruitment of several prominent Aestlonians, Storm somewhat withdrew from the public eye, allowing new disciples to deal with the mundane issues. Stranger still, the preacher is rarely seen by her own followers, and her ice-cold voice joins only a select few ritual chants. Nonetheless, there is no doubt among the initiated regarding her final goal - she shall bring forth the utmost suffering to nourish those who hunger in the dark.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
AES_princess_zaida_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of May 987, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: Destined to become princess from a very young age, Zaida ascended to the Aestlonian throne after the sudden death of her mother. While many of her subjects demonstrated steadfast loyalty to the new ruler, a vocal minority, including a number of skeptics from the royal advisory council, expressed doubts regarding her readiness to wield power over the land.\n\nRejecting the cautious option of assuaging their concerns, Zaida endeavors to take a more proactive and assertive approach to governance. With the survival of the country being the immediate goal, she seeks radical reforms to awaken Aestlonia from its stagnation and secure the future for years to come. Ultimately, her ambition extends to the creation of a united, powerful Hestrayan nation capable of defeating any threats.\n\nOf course, any bold action requires not only willfulness, but also a degree of cunning. By maintaining a harmonious, regal facade and abstaining from bureaucratic or socialite distractions under the guise of utmost diligence, Zaida bides time and builds up strength, determined to surpass her ancestors and show that she is worthy of her title.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Scroup"
AES_winter_qalam_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 3rd of September 962, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!:  A trusted aide of the late Rawiya II and the chosen mentor of young princess Zaida, a prolific writer and a celebrated politician - all these honorifics are carried by a single stallion named Winter Qalam. As the current representative of the "Towards a Better Tomorrow" party (or TBT, for short) within the Aestlonian Advisory Council, he strives to be a pillar of harmony in the country.\n\nThis desire is reflected both in his literary works, which promote a sense of unity between all thinking creatures, as well as in a soft-hooved, measured approach to governance. While he does not inspire the same zealous dedication to a single ideal unlike some leaders, and faces some criticism even within his own faction, notably from the ardent republicans following his sister, Snow Qalam, Winter's non-confrontational methods and developed acumen provide a basis for cooperation across the ideological spectrum.\n\nIt is worth noting that his moral code is intertwined with and supported by devout belief in Dualism. Along with fellow adherents of this religious movement, Winter seeks to promote the core tenets of Charity and Brotherhood in the everyday lives of those around him, viewing these principles as means to ward off not only the evil in one's soul, but also the tangible threat of Windigos.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
AES_golden_sayif_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of Novemeber 979, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: A fierce protector of Aestlonia from threats internal and external alike, field marshal Golden Sayif has not chosen the warrior's lot, but followed it with unbreakable determination. As a young filly, she lost her parents in a windigo cultist attack, surviving due to the timely intervention of a militia squad. The veteran officer in command chose to adopt the orphan, raising her in strict discipline and sharing his own values of honor and duty.\n\nWith this upbringing, the military became a second family to Golden, the only one she truly knew. After formally joining the ranks, she demonstrated impressive prowess and strong leadership skills, quickly climbing the hierarchy of the nascent Aestlonian army. Her resolute ways, pointed political neutrality and hard-earned trust of fellow soldiers made her a natural fit for the commanding position.\n\nHowever, her career only emboldened the deep-seated hatred she had for those who destroyed her life and continued to threaten her homeland. Despite the National Unity Act allowing the so-called Millenary Path to formally participate in governance, Golden watches every move of the cultists even more intensely then before, ready to beat back their corruption with an unrelenting force. \n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
AES_steel_raud_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of Novemeber 959, Jäised Märed province\n\n§YBiography§!: They say there are few ponies that could portray the essence of Aestlonian worker as well as Steel Raud. \n\nComing from a remote mining village, she toiled underground for the good of the community from a young age. As the years went by, Raud grew to become remarkably strong and tall, easily towering over most others, and she took every opportunity to use her natural gifts to help those weaker or less fortunate.\n\nWhen the mine ran out and was finally closed, the young mare already got herself a bit of a reputation as a local hero, one always ready to provide support, care, and, indeed, physical assistance. Raud traveled from town to town in search of work for several years, never settling in one place, but meeting many like-minded creatures, especially in the rising socialist movements. By demonstrating a certain talent for management, she directed their energy away from singular acts of charity and into a more potent global action.\n\nFollowing the signing of the National Unity Act and formation of the Aestlonian General-Workers Union, Raud, now famous nation-wide, was elected as its director in a landslide victory despite any perceived drawbacks, notably including her pro-monarchy position. Under her continued leadership, the Union has been devoted to protecting and uplifting the workers, successfully improving their treatment and conditions to a notable degree.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Moonatik"
AES_cryo_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: Unknown\n\n§YBiography§!: "Mere creatures cannot begin to fathom the thoughts of an ice dragon."\n\nAccidentally found by Princess Zaida during a caving trip, the ice dragon known as Cryo dismissed the terrified pegasus and allowed her escape with indifference, only for her Highness to return days later with a panicking linguist. The ice dragon slowly learned Aestlonian, and these talks soon gave the Princess the idea for an offer.\n\n"He loves military planning," she told her fearful military officers about their newest lieutenant, "And he'll boost recruitment!"\n\nTo Cryo's credit, his strategies conducted in war exercises would merit promotions, but nopony considered convincing him, out of fear or futility, that his "military planning" was mostly logistic coordination.\n\nBeyond the military, the ice dragon cares little for politics and speaks even less of his homeland. One occasion a brave-enough subordinate asked what other ice dragons were like, and Cryo huffed. "I had horns," he snarled icily.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Littlepudel"
AES_alter_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 1st of August 954, Manehattan\n\n§YBiography§!: Born in the bustling city of Manehattan to a corporate family, initially found some success as a businessmare. However, her money-hungry mentality and disingenuous demeanor quickly alienated her from other business owners and locals. Frustrated by what she deemed "bleeding-heart sentimentalists," Alter decided to relocate to a place where she could operate without such interference.\n\nShe set her sights on Aestlonia, believing that the relatively young nation would offer an easier market to dominate due to its presumably underdeveloped regulations and worker rights. Upon arrival, however, Alter found Aestlonia's economy to be even more primitive than she had anticipated. Determined to shape the economic landscape to her advantage, she founded the Kapitali Finance Center and collaborated directly with Rawiya II to develop a cohesive economic system for Aestlonia. Many even credit her with the establishment of the central bank.\n\nDespite her initial success, Alter's fortunes took a downturn when she was recently disconnected from the finance center she helped create amid suspicions of fund appropriation for her personal projects. Though she has not publicly reacted to this setback, those who know her well understand that she isn't one to be easily defeated.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"

AES_neutrality_party_long:0 "Marginalized Groups     §gAestlonia never truly had a more "aristocratic" force in politics, at least not in it's modern history. This leaves the more neutral-leaning elements to not have any real representation within the government. The best "leader" for this group would end up being the army due to their historical commitment to neutrality.§!"
AES_communism_party:0 "AGWU"
AES_communism_party_long:0 "Aestlonian General-Workers Union     §gThe AGWU is Aestlonia's first attempt at moderate socialism. The "party" serves as a state-sponsored workers union. The Union itself was created by the previous princess as a way to appease the hard workers of the nation, as without their sacrifices this icy realm wouldn't have gotten anywhere. The AGWU's leader, Steel Raud, is one of the major supporters of Zaida outside of the TBT. Believing the princess should continue the monarcho-socialist experiment started by her mother.§!"
AES_democratic_party:0 "TBT"
AES_democratic_party_long:0 "Towards a Better Tomorrow     §gThe TBT is compromised of historical supporter of the Aestlonian monarchy. Being formed by harmonic-leaning intellectuals and political masters who were given a proper party as an effect of the Unity Act. Their leader, Winter Qalam, pratically serves as Zaida's second-in-command, even being responsible for helping raise the princess in her formative years. Even though the party is majoritarily monarchist, there are certain republican elements within it, these elements being led by the leader's sister, Snow Qalam. Even with this soft split, the party's goals still are to mantain the harmonic order in the Aestlonian realm, no matter in what shape.§!"
AES_fascism_party:0 "The Millenary Path"
AES_fascism_party_long:0 "The Millenary Path     §gThe Millenary Path is a fervent and controversial group of ponies who view their ancestors' exodus from Maregypt to Aestlonia as a holy event, believing that the icy spirits known as the Windigos bestowed the cold of Aestlonia upon them as a divine gift. These cultists worship the Windigos and believe that the spirits' presence and strength grow with desolation and suffering. As a result, they have historically engaged in violent acts, including village attacks, terrorism, and sacrifices, aiming to invoke the Windigos' power. Their activities have made them a feared and despised faction within Aestlonia, confined mostly to rural areas and, controversially, granted government representation in a bid for peace.§!"
AES_agwu_hestraya_updated:0 "HGWU"
AES_agwu_hestraya_updated_long:0 "Hestrayan General-Workers Union     §gThe HGWU serves as nothing more than a continuation of the AGWU. One now focused on attempting to get workers from all over Hestraya to join their Union. Their politics remain identical, with Steel Raud, their leader, still being a big supporter of Zaida's rule, only wishing for the princess to more deeply cooperate with the Union.§!"
AES_neutral_army:0 "APA"
AES_neutral_army_long:0 "Aestlonian Provisional Army     §gRecently formed as a way for Aestlonia to protect itself from foreign threats, the Provisional Army, as the name implies, is not a final solution for military issue within the nation. Instead it's a temporary last-minute fix to the issue, this being brought upon due to the Karkadanni threat to the east. The APA is not political in nature, having little interest in ruling the nation in any way. But, their leader, Golden Sayif, has time and time again threatened the cultists of the Millenary Path. It wouldn't be a stretch to say she might react poorly if they are given control over the country.§!"
AES_neutral_hestraya_updated:0 "HNAA"
AES_neutral_hestraya_updated_long:0 "Hestrayan National Army Administration     §gUnlike the APA, the HNAA is a much more proper army to defend Aestlonia and the newly acquired additional Hestrayan territories. Their neutrality regarding politics has remained mostly the same. And so has their hostility towards the cultists.§!"
AES_fascism_hidden:0 "MRS"
AES_fascism_hidden_long:0 "Maregyptian Revival Society     §gThe MRS is a newer party in Aestlonia. One with seemingly no connections to the established political order of the nation. The party prides itself in following the teachings, morals, and culture of the original Maregyptian settlers. Their leader, Alter Tähenduses, is not unknown in the political circle. Once being the founder and head of the Kapitali Finance Center, where she used to work directly with the previous princess before being kicked out of the Center due to suspicions of embezzlement, someone you could hardly call a religious nationalist personality. Due to this, most look to the party with concern, not being fully sure of what it truly represents or who's backing it from behind the shadows.§!"

AES_neutral_coup_long:0 "National Unity Party     §gEven if politically neutral in the past, the Aestlonian Army had to reimagine themselves into something of a political bloc after Golden Sayif launched the "Glorious Coup". The so-called party is nothing more than the political body for the military and Sayif. Their policies being decided by the marshal and her alone.§!"
AES_democratic_republican:0 "TBT-R"
AES_democratic_republican_long:0 "Towards a Better Tomorrow-Republicans     §gThe influence and popularity of the TBT couldn't be killed by a simple coup, and this shows by their newest iteration. Republicans always existed within the party, but after recent events their notoriety has only increased, leading to them and their leader, Snow Qalam, being given majority control over the party. They follow the same harmonic principles of the past, but now with a bigger focus in perfecting harmony as a concept.§!"
AES_communism_republican_long:0 "Aestlonian General-Workers Union     §gAfter Zaida's actions in the Karkdannistan conflict and the following declaration of the republic, the famously monarchist Steel Raud decided it would be best to step down and instead give control of the union to her number 2. That being the zebra known as Amza Outtara, an ex-slave of the Mawzi Empire that found refuge in Aestlonia after the collapse of the same. Her policies are much like Raud's, a very soft approach to socialism, but with a much more "dreamy" way of going about it when compared to Raud's realism.§!"

This was intended to ensure that all factions had a say in the country's governance in exchange for their cooperation.\n\nWhile the Act accelerated Aestlonia's recovery from the war, it now poses an obstacle to further political and economic reforms.

### Preparation tree Events ###
aestlonia.1.t:0 "The Path Forward"
aestlonia.1.d:0 "##TODO, event about how the path forward might be rough and slow, but it's required considering a Karkad invasion is more obvious day by day, the country can't be in a "political deadlock" anymore, Zaida needs to take stuff in her own hooves if she wants change, even if the parties may not like it."
aestlonia.1.a:0 "Something needs to be done."
aestlonia.2.t:0 "To Tartarus With It"
aestlonia.2.d:0 "##TODO, after some preliminary preparations Zaida declare the National Unity Act as null and void, saying it doesn't count anymore due to changing situations in the country, saying that later the political situation will be resolved and discussed, but only after the approaching war with Karkad is over and the situation has stabilized."
aestlonia.2.a:0 "It's for the sake of our survival."
aestlonia.3.t:0 "The Reaction"
aestlonia.3.d:0 "##TODO, event about the different reactions of the parties to Zaida ripping up the act, the harmonic party doesn't like the fact she did it without a proper voting, but they do support the fact it was removed, the communist party, that being the union, fully supports the decision and wishes it had been done sooner, a similar sentiment is shared by the army leadership. The supremacists, being the Millenary Path, react very poorly to the news and announce that they will be doing everything in their power to oppose this decision, fearing that their safety and influence in the government might have it's days counted."
aestlonia.3.a:0 "So be it."
aestlonia.4.t:0 "A Meeting With the Marshal"
aestlonia.4.d:0 "##TODO, event about Golden Sayif laying out a few emergency reforms necessary to the new provisional army and congratulating Zaida for forming it, making a point in saying that Aestlonia doesn't have much time to prepare and that the incoming war probably won't last long, bet it ending on a victory or not, so the princess should be mindful when deciding in what to invest in, as when the war is over it's unlikely the political factions will allow her this much freedom again. Golden also not so subtlety tells Zaida not to work with the cultists."
aestlonia.4.a:0 "Noted."
aestlonia.6.t:0 "Meeting the Newbies"
aestlonia.6.d:0 "##TODO, event about Golden Sayif, the field marshal, meeting the new recruits, they're very badly trained and can barely do anything, leading to Golden having to shout them out to get them to follow her lead and respect her, a smile creeping on her face as they lose all their bravado, she already planning many painful exercises for all of them out in the cold. This event is after the player picks the focus of getting more manpower but at the cost of worse standards."
aestlonia.6.a:0 ""I'm going to have fun "training" you all.""
aestlonia.7.t:0 "An Army to be Proud Of"
aestlonia.7.d:0 "##TODO, event about Golden Sayif, the field marshal, meeting with some professionaly-trained soldiers, she's quite impressed by their form and their knowledge, even if she doesn't really show it. They once being part of the old Ajloun Brigade and everything, something she approves of, as she once helped to lead it. But is a little worried about their small amount, not being sure if this will be enough to beat back Karkad."
aestlonia.7.a:0 "Tricky situation."
aestlonia.8.t:0 "Meeting With Raud"
aestlonia.8.d:0 "##TODO, event about Zaida meeting with the leader of the national workers union, Steel Raud, and thanking her for the help she's providing for the war effort against Karkad in the way of some miner militias. Raud doesn't talk much, she is pretty cryptic and silent, also slightly imposing due to her size, but in the end it's clear Raud likes Zaida and wishes to work together with her in the future. Even joining the army as a general"
aestlonia.8.a:0 "Friendship sure is great."
aestlonia.9.t:0 "An Encounter to Remember"
aestlonia.9.d:0 "##TODO, event about a pony from the western tribe (estonian-speaking) meeting a pony from the central tribe (more standard uralic language speaker). At first they have a lot of trouble communicating, so instead they decide to use the snow and a stick to draw little pictures to communicate with one another. By the end of it they know they're going to be big friends, even if they don't understand a word of what the other is saying."
aestlonia.9.a:0 "A friendship that surpasses barriers."
aestlonia.10.t:0 "A New Page"
aestlonia.10.d:0 "##TODO, event about Zaida renaming the states and cities of Ajloun and Zarmarej to something that better represents the Aestlonian culture. As she writes down the edict that will officialy change the names Winter Qalam hovers over her shoulder, reassuring her that she's doing the right thing and that he will support her no matter what. She also changes another name, her own. But instead of getting rid of Zaida she simply gives herself a new surname. One that Qalam references in the option of the event."
aestlonia.10.a:0 ""Or, as I should say. Princess Zaida Lumesadu.""
aestlonia.11.t:0 "Course Selection"
aestlonia.11.d:0 "##TODO, even about deciding who to cooperate with in the war to come. Either Zaida decides to give the cultists a chance to their knowledge of warfare and battle or she sticks with the harmonists and socialists of the AGWU. It's clear she doesn't want to choose the cultists, but she also believes that their help might be needed to win."
aestlonia.11.a:0 ""I will never work with those savages.""
aestlonia.11.b:0 ""If it's for the good of Aestlonia...""
aestlonia.12.t:0 "A Silent Meeting"
aestlonia.12.d:0 "##TODO, event where Zaida and Storm meet-up to discuss and sign the Lumetorm Pact. Storm doesn't say a single word for the entire encounter, simply just pushes forwards her conditions written down in a piece of paper towards Zaida with her hoof. The princess tries to do small talk and even tell Storm to control her men. But seems like the cult leader is either not listening or just plainly ignoring Zaida. One thing that Zaida does add to the pact is that it will only last until the victory against Karkad"
aestlonia.12.a:0 ""Let's just get this over it.""
aestlonia.13.t:0 "Aestlonia Demands our Surrender"
aestlonia.13.d:0 "##TODO, event where Aestlonia demands the returnal of their lands from Karkad after capturing the states, also asking them to return the Maretonian lands to Maretonia in exchange for peace, this is an event Karkad gets, and, it's down the path where Aestlonia waited to be attacked, instead of attacking first."
aestlonia.13.a:0 "It's our best choice."
aestlonia.13.b:0 "We will never surrender!"
aestlonia.14.t:0 "The Horses Refuse to Surrender"
aestlonia.14.d:0 "##TODO, event about Karkad refusing to surrender."
aestlonia.14.a:0 "Ignorant fools."
aestlonia.15.t:0 "Kabja Returns from Arabia"
aestlonia.15.d:0 "##TODO, event about the cultist Fierce Kabja returning from his little "volunteer action" in the Arabian civil war. It's clear he did it as some form of "sport", not really because he wanted to help any side of the civil war win. The army is keeping an eye on him as he's considered somewhat dangerous due to his infamy as the "Butcher of Äji Syöär" and for being a cultist."
aestlonia.15.a:0 "Keep an eye over that one."
aestlonia.16.t:0 "Victory!"
aestlonia.16.d:0 "##TODO, we won over Karkad, and now can get on with our political ambitions."
aestlonia.16.a:0 "Hooray!"
aestlonia.17.t:0 "Aestlonia Asks for Material Support"
aestlonia.17.d:0 "##TODO, event that Equestria receives, in this one it talks about Aestlonian diplomats arriving in Equestria and politely asking for equipment support for their conflict with Karkad."
aestlonia.17.a:0 "We need to help our fellow ponies."
aestlonia.17.b:0 "We don't have anything to spare."
aestlonia.18.t:0 "Equestria Accepts!"
aestlonia.18.d:0 "##TODO, event about negotiations being a success and Equestria agreeing to send some rifles, support equipment, and even artillery, as well as some minor economic help."
aestlonia.18.a:0 "Celestia saw reason."
aestlonia.19.t:0 "Equestria Denies our Request"
aestlonia.19.d:0 "##TODO, event about Equestria refusing to help, saying they can't spare anything at the moment, specially for a foreign war that does not concern them."
aestlonia.19.a:0 "Unfortunate."
aestlonia.20.t:0 "Cultists Attack Zarmarej!"
aestlonia.20.d:0 "##TODO, event about Millenary Path cultists attacking the city of Zarmarej a few days after Zaida abolishes the National Unity Act, it clearly being a direct response to it and a way of revenge by the part of the cultists, since now their control over the governance has been compromised. But, not only that, with the Act gone they also aren't obligated to follow the agreements of the Act, one being they would stop the attacks on cities."
aestlonia.20.a:0 "Someone has to stop these maniacs! Defend the city!"
aestlonia.20.b:0 "Offer them concessions!"
aestlonia.21.t:0 "Cultist Protest Over Development"
aestlonia.21.d:0 "##TODO, event about the cultist complaining about the government's effort to build infrastructure over areas of the Aestlonian wilderness. The cultists say this interferes with their way of life and that the government must do something to make it right, this basically being the cultists asking for money and more power."
aestlonia.21.a:0 "We don't negotiate with the likes of them anymore."
aestlonia.21.b:0 "If it keeps them quiet."
aestlonia.22.t:0 "Consequences"
aestlonia.22.d:0 "##TODO, event about the Aestlonian economy crashing after the war with Karkad has finished, with the over-militarization falling over itself as the war concluded, not only that but politics are now more unstable than ever as without the war to keep the political factions busy they're now demanding changes."
aestlonia.22.a:0 "Can we talk this out?"
aestlonia.23.t:0 "War Looming!"
aestlonia.23.d:0 "##TODO, (AES or MTO POV) Karkad is going to invade soon! What do we do?"
aestlonia.23.a:0 "Prepare for the worst!"
aestlonia.24.t:0 "The Weirdest Meeting"
aestlonia.24.d:0 "##TODO, event about Zaida going to meet up with the cultist Fierce Kabja. She goes with Winter Qalam and a few army detachments for safety reasons. They meet at the edge of the forest where Kabja is based off of. The conversation starts normal enough with him saying he will help the army with the knowledge he got from fighting in Arabia. But then he quickly starts to try to "charm" Zaida. The princess clearly isn't into it, and after Winter Qalam, the most peace-loving stallion, almost decks Kabja in the face, the meeting is cut a little short."
aestlonia.24.a:0 "Should have stayed in Arabia."
aestlonia.25.t:0 "Meet Your New Battlebuddies"
aestlonia.25.d:0 "##TODO, event about a city-folk army stallion being sent to train about wilderness survival with a couple of cultists. They bully and make fun of him very hard due to his lack of knowledge about anything relating to surviving in the wild."
aestlonia.25.a:0 "I don't like these ponies."
aestlonia.26.t:0 "A Worrisome Display"
aestlonia.26.d:0 "##TODO, event where the cultist called Snowstorm does a speech infront of an audience of many other cultists. But, this audience is mostly compromised of regular army ponies. The field marshal of Aestlonia, Golden Sayif, is also present. Said marshal had the plan to shoot Snowstorm with her revolver, not caring if Zaida likes it or not. But she's left completely dumbfounded as even some of her own troops start cheering Snowstorm on and stomping their hooves in animosity after the end of her speech. Making her completely forget about the assassination idea."
aestlonia.26.a:0 "I didn't think it had gotten this bad."
aestlonia.27.t:0 "Choosing a Favorite"
aestlonia.27.d:0 "##TODO, Event after the focus about deciding to ally the cultists. In here she refused to do so and is now deciding on who she should ally with. Having the options of going with her government and support base of the TBT or going with the miners and the union members of the AGWU."
aestlonia.27.a:0 ""The TBT hasn't done me wrong yet.""
aestlonia.27.b:0 ""The workers need their princess.""
aestlonia.28.t:0 "Meeting With the Guard"
aestlonia.28.d:0 "##TODO, event where Zaida meets up with the newly deployed royal guards. They don't say a word as she walks down the hallway observing how many ponies are willing to fight and die for her. This causing her to get a little emotional, giving them an umprompted and unprepared little happy emotional speech about how they are going to win this."
aestlonia.28.a:0 "For Zaida!"
aestlonia.29.t:0 "The Nonpartisan Speech"
aestlonia.29.d:0 "##TODO, event where Winter Qalam, Zaida and Steel Raud are present, Winter and Steel being in either side of Zaida, with the princess right in the middle. The speech goes from Winter, to Raud, before ending with Zaida's part. The speech is all about how Aestlonia will and has to win this war, about how party-alliance doesn't matter at this crucial moment and how there is a real need to show Karkad what we're made of."
aestlonia.29.a:0 "For Aestlonia!"

### Mid-game tree events ####
aestloniamidgame.1.t:0 "Limited Time"
aestloniamidgame.1.d:0 "##TODO, event about Zaida realizing she has to act quickly if she wishes to remain in power, or at least make sure that her most preferable group is able to come to power if she's forced to depart. Her popularity being clearly a bit damaged from the economic crash and the political chaos, needing to be recovered, or else. Some even are suggesting a republican system due to this."
aestloniamidgame.1.a:0 "There's much to be done."
aestloniamidgame.2.t:0 "The House of Cards"
aestloniamidgame.2.d:0 "##TODO, event about how the political system in Aestlonia is shaky at best after the war with Karkad and the abolishing of the national unity act, with this in mind Zaida needs to be careful about who she gives most influence, as this will certainly matter when it comes to the future of the nation, as the most popular party would be able to force her to step down if they wished to, or could even force her to change the way she governs. Therefore, she needs to be mindful with her future decisions and sacrifices, as any decision might also result in negative reactions from the not-helped factions in the future."
aestloniamidgame.2.a:0 "Aestlonia hangs in the balance."
aestloniamidgame.3.t:0 "Meeting With The Marshal"
aestloniamidgame.3.d:0 "##TODO, event about Golden Sayif asking for increased funding to the army from Zaida to deal with the cultists."

aestloniamidgame.3.c:0 ""I was actually planning to defund it.""
aestloniamidgame.4.t:0 "The Qalam Siblings"
aestloniamidgame.4.d:0 "##TODO, event about Zaida paying a visit to Winter Qalam and his sister Snow Qalam, Snow being a bit more of a republican, but both being interested in helping Zaida stay in charge. although the topic of she stepping down, and the topic of a republic do come up, with Snow even suggesting to Zaida that if she wishes to stabilize her rule she should think about cooperating with the National Union (communists). Suggesting to her to maybe open up a new factory for them to deal with some of the unemployement of the nation, being a sign of good faith towards the workers."
aestloniamidgame.4.a:0 ""I rather stick to my allies.""
aestloniamidgame.4.b:0 ""A little socialism couldn't hurt.""
aestloniamidgame.4.c:0 ""You two are trying to influence me!""
aestloniamidgame.5.t:0 "Meeting With Alter"
aestloniamidgame.5.d:0 "##TODO, event where Zaida goes to meet with the leader of the "new" FNP party (check aestloniamidgame.31 for context). The meeting is quite different, Alter is super nice during all of it, sometimes even praising Zaida and saying how much she wants Aestlonia and later Hestraya to be happy. But, even though her words are very sweet, her demeanor and tone say otherwise. Almost like her gentle words are meant to say something else, something not too nice. The event would conclude with Alter asking Zaida for some political support/official promoting of the party."
aestloniamidgame.5.a:0 ""I will pass on your offer.""
aestloniamidgame.5.b:0 ""You seem nice enough.""
aestloniamidgame.6.t:0 "Union Gig"
aestloniamidgame.6.d:0 "##TODO, meeting between Zaida and the leader of the A.G.W.U, Steel Raud, Raud is receptive to the idea of working with Zaida in the future, but does ask if she could help the union set up a factory in a state that needs it (it's a randomly selected state)."
aestloniamidgame.6.a:0 ""I can't spare the factory, but, let's cooperate.""
aestloniamidgame.6.b:0 ""Your request will be met.""
aestloniamidgame.6.c:0 ""Do I look like a communist to you?""
aestloniamidgame.7.t:0 "Our Standing"
aestloniamidgame.7.d:0 "##TODO, event about Zaida deciding what party and ideology to give some more power to. This only being a temporary measure that would last until the nation has stabilized."
aestloniamidgame.7.a:0 "Aestlonia stands for harmony."
aestloniamidgame.7.b:0 "Aestlonia stands for the worker."

aestloniamidgame.12.t:0 "Maretonia Makes Demands"
aestloniamidgame.12.d:0 "##TODO, Maretonia accepts integration, but asks for investments into their lands if they do agree."

### Leader Descs
AES_storm_alsaqie_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 3rd of September 971, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: Not much is known about Storm Alsaqie's early life, except that she was once an Ajloun native and became one of the first outsiders to join the Millenary Path cult. Legend has it that the tooth she wears on a necklace is from a yeti she killed to prove herself to the group. Her rise to power was swift, and few know what became of the previous leader. Those who might have the courage or curiosity to investigate have chosen not to. Under her leadership, the cult, which was waning in activity due to the National Unity Act, has been revitalized with a fervor unseen since its ancient founding. There are even whispers that she has revived the group's horrific tradition of sacrificing defenseless villagers.\n\nStorm has also opened the cult's doors to more outsiders, but this should not be mistaken for a liberalization of its practices. She has maintained the cult's brutal nature, simply seeking new recruits to expand its influence within Aestlonia. Her aim is to instill absolute misery in the nation, feeding the icy spirits of death and disgrace known as the Windigo.\n\nThe preacher is known for her emotionless demeanor and completely monotone voice, a voice rarely heard even by members of the Millenary Path, reserved for only the most special occasions. Despite her reticence, her goal is clear: to bring about the utmost suffering to nourish the Windigos.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
AES_princess_zaida_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of May 987, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: Born into the Aestlonian royal family, Zaida ascended to the throne at a young age following the unexpected death of her mother. Soon after, she faced skepticism from the advisory council, who doubted her readiness due to her age and strong personality. To calm these doubts, Zaida endeavored to tailor a harmonious, regal facade, though it is clear that she feels constrained by the expectations and pressures placed upon her.\n\nZaida's true desires lie in breaking free from these constraints to take a more proactive and assertive approach to governance. She frequently expresses frustration with the country's stagnant state, advocating for immediate change to ensure Aestlonia's survival in modern times. Her vision includes expanding and securing the nation's surroundings, even proposing a united Hestrayan nation to achieve these goals. This ambitious stance has earned her a reputation as an expansionist war hawk, but Zaida remains undeterred by critics, firmly believing that bold action is necessary.\n\nBeneath her polite exterior, Zaida's strong personality sometimes surfaces in snarky and even insulting remarks when faced with obstacles. She is visibly unhappy with the bureaucracy and elite social events that she perceives as distractions from her true purpose. Zaida is determined to prove herself as a capable ruler, not merely a figurehead bound by her bloodline, but a leader who can surpass her ancestors and truly deserve her title.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Scroup"
AES_winter_qalam_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 3rd of September 962, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: Winter Qalam, the brother of Snow Qalam, serves as the current representative of the "Towards a Better Tomorrow" (T.B.T) party within the Aestlonian Advisory Council. Known for his calm and gentle nature, Winter adopts a non-confrontational approach to addressing issues, earning him respect and admiration across the political spectrum. His role in preparing and guiding Zaida for her eventual ascension to the throne, during her mother's illness, further solidified his reputation as a trusted and compassionate leader.

AES_golden_sayif_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of Novemeber 979, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: Golden Sayif, lost her parents in a cultist attack as a young filly, surviving thanks to the timely intervention of the Aestlonian army. Found hiding in her family's home, she was rescued and subsequently adopted by one of the officers, who refused to leave her to fend for herself. From that moment on, Sayif was raised in a highly militaristic environment, where discipline and honor were paramount. She grew to deeply respect the military system, considering the officer and the entire armed forces as her second family—the only one she truly knew.\n\nRaised with a strict regimen, Golden developed impressive skills, leadership qualities, and an unbreakable determination. Her dedication and prowess allowed her to rise quickly through the ranks of the Aestlonian army, eventually earning her the esteemed title of field marshal. Her upbringing also emboldened the deep-seated hatred she had for the cultists who had destroyed her family and continued to threaten her homeland. This animosity was further inflamed when the National Unity Act was passed, allowing the cultists of the Millenary Path to participate in governance.\n\nGolden's desire for vengeance against the cultists is intense, with many believing her sole wish is to personally strangle their leader, Storm Alsaqie, with her bare hooves. Her anger and resentment drive her to excel in her military career, constantly pushing herself to be the best and to protect Aestlonia from any further harm caused by the cultists.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
AES_steel_raud_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of Novemeber 959, Jäised Märed province\n\n§YBiography§!: Born in a small mining village, she spent her early years working in the mines to support her community. Like all capable ponies in her village, she toiled underground, contributing to the collective well-being. Growing up, Raud became an imposing figure, towering over most others and possessing remarkable strength, even surpassing many stallions. However, her formidable appearance belied her true nature.\n\nKnown for her compassion and empathy, Raud was always dedicated to helping the weaker members of her community. She consistently provided for those who couldn't provide for themselves, earning a reputation as a local hero through her charitable acts. This pattern of care and support continued as she traveled from town to town in search of work, spreading her influence and goodwill wherever she went.\n\nWhen the state-run "Aestlonian General-Worker's Union" was established following the signing of the National Unity Act, the question of leadership arose. Steel Raud was chosen as the director of the Union due to her local fame and commanding presence. Her reputation and stature were seen as valuable assets in negotiating with corporate leaders and advocating for necessary reforms. Under her leadership, the Union aims to protect and uplift the workers, ensuring fair treatment and better working conditions across Aestlonia.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Moonatik"
AES_cryo_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: Unknown\n\n§YBiography§!: "Mere creatures cannot begin to fathom the thoughts of an ice dragon."\n\nAccidentally found by Princess Zaida during a caving trip, the ice dragon known as Cryo dismissed the terrified pegasus and allowed her escape with indifference, only for her Highness to return days later with a panicking linguist. The ice dragon slowly learned Aestlonian, and these talks soon gave the Princess the idea for an offer.\n\n"He loves military planning," she told her fearful military officers about their newest lieutenant, "And he'll boost recruitment!"\n\nTo Cryo's credit, his strategies conducted in war exercises would merit promotions, but nopony considered convincing him, out of fear or futility, that his "military planning" was mostly logistic coordination.\n\nBeyond the military, the ice dragon cares little for politics and speaks even less of his homeland. One occasion a brave-enough subordinate asked what other ice dragons were like, and Cryo huffed. "I had horns," he snarled icily.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Littlepudel"

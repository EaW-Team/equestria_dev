AES_storm_alsaqie_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 3rd of September 971, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: An Ajloun native, always felt a sense of detachment from the safety and serenity of her hometown. Her fascination lay with the enigmatic and perilous Windigo cult known as the Millenary Path. Despite warnings about their brutality and dark nature, Storm believed the tales were exaggerated, getting drawn to the group's aura of danger, mysticism, and action.\n\nWhen Ajloun and the entirety of Aestlonia faced an attack from the armies of the Storm King, Storm saw an opportunity. She ventured through the snowy forests to contact the cult, only to be dismissed immediately. The cultists doubted her capabilities, viewing her as a sheltered city-dweller unfit for their harsh lifestyle and mission.\n\nDetermined to prove her worth, Storm returned the next day with the tooth of a Yeti she had slain, an extraordinary feat that earned her acceptance. Rising swiftly through the ranks, she eventually took over leadership after the elder "Preacher" passed away. Storm now leads with a similar fierce and ruthless approach, revitalizing the cult and restoring its ancient vigor.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
AES_princess_zaida_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of May 987, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: Born into the Aestlonian royal family, Zaida ascended to the throne at a young age following the unexpected death of her mother. Soon after, she faced skepticism from the advisory council, who doubted her readiness due to her age and strong personality. To calm these doubts, Zaida endeavored to tailor a harmonious, regal facade, though it is clear that she feels constrained by the expectations and pressures placed upon her.\n\nZaida's true desires lie in breaking free from these constraints to take a more proactive and assertive approach to governance. She frequently expresses frustration with the country's stagnant state, advocating for immediate change to ensure Aestlonia's survival in modern times. Her vision includes expanding and securing the nation's surroundings, even proposing a united Hestrayan nation to achieve these goals. This ambitious stance has earned her a reputation as an expansionist war hawk, but Zaida remains undeterred by critics, firmly believing that bold action is necessary.\n\nBeneath her polite exterior, Zaida's strong personality sometimes surfaces in snarky and even insulting remarks when faced with obstacles. She is visibly unhappy with the bureaucracy and elite social events that she perceives as distractions from her true purpose. Zaida is determined to prove herself as a capable ruler, not merely a figurehead bound by her bloodline, but a leader who can surpass her ancestors and truly deserve her title.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Scroup"
AES_winter_qalam_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 3rd of September 962, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: Winter Qalam, the brother of Snow Qalam, serves as the current representative of the "Towards a Better Tomorrow" (T.B.T) party within the Aestlonian Advisory Council. Known for his calm and gentle nature, Winter adopts a non-confrontational approach to addressing issues, earning him respect and admiration across the political spectrum. His role in preparing and guiding Zaida for her eventual ascension to the throne, during her mother's illness, further solidified his reputation as a trusted and compassionate leader. Rawiya II recognized his invaluable support by appointing him as the leader of the T.B.T party, entrusting him to aid her daughter's rule in the years to come.\n\nWinter is also a celebrated writer in Aestlonia, renowned for his harmony-supporting literary works. His writings and political acumen have significantly contributed to the crafting of many modern laws, demonstrating his deep understanding of politics and bureaucratic processes. His efficiency and knowledge in navigating the complexities of governance have made him a pivotal figure in Aestlonian politics.\n\nA devout follower of Trifectism, Winter believes in the tenets of Charity, Empathy, and Brotherhood. As a major member of the Trifectism movement, he advocates living a fulfilling life through these principles, which he and his fellow adherents view as a means to ward off the Windigos. His dedication to these ideals is evident in both his personal and professional life, as he strives to foster a sense of unity and support within the community, aligning his political work with his philosophical beliefs.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
AES_golden_sayif_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of Novemeber 979, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: Golden Sayif, lost her parents in a cultist attack as a young filly, surviving thanks to the timely intervention of the Aestlonian army. Found hiding in her family's home, she was rescued and subsequently adopted by one of the officers, who refused to leave her to fend for herself. From that moment on, Sayif was raised in a highly militaristic environment, where discipline and honor were paramount. She grew to deeply respect the military system, considering the officer and the entire armed forces as her second family—the only one she truly knew.\n\nRaised with a strict regimen, Golden developed impressive skills, leadership qualities, and an unbreakable determination. Her dedication and prowess allowed her to rise quickly through the ranks of the Aestlonian army, eventually earning her the esteemed title of field marshal. Her upbringing also emboldened the deep-seated hatred she had for the cultists who had destroyed her family and continued to threaten her homeland. This animosity was further inflamed when the National Unity Act was passed, allowing the cultists of the Millenary Path to participate in governance.\n\nGolden's desire for vengeance against the cultists is intense, with many believing her sole wish is to personally strangle their leader, Storm Alsaqie, with her bare hooves. Her anger and resentment drive her to excel in her military career, constantly pushing herself to be the best and to protect Aestlonia from any further harm caused by the cultists.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
AES_steel_raud_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of Novemeber 959, Wasit province\n\n§YBiography§!: Born in a small mining village in Wasit province, she spent her early years working in the mines to support her community. Like all capable ponies in her village, she toiled underground, contributing to the collective well-being. Growing up, Raud became an imposing figure, towering over most others and possessing remarkable strength, even surpassing many stallions. However, her formidable appearance belied her true nature.\n\nKnown for her compassion and empathy, Raud was always dedicated to helping the weaker members of her community. She consistently provided for those who couldn't provide for themselves, earning a reputation as a local hero through her charitable acts. This pattern of care and support continued as she traveled from town to town in search of work, spreading her influence and goodwill wherever she went.\n\nWhen the state-run "Aestlonian General-Worker's Union" was established following the signing of the National Unity Act, the question of leadership arose. Steel Raud was chosen as the director of the Union due to her local fame and commanding presence. Her reputation and stature were seen as valuable assets in negotiating with corporate leaders and advocating for necessary reforms.

The ice dragon slowly learned Aestlonian, and these talks soon gave the Princess the idea for an offer.\n\n"He loves military planning," she told her fearful military officers about their newest lieutenant, "And he'll boost recruitment!"\n\nTo Cryo's credit, his strategies conducted in war exercises would merit promotions, but nopony considered convincing him, out of fear or futility, that his "military planning" was mostly logistic coordination.\n\nBeyond the military, the ice dragon cares little for politics and speaks even less of his homeland. One occasion a brave-enough subordinate asked what other ice dragons were like, and Cryo huffed. "I had horns," he snarled icily.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Littlepudel"

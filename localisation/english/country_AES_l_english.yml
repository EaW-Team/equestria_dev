### Ideas ###
AES_unity_act_spirit:0 "National Unity Act"
AES_unity_act_spirit_desc:0 "The National Unity Act was signed after the tumultuous period of the Storm King and subsequent Karkadannistan invasions of Aestlonia. Its primary goal was to unite the country and facilitate its reconstruction. To achieve this, the Act formalized proper political parties, while also granting representation and power to the Millenary Path. This was intended to ensure that all factions had a say in the country's governance in exchange for their cooperation.\n\nWhile the Act accelerated Aestlonia's recovery from the war, it now poses an obstacle to further political and economic reforms. The structure it established has led to a perpetual political standstill, as parties rarely reach full agreement on any reform."
AES_aestlonia_identity:0 "Aestlonian Identity"
AES_aestlonia_identity_desc:0 "From the great migration, to the wrath of the cultists, the rule of the Arabians and now independence. Our great nation has endured a lot. With carefully planned reforms and programs, a new wave of nationalistic fervor has risen amongst our people who identify first as Aestlonian."
AES_ajloun_batallion:0 "Legacy of the Ajloun Brigade"
AES_ajloun_batallion_desc:0 "Formed in the sixth century after the formation of the Governorate of Hestraya, the Ajloun Brigade were a reaction to the resurgence of cultist attacks upon the civilian population of the region. While one out of many such groups, it was the most well known and has a rich and storied history of protecting the weak; something that it carries out even to this day.\n\nHowever, as much as it has been a boon to the people, the archaic organization of such groups cannot stand against the armies of nations today. While how far should our modernization efforts go remains in question, no one can doubt that the current militias are very much out of date."
AES_equipment_bad_standards:0 "Lowered Production Standards"
AES_equipment_bad_standards_desc:0 "The quality of our products are being lessened, in the hopes of keeping pace with our military's needs and requirements. While not as lethal as they should be, the weapons produced are still no less deadly."
AES_equipment_bad_standards_v2:0 "Optimized System"
AES_equipment_bad_standards_v2_desc:0 "Our factories have worked tirelessly, managing to work out a system to efficiently hammer out equipment without compromising on its quality and still delivering on time."
AES_production_complex_idea:0 "National Production Complex"
AES_production_complex_idea_desc:0 "With the choice of focusing over an organized industrial basis that produces high quality weaponry, the guilds of our nation are steadily transformed into a production complex that fulfills the needs of our army. Grey smoke stacks fill the skylines of the capital in contrast to the blue-white panorama of our winters, and factories aplenty churn out the tools to protect our sovereignty; with more being built on the horizon."
AES_production_complex_idea_v2:0 "The Fires of Industry"
AES_production_complex_idea_v2_desc:0 "With sufficient coordination, planning and provisions from the crown, the once few factories that dotted our nation are now turned into vast industrial complexes. Investment is high, opportunities are plentiful and employment even more so; leading to a boom in the development of our country. The fires of these modern-day forges burn red hot, running strong even in the bleak midwinter, to provide Aestlonia with its needs."
AES_karkad_war_buffs:0 "Never Again"
AES_karkad_war_buffs_desc:0 "##TODO, We might have once lost to Karkadannistan, but this mistake will not repeat. We are fully committed to safeguard our freedom, we have learnt from the past and we're still here to say it proudly: "Aestlonia shall be free!""
AES_3_plus_1_languages:0 "3+1 Issue"
AES_3_plus_1_languages_desc:0 "Made up of many communities of different cultural backgrounds, the Aestlonian nation is home to a diverse population that speaks 3 different languages. To make matters worse, after the Arabians imposed their rule upon the region, their own language was introduced as the "universal" language which was used to draft official documents and records. Centuries later, this poses a hurdle for the nation where Arabian communities (while a significant minority) constitute a small percentage of the population; most of which are not versed in their language."
AES_3_plus_1_languages_v2:0 "Slowly Forming Identity"
AES_3_plus_1_languages_v2_desc:0 "For centuries, the communities of Aestlonia have not had the opportunity to take a breather and appreciate the diversity of culture and languages of their nation. Now, with recent efforts undertaken by the Princess, work is being done on forging a nascent Aestlonian identity."
AES_army_language_spirit:0 "Army Language"
AES_army_language_spirit_desc:0 "The various languages, once a major hindrance to a unified cultural zeitgeist, has allowed our armed corps to communicate in a unique manner unseen in any other nation's armed forces and has helped foster a closer understanding of the different cultures inhabiting our nation; leading to a bond over shared heritage and belonging."
AES_the_evil_pact:0 "Lumetorm Pact"
AES_the_evil_pact_desc:0 "##TODO, with the temporary pact officialized the cultist have gotten a lot more influence over the Aestlonian government. But, at least, the cultists might start joining the army."
AES_windigo_spirit_preparationtree:0 "Warriors of the Ice Spirits"
AES_windigo_spirit_preparationtree_desc:0 "##TODO, The cultists have created this whole concept around the Windigos, one that has started to resonate even with part of our army. People are now doing near to fully suicidal missions and acts in name of the spirits."
AES_for_harmony:0 "Fighting for Harmony"
AES_for_harmony_desc:0 "##TODO, we're not fighting because we want war, we're fighting simply to protect what's ours. They started this fire, not us. If they want a fight, they will have one. But we won't forget our principles."
AES_ponykind_volunteers:0 "Pony Volunteers"
AES_ponykind_volunteers_desc:0 "##TODO, all over pony nations our call has been heard. One of resistance against a foreign enslaving enemy that wants to destroy our lands and people. These brave volunteers will help our country in more ways than just manpower, as their presence allows us to learn from their teachings."
AES_arab_volunteers:0 "Arabian Volunteers"
AES_arab_volunteers_desc:0 "##TODO, our righteous message was able to convince quite a few of the horses of Arabia and beyond to fight for our cause. Not only are they helping us by holding our frontlines but they're also providing much of their advanced knowledge."

AES_worker_support_desc:0 "##TODO, with the union on our side our production complex can only get better."

AES_cultist_opposition:0 "Cultist Sabotage"
AES_cultist_opposition_desc:0 "##TODO, with our refusal to work with them the cultist have taken to sabotage us in our war against Karkadannistan."
AES_arab_resentment:0 "In Limbo"
AES_arab_resentment_desc:0 "##TODO, after recent events the considerably sized Arabian community has been left in a state of limbo due to Zaida's push to create a more "native" Aestlonian identity. The state now needs to decide if it will try to adopt this culture back into the new cultural framework in some way or if it will work to phase it out."

### Army coup/Republic ideas###
AES_new_regime:0 "Aspirant Republic"
AES_new_regime_desc:0 "##TODO, with the establishment of the republic many political and social groups have become agitated and even enthusiastic to take part in the new regime.

Politics are messier than ever and it might be hard to hold onto our popularity in the future as the people demand a true Republic."
AES_recognition_no:0 "Diplomatic Isolation"
AES_recognition_no_desc:0 "##TODO, even if Aestlonia wasn't known for it's web of diplomatic and trade partners, we still had something to fall back on.

AES_liberal_approach:0 "Liberal Approach"
AES_liberal_approach_desc:0 "##TODO, The way of the sword is not the way that we wish to rule this country. It's clear that our liberal approach of working with the less extremist groups is the best way to ensure stablity and a bright future for the new republic."

AES_authoritarian_approach_fascist_desc:0 "##TODO, even though other Maregyptian revival societies and scholars have denounced the MRS, they were still a needed partner in our quest to rule the nation."
AES_authoritarian_approach_neutral:0 "Army At The Realm"

AES_amza_bold_goal_desc:0 "##TODO, to call either our goal to create a socialism never done before or our goal to take the Great Lakes "bold" is to be humble, we need to understand what we are fighting for and that we are the only ones capable of accomplishing it."
AES_great_lakes_refugee:0 "Refugee Act"
AES_great_lakes_refugee_desc:0 "##TODO, with the situation in the Great Lakes being as unstable as ever it is our duty to accept "refugees" from these lands. The Crimson Sun has been nice enough to secure regimed-friendly zebras interested to move to our nation."

aestlonia.1.t:0 "The Path Forward"
aestlonia.1.d:0 "From the icy southern wastes to the towering northern mountains, from the kelpie-styled docks of Zarmarej to the weary spires of Ajloun, the whispers of change could be heard in every corner of Aestlonia. Indeed, many ponies believed in them and eagerly carried the words about transformation further on, while some were brave enough to act upon these murmurs, bringing their own vision for the country closer to reality. Still, for now, there was only one creature whose ambition to shift the realm matched their capabilities to do so.\n\nPrincess Zaida paced across her private study impatiently. Whereas her late mother, Princess Rawiya, second of the name, spent a lot of time in the audience chambers, hosting various factions and balancing their expectations, the young ruler had quickly lost any faith in the process of holding an all-pleasing court. In her eyes, the political forces across the Advisory Council were abusing the National Unity Act to focus on their petty problems, burying truly important issues under worthless squabbles. Even the growing threat of Karkadannistani invasion, one promising the very end of their proud nation, was not enough to resolve the constant state of deadlock.\n\nStopping in front of a large window, Zaida pulled the heavy curtains to the sides, allowing in the cold bright sun. The view of her beloved city calmed the princess somewhat, sharpening her focus and tempering her frustration into determination. As always, she needed to act on her own, charting the new course with a sure hoof no matter how rough the coming storm was shaping up to be."
aestlonia.1.a:0 "Emergency royal decrees were drafted shortly."
aestlonia.2.t:0 "Reign and Rein"
aestlonia.2.d:0 "As the heiress apparent, Zaida had experienced an upbringing entirely devoted to the duties and best practices of an enlightened leader. Although the lessons she learned so diligently turned out to be needed much sooner than she had expected, the princess used this core knowledge with great confidence over the last few years.\n\nAmong the different subjects, history had been one of her favorites. There was something especially fascinating and profound to be observed in the rise and fall of the great powers of the world, be it the now obvious collapse of Sa'adles or Grovers, or the smaller signs of decadence seen in the mighty Equestria, promising it a similar path. From where Zaida was standing, all of these examples of decline had common symptoms: bloated bureaucracy, neglected military, technological stagnation, and harmful deference to their traditions. \n\nWith the recent edicts, she did everything to combat the spread of the former three ailments inside of Aestlonia, at least everything possible in the current legal framework. Nonetheless, this was clearly not enough to ensure the survival of the country, and the biggest barrier preventing future reforms became painfully obvious. The princess felt no joy in tearing down her mother's legacy, but she could not afford to delay the next steps any longer, and so, after a short deliberation within the inner circle of the court, a new order was released, one to become a title of many front pages and a top point for many debates."

aestlonia.3.t:0 "The Reaction"
aestlonia.3.d:0 "Winter Qalam held little doubt that the present session of the Advisory Council was the most dynamic in the last few months, perhaps even since the coronation of Zaida. Naturally, their gracious ruler was the reason for this perturbation too.\n\n"To sum up, no offense to all the fine folks here, these meetings were really becoming a drag." Steel Raud, the imposing representative of AGWU, currently occupied the speaker's podium. "Her majesty is not only well within her rights to change the laws - this is the only way out of our snowdrifts."\n\nThe creatures in the room started clamoring. The wing occupied by Millenary Path was expectedly united in their vocal disapproval, but Winter noticed negative remarks coming from other parties as well, including some members of his own TBT.\n\n"Order in the assembly!" His duties as a chairpony were sure to be tested today, but the realm needed every bit of stability if Zaida's plans were to work. "We have heard the opinion of the Union, and now would like to invite commentary for further discussion. Honorable Snowstorm, we would be grateful if you could present the opinion of your faction."\n\nA pony with mane of red and white - a cultist, even though Winter never liked the term - rose up after silence finally fell down. "Thank you. This... decision enforced by the princess is nothing but regression to the oppressive regime of the past. Not only does she remove the voice from the common Aestlonians, but she also robs them of the chance to defend their traditions, so nobly provided by her late mother..."\n\nThe rest of the sentence was drowned in the rising wave of accusations, jeering and hollers of support. With a sigh, Winter reached for his gavel again."
aestlonia.3.a:0 ""Order! Order, fillies and gentlecolts!""
aestlonia.4.t:0 "Hour Of The Sword"
aestlonia.4.d:0 "No war could be fought without the soldiers, and no soldiers would march without a commander. Luckily, Zaida had no delusions regarding her own military prowess, but the upcoming conflict demanded more than an honest assessment of her capabilities. In order to finalize the development of Aestlonian Provisional Army and ensure that its officers would be fully immersed in the reforms, the top brass was summoned to the royal palace for a series of planning sessions and battle plan elaborations.\n\nField marshal Golden Sayif and her generals arrived promptly, ready and able to contribute to the discussions. While Zaida respected Golden's abilities and accomplishments, as she was sitting in the chamber-turned-headquarters and listening to the officers' presentations, the princess could easily see that it would be a while before the gruff mare would show her any reverence beyond that dictated by the etiquette.\n\n"We are standing at the crossroads, your majesty. As it was explained prior, troop quality and quantity have their merits, and even with your commendable swiftness we do not have time to achieve both." Marshal's voice, trained by thousands of orders, rang crisply across the room. "The final decision is yours, and it would be wise to make it today. Permission to speak freely?"\n\n"Granted." Nodding, Zaida wordlessly wondered whether she could stop her from speaking freely at all.\n\n"The Karkad incursion will be short, one way or the other. After it is over, if Aestlonia stands, the power you have to change it will be curtailed." Golden gave the princess a hardened stare. "Use it well, and remember, when the strife comes, the corruption from within will raise its head too. Do not allow the damned cult to spread its taint with abandon again.""
aestlonia.4.a:0 ""Your... advice is noted, lady marshal.""
aestlonia.6.t:0 "Grind Down, Build Anew"
aestlonia.6.d:0 ""You! Private!" Golden Sayif focused all her attention on a single recruit in the long line, causing him to visibly shake. "How many laps did you make in the allotted time?"\n\n"T-t-ten." The heavy breaths and ample amount of sweat indicated that this was the extent of the stallion's current physical form. Golden had no doubts that a green member of the old Ajloun Brigade would make fifteen with a leisurely trot. Shivering under her heavy gaze still, the unfortunate pony felt a need to add something else. "Y-your highness."\n\nFrom a certain point of view, the marshal felt sorry for this lot. The decision to have enough bodies to properly cover the entire front line with Karkadannistan was strategically sound, but it also meant that the quality of the future defenders of the nation was, as one of the officers tactfully put it, below average. Thus, it fell to Golden to make these pathetic whelps into something presentable.\n\n"YOUR HIGHNESS? You can call a mare you are trying to woo "your highness", though I don't think you have a chance with muscles like that." With every booming word, the recruit seemed to shrink away further and further. "You will call me Marshal Golden, or ma'am. Is. That. Clear?"\n\n"Yes. Marshal Golden. Ma'am." After whispering his answer, the pony winced as laughter from the tail end of the formation reached his ears. Golden, meanwhile, was happy to pounce on the new target.\n\n"Oh, the privates who made less than ten find it funny? Well, all of you can have fun." She raised her voice to the full commanding power, causing everyone to snap to attention immediately. "Five minutes of rest for you all, and another run. All who fail to get twelve make a third attempt. IS THAT CLEAR?""
aestlonia.6.a:0 ""Yes, Marshal Golden, ma'am!""
aestlonia.7.t:0 "Building Upon the Old"
aestlonia.7.d:0 "Golden Sayif had a faint smile on her face, a sight as rare as a hot summer in Aestlonia. In the distance, the enemy dummy stood peppered with a few holes; specifically, three in the chest and two in the head.\n\nFive perfect shots. The shooter himself was crouched beside her, skillfully unloading the breech cartridge and hanging the rifle by his side with a similar proud look on his face. Along the same range, other soldiers and recruits from the old Ajloun Brigade scored similar shots on their targets. In the distance, Golden could hear the reverberating chants of soldiers marching in synchronized steps; their guns hung ready on their shoulders.\n\nThis is what an army should be, she thought. Even if the days of disorganized militias were past, their legacy and experience would still carry on the torch of the nation in battles henceforth. Even so, her thoughts lingered in doubt.\n\nWill it be enough? The enemy was vast and would no doubt outnumber them and their smaller army...\n\n"Marshal Golden!"\n\nTurning to the source of the sound, she saw that all the recruits had finished taking their shots at the targets. Perfect scores, all of them.\n\n"Good shooting, recruits! Keep working this hard and you will be ready for any battle! Now...give me ten laps around the ground in half an hour!" she bellowed.\n\nIt will have to be enough..."
aestlonia.7.a:0 "Professionals have standards."
aestlonia.8.t:0 "Noble and Strong"
aestlonia.8.d:0 "Zaida surely knew how to talk the talk. After all, it was a quality necessary for any politician, and throughout her life Steel Raud saw many ponies of that kind. There was something special about this one, however, a certain quality which all these big-mouthed mares and stallions lacked in. Even now, during their private meeting, when the princess was not perched up on her throne and had to raise her head to meet the gaze of the considerably taller socialist, Zaida carried a presence which simply put her one level higher.\n\n"Once again, I am incredibly thankful for your support, Director. It would hardly be an overstatement that the levels of effort Aestlonians are putting out right now, be it militia service or factory work, are unprecedented and fill my soul with eternal gratitude." The princess bowed slightly.\n\n"It is what they do, Your Majesty. For the country, and, frankly, for you." Returning the gesture, Raud pushed her chair back a bit.\n\nZaida smiled politely, but then sighed and allowed a thoughtful expression to cross her face. "I would be not quite honest if I said I understand these feelings in my heart. Logically, the adoration and the respect for the ruler are natural, but I have never had a similar figure placed above me." Her companion did not interrupt, and so the pensiveness coalesced into determination. "Still, I know that I will do everything in my power to carry the greatness they ascribe to me."\n\n"That's what all of us do. All we can." Raud remained reserved, but her eyes came alight with a spark of approval. "That's what I wanted to ask too. More fight to be found in this pony. I want to join the army. If Your Majesty would have me, of course.""

aestlonia.9.d:0 "The meeting between villages of different tribes was quite a significant event, organized by local governors with meticulous care. Of course, these big words meant something only for the grown-ups, and while the stallions and mares mingled at the massive culture fair, their children sought their own exchanges.\n\n"Anneli." A filly with a high-pitched voice pointed at herself, mirroring the gesture of a darker colt in a thick cap in front of her. "And you're called Iuh-hur?"\n\n"It's Yukhur." While he could understand his own distorted name among the weird sounds the stranger made, most of her words remained a mystery. "I. Come. From. Beyond. Big. Forest."\n\nGathering that the slowed rhythm corresponded to an explanation was easy, but it scarcely helped to understand any of the meaning behind the unfamiliar language. Trying her best to express confusion, Anneli grimaced and chaotically gestured with hooves.\n\nAfter a short deliberation, Yukhur picked up a nearby twig and started tracing lines in the fresh snow. The map he made was quite detailed, with a plethora of triangle trees, a thick line for the river and several boxy houses. Satisfied with the result, the colt added a tiny pony figure next to one of them, and nodded towards it. Recognising the stream, his companion snatched the stick and started adding to the picture. After she finished a similar piece of taiga with a set of more rounded buildings, a spark of mischief flared in her eyes as she reached out to the first half and added a curled hat to its lone inhabitant. Resemblance was passing at best, but Yukhur nodded with approval and answered with his own detail - another pony next to the circles, one with braided mane, just like Anneli."

Zaida ached for more, for something visible and formed by her own will, not just related to her mother's achievements. Today, she was doing exactly that.\n\n"A historical occurrence, Your Majesty." The ever loyal advisor, Winter Qalam, hovered over her shoulder, reading the document neatly laid out on the table. "It is truly wonderful that recognition of our heritage is not dislodged by other pressing concerns."\n\n"Do you really think so?" Tapping her pen nervously, the princess frowned. "Some would say that it is an empty and vainglorious thing, neither necessary nor timely."\n\n"These voices should be rebuffed steadily and we will answer their cries in a twofold manner. It is a project which has been developed with your supervision by a team of our greatest artists, writers and linguists over several years, hence it has little bearing on current material resources, and there is no better moment to strengthen the soul of a creature, or indeed, the nation, than during a struggle. Your loyal subjects are completely behind you, Your Majesty." The stallion smiled as she made a confident nod and scribbled an ornate signature on the bottom of the last page. For him, there was power in names and words, and today this power was given out evenly, shaping regions, cities, or indeed, their ruler."

The attack was coming, and without a reliable plan it would crush Aestlonia in a matter of weeks.\n\nThe sensible option, of course, was to stick with the proven loyalists, TBT or AGWU. By putting the international connections of the former or the popular support of the latter to the forefront of the preparation campaign, reasonable progress could be achieved in the remaining time. Still, what if reasonable was not enough?\n\nA tinge of fear, a speck of desperation, maybe even a shade of dark ambition highlighted another possibility. The cultists of Millenary Path were more than capable fighters, and without the National Unity Act they were turning against the state once more, putting even more pressure on the overextended army. This situation could be reversed, new negotiations initiated, starting a risky bargain with a steep price of success and failure alike."

To business then." Glancing to the sides, the princess shifted forward slightly. "I was told that you have brought a final draft of the pertinent agreement?"\n\nThere was a ringing noise of clasp removed, a rustle of paper sheets and finally a soft knock on the table as the documents were placed in front of Zaida. As per the many legal lessons from her younger days, she took time reading every word and measuring their dark implications. Unfortunately, this was exactly the list of measures necessary to save Aestlonia.\n\n"It goes without saying that we expect a very strict reading of the text." She tried to sound assertive. "Millenary Path shall act civilized, exactly as it portrays itself to the outside world, and never as a harmful sect." Since there was no indication of any interruption or comment, Zaida pushed on. "There is also the matter of the ending clause. You and your people need to understand that most of these privileges will be withdrawn after the war, subject to royal review depending on the past circumstances."\n\nStorm Alsaqie remained frozenly still."

Nonetheless, there was something about this unarmed stallion, a certain aura of danger, which would trouble Zaida even if she did not know anything about him.\n\n"Vastik Kabja. The court bids you welcome." Luckily, the mask of a ruler cared little whether to hide boredom or worry. "We were told you wish to pledge yourself to defend Aestlonia."\n\nKabja, infamous cultist, known to the newspapers as Butcher of Badimane and to the intelligence office as an A-class peril, bowed gracefully, with a fluidity of motion rarely seen even in most experienced retainers.\n\n"Your Majesty. I am honored." He spoke with a degree of unexpected deterrence, and even the low whistling undertone - unfortunate consequence of a chipped tooth - did little to detract from it. "You heard right. Once my path brought me back to the struggling homeland, my duty became abundantly clear."\n\n"And why would a veteran such as you choose to return to the front lines so soon?" The haughty curiosity of the question waned slightly when Zaida met Kabja's gaze, noticing a flicker of something dark behind his focused eyes.\n\n"Three reasons, Your Majesty. First is duty, as I've said. Second, I take pride in my talent for war" Stressing the last word, the stallion tapped the ground firmly. "Third, just like you, I carry the blood of Arabia. It is the nature of our people to fight for a cause, fight no matter the odds, be it on a battlefield, or, indeed, in a palace."\n\nThe compliment was sincere, but it did little to put Zaida at ease."

Now, properly stuck in the middle of a frozen forest with nothing but a thick overcoat and a heavily scratched spade, he was ready to reconsider. Tellingly, the fact that he was not alone out here made the situation even more unbearable.\n\n"Come on, sergeant. Shelter-making should be easy for such an accomplished officer. Use that big head of yours." One of his new instructors snickered and tapped her hoof. Unlike Shiver, she seemed right at home here in the tundra, among the elements and strange creature sounds.\n\nHe sighed. They had given him a tool for digging, so it would make sense to dig. Putting all his weight into the strike, Shiver brought the spade down to the frigid ground with a loud clang. The resulting dent was miserably small.\n\n"Sister, look! He actually went for it." The other teacher made a guffawing noise. "Go on, continue. If you try hard enough, your dead body will appreciate the shallow grave."\n\n"I'm sorry, this does require a bit more folk wisdom than marching on a parade." Moving leisurely, the first mare approached Shiver, who felt too embarrassed to provide a retort. "Shovelling will get you nowhere even in the summer. Watch closely. These marks come from the bark of the tree - the best way to start a shelter is to fell one."\n\n"So get chopping. We are going to pray, and when we come back you'd better make some progress."

Snowstorm, prominent Millenary Path speaker, paced the podium energetically, her words building up into a resonating crescendo. Of course, the acoustic qualities of this hogwash were of little interest to Golden Sayif. Even though she booked one of the best spots in the room, the marshal cared only for the ending of the speech, when the damned cultist would stop for a bow, or a salute, or whatever passed for a farewell in their rotten cohorts.\n\n"We shall form this avalanche out of steel and flesh! And with our strength carried by the mighty wind of hatred, we shall destroy any and all who oppose us, and feed the lands with their ashes and blood. For we are chosen of a higher power, harbingers of a greater destiny!" The critical moment was approaching rapidly. Golden took a deep sigh, focusing on the position of her mark and the weight of the concealed pistol.\n\n"Ours is the sacrifice, but ours shall be the eternal glory!" At last, Snowstorm took the final step, she was standing still and observing the audience, but something in the response caused the marshal's instinct to halt the plan. Golden expected approval from members of the sect, but the chamber was full of other ponies, civilian or even military ones, who stomped and cheered with the same insane passion. Leaning back in exasperation, she refined this fact into a dreadful realization: it was too late for a surgical strike, and worse..."

Despite the willingness of TBT and AGWU to cooperate on most issues, their leadership proposed radically different approaches to the finer details of war preparation.\n\nIn particular, the former devised a plan focused on diplomacy play, doubling down on help from Equestria both in personnel and equipment. The latter, meanwhile, advised an internal restructuration, counting on the capacity of the worker class to produce weapons and hooves to wield them. Since mixing and matching such distinct ideas was clearly ill-fortuned due to the time constraints, the princess had to settle on a single way forward."

aestlonia.28.d:0 "The numbers in the military reports gave Zaida a sense of impressive scale for the machine of state at her beck and call, but this power was somehow ephemeral, detached from reality. As she was walking along the line of the newly formed royal guard regiment, the princess felt rather differently. These ponies would soon become another marker on the map of the frontline, but here and now they were flesh and blood, ready to fight and to die, to do their duty to the state - duty to her.\n\nHer thoughts wandered across their fates, while her eyes examined their faces. This one, for instance, a stallion with a streak of red mane sticking from under his cap and a chiseled jaw - what would come of him? Feeling the royal attention, the recruit saluted and Zaida nodded back.\n\n"Anything of particular interest to Your Majesty?" The colonel assigned to the force, a grizzled veteran, posed the question with reverence and a subtle hint of worry, ready to pounce on the source of the problem.\n\n"Yes, actually. I want to give the soldiers a speech." Driven by a sudden, deep impulse, Zaida took a step back. After the officer obediently commanded for attention and hundreds of heads turned to catch her every word, she started to speak, loudly and passionately.\n\n"Sons and daughters of Aestlonia! Today, you honor your homes, your ancestors, your princess! Know this: our struggle, the one you have bravely joined in the most perilous role, is righteous. You, noble warriors, carry my colors into the battle, and my heart is filled with confidence - these soldiers will not let me down. Victory will be ours!"

Our country faces a monumental danger. It will take a great effort to overcome it, but overcome it we shall." Winter Qalam's voice echoed over the audience eager to catch his every word. "No matter the belief or political cause, it is time to reach out to our brothers and sisters and rise up as an unbreakable bulwark against the invasion." The stallion nodded to his larger companion, inviting her to take over.\n\n"It is just so." Steel Raud spoke slower, simpler, but with the same underlying intent. "We will fight, and we will win. For we are made of harder stuff, for we are protecting the lives and the lands we cherish. Rich or poor, one tribe or another, city dweller or village folk - all can help, will help."\n\nFinally, the princess herself took a step forward. As she raised her hoof, the excited crowd swiftly fell silent. "Today I stand between two great champions of our nation. Soon, I will be leading a thousand times more, creatures both mighty and proud. Know this: the accord reached here and now will be the everlasting bond, one which we will all take strength from, be it in the struggle or in the glorious peace afterwards." Looking around, Zaida could easily see the planted seeds of success. Hundreds of her devoted subjects were ready to spread the true message, one which she carried with passion and one turned into a battle-cry by the unleashed crowd."

"Me and my friends have better things to do than traveling across the seas and pulling practical jokes on harbormasters."\n\n"Listen, Miss..." Under a dozen intense stares from the aforementioned friends, a group of ponies in matching uniforms huddled behind their leader, Tiidrik hastened to correct himself. "I meant, Sergeant Foam. There are proper rules and regulations. Due to the current situation. I cannot allow a fully-loaded military transport to..."\n\n"Afraid to say you've got it all wrong. We are not a military transport." Foam grinned widely. "Just a shared interest group with a strong theme and a thing for tourism."\n\nBefore the overseer had a chance to question this dubious claim, a shout came from the communications room of his patrol ship. "They've got an all clear from the Ajloun headquarters, sir! Also multiple requests for docking inbound!" The latter comment was rather superfluous, as looking down towards the horizon Tiidrik could discern at least ten more vessels which were approaching at a steady pace.

A round helmet and a pair of darting eyes were the only parts of the officer who addressed the workers from beyond the barricades of the military outpost. Glancing at the crowd, minding its size in particular, Merle could guess the source of the apprehension pretty easily. "It is my duty to inform you that public actions are..."\n\n"Comrades!"

"This is hardly a standard procedure!" Of course, this fact was known to Merle too, but he had learnt the value of action over red tape long ago. The captain leaned closer to the speaker.\n\n"Tell them we're here to fight for our country. Tell them the creatures of Aestlonia has heard her call."

Even so, in these troubled times one had to settle for  solace instead of joy.\n\n"It is rather curious, the manner our bloodlines work." The sovereign princess glanced at her noblemare companions. "When a foreign aristocrat has grand ideas for the cultural transformation, or the survival of the state, does it ever end well?"\n\n"Pray tell you do not speak of yourself, cherished cousin." Although Lumi, the head of the ancient family once ruling over Särav Org, was not related to Zaida this closely, such an endearing term was customary in their circles. "You are the one who the nation follows, in hearts and minds alike, the very essence of their kinship."\n\n"They do indeed, but what is the justification of such loyalty? By birth and custom, I am much closer to just another Arabian despot than either you or cousin Ntrôm." Zaida straightened her mane in a slow, melancholic gesture.\n\nThe second mentioned pony bowed slightly and then answered softly, yet with certainty. "Their faith in you binds stronger than any other claim. True, my ancestors fled the Maregypt alongside theirs, and cousin Lumi is also related to the kings of old, but this is not what Aestlonia needs now. You are the princess, their princess, the one who leads them bravely through a terrible tempest. Take this destiny with pride.""

However, there was nothing of the sort to be found inside the mind which devised a daring strike at the corruption in the heart of the nation. Something had to occupy the abandoned position, and the determination, deep-rooted and bitter, proved to be just the right force.\n\nThe transmitter in her hoof felt heavy and cold, like a rifle after a long march. Golden put out the speech notes in front of her, taking aim, and then pulled the proverbial trigger.\n\n"Fellow citizens of Aestlonia. Marshal Golden Sayif speaking.

To that effect, the National Assembly is suspended."\n\nAn intimate knowledge of the city defenses, the cultists' belief in their own invulnerability, a core of loyal soldiers, all the ingredients for a decapitating strike were perfect.

The royal proclamation on cultural changes has left many Aestlonian Arabians puzzled, as it only included the plans for bridging the three main tribes, and left their group out. Oskarri did not doubt that her neighbors were happy to support her majesty Zaida, but in order to do so they would need to understand what she wanted for their people. She raised her hoof, signaling silence.\n\n"The last one is indeed true, petal."  As the villagers calmed down, she continued.

aestlonia.35.a:0 "Yet, he had already stood up and stepped to the exit."
aestlonia.36.t:0 "A Wild Option"
aestlonia.36.d:0 "With the brunt of preparations for the Karkadannistan war focused closer to the future front line, the court life in the capital became unusually quiet. Zaida would often find herself with sparse company, spending long hours neck-deep in paperwork and planning, but sometimes stuck with only servants and her own musings for entertainment. These daydreaming moments, especially those which lingered, could carry her far across the ocean of ideas. Sometimes, a peculiar thought could suddenly surface, manifesting into an actual deliberation.\n\nTo stop the horses, Hestraya would have to stand united. However, despite all the shared history and common interests, all the treaties and promises, it did consist of two parts. The princess did not truly think Maretonia inferior, but a prideful, disdainful whisper in her mind was always happy to repeat the gossip of northern softness, laziness, even weakness in front of the incoming danger. Maybe this neighbor could use some direction, even prosper under a more decisive ruler?\n\nA more calculating side of her consciousness kicked in swiftly. Actually claiming the crown was barely possible, requiring unreasonable exploitation of the fact that the Maretonian duke was Zaida's brother-in-law. Worse, full-blown negotiations would require ages to complete. This left a sudden ultimatum as the only viable option, betting heavily on the fact that the local nobles could be shocked into submission and the duchess shared the same outlook as her younger sibling.  Naturally, a failure would ruin the public image of the princess, lead to an irreconcilable breakdown of their partnership or worse, but what if..."

aestlonia.37.t:0 "Southern Madness"
aestlonia.37.d:0 "An outrageous ultimatum has arrived from Aestlonia: their princess Zaida, the younger sister of our duchess, has claimed the crown of Maretonia. Her brazen power grab is based on nothing but this blood tie, and she apparently expects us to immediately submit to her rule, citing the Karkadannistani threat and our "inadequate war preparations".\n\nNo major political faction inside our country supports this farce, and even the duchess herself has publicly denounced her imperialistic sibling. Still, an armed conflict with an ally at this time will undermine every chance at stopping the actual invasion."
aestlonia.37.a:0 "We will not submit to a tyrant just because she is kin."
aestlonia.37.b:0 "For the future of Hestraya we are ready to bow."
aestlonia.38.t:0 "Northern Refusal"
aestlonia.38.d:0 "The news about Zaida's gamble to unite Hestraya and especially about its initial failure are spreading fast, causing an uproar not only among Maretonians, but in Aestlonia too. Unsurprisingly, the general public does not wish to fight against a historical ally, and the army, remaining unprepared for any kind of local operation due to the value placed on secrecy by the princess, is vehemently against any escalation. Of course, backing down now will only confirm the prevalent opinion on the whole affair being entirely unnecessary and torpedo the monarch's reputation."
aestlonia.38.a:0 "The orders stand regardless."
aestlonia.38.b:0 "It has been a terrible mistake…"
aestlonia.39.t:0 "The Last Warning"
aestlonia.39.d:0 ""Lady Marshal. What brings you to us in such an important hour?" To say that Zaida was dreading this visit would be a stretch, but she certainly hoped to avoid or at least curtail it.\n\n"You know the reason quite well." The seasoned soldier’s voice thundered across the throne room with anything but reverence. "The army is not a toy to be winded up at your leisure, and neither is the entire foreign policy."\n\nDespite the tone of the address, the princess maintained her mask for now, patiently awaiting the obligatory "your majesty", which Golden Sayif finally spitted out with contempt. "Your dissatisfaction has been noted. Is there anything else you find necessary to share with our court?"\n\n"As a matter of fact, yes." Looking around at the assembled officials, the older mare snorted and continued in a collected manner. "The princess is careless, inexperienced and not yet fit to rule, while her actions are burying Aestlonia in deep snow…"\n\nTalking down to Zaida was one thing, but talking over her, belittling her authority was on a different level of unacceptable entirely. "How dare you!" The sudden clarion outburst caused the marshal to stop. "What do you know of the monarch’s burden? Must we remind you that you gave an oath to serve the state, my state? You have a duty protecting the country and following orders, not questioning your sovereign ruler. Out, I will have not one more treasonous word!"\n\nGolden flinched, saluted in total silence and stormed away, her steps echoing heavily in the pillared chamber."
aestlonia.39.a:0 "She would serve the homeland, always."
aestlonia.40.t:0 "A Broken Mirror"
aestlonia.40.d:0 ""She who was once my sister,\n\nI cannot fathom what kind of dark spirit possessed you to perform such an atrocity, and I only pray for the salvation of the gentle soul brought up by our wise mother. You have shattered any bond which existed between us, and until you stop this madness, until you seek forgiveness - not with me, but with our people, brought into suffering by your malice - there shall be no more letters.\n\nWith this scroll, I condemn your transgressions and renounce our sacred kinship.\n\nHer Royal Grace, Duchess of Maretonia""
aestlonia.40.a:0 "The princess teared up the letter, while Zaida allowed herself one tear."

aestloniamonarchy.1.t:0 "Honor the Princess"
aestloniamonarchy.1.d:0 "There was a part of Zaida that felt relieved. Aestlonia was victorious, and, what's more, she was victorious, standing atop a monumental triumph. Nonetheless, the urge to relax, partake in leisure and celebrate was quickly shut down by two prevailing factors.\n\nFirstly, there was the objective reality. The battle reports and appeals from the home front were not gone, but instead replaced by the proceedings of establishing control over the new territories and restoration of the old ones. Although Zaida managed to jumpstart the country once, now this only compounded with the older systemic problems. Thus, a decisive push for stability was required, one obviously to be spearheaded by the reigning monarch.\n\nSecondly, there were other ideas bubbling inside the mind of the princess. Why would she be content with pushing back some uninspired, barbaric opportunists? Zaida could do so much more, for the people, for harmony, and for greater glory still. Indeed, some of her newest works, such as the reorganization of the Provisional Army, guard regiments and the eastern partisan forces into the United Royal Army Command, were approaching final stages of completion, and the ground was set for more ambitious developments."
aestloniamonarchy.1.a:0 "By her will, the land of ice would shine bright!"
aestloniamonarchy.2.t:0 "Still Standing"
aestloniamonarchy.2.d:0 "Even though it came with a great cost, the war definitely did one thing to Zaida’s liking: it shortened the cumbersome protocol of royal audiences to a tolerable degree. Despite the insistence of more ceremony-minded members of the court, she had no intention of letting this revert to the previous form.\n\nToday’s visit by a certain Pinekäbi, an earth pony from the territories previously occupied by Karkadannistan, was a perfect example to prove her preferences right, as instead of a lengthy session of title calling and a myriad of obligatory pleasantries, Zaida could dive almost straight into the conversation. By the intelligence reports it was promising to be an interesting one: the stallion bowing in front of the throne went from a member of the Millenary Path to a tundra reservation ranger to a star of the local resistance, now ready to properly serve the crown.\n\n"Your Majesty. Your name rings joyously from the blue waters to the green treetops, and I am honored to be in your presence." He spoke in a solemn manner, one of deeper understanding rather than of empty pedantry.\n\n"Please rise, noble Pinekäbi." With a half-polite, half-intrigued smile, the princess gestured upwards with her hoof. "We bid you welcome with great pleasure and wonder what brings you before us."\n\n"I seek employment with the ruler of Aestlonia. My lone years taught me much of the nature of the fight, and now I shall give back a fair share to my home."\n\n"Consider yourself enlisted immediately by the monarch decree." Nodding, Zaida shifted forward slightly. "Albeit, with one condition: tell us more of these years.""
aestloniamonarchy.2.a:0 "The tales of the will and the wilds were much to her liking."
aestloniamonarchy.3.t:0 "Call from Merelinn"
aestloniamonarchy.3.d:0 "It was rare for any Aestlonian monarch to venture out into the realm without organizing a proper royal tour, and stranger yet to do so only to solve a specific local problem. However, Zaida was not just any monarch. Moreover, there was something about the recent request from the port town of Merelinn which made her want to go.\n\nThe citizens, whose complaints amounted to weird noises and unusual movements in the water, were surprised and delighted to receive the full attention of the princess. Demonstrating understandable appreciation, they endeavored to meet all Zaida's itinerary requests and in particular set her up by the shore, in a touched-up mansion used to host foreign dignitaries occasionally arriving to the country via the town.\n\nOf course, despite the inexplicable attraction, the princess was not going to stay for long - in fact, her visit was just two days, one for the arrival ceremony and another for the inspection of the dockyards. Nonetheless, it was during the night between them Zaida found herself staring from the window towards the rolling waves, struggling to snap her attention away."
aestloniamonarchy.3.a:0 "She returned to bed and shut the feeling away."
aestloniamonarchy.3.b:0 "Following her instincts, she went to the beach alone."
aestloniamonarchy.4.t:0 "A Familiar Question"
aestloniamonarchy.4.d:0 "Although the recent events did put some important questions on hold, Zaida was perfectly aware of the need to move forward. However, the new circumstances required a commensurate adaptation.\n\nOnce, she envisioned a grand political reformation, uniting the best aspects of the TBT and the AGWU. Erudition and tradition of the former, simplicity and communality of the latter, tied together by the loyalty to the throne could become an ultimate answer to the challenges of the era. Alas, this promising utopia was simply impossible to achieve now, with some inevitable favoritism which took place before the war playing only a minor part in the difficulties. Instead of a wild experiment, Aestlonia required a well-defined course to guide her away from the crisis, and the princess was responsible for being the ultimate pathfinder.\n\nThe significance of this choice could not be understated - Zaida was setting on the capital F future for everything from herself and the court to the entirety of her people. There was certainly room for maneuver within each faction, but the main direction, the principal advisory group, would have to be decided unequivocally."
aestloniamonarchy.4.a:0 "It shall be the TBT."
aestloniamonarchy.4.b:0 "The AGWU deserves this."
aestloniamonarchy.5.t:0 "Of Glories Past"
aestloniamonarchy.5.d:0 "Zaida often took to strolling through the palace garden to untangle her thoughts. Today she chose the ice sculpture gallery as the place for her deliberations, and while the daylight danced in bright colors inside their transparent forms, the princess considered the subject of this art. Many would say that it represented the essence of the culture of her people.\n\nHowever, there were ponies with very different ideas. The members of so-called "Aesgyptian Movement", a small but influential faction inside of the ascendant TBT, would call it just a circumstantial fad. Of course, their position did not end with this very specific remark, but rather it reflected the general radical attitude. Keeping up with the name, they endorsed the slow revival of the ways of the ancestral home, Maregypt, and rejected anything inherently Hestrayan. More zealous adherents even went on to speak of reclaiming the "motherland" and abandoning the current "temporary refuge". This semi-independent organization had sent emissaries to Zaida with a proposal for the new government built on cessation of the civilian administration in favor of a system reminiscent to the absolute power wielded by the monarchs of old.\n\nBacking this fringe group instead of the ever loyal Winter Qalam would be risky and unpopular not just with the TBT, but with the nation at large. An argument could be made that it would go against the core principles of harmony. Still, for the reigning princess it was a chance, one as rare as the ray of the sun falling down at a perfect angle to pierce the sweet spot on a statue, to achieve something truly incredible."

aestloniamonarchy.6.t:0 "Clean-Up Routine"
aestloniamonarchy.6.d:0 "Even if marshal Golden Sayif somewhat came around over recent months, she did not shy from expressing her opinions directly, even to the princess.\n\n"Your Majesty, it is very simple. Each zealot we arrest becomes a source for Windigo insanity and a drain on our resources." Although she was clearly agitated, the deeply ingrained instincts caused Golden to stand at attention. "I cannot advise you to continue down this path."\n\n"I do hear you well, lady marshal. But you are surely not suggesting that we execute every potential member of the Millenary Path." Zaida kept a more diplomatic tone.\n\n"Not potential ones, no. Just those that are definitively in the ranks." The answer was completely nonchalant. "It's not like we lack evidence or confessions."\n\n"And my answer would remain "no" even with this... judicial restriction. Our people deserve a reprieve from bloodshed and violence. We must try to bring the wayward souls back to society, and as a ruler I must set an example for mercy and forgiveness." Speaking assertively the princess rose up from her chair. "This is my final decision."\n\n"Understood." Outwardly Golden did not flinch. "I would also like to report that one of the high-ranking cultists, a mare known as Snowstorm, remains at large with no tangible leads. This warrants increasing security, especially at court."\n\nZaida considered the advice briefly. The conclusion was unsurprising: she could not afford to appear scared now, as it would undermine her redemption and reconciliation message."
aestloniamonarchy.6.a:0 "Luckily, the marshal could endure another small disappointment."
aestloniamonarchy.7.t:0 "Blood of the Covenant"
aestloniamonarchy.7.d:0 "The convention dictated that the royal appointments set in the capital were to be held exclusively at the palace, to ensure the level of splendor appropriate to the situation. This was another notion Zaida was quite happy to dispose of, and most of the younger nobles were equally glad to support her. For this reason, her meeting with princess Ntrôm, a scion of the pre-exodus Maregyptian nobility, took the form of a trot through the crown domain, a pine forest on the edges of the city. Walking gracefully underneath the ancient, mighty trees, they quickly delved into a conversation.\n\n"You honor me, Your Majesty. Such interest in our legacy means a lot by itself, but a government position..." Smiling sincerely, Ntrom bowed without interrupting the gait. "It would be wonderful to apply my talents for the good of our homeland."\n\n"Your help will be invaluable, dear cousin." Zaida skillfully returned the gesture. "With you and the Aesgyptian Movement at my side, I believe that our nation is destined for a grand revival."\n\n"The Movement, you say?" The smile turned colder than the snow beneath their hoofs in an instant. "This is quite a surprise. I thought them to be rather beneath our position."\n\n"They share the vision of greater Aestlonia, do they not? A natural ally for our cause - of course, if there is anything I should know, I would appreciate your advice." Surprised, Zaida slowed down a bit.\n\n"Oh, they might be useful if properly applied. My issue is with the lack of merit in their leader." After scoffing indignantly, Ntrôm hurried to thaw back. "He is of no great concern. Your Majesty's control will ensure that. Now how about we talk about some ideas I bore for this possibility?""

aestloniamonarchy.8.t:0 "Water of Womb"
aestloniamonarchy.8.d:0 ""You are a hard pony to get a hold of, prince." Zaida examined the stallion in front of her with great curiosity concealed by the usual mask of properness. His manner of dress, brightly colored and adorned with gold, attracted attention easily, but she was more intrigued to learn the real character of the Aesgyptian Movement’s leader.\n\n"As soon as I knew that our ideas were acknowledged and services required, Your Majesty, I made it my utmost priority to appear before you." With a stately nod, Pikhimphe caused his jewelry to ring softly. "I would like to believe that our exchange of letters entertained you in the meanwhile".\n\n"You would be correct." Throughout the past months, she had discerned a lot of passion in the polite words inkled in a stylized pseudo-Maregyptian script. Even before this first physical meeting he was not afraid to slowly but surely promote his ideas, some of which could be generously decried as too radical in the eyes of society. "We have a lot to discuss, and we need to bring noble Ntrôm up to speed."\n\nPikhimphe's reaction perfectly mirrored the one caused by the mention of him recently, but he followed it with a succinct explanation. "Ah, my dearest sister."\n\n"I was not aware of your familial relationship." Maintaining impassiveness, Zaida took a mental note to scold the intelligence office for this gap in her knowledge.\n\n"It is not a secret per se, my princess." He  glanced away for a moment. "She went to significant pains to distance herself from her own creation after it proved to be bolder than her. As I was left to lead this unjustly abandoned idea, I did not have a chance to change her mind among all my duties. The possibility to do so is most welcome.""

From arithmetic or the basics of science to botany and cold crafts, it was a rare class when the foals in his care would leave without learning anything new, and that simple fact kept Glace going. Similarly, his skill at explaining Aestlonian grammar, while not outstanding, was rather adequate.\n\nHowever, he started to question both his linguistics and pedagogy skills after the government imposed a new policy regarding these subjects. The new tongue, the new script, the new set of rules, all "Maregyptian-inspired", could be more aptly described as headache-inducing.\n\n"Mister Berry, sir?" Noticing his prolonged confusion, the student at the blackboard called out to him as tactfully as possible. "Do you think this is correct?"\n\nGlace lowered his eyes to the handbook on the table, then raised them to the chalk scribbles, trying to compare two indecipherable strings of foreign symbols with little success.\n\n"I don't f..."

She can't help but feel everything she did up to this point was self-serving, but she decides there's no point in worrying about it now.

The room they met in is a large lavishly decorated room with many details in gold and a large table in the middle. After properly bowing and greeting Zaida, the Prince shows her and the whole room his plan, that plan being to fulfill Zaida's dream of unifying Hestraya, but, that's not the end, that's only the start, since from there he suggests "making our way north" to Maregypt, with a final goal of "retaking" the homeland and making Zaida the Queen of those lands, fully abandoning Hestraya in the process. Zaida is speechless, she tries looking at Ntrôm for support but it seems even the more moderate Princess isn't opposing this crazy plan.

Raud believes this is important due to Raske being a military pony who even studied in Stalliongrad for tank-related research, therefore she thinks that Raske could possibly help to protect Zaida. The meeting goes a little different than Raud had hoped, Raud knows that Raske isn't the most normal and stable of ponies, but she at least hoped she would behave herself, but those hopes were frustrated. Raske ends up going out of her way to mess with Raud by "flirting" with Zaida. Even dropping the line "I normally wouldn't give some reactionary royal the time of day, but if I have to have someone stepping one me at least let a pretty pony princess be the one to do so."

Zaida's mother didn't attempt to rekindle this idea at any point, seeing that it would only bring unwanted hostility towards their allies in the north and the horses to the east, but Zaida is determined to see this happen, it will be THE thing that will prove her worth as a Princess and what would make her mother proud, or at the very least impressed.

Clearly they are ignorant to the needs of their own people, too busy shaking hooves with Equestria one must assume. In the back of her mind Zaida knows what she is about to do is wrong, that she should just drop the issue and pretend that everything is fine, that she could even end up hurting her own sister by accident, but even as the voices grew louder Zaida had already given the invasion order and the formal declaration of war over the radio."

After he is gone Sayif slowly grabs and unsheathes a long sword that she had layed upon a table nearby inside of the generously-sized the two find themselves inside. The cultist simply looks coldly at Sayif, only blinking when the mare swung the sword at her direction, Storm gets mildly suprised by the fact she's still alive and unharmed after she opens her eyes, with the only thing that changed being that her ropes have been cut. Before the cultist can even act confused Sayif tosses her a different sword, by reflect the other pegasus quickly grabs the object with one of her wings. Sayif then commands Storm to stand up, saying she won't kill a mare in such a cowardly way, since she's better than the cultist and her flock, instead they will have a fair battle of skill, with the winner being the one left standing by the end. Storm surprisingly cracks a slight grin at this offer of battle and nods in agreement. The battle is very brief, Sayif has much more control and skill with a sword than Storm ever had, this being because Sayig used to love "playing knight" when she was younger, even got imported Griffonian books when she was older just to study the art of the sword and the knights. Meanwhile Storm only ever used daggers, and that being against ponies who couldn't fight back."

Soon this new teacher starts talking about how crucial it is to know about the position of the army in the politics of the nation, this teacher points to the low-ranking pony and asks him what this position is. The pony scoffs as this one is easy, he says that the army shouldn't mess with the politics of a nation, that was day 1 stuff, to always be neutral and to always defend the country no matter what. The teacher quite loudly says that he is wrong and that is this type of thinking that allows for cowards and psychos to come to power as the army will always protect them. The teacher tells the pony to study more, specifically the new material that was introduced into the camp.

But what happens is anything but, instead he is demoted due to his power-hungry tendencies and his clear disrespect towards the civilian parts of the government. The official demoting him tells him that it's day 1 stuff that army officials should not get involved in politics, no matter what government has taken over, therefore he is being punished for ignoring that simple directive multiple times."

She had worked hard to stabilize the situation in her new Republic, extra hard when she actually was elected, and this was her reward, a fully war-ready nation. Politics have been mostly stabilized, at least to the point Sayif cared about, now it was time to secure Hestraya before moving to the last step of the Yeti pacification plan. The invasions against the remaining nations of Hestraya is a certainty, it will only take a few weeks to get ready and launch them."

aestloniasayif.10.d:0 "##TODO, to say Aestlonia was ever a peaceful nation would be incorrect, but at no point was the government so focused on drumming up support and funding warfare. In this event we see army ponies marching down a popular street in a big Aestlonia town, even dragging some artillery pieces wit them. Alongside them there are other lower-ranking ponies who are handing out pamphlets telling the populace about the coming war for Hestraya and why they should either join the army or buy bonds to support it. Some ponies in the audience seem a little offput by this, but the majority seems pretty supportive."

Sayif has actually accomplished her ambitions of uniting Hestraya, something that the Princess was never able to do. It made the usually cold mare feel warm inside as she knew that used to be Zaida's dream, yet that cultist-lover would have to live with the fact that the pony who's warnings she ignored was the one to do it. She knew she would need to focus on the next step of the plan soon, but there's time for a little gloating with a side of champagne. Champagne is something Sayif never liked, way too fancy for a mare like her, but this one time she would allow herself to enjoy it."

It had been a long time since she was this happy about anything, there is even a little bounce to her step as she trots around the room. The war against the Yetis has started, and that's enough to fully defrost her unfeeling heart. The mare grabs what's left of that bottle of champagne she drank during the unification of Hestraya, she doesn't care for a fancy glass, instead she drinks it from the bottle instead until it's fully empty, all in a single breath. After she's done she throws the bottle at the ground and watches it break. Sayif refuses to stay inside while this is happening, she will go to the frontlines, she doesn't care if she dies in the process of this invasion, since even if she does, she will at least be able to drag some Yetis to the grave with her."

After the victory she was quick to move her administration to the so-called "Rainband", she wants there to be no chance of any Yeti taking this place back any time soon, this means she has to keep a very watchful eye over this cursed place. But that isn't the only reason, a good part of this decision was only because she wanted to show the world she had triumphed, while also further breaking the morale of the Yetis by showing that they had lost to a puny pony and were now "led" by one. Sayif can barely contain her overflowing emotions, she decides it's best to take a walk so she can clear her mind and figure out her next steps from here, these walks are a common thing for her. Some would say that this is a dangerous idea considering where Sayif is now located, but the mare's mind is too fogged by the feeling of victory to realize that."

Sayif is able to put quite the fight against the beast, showing that she isn't a pony to be thrown around, but ultimately loses to him as he simply is more physically strong and tall. Sayif ends up with her back against the ground, the mare closes her eyes and even cracks a bit of a smile, almsot like she's accepting that she fought a fair battle and lost, and now she's getting her just punishment of death. She's now just waiting for the final blow."

She asks what he thinks he is doing by just standing there, she even gives him yet again another clear order to just end their fight by killing her, as it was supposed to be, but the creature just gives his back to her. Sayif gets furious and jumps to her four hooves like she hadn't just been in a fight, telling him to never give his back to her and demands to know what is his deal. This causes the creature to turn his attention towards her and approach the pony, he then pulls out a quite damaged piece of paper that he was hiding under his armor and hands it to Sayif who picks it with a wing. She checks the piece of paper handed to her and soon realizes it is a drawing, pictured in this drawing is the bust of a pony, one with a broken horn and a scar across one of her eyes. Sayif glances over at the Storm Creature, having to strain her neck a bit to be able to make eye contact, she asks who this is and why does it matter, the creature doesn't say a thing. Sayif makes a comment about how the creature doesn't talk much (mostly as a joke for herself in order to break the tension a bit) and therefore decides she will probably need to guess what this means."

This accusation causes the creature to show any kind of "expression" for the first time as he shakes his head. She asks if this was a rebel leader, the creature once again shakes his head as a response. Before she can ask again he simply points at Sayif and then points at the drawing. Sayif then finally connects the points and asks if this pony was some sort of commander, which the creature nods in response. Looking back at the drawing for some help she can't really figure out what armor the pony is wearing, it isn't one she remembers from any country around here, but soon she notices that it is a little similar to what the Storm King's yetis used to wear. Her final question then is if this pony was one of "their own", as in sided with the Storm King, the creature nods once more in a seemingly happy way. Before Sayif can make any more questions the creature simply pats her in the head and leaves, leaving the marshal a bit confused, but feeling a little inspired."

Instead she ponders back to the past encounter with that Storm Creature, bringing out the drawing of that pony once again from a internal pocket of her coat, she having kept it there ever since the encounter. Sayif stares at the drawing for a bit and thinks once more about the concept of a pony leading Yetis, maybe she could try to play a little nicer and lead these creatures? Maybe with her leadership she could direct their destructive potential into something better, something more. Sure, this clearly wasn't her original mission and the boys back at Hestraya might get mad at her slipping a bit into supremacy and yeti-tolerance, but she is the president and the marshal, only her opinion matters."

As of now the zebra is just sat at her office smiling to herself, she can barely wait to put everything into practice, even if it isn't exactly what the creatures of Aestlonia are expecting. But she knows to be slow, at least until she secures her homeland, after all liberating the Great Lakes is one of her main goals."

Amza assures Qalam that she will make it up to the harmonists when she has the chance and that she is fully committed to make it right for everyone, but as Amza says these words her eyebrows can't help but frown as if she's slightly annoyed to have to be doing this despite her friendly way of speaking.

Amza and Raud were never particularly close, so Amza already suspects something else to be at play, but still ends up going. At first it's just a normal enjoyable dinner with the ex-union leader, that until Raud asks Amza about a letter that the pony received earlier that day, the letter was basically a warning sent to Raud, telling her that Amza is not who she appears to be and that she is an enemy of everything that is good in the world. Raud questions if she knows what the letter is talking about or if it's just a prank, Amza's stripes almost turn white from her shock as she lunges forward and takes the letter from Raud's hooves, she tells the pony not to worry about it and that this is clearly some reactionary element trying to take her down, she assures Raud that she will find whoever sent this letter and will "take care" of them.

From this we learn that Amza did act very friendly and nice to the people there, but she quite clearly did not want to be there at all, and when the demands from the TBT started coming Amza had to control herself not to cry out of frustration, all those resources going into worthless projects and parties instead of her ultimate plan. But there's nothing she can do about it, for now."

aestloniaamza.5.d:0 "##TODO, Amza never thought much about Zaida, the zebra never hated the princess but she simply didn't find her a very interesting or inspiring figure, but these plans that she has found about uniting Hestraya under any means necessary are making her think a bit more fondly of the ex-princess, maybe she did have a fire inside her after all. But that doesn't really matter now, Zaida failed to keep her throne, it is now Amza's turn to make this a reality, even if it's with Amza's more war-loving way to go about it.

Amza smiles in return, but not her usual fake smile, but more of a wicked smile of mutual understanding and recognition, Sayif is quick to make one of her own in response. Amza reaches into a compartment of her desk and pulls out a expensive-looking bottle of wine, together with two wine glasses."

Just as she got her pamphlets and had just left her house a zebra saying they're from the government stopped her, they tell her they're from the Office of Internal Regulation and that her activities are too concerning to be allowed to continue as they clearly are made with the intent of weakening the presidency. The mare tries to explain herself, saying how this has nothing to do with whatever the zebra is implying, but the zebra is having none of it and simply forcefully grabs the pile of pamphlets from her magical aura, the zebra tells the pony if they're smart they will cease their activities from now on."

The door to her cell opened and she was expecting the worse, but was surprise when President Amza was just standing there before her, was she here to execute her herself? Amza then begins to speak, saying that her path to socialism requires a few more assets in order to function, one of said assets being a friendly right-leaning face for when the time comes for the next step, she then offers Alter her hoof, offering Alter the possibility of aiding her, saying that she can simply put to bed all the "conspiracy theories" about Alter being connected to the Path if she chooses to accept and play by the zebra's rules.

One of the members present, who call her "aunt" (they all do), asks what would be their orders, she tells them to bring more like-minded zebras from the Great Lakes, saying that she will deal with the paperwork to get them turned into citizens, they just need to convince them to move and offer a safe way to do so. When asked about funding Amza claims she will cover the costs, but that they should also be resourceful if the money isn't enough. When asked about how will the AGWU react about being replaced as the ruling party Amza simply states that it's normal in republics for presidents to change their party therefore it won't be a problem"

aestloniaamza.11.d:0 "##TODO, event where Amza and Snow Qalam meet, but not only the two of them, Amza also has brought a zebra with her, one that used to work for the Mazwi. This is due to the fact that Snow expressed concern over Amza's idea to start getting these ex-officials into Aestlonia, therefore Amza wants to soothe these worries. The zebra in question is a stallion, he acts in a really nice way towards Snow and promises that he is fully invested in the prospect of redeeming himself and making up for his mistakes, no matter the cost or punishment, Snow is still a little unsure about it, but due to how willing he seems to turn a new page she ends up buying what he's saying, after all Snow Qalam always had a thing when it comes to redeeming those deemed "too far gone", meanwhile Amza is just smiling to herself in the background, in a not so friendly or comforting way, but Qalam doesn't notice."

She had been ruling Aestlonia with a very watered down version of her ideology due to the fact the ponies simply weren't her main target, they were more a means to an end, she still considers them comrades, but only in a temporary kind of way, her main vision is not to make allies, it is instead to make the system she envisioned all the way back in the Mazwi lands, a true kind of socialism where everyone is fully equal, from opportunities and to freedoms, with no extravagance or luxury."

The presentation itself is very pleasant as images of the Great Lakes region are shown together with some nice contained live music, but the pony does get slightly concerned over some of the more antiquated and seemingly extremist stuff that is said by one of the speakers during the event. But then he stops to think, maybe he just thinks it's weird because of his own ignorance when it comes to these people, since up to now they have all been nice to him and he has only shown them distrust in return. All of the doubts that remained in his head were put to bed as he begun to smell a lovely aroma, certainly coming from some traditional food that was brought out for the attendees to enjoy."

She has been there since morning planning her next step, the previous months showed that ruling a country is not as simple as it seemed, so this time she will be prepared, nothing can be left unaccounted for. Thankfully Aestlonia and later Hestraya are more forgiving on any eventual mistakes and slip ups she ended and ends up making, but she knows she won't have such luxury when she finally reaches the Great Lakes.

This morning she had ordered that all communications with Hestraya will be cut as a temporary measure, she can't have them get in the way of what she wants to do here. She tells some loyal zebras to tell Hestraya that it was some natural disaster that brought some of radio towers down and that soon contact will be brought back, in a matter of weeks. This should give Amza enough time to truly transition the Great Lakes into what she envisioned, or at least begin the process of doing so.

The process had gone even better than what she had hoped, it didn't take much to get Alter to take over the special administration in Hestraya after Amza relocated to the Great Lakes, with this she had ensured that no do-gooder Hestrayan "hero" would get in the way of her great project. But now that barely matters in the mind of the zebra, what Amza is truly most excited about is to finally have the Great Lakes under her hoof. She has so many changes and reforms planned, some little, some large, but all equally as horrifying for those who don't know who Amza Outtara truly is. Well, they will have a lot of time to find out, and she is done playing the long pretend game.

First one is her own sister named Zia Outtara, an ex-sofa just like Amza who later turned into a bandit after the fall of the Mazwi, she has been given an official pardon by Amza in the condition that she would join her sister's project. The second is Azha Berahino, an old ally of Amza and the one that helped to found and now runs the Crimson Sun, she was a more "regular" slave that always loved to delve into the esoteric and superstitions as a whole. And finally you have Yoro Bakaba, being an ex-Mazwi military official, a Farima (generals - “brave men”), that felt convinced by Amza's promises and system, joining her movement near the time of the collapse of the Mazwi.

But now ones question remains in Amza's mind, she did bring this city back to its old glory, better than ever before even, therefore would it be too much to rename it in a way that respects who saved it?

Amza simply tells him in a very fake friendly way to "back off" and to not bring up that failure of a Manza to her ever again, she also states that she has her own plans for the crown at the moment. But before the scared zebra can leave Amza's presence she stops him, the smile on her face clearly not signalizing anything good or of pure intention. She demands that he stays just for a little longer, so he can help her decide on something. She states that she is torn between declaring herself the successor of Zondata, being the zebra responsible for much of the Mazwi's past greatness and expansion, also the one who formed the Sofa in the first place. Or, she could give herself the title of Manza, therefore making her the undisputed new legal monarch of the Mazwi and further removing power and legitimacy from any pretender, such as Mahud.

She will agree that their warriors were pretty decent, even caused a few of her own to fall during her pacification of the region, but it's clear that change is necessary. Either Amza could try to ally with some of these kingdoms so she can get her army trained by some of their warriors while also keeping the region divided, therefore making it harder for them to ever rebel as an united force, let them fight against each other.

But now there is a question of leadership, Verko might have been a capitalist, but maybe Amza could convince him to change?

Of course it isn't that simple, and Amza is far from being correct, but she does not care, she genuinely believes these zebras have been corrupted by the Yetis, and that the only way they can be saved is for a serious purification effort to be placed upon their lands, to purge every little bit of Yeti influence from their minds and households. It is very likely quite a few of them will die, but that is almost like a plus for the angry zebra.

Most would find it sad, but Amza finds it incredibly satisfying that she was able to put them down, much like the Mazwi of old, this proving her legitimacy over wielding the name. But now she needs to decide what to do with this place, logically she should just get rid of any references to the old Zughe dynasty, get Zao a new coat of paint that fits the new state.

From the sound of the conversation one could be forgiven for thinking that Amza would allow the dynasty to return and rule over their lands once more, but that was not the case, she truly wanted to nullify all royal titles relating to the Zefuwa as she believed having another crown inside her nation was a matter of concern, but, of course, she did not tell Gounama that, for now things would remain the same."

Slavery up to this point is already very much used by Amza, but now its situation as a practice has been truly finally cemented into society and the law with this decision, with no more loopholes being present to avoid it. She says this is a great victory for the entirety of Zebrica, as despite the effort from reactionary forces to stop it, the great revolutionary practice of forced labor has been secured, with she theorizing that in just a few years the Resurgent Mazwi State will become an example of the communist theory, being a state fully composed by workers."

But recently things have started growing sour in the town, the once friendly neighbors started acting more hostile to one another seemingly for no reason in the span of a few weeks, the word "traitor" was used quite a bit. The stallion did not understand what was happening, but soon he would get word that he had been "betrayed" by one of his neighbors, this news being given by a secret agent of the regime (the stallion does not know the one giving the news is connected to the regime). The agent says that he heard that they tried snitching on the stallion in exchange for easier workloads.

### Character Descs
AES_storm_alsaqie_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 3rd of September 971, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: It is not unheard of for a former royal guard to return to the court and serve in an honorary position. In the case of Storm Alsaqie, the story is not quite so simple. Officially, she was declared missing in action while patrolling skies over rural territories, only to resurface a few years later. She came back a changed mare, nursed back to health by the Millenary path, and inexplicably arose to lead her saviors. Despite her outward indifference to the past, the tales of her prior interest in the arcane and its connection to the "accident" circulate to this day.\n\nAs the guide of the cult, Storm embraced some of the trappings of modernity, actively inducting into the faith those who would be considered outsiders by the traditionally frontier-oriented believers. This, however, should not be mistaken for a change in the brutal nature of Windigo worshippers, but rather viewed as a convenient tool to spread the influence of their morbid masters.\n\nWith the successful recruitment of several prominent Aestlonians, Storm somewhat withdrew from the public eye, allowing new disciples to deal with mundane issues. Stranger still, the preacher is rarely seen by her followers, and her ice-cold voice joins only a select few ritual chants. Nonetheless, there is no doubt among the initiated regarding her final goal - she shall bring forth the utmost suffering to nourish those who hunger in the dark.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
AES_princess_zaida_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of May 987, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: Destined to become a princess from a very young age, Zaida ascended to the Aestlonian throne after the sudden death of her mother. While many of her subjects demonstrated steadfast loyalty to the new ruler, a vocal minority, including several skeptics from the royal advisory council, expressed doubts regarding her readiness to wield power over the land.\n\nRejecting the cautious option of assuaging their concerns, Zaida endeavors to take a more proactive and assertive approach to governance. With the survival of the country being the immediate goal, she seeks radical reforms to awaken Aestlonia from its stagnation and secure the future for years to come. Ultimately, her ambition extends to the creation of a united, powerful Hestrayan nation capable of defeating any threats.\n\nOf course, any bold action requires not only willfulness but also a degree of cunning. By maintaining a harmonious, regal facade and abstaining from bureaucratic or socialite distractions under the guise of utmost diligence, Zaida bides time and builds up strength, determined to surpass her ancestors and show that she is worthy of her title.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Scroup"
AES_winter_qalam_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 3rd of September 962, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: A trusted aide of the late Rawiya II and the chosen mentor of young princess Zaida, a prolific writer, and a celebrated politician - all these honorifics are carried by a single stallion named Winter Qalam. As the current representative of the "Towards a Better Tomorrow" party (or TBT, for short) within the Aestlonian Advisory Council, he strives to be a pillar of harmony in the country.\n\nThis desire is reflected both in his literary works, which promote a sense of unity between all thinking creatures, as well as in a soft-hooved, measured approach to governance. While he does not inspire the same zealous dedication to a single ideal unlike some leaders, and faces some criticism even within his faction, notably from the ardent republicans following his sister, Snow Qalam, Winter's non-confrontational methods and developed acumen provide a basis for cooperation across the ideological spectrum.\n\nIt is worth noting that his moral code is intertwined with and supported by devout belief in Dualism. Along with fellow adherents of this religious movement, Winter seeks to promote the core tenets of Charity and Brotherhood in the everyday lives of those around him, viewing these principles as means to ward off not only the evil in one's soul but also the tangible threat of Windigos.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
AES_golden_sayif_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of Novemeber 979, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: A fierce protector of Aestlonia from threats internal and external alike, field marshal Golden Sayif has not chosen the warrior's lot, but followed it with unbreakable determination. As a young filly, she lost her parents in a Windigo cultist attack, surviving due to the timely intervention of a militia squad. The veteran officer in command chose to adopt the orphan, raising her in strict discipline and sharing his values of honor and duty.\n\nWith this upbringing, the military became a second family to Golden, the only one she truly knew. After formally joining the ranks, she demonstrated impressive prowess and strong leadership skills, quickly climbing the hierarchy of the nascent Aestlonian army. Her resolute ways, pointed political neutrality and hard-earned trust of fellow soldiers made her a natural fit for the commanding position.\n\nHowever, her career only emboldened the deep-seated hatred she had for those who destroyed her life and continued to threaten her homeland. Despite the National Unity Act allowing the so-called Millenary Path to formally participate in governance, Golden watches every move of the cultists even more intensely than before, ready to beat back their corruption with an unrelenting force.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
AES_steel_raud_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of Novemeber 959, Jäised Märed province\n\n§YBiography§!: They say few ponies could portray the essence of the Aestlonian worker as well as Steel Raud. Coming from a remote mining village, she toiled underground for the good of the community from a young age. As the years went by, Raud grew to become remarkably strong and tall, easily towering over most others, and she took every opportunity to use her natural gifts to help those weaker or less fortunate.\n\nWhen the mine ran out and was finally closed, the young mare already got herself a bit of a reputation as a local hero, one always ready to provide support, care, and, indeed, physical assistance. Raud traveled from town to town in search of work for several years, never settling in one place, but meeting many like-minded creatures, especially in the rising socialist movements. By demonstrating a certain talent for management, she directed their energy away from singular acts of charity and into a more potent global action.\n\nFollowing the signing of the National Unity Act and formation of the Aestlonian General-Workers Union, Raud, now famous nationwide was elected as its director in a landslide victory despite any perceived drawbacks, notably including her pro-monarchy position. Under her continued leadership, the Union has been devoted to protecting and uplifting the workers, successfully improving their treatment and conditions to a notable degree.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Moonatik"
AES_cryo_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: Unknown\n\n§YBiography§!: "Mere creatures cannot begin to fathom the thoughts of an ice dragon."\n\nAccidentally found by Princess Zaida during a caving trip, the ice dragon known as Cryo dismissed the terrified pegasus and allowed her escape with indifference, only for her Highness to return days later with a panicking linguist. The ice dragon slowly learned Aestlonian, and these talks soon gave the Princess the idea for an offer.\n\n"He loves military planning," she told her fearful military officers about their newest lieutenant, "And he'll boost recruitment!"\n\nTo Cryo's credit, his strategies conducted in war exercises would merit promotions, but nopony considered convincing him, out of fear or futility, that his "military planning" was mostly logistic coordination.\n\nBeyond the military, the ice dragon cares little for politics and speaks even less of his homeland. One occasion a brave-enough subordinate asked what other ice dragons were like, and Cryo huffed. "I had horns," he snarled icily.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Littlepudel"
AES_alter_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 1st of August 954, Manehattan\n\n§YBiography§!: It would be fair to say that Alter, a scion of the Tähenduses family, prominent in the corporate circles of Manehattan, was expected to show business acumen. However, it quickly proved to be potent enough to put a price on morals, bringing in the extra income at the cost of most prospective partners.\n\nFrustrated with "bleeding-heart sentimentalists", Alter moved for cooler climes of Aestlonia, hoping for fewer regulations and underdeveloped worker rights. While she found those and then some, the whole fiscal situation proved to be too primitive for a real dealer, which did not deter her in the slightest. The self-made mare poured her skills into reshaping the local economic landscape, founding Kapitali Finance Center and even collaborating directly with Rawiya II on market reforms, up to having her hoof in the establishment of the central bank.\n\nDespite initial successes, the venture could be hardly called smooth sailing, especially with the recent scandal disconnecting Alter from her own company due to claims of fund appropriations for personal projects. She has refused to comment publicly on the matter and seemingly took a step back, but money talks, and the whispers bet on her inevitable return.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
AES_snowdrop_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of October 980, Järveääres\n\n§YBiography§!: The geographical location of Aestlonia determines many things, including the specifics of the roles employed by the royal court. In particular, it is the job of a pegasus by the name of Snowdrop to ensure that the weather management corps maintain a perfect balance between freezing, chilly, thawing and plain old cold.\n\nThroughout the years of service Snowdrop has been performing these duties diligently and with quiet pride in her aptitude. She prefers to work at night, when her weakened eyesight is not disturbed by aberrant lights and it is possible to fully focus on the art of wind and frost.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Opalradiance"
AES_kelpie_queen_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: First cycle of 759, New Coltlantis\n\n§YBiography§!: The customs of the underwater folk differ from those of surface-dwellers in many ways. The one who is called the Queen by other kelpies is not a monarch, but rather a symbolic unifying figure, chosen by the three largest tribes in a popular election.\n\nEven though the position came with a certain power to lead negotiations with the outsiders, few expected the Queen to proceed with a large-scale contact with Aestlonians and the ensuing great expansion of the city of Zarmarej. Driven by curiosity and kind-hearted nature, she was quite happy with the outcome and interested in continuing the experiment, yet the threat of the Storm King forced kelpies back to the sea.\n\nAfter his campaign of terror was over, the Queen spent countless hours convincing her kin to attempt another emergence to the strangers above. A compromise had to be made in the end - along with the most perceptive watchers she would observe Aestlonia, reaching out only if the neighbors would prove their moral worth by themselves. Thus, she stands a hopeful vigil, awaiting her chance to truly bridge the two worlds.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Anastafury"
AES_frosty_chisel_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 7th of February 984, Whinnyapolis\n\n§YBiography§!: Passions could carry a willing creature to the strangest places. In the case of Frosty Chisel, an Equestria native and a driven ice sculptor, her inspirations brought her down to Aestlonia, the land of long winters and hardy ponies.\n\nWhile she initially planned only a short stay, the warm welcome at the royal court as well as the amount of cold matter available made Frosty reconsider. By dutifully studying traditional carving techniques under local masters and carefully intertwining them with modern methods and her vision, she has made a bold statement in the craft, creating impressive monuments celebrating friendship and harmony. Now, she stands ready to do much more for her home away from home.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Opalradiance"
AES_tume_koletis_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of December 967, Koolkøn\n\n§YBiography§!: In ancient times, there was only one option to advance through the ranks of the cult which is currently known as Millenary Path - demonstrate unbound fierceness and savagery to garner the favor of the Windigos. While the faithful usually adopt a more reticent approach nowadays, the old ways live on.\n\nTume Koletis belongs to the dark fellowship of creatures proudly carrying them in their hearts. Experienced tracker, well-versed in pack tactics, and honored with the mark of a sacred huntmaster, he possesses an innate understanding of the brutality of war and a fervent desire to put it to use. The soldiers under him will not fight and kill - no, those unfortunate souls shall tear and slaughter their way to whichever goal is given to the bearer of the Crimson Skull.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Blakasmoko"
AES_princess_lumi_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 14th of January 981, Järveääres\n\n§YBiography§!: Despite the great diminishment of Aestlonian aristocracy during Sa'adle rule over the region, many noble families of yore survive to this day. Unsurprisingly, the scions of these bloodlines find themselves the need to adapt to the current realities, and while some are destined to final obscurity, Lumi is renowned across the country.\n\nA distant descendant of the rulers of Särav Org, one among dozens of tribal kingdoms making up ancient Hestraya, she is greatly inspired by the unprecedented cooperation and mutual trust between her ancestors and the common ponies under their guidance. Using her considerable education and social pull, Lumi champions worker rights, collaborating with more open-minded unions. Recently, she has gone so far as to enlist in the army to "fight for her people", resulting in volunteer and donation surges.\n\nAnother passion of hers is preserving the cultural legacy of old Aestlonia. By supporting archeologists and scholars as well as promoting exhibitions and teaching courses, Lumi pushes for greater recognition of this area from the government. With the noticeable successes for both causes, "everycreature's princess" is rumored to be involved in negotiations for an official position at the Ajloun court.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Stardustspix"
AES_pinekabi_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 9th of September 977, Asula Laht\n\n§YBiography§!: Many earth ponies hear the call of nature strongly. For Pinekäbi  this wild song has led him to the darkest depths, but then the very same melody lifted him to the light.\n\nFor a young stallion in rural Aestlonia, especially one with a certain adventurous streak, it was only a matter of time before the true power in the region, the Millenary Path, would take interest in their fate. He was inducted into the faith among many capable colts and fillies, but when faced with its deep macabre secrets, Pinekäbi  abandoned the cult. Fleeing eastward, he took up a remote position of a ranger at the tundra reservations and did his penance by protecting the forests from any threats.\n\nPinekäbi valiantly kept his oath during the Storm King invasion and subsequent Karkadannistani occupation, becoming a prominent resistance figure. Indeed, many partisan squads found shelter in his domain, as long as they were not foolish enough to disrespect it, and many more yetis and horses paid the price for trying to do exactly that.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Stardustspix"

Her unique background and ample natural charisma have propelled her to the heights of the newly formed AGWU, while the stories about her past have grown into a legend.

Although she cares little to confirm or deny any of them, comrade Outtara is known as a steadfast proponent of social reform and greater equality between all creatures.\n\nThere is, however, a twist to Amza's past and her understanding of "greater equality". During her own servitude, she was a slave hunter and reeducator, overseeing the integration of the thralls back into the system, one which she deemed natural, inevitable, and efficient. Thus, with the "liberation" of the Great Lakes, her true plan is revealed: she shall distill the old ways into an ultimate cycle of bondage and labor.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"

Despite the lack of a shared literary tradition between the generations of believers, ancient works of her predecessors remain, and Mustsurm eagerly hunts after them across the frozen forests and caves. This outwardly innocuous quest is twisted by the contents of the uncovered carvings, scrolls, and paintings, namely, dark rituals and lost methods for imposing anguish and misery on the yet unbroken souls.

Raske Nael, a fighter with a short fuse and a heavy hoof, hears its hymn within the grinding gears of machines, creaking of threads and revving of engines.\n\nHer early years were spent in the Aestlonian countryside, and they brought Raske nothing but dumb labor, a distaste for farming life and folk traditions, as well as an interest in brawling. An educated city doctor could call it "stress release", but she was simply happy to beat down an occasional thick-headed pony, especially a cultist, as these fools were quick to yap against her reformist ideals.\n\nWith no desire or reason to linger, Raske worked hard to afford a ticket for a ship west, to Stalliongrad, the promised land of social and scientific advancement for all. Shortly upon arrival, she enlisted with the army and demonstrated enough fervor and perseverance to be considered for the role of a tank commander, before a quarrel (allegedly involving sergeant Nael biting her commanding officer) caused her to be discharged. Since she was a foreigner, this closed any other opportunities, so she had to come back, embittered, yet not at all disillusioned with the marvels of technology. Seeking a new place, she joined one of the small working unions, followed it into the AWGU, and quickly became an established figure within the party's radical wing.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Ryanboi""

These cultists worship the Windigos and believe that the spirits' presence and strength grow with desolation and suffering. As a result, they have historically engaged in violent acts, including village attacks, terrorism, and sacrifices, aiming to invoke the Windigos' power.

Instead it's a temporary last-minute fix to the issue, this being brought upon due to the Karkadanni threat to the east. The APA is not political in nature, having little interest in ruling the nation in any way. But, their leader, Golden Sayif, has time and time again threatened the cultists of the Millenary Path.

That being the zebra known as Amza Outtara, an ex-slave of the Mazwi Empire that found refuge in Aestlonia after the collapse of the same.

Its primary goal was to unite the country and facilitate its reconstruction. To achieve this, the Act formalized proper political parties, while also granting representation and power to the Millenary Path. This was intended to ensure that all factions had a say in the country's governance in exchange for their cooperation.\n\nWhile the Act accelerated Aestlonia's recovery from the war, it now poses an obstacle to further political and economic reforms.

### Preparation tree Events ###
aestlonia.1.t:0 "The Path Forward"
aestlonia.1.d:0 "##TODO, event about how the path forward might be rough and slow, but it's required considering a Karkad invasion is more obvious day by day, the country can't be in a "political deadlock" anymore, Zaida needs to take stuff in her own hooves if she wants change, even if the parties may not like it."
aestlonia.1.a:0 "Something needs to be done."
aestlonia.2.t:0 "To Tartarus With It"
aestlonia.2.d:0 "##TODO, after some preliminary preparations Zaida declare the National Unity Act as null and void, saying it doesn't count anymore due to changing situations in the country and the need for action. The war with Karkad demands everything from us, we can't get stopped by politics."
aestlonia.2.a:0 "It's for the sake of our survival."
aestlonia.3.t:0 "The Reaction"
aestlonia.3.d:0 "##TODO, event about the different reactions of the parties in the advisory council session to Zaida ripping up the act, Winter Qalam, the leader of the TBT, is a little worried but doesn't complain and just trusts Zaida knows what she's doing. Steel Raud, the leader of the AGWU, couldn't be happier about it, believing this is the first step in getting this country in the right path. And, finally, Snowstorm, the person the cultists sent to represent themselves, is not happy about this, as it diminishes the power of the cult over the government. It's clear that politics will be left quite volatile and shaky after this."
aestlonia.3.a:0 "So be it."
aestlonia.4.t:0 "A Meeting With the Marshal"
aestlonia.4.d:0 "##TODO, event about Golden Sayif laying out a few emergency reforms necessary to the new provisional army and congratulating Zaida for forming it, making a point in saying that Aestlonia doesn't have much time to prepare and that the incoming war probably won't last long, bet it ending on a victory or not, so the princess should be mindful when deciding in what to invest in, as when the war is over it's unlikely the political factions will allow her this much freedom again. Golden also not so subtlely tells Zaida not to work with the cultists."
aestlonia.4.a:0 "You don't have to worry. I will not work with them."
aestlonia.4.b:0 "I cannot make such promises at this time."
aestlonia.6.t:0 "Meeting the Newbies"
aestlonia.6.d:0 "##TODO, event about Golden Sayif, the field marshal, meeting the new recruits, they're very badly trained and can barely do anything, leading to Golden having to shout them out to get them to follow her lead and respect her, a smile creeping on her face as they lose all their bravado, she already planning many painful exercises for all of them out in the cold. This event is after the player picks the focus of getting more manpower but at the cost of worse standards."
aestlonia.6.a:0 ""I'm going to have fun "training" you all.""
aestlonia.7.t:0 "An Army to be Proud Of"
aestlonia.7.d:0 "##TODO, event about Golden Sayif, the field marshal, meeting with some professionaly-trained soldiers, she's quite impressed by their form and their knowledge, even if she doesn't really show it. They once being part of the old Ajloun Brigade and everything, something she approves of, as she once helped to lead it. But is a little worried about their small amount, not being sure if this will be enough to beat back Karkad."
aestlonia.7.a:0 "Tricky situation."
aestlonia.8.t:0 "Meeting With Raud"
aestlonia.8.d:0 "##TODO, event about Zaida meeting with the leader of the national workers union, Steel Raud, and thanking her for the help she's providing for the war effort against Karkad in the way of some miner militias. Raud doesn't talk much, she is pretty cryptic and silent, also slightly imposing due to her size, but in the end it's clear Raud likes Zaida and wishes to work together with her in the future. Even joining the army as a general"
aestlonia.8.a:0 "Friendship sure is great."
aestlonia.9.t:0 "An Encounter to Remember"
aestlonia.9.d:0 "##TODO, event about a pony from the western tribe (estonian-speaking) meeting a pony from the central tribe (more standard uralic language speaker). At first they have a lot of trouble communicating, so instead they decide to use the snow and a stick to draw little pictures to communicate with one another. By the end of it they know they're going to be big friends, even if they don't understand a word of what the other is saying."
aestlonia.9.a:0 "A friendship that surpasses barriers."
aestlonia.10.t:0 "A New Page"
aestlonia.10.d:0 "##TODO, event about Zaida renaming the states and cities of Ajloun and Zarmarej to something that better represents the Aestlonian culture. As she writes down the edict that will officialy change the names Winter Qalam hovers over her shoulder, reassuring her that she's doing the right thing and that he will support her no matter what. She also changes another name, her own. But instead of getting rid of Zaida she simply gives herself a new surname. One that Qalam references in the option of the event."
aestlonia.10.a:0 ""Or, as I should say. Princess Zaida Lumesadu.""
aestlonia.11.t:0 "Course Selection"
aestlonia.11.d:0 "##TODO, even about deciding who to cooperate with in the war to come. Either Zaida decides to give the cultists a chance to their knowledge of warfare and battle or she sticks with the harmonists and socialists of the AGWU. It's clear she doesn't want to choose the cultists, but she also believes that their help might be needed to win."
aestlonia.11.a:0 ""I will never work with those savages.""
aestlonia.11.b:0 ""If it's for the good of Aestlonia...""
aestlonia.12.t:0 "A Silent Meeting"
aestlonia.12.d:0 "##TODO, event where Zaida and Storm meet-up to discuss and sign the Lumetorm Pact. Storm doesn't say a single word for the entire encounter, simply just pushes forwards her conditions written down in a piece of paper towards Zaida with her hoof. The princess tries to do small talk and even tell Storm to control her men. But seems like the cult leader is either not listening or just plainly ignoring Zaida. One thing that Zaida does add to the pact is that it will only last until the victory against Karkad"
aestlonia.12.a:0 ""Let's just get this over it.""
aestlonia.13.t:0 "Aestlonia Demands our Surrender"
aestlonia.13.d:0 "##TODO, event where Aestlonia demands the returnal of their lands from Karkad after capturing the states, also asking them to return the Maretonian lands to Maretonia in exchange for peace, this is an event Karkad gets, and, it's down the path where Aestlonia waited to be attacked, instead of attacking first."

aestlonia.15.t:0 "Kabja Returns from Arabia"
aestlonia.15.d:0 "##TODO, event about the cultist Fierce Kabja returning from his little "volunteer action" in the Arabian civil war. It's clear he did it as some form of "sport", not really because he wanted to help any side of the civil war win. The army is keeping an eye on him as he's considered somewhat dangerous due to his infamy as the "Butcher of Äji Syöär" and for being a cultist."
aestlonia.15.a:0 "Keep an eye over that one."
aestlonia.16.t:0 "Victory!"

aestlonia.17.d:0 "##TODO, (EQS POV), event that Equestria receives, in this one it talks about Aestlonian diplomats arriving in Equestria and politely asking for material or volunteer support for their conflict with Karkad."
aestlonia.17.a:0 "We can spare some equipment."
aestlonia.17.b:0 "Let those who want to fight go."
aestlonia.17.c:0 "We're not in the position to share anything."
aestlonia.18.t:0 "Equestria Accepts!"
aestlonia.18.d:0 "##TODO, event about negotiations being a success and Equestria agreeing to send some rifles, support equipment, and even artillery, as well as some minor economic help."
aestlonia.18.a:0 "Celestia saw reason."
aestlonia.19.t:0 "Equestria Denies our Request"
aestlonia.19.d:0 "##TODO, event about Equestria refusing to help, saying they can't spare anything at the moment, specially for a foreign war that does not concern them."
aestlonia.19.a:0 "Unfortunate."
aestlonia.20.t:0 "Cultists Threaten to Attack Zarmarej!"
aestlonia.20.d:0 "##TODO, event about Millenary Path cultists Threatening to attack the city of Zarmarej a few days after Zaida abolishes the National Unity Act, it clearly being a direct response to it and a way of revenge by the part of the cultists, since now their control over the governance has been compromised. But, not only that, with the Act gone they also aren't obligated to follow the agreements of the Act, one being they would stop the attacks on cities. They seem to be holding back from the attack for now. Likely waiting for some sort of deal."
aestlonia.20.a:0 "Someone has to stop these maniacs! Defend the city!"
aestlonia.20.b:0 "Offer them concessions!"
aestlonia.21.t:0 "Cultist Protest Over Development"
aestlonia.21.d:0 "##TODO, event about the cultist complaining about the government's effort to build infrastructure over areas of the Aestlonian wilderness. The cultists say this interferes with their way of life and that the government must do something to make it right, this basically being the cultists asking for money and more power."
aestlonia.21.a:0 "We don't negotiate with the likes of them anymore."
aestlonia.21.b:0 "If it keeps them quiet."
aestlonia.22.t:0 "Consequences"
aestlonia.22.d:0 "##TODO, event about the Aestlonian economy crashing after the war with Karkad has finished, with the over-militarization falling over itself as the war concluded, not only that but politics are now more unstable than ever as without the war to keep the political factions busy they're now demanding changes."
aestlonia.22.a:0 "Can we talk this out?"
aestlonia.23.t:0 "War Looming!"
aestlonia.23.d:0 "##TODO, (AES or MTO POV) Karkad is going to invade soon! What do we do?"
aestlonia.23.a:0 "Prepare for the worst!"
aestlonia.24.t:0 "The Weirdest Meeting"
aestlonia.24.d:0 "##TODO, event about Zaida going to meet up with the cultist Fierce Kabja. She goes with Winter Qalam and a few army detachments for safety reasons. They meet at the edge of the forest where Kabja is based off of. The conversation starts normal enough with him saying he will help the army with the knowledge he got from fighting in Arabia. But then he quickly starts to try to "charm" Zaida. The princess clearly isn't into it, and after Winter Qalam, the most peace-loving stallion, almost decks Kabja in the face, the meeting is cut a little short."
aestlonia.24.a:0 "Should have stayed in Arabia."
aestlonia.25.t:0 "Meet Your New Battlebuddies"
aestlonia.25.d:0 "##TODO, event about a city-folk army stallion being sent to train about wilderness survival with a couple of cultists. They bully and make fun of him very hard due to his lack of knowledge about anything relating to surviving in the wild."
aestlonia.25.a:0 "I don't like these ponies."
aestlonia.26.t:0 "A Worrisome Display"
aestlonia.26.d:0 "##TODO, event where the cultist called Snowstorm does a speech infront of an audience of many other cultists. But, this audience is mostly compromised of regular army ponies. The field marshal of Aestlonia, Golden Sayif, is also present. Said marshal had the plan to shoot Snowstorm with her revolver, not caring if Zaida likes it or not. But she's left completely dumbfounded as even some of her own troops start cheering Snowstorm on and stomping their hooves in animosity after the end of her speech. Making her completely forget about the assassination idea."
aestlonia.26.a:0 "I didn't think it had gotten this bad."
aestlonia.27.t:0 "Choosing a Favorite"
aestlonia.27.d:0 "##TODO, Event after the focus about deciding to ally the cultists. In here she refused to do so and is now deciding on who she should ally with. Having the options of going with her government and support base of the TBT or going with the miners and the union members of the AGWU."
aestlonia.27.a:0 ""The TBT hasn't done me wrong yet.""
aestlonia.27.b:0 ""The workers need their princess.""
aestlonia.28.t:0 "Meeting With the Guard"
aestlonia.28.d:0 "##TODO, event where Zaida meets up with the newly deployed royal guards. They don't say a word as she walks down the hallway observing how many ponies are willing to fight and die for her. This causing her to get a little emotional, giving them an umprompted and unprepared little happy emotional speech about how they are going to win this."
aestlonia.28.a:0 "For Zaida!"
aestlonia.29.t:0 "The Nonpartisan Speech"
aestlonia.29.d:0 "##TODO, event where Winter Qalam, Zaida and Steel Raud are present, Winter and Steel being in either side of Zaida, with the princess right in the middle. The speech goes from Winter, to Raud, before ending with Zaida's part. The speech is all about how Aestlonia will and has to win this war, about how party-alliance doesn't matter at this crucial moment and how there is a real need to show Karkad what we're made of."
aestlonia.29.a:0 "For Aestlonia!"
aestlonia.30.t:0 "Equestria Sends Volunteers!"
aestlonia.30.d:0 "##TODO, a group of armed ponies have arrived at the port in our capital. At first our port authorities almost got into a conflict with them thinking they were some kind of clever invasion from Karkad, but after a quick conversation they told us they came from Equestria to fight for our cause. All with equipment lended to them by the Equestrian state."
aestlonia.30.a:0 "To victory!"
aestlonia.31.t:0 "Miners Request to Join the Fight"
aestlonia.31.d:0 "##TODO, a substantial group of miners have requested that they be allowed to fight in the soon approaching war alongside the army. They seem honest to their word and truly seem to only want to help defend their homeland. Event is framed by an old miner stallion approaching a military outpust and making the request alongside "his" group."
aestlonia.31.a:0 "Patriots are always welcomed."
aestlonia.31.b:0 "We can't let them get influence."
aestlonia.32.t:0 "A Reassurance"
aestlonia.32.d:0 "##TODO, even where Princess Lumi and Princess Ntrôm comfort and reassure Zaida after she starts worrying about the fact she comes from a traditional arab family unlike the two princesses who actually come from a more "true" Aestlonian background, even saying they should probably be the ones in charge in a offhand comment. They assure her that she's the correct princess of Aestlonia, and that she only has to follow her heart."
aestlonia.32.a:0 "We need to lift our heads in these trying times."
aestlonia.33.t:0 "The Glorious Coup"
aestlonia.33.d:0 "##TODO, due to Zaida's decision to sign a pact with the cultist the field marshal Golden Sayif has marched on the capital with a detachment of the army and has therefore declared a new military provisional rule for the nation until the situation stabilizes. Promises were also made about the establishment of a republic as the monarchy has failed the Aestlonian people."

### Coup-tree events ###
aestloniacoup.1.t:0 "Republic Declared"
aestloniacoup.1.d:0 "##TODO, despite the worries and protests from the public, Golden Sayif has made true on her promise and has declared the republic. This, however, doesn't mean the elections will happen right away, instead she promises to allow elections when she believes the country, situation and it's people are stable enough to be able to survive such an election. Golden Sayif promises that Zaida is safe and that she will remain safe, citing that she nor the army are "heartless communists" and that they wish for the ex-princess to be able to live a safe normal life."
aestloniacoup.1.a:0 "Uncertain freedom."
aestloniacoup.2.t:0 "A "New" Face"
aestloniacoup.2.d:0 "##TODO, event about a new party being declared, this party being the FNP, the Faith and Nation Party. Their leader is the ex-businessmare known as Alter Tähenduses. The mare once was a very important figure within the nation at a time in it's history. Being part of the Financial Center and helping to build much of Aestlonia's economy, later she would be disconnected from the Center due to rumors of embezzlement. Ever since then she hasn't been politically active, so the declaration of this "nationalist" party has come as a bit of a surprise. Some even say that this might just be a front for the cultists in the political scene of the new republic."
aestloniacoup.2.a:0 "Their faces don't even burn."
aestloniacoup.3.t:0 "New Winds for the TBT"
aestloniacoup.3.d:0 "##TODO, event about Winter Qalam stepping down as the leader of the TBT as the republican wing led by his Equestrian-minded sister becomes more prevalent with the change in regime. The TBT still denounces the coup, but are willing to work in the new system as Zaida's actions during the Karkad war are hard to fully defend. Snow Qalam, Winter's sister, takes inspiration from many arab republican movements, as well as Equestria's system and ideas about harmony and friendship. Some would say to an utopian and extreme end."
aestloniacoup.3.a:0 "Nothing truly goes away."
aestloniacoup.4.t:0 "A Revolution Within Itself"
aestloniacoup.4.d:0 "##TODO, event about Steel Raud stepping down as leader of the AGWU in light of recent events, instead giving power to the zebra Amza Outtara. She's equally as liberal as Raud, but is known for being more utopic and less of a realist when compared to the pony. Her ex-slave backstory inspired many to throw their support behind her, including Raud herself who always saw the zebra as her number 2."
aestloniacoup.4.a:0 "Socialists and power changes..."
aestloniacoup.5.t:0 "The Consequences of War"
aestloniacoup.5.d:0 "##TODO, event that explains that even though we got rid of Zaida it doesn't mean that the economic and political problems caused by her will go away. We will still need to work to fix them."
aestloniacoup.5.a:0 "Zaida's legacy haunts us."
aestloniacoup.6.t:0 "The Promise"
aestloniacoup.6.d:0 "##TODO, event about how Golden Sayif's promise was that she would give the country elections soon enough as part of the establishment of the republic, and she plans to make true on that promise. She knows she doesn't have much time to organize or to prepare for them, and she can't delay them either or she would basically be asking for a popular revolt. But, even then, she still has a limited amount of time where she could give a bit of a help to one of the parties to aid them in winning the upcoming elections if she chooses to do so. She believes is her mission to leave Aestlonia in good hooves, even if it means running and getting elected herself as president if push comes to shove."
aestloniacoup.6.a:0 "The clock is ticking."
aestloniacoup.7.t:0 "A Royal Offer"
aestloniacoup.7.d:0 "##TODO, event about Royal Defender visiting Zaida and telling her he has loyalists in all major positions in Sayif's so-called republic as well as readied troops in key cities and locations around the country. Telling her that if she wants her throne back he would be more than willing and capable of granting her that wish, also promising it would take less than a couple of hours to do so. Zaida turns down the offer, saying she would never resort to such a thing. Instead she reveals to Defender that she will throw her hat in the ring, promising to directly compete in the future elections and also requesting that Defender spreads the word about her decision."
aestloniacoup.7.a:0 "She can just do that?"

####### Historical tree events ########
aestloniahistorical.1.t:0 "The Continuation"
aestloniahistorical.1.d:0 "##TODO, event about Zaida being happy about being kept as princess and about Winter Qalam staying with her as her advisor. He is also happy but points out to the fact that the new Hestrayan state will have to deal with the impacts of the hasty unification, namely with the army and it's doctrines.

While she's "depressed thinking" she walks down the shoreline of a quiet beach in Merelinn, soon the princess hears a sound coming from the water and gets a bit spooked when a creature jumps out at her when she comes closer to investigate."

aestloniakelpie.2.t:0 "Voice of the Ocean"

After Zaida calms down the queen exchanges some words with Zaida, mostly being curious to what happened to Aestlonia and Zarmarej (not aware of the renaming of the latter) since the kelpies left, all the while Zaida can't believe her eyes, as she never had seen a real Kelpie before. Near the end of the event the queen talks about a "proposal/deal" she wants to do with Zaida. Which peeks the interest of the princess."

Therefore she makes the suggestion that Zaida rule together with her and vice-versa. She believing this is the best way to deal with her issue and make Zaida and her nation "feel better" in a metaphorical sense. At first Zaida goes along with it pretty well, that until the Queen says they will marry each other to officiate the deal, this gets Zaida pretty flustered before the Queen once again calms her down, saying that in Kelpie society marriage isn't even a concept, and this would just be a political thing."

### Leader Descs
AES_storm_alsaqie_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 3rd of September 971, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: Despite the recent government efforts to reform the Millenary Path into a proper political force, very little is known about their current leader, Storm Alsaqie. It is understood that she originally came from the capital and became one of the first few city dwellers to be accepted into the group. More macabre rumors claim that the tooth she wears on a necklace belongs to her first sacrifice, a yeti warrior, and that her ascension was paved by scores of other bloody offerings.\n\nAs the guide of the cult, Storm embraced some of the trappings of modernity, actively inducting into the faith those who would be considered outsiders by the traditionally frontier-oriented believers. This, however, should not be mistaken for a change in the brutal nature of Windigo worshippers, but rather viewed as a convenient tool to spread the influence of their morbid masters.\n\nWith successful recruitment of several prominent Aestlonians, Storm somewhat withdrew from the public eye, allowing new disciples to deal with the mundane issues. Stranger still, the preacher is rarely seen by her own followers, and her ice-cold voice joins only a select few ritual chants. Nonetheless, there is no doubt among the initiated regarding her final goal - she shall bring forth the utmost suffering to nourish those who hunger in the dark.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
AES_princess_zaida_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of May 987, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: Destined to become princess from a very young age, Zaida ascended to the Aestlonian throne after the sudden death of her mother. While many of her subjects demonstrated steadfast loyalty to the new ruler, a vocal minority, including a number of skeptics from the royal advisory council, expressed doubts regarding her readiness to wield power over the land.\n\nRejecting the cautious option of assuaging their concerns, Zaida endeavors to take a more proactive and assertive approach to governance. With the survival of the country being the immediate goal, she seeks radical reforms to awaken Aestlonia from its stagnation and secure the future for years to come. Ultimately, her ambition extends to the creation of a united, powerful Hestrayan nation capable of defeating any threats.\n\nOf course, any bold action requires not only willfulness, but also a degree of cunning. By maintaining a harmonious, regal facade and abstaining from bureaucratic or socialite distractions under the guise of utmost diligence, Zaida bides time and builds up strength, determined to surpass her ancestors and show that she is worthy of her title.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Scroup"
AES_winter_qalam_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 3rd of September 962, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!:  A trusted aide of the late Rawiya II and the chosen mentor of young princess Zaida, a prolific writer and a celebrated politician - all these honorifics are carried by a single stallion named Winter Qalam. As the current representative of the "Towards a Better Tomorrow" party (or TBT, for short) within the Aestlonian Advisory Council, he strives to be a pillar of harmony in the country.\n\nThis desire is reflected both in his literary works, which promote a sense of unity between all thinking creatures, as well as in a soft-hooved, measured approach to governance. While he does not inspire the same zealous dedication to a single ideal unlike some leaders, and faces some criticism even within his own faction, notably from the ardent republicans following his sister, Snow Qalam, Winter’s non-confrontational methods and developed acumen provide a basis for cooperation across the ideological spectrum.\n\nIt is worth noting that his moral code is intertwined with and supported by devout belief in Trifectism. Along with fellow adherents of this religious movement, Winter seeks to promote the core tenets of Charity, Empathy, and Brotherhood in everyday lives of those around him, viewing these principles as means to ward off not only the evil in one’s soul, but also the tangible threat of Windigos.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
AES_golden_sayif_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of Novemeber 979, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: A fierce protector of Aestlonia from threats internal and external alike, field marshal Golden Sayif has not chosen the warrior’s lot, but followed it with unbreakable determination. As a young filly, she lost her parents in a windigo cultist attack, surviving due to the timely intervention of a militia squad. The veteran officer in command chose to adopt the orphan, raising her in strict discipline and sharing his own values of honor and duty.\n\nWith this upbringing, the military became a second family to Golden, the only one she truly knew. After formally joining the ranks, she demonstrated impressive prowess and strong leadership skills, quickly climbing the hierarchy of the nascent Aestlonian army. Her resolute ways, pointed political neutrality and hard-earned trust of fellow soldiers made her a natural fit for the commanding position.\n\nHowever, her career only emboldened the deep-seated hatred she had for those who destroyed her life and continued to threaten her homeland. Despite the National Unity Act allowing the so-called Millenary Path to formally participate in governance, Golden watches every move of the cultists even more intensely then before, ready to beat back their corruption with an unrelenting force. \n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
AES_steel_raud_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of Novemeber 959, Jäised Märed province\n\n§YBiography§!: They say there are few ponies that could portray the essence of Aestlonian worker as well as Steel Raud. \n\nComing from a remote mining village, she toiled underground for the good of the community from a young age. As the years went by, Raud grew to become remarkably strong and tall, easily towering over most others, and she took every opportunity to use her natural gifts to help those weaker or less fortunate.\n\nWhen the mine ran out and was finally closed, the young mare already got herself a bit of a reputation as a local hero, one always ready to provide support, care, and, indeed, physical assistance. Raud traveled from town to town in search of work for several years, never settling in one place, but meeting many like-minded creatures, especially in the rising socialist movements. By demonstrating a certain talent for management, she directed their energy away from singular acts of charity and into a more potent global action.\n\nFollowing the signing of the National Unity Act and formation of the Aestlonian General-Workers Union, Raud, now famous nation-wide, was elected as its director in a landslide victory despite any perceived drawbacks, notably including her pro-monarchy position. Under her continued leadership, the Union has been devoted to protecting and uplifting the workers, successfully improving their treatment and conditions to a notable degree.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Moonatik"
AES_cryo_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: Unknown\n\n§YBiography§!: "Mere creatures cannot begin to fathom the thoughts of an ice dragon."\n\nAccidentally found by Princess Zaida during a caving trip, the ice dragon known as Cryo dismissed the terrified pegasus and allowed her escape with indifference, only for her Highness to return days later with a panicking linguist. The ice dragon slowly learned Aestlonian, and these talks soon gave the Princess the idea for an offer.\n\n"He loves military planning," she told her fearful military officers about their newest lieutenant, "And he'll boost recruitment!"\n\nTo Cryo's credit, his strategies conducted in war exercises would merit promotions, but nopony considered convincing him, out of fear or futility, that his "military planning" was mostly logistic coordination.\n\nBeyond the military, the ice dragon cares little for politics and speaks even less of his homeland. One occasion a brave-enough subordinate asked what other ice dragons were like, and Cryo huffed. "I had horns," he snarled icily.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Littlepudel"

These cultists worship the Windigos and believe that the spirits' presence and strength grow with desolation and suffering. As a result, they have historically engaged in violent acts, including village attacks, terrorism, and sacrifices, aiming to invoke the Windigos' power. Their activities have made them a feared and despised faction within Aestlonia, confined mostly to rural areas and, controversially, granted government representation in a bid for peace.§!"
AES_agwu_hestraya_updated:0 "HGWU"
AES_agwu_hestraya_updated_long:0 "Hestrayan General-Workers Union     §gThe HGWU serves as nothing more than a continuation of the AGWU. One now focused on attempting to get workers from all over Hestraya to join their Union. Their politics remain identical, with Steel Raud, their leader, still being a big supporter of Zaida's rule, only wishing for the princess to more deeply cooperate with the Union.§!"
AES_neutral_army:0 "APA"
AES_neutral_army_long:0 "Aestlonian Provisional Army     §gRecently formed as a way for Aestlonia to protect itself from foreign threats, the Provisional Army, as the name implies, is not a final solution for military issue within the nation. Instead it's a temporary last-minute fix to the issue, this being brought upon due to the Karkadanni threat to the east. The APA is not political in nature, having little interest in ruling the nation in any way. But, their leader, Golden Sayif, has time and time again threatened the cultists of the Millenary Path. It wouldn't be a stretch to say she might react poorly if they are given control over the country.§!"
AES_neutral_hestraya_updated:0 "HNAA"
AES_neutral_hestraya_updated_long:0 "Hestrayan National Army Administration     §gUnlike the APA, the HNAA is a much more proper army to defend Aestlonia and the newly acquired additional Hestrayan territories. Their neutrality regarding politics has remained mostly the same. And so has their hostility towards the cultists.§!"
AES_fascism_hidden:0 "FNP"
AES_fascism_hidden_long:0 "Faith and Nation Party     §gThe FNP is the newest party in Aestlonia. One with seemingly no connections to the established political order of the nation. The party prides itself in following the principles of God-fearing civic nationalism, with no room for compromise to those considered "liberal" in nature. Their leader, Alter Tähenduses, is not unknown in the political circle. Once being the founder and head of the Kapitali Finance Center, where she used to work directly with the previous princess before being kicked out of the Center due to suspicions of embezzlement, someone you could hardly call a religious nationalist personality. Due to this, most look to the party with concern, not being fully sure of what it truly represents or who's backing it from behind the shadows.§!"

AES_neutral_coup:0 "NUP"
AES_neutral_coup_long:0 "National Unity Party     §gEven if politically neutral in the past, the Aestlonian Army had to reimagine themselves into something of a political bloc after Golden Sayif launched the "Glorious Coup". The so-called party is nothing more than the political body for the military and Sayif. Their policies being decided by the marshal and her alone.§!"
AES_democratic_republican:0 "TBT-R"
AES_democratic_republican_long:0 "Towards a Better Tomorrow-Republicans     §gThe influence and popularity of the TBT couldn't be killed by a simple coup, and this shows by their newest iteration. Republicans always existed within the party, but after recent events their notoriety has only increased, leading to them and their leader, Snow Qalam, being given majority control over the party. They follow the same harmonic principles of the past, but now with a bigger focus in perfecting harmony as a concept.§!"
AES_communism_republican_long:0 "Aestlonian General-Workers Union     §gAfter Zaida's actions in the Karkdannistan conflict and the following declaration of the republic, the famously monarchist Steel Raud decided it would be best to step down and instead give control of the union to her number 2. That being the zebra known as Amza Outtara, an ex-slave of the Mawzi Empire that found refuge in Aestlonia after the collapse of the same. Her policies are much like Raud's, a very soft approach to socialism, but with a much more "dreamy" way of going about it when compared to Raud's realism.§!"

### Ideas ###
AES_research_bonus:0 "The Price Of The Abundant Fear Of All Truths"
AES_unity_act_spirit:0 "National Unity Act"
AES_unity_act_spirit_desc:0 "The National Unity Act was signed after the tumultuous period of the Storm King and subsequent Karkadannistan invasions of Aestlonia. Its primary goal was to unite the country and facilitate its reconstruction. To achieve this, the Act formalized proper political parties, while also granting representation and power to the Millenary Path. This was intended to ensure that all factions had a say in the country's governance in exchange for their cooperation.\n\nWhile the Act accelerated Aestlonia's recovery from the war, it now poses an obstacle to further political and economic reforms. The structure it established has led to a perpetual political standstill, as parties rarely reach full agreement on any reform."
AES_aestlonia_identity:0 "Aestlonian Identity"
AES_aestlonia_identity_desc:0 "From the great migration, to the wrath of the cultists, the rule of the Arabians and now independence. Our great nation has endured a lot. With carefully planned reforms and programs, a new wave of nationalistic fervor has risen amongst our people who identify first as Aestlonian."
AES_ajloun_batallion:0 "Legacy of the Ajloun Brigade"
AES_ajloun_batallion_desc:0 "Formed in the sixth century after the formation of the Governorate of Hestraya, the Ajloun Brigade were a reaction to the resurgence of cultist attacks upon the civilian population of the region. While one out of many such groups, it was the most well known and has a rich and storied history of protecting the weak; something that it carries out even to this day.\n\nHowever, as much as it has been a boon to the people, the archaic organization of such groups cannot stand against the armies of nations today. While how far should our modernization efforts go remains in question, no one can doubt that the current militias are very much out of date."
AES_equipment_bad_standards:0 "Lowered Production Standards"
AES_equipment_bad_standards_desc:0 "The quality of our products are being lessened, in the hopes of keeping pace with our military's needs and requirements. While not as lethal as they should be, the weapons produced are still no less deadly."
AES_equipment_bad_standards_v2:0 "Optimized System"
AES_equipment_bad_standards_v2_desc:0 "Our factories have worked tirelessly, managing to work out a system to efficiently hammer out equipment without compromising on its quality and still delivering on time."
AES_production_complex_idea:0 "National Production Complex"
AES_production_complex_idea_desc:0 "With the choice of focusing over an organized industrial basis that produces high quality weaponry, the guilds of our nation are steadily transformed into a production complex that fulfills the needs of our army. Grey smoke stacks fill the skylines of the capital in contrast to the blue-white panorama of our winters, and factories aplenty churn out the tools to protect our sovereignty; with more being built on the horizon."
AES_production_complex_idea_v2:0 "The Fires of Industry"
AES_production_complex_idea_v2_desc:0 "With sufficient coordination, planning and provisions from the crown, the once few factories that dotted our nation are now turned into vast industrial complexes. Investment is high, opportunities are plentiful and employment even more so; leading to a boom in the development of our country. The fires of these modern-day forges burn red hot, running strong even in the bleak midwinter, to provide Aestlonia with its needs."
AES_karkad_war_buffs:0 "Never Again"
AES_karkad_war_buffs_desc:0 "##TODO, We might have once lost to Karkadannistan, but this mistake will not repeat. We are fully committed to safeguard our freedom, we have learnt from the past and we're still here to say it proudly: "Aestlonia shall be free!""
AES_3_plus_1_languages:0 "3+1 Issue"
AES_3_plus_1_languages_desc:0 "Made up of many communities of different cultural backgrounds, the Aestlonian nation is home to a diverse population that speaks 3 different languages. To make matters worse, after the Arabians imposed their rule upon the region, their own language was introduced as the "universal" language which was used to draft official documents and records. Centuries later, this poses a hurdle for the nation where Arabian communities (while a significant minority) constitute a small percentage of the population; most of which are not versed in their language."
AES_3_plus_1_languages_v2:0 "Slowly Forming Identity"
AES_3_plus_1_languages_v2_desc:0 "For centuries, the communities of Aestlonia have not had the opportunity to take a breather and appreciate the diversity of culture and languages of their nation. Now, with recent efforts undertaken by the Princess, work is being done on forging a nascent Aestlonian identity."
AES_army_language_spirit:0 "Army Language"
AES_army_language_spirit_desc:0 "The various languages, once a major hindrance to a unified cultural zeitgeist, has allowed our armed corps to communicate in a unique manner unseen in any other nation's armed forces and has helped foster a closer understanding of the different cultures inhabiting our nation; leading to a bond over shared heritage and belonging."
AES_the_evil_pact:0 "Lumetorm Pact"
AES_the_evil_pact_desc:0 "##TODO, with the temporary pact officialized the cultist have gotten a lot more influence over the Aestlonian government. But, at least, the cultists might start joining the army."
AES_windigo_spirit_preparationtree:0 "Warriors of the Ice Spirits"
AES_windigo_spirit_preparationtree_desc:0 "##TODO, The cultists have created this whole concept around the Windigos, one that has started to resonate even with part of our army. People are now doing near to fully suicidal missions and acts in name of the spirits."
AES_for_harmony:0 "Fighting for Harmony"
AES_for_harmony_desc:0 "##TODO, we're not fighting because we want war, we're fighting simply to protect what's ours. They started this fire, not us. If they want a fight, they will have one. But we won't forget our principles."
AES_ponykind_volunteers:0 "Pony Volunteers"
AES_ponykind_volunteers_desc:0 "##TODO, all over pony nations our call has been heard. One of resistance against a foreign enslaving enemy that wants to destroy our lands and people. These brave volunteers will help our country in more ways than just manpower, as their presence allows us to learn from their teachings."
AES_arab_volunteers:0 "Arabian Volunteers"
AES_arab_volunteers_desc:0 "##TODO, our righteous message was able to convince quite a few of the horses of Arabia and beyond to fight for our cause. Not only are they helping us by holding our frontlines but they're also providing much of their advanced knowledge."
AES_worker_support:0 "Union Support"
AES_worker_support_desc:0 "##TODO, with the union on our side our production complex can only get better."
AES_volatile_politics:0 "Volatile Politics"
AES_volatile_politics_desc:0 "With the destruction of the National Unity Act, the thin semblance of cooperation between different groups within the political sphere of the nation has been thoroughly destroyed. With nothing to replace this makeshift constitution that kept Aestlonians united, the general stability within the nation is declining rapidly."
AES_uncoop_army:0 "Uncooperative Army"
AES_uncoop_army_desc:0 "With the inclusion of the Millenary Path into our armed forces comes the slow expulsion of loyalty within the ranks. The army grows less and less faithful of the monarchy, with many in the provisional army having ties back to the Ajloun Brigade that sees the Path as their sworn enemy worse than any other."
AES_cultist_opposition:0 "Cultist Sabotage"
AES_cultist_opposition_desc:0 "##TODO, with our refusal to work with them the cultist have taken to sabotage us in our war against Karkadannistan."
AES_arab_resentment:0 "In Limbo"
AES_arab_resentment_desc:0 "The great cultural reconstruction was a massive project undertaken by the princess, however it only ever addressed the three major cultural tribes within the nation. Now that these changes are are solidified, the Arab minority grows ever more concerned and confused about their place in the new Aestlonian society; something that will need to be decided upon as soon as possible."

### Army coup/Republic ideas###
AES_new_regime:0 "Aspirant Republic"
AES_new_regime_desc:0 "The ousting of the monarchy and the establishment of the Republic has led to a new wave of unrest and political enthusiasm equivalent to the pre-National Unity Act era. With the power balance and political hierarchy completely upturned for the first time in a century, the military's hold on the country might not last very long as the ponies clamour for a true Republic."
AES_recognition_no:0 "Diplomatic Isolation"
AES_recognition_no_desc:0 "For as isolated as a nation like ours was, the thread of harmony still connected us to many foreign and distant nations that shared our ethos. Now, with this certainty gone, we are plunged back into a form of diplomatic 'ice-age'."
AES_liberal_approach:0 "Liberal Approach"
AES_liberal_approach_desc:0 "The provisional government has decided to go with a much more peaceful and inclusive way of guiding the nation towards a Republic, stating that their opposition was more towards insurrectionary forces rather than the harmonious ideals upon which Aestlonia has thrived. "

AES_authoritarian_approach_fascist:0 "Revival Society Empowered"
AES_authoritarian_approach_fascist_desc:0 "##TODO, even though other Maregyptian revival societies and scholars have denounced the MRS, they were still a needed partner in our quest to rule the nation."
AES_authoritarian_approach_neutral:0 "Army At The Realm"
AES_authoritarian_approach_neutral_desc:0 "##TODO, it was only natural to increase the power of the army over the politics of our new republic. We were the ones to proclaim it after all."
AES_unhappy_pones:0 "Popular Discontent"
AES_unhappy_pones_desc:0 "##TODO, Be it for political or for personalistic reasons, despite all her mistakes, the Princess certainly made herself liked by the many castes of society. The sudden change certainly hasn't made them happy, and they are sure to let us know."

AES_amza_bold_goal:0 "The Greatest Goal"
AES_amza_bold_goal_desc:0 "##TODO, to call either our goal to create a socialism never done before or our goal to take the Great Lakes "bold" is to be humble, we need to understand what we are fighting for and that we are the only ones capable of accomplishing it."
AES_great_lakes_refugee:0 "Refugee Act"
AES_great_lakes_refugee_desc:0 "##TODO, with the situation in the Great Lakes being as unstable as ever it is our duty to accept "refugees" from these lands. The Crimson Sun has been nice enough to secure regimed-friendly zebras interested to move to our nation."

AES_travelling_caravans_desc:0 "##TODO, they say that knowledge liberates, and that much we have to agree with, a reason the cultists had gotten so many members recently was due to their exploitation of vulnerable communities who didn't know any better.

AES_politicize_the_army:0 "Politicize the Army"
AES_politicize_the_army_desc:0 "##TODO, being apolotical isn't a sign of modernity for an army, it's a sign of complicity.

aestlonia.1.t:0 "The Path Forward"
aestlonia.1.d:0 "From the icy southern wastes to the towering northern mountains, from the kelpie-styled docks of Zarmarej to the weary spires of Ajloun, the whispers of change could be heard in every corner of Aestlonia. Indeed, many ponies believed in them and eagerly carried the words about transformation further on, while some were brave enough to act upon these murmurs, bringing their own vision for the country closer to reality. Still, for now, there was only one creature whose ambition to shift the realm matched their capabilities to do so.\n\nPrincess Zaida paced across her private study impatiently. Whereas her late mother, Princess Rawiya, second of the name, spent a lot of time in the audience chambers, hosting various factions and balancing their expectations, the young ruler had quickly lost any faith in the process of holding an all-pleasing court. In her eyes, the political forces across the Advisory Council were abusing the National Unity Act to focus on their petty problems, burying truly important issues under worthless squabbles. Even the growing threat of Karkadannistani invasion, one promising the very end of their proud nation, was not enough to resolve the constant state of deadlock.\n\nStopping in front of a large window, Zaida pulled the heavy curtains to the sides, allowing in the cold bright sun. The view of her beloved city calmed the princess somewhat, sharpening her focus and tempering her frustration into determination. As always, she needed to act on her own, charting the new course with a sure hoof no matter how rough the coming storm was shaping up to be."
aestlonia.1.a:0 "Emergency royal decrees were drafted shortly."
aestlonia.2.t:0 "Reign and Rein"
aestlonia.2.d:0 "As the heiress apparent, Zaida had experienced an upbringing entirely devoted to the duties and best practices of an enlightened leader. Although the lessons she learned so diligently turned out to be needed much sooner than she had expected, the princess used this core knowledge with great confidence over the last few years.\n\nAmong the different subjects, history had been one of her favorites. There was something especially fascinating and profound to be observed in the rise and fall of the great powers of the world, be it the now obvious collapse of Sa'adles or Grovers, or the smaller signs of decadence seen in the mighty Equestria, promising it a similar path. From where Zaida was standing, all of these examples of decline had common symptoms: bloated bureaucracy, neglected military, technological stagnation, and harmful deference to their traditions. \n\nWith the recent edicts, she did everything to combat the spread of the former three ailments inside of Aestlonia, at least everything possible in the current legal framework. Nonetheless, this was clearly not enough to ensure the survival of the country, and the biggest barrier preventing future reforms became painfully obvious. The princess felt no joy in tearing down her mother's legacy, but she could not afford to delay the next steps any longer, and so, after a short deliberation within the inner circle of the court, a new order was released, one to become a title of many front pages and a top point for many debates."
aestlonia.2.a:0 ""By royal will, the National Unity Act is null and void.""
aestlonia.3.t:0 "The Reaction"
aestlonia.3.d:0 "Winter Qalam held little doubt that the present session of the Advisory Council was the most dynamic in the last few months, perhaps even since the coronation of Zaida. Naturally, their gracious ruler was the reason for this perturbation too.\n\n"To sum up, no offense to all the fine folks here, these meetings were really becoming a drag." Steel Raud, the imposing representative of AGWU, currently occupied the speaker's podium. "Her majesty is not only well within her rights to change the laws - this is the only way out of our snowdrifts."\n\nThe creatures in the room started clamoring. The wing occupied by Millenary Path was expectedly united in their vocal disapproval, but Winter noticed negative remarks coming from other parties as well, including some members of his own TBT.\n\n"Order in the assembly!" His duties as a chairpony were sure to be tested today, but the realm needed every bit of stability if Zaida's plans were to work. "We have heard the opinion of the Union, and now would like to invite commentary for further discussion. Honorable Snowstorm, we would be grateful if you could present the opinion of your faction."\n\nA pony with mane of red and white - a cultist, even though Winter never liked the term - rose up after silence finally fell down. "Thank you. This... decision enforced by the princess is nothing but regression to the oppressive regime of the past. Not only does she remove the voice from the common Aestlonians, but she also robs them of the chance to defend their traditions, so nobly provided by her late mother..."\n\nThe rest of the sentence was drowned in the rising wave of accusations, jeering and hollers of support. With a sigh, Winter reached for his gavel again."
aestlonia.3.a:0 ""Order! Order, fillies and gentlecolts!""
aestlonia.4.t:0 "Hour Of The Sword"
aestlonia.4.d:0 "No war could be fought without the soldiers, and no soldiers would march without a commander. Luckily, Zaida had no delusions regarding her own military prowess, but the upcoming conflict demanded more than an honest assessment of her capabilities. In order to finalize the development of Aestlonian Provisional Army and ensure that its officers would be fully immersed in the reforms, the top brass was summoned to the royal palace for a series of planning sessions and battle plan elaborations.\n\nField marshal Golden Sayif and her generals arrived promptly, ready and able to contribute to the discussions. While Zaida respected Golden's abilities and accomplishments, as she was sitting in the chamber-turned-headquarters and listening to the officers' presentations, the princess could easily see that it would be a while before the gruff mare would show her any reverence beyond that dictated by the etiquette.\n\n"We are standing at the crossroads, your majesty. As it was explained prior, troop quality and quantity have their merits, and even with your commendable swiftness we do not have time to achieve both." Marshal's voice, trained by thousands of orders, rang crisply across the room. "The final decision is yours, and it would be wise to make it today. Permission to speak freely?"\n\n"Granted." Nodding, Zaida wordlessly wondered whether she could stop her from speaking freely at all.\n\n"The Karkad incursion will be short, one way or the other. After it is over, if Aestlonia stands, the power you have to change it will be curtailed." Golden gave the princess a hardened stare. "Use it well, and remember, when the strife comes, the corruption from within will raise its head too. Do not allow the damned cult to spread its taint with abandon again.""
aestlonia.4.a:0 ""Your... advice is noted, lady marshal.""
aestlonia.6.t:0 "Grind Down, Build Anew"
aestlonia.6.d:0 ""You! Private!" Golden Sayif focused all her attention on a single recruit in the long line, causing him to visibly shake. "How many laps did you make in the allotted time?"\n\n"T-t-ten." The heavy breaths and ample amount of sweat indicated that this was the extent of the stallion's current physical form. Golden had no doubts that a green member of the old Ajloun Brigade would make fifteen with a leisurely trot. Shivering under her heavy gaze still, the unfortunate pony felt a need to add something else. "Y-your highness."\n\nFrom a certain point of view, the marshal felt sorry for this lot. The decision to have enough bodies to properly cover the entire front line with Karkadannistan was strategically sound, but it also meant that the quality of the future defenders of the nation was, as one of the officers tactfully put it, below average. Thus, it fell to Golden to make these pathetic whelps into something presentable.\n\n"YOUR HIGHNESS? You can call a mare you are trying to woo "your highness", though I don't think you have a chance with muscles like that." With every booming word, the recruit seemed to shrink away further and further. "You will call me Marshal Golden, or ma'am. Is. That. Clear?"\n\n"Yes. Marshal Golden. Ma'am." After whispering his answer, the pony winced as laughter from the tail end of the formation reached his ears. Golden, meanwhile, was happy to pounce on the new target.\n\n"Oh, the privates who made less than ten find it funny? Well, all of you can have fun." She raised her voice to the full commanding power, causing everyone to snap to attention immediately. "Five minutes of rest for you all, and another run. All who fail to get twelve make a third attempt. IS THAT CLEAR?""
aestlonia.6.a:0 ""Yes, Marshal Golden, ma'am!""
aestlonia.7.t:0 "Building Upon the Old"
aestlonia.7.d:0 "Golden Sayif had a faint smile on her face, a sight as rare as a hot summer in Aestlonia. In the distance, the enemy dummy stood peppered with a few holes; specifically, three in the chest and two in the head.\n\nFive perfect shots. The shooter himself was crouched beside her, skillfully unloading the breech cartridge and hanging the rifle by his side with a similar proud look on his face. Along the same range, other soldiers and recruits from the old Ajloun Brigade scored similar shots on their targets. In the distance, Golden could hear the reverberating chants of soldiers marching in synchronized steps; their guns hung ready on their shoulders.\n\nThis is what an army should be, she thought. Even if the days of disorganized militias were past, their legacy and experience would still carry on the torch of the nation in battles henceforth. Even so, her thoughts lingered in doubt.\n\nWill it be enough? The enemy was vast and would no doubt outnumber them and their smaller army...\n\n"Marshal Golden!"\n\nTurning to the source of the sound, she saw that all the recruits had finished taking their shots at the targets. Perfect scores, all of them.\n\n"Good shooting, recruits! Keep working this hard and you will be ready for any battle! Now...give me ten laps around the ground in half an hour!" she bellowed.\n\nIt will have to be enough..."
aestlonia.7.a:0 "Professionals have standards."
aestlonia.8.t:0 "Noble and Strong"
aestlonia.8.d:0 "Zaida surely knew how to talk the talk. After all, it was a quality necessary for any politician, and throughout her life Steel Raud saw many ponies of that kind. There was something special about this one, however, a certain quality which all these big-mouthed mares and stallions lacked in. Even now, during their private meeting, when the princess was not perched up on her throne and had to raise her head to meet the gaze of the considerably taller socialist, Zaida carried a presence which simply put her one level higher.\n\n"Once again, I am incredibly thankful for your support, Director. It would hardly be an overstatement that the levels of effort Aestlonians are putting out right now, be it militia service or factory work, are unprecedented and fill my soul with eternal gratitude." The princess bowed slightly.\n\n"It is what they do, Your Majesty. For the country, and, frankly, for you." Returning the gesture, Raud pushed her chair back a bit.\n\nZaida smiled politely, but then sighed and allowed a thoughtful expression to cross her face. "I would be not quite honest if I said I understand these feelings in my heart. Logically, the adoration and the respect for the ruler are natural, but I have never had a similar figure placed above me." Her companion did not interrupt, and so the pensiveness coalesced into determination. "Still, I know that I will do everything in my power to carry the greatness they ascribe to me."\n\n"That's what all of us do. All we can." Raud remained reserved, but her eyes came alight with a spark of approval. "That's what I wanted to ask too. More fight to be found in this pony. I want to join the army. If Your Majesty would have me, of course.""
aestlonia.8.a:0 "Her call was heard and accepted. "
aestlonia.9.t:0 "An Encounter to Remember"
aestlonia.9.d:0 "The meeting between villages of different tribes was quite a significant event, organized by local governors with meticulous care. Of course, these big words meant something only for the grown-ups, and while the stallions and mares mingled at the massive culture fair, their children sought their own exchanges.\n\n"Anneli." A filly with a high-pitched voice pointed at herself, mirroring the gesture of a darker colt in a thick cap in front of her. "And you're called Iuh-hur?"\n\n"It's Yukhur." While he could understand his own distorted name among the weird sounds the stranger made, most of her words remained a mystery. "I. Come. From. Beyond. Big. Forest."\n\nGathering that the slowed rhythm corresponded to an explanation was easy, but it scarcely helped to understand any of the meaning behind the unfamiliar language. Trying her best to express confusion, Anneli grimaced and chaotically gestured with hooves.\n\nAfter a short deliberation, Yukhur picked up a nearby twig and started tracing lines in the fresh snow. The map he made was quite detailed, with a plethora of triangle trees, a thick line for the river and several boxy houses. Satisfied with the result, the colt added a tiny pony figure next to one of them, and nodded towards it. Recognising the stream, his companion snatched the stick and started adding to the picture. After she finished a similar piece of taiga with a set of more rounded buildings, a spark of mischief flared in her eyes as she reached out to the first half and added a curled hat to its lone inhabitant. Resemblance was passing at best, but Yukhur nodded with approval and answered with his own detail - another pony next to the circles, one with braided mane, just like Anneli."
aestlonia.9.a:0 "They were drawing close."
aestlonia.10.t:0 "A New Page"
aestlonia.10.d:0 "Dissolving the National Unity Act was a significant, but entirely political step. Zaida ached for more, for something visible and formed by her own will, not just related to her mother's achievements. Today, she was doing exactly that.\n\n"A historical occurrence, Your Majesty." The ever loyal advisor, Winter Qalam, hovered over her shoulder, reading the document neatly laid out on the table. "It is truly wonderful that recognition of our heritage is not dislodged by other pressing concerns."\n\n"Do you really think so?" Tapping her pen nervously, the princess frowned. "Some would say that it is an empty and vainglorious thing, neither necessary nor timely."\n\n"These voices should be rebuffed steadily and we will answer their cries in a twofold manner. It is a project which has been developed with your supervision by a team of our greatest artists, writers and linguists over several years, hence it has little bearing on current material resources, and there is no better moment to strengthen the soul of a creature, or indeed, the nation, than during a struggle. Your loyal subjects are completely behind you, Your Majesty." The stallion smiled as she made a confident nod and scribbled an ornate signature on the bottom of the last page. For him, there was power in names and words, and today this power was given out evenly, shaping regions, cities, or indeed, their ruler."
aestlonia.10.a:0 ""Let me be first to congratulate you, Princess Zaida Lumesadu.""
aestlonia.11.t:0 "Course Selection"
aestlonia.11.d:0 "With every piece of objective information at hoof and after receiving every possible advice, Princess Zaida had to chart the future course of the realm once more. The attack was coming, and without a reliable plan it would crush Aestlonia in a matter of weeks.\n\nThe sensible option, of course, was to stick with the proven loyalists, the TBT or the AGWU. By putting the international connections of the former or the popular support of the latter to the forefront of the preparation campaign, reasonable progress could be achieved in the remaining time. Still, what if reasonable was not enough?\n\nA tinge of fear, a speck of desperation, maybe even a shade of dark ambition highlighted another possibility. The cultists of Millenary Path were more than capable fighters, and without the National Unity Act they were turning against the state once more, putting even more pressure on the overextended army. This situation could be reversed, new negotiations initiated, starting a risky bargain with a steep price of success and failure alike."

"It is quite appreciated that you were able to do it on such short notice."\n\nA barely visible head motion, which could be counted as a nod only under the most generous interpretation, was the only answer.\n\n"Well. To business then." Glancing to the sides, the princess shifted forward slightly. "I was told that you have brought a final draft of the pertinent agreement?"\n\nThere was a ringing noise of clasp removed, a rustle of paper sheets and finally a soft knock on the table as the documents were placed in front of Zaida. As per the many legal lessons from her younger days, she took time reading every word and measuring their dark implications. Unfortunately, this was exactly the list of measures necessary to save Aestlonia.\n\n"It goes without saying that we expect a very strict reading of the text." She tried to sound assertive. "Millenary Path shall act civilized, exactly as it portrays itself to the outside world, and never as a harmful sect." Since there was no indication of any interruption or comment, Zaida pushed on. "There is also the matter of the ending clause. You and your people need to understand that most of these privileges will be withdrawn after the war, subject to royal review depending on the past circumstances."\n\nStorm Alsaqie remained frozenly still."

Thus, when the call for help comes from the southern tip of Zebrica, a snowy land of Aestlonia, we must weigh the possible options. According to their diplomats, the harmony in the region is threatened by Karkadannistan, a rogue state born from the fires of the Storm King reign."

A dozen royal guards were keeping close watch over the princess as a lone visitor stood in front of her at a respectful distance. Nonetheless, there was something about this unarmed stallion, a certain aura of danger, which would trouble Zaida even if she did not know anything about him.\n\n"Vastik Kabja. The court bids you welcome." Luckily, the mask of a ruler cared little whether to hide boredom or worry. "We were told you wish to pledge yourself to defend Aestlonia."\n\nKabja, infamous cultist, known to the newspapers as Butcher of Badimane and to the intelligence office as an A-class peril, bowed gracefully, with a fluidity of motion rarely seen even in most experienced retainers.\n\n"Your Majesty. I am honored." He spoke with a degree of unexpected deterrence, and even the low whistling undertone - unfortunate consequence of a chipped tooth - did little to detract from it. "You heard right. Once my path brought me back to the struggling homeland, my duty became abundantly clear."\n\n"And why would a veteran such as you choose to return to the front lines so soon?" The haughty curiosity of the question waned slightly when Zaida met Kabja's gaze, noticing a flicker of something dark behind his focused eyes.\n\n"Three reasons, Your Majesty. First is duty, as I've said. Second, I take pride in my talent for war" Stressing the last word, the stallion tapped the ground firmly. "Third, just like you, I carry the blood of Arabia. It is the nature of our people to fight for a cause, fight no matter the odds, be it on a battlefield, or, indeed, in a palace."\n\nThe compliment was sincere, but it did little to put Zaida at ease."

aestlonia.25.d:0 "Becoming a pioneer for the new wilderness survival program sounded quite prestigious, and sergeant Shiver Drift had been eager to prove that his training and discipline would conquer every possible obstacle. Now, properly stuck in the middle of a frozen forest with nothing but a thick overcoat and a heavily scratched spade, he was ready to reconsider. Tellingly, the fact that he was not alone out here made the situation even more unbearable.\n\n"Come on, sergeant. Shelter-making should be easy for such an accomplished officer. Use that big head of yours." One of his new instructors snickered and tapped her hoof. Unlike Shiver, she seemed right at home here in the tundra, among the elements and strange creature sounds.\n\nHe sighed. They had given him a tool for digging, so it would make sense to dig. Putting all his weight into the strike, Shiver brought the spade down to the frigid ground with a loud clang. The resulting dent was miserably small.\n\n"Sister, look! He actually went for it." The other teacher made a guffawing noise. "Go on, continue. If you try hard enough, your dead body will appreciate the shallow grave."\n\n"I'm sorry, this does require a bit more folk wisdom than marching on a parade." Moving leisurely, the first mare approached Shiver, who felt too embarrassed to provide a retort. "Shovelling will get you nowhere even in the summer. Watch closely. These marks come from the bark of the tree - the best way to start a shelter is to fell one."\n\n"So get chopping. We are going to pray, and when we come back you'd better make some progress." After flashing condescending smirks, both cultists moved out, leaving Shiver by himself."

aestlonia.26.d:0 ""So know this well, brothers and sisters! When the war comes, our enemies will find an avalanche unleashed!" Snowstorm, prominent Millenary Path speaker, paced the podium energetically, her words building up into a resonating crescendo. Of course, the acoustic qualities of this hogwash were of little interest to Golden Sayif. Even though she booked one of the best spots in the room, the marshal cared only for the ending of the speech, when the damned cultist would stop for a bow, or a salute, or whatever passed for a farewell in their rotten cohorts.\n\n"We shall form this avalanche out of steel and flesh! And with our strength carried by the mighty wind of hatred, we shall destroy any and all who oppose us, and feed the lands with their ashes and blood. For we are chosen of a higher power, harbingers of a greater destiny!" The critical moment was approaching rapidly. Golden took a deep sigh, focusing on the position of her mark and the weight of the concealed pistol.\n\n"Ours is the sacrifice, but ours shall be the eternal glory!" At last, Snowstorm took the final step, she was standing still and observing the audience, but something in the response caused the marshal's instinct to halt the plan. Golden expected approval from members of the sect, but the chamber was full of other ponies, civilian or even military ones, who stomped and cheered with the same insane passion. Leaning back in exasperation, she refined this fact into a dreadful realization: it was too late for a surgical strike, and worse..."
aestlonia.26.a:0 "...to save Aestlonia from madness, Zaida had to go."
aestlonia.27.t:0 "Choosing A Favorite"
aestlonia.27.d:0 "With the unsavory option of allowing the Millenary Path to corrupt the armed forces firmly off the table, Zaida had arrived at another crossroads. Despite the willingness of the TBT and the AGWU to cooperate on most issues, their leadership proposed radically different approaches to the finer details of war preparation.\n\nIn particular, the former devised a plan focused on diplomacy play, doubling down on help from Equestria both in personnel and equipment. The latter, meanwhile, advised an internal restructuration, counting on the capacity of the worker class to produce weapons and hooves to wield them. Since mixing and matching such distinct ideas was clearly ill-fortuned due to the time constraints, the princess had to settle on a single way forward."
aestlonia.27.a:0 "She believed in the prospects of international cooperation."
aestlonia.27.b:0 "She chose to put trust in her ponies."
aestlonia.28.t:0 "Meeting With The Guard"
aestlonia.28.d:0 "The numbers in the military reports gave Zaida a sense of impressive scale for the machine of state at her beck and call, but this power was somehow ephemeral, detached from reality. As she was walking along the line of the newly formed royal guard regiment, the princess felt rather differently. These ponies would soon become another marker on the map of the frontline, but here and now they were flesh and blood, ready to fight and to die, to do their duty to the state - duty to her.\n\nHer thoughts wandered across their fates, while her eyes examined their faces. This one, for instance, a stallion with a streak of red mane sticking from under his cap and a chiseled jaw - what would come of him? Feeling the royal attention, the recruit saluted and Zaida nodded back.\n\n"Anything of particular interest to Your Majesty?" The colonel assigned to the force, a grizzled veteran, posed the question with reverence and a subtle hint of worry, ready to pounce on the source of the problem.\n\n"Yes, actually. I want to give the soldiers a speech." Driven by a sudden, deep impulse, Zaida took a step back. After the officer obediently commanded for attention and hundreds of heads turned to catch her every word, she started to speak, loudly and passionately.\n\n"Sons and daughters of Aestlonia! Today, you honor your homes, your ancestors, your princess! Know this: our struggle, the one you have bravely joined in the most perilous role, is righteous. You, noble warriors, carry my colors into the battle, and my heart is filled with confidence - these soldiers will not let me down. Victory will be ours!" When she was done, a cry of many voices rallied the ranks."
aestlonia.28.a:0 ""For Zaida!""
aestlonia.29.t:0 "The Nonpartisan Speech"
aestlonia.29.d:0 "Even though she had repealed the National Unity Act, Zaida did not underestimate the power held by the TBT and the AGWU. By bringing the chairponies of the two parties together and convincing them to make a joint declaration, the princess expected to cement the popularity of the wartime government.\n\n"Friends, kin, fellows and neighbors! Our country faces a monumental danger. It will take a great effort to overcome it, but overcome it we shall." Winter Qalam's voice echoed over the audience eager to catch his every word. "No matter the belief or political cause, it is time to reach out to our brothers and sisters and rise up as an unbreakable bulwark against the invasion." The stallion nodded to his larger companion, inviting her to take over.\n\n"It is just so." Steel Raud spoke slower, simpler, but with the same underlying intent. "We will fight, and we will win. For we are made of harder stuff, for we are protecting the lives and the lands we cherish. Rich or poor, one tribe or another, city dweller or village folk - all can help, will help."\n\nFinally, the princess herself took a step forward. As she raised her hoof, the excited crowd swiftly fell silent. "Today I stand between two great champions of our nation. Soon, I will be leading a thousand times more, creatures both mighty and proud. Know this: the accord reached here and now will be the everlasting bond, one which we will all take strength from, be it in the struggle or in the glorious peace afterwards." Looking around, Zaida could easily see the planted seeds of success. Hundreds of her devoted subjects were ready to spread the true message, one which she carried with passion and one turned into a battle-cry by the unleashed crowd."

The polite, patient tone of his aide only made port overseer Tiidrik more irritated.\n\n"You'd do well to listen to the young lad." Flicking ash off her cigarette, the mare in front of him tilted her head. "Me and my friends have better things to do than traveling across the seas and pulling practical jokes on harbormasters."\n\n"Listen, Miss..." Under a dozen intense stares from the aforementioned friends, a group of ponies in matching uniforms huddled behind their leader, Tiidrik hastened to correct himself. "I meant, Sergeant Foam. There are proper rules and regulations. Due to the current situation. I cannot allow a fully-loaded military transport to..."\n\n"Afraid to say you've got it all wrong. We are not a military transport." Foam grinned widely. "Just a shared interest group with a strong theme and a thing for tourism."\n\nBefore the overseer had a chance to question this dubious claim, a shout came from the communications room of his patrol ship. "They've got an all clear from the Ajloun headquarters, sir! Also multiple requests for docking inbound!" The latter comment was rather superfluous, as looking down towards the horizon Tiidrik could discern at least ten more vessels which were approaching at a steady pace. Suddenly, everything about this bizarre incident clicked inside of his head."

aestlonia.31.d:0 "Having his crew march somewhere outside the mines was nothing new for captain Merle. However, unlike the strikes which he organized back when his mane was black instead of gray and lungs had less dust in them, this was decidedly not an anti-government protest.\n\n"What is the meaning of this gathering?" A round helmet and a pair of darting eyes were the only parts of the officer who addressed the workers from beyond the barricades of the military outpost. Glancing at the crowd, minding its size in particular, Merle could guess the source of the apprehension pretty easily. "It is my duty to inform you that public actions are..."\n\n"Comrades!" One of the younger miners operated the loudhailer, a stout mare with a voice still capable of ringing sonorously. "No cause for alarm! We want to talk to the big brass in the capital, and since you have a direct line to them, here we are."\n\nThe soldier's head disappeared for a minute, before popping right back, a bit higher than before. "This is hardly a standard procedure!" Of course, this fact was known to Merle too, but he had learnt the value of action over red tape long ago. The captain leaned closer to the speaker.\n\n"Tell them we're here to fight for our country. Tell them the creatures of Aestlonia has heard her call." These raspy words of an old patriot were first amplified by the megaphone, then carried over by a winded private straight to his commander, and finally sent across hundreds of kilometers to the capital. There, a choice was made and hundreds of fates were redirected."

It was only during the private salons set after the major festivities, when the glorified facade of a ruler could be discarded, that she could really enjoy the gathering. Even so, in these troubled times one had to settle for solace instead of joy.\n\n"It is rather curious, the manner our bloodlines work." The sovereign princess glanced at her noblemare companions. "When a foreign aristocrat has grand ideas for the cultural transformation, or the survival of the state, does it ever end well?"\n\n"Pray tell you do not speak of yourself, cherished cousin." Although Lumi, the head of the ancient family once ruling over Särav Org, was not related to Zaida this closely, such an endearing term was customary in their circles. "You are the one who the nation follows, in hearts and minds alike, the very essence of their kinship."\n\n"They do indeed, but what is the justification of such loyalty? By birth and custom, I am much closer to just another Arabian despot than either you or cousin Ntrôm." Zaida straightened her mane in a slow, melancholic gesture.\n\nThe second mentioned pony bowed slightly and then answered softly, yet with certainty. "Their faith in you binds stronger than any other claim. True, my ancestors fled the Maregypt alongside theirs, and cousin Lumi is also related to the kings of old, but this is not what Aestlonia needs now. You are the princess, their princess, the one who leads them bravely through a terrible tempest. Take this destiny with pride.""

Another successful step of the plan, another knot on the string of well-executed maneuvers - by all accounts, Golden should feel accomplishment, if not pride. However, there was nothing of the sort to be found inside the mind which devised a daring strike at the corruption in the heart of the nation. Something had to occupy the abandoned position, and the determination, deep-rooted and bitter, proved to be just the right force.\n\nThe transmitter in her hoof felt heavy and cold, like a rifle after a long march. Golden put out the speech notes in front of her, taking aim, and then pulled the proverbial trigger.\n\n"Fellow citizens of Aestlonia. Marshal Golden Sayif speaking. [AES.Capital.GetName] is liberated from the clutches of the Millenary Path. Her former majesty Princess Zaida is under house arrest, and the monarchy is abolished in favor of a republican regime. To that effect, the National Assembly is suspended."\n\nAn intimate knowledge of the city defenses, the cultists' belief in their own invulnerability, a core of loyal soldiers, all the ingredients for a decapitating strike were perfect. Of course, the difficult part was waiting ahead, and Golden had to press on."

aestlonia.34.t:0 "Lost In Translation"
aestlonia.34.d:0 ""So, what is the news, elder?" A single stallion said that, but it did not take a wise pony to understand that every creature in the assembled crowd wanted to know the answer. In some sense, Oskarri, the mare being addressed, shared the same desire for certainty.\n\n"I should ask forgiveness for gathering all of you with so little to explain." She spoke softly, but loudly enough to be heard in the far corners of the packed room. "There have been no instructions from the city, and I have conversed with messengers from the other villages - they do not know anything conclusive yet."\n\n"But what about the announced rules on trade...?"\n"Will we get funds for the upcoming festival at least...?"\n"Are we to prepare the young'uns for town school...?"\n"Is it true that the princess has changed her name?"\n\nThese and many more questions filled the common hall, with the last one coming from a particularly curious foal. The royal proclamation on cultural changes has left many Aestlonian Arabians puzzled, as it only included the plans for bridging the three main tribes, and left their group out. Oskarri did not doubt that her neighbors were happy to support her majesty Zaida, but in order to do so they would need to understand what she wanted for their people. She raised her hoof, signaling silence.\n\n"The last one is indeed true, petal." As the villagers calmed down, she continued. "As for the others, fret not - tomorrow, I will travel to the governor himself and ask for an audience.""

"Zarf, I have given a strict order to not be disturbed."\n\n"I beg forgiveness a thousand times, sir!" His secretary's voice was coming from outside the room. "I've told her..."\n\nA sheet of paper slammed down right in front of Finjan caused him to wince and interrupted Zarf's stream of excuses.\n\n"Who dares... Ah." Raising his head, the stallion examined the intruder with a measured resentment instead of the flaring fury. "Marshal. To what do we owe this dubious and ever so interruptive pleasure?"\n\nGolden Sayif nodded towards the letter. "Read, Finjan. Take your time."\n\nHe exhaled sharply, but followed the order still. With every digested word his brow was becoming increasingly furrowed. "Is this some kind of prank? Her Majesty would never want our respectable organization to give up our much needed funding to some uneducated brutes. And what is this ridiculous clause about the building? Really, I insist you leave and think about your outlandish behavior..."\n\n"It's already done." The marshal remained perfectly calm. "You and your pretty club can continue sucking the country's budget after the war. For now, you're out. My lads and lasses will help you vacate the premises - it's your choice whether their hooves will be helping or up your croup."\n\nFinjan had to open and close his mouth a few times before producing an answer.

aestlonia.36.d:0 "With the brunt of preparations for the Karkadannistan war focused closer to the future front line, the court life in the capital became unusually quiet. Zaida would often find herself with sparse company, spending long hours neck-deep in paperwork and planning, but sometimes stuck with only servants and her own musings for entertainment. These daydreaming moments, especially those which lingered, could carry her far across the ocean of ideas. Sometimes, a peculiar thought could suddenly surface, manifesting into an actual deliberation.\n\nTo stop the horses, Hestraya would have to stand united. However, despite all the shared history and common interests, all the treaties and promises, it did consist of two parts. The princess did not truly think Maretonia inferior, but a prideful, disdainful whisper in her mind was always happy to repeat the gossip of northern softness, laziness, even weakness in front of the incoming danger. Maybe this neighbor could use some direction, even prosper under a more decisive ruler?\n\nA more calculating side of her consciousness kicked in swiftly. Actually claiming the crown was barely possible, requiring unreasonable exploitation of the fact that the Maretonian duke was Zaida's brother-in-law. Worse, full-blown negotiations would require ages to complete. This left a sudden ultimatum as the only viable option, betting heavily on the fact that the local nobles could be shocked into submission and the duchess shared the same outlook as her younger sibling. Naturally, a failure would ruin the public image of the princess, lead to an irreconcilable breakdown of their partnership or worse, but what if..."

Still, an armed conflict with an ally at this time will undermine every chance at stopping the actual invasion."

Unsurprisingly, the general public does not wish to fight against a historical ally, and the army, remaining unprepared for any kind of local operation due to the value placed on secrecy by the princess, is vehemently against any escalation. Of course, backing down now will only confirm the prevalent opinion on the whole affair being entirely unnecessary and torpedo the monarch's reputation."

"The army is not a toy to be winded up at your leisure, and neither is the entire foreign policy."\n\nDespite the tone of the address, the princess maintained her mask for now, patiently awaiting the obligatory "your majesty", which Golden Sayif finally spitted out with contempt. "Your dissatisfaction has been noted. Is there anything else you find necessary to share with our court?"\n\n"As a matter of fact, yes." Looking around at the assembled officials, the older mare snorted and continued in a collected manner. "The princess is careless, inexperienced and not yet fit to rule, while her actions are burying Aestlonia in deep snow..."\n\nTalking down to Zaida was one thing, but talking over her, belittling her authority was on a different level of unacceptable entirely. "How dare you!" The sudden clarion outburst caused the marshal to stop. "What do you know of the monarch’s burden? Must we remind you that you gave an oath to serve the state, my state? You have a duty protecting the country and following orders, not questioning your sovereign ruler. Out, I will have not one more treasonous word!"\n\nGolden flinched, saluted in total silence and stormed away, her steps echoing heavily in the pillared chamber."

Nonetheless, the urge to relax, partake in leisure and celebrate was quickly shut down by two prevailing factors.\n\nFirstly, there was the objective reality. The battle reports and appeals from the home front were not gone, but instead replaced by the proceedings of establishing control over the new territories and restoration of the old ones. Although Zaida managed to jumpstart the country once, now this only compounded with the older systemic problems. Thus, a decisive push for stability was required, one obviously to be spearheaded by the reigning monarch.\n\nSecondly, there were other ideas bubbling inside the mind of the princess. Why would she be content with pushing back some uninspired, barbaric opportunists? Zaida could do so much more, for the people, for harmony, and for greater glory still. Indeed, some of her newest works, such as the reorganization of the Provisional Army, guard regiments and the eastern partisan forces into the United Royal Army Command, were approaching final stages of completion, and the ground was set for more ambitious developments."

Despite the insistence of more ceremony-minded members of the court, she had no intention of letting this revert to the previous form.\n\nToday’s visit by a certain Pinekäbi, an earth pony from the territories previously occupied by Karkadannistan, was a perfect example to prove her preferences right, as instead of a lengthy session of title calling and a myriad of obligatory pleasantries, Zaida could dive almost straight into the conversation. By the intelligence reports it was promising to be an interesting one: the stallion bowing in front of the throne went from a member of the Millenary Path to a tundra reservation ranger to a star of the local resistance, now ready to properly serve the crown.\n\n"Your Majesty. Your name rings joyously from the blue waters to the green treetops, and I am honored to be in your presence." He spoke in a solemn manner, one of deeper understanding rather than of empty pedantry.\n\n"Please rise, noble Pinekäbi." With a half-polite, half-intrigued smile, the princess gestured upwards with her hoof. "We bid you welcome with great pleasure and wonder what brings you before us."\n\n"I seek employment with the ruler of Aestlonia. My lone years taught me much of the nature of the fight, and now I shall give back a fair share to my home."\n\n"Consider yourself enlisted immediately by the monarch decree." Nodding, Zaida shifted forward slightly. "Albeit, with one condition: tell us more of these years.""

aestloniamonarchy.3.t:0 "Call From Merelinn"
aestloniamonarchy.3.d:0 "It was rare for any Aestlonian monarch to venture out into the realm without organizing a proper royal tour, and stranger yet to do so only to solve a specific local problem. However, Zaida was not just any monarch. Moreover, there was something about the recent request from the port town of Merelinn which made her want to go.\n\nThe citizens, whose complaints amounted to weird noises and unusual movements in the water, were surprised and delighted to receive the full attention of the princess. Demonstrating understandable appreciation, they endeavored to meet all Zaida's itinerary requests and in particular set her up by the shore, in a touched-up mansion used to host foreign dignitaries occasionally arriving to the country via the town.\n\nOf course, despite the inexplicable attraction, the princess was not going to stay for long - in fact, her visit was just two days, one for the arrival ceremony and another for the inspection of the dockyards. Nonetheless, it was during the night between them Zaida found herself staring from the window towards the rolling waves, struggling to snap her attention away."

aestloniamonarchy.4.t:0 "A Familiar Question"
aestloniamonarchy.4.d:0 "Although the recent events did put some important questions on hold, Zaida was perfectly aware of the need to move forward. However, the new circumstances required a commensurate adaptation.\n\nOnce, she envisioned a grand political reformation, uniting the best aspects of the TBT and the AGWU. Erudition and tradition of the former, simplicity and communality of the latter, tied together by the loyalty to the throne could become an ultimate answer to the challenges of the era. Alas, this promising utopia was simply impossible to achieve now, with some inevitable favoritism which took place before the war playing only a minor part in the difficulties. Instead of a wild experiment, Aestlonia required a well-defined course to guide her away from the crisis, and the princess was responsible for being the ultimate pathfinder.\n\nThe significance of this choice could not be understated - Zaida was setting on the capital F future for everything from herself and the court to the entirety of her people. There was certainly room for maneuver within each faction, but the main direction, the principal advisory group, would have to be decided unequivocally."

aestloniamonarchy.5.t:0 "Of Glories Past"
aestloniamonarchy.5.d:0 "Zaida often took to strolling through the palace garden to untangle her thoughts. Today she chose the ice sculpture gallery as the place for her deliberations, and while the daylight danced in bright colors inside their transparent forms, the princess considered the subject of this art. Many would say that it represented the essence of the culture of her people.\n\nHowever, there were ponies with very different ideas. The members of so-called "Aesgyptian Movement", a small but influential faction inside of the ascendant TBT, would call it just a circumstantial fad. Of course, their position did not end with this very specific remark, but rather it reflected the general radical attitude. Keeping up with the name, they endorsed the slow revival of the ways of the ancestral home, Maregypt, and rejected anything inherently Hestrayan. More zealous adherents even went on to speak of reclaiming the "motherland" and abandoning the current "temporary refuge". This semi-independent organization had sent emissaries to Zaida with a proposal for the new government built on cessation of the civilian administration in favor of a system reminiscent to the absolute power wielded by the monarchs of old.\n\nBacking this fringe group instead of the ever loyal Winter Qalam would be risky and unpopular not just with the TBT, but with the nation at large. An argument could be made that it would go against the core principles of harmony. Still, for the reigning princess it was a chance, one as rare as the ray of the sun falling down at a perfect angle to pierce the sweet spot on a statue, to achieve something truly incredible."

aestloniamonarchy.6.d:0 "Even if marshal Golden Sayif somewhat came around over recent months, she did not shy from expressing her opinions directly, even to the princess.\n\n"Your Majesty, it is very simple. Each zealot we arrest becomes a source for Windigo insanity and a drain on our resources." Although she was clearly agitated, the deeply ingrained instincts caused Golden to stand at attention. "I cannot advise you to continue down this path."\n\n"I do hear you well, lady marshal. But you are surely not suggesting that we execute every potential member of the Millenary Path." Zaida kept a more diplomatic tone.\n\n"Not potential ones, no. Just those that are definitively in the ranks." The answer was completely nonchalant. "It's not like we lack evidence or confessions."\n\n"And my answer would remain "no" even with this... judicial restriction. Our people deserve a reprieve from bloodshed and violence. We must try to bring the wayward souls back to society, and as a ruler I must set an example for mercy and forgiveness." Speaking assertively the princess rose up from her chair. "This is my final decision."\n\n"Understood." Outwardly Golden did not flinch. "I would also like to report that one of the high-ranking cultists, a mare known as Snowstorm, remains at large with no tangible leads. This warrants increasing security, especially at court."\n\nZaida considered the advice briefly. The conclusion was unsurprising: she could not afford to appear scared now, as it would undermine her redemption and reconciliation message."

aestloniamonarchy.7.d:0 "The convention dictated that the royal appointments set in the capital were to be held exclusively at the palace, to ensure the level of splendor appropriate to the situation. This was another notion Zaida was quite happy to dispose of, and most of the younger nobles were equally glad to support her. For this reason, her meeting with princess Ntrôm, a scion of the pre-exodus Maregyptian nobility, took the form of a trot through the crown domain, a pine forest on the edges of the city. Walking gracefully underneath the ancient, mighty trees, they quickly delved into a conversation.\n\n"You honor me, Your Majesty. Such interest in our legacy means a lot by itself, but a government position..." Smiling sincerely, Ntrom bowed without interrupting the gait. "It would be wonderful to apply my talents for the good of our homeland."\n\n"Your help will be invaluable, dear cousin." Zaida skillfully returned the gesture. "With you and the Aesgyptian Movement at my side, I believe that our nation is destined for a grand revival."\n\n"The Movement, you say?" The smile turned colder than the snow beneath their hoofs in an instant. "This is quite a surprise. I thought them to be rather beneath our position."\n\n"They share the vision of greater Aestlonia, do they not? A natural ally for our cause - of course, if there is anything I should know, I would appreciate your advice." Surprised, Zaida slowed down a bit.\n\n"Oh, they might be useful if properly applied. My issue is with the lack of merit in their leader." After scoffing indignantly, Ntrôm hurried to thaw back. "He is of no great concern. Your Majesty's control will ensure that. Now how about we talk about some ideas I came up with for this possibility?""

aestloniamonarchy.8.t:0 "Water Of Womb"
aestloniamonarchy.8.d:0 ""You are a hard pony to get a hold of, prince." Zaida examined the stallion in front of her with great curiosity concealed by the usual mask of properness. His manner of dress, brightly colored and adorned with gold, attracted attention easily, but she was more intrigued to learn the real character of the Aesgyptian Movement's leader.\n\n"As soon as I knew that our ideas were acknowledged and services required, Your Majesty, I made it my utmost priority to appear before you." With a stately nod, Pikhimphe caused his jewelry to ring softly. "I would like to believe that our exchange of letters entertained you in the meanwhile".\n\n"You would be correct." Throughout the past months, she had discerned a lot of passion in the polite words inked in a stylized pseudo-Maregyptian script. Even before this first physical meeting he was not afraid to slowly but surely promote his ideas, some of which could be generously decried as too radical in the eyes of society. "We have a lot to discuss, and we need to bring noble Ntrôm up to speed."\n\nPikhimphe's reaction perfectly mirrored the one caused by the mention of him recently, but he followed it with a succinct explanation. "Ah, my dearest sister."\n\n"I was not aware of your familial relationship." Maintaining impassiveness, Zaida took a mental note to scold the intelligence office for this gap in her knowledge.\n\n"It is not a secret per se, my princess." He glanced away for a moment. "She went to significant pains to distance herself from her own creation after it proved to be bolder than her. As I was left to lead this unjustly abandoned idea, I did not have a chance to change her mind among all my duties. The possibility to do so is most welcome.""

From arithmetic or the basics of science to botany and cold crafts, it was a rare class when the foals in his care would leave without learning anything new, and that fact had always kept Glace going. Similarly, his skill at explaining Aestlonian grammar, while not outstanding, was rather adequate.\n\nHowever, he started to question both his linguistics and pedagogy skills after the government imposed a new policy regarding these subjects. The new tongue, the new script, the new set of rules, all "Maregyptian-inspired", could be more aptly described as headache-inducing.\n\n"Mister Berry, sir?" Noticing his prolonged confusion, the student at the blackboard called out to him as tactfully as possible. "Do you think this is correct?"\n\nGlace lowered his eyes to the handbook on the table, then raised them to the chalk scribbles, trying to compare two indecipherable strings of foreign symbols with little success.\n\n"I don't f..." He feigned a cough. "Thank you. Everyone, please copy the answer kindly provided by Helja. It is your homework to come up with your own version of spelling or justify why hers is correct.

aestloniamonarchy.10.t:0 "A Century More"
aestloniamonarchy.10.d:0 "Was all she had done enough? This simple question sank deep into Zaida's mind, creating cracks of hesitation and weariness behind the ice-still surface of her demeanor. Yes, the monarchy was secure for her own lifetime and beyond, and the vision of harmony stood strong. Yes, the court and the populace reportedly praised her reign and stability it brought, despite the hardships Aestlonia had to endure. Yes, yes, yes, all well and good, a fine job by a fine princess.\n\nA cope-out, an easy way, cowardice even - those were the names her own ambition gave to the chosen path for the nation. It was very fine indeed, for a ruler happy to deal in average and mediocre, just another sovereign of frozen backwater. All the bold, far-reaching ideas and intentions, from Aesgyptian Movement fiery nostalgia to reshaping everything together with AWGU, were binned in favor of keeping it steady, worse, being a perfect continuation of her mother's legacy.\n\nRawiya looked down on her daughter from a majestic oil painting, or at least that was how Zaida could interpret her gaze. Meeting the familiar eyes just for a moment, she turned around towards a richly illustrated map of the South. There was one plan to be put in motion, a design worthy of a true noblemare, a glorious dream which would be soon unveiled to her allies, and then - to the whole world."
aestloniamonarchy.10.a:0 "Its name was Hestraya."
aestloniamonarchy.11.t:0 "The Most Ambitious Plan"
aestloniamonarchy.11.d:0 "Her stride remained unerring, but Zaida felt nervous approaching the great new Pyramids of Varjupaik. It was not the same awe felt by her entourage - although the monumental complex was impressive, she could handle splendor. No, she was concerned about the subject of the reception organized by Prince Pikhimphe. There was an atmosphere of audacious courage about him, and as she came to know well in the last months that brazen attitude could easily border folly.\n\nInside the stone halls well-dressed valets escorted the monarch into a large chamber. The lavish room was positively brimming with noble and wealthy patrons of the cause, who fell silent the instant Zaida entered. She lowered her head, acknowledging all the reverent bows, and took the place for the guest of honor, successfully hiding the bewilderment from the fact that the prince sat directly next to his sister and that neither he nor Ntrôm showed any signs of usual aversion.\n\nPikhimphe overtook the proceedings with confidence. As he spoke, servants revealed a beautiful hoof-crafted map of Zebrica. Another one of their number, a pegasus, nimbly flew around, pointing at regions mentioned by the Movement’s leader. First came the boastful promises of uniting Hestraya - admittedly, Zaida approved of the idea - but the address did not stop there.\n\n"And from that simple foundation, we shall make a move both glorious and ever so desired! We shall cast this temporary refuge away, march north and retake the homeland in one fell swoop! Along you, my friends, I humbly seek one thing - the blessing from our future Queen."\n\nThe foreign title snapped Zaida out of shock. This has not been properly discussed! But now, all the eyes bedazzled with golden words were on her, and even Ntrôm smiled sincerely, as if approving this outrageous scheme."

aestloniamonarchy.12.t:0 "A Return To Form"
aestloniamonarchy.12.d:0 "For a ruling monarch, signing a document affecting thousands would quickly become a mundane everyday action. Nonetheless, Zaida hesitated slightly before committing to the plan laid down in front of her in white paper and black ink. The restoration of civilian control and abolition of wartime measures, a step back to the conventional system under the Advisory Council headed by the TBT - she knew she should feel relieved.\n\nThere, it was done in one almost peaceful stroke of the pen. The princess sincerely hoped that it would be enough to silence this urge gnawing at her, the desire to scrap all this democratic silliness and truly rule Aestlonia. Indeed, with each step of the servants summoned to deliver the newest royal act to Winter Qalam, the malevolent thoughts retreated. Soothed by the sudden release, Zaida told herself that it was exactly what she wanted - for tradition to be upheld, for citizens to trust her, for harmony to stay."

Although Zaida was not too worried by the possibility, she was pleased to see that the new title did not seem to affect their relationship.\n\n"I appreciate the kind offer, but I am perfectly alright." With a nod of approval the princess further punctuated her satisfaction. "I am simply getting into the habit of visiting my prime minister on a regular basis."\n\nThe ceremony of Winter’s appointment was a modest, but dignified affair. Many members of the newly assembled Advisory Council were delighted by the outcome, and live broadcasts of congratulatory notes as well as of the inaugural speech by the stallion himself could be heard in every village and flat block across the country. Wishing to emphasize the partition of power, Zaida took only a ceremonial role in the proceedings, pushing a proper working meeting to a later date - namely, today.\n\n"This nascent tradition warms my heart, Your Majesty." He smiled politely, but with a tint of sincerity. "I can only repeat the past gratitudes. The wisdom you have demonstrated, the unity you inspire in our nation, the hope you have brought to the lands, all promise a wonderful future, and I am ready to serve it."\n\nThe wave of compliments carried the princess high, until it suddenly came crashing down with a single utterance, honestly meant as a crowning praise.\n\n"Your mother would be so very proud.""

aestloniamonarchy.14.d:0 "Despite some criticism, albeit masked by courtly decorum and reverence towards the victorious princess, Zaida felt confident about the choice she made. It was high time to show Aestlonia the full capabilities of monarchy in general and the reigning monarch in particular, with the AGWU being the ultimate connection to the land and the populace.\n\nNonetheless, politics rarely presented a single straight road forward and there was another question to settle. Realizing Zaida's new leanings with remarkable swiftness, the Red Crown movement, a smaller socialist force within the nation, made an active effort to reach out to the throne. Their leader, princess Lumi, descendant of nobility Särav Org, had always been vocal about the possibilities of reintroducing and improving the ancient ways of direct cooperation between the aristocracy and the collective of workers and peasants. Endorsing her followers could allow for a smoother transition into a more equitable future as well as benefit from their pre-developed plans.\n\nAnother option, which made the already struggling cautious part of Zaida’s mind cry in desperation, was to get on with attending to the demands and needs of the AGWU as a whole. While it was undoubtedly bringing the princess closer to the common creatures, there was always a risk of too radical a change being introduced too quickly - but was not this exactly the point?"

A scarlet pavilion decorated with traditional ornaments was erected in palace gardens on her orders, and many talented adepts of "folk arts" were hired to perform for the two princesses - singers, musicians, dancers, ice carvers and more. Underneath the veil of vermillion the guest of honor and her royal hostess enjoyed a vibrant showing of rustic Aestlonian ways, but the festivities eventually gave way to business.\n\n"It was simply beautiful, my cherished cousin." Lumi smiled with an equal degree of grace and candor. "Many happy memories of my foalhood come from celebrations such as this. I am honored to be here, yet I cannot help but notice that there is something on your mind."\n\nCaught in a moment of contemplation, Zaida instinctively pulled up the impenetrable mask of authority. However, there was something about her companion which made openness a more appealing option.\n\n"I do believe that there is much we can accomplish together. Still, I wonder who will truly benefit from this cooperation." Seeing Lumi’s arising concern, she hurried to clarify her words. "Do not be alarmed, my remark is entirely self-deprecating. Such displays are the only window in the true life of our subjects I have deigned to look through till now. Can one with so little knowledge be a leader worthy of our shared ideals?"\n\nThe answer came with resounding determination. "Perhaps not from the onset, no. But you have made the most important step - and now I will do everything in my power to teach you.""

aestloniamonarchy.16.d:0 "Although she had her own reservations, Zaida was willing to concede that the radio company contracted by the palace staff performed a spectacular job transforming one of the royal chambers into a broadcasting center. Unlike many fellow aristocrats, she welcomed technological advancement with an open heart, but the very message that she intended to send across the nation made her doubt the occasion.\n\nEverything was ready for the grand event, and the corporate liaison indicated that her majesty could start at her leisure. Still, Zaida felt in need of more assurance. Dismissing the workers and the servants, she summoned her newest advisor - just Lumi, no title - for a private chat. This change was exactly the one she hoped to discuss.\n\n"I find myself hesitating." Quickly dealing away with the greetings, the young ruler went straight to the heart of the matter. "There is power in words, and our positions bring gravitas, authority. I agree with the symbolism of casting them away, but why would anyone follow me as a common mare?"\n\n"It is important to take such a step seriously, of course. Still, the honorifics hold little substance. Take the society of Kelpies, for instance." Delighted that her example picked Zaida's interest, Lumi continued. "The translators called the one leading them a "queen", but no water-dweller would agree with our usual definition of one. She had no legal power, wielding trust and faith freely given by others instead. These mighty weapons are already yours, and you must be unbound to use them properly."\n\nOnce again, the ardor of her companion brought up the spirit of the princess-soon-not-to-be, and in another ten minutes the signal bearing incredible news soared."

aestloniamonarchy.17.d:0 ""So, are you going to finally tell me where we are headed?" Zaida was not terribly used to canters through the wilderness, but she was fit enough to keep up without too much trouble. "It's not that I do not appreciate nature. Very... picturesque."\n\n"Do not worry. While the forests of my home are majestic, I would not presume you would find them very different from the royal preserves." Chuckling, Lumi turned onto a path leading down to an overgrown ravine.\n\nWhile the younger mare did her best to hazard a guess regarding the final goal, reality managed to one-up even the most daring expectations. Performing a triumphant bow, her companion pushed away the final pine branches, revealing an unusual clearing. Underneath soft mist laid three small lakes, surrounded by snowless ground and filled with chirpily bubbling water. Before Zaida fully rationalized that she saw a simple hot spring, another surprise came down, or rather jumped in - leaving her coat behind, Lumi had already occupied one of the pools.\n\n"Come on, join in!" Giddy at the astonishment caused by her stunt, the older pony raised up a small wave with her hoof.\n\n"I... Um... Just like that?" Blushing, her companion made an uncertain movement, half-stepping forward, half-reaching for the clasp of her cloak.\n\n"Nobody's watching. And you would not be cold. Look at me!" Lumi snorted and winked. "Also, didn't you tell me you were interested in our customs? Best way to learn is to try." Noticing the bits of stuck hesitation, she risked pushing a little further. "Do not tell me you are scared?"\n\nThe unsophisticated, yet reliable bait worked perfectly, and soon the humble lakes housed both of the most important creatures in Aestlonia."

True, she did not feel completely at ease with leaving the TBT behind, but she would never call it "betrayal". She did her duty as the sovereign, and chose the path which would bring greater benefit to Aestlonia out of her own volition - would it be fair to the creatures in her care to discard such an opportunity just because of tradition?\n\nAs she gazed at the map of the South, her doubts quickly gave way to excited anticipation. The socialist movement would become a mighty force of innovation, and Zaida would be the trailblazer, the real deal, the pony who was brave enough to welcome this new world. Of course, such immense potential - amply fueled by the ambition running hot - could not be contained within the limit of national borders, even considering their recent expansion."

"This initiative is but a single step towards greater equine unity throughout our beloved nation..."\n\nZaida was overseeing the gathering of hundreds of creatures from her private lounge erected in the corner of the town square. So far, everything went swimmingly, and she quietly mused if her advisors were being overly cautious regarding the rising troubles with the new subjects, and if her presence here was truly warranted. Then, in a blink of an eye, Tartarus broke loose.\n\n"Down with long necks! Karkads are bastards! Throw invaders out!"

"This is precisely my wish and the reason for my choice: for the creatures of our lands to prosper."\n\n"Well, not to groom my own mane, but you doing what you did was exactly the thing. Of course, that's also another pickaxe in the shaft." The newest royal advisor huffed and tapped her front hooves, as if getting ready for something.\n\n"Please, I am all ears." The colorful expression was hardly familiar to the princess, and she chose to react with due caution.\n\n"Exactly. I mean, exactly, you. Ahem." The workers' leader grimaced. "This is big, your majesty. Many eyes are on us, on you especially. The AGWU is wary, but hopeful, and the same goes for me as their official representative.

"Your organization claims to represent socialist ideals in Aestlonia. However, many creatures that have been given membership recently cannot be called workers in the natural sense of the word. Do you consider yourself a novel theorist of communism? Or is this a compromise you had to take on due to the recent changes of policies in Varjupaik?"\n\nWithout changing her expression, the mare took a step forward, causing the interviewer to instinctively back away a bit. "Underneath all that there is a fair question which deserves a fair answer." Although she did not raise her voice, every new word carried a further spark of energy and fervor. "Yes, the miners and the farmers deserve support and our community depends on them. But what about independent shopkeepers? Librarians and forresters? Actors and poets? Do they not deserve real representation? Are they not as important for their fellow creatures who we strive to serve, for the culture that unites us? Please, go ahead - tell me who exactly should be excluded from the AWGU."\n\nBoth the verbal barrage and the sudden realization of Raud's sheer size made the stallion shrink even further.

However, here and now, beneath the sooted roof of a smelter factory, she did her best to stay calm at this very sight.\n\nThe director was not worried about the princess' immediate behavior: the young monarch was learning on the fly and skillfully applying charm to cover for some gaps in knowledge of the common folk culture. No, the issue was with her attitude in general, as she faced her new "mission" with reckless abandon, setting up a visit after visit after visit wherever she was wanted, and there was hardly a place across Aestlonia which rejected the opportunity to host Zaida. With such a breakneck pace something had to give, and unfortunately the seams were bursting around security. Her majesty traveled around with minimal escort, eschewed screening procedures and despite Raud's numerous attempts to talk her out of such careless practices, was absolutely not willing to change her plans. "I trust my people", she declared proudly, "and they need to see this clearly if I am to receive their trust in turn".\n\nFortunately, another assembly was coming to a peaceful end.

An older stallion wearing overalls and a patched jacket was coming closer rapidly, appearing to be almost out of breath.\n\n"Loading up the fertilizer?" The burlap bag with a crudely scribbled symbol resembling "F" definitely smelled right, even though that could be said about most things in this barn.\n\n"Eh? That? Ooh!" The farmer by the name of Mottle Moss wheezed and cackled for some time, stopping only after noticing the growing concern on his companion’s face. "It’s peat. I guess all of our brown thingamajigs look the same to you city folks. You should have seen one of your lot dragging in an old wasp nest when asked for wood, poor clopper."\n\nOpting for caution, Shiver produced a polite laugh. This affair with the lottery to spend some time in a remote cottage - a recent government initiative to better connect urban and rural populations - was nothing like a vacation. Of course, he knew that this life required physical work, but the volume of labor and the complete unfamiliarity with its specifics was almost overwhelming.\n\n"So I’m afraid you’ll have to scoop that out of the barrel back in the sack and start again." Moss grimaced. "Come on, I’ll give you a hoof.""
aestloniamonarchy.23.a:0 "At least, the locals were friendly in their own way."
aestloniamonarchy.24.t:0 "Trying On For Size"
aestloniamonarchy.24.d:0 ""So, that's our great and terrible monarch." The pony before Zaida and Steel Raud snickered. "If someone told me a year ago I'd ever give any schmoozing reactionary a time of day, I would probably kick their teeth in. No offense."\n\n"None taken." Assuming a relaxed posture, the princess went for a suitably friendly tone. "I've heard quite a bit regarding the many talents of Raske Nael."\n\nA hoarse full-blown laugh followed, but the mare in question was not able to provide a punchy answer just yet, as the director bluntly interrupted her. "I'm sorry, your majesty, but I think it's best if I have a word with my friend here in private." She fixed her stare on Raske as if trying to restrain her with an intense gaze.\n\nMaintaining her innate composure, Zaida only nodded and stepped back, allowing both of them to move past her into the hall. Seeing someone larger than Raud was unusual and a bit intimidating, but she was also rather surprised by her strong reaction. After Raske shut the door behind them, quickly squeezing in an exaggerated eye roll, the young ruler remained alone in the room. Although she was able to while away the time by examining clippings of socialist newspapers and tank sketches decorating the walls, the dour expression on the face of her companion when the pair returned clearly indicated that their talk was even less productive.\n\n"Sorry. Matters of national security. Specifically, your security." Raske, however, remained perfectly cheerful. "And such a pretty thing needs that for sure."\n\nAfter exchanging quick glances, Zaida and Raud silently decided to let the odd comment slide, demonstrating, respectively, wisdom and frustration."
aestloniamonarchy.24.a:0 "Creatures are strange when you are a stranger."
aestloniamonarchy.25.t:0 "Glories To Come"
aestloniamonarchy.25.d:0 "For Zaida there was nothing like the feeling of almost-triumph, the exhilaration of the final stretch, the sheer thrill at the end of the chase. There was no denying that her Aestlonia, once ready to topple over from the external and internal instabilities, stood not only fully recovered, but united and prosperous like never before. While she allowed herself to enjoy the fruits of stately labors, there was more to be done. A project shamefully failed by the first princesses with their attempts to negotiate with Arabians, the one her mother did not even attempt due to perceived hostilities, would become the underpinning achievement of this period, a true turning point for the nation."
aestloniamonarchy.25.a:0 "Hestraya is within reach."
aestloniamonarchy.26.t:0 "A Request From The South"
aestloniamonarchy.26.d:0 "After the war in the east has finally ended, the idea of a pan-Hestrayan state has been steadily growing in popularity. It comes as no surprise that our neighbors or their ruling circles harbor similar beliefs, but it is today they made their position official. We are receiving diplomatic communication from Aestlonia, a detailed project of uniting our governments and infrastructure. While it is clear that the Maretonian elite would lose a considerable amount of influence in this potential combined nation, the benefits to welfare and security are undeniable. Furthermore, there are rumors that more drastic measures might be introduced should we refuse."
aestloniamonarchy.26.a:0 "Let us make this happen."
aestloniamonarchy.26.b:0 "There is a reason to have two countries."
aestloniamonarchy.27.t:0 "Family Reunion"
aestloniamonarchy.27.d:0 "It had been quite a while since the palace hosted both daughters of the late princess Rawiya, but Moonika, the elderly royal groundskeeper, fondly recalled these times. There was a catching liveliness in the air when a herd of noble foals played around the mighty evergreens and flowering bushes, and much of this energy was owed to its leaders, the dynamic duo of sisters, easily the best and brightest of the bunch. Unfortunately, the struggles of reality separated the two siblings and curbed these gatherings, but the plants persevered and so did their custodian.\n\nNeedless to say, she met the news of the northern delegation's arrival with joy. The gardens were adorned with the carefully selected decorations, and Moonika was proud to welcome the ruler of Aestlonia and the duchess of Maretonia in her domain after the official reception. A private talk between them was long overdue, and as the trees listened to the words of happiness and belated understanding, the venerable pony kept to her post alone, relieved to see the peaceful fruits of the past."
aestloniamonarchy.27.a:0 "The darker path was avoided with wisdom and grace."
aestloniamonarchy.28.t:0 "Never Over"
aestloniamonarchy.28.d:0 "To accept the Maretonian rejection was absolutely impossible for Zaida. Almost any argument for it would easily break against the tide of hatred and ire rising in her mind. How did they dare, the ungrateful fools? Did they have no understanding of the needs of their people, of the Hestrayan destiny, of the ponykind future? The poison of arrogance spreading among the upper classes or the rot of foreign influence, their reasons mattered not.\n\nAlthough she knew that using force would carry grievous implications for the lands and those who lived there, Zaida could tell herself that there was no other option. Nothing, be it concern for her own image, relations with or even safety of her sister, would make her drop the issue now for one simple reason."
aestloniamonarchy.28.a:0 "She had given the order to start the invasion an hour ago."
aestloniamonarchy.29.t:0 "Cornerstone Set"
aestloniamonarchy.29.d:0 "Just a few years ago, if someone told Zaida that she was going to throw her lot in with a group of radical "Aesgyptians", her reaction would be a mix of mild amusement and bewilderment. Here and now, in the sacred halls of the pyramids, the latter still held a place in her thoughts, but the former came to be an inspired confidence instead, further underpinned by her latest achievement.\n\nThere was no two ways about it, together with her new allies they had reached something monumental. United Hestraya was not a plan on a piece of paper, but a glorious reality. Even Ntrôm and Pikhimphe had put their rivalry on hold to graciously congratulate their honored ruler and each other. Yet, the rest and reconciliation lasted only for a spell, as a much greater prize awaited."
aestloniamonarchy.29.a:0 "The promised homecoming seemed more than a mad dream."
aestloniamonarchy.30.t:0 "According To Plan"
aestloniamonarchy.30.d:0 ""It is a wonderful thing, when everything comes together, is it not, Mr. Prime Minister?" Zaida produced a carefully managed half-smile, which only half-covered her excitement. "Would it be terribly banal of me to say that we are facing a new era?"\n\n"As we have clearly seen, Your Majesty, there is nothing wrong with a tried and tested approach." Tilting his head slightly, Winter Qalam chuckled. "A degree of indulgence is definitely warranted."\n\n"Then indulge I shall!" With a distinctly protocol-breaking wink, the princess tapped her hooves impatiently. "I wish to oversee the preparations for unification celebrations across the country. Could I count on your help?"\n\n"Naturally, Your Majesty." The stallion could have mentioned the other more practical matters such as integration of Maretonian administration or standardization of infrastructure, but he understood the importance of triumph well. For now, his monarch deserved a repose."
aestloniamonarchy.30.a:0 "This new era promised to be brighter and gentler."
aestloniamonarchy.31.t:0 "Red Hammered"
aestloniamonarchy.31.d:0 ""'Cause I am the leader of the workers..." Lumi tried to keep the lyric flowing, but much as her own gait it did not come out steady at all. However, both these facts hardly bothered her and she bursted out laughing.\n\n"Just a few steps more. We’re almost there." While it felt somewhat strange to be the more responsible one, Zaida could hardly blame her friend for getting a bit too relaxed. After all, a celebration of Hestraya reborn was a singular occasion, and the effort poured by Lumi into the process was equally substantial.\n\n"Yes. Yes. Thank you, darling. Dear cousin." The older mare managed to cross the last bit of the hallway almost without leaning on her companion. "Oooh, that’s my room. I can take it from here."\n\n"Are you sure? I could send for a maid? Or just give you a hoof myself?" Zaida's face was painted with such an earnest concern that Lumi chuckled again.\n\n"No, don't bother the poor servants. The fun is theirs too. And there’s no amount of drink I can't handle. Not to say I do not appreciate the offer." After pushing the door in, she glanced back with a smile. "Go and rest. Or better yet, party some more. With such a thing we did, all the things we did, there will soon be enough work for ten not-princesses.""
aestloniamonarchy.31.a:0 "The hot iron was struck into the shape of a united land."
aestloniamonarchy.32.t:0 "From Dream To Nightmare"
aestloniamonarchy.32.d:0 "Steel Raud was not used to crying. Still, she would pay any price to turn her anguished weeping back into a few somber tears of pride, the very same pride she felt this morning when her princess addressed the enormous crowd of common Aestlonians. Zaida spoke on the success of the long-awaited unification of Hestraya and the bright future. More so than usual, her words carried passion and hope, and, naturally, there was no real security to speak of. No, her majesty wished to share the triumph with her beloved people.\n\nRaud shuddered and banged her hoof against a small table in front of her, leaving a sizable dent in the lacquered surface. It was her own fault. Of course, Zaida was naive, but she had chosen her chief advisor, and it was the duty of said advisor to keep the young ruler safe. Since the warnings had not been heard, she should have... It did not matter. Scarcely a thing mattered now, when the mind kept returning to a cracking bang, and then a single yelp of pain drowned in an ocean of screams. The life of the greatest visionary of the south was snuffed in an instant by a bullet, worse, the vile criminal remained at large and unknown. Although the director was expected to lead the country through these darkest days, Raud knew that she did not have it in her to carry on the torch."
aestloniamonarchy.32.a:0 "Unfortunately, she knew exactly the mare who did."
aestloniamonarchy.33.t:0 "Promise Of Retribution"
aestloniamonarchy.33.d:0 ""Didn't I tell you that guts are no substitute for brains, Raud? And that a pretty face does very little against a gun?" Leaning back in the armchair, Raske Nael shrugged dismissively and was prepared to spout another impertinent comment. Yet, the sorry sight of her friend squeezed enough sympathy to make her reconsider.\n\nEven though several days had passed after Zaida's assassination, the time did nothing for the director's composure. She visibly trembled, her mane running wild, the streams of tears turning her eyes red with the fur beneath them matted. The most daunting shift in the dingiest mine would never bring her anywhere close to this state.\n\n"There, there." Raske awkwardly reached out for a half-hug. "A right Tartarus-forged mess we got ourselves into, huh, pal?" Her voice rang deep, calmly if not softly, and Steel Raud buried herself in the embrace for a while, taking in every bit of the provided comfort.\n\n"I have a favor to ask. You are the only one I have left. Please." Despite the words coming out weakly, there was a hint of determination behind them. "I can't do this anymore. I have to step down. But you can. Set things right. Make them pay. For me. For her majesty."\n\nA more cautious pony could mull the offer over. A more compassionate pony could try to turn Raud's mind away, just for a brief moment. A more temperate pony would postpone such an important decision till the director could think straight. Of course, Raske was none of these things."
aestloniamonarchy.33.a:0 "A new course for Hestraya broken through."

aestloniacoup.1.t:0 "A New Path Forward"
aestloniacoup.1.d:0 "When Sayif walked onto the podium in front of the mic, the cascade of voices below her only seemed to indicate the same mood within everybody — concern and anger. She could not blame them, however, for in many ways she felt the same. For the sake of them and the nation, she had to be strong. She had to root out the evil that was the Millenary Path and all the other leeches preying upon them, before she could entrust Aestlonia back to it's people.\n\n"Fellow citizens of this great nation," she began. "I know the strife in your hearts, the struggles all of you had to face. Wars, cults, division and now war. In a short span of time, our land has been tested over and over again. It is enough to make anyone despair and long for the better times. But this does not have to be our future!"\n\nTaking a deep breath, she continued.\n\n"In my time as a warrior and now a soldier, I have learnt a lot. And something that has always stuck out to me was the value of temperance. To make a sword, iron has to be melted and then casted into one. A weapon's limits can only be known when it is subjected to grueling field tests. And a soldier can be sharpened into a disciplined weapon when they are put to their limits."\n\nWith a hoof pointing out to crowd, she spoke loud and clear.\n\n"You have all been tempered by these events! You have fought together for this country like the brave soldiers you are! All of you, regardless of clan or creed. But our fight isn't over yet. For within our ranks, there remain deserters! Treasonous traitors that would bring chaos to our lands than care for her! So I urge you all to fight on! Purge the remaining evil from within our country! Help me...and I shall promise you a better Aestlonia! A greater Aestlonia! One that won't succumb to being a frozen carcass, but will live on for a thousand years!""

But enough of stroking her own ego, Sayif has a clear task she wants to complete as a "president", and it really doesn't involve much in the way of internal policy or reform, instead the main thing she wishes to do is to take out those who hurt Aestlonia and its people in the past. First she plans to secure Hestraya as a way to get more resources, also punishing Karkadannistan in the process. And, finally, she plans on ending Yeti rule over the Stormlands, that menace needs to be put down for good, and she will sacrifice anything and everything to see it happen."

Royal first takes it as a joke before saying he won't do it. Sayif says she doesn't care if he wants it or not, since, as she notes, she has info that he planned to coup her, and if he doesn't change that name she will act upon this information.

The scene in this event is with Storm Alsaqie being sat on her flank with ropes around her body, with the officer that drops her off asking why Sayif didn't order Storm's armor to be removed or why even wanted the cultist leader alive, Sayif tells the officer to leave without answering his questions. After he is gone Sayif slowly grabs and unsheathes a long sword that she had layed upon a table nearby inside of the generously-sized the two find themselves inside. The cultist simply looks coldly at Sayif, only blinking when the mare swung the sword at her direction, Storm gets mildly suprised by the fact she's still alive and unharmed after she opens her eyes, with the only thing that changed being that her ropes have been cut. Before the cultist can even act confused Sayif tosses her a different sword, by reflect the other pegasus quickly grabs the object with one of her wings. Sayif then commands Storm to stand up, saying she won't kill a mare in such a cowardly way, since she's better than the cultist and her flock, instead they will have a fair battle of skill, with the winner being the one left standing by the end. Storm surprisingly cracks a slight grin at this offer of battle and nods in agreement. The battle is very brief, Sayif has much more control and skill with a sword than Storm ever had, this being because Sayig used to love "playing knight" when she was younger, even got imported Griffonian books when she was older just to study the art of the sword and the knights. Meanwhile Storm only ever used daggers, and that being against ponies who couldn't fight back."

Sayif tells Alter to leave Aestlonia in the date written on the ticket, telling her to never come back or else she will have to act upon it. Alter asks why Sayif bothered doing all of this for her, considering the mares weren't exactly in the best of terms, Sayif looks away and blushes slightly, she tells Alter to just leave and to not make it harder on her."

Soon this new teacher starts talking about how crucial it is to know about the position of the army in the politics of the nation, this teacher points to the low-ranking pony and asks him what this position is. The pony scoffs as this one is easy, he says that the army shouldn't mess with the politics of a nation, that was day 1 stuff, to always be neutral and to always defend the country no matter what. The teacher quite loudly says that he is wrong and that is this type of thinking that allows for cowards and psychos to come to power as the army will always protect them.

Alongside them there are other lower-ranking ponies who are handing out pamphlets telling the populace about the coming war for Hestraya and why they should either join the army or buy bonds to support it.

She knew she would need to focus on the next step of the plan soon, but there's time for a little gloating with a side of champagne.

The mare grabs what's left of that bottle of champagne she drank during the unification of Hestraya, she doesn't care for a fancy glass, instead she drinks it from the bottle instead until it's fully empty, all in a single breath. After she's done she throws the bottle at the ground and watches it break.

But that isn't the only reason, a good part of this decision was only because she wanted to show the world she had triumphed, while also further breaking the morale of the Yetis by showing that they had lost to a puny pony and were now "led" by one. Sayif can barely contain her overflowing emotions, she decides it's best to take a walk so she can clear her mind and figure out her next steps from here, these walks are a common thing for her.

Sayif is able to put quite the fight against the beast, showing that she isn't a pony to be thrown around, but ultimately loses to him as he simply is more physically strong and tall. Sayif ends up with her back against the ground, the mare closes her eyes and even cracks a bit of a smile, almsot like she's accepting that she fought a fair battle and lost, and now she's getting her just punishment of death.

Sayif gets furious and jumps to her four hooves like she hadn't just been in a fight, telling him to never give his back to her and demands to know what is his deal. This causes the creature to turn his attention towards her and approach the pony, he then pulls out a quite damaged piece of paper that he was hiding under his armor and hands it to Sayif who picks it with a wing. She checks the piece of paper handed to her and soon realizes it is a drawing, pictured in this drawing is the bust of a pony, one with a broken horn and a scar across one of her eyes. Sayif glances over at the Storm Creature, having to strain her neck a bit to be able to make eye contact, she asks who this is and why does it matter, the creature doesn't say a thing. Sayif makes a comment about how the creature doesn't talk much (mostly as a joke for herself in order to break the tension a bit) and therefore decides she will probably need to guess what this means."

Sayif then finally connects the points and asks if this pony was some sort of commander, which the creature nods in response. Looking back at the drawing for some help she can't really figure out what armor the pony is wearing, it isn't one she remembers from any country around here, but soon she notices that it is a little similar to what the Storm King's yetis used to wear. Her final question then is if this pony was one of "their own", as in sided with the Storm King, the creature nods once more in a seemingly happy way. Before Sayif can make any more questions the creature simply pats her in the head and leaves, leaving the marshal a bit confused, but feeling a little inspired."

Instead she ponders back to the past encounter with that Storm Creature, bringing out the drawing of that pony once again from a internal pocket of her coat, she having kept it there ever since the encounter. Sayif stares at the drawing for a bit and thinks once more about the concept of a pony leading Yetis, maybe she could try to play a little nicer and lead these creatures? Maybe with her leadership she could direct their destructive potential into something better, something more. Sure, this clearly wasn't her original mission and the boys back at Hestraya might get mad at her slipping a bit into supremacy and yeti-tolerance, but she is the president and the marshal, only her opinion matters."

### Amza events ###
aestloniaamza.1.t:0 "It Begins"
aestloniaamza.1.d:0 "A zebra sat in a comfortable office chair. At the same time, a zebra was looking at her from the front page of a newspaper neatly laid out on the table. There were more than a lot of physical similarities between them, and timewise only a few days separated the two, but the difference was strong enough to warrant distinction.\n\nThe creature depicted under the headline "Amza Outtara Snatches Election Win" was smiling broadly and triumphantly, radiating with cheer. The article went on to summarize her victory speech, a message of hope and cooperation, adorned with a promise of moderate reforms strengthened by historical Aestlonian affinity for harmony. Naturally, the new president had also mentioned her "Great Plan" and the awesome potential of the "Great Lake traditions" to bring on a unique blend of socialism, one never seen before.\n\nWhile the real Amza also smiled, hers was a thin smirk of anticipation, and the red eyes glimmered with a calculating coldness. The real changes had to be slow, but nothing would stop her now. Every move, every minute brought the liberation of her homeland closer, and an even wilder goal awaited beyond, a dream of the few yearning for the completion of many. Briefly meeting the gaze of her carefully constructed reflection, the zebra put the article away."
aestloniaamza.1.a:0 "The dawning sun outside was a shade of crimson."
aestloniaamza.2.t:0 "Harmonic Concerns"
aestloniaamza.2.d:0 ""I do hope that I do not come across as inconsiderate." Snow Qalam spoke with rather annoying sincerity. "The burdens of leadership can be quite daunting, but it is my duty as the leader of the TBT and a fellow believer in the harmonic course to..."\n\n"You have no reason to worry." It took Amza some effort to keep herself from frowning. "I remember my election promises and fully intend to collaborate with you on these matters. The current measures are nothing but a stopgap to reverse the damage done by the recent troubles and to smooth the rough edges of our military period. You have my word - my only goal is to make it right for every creature, no exceptions, no barriers, no preconceptions of the old divided society."\n\n"I am quite happy to know that." Distracted by the demonstrated passion, the pony chose to believe that she was heard. "In this case, my party will be expecting to hear from you on the points we have been discussing soon." She bowed slightly and arose from her seat.\n\n"I can already see some of the plans you have proposed fitting perfectly with my intentions. I am sure we can work on the rest too. Farewell, and thanks for the visit." Amza maintained the friendly expression right until Snow stepped out of the door, but then propped her head on her hooves and sighed deeply."
aestloniaamza.2.a:0 "A necessary distraction, but a distraction still."
aestloniaamza.3.t:0 "Warning Sign"
aestloniaamza.3.d:0 "Despite her prior prominence in the AWGU, Amza had never been particularly close with its former director, Steel Raud. Thus, an invitation for a dinner at the pony’s house was rather unexpected. Fully ready for some sort of a hidden agenda, the president still decided to make the visit, out of curiosity and appearances both. Still, she was further pleasantly surprised by an unpretentious conversation and a hearty meal.\n\n"Sometimes I wonder if many creatures miss a simpler calling in their life." Amza allowed herself a little chuckle and pushed the plate away. "You are quite a cook. This stew was simply excellent."\n\n"Thanks. Sort of a family recipe." Nodding, Raud leaned back. "It was good to meet like this. Build a bit of a connection. Actually, since all that was a success, I have a thing to say. You see, there was this letter about you."\n\n"What letter?" The zebra instantly changed her tone to be sharper, almost accusatory. "What did it say? Who wrote it?"\n\n"It was anonymous. As for its contents, see for yourself." While she remained calm, the hostess frowned as she produced an unmarked envelope from the pocket of her shirt and passed it on. "Some ramblings about you being, how was it put exactly? A great danger masked by a cloth-thin disguise and an enemy of all harmonic and good. Or something like that. Appears to be a mean prank."\n\nReading these words printed in black made Amza’s stripes turn almost as white as the paper which carried them. Finally, she lifted her gaze. "Such despicable, vile, reactionary slander. I cannot imagine who would try to spread it, but I will find out and take care of them. Showing this to me was a great act of service to our country, comrade.""
aestloniaamza.3.a:0 "She left the house after a curt farewell, fuming."
aestloniaamza.4.t:0 "Talking The Talk"
aestloniaamza.4.d:0 "The business of political negotiation was proving to be more than an occasional nuisance. Another meeting with the TBT went fine at best, and all the hoof-shaking and saccharine politeness tested the limits of Amza's patience yet again. These creatures had the gall to disapprove the president, to make demands of her! If the walls of her office were soundproof, she would yell the frustration away, but instead she had to make do with angrily scratching signatures on the worthless bills aimed at placating the "opposition". However, a single pulsing thought made the process tolerable."
aestloniaamza.4.a:0 "Their time would end very soon."
aestloniaamza.5.t:0 "A Bit Of Poaching"
aestloniaamza.5.d:0 "The gradual dismantling of the lingering monarchist political network centered around the Varjupaik palace made Amza think about garbage disposal, or perhaps dusting. She had never considered the former princess to be interesting or inspiring. Zaida was just a filly, a royal brat with the usual mix of pride and stupidity found in her kind. Nonetheless, there was one item to be found in the wreckage of her otherwise unimpressive agenda which showed some potential.\n\nAs it stood, the old government documents describing the secret plans for the reunification of Hestraya dutifully explored every available option. Despite the aristocratic diplomacy clearly being off the table, the military option was very much applicable, and it would be a shame to waste a passable set up for Amza's own glorious invasion - pardon, liberation."
aestloniaamza.5.a:0 "The somber torch was passed to burn with glee."
aestloniaamza.6.t:0 "Mutual Understanding"
aestloniaamza.6.d:0 ""Comrade Marshal." Despite indulging her desire to mix the old and the new, Amza was keenly aware that it would not be wise to antagonize Golden Sayif outright. "I presume you wanted to discuss the recent developments with the horse population?"\n\n"This is exactly right, President Outtara." The time did little to improve the pony's bluntness, while the sharpness of the military-grade tone prevented any interruptions. "Your little working camps project. I am surprised, truly. Would not expect a socialist to put a hoof down in a manner this efficient. Personally, I would have gone with an emphasis on payback, but raw efficiency is also not bad."\n\nThe outright approval surprised the zebra to say the least. Still, she collected her wits quickly and donned a genuine grin, much more wide and wicked than her usual forced smirk reserved for polite society. "Indeed, not bad at all. The road to redemption can be quite satisfying. You know, something tells me we both failed to give each other full credit with all the recent turmoils. Since you are honoring me with your visit now, how about we rectify this unfortunate oversight?" In a moment, a bottle of wine and two glasses appeared from under the table."
aestloniaamza.6.a:0 "The returned smile was equally dark."
aestloniaamza.7.t:0 "Change Of Routine"
aestloniaamza.7.d:0 "The most important rule in the life of a campaigner according to Crispy Wind was to get up early. After all, by distributing the colorful pamphlets quickly enough, she would have a lot of time to go around the district she was entrusted with and talk to the interested or soon-to-be-interested creatures. That was why she was trotting between the houses alone in the very early hours, getting neatly packaged information under every door with practiced motions and a bit of telekinetic magic. Everything promised to be just as great as a very successful yesterday.\n\nA figure appeared in front of her suddenly, right as she turned around another street corner. Startled, Crispy took a step back.\n\n"Internal Regulations." The large zebra in a thick overcoat spoke in a deep, commanding voice. "You are performing activities with a clear intent of weakening the presidency. This is your only warning, with severe repercussions for another breach of conduct."\n\n"What? Not at all, you got this all wrong, this is just some helpful stuff regarding the TBT! Nothing illegal here!" Although the unicorn tried to protest, the government officer nonchalantly snatched the pile of leaflets away from her weakened aura.\n\n"The only warning, citizen. You would do well to remember it". He gave her a hard stare and turned around to leave, while Crispy, still shocked, could only watch as her political freedoms walked away..."
aestloniaamza.7.a:0 "...into the red dawn."
aestloniaamza.8.t:0 "Investment Choice"
aestloniaamza.8.d:0 "A prudent policy in the matters of economy and work distribution had left the state budget with a healthy surplus. However, even this most generous amount of funds could not cover all the potential needs of the country. Thus, president Outtara was faced with a dilemma: prioritize the civilian industry and strengthen the trust in the regime, or focus on the military complex, ever-important for the future campaigns."
aestloniaamza.8.a:0 "We need to keep up the appearances."
aestloniaamza.8.b:0 "The Great Plan bids to equip its agents well."
aestloniaamza.9.t:0 "Exception"
aestloniaamza.9.d:0 "If one could pick up the surface layer of Alter Tähenduses’ thoughts, they would find themselves surrounded by an ocean of criticisms of the incarceration system. The prison facility was hopelessly outdated, and the government was clinging to the archaic and largely pointless methods of running the whole institution. She could have done so much more, especially now, blessed with the first-hoof experience...\n\nThis last fact, however, would lead one deeper, towards the desperately repressed, drowning part of the mind. She should have left immediately after the elections. To Equus, or even Griffonia, wherever. When the door to her cell opened with a clang, a single idea managed to breach the containment: the communists had come to finish her, to tie up the last loose end of the Tartarus-damned cult.\n\n"Comrade Tähenduses. I will not beat around the bush. You know what happened to all the creatures convicted of collaboration with the Millenary Path." Amza cast a glance at the mare over her tinted glasses. The glamour of the banker completely crumbled into a somewhat pathetic, uncouth appearance. "Yet, there is a need for a loyal creature of your political leanings. If you are willing to help Aestlonia out, it would be my pleasure to publicly disprove the regrettable conspiracy theories regarding your, shall we say, personal involvement and grant a full pardon."\n\nAt full strength, the businesspony might have risked to bargain. At quarter strength she would take a moment to consider the deal. Currently, however, she could barely lift her head."
aestloniaamza.9.a:0 "Anything. Just get me out."
aestloniaamza.10.t:0 "Shadow Workings Of The Sun"
aestloniaamza.10.d:0 ""The plan is on track, exactly as it is supposed to be." The zebra, who spoke with great authority, looked over her audience. "This means that all of you must continue performing your roles just as you shall not draw any attention and step out of line. Do be sure to explain this simple framework to all of the friends from the Great Lakes we are receiving, and make it perfectly clear that I expect them to bring even more newcomers."\n\n"Our brethren seek the guarantees of safety and care, Aunt. Are we to promise them these boons?" This pertinent question was painstakingly constructed so as to not offend.\n\n"The paperwork will be provided, and the funds are already invested into smoothing their arrival. However, none of us should put their trust in wealth alone. Being consistently resourceful is key. The time of our reveal draws near, and I will need everyone working above and beyond the limits."\n\n"What about the Union? Even with all our successes they might prove to be a problem." A more irreverent, doubtful comment was met with several scornful stares.\n\n"They will do exactly nothing. After all, is it not normal for a democratic president to change their party? I will take care of any resistance personally." The leader of the meeting nodded solemnly, indicating that there was nothing more to discuss. "I have spoken. Go forth and do your duty.""
aestloniaamza.10.a:0 ""Yes, Aunt Amza", the chorus of many voices boomed."
aestloniaamza.11.t:0 "Living And Learning"
aestloniaamza.11.d:0 ""Dearest Snow Qalam, there is someone I would like you to meet." Amza confidently opened the door and gestured for her companion to come inside. Another creature awaited them at the table in the conference room, a zebra wearing a much warmer clothing than both party leaders. He bowed his head respectfully.\n\n"My name is Ozano. It is a great honor to have a chance to be here, to talk to a true follower of harmony."\n\n"It seems I have already been introduced." Speaking warily, but politely, the pony stepped closer. "Judging by the discussion we had with the president, I would hazard a guess that you come to us from the Great Lakes, mister Ozano."\n\n"There is no need to beat around the bush on my part, madam. I held a high post among the Mazwi, and while I am ashamed of it, I can not bear to hide this truth either. I want to do better with my life, I am willing to make amends, any way I can. And I am not alone in this desire."\n\nClearly, this simple statement struck a chord with Snow. The unshakable belief in redemption mixed with natural curiosity and compassion lured her exactly where she was wanted. "I would be delighted to hear more. You must have given up much to have this chance."\n\n"The luxuries in bondage are great, yet..." With a deep sigh, the stallion shrugged. "Let me tell you the entire tale.""
aestloniaamza.11.a:0 "The words weaved the net and the hunter smirked to the bait."
aestloniaamza.12.t:0 "A New Path"
aestloniaamza.12.d:0 "The goal of Amza's presidency had finally been vocalized: to give each and every life equal value and potential, breaking down all the barriers, from prejudices to unduly obtained luxuries. Was this the moderate harmonic socialism some Aestlonians thought they were voting for? Hardly. Did she care for their new protests? Only from the practical standpoint. The ponies were useful, some of them could be considered comrades, but the real goal, the focus of the Great Plan, had never changed: Amza was going to return to the Great Lakes. There, in the lands of the Mazwi, her dream was formed, one of the incredible revolution, a pale imitation of which she was building over here, and there it would come to be an awesome reality."
aestloniaamza.12.a:0 "Soon, she shall get out of everyone's manes. Almost."
aestloniaamza.13.t:0 "Immersion"
aestloniaamza.13.d:0 "Shiver Drift was all up for new experiences, just like any other pony. Thus, when the "cultural enrichment center" sponsored by the government had finally opened its doors in his town, he did not hesitate to join the long queue of visitors seeking to know more about the Great Lakes. It turned out to be his lucky day, as the polite zebra official closed off the entrance for the morning showing right after allowing Shiver in.\n\nTaking up one of the last few available seats, the stallion fixed his eyes on the stage. There, a presentation was already on its way, a lovely demonstration of picturesque landscapes "brought down South by the wonders of alchemy-aided photo development", accompanied by a soothing rhythm of unusually looking drums. A duo of speakers, also striped equines, rounded up the experience with an engaging narration, starting at the ancient history of the region and the customs of its many kingdoms and tribes. Surprisingly, the part about more recent times was not as negative as Shiver expected. Instead of decrying the horrors of slavery, they focused on the great camaraderie and sense of belonging fostered in the society, casting the whole system as an enormous cauldron of change.\n\nThis metaphor hardly felt right to the pony at first, but he was willing to uphold the principles of harmony and keep his mind open. There was, perhaps, some wisdom to be found in this foreign outlook, a lesson on perseverance and unity. Besides, another cauldron, one much nicer at that, appeared soon - a pot of herby rice with deliciously smelling seasoning was passed around the audience, allowing every creature to partake in the traditional shared dinner."
aestloniaamza.13.a:0 "Those folks do know something, indeed."
aestloniaamza.14.t:0 "The First Domino"
aestloniaamza.14.d:0 "Hestraya was finally united, and by a very unlikely candidate to hoof. There were many citizens calling this the zenith of president Outtara’s term, either as a great achievement, or, rarely, privately, silently, as a terrible infringement on freedoms and harmony in the region. However, Amza herself was merely content with the progress. Instead of lavish celebrations, she locked herself into the office, meticulously working through the details of the next steps of the Great Plan.\n\nThese first months at the helm of a nation had shown that she was competent, but not infallible. Of course, such feebleness was utterly unacceptable in the face of her ultimate goal. She had one shot, and she would make it work, regardless of how much paper, ink, steel or raw creaturepower she had to use."
aestloniaamza.14.a:0 "This will be perfect. It has to be."
aestloniaamza.15.t:0 "Days Until Greatness"
aestloniaamza.15.d:0 "There was something oddly pleasing to Amza about the mere fact that she was here, in the land which was truly hers. She allowed herself to fully soak in this feeling, while her aides waited for orders, not daring to disturb their leader.\n\n"We begin the stage of dawn." Beaming with satisfaction, she spoke the long-awaited words. "Proceed with destroying all lines of communications with Hestraya and send down two groups of couriers. The first shall distribute the news about a terrible storm which disrupted our radio networks and promise a swift restoration, no more than a couple of weeks. The second will not make its presence known and go directly to Alter Tähenduses with the missives I have provided. Our little pony will know what to do."\n\nBowing deeply, her loyal zebras left to make her will known. Meanwhile, Amza took another minute to think about here, about home. "

aestloniaamza.16.t:0 "Liberation"
aestloniaamza.16.d:0 "All the pieces had finally fallen into place, and a new era was upon every creature graced by the rule of Amza Outtara. Aestlonia and the larger Hestraya were discarded as nothing more than a stepping stone, but the result was well worth the price. No pony "hero" would stop her, no ancient spirit would interfere, no mask was needed anymore, because it was all over. The great Sofa was back, and her vision, terrible to all those lacking in true understanding, was coming to life."

aestloniaamza.17.t:0 "Homecoming"
aestloniaamza.17.d:0 "While diligence and devotion were cornerstones of success, Amza knew only too well that body and mind had their limits. Yes, the questions of proper integration of her lands, of reactionary resistance, of the first gears in her glorious machine were undisputedly important, but she could afford to take a few hours for herself.\n\nWaiting for the dawn, sitting alone at the edge of cold, calm water, the zebra quietly reminisced. Some memories were sweet with success, others, especially the ones concerning her exile, tasted of bitter defeat. Nonetheless, even from them, especially from them, Amza drew strength, as every old wound scarred and every old obstacle yielded. In a flare of emotions, she arose and struck her hoof against the lake surface, shaking with triumphant anger."
aestloniaamza.17.a:0 "Her enemies failed, and she shall never suffer this fate."
aestloniaamza.18.t:0 "Assembling The Cadre"
aestloniaamza.18.d:0 "Although the ultimate outcome of Amza's system promised perfect equality, some creatures were inevitably more useful in the immediate situation. To bring the grand change around, she needed capable and loyal zebras, unafraid to do what is necessary. Three candidates were chosen to shoulder the burdens of leadership with her.\n\n"Azha Berahino." The way the leader spoke this name was almost warm and familiar. "Will you give of yourself to the Crimson Sun and my cause?"\n"There is no sacrifice worthier, no path greater." Beaming with a reverent smile, the mare nodded. "You are the promised restorer of the Mazwi, and I am eager to serve you further."\n\n"Yoro Bakaba." There was a hint of respect towards the stallion in Amza's words, but also an expectation of perfect obedience. "Will you give of yourself to the Crimson Sun and my cause?"\n"I will." The former Farima, an officer of the old regime, and now a staunch disciple, bowed his head. "I pledge you my loyalty and my strength again."\n\n"Zia Outtara." Her own sister stood in front of the zebra again after so many years, once a misguided bandit and now someone ready to be reforged for purpose. "You will give of yourself to the Crimson Sun and my cause."\n"Yes." This single word came more as a grunt, but a pointed gaze forced the rest of the prepared oath. "I shall atone for my sins and be absolved in the light.""
aestloniaamza.18.a:0 ""Rise, all, binded by vows, and carry my will.""
aestloniaamza.19.t:0 "Putting It Back Together"
aestloniaamza.19.d:0 "Just as the conquest was a test of overt strength, the peace brought its own gauntlet of subtler challenges. Walking around the liberated ancient capital of Ziani, Amza concluded that her system was managing those admirably - from tastefully refurbished buildings to wide integration of modern conveniences, everything was ready to support the heart of her state. Naturally, she could not help but stop to briefly admire a solid gold statue of herself displayed prominently in the central square, just a humble temporary monument to be replaced with a grander one celebrating inevitable new victories.\n\nThere was, however, one important notion left to consider. The resplendent city could be enhanced by an equally glorious moniker reflecting its fate, and the ideal option simply wrote itself."
aestloniaamza.19.a:0 "We do not need to go overboard."
aestloniaamza.19.b:0 "Amziani has a very nice ring to it."
aestloniaamza.20.t:0 "Question Of Legacy"
aestloniaamza.20.d:0 ""Mistress Outtara." An older zebra wearing robes once intended to bedazzle with luxurious adornments, but now faded and worn, bowed deeply. "I am ever so grateful for this audience. I carry the word from the court of our Manza Mahud, blessed be his reign. His majesty is very happy to know that such a loyalist to the cause of the Mazwi came into power and graciously wonders when the talks on the restoration of proper authority are planned to take place?"\n\nAmza smirked and took a step forward. "Never, my dearest vizier Yucel." Without letting him respond, she pressed on. "The "golden emperor" deigns to question me, pah. A failure, worse, a joke, that's who he is. I am the one who returned the glitter and gloss to the capital. I will be the one who decides what fate befalls the crown."\n\n"I s-see." When the stallion finally found his voice, it trembled with fearful realization. "Your answer is clear as star-sewn sky and I should relay it immediately..."\n\n"You go when I say you go." The order rang with steel, which was quickly sheathed in feigned politeness again. "I actually require help from a knowledgeable creature, since I have arrived at a great quandary. My achievements make it obvious that I can take the title of Manza, and it carries immediate significance. But you know history - would it not be more fitting to link myself to Zondata, the smith of Sofa legions and the great conqueror, hmm? And do speak up, if you want to stay in my good graces."\n\nHer unfortunate guest gulped."
aestloniaamza.20.a:0 ""I see a fated successor of Zondata before me.""
aestloniaamza.20.b:0 ""The crown of Manza is yours by the ancient right of war.""
aestloniaamza.21.t:0 "Small Region, Big Trouble"
aestloniaamza.21.d:0 "The land of Mozzi was but a squiggly inky blob on the maps of the Great Lakes. Amza had not given it any special attention in days prior, and neither was she going to. However, all of its twenty-odd tiny kingdoms proved to be a persistent nuisance by presenting a united front against pacification efforts and inflicting notable casualties on the dispatched forces. In order to prevail over these creatures and establish full control over their paltry territory a strategic pivot was required.\n\nSowing disunity and turning them against each other with promises and gifts could quickly disrupt their resistance and make sweeping up the survivors relatively easy. Alternatively, Amza could add another two dozen crowns to her collection and proclaim herself the legitimate ruler of the tribes, doubling down on the suppression and shooting them until they submit to her. The choice, as always, was hers."
aestloniaamza.21.a:0 "Hardy little zebras, aren't they?"
aestloniaamza.22.t:0 "Matters Of The Zone"
aestloniaamza.22.d:0 "In her endeavors to create the perfect socialist system Amza was not blind to the usefulness of the foreign expertise. With Klugetown under her control, she decided to turn it into a so-called Cosmopolitan Zone, a gateway for comrades from all over the world into her great nation. While the pre-existing air infrastructure and shipping facilities guaranteed that the arrivals could get there, the place still needed a proper overseer, one who would show them the light and stem their flow into the right direction.\n\nVerko, a former crime boss in the area, worse, a capitalist, was still a candidate to consider: everyone could be re-educated, and his knowledge as well as prior experience with organizing indentured laborers. However, this creature might not be deserving of such an honor, while Zia needed to broaden her horizons and also brighten up a little."
aestloniaamza.22.a:0 "Verko will serve us fine."
aestloniaamza.22.b:0 "A sisterly touch is preferable."
aestloniaamza.23.t:0 "Her Confusion"
aestloniaamza.23.d:0 "Although Amza had read and re-read the pile of reports several times, the words remained utterly meaningless. No, the truth was even worse, as they painted a terrible picture. Her system was not loved, or liked, or even graciously accepted, as her subjects generally found slavery abhorrent, inefficient, or otherwise repulsive for a thousand different reasons.\n\nThere was only one possible explanation: these "free creatures" lacked vision and perspective. Amza herself was a slave, after all, and the experience only brought her closer towards the ultimate truth. Still, this meant that another adjustment in the approach was in order, but this piece of grand puzzle kept eluding her. As she paced across her chambers, a thought arose suddenly: why would fear mean anything bad? A great deal of respect could be built upon this foundation, and using it as a tool was very much familiar. No one would dare to defy the dreaded Sofa - the time of being nice had passed."
aestloniaamza.23.a:0 "They shall fall in line."
aestloniaamza.24.t:0 "Demand From The South"
aestloniaamza.24.d:0 "Our military efforts in Zebrica have recently suffered a major blow as we lost control over the territory of former Abyssinia. However, an offer comes from across the frontline - cede those lands permanently in exchange for a ceasefire. Perhaps this is the chance we need?"
aestloniaamza.24.a:0 "No negotiations with the enemy."
aestloniaamza.24.b:0 "We shall accept, but not forgive."
aestloniaamza.25.t:0 "Talks Fall Through"
aestloniaamza.25.d:0 "The ignorance of our enemies knows no bounds. Despite the fact that their chances to dislodge us from the northern territories look slim at best, they have rejected the generous peace proposal. It seems our stronger arguments will have to reach across the waters just as the words did."
aestloniaamza.25.a:0 "They will not know what hit them."
aestloniaamza.26.t:0 "Traitors Of Kin"
aestloniaamza.26.d:0 "Zwahile. A land stuck between a rock and a hard place, inevitably shaped by the influences of its Yeti neighbors and thus one which experienced a cultural and historical path full of nuance and complexity?\n\nPure nonsense, Amza would say. There was nothing complicated about the matter: the Uzerasis, locals who never joined the superior Mazwi system, were fools who prostrated themselves before the Yetis at the first opportune moment. These zebras were not only corrupted, but they wilfully embraced their sinful ways, and every document uncovered in the newly conquered territory served to strengthen Amza's belief and fuel her anger. Whatever the actual truth was, she had her own, and thus a purification was in order, one which would cleanse the mistakes of the past and lingering traces of moral weakness with blood - each dead creature shall serve as a remainder for the rest."
aestloniaamza.26.a:0 ""Uzerasi" shall hence mean "two-muzzled coward"."
aestloniaamza.27.t:0 "Bump On The Road"
aestloniaamza.27.d:0 "Zoya usually enjoyed a good patrol. She learned to find a certain beauty in the familiar path, and any danger rustling in the forest ceased to be scary with a rifle on her back. Today, the mission was a bit more complicated: deliver captives to the redistribution camp. Moving them on a vehicle would be quicker, but forcing the Yetis to march barefoot along zebras was considered an excellent show of superiority. Of course, the moans detracted from the picturesque experience, but her comrades made a quick job of stimulating any stragglers.\n\nA noise coming from the undergrowth caused the group to stop. The stallion in the lead lazily motioned for the two nearest warriors to check it out, but as soon as they came closer to the officer, a small object dropped right at their hooves.\n\n"GRENA..." someone screamed, right before the words drowned in an explosion. A small striped equine with black-and-red mane appeared moments later as if out of thin air, picking off the stunned soldiers with a handgun. Together with a couple of squadmates, Zorya finally shook the surprise off and returned fire. Although it did not take long to bring the mad ambusher down, they managed to take another couple of souls with them.\n\nAs the shock passed and smoke cleared, two realizations formed: this was a lone actor, and if they risked chucking the explosive closer to the slaves, their ambush could have been successful."
aestloniaamza.27.a:0 ""One less fur lover", Zoya thought bitterly."
aestloniaamza.28.t:0 "It Is Time"
aestloniaamza.28.d:0 "On the rare days brightened with good mood and good news, Amza found herself hankering after a casual conversation. Thus, as she stood on the balcony of the ancient imperial palace, restored to match the glory of its mistress, she had one of the domestic thralls summoned to keep her company. A young zebra stallion joined her shortly, with his head bowed, robes almost pristine and fear carefully veiled by servility. "At your pleasure, oh great one."\n\n"Just when I was starting to wonder if a lesson in speed is in order." Amza chuckled, reveling in the power to crumble his meager hold over emotions. "Tsk, tsk. Tell me, slave - have you been allowed to the city lately?"\n\n"No, oh great one." As she came closer, he shivered.\n\n"Perfect, exactly what I needed." Reaching out, Amza jerked his head up. "See the horizon, little one? The beautiful rising sun? Good. Now, there is something special underneath its lovely light today. Right here." She pushed down, setting his gaze on the central square. There, a brigade of workers was finishing unveiling a giant statue of a zebra striking a triumphant pose, with one hoof atop a yeti skull. The gold of the monument sparkled brightly and myriads of gems adorning it, primarily rubies, could almost match the shining of stars.\n\n"When I saved the city, I humbly accepted a tiny commemoration." The mare, whose bedazzling likeness towered over the tiny dark figures, grinned. "But now I am the glorious avenger, the storm tamer, the eternal victor. The old one was melted into the cap for the new one. This suits me much better." Pushing her unfortunate companion to the marble railing, she growled an order."
aestloniaamza.28.a:0 ""Now, praise it until I tell you to stop.""
aestloniaamza.29.t:0 "Greatest Tool"
aestloniaamza.29.d:0 "Although a naive creature could consider her successes to be a guarantee of loyalty from her followers, Amza was under no such delusions. As long as the equality among her zebras was not total, as long as there existed creatures who were allowed to use violence and command others, the dissent was inevitable. The military was the natural source of such threats, and as she needed the army for newly-planned conquests, the ranks required swift culling, inspired by lesser communist regimes. Anyone lacking in devotion would be struck down, regardless of past merits, and those who remained would learn to obey blindly."
aestloniaamza.29.a:0 "No half-measures in matters of state."
aestloniaamza.30.t:0 "To Live A Simple Life"
aestloniaamza.30.d:0 "The orders coming directly from the high up were clear: anything classified as "luxury" had to go. Marching towards the assigned settlement along with her fellow soldiers, Zoya was confident that there would be no resistance, as anyone foolish enough to stand against the system would make themselves known during the previous steps of the great liberation.\n\nHer belief was proven to be absolutely correct. The zebras forced outside simply bowed before the enforcers in silence, allowing them to ransack through the homes unopposed, while some even volunteered to sort the findings into salvage and waste. Growing rapidly, the piles of profane riches, that is, anything above bare essentials, stood almost as tall as some of the surrounding buildings.\n\nAs she was coming down for a final sweep, Zoya caught a glimpse of herself in a broken mirror with a neatly carved wooden frame, no doubt a prized possession of a local family. There was something wrong with her appearance. During all the searching, her neatly tied mane loosened, revealing a tiny string of colorful beads woven into an inner strand of hair, a traditional gift from her younger brother for her sixteenth nameday, a memento forbidden by the new law. She pondered only for a moment, subject to the same dreadful acquiescence."
aestloniaamza.30.a:0 "Another piece for the pyre of perfection."
aestloniaamza.31.t:0 "Peace"
aestloniaamza.31.d:0 "A walk through the streets of the capital quickly became an important part of Amza's daily routine. Back when she had to organize a full blown escort for anything outside of the palace, this would be a huge hassle, but now a few loyal zebras was all it took to maintain security. Indeed, she squeezed out any potential defiance of the common creature drop by drop, and the rare few not absorbed in their hard, hard work hurried to give way and prostrate themselves before their leader. To observe this machine of blood and bone wrought by her own hooves felt wonderfully serene, even inspiring, for there were final touches to add."
aestloniaamza.31.a:0 "More to break, more to build."
aestloniaamza.32.t:0 "Safety"
aestloniaamza.32.d:0 "Once, Amza ruled over a freshly conquered land surrounded by many enemies eager to destroy this newest iteration of Mazwi state. Some of the reactionaries demonstrated their true colors immediately, while others bid their time and hoped to strike at her weakest. Step-by-step the menace of the former was dismantled, and the rare remnants of the latter could pose no threat to the resurgent nation - truly, what could measure up to the might of the regime she molded? With the revolution protected from the outside evils, Amza could focus on her internal plans, for true communism awaited in the future."
aestloniaamza.32.a:0 "More to start, more to finish."
aestloniaamza.33.t:0 "Lines On Paper"
aestloniaamza.33.d:0 "For the tasks which required great focus, Amza ordered everything unnecessary to be taken away from her study. The latest of her objectives was treated in the same way, and now she stood over the single remaining table, or, more specifically, over a large map of territories under her control. This control required reinforcement and local adjustments, so she intended to grace the lands with a chain of visits forming a great tour. Now, she only needed to decide on the route, and with brave, broad strokes little arrows began to cover the sheet.\n\nNonetheless, as the hours passed, Amza did not reach anything resembling a satisfactory conclusion. All the important locations were obnoxiously scattered around, interspersed with natural obstacles and empty stretches of no real significance. Her frustration was so high that the treacherous thought of asking for assistance came close to forming, but a stroke of luck and genius in equal parts neutralized it just in time.\n\nPressing her pencil too hard, Amza accidentally tore through the map. Suddenly, everything fell into place, and the useless thing was ripped into small pieces. She did not need a rigorous itinerary, this crutch for the weak-minded. She would simply go wherever she pleases, and everyone else, from overseers to security, will have to adapt."
aestloniaamza.33.a:0 "A glorious idea for the glorious zebra."
aestloniaamza.34.t:0 "The Return"
aestloniaamza.34.d:0 "There was something uncomfortable for Amza about coming to Macigena, even as a victorious liberator. Her birthplace was a stronghold of inane zealotry, with its inhabitants always ready to follow the supposed will of some higher beings and never in touch with reality. Back when she served the Mazwi, some of her fellow slaves from the region kept up the worship, but she quickly found their dependence on these mysteries to be a weakness, just a crutch for mind and will.\n\nAt first, her instinct was to give a straightforward order: all the temples were to be demolished and their so-called relics destroyed or repurposed. However, Amza kept pondering. Perhaps, there was a deeper reason why she was drawn to this land, and maybe just as with the idols she was going to melt down, the faith could be reforged into another gear of her great state machine. Moreover, one very special creature down here in Zebrica did wield a true god-like power..."
aestloniaamza.34.a:0 "Azha Berahino was summoned to heed her wish."
aestloniaamza.35.t:0 "Only Her"
aestloniaamza.35.d:0 ""Witness, children! Witness the beginning of the new Mareshi!" The zebra preacher in crimson robes moved her hoof in a sweeping gesture, and thousands of eyes obediently followed, drawn to her words and the surrounding opulence. "You are standing in the place of true wonder, a temple of revolution and liberation! Forget the ways of old, when charlatans left your souls to roam without reason and rhyme, when the grand shrines served only the needs of the few."\n\nAs her words fell on the crowd, Azha nodded to the servants positioned along the walls of the chamber hosting her flock. At once, they pulled down the beautiful silk covers, revealing even richer monumental carvings representing the deeds of Amza Outtara, the undisputed ruler of the lands. A collective awe-struck gasp followed.\n\n"Where once were symbols of worthless belief, you shall now find tribute to the only one deserving. No god but she can give you sustenance and safety, as no other god walks this land! But our mistress brings us another gift, unmatched in its value. She gives our lives worth, for now we are a part of her plan! All are bound together with the greatest purpose!"\n\nOf course, the gathered creatures, the newest inhabitants of the former Macigena’s capital hardly knew any better for they were brought in from the poorest parts of the lands where Amza’s system could be seen as quantitative improvement. While Azha understood it perfectly, she saw it only as another proof of her righteousness: for sure, only the real divinity could take hold in the soul of the unenlightened. She raised her voice to chant, and the gathering fervently joined."

aestloniaamza.36.t:0 "Matters Of Sand"
aestloniaamza.36.d:0 "Once, Alwani was the name of a powerful kingdom controlling the lands of modern Timbucktu and the Central Zebrican Empire. Of course, if there had been any true merit in their rule, there would be no need for "once". Nothing but a tiny splinter remained after the Mazwi forced them to bow and beg, an inhospitable sun-scorched desert boasting a population of a dozen nomadic clans and containing exactly zilch useful resources. Scattering these pathetic creatures was trivial, but maintaining a hold over the region seemed hardly worth it: after a brief visit Amza even considered allying one of the local tribes as the most convenient solution as opposed to properly hunting them down. In any case, this "domain of last Alwanis" failed to meet the most meager expectations, and she was eager to move on, dreaming of days past."

aestloniaamza.37.d:0 "The irony of Zar-Hay's struggles was not lost on Amza. Their country was knocked down at the height of the power by Mazwi before, and now she did exactly the same with the successor state, dashing their dreams of rebirth and revenge. Leading the military parade across the city of Zao, she could not help but feel pride in her achievement, finding unexpected comfort in this historic connection to those who laid the deep foundation of her system. The town itself hardly satisfied her grand vision, as it would be some time before all traces of Zughe dynasty were properly cleansed, be it in their architectural legacy, cultural influence, or actual members. On the other hoof, the option of claiming their crown as one final humiliation was rather attractive, and Amza felt that she deserved to treat herself with good old spite."

aestloniaamza.38.d:0 "What could be more terrible than the poison of republicanism? Although this flawed system served her in the past, Amza never believed it to have any real merits. When she initially found out that Aoranda welcomed this disease, this framework so unbelievably prone to exploitation, to the Great Lakes, she was equally furious and perplexed. How could the ones in power not realize that it was nothing more than a disaster waiting to happen? Fortunately, the unnatural designs this "democracy" could have spawned were not meant to be, as the superiority of the Mazwi was firmly established across the region under Amza’s watchful gaze. Everything was exactly as it was meant to be now, and while touring the land she could not help but feel vindicated, observing creatures working not for themselves, but for the greater purpose."

aestloniaamza.39.t:0 "Power Of Words"
aestloniaamza.39.d:0 "Despite her usual amusements being readily available throughout the journey, there had been only a few places Amza truly felt as joyful as now. With no escort around, sitting behind a simple desk on a simple chair, she was fully engrossed in a plain, unadorned tome. It was a tale of a zebra explorer traversing his own continent and the ones beyond the seas, written in witty verse and filled with exciting adventures. More books on all manner of subjects could be found in a pile on the table to her right. Just as a child surrounded by desserts, she tried most of them, and could not stop switching from one to another.\n\nA knock on the door pulled her back into reality, one where she was not on shores of white sand, but in Timbucktu, a grand city with a formidable university. Alas, she was not in here for fun, as its vast library was meant to be only a momentary distraction while her forces swept the place for any signs of subversive activities. The young soldier who entered the reading room after her belated response saluted and bowed deeply.\n\n"Mistress, we are done. The demolition crews are ready to end this den of luxury."\n\n"I see, I see. Your name, sergeant - Zoya, is it not?" Amza smiled at the mare who nodded and bowed again. "Tell me, Zoya, can you read?"\n\n"No, mistress. At least not well enough." The personal question greatly flustered her. "I am sorry."\n\n"Shame. We will need to do something about it." With a dry chuckle, Amza assumed a thoughtful expression. "I need to ponder the fate of this place further. Perhaps it needs a subtler nudge. And summon servants - there is cargo I desire to take with me."\n\nZoya knew better than to ask any questions."

The head of the ruling Zefuwa dynasty and the bearer of the kingly title of Mai was known as Gounama, and although his power was significantly diminished compared to the period of independent Gelon-Zormu, he was a creature of potential.\n\n"I would like you to know that I am quite pleased with your approach to the questions of work and hierarchy. In the past there was hardly a nation more respected by the Mazwi than the one of your forefathers." Amza nodded thoughtfully. "You made them proud by standing for the tradition."\n\n"Your words are sweet as honey and soothing as a balm, mistress Outtara." Gesturing to the servant to pour more wine, the stallion bowed slightly. "I am certain there is much more I will be able to do with an ally so formidable as yourself."\n\n"There is no doubt in my mind that you are right." As she saluted with the gilded cup, the true queen carefully positioned it to hide her smirk. Anyone could perform great acts with her help.

Through the chains uniting the resurgent Mazwi state the words of its leader reverberated with her eternal wisdom.\n\n"My children! No longer shall you endure the curse of false freedom! As I stand at the birthplace of the wretched Gulu Tablet Convention, I strike down the reactionary laws imposed by the enemies of socialism. This creation of weak Ugabi, the other clauses and acts of blind warlords, the rotten customs enshrining this so-called liberty, will never poison our glorious nation of workers again. Know that the ultimate revolutionary practice of purposeful labor is now codified into every aspect of laws of the land, and celebrate this triumph in the most natural manner: pour your efforts into the assigned duties. All of you are slaves, all of you are masters, we are all united! The victory secured with this act will shine bright for ages!"\n\nBy radio, in official pamphlets distributed for all who could read or even with the help of messengers and criers, Amza's speech reached every corner of her realm and touched every soul under her red banner."

Betrayed by their elders, with Queen Bamina especially guilty of this sinful deception, they have lost their place in life. Luckily, the salvation had arrived, and the benevolence of their new mistress was plentiful. By her decree a new branch of government was to be created, devoted to reevaluation of properly docile slaves and reintegration of those few truly lost, that is the ones who resisted. From tracking and capturing to keeping up the order and productivity, its goal was of paramount importance, and its personnel would benefit from exclusive training by the foremost expert on the subject."

Devious conservative ruse aimed at deceiving the common creature, uncovered by our great leader Amza Outtara (see also Griffonian Republican False Revolution)."\n\n"Prywhen: unlawful, unorganized nation of banditry and corruption, disgracefully using communism as a smokescreen. Insidious agent of chaos, manipulated by the capitalist elements (see also South Griffonian Famine)."\n\n"Communism: ultimate political system of universal labor. The only fully operational model was established by our great leader Amza Outtara, whose efforts ensured the perfect amalgamation of the state and its workers. While some outsiders claim primacy in this matter, their meager accomplishments could not measure up to her visionary capability or leave a meaningful legacy."\n\nAlong with many others, these bits of the new truth, dictated by the mistress and dutifully recorded by her personal scribes, formed the conclusive political treatise of Mazwi state. She did not need to act anymore - Amza’s words, distributed for every creature to learn and worship, defined reality on their own, endowed with unimaginable, magnificent, terrible power. "

aestloniaamza.44.d:0 "Although the machine she created was undeniably glorious, Amza desired to add a few upgrades. After all, her brilliant mind contained many more ideas, and those could be only beneficial, especially with the successes of the previous ones. The key subject of today’s musings was the strengthening of control, and the right ingredient immediately sprang to mind. Food served as a foundation of any work, which meant that harshly tightening the quotas should lead to a more useful and docile population, especially if the increase in daily rations would be tied to productivity and the bloody rebels would be physically cut off from provisions. As a bonus, no simple overseer could risk mismanaging food for the fear of punishment when their inevitable tenure as a slave came.\n\nOn the subject of the future, another topic was very important to Amza, namely the management of youth. Even though the general course of ideologically charged upbringing was a foregone conclusion, she would prefer to iron out some details. There was a case to be made about inserting them into the labor force as soon as possible, however an alternative was brought up by Azha Berahino. The foals could become the eyes and ears of the regime, learning to trust the system before their own blood, report any signs of corruption, and the most promising ones could be even uplifted to the inner circle.

Safer to steal a piece of a ration than to graze in the open, too many witnesses, too obvious. Grass is for special foraging only, forbidden by law. Illegal hoarding is punished just as severely, but now she does not care. Hunger overwhelms caution.\n\nA pot of water bubbles on a rusty stove and the empty stomach rumbles. Brown goes in first, then yellow, and finally, when the faint smell of cooking causes thoughts to gallop, some green, fresh herbs picked from the hidden patch of dirt wedged between the house and the fence. She eats greedily, slurping, burning her mouth with this so-called soup. This has been the last food. She has to push on. Another day in the mine could be the big break. Must be the big break. The satchel goes back into the stash, but not before the crumbs are licked clean and the pot is scrubbed for the slightest trace of sustenance. Still hungry. Still tired. Too tired."

aestloniaamza.46.d:0 "A plate stood before Amza and she eyed the meal on it with a hint of trepidation. She would have to concede that it was a creation of an amateur cook. Yet, there was a reason why this dish deserved a place on her table, as the aspiring chef was no one else but herself. It was a long-standing yearning of hers to learn this craft, and now, with more free time and access to the best ingredients she finally got down to it. Some could say that steak, especially such a lean cut, was hardly a beginner’s choice, but it was exactly what her heart desired. The mare raised her knife and fork with determination.\n\nThe meat was tough and chewy, clearly overcooked and maybe underseasoned. On the contrary, the greens on the side were rather raw. Still, she finished everything without flinching. Amza was a quick study with a penchant for learning by doing, so the next time would be better. She just needed to send a word to her loyal "sous-chefs" for another package."

For Amza it was an undeniable sign of her power, and the methods employed to bring thousands of zebras and other creatures here, from promises of gifts to coercion to outright violence, were nothing but examples of her firm grip on the minds. She raised her hoof, and a complete silence settled down in a matter of seconds, as if everything below the gilded podium froze solid.\n\n"My workers." She started her speech in a gentle, almost motherly tone. "You have been burdened so terribly and so painfully throughout your lives, and you suffer still. We will not stand for it any longer. The name of the reprehensible curse cast on you? Oh, you know it well. It is called "choice". From this day, the state will be your guide in matters big and small. Forget the trouble of not knowing what tomorrow shall bring: your duty shall be assigned, your children will be sorted in a most suitable manner and you would have nothing else but the holy labor to worry about. The retrograded nations have their disconnected elites and intellectuals, who drown this purpose in pointless meandering. We do not need this. We have outgrown this. You are to become the first in the world who are truly free!"\n\nAmza swiftly moved her leg, indicating the moment for reaction."

aestloniaamza.48.d:0 "The most important day in her life had come for Zebeka. Ever since she was put in her school, she had one dream: to see the great mistress. She worked hard, she learned all her historic speeches, she even received an official commendation for vigilance from the district political officers, and now she had her coveted reward, a seat on the third row during the special address.\n\nAmza Outtara, blessed be the name of the great liberator, appeared before her youthful audience suddenly, as the curtain of black silk fell down, revealing the single zebra standing against the crimson background. To Zebeka she appeared as a beautiful herald of the dawning sun, and she gasped reverently just as all of the other comrades.\n\n"Today you are in the presence of not only your dear aunt, little ones. True as it is, you should never forget my presense." Amza stepped forward, chuckling. "You are the future, which means that you must understand your glorious role perfectly. Look around you."\n\nHundreds of heads obediently followed. Zebeka's eyes met the gaze of a colt her age, mirroring the same awe tinted by confusion.\n\n"See? This is what matters. Not you, as a single entity, but you as a class, a living organism, a stream of blood in the veins of the state. And a droplet shall do the bidding of the heart - carry vitality, cycle through the organs or indeed be spilled. The individual means nothing. The welfare of all, the greater good, that is our purpose. Remember my words."\n\nThe feeling of unity surged through Zebeka as she nodded with fervor. She meant nothing. Everything made sense.

aestloniaamza.49.d:0 "Life at the frontier of the Mazwi state was, frankly, terrible, and Ezzet was not a zebra to argue otherwise. One thing made it bearable: neighbors banding together to withstand the government pressure and help each other out. Old rivalries were forgotten, and even an accidental resettled newcomer found themselves cared for. However, everything seemed to be turning for the worse over the last month, as whispers of traitors splintered the community. Ezzet did his best to stay out of hoof-pointing, but only got shunned for his troubles.\n\nWhile taking a break from his cart-pulling shift, the stallion spotted a younger mare struggling to take the arriving boxes off the cargo ramp. Being a stubborn creature, he hurried to her aid, wordlessly and selflessly. The work was tiring, but doable, and soon both sat down next to the neatly stacked crates.\n\n"Say, aren't you Ezzet?" The stranger's question was more than idle curiosity.\n\n"Sure am. Since I don't know you, you're new. Since you know me, someone must have already given you a tour."\n\n"Right. Charming place. I owe you one - name's Keza, by the way." She smiled faintly. "Honestly, I'm only asking because there was this fellow, Grazel, I think, who gave the guards your name and spitting-image description, all tied up with the accusation of stealing and underperforming. Got a pat on the back and half-day off."\n\nGrazel. The expression on Ezzet's face soured as soon as he heard the name. He went from a meddlesome neighbor, to an unexpected ally, and now, it seemed, to a snake. "What a joke. Steer clear of him, you hear? Less and less decent folk by the day."\n\n"Sounds like you could give me some pointers then." Keza nodded thoughtfully."

There had been a time she held council in a building ruined by an artillery barrage. Now, however, poverty, stupidity and adversity lay before her as conquered foes, and she was celebrating victory in the life-long struggle. In a palace befitting a godly queen, in a city of thousands souls burning as one, in the nation she chiselled with blood, sweat and toil, Amza penned her final grand act. The dictatorship of the proletariat was upon the Mazwi state, and this law would abolish classes, making every creature a worker. If not for all reforms she tied to the term, if a lesser leader tried it, this would be senseless symbolism, but in these lands its significance could not be overstated.\n\nA dot of red ink marked the final sentence. Amza skimmed over the draft, satisfied, reclined on her leather chair and slipped into daydreaming about her lands. This creation would last an epoch and make impact far greater than her own, she did not doubt that for a second."

It was already suspected that Alter had connections to the cult, and those suspections were correct, the only reason she ran on the election was with cultist support and resources, this support being given under the condition she would pardon Storm and would allow her to take over as the true leader of Aestlonia. This being done by appointing Storm as vice-president and then stepping down. But Alter now wonders, should she bother? Storm is in prison and the cult is the weakest it has ever been, she could very well just stick around, she was democratically elected President after all, nobody can remove her from here."

Her choices are few, either choose Vastik or Snowstorm, neither are really of her preference, but if this scenario comes true she won't be around to complain anyway.

This is the first time in all of Aestlonian history that the cult has been in charge, and that seems like enough of an excuse to do this, both to cheer and to gloat, but in Storm's monotone way. As Storm is giving her speech a certain blonde pegasus mare makes her way within the crowd, and before anyone can react Golden Sayif shoots towards Storm, it seems as soon as the bullet was out of her pistol Sayif had already been "pacified" by one of the cult's unicorns, but the bullet still got out."

But now that he has some time alone to think his mood shifts as he quickly realizes that running a country is a little different than being in-charge of some cultist division. In truth he has no idea when it comes to doing the more mundane stuff that comes with the job, he certainly will need to look for some help before someone else comes around to ruin his plans. Well, he was always a big fan of the Arabian monarchy and the entire system as a whole, perhaps he could just put Zaida back on the throne and let her deal with the mess that is this nation, and in the meanwhile he could focus on looking cool or something.

Zaida is tempted to accept, mostly not wanting or trusting Vastik to rule by himself, that and she was quick to notice how unstable the nation was ever since the cultists came to power, but in the end she refuses the offer, noting that she was removed from power in the first place because she was a bit to close with the cultists and the more nasty side of herself, and that she simply has no wishes of imposing her rule over a population that does not want her, if it is for her to come back she wants it to be in an organical way, not because some brutish cultist said so. In other words she's just worried about the optics of having her title restored by someone like him, that and it is no secret that Zaida is not big into the Arabian side of Aestlonia. Vastik is left surprised that someone like her would turn down the offer, it even causes him to respect the ex-princess slightly more, but now he needs to look for a new potential monarch."

Vastik was forced to get a bit creative, he had heard of this pony in the army that certainly looked the part for an Arabian monarch, they even had some Arabian blood in them! Sure, they weren't actually from any particular noble family, not even from an influential one, but the people didn't need to know. Vastik would call up the pony for a meeting, this pony being Surilina Khalsa, he even made sure the meeting was in the throne room in the hopes of tempting them to accept. Like Zaida and many other ex-nobles, Khalsa had that expression on their face like they were ready to deny, Vastik for his part was ready to throw a fit about having his offer refused yet again, but to his surprised the pony ends up begrudgingly accepting. Surilina does it mostly because they know what a cultist such as Vastik is capable of if left unchecked, so if they can at least try to prevent any malicious acts the offer suddenly becomes somewhat of a good idea, if not for themselves then at least for the comfort of the people. That and Aestlonia just needs some stability at this point. Vastik is obviously quite happy about it."

The stallion before him looked like he hadn't bathed once in his whole life, and he certainly didn't smell much better either, and that is without even mentioning his missing tooth and brutish scars, and by Watraz, what was he even wearing? Did he get out of a cheap school play about pirates and forgot to change? If this had been a normal day Lapis would have kicked this insolent fool out of his humble abode, perhaps even throw a vase at his head on his way out for good measure, but this wasn't a normal day, well, these past months certainly weren't all that normal either. To tell the truth Lapis saw some value on Vastik's offer, even if the Prince saw himself as a selfless pony he couldn't help but want some power for himself, a cushy job did sound quite nice, and who knows? Maybe he could coax this beast into a more proper pony if he were to accept becoming his unofficial advisor for Arabian matters. And who would Lapis be if he allowed this ruffian to sully the image of the great Arabians? It is simply his duty and obligation to put that stallion in his place."

Here Lapis expresses concern over Vastik's past, not because of any particular moral reason, but instead that it will greatly damage his ability to gain legitimacy in the eyes of the Hestrayans, and later, the Arabians, specially the royalty which Vastik seems to like so much. Lapis suggests that Vastik lets go of this dastardly cult as soon as he has the chance if he even wants the slight possibility of being respected by the horses up north in the future."

Upon arriving at the royal palace he notices that the place looks quite different from when he last saw it, instead of the usual posh pimpage he saw many crates and several "uncouth" ponies making their way in and out of the building. At first he thought Surilina may have gone the way of Faisal, who knows, perhaps it was the destiny of every modern Arabian monarch to become a hedonist, but before he could continue that line of thought he was interrupted by said monarch. After a brief greeting the monarch notes that they simply didn't feel comfortable living in such luxury as ponies outside had to live in their tiny cold homes, if they had homes at that, therefore she decided to donate the palace to a local small business so they could offer some extra employment for the area. Not only that but the old royal and visitor quarters were turned into rooms where vulnerable ponies, be they homeless or simply poor, could stay for as long as wanted, completely free of charge too. Vastik isn't completely sure how to react, it's not like he ever cared for luxury anyway, but it was still quite the abrupt and senseless decision by Surilina's part. Oh well, at least it doesn't harm him in any way, if Surilina doesn't want a whole free palace for themselves then so be it."

Meanwhile coffee is seen as an outsider thing that was introduced by Vastik in recent times, leading some Aestlonians to grow a bit bitter over the drink itself, as they see it as a form of cultural imperialism. This led to what happens in this event, where a small-scale fight broke out in a shop due to the drink choices of the ponies involved, with the tea drinkers attacking the coffee drinkers with "punches" and shoves. The coffee-drinking ponies were quick to respond with a similar level of violence. The scene had to be broken apart by the police."

That much was normal, the "ex" cultist had been making many visits to his residence ever since their uneasy alliance had been formed, but what Lapis wasn't ready for was to find Vastik wearing a suit, like a proper suit that a proper civilized pony would wear. Sure, he wore it horribly, it was like a colt trying on his dad's suit, but still, he hadn't expected such... Decorum? From a pony like that. After a few seconds of Lapis staring in silence Vastik would begin talking, saying that he wished to adopt a more noble look for his rule over Aestlonia so the people will give him an easier time as per Lapis' instructions. Lapis smiles in response and tells him that it was indeed a good idea and that he is happy that Vastik is taking this seriously, but he won't allow Vastik to leave until he lets the Prince do some quick adjustments to that messy suit of his."

Vastik's home was cozier than expected, it was a proper cabin with a nice roaring fireplace and some tasteful (even if few) decorations. Right now the Prince was just waiting sat at the sofa as Vastik prepared himself for something, he had simply told Lapis to wait as he was still "finishing something up" and then proceeded to lock himself inside his own bedroom. Thankfully the wait wasn't very long, the cultist would come to properly greet Lapis this time, the Prince was quick to note the fact that Vastik was wearing some reading glasses, the cultist nods and says that he would like to read a poem he wrote. Lapis is surprised the cultist can even write or read, let alone write a poem, he only becomes more surprised as the poem is of acceptable quality."

Vastik himself had no great difficulty in making friends with the locals even if his somewhat brutish and crude ways got in the way at times.

Doing something no one present expected Vastik took out a combat knife from beneath his coat and proceeded to cut the ropes of each one of those that had been captured. Sadly for the captured this is when the good times ended as Vastik grabbed the gun of a nearby guard, also getting an extra one to give to Lapis, he then proceeds to count down from ten without further explanation, but it is enough of a "clue" about what is about to happen as the captured proceed to run away. After the countdown Lapis asks what Vastik thinks he's doing, saying that he refuses to take part in this heartless "hunt" as he discards his weapon. Vastik simply rolls his eyes and says something to the effect of "suit yourself", but does say that the Prince is forced to accompany him if he wishes to keep his job. The Prince, seeing no way out of this, ends up silently accepting. The expression of disgust and grief on the Prince's face during the hunt gives Vastik some sick enjoyment, it was a clear message to Lapis that Vastik wasn't his to "fix" or mold, no matter how hard he may try.

Vastik quickly responds that he doesn't see death in battle/conflict as a bad thing, instead he sees it as a great prize, a truly brave and dignified way out of life, one that doesn't involve slowly fading away until your body eventually fails, he concludes that what he gave these people was a chance at a glorious death, and that he wishes that something similar will happen to him when it's his time to go.

Lapis is also present but he mostly remains quiet as Surilina says much of what he wanted to say to the cultist. It's quite rare to see Surilina in such a clearly altered state like this, so much so that Vastik cuts them off before they end up jumping him. The cultist points out that the agreement he made with Surilina allows him to do whatever he wants to Hestraya until the eventual migration to Arabia, therefore, if Surilina wants to keep their current and future positions they should keep their head down. The "monarch" is clearly not happy with this arrangement, but at the same time they don't find a way to really refute Vastik's point, they'll simply have to learn to live with it."

aestloniavastik.15.d:0 "##TODO, event where Lapis talks about Arabian faith with Vastik, saying that it would be a somewhat easy way to gain legitimacy even before reaching the Arabian peninsula. Lapis points out that faith in Arabia normally doesn't play a part in government, and stuff like holy wars don't really happen at all, therefore it is not necessary that Vastik be a firm believer of any faith/sect, instead just some loose posturing should be enough. Lapis further delves into explaining the faith, pointing out that the main Arabian faith is a duelist one that worships the gods Watraz and Aitraz, and around these gods there are separate sects based on which one you wish to mainly worship/follow. Aitraz is heavily associated with the Sun and the followers of the sect are mostly known for their belief in strenght and diligence. Meanwhile those who lean more towards Watraz, who's associated with the Moon, are more known for their patience and endurace. Lapis notes that the split in followers is nearly 50/50 and animosity between the sects isn't that high, therefore Vastik is free to pick the one he prefers. Lapis does also mention that the house of Saddle did believe in Watrazism, seeing that Vastik might find that information useful."

aestloniavastik.16.d:0 "##TODO, choosing Watrazism was a logical choice, after all it was the sect that the house of Saddle followed, but this was not the only reason as for why Vastik chose it. The secondary reason was because Lapis follows the sect of Aitraz, therefore Vastik was hoping he could annoy and bully the Prince by choosing "the other one", but, sadly for the cultist, that did not happen. Instead Lapis was completely indifferent to the choice, if anything he said that Vastik had made a reasonable choice. When Vastik confronts Lapis about his faith the Prince simply responds that believing in either God doesn't contradict the existence of the other one as the faith is dualist in nature, he even points out that the sky needs both the sun and the moon to function. Vastik is left slightly defeated as his attempt at being snarky has failed."

aestloniavastik.17.d:0 "##TODO, At first Vastik had been glad that Lapis was willing to help him learn more about Aitrazism, after all the Prince was a follower of the sect, but as the royal began reading scripture after scripture and page after page of his holy texts and books Vastik couldn't help but feel bored. In truth the cultist was never into the more studious side of faiths, even back during his time in the cult he barely studied the writing concerning the Windigos, he mostly just followed the movement due to how it allowed him to be his true raw self. At one point Vastik holds a hoof up and as politely as he can asks Lapis to stop, saying that he learnt enough. Lapis doesn't buy it, but it's still happy Vastik lasted as long as he did, perhaps a true sign that the cultist is changing for the better."

The Prince is truly livid, calling Vastik all kinds of names as he insults the cultist's intelligence, saying that this "trinity" of his is nothing but pure insanity.

It would be a hard relationship to fix, but he believed it could be done if there was enough desire for peace and change. As usual he employs the help of Lapis here, who, by his part, is being very supportive of Vastik's idea, even making a joke that the stallion must have been replaced by a double when the prince wasn't looking. Even if Vastik is being benevolent his choice also stems from the fact that he believes the Arabians should lead by example, they should be above petty cultural conflicts."

Vastik plops his face down in a pile of books and sighs heavily as he is not the reader type, the prince comes over to help the cultist, offering to read the books instead.

To do this he decides to offer free housing and other trinkets in the hopes of tempting some Arabians to come over. In this event he and Lapis are welcoming some horses that have just arrived at the port, both the horses and Lapis are a little unnerved by Vastik's presence due to how much he keeps glazing the Arabians to their faces."

He says that his is for the best since Snowstorm clearly cannot be trusted with anything due to her mental instability and love for communism. Snowstorm is obviously very angry and saddened by this, going as far as calling Vastik a traitor who never deserved to received Storm's blessing when he joined the cult all those years ago.

Hopefully things will go smoothly, but if they don't he never was a stallion to turn down a hard fight.

aestloniasnowstorm.2.d:0 "##TODO, event after Snowstorm sent her first messages to outer space in the hopes of receiving some kind of response, for this objective she decided to wait by the beach at night, since in her head this was a good place and time to look for any kind of anomalies in the sky due to the lack of light pollution, together with the lack of trees and buildings to block the view. As she sat on the sand looking for anything unusual she saw some weird movement in the water in-front of her, at first it was very far away, but it quickly started approaching the shore, Snowstorm prepared herself, clearly they were here to take her in order to start some kind of diplomatic talk in their home planet, as she had once theorized."

Snowstorm wasn't sure how to react, she knew aliens would look weird and unusual, but not to this level, how could water be given life? Clearly the space leaders meant to surprise her today. The creature approached her quite casually as the cultist remained sat on the sand, it would even extend a watery hoof to her to aid her getting up, which she promptly accepted. The water spirit introduces himself as Flaming Nebula, it being apparent that they're not used to speak, which only further confirms Snowstorm's theory that they're not from this planet. The creature says that they felt some weird movements in the water, Nebula couldn't figure out what was said, but it was quite obviously not natural, so they came to investigate, he asks if Snowstorm was behind this act, which she promptly confirms her involvement. Snowstorm asks Nebula to help her in leading her realm, saying that she needs the guidance of a being like them. Nebula, as optimistic and as innocent as ever, quickly accepts the offer."

First she meets with the Lighthouse Society, they being cultists who "enlightened" themselves after being sent to guard captured lighthouses by their own, the isolation driving them into unorthodox ideas, even more than before, with the society being known for their individualistic anarchist way of thinking. Next she meets with those in her own "faction" of the Scarlet Winds, they're ponies much like her, those who believe to a fault in the windigos and in the idea that modernity is a complex web of lies waiting to be brought down by truth, some also share her interest of extra-planetary life. Finally she also meets with the Order Of The Current, they're by far the most committed to communism out of all of factions, believing the only way to achieve the ideology is by having total control over society and by ensuring that the precious lives of the citizens aren't at risk."

But the cultist ultimately decided to trust the word of these ponies. She would make her way to one of the ports of Merelinn the next day. She was expecting that the voyage would be cancelled, since it was clearly fake after all! But that was not what happened, the ship did arrive and she was boarded with no great complications. After a lenghty trip, which almost caused Snowstorm to believe she had been tricked, she would finally arrive at the destination, what she saw next shook her to her core. It was a city full of ponies, but it didn't look one bit like those back in Hestraya, the weather certainly wasn't as frigid either, she couldn't remember the last time she sweated like this, and what was this weird dialect they spoke in?.

Snowstorm would embark on one of these ships, not being as nervous as usual due to the idea of finally finding out if this place existed or not, even if it turned out to be a fluke it still would bring great comfort to her mind. After a lenghty journey she would arrive at this massive but weirdly majestic city, at a scale she never saw before, could cities really get this big? Manehattan was its name, or at least that's all she understood from the jambled mess that was coming out of the mouth of the tour guide, what a funny language. Snowstorm would sit on one of the park benches thinking of what this revelation could mean, it certainly opened a lot of future opportunities for truth-seeking, but her thoughts were interrupted when she was tossed a few golden coins by a passing pony. The act was certainly strange, maybe it's their way of showing kindness? So much to learn."

aestloniasnowstorm.8.d:0 "##TODO, to find the truth one must question even the most well-defined parts of reality, and that includes concepts such as numbers and the mathematical field as a whole. After much studying Snowstorm came to a realization, who could guarantee that only these numbers existed? Who was the one who decided on such a fact? The 1 to 9 system simply wasn't good enough, it was too simple, too obvious, too perfect, there had to be a hidden value here somewhere. After some time of going nowhere Snowstorm decided to lay some paper on the floor, afterwards she started to trace out the shape of the numbers in black paint in each individual sheet of paper, after some thinking and observing she decided there had to be a hidden number between 6 and 7, this comes from the fact she thinks the transition of the number shapes was simply too radical, therefore there has to be something in the way to explain it. But what would be the name of this secret numeral? Certainly it was lost to time at this point, but no matter, she knows exactly what name deserves to adorn this number."

Even the way the dates were laid out made the cultist think of ways to improve these systems into something more modern, and she might just have figured something out. Instead of using hypothetical units of measurement height would now be determined by how many hooves tall something was, the new system for weight was also similar, with the value now being measured in stones and/or other objects a pony could find in the everyday lives. Temperature followed suit, now using a system in which positive values would be more frequent. Finally the date system was also changed, with the month going before the day, this way the number of the day can always be at the center."

While inside Snowstorm was looking for a way to confirm her theory that the statue might have been an ancient giant who was petrified with the use of magic, only that could explain the perfect form that the statue had. But while inside she couldn't find anything to confirm her theory, she wasn't even able to find the creature's heart, maybe the Equestrians hid it behind a fake wall?

Since its inception the Path serves as a kind of communal group, one where its members are offered free supplies, such as food, water, and accommodations in exchange of serving its leader. Not only that, but being a member of the Path makes sure that your family will be protected and cared for. Due to this the group has a tendency to attract the most desperate and marginalized of society since they don't have anywhere to go, and the cult helps them where the state had failed, gives them a place and community to call theirs. As such the Path has developed into a system where the members are expected to show total loyalty towards the leader due to everything they have been giving by the cult, being one of the few conditions required to join. Therefore, the Path will be sure to carry out whatever Snowstorm wishes, not only is Snowstorm the new leader, but she also is one of the main speakers of the group in modern times, the fire that helped the group grow under Storm's stoic rulership.

In this position Nebula will be expected to run things whenever Snowstorm is incapacitated or just not present at the moment. Likewise they will be expected to make sure that Snowstorm's orders and reforms are being carried out in the national level, therefore cooperation between the kelpie and the cult is more than assured. Nebula is quick to accept this offer, being very confident and outspoken during the formal public ceremony, after all they wish to help Snowstorm in any way they can. The public seems to like them back due to the kelpie's charismatic personality and their unique elemental/ethereal look." ##Nebula has their own "cult" back in New Coltlantis, so they know how to speak to a crowd quite well.

The choice wasn't as easy as she hoped, the Lighthouse Society would provide a very extreme freeing experience to the peoples of Aestlonia, but the Scarlet Winds were way more serious about their love of the Windigos and the task to find the truth about reality, and lastly the Order Of The Current would allow Snowstorm to control society in a way no other leader had yet achieved, it would be a state like no other.

It is clear that she is in cooking up yet another conspiracy theory, even forgoing sleep to do so as she seems to have been at it since yesterday. Her theory-crafting session is interrupted when a plate slides onto the table and her field of view. She can't quite tell what exactly is on the plate, besides it being circular and flat. She looks up to see who's responsible for this dish and sees Flaming Nebula standing there with a concerned smile on their face. They say that they heard ponies need to eat very often in order to stay healthy, specially in the mornings, but that she hasn't seen Snowstorm really take part in that "ritual", therefore they took it upon themself to make something for her based on the photos from a cook book they had borrowed. As it seems neither Nebula nor Snowstorm had ever seen pancakes before, so this truly was a unique experience for both. Snowstorm says that she is not used to eat much, specially not this abundant amount of food (it's only a few pancakes), but she is willing to eat it due to the effort Nebula put into it. They're obviously pretty happy about it, but they couldn't help but wonder to themselves if maybe her lack of eating explained why Snowstorm was so comically short."

But the Kelpie does express their concern about their anti-social ways of operation, asking Snowstorm why is it necessary to make the people of this land hate each other in such a way, noting that back home even if there was no state to enforce it Kelpies still tried to help one another. Snowstorm responds by saying that it's a required step in order to make people more autonomous and less reliant on others, that way they're more likely to survive in the event of something similar to a Storm King invasion happening again. This is the only way to force people into self-improvement, as society makes them way too comfortable otherwise, she argues. Nebula doesn't totally agree, but at the same time the Kelpies did abandon both their old homeland and the ponies when the going got tough, so maybe this was truly the way to go about it. Perhaps the Kelpie system also needed that improvement, they would need to remember to bring this up to the Queen when they eventually return to New Coltlatins."

Here Flaming Benubla shows some concern about her decision, citing that in Kelpie society this type of action would be seen as insane and destructive. In responsive Snowstorm tells Nebula to calm his "alien sensitivities" and that this is just how ponies and other further assorted creatures need to be governed, she notes that the extra control over society is just to guarantee the safety and health of all the citizens of the nation, since if left alone they are sure to hurt themselves or each other.

She did let him go by the end, as a way to thank him from widening her way of thinking. She remembers that whole event quite fondly, seemingly not realizing how scared the other pony must have been."

Here we see this somewhat shy and reclusive mare getting bested by a much superior opponent, with said mare not being a figther at all, she's just a writer from the city, she's not cut out for this. But, somehow, at the apex of her humiliation she finds the strength within herself to fight back when her opponent is too busy gloating to the audience. She picks up her trusty fountain pen and jams into into the other pony's neck and "wins" the battle, this should be depicted in a way that doesn't show much of the more sordid details.

At first both just stared at each other, with the mare doing a poor job at trying to deescalate the situation as she fails to form words, she's simply too emotionally altered. Surprisingly enough Snowstorm waits for the mare to prepare herself after the latter realizes that there is no way out of this without fighting. The fight is brief, but even so the mare is able to get quite a few good blows on Snowstorm, who, in turn, is pleasantly surprised by her performance, she even got the leader to bleed. But, even so, it was obvious from the start who was going to win, Snowstorm has a lot more experience with fights and she certainly was in way more of a fighting mood than the other mare. But, in a shock to all involved, Snowstorm spares the mare after defeating her, saying that it had been ages since she had such a good fight."

He uses this timeless isolation to continue working on his so-called masterpieces, it being very hard to paint in the dark, but he managed to get used to it in his own way.

The citizens just realized what was truly important in life, that being themselves, and only themselves, so why should they bother cleaning the outside of their house?

Here we see both of them inside a dusty library as Nebula tries their best to teach the cultist how to sing properly, the results are pretty horrible, it's clear that Snowstorm wasn't meant to be an Applewood singing star, seeing this the Kelpie suggest just recording their song and playing it with the use of speakers in certain areas of the country instead.

Snowstorm can't find a single thing in the endless dunes of Azir, all she is able to accomplish is to pass out on the sand due to the heat, this not helped by the fact she did not remove her heavy fur coat. This could have very well been the end of Snowstorm if not for a zebra wanderer that had found her just before she expired.

The cultist is clearly a little confused by her presence, but Amza's face suggests that this is all part of her plan, as she belives these two will get along together quite well. And it turns out she was right, for some reason Snowstorm felt quite comfortable around Azha, it's like they both recognized each other's freak just at a first glance, possibly due to the zebra's receptiveness towards her crazy ideas or even due to sharing those of her own, what matters is that the two of them quickly lost themselves in a child-like conversation about cool things they believe on.

What matters here is even if Posada did somewhat like Nebula she certainly did not like Snowstorm and whatever she was doing back home, the meeting quickly turned from an uncomfortable encounter to a shouting match between the two, with Posada making it clear that what Snowstorm was doing wasn't socialism, communism, or even anything close to being left-like, instead it was pure madness. Of course Snowstorm doesn't take it that well. As this was happening Nebula did slip away from the meeting, being able to gather some information about what Hippogriffia was doing under Posada.

aestloniasnowstorm.52.d:0 "##TODO, Nebula had set aside a few days to self-reflect and to finally decide how they should move forward with this nation, it was a daunting thing to think about, but they finally reached a conclusion. In truth Snowstorm had done a lot of bad things, but between all these actions there was a bit of good that made it through the cracks, such as that railway she had built that helped to unite the coasts of Zebrica, or even her investments into research. Not only that but it seems she also had positively affected some creatures under her rule, like the giraffes who had expressed their condolences to Nebula hours after Snowstorm had passed due to the great autonomy she had awarded them, a similar pattern would repeat with the zebras of the Southeast, with the High Priest even coming in zebra to comfort Nebula a day ago. It was clear that Nebula needed to polish Snowstorm's ideology into something that would truly make Zebrica better, not only to help the creatures of this land but to also honor the legacy of their great friend."
aestloniasnowstorm.52.a:0 "I won't let you down."
aestloniasnowstorm.53.t:0 "The Path To Nowhere"
aestloniasnowstorm.53.d:0 "##TODO, after a few days of thinking Nebula had reached a conclusion about how they would rule this nation, and that conclusion was to keep everything exactly as Snowstorm left it in order to preserve her vision. Nebula knows that not everything she did was good for her subjects, but they simply couldn't betray their late friend like this, no, things had to remain the same, and they would make sure of that. They only hope one day the creatures of these lands might one day forgive them."
aestloniasnowstorm.53.a:0 "It's what we need to do."
aestloniasnowstorm.54.t:0 "Back To Reality"
aestloniasnowstorm.54.d:0 "##TODO, Nebula considered Snowstorm a dear friend, but even they could notice how her policies were harmful to the people she once promised to serve. Seeing this they had no other alternative but to try to dial back the most extreme parts of the ideology she had set down but still keeping the general concepts in order to respect her memory. Mostly the Kelpie got rid of anything that seemed overly esoteric or harmful, while keeping the few good points and policies around, this should hopefully be much better to the general populace. Nebula certainly is no politician but they still think they did a decent job in polishing Snowstorm's idea of what socialism and communism should be."
aestloniasnowstorm.54.a:0 "Things can only go up from here."
aestloniasnowstorm.55.t:0 "Cleaning Up The Mess"
aestloniasnowstorm.55.d:0 "##TODO, Snowstorm sure made it challenging for this nation to have friendly relations with anyone, but Nebula had done the possible to repair relations with countries that she had previously insulted, it still will take a long time to be able to proclaim that these nations are "friendly" with us, but it has to start somewhere. These past days Nebula is just going in and out of meetings with foreign leaders, so they're glad to finally have some down time, during this time they also decide to check back on the subject admnistrations that Snowstorm had set up and he notices some less than nice names, it's probably time to change those."
aestloniasnowstorm.55.a:0 "Hopefully this should be all."
aestloniasnowstorm.56.t:0 "One Last Step"
aestloniasnowstorm.56.d:0 "##TODO, Nebula was pratically done with all the reforms they envisioned for the country, but this did not mean there was nothing left to do, the Kelpie still had the book, the one that Snowstorm spent her time writing before passing. During all of the time they spent ruling the nation they couldn't stop thinking about the book and what they would do to it, obviously they couldn't allow it to decide how the government would function anymore, but it still was a hard choice for them to take, after all this was the only thing that they had left of Snowstorm. But the day finally arrived, it might have been hard, but the Kelpie finally parted ways with this book, leaving it in a very special place, that being right where the cultist had been buried, more specifically her gravestone. Nebula also used this opportunity to wish their friend one last farewell, she might have been crazy, but she still was their best friend here on the surface, and they shall miss her dearly."
aestloniasnowstorm.56.a:0 "We hope you can forgive us."
aestloniasnowstorm.57.t:0 "A Watchful Eye"
aestloniasnowstorm.57.d:0 "##TODO, Nebula knew that as soon as they announced their wishes to continue Snowstorm's plans that sooner or later foreign elements would attempt to destroy what she had built, and if not that some of the more reactionary-leaning of the populaec would start to lead people down the wrong path. To avoid this they simply had to have a way to keep an eye on the nation, first they closed the borders and later the economy to make sure nothing could go in or out, now they needed to watch over Snowstorm's subjects in her absence. Due to this Nebula has created the Revolutionary Protectors, which will be those responsible for keeping things in line."
aestloniasnowstorm.57.a:0 "Just follow her vision."
aestloniasnowstorm.58.t:0 "A Show Of Devotion"
aestloniasnowstorm.58.d:0 "##TODO, Snowstorm might be gone but that doesn't mean we can't continue her great work, with no one knowing more of this fact than Flaming Nebula themselves. The Kelpie went one step further, today they renamed the capital after the great thinker in order to show her loyalty and devotion towards the deceased figure, let it be a reminder of the great pony who once trotted amongst us."
aestloniasnowstorm.58.a:0 "Always in our hearts."
aestloniasnowstorm.59.t:0 "Unchanging, Unmoving, Unwavering"
aestloniasnowstorm.59.d:0 "##TODO, it had finally been done, despite the many temptations Nebula was able to follow Snowstorm's vision exactly as she would have wanted and done it, to the point they know she would be proud of their accomplishments. Now Nebula has a long road ahead of them, it is now their duty to diligently watch over these blessed lands and make sure that the great ideology is preserved now and forever, and they wouldn't have it any other way, they won't allow Snowstorm's legacy to die, no matter what sacrifice has to be made."
aestloniasnowstorm.59.a:0 "We will never forget you."
aestloniasnowstorm.60.t:0 "The Griffonian Desolation"
aestloniasnowstorm.60.d:0 "##TODO, Snowstorm explores Barrad and sees how everything is crazy and there's no one around and has evil weather. She then concludes that this must be the home of the Windigos, and that if they're going to be happy we have to make our lands like this too. "
aestloniasnowstorm.60.a:0 "Wow..."
aestloniasnowstorm.61.t:0 "The Lost Tribe"
aestloniasnowstorm.61.d:0 "##TODO, Snowstorm explores the Northern Tribes and they're very worried about this emaciated crazy mare talking about the blessings of the Windigos. She wanders around for a bit before meeting Princess Fiana II, who she thinks must be related to Princess Zaida. It looks really similar to her home, maybe they're connected somehow? Fiana is very confused when Snowstorm tells her that she's the lost relative of someone she's never heard of, but thinks this is a nice mare."
aestloniasnowstorm.61.a:0 "Nice to meet you!"
aestloniasnowstorm.62.t:0 "The Land of Magic"
aestloniasnowstorm.62.d1:0 "##TODO, Snowstorm visits Firtree and talks with Iorweth, who tries to heal her but she thinks he's trying to kill her and freaks out and runs away."
aestloniasnowstorm.62.d2:0 "##TODO, Snowstorm visits Firtree and talks with Shinespark, who takes a liking to the crazy mare and thinks she's really interesting, pretty soon Flaming Nebula has to drag Snowstorm away from falling in love with Shinespark."
aestloniasnowstorm.62.a:0 "Wow..."
aestloniasnowstorm.63.t:0 "The Ramps"
aestloniasnowstorm.63.d:0 "##TODO, Snowstorm wanders around the pyramids, and in the heat stroke she starts thinking that the aliens must have built these as ramps to leave their spaceships, maybe even they are just ramps from spaceships? When she collapses a pony gives her water. She comes to ranting about the aliens being about to lift her into space."
aestloniasnowstorm.63.a:0 "I was so close!"

### Snow Qalam events ###
aestloniaqalam.1.t:0 "Questioning Beliefs"
aestloniaqalam.1.d:0 ""Miss president. Congratulations on your well-deserved success." The stallion in a velvet tux trotted a precarious line between being servile and condescending, while failing to notice that neither impressed Snow Qalam. "Me and my friends in the Kapitali are very happy with the return of stability to the nation."\n\n"I am sure they also support the upcoming reforms, mister chairpony." Keeping her smile polite, she straightened her posture ever so slightly.\n\nThis answer caused Silver Gloss to shrug dismissively. "Your rhetoric already swayed the lumpen, no need to keep up the utopian charade with me. We're creatures of business, after all, and I would hate to imagine I'm dealing with a naive dilettante."\n\n"Naturally, as would I. Please, here are the drafts we have been discussing. I am certain you will find the terms quite agreeable."\n\nIt had been just a few days in office, but the rhythm of life at the helm of the country had already presented itself in all of its jaded, monotonous glory. From bankers such as this one to union leaders, from staff members to her own party followers, most were content with going back to a familiar path. Snow Qalam, however, promised herself that she will never go down that route."
aestloniaqalam.1.a:0 "Harmony is not stagnancy."
aestloniaqalam.2.t:0 "From Beyond"
aestloniaqalam.2.d:0 ""Thou must hear me, soul of south. Hear me, and heed words of mine."\n\nThe voice squeaked like fresh snow under hooves, shifted to the crackling of broken ice and turned back only to start the change again. It was not melodic, but rather captivating and powerful. Some of the sounds dissipated quickly, summoning echoes of foreign tones, others lingered, pressing deeper and pulling on other senses. The pink of a newly born dawn, the fickle warmth of a festive bonfire, the smell of fir tree and salt, all came and went in waves.\n\n"Redeem thy charges, chieftess, leaving none bereft of harmony true. Let no barrier mundane stop thee, and shine bright to banish shadows cold. Follow my creed to the utmost, and at the greatest coven thou will find a wonder of wonders."\n\nThe strange dream released Snow Qalam suddenly, as if a great paw pulled its talons apart, causing her to shudder and wake up. Yet, neither shower, nor cup of camomile tea, nor the worldly worries of tomorrow would make the memory of the vision fade."
aestloniaqalam.2.a:0 "This was magic, not a mere trick."
aestloniaqalam.3.t:0 "The Promise"
aestloniaqalam.3.d:0 "Snow Qalam had not planned on making a grand election speech. She considered such frivolous gestures rather unwarranted, especially with the volume of other issues demanding her personal attention. Instead, printed pamphlets with the TBT agenda were distributed across major population centers with additional copies to be delivered to the remote areas of the country.\n\nMuch to her surprise, these very pamphlets were wielded by an agitated crowd surrounding the presidential palace on an otherwise unremarkable day. As soon as she went outside to investigate the commotion, a deluge of questions and accusations erupted. When? How? Why did the morally bankrupt establishment deserve the nation's trust? Was there substance behind colorful pictures and pretty little words?\n\nSwamped at first, Qalam managed to maintain her composure and create an orderly session out of the chaos of the protest. Addressing every challenge openly and calmly, she explained, educated, gave specifics and, most importantly, hope. This was done with no deception or flashy orating, but by meeting her people halfway, as integrity and kindness were the principal weapons against the cycle of hatred gripping Aestlonia and Zebrica as a whole. Of course, her audience did not turn into ardent harmonists at the tap of the hoof..."
aestloniaqalam.3.a:0 "...but they would give her a chance."
aestloniaqalam.4.t:0 "Rethinking An Idea"
aestloniaqalam.4.d:0 "What stood in the way of Hestrayan unity? To the ponies like Zaida or even Winter Qalam this question was purely political, a matter of government structures, dynastic interplay, perhaps "minor ethnic differences". Once, the entire territory was a single province of Saddle Arabia, and surely some clever maneuvering could restore this coveted way of things.\n\nHowever, Snow Qalam disagreed and disagreed fundamentally. Societal divides had always stemmed from material factors, with wealth and class just as important as national borders, if not more so. After thorough considerations, her mind was settled: she must not be moderate. Every gap needed bridging, and if her vision was to come true, she needed to act bravely."
aestloniaqalam.4.a:0 "The true reform is coming."
aestloniaqalam.5.t:0 "Maretonia Ablaze"
aestloniaqalam.5.d:0 "All the groundwork, all the projects, all the hopes for a victory of light, peace and harmony - everything was trampled over. The insidious elements across Hestraya had successfully subverted Snow Qalam's efforts to join its halves together. Worse, these dark forces had pushed the two nations to the brink of war, using brazen provocations and manipulating the northern government. It was with a heavy heart Snow Qalam decided to rise up to the challenge, but rise up she did: first, order would be restored, and then healing would take place."
aestloniaqalam.5.a:0 "For the greater good!"
aestloniaqalam.6.t:0 "Expanding The Union"
aestloniaqalam.6.d:0 "A growing nation naturally required better mechanisms to support the larger population and ensure overall stability. Luckily, the AGWU had already demonstrated solid understanding of delicate handling of high-tension questions, such as the racial one, meaning that Snow Qalam had a foundation to rely upon. A few rounds of negotiations with the socialists resulted in a provisional agreement outlining the process of establishing branches in new territories and their legal powers. The president felt rather pleased with the developments: her promise of collaboration with other political powers was upheld and, even more importantly, the welfare of future citizens was boosted."
aestloniaqalam.6.a:0 "We too believe in representation and equality."
aestloniaqalam.7.t:0 "No More Fear"
aestloniaqalam.7.d:0 "Kamid observed the trucks rolling into the village with an outward calmness, although there was plenty of worry simmering inside of him. The conflict against Aestlonia had taken its toll on his neighbors, yet the community persevered, dutifully toiling in the quarries. There were no warhorses here, just ordinary Karkadannistani stallions and mares watching their elder meeting the occupying force from the safety of ramshackle houses.\n\nWhen the vehicles stopped, a single pony came out. To Kamid's surprise, they did not look like a soldier at all, as there were no weapons or uniform or even a threatening, imposing manner to be found. Instead, the guest wore a colorful modern robe and kept respectful distance.\n\n"Honorable elder. My name is Meeli, and I am with the offices of the Eastern Hestrayan Governorate." They bowed, and Kamid instinctively responded in kind.\n\n"Our humble land welcomes its victorious masters. How can we be of service?"\n\n"We are delivering free aid to the settlements in need on the president's orders." Allowing their words to sink in for a moment, Meeli continued. "I would love to hear how we can be of service instead, as well as discuss whether your workers would be willing to lend a voice to our miner union, joining their fellows from the local area."\n\nThis generosity was entirely unexpected, but hardly unwelcome. Word by word, the two creatures struck against the walls of suspicion, and even though these decades old grudge-wrought bastions were not brought down, the first blow left its mark."
aestloniaqalam.7.a:0 "It was never too late to forget and forgive."
aestloniaqalam.8.t:0 "One Of Many Steps"
aestloniaqalam.8.d:0 "The Harmonious Zone of Hestraya became reality, and Snow Qalam stood at its helm. When she was younger, she dreamt of the creatures around her finding strength to nurture the spark of good inside them on their own. Later, when politics called to her, she realized the crushing weight of this task for an individual and sought to help them systematically. Now, with her hooves holding the reins of power, the unseemly reality mixed itself in, with so many lives broken and lost in struggles against the corrupt and malevolent. Nonetheless, she would not be deterred: surrender without redeeming or enlightening the entirety of Zebrica would only mean an inevitable return to the old cycle of violence. Her success at this stage meant that her system worked, and her ardent vision bid for the change to continue."
aestloniaqalam.8.a:0 "The true start of a shared wonder!"
aestloniaqalam.9.t:0 "National Healing"
aestloniaqalam.9.d:0 "##TODO, event about Snow Qalam's plan to heal Aestlonia, she knows that it won't be easy but she won't give up on her nation that easily, she knows it is possible. Her first order was to increase funding for healthcare-related sectors of the economy, since before the metaphorical healing can take place a physical one needs to be guaranteed. The next steps are also pretty clear in her mind, she both needs to invest in the poorer areas of the nation so everyone may be in the same standing and also get to work in her redemption program idea, where she believes it is possible to make anyone "good" as true evil does not exist."
aestloniaqalam.9.a:0 "This nation will be allowed to rest."
aestloniaqalam.10.t:0 "Clouds Part"
aestloniaqalam.10.d:0 "It felt strange to wear the army uniform again. The stiffness of the cloth, the unchanged pale color, the slight creak it made with every movement, it was all coming back to Storm Alsaqie. As her mind slowly shook off the icy numbness of Windigo influence, more and more memories resurfaced, but these ones, rather simple by themselves, struck a chord somewhere deeper.\n\nWhile Storm's thoughts coursed through her consciousness, her body kept to the charted course: a door, a hallway, a turn, another door, and finally a room. As soon as she stepped inside, however, a dozen stares pierced her contemplation and tore it down. It would be a stretch to say that she knew the creatures inside, as it had been many years since she saw her old battle comrades. These were not the betrayers - a lot of time would pass before she finally could find resolve to meet those who shot her down on the fateful patrol, - but acquaintances, squadmates, once even friends.\n\nThe carefully prepared speech stuck in her throat, and the remnants of dark magic flared up, for a moment revealing every scar, every fear, all the pain the veterans in front of Storm carried. She shuddered, as if slapped, and did something long forgotten: she started to cry.\n\nWhen one of the ponies, White Stream, came closer and hugged her, her first instinct was to push the mare away, but instead Storm sank into the embrace. One after the other, the rest joined up, bringing warmth, understanding and even wordless forgiveness, as another wonder revealed itself under the streams of tears."
aestloniaqalam.10.a:0 "The atoning guard smiled."
aestloniaqalam.11.t:0 "Cold Iron"
aestloniaqalam.11.d:0 "After the tumultuous reconnection with her colleagues, the routine of military life quickly swept Storm Alsaqie up. For the initial period of understandable probation, she was paired with White Stream to oversee one of the new rural training camps in the south of the country.\n\n"Cadet Tavli! Do we have a problem here?" The stallion she called out to immediately stood at attention, almost in sync with the other ponies around him. Although her menacing past was deliberately kept out of focus, the local recruits found their instructor to be disciplined and very demanding, yet never cruel.\n\n"Yes, ma'am. I believe the course is not set up properly." A murmur rose up between the soldiers, but quickly died under Storm's steely gaze. "The targets stand at the wrong distance."\n\n"Your rifle, cadet." With the weapon taken from Talvi, she made a few carefully lined practice shots. Despite the fact that each one hit its mark, she could clearly see that the observation is correct. "Well spotted. Take point, and lead your cohort to fix those, and then re-attempt the exercise. If the new layout is up to the regulations, you get extra break time. Go!"\n\nAs the squad rushed to complete the order, Storm quietly nodded to herself. It used to be that she hated training, the fuss and indignity of "foal-sitting". Her younger self would reprimand the recruit, punish his fellows and on a particularly sour day dress down the younger officers formally responsible for the range. The cost of a minor mistake in the cult would be much more severe. Fortunately, all of this was in the past."
aestloniaqalam.11.a:0 "Harmony needs warriors of valor and will."
aestloniaqalam.12.t:0 "Never Too Late"
aestloniaqalam.12.d:0 "Her experiences with the members of the old Advisory Council were definitely not something Snow Qalam could describe as friendship-conducive. Despite being open to the possibility, she found the atmosphere too charged with mutual mistrust, especially when it concerned Millenary Path. In this light, her positive personal trend with Snowstorm was unexpected, but very welcome. Under the gloomy, troubled exterior there lay a naive, curious soul in dire need of guidance. The president was happy to be her first point of contact with the gentler world, helping her enroll in the new educational programme for adult learners.\n\nToday, Snow Qalam was in the dormitories of the Varjupaik University specifically to check on Snowstorm. Waiting in her room, filled to the brim with science books and art supplies in various states of advanced disarray, could cause a bit of a vertigo, but it did not take long. The older mare barged in as a living incarnate of her own name, hugging the visitor tightly.\n\n"Oh! You are here! I knew that, sorry! But there was this "Astrophysics Basics" lecture - amazing stuff." Overflowing with enthusiasm, she chattered on with neck-breaking speed. "Almost as good as the hoofpainting class. Wait a moment, it should be here somewhere."\n\n"I can see that the first two weeks went well!" With a hug of her own, Snow Qalam stepped aside, allowing Snowstorm to dive into one of the paper stacks. "But no rush, no rush, please. We have time!"\n\n"Yes, yes, yes. Of course. Aha!" Clutching the sheet with her teeth, the now-student turned around. "Ere. Ike it?" She held up a neat drawing of two ponies vaguely resembling the present company, decorated with generous amounts of glitter."
aestloniaqalam.12.a:0 "It was simply lovely, just as their time together."
aestloniaqalam.13.t:0 "A Friendly Gesture"
aestloniaqalam.13.d:0 "The crisp cold morning air prickled the nostrils with each breath, spicing up the morning jog with delightful freshness. Snow Qalam used to be an avid runner, and so she was glad to take on the extended offer, even if somewhat surprised by the particulars.\n\n"And how are your sessions going?  Good progress?" She went for another unrelated topic, reasoning that her companion must have a reason for picking this patch of wilderness for their quality time together.\n\n"Oh, yes." Without breaking the pace, Snowstorm let out a hearty laugh. "Doctor Kelgi knows her stuff. And the exercises she suggested are doing wonders for me. Haven't had a single bad dream last week. Still can't sleep sometimes, but now if I go for a night walk I don't get startled by every shadow. We're almost there, by the way."\n\nFollowing the direction of her hoof-wave, they turned towards an inconspicuous forest path leading up to a small hill. Snowstorm moved with confidence, clearing snow and fallen branches until a cave entrance was revealed. Inside there stood neatly organized stacks of crates.\n\n"Guns!" The older mare answered Snow Qalam's silent question with unreserved glee. "No, seriously. One of the cult's caches. There are more around. You'd have a use for them, right?"\n\nSomehow, Snow Qalam was not too surprised."
aestloniaqalam.13.a:0 ""The army will have an early Neighle Night.""
aestloniaqalam.14.t:0 "The Voice Spoketh"
aestloniaqalam.14.d:0 ""Camomile for you and ginger and lemon for me. There we go." Setting up two cups on the table, Snowstorm looked at her friend quizzically. "Are you alright? I have been gone for ten minutes, and the cookie plate is still full."\n\n"Huh? Yes. I was just pondering something. Thanks." Snow Qalam picked up a biscuit and absent-mindedly took a large bite. "Remember how you were telling me about the way Windigos, well, talk? The visions, the whispers, the catching-you-in-the-sleep? I have been having something of a similar experience."\n\nOver the next ten minutes, the younger pony regaled the details of her brief encounter with something from beyond, sipping on the warm brew and answering the questions from Snowstorm until the latter was ready to give her verdict.\n\n"I can see the similarities, sure. But no Windigo would ever ask for something nice or remotely good." She tilted her head a bit. "Maybe with all this forgiveness business you accidentally redeemed one?"\n\n"Don't be silly." The motherly tone came surprisingly often to Snow Qalam during their evenings together. "I'm just an open-minded creature, not some kind of magical princess.""
aestloniaqalam.14.a:0 "Yet, the possibility did stick in her open mind."
aestloniaqalam.15.t:0 "Mending The Rift"
aestloniaqalam.15.d:0 ""Look, madame president. Miss? You know, since we're having ourselves a private chat, I'll stick to Qalam." Vastik Kabja did not wait for approval of this form of address. "So, Qalam. It's not that I'm ungrateful for the amnesty - I can imagine what marshal Sayif had in store for me - but why are you doing all this?"\n\n"It is very simple, Vastik." Snow Qalam matched his jabbering with a calm confidence. "You care about Arabian ponies. I care about them too. This post I am offering is not a carrot to shut them up, and neither is it a leisurely retirement for you. The mistreatments of the past must be compensated, and cultural equality must advance. I have the resources, and I need passionate creatures on the ground, ones who can direct the reconciliation efforts. It boils down to two simple facts. One, this is the only proper way to really help your kin. Two, this is the only way you can truly reconnect with them."\n\n"You know what?" Flashing his chipped grin, the veteran stomped his hoof on the table. "Fine. I'll play nice. But you should know, just in case - this stallion does not forgive or forget.""
aestloniaqalam.15.a:0 "Luckily for both, this mare did."
aestloniaqalam.16.t:0 "New Oath"
aestloniaqalam.16.d:0 "The various political events taking place in front of the presidential palace were becoming a fairly popular trend. To Snow Qalam's great pleasure, most were not protests, but rather celebrations of certain causes or even marches in support of government initiatives. Holding up the democratic spirit, they usually did not require any involvement from the officials above the city level.\n\nToday, however, her personal presence was very much required. A significant crowd of ponies had gathered, with them looking rather determined and waving green flags embroidered with an unfamiliar PMLA acronym. Many of the banners proudly demonstrated another string of beautiful characters, and just when Snow Qalam began to realize that these were more than a pattern, a familiar voice filled the square with the help of a loudspeaker.\n\n"We greet our benefactor and the great partner of the kin! Hip-hip-hooray!" The assembled creatures echoed the cheer with joyful intensity. "And we, as a community, always return the favor. President's Most Loyal Arabians shall be Hestraya's new hoof to stand on, in peace and at war. Let our glorious cooperation for harmony never end!"\n\nWithout losing his cocky smile, Vastik Kabja bowed, setting another example to be vigorously repeated."
aestloniaqalam.16.a:0 "There was a true leader under the dust and grime."
aestloniaqalam.17.t:0 "A Lonesome Abode"
aestloniaqalam.17.d:0 "They said that there were few warriors in Aestlonia, no, on Zebrica as a whole, which were more vicious and barbaric then Tume Koletis. The grisly skull headpiece of his was considered by many to be the ultimate symbol of the terrible berserker, but now, with the eyes underneath losing their murderous glimmer, it reminded Snow Qalam of a mourning mask. The stallion before her looked exhausted, his posture sagged and breath uneven, as if shaken by an unending stream of quiet sobs.\n\n"Our mutual acquaintances have let me know that you wanted to meet me personally." Speaking softly, the president carefully watched for any reaction and pressed on only after a single slight nod. "You wish for solitude, to take up gardening. I wanted to personally make sure that there are no misunderstandings - here is the property deed for a plot of land in the west, if you truly want it."\n\n"There is power in life born in the ice." Tume’s answer was raspy and somber. "I felt it myself once, and I squandered it in the dark. I shall make my peace first, and then, when I am worthy, I shall make amends."\n\nIt went without saying that the weight of his past deeds was considerable, and there was but a single thread by which this broken creature hung on to his soul. Seeing it bared before her, thin and weak, Snow Qalam knew that this was no time to push. She passed him the papers, watching a flicker of remorseful hope appear."
aestloniaqalam.17.a:0 ""Call on us when you need and come back when you can.""
aestloniaqalam.18.t:0 "A Missive From Mystic"
aestloniaqalam.18.d:0 ""President Snow Qalam,\n\nI write to once again express my enormous gratitude over the offer you extended and the joy I have experienced in my first month at the Grand University of Hestraya. The Department of Magical Sciences has graciously allowed me to split the time between the project we discussed and a free-form multidisciplinary educational course. While the latter is more of a personal diversion, it has allowed me to quickly fill in the regrettable gaps in my rather one-sided occult curriculum and the former is progressing at a steady pace. I expect that the first practical results of my research will become available shortly, and with the help of my new colleagues we will be able to distribute the most safe and cost-effective methods of protection against harmful spells and supernatural effects to the areas in need. \n\nFinally, I would like to mention that together with a group of my former associates we have found the community volunteer projects rather soothing. Rest assured, we will continue engaging with them.\n\nKind regards,\nMustsurm""
aestloniaqalam.18.a:0 "Knowledge can be a power for good too."
aestloniaqalam.19.t:0 "A Little Faith"
aestloniaqalam.19.d:0 "The very sight of the ever-serious marshal sitting on a soft pastelle-colored couch with perfect posture and holding a cupcake much like a hoof grenade was quite inspirational. If they were friends, Snow Qalam would definitely ask Golden Sayif to pose for a picture, but in reality she could only hope that the atmosphere would ease at least some of the tension.\n\n"I must say that I did not expect you to be the one to repeat Zaida's folly."

With each line of the report Snow Qalam grew more and more pale.\n\nIt was true that the zebra was a slave under the Mazwi regime, and that she fled its collapse. However, she was no ordinary indentured creature, but a hunter of her own kind, a zealous reeducator and a leader of a cult-like organization which viewed the bondage as an ultimate social mechanism. This twisted entity had already put its roots down in Aestlonia, and if "Aunt Amza" would win the elections, they were harboring plans to subvert the national path and attempt a reactionary coup in the Great Lakes, crushing any states on the way. The sources went into great detail about the atrocities planned for the poor locals, from labor camps and complete removal of personal property to harshest food quotas and total government control over the individual life choices. This stood as an affront to all the principles the president held dear, and she felt a rare wave of anger rising over this two-muzzled mare. How could she live among free creatures for years, while keeping her heart so dark, plotting such unimaginable cruelties upon her kin? Was this the one who had already rejected redemption, a naturally evil soul?"

Although there was not much reputation to salvage with the slavery-bound, malice-driven "Great Plan" out in the open and she was removed from all the party posts, she made the headlines by volunteering for a continuous social service in the most impoverished parts of the country. According to the intelligence reports, Amza also thoroughly dispersed her clandestine group, the "Crimson Sun", and the remaining members demonstrated no activity indicative of their old operations.\n\nDespite the fact that the zebra refused to talk to the president or any members of the inner circle, decrying herself to be "unworthy", as well as a number of very vocal skeptics calling this an escape from justice, Snow Qalam held to belief that she made the right choice. Even if this was just an opportunistic charade, there was a chance for the ordeal to transform the one fallen from grace, and the harmony dictated that this gamble was worth it."

Qalam says it's very easy to simply cast aside the wrongs we have committed and pretend like we are pure people, but that does not mean it is correct, instead she takes it upon herself to apologize to all of those Aestlonia has wronged. She apologizes to the Arabian community for the lack of attention they received over these years, she apologizes for the horses in Aestlonia that had to suffer due to ignorant people treating them as if they were the leaders of Karkadannistan and were responsible for that nation's actions, and she also even apologizes to the cultists, saying that such a group wouldn't exist if Aestlonia was a proper nation for its people, noting that this proves that the nation has historically failed a good part of its most vulnerable citizenry."

Just after the "hug" ends the Windigo writes a message with their ethereal glow by moving their hooves, like trying to write a message with neon-sticks. Here they slightly break their promise, asking if they could talk to Qalam directly, namely by sending their words directly into her mind, seemingly having something to tell her, the pony agrees. what follows is the Windigo fully coming clean to Qalam once they could "talk" freely. They admit that it was them in that weird vision that Qalam had all that time ago, and that they hadn't done it with any benevolent intentions in mind, instead they were just covering their bases, seeing if this ambitious pony would truly be able to extinguish pain and misery from Zebrica by challenging them to do so, and if it did happen they would swiftly step in to "guide" it in a different slightly more malicious way in order to ensure they had a source of food, perhaps making themselves pink and acting like some embodiment of harmnony would do said trick. That way they could lead the nation to a path of war right under Qalam's nose, even if it meant betraying her trust and twisting her vision. The spirit does not ask for her forgiveness, instead they just wished to be honest with her the same way she had been honest with them, and they did not expect the fact that they hadn't acted upon said wishes to absolve them of blame. But instead of the shouting they might have been expecting an earlier scene would repeat, with this time Qalam being the one to offer and initiate the hug."

aestloniaqalam.58.d:0 "##TODO, event where we read the inner thoughts of someone, it's a little cryptic and mysterious but it isn't hard to figure out that these are Harmony's inner ramblings. Here they vaguely think about how close Qalam got to completely wiping out the Windigos with her ideology, that she almost extinguished the emotions that they needed to exist, no Windigo can exist without pain and suffering, that's what they were always told. Harmony was lucky to have intervened when they did, what could Qalam have done if left unchecked? They never thought she would actually take them up on their challenge or that she would get this far. But none of that matters now, it's clear that they just need to find a way to bring this around, a way to just slightly influence her system to serve them without blowing their cover. Here they also think back to a little conversation they had with this ex-cultist named Snowstorm during a dream, said something about finding new emotions to feed upon, but that's simply ridiculous, attention and adoration couldn't be enough to keep a Windigo going, could it? Maybe Qalam is just rubbing off on them with her crazy thinking..."

aestloniamaregypt.01.d:0 "##TODO, event where some studied ponies from a preservation society tell princess Zaida about the new spell that allows them to "scan" old documents for information without damaging their brittle physical structure. They say that they had been developing this spell for a while and since the nation took a more revivalist turn they decided to offer what they were able to extract from Cleopatrot's old journals to the princess. This makes Zaida quite happy, after all Cleopatrot is quite simply the founding mother of the whole nation and the reason ponies are in Hestraya in the first place and it will possibly help ease the Maregyptian revivalist divide by hopefully seeing what Cleopatrot truly wanted."

aestloniamaregypt.0.d:0 "##TODO, first person journal written by Cleopatrot, being the first one related to the GUI. This one pretades the whole march south, being years before that happened. Here we see a young Cleopatrot still living in R'ataphet where she shows her usual lack of humility. The whole entry boils down to the princess hyping herself up and saying how she was appointed as the leader of the Dahshoof province and this clearly means that given some years she might even become queen of Maregypt due to her general excelency in everything. This entry was basically meant as something that would be read by future generations so they can get an "unbiased" view of her "humble" start."

aestloniamaregypt.10.d:0 "##TODO, event set some years later, meaning the Cleopatrot has been governing over the province of Dahshoof for a bit. The focus of this event is about reports of the Sphinxs having taken over the capital, even more alarming they seem to have bested Prince Hisan's attempt to stop them. Cleopatrot gives quite the biased report of these events, painting the Prince as some incompetent idiot who had it coming, and that if Maregypt was under her rule this would never have happened. Cleopatrot also writes about she prepared a grandiose caravan with every last bit of money she had available, using it to hire protection and purchase supplies. She notes that she has been able to convince quite a few people to come alongside her to a march south to safer lands, promising that they would return once the threat had been dealt with."

She writes that she did not want to stop for any reason as that would be a drain on supplies, but the people nagged and complained to such a degree that she was forced to comply. She says that the ponies of this generation have grown soft, and that the original settlers of Maregypt wouldn't get tired after a just few weeks of trotting. As a side note she writes on how beautiful and expansive the (Arabian) sea is, noting that she never had the chance to see it before and how some ponies are trying to fish in it to compliment their allocated rations."
aestloniamaregypt.2.a:0 "Some rest should do them well."
aestloniamaregypt.3.t:0 "Slowdowns"
aestloniamaregypt.3.d:0 "##TODO, event that takes place a considerable amount of weeks after the previous one, Cleopatrot notes how they should have been way further down her planned trail at this point but the ponies have taken great interest to the native horses of the region, and the interest has been mutual. She's clearly annoyed, noting on how the two groups would just waste hours upon hours chatting and trading instead of focusing on the objective, it got to such a point that she had to cut rations to those who participated on these acts in order to "convince" them to get moving again. She notes that she only hopes that this available southern homeland she theorizes about truly exists so this journey can be for something."

aestloniamaregypt.4.d:0 "##TODO, event set near where Sadlhara now stands. Here Cleo writes that the ponies of her caravan have grown quite restless due to the long journey, and that her comment that they were at fault for delaying it has not made things better, some even questioned the royal about if she even knew what the destination ultimately was. She admits to have confessed to the crowd that she didn't truly know if anything awaited them at the end of this arduous journey, but logic dictated that the further south they got the colder the continent would become, and by extent it would be less likely to find highly sought after and/or settled lands, therefore a perfect empty place for her ponies to settle and develop on. She also makes a point that it might not be the most friendly of environments to most races, but with the help of the pegasi on the caravan they could easily make the place into something worth settling by altering the weather."

aestloniamaregypt.5.d:0 "##TODO, due to the nature of the caravan it means that Cleopatrot has become quite the accessible figure, way more than she used to be as now anyone in the group can speak to her if they so choose. Obviously they still need to be respectful, as she notes she won't hesitate to order the guards to tackle someone for insolence. In this journal entry in specific she notes that a young pony, possibly a teenager, came up to her and basically admitted that he was very scared and tired, and that he didn't know if this journey would pay out or if he and his family would make it to the end, soon he also started to sob. Cleo writes that she never had to deal with something like this before, to see a commoner be this vulnerable, emotive, and honest in her presence, and that it made her quite emotive as well. She says that she comforted the young pony, saying that everything would be alright and that they were should be halfway there at that point, perhaps even less."

aestloniamaregypt.6.d:0 "##TODO, event where Cleopatrot notes her caravan's encounter with a big mountain chain that forced them to swerve west into this unknown landmass, no maps she ever read had included this faraway land, but judging by the freezing temperatures and the sporadic local populations she knew they had to be close to their promised land. One such encounter with said population led to a tense standoff between the ponies and some seemingly nomadic group of horses. Thankfully things calmed down and both groups found a way to communicate with one another, even if just by guesswork and drawings on the dirt. The gist of what the horses said was that the lands to the west were avoided at all costs, both due to their hostility even to the seasoned locals and the "floral curse" as they called it. Cleo doesn't seem to care about the last part, writing that it must be some nonsensical horse superstition, she only focus on the fact that there is free land to the west."

aestloniamaregypt.7.d:0 "##TODO, event set some weeks after Cleopatrot's caravan finally reached the end of their journey, this being on a small bay on the southern coast of this so-called Hestrayan peninsula. Here Cleo writes about how she founded and named the town of Reskhet in these great lands and how the pegasi and earth ponies have been hard at work on making this place liveable. She also talks about having given herself the title of "Grand Queen of Hestraya" as a personal reward for her great work. Finally she notes on how this land is covered in many beautiful flowers that seem to challenge nature itself by surviving on the once harsh environment, she even took some of the prettier black ones back home with her, ever since she has felt a litte dizzy, but says it is probably because of the march and nothing else."

aestlonianews.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Today, the world shakes its head to clear it, hoping to wake from a nightmare. From the Ice Dragons to Zaikiria, the entire so-called "Great Artery" is under the control of one mare - Snowstorm. An Aestlonian native and windigo cultist, she has marched her eccentric and perhaps even absurd synthesis of windigo worship and socialism to ultimate victory. When not spouting complex conspiracy theories or absurd denials of basic reality, she has preached that the Windigos are the protectors of Aestlonia, and her rule is merely in their service. [AES.GetNameDefCap] is reportedly a land beyond comprehension, with even the most basic tenets of statecraft defied in favor of all-encompassing fanaticism and faith. No foreign relations have been forged with this new empire, apparently because Snowstorm believes all other states to be controlled by aliens."

aestlonianews.2.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]In central Zebrica, a new and horrific form of "communism" has taken root. Amza Outtara, widely believed to be a moderate reformist, was in truth not just a former slave, but a former slave-catcher! And now, virtually the entire population of the Great Lakes has been forced into slavery of the most brutal form. Under her firm gaze, so-called "reactionaries" (namely, anyone who doesn't like slavery) are ruthlessly made examples of. Perhaps most frighteningly, it seems her aims do not stop at Great Laker zebra lands. Rumors abound that she will strike the Stormlands, Maregypt, and perhaps even Saddle Arabia. Whatever her true goals, one thing is certain: any hope of freedom has been crushed in the most awful way imaginable."

aestloniakelpie.1.d:0 "##TODO, event about Zaida going in her little clandastine night operation to investigate the weird noises coming from the ocean near Merelinn. She walks near the shoreline of the beach, at first she doesn't see anything for a long time and even thinks about heading back home before anybody sees her there, this certainly is no proper conduct for a princess. But, out of nowhere she begins hearing this calming melody coming out of a shallow part of the ocean, her body naturally begins trotting towards it, like she's in a trance, the water near the source of the noise is moving in a gentle but non-natural way. And then, something, some kind of water monster, jumps out and tackles her to the sand in one quick movement."
aestloniakelpie.1.a:0 ""Don't hurt me!""
aestloniakelpie.2.t:0 "Voice of the Ocean"
aestloniakelpie.2.d:0 "##TODO, event where the Kelpie Queen calms Zaida down and apologizes for spooking the princess and gets off her, helping Zaida to get up from the ground, even using their watery "hoof" to help clean the pony. The queen claims they were simply very excited to finally see a real pony after so long, the creature having a certain difficulty in speaking, like spoken language isn't natural to them. The Kelpie properly introduces themselves to Zaida and notes that they haven't been in Aestlonia for a few good years. Zaida is stil a little spooked but has calmed down a bit, and is now getting a bit interested on what this creature is and what it has to offer."
aestloniakelpie.2.a:0 ""And why did you contact me?""
aestloniakelpie.3.t:0 "The Oceanic Offer"
aestloniakelpie.3.d:0 "##TODO, this comes after the previous event, here the Queen explains that they werem't a fan of the policy of abandoning Aestlonia when the Storm King invaded, but their collective/people had decided on it, so they were forced to comply, therefore the Queen wanted to make-up for this "betrayal" by working together with an Aestlonian yet again, with Zaida being the perfect pony for this job, as the Queen notes that the young Princess has the guts, vision, and willpower their kelpies lack. Zaida takes a bit to agree to the offer, but is still surprisingly quick to accept, something about working with this alien-like creature and destroying the political status quo in Aestlonia is something that speaks to her deeply, besides, it sounds like a fun adventure. The Queen is very happy to hear Zaida's acceptance, so much so that they exclaim to the world that they will make the best married couple that the surface has ever seen; this almost causes Zaida to fall to the ground again as her face burns with embarrassment. The Queen either doesn't seem to notice or is purposefully ignoring Zaida's reaction."
aestloniakelpie.3.a:0 ""What did I get myself into?""
aestloniakelpie.4.t:0 "Dealing With The Deluge"
aestloniakelpie.4.d:0 "##TODO, seems like the Queen's and Zaida's sudden political marriage has caused quite the shock in their respective populations and realms, not that it comes as much of a surprise for either leader who act pretty casual about the ongoing instability. Zaida is a little nervous at first but gets quickly soothed by the Queen as they offer a solution. That solution is that they should set up a system where either leader can switch places with the other any time they want, meaning that Zaida can lead New Coltlantis and the Queen, by effect, can lead the Aboveworld (the term they use for the surface). This way each monarch can get to know their new subjects while also taking a break from their usual realm. The Queen does warn that it would be best that after a switch the monarch should try to rule for a few weeks before switching back in order to not seem uncaring. It takes a few seconds for Zaida to take everything in, but by the end she accepts the proposition."
aestloniakelpie.4.a:0 "This will be interesting."
aestloniakelpie.5.t:0 "Figuring It Out"
aestloniakelpie.5.d:0 "##TODO, in this event we have Zaida and the Queen having a casual but flustered conversation, here Zaida is trying to get a bit more familiar and closer to the Queen, but it is clear that the kelpie doesn't fully understand what being married really means, treating it as nothing more than an advanced form of friendship. Zaida is quick to note that she doesn't know much about kelpies at all, with this interaction only further proving the point, the Queen agrees and offers to teach Zaida about the history of the kelpies. The Queen also notes that kelpies don't have a writing system like ponies do, instead relying on an mostly oral system to do so, meaning that the Queen will have to tell Zaida directly about whichever event she is interested in."

aestloniakelpie.6.d:0 "##TODO, event where Zaida welcomes some new kelpies onto the surface, one of them being Flaming Nebula who she has a small chat with. The Queen is also present and makes the event more relaxed as they clearly have a good understanding of all the kelpies present. Zaida doesn't have the opportunity to meet all of them, but from the few that she did meet she can tell that they will be of great use for research and technology."

aestloniakelpielore.0.d:0 "##TODO, event where the Queen talks about the sea serpents and how they were like before coming into contact with the kelpies proper and getting their honorary title. Here the kelpie leader says the serpents never had the custom of living together in permanent settlements, instead they lived and still live in small groups/packs that at some points may meet up to exchange resources and information. It is theorized that their warrior traditions were developed from living this way since they had to develop at lot of skills of their own if they were to survive in the vast sea. But there was also another reason for this development, that being their wish to protect and guide the Water Sprites, creatures that they see as holy."

aestloniakelpielore.1.t:0 "The Water Folk"
aestloniakelpielore.1.d:0 "##TODO, event where the Queen talks about the water kelpies and how they lived before the establishment of (old) Coltlantis. She says that they were and still are very communal and that most kelpies stuck to the same large group that would travel around the seas on the look for interesting places. The Queen also notes how water kelpies have a tendency to dissipate if they do not have a strong reason to exist, in other words, if a kelpie does not keep itself busy with hobbies or whatnot it will cease to exist in a few weeks, therefore finding stuff to do was always important, which is why they moved around so much back then. As a final note the kelpie also says that they avoided contact with those on the surface, mostly due to concerns of possible conflicts."

aestloniakelpielore.2.t:0 "The Start And The End"
aestloniakelpielore.2.d:0 "##TODO, due to the growth of both sea serpent and water kelpie population and the fact they lived in the same general area it was only a matter of time before both groups were forced to make contact with one another. Thankfully things went really well, with the kelpies even awarding the sea serpents with the title of kelpie, the relationship would be further built upon with the establishment of Coltlantis proper, with the sea serpents being given the job of guard in exchange for the water kelpies helping them to rescue Water Sprites. Things would go well for a while, but due to growing populations in Equus and Griffonia and the subsequent increase of utilization of the seas the kelpies felt it was a good idea to relocate to somewhere quieter, besides, becoming too still was a bad idea anyway."
aestloniakelpielore.2.a:0 "There had to be somewhere better."
aestloniakelpielore.3.t:0 "The First Candidate"
aestloniakelpielore.3.d:0 "##TODO, the first stop on the kelpies' journey was a small collection of islands not too far away from the site that they had left, some of the kelpies suggested stopping right there and perhaps even setting something up on the surface of these islands in order to better protect the region from possible foreign threats. The Queen, the same one talking to Zaida, refused the idea since they argued that the islands had apparently already been settled and they were still way too close to all the noise they were trying to escape from, therefore they had to continue their swim."
aestloniakelpielore.3.a:0 "Let's keep looking."
aestloniakelpielore.4.t:0 "A Similar Tale"
aestloniakelpielore.4.d:0 "##TODO, much further from the previous stop the kelpies came accross yet another promising spot, but this one had also been settled by someone, and it also seemed to suffer from rising commercial routes, therefore the Queen also choose to pass on this one. Here Zaida asks why it was so important to avoid foreign activity and noise, so much so that the kelpies would abandon their homes and travel so far over it. The Queen responds that kelpies communicate with sound and song, meaning that anything that got on the way of that quickly became annoying and disorientating."
aestloniakelpielore.4.a:0 "We just need to keep looking."
aestloniakelpielore.5.t:0 "Almost Perfect"
aestloniakelpielore.5.d:0 "##TODO, after more looking and swimming the kelpies came accross and island that they believed might just have been exactly what they were looking for. It was in a mostly quiet location and the island itself had no inhabitants due to its unimpressive nature and lack of plentiful resources, which just made it the perfect area to build their new settlement around due to the low profile of it all. But the Queen had some reservations, mostly the monarch argued that this wouldn't last forever, and that sooner or later someone would come to take the island due to its proximity to a large trade area which the Queen could feel in the water from the boat movements on the east."
aestloniakelpielore.5.a:0 "But not quite."
aestloniakelpielore.6.t:0 "A Curious Look"
aestloniakelpielore.6.d:0 "##TODO, the Queen admits that they had grown a bit obsessed over exploring what was causing all that noise and movement to the east, it was as if their natural curiosity as a kelpie was overtaking their desire for peace and quiet. But the Queen also knew that it would be a bad idea to bring all of their kelpies to explore it since it could cause them to get spotted, therefore only a small group went up to the area as the rest waited a good distance back. Once there the kelpies discovered the entrance of the Arabian sea, and just by being there they could tell the true size of that body of water, even if imperfectly. If the kelpies were ever to take over the land surrounding it they could turn this place into the most perfect place to settle down, but that was simply impossible, nothing more than a crazy idea."
aestloniakelpielore.6.a:0 "We should keep this place in mind."
aestloniakelpielore.7.t:0 "The Final Stop"
aestloniakelpielore.7.d:0 "##TODO, they had found it, the perfect spot to settle down, it wasn't as expansive or as pretty as they wanted it but it would still do. The area below the frozen peninsula to their north was hardly used by many ships outside of matters close to the coast due to how frozen and shallow the waters were, that combined with the unimpressive location and lack of land meant that nobody would ever have a reason to come all the way out here to find them. The freezing temperatures also led to some water kelpies freezing over, which created the first examples of ice kelpies who later would build ice platforms on the surface of the water to live on, adding a third "tribe" to the kelpie people."

AES_storm_saving:0 "Redeem Storm Alsaqie"
AES_storm_saving_desc:0 "The leader of the Millenary Path is an obvious choice for someone who we should work to redeem, it would serve as a great example for other cultists that we are true to our word. But we cannot do so before we admit to our past mistakes, Storm was very likely attacked by her very own men all those years ago, ponies who were serving in the behalf of Aestlonia, therefore, only when we make our public admission of guilt, she might actually be willing to hear us out."
AES_snowstorm_saving:0 "Redeem Snowstorm"
AES_snowstorm_saving_desc:0 "It is clear that the self-proclaimed "Windigo-Socialist" known as Snowstorm never had a chance at a normal life, let alone the opportunity to attend school from a young age. In order to better connect with the unicorn we should further fund our education system, with the hopes of offering her the chance of taking part in the new classes aimed at adults who sadly lack schooling."
AES_kabja_saving:0 "Redeem Vastik Kabja"
AES_kabja_saving_desc:0 "Vastik Kabja might have done questionable things while serving in Arabia, but that does not mean his concerns about the Arabian community of Aestlonia aren't founded in fact. In truth the Arabian ponies haven't been treated the best by the Aestlonian state, being left aside in the hopes that their culture would slowly die out, this all coming from a place of blind vengeance due to historical Arabian occupation. We need to show that we are better than to employ such malevolent tactics as the previous government did."
AES_tume_saving:0 "Redeem Tume Koletis"
AES_tume_saving_desc:0 "Tume is a very peculiar pony, one that might seem like there is no saving, but there's certainly something we can connect with him on. Some say that Koletis wants nothing more than a chance to settle down and do their own thing, perhaps after we have proven our harmonic concept for the nation he might listen to us."
AES_mustsurm_saving:0 "Redeem Mustsurm"
AES_mustsurm_saving_desc:0 "Mustsurm is an odd one out amongst the ranks of the Millenary Path, being a pony that prefers magic and science above more traditional ritualistic ways of thinking and operating. Therefore we should try to use this fact to get her on our side, perhaps when we establish a teaching facility impressive enough to convince her to abandon her more twisted studies, instead focusing on using her mind to better society."
AES_sayif_saving:0 "Convince The Marshal"
AES_sayif_saving_desc:0 "It is known that Golden Sayif is quite unhappy with our policy of redeeming members of the Millenary Path, which is not a surprise considering her personal history with the cult. Even then, we should try to convince her to work with us, showing that her type of thinking only helps to deepen the divides of society, and if she truly wants things to change she should at least give them a chance."
AES_amza_saving:0 "Investigate Rumors About Amza Outtara"
AES_amza_saving_desc:0 "There have been some nasty rumors circulating about Amza Outtara, with some of them claiming her direct involvement in many of the unspeakable acts committed by the Mazwi Empire. We should investigate these rumors, even if it's very likely that they are false."

AES_the_tunnel:0 "Locate The Tunnel"
AES_the_tunnel_desc:0 "A few griffon intellectuals have told us about the existence of a tunnel that theoretically connects Lake Rumare to the outside ocean, being how Rumare gets their secret convoys to the open waters. We simply need to look into this."
AES_watertowns:0 "The Sacred Springs"
AES_watertowns_desc:0 "In the north of Griffonia, specifically in the hillpony area, there have been reports of several sacred springs that can greatly improve one's health. The springs are also given credit for helping with the fertility of the land. It would be a waste to not check this out."
AES_investigate_barrad:0 "Investigate Barrad"

AES_investigate_equus:0 "Start A Chapter On Equus"
AES_investigate_equus_desc:0 "The existence of Equestria and Equus as a whole is a topic that greatly interests Snowstorm, for most of her life she believed it was some kind of religious metaphor for paradise, but some have been claiming that it actually exists. No time better than now to investigate it."
AES_investigate_mare_statue:0 "Investigate The Statue"
AES_investigate_mare_statue_desc:0 "Being one of the first things that Snowstorm saw as she entered Manehattan by the water means that the cultist grew quite interest in investigating it. What kind of methods did they use to build such an impressive structure? And is there something hidden inside?"
AES_expose_the_faker:0 "Expose The Faker"
AES_expose_the_faker_desc:0 "There have been reports of a pony who has been given credit for first coming up with the idea of communism and socialism as a whole. We simply need to expose this obvious fraudster, as that credit clearly should go to Snowstorm instead."
AES_expose_the_windigo_sisters:0 "Expose The Windigo Sisters"
AES_expose_the_windigo_sisters_desc:0 "How come there are only alicorns on Equus? And how come that all of them come from Equestria? This clearly means one thing, these "creatures" are not naturally-occurring organisms, instead they must be of Windigo origin, as only that would explain their overwhelming power. Canterlot needs to know about the corrupted Windigo sisters, soon we shall bring them the truth."
AES_visit_the_town:0 "Visit The Town"
AES_visit_the_town_desc:0 "Ever since discovering Equus we have heard about a small town-sized commune that is popularly referred to as "Our Town", sitting just north of Stalliongrad. They seem to espouse an unique type of socialism called Equalism, this ideology preaching literal equality amongst all citizens of the collective. This does interest us due to our own ideological quest, therefore, we should attempt to visit this place."
AES_key_lake_excursion:0 "Key Lake Excursion"
AES_key_lake_excursion_desc:0 "There have been reports of a lake that creates monsters in the far north of Equus. We should investigate this source of paranormal activity in order to properly understand it. Some suggest that the great amount of crystals in the area might have something to do with it."
AES_the_fourth_continent:0 "The Fourth Continent"
AES_the_fourth_continent_desc:0 "With the discovery of Equus we now need to ask ourselves some important questions, such as, how did ponies get to Zebrica in the first place? It is more than obvious that there must have been some continent that connected southern Equestria to Maregypt and Hestraya. It is now our alien-given task to try to find it. Thankfully we have one of them to aid us in this investigation."
AES_the_lost_number:0 "Write About The Lost Numeral"
AES_the_lost_number_desc:0 "No concept is sacred, not even the numerical system we grew to follow as mindless sheep. There have been things forgotten by history, such as secret numerals that were erased by time, but Snowstorm shall bring at least one of them back."
AES_more_efficient_system:0 "Revolutionary Systems Of Measurement"
AES_more_efficient_system_desc:0 "In order for Aestlonia to progress in the world of today we need to improve systems that have fallen behind with time, even if they might seem perfect already."
AES_azirian_passage:0 "Investigate The Azirian Passage"
AES_azirian_passage_desc:0 "How come there are zebras all the way down in Southeastern Zebrica? The only way this can be explained is if there is a secret tunnel that connects Azir to that region, as Azir clearly is the farthest natural zebra territory before the disconnect."
AES_pyramid_mystery:0 "Investigate The Mystery of the Pyramids"
AES_pyramid_mystery_desc:0 "It doesn't make any sense that ponies would build giant pyramids for no reason. There's clearly a sinister truth behind it!"
AES_zebra_truth:0 "Finding The Truth About The Zebras"
AES_zebra_truth_desc:0 "Zebras are hardly different from your regular earth pony, both can do no real magic outside of forcing themselves to learn alchemy so they can cope with their talentless existence. This warrants some suspicion, are zebras really a race? Or are they just ponies who have painted themselves in order to appear more interesting? Whatever it might be we need to get to the bottom of it, thankfully Aestlonia has quite a prominent zebra general that we could accost for information."
AES_posada_meeting:0 "Meet With The Crimson Alien"
AES_posada_meeting_desc:0 "Posada does not fool us for even a second, it is clear that she's of extraplanetary origins, or else why would she be so interested in contacting her hidden masters? Perhaps she's trying to compete with us to get the overlords' attention. Whatever she might be or want we should still meet with her; with Nebula providing us with the much needed help when it comes to the underwater location of said encounter."
AES_ultimate_being:0 "A Creature To Unite Them All"
AES_ultimate_being_desc:0 "The arterial state will be one of many races, this is certain to cause some tension as our subjects become more diverse. Therefore, to remedy this, we should attempt to combine all species into one, this way creating a race that can help unite our people once in for all."
AES_transpolar_portal:0 "Locate The Transpolar Portal"
AES_transpolar_portal_desc:0 "Our theories suggest that the poles must be connected by a secret portal hiding somewhere within Pengaia. This could help explain the dubious historical migrations that happened in the region."
AES_storm_magic:0 "Learn From The Abominable"
AES_storm_magic_desc:0 "Even if it hurts to say the Yetis, or at least their old leader, had quite the mastery when it came to weaponize the weather for their own goals. We should attempt to learn from these terrible creatures in order to protect ourselves in the future."
AES_girafe_reserve:0 "Meet With The Giraffes"
AES_girafe_reserve_desc:0 "It seems Snowstorm has come across yet another unknown creature, said to soar into the sky like towering trees. Aliens, without question. Still, as leader of the true revolution, it is her duty to make contact with these extraordinary beings."
AES_bring_windigos_east:0 "Bring The Windigos East"
AES_bring_windigos_east_desc:0 "The lands of Southeastern Zebrica are known for their unforgiving hot and humid weather, something that we, the speakers of the Windigos, cannot allow to stand. We shall start an operation where we will attempt to send some Hestrayan Windigos to the east to combat this."
AES_golden_city:0 "Matters Of The Golden City"
AES_golden_city_desc:0 "The Golden City was a sight to behold, but sadly the world wasn't kind or worthy enough to allow for its existence. As it stands the city now is no more than a pile of rubble, we should do something about this sad reality."
AES_reconnecting:0 "The Reconnection"
AES_reconnecting_desc:0 "Snowstorm has felt as if she abandoned the Windigos by going in her new extraplanetary path. They must be very disappointed, but hopefully it's not too late to mend their connection. Only thing is that the cultist will need to show her willingness to the rapprochement, even if it might cost her life."

### Character Descs
AES_storm_alsaqie_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 3rd of September 971, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: It is not unheard of for a former royal guard to return to the court and serve in an honorary position. In the case of Storm Alsaqie, the story is not quite so simple. Officially, she was declared missing in action while patrolling skies over rural territories, only to resurface a few years later. She came back a changed mare, nursed back to health by the Millenary path, and inexplicably arose to lead her saviors. Despite her outward indifference to the past, the tales of her prior interest in the arcane and its connection to the "accident" circulate to this day.\n\nAs the guide of the cult, Storm embraced some of the trappings of modernity, actively inducting into the faith those who would be considered outsiders by the traditionally frontier-oriented believers. This, however, should not be mistaken for a change in the brutal nature of Windigo worshippers, but rather viewed as a convenient tool to spread the influence of their morbid masters.\n\nWith the successful recruitment of several prominent Aestlonians, Storm somewhat withdrew from the public eye, allowing new disciples to deal with mundane issues. Stranger still, the preacher is rarely seen by her followers, and her ice-cold voice joins only a select few ritual chants.

AES_princess_zaida_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of May 987, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: Destined to become a princess from a very young age, Zaida ascended to the Aestlonian throne after the sudden death of her mother. While many of her subjects demonstrated steadfast loyalty to the new ruler, a vocal minority, including several skeptics from the royal advisory council, expressed doubts regarding her readiness to wield power over the land.\n\nRejecting the cautious option of assuaging their concerns, Zaida endeavors to take a more proactive and assertive approach to governance. With the survival of the country being the immediate goal, she seeks radical reforms to awaken Aestlonia from its stagnation and secure the future for years to come. Ultimately, her ambition extends to the creation of a united, powerful Hestrayan nation capable of defeating any threats.\n\nOf course, any bold action requires not only willfulness but also a degree of cunning. By maintaining a harmonious, regal facade and abstaining from bureaucratic or socialite distractions under the guise of utmost diligence, Zaida bides time and builds up strength, determined to surpass her ancestors and show that she is worthy of her title.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Scroup"
AES_winter_qalam_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 3rd of September 962, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: A trusted aide of the late Rawiya II and the chosen mentor of young princess Zaida, a prolific writer, and a celebrated politician - all these honorifics are carried by a single stallion named Winter Qalam. As the current representative of the "Towards a Better Tomorrow" party (or TBT, for short) within the Aestlonian Advisory Council, he strives to be a pillar of harmony in the country.\n\nThis desire is reflected both in his literary works, which promote a sense of unity between all thinking creatures, as well as in a soft-hooved, measured approach to governance. While he does not inspire the same zealous dedication to a single ideal unlike some leaders, and faces some criticism even within his faction, notably from the ardent republicans following his sister, Snow Qalam, Winter's non-confrontational methods and developed acumen provide a basis for cooperation across the ideological spectrum.\n\nIt is worth noting that his moral code is intertwined with and supported by devout belief in Dualism. Along with fellow adherents of this religious movement, Winter seeks to promote the core tenets of Charity and Brotherhood in the everyday lives of those around him, viewing these principles as means to ward off not only the evil in one's soul but also the tangible threat of Windigos.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
AES_golden_sayif_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of November 979, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: A fierce protector of Aestlonia from threats internal and external alike, field marshal Golden Sayif has not chosen the warrior's lot, but followed it with unbreakable determination. As a young filly, she lost her parents in a Windigo cultist attack, surviving due to the timely intervention of a militia squad. The veteran officer in command chose to adopt the orphan, raising her in strict discipline and sharing his values of honor and duty.\n\nWith this upbringing, the military became a second family to Golden, the only one she truly knew. After formally joining the ranks, she demonstrated impressive prowess and strong leadership skills, quickly climbing the hierarchy of the nascent Aestlonian army. Her resolute ways, pointed political neutrality and hard-earned trust of fellow soldiers made her a natural fit for the commanding position.\n\nHowever, her career only emboldened the deep-seated hatred she had for those who destroyed her life and continued to threaten her homeland. Despite the National Unity Act allowing the so-called Millenary Path to formally participate in governance, Golden watches every move of the cultists even more intensely than before, ready to beat back their corruption with an unrelenting force.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
AES_steel_raud_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of November 959, Jäised Märed province\n\n§YBiography§!: They say few ponies could portray the essence of the Aestlonian worker as well as Steel Raud. Coming from a remote mining village, she toiled underground for the good of the community from a young age. As the years went by, Raud grew to become remarkably strong and tall, easily towering over most others, and she took every opportunity to use her natural gifts to help those weaker or less fortunate.\n\nWhen the mine ran out and was finally closed, the young mare already got herself a bit of a reputation as a local hero, one always ready to provide support, care, and, indeed, physical assistance. Raud traveled from town to town in search of work for several years, never settling in one place, but meeting many like-minded creatures, especially in the rising socialist movements. By demonstrating a certain talent for management, she directed their energy away from singular acts of charity and into a more potent global action.\n\nFollowing the signing of the National Unity Act and formation of the Aestlonian General-Workers Union, Raud, now famous nationwide was elected as its director in a landslide victory despite any perceived drawbacks, notably including her pro-monarchy position. Under her continued leadership, the Union has been devoted to protecting and uplifting the workers, successfully improving their treatment and conditions to a notable degree.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Moonatik"
AES_cryo_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: Unknown\n\n§YBiography§!: "Mere creatures cannot begin to fathom the thoughts of an ice dragon."\n\nAccidentally found by Princess Zaida during a caving trip, the ice dragon known as Cryo dismissed the terrified pegasus and allowed her escape with indifference, only for her Highness to return days later with a panicking linguist. The ice dragon slowly learned Aestlonian, and these talks soon gave the Princess the idea for an offer.\n\n"He loves military planning," she told her fearful military officers about their newest lieutenant, "And he'll boost recruitment!"\n\nTo Cryo's credit, his strategies conducted in war exercises would merit promotions, but nopony considered convincing him, out of fear or futility, that his "military planning" was mostly logistic coordination.\n\nBeyond the military, the ice dragon cares little for politics and speaks even less of his homeland. One occasion a brave-enough subordinate asked what other ice dragons were like, and Cryo huffed. "I had horns," he snarled icily.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Littlepudel"
AES_alter_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 1st of August 954, Manehattan\n\n§YBiography§!: It would be fair to say that Alter, a scion of the Tähenduses family, prominent in the corporate circles of Manehattan, was expected to show business acumen. However, it quickly proved to be potent enough to put a price on morals, bringing in the extra income at the cost of most prospective partners.\n\nFrustrated with "bleeding-heart sentimentalists", Alter moved for cooler climes of Aestlonia, hoping for fewer regulations and underdeveloped worker rights. While she found those and then some, the whole fiscal situation proved to be too primitive for a real dealer, which did not deter her in the slightest. The self-made mare poured her skills into reshaping the local economic landscape, founding Kapitali Finance Center and even collaborating directly with Rawiya II on market reforms, up to having her hoof in the establishment of the central bank.\n\nDespite initial successes, the venture could be hardly called smooth sailing, especially with the recent scandal disconnecting Alter from her own company due to claims of fund appropriations for personal projects. She has refused to comment publicly on the matter and seemingly took a step back, but money talks, and the whispers bet on her inevitable return.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
AES_snowdrop_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of October 980, Järveääres\n\n§YBiography§!: The geographical location of Aestlonia determines many things, including the specifics of the roles employed by the royal court. In particular, it is the job of a pegasus by the name of Snowdrop to ensure that the weather management corps maintain a perfect balance between freezing, chilly, thawing and plain old cold.\n\nThroughout the years of service Snowdrop has been performing these duties diligently and with quiet pride in her aptitude. She prefers to work at night, when her weakened eyesight is not disturbed by aberrant lights and it is possible to fully focus on the art of wind and frost.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Opalradiance"
AES_kelpie_queen_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: First Cycle of 519, Old Coltlantis\n\n§YBiography§!: The customs of the underwater folk differ from those of surface-dwellers in many ways. The one who is called the Queen by other kelpies is not a monarch, but rather a symbolic unifying figure, chosen by the three largest tribes in a popular election.\n\nEven though the position came with a certain power to lead negotiations with the outsiders, few expected the Queen to proceed with a large-scale contact with Aestlonians and the ensuing great expansion of the city of Zarmarej. Driven by curiosity and kind-hearted nature, they were quite happy with the outcome and interested in continuing the experiment, yet the threat of the Storm King forced kelpies back to the sea.\n\nAfter his campaign of terror was over, the Queen spent countless hours convincing their kin to attempt another emergence to the strangers above. A compromise had to be made in the end - along with the most perceptive watchers they would observe Aestlonia, reaching out only if the neighbors would prove their moral worth by themselves. Thus, they stand a hopeful vigil, awaiting a chance to truly bridge the two worlds.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Anastafury"

By dutifully studying traditional carving techniques under local masters and carefully intertwining them with modern methods and her vision, she has made a bold statement in the craft, creating impressive monuments celebrating friendship and harmony.

Unsurprisingly, the scions of these bloodlines find themselves the need to adapt to the current realities, and while some are destined to final obscurity, Lumi is renowned across the country.\n\nA distant descendant of the rulers of Särav Org, one among dozens of tribal kingdoms making up ancient Hestraya, she is greatly inspired by the unprecedented cooperation and mutual trust between her ancestors and the common ponies under their guidance. Using her considerable education and social pull, Lumi champions worker rights, collaborating with more open-minded unions. Recently, she has gone so far as to enlist in the army to "fight for her people", resulting in volunteer and donation surges.\n\nAnother passion of hers is preserving the cultural legacy of old Aestlonia. By supporting archeologists and scholars as well as promoting exhibitions and teaching courses, Lumi pushes for greater recognition of this area from the government. With the noticeable successes for both causes, "everycreature's princess" is rumored to be involved in negotiations for an official position at the Ajloun court.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Stardustspix"

He was inducted into the faith among many capable colts and fillies, but when faced with its deep macabre secrets, Pinekäbi abandoned the cult. Fleeing eastward, he took up a remote position of a ranger at the tundra reservations and did his penance by protecting the forests from any threats.\n\nPinekäbi valiantly kept his oath during the Storm King invasion and subsequent Karkadannistani occupation, becoming a prominent resistance figure.

During her own servitude, she was a slave hunter and reeducator, overseeing the integration of the thralls back into the system, one which she deemed natural, inevitable, and efficient.

Raske Nael, a fighter with a short fuse and a heavy hoof, hears its hymn within the grinding gears of machines, creaking of threads and revving of engines.\n\nHer early years were spent in the Aestlonian countryside, and they brought Raske nothing but dumb labor, a distaste for farming life and folk traditions, as well as an interest in brawling. An educated city doctor could call it "stress release", but she was simply happy to beat down an occasional thick-headed pony, especially a cultist, as these fools were quick to yap against her reformist ideals.\n\nWith no desire or reason to linger, Raske worked hard to afford a ticket for a ship west, to Stalliongrad, the promised land of social and scientific advancement for all. Shortly upon arrival, she enlisted with the army and demonstrated enough fervor and perseverance to be considered for the role of a tank commander, before a quarrel (allegedly involving sergeant Nael biting her commanding officer) caused her to be discharged. Since she was a foreigner, this closed any other opportunities, so she had to come back, embittered, yet not at all disillusioned with the marvels of technology.

AES_neutrality_party_long:0 "Aestlonian Arabian Congress     §gDecades after the collapse of Arabian rule over Aestlonia, there is still a sizable community of ponies who identify themselves with the culture, even having an Arabian-inspired language. The Congress was formed as a way to keep this unique identity alive, as well as give these ponies a way to have their concerns heard. Sadly, this hasn't proven to be very fruitful, the blame for this is commonly placed on Prince Lapis, as ponies believe his elitist and abrasive personality have doomed the Congress' acceptance chance by the general Aestlonian population.§!"
AES_communism_party:0 "AGWU"
AES_communism_party_long:0 "Aestlonian General-Workers Union     §gThe AGWU is Aestlonia's first attempt at moderate socialism. The "party" serves as a state-sponsored workers union. The Union itself was created by the previous princess as a way to appease the hard workers of the nation, as without their sacrifices this icy realm wouldn't have gotten anywhere. The AGWU's leader, Steel Raud, is one of the major supporters of Zaida outside of the TBT. Believing the princess should continue the monarcho-socialist experiment started by her mother.§!"
AES_democratic_party:0 "TBT"
AES_democratic_party_long:0 "Towards a Better Tomorrow     §gThe TBT is compromised of historical supporter of the Aestlonian monarchy. Being formed by harmonic-leaning intellectuals and political masters who were given a proper party as an effect of the Unity Act. Their leader, Winter Qalam, pratically serves as Zaida's second-in-command, even being responsible for helping raise the princess in her formative years. Even though the party is majoritarily monarchist, there are certain republican elements within it, these elements being led by the leader's sister, Snow Qalam. Even with this soft split, the party's goals still are to mantain the harmonic order in the Aestlonian realm, no matter in what shape.§!"
AES_fascism_party:0 "Millenary Path"
AES_fascism_party_long:0 "Millenary Path     §gThe Millenary Path is a fervent and controversial group of ponies who view their ancestors' exodus from Maregypt to Aestlonia as a holy event, believing that the icy spirits known as the Windigos bestowed the cold of Aestlonia upon them as a divine gift. These cultists worship the Windigos and believe that the spirits' presence and strength grow with desolation and suffering. As a result, they have historically engaged in violent acts, including village attacks, terrorism, and sacrifices, aiming to invoke the Windigos' power. Their activities have made them a feared and despised faction within Aestlonia, confined mostly to rural areas and, controversially, granted government representation in a bid for peace.§!"
AES_agwu_hestraya_updated:0 "HGWU"
AES_agwu_hestraya_updated_long:0 "Hestrayan General-Workers Union     §gThe HGWU serves as nothing more than a continuation of the AGWU. One now focused on attempting to get workers from all over Hestraya to join their expanded Union.§!"
AES_neutral_army:0 "APA"
AES_neutral_army_long:0 "Aestlonian Provisional Army     §gRecently formed as a way for Aestlonia to protect itself from foreign threats, the Provisional Army, as the name implies, is not a final solution for military issue within the nation. Instead it's a temporary last-minute fix to the issue, this being brought upon due to the Karkadanni threat to the east. The APA is not political in nature, having little interest in ruling the nation in any way. But, their leader, Golden Sayif, has time and time again threatened the cultists of the Millenary Path. It wouldn't be a stretch to say she might react poorly if they are given control over the country.§!"
AES_neutral_proper_army:0 "URAC"
AES_neutral_proper_army_long:0 "United Royal Army Command     §gThe URAC stands as a far more capable and disciplined force for defending Aestlonia and its newly acquired territories compared to the APA. Known for their professionalism and strict neutrality in national affairs, the URAC prides itself on being an unwavering institution, impervious to external influence.§!"
AES_fascism_hidden:0 "MRS"
AES_fascism_hidden_long:0 "Maregyptian Revival Society     §gThe MRS is a newer party in Aestlonia. One with seemingly no connections to the established political order of the nation. The party prides itself in following the teachings, morals, and culture of the original Maregyptian settlers. Their leader, Alter Tähenduses, is not unknown in the political circle. Once being the founder and head of the Kapitali Finance Center, where she used to work directly with the previous princess before being kicked out of the Center due to suspicions of embezzlement, someone you could hardly call a religious nationalist personality. Due to this, most look to the party with concern, not being fully sure of what it truly represents or who's backing it from behind the shadows.§!"
AES_kelpie_party:0 "The Triune"
AES_kelpie_party_long:0 "The Triune     §gNew Coltlantis isn't ruled like the lands above, instead the monarch doesn't truly hold any real power over the general population, instead the 3 main kelpie races have their own community leaders who must come to some sort of agreement before any big choice is made. However, it is likely this will change considering the new political situation.§!"
AES_neutral_coup:0 "NUP"
AES_neutral_coup_long:0 "National Unity Party     §gEven if politically neutral in the past, the Aestlonian Army had to reimagine themselves into something of a political bloc after Golden Sayif launched the "Glorious Coup". The so-called party is nothing more than the political body for the military and Sayif. Their policies being decided by the marshal and her alone.§!"
AES_democratic_republican:0 "TBT-R"
AES_democratic_republican_long:0 "Towards a Better Tomorrow-Republicans     §gThe influence and popularity of the TBT couldn't be killed by a simple coup, and this is shown by their newest iteration. Republicans always existed within the party, but after recent events their notoriety has only increased, leading to them and their leader, Snow Qalam, being given majority control over the party. They follow the same harmonic principles of the past, but now with a bigger focus in perfecting harmony as a concept.§!"
AES_communism_republican_long:0 "Aestlonian General-Workers Union     §gAfter Zaida's actions in the Karkdannistan conflict and the following declaration of the republic, the famously monarchist Steel Raud decided it would be best to step down and instead give control of the union to her number 2. That being the zebra known as Amza Outtara, an ex-slave of the Mazwi Empire that found refuge in Aestlonia after the collapse of the same. Her policies are much like Raud's, a very soft approach to socialism, but with a much more "utopic" way of going about it when compared to Raud's realism.§!"
AES_democratic_aesgypt:0 "Maregypt Clique"
AES_democratic_aesgypt_long:0 "Maregypt Clique     §gAt one point it was just a term used to refer to Princess Ntrôm's royal line, but as of now it became the name adopted for the "party" that formed around the Princess and her ideals. Ntrôm and the greater movement support a careful return to Maregyptian traditions, without ever forgetting the importance of harmony and the cultures that formed in Aestlonia.§!"
AES_neutrality_aesgypt:0 "Aesgyptian Movement"
AES_neutrality_aesgypt_long:0 "Aesgyptian Movement     §gOnce led by Princess Ntrôm the Movement finds itself being under the leadership of Prince Pikhimphe, Ntrôm's brother. The Movement defends a radical shift from Aestlonian culture to something more akin to what the original Maregyptian settlers used to have. The Movement is not shy about their dislike of the customs that have formed over time, claiming that these are unworthy mutations of the original ones, and that Aestlonia should work to become pure again.§!"

The Red Crown is led by Princess Lumi, who has said in multiple occassions that she would gladly give up her title in her fight to serve the people.§!"
AES_vastik_party:0 "RAAC"
AES_vastik_party_long:0 "Reorganized Aestlonian Arabian Congress     §gThe Aestlonian Arabian congress seemingly returns from the shadows. Vastik was never a member of the original AAC, but that hasn't stopped the stallion from declaring himself the leader of the "revived" group.§!"
AES_congress_back:0 "RAAC-L"
AES_congress_back_long:0 "Reorganized Aestlonian Arabian Congress - Liberals    §gThe so-called liberal wing of the RAAC is nothing more than a mere ruse, all within this party know very well that their position holds no actual power outside of giving Vastik's government a bit more legitimacy.§!"
AES_snowstorm_party:0 "Scarlet Winds"
AES_snowstorm_party_long:0 "Scarlet Winds     §gIf one thought that the situation in Aestlonia would become better with the death of Storm Alsaqie they should reconsider their assumption. Snowstorm's Scarlet Winds is as extreme as the main cult was, if anything they are even worse to deal with due to their constantly clashing and mutating ideology.§!"

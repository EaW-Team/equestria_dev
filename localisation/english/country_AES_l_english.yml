### Events ###
aestlonia.1.t:0 "The Path Forward"
aestlonia.1.d:0 "##TODO, event about how the path forward might be rough and slow, but it's required considering a Karkad invasion is more obvious day by day, the country can't be in a "political deadlock" anymore, Zaida needs to take stuff in her own hooves if she wants change, even if the parties may not like it."
aestlonia.1.a:0 "Something needs to be done."
aestlonia.2.t:0 "To Tartarus With It"
aestlonia.2.d:0 "##TODO, after some preliminary preparations Zaida declare the National Unity Act as null and void, saying it doesn't count anymore due to changing situations in the country, also saying that later she will decide on what party will help her lead the country once and for all, but only after the approaching war with Karkad is over and the situation has stabilized."
aestlonia.2.a:0 "It's for the sake of our survival."
aestlonia.3.t:0 "The Reaction"
aestlonia.3.d:0 "##TODO, event about the different reactions of the parties to Zaida ripping up the act, the harmonic party doesn't like the fact she did it without a proper voting, but they do support the fact it was removed, the communist party, that being the union, fully supports the decision and wishes it had been done sooner, a similar sentiment is shared by the army leadership. The supremacists, being the Millenary Path, react very poorly to the news and announce that they will be doing everything in their power to oppose this decision, fearing that their safety and influence in the government might have it's days counted."
aestlonia.3.a:0 "So be it."
aestlonia.4.t:0 "A Meeting With the Marshal"
aestlonia.4.d:0 "##TODO, event about Golden Sayif laying out a few emergency reforms necessary to the army, making a point in saying that Aestlonia doesn't have much time to prepare and that the incoming war probably won't last long, bet it ending on a victory or not, so the princess should be mindful when deciding in what to invest in, as when the war is over it's unlikely the political factions will allow her this much freedom again. Golden also not so subtlety tells Zaida not to work with the cultists."
aestlonia.4.a:0 "Noted."
aestlonia.5.t:0 "The Choice of War Policy"
aestlonia.5.d:0 "##TODO, event related to the aestlonia.4 one, the meeting continues and now Golden asks Zaida if she prefers to dig in and wait, which is something Golden suggests, or, if she wants to strike first."
aestlonia.5.a:0 "We're not warmongers."
aestlonia.5.b:0 "Best to act while they're still weak."
aestlonia.6.t:0 "Meeting the Newbies"
aestlonia.6.d:0 "##TODO, event about Golden Sayif, the field marshal, meeting the new recruits, they're very badly trained and can barely do anything, leading to Golden having to shout them out to get them to follow her lead and respect her, a smile creeping on her face as they lose all their bravado, she already planning many painful exercises for all of them out in the cold. This event is after the player picks the focus of getting more manpower but at the cost of worse standards."
aestlonia.6.a:0 ""I'm going to have fun "training" you all.""
aestlonia.7.t:0 "An Army to be Proud Of"
aestlonia.7.d:0 "##TODO, event about Golden Sayif, the field marshal, meeting with some professionaly-trained soldiers, she's quite impressed by their form and their knowledge, even if she doesn't really show it. But is a little worried about their small amount, not being sure if this will be enough to beat back Karkad."
aestlonia.7.a:0 "Tricky situation."
aestlonia.8.t:0 "Meeting With Raud"
aestlonia.8.d:0 "##TODO, event about Zaida meeting with the leader of the national workers union, Steel Raud, and thanking her for the help she's providing for the war effort against Karkad in the way of some miner militias. Raud doesn't talk much, she is pretty cryptic and silent, also slightly imposing due to her size, but in the end it's clear Raud likes Zaida and wishes to work together with her in the future. If the opportunity presents itself."
aestlonia.8.a:0 "Friendship sure is great."

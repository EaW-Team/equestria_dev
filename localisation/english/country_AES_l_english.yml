### Ideas ###
AES_unity_act_spirit:0 "National Unity Act"
AES_unity_act_spirit_desc:0 "The National Unity Act was signed after the tumultuous period of the Storm King and subsequent Karkadannistan invasions of Aestlonia. Its primary goal was to unite the country and facilitate its reconstruction. To achieve this, the Act formalized proper political parties, while also granting representation and power to the Millenary Path. This was intended to ensure that all factions had a say in the country's governance in exchange for their cooperation.\n\nWhile the Act accelerated Aestlonia's recovery from the war, it now poses an obstacle to further political and economic reforms. The structure it established has led to a perpetual political standstill, as parties rarely reach full agreement on any reform."
AES_aestlonia_identity:0 "Aestlonian Identity"
AES_aestlonia_identity_desc:0 "From the great migration, to the wrath of the cultists, the rule of the Arabians and now independence. Our great nation has endured a lot. With carefully planned reforms and programs, a new wave of nationalistic fervor has risen amongst our people who identify first as Aestlonian."
AES_ajloun_batallion:0 "Legacy of the Ajloun Brigade"
AES_ajloun_batallion_desc:0 "Formed in the sixth century after the formation of the Governorate of Hestraya, the Ajloun Brigade were a reaction to the resurgence of cultist attacks upon the civilian population of the region. While one out of many such groups, it was the most well known and has a rich and storied history of protecting the weak; something that it carries out even to this day.\n\nHowever, as much as it has been a boon to the people, the archaic organization of such groups cannot stand against the armies of nations today. While how far should our modernization efforts go remains in question, no one can doubt that the current militias are very much out of date."
AES_equipment_bad_standards:0 "Lowered Production Standards"
AES_equipment_bad_standards_desc:0 "The quality of our products are being lessened, in the hopes of keeping pace with our military's needs and requirements. While not as lethal as they should be, the weapons produced are still no less deadly."
AES_equipment_bad_standards_v2:0 "Optimized System"
AES_equipment_bad_standards_v2_desc:0 "Our factories have worked tirelessly, managing to work out a system to efficiently hammer out equipment without compromising on its quality and still delivering on time."
AES_production_complex_idea:0 "National Production Complex"
AES_production_complex_idea_desc:0 "With the choice of focusing over an organized industrial basis that produces high quality weaponry, the guilds of our nation are steadily transformed into a production complex that fulfills the needs of our army. Grey smoke stacks fill the skylines of the capital in contrast to the blue-white panorama of our winters, and factories aplenty churn out the tools to protect our sovereignty; with more being built on the horizon."
AES_production_complex_idea_v2:0 "The Fires of Industry"
AES_production_complex_idea_v2_desc:0 "With sufficient coordination, planning and provisions from the crown, the once few factories that dotted our nation are now turned into vast industrial complexes. Investment is high, opportunities are plentiful and employment even more so; leading to a boom in the development of our country. The fires of these modern-day forges burn red hot, running strong even in the bleak midwinter, to provide Aestlonia with its needs."
AES_karkad_war_buffs:0 "Never Again"
AES_karkad_war_buffs_desc:0 "##TODO, We might have once lost to Karkadannistan, but this mistake will not repeat. We are fully committed to safeguard our freedom, we have learnt from the past and we're still here to say it proudly: "Aestlonia shall be free!""
AES_3_plus_1_languages:0 "3+1 Issue"
AES_3_plus_1_languages_desc:0 "Made up of many communities of different cultural backgrounds, the Aestlonian nation is home to a diverse population that speaks 3 different languages. To make matters worse, after the Arabians imposed their rule upon the region, their own language was introduced as the "universal" language which was used to draft official documents and records. Centuries later, this poses a hurdle for the nation where Arabian communities (while a significant minority) constitute a small percentage of the population; most of which are not versed in their language."
AES_3_plus_1_languages_v2:0 "Slowly Forming Identity"
AES_3_plus_1_languages_v2_desc:0 "For centuries, the communities of Aestlonia have not had the opportunity to take a breather and appreciate the diversity of culture and languages of their nation. Now, with recent efforts undertaken by the Princess, work is being done on forging a nascent Aestlonian identity."
AES_army_language_spirit:0 "Army Language"
AES_army_language_spirit_desc:0 "The various languages, once a major hindrance to a unified cultural zeitgeist, has allowed our armed corps to communicate in a unique manner unseen in any other nation's armed forces and has helped foster a closer understanding of the different cultures inhabiting our nation; leading to a bond over shared heritage and belonging."
AES_the_evil_pact:0 "Lumetorm Pact"
AES_the_evil_pact_desc:0 "##TODO, with the temporary pact officialized the cultist have gotten a lot more influence over the Aestlonian government. But, at least, the cultists might start joining the army."
AES_windigo_spirit_preparationtree:0 "Warriors of the Ice Spirits"
AES_windigo_spirit_preparationtree_desc:0 "##TODO, The cultists have created this whole concept around the Windigos, one that has started to resonate even with part of our army. People are now doing near to fully suicidal missions and acts in name of the spirits."
AES_for_harmony:0 "Fighting for Harmony"
AES_for_harmony_desc:0 "##TODO, we're not fighting because we want war, we're fighting simply to protect what's ours. They started this fire, not us. If they want a fight, they will have one. But we won't forget our principles."
AES_ponykind_volunteers:0 "Pony Volunteers"
AES_ponykind_volunteers_desc:0 "##TODO, all over pony nations our call has been heard. One of resistance against a foreign enslaving enemy that wants to destroy our lands and people.

AES_arab_volunteers:0 "Arabian Volunteers"
AES_arab_volunteers_desc:0 "##TODO, our righteous message was able to convince quite a few of the horses of Arabia and beyond to fight for our cause. Not only are they helping us by holding our frontlines but they're also providing much of their advanced knowledge."

AES_worker_support_desc:0 "##TODO, with the union on our side our production complex can only get better."

AES_arab_resentment:0 "In Limbo"
AES_arab_resentment_desc:0 "##TODO, after recent events the considerably sized Arabian community has been left in a state of limbo due to Zaida's push to create a more "native" Aestlonian identity. The state now needs to decide if it will try to adopt this culture back into the new cultural framework in some way or if it will work to phase it out."

### Army coup/Republic ideas###

AES_new_regime_desc:0 "##TODO, with the establishment of the republic many political and social groups have become agitated and even enthusiastic to take part in the new regime.

Politics are messier than ever and it might be hard to hold onto our popularity in the future as the people demand a true Republic."
AES_recognition_no:0 "Diplomatic Isolation"
AES_recognition_no_desc:0 "##TODO, even if Aestlonia wasn't known for it's web of diplomatic and trade partners, we still had something to fall back on.

AES_liberal_approach:0 "Liberal Approach"

AES_internal_security_desc:0 "Our people are no strangers to conflicts, particularly with errant cultist harassments.

AES_moving_in_the_dark_new_desc:0 "The cultists say that they have a special connection with the land, but this is mystical hogwash. Our miners, however, learned the woods and the caves of the wilds by sweat and blood. Furthermore, they are experts at operating in low visibility. We will find this hard-gained knowledge a real use."

AES_here_comes_the_fire_desc:0 "Explosives are a big part of the mining arsenal. Explosives are also a great tool of war. By putting these two simple facts together, we shall get some spectacular welcome for anyone foolish enough to pick up a fight with our lads and lasses!"

AES_settling_down:0 "Settling Down"
AES_settling_down_desc:0 "The Aestlonian Provisional Army was always meant to be a temporary organization. A haphazard formation of former militia brigades and cultist patriots, it serves no function now that the threat of invasion is quelled.

AES_path_to_recognition_desc:0 "Being alone in the corner of the world has not always worked out for our benefit. To survive in today's world means forming beneficial connections.

AES_updating_the_paperwork:0 "Updating the Paperwork"
AES_updating_the_paperwork_desc:0 "No proper administration can function without a solid bureaucratic foundation.

AES_the_everlasting_harmonists_desc:0 "For a century, it has been harmony that has kept together the framework of our nation.

It would be politically unwise to reject and ignore them."
AES_give_leniency:0 "Give Leniency"
AES_give_leniency_desc:0 "In order to show that we are truly behind the workers of our nation, it is prudent we relax some of our interim laws in order to let the AGWU truly carry out their operations.

AES_the_so_called_nationalists_desc:0 "A relatively young party in our political sphere that supports reconnecting with old Maregyptian ideals and faith, led by an alleged embezzler and rumored to be connected to the cultists, the MRS is an unconventional choice to support.

AES_revive_the_old:0 "Ancient Connections"
AES_revive_the_old_desc:0 "One of the main tenets of the MRP is reconnecting with our ancient Maregyptian heritage. While we mainly agree to this in order to secure their support, having a connected past heritage every Aestlonian can agree on can help in creating more unity in our society."

AES_lighten_ecomonic_woes:0 "Rescue the People"
AES_lighten_ecomonic_woes_desc:0 "The war brought massive economical turmoil to the nation, partly due to Zaida's reckless war gambit. If the republic is to survive before it crashes and burns even before it gets off the ground, we need to work on setting out this fire as soon as we can."
AES_status_of_arab_culture:0 "A Fourth Pillar"
AES_status_of_arab_culture_desc:0 "The Arabians were once the conquerors of Hestraya, now they are simply relegated to certain communities around the nation unsure of their future in our beloved nation.

AES_the_fire_controlled:0 "The Fire Controlled"
AES_the_fire_controlled_desc:0 "An army is not an organization made for ruling. But it is one that excels in leading and stabilizing.

AES_revive_neighyar_culture_desc:0 "The Karkad occupation wiped a lot of Néiyar history and culture from the region. As one of the three main cultures that make up our nation, this injustice cannot be let go. We must launch an effort to breathe life into the ways of our Néiyar people."

AES_a_country_of_heroes_desc:0 "##TODO, although promises for greater representation were made during the initial coup we will have to slightly change our tune.

AES_the_final_blow_desc:0 "##TODO, the cultists were already greatly weakened by our previous actions, but their leader and the high-ranking minions are still out there. In the name of public safety we need to finally end this great pest of a group."
AES_travelling_caravans:0 "Liberating Caravans"
AES_travelling_caravans_desc:0 "##TODO, they say that knowledge liberates, and that much we have to agree with, a reason the cultists had gotten so many members recently was due to their exploitation of vulnerable communities who didn't know any better. To combat this we will start sending book caravans all over the more lacking areas of the country, even bringing some rifles along to teach them how to defend themselves in the future."
AES_politicize_the_army:0 "Politicize the Army"
AES_politicize_the_army_desc:0 "##TODO, being apolotical isn't a sign of modernity for an army, it's a sign of complicity.

AES_total_separation:0 "Total Separation"
AES_total_separation_desc:0 "##TODO, from all the times it was tried, mixing army and politics simply didn't work out. With this in mind, we will protocol a complete separation of the armed forces from the political body of the nation.

AES_union_integration:0 "Union Integration"
AES_union_integration_desc:0 "##TODO, the AGWU isn't like your typical group of "socialists", instead it does seem that they truly care for the workers that they claim to represent, even going as far as cooperating with a non-aligned government.

AES_forged_by_war:0 "Forged by War"
AES_forged_by_war_desc:0 "##TODO, recent years haven't been kind to Aestlonia, our people have been forged and reshaped by the plight of war.

AES_dealing_with_the_mrs_desc:0 "##TODO, the so-called Revival Party is nothing more than a clear attempt by the cultist to gain power over the country in a less violent way. We might have allowed their existence when the republic was still unstable, but now it's time to put an end to the charade."

AES_soldier_councils_desc:0 "##TODO, what does a farmer or city worker know about what our nation needs?

AES_found_the_civilian_wing_desc:0 "##TODO, it would be an unwise idea to attempt to form our rule in a pure military-presenting way, this would certainly turn people away from our government and perhaps even mark the start of it's downfall. Instead we should allow the formation of a congress, one where a smaller "civilian wing" of the NUP will oppose a few of the projects being passed, with some even being designed to fail, in order to emulate diverging opinions."
AES_securing_our_existence:0 "Securing Our Existence"
AES_securing_our_existence_desc:0 "##TODO, the threats from within might have been defeated, but this does not mean that we are safe. There are still unfriendly or unworthy nations that border us and spell future danger to our existence. It would be a good idea to strike them now."
AES_the_naive_north:0 "The Naive North"
AES_the_naive_north_desc:0 "##TODO, Maretonia has fallen to the classic harmonic fallacy that once even included us.

aestlonia.1.t:0 "The Path Forward"
aestlonia.1.d:0 "From the icy south wastes to the towering northern mountains, from the kelpie-styled docks of Zarmarej to the weary spires of Ajloun, the whispers of change could be heard in every corner of Aestlonia. Indeed, many ponies believed in them and eagerly carried the words about transformation further on, while some were brave enough to act upon these murmurs, bringing their own vision for the country closer to reality. Still, for now, there was only one creature whose ambition to shift the realm matched their capabilities to do so.\n\nPrincess Zaida paced across her private study impatiently. Whereas her late mother, Princess Rawiya, second of the name, spent a lot of time in the audience chambers, hosting various factions and balancing their expectations, the young ruler had quickly lost any faith in the process of holding an all-pleasing court. In her eyes, the political forces across the Advisory Council were abusing the National Unity Act to focus on their petty problems, burying truly important issues under worthless squabbles. Even the growing threat of Karkadannistani invasion, one promising the very end of their proud nation, was not enough to resolve the constant state of deadlock.\n\nStopping in front of a large window, Zaida pulled the heavy curtains to the sides, allowing in the cold bright sun. The view of her beloved city calmed the princess somewhat, sharpening her focus and tempering her frustration into determination. As always, she needed to act on her own, charting the new course with a sure hoof no matter how rough the coming storm was shaping up to be."
aestlonia.1.a:0 "Emergency royal decrees were drafted shortly."
aestlonia.2.t:0 "Reign and Rein"
aestlonia.2.d:0 "As the heiress apparent, Zaida had experienced an upbringing entirely devoted to the duties and best practices of an enlightened leader. Although the lessons she learned so diligently turned out to be needed much sooner than she had expected, the princess used this core knowledge with great confidence over the last few years.\n\nAmong the different subjects, history had been one of her favorites. There was something especially fascinating and profound to be observed in the rise and fall of the great powers of the world, be it the now obvious collapse of Sa'adles or Grovers, or the smaller signs of decadence seen in the mighty Equestria, promising it a similar path. From where Zaida was standing, all of these examples of decline had common symptoms: bloated bureaucracy, neglected military, technological stagnation, and harmful deference to the traditions. \n\nWith the recent edicts, she did everything to combat the spread of the former three ailments inside of Aestlonia, at least everything possible in the current legal framework. Nonetheless, this was clearly not enough to ensure the survival of the country, and the biggest barrier preventing future reforms became painfully obvious. The princess felt no joy in tearing down her mother's legacy, but she could not afford to delay the next steps any longer, and so, after a short deliberation within the inner circle of the court, a new order was released, one to become a title of many front pages and a top point for many debates."
aestlonia.2.a:0 ""By royal will, National Unity Act is null and void.""
aestlonia.3.t:0 "The Reaction"
aestlonia.3.d:0 "Winter Qalam held little doubt that the present session of the Advisory Council was the most dynamic in the last few months, perhaps even since the coronation of Zaida. Naturally, their gracious ruler was the reason for this perturbation too.\n\n"To sum up, no offense to all the fine folks here, these meetings were really becoming a drag." Steel Raud, the imposing representative of AGWU, currently occupied the speaker's podium. "Her majesty is not only well within her rights to change the laws - this is the only way out of our snowdrifts."\n\nThe creatures in the room started clamoring. The wing occupied by Millenary Path was expectedly united in their vocal disapproval, but Winter noticed negative remarks coming from other parties as well, including some members of his own TBT.\n\n"Order in the assembly!" His duties as a chairpony were sure to be tested today, but the realm needed every bit of stability if Zaida's plans were to work. "We have heard the opinion of the Union, and now would like to invite commentary for further discussion. Honorable Snowstorm, we would be grateful if you could present the opinion of your faction."\n\nA pony with mane of red and white - a cultist, even though Winter never liked the term - rose up after silence finally fell down. "Thank you. This... decision enforced by the princess is nothing but regression to the oppressive regime of the past. Not only does she remove the voice from the common Aestlonians, but she also robs them of the chance to defend their traditions, so nobly provided by her late mother..."\n\nThe rest of the sentence was drowned in the rising wave of accusations, jeering and hollers of support. With a sigh, Winter reached for his gavel again."
aestlonia.3.a:0 ""Order! Order, fillies and gentlecolts!""
aestlonia.4.t:0 "Hour Of The Sword"
aestlonia.4.d:0 "No war could be fought without the soldiers, and no soldiers would march without a commander. Luckily, Zaida had no delusions regarding her own military prowess, but the upcoming conflict demanded more than an honest assessment of her capabilities. In order to finalize the development of Aestlonian Provisional Army and ensure that its officers would be fully immersed in the reforms, the top brass was summoned to the royal palace for a series of planning sessions and battle plan elaborations.\n\nField marshal Golden Sayif and her generals arrived promptly, ready and able to contribute to the discussions. While Zaida respected Golden's abilities and accomplishments, as she was sitting in the chamber-turned-headquarters and listening to the officers' presentations, the princess could easily see that it would be a while before the gruff mare would show her any reverence beyond that dictated by the etiquette.\n\n"We are standing at the crossroads, your majesty. As it was explained prior, troop quality and quantity have their merits, and even with your commendable swiftness we do not have time to achieve both." Marshal's voice, trained by thousands of orders, rang crisply across the room. "The final decision is yours, and it would be wise to make it today. Permission to speak freely?"\n\n"Granted." Nodding, Zaida wordlessly wondered whether she could stop her from speaking freely at all.\n\n"The Karkad incursion will be short, one way or the other. After it is over, if Aestlonia stands, the power you have to change it will be curtailed." Golden gave the princess a hardened stare. "Use it well, and remember, when the strife comes, the corruption from within will raise its head too. Do not allow the damned cult to spread its taint with abandon again.""
aestlonia.4.a:0 ""Your... advice is noted, lady marshal.""
aestlonia.6.t:0 "Grind Down, Build Anew"
aestlonia.6.d:0 ""You! Private!" Golden Sayif focused all her attention on a single recruit in the long line, causing him to visibly shake. "How many laps did you make in the allotted time?"\n\n"T-t-ten." The heavy breaths and ample amount of sweat indicated that this was the extent of the stallion's current physical form. Golden had no doubts that a green member of the old Ajloun Brigade would make fifteen with a leisurely trot. Shivering under her heavy gaze still, the unfortunate pony felt a need to add something else. "Y-your highness."\n\nFrom a certain point of view, the marshal felt sorry for this lot. The decision to have enough bodies to properly cover the entire front line with Karkadannistan was strategically sound, but it also meant that the quality of the future defenders of the nation was, as one of the officers tactfully put it, below average. Thus, it fell to Golden to make these pathetic whelps into something presentable.\n\n"YOUR HIGHNESS? You can call a mare you are trying to woo "your highness", though I don't think you have a chance with muscles like that." With every booming word, the recruit seemed to shrink away further and further. "You will call me Marshal Golden, or ma'am. Is. That. Clear?"\n\n"Yes. Marshal Golden. Ma'am." After whispering his answer, the pony winced as laughter from the tail end of the formation reached his ears. Golden, meanwhile, was happy to pounce on the new target.\n\n"Oh, the privates who made less than ten find it funny? Well, all of you can have fun." She raised her voice to the full commanding power, causing everyone to snap to attention immediately. "Five minutes of rest for you all, and another run. All who fail to get twelve make a third attempt. IS THAT CLEAR?""
aestlonia.6.a:0 ""Yes, Marshal Golden, ma'am!""
aestlonia.7.t:0 "Building Upon the Old"
aestlonia.7.d:0 "Golden Sayif had a faint smile on her face, a sight as rare as a hot summer in Aestlonia. In the distance, the enemy dummy stood peppered with a few holes; specifically, three in the chest and two in the head.\n\nFive perfect shots. The shooter himself was crouched beside her, skillfully unloading the breech cartridge and hanging the rifle by his side with a similar proud look on his face. Along the same range, other soldiers and recruits from the old Ajloun Brigade scored similar shots on their targets. In the distance, Golden could hear the reverberating chants of soldiers marching in synchronized steps; their guns hung ready on their shoulders.\n\nThis is what an army should be, she thought. Even if the days of disorganized militias were past, their legacy and experience would still carry on the torch of the nation in battles henceforth. Even so, her thoughts lingered in doubt.\n\nWill it be enough? The enemy was vast and would no doubt outnumber them and their smaller army...\n\n"Marshal Golden!"\n\nTurning to the source of the sound, she saw that all the recruits had finished taking their shots at the targets. Perfect scores, all of them.\n\n"Good shooting, recruits! Keep working this hard and you will be ready for any battle! Now...give me ten laps around the ground in half an hour!" she bellowed.\n\nIt will have to be enough..."
aestlonia.7.a:0 "Professionals have standards."
aestlonia.8.t:0 "Noble and Strong"
aestlonia.8.d:0 "Zaida surely knew how to talk the talk. After all, it was a quality necessary for any politician, and throughout her life Steel Raud saw many ponies of that kind. There was something special about this one, however, a certain quality which all these big-mouthed mares and stallions lacked in. Even now, during their private meeting, when the princess was not perched up on her throne and had to raise her head to meet the gaze of the considerably taller socialist, Zaida carried a presence which simply put her one level higher.\n\n"Once again, I am incredibly thankful for your support, Director. It would hardly be an overstatement that the levels of effort Aestlonians are putting out right now, be it militia service or factory work, are unprecedented and fill my soul with eternal gratitude." The princess bowed slightly.\n\n"It is what they do, Your Majesty. For the country, and, frankly, for you." Returning the gesture, Raud pushed her chair back a bit.\n\nZaida smiled politely, but then sighed and allowed a thoughtful expression to cross her face. "I would be not quite honest if I said I understand these feelings in my heart. Logically, the adoration and the respect for the ruler are natural, but I have never had a similar figure placed above me." Her companion did not interrupt, and so the pensiveness coalesced into determination. "Still, I know that I will do everything in my power to carry the greatness they ascribe to me."\n\n"That’s what all of us do. All we can." Raud remained reserved, but her eyes came alight with a spark of approval. "That’s what I wanted to ask too. More fight to be found in this pony. I want to join the army. If Your Majesty would have me, of course.""
aestlonia.8.a:0 "Her call was heard and accepted. "
aestlonia.9.t:0 "An Encounter to Remember"
aestlonia.9.d:0 "The meeting between villages of different tribes was quite a significant event, organized by local governors with meticulous care. Of course, these big words meant something only for the grown-ups, and while the stallions and mares mingled at the massive culture fair, their children sought their own exchanges.\n\n"Anneli." A filly with a high-pitched voice pointed at herself, mirroring the gesture of a darker colt in a thick cap in front of her. "And you’re called Iuh-hur?"\n\n"It’s Yukhur." While he could understand his own distorted name among the weird sounds the stranger made, most of her words remained a mystery. "I. Come. From. Beyond. Big. Forest."\n\nGathering that the slowed rhythm corresponded to an explanation was easy, but it scarcely helped to understand any of the meaning behind the unfamiliar language. Trying her best to express confusion, Anneli grimaced and chaotically gestured with hooves.\n\nAfter a short deliberation, Yukhur picked up a nearby twig and started tracing lines in the fresh snow. The map he made was quite detailed, with a plethora of triangle trees, a thick line for the river and several boxy houses. Satisfied with the result, the colt added a tiny pony figure next to one of them, and nodded towards it. Recognising the stream, his companion snatched the stick and started adding to the picture. After she finished a similar piece of taiga with a set of more rounded buildings, a spark of mischief flared in her eyes as she reached out to the first half and added a curled hat to its lone inhabitant. Resemblance was passing at best, but Yukhur nodded with approval and answered with his own detail - another pony next to the circles, one with braided mane, just like Anneli."
aestlonia.9.a:0 "They were drawing close."
aestlonia.10.t:0 "A New Page"
aestlonia.10.d:0 "Dissolving the National Unity Act was a significant, but entirely political step. Zaida ached for more, for something visible and formed by her own will, not just related to her mother's achievements. Today, she was doing exactly that.\n\n"A historical occurrence, Your Majesty." The ever loyal advisor, Winter Qalam, hovered over her shoulder, reading the document neatly laid out on the table. "It is truly wonderful that recognition of our heritage is not dislodged by other pressing concerns."\n\n"Do you really think so?" Tapping her pen nervously, the princess frowned. "Some would say that it is an empty and vainglorious thing, neither necessary nor timely."\n\n"These voices should be rebuffed steadily and we will answer their cries in a twofold manner. It is a project which has been developed with your supervision by a team of our greatest artists, writers and linguists over several years, hence it has little bearing on current material resources, and there is no better moment to strengthen the soul of a creature, or indeed, the nation, than during a struggle. Your loyal subjects are completely behind you, Your Majesty." The stallion smiled as she made a confident nod and scribbled an ornate signature on the bottom of the last page. For him, there was power in names and words, and today this power was given out evenly, shaping regions, cities, or indeed, their ruler."
aestlonia.10.a:0 ""Let me be first to congratulate you, Princess Zaida Lumesadu.""
aestlonia.11.t:0 "Course Selection"
aestlonia.11.d:0 "With every piece of objective information at hoof and after receiving every possible advice, Princess Zaida had to chart the future course of the realm once more. The attack was coming, and without a reliable plan it would crush Aestlonia in a matter of weeks.\n\nThe sensible option, of course, was to stick with the proven loyalists, TBT or AGWU. By putting the international connections of the former or the popular support of the latter to the forefront of the preparation campaign, reasonable progress could be achieved in the remaining time. Still, what if reasonable was not enough?\n\nA tinge of fear, a speck of desperation, maybe even a shade of dark ambition highlighted another possibility. The cultists of Millenary Path were more than capable fighters, and without the National Unity Act they were turning against the state once more, putting even more pressure on the overextended army. This situation could be reversed, new negotiations initiated, starting a risky bargain with a steep price of success and failure alike."
aestlonia.11.a:0 "This land will not give in to any evil."
aestlonia.11.b:0 "The salvation is worth the cost."
aestlonia.12.t:0 "Things Unsaid"
aestlonia.12.d:0 ""I trust your journey to the capital went well." Despite the softness of palace armchairs, Zaida struggled to sit comfortably. "It is quite appreciated that you were able to do it on such short notice."\n\nA barely visible head motion, which could be counted as a nod only under the most generous interpretation, was the only answer.\n\n"Well. To business then." Glancing to the sides, the princess shifted forward slightly. "I was told that you have brought a final draft of the pertinent agreement?"\n\nThere was a ringing noise of clasp removed, a rustle of paper sheets and finally a soft knock on the table as the documents were placed in front of Zaida. As per the many legal lessons from her younger days, she took time reading every word and measuring their dark implications. Unfortunately, this was exactly the list of measures necessary to save Aestlonia.\n\n"It goes without saying that we expect a very strict reading of the text." She tried to sound assertive. "Millenary Path shall act civilized, exactly as it portrays itself to the outside world, and never as a harmful sect." Since there was no indication of any interruption or comment, Zaida pushed on. "There is also the matter of the ending clause. You and your people need to understand that most of these privileges will be withdrawn after the war, subject to royal review depending on the past circumstances."\n\nStorm Alsaqie remained frozenly still."
aestlonia.12.a:0 "Silence was consent."
aestlonia.13.t:0 "The Ponies Demand Our Surrender"
aestlonia.13.d:0 "We are receiving an offer from behind the front lines. Our enemies "generously" propose to stop their counter-offensive in exchange for "historical territories of Aestlonia and Maretonia" already under their occupation. While accepting this could be humiliating, a peace treaty will give us time to regroup and think through the operation mistakes."
aestlonia.13.a:0 "It is a necessary sacrifice."
aestlonia.13.b:0 "They do not know about the counter-counter-offensive."
aestlonia.14.t:0 "The Horses Refuse to Surrender"

aestlonia.15.t:0 "Prodigal Son"
aestlonia.15.d:0 "A number of Aestlonians have gone to serve as volunteers in the Arabian civil war, all for different reasons. Nonetheless, a surprising proportion of them owes allegiance to the Millenary Path, with rumors regarding their involvement naturally running amok.\n\nIn the case of Vastik Kjaba this notoriety is well deserved. He comes home wearing the title "Butcher of Badimane", bestowed by fellow soldiers in the aftermath of a bloodbath unsightly enough to warrant his expulsion from the conflict. It is no surprise that many eyes are following his return with due apprehension."
aestlonia.15.a:0 "Intelligence and journalists will be all over him in no time."
aestlonia.16.t:0 "Triumph Across South"
aestlonia.16.d:0 "Defying the odds, we have withstood the Karkadannistani threat and greatly expanded our reach. However, as peace returns to Hestraya once again, we must see to the resolution of the remaining political entanglements. After all, a war is but one of many dangers which can plunge the nation into turmoil, especially when the common cause has been resolved at last."

aestlonia.17.t:0 "Aestlonia Asks for Support"
aestlonia.17.d:0 "Truly, many see our great nation as the custodian of the ponykind. This fame is well-deserved, and one would be hard-pressed to find an honorable cause of our kin which does not receive some support from us.\n\nStill, there are certain physical limits to the bandwidth of this aid. Thus, when the call for help comes from the southern tip of Zebrica, a snowy land of Aestlonia, we must weigh the possible options. According to their diplomats, the harmony in the region is threatened by Karkadannistan, a rogue state born from the fires of the Storm King reign."

"We were told you wish to pledge yourself to defend Aestlonia."\n\nKabja, infamous cultist, known to the newspapers as Butcher of Badimane and to the intelligence office as an A-class peril, bowed gracefully, with a fluidity of motion rarely seen even in most experienced retainers.\n\n"Your Majesty. I am honored." He spoke with a degree of unexpected deterrence, and even the low whistling undertone - unfortunate consequence of a chipped tooth - did little to detract from it. "You heard right. Once my path brought me back to the struggling homeland, my duty became abundantly clear."\n\n"And why would a veteran such as you choose to return to the front lines so soon?" The haughty curiosity of the question waned slightly when Zaida met Kabja's gaze, noticing a flicker of something dark behind his focused eyes.\n\n"Three reasons, Your Majesty. First is duty, as I've said. Second, I take pride in my talent for war" Stressing the last word, the stallion tapped the ground firmly. "Third, just like you, I carry the blood of Arabia. It is the nature of our people to fight for a cause, fight no matter the odds, be it on a battlefield, or, indeed, in a palace."\n\nThe compliment was sincere, but it did little to put Zaida at ease."

aestlonia.25.d:0 "Becoming a pioneer for the new wilderness survival program sounded quite prestigious, and sergeant Shiver Drift had been eager to prove that his training and discipline would conquer every possible obstacle. Now, properly stuck in the middle of a frozen forest with nothing but a thick overcoat and a heavily scratched spade, he was ready to reconsider. Tellingly, the fact that he was not alone out here made the situation even more unbearable.\n\n"Come on, sergeant. Shelter-making should be easy for such an accomplished officer. Use that big head of yours." One of his new instructors snickered and tapped her hoof. Unlike Shiver, she seemed right at home here in the tundra, among the elements and strange creature sounds.\n\nHe sighed. They had given him a tool for digging, so it would make sense to dig. Putting all his weight into the strike, Shiver brought the spade down to the frigid ground with a loud clang. The resulting dent was miserably small.\n\n"Sister, look! He actually went for it." The other teacher made a guffawing noise. "Go on, continue. If you try hard enough, your dead body will appreciate the shallow grave."\n\n"I'm sorry, this does require a bit more folk wisdom than marching on a parade." Moving leisurely, the first mare approached Shiver, who felt too embarrassed to provide a retort. "Shovelling will get you nowhere even in the summer. Watch closely. These marks come from the bark of the tree - the best way to start a shelter is to fell one."\n\n"So get chopping. We are going to pray, and when we come back you'd better make some progress." After flashing condescending smirks, both cultists moved out, leaving Shiver by himself."

aestlonia.26.d:0 ""So know this well, brothers and sisters! When the war comes, our enemies will find an avalanche unleashed!" Snowstorm, prominent Millenary Path speaker, paced the podium energetically, her words building up into a resonating crescendo. Of course, the acoustic qualities of this hogwash were of little interest to Golden Sayif. Even though she booked one of the best spots in the room, the marshal cared only for the ending of the speech, when the damned cultist would stop for a bow, or a salute, or whatever passed for a farewell in their rotten cohorts.\n\n"We shall form this avalanche out of steel and flesh! And with our strength carried by the mighty wind of hatred, we shall destroy any and all who oppose us, and feed the lands with their ashes and blood. For we are chosen of a higher power, harbingers of a greater destiny!" The critical moment was approaching rapidly. Golden took a deep sigh, focusing on the position of her mark and the weight of the concealed pistol.\n\n"Ours is the sacrifice, but ours shall be the eternal glory!" At last, Snowstorm took the final step, she was standing still and observing the audience, but something in the response caused the marshal's instinct to halt the plan. Golden expected approval from members of the sect, but the chamber was full of other ponies, civilian or even military ones, who stomped and cheered with the same insane passion. Leaning back in exasperation, she refined this fact into a dreadful realization: it was too late for a surgical strike, and worse..."
aestlonia.26.a:0 "...to save Aestlonia from madness, Zaida had to go."
aestlonia.27.t:0 "Choosing a Favorite"
aestlonia.27.d:0 "With the unsavory option of allowing the Millenary Path to corrupt the armed forces firmly off the table, Zaida had arrived at another crossroads. Despite the willingness of TBT and AGWU to cooperate on most issues, their leadership proposed radically different approaches to the finer details of war preparation.\n\nIn particular, the former devised a plan focused on diplomacy play, doubling down on help from Equestria both in personnel and equipment. The latter, meanwhile, advised an internal restructuration, counting on the capacity of the worker class to produce weapons and hooves to wield them. Since mixing and matching such distinct ideas was clearly ill-fortuned due to the time constraints, the princess had to settle on a single way forward."

aestlonia.28.d:0 "The numbers in the military reports gave Zaida a sense of impressive scale for the machine of state at her beck and call, but this power was somehow ephemeral, detached from reality. As she was walking along the line of the newly formed royal guard regiment, the princess felt rather differently. These ponies would soon become another marker on the map of the frontline, but here and now they were flesh and blood, ready to fight and to die, to do their duty to the state - duty to her.\n\nHer thoughts wandered across their fates, while her eyes examined their faces. This one, for instance, a stallion with a streak of red mane sticking from under his cap and a chiseled jaw - what would come of him? Feeling the royal attention, the recruit saluted and Zaida nodded back.\n\n"Anything of particular interest to Your Majesty?" The colonel assigned to the force, a grizzled veteran, posed the question with reverence and a subtle hint of worry, ready to pounce on the source of the problem.\n\n"Yes, actually. I want to give the soldiers a speech." Driven by a sudden, deep impulse, Zaida took a step back. After the officer obediently commanded for attention and hundreds of heads turned to catch her every word, she started to speak, loudly and passionately.\n\n"Sons and daughters of Aestlonia! Today, you honor your homes, your ancestors, your princess! Know this: our struggle, the one you have bravely joined in the most perilous role, is righteous. You, noble warriors, carry my colors into the battle, and my heart is filled with confidence - these soldiers will not let me down. Victory will be ours!" When she was done, a cry of many voices rallied the ranks."

aestlonia.29.d:0 "Even though she had repealed the National Unity Act, Zaida did not underestimate the power held by the TBT and AGWU. By bringing the chairponies of the two parties together and convincing them to make a joint declaration, the princess expected to cement the popularity of the wartime government.\n\n"Friends, kin, fellows and neighbors! Our country faces a monumental danger. It will take a great effort to overcome it, but overcome it we shall." Winter Qalam's voice echoed over the audience eager to catch his every word. "No matter the belief or political cause, it is time to reach out to our brothers and sisters and rise up as an unbreakable bulwark against the invasion." The stallion nodded to his larger companion, inviting her to take over.\n\n"It is just so." Steel Raud spoke slower, simpler, but with the same underlying intent. "We will fight, and we will win. For we are made of harder stuff, for we are protecting the lives and the lands we cherish. Rich or poor, one tribe or another, city dweller or village folk - all can help, will help."\n\nFinally, the princess herself took a step forward. As she raised her hoof, the excited crowd swiftly fell silent. "Today I stand between two great champions of our nation. Soon, I will be leading a thousand times more, creatures both mighty and proud. Know this: the accord reached here and now will be the everlasting bond, one which we will all take strength from, be it in the struggle or in the glorious peace afterwards." Looking around, Zaida could easily see the planted seeds of success. Hundreds of her devoted subjects were ready to spread the true message, one which she carried with passion and one turned into a battle-cry by the unleashed crowd."

The polite, patient tone of his aide only made port overseer Tiidrik more irritated.\n\n"You'd do well to listen to the young lad." Flicking ash off her cigarette, the mare in front of him tilted her head. "Me and my friends have better things to do than traveling across the seas and pulling practical jokes on harbormasters."\n\n"Listen, Miss..." Under a dozen intense stares from the aforementioned friends, a group of ponies in matching uniforms huddled behind their leader, Tiidrik hastened to correct himself. "I meant, Sergeant Foam. There are proper rules and regulations. Due to the current situation. I cannot allow a fully-loaded military transport to..."\n\n"Afraid to say you've got it all wrong. We are not a military transport." Foam grinned widely. "Just a shared interest group with a strong theme and a thing for tourism."\n\nBefore the overseer had a chance to question this dubious claim, a shout came from the communications room of his patrol ship. "They've got an all clear from the Ajloun headquarters, sir! Also multiple requests for docking inbound!" The latter comment was rather superfluous, as looking down towards the horizon Tiidrik could discern at least ten more vessels which were approaching at a steady pace. Suddenly, everything about this bizarre incident clicked inside of his head."

However, unlike the strikes which he organized back when his mane was black instead of gray and lungs had less dust in them, this was decidedly not an anti-government protest.\n\n"What is the meaning of this gathering?" A round helmet and a pair of darting eyes were the only parts of the officer who addressed the workers from beyond the barricades of the military outpost. Glancing at the crowd, minding its size in particular, Merle could guess the source of the apprehension pretty easily. "It is my duty to inform you that public actions are..."\n\n"Comrades!" One of the younger miners operated the loudhailer, a stout mare with a voice still capable of ringing sonorously. "No cause for alarm! We want to talk to the big brass in the capital, and since you have a direct line to them, here we are."\n\nThe soldier's head disappeared for a minute, before popping right back, a bit higher than before. "This is hardly a standard procedure!" Of course, this fact was known to Merle too, but he had learnt the value of action over red tape long ago. The captain leaned closer to the speaker.\n\n"Tell them we're here to fight for our country. Tell them the creatures of Aestlonia has heard her call." These raspy words of an old patriot were first amplified by the megaphone, then carried over by a winded private straight to his commander, and finally sent across hundreds of kilometers to the capital.

It was only during the private salons set after the major festivities, when the glorified facade of a ruler could be discarded, that she could really enjoy the gathering. Even so, in these troubled times one had to settle for  solace instead of joy.\n\n"It is rather curious, the manner our bloodlines work." The sovereign princess glanced at her noblemare companions. "When a foreign aristocrat has grand ideas for the cultural transformation, or the survival of the state, does it ever end well?"\n\n"Pray tell you do not speak of yourself, cherished cousin." Although Lumi, the head of the ancient family once ruling over Särav Org, was not related to Zaida this closely, such an endearing term was customary in their circles. "You are the one who the nation follows, in hearts and minds alike, the very essence of their kinship."\n\n"They do indeed, but what is the justification of such loyalty? By birth and custom, I am much closer to just another Arabian despot than either you or cousin Ntrôm." Zaida straightened her mane in a slow, melancholic gesture.\n\nThe second mentioned pony bowed slightly and then answered softly, yet with certainty. "Their faith in you binds stronger than any other claim. True, my ancestors fled the Maregypt alongside theirs, and cousin Lumi is also related to the kings of old, but this is not what Aestlonia needs now. You are the princess, their princess, the one who leads them bravely through a terrible tempest. Take this destiny with pride.""

However, there was nothing of the sort to be found inside the mind which devised a daring strike at the corruption in the heart of the nation. Something had to occupy the abandoned position, and the determination, deep-rooted and bitter, proved to be just the right force.\n\nThe transmitter in her hoof felt heavy and cold, like a rifle after a long march. Golden put out the speech notes in front of her, taking aim, and then pulled the proverbial trigger.\n\n"Fellow citizens of Aestlonia. Marshal Golden Sayif speaking. [AES.Capital.GetName] is liberated from the clutches of the Millenary Path. Her former majesty Princess Zaida is under house arrest, and the monarchy is abolished in favor of a republican regime. To that effect, the National Assembly is suspended."\n\nAn intimate knowledge of the city defenses, the cultists' belief in their own invulnerability, a core of loyal soldiers, all the ingredients for a decapitating strike were perfect.

The decently sized Arab community within the nation feels uncertain about the future, most are willing to adapt to whatever is decided by the government, even if it means having to slowly let go of their old culture, but no real decision was made about their fate.

This will not only impact her personal life, but also the destiny of the nation and her people as a whole. The Princess feels more nervous than ever to have to make this decision, in a perfect world there would be a way to side with both, but it is clear that due to status quo disturbment brought by her sudden changes some months prior that things will have to be different, the political field is more unstable than it ever was before and the people just need a more united clear governance that they can get behind.

Some of the movement's most idealistic members even talk about retaking the "motherland" and abandoning entirely Hestraya in the process, as for them Hestraya should be treated as nothing more than a temporary refuge, for these and other goals they say that Zaida shouldn't restore greater civilian governance, as that's the way that the monarchs used to rule. This, of course, would be a very unpopular choice with our population, it would even anger the TBT itself, as they barely consider the movement as part of their party, specially since the Movement has been working to establish their own party in the past weeks. The safest bet would be to stick with the most popular side of the party, being the one led by Winter Qalam, someone who has shown his loyalty to harmony, monarchy, and nation during most of his life.

Royal first takes it as a joke before saying he won't do it. Sayif says she doesn't care if he wants it or not, since, as she notes, she has info that he planned to coup her, and if he doesn't change that name she will act upon this information.

Soon this new teacher starts talking about how crucial it is to know about the position of the army in the politics of the nation, this teacher points to the low-ranking pony and asks him what this position is. The pony scoffs as this one is easy, he says that the army shouldn't mess with the politics of a nation, that was day 1 stuff, to always be neutral and to always defend the country no matter what. The teacher quite loudly says that he is wrong and that is this type of thinking that allows for cowards and psychos to come to power as the army will always protect them. The teacher tells the pony to study more, specifically the new material that was introduced into the camp.

In this event we see army ponies marching down a popular street in a big Aestlonia town, even dragging some artillery pieces wit them.

It made the usually cold mare feel warm inside as she knew that used to be Zaida's dream, yet that cultist-lover would have to live with the fact that the pony who's warnings she ignored was the one to do it. She knew she would need to focus on the next step of the plan soon, but there's time for a little gloating with a side of champagne. Champagne is something Sayif never liked, way too fancy for a mare like her, but this one time she would allow herself to enjoy it."

It had been a long time since she was this happy about anything, there is even a little bounce to her step as she trots around the room. The war against the Yetis has started, and that's enough to fully defrost her unfeeling heart. The mare grabs what's left of that bottle of champagne she drank during the unification of Hestraya, she doesn't care for a fancy glass, instead she drinks it from the bottle instead until it's fully empty, all in a single breath. After she's done she throws the bottle at the ground and watches it break. Sayif refuses to stay inside while this is happening, she will go to the frontlines, she doesn't care if she dies in the process of this invasion, since even if she does, she will at least be able to drag some Yetis to the grave with her."

After the victory she was quick to move her administration to the so-called "Rainband", she wants there to be no chance of any Yeti taking this place back any time soon, this means she has to keep a very watchful eye over this cursed place. But that isn't the only reason, a good part of this decision was only because she wanted to show the world she had triumphed, while also further breaking the morale of the Yetis by showing that they had lost to a puny pony and were now "led" by one. Sayif can barely contain her overflowing emotions, she decides it's best to take a walk so she can clear her mind and figure out her next steps from here, these walks are a common thing for her. Some would say that this is a dangerous idea considering where Sayif is now located, but the mare's mind is too fogged by the feeling of victory to realize that."

Sayif is able to put quite the fight against the beast, showing that she isn't a pony to be thrown around, but ultimately loses to him as he simply is more physically strong and tall. Sayif ends up with her back against the ground, the mare closes her eyes and even cracks a bit of a smile, almsot like she's accepting that she fought a fair battle and lost, and now she's getting her just punishment of death. She's now just waiting for the final blow."

She asks what he thinks he is doing by just standing there, she even gives him yet again another clear order to just end their fight by killing her, as it was supposed to be, but the creature just gives his back to her. Sayif gets furious and jumps to her four hooves like she hadn't just been in a fight, telling him to never give his back to her and demands to know what is his deal. This causes the creature to turn his attention towards her and approach the pony, he then pulls out a quite damaged piece of paper that he was hiding under his armor and hands it to Sayif who picks it with a wing. She checks the piece of paper handed to her and soon realizes it is a drawing, pictured in this drawing is the bust of a pony, one with a broken horn and a scar across one of her eyes. Sayif glances over at the Storm Creature, having to strain her neck a bit to be able to make eye contact, she asks who this is and why does it matter, the creature doesn't say a thing. Sayif makes a comment about how the creature doesn't talk much (mostly as a joke for herself in order to break the tension a bit) and therefore decides she will probably need to guess what this means."

aestloniasayif.16.d:0 "##TODO, event following the one before it, she asks if this was one of his victims. This accusation causes the creature to show any kind of "expression" for the first time as he shakes his head. She asks if this was a rebel leader, the creature once again shakes his head as a response. Before she can ask again he simply points at Sayif and then points at the drawing. Sayif then finally connects the points and asks if this pony was some sort of commander, which the creature nods in response. Looking back at the drawing for some help she can't really figure out what armor the pony is wearing, it isn't one she remembers from any country around here, but soon she notices that it is a little similar to what the Storm King's yetis used to wear. Her final question then is if this pony was one of "their own", as in sided with the Storm King, the creature nods once more in a seemingly happy way. Before Sayif can make any more questions the creature simply pats her in the head and leaves, leaving the marshal a bit confused, but feeling a little inspired."

aestloniasayif.17.d:0 "##TODO, before arriving at the Stormlands, Sayif had the idea she would just "wipe out" the yetis once she got to the point she finds herself now, but now she sees that it might not have been the best plan ever, there's simply no way she would be able to hunt down every Yeti to ever live in these lands, specially not before her little occupation government collapses and she is forced to return to Hestraya with her tail between her hindlegs. Instead she ponders back to the past encounter with that Storm Creature, bringing out the drawing of that pony once again from a internal pocket of her coat, she having kept it there ever since the encounter. Sayif stares at the drawing for a bit and thinks once more about the concept of a pony leading Yetis, maybe she could try to play a little nicer and lead these creatures? Maybe with her leadership she could direct their destructive potential into something better, something more. Sure, this clearly wasn't her original mission and the boys back at Hestraya might get mad at her slipping a bit into supremacy and yeti-tolerance, but she is the president and the marshal, only her opinion matters."

She walks near the shoreline of the beach, at first she doesn't see anything for a long time and even thinks about heading back home before anybody sees her there, this certainly is no proper conduct for a princess. But, out of nowhere she begins hearing this calming melody coming out of a shallow part of the ocean, her body naturally begins trotting towards it, like she's in a trance, the water near the source of the noise is moving in a gentle but non-natural way.

The Kelpie properly introduces herself to Zaida, the queen also notes that she hasn't been in Aestlonia for a few good years.

Zaida takes a bit to agree to the offer, it is quite the extreme shift to something completely different when it comes to internal policy, it would shake up everything within Aestlonia and certainly destroy the already weakened status quo. Which is something that she quickly realizes she wants, she wants to forge her own path, not to follow the TBT's or AGWU's line, and this is how she will do it."

### Character Descs
AES_storm_alsaqie_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 3rd of September 971, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: It is not unheard of for a former royal guard to return to the court and serve in an honorary position. In the case of Storm Alsaqie, the story is not quite so simple. Officially, she was declared missing in action while patrolling skies over rural territories, only to resurface a few years later. She came back a changed mare, nursed back to health by the Millenary path, and inexplicably arose to lead her saviors. Despite her outward indifference to the past, the tales of her prior interest in the arcane and its connection to the "accident" circulate to this day.\n\nAs the guide of the cult, Storm embraced some of the trappings of modernity, actively inducting into the faith those who would be considered outsiders by the traditionally frontier-oriented believers. This, however, should not be mistaken for a change in the brutal nature of Windigo worshippers, but rather viewed as a convenient tool to spread the influence of their morbid masters.\n\nWith the successful recruitment of several prominent Aestlonians, Storm somewhat withdrew from the public eye, allowing new disciples to deal with mundane issues. Stranger still, the preacher is rarely seen by her followers, and her ice-cold voice joins only a select few ritual chants. Nonetheless, there is no doubt among the initiated regarding her final goal - she shall bring forth the utmost suffering to nourish those who hunger in the dark.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
AES_princess_zaida_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of May 987, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: Destined to become a princess from a very young age, Zaida ascended to the Aestlonian throne after the sudden death of her mother. While many of her subjects demonstrated steadfast loyalty to the new ruler, a vocal minority, including several skeptics from the royal advisory council, expressed doubts regarding her readiness to wield power over the land.\n\nRejecting the cautious option of assuaging their concerns, Zaida endeavors to take a more proactive and assertive approach to governance. With the survival of the country being the immediate goal, she seeks radical reforms to awaken Aestlonia from its stagnation and secure the future for years to come. Ultimately, her ambition extends to the creation of a united, powerful Hestrayan nation capable of defeating any threats.\n\nOf course, any bold action requires not only willfulness but also a degree of cunning. By maintaining a harmonious, regal facade and abstaining from bureaucratic or socialite distractions under the guise of utmost diligence, Zaida bides time and builds up strength, determined to surpass her ancestors and show that she is worthy of her title.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Scroup"
AES_winter_qalam_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 3rd of September 962, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: A trusted aide of the late Rawiya II and the chosen mentor of young princess Zaida, a prolific writer, and a celebrated politician - all these honorifics are carried by a single stallion named Winter Qalam. As the current representative of the "Towards a Better Tomorrow" party (or TBT, for short) within the Aestlonian Advisory Council, he strives to be a pillar of harmony in the country.\n\nThis desire is reflected both in his literary works, which promote a sense of unity between all thinking creatures, as well as in a soft-hooved, measured approach to governance. While he does not inspire the same zealous dedication to a single ideal unlike some leaders, and faces some criticism even within his faction, notably from the ardent republicans following his sister, Snow Qalam, Winter's non-confrontational methods and developed acumen provide a basis for cooperation across the ideological spectrum.\n\nIt is worth noting that his moral code is intertwined with and supported by devout belief in Dualism. Along with fellow adherents of this religious movement, Winter seeks to promote the core tenets of Charity and Brotherhood in the everyday lives of those around him, viewing these principles as means to ward off not only the evil in one's soul but also the tangible threat of Windigos.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
AES_golden_sayif_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of Novemeber 979, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: A fierce protector of Aestlonia from threats internal and external alike, field marshal Golden Sayif has not chosen the warrior's lot, but followed it with unbreakable determination. As a young filly, she lost her parents in a Windigo cultist attack, surviving due to the timely intervention of a militia squad. The veteran officer in command chose to adopt the orphan, raising her in strict discipline and sharing his values of honor and duty.\n\nWith this upbringing, the military became a second family to Golden, the only one she truly knew. After formally joining the ranks, she demonstrated impressive prowess and strong leadership skills, quickly climbing the hierarchy of the nascent Aestlonian army. Her resolute ways, pointed political neutrality and hard-earned trust of fellow soldiers made her a natural fit for the commanding position.\n\nHowever, her career only emboldened the deep-seated hatred she had for those who destroyed her life and continued to threaten her homeland. Despite the National Unity Act allowing the so-called Millenary Path to formally participate in governance, Golden watches every move of the cultists even more intensely than before, ready to beat back their corruption with an unrelenting force.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
AES_steel_raud_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of Novemeber 959, Jäised Märed province\n\n§YBiography§!: They say few ponies could portray the essence of the Aestlonian worker as well as Steel Raud. Coming from a remote mining village, she toiled underground for the good of the community from a young age. As the years went by, Raud grew to become remarkably strong and tall, easily towering over most others, and she took every opportunity to use her natural gifts to help those weaker or less fortunate.\n\nWhen the mine ran out and was finally closed, the young mare already got herself a bit of a reputation as a local hero, one always ready to provide support, care, and, indeed, physical assistance. Raud traveled from town to town in search of work for several years, never settling in one place, but meeting many like-minded creatures, especially in the rising socialist movements. By demonstrating a certain talent for management, she directed their energy away from singular acts of charity and into a more potent global action.\n\nFollowing the signing of the National Unity Act and formation of the Aestlonian General-Workers Union, Raud, now famous nationwide was elected as its director in a landslide victory despite any perceived drawbacks, notably including her pro-monarchy position. Under her continued leadership, the Union has been devoted to protecting and uplifting the workers, successfully improving their treatment and conditions to a notable degree.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Moonatik"
AES_cryo_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: Unknown\n\n§YBiography§!: "Mere creatures cannot begin to fathom the thoughts of an ice dragon."\n\nAccidentally found by Princess Zaida during a caving trip, the ice dragon known as Cryo dismissed the terrified pegasus and allowed her escape with indifference, only for her Highness to return days later with a panicking linguist. The ice dragon slowly learned Aestlonian, and these talks soon gave the Princess the idea for an offer.\n\n"He loves military planning," she told her fearful military officers about their newest lieutenant, "And he'll boost recruitment!"\n\nTo Cryo's credit, his strategies conducted in war exercises would merit promotions, but nopony considered convincing him, out of fear or futility, that his "military planning" was mostly logistic coordination.\n\nBeyond the military, the ice dragon cares little for politics and speaks even less of his homeland. One occasion a brave-enough subordinate asked what other ice dragons were like, and Cryo huffed. "I had horns," he snarled icily.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Littlepudel"
AES_alter_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 1st of August 954, Manehattan\n\n§YBiography§!: It would be fair to say that Alter, a scion of the Tähenduses family, prominent in the corporate circles of Manehattan, was expected to show business acumen. However, it quickly proved to be potent enough to put a price on morals, bringing in the extra income at the cost of most prospective partners.\n\nFrustrated with "bleeding-heart sentimentalists", Alter moved for cooler climes of Aestlonia, hoping for fewer regulations and underdeveloped worker rights. While she found those and then some, the whole fiscal situation proved to be too primitive for a real dealer, which did not deter her in the slightest. The self-made mare poured her skills into reshaping the local economic landscape, founding Kapitali Finance Center and even collaborating directly with Rawiya II on market reforms, up to having her hoof in the establishment of the central bank.\n\nDespite initial successes, the venture could be hardly called smooth sailing, especially with the recent scandal disconnecting Alter from her own company due to claims of fund appropriations for personal projects. She has refused to comment publicly on the matter and seemingly took a step back, but money talks, and the whispers bet on her inevitable return.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
AES_snowdrop_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of October 980, Järveääres\n\n§YBiography§!: The geographical location of Aestlonia determines many things, including the specifics of the roles employed by the royal court. In particular, it is the job of a pegasus by the name of Snowdrop to ensure that the weather management corps maintain a perfect balance between freezing, chilly, thawing and plain old cold.\n\nThroughout the years of service Snowdrop has been performing these duties diligently and with quiet pride in her aptitude. She prefers to work at night, when her weakened eyesight is not disturbed by aberrant lights and it is possible to fully focus on the art of wind and frost.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Opalradiance"
AES_kelpie_queen_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: First cycle of 759, New Coltlantis\n\n§YBiography§!: The customs of the underwater folk differ from those of surface-dwellers in many ways. The one who is called the Queen by other kelpies is not a monarch, but rather a symbolic unifying figure, chosen by the three largest tribes in a popular election.\n\nEven though the position came with a certain power to lead negotiations with the outsiders, few expected the Queen to proceed with a large-scale contact with Aestlonians and the ensuing great expansion of the city of Zarmarej. Driven by curiosity and kind-hearted nature, she was quite happy with the outcome and interested in continuing the experiment, yet the threat of the Storm King forced kelpies back to the sea.\n\nAfter his campaign of terror was over, the Queen spent countless hours convincing her kin to attempt another emergence to the strangers above. A compromise had to be made in the end - along with the most perceptive watchers she would observe Aestlonia, reaching out only if the neighbors would prove their moral worth by themselves. Thus, she stands a hopeful vigil, awaiting her chance to truly bridge the two worlds.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Anastafury"
AES_frosty_chisel_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 7th of February 984, Whinnyapolis\n\n§YBiography§!: Passions could carry a willing creature to the strangest places. In the case of Frosty Chisel, an Equestria native and a driven ice sculptor, her inspirations brought her down to Aestlonia, the land of long winters and hardy ponies.\n\nWhile she initially planned only a short stay, the warm welcome at the royal court as well as the amount of cold matter available made Frosty reconsider. By dutifully studying traditional carving techniques under local masters and carefully intertwining them with modern methods and her vision, she has made a bold statement in the craft, creating impressive monuments celebrating friendship and harmony. Now, she stands ready to do much more for her home away from home.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Opalradiance"
AES_tume_koletis_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of December 967, Koolkøn\n\n§YBiography§!: In ancient times, there was only one option to advance through the ranks of the cult which is currently known as Millenary Path - demonstrate unbound fierceness and savagery to garner the favor of the Windigos. While the faithful usually adopt a more reticent approach nowadays, the old ways live on.\n\nTume Koletis belongs to the dark fellowship of creatures proudly carrying them in their hearts. Experienced tracker, well-versed in pack tactics, and honored with the mark of a sacred huntmaster, he possesses an innate understanding of the brutality of war and a fervent desire to put it to use. The soldiers under him will not fight and kill - no, those unfortunate souls shall tear and slaughter their way to whichever goal is given to the bearer of the Crimson Skull.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Blakasmoko"
AES_princess_lumi_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 14th of January 981, Järveääres\n\n§YBiography§!: Despite the great diminishment of Aestlonian aristocracy during Sa'adle rule over the region, many noble families of yore survive to this day. Unsurprisingly, the scions of these bloodlines find themselves the need to adapt to the current realities, and while some are destined to final obscurity, Lumi is renowned across the country.\n\nA distant descendant of the rulers of Särav Org, one among dozens of tribal kingdoms making up ancient Hestraya, she is greatly inspired by the unprecedented cooperation and mutual trust between her ancestors and the common ponies under their guidance. Using her considerable education and social pull, Lumi champions worker rights, collaborating with more open-minded unions. Recently, she has gone so far as to enlist in the army to "fight for her people", resulting in volunteer and donation surges.\n\nAnother passion of hers is preserving the cultural legacy of old Aestlonia. By supporting archeologists and scholars as well as promoting exhibitions and teaching courses, Lumi pushes for greater recognition of this area from the government. With the noticeable successes for both causes, "everycreature's princess" is rumored to be involved in negotiations for an official position at the Ajloun court.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Stardustspix"
AES_pinekabi_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 9th of September 977, Asula Laht\n\n§YBiography§!: Many earth ponies hear the call of nature strongly. For Pinekäbi  this wild song has led him to the darkest depths, but then the very same melody lifted him to the light.\n\nFor a young stallion in rural Aestlonia, especially one with a certain adventurous streak, it was only a matter of time before the true power in the region, the Millenary Path, would take interest in their fate. He was inducted into the faith among many capable colts and fillies, but when faced with its deep macabre secrets, Pinekäbi  abandoned the cult. Fleeing eastward, he took up a remote position of a ranger at the tundra reservations and did his penance by protecting the forests from any threats.\n\nPinekäbi valiantly kept his oath during the Storm King invasion and subsequent Karkadannistani occupation, becoming a prominent resistance figure. Indeed, many partisan squads found shelter in his domain, as long as they were not foolish enough to disrespect it, and many more yetis and horses paid the price for trying to do exactly that.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Stardustspix"
AES_amza_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 18th of November 953, Mareshi\n\n§YBiography§!: Due to the generosity of the previous rulers, Aestlonia has consistently maintained a welcoming policy for foreign refugees, no matter their origin or race. Among many beneficiaries of this stance, one can find Amza Outtara, once a slave to the Mazwi and now the most famous zebra in the country.\n\nAfter her daring escape during the collapse of the Storm Kingdom and arrival to the snowy southern ranges, Amza quickly found herself joining the socialist circles. Her unique background and ample natural charisma have propelled her to the heights of the newly formed AGWU, while the stories about her past have grown into a legend. Although she cares little to confirm or deny any of them, comrade Outtara is known as a steadfast proponent of social reform and greater equality between all creatures.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"

AES_neutrality_party_long:0 "Aestlonian Arabian Congress     §gDecades after the collapse of Arabian rule over Aestlonia, there is still a sizable community of ponies who identify themselves with the culture, even having an Arabian-inspired language. The Congress was formed as a way to keep this unique identity alive, as well as give these ponies a way to have their concerns heard. Sadly, this hasn't proven to be very fruitful, the blame for this is commonly placed on Prince Lapis, as ponies believe his elitist and abrasive personality have doomed the Congress' acceptance chance by the general Aestlonian population.§!"
AES_communism_party:0 "AGWU"
AES_communism_party_long:0 "Aestlonian General-Workers Union     §gThe AGWU is Aestlonia's first attempt at moderate socialism. The "party" serves as a state-sponsored workers union. The Union itself was created by the previous princess as a way to appease the hard workers of the nation, as without their sacrifices this icy realm wouldn't have gotten anywhere.

Even though the party is majoritarily monarchist, there are certain republican elements within it, these elements being led by the leader's sister, Snow Qalam. Even with this soft split, the party's goals still are to mantain the harmonic order in the Aestlonian realm, no matter in what shape.§!"
AES_fascism_party:0 "Millenary Path"
AES_fascism_party_long:0 "Millenary Path     §gThe Millenary Path is a fervent and controversial group of ponies who view their ancestors' exodus from Maregypt to Aestlonia as a holy event, believing that the icy spirits known as the Windigos bestowed the cold of Aestlonia upon them as a divine gift. These cultists worship the Windigos and believe that the spirits' presence and strength grow with desolation and suffering. As a result, they have historically engaged in violent acts, including village attacks, terrorism, and sacrifices, aiming to invoke the Windigos' power. Their activities have made them a feared and despised faction within Aestlonia, confined mostly to rural areas and, controversially, granted government representation in a bid for peace.§!"

AES_agwu_hestraya_updated_long:0 "Hestrayan General-Workers Union     §gThe HGWU serves as nothing more than a continuation of the AGWU. One now focused on attempting to get workers from all over Hestraya to join their expanded Union.§!"
AES_neutral_army:0 "APA"
AES_neutral_army_long:0 "Aestlonian Provisional Army     §gRecently formed as a way for Aestlonia to protect itself from foreign threats, the Provisional Army, as the name implies, is not a final solution for military issue within the nation. Instead it's a temporary last-minute fix to the issue, this being brought upon due to the Karkadanni threat to the east. The APA is not political in nature, having little interest in ruling the nation in any way. But, their leader, Golden Sayif, has time and time again threatened the cultists of the Millenary Path. It wouldn't be a stretch to say she might react poorly if they are given control over the country.§!"
AES_neutral_proper_army:0 "URAC"
AES_neutral_proper_army_long:0 "United Royal Army Command     §gThe URAC stands as a far more capable and disciplined force for defending Aestlonia and its newly acquired territories compared to the APA.

The party prides itself in following the teachings, morals, and culture of the original Maregyptian settlers. Their leader, Alter Tähenduses, is not unknown in the political circle. Once being the founder and head of the Kapitali Finance Center, where she used to work directly with the previous princess before being kicked out of the Center due to suspicions of embezzlement, someone you could hardly call a religious nationalist personality. Due to this, most look to the party with concern, not being fully sure of what it truly represents or who's backing it from behind the shadows.§!"

AES_democratic_republican_long:0 "Towards a Better Tomorrow-Republicans     §gThe influence and popularity of the TBT couldn't be killed by a simple coup, and this shows by their newest iteration. Republicans always existed within the party, but after recent events their notoriety has only increased, leading to them and their leader, Snow Qalam, being given majority control over the party. They follow the same harmonic principles of the past, but now with a bigger focus in perfecting harmony as a concept.§!"
AES_communism_republican_long:0 "Aestlonian General-Workers Union     §gAfter Zaida's actions in the Karkdannistan conflict and the following declaration of the republic, the famously monarchist Steel Raud decided it would be best to step down and instead give control of the union to her number 2. That being the zebra known as Amza Outtara, an ex-slave of the Mazwi Empire that found refuge in Aestlonia after the collapse of the same. Her policies are much like Raud's, a very soft approach to socialism, but with a much more "utopic" way of going about it when compared to Raud's realism.§!"

AES_neutrality_aesgypt_long:0 "Aesgyptian Movement     §gOnce led by Princess Ntrôm the Movement finds itself being under the leadership of Prince Pikhimphe, Ntrôm's brother. The Movement defends a radical shift from Aestlonian culture to something more akin to what the original Maregyptian settlers used to have.

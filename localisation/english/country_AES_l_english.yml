aestlonia.1.d:0 "##TODO, event about how the path forward might be rough and slow, but it's required considering a Karkad invasion is more obvious day by day, the country can't be in a "political deadlock" anymore, Zaida needs to take stuff in her own hooves if she wants change, even if the parties may not like it."
aestlonia.1.a:0 "Something needs to be done."
aestlonia.2.t:0 "To Tartarus With It"
aestlonia.2.d:0 "##TODO, after some preliminary preparations Zaida declare the National Unity Act as null and void, saying it doesn't count anymore due to changing situations in the country, also saying that later she will decide on what party will help her lead the country once and for all, but only after the approaching war with Karkad is over and the situation has stabilized."

The supremacists, being the Millenary Path, react very poorly to the news and announce that they will be doing everything in their power to oppose this decision, fearing that their safety and influence in the government might have it's days counted."
aestlonia.3.a:0 "So be it."
aestlonia.4.t:0 "A Meeting With the Marshal"
aestlonia.4.d:0 "##TODO, event about Golden Sayif laying out a few emergency reforms necessary to the army, making a point in saying that Aestlonia doesn't have much time to prepare and that the incoming war probably won't last long, bet it ending on a victory or not, so the princess should be mindful when deciding in what to invest in, as when the war is over it's unlikely the political factions will allow her this much freedom again.

aestlonia.8.t:0 "Meeting With Raud"
aestlonia.8.d:0 "##TODO, event about Zaida meeting with the leader of the national workers union, Steel Raud, and thanking her for the help she's providing for the war effort against Karkad in the way of some miner militias.

aestlonia.20.d:0 "##TODO, event about Millenary Path cultists attacking the city of Zarmarej a few days after Zaida abolishes the National Unity Act, it clearly being a direct response to it and a way of revenge by the part of the cultists, since now their control over the governance has been compromised. But, not only that, with the Act gone they also aren't obligated to follow the agreements of the Act, one being they would stop the attacks on cities."
aestlonia.20.a:0 "Someone has to stop these maniacs! Defend the city!"

AES_storm_alsaqie_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 3rd of September 971, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: An Ajloun native, always felt a sense of detachment from the safety and serenity of her hometown. Her fascination lay with the enigmatic and perilous Windigo cult known as the Millenary Path. Despite warnings about their brutality and dark nature, Storm believed the tales were exaggerated, getting drawn to the group's aura of danger, mysticism, and action.\n\nWhen Ajloun and the entirety of Aestlonia faced an attack from the armies of the Storm King, Storm saw an opportunity. She ventured through the snowy forests to contact the cult, only to be dismissed immediately. The cultists doubted her capabilities, viewing her as a sheltered city-dweller unfit for their harsh lifestyle and mission.\n\nDetermined to prove her worth, Storm returned the next day with the tooth of a Yeti she had slain, an extraordinary feat that earned her acceptance. Rising swiftly through the ranks, she eventually took over leadership after the elder "Preacher" passed away. Storm now leads with a similar fierce and ruthless approach, revitalizing the cult and restoring its ancient vigor.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
AES_princess_zaida_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of May 987, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: Born into the Aestlonian royal family, Zaida ascended to the throne at a young age following the unexpected death of her mother. Soon after, she faced skepticism from the advisory council, who doubted her readiness due to her age and strong personality. To calm these doubts, Zaida endeavored to tailor a harmonious, regal facade, though it is clear that she feels constrained by the expectations and pressures placed upon her.\n\nZaida's true desires lie in breaking free from these constraints to take a more proactive and assertive approach to governance. She frequently expresses frustration with the country's stagnant state, advocating for immediate change to ensure Aestlonia's survival in modern times. Her vision includes expanding and securing the nation's surroundings, even proposing a united Hestrayan nation to achieve these goals. This ambitious stance has earned her a reputation as an expansionist war hawk, but Zaida remains undeterred by critics, firmly believing that bold action is necessary.\n\nBeneath her polite exterior, Zaida's strong personality sometimes surfaces in snarky and even insulting remarks when faced with obstacles. She is visibly unhappy with the bureaucracy and elite social events that she perceives as distractions from her true purpose. Zaida is determined to prove herself as a capable ruler, not merely a figurehead bound by her bloodline, but a leader who can surpass her ancestors and truly deserve her title.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Scroup"

AES_golden_sayif_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of Novemeber 979, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: Golden Sayif, lost her parents in a cultist attack as a young filly, surviving thanks to the timely intervention of the Aestlonian army. Found hiding in her family's home, she was rescued and subsequently adopted by one of the officers, who refused to leave her to fend for herself. From that moment on, Sayif was raised in a highly militaristic environment, where discipline and honor were paramount. She grew to deeply respect the military system, considering the officer and the entire armed forces as her second family—the only one she truly knew.\n\nRaised with a strict regimen, Golden developed impressive skills, leadership qualities, and an unbreakable determination. Her dedication and prowess allowed her to rise quickly through the ranks of the Aestlonian army, eventually earning her the esteemed title of field marshal. Her upbringing also emboldened the deep-seated hatred she had for the cultists who had destroyed her family and continued to threaten her homeland. This animosity was further inflamed when the National Unity Act was passed, allowing the cultists of the Millenary Path to participate in governance.\n\nGolden's desire for vengeance against the cultists is intense, with many believing her sole wish is to personally strangle their leader, Storm Alsaqie, with her bare hooves. Her anger and resentment drive her to excel in her military career, constantly pushing herself to be the best and to protect Aestlonia from any further harm caused by the cultists.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
AES_steel_raud_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of Novemeber 959, Wasit province\n\n§YBiography§!: Born in a small mining village in Wasit province, she spent her early years working in the mines to support her community. Like all capable ponies in her village, she toiled underground, contributing to the collective well-being. Growing up, Raud became an imposing figure, towering over most others and possessing remarkable strength, even surpassing many stallions. However, her formidable appearance belied her true nature.\n\nKnown for her compassion and empathy, Raud was always dedicated to helping the weaker members of her community. She consistently provided for those who couldn't provide for themselves, earning a reputation as a local hero through her charitable acts. This pattern of care and support continued as she traveled from town to town in search of work, spreading her influence and goodwill wherever she went.\n\nWhen the state-run "Aestlonian General-Worker's Union" was established following the signing of the National Unity Act, the question of leadership arose. Steel Raud was chosen as the director of the Union due to her local fame and commanding presence.

AES_cryo_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: Unknown\n\n§YBiography§!: "Mere creatures cannot begin to fathom the thoughts of an ice dragon."\n\nAccidentally found by Princess Zaida during a caving trip, the ice dragon known as Cryo dismissed the terrified pegasus and allowed her escape with indifference, only for her Highness to return days later with a panicking linguist. The ice dragon slowly learned Aestlonian, and these talks soon gave the Princess the idea for an offer.\n\n"He loves military planning," she told her fearful military officers about their newest lieutenant, "And he'll boost recruitment!"\n\nTo Cryo's credit, his strategies conducted in war exercises would merit promotions, but nopony considered convincing him, out of fear or futility, that his "military planning" was mostly logistic coordination.\n\nBeyond the military, the ice dragon cares little for politics and speaks even less of his homeland. One occasion a brave-enough subordinate asked what other ice dragons were like, and Cryo huffed. "I had horns," he snarled icily.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Littlepudel"

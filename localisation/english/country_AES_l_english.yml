### Ideas ###
AES_research_bonus:0 "The Price Of The Abundant Fear Of All Truths"
AES_unity_act_spirit:0 "National Unity Act"
AES_unity_act_spirit_desc:0 "The National Unity Act was signed after the tumultuous period of the Storm King and subsequent Karkadannistan invasions of Aestlonia. Its primary goal was to unite the country and facilitate its reconstruction. To achieve this, the Act formalized proper political parties, while also granting representation and power to the Millenary Path. This was intended to ensure that all factions had a say in the country's governance in exchange for their cooperation.\n\nWhile the Act accelerated Aestlonia's recovery from the war, it now poses an obstacle to further political and economic reforms. The structure it established has led to a perpetual political standstill, as parties rarely reach full agreement on any reform."
AES_aestlonia_identity:0 "Aestlonian Identity"
AES_aestlonia_identity_desc:0 "From the great migration, to the wrath of the cultists, the rule of the Arabians and now independence. Our great nation has endured a lot. With carefully planned reforms and programs, a new wave of nationalistic fervor has risen amongst our people who identify first as Aestlonian."
AES_ajloun_batallion:0 "Legacy of the Ajloun Brigade"
AES_ajloun_batallion_desc:0 "Formed in the sixth century after the formation of the Governorate of Hestraya, the Ajloun Brigade were a reaction to the resurgence of cultist attacks upon the civilian population of the region. While one out of many such groups, it was the most well known and has a rich and storied history of protecting the weak; something that it carries out even to this day.\n\nHowever, as much as it has been a boon to the people, the archaic organization of such groups cannot stand against the armies of nations today. While how far should our modernization efforts go remains in question, no one can doubt that the current militias are very much out of date."
AES_equipment_bad_standards:0 "Lowered Production Standards"
AES_equipment_bad_standards_desc:0 "The quality of our products are being lessened, in the hopes of keeping pace with our military's needs and requirements. While not as lethal as they should be, the weapons produced are still no less deadly."
AES_equipment_bad_standards_v2:0 "Optimized System"
AES_equipment_bad_standards_v2_desc:0 "Our factories have worked tirelessly, managing to work out a system to efficiently hammer out equipment without compromising on its quality and still delivering on time."
AES_production_complex_idea:0 "National Production Complex"
AES_production_complex_idea_desc:0 "With the choice of focusing over an organized industrial basis that produces high quality weaponry, the guilds of our nation are steadily transformed into a production complex that fulfills the needs of our army. Grey smoke stacks fill the skylines of the capital in contrast to the blue-white panorama of our winters, and factories aplenty churn out the tools to protect our sovereignty; with more being built on the horizon."
AES_production_complex_idea_v2:0 "The Fires of Industry"
AES_production_complex_idea_v2_desc:0 "With sufficient coordination, planning and provisions from the crown, the once few factories that dotted our nation are now turned into vast industrial complexes. Investment is high, opportunities are plentiful and employment even more so; leading to a boom in the development of our country. The fires of these modern-day forges burn red hot, running strong even in the bleak midwinter, to provide Aestlonia with its needs."
AES_karkad_war_buffs:0 "Never Again"
AES_karkad_war_buffs_desc:0 "##TODO, We might have once lost to Karkadannistan, but this mistake will not repeat. We are fully committed to safeguard our freedom, we have learnt from the past and we're still here to say it proudly: "Aestlonia shall be free!""
AES_3_plus_1_languages:0 "3+1 Issue"
AES_3_plus_1_languages_desc:0 "Made up of many communities of different cultural backgrounds, the Aestlonian nation is home to a diverse population that speaks 3 different languages. To make matters worse, after the Arabians imposed their rule upon the region, their own language was introduced as the "universal" language which was used to draft official documents and records. Centuries later, this poses a hurdle for the nation where Arabian communities (while a significant minority) constitute a small percentage of the population; most of which are not versed in their language."
AES_3_plus_1_languages_v2:0 "Slowly Forming Identity"
AES_3_plus_1_languages_v2_desc:0 "For centuries, the communities of Aestlonia have not had the opportunity to take a breather and appreciate the diversity of culture and languages of their nation. Now, with recent efforts undertaken by the Princess, work is being done on forging a nascent Aestlonian identity."
AES_army_language_spirit:0 "Army Language"
AES_army_language_spirit_desc:0 "The various languages, once a major hindrance to a unified cultural zeitgeist, has allowed our armed corps to communicate in a unique manner unseen in any other nation's armed forces and has helped foster a closer understanding of the different cultures inhabiting our nation; leading to a bond over shared heritage and belonging."
AES_the_evil_pact:0 "Lumetorm Pact"
AES_the_evil_pact_desc:0 "##TODO, with the temporary pact officialized the cultist have gotten a lot more influence over the Aestlonian government. But, at least, the cultists might start joining the army."
AES_windigo_spirit_preparationtree:0 "Warriors of the Ice Spirits"
AES_windigo_spirit_preparationtree_desc:0 "##TODO, The cultists have created this whole concept around the Windigos, one that has started to resonate even with part of our army. People are now doing near to fully suicidal missions and acts in name of the spirits."
AES_for_harmony:0 "Fighting for Harmony"
AES_for_harmony_desc:0 "##TODO, we're not fighting because we want war, we're fighting simply to protect what's ours. They started this fire, not us. If they want a fight, they will have one. But we won't forget our principles."
AES_ponykind_volunteers:0 "Pony Volunteers"
AES_ponykind_volunteers_desc:0 "##TODO, all over pony nations our call has been heard. One of resistance against a foreign enslaving enemy that wants to destroy our lands and people. These brave volunteers will help our country in more ways than just manpower, as their presence allows us to learn from their teachings."
AES_arab_volunteers:0 "Arabian Volunteers"
AES_arab_volunteers_desc:0 "##TODO, our righteous message was able to convince quite a few of the horses of Arabia and beyond to fight for our cause. Not only are they helping us by holding our frontlines but they're also providing much of their advanced knowledge."

AES_cultist_opposition_desc:0 "##TODO, with our refusal to work with them the cultist have taken to sabotage us in our war against Karkadannistan."
AES_arab_resentment:0 "In Limbo"
AES_arab_resentment_desc:0 "##TODO, after recent events the considerably sized Arabian community has been left in a state of limbo due to Zaida's push to create a more "native" Aestlonian identity. The state now needs to decide if it will try to adopt this culture back into the new cultural framework in some way or if it will work to phase it out."

### Army coup/Republic ideas###
AES_new_regime:0 "Aspirant Republic"
AES_new_regime_desc:0 "##TODO, with the establishment of the republic many political and social groups have become agitated and even enthusiastic to take part in the new regime. But this doesn't mean that our time ruling the country will be easy. Politics are messier than ever and it might be hard to hold onto our popularity in the future as the people demand a true Republic."
AES_recognition_no:0 "Diplomatic Isolation"
AES_recognition_no_desc:0 "##TODO, even if Aestlonia wasn't known for it's web of diplomatic and trade partners, we still had something to fall back on.

AES_liberal_approach:0 "Liberal Approach"
AES_liberal_approach_desc:0 "##TODO, The way of the sword is not the way that we wish to rule this country. It's clear that our liberal approach of working with the less extremist groups is the best way to ensure stablity and a bright future for the new republic."

AES_great_lakes_refugee:0 "Refugee Act"
AES_great_lakes_refugee_desc:0 "##TODO, with the situation in the Great Lakes being as unstable as ever it is our duty to accept "refugees" from these lands. The Crimson Sun has been nice enough to secure regimed-friendly zebras interested to move to our nation."

AES_settling_down_desc:0 "The Aestlonian Provisional Army was always meant to be a temporary organization.

AES_updating_the_paperwork:0 "Updating the Paperwork"
AES_updating_the_paperwork_desc:0 "No proper administration can function without a solid bureaucratic foundation.

It would be politically unwise to reject and ignore them."
AES_give_leniency:0 "Give Leniency"
AES_give_leniency_desc:0 "In order to show that we are truly behind the workers of our nation, it is prudent we relax some of our interim laws in order to let the AGWU truly carry out their operations.

AES_travelling_caravans:0 "Liberating Caravans"
AES_travelling_caravans_desc:0 "##TODO, they say that knowledge liberates, and that much we have to agree with, a reason the cultists had gotten so many members recently was due to their exploitation of vulnerable communities who didn't know any better.

AES_politicize_the_army:0 "Politicize the Army"
AES_politicize_the_army_desc:0 "##TODO, being apolotical isn't a sign of modernity for an army, it's a sign of complicity.

AES_total_separation:0 "Total Separation"
AES_total_separation_desc:0 "##TODO, from all the times it was tried, mixing army and politics simply didn't work out.

AES_union_integration:0 "Union Integration"
AES_union_integration_desc:0 "##TODO, the AGWU isn't like your typical group of "socialists", instead it does seem that they truly care for the workers that they claim to represent, even going as far as cooperating with a non-aligned government.

AES_securing_our_existence:0 "Securing Our Existence"
AES_securing_our_existence_desc:0 "##TODO, the threats from within might have been defeated, but this does not mean that we are safe. There are still unfriendly or unworthy nations that border us and spell future danger to our existence. It would be a good idea to strike them now."

Indeed, many ponies believed in them and eagerly carried the words about transformation further on, while some were brave enough to act upon these murmurs, bringing their own vision for the country closer to reality. Still, for now, there was only one creature whose ambition to shift the realm matched their capabilities to do so.\n\nPrincess Zaida paced across her private study impatiently. Whereas her late mother, Princess Rawiya, second of the name, spent a lot of time in the audience chambers, hosting various factions and balancing their expectations, the young ruler had quickly lost any faith in the process of holding an all-pleasing court. In her eyes, the political forces across the Advisory Council were abusing the National Unity Act to focus on their petty problems, burying truly important issues under worthless squabbles. Even the growing threat of Karkadannistani invasion, one promising the very end of their proud nation, was not enough to resolve the constant state of deadlock.\n\nStopping in front of a large window, Zaida pulled the heavy curtains to the sides, allowing in the cold bright sun. The view of her beloved city calmed the princess somewhat, sharpening her focus and tempering her frustration into determination. As always, she needed to act on her own, charting the new course with a sure hoof no matter how rough the coming storm was shaping up to be."
aestlonia.1.a:0 "Emergency royal decrees were drafted shortly."
aestlonia.2.t:0 "Reign and Rein"
aestlonia.2.d:0 "As the heiress apparent, Zaida had experienced an upbringing entirely devoted to the duties and best practices of an enlightened leader. Although the lessons she learned so diligently turned out to be needed much sooner than she had expected, the princess used this core knowledge with great confidence over the last few years.\n\nAmong the different subjects, history had been one of her favorites. There was something especially fascinating and profound to be observed in the rise and fall of the great powers of the world, be it the now obvious collapse of Sa'adles or Grovers, or the smaller signs of decadence seen in the mighty Equestria, promising it a similar path. From where Zaida was standing, all of these examples of decline had common symptoms: bloated bureaucracy, neglected military, technological stagnation, and harmful deference to their traditions. \n\nWith the recent edicts, she did everything to combat the spread of the former three ailments inside of Aestlonia, at least everything possible in the current legal framework. Nonetheless, this was clearly not enough to ensure the survival of the country, and the biggest barrier preventing future reforms became painfully obvious. The princess felt no joy in tearing down her mother's legacy, but she could not afford to delay the next steps any longer, and so, after a short deliberation within the inner circle of the court, a new order was released, one to become a title of many front pages and a top point for many debates."
aestlonia.2.a:0 ""By royal will, National Unity Act is null and void.""
aestlonia.3.t:0 "The Reaction"
aestlonia.3.d:0 "Winter Qalam held little doubt that the present session of the Advisory Council was the most dynamic in the last few months, perhaps even since the coronation of Zaida. Naturally, their gracious ruler was the reason for this perturbation too.\n\n"To sum up, no offense to all the fine folks here, these meetings were really becoming a drag." Steel Raud, the imposing representative of AGWU, currently occupied the speaker's podium. "Her majesty is not only well within her rights to change the laws - this is the only way out of our snowdrifts."\n\nThe creatures in the room started clamoring. The wing occupied by Millenary Path was expectedly united in their vocal disapproval, but Winter noticed negative remarks coming from other parties as well, including some members of his own TBT.\n\n"Order in the assembly!" His duties as a chairpony were sure to be tested today, but the realm needed every bit of stability if Zaida's plans were to work. "We have heard the opinion of the Union, and now would like to invite commentary for further discussion. Honorable Snowstorm, we would be grateful if you could present the opinion of your faction."\n\nA pony with mane of red and white - a cultist, even though Winter never liked the term - rose up after silence finally fell down. "Thank you. This... decision enforced by the princess is nothing but regression to the oppressive regime of the past. Not only does she remove the voice from the common Aestlonians, but she also robs them of the chance to defend their traditions, so nobly provided by her late mother..."\n\nThe rest of the sentence was drowned in the rising wave of accusations, jeering and hollers of support. With a sigh, Winter reached for his gavel again."
aestlonia.3.a:0 ""Order! Order, fillies and gentlecolts!""
aestlonia.4.t:0 "Hour Of The Sword"
aestlonia.4.d:0 "No war could be fought without the soldiers, and no soldiers would march without a commander. Luckily, Zaida had no delusions regarding her own military prowess, but the upcoming conflict demanded more than an honest assessment of her capabilities. In order to finalize the development of Aestlonian Provisional Army and ensure that its officers would be fully immersed in the reforms, the top brass was summoned to the royal palace for a series of planning sessions and battle plan elaborations.\n\nField marshal Golden Sayif and her generals arrived promptly, ready and able to contribute to the discussions. While Zaida respected Golden's abilities and accomplishments, as she was sitting in the chamber-turned-headquarters and listening to the officers' presentations, the princess could easily see that it would be a while before the gruff mare would show her any reverence beyond that dictated by the etiquette.\n\n"We are standing at the crossroads, your majesty. As it was explained prior, troop quality and quantity have their merits, and even with your commendable swiftness we do not have time to achieve both." Marshal's voice, trained by thousands of orders, rang crisply across the room. "The final decision is yours, and it would be wise to make it today. Permission to speak freely?"\n\n"Granted." Nodding, Zaida wordlessly wondered whether she could stop her from speaking freely at all.\n\n"The Karkad incursion will be short, one way or the other. After it is over, if Aestlonia stands, the power you have to change it will be curtailed." Golden gave the princess a hardened stare. "Use it well, and remember, when the strife comes, the corruption from within will raise its head too. Do not allow the damned cult to spread its taint with abandon again.""
aestlonia.4.a:0 ""Your... advice is noted, lady marshal.""
aestlonia.6.t:0 "Grind Down, Build Anew"
aestlonia.6.d:0 ""You! Private!" Golden Sayif focused all her attention on a single recruit in the long line, causing him to visibly shake. "How many laps did you make in the allotted time?"\n\n"T-t-ten." The heavy breaths and ample amount of sweat indicated that this was the extent of the stallion's current physical form. Golden had no doubts that a green member of the old Ajloun Brigade would make fifteen with a leisurely trot. Shivering under her heavy gaze still, the unfortunate pony felt a need to add something else. "Y-your highness."\n\nFrom a certain point of view, the marshal felt sorry for this lot. The decision to have enough bodies to properly cover the entire front line with Karkadannistan was strategically sound, but it also meant that the quality of the future defenders of the nation was, as one of the officers tactfully put it, below average. Thus, it fell to Golden to make these pathetic whelps into something presentable.\n\n"YOUR HIGHNESS? You can call a mare you are trying to woo "your highness", though I don't think you have a chance with muscles like that." With every booming word, the recruit seemed to shrink away further and further. "You will call me Marshal Golden, or ma'am. Is. That. Clear?"\n\n"Yes. Marshal Golden. Ma'am." After whispering his answer, the pony winced as laughter from the tail end of the formation reached his ears. Golden, meanwhile, was happy to pounce on the new target.\n\n"Oh, the privates who made less than ten find it funny? Well, all of you can have fun." She raised her voice to the full commanding power, causing everyone to snap to attention immediately. "Five minutes of rest for you all, and another run. All who fail to get twelve make a third attempt. IS THAT CLEAR?""
aestlonia.6.a:0 ""Yes, Marshal Golden, ma'am!""
aestlonia.7.t:0 "Building Upon the Old"
aestlonia.7.d:0 "Golden Sayif had a faint smile on her face, a sight as rare as a hot summer in Aestlonia. In the distance, the enemy dummy stood peppered with a few holes; specifically, three in the chest and two in the head.\n\nFive perfect shots. The shooter himself was crouched beside her, skillfully unloading the breech cartridge and hanging the rifle by his side with a similar proud look on his face. Along the same range, other soldiers and recruits from the old Ajloun Brigade scored similar shots on their targets. In the distance, Golden could hear the reverberating chants of soldiers marching in synchronized steps; their guns hung ready on their shoulders.\n\nThis is what an army should be, she thought. Even if the days of disorganized militias were past, their legacy and experience would still carry on the torch of the nation in battles henceforth. Even so, her thoughts lingered in doubt.\n\nWill it be enough? The enemy was vast and would no doubt outnumber them and their smaller army...\n\n"Marshal Golden!"\n\nTurning to the source of the sound, she saw that all the recruits had finished taking their shots at the targets. Perfect scores, all of them.\n\n"Good shooting, recruits! Keep working this hard and you will be ready for any battle! Now...give me ten laps around the ground in half an hour!" she bellowed.\n\nIt will have to be enough..."
aestlonia.7.a:0 "Professionals have standards."
aestlonia.8.t:0 "Noble and Strong"
aestlonia.8.d:0 "Zaida surely knew how to talk the talk. After all, it was a quality necessary for any politician, and throughout her life Steel Raud saw many ponies of that kind. There was something special about this one, however, a certain quality which all these big-mouthed mares and stallions lacked in. Even now, during their private meeting, when the princess was not perched up on her throne and had to raise her head to meet the gaze of the considerably taller socialist, Zaida carried a presence which simply put her one level higher.\n\n"Once again, I am incredibly thankful for your support, Director. It would hardly be an overstatement that the levels of effort Aestlonians are putting out right now, be it militia service or factory work, are unprecedented and fill my soul with eternal gratitude." The princess bowed slightly.\n\n"It is what they do, Your Majesty. For the country, and, frankly, for you." Returning the gesture, Raud pushed her chair back a bit.\n\nZaida smiled politely, but then sighed and allowed a thoughtful expression to cross her face. "I would be not quite honest if I said I understand these feelings in my heart. Logically, the adoration and the respect for the ruler are natural, but I have never had a similar figure placed above me." Her companion did not interrupt, and so the pensiveness coalesced into determination. "Still, I know that I will do everything in my power to carry the greatness they ascribe to me."\n\n"That's what all of us do. All we can." Raud remained reserved, but her eyes came alight with a spark of approval. "That's what I wanted to ask too. More fight to be found in this pony. I want to join the army. If Your Majesty would have me, of course.""
aestlonia.8.a:0 "Her call was heard and accepted. "
aestlonia.9.t:0 "An Encounter to Remember"
aestlonia.9.d:0 "The meeting between villages of different tribes was quite a significant event, organized by local governors with meticulous care. Of course, these big words meant something only for the grown-ups, and while the stallions and mares mingled at the massive culture fair, their children sought their own exchanges.\n\n"Anneli." A filly with a high-pitched voice pointed at herself, mirroring the gesture of a darker colt in a thick cap in front of her. "And you're called Iuh-hur?"\n\n"It's Yukhur." While he could understand his own distorted name among the weird sounds the stranger made, most of her words remained a mystery. "I. Come. From. Beyond. Big. Forest."\n\nGathering that the slowed rhythm corresponded to an explanation was easy, but it scarcely helped to understand any of the meaning behind the unfamiliar language. Trying her best to express confusion, Anneli grimaced and chaotically gestured with hooves.\n\nAfter a short deliberation, Yukhur picked up a nearby twig and started tracing lines in the fresh snow. The map he made was quite detailed, with a plethora of triangle trees, a thick line for the river and several boxy houses. Satisfied with the result, the colt added a tiny pony figure next to one of them, and nodded towards it. Recognising the stream, his companion snatched the stick and started adding to the picture. After she finished a similar piece of taiga with a set of more rounded buildings, a spark of mischief flared in her eyes as she reached out to the first half and added a curled hat to its lone inhabitant. Resemblance was passing at best, but Yukhur nodded with approval and answered with his own detail - another pony next to the circles, one with braided mane, just like Anneli."
aestlonia.9.a:0 "They were drawing close."
aestlonia.10.t:0 "A New Page"
aestlonia.10.d:0 "Dissolving the National Unity Act was a significant, but entirely political step. Zaida ached for more, for something visible and formed by her own will, not just related to her mother's achievements. Today, she was doing exactly that.\n\n"A historical occurrence, Your Majesty." The ever loyal advisor, Winter Qalam, hovered over her shoulder, reading the document neatly laid out on the table. "It is truly wonderful that recognition of our heritage is not dislodged by other pressing concerns."\n\n"Do you really think so?" Tapping her pen nervously, the princess frowned. "Some would say that it is an empty and vainglorious thing, neither necessary nor timely."\n\n"These voices should be rebuffed steadily and we will answer their cries in a twofold manner. It is a project which has been developed with your supervision by a team of our greatest artists, writers and linguists over several years, hence it has little bearing on current material resources, and there is no better moment to strengthen the soul of a creature, or indeed, the nation, than during a struggle. Your loyal subjects are completely behind you, Your Majesty." The stallion smiled as she made a confident nod and scribbled an ornate signature on the bottom of the last page. For him, there was power in names and words, and today this power was given out evenly, shaping regions, cities, or indeed, their ruler."

aestlonia.11.t:0 "Course Selection"
aestlonia.11.d:0 "With every piece of objective information at hoof and after receiving every possible advice, Princess Zaida had to chart the future course of the realm once more. The attack was coming, and without a reliable plan it would crush Aestlonia in a matter of weeks.\n\nThe sensible option, of course, was to stick with the proven loyalists, TBT or AGWU. By putting the international connections of the former or the popular support of the latter to the forefront of the preparation campaign, reasonable progress could be achieved in the remaining time. Still, what if reasonable was not enough?\n\nA tinge of fear, a speck of desperation, maybe even a shade of dark ambition highlighted another possibility. The cultists of Millenary Path were more than capable fighters, and without the National Unity Act they were turning against the state once more, putting even more pressure on the overextended army. This situation could be reversed, new negotiations initiated, starting a risky bargain with a steep price of success and failure alike."

"It is quite appreciated that you were able to do it on such short notice."\n\nA barely visible head motion, which could be counted as a nod only under the most generous interpretation, was the only answer.\n\n"Well. To business then." Glancing to the sides, the princess shifted forward slightly. "I was told that you have brought a final draft of the pertinent agreement?"\n\nThere was a ringing noise of clasp removed, a rustle of paper sheets and finally a soft knock on the table as the documents were placed in front of Zaida. As per the many legal lessons from her younger days, she took time reading every word and measuring their dark implications. Unfortunately, this was exactly the list of measures necessary to save Aestlonia.\n\n"It goes without saying that we expect a very strict reading of the text." She tried to sound assertive. "Millenary Path shall act civilized, exactly as it portrays itself to the outside world, and never as a harmful sect." Since there was no indication of any interruption or comment, Zaida pushed on. "There is also the matter of the ending clause. You and your people need to understand that most of these privileges will be withdrawn after the war, subject to royal review depending on the past circumstances."\n\nStorm Alsaqie remained frozenly still."

First is duty, as I've said. Second, I take pride in my talent for war" Stressing the last word, the stallion tapped the ground firmly. "Third, just like you, I carry the blood of Arabia.

Tellingly, the fact that he was not alone out here made the situation even more unbearable.\n\n"Come on, sergeant. Shelter-making should be easy for such an accomplished officer. Use that big head of yours." One of his new instructors snickered and tapped her hoof. Unlike Shiver, she seemed right at home here in the tundra, among the elements and strange creature sounds.\n\nHe sighed. They had given him a tool for digging, so it would make sense to dig. Putting all his weight into the strike, Shiver brought the spade down to the frigid ground with a loud clang. The resulting dent was miserably small.\n\n"Sister, look! He actually went for it." The other teacher made a guffawing noise. "Go on, continue. If you try hard enough, your dead body will appreciate the shallow grave."\n\n"I'm sorry, this does require a bit more folk wisdom than marching on a parade." Moving leisurely, the first mare approached Shiver, who felt too embarrassed to provide a retort. "Shovelling will get you nowhere even in the summer. Watch closely. These marks come from the bark of the tree - the best way to start a shelter is to fell one."\n\n"So get chopping. We are going to pray, and when we come back you'd better make some progress."

And with our strength carried by the mighty wind of hatred, we shall destroy any and all who oppose us, and feed the lands with their ashes and blood.

At last, Snowstorm took the final step, she was standing still and observing the audience, but something in the response caused the marshal's instinct to halt the plan. Golden expected approval from members of the sect, but the chamber was full of other ponies, civilian or even military ones, who stomped and cheered with the same insane passion.

These ponies would soon become another marker on the map of the frontline, but here and now they were flesh and blood, ready to fight and to die, to do their duty to the state - duty to her.\n\nHer thoughts wandered across their fates, while her eyes examined their faces. This one, for instance, a stallion with a streak of red mane sticking from under his cap and a chiseled jaw - what would come of him? Feeling the royal attention, the recruit saluted and Zaida nodded back.\n\n"Anything of particular interest to Your Majesty?" The colonel assigned to the force, a grizzled veteran, posed the question with reverence and a subtle hint of worry, ready to pounce on the source of the problem.\n\n"Yes, actually. I want to give the soldiers a speech." Driven by a sudden, deep impulse, Zaida took a step back. After the officer obediently commanded for attention and hundreds of heads turned to catch her every word, she started to speak, loudly and passionately.\n\n"Sons and daughters of Aestlonia!

Our country faces a monumental danger. It will take a great effort to overcome it, but overcome it we shall." Winter Qalam's voice echoed over the audience eager to catch his every word. "No matter the belief or political cause, it is time to reach out to our brothers and sisters and rise up as an unbreakable bulwark against the invasion." The stallion nodded to his larger companion, inviting her to take over.\n\n"It is just so." Steel Raud spoke slower, simpler, but with the same underlying intent. "We will fight, and we will win. For we are made of harder stuff, for we are protecting the lives and the lands we cherish. Rich or poor, one tribe or another, city dweller or village folk - all can help, will help."\n\nFinally, the princess herself took a step forward. As she raised her hoof, the excited crowd swiftly fell silent. "Today I stand between two great champions of our nation. Soon, I will be leading a thousand times more, creatures both mighty and proud. Know this: the accord reached here and now will be the everlasting bond, one which we will all take strength from, be it in the struggle or in the glorious peace afterwards." Looking around, Zaida could easily see the planted seeds of success. Hundreds of her devoted subjects were ready to spread the true message, one which she carried with passion and one turned into a battle-cry by the unleashed crowd."

aestlonia.30.d:0 ""Sir. This is quite unlikely to be a part of the Karkadannistani infiltration scheme." The polite, patient tone of his aide only made port overseer Tiidrik more irritated.\n\n"You'd do well to listen to the young lad." Flicking ash off her cigarette, the mare in front of him tilted her head. "Me and my friends have better things to do than traveling across the seas and pulling practical jokes on harbormasters."\n\n"Listen, Miss..." Under a dozen intense stares from the aforementioned friends, a group of ponies in matching uniforms huddled behind their leader, Tiidrik hastened to correct himself. "I meant, Sergeant Foam. There are proper rules and regulations. Due to the current situation. I cannot allow a fully-loaded military transport to..."\n\n"Afraid to say you've got it all wrong. We are not a military transport." Foam grinned widely. "Just a shared interest group with a strong theme and a thing for tourism."\n\nBefore the overseer had a chance to question this dubious claim, a shout came from the communications room of his patrol ship. "They've got an all clear from the Ajloun headquarters, sir! Also multiple requests for docking inbound!" The latter comment was rather superfluous, as looking down towards the horizon Tiidrik could discern at least ten more vessels which were approaching at a steady pace. Suddenly, everything about this bizarre incident clicked inside of his head."

aestlonia.31.d:0 "Having his crew march somewhere outside the mines was nothing new for captain Merle. However, unlike the strikes which he organized back when his mane was black instead of gray and lungs had less dust in them, this was decidedly not an anti-government protest.\n\n"What is the meaning of this gathering?" A round helmet and a pair of darting eyes were the only parts of the officer who addressed the workers from beyond the barricades of the military outpost. Glancing at the crowd, minding its size in particular, Merle could guess the source of the apprehension pretty easily. "It is my duty to inform you that public actions are..."\n\n"Comrades!" One of the younger miners operated the loudhailer, a stout mare with a voice still capable of ringing sonorously. "No cause for alarm! We want to talk to the big brass in the capital, and since you have a direct line to them, here we are."\n\nThe soldier's head disappeared for a minute, before popping right back, a bit higher than before. "This is hardly a standard procedure!" Of course, this fact was known to Merle too, but he had learnt the value of action over red tape long ago. The captain leaned closer to the speaker.\n\n"Tell them we're here to fight for our country. Tell them the creatures of Aestlonia has heard her call." These raspy words of an old patriot were first amplified by the megaphone, then carried over by a winded private straight to his commander, and finally sent across hundreds of kilometers to the capital. There, a choice was made and hundreds of fates were redirected."

Even so, in these troubled times one had to settle for  solace instead of joy.\n\n"It is rather curious, the manner our bloodlines work." The sovereign princess glanced at her noblemare companions. "When a foreign aristocrat has grand ideas for the cultural transformation, or the survival of the state, does it ever end well?"\n\n"Pray tell you do not speak of yourself, cherished cousin." Although Lumi, the head of the ancient family once ruling over Särav Org, was not related to Zaida this closely, such an endearing term was customary in their circles. "You are the one who the nation follows, in hearts and minds alike, the very essence of their kinship."\n\n"They do indeed, but what is the justification of such loyalty? By birth and custom, I am much closer to just another Arabian despot than either you or cousin Ntrôm." Zaida straightened her mane in a slow, melancholic gesture.\n\nThe second mentioned pony bowed slightly and then answered softly, yet with certainty. "Their faith in you binds stronger than any other claim. True, my ancestors fled the Maregypt alongside theirs, and cousin Lumi is also related to the kings of old, but this is not what Aestlonia needs now. You are the princess, their princess, the one who leads them bravely through a terrible tempest. Take this destiny with pride.""

However, there was nothing of the sort to be found inside the mind which devised a daring strike at the corruption in the heart of the nation. Something had to occupy the abandoned position, and the determination, deep-rooted and bitter, proved to be just the right force.\n\nThe transmitter in her hoof felt heavy and cold, like a rifle after a long march. Golden put out the speech notes in front of her, taking aim, and then pulled the proverbial trigger.\n\n"Fellow citizens of Aestlonia. Marshal Golden Sayif speaking. [AES.Capital.GetName] is liberated from the clutches of the Millenary Path. Her former majesty Princess Zaida is under house arrest, and the monarchy is abolished in favor of a republican regime. To that effect, the National Assembly is suspended."\n\nAn intimate knowledge of the city defenses, the cultists' belief in their own invulnerability, a core of loyal soldiers, all the ingredients for a decapitating strike were perfect.

In some sense, Oskarri, the mare being addressed, shared the same desire for certainty.\n\n"I should ask forgiveness for gathering all of you with so little to explain." She spoke softly, but loudly enough to be heard in the far corners of the packed room. "There have been no instructions from the city, and I have conversed with messengers from the other villages - they do not know anything conclusive yet."\n\n"But what about the announced rules on trade...?"\n"Will we get funds for the upcoming festival at least...?"\n"Are we to prepare the young'uns for town school...?"\n"Is it true that the princess has changed her name?"\n\nThese and many more questions filled the common hall, with the last one coming from a particularly curious foal. The royal proclamation on cultural changes has left many Aestlonian Arabians puzzled, as it only included the plans for bridging the three main tribes, and left their group out. Oskarri did not doubt that her neighbors were happy to support her majesty Zaida, but in order to do so they would need to understand what she wanted for their people. She raised her hoof, signaling silence.\n\n"The last one is indeed true, petal."  As the villagers calmed down, she continued.

"Zarf, I have given a strict order to not be disturbed."\n\n"I beg forgiveness a thousand times, sir!" His secretary's voice was coming from outside the room. "I've told her..."\n\nA sheet of paper slammed down right in front of Finjan caused him to wince and interrupted Zarf's stream of excuses.\n\n"Who dares... Ah." Raising his head, the stallion examined the intruder with a measured resentment instead of the flaring fury. "Marshal. To what do we owe this dubious and ever so interruptive pleasure?"\n\nGolden Sayif nodded towards the letter. "Read, Finjan. Take your time."\n\nHe exhaled sharply, but followed the order still. With every digested word his brow was becoming increasingly furrowed. "Is this some kind of prank? Her Majesty would never want our respectable organization to give up our much needed funding to some uneducated brutes. And what is this ridiculous clause about the building? Really, I insist you leave and think about your outlandish behavior..."\n\n"It's already done." The marshal remained perfectly calm. "You and your pretty club can continue sucking the country's budget after the war. For now, you're out. My lads and lasses will help you vacate the premises - it's your choice whether their hooves will be helping or up your croup."\n\nFinjan had to open and close his mouth a few times before producing an answer.

aestlonia.36.d:0 "With the brunt of preparations for the Karkadannistan war focused closer to the future front line, the court life in the capital became unusually quiet. Zaida would often find herself with sparse company, spending long hours neck-deep in paperwork and planning, but sometimes stuck with only servants and her own musings for entertainment. These daydreaming moments, especially those which lingered, could carry her far across the ocean of ideas. Sometimes, a peculiar thought could suddenly surface, manifesting into an actual deliberation.\n\nTo stop the horses, Hestraya would have to stand united. However, despite all the shared history and common interests, all the treaties and promises, it did consist of two parts. The princess did not truly think Maretonia inferior, but a prideful, disdainful whisper in her mind was always happy to repeat the gossip of northern softness, laziness, even weakness in front of the incoming danger. Maybe this neighbor could use some direction, even prosper under a more decisive ruler?\n\nA more calculating side of her consciousness kicked in swiftly. Actually claiming the crown was barely possible, requiring unreasonable exploitation of the fact that the Maretonian duke was Zaida's brother-in-law. Worse, full-blown negotiations would require ages to complete. This left a sudden ultimatum as the only viable option, betting heavily on the fact that the local nobles could be shocked into submission and the duchess shared the same outlook as her younger sibling.  Naturally, a failure would ruin the public image of the princess, lead to an irreconcilable breakdown of their partnership or worse, but what if..."

Unsurprisingly, the general public does not wish to fight against a historical ally, and the army, remaining unprepared for any kind of local operation due to the value placed on secrecy by the princess, is vehemently against any escalation.

"The army is not a toy to be winded up at your leisure, and neither is the entire foreign policy."\n\nDespite the tone of the address, the princess maintained her mask for now, patiently awaiting the obligatory "your majesty", which Golden Sayif finally spitted out with contempt. "Your dissatisfaction has been noted. Is there anything else you find necessary to share with our court?"\n\n"As a matter of fact, yes." Looking around at the assembled officials, the older mare snorted and continued in a collected manner. "The princess is careless, inexperienced and not yet fit to rule, while her actions are burying Aestlonia in deep snow…"\n\nTalking down to Zaida was one thing, but talking over her, belittling her authority was on a different level of unacceptable entirely. "How dare you!" The sudden clarion outburst caused the marshal to stop. "What do you know of the monarch’s burden? Must we remind you that you gave an oath to serve the state, my state? You have a duty protecting the country and following orders, not questioning your sovereign ruler.

aestloniamonarchy.1.d:0 "There was a part of Zaida that felt relieved. Aestlonia was victorious, and, what's more, she was victorious, standing atop a monumental triumph. Nonetheless, the urge to relax, partake in leisure and celebrate was quickly shut down by two prevailing factors.\n\nFirstly, there was the objective reality. The battle reports and appeals from the home front were not gone, but instead replaced by the proceedings of establishing control over the new territories and restoration of the old ones. Although Zaida managed to jumpstart the country once, now this only compounded with the older systemic problems. Thus, a decisive push for stability was required, one obviously to be spearheaded by the reigning monarch.\n\nSecondly, there were other ideas bubbling inside the mind of the princess. Why would she be content with pushing back some uninspired, barbaric opportunists? Zaida could do so much more, for the people, for harmony, and for greater glory still. Indeed, some of her newest works, such as the reorganization of the Provisional Army, guard regiments and the eastern partisan forces into the United Royal Army Command, were approaching final stages of completion, and the ground was set for more ambitious developments."

Despite the insistence of more ceremony-minded members of the court, she had no intention of letting this revert to the previous form.\n\nToday’s visit by a certain Pinekäbi, an earth pony from the territories previously occupied by Karkadannistan, was a perfect example to prove her preferences right, as instead of a lengthy session of title calling and a myriad of obligatory pleasantries, Zaida could dive almost straight into the conversation. By the intelligence reports it was promising to be an interesting one: the stallion bowing in front of the throne went from a member of the Millenary Path to a tundra reservation ranger to a star of the local resistance, now ready to properly serve the crown.\n\n"Your Majesty. Your name rings joyously from the blue waters to the green treetops, and I am honored to be in your presence." He spoke in a solemn manner, one of deeper understanding rather than of empty pedantry.\n\n"Please rise, noble Pinekäbi." With a half-polite, half-intrigued smile, the princess gestured upwards with her hoof. "We bid you welcome with great pleasure and wonder what brings you before us."\n\n"I seek employment with the ruler of Aestlonia. My lone years taught me much of the nature of the fight, and now I shall give back a fair share to my home."\n\n"Consider yourself enlisted immediately by the monarch decree."

aestloniamonarchy.3.d:0 "It was rare for any Aestlonian monarch to venture out into the realm without organizing a proper royal tour, and stranger yet to do so only to solve a specific local problem. However, Zaida was not just any monarch. Moreover, there was something about the recent request from the port town of Merelinn which made her want to go.\n\nThe citizens, whose complaints amounted to weird noises and unusual movements in the water, were surprised and delighted to receive the full attention of the princess. Demonstrating understandable appreciation, they endeavored to meet all Zaida's itinerary requests and in particular set her up by the shore, in a touched-up mansion used to host foreign dignitaries occasionally arriving to the country via the town.\n\nOf course, despite the inexplicable attraction, the princess was not going to stay for long - in fact, her visit was just two days, one for the arrival ceremony and another for the inspection of the dockyards. Nonetheless, it was during the night between them Zaida found herself staring from the window towards the rolling waves, struggling to snap her attention away."

aestloniamonarchy.4.d:0 "Although the recent events did put some important questions on hold, Zaida was perfectly aware of the need to move forward. However, the new circumstances required a commensurate adaptation.\n\nOnce, she envisioned a grand political reformation, uniting the best aspects of the TBT and the AGWU. Erudition and tradition of the former, simplicity and communality of the latter, tied together by the loyalty to the throne could become an ultimate answer to the challenges of the era. Alas, this promising utopia was simply impossible to achieve now, with some inevitable favoritism which took place before the war playing only a minor part in the difficulties. Instead of a wild experiment, Aestlonia required a well-defined course to guide her away from the crisis, and the princess was responsible for being the ultimate pathfinder.\n\nThe significance of this choice could not be understated - Zaida was setting on the capital F future for everything from herself and the court to the entirety of her people. There was certainly room for maneuver within each faction, but the main direction, the principal advisory group, would have to be decided unequivocally."

Today she chose the ice sculpture gallery as the place for her deliberations, and while the daylight danced in bright colors inside their transparent forms, the princess considered the subject of this art. Many would say that it represented the essence of the culture of her people.\n\nHowever, there were ponies with very different ideas. The members of so-called "Aesgyptian Movement", a small but influential faction inside of the ascendant TBT, would call it just a circumstantial fad. Of course, their position did not end with this very specific remark, but rather it reflected the general radical attitude. Keeping up with the name, they endorsed the slow revival of the ways of the ancestral home, Maregypt, and rejected anything inherently Hestrayan. More zealous adherents even went on to speak of reclaiming the "motherland" and abandoning the current "temporary refuge". This semi-independent organization had sent emissaries to Zaida with a proposal for the new government built on cessation of the civilian administration in favor of a system reminiscent to the absolute power wielded by the monarchs of old.\n\nBacking this fringe group instead of the ever loyal Winter Qalam would be risky and unpopular not just with the TBT, but with the nation at large. An argument could be made that it would go against the core principles of harmony. Still, for the reigning princess it was a chance, one as rare as the ray of the sun falling down at a perfect angle to pierce the sweet spot on a statue, to achieve something truly incredible."

Each zealot we arrest becomes a source for Windigo insanity and a drain on our resources." Although she was clearly agitated, the deeply ingrained instincts caused Golden to stand at attention. "I cannot advise you to continue down this path."\n\n"I do hear you well, lady marshal. But you are surely not suggesting that we execute every potential member of the Millenary Path." Zaida kept a more diplomatic tone.\n\n"Not potential ones, no. Just those that are definitively in the ranks." The answer was completely nonchalant. "It's not like we lack evidence or confessions."\n\n"And my answer would remain "no" even with this... judicial restriction. Our people deserve a reprieve from bloodshed and violence. We must try to bring the wayward souls back to society, and as a ruler I must set an example for mercy and forgiveness." Speaking assertively the princess rose up from her chair. "This is my final decision."\n\n"Understood." Outwardly Golden did not flinch. "I would also like to report that one of the high-ranking cultists, a mare known as Snowstorm, remains at large with no tangible leads. This warrants increasing security, especially at court."\n\nZaida considered the advice briefly.

This was another notion Zaida was quite happy to dispose of, and most of the younger nobles were equally glad to support her. For this reason, her meeting with princess Ntrôm, a scion of the pre-exodus Maregyptian nobility, took the form of a trot through the crown domain, a pine forest on the edges of the city. Walking gracefully underneath the ancient, mighty trees, they quickly delved into a conversation.\n\n"You honor me, Your Majesty. Such interest in our legacy means a lot by itself, but a government position..." Smiling sincerely, Ntrom bowed without interrupting the gait. "It would be wonderful to apply my talents for the good of our homeland."\n\n"Your help will be invaluable, dear cousin." Zaida skillfully returned the gesture. "With you and the Aesgyptian Movement at my side, I believe that our nation is destined for a grand revival."\n\n"The Movement, you say?" The smile turned colder than the snow beneath their hoofs in an instant. "This is quite a surprise. I thought them to be rather beneath our position."\n\n"They share the vision of greater Aestlonia, do they not? A natural ally for our cause - of course, if there is anything I should know, I would appreciate your advice." Surprised, Zaida slowed down a bit.\n\n"Oh, they might be useful if properly applied. My issue is with the lack of merit in their leader." After scoffing indignantly, Ntrôm hurried to thaw back. "He is of no great concern. Your Majesty's control will ensure that.

With a stately nod, Pikhimphe caused his jewelry to ring softly. "I would like to believe that our exchange of letters entertained you in the meanwhile".\n\n"You would be correct." Throughout the past months, she had discerned a lot of passion in the polite words inkled in a stylized pseudo-Maregyptian script. Even before this first physical meeting he was not afraid to slowly but surely promote his ideas, some of which could be generously decried as too radical in the eyes of society. "We have a lot to discuss, and we need to bring noble Ntrôm up to speed."\n\nPikhimphe's reaction perfectly mirrored the one caused by the mention of him recently, but he followed it with a succinct explanation. "Ah, my dearest sister."\n\n"I was not aware of your familial relationship." Maintaining impassiveness, Zaida took a mental note to scold the intelligence office for this gap in her knowledge.\n\n"It is not a secret per se, my princess." He  glanced away for a moment. "She went to significant pains to distance herself from her own creation after it proved to be bolder than her. As I was left to lead this unjustly abandoned idea, I did not have a chance to change her mind among all my duties. The possibility to do so is most welcome.""

Similarly, his skill at explaining Aestlonian grammar, while not outstanding, was rather adequate.\n\nHowever, he started to question both his linguistics and pedagogy skills after the government imposed a new policy regarding these subjects. The new tongue, the new script, the new set of rules, all "Maregyptian-inspired", could be more aptly described as headache-inducing.\n\n"Mister Berry, sir?" Noticing his prolonged confusion, the student at the blackboard called out to him as tactfully as possible.

Yes, yes, yes, all well and good, a fine job by a fine princess.\n\nA cop-out, an easy way, cowardice even - those were the names her own ambition gave to the chosen path for the nation. It was very fine indeed, for a ruler happy to deal in average and mediocre, just another sovereign of frozen backwater. All the bold, far-reaching ideas and intentions, from Aesgyptian Movement fiery nostalgia to reshaping everything together with AWGU, were binned in favor of keeping it steady, worse, being a perfect continuation of her mother's legacy.\n\nRawiya looked down on her daughter from a majestic oil painting, or at least that was how Zaida could interpret her gaze.

There was an atmosphere of audacious courage about him, and as she came to know well in the last months that brazen attitude could easily border folly.\n\nInside the stone halls well-dressed valets escorted the monarch into a large chamber. The lavish room was positively brimming with noble and wealthy patrons of the cause, who fell silent the instant Zaida entered. She lowered her head, acknowledging all the reverent bows, and took the place for the guest of honor, successfully hiding the bewilderment from the fact that the prince sat directly next to his sister and that neither he nor Ntrôm showed any signs of usual aversion.\n\nPikhimphe overtook the proceedings with confidence. As he spoke, servants revealed a beautiful hoof-crafted map of Zebrica. Another one of their number, a pegasus, nimbly flew around, pointing at regions mentioned by the Movement’s leader. First came the boastful promises of uniting Hestraya - admittedly, Zaida approved of the idea - but the address did not stop there.\n\n"And from that simple foundation, we shall make a move both glorious and ever so desired! We shall cast this temporary refuge away, march north and retake the homeland in one fell swoop! Along you, my friends, I humbly seek one thing - the blessing from our future Queen."\n\nThe foreign title snapped Zaida out of shock. This has not been properly discussed! But now, all the eyes bedazzled with golden words were on her, and even Ntrôm smiled sincerely, as if approving this outrageous scheme."
aestloniamonarchy.11.a:0 ""My loyal supporters shall have it.""
aestloniamonarchy.12.t:0 "A Return To Form"
aestloniamonarchy.12.d:0 "For a ruling monarch, signing a document affecting thousands would quickly become a mundane everyday action. Nonetheless, Zaida hesitated slightly before committing to the plan laid down in front of her in white paper and black ink. The restoration of civilian control and abolition of wartime measures, a step back to the conventional system under the Advisory Council headed by the TBT - she knew she should feel relieved.\n\nThere, it was done in one almost peaceful stroke of the pen. The princess sincerely hoped that it would be enough to silence this urge gnawing at her, the desire to scrap all this democratic silliness and truly rule Aestlonia. Indeed, with each step of the servants summoned to deliver the newest royal act to Winter Qalam, the malevolent thoughts retreated. Soothed by the sudden release, Zaida told herself that it was exactly what she wanted - for tradition to be upheld, for citizens to trust her, for harmony to stay."
aestloniamonarchy.12.a:0 "Unfortunately, the darkness did not flee far."
aestloniamonarchy.13.t:0 "Promoting and Encouraging"
aestloniamonarchy.13.d:0 ""Your Majesty! Please, come in! Should I call for some refreshments?" Winter Qalam rose from his chair and bowed as respectfully as ever. Although Zaida was not too worried by the possibility, she was pleased to see that the new title did not seem to affect their relationship.\n\n"I appreciate the kind offer, but I am perfectly alright." With a nod of approval the princess further punctuated her satisfaction. "I am simply getting into the habit of visiting my prime minister on a regular basis."\n\nThe ceremony of Winter’s appointment was a modest, but dignified affair. Many members of the newly assembled Advisory Council were delighted by the outcome, and live broadcasts of congratulatory notes as well as of the inaugural speech by the stallion himself could be heard in every village and flat block across the country. Wishing to emphasize the partition of power, Zaida took only a ceremonial role in the proceedings, pushing a proper working meeting to a later date - namely, today.\n\n"This nascent tradition warms my heart, Your Majesty." He smiled politely, but with a tint of sincerity. "I can only repeat the past gratitudes. The wisdom you have demonstrated, the unity you inspire in our nation, the hope you have brought to the lands, all promise a wonderful future, and I am ready to serve it."\n\nThe wave of compliments carried the princess high, until it suddenly came crashing down with a single utterance, honestly meant as a crowning praise.\n\n"Your mother would be so very proud.""
aestloniamonarchy.13.a:0 "Zaida endured, but the shadows of doubt spewed forth."
aestloniamonarchy.14.t:0 "The Leaders Of Ponies"
aestloniamonarchy.14.d:0 "Despite some criticism, albeit masked by courtly decorum and reverence towards the victorious princess, Zaida felt confident about the choice she made. It was high time to show Aestlonia the full capabilities of monarchy in general and the reigning monarch in particular, with AGWU being the ultimate connection to the land and the populace.\n\nNonetheless, politics rarely presented a single straight road forward and there was another question to settle. Realizing Zaida's new leanings with remarkable swiftness, the Red Crown movement, a smaller socialist force within the nation, made an active effort to reach out to the throne. Their leader, princess Lumi, descendant of nobility Särav Org, had always been vocal about the possibilities of reintroducing and improving the ancient ways of direct cooperation between the aristocracy and the collective of workers and peasants. Endorsing her followers could allow for a smoother transition into a more equitable future as well as benefit from their pre-developed plans.\n\nAnother option, which made the already struggling cautious part of Zaida’s mind cry in desperation, was to get on with attending to the demands and needs of the AGWU as a whole. While it was undoubtedly bringing the princess closer to the common creatures, there was always a risk of too radical a change being introduced too quickly - but was not this exactly the point?"
aestloniamonarchy.14.a:0 "Our mares and stallions need a guide, not a comrade."
aestloniamonarchy.14.b:0 "We are going all in."
aestloniamonarchy.15.t:0 "Meeting Of The Crowns"
aestloniamonarchy.15.d:0 "In order to finalize the details of their burgeoning partnership, Zaida invited the leader of the Red Crown for an official meeting. A scarlet pavilion decorated with traditional ornaments was erected in palace gardens on her orders, and many talented adepts of "folk arts" were hired to perform for the two princesses - singers, musicians, dancers, ice carvers and more. Underneath the veil of vermillion the guest of honor and her royal hostess enjoyed a vibrant showing of rustic Aestlonian ways, but the festivities eventually gave way to business.\n\n"It was simply beautiful, my cherished cousin." Lumi smiled with an equal degree of grace and candor. "Many happy memories of my foalhood come from celebrations such as this. I am honored to be here, yet I cannot help but notice that there is something on your mind."\n\nCaught in a moment of contemplation, Zaida instinctively pulled up the impenetrable mask of authority. However, there was something about her companion which made openness a more appealing option.\n\n"I do believe that there is much we can accomplish together. Still, I wonder who will truly benefit from this cooperation." Seeing Lumi’s arising concern, she hurried to clarify her words. "Do not be alarmed, my remark is entirely self-deprecating. Such displays are the only window in the true life of our subjects I have deigned to look through till now. Can one with so little knowledge be a leader worthy of our shared ideals?"\n\nThe answer came with resounding determination. "Perhaps not from the onset, no. But you have made the most important step - and now I will do everything in my power to teach you.""
aestloniamonarchy.15.a:0 "Their work was only beginning."
aestloniamonarchy.16.t:0 "A Bold Trot"
aestloniamonarchy.16.d:0 "Although she had her own reservations, Zaida was willing to concede that the radio company contracted by the palace staff performed a spectacular job transforming one of the royal chambers into a broadcasting center. Unlike many fellow aristocrats, she welcomed technological advancement with an open heart, but the very message that she intended to send across the nation made her doubt the occasion.\n\nEverything was ready for the grand event, and the corporate liaison indicated that her majesty could start at her leisure. Still, Zaida felt in need of more assurance. Dismissing the workers and the servants, she summoned her newest advisor - just Lumi, no title - for a private chat. This change was exactly the one she hoped to discuss.\n\n"I find myself hesitating." Quickly dealing away with the greetings, the young ruler went straight to the heart of the matter. "There is power in words, and our positions bring gravitas, authority. I agree with the symbolism of casting them away, but why would anyone follow me as a common mare?"\n\n"It is important to take such a step seriously, of course. Still, the honorifics hold little substance. Take the society of Kelpies, for instance." Delighted that her example picked Zaida's interest, Lumi continued. "The translators called the one leading them a "queen", but no water-dweller would agree with our usual definition of one. She had no legal power, wielding trust and faith freely given by others instead. These mighty weapons are already yours, and you must be unbound to use them properly."\n\nOnce again, the ardor of her companion brought up the spirit of the princess-soon-not-to-be, and in another ten minutes the signal bearing incredible news soared."
aestloniamonarchy.16.a:0 "To a new Aestlonia."
aestloniamonarchy.17.t:0 "Warming Up To The Past"
aestloniamonarchy.17.d:0 ""So, are you going to finally tell me where we are headed?" Zaida was not terribly used to canters through the wilderness, but she was fit enough to keep up without too much trouble. "It's not that I do not appreciate nature. Very... picturesque."\n\n"Do not worry. While the forests of my home are majestic, I would not presume you would find them very different from the royal preserves." Chuckling, Lumi turned onto a path leading down to an overgrown ravine.\n\nWhile the younger mare did her best to hazard a guess regarding the final goal, reality managed to one-up even the most daring expectations. Performing a triumphant bow, her companion pushed away the final pine branches, revealing an unusual clearing. Underneath soft mist laid three small lakes, surrounded by snowless ground and filled with chirpily bubbling water. Before Zaida fully rationalized that she saw a simple hot spring, another surprise came down, or rather jumped in - leaving her coat behind, Lumi had already occupied one of the pools.\n\n"Come on, join in!" Giddy at the astonishment caused by her stunt, the older pony raised up a small wave with her hoof.\n\n"I... Um... Just like that?" Blushing, her companion made an uncertain movement, half-stepping forward, half-reaching for the clasp of her cloak.\n\n"Nobody's watching. And you would not be cold. Look at me!" Lumi snorted and winked. "Also, didn't you tell me you were interested in our customs? Best way to learn is to try." Noticing the bits or stuck hesitation, she risked pushing a little further. "Do not tell me you are scared?"\n\nThe unsophisticated, yet reliable bait worked perfectly, and soon the humble lakes housed both of the most important creatures in Aestlonia."
aestloniamonarchy.17.a:0 "They had fun."
aestloniamonarchy.18.t:0 "The Spark"
aestloniamonarchy.18.d:0 "The virtue of loyalty was an important cornerstone of lessons given to Zaida by the tutors her mother hired. However, the young ruler had always been headstrong. True, she did not feel completely at ease with leaving the TBT behind, but she would never call it "betrayal". She did her duty as the sovereign, and chose the path which would bring greater benefit to Aestlonia out of her own volition - would it be fair to the creatures in her care to discard such an opportunity just because of tradition?\n\nAs she gazed at the map of the South, her doubts quickly gave way to excited anticipation. The socialist movement would become a mighty force of innovation, and Zaida would be the trailblazer, the real deal, the pony who was brave enough to welcome this new world. Of course, such immense potential - amply fueled by the ambition running hot - could not be contained within the limit of national borders, even considering their recent expansion."
aestloniamonarchy.18.a:0 "To Hestraya and beyond!"
aestloniamonarchy.19.t:0 "Neigh Reality"
aestloniamonarchy.19.d:0 ""Finally, it is my greatest pleasure to announce that the Governorate of Eastern Aestlonia welcomes Ghuffar Eklim to the position of cultural ambassador!" The pony representative of the crown took a step back and pointed at a horse wearing simple Karkadannistani-style robes, who bowed deeply. "This initiative is but a single step towards greater equine unity throughout our beloved nation..."\n\nZaida was overseeing the gathering of hundreds of creatures from her private lounge erected in the corner of the town square. So far, everything went swimmingly, and she quietly mused if her advisors were being overly cautious regarding the rising troubles with the new subjects, and if her presence here was truly warranted. Then, in a blink of an eye, Tartarus broke loose.\n\n"Down with long necks! Karkads are bastards! Throw invaders out!" The hateful cries followed the erupted brawls like thunder comes after lightning. Although the police supplemented by her own guard swiftly descended upon the protestors and provocateurs, Zaida watched the violence unfold with stinging sadness and shame. When the order was finally restored, she knew one thing well."
aestloniamonarchy.19.a:0 "It was not over."
aestloniamonarchy.20.t:0 "Union Gig"
aestloniamonarchy.20.d:0 ""Sure, I'm surprised, your majesty. But I welcome the new duties." Steel Raud bowed without much flourish or grace, yet earnestly all the same. "I will work twice as hard to do good for all Aestlonians, miner’s word, rock solid."\n\n"I do not doubt it for a moment." Feeling encouraged by this declaration, Zaida confidently nodded. "This is precisely my wish and the reason for my choice: for the creatures of our lands to prosper."\n\n"Well, not to groom my own mane, but you doing what you did was exactly the thing. Of course, that's also another pickaxe in the shaft." The newest royal advisor huffed and tapped her front hooves, as if getting ready for something.\n\n"Please, I am all ears." The colorful expression was hardly familiar to the princess, and she chose to react with due caution.\n\n"Exactly. I mean, exactly, you. Ahem." The workers' leader grimaced. "This is big, your majesty. Many eyes are on us, on you especially. The AGWU is wary, but hopeful, and the same goes for me as their official representative. But personally I am all in, head to hooves."\n\nBy the end of this impromptu speech, it became apparent that Raud was actually making a smile. Her usual sternness returned quickly, but not before Zaida answered with one of her own, shining through the mask of manners."
aestloniamonarchy.20.a:0 ""We shall do great things together.""
aestloniamonarchy.21.t:0 "All Welcomed"
aestloniamonarchy.21.d:0 ""Alright, miss director." The reporter smirked at Steel Raud condescendingly, but she simply lifted her eyebrow. "Our readers have one last point they are very interested in. It concerns your recruitment policies for the Union." A shrug was enough to get him to press on. "Your organization claims to represent socialist ideals in Aestlonia. However, many creatures that have been given membership recently cannot be called workers in the natural sense of the word. Do you consider yourself a novel theorist of communism? Or is this a compromise you had to take on due to the recent changes of policies in Varjupaik?"\n\nWithout changing her expression, the mare took a step forward, causing the interviewer to instinctively back away a bit. "Underneath all that there is a fair question  which deserves a fair answer." Although she did not raise her voice, every new word carried a further spark of energy and fervor. "Yes, the miners and the farmers deserve support and our community depends on them. But what about independent shopkeepers? Librarians and forresters? Actors and poets? Do they not deserve real representation? Are they not as important for their fellow creatures who we strive to serve, for the culture that unites us? Please, go ahead - tell me who exactly should be excluded from the AWGU."\n\nBoth the verbal barrage and the sudden realization of Raud's sheer size made the stallion shrink even further. Looking up, he only managed to bleat weakly. "N-no one, comrade director.""
aestloniamonarchy.21.a:0 ""That's what I thought.""
aestloniamonarchy.22.t:0 "Regarding Concern"
aestloniamonarchy.22.d:0 "Just a few months ago a meeting between Zaida and common workers, not due to a special occasion or for some good publicity, but rather intended to truly understand their problems and needs would be just wistful thinking for Steel Raud. However, here and now, beneath the sooted roof of a smelter factory, she did her best to stay calm at this very sight.\n\nThe director was not worried about the princess' immediate behavior: the young monarch was learning on the fly and skillfully applying charm to cover for some gaps in knowledge of the common folk culture. No, the issue was with her attitude in general, as she faced her new "mission" with reckless abandon, setting up a visit after visit after visit wherever she was wanted, and there was hardly a place across Aestlonia which rejected the opportunity to host Zaida. With such a breakneck pace something had to give, and unfortunately the seams were bursting around security. Her majesty traveled around with minimal escort, eschewed screening procedures and despite Raud's numerous attempts to talk her out of such careless practices, was absolutely not willing to change her plans. "I trust my people", she declared proudly, "and they need to see this clearly if I am to receive their trust in turn".\n\nFortunately, another assembly was coming to a peaceful end. After saying her goodbyes to the awed crowd, the princess winked at Raud and grinned triumphantly, causing her older companion to sigh with a mix of incredulity and relief."
aestloniamonarchy.22.a:0 "When will she get that it can easily go another way?"
aestloniamonarchy.23.t:0 "Matters Maroon"
aestloniamonarchy.23.d:0 ""And what is that you’re doing, my boy?" Although Shiver Drift was hoping this comment had not been directed at him, the disappointments were far from over. An older stallion wearing overalls and a patched jacket was coming closer rapidly, appearing to be almost out of breath.\n\n"Loading up the fertilizer?" The burlap bag with a crudely scribbled symbol resembling "F" definitely smelled right, even though that could be said about most things in this barn.\n\n"Eh? That? Ooh!" The farmer by the name of Mottle Moss wheezed and cackled for some time, stopping only after noticing the growing concern on his companion’s face. "It’s peat. I guess all of our brown thingamajigs look the same to you city folks. You should have seen one of your lot dragging in an old wasp nest when asked for wood, poor clopper."\n\nOpting for caution, Shiver produced a polite laugh. This affair with the lottery to spend some time in a remote cottage - a recent government initiative to better connect urban and rural populations - was nothing like a vacation. Of course, he knew that this life required physical work, but the volume of labor and the complete unfamiliarity with its specifics was almost overwhelming.\n\n"So I’m afraid you’ll have to scoop that out of the barrel back in the sack and start again." Moss grimaced. "Come on, I’ll give you a hoof.""
aestloniamonarchy.23.a:0 "At least, the locals were friendly in their own way."
aestloniamonarchy.24.t:0 "Trying On For Size"
aestloniamonarchy.24.d:0 ""So, that's our great and terrible monarch." The pony before Zaida and Steel Raud snickered. "If someone told me a year ago I'd ever give any schmoozing reactionary a time of day, I would probably kick their teeth in. No offense."\n\n"None taken." Assuming a relaxed posture, the princess went for a suitably friendly tone. "I've heard quite a bit regarding the many talents of Raske Nael."\n\nA hoarse full-blown laugh followed, but the mare in question was not able to provide a punchy answer just yet, as the director bluntly interrupted her. "I'm sorry, your majesty, but I think it's best if I have a word with my friend here in private." She fixed her stare on Raske as if trying to restrain her with an intense gaze.\n\nMaintaining her innate composure, Zaida only nodded and stepped back, allowing both of them to move past her into the hall. Seeing someone larger than Raud was unusual and a bit intimidating, but she was also rather surprised by her strong reaction. After Raske shut the door behind them, quickly squeezing in an exaggerated eye roll, the young ruler remained alone in the room. Although she was able to while away the time by examining clippings of socialist newspapers and tank sketches decorating the walls, the dour expression on the face of her companion when the pair returned clearly indicated that their talk was even less productive.\n\n"Sorry. Matters of national security. Specifically, your security." Raske, however, remained perfectly cheerful. "And such a pretty thing needs that for sure."\n\nAfter exchanging quick glances, Zaida and Raud silently decided to let the odd comment slide, demonstrating, respectively, wisdom and frustration."

Sayif never had any ambitions to become a President, she still can't believe it happened, her inclusion in the electoral race almost being just a way to make the race feel more valid by having more parties involved. But enough of stroking her own ego, Sayif has a clear task she wants to complete as a "president", and it really doesn't involve much in the way of internal policy or reform, instead the main thing she wishes to do is to take out those who hurt Aestlonia and its people in the past. First she plans to secure Hestraya as a way to get more resources, also punishing Karkadannistan in the process. And, finally, she plans on ending Yeti rule over the Stormlands, that menace needs to be put down for good, and she will sacrifice anything and everything to see it happen."

Royal first takes it as a joke before saying he won't do it. Sayif says she doesn't care if he wants it or not, since, as she notes, she has info that he planned to coup her, and if he doesn't change that name she will act upon this information.

The army pony says that the country can't allow those who aren't aligned with the army to get in the way of future plans, therefore he will be replaced "for now", with the fake promise of being given back his position once the situation is better.

The scene in this event is with Storm Alsaqie being sat on her flank with ropes around her body, with the officer that drops her off asking why Sayif didn't order Storm's armor to be removed or why even wanted the cultist leader alive, Sayif tells the officer to leave without answering his questions. After he is gone Sayif slowly grabs and unsheathes a long sword that she had layed upon a table nearby inside of the generously-sized the two find themselves inside. The cultist simply looks coldly at Sayif, only blinking when the mare swung the sword at her direction, Storm gets mildly suprised by the fact she's still alive and unharmed after she opens her eyes, with the only thing that changed being that her ropes have been cut. Before the cultist can even act confused Sayif tosses her a different sword, by reflect the other pegasus quickly grabs the object with one of her wings. Sayif then commands Storm to stand up, saying she won't kill a mare in such a cowardly way, since she's better than the cultist and her flock, instead they will have a fair battle of skill, with the winner being the one left standing by the end. Storm surprisingly cracks a slight grin at this offer of battle and nods in agreement. The battle is very brief, Sayif has much more control and skill with a sword than Storm ever had, this being because Sayig used to love "playing knight" when she was younger, even got imported Griffonian books when she was older just to study the art of the sword and the knights. Meanwhile Storm only ever used daggers, and that being against ponies who couldn't fight back."

But Alter gets rendered speechless during the interaction in Sayif's office where she gives the businessmare a quite generous amount of bits, real Equestrian bits, as well as a new passport and ID, together with this bundle there's also a ticket for a boat trip to Equus. Sayif tells Alter to leave Aestlonia in the date written on the ticket, telling her to never come back or else she will have to act upon it. Alter asks why Sayif bothered doing all of this for her, considering the mares weren't exactly in the best of terms, Sayif looks away and blushes slightly, she tells Alter to just leave and to not make it harder on her."

Soon this new teacher starts talking about how crucial it is to know about the position of the army in the politics of the nation, this teacher points to the low-ranking pony and asks him what this position is. The pony scoffs as this one is easy, he says that the army shouldn't mess with the politics of a nation, that was day 1 stuff, to always be neutral and to always defend the country no matter what. The teacher quite loudly says that he is wrong and that is this type of thinking that allows for cowards and psychos to come to power as the army will always protect them. The teacher tells the pony to study more, specifically the new material that was introduced into the camp. The low-ranking pony says that this is ridiculous, but due to causing such a scene he is dragged out of the room."

Politics have been mostly stabilized, at least to the point Sayif cared about, now it was time to secure Hestraya before moving to the last step of the Yeti pacification plan.

In this event we see army ponies marching down a popular street in a big Aestlonia town, even dragging some artillery pieces wit them. Alongside them there are other lower-ranking ponies who are handing out pamphlets telling the populace about the coming war for Hestraya and why they should either join the army or buy bonds to support it.

Sayif has actually accomplished her ambitions of uniting Hestraya, something that the Princess was never able to do. It made the usually cold mare feel warm inside as she knew that used to be Zaida's dream, yet that cultist-lover would have to live with the fact that the pony who's warnings she ignored was the one to do it. She knew she would need to focus on the next step of the plan soon, but there's time for a little gloating with a side of champagne. Champagne is something Sayif never liked, way too fancy for a mare like her, but this one time she would allow herself to enjoy it."

It had been a long time since she was this happy about anything, there is even a little bounce to her step as she trots around the room. The war against the Yetis has started, and that's enough to fully defrost her unfeeling heart. The mare grabs what's left of that bottle of champagne she drank during the unification of Hestraya, she doesn't care for a fancy glass, instead she drinks it from the bottle instead until it's fully empty, all in a single breath. After she's done she throws the bottle at the ground and watches it break. Sayif refuses to stay inside while this is happening, she will go to the frontlines, she doesn't care if she dies in the process of this invasion, since even if she does, she will at least be able to drag some Yetis to the grave with her."

After the victory she was quick to move her administration to the so-called "Rainband", she wants there to be no chance of any Yeti taking this place back any time soon, this means she has to keep a very watchful eye over this cursed place. But that isn't the only reason, a good part of this decision was only because she wanted to show the world she had triumphed, while also further breaking the morale of the Yetis by showing that they had lost to a puny pony and were now "led" by one. Sayif can barely contain her overflowing emotions, she decides it's best to take a walk so she can clear her mind and figure out her next steps from here, these walks are a common thing for her. Some would say that this is a dangerous idea considering where Sayif is now located, but the mare's mind is too fogged by the feeling of victory to realize that."

Sayif is able to put quite the fight against the beast, showing that she isn't a pony to be thrown around, but ultimately loses to him as he simply is more physically strong and tall. Sayif ends up with her back against the ground, the mare closes her eyes and even cracks a bit of a smile, almsot like she's accepting that she fought a fair battle and lost, and now she's getting her just punishment of death.

She asks what he thinks he is doing by just standing there, she even gives him yet again another clear order to just end their fight by killing her, as it was supposed to be, but the creature just gives his back to her. Sayif gets furious and jumps to her four hooves like she hadn't just been in a fight, telling him to never give his back to her and demands to know what is his deal. This causes the creature to turn his attention towards her and approach the pony, he then pulls out a quite damaged piece of paper that he was hiding under his armor and hands it to Sayif who picks it with a wing. She checks the piece of paper handed to her and soon realizes it is a drawing, pictured in this drawing is the bust of a pony, one with a broken horn and a scar across one of her eyes. Sayif glances over at the Storm Creature, having to strain her neck a bit to be able to make eye contact, she asks who this is and why does it matter, the creature doesn't say a thing. Sayif makes a comment about how the creature doesn't talk much (mostly as a joke for herself in order to break the tension a bit) and therefore decides she will probably need to guess what this means."

This accusation causes the creature to show any kind of "expression" for the first time as he shakes his head. She asks if this was a rebel leader, the creature once again shakes his head as a response. Before she can ask again he simply points at Sayif and then points at the drawing. Sayif then finally connects the points and asks if this pony was some sort of commander, which the creature nods in response. Looking back at the drawing for some help she can't really figure out what armor the pony is wearing, it isn't one she remembers from any country around here, but soon she notices that it is a little similar to what the Storm King's yetis used to wear. Her final question then is if this pony was one of "their own", as in sided with the Storm King, the creature nods once more in a seemingly happy way. Before Sayif can make any more questions the creature simply pats her in the head and leaves, leaving the marshal a bit confused, but feeling a little inspired."

Instead she ponders back to the past encounter with that Storm Creature, bringing out the drawing of that pony once again from a internal pocket of her coat, she having kept it there ever since the encounter. Sayif stares at the drawing for a bit and thinks once more about the concept of a pony leading Yetis, maybe she could try to play a little nicer and lead these creatures? Maybe with her leadership she could direct their destructive potential into something better, something more. Sure, this clearly wasn't her original mission and the boys back at Hestraya might get mad at her slipping a bit into supremacy and yeti-tolerance, but she is the president and the marshal, only her opinion matters."

As of now the zebra is just sat at her office smiling to herself, she can barely wait to put everything into practice, even if it isn't exactly what the creatures of Aestlonia are expecting.

Amza assures Qalam that she will make it up to the harmonists when she has the chance and that she is fully committed to make it right for everyone, but as Amza says these words her eyebrows can't help but frown as if she's slightly annoyed to have to be doing this despite her friendly way of speaking.

Raud questions if she knows what the letter is talking about or if it's just a prank, Amza's stripes almost turn white from her shock as she lunges forward and takes the letter from Raud's hooves, she tells the pony not to worry about it and that this is clearly some reactionary element trying to take her down, she assures Raud that she will find whoever sent this letter and will "take care" of them.

Amza smiles in return, but not her usual fake smile, but more of a wicked smile of mutual understanding and recognition, Sayif is quick to make one of her own in response.

The zebra in question is a stallion, he acts in a really nice way towards Snow and promises that he is fully invested in the prospect of redeeming himself and making up for his mistakes, no matter the cost or punishment, Snow is still a little unsure about it, but due to how willing he seems to turn a new page she ends up buying what he's saying, after all Snow Qalam always had a thing when it comes to redeeming those deemed "too far gone", meanwhile Amza is just smiling to herself in the background, in a not so friendly or comforting way, but Qalam doesn't notice."

But now that barely matters in the mind of the zebra, what Amza is truly most excited about is to finally have the Great Lakes under her hoof. She has so many changes and reforms planned, some little, some large, but all equally as horrifying for those who don't know who Amza Outtara truly is.

But now ones question remains in Amza's mind, she did bring this city back to its old glory, better than ever before even, therefore would it be too much to rename it in a way that respects who saved it?

But before the scared zebra can leave Amza's presence she stops him, the smile on her face clearly not signalizing anything good or of pure intention. She demands that he stays just for a little longer, so he can help her decide on something. She states that she is torn between declaring herself the successor of Zondata, being the zebra responsible for much of the Mazwi's past greatness and expansion, also the one who formed the Sofa in the first place.

She will agree that their warriors were pretty decent, even caused a few of her own to fall during her pacification of the region, but it's clear that change is necessary. Either Amza could try to ally with some of these kingdoms so she can get her army trained by some of their warriors while also keeping the region divided, therefore making it harder for them to ever rebel as an united force, let them fight against each other.

It is very likely quite a few of them will die, but that is almost like a plus for the angry zebra.

But now she needs to decide what to do with this place, logically she should just get rid of any references to the old Zughe dynasty, get Zao a new coat of paint that fits the new state. But, there is also a certain desire to claim the Zughe crown for herself, just to add to the humiliation of those who live here, those who have failed to win once more.

From the sound of the conversation one could be forgiven for thinking that Amza would allow the dynasty to return and rule over their lands once more, but that was not the case, she truly wanted to nullify all royal titles relating to the Zefuwa as she believed having another crown inside her nation was a matter of concern, but, of course, she did not tell Gounama that, for now things would remain the same."

Slavery up to this point is already very much used by Amza, but now its situation as a practice has been truly finally cemented into society and the law with this decision, with no more loopholes being present to avoid it. She says this is a great victory for the entirety of Zebrica, as despite the effort from reactionary forces to stop it, the great revolutionary practice of forced labor has been secured, with she theorizing that in just a few years the Resurgent Mazwi State will become an example of the communist theory, being a state fully composed by workers."

But recently things have started growing sour in the town, the once friendly neighbors started acting more hostile to one another seemingly for no reason in the span of a few weeks, the word "traitor" was used quite a bit. The stallion did not understand what was happening, but soon he would get word that he had been "betrayed" by one of his neighbors, this news being given by a secret agent of the regime (the stallion does not know the one giving the news is connected to the regime). The agent says that he heard that they tried snitching on the stallion in exchange for easier workloads.

After some time of going nowhere Snowstorm decided to lay some paper on the floor, afterwards she started to trace out the shape of the numbers in black paint in each individual sheet of paper, after some thinking and observing she decided there had to be a hidden number between 6 and 7, this comes from the fact she thinks the transition of the number shapes was simply too radical, therefore there has to be something in the way to explain it.

As it seems neither Nebula nor Snowstorm had ever seen pancakes before, so this truly was a unique experience for both. Snowstorm says that she is not used to eat much, specially not this abundant amount of food (it's only a few pancakes), but she is willing to eat it due to the effort Nebula put into it.

Snowstorm responds by saying that it's a required step in order to make people more autonomous and less reliant on others, that way they're more likely to survive in the event of something similar to a Storm King invasion happening again. This is the only way to force people into self-improvement, as society makes them way too comfortable otherwise, she argues. Nebula doesn't totally agree, but at the same time the Kelpies did abandon both their old homeland and the ponies when the going got tough, so maybe this was truly the way to go about it.

As the other pony starts gloating and stops paying attention she quickly acts upon her hatred-filled desires by grabbing her caligraphy pen from her bag and striking the other pony with it.

He uses this timeless isolation to continue working on his so-called masterpieces, it being very hard to paint in the dark, but he managed to get used to it in his own way.

Snowstorm can't find a single thing in the endless dunes of Azir, all she is able to accomplish is to pass out on the sand due to the heat, this not helped by the fact she did not remove her heavy fur coat. This could have very well been the end of Snowstorm if not for a zebra wanderer that had found her just before she expired.

The cultist is clearly a little confused by her presence, but Amza's face suggests that this is all part of her plan, as she belives these two will get along together quite well. And it turns out she was right, for some reason Snowstorm felt quite comfortable around Azha, it's like they both recognized each other's freak just at a first glance, possibly due to the zebra's receptiveness towards her crazy ideas or even due to sharing those of her own, what matters is that the two of them quickly lost themselves in a child-like conversation about cool things they believe on. At one point Snowstorm even tries to "rub off" one of Azha's stripes to see if it would come off, Azha doesn't take offense from it, possibly because she was also interested to see the result just in case."

What matters here is even if Posada did somewhat like Nebula she certainly did not like Snowstorm and whatever she was doing back home, the meeting quickly turned from an uncomfortable encounter to a shouting match between the two, with Posada making it clear that what Snowstorm was doing wasn't socialism, communism, or even anything close to being left-like, instead it was pure madness. Of course Snowstorm doesn't take it that well. As this was happening Nebula did slip away from the meeting, being able to gather some information about what Hippogriffia was doing under Posada.

aestloniasnowstorm.52.d:0 "##TODO, Nebula had set aside a few days to self-reflect and to finally decide how they should move forward with this nation, it was a daunting thing to think about, but they finally reached a conclusion. In truth Snowstorm had done a lot of bad things, but between all these actions there was a bit of good that made it through the cracks, such as that railway she had built that helped to unite the coasts of Zebrica, or even her investments into research. Not only that but it seems she also had positively affected some creatures under her rule, like the giraffes who had expressed their condolences to Nebula hours after Snowstorm had passed due to the great autonomy she had awarded them, a similar pattern would repeat with the zebras of the Southeast, with the High Priest even coming in zebra to comfort Nebula a day ago. It was clear that Nebula needed to polish Snowstorm's ideology into something that would truly make Zebrica better, not only to help the creatures of this land but to also honor the legacy of their great friend."

Nebula knows that not everything she did was good for her subjects, but they simply couldn't betray their late friend like this, no, things had to remain the same, and they would make sure of that. They only hope one day the creatures of these lands might one day forgive them."

aestloniasnowstorm.54.t:0 "Back To Reality"
aestloniasnowstorm.54.d:0 "##TODO, Nebula considered Snowstorm a dear friend, but even they could notice how her policies were harmful to the people she once promised to serve. Seeing this they had no other alternative but to try to dial back the most extreme parts of the ideology she had set down but still keeping the general concepts in order to respect her memory. Mostly the Kelpie got rid of anything that seemed overly esoteric or harmful, while keeping the few good points and policies around, this should hopefully be much better to the general populace. Nebula certainly is no politician but they still think they did a decent job in polishing Snowstorm's idea of what socialism and communism should be."

aestloniasnowstorm.55.d:0 "##TODO, Snowstorm sure made it challenging for this nation to have friendly relations with anyone, but Nebula had done the possible to repair relations with countries that she had previously insulted, it still will take a long time to be able to proclaim that these nations are "friendly" with us, but it has to start somewhere. These past days Nebula is just going in and out of meetings with foreign leaders, so they're glad to finally have some down time, during this time they also decide to check back on the subject admnistrations that Snowstorm had set up and he notices some less than nice names, it's probably time to change those."

aestloniasnowstorm.56.d:0 "##TODO, Nebula was pratically done with all the reforms they envisioned for the country, but this did not mean there was nothing left to do, the Kelpie still had the book, the one that Snowstorm spent her time writing before passing. During all of the time they spent ruling the nation they couldn't stop thinking about the book and what they would do to it, obviously they couldn't allow it to decide how the government would function anymore, but it still was a hard choice for them to take, after all this was the only thing that they had left of Snowstorm. But the day finally arrived, it might have been hard, but the Kelpie finally parted ways with this book, leaving it in a very special place, that being right where the cultist had been buried, more specifically her gravestone. Nebula also used this opportunity to wish their friend one last farewell, she might have been crazy, but she still was their best friend here on the surface, and they shall miss her dearly."

aestloniasnowstorm.57.d:0 "##TODO, Nebula knew that as soon as they announced their wishes to continue Snowstorm's plans that sooner or later foreign elements would attempt to destroy what she had built, and if not that some of the more reactionary-leaning of the populaec would start to lead people down the wrong path. To avoid this they simply had to have a way to keep an eye on the nation, first they closed the borders and later the economy to make sure nothing could go in or out, now they needed to watch over Snowstorm's subjects in her absence. Due to this Nebula has created the Revolutionary Protectors, which will be those responsible for keeping things in line."

Now Nebula has a long road ahead of them, it is now their duty to diligently watch over these blessed lands and make sure that the great ideology is preserved now and forever, and they wouldn't have it any other way, they won't allow Snowstorm's legacy to die, no matter what sacrifice has to be made."

### Snow Qalam events ###
aestloniaqalam.1.t:0 "Pushback"
aestloniaqalam.1.d:0 "##TODO, event about the people not fully buying Snow Qalam's idea for an utopic harmonic society, in truth they do not think she will be able to deliver such a naive vision of a government and that she was just using it to get elected. Snow Qalam isn't happy about the people thinking she's a liar, but she's more than happy to prove them wrong with her actions."
aestloniaqalam.1.a:0 "They will come to understand."
aestloniaqalam.2.t:0 "From Beyond"
aestloniaqalam.2.d:0 "##TODO, Snow Qalam has a dream, she finds herself in a very ethereal-looking location, but her vision is blurry and only gets more blurry as time goes on, before she knows it she is completely surrounded by a pink mist that is covering all directions around her. She does not know what or who is causing this. Soon enough a voice starts booming inside her head, it isn't coming from any direction in particular, it's like it was inside her skull. Qalam has a hard time understanding what this entity was trying to say to her, but she did catch a few commandment-like instructions such as "redemption is the key", "ensure true harmony", and "the fruits of your labor will make themselves known at the Second Freed Creatures Forum". Qalam wakes up very confused before realizing it was just a dream, but part of her thinks this might have been more than just a random dream."
aestloniaqalam.2.a:0 "Perhaps I should listen."
aestloniaqalam.3.t:0 "My Promise"
aestloniaqalam.3.d:0 "##TODO, first speech Snow Qalam does after getting elected, here she speaks to a crowd who doesn't believe her promises and that are scared that is was just an electoral tactic and that things will go back to being like they once were. But Qalam makes sure to tell the crowd that she was and is serious about what she said, that she will work to heal Aestlonia's scars and bring about true harmony if the people are willing to give her a chance. She says that she is making a promise to them, one to finally end the cycle of hatred that not only dominates Aestlonia but this whole area of Zebrica. Friendship will come to the shores of Hestraya and everyone is invited."
aestloniaqalam.3.a:0 "I only ask for a chance."
aestloniaqalam.4.t:0 "Rethinking An Idea"
aestloniaqalam.4.d:0 "##TODO, the idea of uniting Hestraya was nothing new, technically it even was united under Arabian rule with its own puppet government. But in modern times it seems like more wild of an idea with how the nations of the region have drifted away from one another. Ponies like Zaida would like to think that they could simply ignore the cultural, ethnic, and political divisions and that it would all work out in the end, but this is not what Snow Qalam plans to do with her plan for an united Hestraya. She plans on making Hestraya into a nation that never truly existed before, one where concepts such as borders and private property would be remembered as things of an antiquated era, in her mind the only way to unify the Hestrayan peoples would be to remove everything that divides them in the material level. And only then work could be made in the societal level, else the reforms would be incomplete as the dividing factors would still exist otherwise, therefore slowly bringing society back to where it was with enough time. This is not time for being moderate, at least not on this matter, she needs to be true to her vision if she wants the most out of it."
aestloniaqalam.4.a:0 "A Hestrayan union can't just be political."
aestloniaqalam.5.t:0 "Maretonia Refuses"
aestloniaqalam.5.d:0 "##TODO, Snow Qalam event where Maretonia refuses peacefully joining Aestlonia, Qalam is conflicted about what to do, but decides she has no other option but to invade, she cannot allow the Maretonian leaders to stay in the way of true harmony, this is a necessary war for the survival of her Hestrayan idea."
aestloniaqalam.5.a:0 "It pains me to do this."
aestloniaqalam.6.t:0 "Expanding The Union"
aestloniaqalam.6.d:0 "##TODO, Snow Qalam is aware by forming a Hestrayan state that there might be those who only wish to hate even after the unification is complete, specially when it comes to racial differences. To remedy this Qalam has contacted the AGWU and worked out a deal with them, the Union will be expanded into the new Hestrayan territories as soon as Varjupaik controls them, that way they can work to help integrate the new creatures into the government and the workforce, hopefully avoiding any ethnically-driven conflicts."
aestloniaqalam.6.a:0 "Let's learn to live together."
aestloniaqalam.7.t:0 "No More Fear"
aestloniaqalam.7.d:0 "##TODO, event about a Karkadannistani horse being worried that he would be treated unfairly by the new government as he saw it as a pony-led state. He's specially worried that the ponies will decide to "take revenge" on his people due to what Karkadannistan had done to them in the past, but he's positively surprised when he got a pony visitor that asked if he wished to accept a position in the newly-forming Hestrayan union, this pony being someone who works with the state. He decides to accept and is happy to know that aid will also be delivered to his area soon, those being orders given directly by the president to help the new territories."

aestloniaqalam.8.d:0 "##TODO, event after Snow Qalam declares the Harmonious Zone of Hestraya, here the president is really happy with herself to have been able to do it, she's not super happy about the fact the unification wasn't fully peaceful, but one can't always decide how things go. She knows that she's not even close to being done with her plans for a truly harmonic society, the unification of Hestraya was just one of many objectives in order to reach the final goal, but at least now she can look beyond Hestraya as there is more of Zebrica that requires helping, redeeming, and fixing, specially with the Yetis being right on the other side of the border. And besides that, the unification of Hestraya helped to further prove the functionality of her system."
aestloniaqalam.8.a:0 "Only the start of our shared dream."
aestloniaqalam.9.t:0 "National Healing"
aestloniaqalam.9.d:0 "##TODO, event about Snow Qalam's plan to heal Aestlonia, she knows that it won't be easy but she won't give up on her nation that easily, she knows it is possible. Her first order was to increase funding for healthcare-related sectors of the economy, since before the metaphorical healing can take place a physical one needs to be guaranteed. The next steps are also pretty clear in her mind, she both needs to invest in the poorer areas of the nation so everyone may be in the same standing and also get to work in her redemption program idea, where she believes it is possible to make anyone "good" as true evil does not exist."
aestloniaqalam.9.a:0 "This nation will be allowed to rest."
aestloniaqalam.10.t:0 "After Darkness"
aestloniaqalam.10.d:0 "##TODO, Storm never thought she would return to a normal life, let alone return to a similar post she one day held. The ex-cult leader questioned if the soldiers would really want her back considering what she had done during these years of self-imposed exile. She did not wish to forgive them for the attack she had suffered in the past, but she realized that if she didn't do that first step then they wouldn't attempt to forgive her either, she had to show the same kindness that Snow Qalam had shown towards her. Once she arrived at the barracks she was ready to give a lenghty apology and speech towards the ponies inside but was surprised when she was received with a hug given by one of them soldiers. Soon most of the ponies present would follow this example, turning the hug into quite the communal act. Storm, not being used to this would slightly push them away, asking why were they so willing to forgive her, one of the ponies, speaking for the group, reponded that Snow Qalam helped them open their eyes towards what happened to Storm and that they would like to work out all the mistakes both sides had committed."
aestloniaqalam.10.a:0 "For the first time in years, Storm had smiled."

aestloniaqalam.11.d:0 "##TODO, despite Storm's change to the better she still remained quite the harsh and demanding military leader, as much as she was in the past, but this time around she at least heard to the complaints of her soldiers. Her work so far has been of great quality, helping to train the troops of our great nation to levels never seen before. This is shown in the event by she going a little easier on a cadet having a bit of an issue with the demanding training routine."

aestloniaqalam.12.t:0 "It's Never Too Late"
aestloniaqalam.12.d:0 "##TODO, Snow Qalam had kept in-contact with Snowstorm ever since she begun the process of bettering herself, Qalam grew to quite like the ex-cultist and was personally invested in seeing her do well. The President would find out that the ex-cultist was quite the curious and naive soul, she was completely enamored by everything around her even if at times she had some nonsensical conspiracy theory about what she was seeing, but that could be seen as a defense mechanism against the unknown. Today Snow Qalam went to visit Snowstorm in the educational facility she had been enrolled in, it was the end of her first week there so the President wanted to present. Qalam expected many things from the encounter, but not for Snowstorm to jump at her in a tight hug and start crying on her chest, at first Qalam got concerned, thinking something had gone wrong, but those concerns were put away as she saw the smile on the ex-cultist's face, all the mare could say was "thank you" over and over again between her joyful sobs."
aestloniaqalam.12.a:0 "There's no need to thank me."
aestloniaqalam.13.t:0 "A Friendly Jog"
aestloniaqalam.13.d:0 "##TODO, event where Snow Qalam meets up with Snowstorm once again, Qalam at first only wanted to make a normal visit but was convinced by the ex-cultist to go on a lengthy jog with her to enjoy the morning air and talk away. The President asks how Snowstorm is doing at the new psychiatrist that Qalam had arranged her, the unicorn responds that it has been going incredible and that she has been finally able to sleep normally without any night terrors after suffering with them for her whole life, and that she has even been able to walk around at night without having the unfounded fear of being followed. Snow Qalam is happy to hear all of this, but she does ask why did Snowstorm bring her all the way to the forest they were currently jogging on, the unicorn simply tells Qalam to follow her and shows her the entrance to a cave, inside the small cave there are plenty of crates filled with guns, Snowstorm tells Qalam that this is an old cultist stash and the she has no use for guns anymore and wishes to donate them to the army instead."
aestloniaqalam.13.a:0 "I'm sure they will appreciate it."
aestloniaqalam.14.t:0 "Questioning The Beyond"
aestloniaqalam.14.d:0 "##TODO, event where Snow Qalam meets up with Snowstorm once more, they have been meeting quite regularly at this point. The conversation starts normal but then Qalam brings up the dream she had, where she was contacted by a pink mist and told to remain true to harmony and herself, she asks Snowstorm if maybe this could some form of Windigo due to the way it behaved reminding her of how Windigos are described. Snowstorm says that she never heard of a Windigo acting in such a way, she does say that it isn't uncommon for them to enter dreams but they never would tell someone to do something "good" or selfless, she even jokes that maybe Snow Qalam "redeemed" a Windigo without even knowing. Qalam brushes it aside in a friendly manner, but the way of a reformed Windigo interests her quite a lot."

aestloniaqalam.15.t:0 "Ending The Schism"
aestloniaqalam.15.d:0 "##TODO, event where Snow Qalam meets up with Vastik Kabja, here she says that the Arabian ponies of Aestlonia have been treated quite badly as of recent history, therefore she wishes to give them more autonomy and to make their culture protected by law, even saying that she wants Kabja to help defend these communities for her, saying that his concerns about his community are completely valid. Vastik is very suspicious of Qalam, not being used to this level of benevolence and pleasantries, but he ends up accepting, he only hopes that his isn't some plan to backstab him."
aestloniaqalam.15.a:0 "Let's see where this goes."
aestloniaqalam.16.t:0 "For The President!"
aestloniaqalam.16.d:0 "##TODO, it had been a few weeks since Qalam had put her trust on Vastik Kabja to help her with protecting the Arabian communities, and likewise he also had put his trust on her to not betray him. Seems like things went better than Snow Qalam could have predicted as today a formation of many Arabian ponies presented themselves in Varjupaik wishing to serve in the army, they call themselves the "President's Most Loyal Arabians" or PMLA, and they're coincidentally led by a very familiar stallion with a dumb cocky smile on his face."
aestloniaqalam.16.a:0 "We wish to fight."
aestloniaqalam.17.t:0 "A Quaint Abode"
aestloniaqalam.17.d:0 "##TODO, Snow Qalam wasn't sure how her first meeting with Tume Koletis would go, the only thing she could really think about is how hard it would be to find common ground with the mostly silent stallion, specially since he decided to come wearing his iconic skull, maybe the rumors about he wanting to settle down were just rumors after all. But Snow Qalam would be quite suprised as the stallion was quite receptive to the idea of having a little place of his own, he even said that he would like to open a flower shop since he quite loves the plants that find a way to grow in the tundra, saying that it reminds him of himself. Snow was more than happy to comply with his request, days later she would hand him the keys to his new abode and shop, it was hard to tell, but he seemed happy. He even said that he would be content in serving the army in exchange for this great gift."

aestloniaqalam.18.t:0 "Making It Right"
aestloniaqalam.18.d:0 "##TODO, a meeting wasn't even necessary when Snow Qalam offered Mustsurm a spot in the new Grand University of Hestraya, the mare was more than happy to leave her old life behind in order to learn more about the world, but that does not mean she doesn't see the pain that she inflicted on others as a consequence of her old research, therefore, she wants to make it right to those she wronged. As of now, with Snow Qalam's permission, she already prepared multiple classes where she will teach ways to counteract harmful spells and how to look out for them, as well as writing a book on the matter so the lesson can be better distributed, and free of charge, hopefully reaching the areas where it's most needed."

aestloniaqalam.19.d:0 "##TODO, event where Snow Qalam calls Sayif over for a meeting at her house, the president wanting a more casual vibe for the encounter. Here Snow Qalam tries her best to convince Sayif to give the redeemed cultists a chance, even saying that if anything goes wrong she will asssume all guilt for the problem, but for now she just asks that Sayif gives them a chance, and if not for them, at least give Qalam a chance to prove her system. Sayif is conflicted and even a little verbally aggressive over this matter, but ends up accepting the president's request, if just not to see the president sad."

aestloniaqalam.20.t:0 "The Truth Revealed"
aestloniaqalam.20.d:0 "##TODO, event where Snow Qalam is shocked and disgusted by what she discovered about Amza Outtara, discovering that the zebra not only participated in the practice of capturing escaped slaves but even technically had some of her own, with some of these even having found their way to Aestlonia after she convinced them to follow her, investigations suggest that she is simply pretending to be a moderate socialist with Amza apparently having plans to reintroduce slavery to the Great Lakes if she had won the election for president, or so say our sources who are connected to Outtara. Snow Qalam now faces the hardest choice of her whole career as a harmonist, should she send Amza to prison and never see her again, which no one could really blame her for, or, should she actually give the zebra a chance to redeem herself? Wouldn't denying Amza a chance for redemption be betraying Qalam's own ideology? She needs to decide, and she should be careful, as this will prove how true she is to this whole utopic harmony thing."

Not only that, but seems that Qalam's gesture actually payed off as reports say that Amza has been going around the country helping the more impoverished community as well as dismantling the Crimson Sun, that being her own group which was comprised of ex-slaves and ex-Mazwi officials. The zebra called it her "official apology tour", claimign that she wants to pay back for everything she did to the best of her ability. Qalam knows that Amza is probably doing this to get in the graces of the public after her reputation was destroyed, but even so this was still a step in the right direction, as well as serving as proof that Qalam's system can work no matter how twisted the world might seem, as it was able to redeem someone as "bad" as Amza."

Therefore Snow Qalam decided she needs to work to codify harmony to the best of her abilities, utilizing Aestlonia as the place to experiment the system of a new peaceful world. It couldn't be another country, it's also the perfect place for it, being one of the few places where ponies would give someone like Qalam a chance, the country indeed might have its negatives, but it also has such a rich array of poets and dreamers that stood against the harshest of odds, these people clearly deserve to live in a system where they can finally rest and express themselves."

At first it starts normal by her congratulating Aestlonia for the great progress that it is doing when it comes to reaching true harmony and friendship, but then she takes the speech somewhere else as she starts saying that even though we have made ourselves better we shouldn't forget our collective misdeeds. Qalam says it's very easy to simply cast aside the wrongs we have committed and pretend like we are pure people, but that does not mean it is correct, instead she takes it upon herself to apologize to all of those Aestlonia has wronged. She apologizes to the Arabian community for the lack of attention they received over these years, she apologizes for the horses in Aestlonia that had to suffer due to ignorant people treating them as if they were the leaders of Karkadannistan and were responsible for that nation's actions, and she also even apologizes to the cultists, saying that such a group wouldn't exist if Aestlonia was a proper nation for its people, noting that this proves that the nation has historically failed a good part of its most vulnerable citizenry."

She says that she understands the pains that the people have gone through, even noting that she has also has suffered in a similar fashion when it comes to things like cultist attacks, but she also notes that the only to stop this is with understanding. She arguments that a cultist will never let go of their old life if they have no real way back to society, instead their choice in a way will be confirmed when they now only receive hatred with no possibility of return, basically trapping them in that position, and that's without even considering those who were born into that life without even having a chance to experience another reality. Therefore, the people need to open their hearts, and their minds, and need to let go of their wrath if they wish to finally free Aestlonia from the abuse it has been suffering, or to at least guarantee a peaceful future for their children."

Her reason to visit was personal, she had heard of it before and wanted to take a look about this almost legendary location, she had heard lots about if after she had returned from Equestria the first time and was just dying to visit.

Qalam knows that the country is in a bit of chaos now and the corporates probably aren't happy, but she can't help but smile, she was really doing it, a nation that never existed before, with most pure form of harmony leading it.

But, if she does wish to reach peak harmony maybe it is a gamble she should take, specially considering no one else will have the guts to do it, at least not a harmonist.

With this in mind she begun to come up with a plan for this corner of the continent as a whole. Obviously she did not wish to invade anyone, instead going towards the diplomatic solution where applicable, but there might be cases where war is inevitable, and in those cases it must be waged in the most benevolent way possible, where the civilian population is properly attended to. In the case if a military liberation of a nation she planned to set up a Zone in the new territories much like the on established in Hestraya where the natives could go back to ruling themselves under the watchful eye of true harmony. This is due to the fact Qalam doesn't only want to secure this are of Zebrica just to defend Hestraya, but to also help liberate it from the cycle of hatred that has dominated it for a good time, it's about bringing peace by ending the divisions and abusive reality it is found in, or at least that is what she hopes."

She says that the pursuit of true harmony is an eternal one, and one that can be easily undone if all don't dance to the same song, with the president stating that the price of harmony is of constant self-vigilance and self-betterment.

One question does remain in his mind, why do the police still even exist? At this point they don't have a purpose, it's not like criminality has been a problem in the recent months, but these officers still hold a great amount of power for some reason, he's sure Qalam has a plan regarding them.

For that reason is why the Windigo has ended all the puppet administrations and also decided on the idea to invade Hestraya's former allies, they argument that they can't be hypocritical, a world without borders means a world without borders, our so-called allies can't be exempt from that rule.

No, this can't be right, but Qalam knows there is little she can do about it short of starting a civil war that would bring many to their deaths. Therefore she has come to a choice, it isn't an easy one, but it is with a heavy heart that she declares her resignation from politics, at least this little act will let her ex-allies and supporters know that she doesn't condone this."

Maybe Harmony had done the right choice with their extreme plan to end borders for good, maybe it was the type of crazy and knowledge she simply didn't have due to her mortal limitations. Be what it may, Qalam has a hard time looking forward to the future, all of this system still doesn't sit right in her mind, as if the ideology of harmony was corrupted into something more akin to a cheap cult, she did hear that Windigos could feed from emotions and attention, perhaps it had something to do with it, but at this point the ex-president just wished to rest, she tried to do what was right and failed, no point in delving on it anymore, she had enough of politics for her lifetime.

But before she can continue her train of thought her thinking gets interrupted by a familiar voice inside her head, that being of none other than Harmony themselves. They note that they do appreciate Qalam's feelings towards them, but that she must remember that harmony should not have religious idols or "national" heroes, noting that harmony is the ideology of the common creature, of the great mass, everyone is responsible for the greatness we found ourselves today, specially Qalam.

We need to show that we are better than to employ such malevolent tactics as the previous government did."
AES_tume_saving:0 "Redeem Tume Koletis"
AES_tume_saving_desc:0 "Tume is a very peculiar pony, one that might seem like there is no saving, but there's certainly something we can connect with him on. Some say that Koletis wants nothing more than a chance to settle down and do their own thing, perhaps after we have proven our harmonic concept for the nation he might listen to us."
AES_mustsurm_saving:0 "Redeem Mustsurm"
AES_mustsurm_saving_desc:0 "Mustsurm is an odd one out amongst the ranks of the Millenary Path, being a pony that prefers magic and science above more traditional ritualistic ways of thinking and operating. Therefore we should try to use this fact to get her on our side, perhaps when we establish a teaching facility impressive enough to convince her to abandon her more twisted studies, instead focusing on using her mind to better society."
AES_sayif_saving:0 "Convince The Marshal"
AES_sayif_saving_desc:0 "It is known that Golden Sayif is quite unhappy with our policy of redeeming members of the Millenary Path, which is not a surprise considering her personal history with the cult. Even then, we should try to convince her to work with us, showing that her type of thinking only helps to deepen the divides of society, and if she truly wants things to change she should at least give them a chance."
AES_amza_saving:0 "Investigate Rumors About Amza Outtara"
AES_amza_saving_desc:0 "There have been some nasty rumors circulating about Amza Outtara, with some of them claiming her direct involvement in many of the unspeakable acts committed by the Mazwi Empire. We should investigate these rumors, even if it's very likely that they are false."

AES_investigate_griffonia_desc:0 "There have been rumors about a continent to the northeast of us, it is very unlikely that a genious such as our leader would not know about such a fact, but it wouldn't cost to investigate."
AES_the_tunnel:0 "Locate The Tunnel"
AES_the_tunnel_desc:0 "A few griffon intellectuals have told us about the existence of a tunnel that theoretically connects Lake Rumare to the outside ocean, being how Rumare gets their secret convoys to the open waters. We simply need to look into this."
AES_watertowns:0 "The Sacred Springs"
AES_watertowns_desc:0 "In the north of Griffonia, specifically in the hillpony area, there have been reports of several sacred springs that can greatly improve one's health. The springs are also given credit for helping with the fertility of the land. It would be a waste to not check this out."
AES_investigate_barrad:0 "Investigate Barrad"

AES_investigate_equus:0 "Start A Chapter On Equus"
AES_investigate_equus_desc:0 "The existence of Equestria and Equus as a whole is a topic that greatly interests Snowstorm, for most of her life she believed it was some kind of religious metaphor for paradise, but some have been claiming that it actually exists. No time better than now to investigate it."
AES_investigate_mare_statue:0 "Investigate The Statue"
AES_investigate_mare_statue_desc:0 "Being one of the first things that Snowstorm saw as she entered Manehattan by the water means that the cultist grew quite interest in investigating it. What kind of methods did they use to build such an impressive structure? And is there something hidden inside?"
AES_expose_the_faker:0 "Expose The Faker"
AES_expose_the_faker_desc:0 "There have been reports of a pony who has been given credit for first coming up with the idea of communism and socialism as a whole. We simply need to expose this obvious fraudster, as that credit clearly should go to Snowstorm instead."
AES_expose_the_windigo_sisters:0 "Expose The Windigo Sisters"
AES_expose_the_windigo_sisters_desc:0 "How come there are only alicorns on Equus? And how come that all of them come from Equestria? This clearly means one thing, these "creatures" are not naturally-occurring organisms, instead they must be of Windigo origin, as only that would explain their overwhelming power. Canterlot needs to know about the corrupted Windigo sisters, soon we shall bring them the truth."
AES_visit_the_town:0 "Visit The Town"
AES_visit_the_town_desc:0 "Ever since discovering Equus we have heard about a small town-sized commune that is popularly referred to as "Our Town", sitting just north of Stalliongrad. They seem to espouse an unique type of socialism called Equalism, this ideology preaching literal equality amongst all citizens of the collective. This does interest us due to our own ideological quest, therefore, we should attempt to visit this place."
AES_key_lake_excursion:0 "Key Lake Excursion"
AES_key_lake_excursion_desc:0 "There have been reports of a lake that creates monsters in the far north of Equus. We should investigate this source of paranormal activity in order to properly understand it. Some suggest that the great amount of crystals in the area might have something to do with it."
AES_the_fourth_continent:0 "The Fourth Continent"
AES_the_fourth_continent_desc:0 "With the discovery of Equus we now need to ask ourselves some important questions, such as, how did ponies get to Zebrica in the first place? It is more than obvious that there must have been some continent that connected southern Equestria to Maregypt and Hestraya. It is now our alien-given task to try to find it. Thankfully we have one of them to aid us in this investigation."
AES_the_lost_number:0 "Write About The Lost Numeral"
AES_the_lost_number_desc:0 "No concept is sacred, not even the numerical system we grew to follow as mindless sheep. There have been things forgotten by history, such as secret numerals that were erased by time, but Snowstorm shall bring at least one of them back."
AES_more_efficient_system:0 "Revolutionary Systems Of Measurement"
AES_more_efficient_system_desc:0 "In order for Aestlonia to progress in the world of today we need to improve systems that have fallen behind with time, even if they might seem perfect already."
AES_azirian_passage:0 "Investigate The Azirian Passage"
AES_azirian_passage_desc:0 "How come there are zebras all the way down in Southeastern Zebrica? The only way this can be explained is if there is a secret tunnel that connects Azir to that region, as Azir clearly is the farthest natural zebra territory before the disconnect."
AES_pyramid_mystery:0 "Investigate The Mystery of the Pyramids"
AES_pyramid_mystery_desc:0 "It doesn't make any sense that ponies would build giant pyramids for no reason. There's clearly a sinister truth behind it!"
AES_zebra_truth:0 "Finding The Truth About The Zebras"
AES_zebra_truth_desc:0 "Zebras are hardly different from your regular earth pony, both can do no real magic outside of forcing themselves to learn alchemy so they can cope with their talentless existence. This warrants some suspicion, are zebras really a race? Or are they just ponies who have painted themselves in order to appear more interesting? Whatever it might be we need to get to the bottom of it, thankfully Aestlonia has quite a prominent zebra general that we could accost for information."
AES_posada_meeting:0 "Meet With The Crimson Alien"
AES_posada_meeting_desc:0 "Posada does not fool us for even a second, it is clear that she's of extraplanetary origins, or else why would she be so interested in contacting her hidden masters? Perhaps she's trying to compete with us to get the overlords' attention. Whatever she might be or want we should still meet with her; with Nebula providing us with the much needed help when it comes to the underwater location of said encounter."
AES_ultimate_being:0 "A Creature To Unite Them All"
AES_ultimate_being_desc:0 "The arterial state will be one of many races, this is certain to cause some tension as our subjects become more diverse. Therefore, to remedy this, we should attempt to combine all species into one, this way creating a race that can help unite our people once in for all."
AES_transpolar_portal:0 "Locate The Transpolar Portal"
AES_transpolar_portal_desc:0 "Our theories suggest that the poles must be connected by a secret portal hiding somewhere within Pengaia. This could help explain the dubious historical migrations that happened in the region."
AES_storm_magic:0 "Learn From The Abominable"
AES_storm_magic_desc:0 "Even if it hurts to say the Yetis, or at least their old leader, had quite the mastery when it came to weaponize the weather for their own goals. We should attempt to learn from these terrible creatures in order to protect ourselves in the future."
AES_girafe_reserve:0 "Meet With The Giraffes"
AES_girafe_reserve_desc:0 "At one point Snowstorm believed that the giraffes were to be considered enemies, but reports have suggested that they're as oppressed as we once were. We should meet with these creatures to make up for this mistake."
AES_bring_windigos_east:0 "Bring The Windigos East"
AES_bring_windigos_east_desc:0 "The lands of Southeastern Zebrica are known for their unforgiving hot and humid weather, something that we, the speakers of the Windigos, cannot allow to stand. We shall start an operation where we will attempt to send some Hestrayan Windigos to the east to combat this."
AES_golden_city:0 "Matters Of The Golden City"
AES_golden_city_desc:0 "The Golden City was a sight to behold, but sadly the world wasn't kind or worthy enough to allow for its existence. As it stands the city now is no more than a pile of rubble, we should do something about this sad reality."
AES_reconnecting:0 "The Reconnection"
AES_reconnecting_desc:0 "Snowstorm has felt as if she abandoned the Windigos by going in her new extraplanetary path. They must be very disappointed, but hopefully it's not too late to mend their connection. Only thing is that the cultist will need to show her willingness to the rapprochement, even if it might cost her life."

In the case of Storm Alsaqie, the story is not quite so simple. Officially, she was declared missing in action while patrolling skies over rural territories, only to resurface a few years later. She came back a changed mare, nursed back to health by the Millenary path, and inexplicably arose to lead her saviors. Despite her outward indifference to the past, the tales of her prior interest in the arcane and its connection to the "accident" circulate to this day.\n\nAs the guide of the cult, Storm embraced some of the trappings of modernity, actively inducting into the faith those who would be considered outsiders by the traditionally frontier-oriented believers. This, however, should not be mistaken for a change in the brutal nature of Windigo worshippers, but rather viewed as a convenient tool to spread the influence of their morbid masters.\n\nWith the successful recruitment of several prominent Aestlonians, Storm somewhat withdrew from the public eye, allowing new disciples to deal with mundane issues.

AES_princess_zaida_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of May 987, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: Destined to become a princess from a very young age, Zaida ascended to the Aestlonian throne after the sudden death of her mother. While many of her subjects demonstrated steadfast loyalty to the new ruler, a vocal minority, including several skeptics from the royal advisory council, expressed doubts regarding her readiness to wield power over the land.\n\nRejecting the cautious option of assuaging their concerns, Zaida endeavors to take a more proactive and assertive approach to governance. With the survival of the country being the immediate goal, she seeks radical reforms to awaken Aestlonia from its stagnation and secure the future for years to come. Ultimately, her ambition extends to the creation of a united, powerful Hestrayan nation capable of defeating any threats.\n\nOf course, any bold action requires not only willfulness but also a degree of cunning. By maintaining a harmonious, regal facade and abstaining from bureaucratic or socialite distractions under the guise of utmost diligence, Zaida bides time and builds up strength, determined to surpass her ancestors and show that she is worthy of her title.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Scroup"
AES_winter_qalam_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 3rd of September 962, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: A trusted aide of the late Rawiya II and the chosen mentor of young princess Zaida, a prolific writer, and a celebrated politician - all these honorifics are carried by a single stallion named Winter Qalam. As the current representative of the "Towards a Better Tomorrow" party (or TBT, for short) within the Aestlonian Advisory Council, he strives to be a pillar of harmony in the country.\n\nThis desire is reflected both in his literary works, which promote a sense of unity between all thinking creatures, as well as in a soft-hooved, measured approach to governance. While he does not inspire the same zealous dedication to a single ideal unlike some leaders, and faces some criticism even within his faction, notably from the ardent republicans following his sister, Snow Qalam, Winter's non-confrontational methods and developed acumen provide a basis for cooperation across the ideological spectrum.\n\nIt is worth noting that his moral code is intertwined with and supported by devout belief in Dualism. Along with fellow adherents of this religious movement, Winter seeks to promote the core tenets of Charity and Brotherhood in the everyday lives of those around him, viewing these principles as means to ward off not only the evil in one's soul but also the tangible threat of Windigos.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
AES_golden_sayif_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of Novemeber 979, Ajloun\n\n§YBiography§!: A fierce protector of Aestlonia from threats internal and external alike, field marshal Golden Sayif has not chosen the warrior's lot, but followed it with unbreakable determination. As a young filly, she lost her parents in a Windigo cultist attack, surviving due to the timely intervention of a militia squad. The veteran officer in command chose to adopt the orphan, raising her in strict discipline and sharing his values of honor and duty.\n\nWith this upbringing, the military became a second family to Golden, the only one she truly knew. After formally joining the ranks, she demonstrated impressive prowess and strong leadership skills, quickly climbing the hierarchy of the nascent Aestlonian army. Her resolute ways, pointed political neutrality and hard-earned trust of fellow soldiers made her a natural fit for the commanding position.\n\nHowever, her career only emboldened the deep-seated hatred she had for those who destroyed her life and continued to threaten her homeland. Despite the National Unity Act allowing the so-called Millenary Path to formally participate in governance, Golden watches every move of the cultists even more intensely than before, ready to beat back their corruption with an unrelenting force.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
AES_steel_raud_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 22nd of Novemeber 959, Jäised Märed province\n\n§YBiography§!: They say few ponies could portray the essence of the Aestlonian worker as well as Steel Raud. Coming from a remote mining village, she toiled underground for the good of the community from a young age. As the years went by, Raud grew to become remarkably strong and tall, easily towering over most others, and she took every opportunity to use her natural gifts to help those weaker or less fortunate.\n\nWhen the mine ran out and was finally closed, the young mare already got herself a bit of a reputation as a local hero, one always ready to provide support, care, and, indeed, physical assistance. Raud traveled from town to town in search of work for several years, never settling in one place, but meeting many like-minded creatures, especially in the rising socialist movements. By demonstrating a certain talent for management, she directed their energy away from singular acts of charity and into a more potent global action.\n\nFollowing the signing of the National Unity Act and formation of the Aestlonian General-Workers Union, Raud, now famous nationwide was elected as its director in a landslide victory despite any perceived drawbacks, notably including her pro-monarchy position. Under her continued leadership, the Union has been devoted to protecting and uplifting the workers, successfully improving their treatment and conditions to a notable degree.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Moonatik"
AES_cryo_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: Unknown\n\n§YBiography§!: "Mere creatures cannot begin to fathom the thoughts of an ice dragon."\n\nAccidentally found by Princess Zaida during a caving trip, the ice dragon known as Cryo dismissed the terrified pegasus and allowed her escape with indifference, only for her Highness to return days later with a panicking linguist. The ice dragon slowly learned Aestlonian, and these talks soon gave the Princess the idea for an offer.\n\n"He loves military planning," she told her fearful military officers about their newest lieutenant, "And he'll boost recruitment!"\n\nTo Cryo's credit, his strategies conducted in war exercises would merit promotions, but nopony considered convincing him, out of fear or futility, that his "military planning" was mostly logistic coordination.\n\nBeyond the military, the ice dragon cares little for politics and speaks even less of his homeland. One occasion a brave-enough subordinate asked what other ice dragons were like, and Cryo huffed. "I had horns," he snarled icily.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Littlepudel"
AES_alter_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 1st of August 954, Manehattan\n\n§YBiography§!: It would be fair to say that Alter, a scion of the Tähenduses family, prominent in the corporate circles of Manehattan, was expected to show business acumen. However, it quickly proved to be potent enough to put a price on morals, bringing in the extra income at the cost of most prospective partners.\n\nFrustrated with "bleeding-heart sentimentalists", Alter moved for cooler climes of Aestlonia, hoping for fewer regulations and underdeveloped worker rights. While she found those and then some, the whole fiscal situation proved to be too primitive for a real dealer, which did not deter her in the slightest. The self-made mare poured her skills into reshaping the local economic landscape, founding Kapitali Finance Center and even collaborating directly with Rawiya II on market reforms, up to having her hoof in the establishment of the central bank.\n\nDespite initial successes, the venture could be hardly called smooth sailing, especially with the recent scandal disconnecting Alter from her own company due to claims of fund appropriations for personal projects. She has refused to comment publicly on the matter and seemingly took a step back, but money talks, and the whispers bet on her inevitable return.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"
AES_snowdrop_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of October 980, Järveääres\n\n§YBiography§!: The geographical location of Aestlonia determines many things, including the specifics of the roles employed by the royal court. In particular, it is the job of a pegasus by the name of Snowdrop to ensure that the weather management corps maintain a perfect balance between freezing, chilly, thawing and plain old cold.\n\nThroughout the years of service Snowdrop has been performing these duties diligently and with quiet pride in her aptitude. She prefers to work at night, when her weakened eyesight is not disturbed by aberrant lights and it is possible to fully focus on the art of wind and frost.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Opalradiance"
AES_kelpie_queen_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: First Cycle of 759, New Coltlantis\n\n§YBiography§!: The customs of the underwater folk differ from those of surface-dwellers in many ways. The one who is called the Queen by other kelpies is not a monarch, but rather a symbolic unifying figure, chosen by the three largest tribes in a popular election.\n\nEven though the position came with a certain power to lead negotiations with the outsiders, few expected the Queen to proceed with a large-scale contact with Aestlonians and the ensuing great expansion of the city of Zarmarej. Driven by curiosity and kind-hearted nature, they were quite happy with the outcome and interested in continuing the experiment, yet the threat of the Storm King forced kelpies back to the sea.\n\nAfter his campaign of terror was over, the Queen spent countless hours convincing their kin to attempt another emergence to the strangers above. A compromise had to be made in the end - along with the most perceptive watchers they would observe Aestlonia, reaching out only if the neighbors would prove their moral worth by themselves. Thus, they stand a hopeful vigil, awaiting a chance to truly bridge the two worlds.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Anastafury"
AES_frosty_chisel_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 7th of February 984, Whinnyapolis\n\n§YBiography§!: Passions could carry a willing creature to the strangest places. In the case of Frosty Chisel, an Equestria native and a driven ice sculptor, her inspirations brought her down to Aestlonia, the land of long winters and hardy ponies.\n\nWhile she initially planned only a short stay, the warm welcome at the royal court as well as the amount of cold matter available made Frosty reconsider. By dutifully studying traditional carving techniques under local masters and carefully intertwining them with modern methods and her vision, she has made a bold statement in the craft, creating impressive monuments celebrating friendship and harmony. Now, she stands ready to do much more for her home away from home.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Opalradiance"
AES_tume_koletis_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 2nd of December 967, Koolkøn\n\n§YBiography§!: In ancient times, there was only one option to advance through the ranks of the cult which is currently known as Millenary Path - demonstrate unbound fierceness and savagery to garner the favor of the Windigos. While the faithful usually adopt a more reticent approach nowadays, the old ways live on.\n\nTume Koletis belongs to the dark fellowship of creatures proudly carrying them in their hearts.

Still, even the most cynical observers have to admit that the change in Tume is not a ruse, but a genuine atonement spurned from the built-up mourning for the lost souls.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Blakasmoko"
AES_princess_lumi_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 14th of January 981, Järveääres\n\n§YBiography§!: Despite the great diminishment of Aestlonian aristocracy during Sa'adle rule over the region, many noble families of yore survive to this day. Unsurprisingly, the scions of these bloodlines find themselves the need to adapt to the current realities, and while some are destined to final obscurity, Lumi is renowned across the country.\n\nA distant descendant of the rulers of Särav Org, one among dozens of tribal kingdoms making up ancient Hestraya, she is greatly inspired by the unprecedented cooperation and mutual trust between her ancestors and the common ponies under their guidance. Using her considerable education and social pull, Lumi champions worker rights, collaborating with more open-minded unions. Recently, she has gone so far as to enlist in the army to "fight for her people", resulting in volunteer and donation surges.\n\nAnother passion of hers is preserving the cultural legacy of old Aestlonia. By supporting archeologists and scholars as well as promoting exhibitions and teaching courses, Lumi pushes for greater recognition of this area from the government. With the noticeable successes for both causes, "everycreature's princess" is rumored to be involved in negotiations for an official position at the Ajloun court.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Stardustspix"

For Pinekäbi  this wild song has led him to the darkest depths, but then the very same melody lifted him to the light.\n\nFor a young stallion in rural Aestlonia, especially one with a certain adventurous streak, it was only a matter of time before the true power in the region, the Millenary Path, would take interest in their fate. He was inducted into the faith among many capable colts and fillies, but when faced with its deep macabre secrets, Pinekäbi  abandoned the cult. Fleeing eastward, he took up a remote position of a ranger at the tundra reservations and did his penance by protecting the forests from any threats.\n\nPinekäbi valiantly kept his oath during the Storm King invasion and subsequent Karkadannistani occupation, becoming a prominent resistance figure. Indeed, many partisan squads found shelter in his domain, as long as they were not foolish enough to disrespect it, and many more yetis and horses paid the price for trying to do exactly that.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Stardustspix"

Her unique background and ample natural charisma have propelled her to the heights of the newly formed AGWU, while the stories about her past have grown into a legend.

Although she cares little to confirm or deny any of them, comrade Outtara is known as a steadfast proponent of social reform and greater equality between all creatures.\n\nThere is, however, a twist to Amza's past and her understanding of "greater equality". During her own servitude, she was a slave hunter and reeducator, overseeing the integration of the thralls back into the system, one which she deemed natural, inevitable, and efficient. Thus, with the "liberation" of the Great Lakes, her true plan is revealed: she shall distill the old ways into an ultimate cycle of bondage and labor.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Bunnyshrubby"

Raske Nael, a fighter with a short fuse and a heavy hoof, hears its hymn within the grinding gears of machines, creaking of threads and revving of engines.\n\nHer early years were spent in the Aestlonian countryside, and they brought Raske nothing but dumb labor, a distaste for farming life and folk traditions, as well as an interest in brawling. An educated city doctor could call it "stress release", but she was simply happy to beat down an occasional thick-headed pony, especially a cultist, as these fools were quick to yap against her reformist ideals.\n\nWith no desire or reason to linger, Raske worked hard to afford a ticket for a ship west, to Stalliongrad, the promised land of social and scientific advancement for all. Shortly upon arrival, she enlisted with the army and demonstrated enough fervor and perseverance to be considered for the role of a tank commander, before a quarrel (allegedly involving sergeant Nael biting her commanding officer) caused her to be discharged. Since she was a foreigner, this closed any other opportunities, so she had to come back, embittered, yet not at all disillusioned with the marvels of technology. Seeking a new place, she joined one of the small working unions, followed it into the AWGU, and quickly became an established figure within the party's radical wing.\n\n§YPortrait by§!: Ryanboi"

What started as a youthful desire to do as much good for Aestlonia as her decorated brother, Winter Qualam, grew into an independent strive to see the whole world brighter and kinder. Nowadays, after years of hard work and a prolonged diplomatic mission to Equestria, she leads the republican wing of the TBT party, decried as a gathering of naive idealists by more cynical statescreatures.

While undoubtedly useful when confronting a larger enemy force, those abilities are also reflected in his snarky and pushy personality, with "Royal Pain" being the nickname quickly adopted by officers required to closely cooperate with the stallion.

Unfortunately, his search for answers has led him to Amza Outtara and her growing movement of the Crimson Sun, bent on perfecting the old ways instead of discarding them completely.\n\nAfter the end of the Storm Kingdom, Yoro followed his newfound leader to Aestlonia. There he stayed outside of the public eye, occasionally serving the role of an envoy between Amza’s wing of AGWU and the military, but never expressing outright support for the communist cause.

The Congress was formed as a way to keep this unique identity alive, as well as give these ponies a way to have their concerns heard. Sadly, this hasn't proven to be very fruitful, the blame for this is commonly placed on Prince Lapis, as ponies believe his elitist and abrasive personality have doomed the Congress' acceptance chance by the general Aestlonian population.§!"
AES_communism_party:0 "AGWU"
AES_communism_party_long:0 "Aestlonian General-Workers Union     §gThe AGWU is Aestlonia's first attempt at moderate socialism. The "party" serves as a state-sponsored workers union. The Union itself was created by the previous princess as a way to appease the hard workers of the nation, as without their sacrifices this icy realm wouldn't have gotten anywhere. The AGWU's leader, Steel Raud, is one of the major supporters of Zaida outside of the TBT. Believing the princess should continue the monarcho-socialist experiment started by her mother.§!"

Being formed by harmonic-leaning intellectuals and political masters who were given a proper party as an effect of the Unity Act. Their leader, Winter Qalam, pratically serves as Zaida's second-in-command, even being responsible for helping raise the princess in her formative years. Even though the party is majoritarily monarchist, there are certain republican elements within it, these elements being led by the leader's sister, Snow Qalam. Even with this soft split, the party's goals still are to mantain the harmonic order in the Aestlonian realm, no matter in what shape.§!"
AES_fascism_party:0 "Millenary Path"
AES_fascism_party_long:0 "Millenary Path     §gThe Millenary Path is a fervent and controversial group of ponies who view their ancestors' exodus from Maregypt to Aestlonia as a holy event, believing that the icy spirits known as the Windigos bestowed the cold of Aestlonia upon them as a divine gift. These cultists worship the Windigos and believe that the spirits' presence and strength grow with desolation and suffering. As a result, they have historically engaged in violent acts, including village attacks, terrorism, and sacrifices, aiming to invoke the Windigos' power. Their activities have made them a feared and despised faction within Aestlonia, confined mostly to rural areas and, controversially, granted government representation in a bid for peace.§!"

AES_agwu_hestraya_updated_long:0 "Hestrayan General-Workers Union     §gThe HGWU serves as nothing more than a continuation of the AGWU. One now focused on attempting to get workers from all over Hestraya to join their expanded Union.§!"
AES_neutral_army:0 "APA"
AES_neutral_army_long:0 "Aestlonian Provisional Army     §gRecently formed as a way for Aestlonia to protect itself from foreign threats, the Provisional Army, as the name implies, is not a final solution for military issue within the nation. Instead it's a temporary last-minute fix to the issue, this being brought upon due to the Karkadanni threat to the east. The APA is not political in nature, having little interest in ruling the nation in any way. But, their leader, Golden Sayif, has time and time again threatened the cultists of the Millenary Path. It wouldn't be a stretch to say she might react poorly if they are given control over the country.§!"
AES_neutral_proper_army:0 "URAC"
AES_neutral_proper_army_long:0 "United Royal Army Command     §gThe URAC stands as a far more capable and disciplined force for defending Aestlonia and its newly acquired territories compared to the APA.

AES_fascism_hidden:0 "MRS"

The party prides itself in following the teachings, morals, and culture of the original Maregyptian settlers. Their leader, Alter Tähenduses, is not unknown in the political circle. Once being the founder and head of the Kapitali Finance Center, where she used to work directly with the previous princess before being kicked out of the Center due to suspicions of embezzlement, someone you could hardly call a religious nationalist personality. Due to this, most look to the party with concern, not being fully sure of what it truly represents or who's backing it from behind the shadows.§!"

AES_neutral_coup:0 "NUP"
AES_neutral_coup_long:0 "National Unity Party     §gEven if politically neutral in the past, the Aestlonian Army had to reimagine themselves into something of a political bloc after Golden Sayif launched the "Glorious Coup". The so-called party is nothing more than the political body for the military and Sayif. Their policies being decided by the marshal and her alone.§!"
AES_democratic_republican:0 "TBT-R"
AES_democratic_republican_long:0 "Towards a Better Tomorrow-Republicans     §gThe influence and popularity of the TBT couldn't be killed by a simple coup, and this shows by their newest iteration. Republicans always existed within the party, but after recent events their notoriety has only increased, leading to them and their leader, Snow Qalam, being given majority control over the party. They follow the same harmonic principles of the past, but now with a bigger focus in perfecting harmony as a concept.§!"
AES_communism_republican_long:0 "Aestlonian General-Workers Union     §gAfter Zaida's actions in the Karkdannistan conflict and the following declaration of the republic, the famously monarchist Steel Raud decided it would be best to step down and instead give control of the union to her number 2. That being the zebra known as Amza Outtara, an ex-slave of the Mazwi Empire that found refuge in Aestlonia after the collapse of the same.

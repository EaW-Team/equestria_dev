 ### FOCUS ###

 #Intro Focuses#
 YAN_solid_chaos:0 "The Zebridean Situation"
 YAN_solid_chaos_desc:0 "Ever since the Feathisian economy went into a recession, the Zebrides have been left adrift. The economy, which always was focused on providing for Feathisia's needs, has been sent into a tailspin, and the locals have become more and more unruly. Governor-General Dirk Loterijen has his work cut out for him if he hopes to restore order."
 YAN_calm_revoltists:0 "Targeted Arrests" #lower stability
 YAN_calm_revoltists_desc:0 "The independence movement, the "Kebangkitan" in the local language, is a many-headed beast, but there are loopholes in the justice system that would permit a more proactive approach to dealing with their leaders. Maybe it is to read the code of laws like Maar reads the sacred texts, but it is necessary for the sake of stability." 
 YAN_gather_forces:0 "Gather our forces"
 YAN_gather_forces_desc:0 "If this situation explodes, there will be blood in the streets. Hopefully it can be avoided, but Loterijen has no interest in dealing with maybes. Thankfully, the administration can still count upon the loyalty of some of the locals. If the situation detonates, this will come in handy."
 YAN_powers_of_governor:0 "Powers of the Governor" 
 YAN_powers_of_governor_desc:0 "This situation can not be dealt with under the normal legal framework, and Loterijen has written to the Feathisian Parliament to request emergency powers in order to deal with his crisis. The question is just whether the parliament will have the stomach to do what is necessary."
 YAN_industrial_spending:0 "Industrial Investment" #pp loss, maybe some political influence, he's making concessions to the lineages
 YAN_industrial_spending_desc:0 "The Kirin have been on these islands for centuries, and their "lineages" - extended families stretching dozens of generations back - are the single most economically influential in the region. They are also as deceitful as they are canny, and yet Loterijen needs whatever backing he can get. He simply has to hope that the snakes will be too fat and happy to strike."
 YAN_gathersupport:0 "Gather Support" #bit hefty bonuses
 YAN_gathersupport_desc:0 "If the isles would fall to the revolutionaries it would simply mean one elite being replaced with another, and the Loterijen administration is working hard to ensure that this fact is not lost on those who might end up disadvantaged if the Feathisian authority collapses."
 YAN_gethelp:0 "Seeking Help"
 YAN_gethelp_desc:0 "It's not a guranteed that with a fraction of public support we'll be able to maintain authority on the isles. However, if we could strike a deal with one of the local lineages' matriarch, Kudakelasi, it is possible that Feathisian dominance on the isles would not end with Loterijen."
 YAN_dire_news:0 "The Griffonian Crisis"
 YAN_dire_news_desc:0 "When it rains, it pours, and this holds doubly true for these accursed islands. With the news out of Griffonia, everything is coming to a head faster than anygriff hoped for. The Administration is bracing itself, hoping for the best and fearing the worst."

 YANintro.1.t:0 "The Colonial Governor" #Note, this takes place two DAYS after the first focus is completed.  #Loterijen
 YANintro.1.d:0 ""...and though the local tax base has remained largely intact, the absent economic support from Feathisia has left our budget to shrink with almost fifteen percent," the director finished his report."Thankfully, our budget remains balanced thanks to the austerity programs carried out through the last fiscal year, though the cuts have left a large part of the local population without access to most if not all government programs."\n\n"A temporary issue," Governor-General Dirk Loterijen said from his position at the short end of the table. The old vulture clasped his claws together as he leaned forward. "With the recent crisis, a lot of the smaller farmers are being targeted by larger interests to sell their lands. We should instituted a land purchase tax for now, which we can spin as something good to keep the lower classes on our side. Also, fix the tariffs for independent trading at three percent and sell the merchants something about predictability and stability. Those who are receptive can be given reduced rates on what we can still export, in return for a percentage of their profit upon sale. Lastly, appeal to Feathisia once again for a crisis package. Yes?" he continued, lifting an eyebrow at the director, who suddenly frowned.\n\n"Are we appealing to Feathisia for aid, while still skirting their preferential trade position, then?" the director asked for clarification, seemingly hesitating. \n\n"We are doing what we must to ensure this colony doesn't collapse," Loterijen explained, "Nothing of it is illegal, I extracted the parliament's personal confirmation of that a long time ago, and if they disapprove of my actions they can inform me of this after the crisis is handled. Any more questions?"\n\n"No sir," the director said, bowing his head and leaving, leaving Loterijen to rise out of his seat and walk towards the balcony where he looked out across the city of Beakavia. Tomorrow would be the twenty-fifth anniversary of his governorship. Twenty five years stuck on these blasted islands for the crime of ambition. Reaching into his desk, he took out a bottle of brandy and a glass."
 YANintro.1.a:0 "They won't be able to say I didn't do my job, at least."

 YANintro.2.t:0 "A Distant Thunder"
 YANintro.2.d:0 "The three young zebras were running up and down the stairs to the massive temple complex as fast as they could, sweat pouring down their faces as they struggled with the heavy bags of rocks on their backs. They were exhausted, and would have stopped to rest, were it not for the scarred old zebra - the Grand Tuan of the temple himself, Orangtua Yangmarah, sitting at the top of the stairs, watching them with a cane in his hooves. As they turned around and began down again, the Grand Tuan glanced back to see a newcomer approach from the main entrance, a kirin in griffonian clothing. The newcomer came up to him and kneeled deeply before sitting down by his side.\n\n"Rowdy disciples?" the Kirin asked and Yangmarah nodded.\n\n"Some take their duties seriously, some draw rude symbols in the dirt they are meant to sweep," the old zebra replied with a raspy voice.\n\n"Your grace, I once again plead with you to depart Pulalap," the kirin continued, "The Kebangkitan is growing stronger each day, the Feathisians are weakening. We could have risen up already, but we need your leadership! You are the only one who can bring everycreature together under you."\n\n"We could have risen up, and we would have died," the old zebra replied. "It is not yet time, even though the moment is drawing close. The Feathisians' grip on our lands are growing weaker each day, that is true, but action begets reaction. If we push too fast, too hard, they will rally to defend what is 'theirs'. That is why we must remain everpresent, but peaceful. Let them live with the tiger's glare fixed on them, but never give them cause to take to arms. The fangs will come in due time, and when it does, their grip will have withered away."\n\n"I understand, your grace..." the kirin said reluctantly. "Also should they still be running?" he continued, noticing how one of the students had fallen down from exhaustion. Yangmarah simply took his cane and whipped it against the stairs, making the young zebra climb to his feet in near panic at the sound and continue to run."
 YANintro.2.a:0 "It is all about motivation."

 YANintro.3.t:0 "A Dinner Party" #Kudakelasi
 YANintro.3.d:0 "The party was going well, with a murmur of conversations and music filling the air along with the smell of food and perfume. Hundreds of kirin from each of the four great lineages were gathered, and everycreature seemeed in a cheerful mood as they talked and laughed; at least if one only looked on the surface. There was more than one dance being carried out tonight, and Kudakelasi Pandai was enjoying herself immensely."\n\n"And what of the new tariffs?" she asked the young scion of the Tegas lineage after finally having managed to corner him. "It must be so hard on your people, are you doing all right?"\n\n"It is not too bad," the young colt assured her, "being able to predict costs across the board is helpful, and at least the Feathisians are amenable if you are amenable in return."\n\n"That's so good to hear!" Kudakelasi said in relief, "But is that awful Governor-General giving you a fair deal?"\n\n"The prices are excellent, all he asks is that you pay a percentage of your profits afterwards!" the young kirin nodded, making Kudakelasi smile and kiss his cheeks."\n\n"Your parents would be proud of you," she said before noticing something, "Oh my, isn't that young lady Mawar Pandai?" she asked coyly, looking to the young Tegas, "don't think I haven't heard of your 'trips'. But don't let me keep you, please," she said, half nudging the young boy towards the girl further away, smiling after them before turning around, her smile dropping."\n\n"Anggrek?" she asked quietly, her servant coming up silently by her side. "The Feathisians are getting their claws into some of the Tegas," Kudakelasi told her. "Make sure their patriarch is informed. Also, buy up what the Feathisians want us to sell on their behalf, undercut the other lineages if you have to, and sell it on at a minimal profit."\n\nWordlessly, Anggrek obeyed and departed just as Kudakelasi smiled to greet another old friend."    
 YANintro.3.a:0 "It's so nice to see you again!"
 
 YANintro.4.t:0 "Deep in the Jungles" #Semuakawan
 YANintro.4.d:0 "Deep inside the Wezulian jungles, the drums were roaring across the temple courtyard, with dozens of zebras and kirin both watching the scene in front of them in silence, where the lone griffon stood surrounded by half a dozen zebras and kirin, all of them dressed in black. At a sudden stop in the music, one of the zebras attacked the griffon, only to find himself faceplanting as the griffon sidestepped his blow, tripped him up and slammed his face into the earth. Turning up as one of the kirin came at him, he parried several rapid blows and kicks before countering, giving her a gut-punch the bowled her over.\n\nOne after one, the attackers fell, until in the end only the griffon remained standing and the scarred priest that had overseen it all rose up, raising one hoof to stop the music.\n\n"Cakarkeluli Semuakawan," he spoke, the griffon bowing his head before him. "You came here to prove yourself, and you have done so beyond any shadow of a doubt. You are worthy of carrying the keris, and we will hear the plans you wished to bring before us."\n\n"Honored Tuan, brothers and sisters of these islands," the griffon began, still breathing harshly from the trial. "For nearly a hundred years now, we have been slaves. Our homelands are cowering under the force of a distant conqueror who bleeds us dry. All of our history, all of our culture, beliefs and all that we are is inconsequential to them. All that matters is what we can produce for them, like slaves."\n\n"And you, a descendant of those very griffonians, would hope to resist them?"\n\n"I know their ways," Semuakawan answered "I studied in Feathisia in my youth, and I earned my honors in their military academy. Not that it makes me any more of a full griffon in their eyes, but it taught me how they fight, and how to destroy them. The Grand Tuan is biding his time, but if it explodes, then once again bloodshed will determine the fate of these islands. The question is who will fight for freedom, and who will cower in fear."\n\nAbout an hour later, the griffon left the temple, having changed clothes. Back in his uniform, Colonel Semuakawan of the Royal Feathisian South Zebridean Army looked to the setting sun. There would be blood soon, but by the Tiger he would not be found wanting." 
 YANintro.4.a:0 "Freedom or Death; Freedom through Blood."
 
 Indozeeb.2.t:0 "The Zebrides Tremble" #Griffonian Empire is in chaos, what to do?
 Indozeeb.2.d:0 "With the news of the Emperor's death, the Zebridean crisis is escalating swiftly. Between a collapsed Feathisian economy, a dead emperor and political upheaval there is simply no way that the balance carefully struck by Governor-General Loterijen can be maintained in the future. The natives are only becoming more and more unruly, and there's no telling what they might to if they wrest control of the region from the remains of a colonial administration. A new balance must be struck if Feathisian authority is to remain intact, whether it is through violence or through diplomacy.\n\nAs the meeting is going ahead, other powers are watching and waiting. The Grand Tuan of the isles, Oran Yamar, has gathered his own congress of native Zebras, Kirin and even the Burungbang, those griffons who have come to embrace the local customs and become not colonialists, but neighbors. The Feathisian dominance over the isles have gone on for long enough, and with all the troubles back in their homeland the colonialists are weak.\n\nMatriarch Kudakelasi - the closest thing to a voice for all Kirin on the isles - has maintained that if the Feathisians are given no reason to deploy violence then they will not: for all their hunger, their distant Adipati - the one they call "Grand Duke" - will not tolerate unprovoked violence. General Semuakawan - once an auxiliary officer serving under the Feathisians - dismisses these notions and calls them naive. Even his family, the descendants of Feathisian settlers, were branded simple natives not worthy of recognition for having adopted the Zebridean culture. There is only one language they understand, and that is violence.\n\nThe question will be which side seizes the initiative and manages to push to achieve its goals."

 Indozeeb.11.t:0 "Morning Preparations"
 Indozeeb.11.d:0 "Twirling around the dressing room in the early morning, Kudakelasi chirped with happiness at what awaited. What a lovely day it was going to be! Meanwhile, one of her nieces, Melathi, sat on a footstool nearby, having woken up when she heard Kudakelasi getting up so early and wondered what was going on.\n\n"You see, auntie has a really special task today, one that will help everycreature on the islands if she does it well!" Kudakelasi poured over her wardrobe, wondering what would fit the occasion. "Help me get dressed, sweetie? What do you think, yellow or red sarong?" Melathi leaned her head to the side before she in the end pointed to the red one, which Kudakelasi slipped into. "When you make a deal with someone, both sides should get what they want, do you remember?" she continued, Melathi nodding. "And sometimes, everycreature wants the same thing, but they want it in different ways."\n\n"Like food?" Melatih asked and Kudakelasi broke into a wide smile.\n\n"Anggrek, go get some bubur for us, I think someone is hungry!" she cooed, nuzzling Melatih as her servant left for the kitchen. "But that's right!" she continued. "And sometimes, some don't want to eat their vegetables, and that's no good, right?" she asked Melatih, who quickly shook her head. "Auntie is dealing with a very stubborn bird who really doesn't want to eat his veggies. She just needs to make sure he eats them all, but then everycreature will be able to get dessert! Which kebaya do you think I should wear?" she asked, looking to the blouses lined up for her. \n\n"Yellow!" Melathi said and Kudakelasi laughed, nuzzling the girl's mane again and thanking her for the aid. Today was going to be a good day she thought, eager for what waited ahead."

 ### IDEAS ###
 YAN_dutchoverlord:0 "Feathisian Overlord"
 YAN_dutchoverlord_desc:0 "The Zebrides have been under Feathisian dominance for nearly a hundred years, and its entire economy has been structured around providing resources for its overlord even if they technically aren't their servants anymore."

 YAN_pulalap_rebellion:0 "The Pulalapian Thorn"
 YAN_pulalap_rebellion_desc:0 "Being the most isolated of the islands, Pulalap is unsurprisingly the bed for subversive activities against the government. The radical aspects of the Kebangkitan along with the local preists hold large sway over the island. If we are to ever subdue the region and integrate it into the wider acrhipelago, the Kebangkitan and the preists have to be dealt with."

 YAN_shit_paperwork:0 "Cluttered Administration"
 YAN_shit_paperwork_desc:0 "The chaos of the 978 rebellion in the Griffonian Empire saw the colony becoming de facto independent from the Empire. And since then, the chaos brought on by the collapse along with the various rebellions has thrown our administration into a mess."

 YAN_tonguetied:0 "Tongue-tied"
 YAN_tonguetied_desc:0 "Compared to many other places, the Zebridies has been blessed with a series of cultures that brought on literacy. This blessing is heavily hampered by the fact that this literacy isn't in one unified language. With Kirinese, tribal dialects, Feathisian, and even Griffonian present on the island, the issue of illiteracy is compounded by our diversity in speech."

 YAN_angery:0 "Kebangkitan Nasional - Calm"
 YAN_angery_desc:0 "The locals are largely content with things, and Feathisian authority stands unchallenged."
 YAN_angery2:0 "Kebangkitan Nasional - Mild"
 YAN_angery2_desc:0 "The locals have begun chafing under Feathisian rule, and some of them speak of throwing the griffonians out."
 YAN_angery3:0 "Kebangkitan Nasional - Moderate"
 YAN_angery3_desc:0 "More and more, the locals are talking of rebellion. Some have gone further, and Feathisian security forces are on heightened alert."
 YAN_angery4:0 "Kebangkitan Nasional - Strong"
 YAN_angery4_desc:0 "Unrest is rife, and the administration is facing a genuine risk of widespread rebellion unless something is done to address the situation."
 YAN_angery5:0 "Kebangkitan Nasional - Extreme"
 YAN_angery5_desc:0 "The situation has reached a full-blown crisis. The islands are boiling with unrest, and the locals marshal themselves for war." 

 
 
 ##LOTERIJEN STUFF########################Until Line 490-ish
 YAN_loterijen_power:0 "Loterijen's Zebridies"
 YAN_loterijen_power_desc:0 "The Kebangkitan had their chance to arise and properly overthrow the colonial government, but their chance had gone and we Feathisians remains the master of the islands. \n Now, my vision will shape the island, as the Feathisians had once planned."
 YAN_convene_volksraad:0 "Convene the Volksraad"
 YAN_convene_volksradd_desc:0 "The Volksraad was an effort given by the Feathisians to make ruling the Zebrides easier and more equal. Its power had only grown since the Revolution, but everygriff knows who truly controls the Volksraad after the Kebangkitan's destruction - Me! \n And I aim to convene the Volksraad in the aftermath of this crisis..."
 YAN_contact_kudakelasi:0 "Contact the Chirmera"
 YAN_contact_kudakelasi_desc:0 "Despite us not contacting the head of the Pandai Lineage during the crisis, Kudakelasi has become the second most powerful creature on the islands since the destruction of the Kebangkitan's forces. With her sway over the Lineages and the sheer influence the Lineages have over the islands, it only makes sense for us to invite her to assist us in economical issues. Even if I have to try their Boreasforsaken tempeh..."
 YAN_break_rebellious_lineages:0 "Breaking the corrupt Lineages"
 YAN_break_rebellious_lineages_desc:0 "We have the Pandai on our side, but our alliance with her will not last if we can't deal with these more criminal elements within the Garang, Tegas, and espicially those damn Sopan! \n Kudakelasi has given us the green light to deal with their more problematic matters. It'll take out the dirt out of the clams, and we'll be able to snag a couple of their properties for our own needs."
 YAN_break_up_smuggling:0 "Form CTF 151"
 YAN_break_up_smuggling_desc:0 "Smuggling is an issue. Many ships carrying illegal goods and arms can dodge our patrols with ease simply by landing somewhere in our islands, and then transport the goods to the legal ports and spreading them to the rest of the archipealgo with relative ease. But luckily for us, all these goods all come from a single direction - north. With some good old legal readjustments and orders, combined task force 151 will focus on anti-smuggling efforts near the island of Pulalap! This might also give us a great oppurtunity to invoke civil forfeiture and seize any armaments we find..."
 YAN_reassert_control:0 "Reassert Control"
 YAN_reassert_control_desc:0 "As much as I would like us to throw everyone who even thinks about rebelling against us, we all know that isn't how things work. And if we did carry out, I might be the only one NOT in prison! As such, we have to figure out a way to reach out to the civilians and convince them of our good intentions in making the Zebrides a proper country. Lifting Martial Law and reinstating some freedoms will grant us a start to that."
 YAN_disband_independence_organisations:0 "Disband Problematic Organisations"
 YAN_disband_independence_organisations_desc:0 "The Kebangkitan could easily fool anygriff - perhaps even the Duke at De Vluegels - that it is a monolithic organisation with how cooridnated it is. But it is in reality a movement, a movement compromised of a plurality of public organisations. Some of which are simply more chaotic and rebellious than the others. Citing the old charter that gave us the ability to call on laws passed in Feathisia, we can call on the emergency powers during the 978 Revolution in order to disband these organisations for disturbing the peace. Who knew those rabbling Republicans ended up helping us here?"
 YAN_investigate_western_landlords:0 "Landlord Lamentations"
 YAN_investigate_western_landlords_desc:0 "As so in Feathisa, as so in the Zebrides. \n I'm pretty sure that is a false statement, but alas, just like back home, the Zebrides has its own stuck up, bottom feeding, treachous nobles! They call them landlords here, and they congregate on Ceram and Mareidia. They'll be an issue for any plans we have on those two islands unless we either take them out... or make them our allies."
 YAN_confiscate_landlord_lands:0 "Confiscating Crooked... Land"
 YAN_confiscate_landlord_lands_desc:0 "The POLKZ managed to get us some incriminating leads on the Landlords. Corruption, abuse of power, racketeering, and the list goes on for a good amount of the landlords. For these folks, we can easily confiscate their territory with ease. But some of the larger fish are much harder to pin down..."
 YAN_appoint_loyal_bureaucrats:0 "Appointing our Zebras"
 YAN_appoint_loyal_bureaucrats_desc:0 "With the Landlords removed, we need to ensure that such landlords cannot appear once more. With promises of pay rises and a few turned eyes, we can gather ourselves some loyal zebra bureaucrats to administer the western islands for us. Sure, they might be corrupt, but they'll be OUR bureaucrats."
 YAN_exile_intellectuals:0 "Exile Intellectuals"
 YAN_exile_intellectuals_desc:0 "Our disbanding of those organizations seemed to have not slowed down various intellectuals from critizing our regime. Well enough is enough! We're kicking them out! That'll give us enough time to shape the Zebrides into a proper country before a new generation of intellectuals can emerge."
 YAN_centralise_industry:0 "Centralising the Industries"
 YAN_centralise_industry_desc:0 "With the help of Kudakelasi, we managed to gain much sway over the industrial base - and the Lineages have gotten richer. A mutual arrangement if I've ever seen one. But we can go further, Kudakelasi wants higher profits, and we want higher productivity. We can do so by providing Kudakelasi a higher position within our government, allowing her more reign to cooridnate the nation's industry as much as she wants. Sure this may be inviting a monster into our ranks, but a monster working for us is still a win for us."
 YAN_rebuild_textile_industry:0 "The Textile Boom"
 YAN_rebuild_textile_industry_desc:0 "Kudakelasi has proposed massive investments into the textile industry of the Zebrides. A safe bet for any economy, espicially one likes ours. One might say this may be leaning on and providing the Pandai a massive power base, but a power base we need for the economy to be revitalised. Tell Kudakelasi that she'll get her textiles"
 YAN_invest_machines:0 "Akang's Stiching Machines"
 YAN_invest_machines_desc:0 "Kudakelasi's plans has run into a problem - we've run out of stiching and weaving machines! However, we've managed to get our claws on some up and coming machine producers of said equipment. One of them, Akang's Machines, are willing to work with us in order to remove the shortfall of machines and keep our economy growing. In addition, they're willing to cooperate and open some new plants for providing our military with some needed spare parts."
 YAN_fix_roads:0 "Patching up the Roads"
 YAN_fix_roads_desc:0 "Trains may be cool, but we still need ways for onhooves travel. A good step would be fixing the many, many potholes found along the roads of Ceram. This'll help in restoring some semblence of government authority in these regions."
 YAN_improve_market_connections:0 "New Maps and Ports"
 YAN_improve_market_connections_desc:0 "A common complaint we often get is that it the markets are often too small to handle larger cargos. Forcing farmers and workers to move to more larger ports further away to export their goods to the rest of the islands. Expanding our ports along with commissioning easy to read maps, we can easily remedy this stiuation."
 YAN_subsidise_new_markets:0 "Subsidising New Businesses"
 YAN_subsidise_new_markets_desc:0 "It's not easy starting a new business. As such, with some clever treasury bond trickery, we've gotten our claws on some additional funds which we can use to assist up and coming businesses and get them on their claws and get the money flowing in to the Zebrides."
 YAN_economic_liberalisation:0 "Economic Liberalisation"
 YAN_economic_liberalisation_desc:0 "The next logical step is further economic liberalisation. Sure, it is going to give the Lineages further power, but it minimalises the potential of corruption within the government, and allows us to focus on the more important aspects of ruling... I still don't like this, but its a must."
 YAN_land_approriation:0 "Tried and True Methods"
 YAN_land_approriation_desc:0 "The Cultursetsel system has often been deried as a horrible system, enslaving the natives and using them in large plantations in order to drive funds for Beakvia. But, if we implement some restrictions here and there, and pass some rudimentary worker laws... we might still be able to use them..."
 YAN_resource_exploitation_time_west:0 "Optimising Mareidian Production"
 YAN_resource_exploitation_time_west_desc:0 "The Islands of Mareidia and Cemar are one of the most blessed with the conditions suited to rubber plantation. We've never taken the chance to exploit them until those who objected to foreign owned plantations have recently been disposed of. With the right tax incentives and a few scratched backs, we'll have ourselves a booming rubber industry in no time!"
 YAN_resource_exploitation_time_east:0 "The Riches of Pulalap"
 YAN_resource_exploitation_time_east_desc:0 "The Island of Pulalap has always been resource rich. Its only a shame that due to its unique geography that a bit of an... stiff culture had been formed there. Regardless of how stiff it may be, we need those resources. A few dozen bribes, threats, and generous agreements would be more than worth the cost of the potential of steel and gold that we can extract from the island."
 YAN_improve_ports:0 "The Railway Stations of the Sea"
 YAN_improve_ports_desc:0 "When Grover the Fifth was out building railways connecting the capitals of the Empire's subjects, my wife often mentions how much easier it would be for some of her friends to transport goods to Griefenmarsch. Connections matter, but without the stations for such, it would never be possible - and the Zebridies have plenty of natural connections to be exploited. We just need to build a lot of ports."
 YAN_government_economy:0 "Increase Government Spending"
 YAN_government_economy_desc:0 "The solution to any slump in the economy is always more spending. And with the tax revenue we'll gain from the newly setup industries, we can move funds to assist some of the businesses across the Zebrides to help us out on some government projects, thus bringing wealth to the workers of the Zebrides."
 YAN_reopen_old_colonial_schools:0 "Reopening the STOVIA"
 YAN_reopen_old_colonial_schools_desc:0 "The School tot Opleiding van Inlandsche Artsen, or STOVIA, was established by an affluent philantrophist back in 957 to assist the severe lack of medical professionals in the colonies. Over the years, the concentration of intellectuals led to it becoming a hotbed of the independence movement and caused its suspension. But with most of the Kebangkitan suppressed, we can safely reopen it and expand it in order to cope with the demands of a more modern Zebridies."
 YAN_reassert_dominance:0 "Reassert Colonial Authority"
 YAN_reassert_dominance_desc:0 "Our embarassment of not properly dealing with the Kebangkitan, along with a many other issues, led to the deteroriation of our authority. We know that not the entirety of the Kebangkitan was properly dealt with after the crackdown at Beakavia, and this presents us a very unique oppurtunity to strike back against them to score ourselves a legitimacy win."
 YAN_buildup:0 "Expanding the Colonial Auxilary Force"
 YAN_buildup_desc:0 "Traditionally, only Griffons were only allowed to command units above a company level in the Zebridies. But with the severe lack of Imperial griffons, our only viable way to expand our internal security capabilities is to open up our military to the natives in even greater numbers. It would allow for more potential security issues, but that is a risk the administration has to take."

 YAN_break_resistance_desc:0 "The Colonial Investigation Command has requested for an operation to compile for us a Dossier detailing the various leaders of the Kebangkitan on pulalap. Such an endeavor will take a few months, but it will provide us a clear list of targets on the island in order to properlu pacify it. Once identified, we can deal with them. Permanently."
 YAN_replace_clergy:0 "Undermining the Clergy"
 YAN_replace_clergy_desc:0 "Professor Van Heutz has noted that the Clergy's role over maintaing order in Pulalp is something that we should take note to. If we can convince some of the more moderate members of the Clergy to assist us, and removing some of the more vocal anti-Feathisian forces, we can easily aleinate any remaining Kebangkitan cell on the island."
 YAN_investigate_temples:0 "Temple Cracking"

 YAN_move_increase_presence_on_pulalap_desc:0 "With the island's institutions now under our influence, we can finally enforce our laws properly on the island through the reestablishment of the Pulalap Garrison.

 YAN_restart_business_on_pulalap_desc:0 "'Pulalap - A Land of Oppurtunity for Brave Folks and the Spiritual!' \n With enough funding and public relations mastery, any destination can be an ideal destination.

 YAN_checking_with_the_landlords:0 "Kneecapping the Landlords"
 YAN_checking_with_the_landlords_desc:0 "Lord Martabak and Lord Kepleon are the most powerful landlords on the western islands. Local intelligence notes their sway, and potential for Kebangkitan sympathaties. If we can knock one down or bring to our side, the other will be force to dance to our tune lest they are removed in their outnumbered state."
 YAN_reorganising_western_organisations:0 "Reform the Ceram Youths"
 YAN_reorganising_western_organisations_desc:0 "In recent years, local politicians have taken up on themselves to organise various organisations across the Zebrides to champion forward various missions and ideas. One of them, located in Ceram and known colliqually as the 'Youths', had long been the more, dirty arm of Lord Kepleon's businesses. With him in our sphere, we can appropiate such hooligans for more proper business."
 YAN_survey_Zavan_conditions:0 "The Survey of Zava"
 YAN_survey_Zavan_conditions_desc:0 "One of the first thing the Feathisians did after landing and founding Beakvia was to set out and survey the land. We know now of its immense riches and the people within. But like all things, it changed. And if we are to properly exploit this land once more and make it a more modern island, another Survey must be done."
 YAN_arrest_union_leaders:0 "Arrest 'Corrupt' Union Leaders"
 YAN_arrest_union_leaders_desc:0 "In our resurvey of Zava, we've discovered a plentiful of union organisations burgeoning across worker populations. Such folks are well and good for improving worker conditions... but, it is a shame that this has to go hoof in claw with anti-government activities. If we were to engage in some, unconventional data and evidence gathering, Loterijen is certain that such activites can be paralysed with the right arrests."
 YAN_resubsidise_Zava:0 "Resubsidising Zavan Businesses"
 YAN_resubsidise_Zava_desc:0 "The chaos of the uprising in Zava has brought a dent to local businesses. But from the recently accquired financial resources from raids on the Kebangkitan, industrialists have proposed various locations across the island to restart their businesses, and their prosperity, is our granter for our future."
 YAN_influence_local_religion:0 "Puppeting the Clerics"
 YAN_influence_local_religion_desc:0 "The Clerics of the various religions across the Zebridies hold quite a sway over what opinions our people hold. This is elementary common knowledge. Some of our local collaborators have suggested contacting and providing some favors to these clerics in exchange for their support for our cause. Of course, officially, we won't admit to currying favor, but if it is to garner more support, than so be it."
 YAN_restart_farm_collections:0 "Limited Cultuurstelsel"
 YAN_restart_farm_collections_desc:0 "The Culturrstesel - or Cultivation System, was a method used by previous colonial-governors to cover the cost of the colonies. Despite only requiring 20% of farmland for cash corps, abuses in the system resulted in famines across the colonies and subsequent rebellions. We have done away with such systems... but the need for a new source of cash is still present. The Ministry of Agriculture has suggested confiscasting several farms of rebellious locals and using it for cash corp plantations such as coffee. The locals won't like it, but we need the money."
 YAN_islands_secured:0 "The Archipelago Secured"
 YAN_islands_secured_desc:0 "Through bureaucratic tricks, political crackdowns, backroom deals, and cunning, the administration has ensured stability in the Zebridies. But the future is still open, unguranteed and left to the whims of the world. Unless of course, we take to set it first."
 YAN_colonial_plan:0 "The Colonial Plan"
 YAN_colonial_plan_desc:0 "With the islands secured, our efforts are now moving towards to securing our economic situation.

 YAN_export_plan_desc:0 "With the islands secured, our efforts are now moving towards to securing our economic situation.

 YAN_demand_access_desc:0 "Since the Feathsians arrived in the Zebridies, they've always looked to the mainland for land to exploit. A century ago, they failed.

 YAN_invite_fea_corporations:0 "Invite Feathisian Businesses"
 YAN_invite_fea_corporations_desc:0 "Despite our de facto independence from De Vluegels, we still very much have plenty of ties with Feathisia.

 Indozeeb.108.d:0 "Loterijen despised the local cuisine. He disliked rice, he didn't care for the peanuts they had in everything, he couldn't stand the chilies and by Boreas above he despised that fermented thing, this 'Tempeh', they used in everything instead of meat! Not only did it taste vile to him, it had also left his stomach bubbling strangely for the last hour or so. A headache had long since formed, and though he kept away from the wine as much as he could, she kept proposing toasts!\n\n"But how is your Adipati doing?" Kudakelasi asked from his side, her face the very image of innocent curiosity. "With all that has happened, it must be so hard on the poor bird! And he doesn't even have a family, does he? But I heard, and you HAVE to tell me if this is true, didn't he use to be so in love with this one duchess? What happened between them?"\n\n"It is..." Loterijen said, pausing as something surged in his stomach. "...not my business to comment on the Grand Duke's personal life."\n\n"Oh but you are friends are you not?" Kudakelasi asked. "He wrote you such a nice letter, no? He really has such trust in you, doesn't he?" She smiled and Loterijen felt a sinking feeling in his guts, one not helped by the tempeh. She knew. of course this chimera knew!\n\n"If you are quite done," he said tersely. Two hours and first now she told him she already knew everything. His bargaining position worsened by the minute! "Maybe we should be discussing the deal at claw?"\n\n"Masaaa Loterijen," she said with a disappointed tone, "I know you're worried, but I'm here, aren't I, and you know we Pandai honor our deals. So tell me everything you are planning, I'm listening!" She almost chirped as she leaned in, all smiles, and Loterijen felt his stomach bubble once more."

 Indozeeb.1091.d:0 "His fine clothes were tattered and dirty, his gold jewlery was long since gone, as was his servants. Alone, he stumbled along the road, feeling the eyes burning on him from the village ahead.\n\nHow had all this happened? And how had it all gone so fast? All his life, all that he ever knew, torn from him in merely a few weeks. When the first rumblings of discontent had come from his tenants, he had brushed it off. Bickering tenants were nothing new after all, and those who refused to pay rent were expelled as was custom. And yet, then his servants had been found beaten bloody in the fields after they went to carry out an expulsion. As if that hadn't been enough, then news had reached him that his warehouses in Plumenbang had been burnt down, wiping out over a year's worth of produce. When he raised the rent for his tenants to attempt to recover his losses they had refused, en masse. Instead, they had marched on his home, kicked down the doors and thrown him out.\n\nThrown him out! He, whose family had owned these lands for centuries, thrown out from his home! He bit back the tears of humiliation and rage he felt. He was right at Lord Kepleon's estate... it was only a few miles left. When he got there, his old friend would lend him his own household militia and he'd be back, restoring what was his.\n\nHe was so caught up in his dreams of returning to teach his tenants a lesson that he didn't even notice the masked Kirin that was coming up behind him, horn beginning to flare with Nirik fire."
 Indozeeb.1091.a:0 "The Zebras are no longer supreme here."

 Indozeeb.1092.t:0 "Tar & Feather them!" #Loc for event tied to focus YAN_checking_with_the_landlords - Loterijen prepares to demonize/delegitmatize some of the middle class Landlords, he has to choose between two of them, either Lord Martabak or Lord Kepleon. Lord Martabak is overtly rich and his defeat will result in his fortunes ending up with Loterijen as Martabak tries to cling onto power by giving Loterijen Money. Keplon's downfall will result in more resources for Loterijen.
 Indozeeb.1092.d:0 "The campaign against Ceram's landlords has progressed well. In many cases, the trust between the landlords and tenants were all too easy to break. In most cases, dragging the landlords' various shady activities into the light has been enough to make the tenants enraged, and with just some additional prodding, many landlords have found themselves destitute.\n\nStill, the landlords have not been taking this silently, and two particularly notable figures have stepped forth to fight back. First is Lord Martabak, who is not only one of the wealthiest landlords in the region, but also the de facto owner of the city of Plumenbang. His household guard is well equipped and highly motivated, and he has not only managed to carry out any expulsions without issue, but also taken to patrolling the roads and shut down any attempted sabotages or bandit activity in the region.\n\nHe is joined by Lord Kepleon, who has maintained his grip on his properties as well through his charitable work and custom of taking in expelled tenants from other lords. After a generation of work, he has sold himself as a wise and chariable grandfather to most of the tenants.\n\nThey are each forming a strong link in the chain keeping most of the landlords from being brought to their knees. The question is which one of them we should focus our efforts on subverting. While Lord Martabak possesses immense wealth due to his influence in Plumenbang, Lord Kepleon's lands are highly wealthy, and are an equally tempting target." 
 Indozeeb.1092.a:0 "Lord Martabak's pride will be his downfall."
 Indozeeb.1092.b:0 "Let's rip down Lord Kepleon's facade."
 
 Indozeeb.10921.t:0 "The Standoff" 
 Indozeeb.181.d:0 "Our efforts to bait Lord Martabak has snowballed into a crisis. Our smear campaigns were meant to undermine faith in the lord and turn his tenants against him. When the situation escaleted and his guards attacked the tenants we could have interevened, protecting our citizens from them. Yet, even as tensions arose, Martabak's response was simply to double his guard force and arm them to the teeth, impose curfews and block the roads. His lands are now, in effect, under martial law. It should be an open and shut case, as his actions constitute armed rebellion, but he is dug in, and his guard is well paid and armed.\n\nWhen a truck convoy from Plumenbang was seized by the militias, local law enforcement responded swifly, only to end up clashing with the militias in an all out battle. Everything is spiralling rapidly out of control: unless we intervene directly we may have a large scale uprising on our claws. The Plumenbang garrison is placed on high alert and forces are being shipped in from Beakavia. Tensions are already rising, and the best thing we can do is stop the islands from exploding.\n\nYet, a proposal has been made to attempt to defuse the situation. Martabak knows he can't win a full on war, and he is unlikely to challenge us in the future, so maybe we should stand down, settle for order restored and a propaganda victory. We would have to drop our claims to his lands, and the resources spent would be lost, but at the same time it would calm tensions in the regions."
 Indozeeb.10921.a:0 "Beakavia will not suffer this challenge; crush him."
 Indozeeb.10921.b:0 "We have made our strength clear, that will have to do."

 Indozeeb.10922.t:0 "The Disgraced Patriarch" 
 Indozeeb.10922.d:0 "For all his semmingly noble dealings, Lord Kepleon is a landlord like anyone else. His religiosity means he has the local temples on his side, and his habit of taking in the expelled just means he has greater leverage over them as he is their last chance. Overall, when you pick at the edges of his facade, it starts unravelling quickly, and we've begun broadcasting these facts across his lands.\n\nSadly, the result has been mixed. While tensions have escalated in the region, many of the tenants are still clinging to their master, and the unrest has escalated to outright riots in some areas. Yet, there are as many pro-Kepleon riots, and his position might be less stable, but it is not unsteady yet. Lord Kepleon himself has made a great show of what a victim he is, holding religious ceremonies, doubling down on his charity and blaming us for everything bad that happens in his lands.\n\nIt seems that more drastic measures will be needed to deal with the situation, but the question is if that will play into Kepleon's hooves and paint him as a tragic victim. This would enrage a lot of creatures on the islands. Then again, the alternative is to back down. We could just 'encourage' Lord Kepleon to some land reforms in order to save mutual face. "

Land ownership was exclusively theirs, and few other ventures have been able to establish themselves, lest the landlords crush them. This has been the case for so long that to many creatures, it was just the way of things.\n\nAfter our efforts in the region, however. that dominion is but a memory. Whether through blackmail and smear campaigns, economic warfare or simply the threat of violence, the landlords have been cowed. While several of them remain, none of them have kept their old status. They are now subject to Beakavian law, and their land can be sold and bought as anywhere else. Most landlords have simply chosen to sell their property, with many leaving the islands, and their lands are now on the market, while the few that remain know well that Beakavia is the law, not them. There is grumbling, but the outpouring of support from the former tenants, who in many cases have become landowners themselves, has only served to strengthen our position in the region."

As with everything on these islands, though, we are left with a dilemma. On one claw, these issues need to be addressed and they need to be addressed decisively. We have enough information to attempt a series of targeted strikes that would have the potential to nip most threats in the bud. On the other, this would be a bloody and very controversial course of action, and there is a risk that we only cause further tensions.

 Indozeeb.3.d:0 "With all the recent troubles facing Feathisia, the question of the South Zebridean Isles has been left to the side for too long. For decades it has been a profitable colony and a good way to remove overly troublesome politicians. Its current Governor-General, Dirk Loterijen, was "promoted" to the position after his ambitious plans to have Feathisia seize a more central role in the empire clashed with the Grand Duke's longstanding friendship with Emperor.\n\nLoterijen has done a fine job maintaining the integrity of the colony, but things has changed and the already fragile stability in the region has all but collapsed. Loterijen has requested reinforcements and emergency powers to hopefully nip the oncoming crisis in the bud. The matter has been hotly debated in the parliament, with one side saying that if anygriff can make sure that the isles remain such a potent resource for Feathisia, it is him, while others say this would exacerbate the situation and that the Governor should be ordered to negotiate with the locals instead, lest we face a full blown revolution."

 Indozeeb.7.t:0 "Emergency Powers Granted"
 Indozeeb.7.d:0 "The Feathisian response had arrived that morning, and Governor-General Loterijen could sigh in relief. De Vleugels was committed to supporting his authority on the islands, and was transferring soldiers and equipment to ensure that the local unrest could be dealt with. \n\nSomewhat more annoying was the letter from the Grand Duke that currently rested on his desk. The Grand Duke had not silently sat this one out, but had instead written to him personally to tell him to "exercise the utmost restraint" and to "maintain not merely order, but as good a relation with the local populace as the situation will allow". "Needless bloodshed will not merely destroy what goodwill still exists among the locals, but disgrace our nation in the eyes of all those who value justice and the rule of law" the letter ended, Loterijen almost able to hear the Grand Duke's severe voice through the letter.\n\nWith the letter read, Loterijen calmly tore it up and tossed it in the waste basket, calling for the maid to empty it. Idly, he wondered if the emperor's death had made Gerlach forget why he banished Loterijen to the far end of the world. Feathisia had one chance to hold onto these isles, and Loterijen was not going to waste that by playing nice." 
 Indozeeb.7.a:0 "The Governor-General will do whatever it takes to maintain order."

 Indozeeb.8.t:0 "Emergency Powers Denied"
 Indozeeb.8.d:0 "Governor-General Dirk Loterijen sat quietly behind his desk, fuming as he read the message once again. It seemed that the Feathisian parliament was insistent on tripping him up, whether he was in De Vleugels or on the other side of the world. Not only had his request for emergency powers been denied, the Grand Duke had taken time out of his day to send him a message to lecture him on how to do his job.\n\nGerlach's message told him that "the current situation is indeed one that will require the utmost effort safely navigate" but stated that "an armed response would only provoke further unrest at a time where this can ill be afforded". As if to rub it in, the Grand Duke finished the message with "we are confident that You, as the representative of Feathisia, have the ability to address this crisis with a resolution that will benefit all involved parties, and will give our full support to whatever peaceful solution is reached."\n\nTearing the letter apart, Loterijen stood up and began to pace around the office. De Vleugels had spoken, and his claws were tied. With a sinking feeling in his gut, he realized what this meant. Feathisia had already lost the isles, they just didn't know it yet. He slowly grimaced before calling for his secretary to write a letter."
 Indozeeb.8.a:0 "Contact the Representative of the Lineages. Tell her we need to talk."

 Indozeeb.9.t:0 "The Zebridean Industrial Question"
 Indozeeb.9.d:0 "The Zebrides were never much more than a geographic term before the islands were united under Feathisian authority. Adding to this the mutual mistrust or sometimes even hostilities between local groups and you have a recipe for wildly diverging levels of development in the region. In one end stands Zava, which was quite developed even before the Feathisians established themselves in the region. In the other end lies islands like Mareida and Zimor, which has seen only very modest development even to this day, and where colonial authority is near nonexistent and tribal such is absolute.\n\nThis disparity has only grown more and more with the industrialization of Feathisia and subsequently the Zebrides, and the issue has gone from noticeable to pressing. If the Zebrides are to prosper then it must use all resources available, yet the cost of developing these nigh untouched isles will be immense."

 Indozeeb.10.t:0 "Not a Crackdown, but a Smothering"
 Indozeeb.10.d:0 "The Kebangkitan movement infests most of the nation, and one of its more common methods of resistance are factory strikes and protests. Economic disruptions makes everyone unhappy, but violence against the strikers will reap only fury. Thankfully, with the Lineages on its side, the government is not helpless. After all, there are many destitute zebras who have been left behind by the economic crisis, and though it will take some effort, these can be shipped in to replace the unruly strikers for the time being. Hired muscle will make sure that these workers are protected, and any violence against them will be loudly denounced through all channels. Our secret police will work to infiltrate the meetings and the rallies, picking out key leaders to "disappear" and make sure that their manifestations descend into chaos. Slowly, they will be brought to the brink of desperation, having to choose between going back to work or take to violence. When the latter happens, they will be crushed by whatever means necessary, but only them. Up until then, the average Zebridean will see the chaotic strikes slowly descend into anarchy and a government who acted only when pushed far enough."

However they came though, they were now, centuries later, part of the very fabric of the islands' society, and no facet of the Kirin more so than the Lineages. These extended weaves of familial bonds, be it by blood, marriage or adoption, were akin to small states within the state, wielding immense influence and wealth both, and none so more than the Pandai. This mighty lineage and its matriarch - Kudakelasi Pandai - stood as the queen of commerce on the central islands.\n\nIf this hadn't been the case, Governor Loterijen would have stayed as far away from her as possible. He did not enjoy dealing with her for the same reason that he did not enjoy being trapped in quicksand, and yet he was in a position where dealing with her was unavoidable. If he was meant to navigate the situation, he needed allies, and she was his best bet.\n\nThus, he smiled forcedly as she came into his office, accompanied by a gaggle of attendants, relatives and even a couple of children. He didn't protest when she kissed his cheeks in greeting as if he was a damned Wingbardian, nor did he have her posse thrown out the door (or maybe even the window) when they half transformed the meeting room into a dining hall, buffet and everything.\n\nHe knew how they operated, and he stiffly accepted the offering of food even as he saw the gleam in Kudakelasi's eyes. She knew he wouldn't be so easy as to be softened up with food and drink. He knew that she knew. She knew that he knew. Thus, as he was forced to raise the cup shoved into his claw in a toast, he braced himself for simultaneously navigate their strange cuisine and the twisty mind of the merchant queen."

 YANintro.5.t:0 "Inviting the Chimera"
 YANintro.5.d:0 "In his more resigned moments, Loterijen despised the islanders. Their weird customs and irrational beliefs clashed with everything he knew, and though he had achieved much in his time here, he knew how precarious his position was. With everything going on back home, and the way the government had tied his claws, he needed popular support, and he needed it more than anything else. He just really didn't like the obvious answer.\n\nThe Kebangkitan - the Zebridean nationalist movement - had three facets, and only one of them would be amenable to his overtures as it stood. The old believers, especially the Thunder Tiger cultists, had been relentlessly opposed to Feathisian overlordship since day one, and there was no reason to imagine that creatures who ritually scarred themselves were going to be open to discussion. He could manage the cultists though, it was the festering disease at the very heart of the Royal Feathisian South Zebrides Army that was the biggest issue. He guessed that was when happened when you armed locals to aid you; they would want to turn the weapons against you in the end. That group was a prime source of violence, and dismissing them wouldn't solve anything. That only left the local elites that had been empowered due to their cooperation with Feathisian authorities... and that meant that he needed Kudakelasi.\n\nThere was a price to professionalism, and personal dislikes had to be left at the door in order to achieve the results needed. That was why he had ended up here, after all, he didn't believe in personal friendships within politics and had said as much. And yet that cut both ways, and now he was left having to court the chimera. Sighing deeply, he hid his face in his claws as he braced himself for the inevitable."

Semuakawan drawled. "It doesn't hurt your own position either. You claim to fight for freedom, even as you just fortify your own position and commit to nothing."\n\n"I think he will find that attempting to pet me will lead to severe burns," Kudakelasi smiled, even though she wanted to scratch the griffon's eyes out. "But I really don't know where your rudeness comes from, little bird. Is that your Feathisian manners still haunting you?"\n\n"Enough," the low growl left both of them falling quiet and the old zebra fixed Kudakelasi with a glare. "Explain yourself."\n\n"Everything was not great before the Feathisians arrived." She bowed her head. "And everything will not be great simply because they are expelled. The Zebrides have always changed, and it is their rule that helped birth the idea of the Zebrides as one. They gave us countless woes, but they gave us many gifts as well. Instead of tearing them down and building something new, I want to make sure they share the house they built."\n\n"Even if we remain in bondage?" Orangtua Yangmarah asked sternly.\n\n"Collars can be torn off or wiggled out of," Kudakelasi elaborated. "If Loterijen depends on me, he will have to give something in return.

With the governor-general's approval, I hope to touch on these things." Looking to Loterijen, she watched him nod, and she bowed her head in response.\n\n"When my ancestors arrived in these lands, we came as traders, yet over time we settled in, and came to call it our home. Over time, barbarians from the far north came and settled as well," she continued, smiling coyly as she noticed the displeased looks on the feathisians, "Yet as it turned out, the barbarians we hoped to use came to outplay us, and in turn, their time came to rule as well."\n\n"Each of us have added something to these islands, and yet so many of our people are still bereft of the care and opportunities they should be offered. Countless are scraping by as day labourers or tenant farmers, legally prohibited from purchasing property and unable to better their lot in life due to poverty. Tens of thousands remain isolated in their distant tribes, facing the restrictions imposed upon them by our laws and our guns, yet without the protection the same would offer them. Beakavia is a wonderous city, yet how many are living in thatched huts and wander along dirt roads since we have chosen to still think of ourselves as merchant city states?"\n\n"We have the wealth, we have the knowledge, and we have the industriousness. With all this combined, we can build the Zebrides not as a kingdom of rulers and servants, but as a family where we all take care of each other, we all contribute, and we all rally to face the challenges that lie before us both today and in the future."

 YAN_great_game_category_desc:0 "In the Zebridies, there are three §Cmain groups§! that Kudakelasi may pay attention to if she is to maintain control. Unlike in other situations, Kudakelasi must balance the support from these three groups, lest she throw the Zebridies into instability and throw her plans for the archipelago to the dogs. \n\n  Support within the Volksraad and the Bureaucracy is at §C[?YAN_sistem_support_kuda]%!§! \n Support within the Kebangkitan Movement is at §R[?YAN_independence_support_kuda]%!§! \n  Support within the Lineages is at §G[?YAN_lineage_support_kuda]%!§!"

 YAN_lineage_time_category:0 "Managing the Lineages"
 YAN_lineage_time_category_desc:0 "When the Silence blanketed Kiria, some decided not to accept such a reality and fled southwards, some to the nations of South East of Kiria, and some came to the Zebridies. The Kirins here have adopted the local way of life, becoming merchants who built §YLineages§! around their family line, practically a micro state within the Feathisian Zebridies. However over time, most Lineages were eventually assimilated by their larger partners, which resulted in Zebrides current Lineage landscape. §YThe Pandai§!, headed by Matriarch Kudakelasi herself, dominates the central islands, keeping a tight eye on their various businesses.  §YThe Garang§!, who one can find based on the western islands, dining with the local Zebra Landlords. §YThe Sopan§!, who are seemingly tied with the Seas. And the §YThe Tegas§!, integrated with the locals over at Pulalap. \n\n If Kudakelasi ever wishes to bring development to the Zebridies, she would need to make sure they play by the rules of the government. Because without the help of the Lineages, it is doubtful any meaningful development can happen across the entire Zebridies. \n\n §Y[?YAN_Pandai_legal]%§! of Pandai's income comes from legal sources. \n §Y[?YAN_Garang_legal]%§! of Garang's income comes from legal sources. \n §Y[?YAN_Sopan_legal]%§! of Sopan's income comes from legal sources. \n §Y[?YAN_Tegas_legal]%§! of Tegas' income comes from legal sources."

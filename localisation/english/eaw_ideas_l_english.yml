 proper_science_base_desc:0 "This nation is part of the global community of intellectuals and scholars. As such, the latest inventions are quick to spread here. Some of them might even originate from the country's prestigious modern universities. The scientific method is proficiently used by local researchers to construct an objective view of the magical world around us."
 big_science_base:0 "Substantial Science Base"
 big_science_base_desc:0 "Scholars in this country have embraced the Equestrian scientific revolution, abandoning the ways of the past. However, they face much obscurantism or even outright hostility from wider society. Not only that, but they also lack resources and personnel to conduct any large-scale research."
 better_science_base:0 "Small Science Base"
 better_science_base_desc:0 "While some philosophers and scholars in this country question traditional conceptions of nature and are curious about foreign ideas, they are few in number and most intellectuals cling on to the old. What the outsiders call "science" is largely seen as heresy or delusion, as most intellectuals still believe the natural world cannot be understood or explained."
 poor_science_base:0 "Poor Science Base"
 poor_science_base_desc:0 ""Science" is an unknown concept here. Superstition and outlandish ideas are used to explain the functioning of the world. Magic is seen as a wild, untamed and even dangerous force that should be avoided. Most "intellectuals" are elders or priests who focus on recording traditional knowledge rather than trying to innovate."
 
 modern_society:0 "Modern Society"
 modern_society_desc:0 "A modern society has tamed and taken control of the natural world. While this might not mean complete management of weather like in Equestria, it does mean the nation has organized into an extremely complex, interconnected entity with robust institutions and efficient mass-scale industrial production. Sprawling urban conglomerations are supported by all the necessary infrastructure to maintain their massive populations. Due to increased automation and global trade, more and more citizens work in the service sector. At this rate, the country will eventually advance beyond modernity."

 outdated_industry:0 "Newly Industrialized Society"
 outdated_industry_desc:0 "Despite industrialising, this nation has not yet caught up to more advanced nations. Some traditional institutions still do all they can to stop the seemingly inevitable march of progress. Yet their efforts appear increasingly futile as the society around them continues to change rapidly. A majority of the population is already living in cities and working in the industrial sector, while communication and transportation technologies are being used to connect the growing capital to all corners of the nation, as well as the larger world beyond. Soon enough, this society can call itself modern by any definition of the word."

 agrarian_society:0 "Agrarian Society"
 agrarian_society_desc:0 "An agrarian society is where a substantial portion of the populace, around 90%, is engaged in agriculture. The countryside is divided into countless small villages and towns, with only a few larger urban settlements. Almost all work is done manually, with minimal automation and a reliance on beasts of burden. Life is slow and unchanging, with the same traditional institutions continuing to remain in place. Only a few metropolitan individuals ever visit abroad and foreigners are a rare sight. However, these few outside connections could potentially spark an industrial revolution."

 tribal_society:0 "Primitive Society"
 tribal_society_desc:0 "Loosely defined, a primitive society is defined by lack of social complexity. The population is divided into countless small units, often based on familial relationships, and there is no strong central authority. The entire population, except for a few exceptions like spiritual leaders, engage in subsistence agriculture, pastoralism or even hunting and gathering. Specialization or division of labour are near non-existent. There is no shared identity, no "nation", no "country" and no "government". Yet there is still culture, art, religion, language and above all, ageless primordial wisdom."

 lack_of_scientists3:0 "Limited Illiteracy"

 lack_of_scientists2:0 "Modest Illiteracy"
 lack_of_scientists2_desc:0 "Despite continued efforts, about half of the populace in this country remains illiterate, with many being unable to attain any education. However, the foundation for the education of the entire population exists and simply needs to be expanded upon."
 lack_of_scientists1:0 "Broad Illiteracy"
 lack_of_scientists1_desc:0 "A clear majority of the population in this nation is completely unable to read or write, though the number of literate citizens is by no means small.

 lack_of_scientists:0 "Mass Illiteracy"
 lack_of_scientists_desc:0 "Due to pandemic illiteracy and a nonexistent education system, at most only a small fraction of the population can read or write. Most labourers are unskilled and ignorant, unable to work on more complex jobs."

 poverty5:0 "Mild Poverty"

 poverty3:0 "Moderate Poverty"
 poverty3_desc:0 "Somehow, a sizeable portion of the population are suffering from lack of access to basic needs. They are looked down upon by the rest of society as they beg, do work that is seen as servile or humiliating, and commit crimes. Yet it is not their own fault that they suffer, and they wish for nothing more than a normal life."
 poverty2:0 "High Poverty"
 poverty2_desc:0 "This country has serious economic issues, with masses of destitute citizens living in sprawling slums and crumbling rural shacks. They own nothing, and no matter how hard they work, they don't get enough to get by. As such, many of them become criminals or join radical movements."
 poverty1:0 "Severe Poverty"
 poverty1_desc:0 "This country is stricken by widespread poverty that affects a majority of the population. Hunger ravages the poor who wander the land, looking for any scraps of food. Cities, once humming with activity, have become quiet ghost towns. Crime is rampant as it is the most reliable way to earn a living."
 poverty:0 "Extreme Poverty"
 poverty_desc:0 "This country has suffered a near total societal collapse leading to tremendous levels of poverty all across the board. It is a miracle a famine has not taken place as farms are abandoned and urban marketplaces become desolate. Crime lords dominate the land as the government cannot afford to maintain law and order.

zebrica_legacy_of_storm1_desc:0 "When the Storm King invaded us with his army, we were determined to fight until the bitter end. And so we did. For months we resisted boldly, slowing his advance to a crawl and using scorched earth tactics to deny any gains for him. When our army was finally defeated, the Storm King proceeded to burn down and loot every town that was still intact. We tried hiding our treasures from him, but he was no fool and managed to find them, taking everything valuable for himself. Afterwards his army left us alone to lick our wounds. We have lost everything, except for our honour."
zebrica_legacy_of_storm2:0 "Legacy of the Storm"
zebrica_legacy_of_storm2_desc:0 "When the Storm King invaded us with his army, we initially resisted and fought back, before realising the mad conqueror's strategy was without flaw. Instead of continuing to fight in vain, we sought to negotiate with him and eventually managed to sign a deal that spared us from doom. Angered by our initial resistance, the Storm King sacked our largest cities and burned down many buildings. He then demanded we pay hefty tribute and seized all our artifacts. Our people are angered by our failure to protect them and our economy is ailing."
zebrica_legacy_of_storm3:0 "Legacy of the Storm"
zebrica_legacy_of_storm3_desc:0 "When the Storm King invaded us with his army, we managed to avoid his wrath with either humble tribute, clever diplomacy, cunning trickery or by other means. We gave away all of our valuables and artifacts and in return the Storm King was content leaving us alone for the most part, only sacking and destroying a few towns. Afterwards we became a tributary until he eventually perished. Some of our citizens grumble that we should've fought back against the warlord, but at least our country remains mostly intact."

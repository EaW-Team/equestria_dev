The great fortress-temple has been stripped bare of anything valuable, but for the small number of clergy still living in it, this does not matter. Riches are but a distraction from their veneration of Arcturius, the god of war. Everything they've lost was merely a sacrifice in His name, one they were willing to make. As such, the temple now appears more like a military complex than a place of worship, knights guarding its gates, guns pointed at any who would disturb their peace again."

 ### Events ###
 raiding.100.t:0 "Incoming Raid!"
 raiding.100.d:0 "Urgent news has arrived from [?defender_state_vs_@FROM.GetName], one of our border states! A marauding army from [From.GetName] has crossed the boundaries between our two nations and has engaged in looting, pillaging and burning down local settlements. Should we divert some of the troops from the frontline to handle this incursion?"
 raiding.100.a:0 "Protect the civilians, protect our towns!"
 raiding.100.b:0 "Unfortunately, we cannot spare any soldiers..."

 raiding.1.t:0 "Successful Raid!"
 raiding.1.d:0 "Our prey was no match for our fierce warriors, and they've dispersed after a quick and decisive assault. Our raiding parties return home, with plentiful plunder!"
 raiding.1.a:0 "Tonight, we feast and drink!"

 raiding.2.t:0 "Raid Cancelled"
 raiding.2.d:0 "Despite our initial thoughts and expectations, the enemy has put up quite a good fight, so much, in fact, that our commanders have decided to pull back and cancel the entire raid."
 raiding.2.a:0 "We just weren't prepared..."
 
 raiding.3.t:0 "Failed Raid"
 raiding.3.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, we couldn't manage to break through the enemy positions. Many of our warriors died, yet nothing was gained."
 raiding.3.a:0 "Don't worry, we'll get 'em next time."
 
 raiding.5.t:0 "Successful Defence"
 raiding.5.d:0 "The enemy raiders were met with full force and, after some skirmishing, they retreated back behind their own borders. Did they not expect us to put up a fight, or what?"
 raiding.5.a:0 "Cowards!"
 
 raiding.6.t:0 "Successful Defence"
 raiding.6.d:0 "The enemy raiding party has been hit hard and pushed back outside of our borders. Undoubtedly, they're unlikely to try that again."

 raiding.7.t:0 "Caravans Looted"
 raiding.7.d:0 "The enemy has managed to break through and ambush a friendly caravan, taking with them all of the riches and slaughtering the accompanying merchants."
 raiding.7.a:0 "Curses!"
 
 raiding.8.t:0 "Garrison Slaughtered"
 raiding.8.d:0 "Somehow, the enemy raiders have managed to break through our defences. Even worse, they have managed to take out an entire garrison of troops. This is an embarrassment to our armed forces!"
 raiding.8.a:0 "How could this happen!?"
 
 raiding.9.t:0 "Manufactory Destroyed"
 raiding.9.d:0 "Enemy forces have managed to slip past our defences and raided one of our manufactories. After a quick review, the workers reported that many of their tools were stolen and much of the machinery was broken."
 raiding.9.a:0 "We'll kill the bastards for this!"
 
 raiding.10.t:0 "Armouries Looted"
 raiding.10.d:0 "The enemy has broken through and looted one of our armouries behind the frontline. They've taken as many guns as they could carry!"
 raiding.10.a:0 "Accursed vagabonds!"
 
 raiding.11.t:0 "Villages Slaughtered"
 raiding.11.d:0 "Horrible news! Hostile raiders have reportedly broken through several gaps in our defences and entered nearby towns and villages. During the ensuing panic, these soldiers burnt down houses and shot down innocent villagers before finally retreating from the crime scene."
 raiding.11.a:0 "What sort of animals could do this..."

 RAI_commence_raid:0 "Raiding"
 RAI_HEL_woodist_raid:0 "Propaganda vun der Akt"
 RAI_HEL_capitalist_raid:0 "Eminent Domain"
 RAI_HEL_vanguardist_raid:0 "Permanent Revolution"
 RAI_HEL_eyrist_raid:0 "Bellum Iustum"
 RAI_HEL_sheriff_raid:0 "Search and Seizure"
 RAI_commence_raid_desc:0 "Our people have embraced raiding as a way of life, and as such we can launch raids against our neighbours to gain £loot_text  §YLoot§! which we can then spend in a variety of ways.\n\nWe have §G[?loot|0]§! piles of £loot_text  §YLoot§!."
 RAI_HEL_woodist_raid_desc:0 "The people of Griffonia are in need of true, concrete liberation, and the only way to do that is to strike at the source of the problem themselves - the greedy and oppressive nobles and Archonists who have sabotaged Adelart and Griffonia as a whole. From this revolutionary action, we can gain  £loot_text  §YLoot§! to redistribute among the people, however we are limited to banditry against only oppressive monarchies.\n\nWe have §G[?loot|0]§! piles of £loot_text  §YLoot§!."
 RAI_HEL_eyrist_raid_desc:0 "The Good News of the Prophet of Eyr, while dearly coveted by the flock, has not had the same effect on the hearts and minds of the Archonite dogs who infest and taint our sacred temples and meeting places. The tritheists, like a cornered, frightened animal, can comprehend only one course of action to protect themselves - violence. As such, the Old Believers have sanctioned preventative measures to acquire £loot_text  §YLoot§! to protect ourselves and prepare for further evangelism.\n\nWe have §G[?loot|0]§! piles of £loot_text  §YLoot§!."
 RAI_HEL_vanguardist_raid_desc:0 "There is no just war but class war, but thankfully for Alexandra Descieux, there is class warfare abundant. We shall provide a model of this warfare proletariat of the monarchies, plutocracies, and statocracies that surround us, and strike deep into the hearts of enemy territory to uncover £loot_text  §YLoot§! and spread the ideals of permanent revolution.\n\nWe have §G[?loot|0]§! piles of £loot_text  §YLoot§!."
 RAI_HEL_capitalist_raid_desc:0 "Taking into account Adelart's weakened socioeconomic condition, our fair Republic of Oil has a mountain to climb before we can properly compete with the great models of Griffonian industrial power. Might makes right, and with the sheer number of mercenaries at our command, there's no reason to suggest we cannot continue in Wood and his grunts' pursuit of £loot_text  §YLoot§!. After all, the repossessed goods will be much more valuable in the claws of the Republic than in those of foreign idol-grubbers.\n\nWe have §G[?loot|0]§! piles of £loot_text  §YLoot§!."
 RAI_HEL_sheriff_raid_desc:0 "Bandits are everywhere. Under the guise of "progress", the "rule of law", and "liberty", they entitle griffons only with the power to make real the desires of our species - to bring wealth into our coffers and to make war upon other griffons for our own interest. They are states of anarchy. If such societies wish to abide by this twisted conception of statehood and sovereignty, we would be foolish not to take advantage of it.\n\nWe have §G[?loot|0]§! piles of £loot_text  §YLoot§!."

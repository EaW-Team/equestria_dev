 ### Events ###

 raiding.100.d:0 "Urgent news have arrived from [?defender_state_vs_@FROM.GetName], one of our border states! A marauding army from [From.GetName] has crossed the boundaries between our two nations and has engaged in looting, pillaging and burning down local settlements. Should we divert some of the troops from the frontline to handle this incursion?"
 raiding.100.a:0 "Protect the civilians, protect our towns!"
 raiding.100.b:0 "Unfortunately, we cannot spare any soldiers..."

 raiding.1.t:0 "Successful Raid!"
 raiding.1.d:0 "Our prey was no match for our fierce warriors, and they've dispersed after a quick and decisive assault. Our raiding parties return home, with plentiful plunder!"

 raiding.2.t:0 "Raid Cancelled"
 raiding.2.d:0 "Despite our initial thoughts and expectations, the enemy has put up quite a good fight, so much, in fact, that our commanders have decided to pull back and cancel the entire raid."
 raiding.2.a:0 "We just weren't prepared..."
 
 raiding.3.t:0 "Failed Raid"

 raiding.5.t:0 "Successful Defence"
 raiding.5.d:0 "The enemy raiders were met with full force and, after some skirmishing, they retreated back behind their own borders. Did they not expect us to put up a fight, or what?"
 raiding.5.a:0 "Cowards!"
 
 raiding.6.t:0 "Successful Defence"

 raiding.8.a:0 "How could this happen!?"
 
 raiding.9.t:0 "Manufactory Destroyed"
 raiding.9.d:0 "Enemy forces have managed to slip past our defences and raided one of our manufactories. After a quick review, the workers reported that many of their tools were stolen and much of the machinery was broken."
 raiding.9.a:0 "We'll kill the bastards for this!"
 
 raiding.10.t:0 "Armouries Looted"
 raiding.10.d:0 "The enemy has broken through and looted one of our armouries behind the frontline. They've taken as many guns as they could carry!"
 raiding.10.a:0 "Accursed vagabonds!"
 
 raiding.11.t:0 "Villages Slaughtered"
 raiding.11.d:0 "Horrible news! Hostile raiders have reportedly broken through several gaps in our defences and entered nearby towns and villages. During the ensuing panic, these soldiers burnt down houses and shot down innocent villagers before finally retreating from the crime scene."
 raiding.11.a:0 "What sort of animals could do this..."

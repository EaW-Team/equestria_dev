 DEP_gun_imports_desc:0 "The Prince's Army is two steps ahead of us as far as infantry weapons go, and already replacing their breachloading weapons. Acquiring their 'old' stockpiles would be of great benefit to us, and certainly a step over spears and crossbows."

 DEP_copy_mic:0 "In Defence of the Empire"
 DEP_copy_mic_desc:0 "We have done our duty and supported the Great Prince, but at no small cost. Outdated weaponry and tactics drag us down, and if we are to support the Empire in the future we must excel at the arts of war and match the most modern of nations. "

 DEP_trotoyta_contract_desc:0 "While a great many look on them with suspicion or even outright hatred, motorized wagons are clearly an important tool in any future army. We've chosen Trotoyta as a private enterprise to assist our military in acquiring and fielding these machines."

 DEP_lakeish_regimental_training:0 "Reforged Empire, Reforged Soldiers"

 DEP_lessons_of_reconquest_desc:0 "War is the greatest teacher, and we have learned greatly. Generals Daring Star, Riviere, and Forest Berry have all learned through success and failure. Their expertise could well help us create better doctrinal-level planning."

 DEP_imperial_war_propaganda:0 "For King and\nGrand Prince!"

 DEP_golden_years:0 "Return of the Golden Age"
 DEP_golden_years_desc:0 " Our support for the Grand Prince has not gone unappreciated.

 DEP_radio_imports:0 "Finest of Lake Radios"
 DEP_radio_imports_desc:0 "Radios are, to some, a terrifying technology; ostensibly they use unseen waves of energy to transmit sound, yet without magic. To others, they're a curiousity.

 DEP_railroad_expansion:0 "Svetigrad-Maneceaster Line"
 DEP_railroad_expansion_desc:0 "Lake City has blessed us by taking on the burden of developing a railroad to Deponya. This benefits both parties, to be sure, but for us the benefit is enormous as we now have not only a railroad, but the trains to take advantage of it."

 DEP_native_electronics_industry:0 "Pony Corporation Electronics"

### Military -tree ###

 DEP_update_peasantry_ledgers:0 "Revise the Peasantry Ledgers"
 DEP_update_peasantry_ledgers_desc:0 "Deponya relies on an antiquated system of raising peasant armies in times of conflict.

It is time to focus on revising them, and in doing so ensuring every pony does their part."

 DEP_revoke_black_powder_ban:0 "Revoke the Black Powder Ban"
 DEP_revoke_black_powder_ban_desc:0 "Ever since 914, it has been illegal to produce black powder. While this policy was once a couragous move to protect the public, it has hamstrung the development of a modern military. The ban will be revoked, and a production centre established in the capital."

 DEP_study_old_muskets:0 "Scrub the Rusty Muskets"
 DEP_study_old_muskets_desc:0 "The long era of peace and plenty has left the general military with few servicable firearms.

While the situation is almost embarassing, with some gun oil these weapons can be used once again."

 DEP_army_of_farmers:0 "Proud Farmers of Deponya"
 DEP_army_of_farmers_desc:0 "The ponies of Deponya are a peace loving people. They have always been curious, kind, and capable. It is time the government ensured that these capabilities of our society benefit us all, rather than cast them aside to mimick the development of others. Curiousity can be curated into directed study, and capable farmers make excellent engineers."

 DEP_yeomare_reforms:0 "March of the Deponyan Yeomares"
 DEP_yeomare_reforms_desc:0 "The bulk of our army relies on part-time Yeomares, which most other nations would consider reservists or a national guard. It is clear that a future army cannot function on this level, and we will need to restructure the military. What Yeomares wish to become true professional soldiers will be trained, and the remainder will be disbanded."

 DEP_noble_officers_education:0 "The Noble Commanders of the Royal Army"
 DEP_noble_officers_education_desc:0 "It is the privilege and the responsibility of the nobility to lead the Royal Army.

 DEP_rugged_soldiers:0 "Soldierly Yet Rugged"

 DEP_weapon_modernisation:0 "Adopt Lake Army Weapons"
 DEP_weapon_modernisation_desc:0 "While it will no doubt require a few weeks of negotiation, it's time we invested some time into importing Lake Army weapons designs and examples. By doing so, we can greatly accelerate our own domestic research.

 DEP_royal_weapon_company:0 "Royal Rifle & Ordnance Factory"
 DEP_royal_weapon_company_desc:0 "The drive to modernize is nothing without production to supply the new equipment and mechanization required. There are several good locations to establish new factory lines, we only need the investment of time and money to start them up."

 DEP_earth_pony_flight:0 "Earth Pony Flight"
 DEP_earth_pony_flight_desc:0 "It was once said that if Earth Ponies were made to fly, they would have wings. With steel and prop engines, we now have this power."

 DEP_master_earthworks:0 "Masters At Earthworks"
 DEP_master_earthworks_desc:0 "Army's leave behind ruins. The Royal Army leaves behind a village.

Our engineers are masters at moving Earth, and further focus on adapting training to support this idea will yield significant division-level benefits."

 DEP_deponyan_manpower:0 "Fear Our Soldiers!"
 DEP_deponyan_manpower_desc:0 "The Royal Army is the pride of the nation, and every time they showcase the discipline of their drill, and the modernity of their new weapons, new recruits eagerly sign up. The modernization practices are all coming together now, and ponies that would never consider a career in the military before are drawn to the modern, professional, Army."

 DEP_royal_sapper_school:0 "Royal Sapper School of Maneceaster"
 DEP_royal_sapper_school_desc:0 "A Deponyan Farmer can dig a better trench, in less time, than even the most skilled engineer from any other nation. This is however not the sole objective of an engineer, and the engineering corps must expand their training to the destructive as well as the defensive."

 DEP_shovel_bayonet:0 "The Shovel Bayonet"
 DEP_shovel_bayonet_desc:0 "An inventive soldier at the Royal Sapper School, despite the hesitance of their supervisor, has submitted a proposal for a combined bayonet and digging implement.

 DEP_spear_warfare_legacy_desc:0 "The pace of advancement in doctrine has been almost a whirlwind, but even as some look at us as backwards we can use our centuries of training with spears to our advantage.

 DEP_army_of_alchemy:0 "Wise Alchemists of Deponya"
 DEP_army_of_alchemy_desc:0 "As with the proud farmers of Deponya, the alchemists of the realm should not be forced out of modern society. They should be encouraged to grow into the evolving social fabric, and their studies can be directed to benefit the state."

 DEP_spider_warfare:0 "Arachnid Warfare"
 DEP_spider_warfare_desc:0 "Ever since the Great Migration and the alliance struck by King Hay Scythe, the spiders of Eygsic have lived amongst the ponies as friends and family members. This includes service in the Royal Army, where they bleed and die for Deponya alongside the ponies they so dearly care for."

 DEP_wolf_spiders:0 "Stalking Wolves"
 DEP_wolf_spiders_desc:0 "Some Eygsic Spiders grow large enough to carry a rider, and the discipline between rider and spider is a profoundly courageous duo in battle. We should make this idea a standard part of Eygsic company level doctrine and developing training methods based on trust between rider and spider. The mobility of a spider with the drive and courage of a pony is a potent combination."

 DEP_spider_rider_specialization:0 "Duty of Eygsic Keepers"
 DEP_spider_rider_specialization_desc:0 "The Eygsic Keepers have long since protected Eygsic and Deponya from invasion. Their role, however, is quickly being superceded by mechanization and industry. We should shift their doctrinal use to elite units within the Royal Army, instead of the larger formations they have been historically."

 DEP_armoured_carapace:0 "To Protect Pony And Spider"
 DEP_armoured_carapace_desc:0 "The traditional armour of the Eygsic Riders is designed around the anatomical armour of the spiders themselves. This was once more than enough, and provided better agility than ancient metal would have. Modern war, however, requires more- and modern techniques ensure the weight won't be as much of a constraint."

 DEP_mounted_weapon_system:0 "Vertical Maneuvering Saddle Platform"

 DEP_spider_army_buffs:0 "Royal Yeonids"
 DEP_spider_army_buffs_desc:0 "The Eygsic Keepers have long since protected Eygsic and Deponya from invasion. It is time we adopted their role into the army proper, and trained them into proper parts of the Army itself. This will result in a significant expansion of recruitment to match the scale of the Army."

 DEP_royal_spider_support:0 "Charge of the Royal Spiders"
 DEP_royal_spider_support_desc:0 "Certain spiders develope an additional exoskeleton layer over their face alike to a helmet or even a crown. Hence their nickname, the Royal Spiders. Duke Daring Star, in consultation with spider whisperers, has approached the king with an idea to consolidate the Royal Spiders into a spearhead formation in support of the yeomare formations."

 DEP_weaponized_arachnophobia:0 "Weaponized Arachnophobia"
 DEP_weaponized_arachnophobia_desc:0 "No matter how many times we assure that the spiders are harmless and don't even eat flesh, outsiders continue to fear them. An interesting idea has been proposed to the royal court to weaponize this fear by intentionally spreading rumours among our enemies of the Royal Army being filled with giant spiders."

 DEP_spider_medics:0 "Eight-Legged Nurses"
 DEP_spider_medics_desc:0 "In other nations, the sight of an enormous spider coming up upon them strikes fear. To a member of the Royal Army, these battlefield medics are a blessed sight that can deliver them from deaths door. While their use up until now has been ad-hoc, it is time to make them a true company-level supporting unit."

 DEP_spider_phones:0 "The Telephone Swarm"
 DEP_spider_phones_desc:0 "Training often results in interesting ideas, and during a field training war game a junior officer was able to work around repeatedly cut communications by simply giving their spider scouts bundles of wire. This idea has been trialed and its implementation as doctrine ensures that our communications will be completely involiable even during battle."

 DEP_expand_alchemy_academy:0 "King's College of Potioncrafting"
 DEP_expand_alchemy_academy_desc:0 "TODO many famous alchemists have receieved education in King's College and gone on to discover many helpful brews. But over centuries, as formulas became standartised and widely known, the college withered. By royal decree the college will be restored and ordered to begin military experimentations."

 DEP_superior_gunpowder:0 "The Flashpowder"
 DEP_superior_gunpowder_desc:0 "The King's College alchemical school has developed a team of incredible insight for infantry weapons.

With additional funding, this team promises to give us a significant leap in our infantry weapons technology."

 DEP_cannon_forge:0 "Fires of the Cannon Forge"
 DEP_cannon_forge_desc:0 "TODO cannons were once used by Deponya in the wars against Grover II. No original piece survived the wars since all were either destroyed or smelt after War of Bloom and Berries. With consent of the king, the alchemists have researched old times and re-discovered old manuals and schematics for cannons. While outdated, it's been enough to convince the king to fund establishment of a cannon forge."

 DEP_embrace_firepower:0 "Wonders of Rifled Barrel"
 DEP_embrace_firepower_desc:0 "TODO musket studies have proven how vital firepower is on the modern battlefield. The Royal Army must adapt and embrace the destructive potential of amassed firepower."

 DEP_supporting_army:0 "In Support of the Royal Army"
 DEP_supporting_army_desc:0 "TODO alchemists have always trailed along the army, healing wounded yeomares and using their wisdom to support commanders. But with the changing times, it's become pertinent to turn alchemists into proper officers of the Royal Army and let them into the war council so they offer fresh military ideas."

 DEP_king_great_army:0 "His Majesty's Great Army"
 DEP_king_great_army_desc:0 "The Royal Army is formed from the best, most disciplined, and most couragous of us all.

 DEP_crossbow_bomb_launcher:0 "Alchemical Crossbow"
 DEP_crossbow_bomb_launcher_desc:0 "Crossbows are not, entirely, an obsolete idea. The larger bolt means that their design can be used to deliver a projectile equivalent to a rifle grenade, but without the awkward requirement to adapt attachments for rifles or modify rounds to support this."

 DEP_rethink_defence_plans:0 "Rethink Defence Plans"
 DEP_rethink_defence_plans_desc:0 "Much has changed since Deponya has entered the modern age. It is time to recall the defence staff, and sit them down for a few weeks to modernize our planning. It's been so long, indeed, that our present plans expect the enemy to use massed calvary, and references motorized vehicles as a 'curiosity'."

 DEP_deponyan_firepower:0 "Fear Our Firepower!"
 DEP_deponyan_firepower_desc:0 "Artillery leads the way, as integration of heavy weapons and artillery in Army doctrine has made the Royal Army a truly modern force. Infantry-focused combined arms planning has made the Royal Army into a truly agile modern force."

 DEP_adopt_lake_logistics_model_desc:0 "In order to expand the Royal Army to the scale and agility that modern war requires, it is time we adopted the Lake Army's logistical model.

 DEP_lake_tanks:0 "Type-09 Training Tankette"
 DEP_lake_tanks_desc:0 "While our own domestic armour research and development is limited by Deponya's size and industrial base, we can lean on Lake City and acquire some older models. With a foundational basis to work from, our own designs will surely be inspired."

Inherited into nobility like his peers, he dedicated his early life to the military and mastering Deponya's military doctrines. Soon enough, commanding the realm's levies and skillfully integrating Egysic spiders into his strategies became second nature to him. Though the majority of his service to Deponya unfolded during relatively peaceful times, his unwavering diligence propelled him up the ranks until he achieved the esteemed position of marshal. Over the span of decades, he forged a legacy as one of the realm's most steadfast protectors. Daring Star's devotion knows no bounds when it comes to safeguarding Deponya and its ponies, as well as its spiders. His commitment to their safety burns fiercely within him, driving him to confront any threat that dares cast a shadow over the crown. As a Duke, he clings to traditional values, being stubborn to new political ideas like many other nobles.

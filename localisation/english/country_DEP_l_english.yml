Soon enough, commanding the realm's levies and skillfully integrating Egysic spiders into his strategies became second nature to him. Though the majority of his service to Deponya unfolded during relatively peaceful times, his unwavering diligence propelled him up the ranks until he achieved the esteemed position of marshal. Over the span of decades, he forged a legacy as one of the realm's most steadfast protectors. Daring Star's devotion knows no bounds when it comes to safeguarding Deponya and its ponies, as well as its spiders. His commitment to their safety burns fiercely within him, driving him to confront any threat that dares cast a shadow over the crown. As a Duke, he clings to traditional values, being stubborn to new political ideas like many other nobles.

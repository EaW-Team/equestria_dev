### Decisions Categories ###
BAL_PRO_army:0 "The Changeling Garrison"
BAL_PRO_army_desc:0 "We are surrounded by enemies on all sides, the only thing keeping order in this mosquito infested hellhole are the brave changelings of the Austral §GGarrison§!.\n\nUnfortunately for us, we are on the very edge of the Changeling Empire and as such the garrison receives little to no support from the Fatherland.\n\nThe §GGarrison's Size§! is at §Y[?BAL_changeling_garrison]%§!"
BAL_PRO_resistance_d:0 "The HMCMDR"
BAL_PRO_resistance_d_desc:0 "Unlike our General Staff's initial predictions it seems as if the Ponies have not been fully cowed by their defeat in the Great War. As such many of them have taken to joining the newly formed §RHMCMDR§!.\n\nThis clandestine organisation; comprised of a myriad of scattered Resistance groups and rebel cells seeks to overthrow the Protectorate's rightful government and restore Equestrian rule to the South-East.\n\n§RHMCMDR's Power§! is at §Y[?BAL_resistance]%§!"
BAL_PRO_natives_d:0 "The Natives"
BAL_PRO_natives_d_desc:0 "The §RNatives§! of the Equestrian South-East have proven surprisingly resistant to our rule. While primitive and uncivilized they are masters of guerilla warfare and as such make any changeling think twice before going into the Protectorate's jungles.\n\nThankfully for us the §RNatives§! are far too scattered, diverse and disorganised to even be capable of posing a threat to the Protectorate's Government.\n\nThe §RNative's Unity§! is at §Y[?BAL_natives]%§!"
BAL_PRO_stress_d:0 "The Burdens Of Leadership"
BAL_PRO_stress_d_desc:0 "Lead the Austral Protectorate is a thankless job, not only that is an extremely stressful and demanding job. One that requires nigh unending dedication and effort.\n\nAs such it'd be prudent to keep an eye out on the Lord Protector lest he suffer a §Rmental breakdown§!.\n\n Larynx's §RStress Level§! is at §Y[?BAL_stress]%§!\n\n"
BAL_PRO_blood_cult_d:0 "The Sons Of Ahuizotl"
BAL_PRO_blood_cult_d_desc:0 "Our various projects in the Equestrian South-East have managed to earn the ire of the numerous §RNative§! tribes in the area.\n\nWhile we have always known this would be an issue we could not have predicted the depths the §RNatives§! would sink to chase us out of their land.\n\nA group calling themselves the §RSons of Ahuizotl§! have taken it upon themselves to resurrect the ancient Neighuatl practice of blood sacrifice... needless to say the effects of this revival on our troops' morale have been profound, to make matters worse the §RSons of Ahuizotl§! have begun rapidly growing by absorbing displaced or otherwise bitter tribes.\n\n The §RSons of Ahuizotl§! are at §Y[?BAL_blood_cult]%§! §RPower§!\n\n" 
BAL_PRO_queens_guard_d:0 "The Queen's Most Loyal Servants"
BAL_PRO_queens_guard_d_desc:0 "The ever loyal and dogmatic §RQueen's Guard§! have arrived! Why they're here no one knows, but one thing is for certain they're a pain in the flank to deal with. We must tread carefully with our dealings with them, as one wrong step could end in the §GLord Protector§!'s execution.\n\nThe §RQueen's Guard§! are at §Y[?BAL_queens_guard_dis]%§! §RDissatisfaction§!\n\n"

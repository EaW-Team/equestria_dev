 # Ships and Equipment #
 destroyer_5:0 "Modern Conventional Destroyer"
 destroyer_5_desc:0 "These destroyers are the ultimate incarnation of what was once the torpedo boat destroyer: fast, well-armed, and excellent sub-hunters, the destroyer has become a mainstay of the fleet as a light escort and as the prime ASW naval vessel. Though some naval designers believe that we've hit the peak point for this kind of destroyer, these are still a significant threat to submersibles and capital ships."
 destroyer_6:0 "Early Guided-Missile Destroyer"
 destroyer_6_desc:0 "Missile technology has advanced to the point where a single weapons system can perform multiple roles. This new generation of destroyers still has the same primary escort and ASW duties. However, with the new missile system, these destroyers can now effectively engage enemy aircraft. Even older ships can be retrofitted with the new missile weaponry to reduce costs without reducing the destroyers' overall firepower."

 light_cruiser_5:0 "Fleet Cruiser"
 light_cruiser_5_desc:0 "Most of the concurrent naval doctrines have reduced the effectiveness of independent operations by single ships or very small task groups, in which light cruisers previously found success. These new cruisers are not expected to engage in large-scale surface action and instead solely provide anti-aircraft support to the more essential carriers. With improved radar direction of autoloaded DP guns, these are the ultimate conventional anti-aircraft cruisers."
 light_cruiser_6:0 "Early Guided-Missile 'Frigate'"
 light_cruiser_6_desc:0 "Developments in missile weaponry have put into question the use of light cruisers in modern fleet doctrine. Many older hulls can be converted into missile cruisers with the appropriate missile weapon systems. In contrast, new designs have significantly less displacement, which effectively turns these cruisers into frigates. These frigates are effective offensive and defensive ships with excellent anti-missile, anti-ship, and anti-air missile systems, particularly when paired with the new and improved self-sealing magical armour plating."

 heavy_cruiser_5:0 "Modern All-Gun Cruiser"
 heavy_cruiser_5_desc:0 "Changing naval tactics has made surface engagements of old far less common, and the heavy cruiser has lost its role as a commerce raider. Much like its smaller counterparts, modern heavy cruisers have been reduced to auxiliary ships and escorts to the ageing battleships and the ascendent carriers. Though a glorified 'big' light cruiser, these contemporary heavy cruiser designs are excellent and represent the ideal heavy cruiser."
 heavy_cruiser_6:0 "Early Guided-Missile Cruiser"
 heavy_cruiser_6_desc:0 "The widespread adoption of missile weapons has placed our heavy cruiser in a curious position. Battleships have become almost prohibitively expensive, and missile weapon systems make our new missile cruisers just as deadly as battleships. Aircraft and submarines are still a significant threat to even the most modern missile cruisers. However, the new weapon mountings and magical armour plating make them devastating naval vessels."

 pre_dreadnought_nomtg:0 "Macawian-Style Battleship"
 pre_dreadnought_nomtg_desc:0 "A symbol of Macawia's naval power, their influential battleship design was quickly adopted worldwide and has historically been the Griffonian Empire's ship of battle. Wildly outdated by today's standards, this floating steel fortress still boasts large and dangerous guns and should not be underestimated."

 battle_cruiser_3_desc:0 "These subsequent battlecruisers are the quickest capital ship ever to sail the seas. Continued improvements are still primarily focused on its secondary and anti-aircraft weaponry, while breakthroughs in fire directory make its primary guns deadlier at little cost in displacement or speed. However, it's becoming evident that this class of ships is reaching a dead-end."

 battleship_5_desc:0 "The golden age of the battleship is rapidly passing by us as the threats to these large warships become insurmountable. Our advances in computing and fire directors can still make the primary weapons of new battleship designs powerful and deadly, making for a superb offshore artillery platform that is lethal at range. However, the cost of constructing and maintaining battleships is very high, and only a few die-hard proponents actively campaign for an expansion of our battleship programme."
 battleship_6_desc:0 "A final attempt by traditionalists to maintain the battleship relevant in this new age, contemporary designs seek to upgrade most of the vessel's arsenal with the latest in cruise missile technology. These ships still boast the terrifying heavy artillery from yesteryear. However, due to their vulnerability, any new battleship will be relegated to fire support duties, such as shore bombardment."

 SH_battleship_3:0 "Super Guided-Missile Battleship"
 SH_battleship_3_desc:0 "Perhaps more of a statement of stubborn pride than viable warships, these battleships armed with vast arsenals of rockets and cruise missiles are nothing more than upscaled guided-missile battleships. Their survivability and firepower are nothing short of awe-inspiring, but many naval theorists believe this class of vessels to be massive sinkholes of money, materiel, and sailors. They urge us to look elsewhere for a true statement of modern naval power."

 light_carrier_1:0 "Flat-Deck Cruiser"
 light_carrier_1_desc:0 "Early attempts to recreate the carrier hulls built by Hippogriffia led to some nations experimenting with converting a more conventional cruiser hull by placing a flight deck atop most of its superstructure. Sometimes known as 'flat-tops', these flat-deck cruisers have no main armaments and fewer aircraft than normal carriers. Nevertheless, these smaller carriers are a less costly alternative and can carry out some limited carrier roles."
 carrier_5_desc:0 "There is a new naval arms race, but now it's waged between aircraft carriers. New jet-powered aircraft necessitates the introduction of the angled flight deck and jet blast deflector so that the new generation of aircraft can operate efficiently. These contemporary aircraft carriers will extend our naval reach beyond what was once thought possible."
 carrier_6_desc:0 "Our aircraft have become far larger than our previous propeller aircraft, and our carriers must accommodate this. Designed to operate naval jets, the newest aircraft carriers are considerably bigger and carry far more onboard ordnance and supplies to handle and service the newer aircraft. With these ships, our fleets will have a near-global reach, and no enemy shall be left untouched."

 submarine_5:0 "Attack Submarine"
 submarine_5_desc:0 "Attack submarines are a continuation of the previous hunter-killer classes. Far larger to accommodate additional torpedoes, larger engines, more sophisticated fire controls, and finer centimetric radar arrays, attack submarines can stay submerged almost indefinitely so long as the fuel and batteries last. Knowing just how difficult life is for submariners, crew comfort is a high priority: we've given them relatively spacious crew quarters and air conditioning!"
 submarine_6:0 "Early Cruise Missile Submarine"
 submarine_6_desc:0 "The continued development of missile technology offers a tempting opportunity for our newest submarines. Cruise missile submarines are powerful vessels, as they carry the devastating reach and firepower of cruise missiles with the stealth of submarines. With their cruise missile and torpedo weaponry, these submarines can strike any target, submerged, surface, or terrestrial, with destructive precision. Only another submarine can reliably sink a cruise missile submarine!"

 panzerschiff_nomtg:0 "Pocket Battleship" 
 panzerschiff_nomtg_desc:0 "In an attempt to do the impossible, engineers succeeded in mating battleship-level armament with a cruiser hull. The result is a ship that outguns any other known cruiser, but which is also expensive, comparatively slow and relatively poorly armored."
 panzerschiffe_nomtg:0 "Pocket Battleship" 
 coastal_defense_ship_nomtg:1 "Coastal Defense Ship"
 coastal_defense_ship_nomtg_desc:0 "An older design decades past, coastal defense ships combine the guns of a battleship with the hull of a cruiser, resulting in a powerful, but slow, cruiser, aimed at deterrence and local defense."
 cruiser_submarine_nomtg:0 "Cruiser Submarine"
 cruiser_submarine_nomtg_desc:0 "These larger submarines can patrol a longer range and hold more firepower or support equipment than their smaller cousins. However, their vulnerability and expense is making them obsolete."

 ##### Ends - edit as necessary #####
 ### FAT - Griffonian Republic ###
 FAT_destroyer_1:0 "Baron Class"
 FAT_destroyer_1_desc:0 "The Baron-class was an early destroyer that, while moderately effective in the end, suffered due to a protracted development and construction cycle. Simply put, while advanced when first designed the Baron-class ended up being obsolete before a single one ever set sail. While a failure in combat large fuel reserves and space for sizable numbers of passengers would see the design being used as a VIP transport for many years, with both Princess Celestia and Emperor Grover V owning a Baron-clas."
 FAT_destroyer_2:0 "Naga Class"
 FAT_destroyer_2_desc:0 "Designed as a replacement for the Essex-class, the Naga-class won its design competition through sheer cheapness, an important trait in the then failing Griffonian Empire. Despite its cost effectiveness the Naga-class did not skip on any of its abilities, even if it was prohibited from excelling. The result is an easily forgettable design that is nonetheless ubiquitous with fleet escorts."
 FAT_destroyer_3:0 "Riga II Class"
 FAT_destroyer_3_desc:0 "An attempt to repeat the success of the Riga I-class, the Riga II-class ended up being a certain amount of tons lighter, dropping it into the destroyer role. This turned out to be fortuitous, as a role had opened up to escort the Republic's new battleships. The second Riga would go down in history much like the first, as a success."
 FAT_destroyer_4:0 "Tatsumaki Class"
 FAT_destroyer_4_desc:0 "Named for the alleged whirlwind of firepower that it can unleash, the Tatsumaki-class' name instead become synonymous with the vast number of technical problems that plagued the design. Most of these problems can be attributed to the extremely hasty way in which they were both designed and constructed, and most of the same were fixed simply by doubling the number of mechanics and engineers assigned to each ship. Similar ventures would thus be referred to as 'pulling a tatsumaki' in the future."
 FAT_destroyer_5:0 "Whirlwind Class"
 FAT_destroyer_5_short:0 "Whirlwind Class"
 FAT_destroyer_5_desc:0 "In an attempt to redo the Tatsumaki-class without pulling a tatsumaki Blue Nose Clipperships went about creating the Whirlwind-class. This ship, while lacking anti-aircraft armament on several important vectors, was considered a success. Thus the design would continue serving for years until most of their number wound up destroyed by enemy airpower."
 FAT_destroyer_6:0 "Lola Class"
 FAT_destroyer_6_short:0 "Lola Class"
 FAT_destroyer_6_desc:0 "Designed for escort and picket duty the Lola-class was an excellent design whose only downside was a lack of crewspace. As the crews of these vessels were always quick to point out though, they would rather be cramped and uncomfortable than dead and dying. The Republican admiralty obviously agreed, and the design would see no less than three revisions that kept the design a recognizable name for many years after the global war."
 FAT_destroyer_7:0 "Davion Class"
 FAT_destroyer_7_short:0 "Davion Class"
 FAT_destroyer_7_desc:0 "The first block of Davion-class destroyers were a classic case of both political corruption and design by committee, leading to a ship so bad the only praise people had for it was, 'at least it's not a SoySoy.' Seeing potential in the design though, one aspiring engineer went back to the drawing board and reworked the ship from stem to stern. After convincing his superiors to make a prototype vessel the so-called Davion II-class was soon able to prove itself one of the most capable vessels in the fleet."
 FAT_light_cruiser_1:0 "Riga I Class"
 FAT_light_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Designed to cover the often overlooked role of destroyer flotilla leader the Riga-class filled that role admirably. So admirable was the ship in the role that it would serve in that role alongside even its replacements."
 FAT_light_cruiser_2:0 "Kyushu Class"
 FAT_light_cruiser_2_desc:0 "Designed to support in the transport and defense of invasion forces, the Kyushu-class features a staggering array of anti-aircraft armaments backed up by a not insubstantial number of main battery guns. Filling its designated role so well one would perhaps be shocked to learn that the design was taken from a merchant marine vessel, but that's exactly where it came from."
 FAT_light_cruiser_3:0 "Eagle Class"
 FAT_light_cruiser_3_desc:0 "Designed as an escort for the Thera-class carrier, the Eagle-class light cruiser had the majority of its capabilities designed around the much larger carrier. For instance, the original design notes for the vessel list its speed as '30% faster than the Thera-class.' Despite the odd method of design though, the ship would serve well until a critical flaw was discovered in its life support systems that would result in the entire class being recalled to port for an immediate overhaul."
 FAT_light_cruiser_4:0 "Quixote Class"
 FAT_light_cruiser_4_desc:0 "The Quixote-class, named for a kindly but insane nobleman, was yet another horrorshow of Republican procurement. Originally designed as a battlecrusier, the design was downgraded to cut costs multiple times until all that that was left was a light cruiser too slow to meet many battlefield roles, and to compound the error various factions within the government bought the class by the flotilla. In an attempt to get some use out of the class the admiralty ordered them converted to so-called 'torpedo escorts' until they could be replaced."
 FAT_light_cruiser_5:0 "Dante Class"
 FAT_light_cruiser_5_short:0 "Dante Class"
 FAT_light_cruiser_5_desc:0 "Designed to fill the roll of destroyer flotilla leader, the Dante-class features a good mix of speed, maneuverability, and firepower that makes it useful for raiding tactics. Unfortunately for the Dante-class, politics and budget cuts would conspire to see the ships languish for years until eventually being revived for a new purpose."
 FAT_light_cruiser_6:0 "Congress Class"
 FAT_light_cruiser_6_short:0 "Congress Class"
 FAT_light_cruiser_6_desc:0 "Named for the famous Congress of the Griffonian Republic, the Congress-class was conceived as a response to the boondoggle of the Quixote-class. As a result of this philosophy the ship is one of the fastest light cruisers of the era, and features an impressive gun armament. Not to skip on tradition though, the class would be mired in production difficulties due to a lawsuit from a shipyard in another nation over industrial espionage charges."
 FAT_light_cruiser_7:0 "Wagon Wheel Class"
 FAT_light_cruiser_7_short:0 "Wagon Wheel Class"
 FAT_light_cruiser_7_desc:0 "Named for the wagon trains so iconic to the frontier spirit the Griffonian Republic wished to embrace, the Wagon Wheel-class started out life as a transport. Despite the design's origins the vessels would be rapidly redesigned and reconfigured while still undergoing construction into heavily armed fast attack ships. In a complete contradiction of form this would turn out well for the Griffonian Republican Navy, and the vessels would serve well, even if it was in drastically reduced numbers."
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_1:0 "Cruiser Class"
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Manufactured during the same era as contemporaries such as the Aegis-class heavy cruiser, Black Lion I-class battlecruiser, and Dreadnought-class battleship as part of the Griffonian Empire's modernization program of 960, legend has it that the Cruiser-class was named by a committee headed by Captain Hobb V. Ess. Regardless of its name, and the poor design born from ignorance of ironclad combat, Chief of the Imperial General Staff James McHenna found them usable for the fleet's campaigns, and when Marshall Keremeskai brought the bulk of the Imperial Fleet in exile he wasn't picky enough to care about its shortcomings."
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_2:0 "Aegis Class"
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_2_desc:0 "The Aegis-class heavy cruiser is one of the oldest ironclad warships still in service, having first been been laid down in 961. It is a design that has proven itself time and time again thanks to the modularity of the design allowing for extensive upgrades to be made to keep it at the very peak of military modernity. The RNS Aegis of today is almost unrecognizable as the same ship laid down almost 50 years ago."
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_3:0 "Sovetskii Soyuz Class"
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_3_desc:0 "While publically meant as part of a massive modernization program the Sovetskii Soyuz-class, nicknamed the SoySoy, quickly gained a reputation for being one of the worst ship designs ever made. It was a massive ship that was undergunned, underarmored, and under-engined, but with an oversized cargo capacity and the ability for easy mass production. The ships and their crews were mocked by other cruiser crews, destroyer crews, and the merchant marine. Nevertheless the crews of the ships feel that they proved themselves as Q-ships against Zebrican pirates."
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_4:0 "Avatar Class"
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_4_desc:0 "Designed as a successor to the venerable Aegis-class the Avatar-class was beloved by its crews for its excellent balance of heavy guns, secondary guns, torpedoes, and anti-aircraft batteries, even if shipyards were never to fix the problem of electrical systems randomly shorting out without cause. The Avatar-class would serve the Republican Navy for years, even serving alongside its alleged replacement."
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_5:0 "Agamemnon Class"
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_5_short:0 "Agamemnon Class"
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_5_desc:0 "Designed in response to the failures of the Sovetskii Soyuz-class, the Agamemnon-class features reduced armor but weapons comparable to the Black Lion II-class battlecruiser and speed that is in a league of its own. Its abilities have led to entire squadrons of the Republican Navy being based around such vessels."
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_6:0 "Luxor Class"
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_6_short:0 "Luxor Class"
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_6_desc:0 "When the Republic called for a replacement for the beloved Avatar-class Mitchell Vehicles answered with a design that they had already been building, the Luxor-class. A scandal erupted when the CEO of Blue Nose Clipperships used his own influence in the government to ensure that the Luxor-class would win out the design competition over the Soyal-class. In an ironic turn of events, the Luxors would end up being used as decoys for enemy fleets so Soyals could aim better."
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_7:0 "Soyal Class"
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_7_short:0 "Soyal Class"
 FAT_heavy_cruiser_7_desc:0 "The lovechild, almost literally, of physicist Dr. Nicholas Grovland and industrialist-magician Waveform Steamer of Delhi Shipyards, the Soyal-class is perhaps the most advanced and oddest warship ever designed. Outmassing most battleships, the Soyal is based around a heavily modified railway gun designed to fire a one ton shell at more than three times the speed of sound to ranges that are still classified. While its development was racked with controversy at the start, the Soyal has emerged a success with the tagline of 'love is justice."
 FAT_battle_cruiser_1:0 "Black Lion II Class"
 FAT_battle_cruiser_1_desc:0 "Named for the famous Imperial Chief of the General Staff James McHenna's flagship, the Black Lion II-class is the successor to that famous battlecruiser line and saw a minor scandal erupt when someone attempted to call it the class the Black Lion-class while remaining the original battlecruisers to the Black Lion I-class. This was thankfully overridden by President Keremeskai himself as 'too confusing.' Scandals aside, the Black Lion II-class performed splendidly against  its opponents in the field."
 FAT_battle_cruiser_2:0 "Defender Class"
 FAT_battle_cruiser_2_desc:0 "A foreign contemporary of the old Dreadnaught-class battleships, the Defender-class battlecruisers have been rebought and refit by the Griffonian Republic to save on costs. While underarmored for their size the Defender-class maintains a large amount of speed and an impressive main battery of guns, meaning the ships can stay in the fight for long periods of time and do heavy damage just as long as they don't get shot."
 FAT_battle_cruiser_3:0 "Cameron Class"
 FAT_battle_cruiser_3_short:0 "Cameron Class"
 FAT_battle_cruiser_3_desc:0 "While the Republican Navy has suffered a large number of boondoggles in its lifetime perhaps none are so famous as the Cameron-class, the Widowmakers. Conceived as the magnum opus of ship design, able to replace every single cruiser and battleship in service at the time, the ships that set sail were death traps for their crews. An extensive investigation, media outcry, and refit program would see the design eventually end up as a sluggish second line command vessel."
 FAT_battleship_1:0 "Dreadnought Class"
 FAT_battleship_1_desc:0 "The grandfather of all warship designs currently sailing the seas today, the Dreadnought-class battleship was used by Imperial Chief of the General Staff James McHenna to leverage for a modernization of the Griffonian Imperial Navy by destroying a deceptively small island using the ship's guns. In the current era the ship class is mostly known as a popular museum ship, with the Dreadnought herself being captained by one Captain Gaff for just that roll."
 FAT_battleship_2:0 "Atreus Class"
 FAT_battleship_2_desc:0 "Designed following the Dreadnought-class, the Atreus-class battleship would quickly find itself synonymous with one word: excellence. Against all foes, and in all environments the Atreus-class proved itself again and again. It is no wonder then that Keremeskai took as many of the ships with him as he could when leaving the Empire."
 FAT_battleship_3:0 "Du Shi Wang Class"
 FAT_battleship_3_desc:0 "An older design from the days of the Empire that was not put into service till after its collapse, the Du Shi Wang-class was named after a famous immigrant from Zebrica to the empire. A problem child from the start, the Du Shi Wang-class was plagued by problems related to the 'counterrevolutionary' crew quarters of the ship being laid out by class instead of what their job was. Nevertheless, the ship gained a reputation for being ridiculously though, with the bow of one ship famously taking a direct hit from the GRS Soyal and surviving."
 FAT_battleship_4:0 "Monsoon Class"
 FAT_battleship_4_desc:0 "The Monsoon-class was the original attempt to improve upon the Dreadnaught-class, and it was such a standard-setter that the admiralty did their best to keep the ship in operation for many years despite it being outclassed by virtually every design since. This design in particular was the final attempt to restore these aging battleships. No more refits would be ordered after these."
 FAT_battleship_5:0 "Farragut Class"
 FAT_battleship_5_short:0 "Farragut Class"
 FAT_battleship_5_desc:0 "Designed as a showcase of new technology designed since the Exodus of Republican forces from Griffonia proper, the Farragut-class battleships are an impressive display of just that. Featuring improved radios, radar, and fire control the Farraguts have gained a reputation as some of the most powerful battleships sailing the seas today. Nevertheless, a combination of price hikes and the introduction of even more technologies would see the class replaced."
 FAT_battleship_6:0 "Texas Class"
 FAT_battleship_6_short:0 "Texas Class"
 FAT_battleship_6_desc:0 "While not the biggest battleship ever introduced the Texas-class nevertheless managed to make a splash when it first hit the waves. Featuring a good blend of speed, firepower, and armor the Texas was able to fill the niche of the 'fast battleship' well. Captains in command of this vessel were therefore advised to utilize their speed to make up for their lack in armaments, featuring only three double-barreled 15\" turrets with eight Killer Whale torpedo launchers."
 FAT_battleship_7:0 "McKenna Class"
 FAT_battleship_7_short:0 "McKenna Class"
 FAT_battleship_7_desc:0 "The pride of the Griffonian Republican Navy, and perhaps the most produced battleship in history, the McKenna-class rose above the 'ink blot scandal' to become one of the most deservedly famous designs around. Featuring three superfiring 18\" triple-barreled gun turrets, six torpedo turrets, and more secondary arms than one can shake a stick at the McKenna is truly impressive. So impressive was this vessel class in fact that Keremeskai himself moved his flag to the GRS McHenna's Pride upon the ship's completion."
 FAT_battleship_nuc:0 "Nightlord Class"
 FAT_battleship_nuc_short:0 "Nightlord Class"
 FAT_battleship_nuc_desc:0 "How does one improve upon perfection? If the Nightlord-class battleship is anything to go by then you start with a nuclear reactor and then use only the latest and greatest technology. The results can not be denied, but at the same time many observers point out that the ship's prohibitive costs will limit the number produced. That is perhaps why 'you can't put a price on perfection' is the marketing line for this vessel."
 FAT_SH_battleship_1:0 "Republic Class"
 FAT_SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "Originally called the Stefan Amaris-class, the Republic-class super battleships were pillaged from a horrid imperialist by Republican forces during the Exodus and consequently renamed to a more patriotic flavor. The ships were eventually refurbished to meet with additional modernization demands from the Republic government."
 FAT_SH_battleship_2:0 "Leviathan II Class"
 FAT_SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "The original Leviathan-class super battleships were turned into transports to assist in evacuation efforts. Thus, with the Leviathan II-class super battleship Blue Nose Clipperships decided to redo the design as it was meant to be. According to the admiralty, they did an adequate job."
 FAT_SH_battleship_3:0 "Leviathan III Class"
 FAT_SH_battleship_3_short:0 "Leviathan III Class"
 FAT_SH_battleship_3_desc:0 "The largest and most expensive warship ever produced, the new and modernized Leviathan III-class super battleship is advertised as the final word in naval dominance. Featuring four triple-barreled 18\" superfiring turrets, three heavy torpedo turrets mirrored on the port and starboard sides, and the thickest AAA and strongest all-around protection of any warship currently sailing it certainly seems to fit the bill. The only downside is its fuel consumption."
 FAT_carrier_1:0 "Conqueror Class"
 FAT_carrier_1_desc:0 "One of the strangest looking ships ever put into the water, the Conqueror-class aircraft carrier eventually become the basis for many future Griffonian designs. Carrying 45 aircraft of varying types, the Conqueror-class was an excellent first step in the quest for naval airpower by the griffons."
 FAT_carrier_2:0 "York Class"
 FAT_carrier_2_desc:0 "A refit of the venerable Riga I-class light cruiser, the York-class carrier was designed in the aftermath of the Exodus. Carrying 55 aircraft, the York-class was a worthy successor to the Riga I-class, and a true boon to the naval air arm. Interestingly enough, the York-class maintained much of its anti-aircraft armament, making it a terror for enemy torpedo bombers."
 FAT_carrier_3:0 "Thera Class"
 FAT_carrier_3_desc:0 "Designed in conjunction with the Eagle-class light cruiser, the Thera-class carrier carries 70 aircraft in order to achieve complete air-sea superiority. Not only did it achieve that goal, but the designers were also able to pack in a number of nasty surprises for any who go up against it. This includes but is not limited to a full company of marines, all of whom house housed within some of the most comfortable lodgings of any warship out there."
 FAT_carrier_4:0 "Samerkind I Class"
 FAT_carrier_4_desc:0 "85 aircraft make up the complement of the first block of the Samerkind-class carriers, making them some of the most terrifying aircraft dispensers in the world at the time of their introduction. These ships are notable not only for their impressive compliment of aircraft, but also for the economic boom they brought to Republican lands upon their construction. This economic prosperity would extend long past construction as, after being retired from military service, the Samerkinds were converted to cargo and passenger transports."
 FAT_carrier_5:0 "Samerkind II Class"
 FAT_carrier_5_short:0 "Samerkind II Class"
 FAT_carrier_5_desc:0 "The primary addition to the second block of Samerkind-class carriers was the addition of 10 more aircraft to bring the complement up to 95, but this wasn't all that was improved. Additional improvements included a new radar system, better engines, and more armor. While the Block IIs did not bring quite the economic prosperity that their predecessors did, they are nonetheless iconic."
 FAT_carrier_6:0 "Kitty Hawk Class"
 FAT_carrier_6_short:0 "Kitty Hawk Class"
 FAT_carrier_6_desc:0 "When insulting the CEO of a Griffonian shipbuilding company it is generally advised not to do it in such a way that he gets an idea for a new product. That was the mythological origins of the Kitty Hawk-class carrier, a ship that caused no end of controversy when it was first unveiled. Some were horribly insulted, others found it humorous to the point of hysterics, while still others tried to strike it from the naval record. Nevertheless, it existed, two were made, and both served with distinction."
 FAT_carrier_7:0 "New Syrtis Class"
 FAT_carrier_7_short:0 "New Syrtis Class"
 FAT_carrier_7_desc:0 "The New Syrtis-class carrier was designed to fit the requirement for direct fleet action in support of fleet elements such as battleships and heavy cruisers. To achieve the mission parameters the vessel was extensively armored and equipped with a variety of anti-ship weapons. Interestingly, the vessel also carries a flight crew double what its aircraft compliment actually is, this was done to allow for 24/7 combat air patrol."
 FAT_carrier_nuc:0 "Enterprise Class"
 FAT_carrier_nuc_short:0 "Enterprise Class"
 FAT_carrier_nuc_desc:0 "Conceived as the final word in supercarrier design, the Enterprise-class is one of the contenders for 'worst boondoggle in Republican Navy history.' The ship had more than 12 companies working on it over the course of its five year development cycle, and each one brought their own team of engineers and a new set of requirements. By the time it was time for the ship to launch even the new nuclear power plant of the vessel was unable to move it. The extremely public debace resulted in the resignation of at least one admiral."
 FAT_light_carrier_1:0 "Leopard CV Class"
 FAT_light_carrier_1_desc:0 "Featuring a small squadron of aircraft as its complement, the Leopard CV-class escort carrier is a derivative of the Leopard-class transport, as the name suggests. It was designed to be cheap, mass producible, and easy to maintain. Remarkably, it was not only to achieve those goals, it was able to become one of the most common light carriers in existence. Both private and public forces use this ship to great effect."
 FAT_light_carrier_2:0 "Titan Class"
 FAT_light_carrier_2_desc:0 "The design specifications for the Titan-class escort carrier called for a full battalion of aircraft for its complement. When it was pointed out that this didn't make sense the number of 32 aircraft was agreed upon instead. In service the Titan-class gained a reputation among pilots as the best posting they could get, with spacious accommodations, a large flight deck, and superior CAG facilities."
 FAT_light_carrier_3:0 "Vengeance Class"
 FAT_light_carrier_3_desc:0 "42 is the meaning of life, the universe, and everything for the crew of the Vengeance-class escort carrier. This complement of aircraft makes it almost as big as the old Conqueror-class, and it is something that everyone involved was well aware of. The Vengeance-class is seen not just as a capable vessel in its own right, but also as a mark of pride for the Republican Navy to show how far they had come."
 FAT_submarine_1:0 "Mako Class"
 FAT_submarine_1_desc:0 "The first submersible produced by the Griffonian Republic, the Mako-class was meant to fill the role of the corvette but in a much more stealthy fashion. It was a design requirement that did not work out well in simulation, so in a shocking turn of events they started over. The resulting submarine was extremely good at both commerce raiding and long range international operations, a winning design."
 FAT_submarine_2:0 "Fredasa Class"
 FAT_submarine_2_desc:0 "The Fredasa-class was the second attempt by the Republican Navy to innovate in the realm of submersible design, this time creating a picket ship. However, when the vessel was first spotted by foreign intelligence agencies they performed a careful analysis of it and came to the conclusion that it was a fast moving raider. Republican intelligence in turn picked up on this and relayed it to the navy, who decided that their enemies were right and reclassified the Fredasa-class."
 FAT_submarine_3:0 "Vincent Class"
 FAT_submarine_3_desc:0 "The first venture by the foreign based Delhi Shipyards into the Republican market, the Vincent-class was made to have the longest range sonar of any submarine yet produced. That, along with the ability to install modular upgrades to the design as needed, provided the basis for a long life for the class. Shipping under the command of the Republic's enemies' soon learned to fear the vessel and its many Barracuda torpedoes."
 FAT_submarine_4:0 "Bonaventure Class"
 FAT_submarine_4_desc:0 "A typical attempt by the Griffonian Republic to revive an aging design, the Bonaventure-class would see far less success than other ships that underwent a similar process. The problems lay in the simple fact that the vessel was too noisy and too lightly armed for the battlefield it now found itself in. All in all only a few Bonaventure-class vessels would be refurbished before the design was replaced."
 FAT_submarine_5:0 "Pinto Class"
 FAT_submarine_5_short:0 "Pinto Class"
 FAT_submarine_5_desc:0 "Sporting double the armament of Barracudas as the earlier Vincent-class one would think that the Pinto-class would become notable for its firepower. Instead, the Pinto-class became famous for falling through the cracks, with many examples ending up in the navies of foreign nations through a suspicious lack of paperwork."
 FAT_submarine_6:0 "Inazuma Class"
 FAT_submarine_6_short:0 "Inazuma Class"
 FAT_submarine_6_desc:0 "The Inazuma-class submarine was designed to strike like lightning, hence the name. To this possible it utilized a bevy of forward-facing weapons, and the largest engines ever put into a submarine up to that point. It was a design that seemed on the track to greatness till the shipyards where it was being constructed blew up. Taking it as a divine sign the owners of the shipyard increased security and refitted the shipyard to only supply, not build."
 FAT_submarine_7:0 "Zechetinu Class"
 FAT_submarine_7_short:0 "Zechetinu Class"
 FAT_submarine_7_desc:0 "One of the smallest and lightest warships of its era, the Zechetinu-class was also one of its most capable. Nicknamed the Zec, the vessel was small and cramped and as such only a month away from port was the norm to keep crews sane. The new diesel-electric engine allowed for unparalleled quietness and speed, and its White Shark torpedo complement ensured a swift end for its enemies."
 FAT_submarine_nuc:0 "Fox Class"
 FAT_submarine_nuc_short:0 "Fox Class"
 FAT_submarine_nuc_desc:0 "The Fox-class was originally designated the RX-78 and was the first nuclear powered submarine produced by the Griffonian Republic. In typical Republican Navy fashion the design was beset by delays, this time by foreign actors, but the shipyard staff were able to rise above it all and produce a vessel that could stay underwater for months and travel around the world to deliver a massive barrage of 8 forward facing Barracuda torpedoes to its targets."

 # Ships and Equipment #
 
 ship_hull_light_5:0 "Modern Conventional Destroyer Hull"
 ship_hull_light_5_short:0 "Modern Conventional Destroyer"
 ship_hull_light_5_desc:0 "These destroyer hulls are the ultimate incarnation of what was once the torpedo boat destroyer: fast, well-armed, and excellent sub-hunters, the destroyer has become a mainstay of the fleet as a light escort and as the prime ASW naval vessel. Though some naval designers believe that we've hit the peak point for this kind of destroyer, these are still a significant threat to submersibles and capital ships."
 ship_hull_light_6:0 "Early Guided-Missile Destroyer Hull"
 ship_hull_light_6_short:0 "Early Guided-Missile Destroyer"
 ship_hull_light_6_desc:0 "Missile technology has advanced to the point where a single weapons system can perform multiple roles and the newest generation of destroyer hulls follows this development. These still act as the primary escort and submarine hunter. However, with the integration of new missile systems, these destroyers can now effectively engage enemy aircraft."

 ship_hull_cruiser_5:0 "Modern All-Gun and Fleet Cruiser Hulls"
 ship_hull_cruiser_5_short:0 "Modern All-Gun and Fleet Cruisers"
 ship_hull_cruiser_5_desc:0 "New thinking in naval warfare has drastically changed pre-existing roles that cruisers fulfilled, causing a paradigm shift in cruiser designs. As such, new cruiser hulls are generally of a lower displacement, making these ships more suitable to their new fleet auxiliary duties. Despite their diminishing value, these cruisers are at the cutting edge."
 ship_hull_cruiser_6:0 "Early Guided-Missile Frigate and Cruiser Hulls"
 ship_hull_cruiser_6_short:0 "Early Missile Frigates and Cruisers"
 ship_hull_cruiser_6_desc:0 "In light of the adoption of missile weapons, cruisers are now in a strange position as military vessels. These new frigate and cruiser hulls pack a surprisingly large amount of firepower in small ships when mounted with the appropriate missile weapons system and magical armour scheme."

 ship_hull_heavy_5:0 "Modern All-Gun Battleship Hull"
 ship_hull_heavy_5_short:0 "Modern All-Gun Battleship"
 ship_hull_heavy_5_desc:0 "The golden age of the battleship and battlecruisers is rapidly passing as the threats to these large warships become insurmountable. Our advances in computing and fire directors can still make the primary weapons of new designs powerful and deadly, making for a superb offshore artillery platform that is lethal at range. However, the cost of constructing and maintaining these large hulls is very high, and only a few die-hard proponents actively campaign for an expansion of our battleship and battlecruiser programmes."

 ship_hull_heavy_6_desc:0 "A final attempt by traditionalists to maintain the battleship and battlecruiser relevant in this new age, contemporary hull designs seek to upgrade most of the vessels' arsenal with the latest in cruise missile technology. These ships still boast the terrifying heavy artillery from yesteryear. However, due to their vulnerability, any new battleship or battlecruiser will be relegated to fire support duties, such as shore bombardment."

 ship_hull_carrier_4:0 "Jet Aircraft Carrier Hull"
 ship_hull_carrier_4_short:0 "Jet Aircraft Carrier"
 ship_hull_carrier_4_desc:0 "The next generation of aircraft carriers must be compatible with naval jet aircraft, which require a more extended flight deck and protection from the jet blast hazards for our deck crew. An angled flight deck built into the hull facilitates jet operations, and jet blast deflectors will keep our flight deck crew safe."
 ship_hull_carrier_5:0 "Modern Fleet Carrier Hull"
 ship_hull_carrier_5_short:0 "Modern Fleet Carrier"
 ship_hull_carrier_5_desc:0 "New hulls for modern aircraft carriers are mostly refined versions of the previous jet aircraft carriers, with pre-planned structures to allow for easier integration of contemporary RADAR and computer systems and the mounting of SAM systems. With plenty of space for hangars decks, these vessels are large enough to transport and operate about as many air wings as a decently-sized land airbase, allowing these modern carriers to exert air power far and wide. "
 ship_hull_supercarrier_1:0 "Supercarrier Hull"
 ship_hull_supercarrier_1_desc:0 "Technically not an actual class, the supercarrier might easily be the largest vessel ever put to sea. The hull is effectively an oversized version of the fleet carrier hull, made to be able to house additional hangar decks or armaments. It is so massive that it can easily carry double the number of planes that a more conventional fleet carrier can, capable of asserting our air supremacy wherever it goes. There is, quite literally, nowhere that our naval craft can't strike."

 ship_hull_submarine_5:0 "Early Attack Submarine Hull"
 ship_hull_submarine_5_short:0 "Early Attack Submarine"
 ship_hull_submarine_5_desc:0 "Attack submarines are a continuation of the previous hunter-killer classes. Far larger to accommodate additional torpedoes, larger engines, more sophisticated fire controls, and finer centimetric radar arrays, attack submarines can stay submerged almost indefinitely so long as the fuel and batteries last. Knowing just how difficult life is for submariners, crew comfort is a high priority: we've given them relatively spacious crew quarters and air conditioning!"
 ship_hull_submarine_6:0 "True Attack Submarine Hull"
 ship_hull_submarine_6_short:0 "True Attack Submarine"
 ship_hull_submarine_6_desc:0 "New iterations of previous attack submarines, these new hulls are made to mount specialised launch tubes capable of using sophisticated electronic decoys. Unlike previous models, these are better suited to fool acoustic torpedoes and thus, vastly improves the survivability of our new submarines, something that our sailors will be grateful for. "
 ship_hull_cruiser_submarine_2:0 "Advanced Cruiser Submarine"
 ship_hull_cruiser_submarine_2_desc:0 "A submarine far larger than its predecessor, this improved cruise submarine hull can carry higher capacity batteries and more fuel, giving immense range. With such submarines, we can strike from well over half a world away!"
 ship_hull_missile_submarine_1:0 "Cruise Missile Submarine Hull"
 ship_hull_missile_submarine_1_short:0 "Cruise Missile Submarine"
 ship_hull_missile_submarine_1_desc:0 "The continued development of missile technology offers a tempting opportunity for our newest submarines. Cruise missile submarines are powerful vessels, as they can carry the devastating reach and firepower of cruise missiles with the stealth of submarines. With their cruise missile and torpedo weaponry, these submarines can strike any target, submerged, surface, or terrestrial, with destructive precision. Only another submarine can reliably sink a cruise missile submarine!"

After the Storm Kingdom's collapse, he found himself stranded in Zumidia, where he briefly work at an hippogriffian automobile factory, before travelling back to Roam and starting his career in the military.  For his initiative in the assault of the city of Aureliss, he was promoted to legate by the Kaiser."

 newsroam.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Unexpectedly for the whole world, a new strong state has emerged in Southeastern Zebrica over the past few years. Having begun his victorious march by uniting and capturing the trading cities on the Assini River, a zebra, who calls himself Augustus, today solemnly proclaimed the creation of the Southeastern Zebrican Empire after subjugating the central Southeast by his legions. After the fall of the Zongo, few in the region may attempt to challenge its status."

 ROA_legionaries_idea_desc:0 "Centuries ago, the griffons of the Romau Legion found themselves stranded on the shores of southern Zebrica. Initially working as mercenaries for griffon cartographers, merchants, and explorers, in 807 they founded the city of Roam in the midst of a Zeblu invasion. The city has prospered ever since, with the legion forming the centrepiece of its military. And far from being the only legion now, its traditions have been spread by Augustus to all forces of the Assini."
 ROA_aspiring_empire_idea:0 "Aspiring Empire"
 ROA_aspiring_empire_idea_desc:0 "Kaiser Augustus, commander of the Assini militias, can certainly be said to be an ambitious stallion. After he removed weak and indecisive city governments from power, he quickly mobilized the economy and started to look for opportunities for conquest. While he framed his first strikes as retaking Assini cities, he since dropped any pretence. Roam marches to war, to forge an empire like Zebrica has never seen."

 exodus_decimate_portion_tt:0 "[?decimation_portion|%Y] of this state's population and factories will be §Rdestroyed§!.\n"
 assimilate_no_prop_tt:0 "\n§gOur current §YRefugee Assimilation Factor§! is below 0, and we are thus unable to passively assimilate any refugees. Perusing a §ONationwide Assimilation Drive§! or seeking to §OExpel Refugees§! will still yield results, however.§!\n"

 ### Assimilation Decisions
 exodus_refugee_assimilation:0 "Refugees"
 exodus_refugee_assimilation_desc:0 "As states are conquered across the lands, §Yrefugees§! will flee new occupation and seek to start anew elsewhere. When such refugees reach our nation, they join our §OUnassimilated Refugee§! pool. We can §Gassimilate§! these §Yrefugees§! for a ponypower boost in our core states, either by letting time play out or through making a conscious political effort. \n\nCurrently we have [?unassimilated_refugees|Y0] §OUnassimilated Refugees§! across the nation. This is [?refugee_to_core_ratio|%R] of our §Ycore population§!, and we thus suffer a [?ratio_modifier_stab|%R] §Ystability impact§!. \n\nSince the start of the game, [?all_time_refugees|Y0] §ORefugees§! have arrived in our nation, of whom [?all_time_assimilate|Y0] have §Gassimilated§! and [?all_time_expelled|Y0] have been §Rexpelled§! to date."
 exodus_assimilation_pulse_mission:0 "Passive Refugee Assimilation"
 exodus_assimilation_pulse_mission_desc:0 "Every four weeks, a fraction of our total §OUnassimilated Refugees§! will integrate evenly across our §Ycore states§!, bolstering our §Yponypower pool§! proportional to our §OAssimilation Proportion§!. This proportion depends on §Ynational spirits§!, §Ytechnologies§! and §Ysociety development level§!."
 nationwide_assimilation_drive:0 "Nationwide Assimilation Drive"
 nationwide_assimilation_drive_desc:0 "Through the expenditure of some political will, we can integrate a month's worth of §Orefugees§! straight into our civilian population. Handy in a pinch, it'll also help to alleviate the stability penalty from §OUnassimilated Refugees§!."
 nationwide_assimilation_drive_trig_tt:0 "There are more §OUnassimilated Refugees§! than we have §Ocore states§! §g(currently [?num_core_states])§!"
 assimilation_drive_tt:0 "A total of £manpower_texticon §G[?pulse_assimilate|0]§! §YRefugees§! §g(representing approximately §G15%§! of the total pool)§! will §Gassimilate§! into states across nation, becoming §Ycivilians§!.\n\n"
 expel_refugees:0 "Turn Away Refugees"
 expel_refugees_desc:0 "While we'd much prefer to assimilate the sizable number of refugees in our nation, the sheer number of them relative to our own core population makes this entirely unfeasible. Instead, we're going to have to turn a portion of our refugee population away from our lands to maintain stability."
 expel_refugees_trig_tt:0 "§OUnassimilated Refugees§! are causing more than a §R15%§! §Ystability§! penalty."
 expel_refugees_tt:0 "A total of £manpower_texticon §G[?refugees_expelled|0]§! §YRefugees§! §g(representing approximately §R20%§! of the total pool)§! will be §Rexpelled§! from our nation to maintain stability.\n\n"
 ## Game Rule
 RULE_PROJECT_EXODUS_TOGGLE:0 "Refugee and Decimation Toggle"
 RULE_PROJECT_EXODUS_DEFAULT:0 "Enabled"
 RULE_PROJECT_EXODUS_DEFAULT_DESC:0 "§OProject EqExodus§!, Old World Blues' custom refugee and decimation system morphed with permission for Equestria at War, will be enabled. Refugees will leave states and travel to nations. This is the default option."
 RULE_PROJECT_EXODUS_DECIMATION_ONLY:0 "Decimation-Only"
 RULE_PROJECT_EXODUS_DECIMATION_ONLY_DESC:0 "§OProject EqExodus§!, Old World Blues' custom refugee and decimation system morphed with permission for Equestria at War, will be mostly disabled. Ponypower and factories will still be removed from states when conquered, but calculations won't be done to determine where these wind up. This option retains core anti-snowballing factors needed for the mod, but curbs almost all calculation."
 RULE_PROJECT_EXODUS_DISABLED:0 "Entirely Disabled"
 RULE_PROJECT_EXODUS_DISABLED_DESC:0 "§OProject EqExodus§!, Old World Blues' custom refugee and decimation system morphed with permission for Equestria at War, will be disabled wholesale. While this will be a slight performance save, especially if multiple rapid-moving wars are occuring at once, it will significantly unbalance the game in favour of stronger early-game powers. \n\n§RDisabling the system is highly discouraged.§!"
 RULE_PROJECT_EXODUS_DEBUG:0 "Enabled with DEBUG"
 RULE_PROJECT_EXODUS_DEBUG_DESC:0 "§OProject EqExodus§!, Old World Blues' custom refugee and decimation system morphed with permission for Equestria at War, will be enabled in §Odebug mode§!, writing significant information to the game log for later analysis. While this can be manually enabled by setting the global flag \"exodus_debug\" during a game, this option allows testing games to have it enabled by default. \n\n§RThis option may be somwhat laggy. Don't use it for normal gameplay.§!"

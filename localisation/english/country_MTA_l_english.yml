 MTA_CSI:0 "Magical Artifact Collectors"
 MTA_CSI_desc:0 "The Magocracy of Maretania is a haven of magical research, a realm ruled by mages for hundreds of years. The study of magic as a scientific discipline is their forte, and the protection of powerful magical artifacts is their mission. Their mission teams, composed of powerful trained mages who can take on platoons by themselves, scour the world for rumors of new artifacts, and secure them in The Cave so they can remain in responsible hooves for all eternity."

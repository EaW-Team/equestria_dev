 ### Void's notes for characterization of the recurring characters in Maretania
 # Dr. Mushriq - More sociopathic and willing to destroy artifacts
 # Dr. Altarus - More scientifically minded and willing to analyze artifacts (male)
 # Mr. Alqatat - Master of Paperwork and Legalese - Good manipulator too.
 # Dr. Miftah -  Bureaucratic overworked analysts who wants to make things better. (female)
 
 ### Augenis adds a few stuff
 # Mustafa (name pending) - A young, lowly janitor employed in the CSI. Seemingly complacent with being a nobody in the organization, appears dreaming every once in a while, hoping of great things one day.
 
 ### TO HORSEWORDERS COMING HERE TO WRITE ARTIFACT ENTRIES
 # First of all, welcome
 # Second of all, the loc entries you will need to fill for each artifact are kinda esoteric, yes, but that's because I'm wrangling a completely different system out of HoI4 here
 # First thing you need to know is that all artifacts have an ID, and you will need to fill in loc for your artifact according to that untaken ID
 # "Test Artifact" has an ID of 1, for ex., and so you can find their loc by replacing [ID] with the number 1 in the listed entries below \/\/\/
 
 # Things needed to fill out:
 ## Artifact name and description - "GetMTAArtifactName_[ID]_tt" "GetMTAArtifactDesc_[ID]_tt" 
 ## Event for experimenting with the artifact, where the CSI figures out how dangerous your artifact is via scientific testing - "marcsi.2.d[ID]"
 ## Event for activating the artifact, where the CSI activates your artifact and it does its effect - "marcsi.3.d[ID]"
 ## Event or event chain for the CSI discovering your artifact. I don't have any specific entries here. Speak to me on your idea and I'll add as many events as you need for it.
 
 ## To test, load up the game as Maretania and fire event marcsi.1000 via console. Your artifacts will be added to the Cave and you will see a "The Cave" button in the politics menu, at the top. There you can see the name and description. To see experimentation events, let time pass a few hours, you will receive decisions to interact with all owned artifacts and yours should be there as well.
 
 ## Speak to Void on any questions regarding characterization or stuff btw.

 ### FOCUS ###
 MTA_after_storm_king:0 "The Passing of the Storm"
 MTA_after_storm_king_desc:0 "As the dust settles from the Storm King, it is clear that we have taken heavy damage. Several cities and strongholds have been levelled and burned to the ground, and where there once were bustling markets and research facilities now lie only ruins and abandoned debris.\n\nIf we are to continue the CSI, we must rebuild."
 MTA_gather_wayward_agents:0 "Contact Wayward Agents"
 MTA_gather_wayward_agents_desc:0 "As the Storm King raged through the continent, the archives and communication stations were destroyed, stranding several teams of agents around the world. Though many of them have since found themselves independent livings, there are also many that we need to call back, for their expertise, if nothing else."
 MTA_reorganize_research_teams:0 "Reorganize CSI Structure"
 MTA_reorganize_research_teams_desc:0 "Before, the armed forced of Maretania ad-hoc and largely put together whenever we needed a team for a purpose. With the changing times, this cannot continue. We need to fundamentally restructure our mission teams so that they are equipped to handle whatever comes their way."
 MTA_slacken_recruitment:0 "Slacken Recruitment Procedures"
 MTA_slacken_recruitment_desc:0 "As much as we may dislike it, we cannot continue on not even half strength of personnel. Though the protocols for recruiting new agents and analysts are strict, they may be too strict for the time that we now find ourselves in. Not just due to the fact that people are getting smarter, but just as well due to so many dead."
 MTA_restore_outreach_office:0 "Restore the Council of Outreach"
 MTA_restore_outreach_office_desc:0 "Though the Council usually operates in secret, it does have one interface with the rest of the world. The Council of Outreach officially operates in a wierd limbo between a number of private organizations and the Magocracy. In reality, those are but fronts for the Council to communicate with other powers for their cooperation. And as we get back on our hooves, we will need everyone to know it."
 MTA_consolidate_mareib_core:0 "Consolidate the Mareib Stronghold"
 MTA_consolidate_mareib_core_desc:0 "Mareib has always been the core of the Council and the Magocracy as a whole. With the Storm King's rage, however, large parts are in ruins and will need rebuilidng. After all, now is the day and now is the hour to rebuild what was lost and make it greater than before."
 MTA_restore_order_marekalla:0 "Ascend to Marekalla's Mountains"
 MTA_restore_order_marekalla_desc:0 "As the Storm King raged through the Maretanian lands, bandits and robbers took over the Marekalla Mountains. Even if they are irrelevant in the long run, the fact that we may need to establish bases there at a later date to handle our operations makes clearing them out a necessity. With force, if we must."
 MTA_restore_order_beihoof:0 "Clear Out the Beihoof Forests"
 MTA_restore_order_beihoof_desc:0 "As with Marekalla, so with Beihoof. Not only does this pose a good place to contain artifacts that rely on nature in some way, the forests themselves also make for good cover from any airplanes, pegasi or hippogrifs getting the bright idea to fly over without us needing to bring out the flak."
 MTA_provisional_code:0 "Provisional Code on Civilian Contact"
 MTA_provisional_code_desc:0 "Though the Council remains the primary driver of the Magocracy, missions and pinpoint strikes don't happen without the goods produced in publicly visible facilities. And though the Council lacks the interest to interact with the world at large, it still poses the problem of the need for civilians every once in a while. We need some way to guide the interactions. A code."
 MTA_feed_impoverished:0 "Feed the Impoverished"
 MTA_feed_impoverished_desc:0 "'The Army Marches On Its Stomach'\nSomeone once said it about the military. And though it rings true for the military, it also rings just as true in the civillian life. Though we have our own food supplies, the broad population of Maretania can barely feed themselves. Feeding them would not only provide a support base, but also gain us a better workforce."
 MTA_analysis_committee:0 "The Committee for Analysis"
 MTA_analysis_committee_desc:0 "One of the old organs of the CSI has been the Committee for Analysis. Pouring through tomes and books, old and new to find new artifacts to gather, as well as analyzing the results for further use, they are the drivers of data in the Council. It is high time that it is restored to its full glory."
 MTA_scientific_solutions:0 "Scientific Solutions"
 MTA_scientific_solutions_desc:0 "Magic and spells are flashy and they do a lot for the Magocracy. But the times are changing and we need to change with them lest we be left in the dust that the march of progress is kicking up. No. The Committee for Analysis must get involved in this and in time, come up with the new solutions for how we can best utilize our meager resources."
 MTA_open_the_cave:0 "The Cave"
 MTA_open_the_cave_desc:0 "Finally, we have reestablished control of Maretania and have gathered enough resources and equipment to pursue our goal for so long, to open the Cave and to restart our primary activities."
 
 MTA_steam_and_stone:0 "An Age of Steam and Stone"
 MTA_steam_and_stone_desc:0 "It is indeed a new age. An age of magic and machines, of fire and steam. And though the old ways have served us well, there are also many new inventions in the world that we can make use of in our activities. We may be old, but we are not idiots."
 MTA_blacksite_industry:0 "Magical Industry Sites"
 MTA_blacksite_industry_desc:0 "Many mountain valleys and desolate fields lie unused around Maretania. Without any prying eyes looking too close at our activities, we have an excellent opportunity to establish several sites around Maretania that can silently and quietly develop new technologies for our purposes without anyone noticing."
 MTA_grease_free_market:0 "Grease the Wheels of the Market"
 MTA_grease_free_market_desc:0 "Even if we are to remain in control when all is said and done, we cannot micromanage the economy down to the smallest tidbit. The crux lies in the smallholders. The owners of a single factory or the family farm. Those that have been in the business for a generation that we need to encourage. Agents will be sent around on campaigns to get the market going."
 MTA_crystal_cave_mines:0 "Caves to Crystal Mines"
 MTA_crystal_cave_mines_desc:0 "The caves that we once stored the artifacts in before moving them out due to security concerns can still be used. Indeed, the caves are themselves old goldmines before the crystals became relevant for electricity. But they are chock-full of crystals. We just need to clear out the old ceiling and flooring and we will have burgeoning mines on our hooves."
 MTA_crystal_electrification:0 "Crystal-Fueled Electrification"
 MTA_crystal_electrification_desc:0 "There are many things crystals are good for. Storing magic. Expelling magic, and a new invention, transferring magic. Crystal powder in cables with silver or copper can give an extremely effective transfer of power. Just like in Equestria. The electrification, bound no longer by power plants on every street corner can go ahead."
 MTA_shadow_wealth_distribution:0 "Shadow Wealth Distribution"
 MTA_shadow_wealth_distribution_desc:0 "The Bank of Maretania. Officially a rather neutral affair with a single branch office in Flowena and an unassuming headquarters in Mareib. Not told is the massive network of industries, laboratories and companies that it controls on behalf of the Council. A place to discreetly move funding around without nosy inspectors looking around."
 MTA_literacy_agency:0 "Civilian Literacy Development"
 MTA_literacy_agency_desc:0 "To build a strong nation, you must start from the bottom. The ABCs and 123s. This is where we come in. With a distressing few number of people in Maretania that can actually read and write outside of the Council, we need to create a homegrown literary population. The old ways of relying on the outside world for skilled mages cannot be go on with hostile powers everywhere."
 MTA_experimentation_code:0 "Code on Applied Research"
 MTA_experimentation_code_desc:0 "There are some fields that are just too dangerous to go around in without adequate protection. And other fields that one should not be stepped in unless one can present 47 stamped and signed forms that indicate that, yes, they can do this. This has been ad-hoc, but with the recent changes, it is high time to formalize this into a codified set of rules."
 MTA_induct_new_scientists:0 "Induct Talented Youth"
 MTA_induct_new_scientists_desc:0 "Talent is what science runs on. Around Maretania, numerous talented bright young things are developing their faculties, looking around the world and wondering what lies beyond. Unfortunately, many of those are lost on the floor as they cannot afford the education necessary and are forced to work for meager pay. And we must stop this cycle. For nothing else, ourselves."
 MTA_magical_manufactures:0 "Magical Manufactures"
 MTA_magical_manufactures_desc:0 "Lastly, the manufacturies are the key to it all. Without the lamps, the paper or even the chairs, the Council is nothing. As it stands, they are mostly dancing to our tune, whenever we need something. Still, it is only right for something in return. Upgrading the machine tools used. Connected to electricity, they need not their own large power source, when we provide to them."
 MTA_paths_to_rails:0 "Mountain Paths to Railroads"
 MTA_paths_to_rails_desc:0 "Goat paths. Paths trampled flat and navigable by hooves over several generations.\nThat is what roads outside of the cities, barring a few major arteries consist of. And that will simply not do. The demands of a new age require that it be beasts of iron and steel that tie Maretania together. A gun will not do much good for us all if it is sitting in a storehouse far, far away."
 MTA_beihoof_railroads:0 "Cleave the Beihoof Forests"
 MTA_beihoof_railroads_desc:0 "The Beihoof Forests have long been a place of thinking and a source of wood for ships. But times are changing and we must move with them. The Beihoof Forests are close to several major centres of manufacturing and research and they need expanding. Shame, but progress is made by the bold."
 MTA_marekalla_port:0 "Foster Shipping in Marekalla"
 MTA_marekalla_port_desc:0 "Marekalla is our entrepot to the world. From here, the ships set sail for far-off lands, bringing back important goods and stories of artifacts to be secured later. But Marekalla has seen better days, especially with the Storm King swinging by. But the entrepot remains, and we need to make substantial improvements here."
 MTA_fake_gold_rushes:0 "Manufacture Gold Rushes"
 MTA_fake_gold_rushes_desc:0 "Ah, the unsettled wilderness, ready to put under plow and to be exploited for the good of the Magocracy. Unfortunately, people are unwilling to leave their lives to go out and make a living as a yeoman or a miner...unless they are 'encouraged' by the prospects of gold in the fields. A few gold nuggets in the right place can do wonders for the rumours."
 MTA_expand_crystal_mines:0 "Survey Untapped Deposits"
 MTA_expand_crystal_mines_desc:0 "Crystals are everywhere, but not all crystals can be used. Some are just too impure, others, too small. Some, most actually are just unable to contain the magic needed for the use in industry and equipment. Our challenge, and problem at a later date will be to find those deposits that should geologicall exist right under us, but we can't find."
 MTA_offshore_drilling:0 "Offshore Drilling Potential"
 MTA_offshore_drilling_desc:0 "Oil. The lifeblood of so many nations outside of our own. And though magic can do well, there comes a time and a place where it becomes necessary to turn to other, more pedestrian means of powering our wheelas and grids. Large deposits have been ascertained to be available just off the South Coast. Maybe there is an opportunity there?"
 
 
 MTA_service_for_the_world:0 "Serve the Good of the World"
 MTA_service_for_the_world_desc:0 "The artifacts, useful as they may be are too dangerous to be left. The Idol of Boreas was bad enough, but what if an even more powerful artifact appeared or someone was able to break into the cave? The armed forces of the CSI serve not for imperialism or conquest - but to make sure that this does not happen, ever. For the good of the world."
 MTA_get_infantry_equipment:0 "Mundane Weaponry Manufacturing"
 MTA_get_infantry_equipment_desc:0 "Magic is big and flashy, but lead and steel still goes a long way to ward off attackers without blowing cover. Indeed, the new guns are easier to reload, and don't put as much strain on the mage. And they can be operated by the auxiliaries without much danger."
 MTA_storm_king_strats:0 "Handbook on Stormlandian Doctrine"
 MTA_storm_king_strats_desc:0 "There are Thirty Stratagems on Warfare. Each of those have been passed down the chain of master and apprentice for many, many years. And this is where we need to step in. The knowledge decays as people add and remove from it in their heads, and this is our chance to get it down on paper, before it is too late."
 MTA_central_manufacturing:0 "Centralize Armament Production"
 MTA_central_manufacturing_desc:0 "Guns, muskets and rifles. All different, all from a thousand differet gunsmiths. And worst of all is the equipment for the CSI. As it stands, they are hopelessly outdated. Until now. Everyone producing guns will get a set of regulations that they will have to follow...or else..."
 MTA_beyond_onhooves:0 "Beyond Just Onhooves"
 MTA_beyond_onhooves_desc:0 "Hooves are all well and good, after all they have served us for countless millenia. But the demands of a modern expedition; food, tools and communications means that the old ways are fading. Cars and trucks are needed for the new type of expeditions."
 MTA_armor_focus:0 "Union of Magic and Steel"
 MTA_armor_focus_desc:0 "Magic and Steel. Thesis is that Magic is better. Antithesis is that the new steel is better. And the Synthesis is the union of both. Steel hardened by magic and magic backed up by steel. For out of many, there comes one, and one with the strength to stand against the might of everything."
 MTA_air_focus:0 "Above Riseia's Mountains"
 MTA_air_focus_desc:0 "There is a clear and present need to rise above the mountains and to soar. For the artifacts may lie in the ground or sit on shelves and wait for someone to find them. But it may not always be us who are the first there. There will be other groups and people who will try to obtain them for their own good. In this, planes will only help to be there in a quick and efficient manner."
 MTA_navy_focus:0 "Assemble a Fleet"
 MTA_navy_focus_desc:0 "Not all artifacts are based on land. Some are seaborne, floating around in the great blue beyond, while other rest at the bottom of the sea. And while small ships do a lot for the small places, once the coastal waters are left behind, they will get sunk by the waves. No, we need ocean-going ships for our operations, and we need them soon."
 MTA_civilian_auxiliary:0 "Maretanian Civilian Auxiliary"
 MTA_civilian_auxiliary_desc:0 "Even if the CSI is skilled, the agents and the soldiers are few in number and each one is a precious resource that cannot be afforded to be spilled or thrown away. But there are other ways to secure volunteers and guards that don't have to be involved in the entire business. People, that can be told to guard a building, without knowing what is in it for example."
 MTA_manufacture_patriotism:0 "Construct Patriotism"
 MTA_manufacture_patriotism_desc:0 "Maretania has always been something of an artificial construct. Centered around literal ivory-tower intellectuals, the state has always served as an extended arm of the Magocracy. And the people don't feel investment in the same. But there is history to use and to exploit. To make them feel for their home as more than a home, but a higher calling."
 MTA_volunteer_privileges:0 "Grant Privileges to Volunteers"
 MTA_volunteer_privileges_desc:0 "If there is one benefit to a nation of peasants and workers, it is that they are easy to dazzle. Privileged access to things like machines and magic can go a long way into winning the loyalty of those that have chosen to serve us, and, to encourage others to sign up for the auxilliaries as well."
 MTA_streamline_coordination:0 "Streamline CSI-Auxiliary Coordination"
 MTA_streamline_coordination_desc:0 "The CSI is like a scalpel. Precise, but few in numbers and only to be used where it calls for delicate operations. In contrast, the auxiliaries are like a hammer or an axe. It is a brute force, and can smash with great ferocity, but the discreetness is out of the window. But a good force needs both. They need both to function, and to enhance each other." 
 MTA_fortifications:0 "The Marekalla Holdout"
 MTA_fortifications_desc:0 "Marekalla is a manufacturing nexus of Maretania, as well as being the entrepot. With Mareib having the possibility of coming under siege at a later date, we have begun preparations to use Marekalla as an alternative headquarters, should it prove necessary."
 MTA_secret_war:0 "The Secret War"
 MTA_secret_war_desc:0 "Behind the scenes, moving unseen. A reckoning being delivered by agents all around the world, operating in the shadows. They are the soldiers in a secret worldwide war, one waged not with cannons and swords, but small arms and blackmail. Everything that moves, viewed through those eyes and filtered back to their masters."
 MTA_csi_agents_war:0 "The Council's Own"
 MTA_csi_agents_war_desc:0 "If there is one thing the CSI is skilled at, it is operating in the shadows. For many years, we have worked and died in the dark, for the world to live in the light. The wider world will not know of our activities, and if they do, it will be because we want it to happen."
 MTA_magic_espionage:0 "Artifact-Aided Espionage"
 MTA_magic_espionage_desc:0 "Artifacts are many things. There are those with danger of escaping. Those that will not escape. Those that may end up escaping are also there. And then there's a separate category. Those artifacts that help us secure other artifacts...or help us dispose of unwelcome intruders."
 MTA_assassination_analysis:0 "Target Their Weak Links"
 MTA_assassination_analysis_desc:0 "A Cold Fury. A Reckoning. Death comes for all some day. And if they are enemies of Maretania, the Council will be more than happy to help them on their way to the grave. A shot here, a fall there. Even the odd drowning accident with strange crushed windpipes here and there. Who did it? Who knows."
 MTA_information_warfare:0 "War of Information"
 MTA_information_warfare_desc:0 "Disinformation. In Stalliongrad, they call it a maskirovka. In Griffonia, they call it a Fehtellung. There is a good word for it 'Misdirection'. The information put out need not be false...it just needs to have a few holes here and there for the adversaries to pick up on and make mistakes from there."
 MTA_contingency_plan:0 "Contingency Planning"
 MTA_contingency_plan_desc:0 "We have come far, but there is one lingering question. What do we do if another Storm King rises? It was bad enough the one time it happened, but what now, when we are finally opening up and discovering that there are many, many more artifacts in the world that could be a danger in the wrong hooves? The day may never come, but we must be prepared. We cannot let this be up to fate."
 
 MTA_containment_path:0 "Security and Containment"
 MTA_containment_path_desc:0 "For several decades, we have been protecting and securing artifacts across the world. Even if it has cost lives, and we have been forced into hard choices, we must stand firm on our principles, and continue on this path, and some day, maybe, we will get useful results that we can better the world with. Hopefully."
 
 MTA_between_two_giants:0 "Between The Giants"
 MTA_between_two_giants_desc:0 "While the CSI Security Teams are highly skilled at their job to keep out infiltrators, and to defend against small bands of roaming raiders, the time may soon come where they are needed to intervene in conflicts outside our borders, for the preservation of our artifacts. If a great threat emerges, our highly skilled teams can aid those who have accepted our assistance."
 
 MTA_war_plan_ivory_tower:0 "War Plan: Ivory Tower"
 MTA_war_plan_ivory_tower_desc:0 "The Riseia Region has a number of states, each arrayed against us in different ways. While we may not be particularly pleased about having to turn to brute force, it is necessary for the good of the world. We protect the world. And to do that, we need to be able to work in peace."
 
 MTA_mission_team_heavy_equipment:0 "Field Operative Organization Reforms"
 MTA_mission_team_heavy_equipment_desc:0 "Preliminary research has concluded that our field operatives require increased access to better equipment. Prototypes have been drawn up in the design labs, and the appropriate investment is now required in order to get these to our teams."
 
 MTA_form_new_mission_teams:0 "Operative Rank Expansion Program"
 MTA_form_new_mission_teams_desc:0 "The CSI teams are competent and elite, yes, but they are few in number and they cannot be everywhere at one. At the end of the day, we can only do so much against those who act globally. To remedy this, an expansion is to be ordered. There are enough promising candidates after all."
 
 MTA_replicate_artifacts:0 "Replicate Minor Artifacts"
 MTA_replicate_artifacts_desc:0 "While some artifacts are valuable for us to use in the work that we do, they are few in number and rare. But there is a technique that we might be able to use to replicate some lesser artifacts often used. Through the power of magic and technology, another protection for the world."
 
 MTA_magical_creatures:0 "Fantastic Beasts and How to Use Them"
 MTA_magical_creatures_desc:0 "Artifacts can also be beasts and living creatures. And where it is possible to safely contain them and put them to work, it is not only good practice, but it is also necessary to stretch our limited resources so that they may be better used elsewhere."
 
 MTA_worldwide_recruitment:0 "Worldwide Recruitment"
 MTA_worldwide_recruitment_desc:0 "Around the world, we have agents. They just don't know it yet. There are so many potential agents who could be persuaded to work for us with the right dreams and ideals of helping to prevent the ends of the world. And get well-paid in the process. Where ideals don't work, money works wonders." 
 
 MTA_superpony_capabilities:0 "Project: X-Horse"
 MTA_superpony_capabilities_desc:0 "Magic is many things, but it is above all polyvalent. It can be imbued in anything and be used to quickstart mutations and developments. And indeed, if targeted in the correct way, it can be directed to shape the equine body in the right way to create something even bigger. ´Maybe even something to far surpass the natural abilities of any creature known."
 
 MTA_worldwide_operations:0 "Eyes and Ears Everywhere"
 MTA_worldwide_operations_desc:0 "The Council has decreed it. There is no such things as a 'local' threat. The prevalence of new, destructive weapons and the instability in the world could provoke a war that could mean the total scouiring of a nation, if not continent. Some are sceptical, but one can never be too sure. The Grover Example stands out in the history as what happens when we don't react."
 
 MTA_advisor_network:0 "Maretanian Magic Advisor Network"
 MTA_advisor_network_desc:0 "Though the CSI is our primary craft and trade, the Magocracy of Maretania is also known in and off itself as being a center of magical knowledge around the world. And though Dr. Veritas in the River Republic might be a scholar in Magical Studies, he also occasionally moonlights in recruiting prospective students for the CSI. Who knew?"
 
 MTA_modern_testimony_analysis:0 "Modern Testimony Analysis Methods"
 MTA_modern_testimony_analysis_desc:0 "Much has changed since the CSI was founded. Advancements in technology is just one of the many things that have changed. And one of the biggest are investigations. No more can the agents rely on the rambles of the old zebra in the corner, but must work within an evidence-based frame. Expeditions are expensive after all."
 
 MTA_task_oriented_planning:0 "Task-Oriented Mission Planning"
 MTA_task_oriented_planning_desc:0 "Not every artifact is the same. Some are technological, but unrealistic in nature. Others are magical aspects out of control. Yet others have been the result of experiments gone wrong. And there is no one-size-fits-all playbook. Every mission is unique, and every artifact is different. Every mission needs their unique planning to work."
 
 MTA_ancient_artifacts:0 "Look Far and Wide"
 MTA_ancient_artifacts_desc:0 "There are artifacts where one least expect it. In the dusty books, and in the ancient manuscript, myth and fiction blends with truth and reality and creates a mix of both. Some might be dead ends, but the Council demands that all artifacts that may pose a threat to the world be securely contained. The people in Analysis have not been very pleased at the news of poring over the books."
 
 MTA_manuals_on_cultural_quirks:0 "Manuals on Dealing with Cultural Quirks"
 MTA_manuals_on_cultural_quirks_desc:0 "No two peoples around the world are the same. In one, burping after a meal might be considered good luck, might as in others it could be considered a grave insult. But over the years, we have gathered enough information to publish a veritable book on cultures and their quirks. It may even end up being a neat little side business for us."
 
 MTA_free_artifact_roll_1:0 "In the Northern Everfrost"
 MTA_free_artifact_roll_1_desc:0 "Beneath the permafrost and tundra of the Everfrost lies artifacts lost to time. Those that stem back to the time of the Wendigos, of unbelievable power, and of date immemorial. And we must lay our hooves on them before they are used again, perhaps to a very chilling effect."
 
 MTA_free_artifact_roll_2:0 "In the Southern Deserts"
 MTA_free_artifact_roll_2_desc:0 "The Southern Sands hide many secrets otherwise lost to time and sentient memory. Artifacts with immense power that have not seen the scorching sun for years and years on end. Preferably, we will be the first ones to dig them out of the sand before anyone else does...and uses it to our detriment. A broken veil is never fun to deal with."
 
 MTA_free_artifact_roll_3:0 "In the Western Oceans"
 MTA_free_artifact_roll_3_desc:0 "Deep below the sea, in the depths of the World Ocean lie artifacts lost to time... or they were lost to time before the Council got a hold of documents showing where they were. While there is not a chance that another power might haul in the artifacts under the sea, the instability of some of them might cause a catastrophe in and of themselves." 
 
 MTA_arab_1:0 "Consulate of Sheikh Trotlerand"
 MTA_arab_1_desc:0 "Diplomacy is and remains the primary tool through which we can get our way. A consulate, just a small mission somewhere will go a long way to make sure that we have some eyes and ears on the ground. Surely, nothing could go wrong."
 
 MTA_arab_2:0 "Marekalla-Trotgiers Cruises"
 MTA_arab_2_desc:0 "Our coast is wide open, and the Council have deemed it prudent to increase naval arms under the pretense of a cruise company. Of course, this will mostly exist for the purpose of allowing clandestine naval deployment."
 
 MTA_arab_3:0 "Arabian Military Mission"
 MTA_arab_3_desc:0 "As a state, the Magocracy still has diplomatic ties to maintain. To further the potential military intelligence gained, we will embed some of our best tacticians and logistical minds on the next major deployment."
 
 MTA_arab_4:0 "CSI Trotgiers Division"
 MTA_arab_4_desc:0 "Further success warrants an increase in the number of our CSI teams, and a new division is to be formed after recent endeavours. Our teams are elite, and not to be squandered or deployed recklessly."
 
 MTA_kark_1:0 "Expansion of the Karkadi Embassy"
 MTA_kark_1_desc:0 "Our innermost secrets will remain secrets, but the Magocracy still has a state around it. The Obsidian Council have decreed that further diplomatic relations with our southern neighbours to be prudent."
 
 MTA_kark_2:0 "The Southern Railroad"
 MTA_kark_2_desc:0 "Joint building works have nominally been agreed, and a mixed company of railway engineers with aid from our soutern neighbours has been designated to form and set out to facilitate better linking of our rail network."
 
 MTA_kark_3:0 "Ardakmane Arms Enterprises"
 MTA_kark_3_desc:0 "Through our increasing good ties, further agreements on the manufacture of arms as a limited company have been drafted. Of course, we will give no secrets away and our magical work will remain ours."
 
 MTA_kark_4:0 "CSI Ardakmane Division"
 MTA_kark_4_desc:0 "Progress is sufficient that the Council has greenlit the formation of a new CSI Division. As with all our teams, their skills and expertise should not be wasted!"

 ### EVENTS ###
 
 maretania.0.t:0 "The Ruins of Something Great"
 maretania.0.d:0 "The ruins were strewn around the different buildings, large pieces of debris littering the streets. Several pillars of smoke, black, from the burning of furniture and varying wooden flotsam and jetsam lying around as opposed to the previous heartbeat of steam and power. And yet, there was still life in the streets. Two horses, one a unicorn, one not walked through the streets, each wearing a white tunic, with a gold pin at the right shoulder.\n\n"You really think that this the end of the CSI? That the Storm King did so much damage, Dr. Mushriq?"\n\nThe unicorn trudged along, before stopping at a particularly large building, holes in it still visible, even if it had been repaired intermittedly with wood and nails. "Look at it. Two years, but still nothing. What is this meant to be, Dr. Altarus?"\n\nDr. Altarus looked at the building, before taking the few steps over to it and putting a hoof on the wall, feeling the masonry, "The start of something new. We may be bloodied, but we are unbowed. We still have the caves, right?"\n\n"We do. And the agents are still out there."\n\n"See, there is plenty of opportunity left." Dr. Altarus turned around and then looked up at the building again, bits of debris hanging on by a few threads. "We do still have to do something about this building though. And soon.""
 maretania.0.a:0 "Could we get some masons over here?"
 
 maretania.1.t:0 "Cracking Open the Cave"
 maretania.1.d:0 "Tools were spread all over the floor, machines, powered by steam and magic alike standing around the doors. Decorated with ornate inscriptions, and crystals, one could easily mistake such a door for belonging in the most holy of sanctums. And yet, it was a door out of the way, a long way from everything.\n\nPerfect for hiding the artifacts that the world has forgotten then.\n\nDr. Altarus looked over the whole spectacle, of zebras and horses milling about below, carefully noting the equipment not damaging the door.\n\n"A long time left?" Dr. Mushriq asked as he climbed the stairs to the platform, taking care to not trip over the tunic or the tall steps on the way up\n\nDr. Altarus looked back at Dr. Mushriq, briefly taking his look off the cave, "Not quite long. We are finally cracking the spells our colleagues put on the door when they sealed themselves in. Hopefully, everything is still there."\n\n"They sealed themselves in. And no one's been in there ever since. Least of all the looters." Dr. Mushriq answered, pointing to the door, still hermetically shut and locked.\n\n"I know, maybe it's just nerves. We still have a ways to go before we are back in business, even with Al Rabina getting everything under control finally." he said, before turning back to look down at the milieu below.\n\nDr. Mushriq joined Dr. Altarus at the platform, leaning on the railing. "What then? We have our artifacts, but the world is changing around us, and I don't think they are that polite to let us operate unrestricted and without their knowledge. At best it's a protest, at worst, the masquerade is broken, and our agents are shot."\n\n"We are many things, Dr. Mushriq, but we are not stuck in the past. We will find new ways around it. Even if we have to find completely new ways."\n\nAs those words fell, a mighty creak was heard from the doors, the crystals glowing a bright blue, before the doors slowly opened. Bit by bit, ever so slowly, the massive double doors moved aside to reveal the thing that so many had died and lied to protect. Rows upon rows of crates, boxes and bells. All containing an artifact of power. All a part of the CSI. All something to be contained and protected, lest the security of the world itself would come at risk."
 maretania.1.a:0 "Now for the real work."
 
 maretania.2.t:0 "The Committee for Analysis"
 maretania.2.d:0 "Many buildings had been left desolate once the Storm came. Many more were destroyed. And yet, life still goes on. Horses, mages and non-mages. CSI Agents and non-agents had begun to return to the cities, busy working on restoring the buildings. And in one, non-descript room in the middle of Mareib, a small circle of mages were gathered.\n\n"So what was it that you called us here for Dr. Miftah?" a unicorn asked, his tagelmust largely dusted up from the work going on outside.\n\n"It's very simple, Dr. Huquq", Dr. Miftah answered, putting a heavy tome on the table, kicking up dust "New ideas have spread, and they might be of interest."\n\nDr. Huquq looked over at the tome, reading on the title. 'The Governance of Severnaya'. She looked to Dr. Miftah, who merely nodded. "Socialism? That strange thing from Equus?"\n\nDr. Miftah opened the tome, browsing through the various "The same. The Committee has always been for analysis to keep the worst parts of the CSI in check. This is the answer. Don't forget all those outside the CSI we have to take care of."\n\nDr. Huquq sighed, noting down a few sentences on a piece of paper. "I'll look into it, but remember that for now, we are not going to make a move. For now, we maintain our job. Analyzing the reports that come in from around the Council and taking action whenever someone does something contrary to our goals. Secure, Contain and Protect." With those words, she rose, catching Dr. Miftah by surprise.\n\n"But doesn't this prove promising? A way to provide for everyone and make sure that we can continue to nudge the Council in the right direction?" he asked, just as she prepared to trot out the door.\n\nShe sighed and looked back. "I'll read the book, and think about it. Just don't go too loudly about it," she said, levitating over the book, hiding it under her clothing."
 maretania.2.a:0 "Maybe one day, it will come to pass"
 
 maretania.3.t:0 "The Council of Outreach"
 maretania.3.d:0 "There were many things that the Magocracy in general were good, indeed, very good at, but interacting with other nations was not really their forte. This fell to the Council of Outreach. \n\n"What is all this for, Director Alqatat? We have our hooves full as it is with trying to reestablish the barest lines of communication with our agents." One of the agents in the room exclaimed almost immediately after they were sitting at the table, a bottle of bitter on the table.\n\nThe Director repressed the instinct to fill up a glass and take something strong while explaining. "It's very simple Agent Duyujayn. We are between two powers who are taking advantage of the situation. We must be ready to steer the Council in the direction beneficial to us." He said, while fiddling with a slide projector, a small stack of slides already sitting in a box beside it.\n\nThe agent nodded along, before levitating the bottle over and pouring himself a glass. "What about the Council? Can't imagine they'll be pleased about us taking control."\n\n"Let me take care of them. The ruleset of the Magocracy is more convoluted than the tunnels in the Caves. We can find a way to take control if the time comes." Director Alqatat mused, finally getting the projector to work, showing a map of the region around the Arabian Sea. "This is what we're looking at. If we can get enough support from both nations, we can be in the driver's seat. Everyone. This is an unparalleled opportunity"\n\nAgent Duyujayn at the map, before taking stock of the situation, "You are sure that this won't backfire on us?"\n\nThe Director looked up at the map, and then to the Agent. "Of course not.""
 maretania.3.a:0 "Surely not."
 
 maretania.4.t:0 "A Letter from Command"
 maretania.4.d:0 "There was a rap on the door to Dr. Mushriq' office. A hoof. The door swung open, letting a courier walk in with a letter in his mouth. He put it down on the table, letting him look over the envelope. "Letter from the Obsidian Council. They are sending a request down the pipeline."\n\nDr. Mushriq lifted the envelope in his magic, opening it and discarding the envelope on the floor, leaving the courier to pick it up before leaving the room.\n\nTo all senior personnel - The Calm after the Storm has proven to be more damaging to the mission of the Obsidian Council than at first thought. Several artifacts have been rumoured to be circulating around the world with the fate of the same in the balance.\n\nTherefore, by unanimous consent amidst the Council of Thirteen it has been enacted that the CSI is to acquire and contain a set number of artifacts based on the outside reports of newspapers based in several major newspapers each yearly quarter. Failure will not be tolerated. For the good of the World and for the good of the Universe, we must secure and contain the artifacts still at large, lest we fail in our most sacred duty to protect the world from the dangers of haywire artifacts.\n\n - CSI Command\n\nDr. Mushriq looked at the letter, thought a bit about its content, then promptly rested his cup of coffee on it, deliberately spilling on the letter."
 maretania.4.a:0 "What good are orders from Command anyways?"
 
 maretania.5.t:0 "Project: X-Horse" 
 maretania.5.d:0 "Dear Dr. Altarus\n\nProject X-Horse as we've discussed in our last meeting has been implemented in testing. Through the attempted replication of various artifacts and use of the same such as the Fortunate Ring and the Corn Mantle it has been found to be possible to enhance the capabilities of individual agents beyond the normal limits. As I discussed in our last letter, the budgets have overrun for the experimental phase, let alone to create it a full scale. In order to infuse the powers of the minor artifacts, a long and dangerous process needs to be undertaken. In one accident, a slight [Expletive deleted]-up, led to the loss of several promising talents.\n\nAlthough I personally think the X-Horse idea shows potential, we are losing agents and mages by the loads every time somecreature undergoes the proces.\n\nI will be back in Mareib in five days from the date of this letter to discuss this. Until then, take it east\n\n - Dr. Miftah"

The ancient, mysterious items brought to custody in Maretania leave many itching for experimentation, perhaps even activation of the artifacts at their hooves - after all, to contain and protect the artifacts necessitates collecting information on exactly how they need to be contained. There is always a risk involved when dealing with such magical power, however.\n\nFor you, there are several options to take.\n\nYou may order a disposable employee to try to activate the artifact. If the Council has any instructions on how the artifact is used, they will be put to effect, otherwise, the employee will be ordered to carefully attempt one of several standard artifact activation procedures. With how unpredictable the effects may be, however, this is a risky approach.\n\nPerhaps, before resorting to that, you may order careful experimentation on the artifact first. Using state of the art technology and procedures such as strength tests or exposure to certain chemicals, we can predict what the artifact might do once activated, and so more easily guess whether it should be touched or sealed away forever.\n\nFinally, you may order the artifact to be secured, sealed away forever in one of the Cave's vaults, to ensure that it will never cause harm to anyone nor see the light of day."

Dr. Mushriq mused, pointing to the set. "You know what happened with some of the other artifacts we had to seal away after they blew up in our faces."\n\nDr. Altarus merely cocked his head and grabbed one of the data reports from a nearby table, "We are not here to destroy or file away everything. Sometimes, things turn out for the better for us. Just because we are here to protect the world doesn't mean we can't use the same things every now and then."\n\nA few seconds passed as Dr. Mushriq retreated into the background. "I still disagree with you. This is not something that should be used. We don't even know what it is other than a strange chemistry set."\n\n"And that is why you are not the one in charge of testing." Dr. Altarus mused. "Alright everyone. Power up the machines and let us get to it."\n\n"For the record, Dr. Altarus, I think that trying to exploiting all these artifacts for naked gain for the Council is quite a bit against our code.

Dr. Altarus worried, pointing to the basket being taken out of the crate.\n\nDr. Miftah dodged the implications, levitating a few apples and a pie into the basket "Don't worry. We have some volunteers who are willng to take one for the team and eat the first few nuggets out of the basket," she said as she covered the basket with a piece of cloth. "But that's all for later.

Unlike many of the other testing chambers, this one was quite literally illuminated by a thin beam of natural sunlight that was directed down into the room and focused precisely upon the centre of a plinth. A research assistant broke the still calm in the room, carrying in a small pot covered rather crudely with a cardboard box lid.\nThe assistant placed the box upon the dias in the middle of the room and scurried away, noticeably avoiding making eye contact with the covered container as they removed the covering. After they had left and sealed the entry door with a rather resouding 'clunk', a few minutes passed before a viewing slit opened in the wall opposite. There, the assistant was reclined with a set of blank observations and a fresh set of notes, all ready to document this peculiar flower."

Sure, it appeared harmless, but an artifact which could summon effectively infinite matter from thin air could have some... unforseen effects if meddled with too much.\n\nThe small group of scientists working with their machines first shone several flavors of light upon the artifact, even the most exotic ones, X-Rays and further. No effect. It floated about with no effect.\n\nA unicorn under the organization's payroll was brought in to blast it with concentrated magic, a crystal-powered magic rifle right after, a burst of flame, a spray of water... All had no effect, it was almost like all of the elements simply passed through thin air.\n\nThe scientists watching and collecting the data were thus left puzzled - and it took almost a minute for one of them to finally formulate any sort of hypothesis:\n\n"Does it even exist in our plane of existence?

That seems to be 1166's limitation - it cannot affect you unless you interact with its game mechanics. Thankfully. There is a *lot* of magical energy contained in this single box, and not of the good kind."\n\n"Your vitals seem to be in right condition.

 marcsi.2.d11:0 "Code name "Ponymonium" has kept producing headaches for our researchers, as it keeps defying our attempts to comprehend its nature. While neither defiant, nor violent, it has rather been... petulant, and refused to comply unless its demands are met. As we have no way of knowing what it would cost to provoke this entity, a soft hoof has been employed, which has been expensive.\n\nAs it turns out, the entity thrives on euphoria and positive emotional expressions, and the best way to indulge this has been through arranging celebrations. Grandmaster Taous has advised against this approach, fearing that indulging it will empower it beyond our already limited control over it, but as we are lacking any serious alternatives, our hoof is forced.\n\nThe end result has largely been an embarrassment for the CSI, as the facility housing it has turned into a mad carneval of indulgence where order has broken down and partying is supreme. Yet, amazingly, there are no reported casualties, not even injuries beyond various symptoms of overconsumption. \n\nThe entity's reality warping powers are not limited to physical changes, but it also seems eminently capable of pulling others along with it not through hypnosis or mental control, but rather through empowering people's desires for relaxation and recreation. it also possesses a curious form of sixth sense which let it escape various forms of attempts to stop it and which has necessitated the intervention of Grandmaster Taous himself."

Researchers expressed confusion and claimed that Agent Enigma did not perform the test, and instructed him to do as instructed. Agent Enigma then vocally read the book. No unusual magical signatures detected in the containment cell.\n\nTest 4: Agent Enigma instructed to read the book out loud.\nResult: Agent Enigma insisted that the artifact must be affecting the observers, as he had already performed this test twice and they seemed to not remember it. One of the researchers insisted that Agent Enigma perform this test once more, but this time one of the researchers, Councillor River Styx, would place soundproof headphones on to see if any differences occurred. Agent Enigma seemed somewhat frustrated, but agreed to try again. Agent Enigma then vocally read the book, but cut out some parts as to shorten the amount of time he'd spend talking. Councillor Styx reported that the other two researchers both said "That's not right" before standing from their chairs and making their way to the containment cell, where they proceeded to beat and berate Agent Enigma for "ruining the story" until he apologized for his actions. The researchers who participated in the beating claimed to not have any memory of doing so."

Still standing there, unassuming. Pulling off the cloth, on the other hoof, revealed a wealth of food. Dozens of apples and pies in the basket, all looking freshly plucked or baked. He took out one of the apples and took a bite. Succulent and the slight tinge of acid. Just as an apple should be.\n\nAnother apple. And then a pie. Soon, the apple cores and empty trays piled up.

She had briefly expected to find the assistant asleep or bored to tears, but to her surprise they were quite awake. Extremely so, it seemed, as the assistant was acting in a manner somewhat akin to what she'd seen a fellow intellectual like during a very 'inspired' moment - but this particular burst of energy seemed to be heavily sustained. Very quietly, Miftah just..watched the unicorn assistant, who was surrounded in a pile of papers.\n\n"I have to keep writing, more research, must keep noting it down" The assistant grunted, setting sheets of papers flying as he resumed scribbling on the wall of the observation room.\nFrom an initial glance, it looked like he'd been writing all manner of complex theories and diagrams upon every surface he could. Carefully sliding the viewing slit closed, Miftah waited for the assistant to start to run out of steam, and then addressed him softly as he seemed to slow.\n\n"Take a few minutes to rest, do you recall what happened last, what you've been thinking about?"\n\nThe stallion blinked, now staring directly at Miftah. She could almost see the fire leaving his eyes, a gradual confusion setting in.\n\n"No, Doctor, I don't. One minute I was curious and thinking about what might happen with the experiment, the next I remember you talking to me. Is it time to go now?"\n\n Miftah nodded, glancing at some of the sheets of paper. Some of the things written on the papers were extremely advanced arcane theories and diagrams; far beyond the assessed capacity of the assistant."\n\n "Come with me, we need to do some evaluation of your experience." Ushering him out of the room, Miftah made a note to mark all of the scattered papers as restricted material, as well as the writings on the wall. Her mind was abuzz with questions and thoughts - this vast increase in intensity of feelings in the testing scenario had matched with their initial findings. Perhaps this could be replicated to greater effect."

Having initially joined the chase, the Doctor and his assistants eventually gave up on the ordeal and returned back to the field test site. Panicking and snoozing within the chambers for several hours, the Doctor finally reared his head when he heard a lone figure enter the test room.\n\n"Sorry, it's not the test subject, it's just me..."

Some of the artifacts the good doctors bring us seem to be really obsessed with the past."\n\n"If so..." the agent spoke again, narrowing his eyes, concocting an idea in his mind.

The janitor was dizzy from exhaustion and frozen in fear, however.\n\n"W-what is that thing?!"\n\nThe two agents saw nothing at the direction his hoof pointed, however.

Councillor Miftah had to intervene and console the entity, assuring it that everycreature enjoyed the celebration quite a lot, but that they also had work to do. \n\nThus consoled, the entity recovered and asked if it might return in the future for more celebrations of this kind. With containment impossible and most venues of research duds, the decision was made to let the entity leave, though admittedly there was little who could have been done to stop it. \n\nLeaving the researchers with personalized baked goods as thanks for the "fun" and grandmaster Taous with a short-sleeved shirt with the words "World's Biggest Grumpypants" imprinted on the sides, the entity departed for its homeland. It has, however, promised to return annually if possible for precisely one day of fun.

Records show that it having displayed, at the time of the artifact being first discovered, the carvings showed ponies gathering around a single figure theorized to be the leader.\n\nAddendum 1a) After permission granted from the Council, a specialist in Maregyptian ornamental weapon, carved, with modern tools a small lock of hair onto one of the ponies gathered. While most scratches disappear within a day, this edit was notable for its consistency. Three days later, the Maregyptian Government -REDACTED-. It is not known if this is connected to the experiment. Nevertheless, further experimentation was suspended and the dagger restored to its original state."
 
 GetMTAArtifactName_9_tt:0 ""The Assassin""
 GetMTAArtifactDesc_9_tt:0 ""The Assassin" is a box containing a table-top roleplaying game of unknown origins captured and retrieved from an unnamed island far from the westernmost point of Equus, which has been given the code name "Citadel Island" due to the structures and dungeons of unknown age, origin or purpose within it. While the game is able to be played by multiple individuals, experiments with the game and its mechanics have given us reports that solo play is most advised. It is to be contained in a reinforced steel drawer within floor 4 of the Cave with limited access to all personnel.\n\nWhile it nominally appears to be a game set in a fantasy setting, "The Assassin" alters the reality of those playing, as test groups have reported strange phenomena such as a drain on their health, a shift in the night sky overhead over time, and sightings of an unknown four-legged creature with a pure black exterior, displaying a form of movement similar to arachnids and stalking the players. -REDACTED-, a rogue member of one test group, eventually exhibited effects of mania, nightmares, and muteness aside for the words "Watch the sky"."

 GetMTAArtifactName_12_tt:0 ""The Very Hungry Parasprite""
 GetMTAArtifactDesc_12_tt:0 ""The Very Hungry Parasprite" is a small foal's storybook. Unusual effects manifest whenever the story is read orally. All sapient beings within earshot of the one reading the story enter a trance-like state wherin they cease all activity to focus intently on the speaker. This effect persists as long as the speaker is reading the story, and can even be artificially extended past the story's end should the speaker flip back to the first page and start over. Upon cessation of reading, all of the listening individuals resume their activities with no apparent memory of the trance they were held in, nor the story's contents.\n\nSecondary effects of the artifact begin if an individual reading the story makes a sufficiently large error (defined as skipping a word, substituting one word for another, or altering parts of the story). Listening individuals will mutter phrases such as "That's not how it goes" or "That's not how I remember it" and then proceed to attack the reader of the story with whatever blunt object they can get their appendages on. Sharp weapons and firearms are usually discarded in favor of bludgeoning tools, and if none are available then they will use their own arms or legs. Affected individuals will attack the speaker until they make a sufficiently heartfelt apology for "ruining the story.""

 # TO ADD NEW ARTIFACTS:
 # - Choose an id which is not already taken by an artifact. Artys use state ids to be found, localized, and act.
 # - Add scripted loc entries in EAW_MTA_scripted_localization, and localize them 
 # - Modify events marcsi.2 and marcsi.3 to add desc entries for experimenting and testing the artifact, and localize them
 # - Add threat level entry in EAW_MTA_scripted_localization
 # - Add effects for activation in EAW_MTA_effects, *and add an opposite deactivation effect if needed* (same file)
 # - Add an event for receiving the arty by adding the id of the artifact to the ROOT.MTA_owned_artifacts array (see marcsi.1000 test event on how it works), or add it to the country file if you want MTA to start with the arty
 # -- If you want your artifact to be findable via the Artifact Acquisition loot roll mechanic, then you need to add a separate event reply for the hidden event marcsi.4 with your 
 # - Finally, add an icon for the arty with a new entry for GetMTAArtifactIcon, in EAW_MTA_scripted_localization
 
 # Yes, GetMTAArtifactName is defined twice in scripted loc file, one is for custom GUI and the other is for decision naming, they use different scopes for that reason

 MTA_Tireless_Tracker:0 "Tireless Tracker"
 MTA_Tireless_Tracker_desc:0 "§YBiography§!:Though he was born in Equestria, Tireless Tracker had spent the majority of his life in and around the forests of Greifwald. A treasure hunter by heart, he sought to delve into areas not often explored by others; most of Equestria had its fair share of adventurers, after all. Though Greifwald had no mystical forests like the Everfree, Tireless became attached to the area for the fundamental beauty of the otherwise mundane woodlands.\n\nAfter many years of collecting various knick-knacks and moderately valuable treasures, he stumbled upon a few strange artifacts that perplexed him and everyone he showed them to, something that drew the attention of a Retrieval Team that happened to be in the area. After a brief conversation, a senior agent concluded that Tireless could be of use to The Council. The agent contacted their superiors, and then Tireless was inducted into the ranks of their organization.\n\nDespite being an Earth Pony, Tireless Tracker showed exemplary talent when it came to finding obscure artifacts. This talent extended to other areas as well, as showcased during a crucial Class-3 Retrieval Mission. The team that Tireless was accompanying were ambushed and left lost and injured within hostile territory. They were forced to hole up in an abandoned house while they waited for an opportunity to escape. It was then that Tireless pointed out and corrected several flaws in their defense plans that, at the time, seemed counterintuitive to the agents he was with. Due to his actions, the entire team was able to return to headquarters safely with the artifact secured.\n\nThat mission brought him under the attention of the Obsidian Council, who decided that his skills might be better utilized in a leadership position over their task forces. Since then, Tireless Tracker has led several successful operations with minimal casualties.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Neither"

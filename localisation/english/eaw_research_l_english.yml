 basic_encryption_lar:1 "Mechanical Rotor Cyphers"
 basic_encryption_lar_desc:0 "The introduction of electro-mechanical integral computers has rendered most traditional cyphers based on lingual encryptions vulnerable. However, we can use the same computers and adapt them as cyphering tools for our existing polyalphabetic cyphers. With multiple rotors, these devices scramble the letters of messages that can only be understood with a key. The cypher machines aren't foolproof, but their encoding is solid enough to stop most attackers."
 improved_encryption_lar:1 "Applied Number Theory"
 improved_encryption_lar_desc:0 "All of our codes are structured, and their strength lies in how obscure the structures are. The more cycles of the cypher arrangements we have, the denser our encoding is to cryptanalysts. These permutations can be increased exponentially with a straightforward equation, though we've struggled with integrating factorials of a high order. With computer assistance, our encoders can easily use higher-order factorials to produce stronger cyphers."
 advanced_encryption_lar:1 "Pulse-Code Modulation"
 advanced_encryption_lar_desc:0 "The spread of digital computers has offered an exciting option for our encoders. We can digitally represent samples of analogue radio signals via pulse-code modulation (PCM) and store them in binary. This method adds a new layer of encryption by producing seemingly random sounds that our computers can transcribe and translate. This breakthrough is sure to make our military communications even more secure."
 basic_decryption_lar:1 "Frequency Analysis"
 basic_decryption_lar_desc:0 "Intelligence gathering is increasingly becoming a mathematical problem, as radios and telegrams are encoded in increasingly hidden systems. Machine-assisted decryption is now a possibility with the introduction of cyclometers. With these devices, mathematicians use frequency analysis to 'count' the letters in cyphertexts and aid in exploiting flawed cyphers."
 improved_decryption_lar:1 "Side-Channel Attacks"
 improved_decryption_lar_desc:0 "Traditionally, decrypting hidden messages involves a concentrated effort in decode the messages themselves. However, we've found that we can gain information from the implementation of computer systems used in cypher machines. We can exploit these additional sources of data to glean the nature of the cyphers. These 'side-channel' attacks require considerable technical knowledge, but decyphering enemy intelligence is crucial to our war efforts."
 advanced_decryption_lar:1 "Automated Deduction Analysis"
 advanced_decryption_lar_desc:0 "As enemy cyphers become more sophisticated, immediate analysis of codes becomes far more challenging. We can detect specific cypher routines with parallelised automated theorem proving run through high clock speed computers. From there, the deductions made by running logic engines offer various clues and traces of the otherwise impenetrable cypher structures."

 semi_modern_fire_control_system:0 "Dual Ballistic Fire Control System"
 semi_modern_fire_control_system_desc:0 "As dual-purpose armaments become commonplace, we've found that the surface and anti-airborne fire control systems can lead to confusion for our secondary batteries. To avoid this, we can use a single fire control system to simultaneously produce gun orders for two different gun types against the same target. This dual ballistic system prevents mixed signals from being sent to our gun crews and improves the fire control capabilities of our ships mounted with this system."
 modern_fire_control_system:0 "Hybrid Fire Control System"
 modern_fire_control_system_desc:0 "The best of both worlds, we can use a hybrid electronic and electro-mechanical system instead of either one. It is both more resistant due to its mechanical redundancies but can also utilise electrical high-precision resolvers instead of the slower mechanical ones, multiplied with precision linear potentiometers. Large and spacious, this new system is probably the best that we can achieve with analogue fire control systems."
 modern_fire_control_system_2:0 "Remote Magical Fire Control System"
 modern_fire_control_system_2_desc:0 "A novel idea has given way to introducing remote magical fire control, where the gun crew and the fire director share command of the guns. Gunnery officers in the fire director can direct and fire the ship's weapon systems by relying on a magical link. Oncoming fire cannot sever the connection between the gun platform and the director, allowing the system to resist for longer before control is lost."

 ## Electronics and Other Such

 land_fort_tech_future:0 "Semi-Modern Land Forts"
 land_fort_tech_future_desc:0 "Although not exactly innovative, the integration of many smaller ideas in fort design such as grenade traps and hostile architecture will make it much more challenging for infantry to approach and clear out fortified structures. Combining this with other defensive tools like tank traps, barbed wire and minefields will create a real challenge for any approaching foe."
 coastal_fort_tech_future:0 "Semi-Modern Coastal Fortifications"
 coastal_fort_tech_future_desc:0 "Traditional bunkers and machine guns no longer have the firepower required to prevent a naval invasion. Not only will there be enemy ships supporting landing craft which must be suppressed, but the landing craft themselves have become capable of stopping rifle calibre rounds. Coastal batteries integrated into our naval defences are the only realistic solution for this problem and supporting artillery hidden inland will assist in finishing off those who make it ashore."
 land_fort_tech_future_2:0 "Modern Land Forts"
 land_fort_tech_future_2_desc:0 "The greatest threat to modern fortifications in the modern era is armoured fire support and hostile air power which can simply annihilate most defences before the infantry need to approach it. We must focus on incorporating anti-air and anti-tank equipment in our defensive structures in order to maintain a defensive edge. Additional technological developments like early warning RADAR systems and laser rangefinders will also be of use."
 coastal_fort_tech_future_2:0 "Modern Coastal Fortifications"
 coastal_fort_tech_future_2_desc:0 "Building on our previous firepower solutions for naval defence, the gradual introduction of naval RADAR systems and possibly even anti-ship missiles appears to be the logical evolution of coastal defence. In addition, specialised naval mines designed to function best at coastal depths have been added to our defensive arsenal and promise a dramatic increment in anti-ship capabilities."

 semi_modern_radio:0 "Advanced Radiotelegraphy"
 semi_modern_radio_desc:0 "Wireless telegraphy isn't a new technology, but it is still in mass use due to its reliability in long-distance person-to-person communication. A new iteration of this system, radioteletype, uses frequency-shift keying as a modulation, allowing users to type out more complex messages and send them through the radiowaves. It is primarily catered for naval vessels, but any one of the military branches can make great use of this advancement."
 modern_radio:0 "Transistor Radios"
 modern_radio_desc:0 "The advent of the transistor presents an incredible leap forward for all electronic equipment, including radios. Far more efficient at amplifying than a bulky vacuum tube, we can reduce the size and weight of new portable radio transceivers and weight to the point that a soldier can carry one in a pocket. Though still not as powerful as larger radio sets, there is no denying the convenience and utility of a hoof-held transceiver."

 future_radar_5:0 "Over-the-Horizon RADAR"
 future_radar_5_desc:0 "The frequency of radio waves used by most RADARs are microwaves that travel in straight lines. The curvature of the earth reduces this effective range to the visible horizon. However, we've found that a powerful shortwave signal refracts off the ionosphere, allowing it to reach a location well beyond the horizon and back. This new 'skywave' RADAR has excellent long-range detection and will make our skies safer."

 sp_rockets_dual_chamber_rocket_engine_3: "Quadruple Chamber Rocket Engines & Crystalline Catalysts"
 sp_rockets_dual_chamber_rocket_engine_3_desc: "Whilst engines with two combustion chambers have served us well, the need to carry payloads of greater mass has necessitated the creation of more powerful engines. Initially an upscaled dual chamber model was considered, but at that size the stability and fuel throughput needs of the engine became problematic. The solution was almost painfully simple: Use smaller combustion chambers and add more of them, thus creating a quadruple chamber rocket engine."
 sp_rockets_dual_chamber_rocket_engine_4: "Gimbals & Refined Crystalline Catalysts"
 sp_rockets_dual_chamber_rocket_engine_4_desc: "Gimbals are truly a marvel of engineering, allowing for thrust vectoring by adjusting the angle of the exhaust nozzle on a given engine. Whilst this technology's applications are also being explored with aircraft, it is arguably more valuable for rockets as it allows us to adjust the trajectory of a rocket without the need for large control surfaces that negatively impact drag during an ascent. New and potent combustion catalysts have also resulted in notable efficiency improvements."

 ## Additional Fuel Techs
 fuel_refining_a:0 "Merox Treatment for Jet Fuel"
 fuel_refining_a_desc:0 "Jet engines consume a particular crude oil fraction that is not dissimilar to kerosene. We've used merox treatment to increase kerosene output, and we've found that we can do the same with jet fuel. With this, our jet planes will not have to make do with gasoline or diesel oil and cut into our national reserves."
 fuel_refining_b:0 "Improved Vacuum Distillation"
 fuel_refining_b_desc:0 "Atmospheric bottoms of crude oil are distilled via vacuum to produce different byproducts used by our hydrocrackers, cokers, and hydrotreaters for various fuels. There is, however, a non-condensible waste byproduct that is entirely useless. By improving the efficacy of our vacuum distillation process, we can reduce overall waste per amount of atmospheric bottoms from our starting distillation, adding additional material for our eventual gasoline blending pool."
 fuel_refining_c:0 "Alkylate Gasoline Blend"
 fuel_refining_c_desc:0 "Generally, liquefied gas petrol (LPG) or autogas is not a particularly efficient motor fuel. However, it is a byproduct that we can convert into alkylate, premium gasoline blending stock due to its exceptional anti-knock properties and clean burning. Reusing olefin from FCC byproducts can generate a reaction with isobutane to create a better gasoline blending stock, increasing the output of high-grade gasoline."
 fuel_refining_d:0 "Reclaiming Refinery Fuel"
 fuel_refining_d_desc:0 "Fuel refineries can produce hydrogen sulfide by amine treatment of residual fuel gas from gas processes of previous distillations. A byproduct of the former process is a low-grade refinery fuel that went primarily unused due to its low energy-to-litre ratio. However, the refineries themselves can use it instead of more precious petroleum products that our country can use elsewhere."

 modern_oil_processing_a:0 "Olefin Polymerisation"
 modern_oil_processing_a_desc:0 "Olefin is a specific alkene hydrocarbon that can be polymerised into a number of polymers with high industrial value, ranging from plastics to, more importantly, fuel. With this, the demand for these materials rises, and we must meet that demand."
 modern_oil_processing_b:0 "Fluid Catalytic Cracking"
 modern_oil_processing_b_desc:0 "New cracking processes that utilise solid acid catalysts, such as silica-alumina and zeolites, promote the formation of carbocations. Fluid catalytic cracking is far less energy-intensive than previous methods and stabilises hydrocarbon fuels."
 modern_oil_processing_c:0 "Hydrosulfurisation"
 modern_oil_processing_c_desc:0 "A revolutionary catalytic process used to remove sulfur from refined petroleum will upgrade the octane rating of current fuels, meaning that less fuel is needed for the same energy."
 modern_oil_processing_d:0 "Future Propellants"
 modern_oil_processing_d_desc:0 "With the growth of the field of rocketry, specialised propellants such as ammonium perchlorate and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) become a premium as the demand for them increases. The Oil-Rags process utilizing ammonia and sodium hypochlorite in the presence of gelatin synthesizes hydrazines, a crucial precursor of UDMH. Thus, this allows not just our rockets to launch, but also for our planes to fly."


 modern_rubber_processing_a:0 "Dehydrogenation Catalysts"
 modern_rubber_processing_a_desc:0 "Previous bottlenecks in butadiene production have stifled our total output of synthetic rubber, but breakthroughs in dehydrogenation have yielded accelerated processes in the refinement of butadiene. This will allow large-scale butadiene production and, in turn, an even greater output of artificial rubber."
 modern_rubber_processing_b:0 "Styrene-Butadiene Rubber"
 modern_rubber_processing_b_desc:0 "The search of new monomers as alternatives to be polymerised with butadiene have resulted in a copolymer with styrene, often referred to as SRB. SRB's flexible ratio means that we can induce different properties in the final product, such as a harder and less elastic rubber."
 modern_rubber_processing_c:0 "Polymerisation Refinements"
 modern_rubber_processing_c_desc:0 "Further research into solution polymerisation with alkyl lithium compounds provides greater control over the process, permitting additional tailoring of the SBR polymer. With specific 'recipes', we can further specialise our production of pneumatics."
 modern_rubber_processing_d:0 "Modern Techniques"
 modern_rubber_processing_d_desc:0 "The usage of a chromium-based catalyst or titanium tetrachloride further enhances plastic throughput comparative to prior processes.The discovery of new platics such as polyglycols and polysulfones which have a variety of favorable properties for use in both civilian and military applications. Should widespread adoption of both new plastics and new catalysts occur, it may well be possible for artificial rubbers in the form of plastics to overtake natural rubber production."


 tech_synthetic_crystal_refinery:0 "Flame Fusion Synthesis"
 tech_synthetic_crystal_refinery_desc:0 "Using a variation of a process dating back to the 900s, we have discovered a way to synthesise magical crystals on an industrial scale. Previously it was the magical element that was considered to be impossible, but a consistent method has been found. Instead of relying on simple heat to liquify pure crystal powders collected from other industrial processes, a magically charged electrical arc seems to be capable of imbuing the desired properties during the formation of the crystal boule."
 tech_synthetic_crystal_refinery_1:0 "Crystal Pulling Synthesis"
 tech_synthetic_crystal_refinery_1_desc:0 "Although effective, the flame fusion method had its drawbacks. The primary problems encountered with the process were the relative impurity of the crystals produced and additionally the limited kinds of material that could be used. Whilst the crystal pulling method does not address the second issue - primarily utilising metals and metalloids - it certainly is capable of producing higher grade crystals. For now at least, it seems like both methods have a place in the industry."
 tech_synthetic_crystal_refinery_2:0 "Flux Growth Synthesis"
 tech_synthetic_crystal_refinery_2_desc:0 "Although especially slow and expensive, the flux growth method of crystal synthesis has produced our highest quality crystals to date; most likely to be used in particular potent munitions where high magical energy tolerances are most critical. Relying on a solution - typically the flux constitutes a pure metal in the liquid state -  that dissolves crystalline material, this process creates impressive formations that emerge slowly after allowing the flux to cool for up to a year."
 tech_synthetic_crystal_refinery_3:0 "Hydrothermal Growth Synthesis"
 tech_synthetic_crystal_refinery_3_desc:0 "Though representing yet another expensive and slow stage of synthetic crystal production, the hydrothermal growth method has finally allowed us to produce a new type of crystal. Synthetic quartz has long been out of our reach as it - like several other crystals - requires intense pressure to form under natural circumstances. Using a water solution pressurised and heated inside a hermetically sealed steel cylinder, we can closely emulate the conditions required."
 tech_synthetic_crystal_refinery_4:0 "Microwave-Assisted Synthesis"
 tech_synthetic_crystal_refinery_4_desc:0 "Building on the knowledge gained in the pursuit optimising the hydrothermal growth process, it has been theorised that using microwaves to uniformly and rapidly heat the nutrient solutions could drastically cut down on the time required to produce crystals. Such an advancement would not make the method more cost effective than flame fusion or crystal pulling, but it would lower the technological and financial bar for entry and thus increase the nationwide crystal output."

 RACIAL_SPECFORCE_DOCTRINE_LABEL:0 "Racial Special Forces"
 RACIAL_SPECFORCE_DOCTRINE_DESC:0 "Though modern weapons and tactics have steadily become more widespread, our own specialties are not to be forgotten."
 racial_specforce_start:0 "Elevate Our Best"
 racial_specforce_start_desc:0 "Evolutions of old traditions and equipment have proven to be very effective when officers young enough to consistently innovate are placed in command. It's no wonder that even today our kind's specialised combat roles manage to remain relevant, which is precisely why we have dedicated more internal resources to division reform."
 racial_specforce_left1:0 "Comprehensive Command Integration"
 racial_specforce_left1_desc:0 "In the past it has proven difficult to utilise our most valuable units in conjunction with the rest of the army, but this shall be the case no more. We cannot afford infighting over positions, titles and ranks that often compromises the effectiveness of the military, so we must codify a crystal clear chain of command."
 racial_specforce_right1:0 "Unyielding Volley Fire"
 racial_specforce_right1_desc:0 "Although massed infantry fire is typically considered to be ineffective against planes, a large part of the problem is the relative inaccuracy of regular soldiers when under duress. It has been noted that our most resilient and best trained troops perform much better when threatened with enemy air support, which has encouraged the development of anti-air volley fire techniques to supplement the usage of proper AA weaponry."
 racial_specforce_left2:0 "Unique Fortification Strategies"
 racial_specforce_left2_desc:0 "Although our regular infantry are more than capable of constructing adequate defensive positions, they are limited by their basic equipment and training. Having been dragged into the modern era, our specialist troops are more than willing and able to create unique fortification networks that consistently surprise and repel our enemies."
 racial_specforce_right2:0 "Specialised Armour Support"
 racial_specforce_right2_desc:0 "Although tanks have proven to be immensely useful on the battlefield, it is already clear that they do not operate quite as well in conjunction with our specialised divisions.

 basic_encryption_lar:1 "Mechanical Rotor Cyphers"
 basic_encryption_lar_desc:0 "The introduction of electro-mechanical integral computers has rendered most traditional cyphers based on lingual encryptions vulnerable. However, we can use the same computers and adapt them as cyphering tools for our existing polyalphabetic cyphers. With multiple rotors, these devices scramble the letters of messages that can only be understood with a key. The cypher machines aren't foolproof, but their encoding is solid enough to stop most attackers."
 improved_encryption_lar:1 "Applied Number Theory"
 improved_encryption_lar_desc:0 "All of our codes are structured, and their strength lies in how obscure the structures are. The more cycles of the cypher arrangements we have, the denser our encoding is to cryptanalysts. These permutations can be increased exponentially with a straightforward equation, though we've struggled with integrating factorials of a high order. With computer assistance, our encoders can easily use higher-order factorials to produce stronger cyphers."
 advanced_encryption_lar:1 "Pulse-Code Modulation"
 advanced_encryption_lar_desc:0 "The spread of digital computers has offered an exciting option for our encoders. We can digitally represent samples of analogue radio signals via pulse-code modulation (PCM) and store them in binary. This method adds a new layer of encryption by producing seemingly random sounds that our computers can transcribe and translate. This breakthrough is sure to make our military communications even more secure."
 basic_decryption_lar:1 "Frequency Analysis"
 basic_decryption_lar_desc:0 "Intelligence gathering is increasingly becoming a mathematical problem, as radios and telegrams are encoded in increasingly hidden systems. Machine-assisted decryption is now a possibility with the introduction of cyclometers. With these devices, mathematicians use frequency analysis to 'count' the letters in cyphertexts and aid in exploiting flawed cyphers."
 improved_decryption_lar:1 "Side-Channel Attacks"
 improved_decryption_lar_desc:0 "Traditionally, decrypting hidden messages involves a concentrated effort in decode the messages themselves. However, we've found that we can gain information from the implementation of computer systems used in cypher machines. We can exploit these additional sources of data to glean the nature of the cyphers. These 'side-channel' attacks require considerable technical knowledge, but decyphering enemy intelligence is crucial to our war efforts."
 advanced_decryption_lar:1 "Automated Deduction Analysis"
 advanced_decryption_lar_desc:0 "As enemy cyphers become more sophisticated, immediate analysis of codes becomes far more challenging. We can detect specific cypher routines with parallelised automated theorem proving run through high clock speed computers. From there, the deductions made by running logic engines offer various clues and traces of the otherwise impenetrable cypher structures."

 ## Additional Ship Techs
 semi_modern_fire_control_system:0 "Dual Ballistic Fire Control System"
 semi_modern_fire_control_system_desc:0 "As dual-purpose armaments become commonplace, we've found that the surface and anti-airborne fire control systems can lead to confusion for our secondary batteries. To avoid this, we can use a single fire control system to simultaneously produce gun orders for two different gun types against the same target. This dual ballistic system prevents mixed signals from being sent to our gun crews and improves the fire control capabilities of our ships mounted with this system."
 modern_fire_control_system:0 "Hybrid Fire Control System"
 modern_fire_control_system_desc:0 "The best of both worlds, we can use a hybrid electronic and electro-mechanical system instead of either one. It is both more resistant due to its mechanical redundancies but can also utilise electrical high-precision resolvers instead of the slower mechanical ones, multiplied with precision linear potentiometers. Large and spacious, this new system is probably the best that we can achieve with analogue fire control systems."
 modern_fire_control_system_2:0 "Remote Magical Fire Control System"
 modern_fire_control_system_2_desc:0 "A novel idea has given way to introducing remote magical fire control, where the gun crew and the fire director share command of the guns. Gunnery officers in the fire director can direct and fire the ship's weapon systems by relying on a magical link. Oncoming fire cannot sever the connection between the gun platform and the director, allowing the system to resist for longer before control is lost."

By improving the efficacy of our vacuum distillation process, we can reduce overall waste per amount of atmospheric bottoms from our starting distillation, adding additional material for our eventual gasoline blending pool."
 fuel_refining_c:0 "Alkylate Gasoline Blend"
 fuel_refining_c_desc:0 "Generally, liquefied gas petrol (LPG) or autogas is not a particularly efficient motor fuel. However, it is a byproduct that we can convert into alkylate, premium gasoline blending stock due to its exceptional anti-knock properties and clean burning. Reusing olefin from FCC byproducts can generate a reaction with isobutane to create a better gasoline blending stock, increasing the output of high-grade gasoline."
 fuel_refining_d:0 "Reclaiming Refinery Fuel"
 fuel_refining_d_desc:0 "Fuel refineries can produce hydrogen sulfide by amine treatment of residual fuel gas from gas processes of previous distillations. A byproduct of the former process is a low-grade refinery fuel that went primarily unused due to its low energy-to-litre ratio. However, the refineries themselves can use it instead of more precious petroleum products that our country can use elsewhere."

 modern_oil_processing_a:0 "Olefin Polymerisation"
 modern_oil_processing_a_desc:0 "Olefin is a specific alkene hydrocarbon that can be polymerised into a number of polymers with high industrial value, ranging from plastics to, more importantly, fuel. With this, the demand for these materials rises, and we must meet that demand."
 modern_oil_processing_b:0 "Fluid Catalytic Cracking"
 modern_oil_processing_b_desc:0 "New cracking processes that utilise solid acid catalysts, such as silica-alumina and zeolites, promote the formation of carbocations. Fluid catalytic cracking is far less energy-intensive than previous methods and stabilises hydrocarbon fuels."
 modern_oil_processing_c:0 "Hydrosulfurisation"
 modern_oil_processing_c_desc:0 "A revolutionary catalytic process used to remove sulfur from refined petroleum will upgrade the octane rating of current fuels, meaning that less fuel is needed for the same energy."
 modern_oil_processing_d:0 "Future Propellants"
 modern_oil_processing_d_desc:0 "With the growth of the field of rocketry, specialised propellants such as ammonium perchlorate composite propellant become a premium as the demand for them increases. As these cannot be obtained outside of artificial formulants, we must vastly improve the output of the latter to allow not just our rockets to launch, but also for our jets to fly, and our tanks to function at peak performance."

 modern_rubber_processing_a:0 "Dehydrogenation Catalysts"
 modern_rubber_processing_a_desc:0 "Previous bottlenecks in butadiene production have stifled our total output of synthetic rubber, but breakthroughs in dehydrogenation have yielded accelerated processes in the refinement of butadiene. This will allow large-scale butadiene production and, in turn, an even greater output of artificial rubber."
 modern_rubber_processing_b:0 "Styrene-Butadiene Rubber"
 modern_rubber_processing_b_desc:0 "The search of new monomers as alternatives to be polymerised with butadiene have resulted in a copolymer with styrene, often referred to as SRB. SRB's flexible ratio means that we can induce different properties in the final product, such as a harder and less elastic rubber."
 modern_rubber_processing_c:0 "Polymerisation Refinements"
 modern_rubber_processing_c_desc:0 "Further research into solution polymerisation with alkyl lithium compounds provides greater control over the process, permitting additional tailoring of the SBR polymer. With specific 'recipes', we can further specialise our production of pneumatics."
 modern_rubber_processing_d:0 "Modern Techniques"
 modern_rubber_processing_d_desc:0 "Additional hydrocarbon refinements have led to the further improvements and acceleration to existing processes of synthesising rubber. At this rate, artificial rubber will eclipse that of natural rubber."

 modern_theory:0 "Modern Naval Theory"
 modern_theory_desc:0 "With great battles behind us and lessons learned from them, the time has come to reexamine the best way to organize a fleet. The first order of business is ensuring every aspect of the fleet is ready to engage at any time and at any location it is required."
 modern_fleet:0 "Modern Fleet Manoeuvres"
 modern_fleet_desc:0 "The fleet needs to be able to separate into independent strike forces and then reunite for major battles. Training our sailors in how to achieve both objectives will open up new possibilities in naval warfare."
 submarine_escort:0 "Submarine Escort"
 submarine_escort_desc:0 "Submarines normally hunt convoys, but with the advent of powerful radar systems they can hunt each other. Wire-guided torpedos in turn allow the submarines to take on their enemy counterparts."
 missile_fundamentals:0 "Missile Warfare Fundamentals"
 missile_fundamentals_desc:0 "Missiles provide a new route for ship combat, letting us send payloads directly to the target. By having destroyers mark down the enemy location and missile position, we can correct errors in flight in real time."
 modern_capital_tactics:0 "Modern Capital Ship Tactics"
 modern_capital_tactics_desc:0 "It is no longer sufficient to have a fleet sitting in port doing nothing. Every ship is expected to do its part at all times, which means capital ships will have to adapt to many roles as the navy demands."
 surface_harassment:0 "Surface Harassment"
 surface_harassment_desc:0 "Small skirmishes let us wear the enemy down, keeping them constantly on the back hoof and unable to mount a strong offense. Using smaller fleets to tie up larger ones, we can divert the enemy away from more important tasks."
 missile_age_engagements:0 "Missile Engagements"
 missile_age_engagements_desc:0 "Missiles let even the smallest ship face down the heaviest. With the incorporation of missiles across the fleet, every ship becomes part of a distributed kill chain. From the destroyer to the battleship or carrier, everything that floats must be ready to destroy the enemy navy."
 cv_core_role:0 "Carrier Core Role"
 cv_core_role_desc:0 "The times are changing, and the carrier is right in the centre of it. Able to achieve air superiority on both land and sea, it is clear the carrier will be the most important part of the navy in the years to come."
 cruiser_primacy:0 "Cruiser Primacy"
 cruiser_primacy_desc:0 "As versatile as carriers are, they cannot function alone. They need a vast fleet of screening and support to aid them. New, faster cruisers will make up the bulk of our navy's tonnage."
 control_of_the_sea:0 "Control of the Seas"
 control_of_the_sea_desc:0 "Carriers project an awesome dominance simply from their presence. Bombers can sink ships long before the carriers even come into range. With our carrier fleet, no one will dare challenge us on the high seas."
 cv_support_role:0 "Carrier Support Role"
 cv_support_role_desc:0 "While carriers enjoy some benefits over other ships, they have just as many drawbacks. We cannot build a fleet upon them; instead, they will be reshuffled into a role befitting a specialized ship."
 heavy_ressurgence:0 "Heavy Ship Resurgence"
 heavy_ressurgence_desc:0 "Naval air power has not eclipsed the raw force of big guns. With recent advances such as primitive anti-ship missiles, the battleship and battlecruiser will endure well into the coming decades."
 area_denial:0 "Area Denial"
 area_denial_desc:0 "Carriers need to be as fast as the targets they're hunting. Track them down without delay and blast them apart one by one."
 modern_escort:0 "Modern Escort Tactics"
 modern_escort_desc:0 "Convoys have become increasingly vulnerable to planes and submarines as newer and deadlier ship-killers are devised. By having our anti-air guns fire in synchronized volleys, they can be made far more effective."
 sub_hunting:0 "Modern Submarine Hunting Tactics"
 sub_hunting_desc:0 "Submarines have become nearly invisible in the intervening years since our last ASW developments. To counter them now will take modern methods such as triangulating from separate destroyers and new training for scout pilots."
 asw_helicopter_application:0 "Anti Submarine Helicopter Application"
 asw_helicopter_application_desc:0 "Helicopters are proving to be incredibly versatile, and ASW models are already making their way into our fleet. To properly apply them, however, will take new training. Pilots who previously could only report on the position of submarines now can fire depth charges and torpedos down at them, necessitating new experience and education."
 modern_sub_tactics:0 "Modern Submarine Tactics"
 modern_sub_tactics_desc:0 "Wolfpack tactics have proven incredibly useful. With new improvements, such as staggering our submarines and encircling an enemy from all sides, we can cut off any hope of escape and increase the chances of a hit."
 stalking:0 "Underwater Stalking"
 stalking_desc:0 "Sometimes it is advantageous not to attack right away, as what appears to be merely a destroyer on patrol may turn out to be scouting ahead for a juicy convoy. All submarines shall be instructed to always keep an eye out for better targets."
 long_duration_patrols:0 "Long Duration Underwater Patrols"
 long_duration_patrols_desc:0 "Every aspect of the submarine is centered around one core role, that of striking against vulnerable surface ships. By emphasizing the critical nature of this role and the dedication it takes, we can stretch food and fuel longer to truly hit anywhere in the world."

 tactical_focus:0 "Modern Strike Bombing"
 tactical_focus_desc:0 "Rather than diving onto an enemy to release a payload, a recent innovation has been to do a vertical loop over the target, releasing the bomb while pointed straight up. This will then fall directly on its target, offering higher accuracy than traditional dive bombing."
 tactical_tac_primacy:0 "Tactical Strikes"
 tactical_tac_primacy_desc:0 "Training our tactical bomber pilots to pull up at the last possible second will let them drop bombs with increased accuracy. "
 cas_primacy:0 "Strike Craft Primacy"
 cas_primacy_desc:0 "Strike craft are the ideal planes to bomb the enemy. While their bomb bays are smaller than tactical bombers, their pinpoint targeting and customizable hardpoints let them get more for less."
 forward_air_controller:0 "Forward Air Controllers"
 forward_air_controller_desc:0 "It's not sufficient to have bombers; we must ensure that our ground troops can call in air support whenever it is needed. Live feedback will help our pilots improve their targeting with each subsequent strike."
 aerial_wave:0 "Aerial Wave"
 aerial_wave_desc:0 "Planes flying air support group up into tight packs, protecting each other from anti-air guns and enemy fighters. Ensuring at least some will make it through even in the hottest zones."
 combined_support:0 "Combined Support"
 combined_support_desc:0 "Tactical bombers and strike craft work in harmony, with tactical bombers flushing the enemy out via carpet bombing followed by tight assaults from strike craft."
 ample_spectrum_ops:0 "Ample Spectrum Operations"
 ample_spectrum_ops_desc:0 "Not all bomber operations take place against surface targets in open fields. A well-rounded training regime will prepare our pilots for naval operations as well as more unpleasant land targets."
 round_the_clock_support:0 "Round the Clock Support"
 round_the_clock_support_desc:0 "By shuffling around sleep schedules, we can ensure our troops on the ground always have a friendly eye in the sky."
 strategic_focus:0 "Precision Bombing"
 strategic_focus_desc:0 "In sharp contrast to the blanket bombing of the past, which both caused excessive collateral damage and wasted precious bombs, the new approach is to emphasize hitting the correct target as reliably as possible. Radar, night-vision, and similar developments will make this possible."
 tactical_str_primacy:0 "Flexible Bomb Platforms"
 tactical_str_primacy_desc:0 "We cannot specialize entirely into strategic bombing. Tactical bombers can perform whatever task is needed of them."
 str_primacy:0 "Strategic Bomber Primacy"
 str_primacy_desc:0 "Ultimately every war is won or lost at the operational level. An enemy unable to supply its troops or equip them with guns will collapse inward with a swift kick. Therefore our strategic bombers will receive the best training available to maximize their power."
 vl_range_escorts:0 "Very Long Range Escorts"
 vl_range_escorts_desc:0 "It is not sufficient to have long-range bombers if they have no escorts to aid them. Therefore fighters and heavy fighters will be trained in conserving fuel as much as possible."
 retaliatory_strikes:0 "Retaliatory Strikes"
 retaliatory_strikes_desc:0 "Striking as enemy fighters are returning to their carriers to refuel will let us catch the carriers off-guard. Anti-air guns will struggle to target our planes when they are among the enemy's."
 aerial_refueling:0 "Aerial Refueling"
 aerial_refueling_desc:0 "By funneling fuel from one plane to another in-flight, we can dramatically increase their effective range."
 global_reach:0 "Global Reach"
 global_reach_desc:0 "Wherever our bombers are, they must be capable of reigning down destruction. Sufficiently powerful bombing can overcome any foe."
 round_the_clock_allert:0 "Round the Clock Alert"
 round_the_clock_allert_desc:0 "An enemy strike could occur at any moment. Therefore we must be able to deliver strikes of our own whenever required."
 basic_jet_operations:0 "Basic Jet Operations"
 basic_jet_operations_desc:0 "The incredible speed of the jet engine lets jet fighters easily outrun traditional props, or conversely chase them down with ease. This must be exploited."
 high_speed_engagements:0 "High Speed Engagement Tactics"
 high_speed_engagements_desc:0 "Learning to operate a plane at nearly the speed of sound is not easy. Our pilots will have to rise to the task."
 offense_in_depth:0 "Offense in Depth"
 offense_in_depth_desc:0 "Focusing on pre-emptive attacks, we can strike enemy fighters when they are taking off or landing, and at their most vulnerable."
 ground_directed:0 "Ground Directed Interception"
 ground_directed_desc:0 "Ground crews report in when a bomber takes off, and fighters are scrambled to intercept it before it can ever reach friendly airspace. Ground radar assists in locating any bombers that slip by."
 onboard_guidance:0 "Aerial Radar Searches"
 onboard_guidance_desc:0 "Getting the most out of onboard radar requires specialized training. But with the appropriate experience, our pilots can always be informed of the location of rival fighters."
 advanced_jet_tactics:0 "Advanced Jet Tactics"
 advanced_jet_tactics_desc:0 "Learning from our mistakes, we have developed more modern methods of avoiding the enemy. Radical methods such as cutting power to the engines can earn a surprise advantage."
 sam_integration:0 "Forward SAM Integration"
 sam_integration_desc:0 "Synchronizing our SAMs with our fighters lets them both become more effective. Our air and land forces work in harmony to achieve full air supremacy."
 intercept_patrols:0 "Constant Interception"
 intercept_patrols_desc:0 "In the era of nuclear weapons, letting a single bomber through can often spell the annihilation of a city. Interception is thus the single most important duty of our fighters."
 missile_tactics:0 "Missile Engagement Tactics"
 missile_tactics_desc:0 "Air-to-air missiles open up a whole new range of options for fighters. While obviously invaluable to dogfighting, they also allow for beyond-visible-range heavy fighters to make a resurgence."
 basic_ECM:0 "Basic Electronic Countermeasures"
 basic_ECM_desc:0 "Electronic warfare has become increasingly relevant for the disruption of missiles. Chaff, flares, and radar jamming are all promising options for interfering with sensors and communications."
 
 JET_CAS_DOCTRINES_TITLE:0 "Precision Bombing" 
 JET_CAS_DOCTRINES_DESC:0 "With the dawn of the jet age, we have to decide how to apply airpower to shape the battlefield."
 JET_FIGHTER_DOCTRINES_TITLE:0 "Jet Age Fighter Theory"
 JET_FIGHTER_DOCTRINES_DESC:0 "Advances in propulsion, radar, and missiles will forever change how we approach air combat."

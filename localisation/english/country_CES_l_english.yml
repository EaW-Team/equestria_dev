 # Civil War Focuses

 CES_cw_1_1:0 "Daring Do and the Jungle of Disharmony"
 CES_cw_1_1_desc:0 ""Well, this isn't quite the story I envisioned telling, but here I am. I still don't know what possessed me to jump up and be the hero I portray in my books. Maybe I always was and never realized it. Either way, this will definitely be my most high-stakes adventure yet.""
 CES_cw_2_1:0 "Find What Weapons We Can"
 CES_cw_2_1_desc:0 "This little corner of Equestria was never particularly known for its industrial capacity. Thankfully, we've managed to locate a few unattended weapons caches that seem to have been intended for Nightmare Moon's forces. We're sure that she won't mind if we borrow them."
 CES_cw_2_2:0 "Request Help from the Locals"
 CES_cw_2_2_desc:0 "The reality is that we are never going to defeat these crazed Lunarists if we do not have everypony united behind our backs. Daring Do has already rallied many to our cause, but we must ask for more, or we will have no hope of restoring Harmony to the southeast."
 CES_cw_3_0:0 "Convert Fishing Barges"
 CES_cw_3_0_desc:0 "Stableside was nowhere near the largest port in Equestria, but it did have some traffic. We're fortunate that a few fishing barges were around at the time that we were cut off from Equestria, and we're even more fortunate that their captains want to help us take back the seas."
 CES_cw_3_1:0 "Prepare the Lowlands"
 CES_cw_3_1_desc:0 "A direct assault into the depths of the jungles remains a difficult task. Perhaps too difficult, if our frontline reports are accurate. But what if we didn't have do all of the fighting inside of those jungles? East of Gallopfrey lays an open field ripe with possibilities. One such possibility is a makeshift air field, from which we can work towards taking the fight to the skies."
 CES_cw_3_2:0 "The Second Bastion of Harmony"
 CES_cw_3_2_desc:0 "Stableside must be the light in this darkness. But an unshaped, unguided light does not offer direction to those who need it. Daring Do may be the glue holding us together, but no one mare is capable of running a war by herself. Our Commander needs help, and that is why we must put aside our differences and fall in line so that she may guide us to victory."
 CES_cw_3_3:0 "Inspire the Scared and Hopeful"
 CES_cw_3_3_desc:0 ""This isn't a story anymore. We are not just fighting for our lives, but for the hopes and dreams of everypony here! We may be cut off from Equestria, but the spirit of Harmony lives within each and every one of us! We cannot fail! We must not fail! WE WILL NOT FAIL! For if we do, then Harmony itself might be lost forever.""
 CES_cw_3_10:0 "Refurbish the Relics"
 CES_cw_3_10_desc:0 "Of the many museums Daring Do has contributed to, only one exists in this region of Equestria. Fortunately, the Stableside Museum of Exotic History contains a veritable abundance of weaponry. Unfortunately, they are antique weaponry. Fortunately, they have never seen use. Unfortunately, they will probably fall to pieces in the jungle. We will take what we can get, though."
 CES_cw_4_0:0 "Repurpose Stableside's Ports"
 CES_cw_4_0_desc:0 "The ports of Stableside are nothing if not well-used. Converting them for the war effort would be both quick and easy, though we must remember to return them to their original purpose once we have succeeded in bringing peace to this land."
 CES_cw_4_1:0 "Recruit the Fisherponies"
 CES_cw_4_1_desc:0 "The famed fisherponies of Stableside have been mastering the sea for generations. While it pains us to ask them to stop and aid in something they are unfamiliar with, perhaps in the future we can reform them into proper seafaring soldiers."
 CES_cw_4_2:0 "The Daring Fighter Squadron"
 CES_cw_4_2_desc:0 "The time is now! With the Commander's blessing, our first fighters can now take flight. The sky belongs to those who live in the light of Celestia's sun, while those who subvert harmony in the shadows below are destined to be defeated!"
 CES_cw_4_3:0 "Modify the Toy Factories"
 CES_cw_4_3_desc:0 "Foals' amenities are often one of the first things to be deprioritized during wartime. With great regret, we must turn their toy factories into arms factories in hopes that one day they may grow up not needing to work in those same factories."
 CES_cw_4_4:0 "The Daring Infantry Regiments"
 CES_cw_4_4_desc:0 "When the call came out to fight against the enemies of Harmony, few answered at first. But like a bursting dam, a huge wave of volunteers have arrived from all over to fight for Celestia, with their own weapons to boot. Now forward march and show them what we're made of!"
 CES_cw_4_10:0 "Portland Center of Naval Operations"
 CES_cw_4_10_desc:0 "One advantage we seem to have over our enemies is the capacity for prolonged naval logistics. Commander Daring Do has proposed that we prepare supplies in Portland to construct additional ports along the coastline so that we may easily supply our troops after taking their territory."
 CES_cw_4_10_unlock_port_decision:0 "Completing this focus will grant us a decision to construct a §YNaval Base§! on the coastline of §YChinamitl§! to supply our troops if we control enough territory around there."
 CES_cw_5_1:0 "Nationalize the Shipwrights"
 CES_cw_5_1_desc:0 "While there are not many shipwrights within Stableside, there exists one who has the capability to churn out vessels faster than almost any other. Fortunately, the ponies running it have already agreed to help us, now it's just a matter of making their cooperation official."
 CES_cw_5_2:0 "Do All That We Can And More"
 CES_cw_5_2_desc:0 "Though we have given our all, our all is not enough! There can be no victory without sacrifice, and we must be willing to sacrifice every comfort of life if it means that future generations get to live in an Equestria where they don't have to sacrifice anything."
 CES_cw_5_4:0 "Fix Up The Workshops"
 CES_cw_5_4_desc:0 "Far too long have our arms factories been working with outdated red tape and antique equipment restricting the full capabilities of production. With the opening of our newest addition to the war effort, we can focus on bringing the rest of our factories up to code."
 CES_cw_5_5:0 "Fear Not The Night"
 CES_cw_5_5_desc:0 "Nightmare Moon's disciples stretch far throughout this land, but not all thestrals support her. There are those who would reject the Nightmare, not out of hate for her, but out of love for who she used to be."
 CES_cw_6_1:0 "The Daring Marine Regiment"
 CES_cw_6_1_desc:0 "As promised, the fisherponies are being returned to their area of expertise, albeit with lots of training and a new purpose in mind: to seize important coastal areas from those who would see Harmony thrown aside."
 CES_cw_6_2:0 "Adapt To The Jungle"
 CES_cw_6_2_desc:0 "The jungles surrounding Ayacachtli and Tenochtitlan are treacherous and miserable to fight in. While we are loathe to use the tactics of our enemies, we must accept that we need to learn from them if we are to defeat them in their very home."
 CES_cw_6_3:0 "The Art of Survival"
 CES_cw_6_3_desc:0 "Daring Do's experiences in rigorous terrains have given her an immense insight into how to survive in these areas. Together with her compatriots and associates, she will put together a manual with tips and tricks to help our troops fight in the wilds."
 CES_cw_6_4:0 "Make A Little Go A Long Way"
 CES_cw_6_4_desc:0 "This has been a weary conflict, but Commander Daring Do has transformed a once-scared group of ponies into a valiant fighting force. Before we would hoard resources in hopes that the war would end quickly, but now we see that this was not the way. We have to spread our resources as far as they will go in order to succeed."
 CES_cw_6_5:0 "Our Reasons, Our Purposes"
 CES_cw_6_5_desc:0 "Commander Daring Do is nothing if not a determined mare. Her defiant speeches seem to convey the same energy depicted in the very books bearing her name, if not more so. Even then, occasionally we must remind ourselves of what exactly we're fighting for."
 CES_cw_6_6:0 "Seize the Nightmare's Tools of War"
 CES_cw_6_6_desc:0 "As the war rages on, we've uncovered more and more supplies stored away by those who seemed to have been preparing for Nightmare Moon's return, as if they knew it was going to happen. While that remains a mystery for later, these supplies can be put to good use fighting against those whom they were intended for."
 CES_cw_7_4:0 "Heroes Never Lose"
 CES_cw_7_4_desc:0 ""For Harmony! For Equestria!" is the battle cry spearheaded by our Commander. For months we've been singing her praises, but she downplays when others call her a hero, preferring to redirect those praises back to us. For heroes are the ones that fight against the darkness. And heroes never lose."

 # Post-war tree

 #intro
 CES_pw_intro_1:0 "Stabilize Stableside"
 CES_pw_intro_1_desc:0 "We may have won the civil war, but now we're faced with the challenge of actually governing the Southeast. To that end, Daring Do has begun creating the framework for a real government, one that can handle all of the "boring politics" ahead. One mare simply can't run everything by herself."
 CES_pw_intro_2:0 "Political Perplexion"
 CES_pw_intro_2_desc:0 "Politicians, like nearly everypony, require a workplace to do their job. We should expand Stableside's city hall however we can to make room for a real government."
 CES_pw_intro_3:0 "Puzzling Parties"
 CES_pw_intro_3_desc:0 "Though most paperwork and legislation will be done after the government has been set up, some of it needs our immediate attention. In fact, "some" may be an understatement."
 CES_pw_intro_4:0 "Look Upon Equestria"
 CES_pw_intro_4_desc:0 "Now that we have organized our fledgling government, the time has come to finish reestablishing contact with the rest of the continent. The only question is, what has happened to Equestria while we were busy restoring harmony to the Southeast?"

Let's use the knowledge of our environment to conduct a series of all-terrain exercises, then reorganize our tactics and strategies to adapt our forces to this sprawling, treacherous, and humid jungle we call home."
 CES_army_3_2:0 "Our Home We Must Protect"
 CES_army_3_2_desc:0 "With the civil war, we were denied proper military production. As a result, whatever firearms and supplies did arrive were rustic, and typically vestigial. Our war industry must be ready to produce the weapons we need if our homes are threatened ever again, and this time, whatever we hold in our hooves must be serviceable."
 CES_army_3_3:0 "Fighting Amidst the Heat and Trees"
 CES_army_3_3_desc:0 "The civil war was a logistical nightmare. Trucks of supplies would arrive late, if at all. Anything paradropped would get tangled and swallowed by the forests. Dehydration claimed the lives of our soldiers before enemy bullets did. We must improve our logistical prowess, even if taming this forests proves to be a heavy task."

 CES_army_4_1_desc:0 "Among the many important lessons we learned from this war — irregular warfare is a paramount idea we cannot leave unexplored. Our army may be official, but at times, relying on some of the tactics we'd utilized during the civil war may pay off against an enemy unfamiliar with the laws of the jungles."
 CES_army_4_2:0 "Borrow Firearm Designs"
 CES_army_4_2_desc:0 "Equestria has always lacked innovative gunsmiths, and the few it has certainly wouldn't live here in the Southeast. We do, however, have Chiropterran remnants that have used unique and efficient firearms. The ex-mercenaries of Aztlan who joined our cause know where to find their schematics.

 CES_navy_2_1:0 "Rebuild The Baltimare Dockyards"
 CES_navy_2_1_desc:0 "Regrettably the assaults on Baltimare had caused significant damage to it's naval infrastructure, hampering naval production and maintenance for the ESEN, as well as halting most pre-war trade through the ports. By rebuilding the ports we should be able to recapture the Charm City's luster."
 CES_navy_2_2:0 "Expand the Stableside Dockyards"
 CES_navy_2_2_desc:0 "During the war we had grown reliant on supplies and trade through the Stableside ports, which were not built to support the amount of shipments we needed.

 CES_navy_3_1:0 "The Southeastern Coast Guard"

 CES_navy_3_3:0 "The Crown Jewel of the Seas"
 CES_navy_3_3_desc:0 "It is impossible to ignore the allure of battleships upon the sea, of the pure power they hold even in the age of the carrier.\n\nSurely, despite the heavy costs and exceedingly long construction times we could try to make our own?"
 CES_navy_4_1:0 "Silent Killers"
 CES_navy_4_1_desc:0 "From our research, the most cost effective way to win a naval war is careful and clever usage of submarines. They're cheap enough to produce en masse, stealthy enough to escape detection from our foes and strong enough to strangle the economies of our enemies."
 CES_navy_4_2:0 "The Heart of a Fleet"
 CES_navy_4_2_desc:0 "Our planned battleships, though impressive, will be out of the picture for longer than we'd like. Thus some of our naval engineers have presented a plan for a sister series of heavy cruisers to fill the gaps until our battleships enter service."
 CES_navy_5_1:0 "Our Own Cruisers"
 CES_navy_5_1_desc:0 "With our forays into light ships a glaring gap between our larger and lighter projects has revealed itself.

 CES_navy_5_2:0 "Learn to Adapt, Adapt to Survive"
 CES_navy_5_2_desc:0 "Despite our efforts, whatever high command we've been able to assemble are still woefully unprepared for a true war on the seas.

 CES_air_2_1:0 "Import Surplus Fighters"
 CES_air_2_1_desc:0 "Despite their effectiveness, the fighters we had during the war were not limitless. We've only got a shell of the former number we had when the DFS was established, and even then they're of limited use in dogfights given their lack of maintenance. To bolster our forces we should purchase older models of foreign fighters."
 CES_air_2_2:0 "Import Outdated Bombers"
 CES_air_2_2_desc:0 "As nice as it would be to procure a fleet of modern bombers, our situation does not allow us to afford such an expense at the minute.

 CES_air_3_2:0 "Establish Actual Airfields"
 CES_air_3_2_desc:0 "Our current airfields are lacking, mostly cleared dirt runways with a few caves here and there out of desperation.

 CES_air_3_3:0 "The Heavy Wings Saltmane"
 CES_air_3_3_desc:0 "Heavy Wings, a Baltimare firm focused on the design of twin engine bombers, have offered up a fleet of naval bombers which were to be shipped to Equestria shortly before the civil war began.\n\nSince they've been sitting in stockpile we'd be able to get them for a small fee to complement our air force."
 CES_air_4_1:0 "Standardize SEAF Training"
 CES_air_4_1_desc:0 "Though our current pilots are veterans of the war and hopeful recruits, they're not going to last. We should take advantage of their experience while we still have access to them, and get them to act as teachers for new recruits in the expanding SEAF.

 CES_air_4_2:0 "Support Heavy Wings"
 CES_air_4_2_desc:0 "Given their lack of buyers recently, Heavy Wings have fallen on hard times. If we were to give them funding to get back on their feet, in exchange for some of their designers, then they should be able to stand with us when we need them."
 CES_air_5_1:0 "The Vanilla Mosquito"
 CES_air_5_1_desc:0 "After the success of the Vanilla Comet, Vanilla Clouds has come up with a new design for a CAS role. Designed to bomb light targets while the Comet focuses on distracting enemy fighters, it should ensure our troops are able to punch far above their own weight."
 CES_air_5_2:0 "Night Fighter Squadrons"
 CES_air_5_2_desc:0 "There exists a type of fighting mostly ignored by other countries, that of using the night as you would any other weapon in your arsenal.

 CES_air_5_3:0 "The Heavy Wings Baltimare"
 CES_air_5_3_desc:0 "Heavy Wings have unveiled a new project, one that truly lives up to their name. The Heavy Wings Baltimare promises to fly like a rock, handle like a bull and carry enough explosives to level a town.

 CES_air_6_1:0 "Through Adversity to the Stars"
 CES_air_6_1_desc:0 "Throughout the SEAF a new feeling has emerged, that of pride. Of their craft, of the skies they fight in and of their fellow airponies.\nThought of as an extension of the airponies closeness to the skies, this pride propels them to go further than they thought they could.\nTo push them high enough arrive at the very stars themselves."

 CES_industry_3_1:0 "Secure Our Rubber Production"
 CES_industry_3_1_desc:0 "The main lifeblood of Southeastern trade after the turn of the millenium was it's vast amount of rubber, a necessity in both modern civilian goods and military equipment. Most of the companies exploiting the area were scared off by the war, leaving a perfect gap for us to acquire these fields for ourselves."
 CES_industry_3_2:0 "Pave The Southeast"
 CES_industry_3_2_desc:0 "The world around us has changed drastically in the last few years, and even before that the infrastructure of the Southeast was dated.

 CES_industry_4_1:0 "Develop Cash Crop Plantations"
 CES_industry_4_1_desc:0 "While rubber is the most vital export of the Southeast, there are many other cash crops produced as well. In addition to cocoa beans, which have been cultivated by natives for centuries, our plantations produce coffee, sugar and bananas.

 CES_industry_4_3_desc:0 "Our industry demands raw resources. Aluminium, Rubber, Tungsten, but most importantly it hungers for as much Steel as we can feed it. The old steelworks of Baltimare which were used to great effect in the war would help satiate our industry."
 CES_industry_4_4:0 "Formalise The Stableside Armories"
 CES_industry_4_4_desc:0 "Though the Humble Corner of Harmony served us well, we still have need of it's industry. There are many ponies who threw themselves into the production of military equipment when the war began, and they should be honoured and supported just as well as those who fought in the jungles. We can accomplish this by funding some of the more prominent armorers who served."
 CES_industry_5_1:0 "The Riches of the Jungles"
 CES_industry_5_1_desc:0 "With the material wealth of the Southeast, we have managed to reverse the economic decline caused by the war, and finally managed to turn a profit again.

 CES_industry_5_2:0 "Build Hydroelectric Dams"
 CES_industry_5_2_desc:0 "An investor from Les Meridiennes has come with a proposal for the construction of dams across the great rivers of the Southeast. Though the project will be expensive, the potential gain from electrical generation would fuel our industrial expansion greatly."
 CES_industry_5_3:0 "Our Own Industrial Revolution"
 CES_industry_5_3_desc:0 "With production of goods and services within the port cities picking up steam at a far greater pace than we expected, our economy isn't anywhere near as dire as it had been.

 CES_industry_6_1:0 "Re-fund Diamond Mining"
 CES_industry_6_1_desc:0 "An incredibly lucrative industry in the Aztlan jungles are the diamond mines contained within. The beautiful gemstone can be found in vast quantities and, if given a small push, can easily bring in enough bits to help finance our other projects."
 CES_industry_6_2:0 "Restore the Logging Industries"
 CES_industry_6_2_desc:0 "The trees that make up the jungles and forests of the Southeast province high quality wood which is desired by elites throughout the world.

 CES_industry_6_4:0 "Continue Industrial Expansion"
 CES_industry_6_4_desc:0 "With a more secure economic standing, and more investments showing great signs day after day, we can finance further industrial projects across the nation to help expand our other cities, our production and hopefully provide jobs for those ponies who need them the most."
 CES_industry_7_1:0 "Develop Our Own Electronics"
 CES_industry_7_1_desc:0 "For the most part we've been using electronics which were left behind before the war started. Though these have served us well, we must move on and use a new generations of radars, computers and fire control systems. Though offers have come from abroad, we've turned them down as this is a perfect opportunity to develop our own electronics for future use."
 CES_industry_7_2:0 "Modernise Our Production Methods"
 CES_industry_7_2_desc:0 "It's all well and good to build more factories, but the most important factor within each factory is efficiency. By refining our production methods and ensuring that they are as efficient as we can possibly make them we can ensure our continued prosperity."
 CES_industry_7_3:0 "Fund Our New Synthetic Industries"
 CES_industry_7_3_desc:0 "Despite our fields of rubber, we do not hold as much oil production as we'd like. Thus proposals for experiments in the field of producing oil artificially have been accepted, with the first facilities already under construction."
 CES_industry_8_1:0 "Create the Stableside Technical Institute"
 CES_industry_8_1_desc:0 "With our economy showing no signs of slowing, we now have the leeway required to sponsor new scientific developments at a new university in Stableside.

 daring.1.t:0 "From Book Hero To Real Hero" #podrick
 daring.1.desc:0 "Things had happened so quickly.\n\nA.K. Yearling was doing book signings in Stableside when the news broke out. Nightmare Moon had returned? A civil war had begun? In the blink of an eye, the once-peaceful land of Equestria had fractured into multiple pieces. Communications across Equestria went dark as loyalists to Nightmare Moon sabotaged almost every method of getting word from one place to another.\n\nStableside was cut off from Equestria, and its residents had begun to panic.\n\nSuddenly, a strangely familiar pony had begun to rally scared ponies to her side. Many were in disbelief: This wasn't possible, she was only a character from a book series. A myth, nothing more. And yet there Daring Do was, flying around the city with a megaphone telling ponies to be brave. She had quickly garnered a following as ponies realized that she was the real deal.\n\nSoon enough, Daring Do had organized enough ponies to spread the word that not all in this corner of Equestria wanted to watch Nightmare Moon take over the land. As the news reached the neighboring cities, many like-minded ponies flocked to this improvised organization devoted to the restoration of peace and harmony.\n\nAnd so the Celestial Resistance was born."
 daring.1.a:0 "They never did question what happened to A.K. Yearling, though."

 daring.2.t:0 "Improvising A War" #podrick
 daring.2.desc:0 ""What are your orders, Commander?"\n\nDaring Do could have sworn that she'd heard that question more times in the past few weeks than there were words in all of her books combined. She had originally intended to jumpstart a resistance movement against the Lunarists who had proclaimed this region as a part of their "New Lunar Empire", but nopony else had been willing to take the reigns and actually lead this kitchen sink army.\n\nAn army that was doing surprisingly well, as evidenced by how they hadn't been completely crushed yet. It was a miracle that they'd been able to organize even basic defensive lines against the well-trained militant thestrals.\n\nThankfully, Daring had the full cooperation of Stableside and the surrounding cities. Though everypony still considered themselves to be a part of Equestria, the cut phone lines and general chaos that ensued in the wake of the civil war meant that they were essentially a makeshift country of their own. One that had no actual government to speak of and was held together entirely by an improvised military and a single pony in charge of it all.\n\nTo top things off, some of her books' critics somehow managed to keep finding her to nag about her military strategies "not being what the original trilogy's Daring Do would do.""

 daring.3.desc:0 "The news of Nightmare Moon's disciples beginning to break formation and flee from our soldiers arrived late last night. It was fitting, all things considered, that the last of the Lunarist forces laid down their weapons and surrendered at the break of dawn.\n\nWhile they have shown us nothing but hatred in recent times, we must be better than them. We are Equestrians, and so are they, even if they don't see it that way. Provided that our former enemies do not betray our kindness, they will be treated the same way that everypony should be: as a friend."
 daring.3.a:0 "To fight for Harmony, we must be willing to show mercy."

 daring.4.t:0 "Helping Hooves" #podrick
 daring.4.desc:0 "It was not every day that a "fictional" adventurer who writes books about herself under a secret identity ends up leading an army of ragtag freedom fighters against fanatical Nightmare Moon cultists, bloodthirsty mercenaries, and worst of all, socialists. Not to mention that a certain loudmouth kept following her into active war zones just to complain about how the "original trilogy's Daring Do" would have handled things differently. Quibble Pants was his name, right?\n\n"...and on page 137 of Daring Do and the Sapphire Stone, it CLEARLY STATES that quote: 'Daring Do would never intentionally place herself or others in danger!' Furthermore..." On and on he went, ranting about the tiniest details.\n\n"Everypony's a critic..." She muttered under her breath. Fortunately, help arrived in the form of two ponies that recently assisted her in organizing her forces. The former was a young, neatly dressed stallion by the name of Good Word, the latter a... generously sized, middle-aged stallion adorned with dress-like attire traditionally worn by the natives of the Equestrian Southeast. Chief Maita, she recalled.\n\n"Ah, Commander Do! It is good that you are here!" exclaimed Chief Maita, paying no heed to the odd earth pony rambling on behind her. He approached Daring Do and scooped her up in an enormous embrace that caught her off guard, "I have gathered all members of my tribe as requested! And several neighboring ones as well! They will join the fight under your banner."\n\nDaring struggled to breathe. "Good... to see... you too... Stop hugging!"\n\nAs Chief Maita released her, Good Word trotted up to her with an enthusiastic smile. "Greetings Commander Daring. You will be pleased to know that the Friendship Lodge is working tirelessly to organize volunteers for the cause. Your message of fighting for harmony is being spread far and wide... well, as far and wide as it can reasonably go without long-distance communication."\n\nThis was progressing better than she anticipated. "Thank you both. Please ensure that any new recruits get at least some basic training before they're sent to fight. And it's just Daring Do." She nodded, then excused herself to try to escape Quibble's unending criticisms.\n\nGood Word and Chief Maita exchanged glances. "She is commanding us though, isn't she?" Both shrugged."
 daring.4.a:0 ""Right away, Commander!""

 daring.5.t:0 "A Day At The Ranges" #Sentry
 daring.5.desc:0 "Daring Do peered over her clipboard at the training area before her. She had her reservations when the plans were made, but seeing ponies determinedly train even with the limited equipment they had been given was enough to assuage them. Even now dozens of ponies flitted through the air, performed basic drills, and trained at the firing range.\n\nWandering across the courtyard, Daring couldn't help but start listening to the overlapping conversations around her from the raw recruits. Those brave souls who stood for harmony talked of home and of hope. She smiled, before hearing some wondering where their friends who'd signed up before them had gone.\n\nDaring picked up the pace.\n\nHer thoughts were thrown aside as she heard a deafening crack from the firing range, followed by a string of expletives. Moving towards the range, Daring could see a mare struggling with an anti-tank rifle almost as large as she was. "Oh come on! I just got this stupid thing fixed..."\n\nTrotting over, Daring noticed the look in the mare's eyes. As they readied another shot, Daring decocked the rifle, causing the mare to look up at her in surprise. "This thing's been seeing far more action in the past few months than it's seen in years, I'm not surprised it's being grouchy." Daring said as she patted the weapon.\n\n"I can understand that but it's just-" The mare sighed, "I'm going to be relying on it soon enough, and I can't afford it breaking when I need it. If it does then..."\n\nThe unspoken statement hung in the air for a moment as Daring softened her gaze. "I've found throughout the years that the least reliable tool will always end up working when the moment is critical. All it takes is the courage to trust it to the end."\n\nThe mare gulped and looked at the rifle. "What if I don"t have that courage?" Daring smiled."
 daring.5.a:0 ""You're here, aren't you?""

 daring.6.t:0 "At Your Service, Commander" #Sentry
 daring.6.desc:0 "After finalising the agreements with the Stableside Tradition Co, Daring Do decided to take a walk across the docks. The refreshing scent of the ocean filled the air as Daring's gaze settled on a dock where a damaged destroyer was being tended to.\n\nThe ship was worked on by a strangely efficient team composed of pegasi and the occasional griffon, while a tall, blue unicorn mare was passing up materials and giving orders. Getting closer, she noted just how focused the unicorn was on her team. She'd even made it directly behind the mare without her even taking her eyes off the materials she was passing up.\n\nEventually, she spoke up. "Seems like ha-" Her unexpected voice startled the mare, causing her to lose control of the metal sheet she was passing up. In a split second Daring dived forward, tackling the mare to get both of them out of the way.\n\nAs the dust settled, the mare winced and opened her eyes. "Ow... Why'd you—Wait, C-Commander Daring?" She blinked in recognition, shakily standing and extending a hoof to the commander. "I-I'm Azure Bliss, the 'new' captain of this ship. To what do I owe the pleasure?"\n\nDaring took the hoof and steadily stood back up, brushing herself off as she did so. "I needed some fresh air after a stuffy meeting. Anyways, what's going on with this ship? I thought the scheduled maintenance ended a month ago?"\n\nAzure rubbed the back of her neck guiltily. "Well, the last patrol did a number to the front of the ship and the l-last captain. We brought the ship back for repairs, but after looking at the damage I figured that maybe a bit more armor wouldn't hurt much, a-and-"\n\nDaring examined the additions. It wasn't perfect, but considering they were made out of spare metal, haphazard welds and some hopes, it looked to be surprisingly sturdy. She couldn't really tell more than that, since her expertise in adventuring equipment didn't cover warships. She'd have to ask a naval officer, which the resistance was still sorely lacking.\n\nDaring's ears perked up as she observed the rambling mare. There weren't many options left for naval officers since any admiral worth their saltlick had either thrown their lot in with Baltimare or ran north to serve Celestia. They didn't need the perfect pony for the job, just somepony to hold the fort until the war was over or until a more qualified pony came along. Ultimately, she shrugged as a decision formed in her mind."
 daring.6.a:0 "Eh, she'll do."

 daring.7.t:0 "A Surprise, To Be Sure" #podrick
 daring.7.desc:0 "The second-to-last thing that Daring Do had expected when she awoke was to find a sizable army of Lunarists just outside of her frontline outpost. The absolute last thing that she had expected was for them to raise a white flag and send an emissary out to negotiate.\n\nAfter making sure that their representative was disarmed, Daring sat down to speak with the relatively young thestral. She introduced herself as Crescent Glow, First Officer of the New Lunar Empire's southeastern theatre. She vehemently opposed the idea of serving Nightmare Moon, a sentiment she claimed that every other pony she had arrived with shared. Daring found that difficult to believe and asked for further explanation.\n\nCrescent told a story of how she and many other thestrals had been overjoyed at the return of Princess Luna years ago, of how kind and fair the Princess of the Night was compared to the tales of Nightmare Moon. They had earnestly supported Luna's attempted reforms but were perplexed as to why the Night Guard was undergoing rigorous military training. They were just as shocked and confused as everypony else when Nightmare Moon appeared once more.\n\nAs a freshly trained officer in the Night Guard, Crescent had received orders to command the Empress's forces and subdue any resistance groups in the southeast. Rather than do that, she conspired with many other like-minded Lunarists and grabbed as much equipment as they could before deserting.\n\nDaring stared at Crescent with her jaw open. "Wow. I've heard some crazy stories, but that tops almost all of them. What do you plan on doing now?"\n\n"If Princess Luna was here, she'd want us to fight Nightmare Moon.

This presented an opportunity that she couldn't afford to pass up. She summoned Good Word, Chief Maita, and Crescent Glow into her tent.\n\nThe four of them shuffled in, three of whom were wondering what the matter was. "What are you all fighting for?" Daring began, "I want to know your personal reasons, all of you."\n\nWithout hesitation, Good Word spoke up first. "I believe that Celestia will protect us so long as we have faith in her. She has watched over us for as long as Equestria has existed, and she will continue to do so as long as we follow her teachings and strive to be like her most faithful student. For these reasons, I fight in her name." His overly enthusiastic praise of Celestia garnered some raised eyebrows, but no one commented on it.\n\nAfter a moment's silence, Crescent Glow took a deep breath and said, "You've already heard my reasons, Commander, but... I think I have another reason now. Before she became Nightmare Moon again, Princess Luna spoke highly of her sister and the Elements of Harmony. Of how they once helped her in her darkest hour. It's my hope that we'll be able to bring them all together again so that they can return her to normal, hopefully for good. That is what I'm fighting for."\n\nChief Maita nodded at the thestral's insightful comment. As all eyes laid on him, he simply shrugged. "War is too noisy, too bloody. That means I must keep the foals at home. I fight so that the foals may safely play outside without disturbing my sleep."\n\nDaring stifled a chuckle, then picked up a pen. "These reasons and more are why we will win. Do you all mind if I put your words into propaganda?" Her advisors shook their heads, "Great! Once we secure control of the Southeast, we can reestablish contact with Equestria to help Celestia, help Luna, and most importantly, get some well-needed rest!""

"When we began this fight, we were just a disorganized group of scared ponies," She paused, looking out at all of the ponies who had volunteered for her cause, "But now we're much more than that! I don't see disorganized partisans, I see a full rebellion against disharmony! I don't see scared ponies, I see determined crusaders! I don't see Nightmare Moon's subjects, I see Equestrians!"\n\nThe crowd stomped their hooves and cheered as Daring Do briefly lowered her megaphone. She was surprised at how motivational speeches came naturally to her. A lot of time spent writing captivating phrases in her books seemed to help out in this regard. Maybe she really was cut out for this whole "heroic figure" thing. That thought caused her eyes to light up and her megaphone to be raised again. "There's a word for ponies who fight for a good cause against a superior foe. The moment we decided to not accept disharmony, we became that which we tell our foals about at night: Heroes.

Despite the... objectionable beliefs of the ponies in Baltimare, they seemed to have nailed the idea of governing quite well. And so, Daring Do had proclaimed that a republic would be established, complete with a parliament and elections for a president once the new capitol building was finished. The unique role of "Commander" would still retain full control of the military, but only Daring would ever hold the title.\n\nWhat Daring neglected to mention, however, was that she planned to step down once everything was set up so she could go back to adventuring and writing books. She hoped that everything would work out, as she was putting a lot of faith in the ponies of the Southeast to do the right thing.\n\nFor now, though, they had to hurry and finish building the capitol."

Namely, expanding Stableside's city hall into a building capable of governing the entire region. It was here that two of the Commander's advisors found themselves setting up desks and furniture when one of them broke the silence, "Why do some other thestrals call you a 'Celestian?'"\n\nThe question, though innocent in nature, seemed to pierce the humble earth pony. Good Word's ever-cheerful demeanor seemed to falter momentarily. "I believe it is a derogatory term used for ponies who are as... enthusiastic about Celestia as myself. You grew up in Ayacachtli, didn't you? I figured you would know."\n\nCrescent Glow nodded, turning to help her companion move a table. "Well, I was kind of sheltered growing up. I was never allowed to leave the caves as a filly," She chuckled nervously, "The first time I met ponies from the other tribes was when my parents let me go to Canterlot University."\n\n"I've always wanted to see Canterlot," Good Word sighed as they hefted the table to the other side of the room, "As for Ayacachtli, just last year, I foolishly tried to preach the lessons of Celestia and her faithful student to the Moonspeaker Conclave. They seemed to humor me, but I quickly found myself removed from the city before I could explore further. I am curious, though: Is it true that there's a giant statue of Princess Luna in the central region of the cavern?"\n\n"Yeah. I actually got to see her back when I graduated. I'll never forget it... and..." Crescent stopped. Her breathing became shaky.\n\nGood Word noticed the thestral's crumbling expression and trotted over to her. "You miss her, don't you?" Crescent nodded, trying to hide her sniffling. Good Word offered her a comforting hoof, "Hey, don't cry. Maybe there's a way we can bring her back. The Elements of Harmony did it before."\n\nCrescent gently brushed aside his hoof, "I also got to see Celestia, too. I'm not sure how, but I could tell that she had suffered while Luna was gone. I then realized that the Sun and the Moon must live together in harmony. One isn't more important than the other."\n\nThe earth pony raised an eyebrow, "I know that my preference for Celestia is obvious, but I don't discount that Luna is also important.

"So tell me, Mister Caballeron, why is it that you volunteered for... setting up an independent parliament free from executive control?"\n\n"First, it's Doctor Caballeron. Second, because the Southeast must be free from the whims of Daring Do or whoever takes her place. It must be able to stand by itself, free from others."\n\nChief Maita raised an eyebrow. "Even you?" Caballeron looked at him, and the native laughed again. "I have spoken with the tribes you worked with during the war.

Surprisingly, despite the diverse makeup of ponies representing parliament, there were scarcely any disagreements between them. Thestrals from Ayacachtli, the Neighua tribals of Tenochtitlan, members of the Friendship Lodge here in Stableside, and all other sorts were present and conversing in relative peace. Even some political figures from Baltimare held seats, though they seldom voted in favor for any motions.\n\nDaring Do sat near the back of the room as she watched the meeting unfold. Elections for a president were set to begin in a few weeks, and so she had decided to wait until then to make the announcement of her resignation. She allowed herself a smile as she saw Good Word and Crescent Glow chatting together in the corner of the room. They both seemed to enjoy the other's company, despite their differences.\n\nHer smile morphed into a frown as she spotted Doctor Caballeron speaking with a few members of parliament. What was he up to? As she was considering going over to investigate, she heard a bellow of laughter behind her; Chief Maita had garnered a decent crowd to listen to a no-doubt humorous tale, much to the annoyance of the ponies nearby who were trying to pay attention to what the speaker on stage was saying.\n\nIn time, the session began to wind down as all of the most important issues were addressed. Just as the closing remarks were given, a disheveled stallion rushed on stage. He was holding a small device that hadn't graced Stableside since the civil war began — a ham radio. He exclaimed that he had traveled a long way in order to obtain it; he returned home as fast as he could once he confirmed that it could pick up transmissions from Canterlot.\n\nThis caused quite a stir within the room, as nopony really knew what was truly going on in the rest of the continent. Sure, there were always travelers and passing vessels with the occasional rumor, but it was hard to get concrete information from the conflicting reports given by said travelers.\n\nSeveral ponies murmured as the stallion fiddled with the radio.

It was their beliefs which had run contrary to her own, and thus they were enemies on the battlefield.\n\nIn this case, however, the distaste was very much personal.\n\n"Did things not go as planned, Caballeron?" Daring asked with no small amount of satisfaction as she watched her old rival's bitterness deepen. He and his most loyal mercenaries and natives had fled following the fall of his self-proclaimed free state, seeking refuge in Stableside. That was why he was now here, pleading his case to his former arch-nemesis.\n\nCaballeron ground his teeth, trying to maintain his usual confident demeanor. "We are here because we understand that you are the best option for us now. Thus, my forces and I have decided to... to ask you for help."\n\n"What was that, Caballeron?" she asked, smirking. "Couldn't hear you there."\n\n"We need your help, Daring Do!" the adventurer finally exploded, revealing his true desperation. "Now will you help us or not?"\n\nDaring Do made a big deal of thinking it over for a minute before putting her hoof down, just to make the moment last. "Well, lucky for you, helping other ponies out is what heroes do... even if they have dubious past histories."\n\nCaballeron wisely chose to keep his mouth shut for once.

His extremely charismatic and laid-back nature had earned him a large following. Some of his support can be tied to many of the recreational and conservational policies that he wished to implement for the native populations, but mostly because of how matter-of-fact his views were: He just wants everypony's foals to grow up in a safe place.\n\nPerhaps the most shocking turn of events was the final candidate: a certain Doctor Caballeron, who seemed to have ridden his status as a "villain and rival" to Daring Do to great effect, as many fans of the Daring Do books secretly liked him more than the titular adventurer!

To show them that, in the end, there is a light in the darkness."\n\nDaring whistled, "Poetic. But there's one thing that concerns me." Good Word raised an eyebrow but said nothing. Daring continued, "Your 'community', the Friendship Lodge. They're not gonna like, force their beliefs upon other ponies, are they?"\n\nHe vehemently shook his head, "No. We're a ponytarian organization, nothing more. We help those in need, but we also want them to know how important Celestia's lessons are, as well as those of Twilight Sparkle and her friends."\n\n"I see." Daring felt somewhat reassured, though she had an inkling that there was more to Good Word that she had yet to see. "In any case, I think you'll be a great president.""

 daring_harmony.3.desc_resistance:0 ""So, how are you liking your new office?" Daring Do asked as she leaned against the door, "And your new position?"\n\nStanding across the room from Daring was the earth pony that had played a significant role in helping keep the civilian populace calm during the recent conflict. "It's certainly fancier than my office in the Lodge Headquarters," Good Word delicately touched the padded chair, the mahogany desk, and many of the other fancy decorations within the newly-furnished presidential office. "...but I don't think that I deserve this much." His eyes were cast down; a distinct gloominess emanated from him.\n\n"Always the humble one. You can redecorate if you want." Daring trotted over to Good Word and put a hoof on his back. "How are you holding up?"\n\nHe was silent for a moment, then he turned to look out the window, up to the clouds that were obscuring the sun. "There's a lot of ponies in Equestria who are suffering right now. Countless more are struggling just to make it to the next day. Not to mention how many will lose their lives before all of this is truly over." He turned back to Daring and looked her in the eyes, "I... I wanted to help teach others how much Celestia loved them. But... but I... I can't..." He seemed to be on the verge of tears.\n\nDaring Do was many things, but a counselor she was not. She bit her tongue, weighing how to best approach him. "Well... just because Celestia's not around anymore doesn't mean that her lessons have lost their importance."\n\n"Everypony in the Lodge thinks they have. We may be a ponytarian organization, but we really did love Celestia. I loved Celestia. And... she's gone. Just like that, the symbol of harmony is no more." His eyes became wet. "How can I go on when the light in the darkness has been replaced by a ruthless tyrant?"\n\n"Hey, you're one of the strongest ponies I know. You can do this, even if you think you can't." Daring glanced over to his copy of Twilight's Journal of Friendship on the table. "I seem to recall a lesson that you had said to me when we first met: 'You don't have to take on these tasks alone. You will have your friends by your side.'" She wrapped a hoof around him in encouragement, "You better remember that! We'll be here for you, no matter what!"\n\nFor the first time since he'd heard the news of what had happened to Celestia, he smiled. "Thanks. I'll do my best to keep the spirit of harmony with me.""

He sighed as he examined the padded chair, the mahogany desk, and many of the other fancy decorations that outclassed the humble decor he kept back in the Lodge Headquarters.\n\nGood Word had just gotten back from his speech after being sworn in as president. He recalled how unusual the atmosphere was, as many of the ponies who were present seemed to be more interested in hearing about how they could help the "Solar Empire" defeat her enemies rather than listening to what he had to say. His attempted segway into reaffirming the principles of friendship and harmony was even interrupted by one of the representatives that "Daybreaker" had sent in order to "assist" with their transition into becoming a "puppet state" of the "Empress."\n\nA puppet. Was that really what they were now? Good Word glanced at the portrait of Celestia hung on the wall. She was always so kind and forgiving, but the news that he kept hearing about her recent actions seemed wholly out of character for the Princess. Stories of ruthless behavior towards her sister's followers, harsh punishments for dissenters, and overly protective laws that restricted her ponies' freedom? It was too much to believe, yet the facts were in the fine print of every newspaper.\n\n"What should I do?" He asked the silent portrait. He had always thought of Celestia as the most perfect pony to ever live. It simply wasn't possible for her to become so... twisted. Surely her recent changes were just because of stress, right?\n\nCelestia's smiling portrait seemed to loom over him.\n\nI have to lead these ponies, he thought. If Celestia's most faithful student could overcome any challenge, then I shall follow in Twilight's hoofsteps - I will become Celestia's most devoted disciple.\n\nGood Word averted his eyes from the portrait, down to his copy of Twilight's Journal of Friendship on his desk. His heart burned as he recalled the lessons within that were now a stark contrast to Celestia's recent actions. He buried his head in his hooves."

The bills and other documents she was supposed to sign filled her with dread every time she read over them. One would make large, unsanctioned gatherings illegal. Another would encourage reporting suspicious individuals to the authorities. A third would criminalize "disharmonious actions", subject to the interpretation of law enforcement. All of these things seemed minor, but she could tell that it would quickly become a slippery slope until harmony itself was twisted beyond recognition.\n\nMost surprising of all, though, was the fact that she was president at all. The Solar Empire did not interfere in or contest the Southeast's decision to elect a Lunarist to lead them. Crescent recalled the recent visits she had received from imperial dignitaries, and how dismissive or outright repulsed they seemed to be by her beliefs. Celestia and her ponies had become warped, self-righteous imitations of who they used to be, and Crescent could tell that their influence would inevitably seep into the Southeast given enough time.\n\nShe thought back to Daring Do's outburst when parliament had decided to recognize Daybreaker as Celestia. She sincerely thought that the Commander would be able to convince them that they were about to abandon harmony, but it seemed that she didn't know her fellow ponies nearly as well as she thought she did.\n\nCrescent opened her desk drawer to retrieve the portrait of Luna that she had hidden in there. How kind and fair the princess of the moon was... it made it all the more heartbreaking that she was all but forgotten for Nightmare Moon.\n\nThe thestral's eyes widened as she had an idea. There was a way, just maybe, for her to preserve Luna's legacy before the poisonous beliefs of the Solar Empire spread enough to make it impossible. She fetched a pen and parchment and began to draft a motion on how best to separate the worship of Nightmare Moon from the worship of Princess Luna."

Several emissaries from the Solar Empire were now present to assist with the Southeast's transition into becoming a puppet state of the Empress. The peaceful future that the chief had looked forward to so much now seemed further away than ever.\n\nHe observed an imperial dignitary scolding a construction worker for some minor error. Harmony seemed to become more and more twisted with each passing day...\n\nEven now, several of the tribes that he had represented seemed to recognize his authority less and less as they adopted the practices of Daybreaker's followers. Maita knew that he was never the most active of leaders, but even with the powers invested in him by the public, there was very little he could do to stop the poisonous beliefs of the Solar Empire from seeping into the Southeast until its unique culture was completely gone.\n\nHe missed having Daring Do around.

"Peace," his voice strained, a touch of pain echoing through his words. Good Word noted an amputated wing.\n\nThe unicorn went next, her eyes averted. "For the Princess," she murmured so quietly that everypony had to lean forward to hear her.\n\nNext, the bat pony, a purple sheen complementing her dark fur. She looked at Good Word with eyes that battled between rage and kindness. "To prove a point," she spoke firmly.\n\nLastly, the earth pony. Behind his glasses held shifting, anxious eyes. "T-t-to help o-others," he stuttered out.\n\nSo different, Good Word thought. He couldn't help but smile. "I see. Well, there's nothing wrong with having your own reasons, but if you wish to be a part of the lodge, there is one thing you must do: Live for others as Princess Celestia does. We are like an appendage, extending her grace to the ponies of the Southeast. It doesn't matter where you come from or who you are, anypony can do this. And in each of you I sense that desire, even behind pain, adoration, anger, or fear. Despite what you believe to be your flaws, I see a chance to channel strength and love for your fellow ponies." By the end of the speech, each pony had their entire focus on Good Word, their eyes softened as their spirits subsided. Even the bat pony, whose chest contained a rage of an unknown, yet predictable origin, had tears in her eyes.\n\nGood Word smiled, then passed a set of forms to the four. "On these papers are your determined areas of work. I had hoof-picked these for all of you, and I know that you will all shine wherever you go. However, if you have any reservations, come to me, and I believe we can work something out. In the end, you're only doing what you believe is best — for both Equestria, and for Princess Celestia."\n\nThe pony turned from the four and walked down the hall, humming a familiar tune."

The Friendship Lodge always praised Celestia as the most perfect pony to ever live, and now, she was gone. The very pillar of his organization was fallible. And if she could fail, then so could he... and the Lodge... and his government could as well.\n\nHe picked up the pen on his desk and examined the document before him. As president, Good Word was allowed to pick a cabinet to assist him in matters of governance, and so he opted to pick out some ponies from the Friendship Lodge to aid him. It was a surprisingly difficult task, as in the wake of Celestia's... undoing... some members of the Lodge seemed to become radicalized, and Good Word did not believe they would be a good fit for a government position.\n\nStill, he had narrowed the list to a few individuals who seemed fit for the job. All he had to do now was sign the document, and the Lodge would officially have a place in the government. He picked up his pen. But what if his cabinet becomes radicalized too? Good Word thought to himself.\n\nHe stared at the document for some time. Everypony took the news of what happened to Equestria differently, and for him, he had a brief fit of depression. The light of harmony in Equestria was smothered by a tyrannical monster. What could he do about it? He was just an earth pony, and even then, he'd never won a fight in his life. All he was good at was talking to ponies...\n\nGood Word glanced at the portrait of Celestia he kept on his wall. Her gentle smile offered some comfort, but little material help. He thought back to what Daring Do had said to him when he took office, "We'll be here for you, no matter what!" He sniffled, then smiled as he knew his true friends would always be nearby.\n\nHe placed his pen upon the document and began to sign it.

For his own sanity, Good Word had stopped attending Lodge meetings due to how heated the arguments had become. In every session, ponies would argue about how to view Celestia's transformation. Each time, sides would be taken. Each time, Good Word did not know where he should stand. He had no idea what the Lodge would do if it were put in charge of governing the Southeast.\n\n"What is harmony?" he often asked himself nowadays. It used to be simple: Harmony was doing the right thing and protecting the innocent. But now he was faced with a choice: Did he sign away his moral compass to obey a twisted version of Celestia, or did he risk bringing her wrath down upon countless ponies? Daybreaker was asking him and the Lodge to serve her unquestioningly. The emissaries of the Solar Empire were very clear in this request, though their tone upon giving him the paperwork left no room for misinterpretation: This was a demand, and he was to comply.\n\nHe picked up the pen. This was necessary, he told himself. This was the right thing to do, he lied to himself. He glanced over to the portrait of Celestia he kept on the wall. Her smiling face offered less comfort than usual. If anything, it seemed to be judging him.\n\nHe dropped the pen, and for the first time in his life, he clasped his hooves together. "Please, please help me... I don't know what to do. I... I don't know what harmony is anymore. I can't do this..."\n\nThere was no answer. There was only the pen, the document, and the signature he needed to put on it.\n\nHe picked up the pen."

Countless words lined the page, highlighting the key differences between the Lunarists and Nightmareists. Tomorrow, she would bring this before her citizens in hopes that ignorance would no longer remain prevalent in the Equestrian Southeast. At least in government writing, she and her followers would be separate from Nightmare Moon's terror, and Chiropterrans would be alienated from the Fourth Tribe.\n\nThe pony spun her chair to the side and gazed out the window. Not a single living creature walked through the streets, and the buildings along the road emanated pure darkness from their windows. Crescent Glow raised the window, letting in the sound of the buzzing street lights and the subtle symphony of crickets. She momentarily closed her eyes and felt the embrace of the night breeze, then tilted her neck up and looked up. A full moon accompanied by a sea of stars floated before her, illuminating the sleeping city below.\n\nCrescent looked at an dimly lit picture of the former princess on her desk. "Why did you do it, my Princess?" she asked, "Why did you allow the Nightmare to take over?"\n\nShe felt tears well up in her eyes as she grit her teeth. She put her hooves together and closed her eyes. "Please come back, Princess Luna. Please, please, please," she begged, hoping her Princess would hear her words. She squeezed her hooves harder and harder until the point the appendages touched became numb. Her eyelids clamped even tighter. Her prayer, even louder.\n\nBut time passed, and no miracle occurred. Crescent opened her eyelids and looked at her hooves as they regained color. Would Luna even hear her words? Was she even conscious within the Nightmare?\n\nThe mare sighed and wiped her eyes. Though she no longer had her Princess, at least Celestia was still here. She was warm and kind, even if she didn't represent the bat ponies. Crescent chuckled as she felt a little jealous towards Good Word.\n\n"Enough of that, Crescent. You're better than that," she muttered to herself.

What reason did ponies even have to stop treating all bat ponies like Nightmareists?\n\nBiting back her tears, Crescent spun around her chair to gaze out the window, if only to clear her head. The streets were desolate, and every single building dark. She looked up, and when her eyes fell upon the night sky, she could almost pretend like things were still normal. The moon shone bright amidst a sea of stars, illuminating the dormant city below. Just like that, the tears she had so adamantly fought returned.\n\n"Why did you do it, my Princess?" she asked, turning her gaze to the dimly lit picture of Luna on her desk. "Why did you allow the Nightmare to take over?" She grit her teeth and wiped her tears, before putting her hooves together and closing her eyes. "Please come back, Princess Luna. Please, please, please," she begged, hoping her Princess would hear her words. She pressed her hooves harder and harder until the point where they touched grew numb. She squeezed her eyes shut and screamed the prayer in her mind.\n\nBut time passed, and no miracle came. Crescent opened her eyelids and watched her hooves as they regained color. Could Luna even hear her words? Could she still be conscious within the Nightmare?\n\nSighing, Crescent wiped her eyes again and steeled her resolve. She couldn't let despair get the better of her. Though she was alone now, that might not always remain the case, and though hope was meek with Luna and Celestia gone, she had to keep it alive.\n\nCrescent pulled out a new quill. She had paperwork to finish."

 daring_harmony.8.desc_solar:0 "Crescent Glow stared at the latest blank paper she had put on her desk. She managed to etch out a few words this time, but like all of her other attempts to write a second proposal to protect Luna's legacy as well as her friends and family, she just could not put together the magical set of words that would change the minds of the ponies in parliament.\n\n"The president's motion to separate the concepts of 'Lunarism' from 'Nightmareism' has been denied." The words from the speaker rung over and over in her head as she replayed today's events. Not only had they rejected her proposal, they even accused her of putting her own ponies before the "safety of the public at large." It had taken every ounce of mental fortitude for her to not shout obscenities at the speaker for such a brazen statement. The only consolation was that they had accepted her proposed pardons for some former supporters of Nightmare Moon.\n\nThe impossibility of it all loomed in front of the young president. "I can't do this." She croaked as she dropped her pen. She was well and truly alone in her goal, and the ponies who had the power to help her achieve it had no interest in doing so. Those that did had all resigned because they did not want to support a government that submitted itself to Daybreaker. Even Good Word had left, and that stung the most. She recalled begging him to stay, but the stallion was too heartbroken by Celestia's transformation to function in a government setting.\n\nThe moonlight loomed through the window. Crescent grit her teeth. When did life become so difficult?! It seemed like just yesterday that she and her friends were fighting for harmony, but harmony itself was about to change into something twisted! And there wasn't a single thing she could do to stop it!\n\nShe couldn't take this anymore. She crumpled up and threw the paper into the trash along with the dozen other ideas she had discarded. She toppled her desk to the floor, grabbed the coat rack, then threw it across the room at the smiling portrait of Celestia on the wall. She turned and looked at the moon, then screamed into the night about the unfairness of it all.\n\nLater, when the night security guards came into Crescent's office to investigate the noises, they saw naught but a wrecked room and an open window."

If there was one good thing out of all this, it's that this office chair was really comfortable, and thus made for an excellent place to nap.\n\nHe was putting off this decision for far too long now. The papers were in front of him, but only one could be signed. An uncharacteristic grimace spread across his muzzle as the options were weighted: invest the bits into the coastal towns, or set them aside for land development? At first glance, it was just a simple decision which ponies to favour, but consequences could be far more reaching than that. The former would mean ponies from Equestria would have an easier time travelling down here (unsurprisingly, few were willing to make the trek across the jungle) and thus leave some kind of investment, but the latter meant that the former tribal ponies would be happier and thus more willing to support Equestria in the future...\n\nHorseapples.

Laws had to be enacted, preparations were essential, as they were perhaps the last beacon of harmony in Equestria. All bright and noble things, yet that didn't make the idea of sending ponies away from their loved ones any easier. Oh what he would do, to just return to his humble home!\n\nHorseapples.

"Her Radiance will be most pleased with her loyal ponies returning to the fold." After some empty pleasantries, the pony left, and Maita was left to brood in his well-decorated office.\n\nThere was nothing he could do anymore. Those last words repeated in his mind, as if he were a convinced criminal about to be thrown into the deepest, most darkest dungeon. Yes, the 'loyal ponies' would be rewarded... but what about the others? Even down here, far from Canterlot, Maita heard what happens to ponies that decided to disobey Cele— Daybreaker. He tried, but couldn't understand. Where did everything go so wrong? While the tribes hardly had Celestia in their minds, it was still a distant comfort, knowing they were free to live as they pleased because of her endless benevolence.\n\nNow that same warm embrace turned into something very wrong. Dozens of scenarios ran in his mind, he even briefly fancied an idea where he would save Equestria, just as Daring Do used to tell him stories about the Elements of Harmony! Yet each met the same crushing reality: resistance was futile. Submitting was the only way the least amount of ponies would be hurt.\n\nThe mocking half-complete paperwork, which already turned his hoof sore, was left abandoned as the former Chief rose for the final time from his beloved chair. Maita had a family to attend to, and it was far more important than a meaningless position that left him with no real choices."

 daring_harmony.13.desc_harmony:0 "Prior to the war, almost all development in the Equestrian Southeast was funded from the occasional glance of Canterlot and the will of its industrialists. Some local development had sprung up here and there, but they've mostly been in a losing battle with the more prominent companies in the north. The civil war had shifted the table significantly: with most companies busy focusing on supporting one side or the other, their assets needed to be seized and split between smaller homegrown companies and the state to avoid economic collapse.\n\nWith relative peace had returned to the Equestrian Southeast, the time had come to choose how to rebuild it. We'd managed to scrape together a fair starting amount of funds, but now the Republican Congress had found itself at a crossroads in how to use it. Most points were easily agreed upon, such as improved infrastructure and the building of dams in several key rivers. Though in retrospect, such ideas were merely a way of skirting around the main issue which was now staring Tiger Eyes in the face.\n\n"With all due respect, Mister Speaker. I can not in good faith support the proposals made by the opposition." Misty Mane, a pegasus from Baltimare, barked, "His proposal will generate nothing but scraps and resentment! Nopony should be forced to slave away beneath our beautiful land; it is better that we focus on developing our industries."\n\nMisty Mane sat back down, amidst a polite wave of "Hear, hear." from her party members. Tiger silenced them with a wave of his hoof, then gestured for a pony on the opposing side of congress to present. Bit Dust, a small, grey unicorn from Portland, stood up.\n\n"I understand your concerns, though I feel you may have exaggerated the dangers of such a plan," Bit said, shrugging, "Quite simply, I do not believe we're ready for developing our own heavy industry yet. Instead, we should focus on our natural resources. By exporting them to any friendly face, either up north or across the Celestial Sea, we can use our allies' industry to develop our own at an even greater pace!"\n\nBit sat back down amidst another wave of "Hear, hear." Tiger Eyes sighed as he looked back towards Misty Mane, seeing a snarl curl up on her face. If he didn't call them all to vote now, they'd just go at each others' throats for eternity..."

 daring_harmony.13.desc_resistance:0 "After a set of worrying messages from Canterlot, we've found that most of our previous options for funding now lay in the hooves of despots. Naturally, this has limited our options for the necessary development of our new nation. What assets we could seize from the companies that pulled out of the Southeast are not anywhere near enough for the reconstruction efforts. Every house we rebuild scrapes closer to the bottom of our treasury and every repaired factory brings risks both by foreign saboteurs and by our lack of proper tooling.\n\nThe Republican Congress, by Daring Do's order, has been tasked with finding a way to invest our remaining funds. Most ideas were easily agreed upon — improving inter-city infrastructure, the building of dams in several key rivers and other similar measures. Though, in the end, such matters were simply diversions from the glaring issue which was now rearing its ugly head before Tiger Eyes.\n\n"Mister Speaker, I cannot reasonably support the proposals made by the opposition." Misty Mane, a pegasus from Baltimare barked. "His ideas won't achieve anywhere near what we need! If we place all our bets on exporting our resources, then we'll have nothing left when [3.OWNER.GetNameDef] comes knocking!

Surely you must understand the plans we propose will ensure far better results," Bit stated, sighing, "Our economy is simply not ready for us to smash through with heavy-hooved industrial plans. If we want to survive your floundering ideas and to be ready for whatever may come, then I insist that we focus on exploiting our natural resources to the fullest extent. A large factory count is lovely on paper, but if they're making guns out of scrap then they'll amount to nothing."\n\nBit calmly sat back down amidst a louder wave of "Hear, hear."

He counted himself lucky that his position as speaker of the house was still needed even despite that recent restructuring of the government.\n\nThroughout the hall, informal discussion of faith and economics dominated the gathering. Most of the conversations Tiger could ignore, at least until they came up in official proposals. The snippets he could hear were... overly friendly chatter? There were only a scarce few ponies that he recognized now; nearly all present wore clothing representative of their membership in the Friendship Lodge.\n\nIt certainly wasn't the atmosphere Tiger was used to from the congress, but he couldn't say he hated it. He watched as a senator, Misty Mane, enthusiastically debated industrial plans with a prominent Lodge member, Young Bridge. The debate was a far cry from the shouting matches Misty's debates usually became, with Misty's boisterous claims being calmly considered by the slow, yet enjoyable additions from the "Senior Lodger" as he called himself.\n\nAfter a few moments of ponywatching, Tiger signalled for the day's debates and proposals to officially begin. The portraits stared as plans and proposals were discussed and approved. Most matters were easily agreed upon, such as improving jungle infrastructure and making use of the valuable rivers, but soon came the point which had caused so many heated discussions in the congress: Where to focus?\n\nDespite his worries, the calm atmosphere from earlier still hung tightly to the congress. As Misty Mane came up to present her plans, Tiger didn't expect a shouting match over where to focus their efforts, as had happened so many times before. She gave a passionate speech about industry and the port cities which would provide the most benefits if granted funding, and waited with baited breath for the expected retorts.\n\nTo her utter shock, none came.

"Don't push your luck, Mister Dust. I'm simply here to inspect your mine. If you feel my worries are exaggerated, then surely you can prove it, right?"\n\nShe was met with a chuckle as Bit's horn lit up, lighting a nearby lantern and bringing it before her. "Of course. If you wished for a tour, then all you needed to do was ask." He walked past her, leading her down through a more active tunnel. "You didn't need to fuss about safety inspections just to visit a friend after all."\n\nThey continued to chat as the tunnel wound on, eventually depositing them in a large chasm filled with working ponies. Earth ponies made up most of the team, working with pickaxes and mechanised tools. Unicorns moved the minerals and materials to minecarts pulled by more earth ponies.

"I still think it's a bit over the top, Mist." The unicorn starts. "It's just painting a target on your flank, especially here. You do remember what happened here during the war, right?"\n\nMisty scoffed, wiping crumbs off of her muzzle. "Maybe, but any attention is good attention with business." The pegasus smirked, "Besides, if I were worried about grudges from the war then I wouldn't be loafing around with you, would I?"\n\nBit rolls his eyes with a smile. "Fair, fair. Just make sure to avoid making any new grudges, otherwise it'll be pictures of you they'll be painting over."\n\nThe pegasus looked over at him.

To her disappointment, Bit Dust, complete with a hastily written 'Temporary Secretary' badge, was still neck deep in assorted documents. The unicorn sorting through a seemingly endless pile with a blank expression, like he didn't even have the energy to frown.\n\nNow that she was close enough, Misty could hear him softly muttering to himself as he scanned everything over, though she couldn't tell if it was him reading it aloud or reciting a curse against her for dragging him into this mess.\n\n"Both." He curtly responded, looking over as he stopped moving the ferris wheel of papers. "You're mumbling again, Mist." Oh.\n\n"That makes two of us then." Misty responded, sinking further into the cushions. "Buck, this is draining. I knew it'd be hard, but this is a whole other level..." She got an affirmative grunt from Bit, who'd returned to reading papers. "I mean, we're doing good, don't get me wrong. The progress is plain to see from just a simple walk downstairs, but it feels like I haven't slept since I left Stableside."\n\nThe papers stopped for a second, and Misty could feel a blanket being pulled over her.

The old pony replied, chortling at his own joke as a smile threatened to creep onto Misty's face, only for her to catch it and return to scowling. "Though, such is the way of good ponies. Forced upon hardship to come out stronger at the other end."\n\n"Doesn't make it any less irritating. Every time I go in to get a permit, I have to deal with five armchair therapists trying to show that I'm not taking good care of my workers." Misty sighed heavily, slowing her pace. "It just hurts, Young. I've been doing what I can to help for years, and some bigger fish I met a week ago starts offloading their faulty suggestions to me, and I have to go along with them."\n\nYoung rested a hoof on her back. After a moment in silence, he nudged her. "Chin up, Miss Mane. You see those ponies, just across the street?" Misty looked up, spotting a familiarly ragged family. The youngest carefully hobbling along with a copy of the Revised Friendship Journal. She turned to Young, meeting his warm gaze. "D'they seem familiar?"\n\n"Y-yeah, that's Chip Block and his family...they've been on the streets of Baltimare for years. Chip himself is one of my employees. Why do you ask?" Young nodded in the family's direction, prompting Misty to look back. The family were looking at an apartment building, and chattering happily as Chip pulled out a key. After a brief pause, they ascended the steps and headed inside. "Wait, Chip managed to find a place to live?"\n\nYoung looked back down at her and nodded. "Yes, thanks to you." At Misty's expression, he continued. "I met his youngest earlier today. Lovely foal, she was, talked my ear off about the work her father did and the praises he'd sung of your efforts."\n\nThere was silence for a moment. "Not every foal in Equestria will be kind, Miss Mist." Young continued, despite Misty's floundering shock. "Some pass judgment unto others, when they themselves need it more." He winked. "But many will treat their fellows fairly, and such treatment will be rewarded. Be it when an age has passed, or merely when they need it most."\n\nIt took a few moments for the smile to leave Misty's face. Only when it did, did she look back at Young, his expression as kind as it always was. "...Thanks, Young."\n\n"Anytime, Miss Mane. Anytime.""

Light Narrative asked as he sat down across from [CES.GetLeader], who simply nodded. "Well, your letter was quite the surprise, I must admit. First the pardon, and now a job offer?" Light chuckled. "Not everypony treats their former enemies this way, you know?"" But then, he arched a eye, almost theatrically so. "Only... why do you think I would accept? Why do you think I would join you, when I've fought against the status quo before?"\n\n[CES.GetLeader] gave him a polite smile. "I could list off a few points, but I think you and I both know you have your reasons."\n\nLight Narrative opened his mouth, but [CES.GetLeader] was right; Light had come here fully expecting to accept the offer. His people had too much to gain from it for him to refuse. Not only would his public appearances as a military officer do wonders for the population's view of thestrals, but having thestrals follow him into [CES.GetNameDef]'s army would greatly soothe stereotypes and other prejudice. Ten or twenty years from now, ponies would tell their families, "Actually, I served with a few thestrals." What more could he ask for?\n\nLight Narrative sighed.

 daring_harmony.16.desc_resistance:0 "Light Narrative smacked his lips again before checking the letter on his table for the tenth time this morning, hoping to find a vague hint in the wording to sway his decision one way or the other. Yet again, the letter proved unhelpful.\n\nHe sighed. Daring Do wanted him to fight alongside her, even though they'd once fought each other. He and many other thestrals who had fought for Nightmare Moon had since been pardoned, but that meant little in the grand scheme of things. Then again, it made sense from her point of view. She was still fighting, and she could use the help of an experienced general, as well as that of the ponies he brought with him, even if it meant recruiting a former enemy.\n\nFor him, the choice was much harder, because accepting would always feel like he was renouncing his old ideals. He still believed in harmony, but above all, he wanted the best for his people. Winning alongside Daring Do would only mean things going back to how they had been.\n\nOr maybe not. Maybe ponies would learn from their mistakes, and finally accept thestrals as the fourth tribe? The Celestial Resistance certainly had, had it not?\n\nLight Narrative let out another sigh. And maybe it was time he faced it; even if Daring's victory were to mark a return to the status quo, her loss would undoubtedly entail worse. And besides, he'd never really liked Nightmare Moon to begin with."

But he'd been summoned, and he had every right to be here. He gulped, knocked on the door, and was soon invited in.\n\nAs Light Narrative entered the room, he found Good Word sitting at his desk, putting away papers. Taking only a brief moment to look at Light, he pointed to the seat across his desk. Light Narrative sat down, and before Good Word could speak up, he cleared his throat. "So, what is it you want?"\n\n"Was I unclear in my letter? I would like you to join Her army."\n\nLight Narrative scoffed. "Oh please, as if you'd accept a thestral into the great Daybreaker's army." He put as much venom as he dared into these words. "We both know it was just a ploy to draw me out, and I only accepted because I knew you would stop at nothing to get to me." What else would a Celestial zealot who'd even accepted to follow Daybreaker want with a thestral?\n\nGood Word put together his hooves as he looked Light Narrative in the eye. "No, Light, the offer is genuine." Light Narrative expected to see some disdain or even malice in his eyes, but, if anything, found only sympathy. "In fact, I was also considering inviting you to the Friendship Lodge."\n\n"But why?" No other words came to Light Narrative as sat there, mouth ajar, eyes wide, and brow furrowed.\n\n"We, the Friendship Lodge, oppose the purging of those who have not yet had a chance to accept Celestia's light into their hearts, and instead wish to grant them a genuine opportunity to walk the righteous path." He nodded towards Light Narrative. "A part of that is helping subdue those who reject Her truth."\n\nLight Narrative fell silent. Celestia's light, huh? Accepting that would mean renouncing everything he'd fought for before, wouldn't it? But then again... maybe not. Many thestrals, including himself, had taken a gamble with Nightmare Moon, but had never actually liked her. Fighting alongside Daybreaker's forces would at least get them into her good graces, and it would save them from a fate far worse.\n\n"If you need more time to think about my personal offer of joining the Lodge, feel free to get back to me later. However, I would like your answer on the subject of your new job today, ideally," Good Word said.\n\nLight Narrative sighed. This was for the best, wasn't it?"

 daring_harmony.17.desc_harmony:0 "Jungle Trek was bored.\n\nIt had been a reoccuring issue as of late. Usually boredom was a very rare instance in the life of a mercenary, but ever since the fall of Aztlan he hadn't exactly been doing much of that either. The loss stung particularly hard for him; despite knowing the jungles like the back of his hoof, it hadn't changed a thing. He had been forced to surrender along with the rest of his band, guilty of treason against Equestria.\n\nAt least it hadn't been the communists or the Lunarists that had won, though. Jungle and many others were surprised to find themselves still free ponies when it was all said and done, likely as a result of their former employer switching sides and negotiating on their behalf. Many had fled, taking up new jobs overseas at the first opportunity, but not Jungle. He and a few others had stuck around, with nowhere else to go. Not that there was much to do at home, though, considering that not many were hiring for illiterate mercenaries.\n\nOr at least, that was what he had thought. An old friend of his had stopped by a few days ago and told him about an offer the government was making. They wanted him — all of them back, to serve in their new army. He would even get a position as an officer, just like back in Aztlan.\n\nIt wasn't perfect, sure. Jungle was positive that there would be plenty of boring staff meetings, irritating superiors, and a smaller bit count. He'd be part of a real army, serving a real nation instead of himself. It would be the end of his mercenary days for good.\n\nBut when all he had left was more of the same old boring days?\n\nHe'd gladly take the alternative."

 daring_harmony.17.desc_resistance:0 "Jungle Trek, as befitting his name, did not like the urban Equestrian cities very much. He far preferred the deep jungles, places away from civilization and modernity. Even places like Ayacachtli and Tenochtitlan catered to him more than the artificial nature of Stableside and Baltimare.\n\nUnfortunately, Stableside was where he was needed, and thus it was where he would go.\n\nIt was a no-brainer when he got the offer from the government. A place back in the army as a general, with all the benefits it would bring? At the very least, it was certainly better than sitting around doing nothing as a self-proclaimed mercenary.\n\nIn reality, there were deeper motivations than just boredom, though. Jungle couldn't imagine Equestria, his real home, falling. It was like harmony itself was gone, clinging to life here in the forgotten jungles. Could he really still call himself an Equestrian if he didn't do something to help out? He still had a moral compass, after all.\n\nAnd plus, it was much better than the alternative. Jungle had already gotten pardoned once; he was fairly certain it wouldn't happen again.\n\nWith a deep breath, he walked into the looming administrative office, putting on the best aura of confidence he had left. "Hi," he said to the secretary, "I'm here about that position in the army I was offered a few days ago?""

Ponies were scared, and the worst part is that here, they were not sure what to be scared of.\n\nNothing had happened... yet. There had been no purge, no great cleansing in the name of the sun as some of Jungle's collegues had assumed. He was sure that he was still on a list somewhere; treason against Equestria is not forgotten so easily. But instead of being imprisoned or executed, the government was offering him a job. A position in the army, for a generous pay.\n\nWhy did they want him? Were they testing his loyalty? Would he have to order terrible crimes on their behalf? At first, he wanted to throw the offer away and push it out of his mind, but things were never that simple. If it was not him, it would just be somepony else who may not care as much as he did. At least if he took the offer, he could try to make a real difference where it mattered.\n\nAnd if they ever showed the darker side that everypony feared... well, Jungle Trek just hoped that it wouldn't come to that."

Once filled utterly with modest furnishings of a war room and remembrances of past adventures, it was now an empty husk dotted with boxes in various states of packing. She leaned further into the soft jungle wood of the table, letting her two front hoofs carry the brunt of her weight as her wings extended. They fanned out like a bird's tail, removing the stiffness built up. Hours of paperwork and delegation left her sore and spent. She'd long since grown tired of her duties, and while there were some parts of leading a nation that she enjoyed, she would not miss the bureaucracy that came with it.\n\nFinally, a chance to look at a map that isn't related to military engagements, she thought. She began to run her hoof along the map, tracing the lines and marks, each containing a precious memory, whether triumph or folly. She cherished them regardless. She began to roll the weathered parchment, cracking like butter scraped over too much bread.\n\nFrankly, Daring cared not for where she went, so long as she could leave this all behind. As much as she appreciated the respect and devotion of the ponies who served with her, she wanted to return to the days before it all, before the war—just another Daring Do adventure, maybe even one worthy of a book. As her excitement grew, she remembered that she had one last piece of official business to take care of. With stoicism, she shuffled through her bag.... pulling out a parchment, and with quill in hoof, she penned her last statement as Commander.

Though he certainly had apprehensions at first, becoming more than just a tribal chief was not entirely unpleasant. Decisions were greater, but so was the gratitude that came from them, and now he had the option to throw even grander celebrations (but only at specific occasions, he recalled Daring's scolding).\n\nStill, as he trotted back to the humble home, Maita's thoughts wondered if he would stay in this position for much longer. It's not that he was stressed, or had too much piled on his back, but rather whether he needed all this. Attention? Satisfying, but even he needed time to unwind. Bits? A few extra things he didn't have before, yes, but everything else was given to ponies that needed it more. Medals and recognition? He thanked the Sun Princess in his letter, but it was really unnecessary.\n\nAs Maita crossed the doorframe, his ears perking up at the noise his family were making welcoming him home, his gaze caught the framed photograph on the wall. There they were all together: Good Word, Daring Do, Crescent Glow, Maita himself, and even the good doctor Caballeron, though he looked as if he felt undeserving of his role in the picture. Their hooves were joined together as they celebrated the return of peace in Equestria. For while everything went to Tartarus in a brief moment, together they climbed out of it, and set the foundations for many years of stability and contentment.\n\nYes, he thought as he felt his eyes tear up, there was nothing without his dearest friends."

Yet, he'd never done it, not when his position offered him so many opportunities to speak up on such a huge stage. Daring was one mare in a sea of ponies in need; it would've been difficult to ignore their plight just for petty gain. No grand gesture of rubbing it in save for that one time; she'd went on, left on her own terms.\n\nIt was a victory: for him, for Equestria, and for her. And though she won, the hatred and the need to curse her name had also been gone for a long time.\n\nBut when Daring disappeared into those museum doors, it felt like a missed opportunity. His missed opportunity..."

The air was stale and the decor contained dust and cobwebs, as if they were the first visitors to enter in a hundred years. Eventually, the two reached a single plain door at the end of a torchlit hall. Celestia levitated her crown in front of the door, causing both to glow slightly. Celestia opened the door, then motioned for Good Word to follow her inside.\n\nUpon entering the room, Good Word was profoundly confused. The place was full of scrolls and tomes, along with various symbols and artworks styled after Princess Celestia. "What is this place?"\n\nThe princess walked to one of the tomes and dusted it off. The cover seemed to depict her hovering in front of a sun while ponies burned around her. "This is a collection of all of the religions that have been formed in my name."\n\nGood Word immediately felt a bowling ball drop in his gut as he realized why she had brought him here. "I... I don't understand."\n\nIf she knew that he knew, then she didn't show it. "There is something that you must know. Over the millennium since my sister's initial banishment, many cult followings were established in my name." She began to point at several collections in succession, "This one belonged to the 'Solarium.' That one, the 'Order of Sunlight.' The 'Daystar Temple.' 'Celestia's Children.'" She paused for effect, "There are more, of course. You will notice that none of them exist in any history books. That is because I've taken measures to ensure that none ever gained any significant following."\n\nGood Word gulped as he tried to process all of this. "But we're not a religion."\n\nCelestia nodded, "I know. This 'Friendship Lodge' of yours, while not quite a religion, is very close to becoming one. In truth, had I known about it prior to Nightmare Moon's return, I would have had it dismantled. But it is too late now." She approached Good Word and put a hoof onto his shoulder, "You must not allow your organization to worship me. I will not have a repeat of the Chiropterran 'religion', but with me instead of Nightmare Moon.""

Soon, they reached a lonely set of double doors where two of Celestia's royal guards stood at the ready. With a single nod from the princess, the guards stepped aside. Celestia seemed to hesitate when she reached the door. After a moment, she opened it and beckoned for Crescent to follow her inside. Upon stepping inside, Crescent's heart skipped a beat. She stood eyes wide with her mouth agape, "This is..."\n\n"Princess Luna's room," Celestia finished for her, "I... couldn't bring myself to come here. Not after I had failed her again."\n\nCrescent was silent as she absorbed her surroundings. This was... this was Luna's private chambers. Ornate decorations themed after aspects of the night were just about everywhere. A blanket on the bed with stars as numerous as the sky. Soft lights scattered the room, with a singular crescent shaped lamp hanging from the ceiling. A desk with a photo of the two princesses lay in the corner, illuminated by the moon through the skylight above.\n\n"I brought you here because I wanted to apologize to you, Crescent." Celestia began, earning a shocked expression from the thestral, "I... I wasn't there for my sister when she needed me most. Every hour of every day I am reminded of my failure, and the sorrow I feel will never go away." The princess turned away, ashamed of herself, "My sister tried everything she could to help her subjects see the real her. While the ponies of Equestria will never forget the rise of Nightmare Moon, because of your actions they will also never forget the Princess of the Night that they had lost. It is you who have kept the memory of the real Luna alive when we— when I failed to do so." A tear streamed down Celestia's face as she looked up towards the moon. "She would be so proud of you."\n\nCelestia's words broke Crescent. The tear-stricken thestral practically threw herself against Celestia. The princess let go of any pretense of regality and fully embraced her. The two sobbed quietly for some time as they reminisced of dreams long passed into memory."

He asked if he could enter her humble abode—a cosy, unassuming place, free from the treasure-hunting relics of yesteryears. "You don't even bother with your fake Yearling identity anymore. That makes it all the easier for me to find you."\n\n"Like I've been hiding these days. I've embraced being Daring all the time. Certainly beats hiding from you, your goons, and one of the most 'enthusiastic' number-one fans I've ever had while writing The Ring of Destiny."\n\n"And figuring out that you'd end up publishing me and my adventures from the fourth book onwards. Don't forget that I've read your tarnished propaganda!" Yet laughter echoed through the halls from the both of them, which devolved into swapping stories.\n\nAfter battling through a bout of hesitation, Caballeron coughed to fully capture her attention. "Say, Daring, it is close to lunchtime. What do you think of eating out? Together?"\n\n"Ha! Lunch? With you of all ponies? Oh, come on! You've gotta be kidding! You..." The look on his face had her wipe the jesting grin off hers. "Oh... you're serious? As you'll ever be? Wow.

 daring_adventure.0.desc:0 "Daring Do struggled to stretch her wing as she studied the old records of long-gone explorers. This cramped basement the museum called a storage room had little room for its contents, much less a medium-sized pegasus like herself. The stench of old, dilapidated papers and leather covers nearly kept her from entering in the first place, a challenge not even the testiest of ruins had presented to her.\n\nBut what was Daring Do without a challenge to conquer? The adventurer nodded to herself under the flickering, yellow light above to inspire confidence, and pointed her nose back to the task at hoof.\n\nAh, here it is, she thought with an audible gasp. "In the jungles of Tenochtitlan, I witnessed a battle between two tribes," she read along, "And though the fight seemed matched, there came a time when a shaman from one tribe came out, and strapped around her neck was an ebony horn, skinny and hollowed out. Much like I, the other tribe seemed confused, but their fighting did not cease."\n\n"Then, the shaman blew into her horn, and almost immediately I felt fearful, as did the other tribe. More than that, the other tribe grew stronger. Their reflexes, faster. I am not fully sure where such a horn came from, but my research has brought me to believe that it is an object more ancient than even Equestria itself. My colleagues laughed at me, but having experienced it, I will continue to push my theory: That horn comes from the head of an Abada. An ancient precursor unicorn."\n\n"So, Tenochtitlan?" Daring muttered with a smile as she glanced over to the map of Southeastern Equestria. She marked a circle on it and chuckled. A trip to the heart of the Neighua tribe, eh? Maybe Maita could join her..."

 daring_adventure.1.desc:0 "Tenochtitlan hasn't changed a bit, with its scorching temperatures and charming locale, but that's just what Daring liked. A little bit of stability after all that mess, and now her and Chief Maita were busily running from one end of the city to the other in search of leads.\n\n"Daring Do, you are too good to me, inviting me on one of your exciting adventures," the effort Maita had to put into keeping up with the pegasus suggested otherwise, "but I am a very busy pony now. Many depend on my guidance, and I must return to Stableside as quickly as possible."\n\nGlancing at a yet another store that dealt in old and odd goods, Daring wondered if she was chasing an old pony tale instead of something concrete, before assuaging Maita that their distraction won't take too much of his time. Unfortunately for both of them, the shopkeeper had nothing of use to divulge, with both ponies exiting and taking a seat next to the road to catch their breaths.\n\n"Excuse me, youngsters," an old voice surprised Daring as she didn't notice anypony sneaking up on them, "but did I hear you correctly back there? You are looking for an Abada horn?" In a sudden move that seemed impossible for his rotund shape, Maita rose up to greet the newcomer in their native tongue, somehow perceiving shared heritage, before engaging in a short yet energetic discussion. Daring would have said something herself, but the Chief seemed to have everything under control.\n\nJust as she was about to slink back onto the ground, the two parted, and Maita turned with a jovial expression: "We have great luck today, Daring Do! That old pony is one of the Neighua, and he recalled a particularly frightening event decades ago. He saw a pony from Tonaltzintli blowing into an ebony horn, and the sound left him shaking for days! He was reassuring me that he was no coward, to end up so frightened..." Daring tuned out from the rest of the Chief's rambling as everything he said matched up with the old texts, and concluded that any lead was better than staying here for another day."

 daring_adventure.2.desc:0 "The thrill of adventure was always about the unexpected, but what Daring encountered in Tonaltzintli left both her and Maita stumped. All the ponies simply... shunned them. This hit the Chief hard in particular. "Daring Do, I have crossed paths with many ponies, but not even thestrals were this cold to me. I must admit it is a very unwelcome feeling." He would try to comfort himself with a joke at his expense, but it rang hollow.\n\nIt didn't dissuade the legendary explorer too much, but even she had to admit that the abject refusal of most ponies to even speak with them started to grate on the nerves. Those who didn't shy away from them knew nothing as the event supposedly happened decades ago, and very few even heard of it to begin with. Seemingly defeated from this negativity, Maita suggested that they take a break at the local diner, and Daring could find little reason to say no.\n\nStuffing his face with a hay sandwich, Maita was back in his element. "Let us not despair so quickly, Daring Do! I am sure we'll find out what's going on after this excellent meal." Oh how wonderful that the Chief was already served his large order while Daring still waited on a milkshake. After a while of listening to positive encouragement interspersed with eating, the waiter finally showed up, profusely apologising and giving Daring her desired comfort.\n\nShe was about to lean back in her chair to enjoy, when her eyes caught a note folded under the cup. Looking around, everypony still seemed to avoid them, thus providing little clue to who left it there, and her hooves were quick to open it. "Maita, look." He was slow to lean over.\n\n"Daring Do,\nThis note comes from a friend. Ahuizotl was in this area recently and spread vicious lies about you and your companions. Do not treat them harshly for this. The prize that you seek is in the jungle north of the city. Follow the trail till the largest tree, then seek a large slab rising from the ground. Good luck.""

 daring_adventure.3.desc:0 "Though their provisions were adequate, Daring had underestimated just how extensive this trail was, and they frequently bickered over what constituted "the largest tree". Furthermore, Maita was obviously unused for anything more than a brisk trot for an extensive period of time, and breaks were frequently had in this dense, humid foliage.\n\nIt was all worthwhile in the end for the unmistakeably massive timber towered over its inadequate relatives, and even Maita in his sweat soaked state had to (somehow) prop up on his hindlegs to see just how far up it went. From there, it was a simple matter to locate the "slab", a tombstone that was decisively out of place within the canopy and critters. Daring had her eyes on the prize, and was quick to approach it, digging in her satchel for the collapsible shovel. It seemed too easy, and would certainly not make for a quality novel, unless Ahuizotl decided to pounce on them in the next few moments.\n\nAlas, no such interruption came, but Maita would instead read the barely legible inscription: "'Woe be unto the soul who disturbs this grave, for they shall suffer a thousand stings'. That seems... ominous. Daring Do, are you really going to desecrate a rest—" Dismissing the words as an empty threat, Daring dug into the undisturbed soil with reckless abandon. For all his warnings, even the Chief got into the adventuring spirit and helped out with his own tool, eventually striking on a decayed coffin.\n\nThe rotting lid was quickly pushed aside, and the sight of old bones unnerved the seasoned explorers. "Maita, look!" In the pony's forelegs, a horn matching the descriptions, dark and hollow, rested with its unfortunate last owner... alongside several jars with hundreds of dried insect husks. Close inspection revealed that the jars held wasps intended for grave robbers. Laughter was shared between the two as the artifact was secured, with Daring providing one last remark for the would-be trapmaker:"

Actually, on the contrary, it was a lot more peaceful after those socialist types got kicked in their flanks, and thus nopony accosted her as she trotted her way down to the pier. There she occupied her thoughts with the stallion that was about to arrive. Snap Shutter was coming back today, and he was going to share secrets about a precious artifact!\n\nSooner rather than later, a ferry would arrive from New Mareland. Mingling past all the arriving ponies, Daring tried her best locating her quarry... till she unceremoniously smacked into somepony out of her sight. "Whoa! So sorry about that, I didn't see—"\n\n"Crikey! Daring Do, it's you again! Still not done saving Equestria eh, good on ya love!" That exotic, hard to place accent could have only belonged to Snap Shutter. The pegasus got herself off the ground to properly shake hooves with her friend, beaming in this exuberant praise.\n\n"Oh come on now, Snap, it was only a part of it! Though I can't deny 'Daring Do and the Saviours Of Equestria' would make for a pretty good sequel..." She would have to save that draft for later. "So what's this about a Radiant Ruby you mentioned in the telegraph? Must be pretty awesome for you to return home!" Sparkles gleamed in her eyes, much like anytime there was thrill to be had.\n\nSnap Shutter let loose a loud guffaw, wrapping his sizeable foreleg around Daring. "Ah's like you, sheila! Let me tell you about it, this real shiny 'n fantastic thing that's gonna take a lotta hard yakka to find. It's in this place called Hayseed Junction, you probably never heard of it, but I got the map, a plan, and all that's missing is a sidekick to help me out. So whaddaya say, Daring?"

Daring wondered just how much of the taxpayers' bits did it cost, and how much went into maintenance.\n\n"Uh Snap, are you sure this is the place? It looks... abandoned." The buildings looked as if they were about to collapse, and quickly the putrid odour of a swamp invaded her muzzle. The things she did for excitement.\n\n"Nonsense, Daring, see them ponies over there!" His hoof pointed at a few hiding in those same decrepit homes, yet the question now was who would choose to willingly live here. "Now then, come along, let's have a look..." Seemingly in tune with his inner compass, Snap took long hoofsteps in a direction that made sense to him, and Daring chose to follow while hovering above. The farther they went, the ramshackled houses got fewer in number, till they chanced upon a cave in the swamp.\n\n"This the place, Snap? Are we going to have to fight somepony?" The thrill of kicking evildoer flank!\n\n"Not somepony, but a cranky marshmallow." As Snap braced himself against the ground, Daring was about to ask for elaboration as a vicious beast, in an unprecedented display of speed, lunged for the stallion!"

"It's a cragadile, Daring! Go inside and look for the Ruby while I teach this cougar a lesson not to mess with this stallion!"\n\nThough Daring dearly wanted to stay and help Snap fight this stone covered lizard, he seemed to be having a time of his life wrestling with it, punches and kicks frequently thrown against its tough hide. It didn't seem to affect the cragadile much, yet it was still unable to take a bite of its would-be prey. Alas, the cave proved to be much smaller than it seemed, and there was no brilliant mineral to be had as she rushed back in to inform Snap... when a shiny sparkle caught her eyes.\n\n"Pin it down, Snap! The Ruby is on its back!" With but a hearty bellow, Snap used his sheer earth pony strength to force the creature to eat dirt, producing a rope from Celestia-knows-where to keep its mouth shut. It took a considerable amount of effort from Daring to dislodge the gemstone from its back, all while her companion struggled to keep the thing down, and evading the cragadile's tail. "I've got it, I've got it! Let's get out of here!"\n\nSeemingly no worse for wear or exhausted in the slightest, Snap Shutter jumped off right as the beast tried to lunge after him again, galloping to whence they came with Daring hot on his trail with her wingpower.

Of course she wouldn't bring the stone out here in public, but a photograph satisfied the other pegasus nonetheless. "Sadly his way of 'doing it in the bush' didn't help us find the other Pieces of Power. We've been stuck last few weeks chasing dead ends and empty trails." But even those were lively with Snap around.\n\n"Sorry to hear about that, but I'm sure—" Suddenly Mane took a more attentive look at the picture, raising her wing to brush against her cheek. "Pieces of Power, you say? I had a... coltfriend," the single word seemingly took a great deal of effort to produce, "back in Saltlickingham, before I met Snap. When he wasn't obsessing over wild animals, he was showing me off his collection of rare jewelry. Hard to imagine a stallion with more aesthetic sense than a mare." Not that there was anything wrong with that.\n\nThough it could have been just another false lead, Daring decided to trust her gut (and the desire to actually do something instead of sitting on her flank). "It's a good as clue as any. Do you know where he lives?" An affirmative nod. "Could you take me there, then? Can't go off adventuring on my own, y'know."

At least this time the path to the front door was paved with flagstones, yet left and right of them in a slight distance were various exotic animals idly wandering around. "Like I said, my ex-coltfriend had a passion for wild beasts. Hasn't changed a single bit." Mane declined to knock on the door, waiting for Daring to catch up.\n\n"A pony has a hobby, what's wrong with that?" She'd make a couple taps with her forehoof against the wooden surface. "Haven't heard anypony complain about my obsession with adventures." Perhaps because those were genuinely enjoyable.\n\nBut before Mane could come up with an appropriate retort, the door came open with a positively handsome stallion emerging from it. Even Daring couldn't help but to admit that this earth pony was a real eye catcher. "Good evening, how may I—" His eyes widened once he realised who was standing in his porch. "Oh my, Daring Do, the great explorer! To what do I owe this pleasure? I am Darling Angel, a collector and lover of all things beautiful." Completing this perfect introduction, said Darling Angel took one of her forelegs to leave a brief kiss.

Quickly they were ushered in a living room, taking seats as Darling held up a wineglass in his hoof, tenderly swirling it.\n\n"You are too good to me, Daring, but I can't say the same for my former marefriend." Seemingly those words carried no bitterness to them. "We used to have so much fun together, I recall. Travelling, exploring, everything you know and love." A quick peek showed that Mane did not become mollified from reminiscing on their younger days. "Then I heard she found this inferior explorer to romp around with." As if to complete his mockery, Darling took a long sip of his wine while Mane looked like she was about to pounce. Recognising that her would-be hero was in fact not perfect, Daring interrupted:\n\n"Actually! We were wondering if you heard anything about an Evanescent Emerald? Your collection of gemstones was quite impressive."

I was going to use it to propose to her, yet Mane decided it was not good enough for her." Tuning out his bitter story of a broken heart, Daring observed as Mane was on the verge of losing all patience. "—it just shows you some ponies cannot be taught gratitude." What happened next came in a flash.\n\nWith unbridled fury, Mane snatched the gem out of Darling's grasp before decking him in the face with her other hoof. "Daring! WE ARE LEAVING!"

A slow, blank nod. "Would you happen to know anything about a Sequacious Sapphire?"\n\nJust as Daring was about to berate Quibble for badgering strangers, the mare found her voice. "T-the Sapphire? Of course I know it!" With surprising agility she raised a necklace bearing a shining gem from under her clothes. "I was so fond of it, I got this for my birthday, so that I could never forget its luster!" Her gaze went further askew while looking at it. Thinking that the pony was about to get distracted again, Daring repeated Quibble's question, with much more precise and louder wording. After some further digressions, they would finally get a clear answer: "I'll help you find it... but only if you deliver this here letter to my foal. I'd go up there myself, but... I can't seem to recall where exactly should I go."\n\nWith quite the self-satisfied expression, Quibble accepted the letter on their behalf and promised they would return soon."

 daring_adventure.32.desc:0 "For all his "genius", it turned out Quibble forgot to ask for the mare's and her colt's names. Quickly returning to confirm them (Sun Dew and Rain Drop), they would set out to reach the village through the hospitably named Mosquito Forest.\n\n"Ugh, Daring, this place—," Quibble paused to swat away the ever persistent mosquito horde, "—is not a forest, but a jungle. What kind of slacker gives these places wrong names?" For all his booksmarts, Quibble had very few experience in actual adventuring, and thus the insects hardly bothered her as they reached a quaint village in the jungle. There had to be a good reason why this kept happening.\n\nFortunately, its small size meant it was easy to find ponies that appeared to carry some authority. Inquiring if they knew where a 'Rain Drop' lived, the middle aged stallion had this to say: "Rain Drop, Rain Drop... Yes, I knew one. He left this village around ten years ago. Quite the shame, he was a talented cook." Swallowing a groan, Daring pressed further if he knew where did he go. "Hm. This appears rather important to you, so I'll tell you his whereabouts if you help find my filly's blanket. You see, she lost it in a camping trip recently." A pair of incredulous stares was the response he received. "It's very important to her!"\n\nQuibble, still enjoying the after-effects of mosquito affection, rose in frustration: "Who in the right mind goes camping out here?! The jungles in the Daring Do books were never this awful!" But before he could continue his tirade, Daring cut it short and agreed with the stallion's request."

 daring_adventure.33.desc:0 ""Ugh Daring, this is simply the most mediocre, boring adventure I've ever been through. Not even you could turn it into a memorable entry." Together they searched the designated camping area, yet there was nothing but the remains of a campfire. "Why can't we just buy a blanket from the store? How could you turn us proud adventurers into goffers?"\n\n"You tell me, Quibble. I thought you were in charge he—" A rustling noise interrupted her as she slowly turned in the opposite direction, seeing nothing but bushes and canopy. Ignoring Quibble's further whining, she would approach the greenery and attempt to part it open... if the vegetation didn't decide to suddenly giggle. Bouncing back in shock and surprise, Daring watched as it transformed into a changeling!\n\n"That tickles! How did you find me?" Its voice, of indeterminate gender, seemed to call from everywhere.\n\n"Changeling! RUN!" Before Quibble could gallantly run away, Daring stomped on his tail to keep him down. Further ignoring his mewling and complaining, she would ask what was... it doing here, all the way down in the Acamapichtli Jungle.\n\n"Oh... please don't tell anypony I'm here." The bug, which was revealed to be a mare, leaned one foreleg against the other. "I said some bad things about the Queen and some scary 'lings threatened me. I thought it would be best to run away, I didn't want to—"\n\n"But why HERE of all places?! Why would you want to live here in this miserable jungle!" The still panicking Quibble had some nuggets of wisdom left, and Daring couldn't help but to silently agree. Before both of them could digress further, she would ask if the changeling had seen a filly's blanket. Receiving an enthusiastic 'yes', she'd press if they could have it, but the bug declined, sharing a sob story how she lost an old family timepiece in a nearby marsh. With a distinct lack of enthusiasm, Daring and Quibble were roped into yet another merry chase."

"It's quiet, Quibble."\n\n"Oh don't you dare say it's quiet, you know what happens when you say that!" There was a distinct lack of response. "Bah, how are we going to find a timepiece out here? It's dark, dirty and my hooves are getting sore, why did I—" As if to punish Quibble for his hubris, a creature emerged from the nearby stagnant pool, tall and terrifying.\n\nInstincts hoofing in, Daring was about to grab Quibble (who was experiencing an even greater state of shock than before) in her hooves and hightail it out of here, but she caught the creature's... forelimbs rapidly shaking its hands, in a calming gesture. Wondering just what sort of escapade was about to follow, Daring looked up to the creature's masked face, waiting for it to speak... which came in the form of peculiar movements. Awkward silence followed as the creature slouched in apparent annoyance, effortlessly pulling bark from a nearby tree, before writing on it with a quill: 'I am a storm creature from lands far beyond these. What are you doing here?'\n\nThis time, Daring was tired and skipped the pleasantries, asking it directly if it saw any kind of timepiece. The storm creature was quick to jot down another reply: 'I have found one, but I will only give it to you if you find my lucky compass.' Quibble flopped on the ground in abject frustration and indignation, while she decided they were too far now to give up, asking where was the creature's keepsake. 'Just off the coastline east from here, inside a shipwreck. Follow the nearby trail.'"

It looked the perfect place to relax, yet Quibble was still not done voicing every complaint on his mind, panting as he struggled to catch his words. "Why can't we just tell the old mare we delivered the letter and spare ourselves this nonsense?"\n\n"Quibble! It's not right to take advantage of the elderly!" Even if at this point Daring wanted it very much. "Now come on, I can see the shipwreck from here." It was just a solitary mast rising from the shallow waters, but it was enough. The sea called to Daring, who very much desired to clean off, ignoring Quibble's helpful quip how he was unable to swim. If you want something done right, you had to rely on your own four hooves.\n\nThough Daring took repeated dives in the clear water, the shipwreck continued to confound her as she simply couldn't remain long enough to find the compass. Who could tell if it were even still there? Just as she was about to rise up, a hoof poked at her from behind. Oh now you decided to help, Quibble—\n\nIt was not Quibble, but a seapony! Their gazes exchanging shock, both came to the surface as the unexpected company intoned: "Looking for treasure down there, too? Sorry to crush your hopes, but there's nothing down there but metal and rust." Before Daring could deny she was treasure hunting (for once), Quibble once again loudly whined from the beach, wondering if they'll come across a lost alicorn next.\n\n"Ignore my friend. I'm looking for a compass in that shipwreck. Think you could help me out?" She still preferred working alone, but her patience was at its end. To her utmost surprise, the seapony happily agreed, diving back below as she made her way back to the coastline. That was... most unexpected. Even Quibble couldn't believe it, staying shut for a while. Soon enough, their help would return, holding the delicate instrument on his forehoof."

Did nopony try to help her? Before Daring could speak up, Sun Dew turned to face them: "Oh, you're back already?"\n\nThey couldn't recall how much time passed exactly, so the quizzical question was ignored. "We delivered the letter to Rain Drop like you asked. Can you tell us now where the Sapphire is?" More silence, until finally Sun Dew held up her necklace for them to take. "That's just a replica you bought for your birthday, remember?" Daring's attempt at being diplomatic was cut short by Quibble.\n\n"She had it this whole time! We never had to do any of that second rate adventuring!" Snatching the necklace away from her, the mare's behaviour seemed to change in an instant. Gone was the drowsy mess, and instead a cheerful tone thanked them for taking the burden away. Watching as Sun Dew trotted away, Daring could only sigh as the farce reached its end.\n\n"Come on, Quibble, let's go home." Yet no response came. Slowly looking to her side, Quibble had the same vacant look in his eyes. Oh now this was perfect. Poking with her foreleg at his side, she repeated for him to follow, and for once in this whole adventure, there was not a word from her second greatest fan."

Though he did somewhat redeem himself in the hunt for the Sapphire. Daring looked again at the precious gemstones that came to them through great effort: brilliant, shining... and utterly inert. The scrolls said placing them together would unlock their true potential, yet no amount of interaction did anything.\n\n"Have some faith in Daring, she knows her stuff. Been there myself to see it." Snap Shutter intoned positively, and Mane Allgood murmured similar sentiments to the yet-to-be-convinced Quibble, but no amount of encouragement helped her figure it out. After one too many of Quibble's smartflank remarks, Daring was done.\n\n"I've HAD it with these things! Why don't you WORK!" And just for good measure, the tabletop got a solid hoofsmack, sending the stones flying. "Oh, horsea—" But before she could reach for them, they clinked together, and with that soft sound time seemed to halt for just a brief moment. "Woah..." Even Quibble shut his snout at the sight.\n\nThe combined stones rested on Daring's hoof. They didn't seem different at all, but just holding them made her feel... powerful. Yes, as the notes said, Daring could now project her thoughts to others and subtly compel them to do her bidding... but she would successfully resist the urge to make Quibble eat paper. Turning to her companions, they joined together for a triumphal shout."

Daring shrugged, turned around, and approached the mailpony. During their brief chat, Daring casually mentioned she'd caught her just in time before she returned home to start her next book. The two shared a chuckle, and the mailpony departed.\n\nAs Daring read the page, her smile quickly faltered: somepony had stolen the Rings of Scorchero, a set of artifacts that she had retrieved a few short years ago and donated to Stableside's Museum of Exotic History — an exposition with a heavy focus on probably true myths, full to the brim with magical oddities.\n\nMiffed to see the artifacts she had worked so hard to recover stolen, grumpy to have her plans disrupted, and annoyed to have to have to make the two-hour trip back to Stableside, Daring took off.

Just to make sure, though... Are you sure the rings were actually, you know... stolen?" She certainly didn't want a repeat of last time.\n\n"Oh, I'm pretty sure!"

As Daring inspected it, she muttered, "This couldn't have been the rings' doing since we're indoors..."\n\nTin Foil opened his mouth, but Good Word silenced him with a polite smile before saying, "So somepony melted it by themselves, without getting immediately noticed...

After asking around in Stableside, the two had managed to gather vague rumors of a dragon heading east. Unfortunately, nopony was certain that the shape they saw had indeed been a dragon, and many had simply forwarded tales they had heard.\n\nThe outpost was the nearest settlement east, and given that Daring Do and Good Word had few other trails, they could only hope the ponies living here could at least partially confirm the two were on the right track. Fortunately for them, not only had most of the settlement heard of the dragon, but somepony had reportedly even seen it up close.\n\n"I think this is Swift Breeze's house," said Good Word. "At least if I am remembering the description correctly." Daring Do confirmed, and he walked up to to it and knocked. A moment later, a light pink pegasus mare opened the door. She almost closed it again when she saw Good Word's attire. "Wait, wait, wait, Ma'am, this is important!"\n\nSwift raised an eyebrow, but kept the door ajar, forcing Daring Do to stand aside to make eye contact. "We heard you've seen the dragon that —"\n\nIt only took Swift a second to recognise Daring Do, throw open her door, and take to the air, nearly knocking over Good Word in the process. "Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, are you the real Daring Do?" While her words certainly formed a complete sentence, Daring could have sworn it sounded like just a single word. "I'm such a big fan, and I..." Seeing Daring Do's raised eyebrow, Swift quieted down, rubbing her crest with a sheepish grin on her face, before clearing her throat. "Yes, I did see the dragon up close. He was pretty small. Or she, I don't really know. I was clearing the clouds when he flew by. He was carrying some shiny things, but dropped one when I called out to him. He didn't even notice when I dove for it. Just kept on flying."\n\n"Shiny things? Like... like a large ring?" Swift nodded. "Do you still have it?" Another nod, this time more enthusiastic. "And could I have it? If it is what I think it is" — Swift didn't even wait for Daring to finish her sentence, as she bolted inside, and within a moment returned with the ring in her hooves — "then it was stolen this morning."\n\nAs Daring thanked Swift and took the ring into her own hooves, Good Word took peered at it.

Daring cut a path through the shrubs and lianas, while Good Word remained behind her, on the lookout for potential danger, but mainly resting his foreleg so he could take over once Daring needed a break. Time passed especially slowly as they had to remain quiet; talking over the jungle's background noise of the jungle would most likely have drawn unwanted attention. Part of Daring dreaded having to make the trip interesting for the reader when she would eventually write about this adventure.\n\nAs they went on, they eventually spotted an unusually bright area to the side of their path. At first, they thought it a clearing, and made their way towards it — the fewer greenery they had to cut through, the better — only to find that it was no natural clearing: the canopy had been burnt away.\n\nGood Word stared wide-eyed at the scorched trees. "This has to be the doing of our dragon, don't you think?"\n\nBut Daring just furrowed her brow and and hummed. "I'm not sure... the rings shouldn't work without the complete set."\n\n"Maybe the rings simply don't work properly in such a case? How else would you explain this?" He gestured to the burnt greenery.\n\nDaring shrugged, and soon the two continued they journey. After a while, they found another burnt patch, and Daring took to the skies. When she returned, she wore a puzzled look. "I think you may be right. About what you said earlier, that is. There's a much bigger patch north of here, and lots of smaller ones. That's probably where he tried the rings, and the others are just, I dunno, offshoots."\n\nWhen the two reached the big patch, they split up to investigate. Here, the rings had burnt many trees to the ground, and a thick layer of ash covered the soil. "Daring?" Good Word called out, and waited for her to approach. "The good news is that he definitely landed here, and judging by this — " he pointed to a round imprint in the ash — "this is most likely where he stopped to assemble them."\n\n"And the bad news?"

Before Daring could take off and investigate from above, the flap of wings alerted her to a group of five small dragons, who soon landed a few meters in front of her and Good Word. "Ponies, huh?" said the apparent leader. "What are two dumb ponies doing here, huh?"\n\nDaring took a step forward. "I'm Daring Do, and I'm here for the rings.

She was no stranger to a fight, and these dragons seemed inexperienced, but five on one weren't great odds.\n\nBefore either could say anything more, Good Word stepped between the two. "Does violence truly have to be the only language you two share?" The dragon shot Daring a confused look, but she only shook her head, raised her brow, and shrugged. "The Journal of Friendship offers many solutions to such difficult problems, and the words of Princess Celestia often provide valuable context to these lessons." He smiled at the dragon, extending his hoof. "It would be my pleasure to introduce you to her teachings and her —"\n\n"Oh, no. No, no, no! We are NOT doing this!

Rainbow certainly appreciated the idea, hoping that they'll be some cider to enjoy, and not too long after, a more friendly bartender told them that the probable suspects—a mare and a stallion—left a fortune in his purse, and spent their night with a regular.\n\nFortunately that same regular happened to be nearby, and waved them over with an elegant claw. "Even far across the sea in Aquileia, Daring Do and Rainbow Dash are very famous names, though you'll forgive me if I didn't read your books."

And just like that before either of them could stop her, Solid Sale trotted out with a determined expression to exact justice.\n\nDaring was fine with justice, but less so with a potential artifact evading their hooves. "Couldn't she have at least told us where they bought a place? We can't let the Key get lost in the mess they'll create." The annoyed expression was complete by running a forehoof over her face.\n\n"You mean, this bill of sale for a house on Lotus Isle, bought by a mare and stallion?" Ever the nosy pony, Rainbow raised a paper from the stack left over by the realtor."

"There was nopony here before us, the front door was open, and they just left the Key out here?" Rainbow Dash continued to be disappointed with this adventure's excitement.\n\n"Not every adventure is for the books, Dash." But just as Daring was about to reach for the artifact, her companion thought the same, resulting in a tangled mess of forehooves that swept aside the lingering trash as they fell to the floor, with shattering sounds of broken glasses echoing in the silent home. Daring could only snort in annoyance as a mumbled 'horseapples' came from behind.\n\nFleeing from the crime scene with the Key secured, Daring still had hope in Celestia's luck following them, until a magical bolt blasted the wall in front of her! Rearing on her hindlegs in a primal display of fear, she saw in the distance: two horns, lit up and presumably aiming for them. "How could you miss! Those ruffians were sitting ducks!" A shrill voice of a mare rose in the darkness.\n\n"I'd like to see you do better!" Another one, a deep hoarse kind belonging to a stallion, retorted to her partner. Then came twice as many bolts aimed straight for her head.\n\n"Run, Dash, RUN!" If it was difficult already finding their way in here, it was twice as bad trying to recall their way out, all while being chased by murderous thieves, but instinct and adrenaline made their work. Fortunately, there was plenty of tacky sculptures, ugly furniture and even kitschy decorations to throw on the floor, and for each came another shriek of anger. Daring had to admit it felt better than kicking their flanks: thieves only cared for bits and they were losing them rapidly.\n\n"I've gotta hoof it to you, Daring," Dash took a pause in hurling insults for their pursuers, "this is the most fun we've had this whole time!" She turned to give one last taunt to the angry couple, "In your face, losers!" As they finally made their way out of the accursed maze of a manor, Daring made a note to skip on taking Rainbow for the next adventure."

The sunset spelled the beginning of another long work night, one that she did not look forward to. Her briefcase of paperwork laid on the seat next to her, reminding her that she did not have much time to relax. Fortunately for the tired thestral, the door to the café jingled, and a familiar face walked inside.\n\nDaring Do took off her signature hat and waved it at her friend. "Hey, Crescent! Didn't expect to see you here; I thought you'd be home by now."\n\nCrescent smiled, though the fatigue on her was clearly visible. "Hey Daring, I'm just taking a break. I gotta head back to work soon." Crescent took a sip from her coffee cup, and when Daring inquired further, she sighed, "I've just... not had much free time. Every day has been like this recently, and I'm just exhausted."\n\nDaring sat down across the table from Crescent. "Why don't you take a few days off, then? You deserve a vacation more than anypony."\n\nCrescent opened her mouth to reply, but the café barista nearby spoke up first. "You could go to the circus! Barn Run's Festival of Spectacle is in Gallopfrey!"\n\n"Oh wow, I've heard about them," Daring remarked with amazement in her eyes, "They travel all around the world. They're in Gallopfrey right now?"\n\n"Just outside of it, actually! They've got arcane magic tricks, acrobatics, exotic animal acts, and there's even this new act that everypony's been talking about: a mysterious cloth that makes you disappear! No hidden walls, no trapdoors, and no help from unicorns either! It's got everypony mind-boggled!"\n\nCrescent listened intently as the barista went on about the circus. She *was* tired of working so much, and she *could* ask her aide to handle things for a bit... and Daring seemed enthralled by the prospect of seeing it for herself. "Hey Daring?

Daring Do and Crescent Glow found themselves at the city's edge, though, as the venue—a huge park gushing with fountains galore—was nearly empty. The only ponies left were the clean-up crew, and the only signs of the circus ever being there was a positively staggering amount of litter from what must have been quite the crowd. Daring was understandably disappointed, but Crescent seemed hopeful that they might be able to find out where the circus went as she asked one of the ponies for help.\n\n"Oh, you just missed it," said one of the ponies cleaning up litter, "They had to leave early, even packed up their show all of a sudden. Some act went wrong."\n\nCrescent turned her head. "What do you mean?"\n\n"It was really strange. Barn Run's Spectacle of Festival has always had a lot of interesting performances, but they were showing off this new one: the Silver Shawl vanishing act. You know how magicians use boxes or doors to fake the disappearing? Not this one. Anypony wearing the shawl became completely invisible behind the slightest bit of shade. I didn't quite see what happened, but somepony got injured real bad while throwing the shawl around, and it spooked the animals too. Things kinda went haywire and the ringmaster decided to stop the whole thing."\n\nDaring sagged at first, but the mention of the mysterious shawl piqued her interest. "Do you at least know where they're performing next?"\n\nThe worker scratched his chin, "I think they traveled up toward some town in the Hughills? I don't know if they'll stay long though, or even if they're performing again so quickly. Better get a move on if you wanna catch them, though.""

It didn't take much searching for Daring Do and Crescent Glow to learn that the Festival of Spectacle had already packed up and left this place, too. Only a few stray tents remained as any sign that the Barn Run's circus was there in the first place. "Okay, this is getting annoying," Daring groused to nopony in particular, "Where's the circus?!"\n\n"Ayacachtli!" a squeaky voice resounded from a nearby tent. Daring and Crescent exchanged glances, then entered the tent to find a unicorn laying on a medical bed. An acrobat by the looks of her leotard. Welts and stitches marred her figure. She noted the duo's looks of concern. "Oh, don't worry, I'm fine! You can call me Fig. Figgy the Flexy... ta-da!" Her attempt to cheer herself up dissolved and her true feelings showed themselves with an anxious sigh. "Barn Run's headed there to try and recoup some of the losses from refunding tickets here and in Gallopfrey. I was hoping to go too, but..." She gestured to her injuries, "Accidents happen."\n\nCrescent seemed to take the news in stride. "Well, if we don't see them there, Daring, I could always show you around my home!"\n\n"I might take you up on that offer." Daring turned to face the injured unicorn, a different thought on her mind. "Now, Figgy. Did something happen here, too?"\n\nFiggy's demeanor darkened. "Yeah... during the Silver Shawl act. It was supposed to be the grand finale. Every performer would return to the stage, and then we'd throw the shawl around like a hot potato. We'd disappear, then reappear in turn as the lights strategically turned off to leave the shawl-holder in the shadows. My friend Corkscrew passed it to me, and I was high up on a balancing wire. Corky didn't throw it back immediately—I should've known something was off. She threw the shawl at me a few seconds late, and it was only when I caught it that I saw how spooked she looked. Then I heard... well, not voices, not exactly. It was like something was watching me, and I... I lost concentration, and..."

The rest of the circus was clearly not here, so Daring decided to peek into one of the tents to try and find out why. That turned out to be a mistake, as the first thing Daring saw upon poking her head between the tent flaps was a glistening set of eight huge eyes, two sharp fangs, and gigantic chelicerae mere inches behind a set of metal bars.\n\n"SPIDERS!" Daring Do screamed as she recoiled in utter horror. The entire village's thestral population winced at her voice-cracked cry. The brave adventurer proceeded to stumble backward in a blind panic, all the while shouting, "WHY DID IT HAVE TO BE SPIDERS?!"\n\nCrescent Glow rolled her eyes amid the scant few chuckles of those who'd witnessed the occurrence. Shortly afterward, a disheveled-looking griffon exited the tent. He introduced himself as Serif, the "Exotic Animal Handler" of the Festival of Spectacle, and assured the two that the giant spiders encaged within the tent were "perfectly harmless" as they were acquired in the Eygsic Forest in Deponya, where they lived in peaceful harmony with the ponies there. Daring did not feel comforted by this information, as she could have sworn that one of the spiders hissed at her just now.\n\n"No, don't," ordered Serif. The tank-sized spiders backed off at his imposing glare, though only slightly. Serif sighed as he turned to address the duo. "Sorry about that. They've been acting up lately. Cookie and Muffin weren't always like this... I don't know why they've stopped being nice to strangers! They used to let little colts and fillies ride them, but now..." He sullenly looked at the oversized arachnids, "The past few nights have been terrible! They got grumpy, lost their smiles, refused to cooperate, and Cookie even went after one member of the audience! Barn Run asked me to use the shawl to 'take care of them' if you know what I mean, but I couldn't bring myself to!"\n\nCrescent asked what he meant by "taking care of them." Serif sighed as he longingly stared at his eight-legged friends, "Well, the shawl makes things disappear, you know. Sometimes, they don't come back."\n\n"That's... thank you, Serif." Daring turned to Crescent, "I'm starting to think that this 'Silver Shawl' is more than just a piece of clothing." Any further comments were halted by the sound of festivities beginning from inside the cavern city."

 daring_adventure.64.desc:0 "The districts of Ayacachtli were a sight to behold, as the central cavern was so vast and open that many residences were carved out of the mountainside; some were only accessible via flight! At the central area of the cavern was a gigantic statue of Princess Luna, and at the base of the statue were roughly a hundred circus performers executing precise movements and maneuvers to impress the sizable crowd of thestrals watching them as fantastical music and lights dazzled the city.\n\nDaring and Crescent opted to fly high above the crowd and perched atop one of the many balconies along the upper walls. When they first left Stableside, they only wanted to relax and watch the circus. Now any joy they would have felt was soured by what they had learned about the ringmaster and his apparent malice from utilizing a cursed artifact in his performance.\n\nFor several minutes the duo waited for a prime opportunity to swoop in and nab the Silver Shawl, but there was no sign of it anywhere. Eventually, the current act reached its end, and a grandiose-looking stallion, presumably Barn Run himself, appeared with the spotlights trained on him. He removed his top hat and bowed before the audience, then announced that the next act would be their greatest yet. He produced a fine cloth from his suit and presented it as the Silver Shawl, then demonstrated its power by donning it and stepping beneath a nearby wooden platform. The moment he set hoof under it, he vanished, much to the amazement of the thestrals watching.\n\nExcited whispers from the audience turned into confused murmuring, as the ringmaster did not reappear. One of the circus performers ran over to where their employer had vanished, but before they crossed even half of the distance, Barn Run's bloodcurdling scream resounded throughout the cavern; far, far louder than any pony could reasonably produce.\n\nThe effect on the audience was immediate: panic and terror cascaded through the crowd as Barn Run's unholy scream reverberated all around them. Countless thestrals took to the skies and fled as the entire city descended into chaos. The high-pitched cries of the thestrals gave Daring a massive headache, so Crescent took this opportunity to fly down to where Barn Run had disappeared. Sure enough, the shawl was on the ground, and there was no sign of the ringmaster to be seen. She carefully scooped it up and placed it into her bag, then returned to Daring so they could depart the city before things got any worse."

She'd just come back from her wild adventures, but was already pleasantly surprised that the relics she had collected were being put to good use.\n\nHer ears perked when they caught two familiar voices. They were arguing, but that didn't stop the spring in her step as she turned the corner, finding Chief Maita and Doctor Caballeron.\n\n"If we do nothing," said Caballeron, "he might use the talisman on one of us. Worse yet, with the way ponies talk about it, if he use that thing — even on a minor authority — it will cause an uprising!"\n\n"I'm well aware, Doctor," replied Maita, his usually calm voice just as frustrated as Caballeron's, "but we can't act too rashly. Ahuizotl already has caught far too many Neighua in his web of lies, and they might turn on us if we try anything we haven't properly thought through."\n\nDaring had heard enough and finally decided to interrupt. "So lemme get this straight." Both Caballeron and Maita turned to her. "Ahuizotl's trying to rile up the Neighua, and he wants to use some kind of relic on somepony important?"\n\nCaballeron nodded. "If the rumors are true, yes, and I believe we should do something right now." At Daring's raised eyebrow, he added, "I have a lead."\n\nDaring glanced over at Maita, who immediately shook his head. "I'm very sorry, Daring, but I don't have the time to go on an adventure right now."\n\n"I, on the other hoof, could spare the time," said Caballeron. "Especially since my contact already knows me." His expression soured. "Although... I would understand if you would rather not want my help."\n\nDaring opened her mouth, but the ball in the pit of her stomach shut her up. She had almost declined, but was that really the right thing to do? And why? Because of his past? How long would she continue to hold that against him? How long would she let their previous misgivings cloud her judgment? She swallowed her pride and forced a smile."

They did not have to say anything, because the mare noticed them, trotted over to the boat, and dropped off the planks, before cantering over to the two. "General! I mean, uh, Doctor Caballeron. It's good to see you again. What brings you and Daring Do of all ponies to my workshop?"\n\n"Hello, Crafty. I would like to claim I am visiting purely out of interest for my former subordinates, but I have another, more pressing reason to be here: as you might have heard, Ahuizotl has been causing trouble, and Daring here and I are trying to track him down. Do you perhaps still remember the location of his last base of operations?"\n\nCrafty nodded. "This is old news — outdated, probably — but it used to be somewhere southwest of Tenochtitlan." She gesture to the back of her shop. "I can write down some instructions for reaching it, if you want." Caballeron affirmed, and the mare disappeared to fetch writing supplies.\n\nWhile they waited, Daring, brow furrowed, asked, "Can I ask how you ended up with a contact like this? Somepony who, what, used to work for him?"\n\n"Oh, when I was leading the Neighua and the mercenary companies, I did my best to keep a close eye on individuals that might cause problems later on. One of them was Ahuizotl."\n\n"Huh. I should have figured. You were always pretty resourceful."

"Oh, that is unexpected," muttered Caballeron. "You didn't pack an inflatable boat perhaps, did you? I don't think we can swim in that."\n\nDaring shook her head. "Cave looks tall enough to fly, so if I was alone, it wouldn't be a problem." The solution came to her immediately, but she pretended to think for a moment, furrowing her brow. "I guess we could hide our bags outside, and I could carry you in." She shrugged. "Hopefully it's not too long of a flight." \n\nWhen Daring picked up Caballeron, an awkward silence hung over them, but much to Daring's — and Caballeron's — relief, the grotto soon made a turn, revealing a large dry open space, with a few passages leading out. It was deserted and mostly empty, save for some ragged curtains lining the walls and a few scattered tools and supplies.\n\nAfter setting down Caballeron, Daring took a short moment to catch her breath. "Looks like your informant was right on pretty much all accounts." Caballeron just nodded. "Split up and look for clues?" Another nod.\n\nIt came to pass that Daring searched the right side, and Caballeron the left. For a while, luck seemed against her, as none of the left-behind trash was of any use to her. Eventually, a torn curtain caught her eye. Or rather, what was behind it: a tapestry.\n\nThe tapestry itself was of little interest — it depicted a fairly common Sun-worship ritual — but it told her these caves had once been home to the Neighua. Her experience as archaeologist insisted that, if there was one tapestry, there had to be others, and at least one of them had to have some kind of new information.\n\nAfter she checked behind a few more curtains, her gut feeling proved correct: one tapestry depicted several ponies gathered around another pony holding some kind of artifact. The central pony's eyes glowed while a golden mist escaped his or her mouth.\n\n"Daring? I have found something," said Caballeron as he cantered up to her, only to stare with her at the tapestry. "Is that... some kind of ritual?" Daring nodded. "That... that cannot be good."\n\nShe grimaced. "Yeah, it looks like Ahuizotl's upping the stakes."

A moment later, though, the attacker received a taste of her own medicine as Caballeron tackled her, pinning her to the muddy ground.\n\nDaring took a step back and shouted at the mare, "Who are you? Do you work for Ahuizotl?" The stranger tried to wriggle out, but Caballeron's earth pony strength rendered her endeavors fruitless. After significant effort, Daring and Caballeron managed to wrangle the aggressive pegasus into a restrained position ripe for interrogation.\n\n"So," said Daring, "what is Ahuizotl up to?" As the mare remained quiet, Daring added, "We will keep you tied up as long as we need."\n\nThe mare scrunched up her face, grumbling. "He wants to expose you." Daring raised an eyebrow. "What?

Daring stared for a moment, brow furrowed and mouth ajar, before shaking her head. "Nevermind. Just tell me where he is."\n\nThe mare tensed up as if to lunge, but one glance at Caballeron and at her restraints convinced her otherwise. "I'll tell you exactly where, but only because he's expecting you anyway!" She glared down Daring, who may even have recoiled, if not for her years of experience. "He's waiting for you in an abandoned mine in the Scale Mountains! You'll know which one."\n\n"A trap?" suggested Caballeron, and Daring nodded. However..."

I think we have no reason to be enemies, as weird as that is to admit."\n\nAhuizotl slowly nodded. "I... suppose you are right. But I am a guardian, and I am supposed to guard the artifacts.

Even Quibble Pants, annoying as he was, had been convinced to shut up long enough for Daring's acceptance of her position to be made official.\n\n"...and finally, do you swear to uphold harmony above all, and to relinquish your power the moment victory is achieved?"\n\n"I swear."\n\nEverypony present cheered and stomped their hooves on the ground in approval. Daring smiled and waved at them as their new flag was raised behind her. Though she knew that she was the best pony for the job, she silently wished that Equestria still existed. That the burden of leadership hadn't fallen to her. That she could return to the small-scale adventures she longed for. But seeing her friends and everypony else filled with hope in the face of the overwhelming odds against them, well...\n\nDaring looked up behind her to the flag that now proudly waved in the wind. It was a last-minute design by somepony who thought to replace the alicorns with the elements of harmony, and they even threw in Daring's cutie mark despite her protests. It was a symbol, much like she was now. It made her think that, despite the dark days ahead of them, she might just lead them to their happy ending. She closed her eyes, took a deep breath, then turned to the crowd again and leaped into the air with one hoof raised triumphantly."

 daring_resistance.19.desc:0 "Once, a ragtag resistance movement. Now, liberators of Equestria!\n\nSo thought Ocean Breeze while listening to the radio broadcast, from her little seaside cottage in Portland. She never thought just how much Equestria would change in the past years, with all the misery and destruction that followed, yet the spirit of ponies prevailed and successfully preserved what made them strong. Not to mention how it opened her eyes to what Ocean previously had no idea existed.\n\nFirst came the surprise to learn that Daring Do was a real pony, not just a fictional character! And she helped save them all! And those jungle ponies, previously only dismissed as savages and brutes, turned out to be very amicable and welcoming. Even those Friendship Lodge types were tolerable, with Ocean Breeze frequently humming one of those catchy songs.\n\nAbsentmindedly turning off the radio with her wing, Ocean hopped onto her hooves. To celebrate the occasion, her town was throwing an impromptu party, the likes of which Pinkie Pie would express her wholehearted approval, and after everything that happened, there was no doubt everypony deserved their quaint little happily ever after."

Her departure was surprisingly smooth, as she had firmly established the procedures for how our new government was to be run. While we wish her the best, our top priority now is to hold new elections for our next president. The only difference now is that it this is not for our ragtag resistance movement, but for Equestria itself.\n\nFirst is our current sitting president: Good Word. He has proven himself a capable civilian leader, having implemented countless economic reforms and aid packages for those who have suffered in recent years. Both he and the Friendship Lodge have risen beyond their purported obsession with Celestia to show Equestria that, more than anything, they are dedicated to helping others.\n\nNext is a famous politician of the Fillydelphia Republic: Cirrus Cloud, the "Thunderous Tubthumper" herself. An Equestrian patriot at heart, she has rallied countless ponies from her home to fight for harmony, causing endless frustrations for Nightmare Moon and others who sought to exploit the common pony. She has proven herself to be a very capable leader, one that seeks to push Equestria into a prosperous future.\n\nOne of the more surprising candidates is Sunset Shimmer, a former pupil to Princess Celestia. While she did return to help fight for Equestria, she was devastated by the defeat of the stalwart titan of a nation much like everypony else was. During the wars, she worked mostly from within enemy territory, sowing discontent and planting the seeds of hope for liberation. Now she seeks to do good as a proper leader, rather than a guerilla fighter.\n\nLastly is the most unusual candidate of all: Quibble Pants. A self-proclaimed "advisor" to Daring Do, despite her never appointing him to any official position. While anypony would tell you that he is incredibly annoying to listen to, they would also begrudgingly admit that he is usually right... sometimes. He is very adamant that he would be perfect to succeed Daring Do, as he has stated that his qualifications include "multiple corrections of Daring's biggest mistakes" as well as authoring "thirty different fanfictions, only seventeen of which include me."\n\nThese new elections proved to be incredibly heated, but in the end, only one candidate emerged victorious..."

 daring_resistance.21.desc:0 ""Did you see how cool Daring Do was? She kicked all of them bad flanks out of here!" Rainbow Dash was quite in her element, and Twilight couldn't help but smile and nod along to this ceaseless gushing. It reminded her of simpler days when she recommended the series in the first place, back when everything seemed just right. And even though friendship and harmony were saved in the end, Twilight still harboured a great deal of self-doubt, wondering if she could have prevented all this at any point in time.\n\n"—anyway, Daring was going to ask you if you'd become the next Princess, since there's nopony else who'd fit for the role." The abrupt statement brought Twilight out of her reminiscing (and self-deprecation). Her? The Princess of Equestria? Sometimes she liked to imagine receiving that honour from Celestia, but now... Now ponies have shown that they don't need alicorn princesses doing all the hard decisions for them. With a heavy sigh, she raised her muzzle to look at the pegasus properly. Hope and embarrassment were equally divided in Rainbow's expression.\n\n"I'm sorry, Rainbow Dash, but I don't think I can live up to Celestia's example. After everything, how can I trust myself not to let ponies down?" With winds taken out of Dash's wings, Twilight felt another tinge of pain at letting her friends down. "But what I can do is promise to be around and help anypony in need. I'm sure there's still plenty of use for my magic."\n\nThis mellowed her enough to resume floating off the ground, and just like nothing happened, Rainbow Dash continued indulging in another display of hero worship, as if nothing happened a moment before."

 daring_resistance.22.desc:0 "Crescent Glow and her staff looked over the documents laid before them. It was only supposed to be a minor investigation, but one lead led to another, and then...\n\nThe war room's central table practically overflowed with evidence to the point that Crescent now had irrefutable proof that Chiropterra had directed a secret program known as "Project Moonshine." It was clear that the primary goal of that project was to destabilize Equestria leading up to the Equestrian Civil War. Countless resources had been poured into all sorts of areas to sabotage industries and increase racial tensions. Most curiously, however, a significant number of sleeper agents had been activated and redirected toward Manehattan's central square just before the civil war broke out.\n\n"But what was Chiropterra doing in Manehattan?" One stallion asked. Crescent wracked her brain. The city was strategically important, yes, but to pour this much effort into one specific part of the city surely meant that—\n\nTime seemed to freeze as the realization struck Crescent. It was them. They caused the explosion at Princess Luna's speech. They... they almost killed her. They were willing to risk KILLING Luna if it meant a chance at turning her into Nightmare Moon again.\n\nAny doubt in her mind about the Chiropterrans was gone now. They were absolutely irredeemable monsters. And they had the gall to call themselves Lunarists.\n\nCrescent's lieutenants became worried when they noticed that she was staring wide-eyed at the evidence on the table. "General? Are you okay?"\n\nHer response, though delayed, was unnaturally calm. "Do we still have one of the ponies responsible for this in custody?"\n\n"Yes, one confirmed sleeper agent - a female thestral. She's currently being held in a local jail cell."\n\nCrescent turned to leave, barely concealing the unbridled rage she felt toward the pariah state."

 daring_resistance.23.desc:0 ""YOU RUINED HER!"\n\n"We freed her. You just won't accept our Goddess for who she really is."\n\nCrescent Glow was about to burst a blood vessel. When she had received a report that a spy was captured attempting to sabotage her efforts to deradicalize the thestrals, she wanted to personally interrogate the mare. What had begun as a polite conversation quickly turned into a one-sided shouting match as Crescent learned that the pony sitting before her was not actually a local, but instead an agent from Chiropterra who had helped in turning Luna back into Nightmare Moon. The mare didn't even try to hide it; she seemed proud of herself.\n\n"She was the Goddess of the Night, not Nightmares! Almost a decade of rehabilitation was wasted because of YOU!" Crescent furiously jabbed a hoof into the spy's chest, knocking her and her chair to the ground.\n\nThe mare remained smug. "Luna was a false goddess. A prison made by Celestia and her 'elements of harmony' in order to keep her weak and subservient. Any servant of the night can see that Nightmare Moon is our true goddess."\n\nCrescent felt a tooth crack from how hard she was clenching her teeth. She descended upon the mare and furiously pounded the spy's face with her hooves. "LUNA! WAS! MY! GODDESS!" She screamed as tears began to form in her eyes. "SHE WAS EVERYTHING TO ME! AND YOU TOOK HER AWAY!"\n\nThe mare opened her mouth for another rebuttal but quickly was met with another rage-filled hoof to the face. Fortunately for both Crescent's temper and the mare's skull, the door to the interrogation room swung open and several ponies flooded in to restrain Crescent.\n\n"General Glow!" one of the guards said as they pulled her away from the Chiropterran thestral, "Calm down! You can't assault prisoners like that!" Despite their numbers, they struggled to keep their superior officer away from the now-bleeding mare. It was only when one guard put her into a chokehold did she begin to come to her senses.\n\nAfter calming down, Crescent was released. One of the guards asked if she was okay, but she shook her head. "No. This pony and her kind have poisoned us for generations." She glanced back at the pony who had caused irreprable harm to Equestria, to Luna, and to her. "Contact Commander Daring...""

The only thing that gave her pause was her best friend. Good Word stood just outside Daring's office, firmly barring the way despite knowing Crescent could easily brush past him.\n\n"Crescent, stop. We need to talk about this. You can't just murder all of the Chiropterrans."\n\nShe glared at him. "It won't be murder. It will be justice."\n\n"We can bring those responsible for turning Luna into Nightmare Moon to justice without killing everypony in Chiropterra."\n\n"I don't care. They're evil, every single one of them. I want them all dead."\n\nGood Word's steadfast expression faltered at her comment. "Genocide is not going to bring her back."\n\n"And letting that terrorist state continue to exist will?"\n\nGood Word placed his hoof on her shoulder, "Crescent, please... this isn't right. You know that this won't make things better. You KNOW that. We can make them pay without executing them all."\n\nShe nearly pushed her way past him, but the desperation in his voice gave her pause. "...What alternative do we have?"\n\n"We can teach them the truth about the horrible things they have done. It might take decades, but we can change them like you've helped change Lunarist culture here in Equestria." He gave her a half-hearted smile, "Or... or we could prove to them that we're stronger than the Equestria of old. That we don't have to fight them, because nopony, not cultists, not the changelings, not even rogue alicorns can stand up to us when we work together."

Statues and emblems of Celestia and her cutie mark had either been defaced or entirely destroyed, and in some places the remaining pieces had yet to be cleared. Perhaps it was his imagination, but it seemed many of the city's important hallmarks were missing from its skyline.\n\nThough Canterlot was not fully secured, he had insisted on seeing what had befallen the city he so desperately wanted to visit as a colt. Good Word tightly clutched his Journal of Friendship as he walked through the streets, past the occasional barely washed-out bloodstain and the many ruined buildings. Traversing the once-bustling metropolis saddened him beyond belief, but there was a second emotion beneath it, gnawing at his heart. Good Word turned a street corner. Disbelief, maybe? Disappointment? He did not know. He did not know what he felt, and he did not know how this could have happened. It seemed... impossible. How could Princess Celestia let this happen? She was supposed to protect her ponies.\n\nHe pushed the thought out of his head as he continued towards the palace. Though he knew he would regret looking, he carried on, because he had to see it. When it finally came into view, the knot in his gut tightened as he approached the main gate. What spires had survived were covered in bullet holes. The world-famous garden had been trampled and burned, and its decorations ravaged. Canterlot had well and truly fallen. Gulping, he marched on.\n\nNo guards stood outside the throne room. When he entered, he slumped to the ground as the knot fell into the pit of his stomach. The two statues by the entrance had been reduced to rubble, and nearly every stained glass window had been shattered. But he had expected that. He had not expected the throne itself to have been smashed, its golden pieces strewn across the white marble floor. Celestia had well and truly fallen.\n\nEven Celestia could fail." # Etyco
 daring_resistance.25.desc_daybreaker:0 "While the liberation of Canterlot was a momentous occasion in Daring Do's quest to restore Equestria, nopony could have expected what became of the city after Celestia's transformation into Daybreaker. Statues and emblems of Celestia and her cutie mark were replaced with fiery symbols and twisted idols that seemed to radiate heat. The welcoming, majestic architecture had been demolished and rebuilt with sacral designs.\n\nThough it had been some time since the city was reclaimed, the ravages of war still remained. Some areas and buildings contained Solarist holdouts, while ruins and the occasional bloodstain were present elsewhere.\n\nGood Word tightly clutched his Journal of Friendship as he trotted through the streets. While Canterlot was not fully secured, he knew he had to see what had befallen the city he so desperately wanted to visit as a colt. Merely traversing the once-bustling metropolis made him uncomfortable. What really sent chills down his spine, however, were the looming temples bearing the imagery of Daybreaker.\n\nHe stopped outside one such temple. It was mostly intact, though the symbol of the Solar Empire was cracked above the front entrance. He hesitated as he approached the door. He had to know what these ponies were like. He had to know just how misplaced his own faith in Celestia was.\n\nThe inside of the temple contained a deathly silence that seemed to reverberate louder than artillery fire. A stained-glass image of Daybreaker above the central altar illuminated the red and golden decor. Toppled pews and religious tapestry were strewn about. What caught his eye was a dried trail of blood leading into one of the rear chambers.\n\nAgainst his better judgment, Good Word followed the trail. His heart sank as he found a corpse — a soldier of the Solar Empire. The pony was young, likely not even twenty. It seemed like they had been mortally injured and crawled across the ground to a statue of Daybreaker. Their front hooves were clasped together before the figure, almost as if they had desperately prayed for help from the goddess that had commanded them to die in her name.\n\nEvery second he spent staring at the soldier, Good Word felt more and more sick. He fell to his knees as he contemplated his entire life. How he had spent years in service of a pony that had abandoned everything that he believed in? What might have befallen him if he had been in Canterlot instead of Stableside when Celestia had transformed? Would he have found the strength to do the right thing? Or might he have joined her?

Rolling out of bed, he headed for the restroom to brush his teeth, mane, and coat, but when he saw himself in the mirror, he paused. How much had he slept recently? Not enough, given the bags under his eyes.\n\nGood Word sighed, picking up his toothbrush. Maybe tonight he would be tired enough to overcome the seemingly endless supply of thoughts, doubts, and questions that lately kept him up well into the night. Probably not, but he had to hold onto something to push through the day, to push through another day of inconsequential paperwork, of forced smiles for unimportant officials, of speeches he barely believed in.\n\nHe didn't want to. He knew he had to, but with each day since his visit to Canterlot, it only grew harder to press on. Would it really be so bad if he skipped just one day? If he had somepony fill in for him? He shook his head. Of course it would. Princess Celestia wouldn't dodge her duties like that.\n\nBut Celestia had failed; even somepony as grand as her could fall short.

Good Word knew that some members of the Friendship Lodge had trouble accepting that Celestia had spurned harmony, but this... he glared at the photos on his desk that were taken as a part of an investigation into several missing ponies.\n\nSeveral Moonspeakers from Ayacachtli had been strung up and burned in ritualistic pyres, and the culprits behind these heinous acts were former members of the Friendship Lodge. One photo contained a clear image of a pony he knew personally, Fiery Brimstone, wearing a red and golden robe taken from one of the Solar Empire's many temples.\n\nGood Word sat back in his chair and tried not to think about anything. Yet he found himself looking over to the transcript of the interrogation with the murderers. They seemed to cherry-pick messages from the Journal of Friendship and twist them to fit their worldview. Most did not see their actions as immoral, and some even went so far as to claim that they were doing the right thing by "protecting their friends" via "cleansing the souls of sinners."\n\n"How can I preach about friendship if others can twist it into something so vile?" He wondered aloud.\n\nThrough the corner of his eye, Celestia's smiling portrait continued to judge him.\n\nIt was all too much. Everything was wrong, everything he believed in was a lie, and it was his own faith that caused those poor ponies to suffer. He leaped from his chair and tore down the portrait from the wall. He snapped it into two and hurled it across the room, cracking the outside window in the process. He toppled the bookshelves, upheaved his desk, smashed every light, then finally curled up into a ball as he spiraled further and further into despair." #Podrick

"If someone as grand as her can screw it up, what chance do us normal ponies have?"\n\nCrescent carefully considered her next words, extending a wing over his withers.

It looked like a tornado had torn it apart; it was difficult to see anything due to the broken lights. "Are you in here?" she asked as she carefully stepped inside. Her ears perked up at the faint sound of sobbing. She made her way over to the noise, only to see her friend huddled in the corner behind a toppled bookshelf.\n\n"Go away."

Rumor had it that this was one of many spots where Nightmare Moon's supporters took off a thousand years ago to bide their time for revenge. Fitting that the tarnished side of their legacy would end here.\n\nEarth ponies, pegasi, unicorns, and a notable number of thestrals had arrived. Though a few wore suits and uniforms, many Chiropterrans hadn't exactly been big shots in their local politics scene. A grand number had strode into the event with rather casual clothes and rather blank slates—like they once did with a Lord or Lady Commander, they looked up to this new pith-helmeted liberator.\n\n"The old Chiropterra is defeated, but that's the easy part. It's harder to rebuild, much harder when you think these ponies could never ever change from the 'nightmares' they used to be. But the average pony there? They had no idea the legions were doing half the tragedies we'd found out. So, I say we move onward. The elements of harmony can appear in many different ways, and in Chiropterra, its light can shine a new color: we won't see each other as just four equal tribes but as friends until the very end, and like friends, we'll help each other up. Carrot Stick, may you do the honours?"\n\nA modestly dressed thestral stood up, introducing himself as the interim head of Chiropterra. Against wartime tales of "bats" haunting them in their sleep and at every corner, Carrot exuded a soft yet warm demeanour, greeting with and meeting everyone in a spirit of optimism. No doubt they'd get to know more of him and the fate of a new Chiropterra over the coming years..."

Little did he know, his break would be short-lived, as the bench he had just picked out was already occupied. "Daring Do," he said, "it is... certainly a surprise to find you here."\n\nDaring had somehow not noticed him until then, and turned to him, furrowing her brow. "Good... evening, Caballeron."\n\n"Did I surprise you, Miss Do? It is unlike you to let your guard down. Are you perhaps getting old?" Daring merely shook her head as she looked away, too lost in her thoughts to pay him any heed, leaving Caballeron to blink at her for a few moments. "Should I be aware of anything that may have happened?"\n\n"Little more than a bout of contemplative melancholy, as can happen to anypony."\n\n"Must be rather serious, for you to talk like a third rate novellist."

"At any rate, if it is serious, I would rather know, as I dislike unfortunate surprises."\n\nDaring sighed. "It isn't, but if you must know, I've just been stuck pondering the fate of the two sisters." When she finally looked at him again, her eyes utterly lacked their usual fire. She had neither the patience for him, nor any desire to play games. "Like how they both ultimately just wanted the best for Equestria, but couldn't agree how, and how it tore them apart." Another sigh. "And worse, Equestria itself is now lost because of it." After a short silence, she shrugged. "Like I said, it's nothing important. I only told you so you'd get off my case." Or maybe she just wanted to get it off her mind; not even she knew.\n\nCaballeron just nodded for a while as they sat there, leaving Daring more and more confused. What was he playing at? Was he— "Now that you mention it, it reminds me of us. Or rather, how we could have ended up. We could have let our differences become our demise, but we haven't, and for that I am grateful."\n\nDaring could only nod.

Like any moment now I'll wake up and we'll still be fighting to restore harmony to Equestria."\n\nGood Word and Crescent Glow sat side by side on a bench outside Stableside's capitol. Just an hour ago, they'd received news that the last enemy holdouts had surrendered and that the fighting was well and truly over. Equestria was whole again, and no threat to her remained. Elsewhere, the celebrations had already broken out - which they did plan on joining - but for now, they simply stared off into the distant sea.\n\n"How long has it been?"\n\nThere was a brief silence. "Feels like an eternity."\n\n"No, since we met."\n\nThey looked at one another. The sun was beginning to set. Perhaps something clicked between them, as they didn't break eye contact. For a few long seconds, they stared into one another's eyes, each trying to ascertain what the other was thinking.\n\n"I think it's-"\n\n"Do you wanna-"\n\nThey stopped. Then, they worked up their courage. Each reached out a hoof to the other, culminating in a light hoofhold.\n\n"Would you like to go out sometime?"\n\nThis time, there were tears.

Though that cramp persisted in its annoyance.\n\nFor Daring Do, home was blissfully left how it was, even if nopony stopped to clean it for a while. But who cares about that, when there was Equestria to save? It was worth all the blood, sweat, and tears, and the amount of danger she got herself into easily eclipsed any of her past adventures.\n\nSpeaking of those...\n\nThat old writing table was just as inviting in more peaceful days. Brushing away the accumulated dust with a wing, Daring took a seat, and pulled forward the beloved typewriter. Most of her books were written from it, and now she could create one that would be unmatched in its quality of detail and events, with one crucial difference compared to the rest.\n\nLeaning her face to a forehoof, Daring recalled all the ponies who helped her along the way. Good Word had overcome his obsession with Celestia and put harmony first. Crescent Glow didn't give into her anger toward the Chiropterrans. Chief Maita had sacrificed much of his time with his family to ensure their safety. And even Caballeron had proven to have a good heart beneath his stupid face, his stupid hair, and... she suddenly found herself blushing as she imagined the fine details of his jawline. Putting that bothersome thought aside, the most important part was that it was a team effort, and with that the first words were put down.\n\n'Well, this isn't quite the story I envisioned telling, but here I am...'"

It had gotten to the point that she did not notice when familiar faces entered her war room, but even then...\n\n"Excuse me, Hello?" An exasperated Quibble Pants waved his foreleg in front of Daring's face. She was about to shout at him to stop bothering her, but he continued speaking too quickly. "When are we gonna finish this up? I need to get home to my wife; she's expecting soon, and I'll need to take her and our daughter to the hospital."\n\nDaring's reflexive yell was rudely halted before it began by her entire viewpoint on Quibble being shattered. "I'm sorry, could you repeat that? Like, all of that? Slowly?"\n\nQuibble groaned in annoyance, "I said, I need to get home and be with my wife so I can take her and our daughter, well, technically my stepdaughter, to the hospital-"\n\n"I don't believe you." Daring stared intently at Quibble. He sighed, then produced a photograph from his pocket and offered it to Daring Do. She scoffed at him and grabbed it, but then her eyes went wide with shock when she looked at it. Everything else faded away as she absorbed the reality of what was in that photo: an insufferably smug-looking Quibble Pants with his foreleg hung around a very pregnant mare, and next to both of them was a relatively young filly. Daring must have been staring at the photo for some time, as Quibble gently pried it from her hoof to put it back into his pocket. Daring shoved her entire face toward the stallion, confounded beyond all measure. "How in the world did you—YOU OF ALL PONIES—manage to convince a mare to live with you?! AND TO HAVE A KID WITH YOU?!"\n\nQuibble Pants rolled his eyes, clearly unamused by Daring's behavior. "Well, unlike you, I know how to talk to ponies of the opposite gender. I mean, come on, you can't even hold a conversation with me or Caballeron."\n\n"But I don't..." Daring seemed to enter a trance.

 daring_solar.1.desc:0 "Following the burning of the capitol building, the ponies of the Friendship Lodge mulled on how the recently-deceased parliament had just certified them as official members of the government... and now, it seemed they were the *only* remaining members of the government. On top of that, they still needed to figure out how to properly integrate the Southeast into the Solar Empire. Unfortunately, both of these issues fell to the wayside the moment the topic of Celestia's transformation came up, as it often did nowadays.\n\n"Celestia is perfect! We should strive to be like her, no matter what form she takes!"\n\n"I don't know, something about this Daybreaker makes me shiver. She doesn't feel like the Celestia we know and love."\n\nThe debate soon turned into a heated argument, then into a shouting match just short of a brawl as ponies began to take sides. Accusations of treachery and conspiracy were flung back and forth; it seemed like a schism in the Friendship Lodge would have formed right then and there were it not for a new arrival whose entrance shocked all present into reverent silence.\n\n"Brothers and sisters," the familiar-looking earth pony gently shut the door shut behind him, "This is unbecoming of Celestia's most faithful," Covered in bandages from head to hoof, the once ever-cheerful Good Word now seemed to emit an aura of righteous fervor as he made his way to the podium. "Do you not remember our first statute? 'Thou shalt love Celestia with all thy heart, all thy might, mind, and strength, and in Her name we shall serve Her until our last breath.'"\n\nHis voice carried a commanding tone that washed away the doubts of most of the ponies present. Still, a few were still unconvinced. "But what if Celestia's transformation is akin to Luna's? This doesn't feel right!"\n\nGood Word's gaze seemed to bore into their very souls. "Need I also remind you of one of the most important lessons in the Friendship Journal? 'Never judge a book by its cover. And a good friend, like a good book, will last forever.' Celestia may look different, but it is still Her. She will always protect us, so long as we are faithful to Her." He pointed to the exit, "If you disagree with anything that I have said, then I invite you to resign immediately."\n\nThe ponies present looked at each other, but this time with comfort instead of frustration now that their president sounded more like a prophet."

 daring_solar.2.t:0 "The Lodge's Transformation" #podrick
 daring_solar.2.desc:0 "While previously the Friendship Lodge was always a loosely connected ponytarian network devoted to preaching about Celestia, the advent of her transformation combined with the spiritual rebirth of Good Word seemed to trigger a sudden change in the entire organization. Gone were any doubts about Celestia's status as a divine figure. Good Word had rapidly become a rallying leader even more so than Daring Do was, for how could he have survived such an inferno if he was not personally blessed by Celestia?\n\nAs news of Good Word's survival spread throughout the southeast, the Friendship Lodge's membership had practically skyrocketed. Almost a hundred thousand ponies from all walks of life had signed up just within a week; some because they believed that Celestia could do no wrong, while others saw the "Burned Stallion" as a sorely needed voice to guide them in these tumultuous times.\n\nAnd guide them he would.\n\nThe first changes were subtle: A few Lodge-aligned amendments were made to the fledgling republic's constitution. Funds were set aside to construct additional Lodges. Lodgers were installed in parliament to replace those who had died in the inferno.\n\nTo any outside observer, especially the most devout Lunarists in Ayacachtli, it looked like the beginnings of a cult takeover. They began to take measures to protect themselves from being purged, but no attempt at removing the thestrals ever came. The missionaries from the Friendship Lodge continued to make their humble journeys to proselytize, the only difference being a spark in their eyes that wasn't there before. They spoke of Good Word almost as if he was equal in status to Twilight Sparkle, if not more so. As if Celestia had personally granted him that status."

 daring_solar.3.desc:0 "Outside of government affairs, the changes were gradual. More and more ponies attended Friendship Lodge services. Ponies already spoke highly of Celestia, but now they made snide remarks to those who did not praise her. Phrases such as "We love Celestia" became "We worship Celestia."\n\nLunarist holdouts became worried. What was going on? Many of them were terrified that something big was about to happen, especially as the weeks went on, but nopony had come for them yet. Still, they continued to turn away the Friendship Lodge's missionaries, nonviolently of course, in hopes that they would be left alone.\n\nStrangely enough, despite all of the official missives coming in from the Solar Empire, the ponies of the southeast did not refer to the Goddess as Daybreaker, instead choosing to continue calling her Celestia. Their reasons varied, though the most consistent answers given were as thus: "Celestia will always be our Goddess, no matter what form she takes."\n\nPerhaps most surprising of all was the number of Lodges that had appeared in the wake of Good Word's return. Before they had scattered the land with only a few in each major city, now there were dozens in almost every town, with some even having over a hundred. The weekly services of the Friendship Lodge saw more and more ponies adopting their beliefs, with some places having so many attending these services that businesses were forced to close on those days."

It was clear by her enthusiastic chant and sudden halting of it that she expected others to join in with her. From the frightened glances of the chained thestrals to the concerned expression of the jury, all eyes were on her.\n\n"This is not the faith that we teach," Good Word stood from the seat where he was overseeing the verdict. His gaze seemed to bore holes into the mare. "While the sinners on trial today have committed heinous crimes against myself and our Goddess, they are only that: sinners. Are thestrals inherently sinners? If you believe the answer to that is anything but no, then I weep for you. I weep for you as I weep for those who reject Celestia's light."\n\nThe mare seemed to backpedal a bit. "Well, I didn't mean it like that, but come on, they're bats! You know they're never going to-"\n\nThe sound of a gunshot pierced the ears of all in the courtroom. There were brief gasps of shock as all present realized that Good Word had just executed the mare.\n\nRaising his pistol into the air, Good Word addressed all of the ponies before him, "Heed my words: That mare held a deep-seated hatred for all thestrals within her. It clouded her judgment and would have led to unjustified acts of violence against bat ponies. Let it be known that all are equal in the eyes of the Goddess, regardless of heritage, regardless of status, and regardless of race." He set his pistol down, then returned to his seat. "If any other members of the Friendship Lodge hold similar sentiments to this heretic, know they shall suffer the same fate." Naught but silence followed his statement. With a nod, Good Word turned to address the thestrals who had trapped him in the capitol fire, "'Guilty', was it? Perhaps punishment is in order for you all...""

 daring_solar.13.desc:0 "Ever since the founding of Equestria, the grand city of Tenochtitlan has been a premier tourist destination for ponies all around the country. The Neighua tribe who built the city were a curious sort — while most of them had adopted modern technology and other Equestrian customs, many went out of their way to preserve their culture's traditions and unique architecture, often to the point of frustration with regional authorities.\n\nThese frustrations only intensified after the Friendship Lodge became the de facto government of the Equestrian Southeast. New rules and laws were passed throughout the land, many of which conflicted with the Neighua tribe's beliefs. However, persistent visits by Lodge missionaries persuaded a significant chunk of the Neighua to let go of their old ways.\n\nUnfortunately, they did not persuade all of them. Tensions between those who clung to their traditions and those who adopted Lodge customs skyrocketed in the recent weeks after a particularly divisive law was enacted. It seemed like the constant heated arguments in the streets might descend into outright chaos any day now.\n\nFriendship Lodge authorities were understandably worried that a riot was imminent. They began to theorize several ideas to calm the populace but were shocked when the prophet volunteered to travel to the city himself. Some attempted to reason with him, saying that it was not safe, but Good Word was not dissuaded. He would bring peace to Tenochtitlan with Celestia as his witness."
 daring_solar.13.a:0 "And it came to pass that Good Word traveled to Tenochtitlan..."

 daring_solar.1300.t:0 "Unity In All Things" #daring_solar.13 - Good Word talks to natives part 2
 daring_solar.1300.desc:0 "The central area of Tenochtitlan was by many accounts "a page out of a history book." The ancient teocalli, similar in structure to Maregyptian pyramids, were a sight to behold, but they were currently closed due to the unrest. As the mobs protested one another, a single earth pony began to ascend the steps of the teocalli. He listened to the two sides as he went — many were upset about being forced to obey the new laws that infringed upon their ancient traditions, while others were frustrated that those traditionalists would get them in trouble with the Friendship Lodge and the Solar Empire.\n\nUpon reaching the top of the structure, Good Word raised his gun and fired it into the air, silencing most of the crowd. He saw countless heads turn towards him, some annoyed, some curious. Nevertheless, he immediately began to speak before their attention returned to one another.\n\n"I was once unsure of who I wanted to be when I was young. I held so much self-doubt that it took my father's death to push me out of the comfort zone of my indecision. I chose to embrace the Friendship Lodge, for their lessons of unity and goodwill in the name of Celestia brought joy to my heart. I sorely needed that joy, as the insecurity in my soul constantly resurfaced whenever I was not helping others.\n\n"But the Lodge alone could not save me from the disharmony in my heart. I sought others to help me," he briefly hesitated, as he was reminded of his friends who were no longer with him, "They taught me an important lesson — that contention with one another is a poison that rots the soul and destroys our bonds."\n\nGood Word's voice rose as he replaced the gun in his hoof with his scripture, "I stand before you not as a preacher, not as a prophet, but as a beggar. Disharmony is not the path we should walk. We should not be contentious with one another, but we should look forward with one eye, having one faith, with our hearts knit together in unity and love towards one another!" He paused for emphasis. "The day will come when Celestia will judge us all. Until then, we must honor Her laws and start others along the path of salvation. Should you disregard my words and seek to disrupt the unity we seek, know this: You shall not succeed. All trials and tribulations can be overcome, for our faith renders us invincible!"\n\nThe sun began to rise behind him as he spoke his final words. Whether it was immaculate timing or divine intervention, none knew. "And this I say unto you: if you wish to join the path of righteousness, step forward, and be forever blessed by Celestia!""

 daring_solar.14.desc:0 "It had been a long day of arguing between the various ponies inside the recently constructed parliament wing of the capitol. There had been quite the political upheaval once they had realized how much they had to change their fledgling republic's laws to be in line with the Solar Empire's, and they seemed to exhaust themselves debating the fine details and how to best implement them. The most contested topic was the recently-passed proposal to grant several positions of authority to the Friendship Lodge.\n\nPerhaps it was because of their meticulous focus on legal matters that they seemed to be unaware that the various entry and exit points of the building had been boarded up and sealed. Only when the smoke alarms triggered did the various politicians begrudgingly begin to leave their seats. Unfortunately for them, the emergency exits didn't budge. A few opened the rear doors to the rest of the building, causing searing heat and smoke to billow in.\n\nWith that smoke came a wave of panic as ponies screamed and ran over each other trying to find a way out. Their efforts to escape were for naught, however, as whoever had blocked the exits from the outside had done a thorough job to ensure that nopony could escape.\n\nThe fire rose, and their hearts became filled with despair. One stallion even knelt in prayer, but in the end, the fire consumed him as well.\n\n---\n\nIt wasn't until after emergency services had finally managed to put out the fires that destroyed the capitol building did the full extent of the death toll become apparent: There were no survivors. In one day, the entire governing body of [CES.GetNameDef] died in a blazing inferno."

It was quite difficult to track her down, but thankfully we were left hints of her whereabouts by a "Quibble Pants", whose subtle and no doubt intentionally noticeable hoofprints throughout the jungle ensured that we were able to find the two of them.\n\nUnfortunately, upon finding the two atop one of the numerous temples in the Southeast, our search party overheard Daring Do speaking of looking for a way to take down "Daybreaker and her brainwashed cultists." We were thus forced to apprehend her. She denied any involvement in the burning of the capitol, but her comments alone warranted keeping her in custody for now.\n\nFollowing the capture of the Commander, we received a missive from the Solar Empire congratulating us on "doing the right thing" in regards to not allowing dissent from anyone, including our leaders. Additionally, the Empress issued a statement recognizing Quibble Pants' devotion to "rooting out traitors" and awarded him a medal for his efforts."

She'd been thrown into prison after questioning, and he was waiting for them to do the same thing to him.\n\n"Do you believe that Celestia watches over us?"\n\n"That's the same question as the first one!" Quibble shouted in exasperation, "Yes!"\n\nThe two ponies looked at one another again, then nodded. "All right, Mr. Pants, welcome to the Friendship Lodge.

"The only thing I understand is that you keep justifying your actions. What next? Are you going to forbid nonmembers from opening businesses out of fear that they'll gain too much influence? Are you going to ban gatherings that don't include Lodge members? It's a slippery slope, and soon you'll be banning things like basic utilities or food and water to ponies who don't want to join the Lodge."\n\nThere was silence between them for some time.

Seated in the rear of one of the Friendship Lodge's weekly congregations, they were the only bat ponies present. The only Lunarists present. Cricket was apphrensive the moment they had set hoof into the Lodge, having only shown up out of obligation from the kind acts of the missionaries. His wife and foals were equally on edge; it didn't help that their dark, moon-themed clothing made them stand out like a sore hoof.\n\nIn stark contrast, the members of the Friendship Lodge all wore neat, tidy, and simple outfits with a Celestia pin on them. A few approached the family to welcome them, and some even offered to sit with them and guide them through the proceedings. Cricket didn't want to come off as rude, but thankfully his wife took the initiative to politely decline any offers for company.\n\nThe sermon they had expected turned out not to be a sermon at all, but instead a brief speech from a Senior Lodger who affirmed her faith in Celestia's perfection. She then invited the congregation to share their "Thoughts and Testimonies" and left the pulpit open for any to approach it.\n\nOver the next hour, roughly a dozen ponies of all kinds stepped forward to speak of how impactful the Friendship Lodge has been on their life, how much more confident they've become since devoting themselves to Celestia, and how blessed they are to have a living goddess to look up to. Truthfully, Cricket found himself paying more attention to the clock than to the speakers, but the last pony to step up immediately caught his attention: It was his squadmate, a pegasus who served alongside him at the beginning of the Lunar Civil War.\n\nCricket was utterly transfixed on the stallion who had once sworn his life to serve Nightmare Moon. A stallion who was dead set on becoming a Moonspeaker. A stallion who had gagged at the mention of Celestia's name. A stallion who was now crying tears of joy while speaking of how wrong he was in the past and how thankful he was for the Friendship Lodge's forgiveness, even when he had spent years fighting against Celestia.\n\nWhen the service was over, Cricket Chirp felt a new sensation in his heart: Desire.

She said that he had started on the path to redemption, but he was struggling to abandon his old ways. She said that she was forced to leave him and take her foals with her so that she could accept Celestia's light. That she found a new husband. That they've never been happier.\n\nDespite the circumstances with her family and his being very different, he found himself tightly gripping his wife's hoof.

Countless Lunarists had fought to the bitter end rather than surrender, and Good Word's forces had to cut down many whom they would have rather taken as prisoners. Some colts and fillies had even taken up the weapons of their deceased parents to exact revenge, leading to even more suffering when they fired upon their conquerors. Still, at the end of it all, Chiropterra fell.\n\nWhen Good Word and his missionaries arrived at the impromptu prison camp that his forces had set up, the worst offenders had already been lined up to await his judgment. A few dozen soldiers, an officer, and three young ones no older than twelve. "What are their crimes?" he asked his subordinate. Rather than answering, the mare gave a hastily written paper with a large number of heinous actions written on it. "Murder. Heresy. Slavery. Torture. Mutilation. False surrender," he paused to look at the youngest ponies present, "Use of child soldiers." He threw the paper aside. "There are more, of course. However, the Friendship Lodge handles prisoners differently. You will be offered the opportunity to abandon your wicked faith and to atone for your sins. If you decline... you cannot say that we didn't offer you salvation."\n\nGood Word nodded at the missionaries and the guards to begin working with their captives to see who could be saved. Shortly after, a shrill battle cry of a young filly interrupted them. Said filly proceeded to retrieve a hidden pistol and shoot two missionaries before she was restrained by a nearby guard.\n\nThe bandaged earth pony briefly closed his eyes. So this was how it would be, he thought. He approached the young filly who was being held to the ground. With one hoof, he brought forth his holy scripture and began to read from it. 'Yea, they who do not hearken unto Celestia's teachings shall seek to take away thy life. And behold, it is better that one wicked pony should perish than that a nation should dwindle and perish in unbelief.' He closed his book and drew his gun. The filly's fierce defiance immediately evaporated as Good Word pointed his weapon at her.\n\nFor how long Good Word held his gun steady, he could not say. The expression in the young filly's eyes... it reminded him of something. It wasn't evil that guided this poor soul, it was fear. This foal was terrified of those she had been taught to hate, and she lashed out in the only way she knew how: violence. "Hmph," Good Word lowered his weapon, "Righteous as this killing might be, it would solve nothing. You have fallen, but there is a road to forgiveness for you still. But first..."

Some attempted to plead, and some even said they would repent, but not convincingly enough to prove to their executioner that they were telling the truth.\n\nAs the body count rose, a few of Good Word's subordinates briefly glanced at one another in shock. Not because of the violence, but because not a single Lunarist had genuinely renounced their wicked religion. Didn't they understand that their false goddess had brought them to ruin?\n\nEventually, there were but only a few ponies left in the line: high-ranking refugees from the Lunar Empire and the short-lived Disciples of the Night. Still, they had sought aid from their kin and thus were brought before Good Word to be judged. Said earth pony raised his gun at the next in line.

 daring_solar.26.desc:0 "Just recently, an official emissary of [CES.GetNameDef] arrived in Canterlot to petition the Empress regarding their desire to punish Chiropterra for their crimes against the Empire. While they showed the utmost respect for the Empress and her staff, they seemed to be filled with great reverence, more so than the majority of her subjects in the Empire at large.\n\nTheir request was simple, but not inconsequential: They wished for a percentage of the Solar Empire's navy to be transferred to the Southeast for use in helping the Empress' light "shine over the sea."\n\nWhile Daybreaker did plan to make Chiropterra suffer, she was still busy consolidating her control over Equus. Perhaps an investment into her most devoted subjects could pay dividends... they could deliver the Lunarist holdout to her on a silver platter. Although parting with that many ships might prove disastrous if her enemies took advantage of her split navy.\n\nIn the end, she had a choice to make."
 daring_solar.26.a:0 ""Very well. They may have those ships."" #Here's a massive fleet
 daring_solar.26.b:0 ""No. If they wish to please me, then they must do so without my help."" #Send some well wishes and kind regards with political power

 daring_solar.27.desc:0 "Good Word allowed himself a smile as he read the message from Canterlot. The Empress had granted his request to transfer a portion of the Empire's fleet to his control.\n\nThe only caveat was that she had made it clear that she wanted the Southeast to deliver Chiropterra to her on a silver platter. Not that he wasn't already planning on doing exactly that.\n\nThe bandaged earth pony set the letter down as he picked up the telephone to call his naval officers. There would of course be paperwork to fill out, but he thought it best to give them the good news first." #1 carrier, 2 battleships, 2 heavy cruisers, 2 light cruisers, 8 destroyers

 daring_solar.28.desc:0 ""Your request for a portion of the Empress' Imperial Navy to be transferred to your command has been denied."\n\nGood Word reread the letter in front of him once again. Surely there was a hidden meaning to this. Celestia wouldn't just reject his request without a good reason... right? He furrowed his brow. Perhaps She required the full strength of Her navy for more immediate threats. Or perhaps...\n\nA wave of clarity overcame the earth pony as he set down the paper. Of course Celestia did not want the Friendship Lodge to utilize Her navy. She wanted Her most faithful subjects to prove themselves worthy without Her help.\n\n"She is testing us," He mused. He glanced at his portrait of Celestia on the wall. Her gentle smile was reassuring, though it offered little material help. Good Word briefly closed his eyes in thought. If the Friendship Lodge was to destroy the Lunarist holdout in Chiropterra, then they would need to redouble their efforts to construct a mighty navy.\n\nWith newfound resolve, he picked up the telephone and dialed his shipwrights."

 daring_solar.29.desc:0 "There was a knock at the door. "Good Word? Do you have a minute?" Crescent Glow asked as she peered inside.\n\nThe bandaged earth pony looked up from his desk. "Yes, of course. Come in."\n\nCrescent entered the office of the pony she once thought she knew so well. There was a distinct aura of piety in the room — various trinkets and decorations themed after the Solar Empire adorned the office. They contrasted heavily with the smiling portrait of Celestia that hung on the wall to the side, which itself contrasted even more heavily with the loaded pistol that lay next to the paperwork on Good Word's desk. She looked up from the gun to see that he had noticed her staring at it. "Are you all right, Crescent? You seem troubled."\n\n"Yeah..." she began. Crescent had a plan about what she wanted to say to him, but her thoughts became muddled by the countless what-ifs that might happen if she were to speak her mind. She gulped. "I wanted to... to see how you were doing."\n\n"I am well, thank you for asking." Good Word said. His eyes lacked the friendliness that they used to have, she noticed. "But I don't think that's why you are here. Do not be afraid, you may speak your mind freely."\n\nCrescent nodded, then took a deep breath. "Are we... are we still friends?"\n\nHe stared directly at her. "Of course. I value our friendship deeply."\n\n"Then why did you kill that mare? And why is Daring Do still locked up?"\n\nThere was silence for some time. The earth pony closed his eyes, and when he opened them again, Crescent no longer saw her friend in front of her. "I did what had to be done. There is a great work ahead of us, and Celestia needs us to do hard things in order to achieve these goals. The removal of those who would poison the minds of the faithful is but one of those things. Regretfully, I am burdened with the most difficult choices to make, but I trust Celestia to guide me through them."\n\n"But that's not Celestia. Celestia is kind and loving and the pony sitting in Canterlot right now is anything but that." She bit her tongue and tried not to cry. "I'm resigning." Her voice cracked, then she quickly walked away before he could see her tears. Good Word did not rise from his desk as he absorbed the weight of her words. Funny, did he always feel so lonely?"

 daring_solar.30.t:0 "A Summons To Canterlot" #daring_solar.23-25 - Summon to Canterlot
 daring_solar.30.desc:0 "Good Word tentatively looked out of the sky chariot that was transporting him to Canterlot. The city wasn't too far away now — it looked truly magnificent under the radiance of the sun. He thought back to the letter that he had received: a direct invitation to come to Canterlot to speak with Empress Daybreaker regarding his "recent conduct." While he intended to leave as soon as possible, he did not expect a sizable Solar Guard escort to show up at his doorstep mere minutes after the letter had arrived.\n\nSoon his entourage arrived in the city proper. They landed just outside of the castle entrance, then informed Good Word that the Empress was waiting inside. He thanked them, then looked up at the double doors emblazoned with the sun. He began to feel apprehensive, which was an unfamiliar sensation. He'd spent his whole life teaching others about Celestia, yet he had never met her before...\n\nHe eventually summoned the courage to go inside. The castle interior was just as wondrous as he had imagined. Glass murals adorned the walls and ceiling, while exquisite banners and other brightly colored decor perfectly complemented the interior. Good Word respectfully kept his hooves to himself as he approached the throne room.\n\nThe guards nodded as they opened the doors, and in the earth pony went. The first thing he noticed was how big the room was — it was larger than the entire Grand Lodge building. The second was the lack of any additional guards. The third was a white pony with a fiery, flowing mane and stern gaze sitting atop a throne. His heart skipped a beat as he saw her looking at him. He immediately bowed as all of his rehearsed greetings seemed to slip away from him.\n\n"Rise," Daybreaker commanded, "I have watched you carefully over these past few years. Repeatedly I have had doubts as to whether or not the Southeast was capable of running itself while adhering to my laws. What kind of society they would build? What kind of pony would lead them? Now I see the results of these things laid before me.""

 daring_solar.31.desc_protector:0 ""If I were to describe you and your administration in a single word, I would describe you all as... unconventional. This 'Friendship Lodge' of yours bears much resemblance to many cults that Celestia had put down over the centuries." Daybreaker paused to cackle, "If only she knew how devoted her subjects would become if she had let them show it!"\n\nGood Word nodded, though he still felt uneasy in the presence of his Goddess. "We followed your teachings and sought to spread the truth of your divinity to all who would hear it."\n\nShe laughed again, "But you did not follow my teachings. You followed Celestia's teachings."\n\nThat caused the stoic earth pony's head to tilt. "I... you are Celestia, though?" Good Word asked, somewhat confused.\n\nHer gaze bored into him. "Because you have done so well, I will forgive that misconception. I'm the better, prettier, and more powerful version of Celestia." She made a dramatic show of extending the flames in her mane. "However, I will humor you. You and your Lodge may continue to call me Celestia, despite the... unorthodox beliefs you hold."\n\nGood Word stared at her briefly, then nodded once more. "I see." He stopped for a moment, "Is there anything else that I and the Friendship Lodge can do for you?"\n\nDaybreaker grinned exultantly, "Why, yes. You have all proven yourselves to be devout servants, and I am not above recognizing you as such. Therefore, I am hereby granting you full autonomy to serve me as you see fit, rather than to be subject to the examinations and red tape of my bureaucracy. After all, they aren't half as faithful as you are."\n\n"Thank you, Goddess Celestia."\n\nShe waved her hoof to dismiss him. Just as he was about to exit the room, she called out, "One more thing: This 'religion' of yours. While I find some aspects of it odd, I cannot deny its effectiveness in converting my sister's followers. Do the same for all those who reject me as their rightful ruler."\n\nGood Word firmly nodded one last time."
 daring_solar.31.desc_empress:0 ""To say that you have displeased me is a grave understatement, you impudent whelp. Who are you to call yourself my 'prophet' and to establish a heretical cult that directly contradicts the doctrines of my faithful inquisitors?" Daybreaker's mane flared as she stomped her hoof. "Explain yourself, now!"\n\nGood Word bowed deeply before her, "We followed your teachings and sought to spread the truth of your divinity to all-"\n\n"You did not follow my teachings at all. You followed Celestia's," Daybreaker practically spat at the name of her former self, "She was weak. Kindness and mercy are not conducive to a strong empire, and that is why Equestria crumbled the moment a breeze knocked on it."\n\nThe earth pony didn't quite know what to say to that. "We did not aim to displease you-"\n\n"Silence!" Daybreaker bellowed, sending out a wave of heat that nearly knocked Good Word to the ground. "I should never have allowed your organization to exist. Every day I kept hearing more and more heretical activities in the Southeast, and every day I felt the urge to go down there and cleanse it myself. The only reason I let your disobedience persist for so long was because of some vain hope that I wouldn't have to devote my precious time and resources to fixing you and this Lodge of yours." Her gaze bored into him. "But now I can see that you are beyond fixing."\n\nGood Word rose to his hooves again with a fire of his own in his voice. "We converted the Lunarists, though! They love you, just as we do! As I do!"\n\n"You love me?" Daybreaker cackled, "Please. You are a pathetic excuse for a pony who had the potential to be a devout servant of mine, but your flame mellowed out as you clung to a false version of me. You are no better than the 'Lunarists' who no doubt secretly practice their heretical beliefs behind your back."\n\nGood Word opened his mouth again to respond, but Daybreaker magically constricted his neck and flung him to the ground once more. When he looked up, he saw the almighty goddess of the sun rising into the air as a blindingly bright sun appeared from her horn. "Any last words, you insolent worm?"\n\nThe earth pony rose one last time. "Yes," he said. After what seemed like an eternity, Good Word retrieved his gun and pointed it at the deity in front of him. "Crescent was right about you." He pulled the trigger as the light consumed him."
 daring_solar.31.desc_mother:0 ""I'll be blunt: You're frustrating. At first, I was flattered that you worshipped me, but a self-proclaimed prophet? Really? And one that can't even do what I asked them to?" Daybreaker groaned in exasperation, "I see why Celestia worked so hard to stomp out organized religion. Your kind always listens to what you think I want rather than what I actually want."\n\nGood Word was taken aback by the brazen behavior of the alicorn he held in such high regard. "May I ask what we did to displease you, Celestia?"\n\nThe flames in Daybreaker's mane flared momentarily. "That. That is what you do and keep doing despite all of the evidence in the world saying that you are wrong." She stomped her hoof for emphasis, "Celestia is not my name— I am DAYBREAKER! I'm better, prettier, and way, way more powerful than the alicorn who used to sit on this throne! You and your Lodge keep pretending that I'm a nice little goddess who is okay with your brazen disregard for my wishes. It used to be cute to play along, but now?" Her face contorted into disgust, "It's annoying. I alone know what is best for my subjects. From now on, you will do exactly what I say, when I say it. Are we clear?"\n\nThe normally stoic earth pony was beset by a whirlwind of conflicting emotions as he processed what she was saying. After a moment, he settled on nodding. "I... yes, Ce-Daybreaker."\n\n"However," The alicorn allowed herself a smirk, "I am not above recognizing when my subjects surprise me, as you have. I did not think it was possible for my 'sister''s followers to be brought to heel, but you have managed to convert them of all things. I was making preparations for a more brutal form of subjugation, but thanks to you, that is no longer necessary. For this reason, I will not only spare your life, but I will also allow you to remain in control of the Southeast."\n\nGood Word bowed before her, "They were... difficult to manage, at times. I had faith that they would come around, and they did."\n\nHe did not see Daybreaker roll her eyes. "Yes, quite. Still, I expect you and your Lodge to adhere to my wishes. And my first wish for you is to ensure that every citizen of the Southeast understands that I do not want them to behave impulsively. They must be obedient, as I expect you to be."\n\nThe earth pony closed his eyes as he mentally scorned himself for misjudging his goddess' will. "Of course.""

This 'Friendship Lodge' of yours bears much resemblance to many cults that Celestia had put down over the centuries. Though yours..." Daybreaker paused to muse, "Perhaps this is why she had been so adamant about crushing organized religion."\n\nGood Word didn't quite know what to say to that. "Everything action we have taken was done in your name, Goddess Celestia."\n\nHer gaze bored into him. "Misconception after misconception. My name is Daybreaker, and I am the better, prettier, and more powerful version of Celestia. But you already knew that, didn't you? You just chose to ignore it in favor of your deified version of me, much like how you have ignored some of my other orders." She stopped again for effect, then sighed, "However, I cannot say that you have done the worst job ever. My 'sister''s followers are stubborn, and yet their rebellious nature has been quelled by your... organization."\n\nThe earth pony was silent for some time. "I... we did what we thought you wanted."\n\nThe flames in Daybreaker's mane briefly extended, sending a wave of heat at the mortal before her. "I *wanted* you to cement my authority in the Southeast and to show leniency to all but the most determined insurgents. You did the former, but several ponies convicted of minor crimes now either languish in prison or have been shunned from society. They will grow to become resentful of you, and by extension, me. Given enough time, they will become a greater problem than even the worst dissidents today."\n\nDespite the heat, Good Word stared directly at her. "What would you have us do?"\n\n"Pardon those who do not worship me as you do." The fiery alicorn placed a hoof on her temple, "If I had known that your organization leading the Southeast would lead to the situation we are in, then I would have had it dismantled long ago. But it is too late for that now. I shall allow you to continue your existence, and despite all of these issues, I will grant you further autonomy to go forth and extend my realm as you see fit." She glared at him again, "I expect you to heed my words from now on, or there will be Tartarus to pay. Do you understand?""
 daring_solar.32.desc_empress:0 ""When I first heard that you were calling yourself my 'prophet,' I wanted to punish your insolence. I did not grant you that title. And yet..."

Yes, you and this 'Friendship Lodge' of yours are fiercely loyal... but not to me."\n\nGood Word lowered his head in reverence, "Have we not done as you commanded, Goddess Celestia?"\n\n"That," Daybreaker bared her teeth, "is precisely the problem. You don't listen to me. You listen to your idealized version of Celestia!" She stomped her hoof as her mane flared. "You should have been worshipping me! Daybreaker, God-Empress of the Sun!"\n\nThe heat in the room briefly rose as the earth pony raised a hoof to shield his face. "We did not aim to displease you. Every action we took had the goal of solidifying your rule."\n\n"Every action you took was aggravating to watch. You lived in your own little world, following rules that almost, but did not perfectly align with my desires. You would spare heretics on one day, and punish traitors on another." Daybreaker pointed her hoof towards stallion before her, "The only positive thing I have to say about you, and the only reason why you are still standing before me, is that you have done what I thought to be impossible: You have subdued the terrorists that were so fond of my 'sister.'"\n\nGood Word chose his words carefully. "The Lunarists required... careful attention. Some needed only a few kind words to convert to our faith, while others needed to be forced to see the light. But they did see, in the end."\n\nThe alicorn rolled her eyes, then begrudgingly nodded. "I would have preferred more excruciating methods, but yours were... effective. Even I am not blind to that." Her gaze became focused again, "Still, you will adhere to my instructions from now on. I am Daybreaker, not Celestia. See to it that your Lodge refers to me as such. Furthermore, I shall allow your organization to continue existing, and I shall grant you the autonomy to go forth and spread my will without the oversight of my inquisitors." She paused for effect, "This will be your last chance to be redeemed. You will not show mercy to any heathens who do not accept me as their Goddess. Do you understand?""
 daring_solar.32.desc_mother:0 ""I'll be blunt: You and your organization have frustrated me at times, but overall, I am pleased with how you have handled the Southeast. It is no easy feat to make my 'sister''s followers kneel to my will, but you have done what I once thought would be impossible."\n\nAs Good Word bowed before her, he felt a huge weight lift from his shoulders. "They were... difficult to manage at times. Their beliefs were strong, but like their goddess, they have been banished away by your brilliant light."\n\nHe did not see Daybreaker roll her eyes. "Yes, quite. However, there is one thing I would like to address: I make a point to my subjects that I, Daybreaker, know what is best for them. They listen to me, or they suffer my wrath." She paused until he lifted his head to look at her, "I have heard that you and your Lodge erroneously refer to me as Celestia despite me enforcing my new image and name across the Empire. Because you have done so well in recent times, I will forgive this error. Make sure it is corrected."\n\n"Of course, Goddess Cel-Daybreaker." Good Word nodded firmly.\n\n"That brings me to my next topic. Your faith was built upon a different idea of what I actually am." She made a dramatic show of extending the flames in her mane. "While it is far too late to change some aspects that irk me, I now see that a new opportunity has opened up— one where my remaining enemies can be brought to heel. Do you understand where I am going with this?"\n\nThe earth pony was silent for a moment. "You mean for me to go forth and conquer in your name?"\n\nThe fiery alicorn grinned, "Precisely, and I shall grant you the autonomy to more easily perform this task. All I want in return is a promise that all my subjects shall praise me as you do."\n\nAs Good Word absorbed her words, he briefly recalled the many ponies who had chosen the pain of death rather than accepting his Goddess' divinity. A part of him wondered how many more would suffer like that. A smaller part of him enjoyed inflicting that pain."

"Every week I heard more and more bad news about the Southeast, and each time I hoped that I wouldn't have to divert my attention and resources to fix the problem you were becoming.

 daring_solar.34.desc:0 "It had been some time since the Friendship Lodge had undergone its transformation into a full state religion. To many, their ways were strange, and their methods of converting nonbelievers even stranger. Yet even with their persistent proselytizing, holdouts of other faiths in the Southeast remained.\n\nThe Moonspeaker Conclave in Ayacachtli was among one such group of holdouts. While distinctly different from traditional Lunarist sects, they were often clumped together by those who did not understand the intricacies of their ancient ways. Perhaps that is why a certain bandaged earth pony had opted not to send regular missionaries to speak with them, and instead brought the only pony capable of connecting to these unique thestrals: himself.\n\nArriving at the inner section of the mountain city, Good Word dismissed his small entourage and knocked on the door to an imposing moon-themed temple. He had already dispatched two would-be assassins and converted a third on his way here. There wasn't a pony devout enough in this city to stand in his way.\n\nThe door opened, revealing an elderly Moonspeaker. She squinted her eyes as she immediately recognized him through his bandages. "You've changed, young stallion. The fervent joy in your eyes has been replaced by a fearsome fire."\n\n"The fire of faith is indeed fearsome," Good Word said as he maintained eye contact with the mare. "May I come in?"\n\nThe old mare glanced down at the weapon he carried at his side. Were the shots she heard earlier his doing? "You know outsiders are forbidden from entering." She looked back up at him. His eyes... they held more than just fire. The pony in front of her was full of such absolute conviction that she no longer felt certain about the outcome of his visit. "I enjoyed our talks in the past, and I'm certain you'll try to show me the error of my ways again. That said... I suppose an exception could be made. Come inside.""

 daring_solar.35.desc:0 "---And it came to pass that a great multitude of Lodgers did gather around the site of the Grand Lodge Tabernacle upon its completion. Lo, the ponies of Stableside did prepare a great celebration, and with Celestia's blessing, the radiance of Her sun did shine especially bright that day---\n\nThe brilliance and glory of the structure before the ponies of Stableside could not be understated — it was second in beauty only to Celestia herself. Countless hours of labor and love had been poured into the Tabernacle from the finest engineers in the continent, and it showed. Exquisitely detailed depictions of Celestia and Her sun graced the many windows, with the largest design at the front showing the sun shining brightly as the moon beneath it reflected its beauty. The grand spires of the Tabernacle, numbering six in total, were adorned with the symbols of the Elements of Harmony, while atop the tallest spire was a luminous golden statue of Twilight Sparkle extending her wings and holding her front hooves up towards the sun above.\n\nThe dedication of the Tabernacle itself was given by none other than Good Word, whose reverence and respect for Celestia was unparalleled. All present to hear him speak felt a fervent joy in their hearts, as if what was transpiring here today would solidify the Lodge's status as the one true religion for ponykind, or perhaps even creaturekind.\n\nAs the dedication neared its end, Good Word raised his head one last time to address the boundless flock of faithful ponies standing before him. They looked upon him earnestly, and there were even camera operators present to broadcast and immortalize his speech throughout the country. There was no doubt in his mind that his final words would have a lasting impact on the Lodge for generations to come.\n\n"And so, as we prepare to open the Grand Lodge Tabernacle to all members of the Lodge, I beseech you to keep my words close to your heart. For this building is more than just special, it is perfect much like how Celestia is. When you walk its halls and chambers, I want you all to remember that it is...""

 daring_solar.36.desc:0 "The armed missionaries waited patiently as they watched Good Word enter the sanctuary of the gentiles. Normally they would accompany the prophet wherever he went, but he had seen fit to have them stand guard outside. And so, with weapons on one side and scriptures on the other, each began to pray for the safety of the stallion in their charge.\n\n"What's that, miss?" a very young thestral seemed to appear from nowhere, settling in between two of the missionaries. Several of them halted themselves mid-draw as they were caught off guard by the tiny colt's sudden appearance. Some surveyed their surroundings, evidently reminded that they would need to remain on alert. If someone so innocuous as a foal could sneak up on them, then a sinner might be able to as well.\n\nThe missionary closest to the colt saw that he was pointing to her scripture on the side of her barrel. She smiled, then retrieved the book. Any opportunity to teach the words of Celestia was a welcome one. "This is our Revised Journal of Friendship, a collection of the teachings of Celestia, Her Faithful Student, and our beloved prophet. It holds many lessons that help us find our way forward in life."\n\nThe colt tilted his head, his confusion apparent. "But my mom says the Moonspeakers help us live happily." He looked over the book as the mare lent it to him. He pointed at the symbol of the sun present on its cover. "My mom also says that sunnies are bad ponies. She says you're different sunnies but still sunnies. But you seem a lot nicer than the others."\n\nThe mare's smile became tainted by a hint of sadness, "Kindness is given to those who listen earnestly, young colt. But not everypony listens, and some even show hatred toward us because they don't understand why we do what we do." She guided his hoof over to the book and opened it to a particular page. "Take for example this passage by Twilight Sparkle: 'Sometimes, one of your best friends wants you to bond with another one of their best friends. But when you meet that friend, you realize you have nothing in common with that pony.'" The mare reached up and touched the thestral's ears, then her own to highlight their differences. "Many souls in the Empire don't like bat ponies, but we see you as equals. We're all just looking for guidance. And just as I can help show you the way..."\n\nBoth ponies looked up at the Moonspeaker's temple as they watched the entire Moonspeaker Conclave follow Good Word out the door. Every one of them was crying, and some even begged Good Word for forgiveness for their sins."

Good Word was there to meet her when she stepped outside with a long-winded apology at the ready. Unfortunately, the former Commander refused to accept it, firmly stating that he had betrayed her to serve a tyrant and that no acts of goodwill could undo the damage he had done to the culture of the Southeast. She turned to depart, but not before proclaiming that she would write another book to try to sway the minds of the masses.\n\nLife seemed to return to relative normalcy after that. Good Word couldn't help but feel a sense of worry, as if there was still an unsolved issue awaiting his attention. Then, after thoughtful prayer, he remembered the one wrong he had yet to right. He sent word to his assistants and summoned the pony he wished to speak with, and soon enough, she arrived at his office for the first time in what felt like eternity.\n\n"What do you want?" Crescent Glow spoke very bluntly. The venom in her tone was thick, but her eyes betrayed a hint of... was that despair? He couldn't tell.\n\n"I've had a lot of time to think about what has happened over the past few years," The Prophet chose his words very delicately, "and I realized that we haven't spoken in some time. I wanted to apologize to you for... damaging our friendship. I put my faith first, and in doing so, I separated myself from those closest to me." He carefully examined the thestral's response, noting that she did not seem pleased with him, then continued, "Furthermore, I realize that I have deeply hurt you, and I wanted to ask if there is anything I can do to make up for how I have wronged you."\n\nFor a brief moment, it seemed like her stern facade might break, but then she spoke with such fire that it nearly matched the heat of Daybreaker herself. "Can you undo the cultural genocide you've inflicted upon my home? What about the millions of lives you've upended and indoctrinated for your precious goddess? The same one who incinerated her sister's followers - my friends - for working their entire lives to try and earn the right to serve as the Night Guard?" She bared her teeth as she trembled. "What about my family? They disowned me for not following your beliefs. Can you fix that, too?"\n\nFor the first time in his life, Good Word was truly speechless.\n\nUpon sensing his hesitation, Crescent went in for the verbal kill. "I used to dream that we'd be together, but now I don't dream of anything at all. Is that because Daybreaker banished her sister again, or because of what you've done in the name of 'righteousness?'""

But on this occasion, one thestral found herself making her way towards the decorated tombstone. It was hard to miss, even through the light of the waning crescent moon. That joke might have brought a smile to her once, but this was not a joyous affair. She had even donned her old Night Guard uniform — it was what she was wearing when they had first met, after all.\n\nSoon enough, she found what she was looking for, then retrieved a tiny emblem — that of the alicorn sisters circling one another in harmony — from her pocket and tenderly lowered it to the ground alongside the myriad of other offerings. She sniffled, wiped her tears away, then stood up, but stopped when she saw what was inscribed upon the tombstone:\n\n"IT IS EASY TO BE IN PAIN AND TO INFLICT THAT PAIN UNTO OTHERS, BUT IT IS MIRACULOUS TO BE ABLE TO TURN THAT PAIN INTO UNRELENTING KINDNESS, EVEN UNTO DEATH."\n\nCrescent sank to the ground and began to bawl. "Why? Why, why why why?!?" She pounded the ground, utterly broken-hearted. "Why didn't you listen to me?! I told you she was evil!"\n\n"He was far too lost in his beliefs to see the truth." A toned voice spoke. Crescent whipped her head around, looking for its source. Through the dim moonlight, she made out that it was...\n\n"Caballeron? What are you doing here? How did you know I would be here?"\n\n"Call it a hunch." He chuckled, "I remember the way you used to look at him, back when we were working together. I figured you might still feel that way."\n\nShe would have blushed if she had not felt so utterly drained. "I shouldn't have left him. If... If I had stayed... maybe I could have convinced him not to go to Canterlot. Maybe I could have gotten past his blind obedience to Daybreaker and shown him what she was truly like..."\n\nThe stallion stepped forward and offered a hoof to her. "Perhaps. But would you be able to live with yourself, helping those fanatics? I know I wouldn't." Crescent took his hoof, "I know we're not exactly friends, but I knew that his death would greatly affect you. I wanted to make sure that you're okay." He stopped, then looked at her with concern. "You will be okay, won't you?""

Daring Do removed the Evanescent Emerald from her neck, then passed it over to Caballeron, who then gave it to Crescent Glow. It was a huge gamble to try and sneak in a potent magical artifact that would allow Daring to escape, but the plan went about as well as it could have. No major slipups, though eventually the prison would put two and two together and realize who had aided their most valuable prisoner in escaping. Then they would all be wanted criminals.\n\n"I will admit that I do not know how to proceed from here," Caballeron said as he discarded his old government ID that he had used to gain entry to the prison, "It would seem that even if we did manage to remove Daybreaker from power — and that is a very large if — the empire she has built would collapse unceremoniously, and countless Equestrians would die from the ensuing chaos as different groups vie for power."\n\n"Yeah. And Good Word is..." Crescent looked away, her expression downcast, "He's too far gone. I used to think he might turn around, but... no." She shook her head. "His dogma has infected the entire Southeast. Even if we did find a way to remove him, everypony would hate us for it."\n\nDaring grimaced. Their options from here on out were, to put it bluntly, not ideal. "We can't just give up, though. There's always a way. Don't forget, I'm still famous around the world. If I can publish another book, that might give us the international support we need to stir anti-Daybreaker sentiments enough to undo some of the religious indoctrination here. We can try to build up resistance movements, and then... we'll see."\n\nThe earth pony and thestral solemnly nodded in agreement.

Do you mean to say that we believe things other than what we teach?"\n\nDeep within one of the countless lodges within Stableside, two ponies sat across from one another in a small office room. One was an older mare, though she, like many others within the Lodge, had underwent a spiritual reawakening over the recent years. The other was a young stallion no older than twenty, one that had just recently been ordained as a member of the Lodge.\n\nThe older mare gently smiled. "In addition to, not other than. There are some beliefs best not spoken in public. Some ponies might turn their head in confusion, but others, like many of the misguided souls within Celestia's realm, would see them as heretical."\n\nThe young stallion was confused. "But if the Solar Empire thinks that those beliefs are heretical, then why do we practice them? What even are those beliefs?"\n\n"We believe these things because they are true." The mare opened her desk drawer and retrieved a photograph. She placed it on the table and turned it toward the young stallion; it was one of the first pictures taken of Twilight Sparkle after her transformation into an alicorn. "What you see is the first instance of 'Exaltation' to ever occur in the world."\n\n"...I don't understand. What do you mean?"\n\nThe mare's patience was matched only by her reverent tone. "When Twilight Sparkle followed the principles laid before her by Celestia, she became like her. If we do the same, then we too will one day become like Celestia."\n\nThe young stallion deeply pondered the ramifications of what he was just told. "So... we can become alicorns if we follow the prophet's teachings and be like Celestia?"\n\n"Yes. One day, each and every pony who is true to our faith will ascend just like Twilight Sparkle did.

It was quite the rare occasion that Good Word found himself without something to do, and yet here he was, sitting alone in his office with several hours left until it was time to sleep.\n\nA thought occurred to him: Perhaps he could visit Daring Do again. He had made it a personal mission of his to convert the former Commander... though try as he might, he could not convince her of the error of her ways. He frowned. She was too stubborn. Another time, maybe.\n\nPerhaps trip to his parents' gravestones? He closed his eyes. No, no... this was not a day to mourn, not when he was finalizing preparations to deliver Chiropterra to Celestia on a silver platter.\n\nWhat about Crescent Glow? He thought to himself. She was always... he paused. He wasn't sure how he hadn't realized this until now, but... he hadn't heard from her since she resigned. He frowned again. He did consider her a friend, despite her... wait...\n\nOnly then did Good Word realize his cognitive dissonance: he thought of Crescent Glow as a friend, yet he also considered her a sinner for her refusal to accept Celestia into her heart. He sat for some time trying to unravel that troublesome thought, but then another, even more worrying thought emerged:\n\n"I have no friends, only followers."\n\nHis office was now particularly quiet. For the first time since he emerged from the flames, he felt doubt. Was the path of righteousness truly meant to be a lonely one? He knew many verses from the Friendship Journal that claimed otherwise, and yet that did not change his situation: The Prophet of the Friendship Lodge had no friends.\n\nHe glanced at the portrait of Celestia on the wall.

Clearly, none wanted to speak out against the mare who had fought so hard to get them to where they are now.\n\n"Well," One stallion resigned himself by standing up, "With due respect Commander, we can't go against the princess after all that she's done for Equestria."\n\nDaring stomped her hoof in frustration. "That's not our princess anymore! She literally burned some of her own ponies to death for questioning her authority! Does that sound like Celestia to you?!"\n\nHer heart sunk when the stallion and the rest of parliament seemed to hesitate before answering her. "...She was probably just defending herself against Nightmareist agents." The stallion sighed, "Commander, we're tired. We don't want to fight each other again. We're all Equestrians, even Celestia with her new... look."\n\n"I can't believe this. What happened to you all? Where are the ponies who fought so hard with me to restore harmony to the southeast?"\n\n"We haven't abandoned harmony, Commander. Harmony has just changed, and so has Celestia, or Daybreaker as she now calls herself." The stallion paused, then tried to appeal to Daring Do. "You know as well as we do that Equestria will never be the same again. But we still believe in harmony. We just need to have faith that the princess will do what is best for us."\n\n"If this is what harmony is, then I want no part of it!" Daring ripped off the emblem of Celestia's cutie mark adorning her uniform, "I'M LEAVING!"\n\nThere were audible gasps as Daring Do stormed off and slammed the door shut behind her."

How ironic was it that the only pony who followed her was the one that she liked the least?\n\nQuibble Pants just about collapsed as he finally caught up with her. "You gotta... stop moving... so fast..." He haphazardly reached for his canteen and gulped down the entire thing, then wiped the sweat from his brow, "So... where are we going precisely?"\n\n"There is no 'we', I was going to look for something to stop Daybreaker. You can go back to your cushy desk job, Quibble."\n\nHe scoffed, "Oh please, 'A.K. Yearling', ever since 'Daring Do and the Trek of the Terrifying Towers', the quality of your adventures have fallen off of, well, a tower. Hence why I am here to 'assist' you so that your next book will hopefully be as good as the original trilogy."\n\nDaring Do groaned in exasperation, "Why are you so concerned with my books at a time like this?! Both of the princesses have gone insane!"\n\n"I don't pay attention to politics."\n\nShe resisted the urge to throw a stick at him. "You know what? Fine. If you wanna help so much, then you tell me: What magical artifact can defeat an alicorn? Specifically the one in charge of raising the sun?"\n\nQuibble rolled his eyes. "Easy: The Staff of Sacanas. I read about it in one of the documentaries about the Storm King. It's supposed to be able to steal the magic of an alicorn and leave them powerless."\n\nDaring's ears perked up. "Wow, that was actually useful information. Where is it?"\n\n"I don't know, I never finished the documentary."\n\nShe threw a stick at him."

The design is overly complex, the instructions needlessly cryptic, and worst of all, it-"\n\n"Just give it here!" Daring Do swiped the map away from his hooves and looked over it. "Hmm... the map says that the temple which houses the staff is located somewhere north of Tenochtitlan." She scratched her muzzle, "That's odd, I thought I'd already explored all of the temples in that area..."\n\n"As I was saying," Quibble swiped the map back, "It's completely useless. This just leads to the same place where you found the Sapphire Stone! Which, mind you, is still your best book."\n\nDaring grumbled as she yanked the scroll away again and rolled it up, "Do you have anything better to complain about than the quality of my books?!"\n\n"Well, for starters, the-"\n\n"That was a rhetorical question!"\n\nQuibble narrowed his eyes, then shrugged. "Fine. I guess we'll do things your way. Because your way no doubt includes traversing several dangerous parts of the jungle, evading lots of traps, solving puzzles, and countless other wastes of our time in search of a place you've already been to."\n\nAfter a moment of indecision, Daring grit her teeth and swallowed her pride. "And do you know a better way to find the staff?"\n\nHer companion's smug aura mocked her. "I thought you'd never ask.""

 daring_shadow.4.desc:0 "In time, Daring Do and Quibble Pants made their way to the temple which supposedly held the Staff of Sacanas. When it became apparent that the temple was indeed the same place that Daring had found the Sapphire Stone years ago, Quibble prepared to turn around, but Daring insisted that they check anyways "just to be sure." And thus they found themselves scaling the stairs of the temple.\n\n"Did we really have to come here in the middle of the night? You know that nighttime adventures least triple the chances that something bad will happen to us, right?" Quibble glanced up towards the full moon and pointed to it in exasperation, "Quadruples it!"\n\nDaring sighed for perhaps the hundredth time since she'd begun this journey. "I told you already, Daybreaker needs to be stopped! For all we know, her brainwashed ponies could be after us! Who knows how much time we have until they find us?"\n\n"Why would they be looking for us, though?" Quibble complained, "I haven't done anything! And the only thing you did was quit your job!"\n\nDaring elected to ignore him as they made their way into the temple itself. To their surprise, the traps hadn't been reset despite the years between Daring's last visit and now. As they traversed the eerily silent structure, they couldn't help but feel a little bit unnerved by how little resistance they had met throughout their entire journey. Even as they reached the core of the temple, there was naught but silence to greet them.\n\nQuibble tentatively glanced at the map that he had been so critical of earlier. "It says that what we seek is 'within the shrine of the Sapphire Stone.'" He looked around at the intricate, yet neglected room. "Well, we're here and I don't see it."\n\nDaring trotted up to the pedestal that she had taken the Sapphire Stone from years ago. She carefully examined it, then noticed something odd: The frame of the pedestal seemed loose. With some effort, she hefted the top of the pedestal off, revealing a hole that extended far downwards. She glanced back and smirked at her companion. "It said 'within' the shrine, Quibble." He rolled his eyes in response.\n\nShe tied a rope to a nearby pillar and descended into the hole. As she reached the bottom, she noticed a faint, ghostly light emanating from what looked like a peculiar stone in front of her. She began to reach out towards it."

There was no up, no down, no sense of direction at all. While she was used to being in stressful situations, this was unlike anything she'd ever experienced before. "H-Hello!?"\n\nA distorted voice answered her. "Impressive work, Daring Do."\n\nShe whipped her head around but could see no source of the unnerving voice. "Who's there?! Show yourself!" Daring continued to look around, only to see a bone-chilling shadowy face with shining white holes for eyes staring at her where there wasn't one before. "Who... what are you?!"\n\nThe being seemed to chuckle. "Perhaps what I am is not as important as what I can offer you. You came to me because you need help, Daring Do. I can sense it." The face swiveled around her with unnatural speed, closing in next to her ear. "What is it that that you need help with so desperately?"\n\nWhile her gut was screaming at her not to trust whatever this thing was, she decided to play along to see if she could find a way out of this ominous place. "I... I was looking for a way to turn Daybreaker back into Celestia."\n\n"Hmm..." The being retreated slightly, "That is a large need. Too large. It is beyond my power."\n\nAt that remark, Daring simply shrugged. "Hey, you asked."\n\n"But what if..." The being rose above her, "There was something else? Something... deeper than that desire? Something you have wanted since the very beginning?"\n\nDaring thought back on the past few years. Equestria had practically exploded into a cacophony of bloodshed and violence that ordinary ponies could never have comprehended. So many innocents had been forever scarred by the horrors of war. Even the alicorns had gone mad. She opened her eyes and stared at the being again. "I want peace. I want Equestria to be at peace."\n\n"I can grant you the power to do this, Daring Do." The being extended a shadowy protrusion out in front of her, "Equestria at peace. A difficult task, but it can be done. All you have to do is... Let. Me. In."\n\nDespite the sinking feeling in her heart, Daring didn't see any other way out of this place. Against her better judgment, she grasped the being's tendril."

This... what's happening around us is its doing, I know it. We should have left when we had the chance."\n\nMage Meadowbrook turned away from one of her many patients to address her young friend, "Maybe we should have, Stygian, but we didn't. We stayed because we help ponies in need." She picked up an herb and placed it over her patient's nose, then gestured to the dozens of other ponies, all of which had expressions of terror frozen on their faces, laying in stretchers and makeshift beds across her improvised underground hospital. "And right now, these ponies need us."\n\nStygian shuffled his hooves around uncomfortably, "I know, it's just... you're a Pillar. If you and the others could meet up again, you could banish the Pony of Shadows into Limbo again!"\n\n"Don't you remember what happened when you were saved from the Pony of Shadows, Stygian? It wasn't us who saved you, it was the magic of friendship. And nobody knows friendship better than Twilight Sparkle and her friends. I'm sure that they'll be able to handle this. Now be a dear and fetch me some more herbs from the back, please."\n\n"If you say so..." Stygian left to head into the supply closet. He rummaged around the area, then sighed. They were running low on herbs again, which meant another excursion outside. He was searching through the last container when he heard what sounded like the shattering of wood. The shelter door! He turned to leave, but then he heard a sharp cry. All of the candles went out, plunging the hospital into absolute darkness. He pressed himself against a wall and held his breath. If Meadowbrook was in trouble...\n\n...Stygian cursed himself. He wanted to help her, but he also never wanted to see the Pony of Shadows ever again. More than anyone else, he know what that monster was capable of when it gets its hooves on somepony. He sunk down to the ground and began to sulk. What could he even hope to do against it? He didn't even know if Star Swirl had gotten his letter for help after he had gone traveling around the world to learn more about friendship."

Without delay, my shard enters the cavern. My shard moves swiftly. There are multiple paths. It selects one at random and follows it. There is a bright light in the distance. My shard moves swiftly.\n\nThe Tree is ahead. My shard spots two ponies guarding it with ground-mounted automatic weapons. They open fire. My shard moves swiftly. My shard twists and bends its form as it advances on them, avoiding most of their fire. One appendage reforms into a blade. It slices one of the weapons apart. My shard moves swiftly. It leaps at the other weapon. A mistake. The weapon lands multiple consecutive hits into my shard. It is not enough. My shard is damaged, but it regenerates almost instantaneously.

Currently, she was sitting on a rather comfy rock near an isolated farm. She figured that the Shadow was either gone or missing, since the shroud over Equestria had vanished. She'd wandered aimlessly, not sure of what to do with herself. It gave her a lot of time to reflect on some mysteries. Her experience with... using... the Shadow had given her a lot of insight on the inner workings of magic.\n\nThe Sapphire Stone in her first book wasn't magical, that much she knew. So that mysterious blue light beneath the temple must have been from the real one, and she had taken a decoy earlier. She had deduced that the Sapphire Stone allowed its user to peer into alternate planes of existence, but when not attuned properly, it might only show the places between planes...\n\n...and when she peered into Limbo, the Shadow hitched a ride with her back into the real world. Daring grimaced. If she hadn't bargained with that thing, then maybe she could have found another way to defeat Daybreaker and restore peace to Equestria. But it's too late for that now. Even if she did find a way to bring everycreature back from Limbo... she didn't have magic anymore. There was also all of the ones who... didn't make it.\n\nShe hopped off of the rock and began to walk again."

The bullets seemed to disintegrate the creature briefly, but they weren't enough; it swiftly reformed itself and resumed its relentless march.\n\n"Mild! We have to retreat!" called out Steam Vent from a nearby fortification. He had no idea what he and his wife had gotten into when they had both volunteered to defend the city, but he knew he had to keep her safe. He would never forgive himself if he let her...\n\nShe didn't seem to hear him. "YOU WON'T TAKE MY HOME YOU MONSTERS!" she screamed as she dumped her magazine into the creature, but to no avail. The echo of the empty click rang louder than the continuous barrage of heavy weapons fire occurring throughout their defensive line. She cursed and briefly took her gaze off the creature to reload her weapon.\n\n"MILD! GET BACK NOW!" her husband shouted. But by the time she had readied her weapon again, it was too late. The almost incorporeal creature of shadow spread out its tendrils and enveloped the mare. Steam screamed in terror and swiveled his machine gun around to unload it into the beast, praying desperately that it would be enough. An unnatural howl emerged from the creature as the firepower from the machine gun seemed to be enough to destroy it. It released its grip on the mare as its shadowy form was ripped to shreds.\n\nSteam let go of his weapon and practically threw himself over the fortifications to check on his wife. First, he felt relief at seeing her chest still rising. His relief quickly melted away into horror as he saw her face: Frozen in shock, her eyes wide; it seemed like she wasn't there at all. Steam performed a basic medical check, only to discover that whatever the creature had done to her, it had rendered her comatose. He looked around in preparation to carry her to safety, but his heart sank when he saw dozens more of those same shadow creatures enveloping the rest of his defensive line. He looked back down at his wife and apologized to her, but before he could rise, another shadow was already upon him."

Ever since Daring Do went into that temple, some horrible monstrosity had emerged and was consuming the entire countryside at a breakneck pace. He hoped that she was okay, though judging by what he had seen happen to the ponies around him, the malevolent shadowy fog seemed to produce nightmarish monsters which drag ponies away and puts them into a deep sleep... at least, he hoped it was sleep. He shuddered as he recalled one unfortunate pony hyperventilating until their heart gave out.\n\nThis didn't bode well for his psyche, as he was barely able to run faster than the shroud that kept encroaching on the land behind him. He had only just reached Tenochtitlan barely an hour before the darkness had spread that far, giving him only a brief moment to pause and catch his breath.\n\nHow could he have been so stupid? The Sapphire Stone in the first Daring Do book wasn't magical, that much was clear... therefore, it must have been a decoy. It was obvious now that the real Sapphire Stone was still in the temple, and that it held magical powers of some kind. But what? He thought back to the traveling merchant from Saddle Arabia that Daring Do had bought the map from. The merchant's accent was rather heavy... it was possible that the language barrier resulted in them selling Daring Do a way to -find- the Staff of Sacanas rather than a map that led directly to it.\n\nEither way, it didn't matter now. Quibble glanced behind him only to see a faint, but towering shadowy monstrosity approaching in the distance. His incredibly sore legs complained at having to move again, but he had no choice. He had to get away. He had to run, for that was all anypony could do now."

Good Word replied calmly as he stared at a small picture of the fair princess of the sun.\n\nCrescent paused, dumbfounded. "Are you... have you lost your mind?! Equestria is being overrun by this thing! We have to get to the coast, NOW!"\n\n"If I have faith in Her, then She will protect me." Good Word bowed his head down in reverence, though his shaking hooves betrayed his real emotions.\n\nCrescent felt a pang in her heart, but she didn't have time to be careful about his feelings. "Celestia's gone, and you know it. Daybreaker's just a twisted version of her, like Nightmare Moon is to Luna. And if we aren't on a boat in the next twenty minutes, something much worse than either of them is going to be here."\n\n"I... I..." Good Word started, then he looked up towards Crescent, "...you're right. I'm sorry. I'm not strong enough to be her-"\n\nShe yanked him up off of the ground, "Cut the faith-talk, we both deserve better than some preachy 'empresses' who never learned how to play nice together as fillies. Now let's get out of here."\n\n---\n\nBy the time the two ponies had made it onto an evacuation ship, the shadowy cloud had encompassed over half of the city. Although they had doubts as to whether or not she would have been able to do anything about this monstrous entity, they both wished that Daring Do was here to help them."

The once-proud seat of Equestria, the former glorious center of the Solar Empire, and now, just another silent city with pockets of survivors hiding from the darkness.\n\nDespite the shadowy monstrosities roaming the streets, Canterlot Castle itself remained protected under an extremely potent magical shield cast by Daybreaker herself. While the Shadow Realm overtook the rest of the Solar Empire, the castle remained preserved as it was... until now.\n\nFrom the darkness, a pony emerged. She looked at the shield protecting the castle and raised her hoof up against it. Surprisingly, it passed through as if there was no barrier at all. She pressed another hoof forward, and when her head passed through, she gasped, as if the full weight of her actions had been realized all at once.\n\n"No!" Daring shouted. Before she could do anything further, shadowy tendrils inched up her body just underneath the barrier's protection to envelop her again.\n\n"Yes," said the pony, who then proceeded into the castle."

 daring_shadow.20.desc:0 "The Pony of Shadows gazed upon the bunker where the false deity of the night was last seen. It had meticulously cut off her escape routes while surrounding her on all sides to ensure that she could not get away, even going so far as to magically seal the area in order to prevent teleportation. And yet the false goddess and her last remaining subjects were gone, as if they had never been there in the first place.\n\nWhile the Pony of Shadows found this mildly annoying, ultimately it did not matter if Nightmare Moon was captured or not. Her forces had crumbled to its might, and she would no longer pose a threat to its goal. It was curious on how she had managed to escape, though. Did she bypass the anti-teleportation spell? No, its magic was far stronger than hers.\n\nIt extended tendrils toward the concrete structure. The alicorn had to have used magic, that much was sure. But what kind? The tendrils probed the nooks and crannies, trying to sense any residual magical energy left behind.\n\nIt felt enlightenment, then frustration. The Pony of Shadows withdrew its tendrils as it pieced together what had occurred. Nightmare Moon, as false of a goddess as she was, had cast an exceedingly well-hidden illusory spell. She never entered this bunker at all, but instead had crafted an illusion as her forces were fleeing, tricking the shadow monsters into following a mere image.\n\nClever, it thought as it turned to leave the area. For any other being, an alicorn on the run might pose a serious threat. However, the Pony of Shadows had long since surpassed the power level of mere immortals. No single being on Equus was strong enough to defeat it, not alone. It pushed Nightmare Moon out of its mind, the returned its focus to the task at hoof."

These all would have been fine to handle on their own, but shortly after the president of our puppet state mysteriously vanished, those annoyances took a back seat to a new, unforeseen problem.\n\nVarious cities in the Southeast began to report strange occurrences, first at night, then during broad daylight. In one reported instance, the very light of the sun itself was said to be "smothered by an artificial darkness," followed by a loss of communication with that outpost. The nature of these reports all shared the same ominous details: unnatural creatures would appear from the darkness, small arms fire seemed next to useless against them, and ponies defending themselves from the monsters were forced to retreat.\n\nThe situation has ponies so frightened that many are beginning to flee the Southeast in every direction, regardless of what dangers await them elsewhere. As unfortunate as this is, the problem only continues to grow, and it is very likely that the entire region will be lost within a few weeks."

 daring_shadow.22.desc:0 "The few guards that remained in the castle were easily subdued and enshrouded. The pony released a few tendrils into the unlit corners, and from those shadows she deduced that her target was in the throne room, as expected.\n\nThe door to the throne room burst open, and the shadow-infused pony was met with a wave of searing heat. Before her was none other than Daybreaker, seated upon her throne like a child who refused to budge in the face of bedtime. The pony grinned, extending her shadowy wings as a dark aura emanated from her horn.\n\nDaybreaker opened her mouth to give one of her no-doubt egotistical retorts, but the pony's assault commenced before she could utter a single word. Shadowy limbs emerged from the pony's body and rushed towards the fiery alicorn. Daybreaker ignited her horn and sliced apart the shadows with ease. The pony knelt down and screamed as an unending number of tendrils manifested themselves from her body and tried to reach for Daybreaker.\n\nOn and on Daybreaker cut down the shadows before they could reach her while the pony swiftly dodged the alicorn's beams of fire. As time went on, however, it became clear that Daybreaker could not destroy the shadows faster than they appeared. She flew high up to the far side of the room and focused her magic into a blindingly bright ball of light, then threw it down at the pony. The pony's attacks ceased as it collided with her. Daybreaker began to cackle, "When there are no shadows left, only my glory remains!"\n\nSuddenly, Daybreaker felt dozens of tendrils wrap themselves around her. She tried to ignite her horn again, but one such tendril enveloped her horn and smothered her flow of magic. Her confidence vanished instantaneously as she looked around for the source of the tendrils, only to discover that she herself was casting a shadow from her miniature sun spell.\n\nThe pony emerged from that shadow. She did not laugh at her victory, instead offering a wicked smile, like that of a foal that had just trapped an insect. She leaned forward and whispered into the Daybreaker's ear, "Time to go to sleep."\n\nA small, multicolored portal appeared next to the once-proud alicorn. Daybreaker stared into it, fear stricken across her face. She struggled against her bonds, but to no avail. She let out a muffled cry as she was dragged away into Limbo."

But no; she was back in the world of the living. Back in her home. Back in Tartarus.\n\nShe slowly rose from her bed and began to weep as her eyes tried and failed to adjust to the pitch-black reality she had lived in for... she wasn't even sure how long it was now. She'd long since run out of candles, flashlight batteries, and matches that would have offered her a modicum of comfort in this silent, suffocating darkness. At first, the dark fog only permitted vision within a few meters around her during "daytime," but as time went on, it gradually became all-encompassing to the point that she might as well have been blind.\n\nSweet's stomach grumbled. She wiped her tears away and carefully crawled out of her bed, taking care to avoid making excess amounts of noise as she made her way to her apartment's kitchen. She hadn't heard any of the monsters for several days, but...\n\nA painful memory flashed in her mind. She was out scavenging for supplies with her younger brother. The market in her hometown had served them well for some time, but the trek there was always dangerous. They had to move quickly and only use their flashlights when absolutely necessary. They had gathered a good haul from the long-abandoned store, but her younger brother had become curious about some long sticks he had found; he carelessly dragged one along the asphalt on the way home. The sparkler loudly ignited, and then... Sweet closed her eyes. One moment he was with her, and the next, she only saw his terrified face as one of the shadow monsters stole him away. She didn't even hear him scream.\n\nEvery time she went to sleep, she hoped she wouldn't wake up. What was the point of going on? She hadn't found anypony else still conscious; all of the "sleepers" she stumbled across were in some sort of trance that she couldn't wake them from. She had no idea where her family was, or if they were even alive. She had no way to tell what places were safe, much less how to find them. She had even failed to protect her brother after promising him that they'd find a way out together. She was alone.\n\nSweet opened her pantry and felt around for something to eat, but there was nothing left. She gulped as she knew what this meant: she had to go outside again. She collapsed to her knees and burst into tears once more. It was too much. She had no food. No light. No family. No escape. No hope. Her voice cracked as she quietly pleaded into the void, "What did we do to deserve this?""

As Daring did not expect tales of her adventures to sell very well if advertised as real, she opted to market them as fiction instead under the pen name of A.K. Yearling.\n\nA fearless adventurer at heart, Daring Do has spent many years keeping powerful magical artifacts away from those who would misuse them. From the devious creature known as Ahuizotl to the greedy Doctor Caballeron, she has thwarted many foes in her quest to protect ponies from potential catastrophes. Between her escapades, she often spent time relaxing at home and adapting her latest adventure to novels.\n\nUnfortunately for Daring, her adventuring came to a screeching halt when Equestria descended into civil war.

Whether it was a friendly conversation or a strife-filled argument, his uncanny ability to get through to even the most distrusting ponies was as unnerving as his ever-pleasant personality. However, for most of his life, his outward happiness was merely a mask that hid his crippling anxiety. Furthermore, he had become somewhat distant from his father due to the elder stallion's preference for doing charity work rather than spending time with his son.\n\nGood Word's life began to change in 1002 after an attempt to rekindle the relationship with his father took a turn for the worse. During a relief mission alongside a small ponytarian group known as the Friendship Lodge, a damaged support beam caused the roof above Good Word's father to collapse, burying him underneath a heap of metal. The young stallion saw the speed and zeal of the Friendship Lodge firsthoof as they rescued his father, even going so far as to rush him to the hospital when they saw he was hurt.\n\nUnfortunately, the injuries Good Word's father received were terminal. As the elder stallion was dying, he apologized to his son for not being there for him, and said that the reason why he worked so hard to aid others was that "there are so many ponies who need help, and Celestia knows they need it more than we do. She would help too, but even she can't be everywhere at once."\n\nThis was the spark that altered the young stallion forever: He became filled with the same spirit of charity that his father held, and he sought to work alongside the Friendship Lodge in order to both work past his own anxiety while spreading kindness and the teachings of Celestia to all. In the years that followed, he rapidly rose through the Lodge's ranks, and it was only a few months after he became Head Lodger that Equestria descended into civil war.\n\nNow he stands ready to do what he believes Celestia would do, but some wonder if his desire to emulate the princess' actions borders on obsession, or perhaps even worship.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: PrincessRari" #Non-solarist Good Word

However, for most of his life, his outward happiness was merely a mask that hid his crippling anxiety.\n\nAs he progressed through young adulthood, Good Word found himself joining and eventually leading a ponytarian organization known as the Friendship Lodge. They helped him through his personal problems, and in turn, he channeled his passion back into the Lodge tenfold. At the dawn of the Equestrian Civil War, he sought to maintain the spirit of friendship and harmony wherever he went, but the reality of war between Equestria and the Lunarists slowly ate away at his desire to help those who now wanted to kill him.\n\nThings eventually came to a head when the once-peaceful ruler of Equestria transformed into Daybreaker. The government in Stableside had decided to throw their lot in with the empress, and as a part of that, they had invited Good Word to speak on the matter on behalf of the Friendship Lodge. That was the fateful day that Lunarist arsonists had barricaded and burnt down the capitol, killing everypony inside.\n\nBut Good Word was not just anypony. Just as Celestia was underwent a fiery rebirth, the inferno stripped away the last of his anxiety and doubts, leaving only the purity of his hope that Celestia would save him. His faith. And through that faith, he rose from the ashes of the secular government with a new, divine purpose in life: to spread that faith to all — and to convert the gentiles through any means necessary.\n\n§YPortraits By§!: Motley_ad, Bunnyshrubby, & Twotail813" #Solarist Good Word

Tales of her kindness and beauty enthralled the young mare, and so like many other thestrals, she sought to devote her life to the Princess of the Night. Unfortunately for her, the millennium since Nightmare Moon's banishment had polluted the vision of Luna held by many ponies, leading to Crescent's dismay when she learned that the Night Guard in Canterlot was merely a ceremonial role and a ridiculed one at that.\n\nStill, Crescent persevered. She sought education at Canterlot University, and then on the day of her graduation, something miraculous happened: Princess Celestia announced the return of her beloved sister, and Crescent got to see younger alicorn with her own eyes. The joy that Princess Luna's return had brought to Crescent was matched only by her desire to remedy the Night Guard's perceived appearance as a joke. She quickly enrolled in Equestria's military, and through sheer determination, she outpaced all of her peers in Officer School.\n\nAlas, in a cruel twist of fate, shortly after she finished training, Princess Luna transformed into Nightmare Moon once more. This devastated the young mare, as she privately did not wish to serve an evil alter ego of the pony she worshipped so dearly. And so, when she was placed in charge of a portion of the New Lunar Empire's military, she and many other like-minded Lunarists defected to fight for harmony.

Maita spent a considerable amount of time trying to tone down the extreme and bloody traditions of the Hidden Tribe with mild success, though he knew that some of them still clung to the ancient ways in hopes that they might get to practice their beliefs openly once more. It did not help Maita's efforts, knowing that the mysterious creature known as Ahuizotl whispered promises of a "New Cycle" into their ears.\n\nStill, Maita's charismatic nature and easygoing personality worked wonders in deradicalizing the majority of his kin, so much so that he no longer worried daily about the possibility of bloody rituals being performed in secret. Unfortunately for him, the Equestrian Civil War caused numerous problems to flare up with both his tribe and the rest of the Neighua, and so he and many of his tribe turned to Daring Do for help.\n\nThanks to Daring and the rest of their mutual friends, Maita is now able to relax more often than not, as the local cultures of his homeland are no longer in danger of being wiped out or reverting to darker traditions.\n\nWhen not attending to government matters, he can be found reminiscing with aides on how he misses the peace and quiet of his hometown. Perhaps when true peace is achieved one day, he can return there for good.\n\nUntil then, he still has many jokes to tell, and equally many jovial tales to share."
 JUN_doctor_caballeron_for_CES_desc:0 "§YBiography§!: Doctor Caballeron is famous for being an antagonist in the Daring Do novels. What many did not know until recently was his humble beginnings as an archaeology student from Puerto Caballo. The world of Aztlan, with all its rich historical depth—from its endangered languages to its well-preserved temples—had been a source of wonder, and the only way for him to truly engage with it was a thorough search into their past, selling relics to fund his archaeological studies, which pitted him against Daring Do whenever they crossed paths.\n\nDespite that, he would graduate with flying colors, setting himself up for a career that balanced quiet paperwork with adventurous fieldwork. That all changed when Equestria descended into civil war. His ill-fated Aztlan Free State was propped up by the bits he'd earned, armed by the mercenaries he'd bought, and motivated by a desire to defend the Neighua, but it would ultimately fall to Daring Do's resistance where Caballeron now takes refuge in.\n\nWhile he says he harbors good intentions in helping make Equestria whole, his villainous reputation precedes him, though he has sworn up and down that he will not take advantage of his position in the new government. Still, every day that passes where he helps ponies from all walks of life is counted as a small victory.

Those ponies see the princess of the sun as nothing more than a respected ruler, one who shows kindness to her subjects as much as she expects kindness from them.

If you asked her, she would weave a tale of a bullied filly, an abusive household, and stalwart pacifism in the face of adversity. On one day, she'd say she had suffered from addiction, and another, hedonism. But one thing she was always consistent about was that she looked up to Celestia.\n\nShe was a free spirit, one did not want to be tied down by the realities of finances and her health. She would roam from city to city, living off of the kindness of others, but inevitably, she would exhaust that kindness and move on, bitter that kindness could be exhausted at all. Eventually, she had found her way to Stableside, now heavily dependent upon illegal substances she had sampled throughout her life.\n\nUpon Celestia's transformation into Daybreaker, Sweet Bliss found salvation in the form of the Friendship Lodge. Their kindness was strange, but seemingly limitless. They would nurse her back to health. Some of them would adopt her as their sister. She would take their tenets to heart, but she viewed them through a different lens: While faith is the ultimate weapon, to truly defeat all obstacles, one must turn their eyes from all else.

### Focus Loc ###

SLC_storm_civil_war_start:0 "Once More Into Battle"
SLC_storm_civil_war_start_desc:0 "It has been some time since Ibyz Icepaw last saw full-scale warfare, but her years of running an occupation in the west have not dulled her senses or reduced her capacity. The time has come for His Majesty’s finest soldiers and commanders to prove themselves once more. Inept pretenders will not sit on that throne."

SLC_scw_call_up_police:0 "Call up the Garrisons"
SLC_scw_call_up_police_desc:0 "The opening months of the civil war have proven that our troops stationed in local garrisons are a largely unnecessary measure. The Zwahile accepts our rule on the understanding that we will keep their lives stable and safe, which means that the military police would serve them better on the front than in the streets."

SLC_scw_reignite_forges:0 "Rekindle the Old Forges"
SLC_scw_reignite_forges_desc:0 "Despite its lacking industrial development, the Zwahile coast served as a key part of the Storm King’s supply chain during his conquests of western and northern Zebrica. It is high time we modernised the old weaponsmithing facilities and set them to work supporting the war effort. They will be ready to serve, again."

SLC_scw_uzerasi_connections:0 "Our Uzerasi Connections"
SLC_scw_uzerasi_connections_desc:0 "The Uzerasi family are simultaneously our greatest allies and our worst enemies. They successfully fought against the Mazwi before the Storm King demolished both kingdoms in one fell swoop, but Icepaw saw the value in local help. The connections and friends she made half a decade ago now have their own role to play in the civil war."

SLC_scw_unearth_old_weapons:0 "Buried Stockpiles"
SLC_scw_unearth_old_weapons_desc:0 "When the Storm King suddenly passed away, many divisions returning from the north of Zebrica buried their weapons in the Zwahile. Whilst this was mostly to avoid turning them over to the then unstable government, many low level officers respected Ibyz Icepaw and her foresight which drove a considerable number of them to disclose the locations of their caches. Waste not, want not."

SLC_scw_zwhaile_backbone:0 "The Zwahile Backbone"
SLC_scw_zwhaile_backbone_desc:0 "Despite the significant minority of yetis that has slowly emerged amongst the zebra population, the vast majority of the region’s businesses and overall wealth lies in the hooves of the Zwahile. Relying on their patronage will give them more power in the long term, but it is a necessary evil for the survival of the regime."

SLC_scw_occupation_backbone:0 "The Directorate's Efficiency"
SLC_scw_occupation_backbone_desc:0 "Though our zebra friends hold and generate a very large proportion of the directorate’s wealth, they have proven to be poor industrial organisers. They may not like the military stepping into their affairs, but they’re unlikely to complain about the jobs that new munition plants will provide."

SLC_scw_new_blood:0 "Trial by Fire"
SLC_scw_new_blood_desc:0 "When at war, field promotions at low levels are a necessity to maintain a competent chain of command. Officers rarely see combat however and as such the command structure often suffers in the long term unless new blood is brought into high level positions. Ibyz has marked several promising commanders for promotion to avoid such issues."

SLC_scw_acquire_production_materials:0 "Production Material Procurement"
SLC_scw_acquire_production_materials_desc:0 "Whilst the Zwahile lacks much in the way of urban development, some population centres like the Uzerasi city of Mzizima have used steel in the creation of new buildings for several years at this point. It will cause some discontent, but confiscating their construction materials for the war effort will benefit the directorate immensely in the long term."

SLC_scw_form_collaborator_divisions:0 "Form Collaborator Battalions"
SLC_scw_form_collaborator_divisions_desc:0 "Despite being ruled over by a foreign yeti field marshal, the Zwahile largely accepts its place as a part of an alien political entity as a guarantor of its own stability as it did with the Mazwi before our arrival. They value their way of life and are willing to fight for the autonomy that Icepaw has generously granted them, all they need is a willing officer to command them."

SLC_scw_military_industrial_complex_beginnings:0 "Military Production as an Industrial Model"
SLC_scw_military_industrial_complex_beginnings_desc:0 "Though there are dangers associated with embracing the military-industrial complex as a significant part of any economy, there are even more associated with ignoring it. Much of our existing industrial infrastructure is already built to supply the legions and expanding upon it is both a reliable and sensical method of broad industrialisation."

SLC_scw_call_into_the_caves:0 "Call Out Into the Caves"
SLC_scw_call_into_the_caves_desc:0 "There are few who understand the ways of storm creatures and even fewer that understand why they serve yeti leaders and rulers so willingly. Some observers compared their relationship with regular yetis to that of the Bronzehill dogs and Herzlander griffons during the Storm King’s conquest, though their fealty is not necessarily granted only to one family of monarchs. They will answer our call."

SLC_scw_reactivate_old_fortifications:0 "Reactivate Old Fortifications"
SLC_scw_reactivate_old_fortifications_desc:0 "The continued success of the Storm King was not a surefire thing. Icepaw - knowing that disaster would eventually strike, but not when - constructed defensive fortifications in Uzerasi family land half a decade ago, but they never saw use. Now however they may serve a purpose in the civil war, once they’re moved to the other side of a few rivers."

SLC_scw_live_fire_munitions_testing:0 "Premature Munitions Development"
SLC_scw_live_fire_munitions_testing_desc:0 "Before its reorganisation into a contender in the civil war, the directorate was given little besides the most basic equipment and designs to subdue the Zwahile. Unfortunately, the armed forces are no longer fighting peasants and require heavier ordinance; ordinance that can only have its effectiveness tested on the frontlines where malfunctions can and will result in civilian deaths."

SLC_scw_zwahile_penal_divisions:0 "Zwahile Correctional Divisions"
SLC_scw_zwahile_penal_divisions_desc:0 "Penal divisions are not a new concept, yet thus far Icepaw has avoided them as a method of waging war and punishing dissidents. Recently however, it has become apparent that more soldiers are needed and that prisoner conscription is a good source. Many zebras will be distressed by this particular policy change, but needs must."

SLC_scw_formalise_informant_groups:0 "Formalise Informant Organisations"
SLC_scw_formalise_informant_groups_desc:0 "We have run an extensive network of informants to keep a close eye on the Zwahile for many years now, but previously there was never a reason to further organise them. Now, with a hope to establish a new national government, creating an intelligence agency that functions in tandem with our existing network is a clear next step."

SLC_scw_equality_for_service:0 "Incentives to Engage"
SLC_scw_equality_for_service_desc:0 "Zwahile zebras have traditionally operated on subsistence farming in small family groups in largely rural areas. Whilst this has entirely negated the risk of regional nationalist movements, it also means that they contribute very little to the directorate’s growing economy. We will need to provide incentives if we wish to break the cycle."

SLC_scw_work_for_your_foals:0 "Work for your Foals"
SLC_scw_work_for_your_foals_desc:0 "Arms and ammunition are important, so important in fact that the questionable morals of employing zebras in production facilities for little to no pay can be overlooked. Needless to say that constructing and operating such factories will not be popular, but it may well be necessary."

SLC_scw_overzealous_aircraft_experimentation:0 "Overzealous Aircraft Experimentation"
SLC_scw_overzealous_aircraft_experimentation_desc:0 "Developing a modern stockpile of planes in the Zwahile was never a realistic proposition in the past; now however, heavy investments in such craft could give us a significant edge over the enemies of the kingdom. Unfortunately, bulldozing houses to create airfields near production facilities will not be popular."

SLC_scw_repurpose_siege_weaponry:0 "A New Generation of Siege Equipment"
SLC_scw_repurpose_siege_weaponry_desc:0 "Morale is an immensely important part of horizontal cohesion and incredibly large guns are a good way to bolster our own whilst shattering that of the enemy. It is regrettable that the easiest way to make them is by tearing up roads to remove and use large sewage pipes, but the benefits of doing so far outweigh the admittedly immense costs."

SLC_scw_for_the_good_of_all_yetis:0 "For the Good of All Yetis"
SLC_scw_for_the_good_of_all_yetis_desc:0 "There is a simple way to explain Icepaw’s motivation for fighting in this civil war. Between a tyrannical mage, a corrupt plutocrat and a loyal field marshal; who would the average yeti choose as a ruler? It is in the best interests of every yeti to support the directorate, lest they suffer further at the hands of an inept successor. Her victory is necessary."

SLC_scw_acquire_merchant_marine:0 "'Acquire' a Merchant Marine"
SLC_scw_acquire_merchant_marine_desc:0 "Despite the region’s lacking technological development, the Zwahile coast and the Uzerasi family in particular retain strong traditions of naval warfare and maritime trade. We would do well to requisition some of their vessels to support our war effort, though it goes without saying that many zebra sailors will be less-than-pleased by such a move."

SLC_scw_protect_skies:0 "Protect the Skies"
SLC_scw_protect_skies_desc:0 "Anti-aircraft weaponry has proven very dangerous to aircraft and aeroplanes alike, which makes it a worthwhile investment to protect our limited production facilities. The thunder of guns will be a reminder to the Zwahile that we protect them, no matter the cost."

SLC_scw_make_military_personable:0 "Give the Zebras a Smile"
SLC_scw_make_military_personable_desc:0 "When it comes to zebra-yeti relations, our kind have always struggled. Even the most elderly yeti towers over the average zebra which leaves them mildly intimidated at best and utterly terrified at worst. By sending military engineers on leave to help them in construction projects, we hope to reduce the perceived threat that our species poses to zebras."

SLC_scw_garrisons_into_schools:0 "Old Barracks, New Schools"
SLC_scw_garrisons_into_schools_desc:0 "The barracks belonging to the many military police divisions now serving on the front line have stood idle for some time despite their typically urban locations. Converting them into schools will be a worthwhile investment, even if it means we’ll need to build some new barracks later when the divisions return to their original stations."

SLC_scw_provide_relief:0 "Providing Food and Shelter"
SLC_scw_provide_relief_desc:0 "Many zebras have been left without basic amenities as a result of the civil war, either through displacement or simple destruction. This is an opportunity for the directorate, both to show the Zwahile how much we value their safety and to coax more creatures into working in state-owned businesses for the war effort."

SLC_scw_expand_zwahile_network:0 "Expand the Zwahile Network"
SLC_scw_expand_zwahile_network_desc:0 "Our intel gathering operations have never been so successful, both for collecting information on enemy positions and for keeping an eye on the Zwahile. Expanding operations to accommodate more aggressive intelligence acquisition and to facilitate future interests in the Great Lakes is a valuable investment and signifies the success of the MID."

SLC_scw_extend_military_engineer_role:0 "Extend the Role of Military Engineers"
SLC_scw_extend_military_engineer_role_desc:0 "Previously military engineers on leave were encouraged to volunteer in assisting civilian projects which has thus far been immensely beneficial for the directorate and the Zwahile as a whole. The next step is to use civilian projects as an integral part of engineer training, something that will benefit both the military and our zebra friends."

SLC_scw_one_last_drive:0 "One Last Recruitment Drive"
SLC_scw_one_last_drive_desc:0 "Recruitment is a difficult prospect when only about ten percent of your population fully supports your involvement in a long-winded civil conflict, but it is not impossible. Yeti and zebra alike understand the consequences of losing their chance at an even-tempered and intelligent ruler and are willing to fight for her with a little extra encouragement."

SLC_scw_icepaw_the_protector:0 "The Protector of the Zwahile"
SLC_scw_icepaw_the_protector_desc:0 "Despite the fact that yetis are seen by most zebras to be unwelcome guests, it is still possible to cultivate a positive reputation amongst them. Ibyz Icepaw is far from perfect, but she has protected the Zwahile and its interests in spite of the circumstances. For her efforts, she has earned considerable political clout in Uzerasi and Zwahile circles."



SLC_begin_reconstruction:0 "Begin the Reconstruction"
SLC_begin_reconstruction_desc:0 "Before looking outward and entirely restoring normalcy, the kingdom must undergo a period of careful reconstruction. The scars of the civil war are deep, the Zwahile grows restless and the many creatures within our borders worry about their future. Time must be taken to recover and set a course for the future prosperity of the Storm Kingdom."

SLC_prepare_the_east:0 "Prepare the East"
SLC_prepare_the_east_desc:0 "The east has long been an area of immense strategic value, all the more in recent times for the hyenas’ renewed interest in reclaiming their old territories. It is imperative that war infrastructure in the east is constructed to provide a reliable supply network, one that will double as civilian infrastructure once the hyenian threat has passed."

SLC_public_works_projects:0 "Public Works Projects"
SLC_public_works_projects_desc:0 "With a firm hold over what remains of the kingdom’s institutions, the first economic step in the reconstruction process is an obvious one. Political and economic infrastructure is a requirement for the workings of a modern nation state and the employment opportunities that such projects can provide will help in easing the woes of the people."

SLC_analyse_succession_war:0 "Analyse the Succession War"
SLC_analyse_succession_war_desc:0 "The succession war was - for all the pain and suffering that it caused - a fascinating conflict. It provided ample opportunity to develop our outdated strategies and tactics in a truly desperate scenario that warranted experimentation in all areas. In amongst the devastation, doubt and despair; the Storm Queen sees opportunity."

SLC_socioeconomic_studies:0 "Conduct a Socioeconomic Census"
SLC_socioeconomic_studies_desc:0 "It is impossible, or at least very challenging, to attempt a period of reconstruction and growth without the requisite knowledge of the creatures that you are supposed to be helping. A detailed series of censuses will be required to effectively assist and understand the current status and attitudes of the population."

SLC_put_down_dervishes:0 "Put Down the Dervishes"
SLC_put_down_dervishes_desc:0 "The time has come to put down the hyenian threat for good. With the Storm King and his utterly destructive methods out of the picture, a lasting peace where their culture persists under our rule is possible. Before we can consider our future rule however, we must consider the conquest itself."

SLC_rennovate_research_labs:0 "Renovate the Research Labs"
SLC_rennovate_research_labs_desc:0 "Much like the rest of the Rainband, His Majesty’s labs are out of date and in a state of disrepair beyond that. Conducting research under such conditions would yield little of value and so it shall be the goal of the Storm Queen and her coffers to restore and retrofit the state research department. Our kind shall one day be on the cutting edge once more."

SLC_combat_regionalism:0 "Combat the Regionalist Epidemic"
SLC_combat_regionalism_desc:0 "Whilst their objectives are understandable, regionalism in the modern day is a surefire way to bring about the downfall of a multicultural state such as the Storm Kingdom. Snuffing out this resistance to centralised rule from the Eye, be it perpetrated by particularly stubborn yetis or any other creature, is a matter of critical importance."

SLC_restore_heartland:0 "Restore the Rainband"
SLC_restore_heartland_desc:0 "Whilst we greatly appreciate the assistance of the Uzerasi and their Zwahile kin, the Rainband is the heart of [SLC.GetNameDef] and requires our immediate attention. The reforms implemented in the west during the civil war shall additionally be applied there  and the enterprises of those that worked with the three traitors are to be expropriated."

SLC_reward_zebra_subjects:0 "The Zwahile's Just Reward"
SLC_reward_zebra_subjects_desc:0 "For its diligent service and immense contribution to the monumental task that was victory in the civil war, the Zwahile is to be awarded the first and largest batch of grants and contracts. They have proven their worth to the Storm Kingdom and will no doubt do so again with this immense influx of resources."

SLC_rapid_urbanisation:0 "Rapid Urbanisation"
SLC_rapid_urbanisation_desc:0 "For how impressive its legions once were, the Storm Kingdom remained a largely unindustrialised state under the rule of His Majesty. As our economy expands and factories emerge, it is imperative that we facilitate movement from rural backwaters into the cities in order to support a sustainable rate of growth."

SLC_roll_out_the_armour:0 "Roll out the Armour"
SLC_roll_out_the_armour_desc:0 "Much as airships captured the imagination of the Storm King, so too do tanks enrapture the Storm Queen. Whilst our first attempts at creating prototype vehicles have been without immediate success, the steel behemoths that were developed in the process have proven rather intimidating when included in parades."

SLC_keep_army_zebras_happy:0 "Give Them a Reason to Stay"
SLC_keep_army_zebras_happy_desc:0 "Whilst our Zwahile soldiers are well paid, they still believe that they fight for a regime that is not their own. If we wish to expand our pool of recruits, it is imperative that we offer them opportunities once their deployments are over and reward their dutiful service in the armed forces."

SLC_send_zebras_home_awhile:0 "Let Them See Their Foals"
SLC_send_zebras_home_awhile_desc:0 "Though quite the opposite of a solution to our already strained recruitment pool, granting a period of additional leave to our Zwahile soldiers should help them to see the Storm Queen in a favourable light. Allowing them to return home for a time will also have considerable economic benefits as they proliferate the many practical skills they will have learned in the armed forces."

SLC_dervish_war_infrastructure:0 "Dervish War infrastructure"
SLC_dervish_war_infrastructure_desc:0 "During his rampage, the Storm King operated small networks of supply airships that would ferry resources at relatively great speeds over any and all obstacles. Among other factors, this one is proof that infrastructure has the capacity to greatly ease the burden of war on the state and its creatures. Whilst there are now more efficient ways to transport  materiel, the need for infrastructure remains constant."

SLC_retain_occupation_practices:0 "Retain Occupation Practices"
SLC_retain_occupation_practices_desc:0 "Though the disparate creatures of the realm each have their strengths and weaknesses, experience has shown the Storm Queen that the safety and prosperity of yetis is best secured with current methods. Officialising laws that formalise the second class status of non-yetis is sure to displease many, including Imamu; but it is for the good of the kingdom’s core constituents."

SLC_begin_equalization:0 "Begin to Equalise the Races"
SLC_begin_equalization_desc:0 "Take time as it may, slow progress towards equality between the many races within our borders is demonstrably the best choice for the longevity of the kingdom. Cooperation fosters only further cooperation in a positive feedback loop, generating immense capital for the state over time and social cohesion to boot."

SLC_commander_reevaluations:0 "Commander Reassessments"
SLC_commander_reevaluations_desc:0 "There is never a better moment to train than in peacetime. The Storm King may have appreciated the value of surprise and subterfuge, but he did not use his resources effectively; relying on a single strategy that ultimately failed him at a crucial juncture. Our general staff will not be so naive, taking the opportunity that peace provides to broaden their abilities."

SLC_jobs_for_compliance:0 "Well-Paid Work for Compliance"
SLC_jobs_for_compliance_desc:0 "An occupation must provide occupations. There is no greater asset available to a collaborationist regime than the ability to provide employment opportunities and receive compliance in return. Those that cooperate are rewarded and encouraged to continue cooperating, whilst those that do not grow to envy those that do. It is the division and conquest of a society."

SLC_eye_becomes_university:0 "Give the Eye New Purpose"
SLC_eye_becomes_university_desc:0 "The Eye of the Storm was constructed as a vanity project that served no real purpose by the time it was finished. His Majesty’s authority was absolute and the island fortress was redundant upon arrival. It is not without potential, however. The Storm Queen wishes to convert the ageing fortress into a state university, one that will greatly improve the academic capacity of the kingdom."

SLC_one_irrevocable_reform:0 "One Irrevocable Reform"
SLC_one_irrevocable_reform_desc:0 "The practice of slavery is not only morally questionable at best, but it is economically detrimental. Slaves do not contribute to the economy via taxes, nor do they have any educational opportunities that would otherwise serve to increase our skilled labour pool. None can deny the will of the Storm Queen in freeing those bound to service by force."

SLC_factory_work_for_the_able:0 "Factory Work for the Able"
SLC_factory_work_for_the_able_desc:0 "Though not exactly ideal in terms of working conditions, factories provide many low-skill jobs that can be filled by currently unemployed creatures. As an added bonus, a larger and considerably more diverse workforce will allow for innovation within the many emerging industries that should aid in work accessibility and productivity."

SLC_extend_our_reach:0 "Extend Our Reach"
SLC_extend_our_reach_desc:0 "Whilst the airforce no longer requires absurdly large hangars in which to store and prepare airships, in turn there are very few plane-ready airfields in the kingdom. Expanding our deployment capabilities will be greatly beneficial in coming conflicts and air power will be immensely helpful in rooting out some of the more problematic regionalist groups."

SLC_as_with_zwahile_as_with_dervishes:0 "Repeat the Western Strategy"
SLC_as_with_zwahile_as_with_dervishes_desc:0 "The Storm Queen’s years of ruling the Zwahile have proven useful in many ways. Whilst it provided a springboard from which to reunite the kingdom, it also provided a pivotal learning experience for Her Majesty. Efficient and ‘clean’ imperialism can be quite difficult, but there are always some strategies that can be reused from place to place with minimal modification."

SLC_our_true_focus:0 "Our True Focus"
SLC_our_true_focus_desc:0 "War has paved the way for many of yetikind’s technological developments. Chief amongst them being His Majesty’s beloved airships, which were unfortunately rendered obsolete in a period of mere years. Nevertheless, it is only prudent that the military receives the majority of research and development funding; their innovations will spill over into wider society in no time."

SLC_secure_balanced_research_budget:0 "Securing a Balanced Research Budget"
SLC_secure_balanced_research_budget_desc:0 "Much to the pleasure of our academic bodies, it has been decided that additional research funding will be distributed equally amongst all sectors. Whilst the military is somewhat disappointed, they too will receive an additional - if limited - stipend for their research budget. Any minor complaints that they may have can be safely ignored."

SLC_military_industrial_directorate:0 "Military Industrial Directorate"
SLC_military_industrial_directorate_desc:0 "Our economy has worked in tandem with the military machine since we embraced the industrial revolution. It is only natural that the civilian economy evolves to be even further entwined with military production and that an internal restructuring of the overseeing body is organised to facilitate both sectors functioning as one."

SLC_maintain_the_effort:0 "Keep Up the Civilian Support"
SLC_maintain_the_effort_desc:0 "It is the duty of the armed forces to protect the civilians and their way of life, not to intrude upon them. We will continue to encourage cooperation with the military, but in accordance with the original principles of our ‘Helping Hand’ policy. The Storm Queen would have failed in her duties if the armed forces were to take precedent over the creatures of the realm."

SLC_modern_storm_creature_role:0 "The Modern Role of Storm Creatures"
SLC_modern_storm_creature_role_desc:0 "Storm creatures in the army have been having somewhat of an identity crisis as to their formal role at the tactical level. His Majesty had them serve as his personal bodyguard, but the Storm Queen has no intention to waste their immense potential in that fashion. Their purpose will be that of shock troops which will provide breakthroughs for attached infantry to exploit."

SLC_lay_dervishes_to_rest:0 "Lay the Dogs to Rest"
SLC_lay_dervishes_to_rest_desc:0 "Though they may still dream quietly of freedom, the hyenas are now seemingly content with our rule. Their religion is permitted, their customs allowed to persist and their territories are to be administered as core parts of the kingdom. With only this, we have accomplished a feat that the Storm King could not; a lasting peace between hyenas and yetis."

SLC_onwards_and_upwards:0 "Onwards and Upwards"
SLC_onwards_and_upwards_desc:0 "The kingdom has suffered much and endured that which would shatter a weaker people, but it has persisted in spite of the chaos that His Majesty bequeathed to the people. With the reconstruction largely over, we can confidently move towards a better future for yetikind."

SLC_diversify_and_specialise:0 "Service Assimilation"
SLC_diversify_and_specialise_desc:0 "Whilst a warlike society may have its issues, it is not entirely without merit. Service in the armed forces is an opportunity to learn about and accept those that serve alongside you, yeti or otherwise. As the kingdom’s continued existence proves, bonds forged of blood and iron are not so easily broken."



SLC_continental_collab:0 "The Directorate of Continental Affairs"
SLC_continental_collab_desc:0 "Whilst its main functions will be primarily civilian in nature, the overall purpose of the DCA lies somewhere between civilian and military. Its job shall be to handle foreign affairs, a task that encompasses strategic planning and realpolitik as well as comparatively minor trade negotiations and state immigration policies."

SLC_assessing_interenational_position:0 "Assessing Our International Position"
SLC_assessing_interenational_position_desc:0 "To say that our kind is isolated from the rest of the world would be an incredible understatement. He may have been a military genius, but His Majesty failed to recognise the long term damage that he was doing to his people’s reputation. Much of Zebrica despises us, refusing to even speak with our diplomats; we must find a way to resolve this."

SLC_instate_advisory_bodies:0 "Instate the Minority Advisory Bodies"
SLC_instate_advisory_bodies_desc:0 "Whilst the Storm Queen will remain the ultimate authority over all state and military matters, she recognises her own limitations. A yeti is not best equipped to dictate matters regarding zebras and hyenas without help and thus the minority advisory bodies are to be created. A council of creatures from their unique walks of life that are to advise the Storm Queen on policy."

SLC_establish_regional_schools:0 "The Queen Protects Even the Destitute"
SLC_establish_regional_schools_desc:0 "Though much has been done to restore the kingdom’s economy, many of Her Majesty’s subjects remain destitute or in a dire financial position. In an effort to align the people and further develop the kingdom, the Storm Queen has generously agreed to front significant poverty relief costs out of her own coffers for the foreseeable future."

SLC_reunite_hayzeb_zebras:0 "Reuniting the Hayzeb Zebras"
SLC_reunite_hayzeb_zebras_desc:0 "The zebras inhabiting Upper Hayzeb are much like those that live in the Zwahile in that they have been under our thumb for quite some time. What sets them apart from their idealistic Lower Hayzeb kin is a mere border. If we cross that line in the sand, thoroughly crush their upstart ‘Queen’ and the surrounding states then they may one day be just as docile as the Zwahile zebras too."

SLC_formulate_defence_plan:0 "A Formal Defence Policy"
SLC_formulate_defence_plan_desc:0 "Those that had heard of the Storm King knew what his attitude towards diplomacy was: Invade first, raid second and ask questions later. In the modern geopolitical climate, it is imperative that we not relapse into His Majesty’s old habits so that we can be considered trustworthy business partners; or even potentially allies. A formal defence policy is absolutely necessary."

SLC_facilitate_continental_development:0 "Facilitating Continental Development"
SLC_facilitate_continental_development_desc:0 "As we have come to learn, much of Southern Zebrica is economically underdeveloped in comparison to other regions. It is clear that rapid development must begin in order to ensure economic competitiveness amongst the many peoples that we govern on the continent. "

SLC_sideline_uzerasi:0 "Sideline the Uzerasi"
SLC_sideline_uzerasi_desc:0 "Their help in the civil war and reconstruction period was appreciated, but the Uzerasi no longer represent an interest group of particular influence. Their once immense sway is now little more than the favouritism we give them, and so they shall take a seat in the minority advisory bodies like all the rest."

SLC_eliminate_great_laker_threats:0 "Dealing with the Desert Dwellers"
SLC_eliminate_great_laker_threats_desc:0 "[CZR.GetNameDefCap] sits upon perhaps the most defensible territory in all of Southern Zebrica. They are uniquely located on the northernmost inhabitable land south of the Zebhara, giving them particularly defensible territory that is highly desirable. The time has come to deal with them and secure their land for the security of the kingdom."

SLC_indiscriminate_recruitment_intellectuals:0 "Indiscriminate Intellectual Recruitment"
SLC_indiscriminate_recruitment_intellectuals_desc:0 "We cannot be fussy when it comes to talent. Zebras and hyenas may be relatively deficient in muscle mass, but they are just as capable as our best scientists in the lab. We must offer all with the appropriate credentials an opportunity to serve the Storm Queen in science if we are to continue this period of unprecedented societal and industrial progress."

SLC_minimum_living_standard_continent:0 "A Minimum Standard of Living on The Continent"
SLC_minimum_living_standard_continent_desc:0 "It is imperative that our non-yeti subjects receive equal treatment when it comes to standard of living. Those that have not enough for themselves are not productive citizens of the kingdom, rendering their work inefficient and their tax contributions minimal at best. The time has come to introduce and enforce a series of industrial and homeowner audits to protect the productive."

SLC_reaching_out:0 "Reaching Out to the Khan"
SLC_reaching_out_desc:0 "Kurstanbek Khan owes his recent unification and conquests in large part to His Majesty’s invasion which weakened his two Hestrayan rivals. Whilst he and the new Storm Queen are yet to establish any significant diplomatic overtures, there is a good chance that he would be willing to cooperate with us in a defensive or even offensive alliance."

SLC_efficient_extraction_methods:0 "Develop Efficient Extraction Methods"
SLC_efficient_extraction_methods_desc:0 "Resource extraction is a significant part of the kingdom’s regional economies and - more importantly - where most of the Rainband investment from yeti benefactors goes to. We would do well to develop new technologies that would allow such enterprises to operate at an even greater efficiency."

SLC_protect_regional_traditions:0 "Protect Regional Traditions"
SLC_protect_regional_traditions_desc:0 "Our tolerance for the multitudinous cultures that make up southern Zebrica has come as quite a surprise to many of our subjects, but they still fear our interference. The time has come to enshrine certain regional traditions - within reason - for each of the kingdom’s unique creatures. We shall not squander our victories, this time."

SLC_third_advisory_body:0 "The Third Advisory Body"
SLC_third_advisory_body_desc:0 "A considerable number of Hayzeb zebras have lived within the kingdom’s borders for many years, but until recently we have not held sway over the entirety of their population. Given that our war against the Great Laker states was waged on the grounds of reuniting the Hayzeb, it is only right that they receive representation for their compliance. A fine example they shall serve as."

SLC_secure_northern_buffer_regions:0 "Securing the Northern Buffer Regions"
SLC_secure_northern_buffer_regions_desc:0 "Though they are compliant and well rewarded for their service, much of the Great Lakes serves primarily as an enormous buffer region that protects the core territories of the kingdom. With this in mind, their annexation into the realm proper will not necessitate a lengthy process of cultural assimilation; merely economic and infrastructural integration."

SLC_low_interest_industrial_grants:0 "Low Interest Industrial Grants"
SLC_low_interest_industrial_grants_desc:0 "To say that the great lakes and much of the continental interior is underdeveloped would be quite an understatement. Though the primary goal of our renewed expansionism is security, it would be prudent for the state to provide low-risk grants; drastically accelerating initial industrial and technological developments on the continent."

SLC_divert_laker_ire:0 "Diverting the Ire of the Lakes"
SLC_divert_laker_ire_desc:0 "Ovingoland was yet another product of the Storm King’s rampage across the continent, created in concept by the refugees fleeing the Great Lakes from his wrath. They were not spared of course, as he soon traveled north and crushed the Maregyptians that had agreed to protect them. We shall reunite the Ovingo zebras with their Great Laker kin, as is our right."

SLC_rapprochement_ancient_pact:0 "Attempt Diplomacy With the Pact"
SLC_rapprochement_ancient_pact_desc:0 "War with the ancient pact is not a desirable outcome for the Storm Queen. In an ideal world, His Majesty would not have caused the loss of the Cornerstone and angered the centaurs so; sadly such is the reality we must face. We will attempt diplomacy with the pact and mobilize for war, knowing what the centaur response will be."

SLC_cooperation_through_capital:0 "Cooperation Through Capital"
SLC_cooperation_through_capital_desc:0 "Money is quite a motivator; for some it is enough to serve, but for most it is merely enough to look the other way. Fortunately, this is exactly what we are after. Well-paid labour tends not to pick fights with the local government and - by not opposing the state - helps to maintain the new status quo. State infrastructure projects have never been so beneficial."

SLC_laker_steel_monopolies:0 "State Monopolies on Great Laker Steel"
SLC_laker_steel_monopolies_desc:0 "Though it will no doubt frustrate some of the more traditional elements within the Great Lakes, the steel industry is of critical importance to the kingdom’s civilian and military sectors. It is imperative that the state purchases and secures production of such a vital material before regional competitors begin to crop up."

SLC_wealth_of_arabian_sea:0 "The Wealth of the Arabian Sea"
SLC_wealth_of_arabian_sea_desc:0 "The South Sea is - to be blunt - almost entirely unprofitable. The frigid southern temperatures make it difficult to traverse for approximately half of the year and we have already assimilated the previous regional trade hubs controlled by the Uzerasi. Procuring access to the Arabian Sea will allow us to circumvent many of the disadvantages posed by our problematic geography. "

SLC_exploit_peninsular_forests:0 "Exploit the Forests of the Peninsula"
SLC_exploit_peninsular_forests_desc:0 "A sizeable percentage of forest area in southern Senturya is almost inhospitable for a number of reasons, meaning that many safe wooded regions have also been left untouched out of fear. This presents an opportunity for the kingdom, both economic and political; to prove that we can safeguard the centaurs against some of the strange forests whilst providing strategically critical resources."

SLC_avoiding_another_cornerstone:0 "Avoiding Another Cornerstone Incident"
SLC_avoiding_another_cornerstone_desc:0 "The Cornerstone’s loss has entirely eroded any chance of any assimilation of centaurs and gargoyles into the kingdom proper. To directly administer their territories would be a foolish and dangerous endeavour, leaving the Storm Queen with one course of action. A nominally independent union state of the two creatures shall be allowed to govern the region. May they one day forgive us."

SLC_horse_limited_self_rule:0 "Allow the Horses Limited Self-Rule"
SLC_horse_limited_self_rule_desc:0 "Unlike the Great Lakes, direct control of Risea grants us little real benefit. Our primary reason for invasion was to secure efficient trade routes through the Arabian Sea, which can be maintained through a nominally independent union state without expending massive amounts of materiel. The horses can govern themselves, so long as they serve the kingdom’s interests."

SLC_royal_research_committee:0 "The Two Seas Trade"
SLC_royal_research_committee_desc:0 "With access to both the Southern and Arabian Seas, it has become much cheaper and easier to transport goods around the continent. A ship to Zouala and a train ride to Tenkozogo bypasses Hestraya entirely and eliminates any risk of winter ice stalling trade in the Southern Straits. Needless to say that our efforts are already beginning to bear fruit."

SLC_continental_coexistence_charter:0 "The Continental Coexistence Charter"
SLC_continental_coexistence_charter_desc:0 "An invasion will always galvanise the invaded to fight as one against the invader, but that unity rarely lasts after either a victory or a defeat. To ensure that those we have conquered now coexist peacefully, the Storm Queen has devised a series of laws for the express purpose of guaranteeing peace between the various disparate creatures of the continent."

SLC_unfettered_growth:0 "Unfettered Growth"
SLC_unfettered_growth_desc:0 "It is no mistake that the laws for business operations on the continent are so lax. It is for those that we protect to decide how to invest and grow their own industries; less red tape means faster growth, albeit at the expense of good working conditions. Fortunately this has the side effect of pitting the working zebras against their own elites, rather than against us."

SLC_reforms_collab:0 "The Icepaw Reforms"
SLC_reforms_collab_desc:0 "A strong hand, a set of intelligent advisors and a little luck was capable of uniting the disparate yeti species in but a few years; at least to the extent that His Majesty considered necessary. The reality of his legacy is that a strong military legacy has resulted in an underbaked and exploitative political system that leaves the average yeti with very little. The time for change is now."

SLC_diverting_from_sk_methods:0 "Diverting From His Majesty's Methods"
SLC_diverting_from_sk_methods_desc:0 "Whilst the military is important, it should not be the focus of this or any society. The Storm Queen recognises the necessity of His Majesty’s methods, but knows equally that the ends of security do not necessarily justify the means of overwhelming force. There are other - far less dangerous - ways to give one’s subjects a sense of unity and pride."

SLC_queen_protects_destitute:0 "Establish Regional State Schools"
SLC_queen_protects_destitute_desc:0 "Since the kingdom’s first successful wars, there has been a significant non-yeti population within our borders. Unfortunately His Majesty knew not what to do with these lands besides pillage, leaving us to pick up the pieces. The monarchy and the state shall take the burden of regional education upon itself, for the betterment of the Storm Kingdom and its many peoples."

SLC_creation_nation_state:0 "The Creation of a Nation State"
SLC_creation_nation_state_desc:0 "Unification through violence is easy and quick, but it is rarely a recipe for long term success; to even look at the remnants of the Griffonian Empire on a map is to understand that. A nation state requires a shared language, a shared history of suffering and successes and an unifying identity. The Storm Queen alone has the power to shape and cement such an identity."

SLC_monarchy_aligned_people:0 "A Monarchy Aligned with its People"
SLC_monarchy_aligned_people_desc:0 "Many monarchs see their position as a privilege afforded to them by birthright, but His Majesty proved that the opposite was true. A ruler that leaves chaos in their wake will be replaced by another that understands the responsibilities of the role. The monarch is an ally of the creatures they rule, not an unaccountable maniac that can do as they please."

SLC_sorting_succession:0 "Settling the Succession"
SLC_sorting_succession_desc:0 "Perhaps the greatest failure of the Storm King was that he did not select a successor, nor did he attempt to outline the process for others to do so in his absence. It is unlikely that the presence of an heir would have prevented or even slowed the scheming of his advisors, but the law of succession should nevertheless be written. The fewer things that can go wrong, the better."

SLC_evaluate_force_monopoly:0 "Evaluate Our Monopoly on Force"
SLC_evaluate_force_monopoly_desc:0 "The armed forces and the monarchy by extension have held a complete monopoly on force since His Majesty united our people. Out of the former sprang police units, albeit that they were essentially just a branch of the military that exercised force about as freely. It is high time we audited these formations and developed proper low-level law enforcement strategies."

SLC_royal_network_institutes:0 "The Royal Network of Institutes"
SLC_royal_network_institutes_desc:0 "Though the Rainband is not especially well known for its academic institutions, it does contain several universities that produce many talented specialists year-on-year. In the past they were encouraged to compete with designs for military hardware in return for absurd grants, but that limited their capacity. Instead they will now work together, under the purview of the RNI."

SLC_her_majestys_industry:0 "Her Majesty's Heavy Industry"
SLC_her_majestys_industry_desc:0 "Though some may protest the idea that government subsidies are necessary or even worthwhile, there are certain industries that require them. Public services and heavy industry in particular may not always be profitable, but they are necessary for other businesses to thrive and for our national productivity to remain high."

SLC_demil_rainband_police:0 "Demilitarising the Rainband Police"
SLC_demil_rainband_police_desc:0 "Though substantial reorganisation has taken place, the police force remains heavily militarised. It is the Storm Queen’s wish to gradually demilitarise the police across the kingdom to build trust in the state and in the monarchy. Besides, there’s no good reason for a police detachment to have an artillery brigade in tow."

SLC_resources_in_hyenia:0 "Develop Resource Industries in Hyenia"
SLC_resources_in_hyenia_desc:0 "Hyenia - like all places that diamond dogs inhabit - is resource rich. It is no surprise that their exports of material already make up for a considerable amount of the kingdom’s economy, which is why we must play to their strengths. With additional funding and proper mining machinery they will be able to further expand their operations."

SLC_capacity_for_autarky:0 "Capacity for Autarky, Preference of Trade"
SLC_capacity_for_autarky_desc:0 "Whilst closing off the economy to the outside world would - in theory - allow the nation to operate without any sort of assistance, doing so would be foolish. Instead the monarchy will devote funding to stockpiling certain strategic resources whilst planning for worst-case diplomatic scenarios. Even when such a situation arises, we’ll have nothing to worry about."

SLC_bathe_kingdom_in_light:0 "Bathe the Kingdom in Electric Light"
SLC_bathe_kingdom_in_light_desc:0 "Whilst much of the kingdom has an acceptable level of urban development, almost all of it lacks proper electrification; save perhaps the most developed of cities. It is absolutely imperative that we grant additional resources to all of the regional districts for wiring and lighting, allowing all of the Storm Queen’s subjects to enjoy a better and brighter standard of living."

SLC_favour_small_home_businesses:0 "Favour Small Businesses at Home"
SLC_favour_small_home_businesses_desc:0 "Massive corporate enterprises played a not insignificant part in the fracturing of the kingdom once, and they won't be allowed to do so again. The influence of Hailstorm’s glorified propaganda enterprise was a threat that few saw arising until it was too late. High corporate taxes for large companies and grants for new businesses should help with competitiveness."

SLC_directorate_national_infrastructure:0 "The Directorate of National Infrastructure"
SLC_directorate_national_infrastructure_desc:0 "Infrastructure - roads and trains in particular - is of vital importance to the productivity of the economy and the wellbeing of our subjects. Not only do both allow for the transportation of goods and materials but they also provide transport access for the population which opens up more cost efficient travel for leisure and for work."

SLC_reinvest_in_citizens:0 "Reinvesting in the Citizenry"
SLC_reinvest_in_citizens_desc:0 "Whilst Southern Zebrica is relatively sparsely populated, housing that is up to current economic and societal standards is still relatively difficult to come by. Large new housing estates for the middle classes and economically efficient highrises for the lowest common denominator should help to uplift those still dealing with substandard living conditions."

SLC_firm_fair_legal_code:0 "Constructing a Firm but Fair Legal Code"
SLC_firm_fair_legal_code_desc:0 "To say that the current laws of the kingdom were rushed into usage would be quite an understatement. His Majesty cared little for the intricacies of law and as such the legal system as a whole is in a state of tremendous strain and general confusion. It is absolutely imperative that we rebuild the kingdom’s legal code from the ground up."

SLC_never_another_hailstorm:0 "Never Another Hailstorm"
SLC_never_another_hailstorm_desc:0 "Hailstorm was a very intelligent yeti, intelligent enough to realise and abuse the power that his immense wealth gave him. The civil war proved that money is a dangerous thing and the Storm Queen wishes to make sure it can never hold such sway in affairs again. New regulations, checks and upward accountability measures should ensure that governors and civil servants stay in line."

SLC_creatures_strength:0 "The Strengths of the Kingdom's Creatures"
SLC_creatures_strength_desc:0 "Though the national identity of the kingdom is primarily centred around yetis, the kin of the Storm Queen are not a majority of the kingdom’s population. We must take our cultural diversity in stride and make the best of our subjects’ unique skills and abilities. Our diversity does not infringe upon our unity, it only makes us stronger."

SLC_protecting_mountains:0 "Special Protections for the Mountains"
SLC_protecting_mountains_desc:0 "The storm creatures have always been possessive of their cavernous homes. Whether they are simply protective over where they raise their young or if there is some religious significance to their abodes, they have a right to their heritage like all of us. It is our duty to protect their traditions and their homes, as they protect the kingdom when they are needed."

SLC_great_zebrican_summit:0 "The Great Zebrican Summit"
SLC_great_zebrican_summit_desc:0 "It is no surprise that after a half decade of continental chicanery the kingdom is diplomatically isolated. The Storm Queen has decided that we must go far out of our way to normalise relations with those that unjustly suffered His Majesty’s wrath. We shall host a great summit and invite all to see how much has changed and how far we’ve come!"

SLC_hiring_storm_creatures:0 "Encourage the Hiring of Storm Creatures"
SLC_hiring_storm_creatures_desc:0 "A lot of businesses both big and small are understandably hesitant to hire giant muscular monsters that won't or can’t talk. The Storm Queen has mandated the creation of a government subsidy that will make it significantly cheaper for companies to recruit and pay storm creatures. The hope is that - with a little time - they’ll be just as competitive in the job market as any other race."

SLC_progress_innovation:0 "The Royal Research Committee"
SLC_progress_innovation_desc:0 "As with the RNI, the Royal Research Committee's purpose is to encourage collaboration on long-winded or expensive research projects. Unlike the RNI however, the RRC will function more as a management body to link together universities beyond the Rainband; including those in our client states."

SLC_tamed_regulation:0 "Innovation and Regulation"
SLC_tamed_regulation_desc:0 "With any new invention comes a lot of excitement and - if the excitement turns out to be warranted - a lot of investment. What many fail to realise is that innovation is rarely a purely positive thing and regulations must be put in place to ensure that redundancies are accounted for, safety measures are in place and the proper training has been supplied to the workforce."

SLC_right_to_petition:0 "The Right to Petition"
SLC_right_to_petition_desc:0 "Whilst it is important to maintain the authority of the crown over the whims of those who cannot see beyond their own interests, a monarch cannot know everything. Granting the right to petition to all will likely fill the Storm Queen’s desk for a few months; but as time passes she will have access to the greatest catalogue of perceived and real problems in the kingdom."

SLC_codify_regional_liberties:0 "Codify Regional Liberties"
SLC_codify_regional_liberties_desc:0 "Though it is customary to respect the traditions of the land that a creature may find themselves in, the kingdom’s non-yeti regions are yet to receive any explicit cultural protections. This will - courtesy of the Storm Queen herself - be rectified as soon as possible. As the storm creatures deserve such protections, so do all of the kingdom’s peoples."

SLC_enabling_home:0 "An Enabling Home Economy"
SLC_enabling_home_desc:0 "Unlike the relatively unencumbered industries of the continent, the economy of our core territories is well kempt and well regulated. The kingdom exists and persists for the Storm Queen’s subjects and not for power hungry oligarchs or corporate interests. At home, there is always a provision for you; yeti, hyena or zebra."

SLC_kingdom_to_last:0 "A Kingdom to Last"
SLC_kingdom_to_last_desc:0 "We have succeeded where His Majesty failed in all important respects. Most of all however, the Storm Queen has created a political system, an economy and a society that will last beyond her; even beyond her son. There will not be another civil war. There will be no more strife. There will be prosperity, peace and stability."

SLC_his_majesty_never_could:0 "A Victory Over His Legacy"
SLC_his_majesty_never_could_desc:0 "Though grudges remain and work always needs to be done, the Storm Queen is finally free from the shadow of her predecessor. In spite of the innumerable challenges presented by his legacy, Ibyz Icepaw remains; determined and strong as ever.\n\nLong may the Storm Queen Reign!"



SLC_teaching_zwahile:0 "Teaching the Zwahile Its Place"
SLC_teaching_zwahile_desc:0 "The rebellion of the Uzerasi and their misguided followers threw a significantly sized wrench in Her Majesty’s plans for the kingdom. For their betrayal they shall be reminded of what happens to those that stand in the way of this world’s greatest conquerors. Their martyrs will soon have nobody left to revere them."

SLC_economic_globalism:0 "Embrace Economic Globalisation"
SLC_economic_globalism_desc:0 "The Storm King and his advisors saw great potential in soft power through economics, although neither managed to grasp the magnitude of their own achievements. If we cannot redeem ourselves in the eyes of the world, then we shall become such an integral part of it that none would dare try to remove us."

SLC_merely_formality:0 "Merely a Formality"
SLC_merely_formality_desc:0 "Her Majesty’s collaborationist network has all but vanished in the wake of the western revolt, leaving us with no choice but to cement a new doctrine. Recent events have proven that giving the ungrateful too much power is simply dangerous, leaving us with little choice other than to deal with our more unruly subjects with heavy hands."

SLC_unimpeded_extraction:0 "Unimpeded Extraction Operations"
SLC_unimpeded_extraction_desc:0 "To facilitate Her Majesty’s new plans for the kingdom, it is imperative that our resource extraction industries operate always at maximum efficiency. Without our exports, our great nation will be as insignificant as it was for the brief period between monarchs; when the world forgot about the terror a yeti could instil."

SLC_political_command:0 "Her Majesty's Great Task"
SLC_political_command_desc:0 "A monarch has the responsibility and privilege of leading their people and their nation as a whole into greatness. Despite all the struggles, Her Majesty has succeeded in navigating through the mess of traitors and incompetent ministers. In her great task she continues to succeed and shows no signs of faltering, at least for now."

SLC_begin_meep:0 "Begin the MEEP"
SLC_begin_meep_desc:0 "The Military Engineer Electrification Project is an extension of previous military-industrial outreach projects that seeks to provide cheap electricity to the vast majority of the kingdom’s population. Not only will it increase the standard of living all over the kingdom, but it will provide a very hardy power network that can be built upon for years to come."

SLC_great_task:0 "The Political Chain of Command"
SLC_great_task_desc:0 "The Storm King’s lackeys have proven time and time again that ‘politics’ are a farce and that the administration of a state is better left to those with military discipline. The provisional directorate will not return, but its methods of bureaucracy through the military command structure certainly shall; for they are the only appropriate solution."

SLC_highcliffs_chemical:0 "The Highcliffs Chemical Warfare Institute"
SLC_highcliffs_chemical_desc:0 "Chemical warfare is a dirty business on the battlefield, but in the lab it is quite the opposite. A new university shall greatly expand our pool of capable scientists whilst providing insights into the uses of new chemicals of all varieties in a military context. Perhaps not the most desirable of places to get a scholarship for, but students will never pass on such opportunities."

SLC_crush_crimson:0 "Crush the Crimson Troublemakers"
SLC_crush_crimson_desc:0 "Ravakh Cloudcracker and his pitiful little band of blind officers tried and failed to stage a coup that might well have felled the monarchy. He has thus far escaped punishment thanks to a lack of resources, but the existential threat his movement poses has not been forgotten. It is high time his treason was punished, and Her Majesty is not feeling generous."

SLC_restore_staff:0 "Restore the Crippled Staff"
SLC_restore_staff_desc:0 "Thanks to the effected rebellion and the foiled red officer coup, our general staff is looking worse for wear. Fortunately, both events have given rise to promising new leaders that should more than make up for the loss of talented commanders that defected to the reds or the zebras. This time we will place loyalty above all else."

SLC_export_acquisitions:0 "Expediting Export Acquisitions"
SLC_export_acquisitions_desc:0 "With a firm economic bedrock established, the time has come to further tune and entrench our export mechanisms in order to place our kingdom at the heart of the world’s ebb and flow. Of course, many will not be able to stomach us; but with time and effort they will come to see that they cannot find what we offer anywhere else."

SLC_immediate_problems:0 "The Most Immediate Problems"
SLC_immediate_problems_desc:0 "The Great Lakes are a hotbed of instability and represent perhaps the single greatest threat to the future of the kingdom, now that our internal issues have been put to rest. Most if not all of the important figures that hold sway there harbour great resentment against our kind for the actions of the Storm King, thus we must act first."

SLC_recruit_the_poor:0 "Lowest Strata Recruitment Practices"
SLC_recruit_the_poor_desc:0 "There are many ways to reduce poverty rates across the kingdom, but one technique that Her Majesty is soon to implement should be perhaps the most efficient. Recruiting the destitute, those without a home to call their own or any significant personal monetary holdings, will bolster the number of new recruits whilst simultaneously reducing joblessness nationwide."

SLC_extraction_operations:0 "Resource Extraction Operations"
SLC_extraction_operations_desc:0 "Whilst working to improve domestic production has gotten us far, it will not carry the kingdom into the future. No, to truly dominate the global market we will need to extract resources from elsewhere; in clients states that we control via a monopoly on violence. The Storm King would not be able to comprehend the efficiency with which we shall extract riches from our subjects."

SLC_free_market_subjects:0 "The Free Market and its Subjects"
SLC_free_market_subjects_desc:0 "All nations are enslaved by their economic conditions, which is precisely why our strategy of world exports will prove successful. All require resources, all have limited capital with which to procure said resources and so all will come to us in order to secure a reliable trade relationship. Our safety shall be guaranteed by our economic practices just as much as our military might."

SLC_help_war_orphans:0 "A Purpose for the War Orphans"
SLC_help_war_orphans_desc:0 "War orphans are unique amongst the impoverished and the unfortunate for their inextricable relationship with armed conflict. They are not necessarily the most reliable source of recruits; but we may easily pique their interest, either through an appeal to their desire for revenge or simply by offering them a chance to find a new family in the military."

SLC_unstoppable_behemoth:0 "An Unstoppable Behemoth"
SLC_unstoppable_behemoth_desc:0 "Our industrial might is unmatched, having grown exponentially since the end of the civil war. It is an ever-churning engine that demonstrates the strengths inherent to our kind and demonstrates to the world the dominance of yeti technology. We lost a major advantage once at the critical moment, but we shall never lose it again."

SLC_way_to_bay:0 "The Way to the Bay"
SLC_way_to_bay_desc:0 "As economics play a not insignificant role in the wars we choose to wage, it is undeniable that the eastern horse states are an obvious target. Not only are they relatively rich in and of themselves, but their location will provide an excellent jumping off point for more efficient international trade as our overall industrial output continues to accelerate."

SLC_antithesis:0 "The Antithesis"
SLC_antithesis_desc:0 "The hayzeb are precisely the kind of creatures that we do not wish to deal with head on after the Uzerasi fiasco. We do however have a headstart as we have already subdued roughly a third of their kind within the kingdom’s core territories. Pacifying the rest will be a costly endeavour, but the heartland must have new territories to flex its financial muscles in."

SLC_ancient_threat:0 "The Ancient Threat"
SLC_ancient_threat_desc:0 "The Ancient Pact is perhaps the single dangerous geopolitical entity in our vicinity for two reasons: Firstly because their alliance cannot be broken and secondly because they despise us. The Storm King looted and subsequently lost an artefact they held dear and now we must act before the pact takes its revenge upon us."

SLC_society_purpose:0 "A Society's Greater Purpose"
SLC_society_purpose_desc:0 "Though no race is bred for war, yetis possess characteristics that make us particularly good at that very activity. We tower over most creatures and possess many times the strength of even the largest equines, not to mention our opposable thumbs that allow for ergonomic weaponry. Our purpose is still to live, but in life we may all excel in conquest."

SLC_for_yeti_by_yeti:0 "An Economy Built by Yetis, for Yetis"
SLC_for_yeti_by_yeti_desc:0 "Despite treachery at every turn and the devastation of the civil war, we have perfected an excellent economic model. We provide material for nations across the continent and indeed across the world, leaving all to grumble as they purchase our goods; turning the other cheek to our wars for their own benefit."

SLC_additional_MID_funding:0 "Additional MID Funding"
SLC_additional_MID_funding_desc:0 "The Military Investigative Directorate has proven instrumental in our efforts to prepare invasion plans and subsequently subdue conquered territories. It is high time that we expanded their operational purview and significantly increased their budget so that they can continue to operate across our imperial sphere with maximum efficiency."

SLC_those_left_behind:0 "Those Left Behind"
SLC_those_left_behind_desc:0 "In the wake of our war efforts, there are many unfortunate creatures left to suffer without immediate relatives or the means to survive; not unlike our own war orphans. They are left with no means to live and little help, which leaves them under the protection of the kingdom. We shall provide for them through the occupation forces and give them new purpose alongside their kin in suffering."

SLC_northern_riches:0 "The Northern Riches"
SLC_northern_riches_desc:0 "Mareygpt and the little statelet city to its south are both places of immense wealth, literal and historical in the case of the former. Not only will the conquest of these nations allow us to extract said wealth over an extended period of time, but access to the northern bay provides us with yet another excellent string of trade ports that suit our economic interests."

SLC_khan_failings:0 "The Failings of the Khan"
SLC_khan_failings_desc:0 "It was the Storm King’s conquest of the southern horse states that allowed the current Khan to rise to power in the chaos that followed. Unfortunately, this Khan is not our ally and he could perceivably become a threat to our great kingdom. We shall not waste our time with pleasantries or olive branches, we will simply end his opportunistic reign."

SLC_wayward_camels:0 "The Wayward Camels"
SLC_wayward_camels_desc:0 "Like many of the states that emerged in the aftermath of our empire’s collapse, the camels have attempted to carve out a home for themselves in the ensuing chaos. They cannot be blamed for this treachery, but the yeti that attempted to lead them into the future without support from the Rainband certainly can be. We shall bring them back into the fold, for their own sake."

SLC_green_bay_ports:0 "Green Bay Port Techniques"
SLC_green_bay_ports_desc:0 "To say that our naval tradition is lacking would be somewhat of an understatement, particularly when comparing our fleet to our army and airforce. Fortunately, our new subjects are far better versed in that department and are ‘willing’ to share their knowledge with us. What better way to expedite the production of new ships than with outside expertise?"

SLC_end_manedelusia:0 "Into the Sand"
SLC_end_manedelusia_desc:0 "Azir is an empty desert purgatory that can only be home to the hardiest of desert tribes or the most foolhardy of explorers. To claim the territory as our own is as simple as marching a few well-organised soldiers through the desert and constructing a few outposts. Nobody has any reason to stop us, because the land is worthless to most; even to us it is only useful to run railways through."

SLC_should_have_been_ours:0 "What Should Have Been Ours"
SLC_should_have_been_ours_desc:0 "The resources that the Khan wasted in his failed conquest of the Hestrayan peninsula shall not go to waste under our management. Unlike our other subjects, deposits in Karkandannistan and the frontier will be under the direct purview of the state in order to ensure that the riches the Storm King passed over are not ignored a second time."

SLC_last_charge:0 "Their Last Charge"
SLC_last_charge_desc:0 "Though their leadership has proven its ineptitude, the horse fighters that once served their Khan are not personally to blame for the khanate’s defeat. Their warriors will be offered a chance to fight for their new masters and prove their worth. With the alternative being prison or harsh labour, it is hard to imagine many deciding not to take such an offer."

SLC_boltria_dead:0 "Boltria Dead and Buried"
SLC_boltria_dead_desc:0 "No matter how far the self-styled ‘King Boltrus’ got in his vain attempts to control camel society, it is clear that they were all for naught and that his experiment failed spectacularly. We shall thoroughly bury the remains of what once was, giving the camels a chance to prove their worth in a more meaningful fashion; albeit in service to yetis regardless."

SLC_sweat_blood_misery:0 "Sweat, Blood and Misery"
SLC_sweat_blood_misery_desc:0 "Our wars have taught us much, both during and after the reign of the Storm King. Whilst he chose to ignore the gradually escalating resistance that other states were managing to put up against him, Her Majesty is not so blind. We must constantly reevaluate and strategise; find new ways to defeat our enemies in an ever-more-hostile world."

SLC_northern_dockyards:0 "Our Northern Dockyards"
SLC_northern_dockyards_desc:0 "The northern maregyptian ports contain a wealth of knowledge both in terms of the designs of the ships that use them and in the skill of those that operate the equipment. It would be a severe lapse in judgement not to recruit willing creatures of military and civilian authority in order to best understand and co-opt their expertise in equipment and theory."

SLC_khans_guard:0 "The Khan's Guard"
SLC_khans_guard_desc:0 "The most elite amongst the Karkandannistani warriors served as guards of the Khan, both in times of war and in times of peace. Whilst Her Majesty will not allow them such a senior position, without service these horses are now looking for work. Many will be willing to serve as instructors or warriors in the Royal Army, although they will need specialised weaponry that can be wielded with hooves."

SLC_dune_lines:0 "The Dune Lines"
SLC_dune_lines_desc:0 "It should come as no surprise that infrastructure in the deserts under our territorial purview is severely lacking. For trade routes to be efficient and reliable, we must expend significant state resources in creating railways and roads that will stand the test of time in such severe conditions. Not many are excited to work under the scorching sun, but the ancients shall see them through."

SLC_new_course:0 "The New Course"
SLC_new_course_desc:0 "The military industrial complex is the most important part of our economy. To pull it from the financial workings of the country as a whole would be to tear our financial system in twain. No, instead we shall do the opposite. To sustain a free market economic model we must reinvest a proportional amount of our budget in the armed forces, thus enabling us to acquire more raw resources for export."

SLC_glory_war:0 "The Glory of War"
SLC_glory_war_desc:0 "War is a fundamental part of the yeti identity. It was war and conflict that forged the kingdom that Her Majesty now presides over. It was violence and bloodshed that decided its successor. It was death and destruction which made our kind feared across the continent. For yetis, war is a glorious pursuit and the time has come to remind the world of our kind's most valued skill."

SLC_uzerasi_gaps:0 "Fill the Gaps Left by the Uzerasi"
SLC_uzerasi_gaps_desc:0 "The untimely rebellion of the Uzerasi has unfortunately left many bureaucratic positions vacant. Whilst some have been filled by members of the armed forces, others require more specialised civilian knowledge which simply does not exist within the military. To fill these roles, we shall recruit up-and-coming civil servants; once they have been through a series of loyalty tests of course."

SLC_mil_eco_first:0 "The Trust of our People"
SLC_mil_eco_first_desc:0 "The western revolt has understandably caused a lot of public unrest, particularly in the areas of the kingdom closest to the rebellion. It is our duty to quell these fears and restore the trust that was lost when Imamu showed his true colours. The Storm Queen will bring stability and prosperity, with or without the support of a few treacherous nobles."

SLC_further_weaponise_police:0 "Further Weaponise the Police Force"
SLC_further_weaponise_police_desc:0 "The current police forces of the kingdom are direct organisational descendants of military police units that used to patrol the directorate. For some time Her Majesty wished to reduce the scale of their service materiel, but it has become clear after the Mzizima riots that even the police must have the equipment to deal with well armed and organised opponents."

SLC_trust_people:0 "Putting the Military Economy First"
SLC_trust_people_desc:0 "Though some don’t like to admit it, the military industrial complex remains the basis of our developed economy and many recently created industries exist purely to support it. It is imperative that we do what we can to sustain and protect military industry, both because of the importance of the materiel it creates and because of its financial importance in our economy."

SLC_mil_consumer_goods:0 "Military Issue Consumer Goods"
SLC_mil_consumer_goods_desc:0 "Whilst the idea of the military-industrial complex providing consumer goods to the general public isn’t exactly an appealing one, it is nevertheless a recipe for success. Military industries already make high quality and reliable products that are used by tens of thousands of soldiers. What other corporate entities are there that can boast such a positive track record?"

SLC_reigning_remainder:0 "Reigning in the Remainder"
SLC_reigning_remainder_desc:0 "The Uzerasi controlled a large amount of industry and infrastructure in the west of the empire before their rebellion and we have been left to pick up the pieces. Luckily for us, this has created an opportunity for the reorganisation of many large companies, allowing the state to take advantage of previously uncooperative enterprises."

SLC_empire_kingdom:0 "An Empire for the Kingdom"
SLC_empire_kingdom_desc:0 "Considering the breadth of His Majesty’s conquests, the fact that our great nation remained merely a kingdom is quite surprising. He likely only kept the name because he was more interested in artefact hunting than the prestige of his people. Unlike her predecessor, the Storm Queen understands the true value of a sprawling empire; beyond the immense wealth it can provide."

SLC_service_scholarships:0 "Scholarships for Service"
SLC_service_scholarships_desc:0 "Scholarships are - sadly - unattainable for many talented individuals simply because of their scarcity and the limited funds of universities. The state can allot such funds, provided the individuals that seek assistance provide a service for the state. Signing up for the military has benefits for all, especially for those who have much to offer the nation so long as they’re given a chance."

SLC_mil_prep_schools:0 "Military Preparation Schools"
SLC_mil_prep_schools_desc:0 "Preparation schools are typically reserved for the well-off, which is precisely why military run prep schools open to all will be such a great success. They will scare some, but instil a sense of discipline and loyalty in many others from a young age; giving them a taste of both future responsibilities and future glories, should they wish to join the army of course."

SLC_resource_recquisition_eco:0 "Officer Requisition Permits"
SLC_resource_recquisition_eco_desc:0 "Though we distance ourselves from the practices of the Storm King, looting is an inherent part of armed conflict. No matter how much we discourage it, it will occur all the same. Instead, Her Majesty has had the foresight to propose a regulatory system for looting that will decriminalise it and encourage commanders to requisition civilian supplies when necessary."

SLC_legacy_of_legions:0 "The Legacy of His Majesty's Legions"
SLC_legacy_of_legions_desc:0 "His Majesty had an incredible overreliance on a single strategy which - when countered - spectacularly backfired. This is not to say that the legacy of his military prowess was unfounded of course, merely that we can improve upon the reputation he left. The Royal Army will be unstoppable and terrible in its efficiency and size."

SLC_directorate_national_production:0 "The Directorate of National Output"
SLC_directorate_national_production_desc:0 "With the military industrial complex making up such a large amount of the nation’s economy, it has become necessary to establish a government body to oversee production. These industries must be kept to high standards so that their goods remain of qualities high enough for both the military and civilian buyers. Our people deserve nothing less than perfection."

SLC_perma_positive_balance:0 "A Permanent Positive Balance"
SLC_perma_positive_balance_desc:0 "Whilst some states enjoy the monetary freedom that debt spending provides, we cannot be so careless with our finances. We must always be making and exporting more than we spend and import in order to guarantee economic security in the longer term; particularly as we engage in armed conflict to acquire more resources and maintain our export economy."

SLC_reinvest_vital_industries:0 "Reinvesting in Vital Industries"
SLC_reinvest_vital_industries_desc:0 "Though they are far from failing, it is important that we provide some extra funding for our critical industries in order to ensure that they can continue to expand and provide high quality goods for both the military and the civilian sector. New facilities and production methods are not cheap, but we are more than willing to pay at least some of the bill to make modernisation happen."

SLC_desert_bandits:0 "Bandits in the Desert"
SLC_desert_bandits_desc:0 "Though the land is worth precious little, it is important to control all liveable territory south of the Zebhara in order to use the desert as an effective natural border. Above all it is the safety of the kingdom’s economic heartland that must be considered in our conquests and so from time to time we must go out of our way to protect it, even if it is not in our immediate financial interest."

SLC_fleet_resources:0 "Divert Resources to the Fleet"
SLC_fleet_resources_desc:0 "Our naval forces are in a less-than-optimal state. There is potential amongst its commanders, but little means for them to demonstrate their prowess thanks in large part to the Storm King’s insistence on using airships to cross the ocean. Whilst there is much time to make up for, we now have plenty of time and money to spare for the fleet."

SLC_heavy_industry_weapons:0 "Heavy Industry for Heavy Weapons"
SLC_heavy_industry_weapons_desc:0 "Weaponry of all varieties requires mass production in facilities of incredible sizes. It comes as no surprise to the administration that new facilities to meet the demands of the armed forces are required, and so they shall be built. With the purpose of the plants in mind, they shall be constructed somewhat far away from most civilian factories for safety purposes."

SLC_checking_civ_sector:0 "Checking the Civilan Sector"
SLC_checking_civ_sector_desc:0 "Though the traditional civilian sector now makes up a minority share of the home economy, it is nevertheless an important part of our financial structures. We will provide temporary tax breaks and a limited number of grants to encourage smaller local businesses to provide services and goods to their communities."

SLC_more_machine_tools:0 "Proliferation of Machine Tools"
SLC_more_machine_tools_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, machine tools are still a relatively uncommon sight in our gradually developing industries. Though they are expensive, it is important that we provide the funds and information that will allow corporations to purchase and make proper use of modern equipment. After all, both the armed forces and the general public rely on the military-industrial complex."

SLC_resource_network:0 "The Resource Supply Network"
SLC_resource_network_desc:0 "Our newly constructed railways serve a dual purpose. They are of course of paramount importance for the transportation of goods and materiel across vast distances, but they also have the capacity to transport vast numbers of troops at short notice. With proper training and organisational knowhow, our armies will be able to cross their empire in a matter of days."

SLC_service_propaganda:0 "Intensify Service Propaganda"
SLC_service_propaganda_desc:0 "Propaganda is a fundamental part of any recruitment process, but thus far it has been kept at a relatively minimal level. The armed forces always need more recruits however, and as such Her Majesty has authorised a new budget for recruitment agencies. Though some will find the pervasive military rhetoric frustrating, there’s no denying that this strategy will rapidly bear fruit."

SLC_black_gold:0 "Extracting the Black Gold"
SLC_black_gold_desc:0 "Oil is perhaps the single most valuable resource for any army; much like soldiers fight best on full stomachs, machines fight best with a full tank. To this end it is imperative that we secure and expand oil extraction operations wherever we can; particularly as the Rainband lacks any native wells. Black gold is the lifeblood of our military and we must protect our supply of it at all costs."

SLC_first_defence:0 "The First Line of Defence"
SLC_first_defence_desc:0 "Though we pride ourselves on the extensive tradition of our air force, we would do well not to become complacent in our victories. Our empire is vast and any enemy with a sizable bomber squadron would be more than capable of flying to the Rainband and dropping their ordinance in a surprise attack. We must be prepared for every eventuality and construct defences to match."

SLC_cant_refuse:0 "A Leaf out of Tobuck's Book"
SLC_cant_refuse_desc:0 "The Tobuckian bid for independence was successful primarily because of the gun runners who provided extensive financial backing to the rebel forces. Whilst we have no intention of running such an immoral and dangerous business, we see plenty of opportunities to provide allies and associates with the materiel they so desire; for a price, of course."

SLC_all_important_resource:0 "The All-Important Resource"
SLC_all_important_resource_desc:0 "Steel has become the most important resource to any discerning state, surpassing even oil for how absolutely necessary it is in the production of equipment. It is imperative that we maintain efficient production of steel for the foreseeable future in order to facilitate construction projects and maintain significant stockpiles for wartime production."

SLC_synth_material_procurement:0 "Synthetic Material Procurement"
SLC_synth_material_procurement_desc:0 "It has become clear that what we can take from our Zebrican subjects is simply not enough to sustain our economic model on a reliable basis. To remedy this, Her Majesty has seen fit to invest significant state funds into the study and production of synthetic substances with the end goal of supplementing the currently dominant extraction industries."

SLC_city_for_queen:0 "A City Fit for the Queen"
SLC_city_for_queen_desc:0 "The fortress that the Storm King constructed in our capital was essentially useless even upon its inception and has only caused trouble with city planning ever since. To remedy this, the Storm Queen has planned a careful deconstruction of the walls; replacing them with overhead rail lines and new houses underneath. Her project of rejuvenation is certain to bring new life to the city."

SLC_imported_expertise:0 "Imported Technical Expertise"
SLC_imported_expertise_desc:0 "Though our industrial expertise has become second to none, there are certain technical areas in which foreign intellectuals can still provide us valuable information; Hyenas - for example - have incredible knowledge of all things tunnel, mine and mineral related. It is for this reason that the state will go on a recruitment spree in an attempt to bring aboard foreign experts."

SLC_tobuck_leaf:0 "Contracts They Can't Refuse"
SLC_tobuck_leaf_desc:0 "Every company now knows that a contract to construct mining facilities is perhaps the single most lucrative and reliable government contract. It is for this reason that the state is soon to divvy up a large number of said contracts regarding recently prospected land in order to prevent corporate infighting whilst ensuring a beneficial arrangement for all parties."

SLC_zebrican_crops:0 "Crops From Across Zebrica"
SLC_zebrican_crops_desc:0 "As any yeti well knows, our diet is far from varied. Few crops grow in the frigid south of Zebrica that are hardy enough for year-round cultivation, which has left our plates typically filled by measly numbers and amounts of plants. With our recent economic developments however, this too can be rectified. Food imports will help to provide our children with better meals and diets overall."

SLC_simplify_process:0 "Simplifying the Processes"
SLC_simplify_process_desc:0 "As our industrial capacity grows, so too do the workforce demands of the corporations. Whilst we have thus far been able to provide the required creatures, it has become apparent that there are many dumb labour jobs that now need doing to facilitate factory work. To this end we will make efforts to simplify factory work, allowing for internal company redistribution of their employees."

SLC_workshop_zebrica:0 "The Workshop of Zebrica"
SLC_workshop_zebrica_desc:0 "Though other states may lay claim to such a title in a vain attempt to market their own products, it would be foolish of them to deny our superiority in this department. We have achieved global market control and earned for ourselves wealth beyond measure, to be spent as we please. We reign supreme not through magic or conquest, but through finance and commerce."

SLC_salesyeti_neither:0 "A Salesyeti is Neither Friend Nor Foe"
SLC_salesyeti_neither_desc:0 "Whilst some would have preferred to shed our kind’s status as villains in the eyes and hearts of many, it is undeniable that we have found ourselves a place in the world all the same. Those who fear us make sure we like them so that they can buy our resources or weapons and those that despise us simply turn the other cheek so as to not cause themselves cataclysmic economic damage."

SLC_perfect_detterent:0 "A Perfect Detterent"
SLC_perfect_detterent_desc:0 "Nuclear weapons are dangerous things, which is precisely what makes them such effective deterrents. The capacity to instantly annihilate enemy formations on a tactical level or obliterate an enemy’s production facilities at a strategic level is an incredible boon. Even beyond that, there is also the additional element of public terror to consider."

SLC_dead_king_dream:0 "The Dream of a Dead King"
SLC_dead_king_dream_desc:0 "The road has been long and hard, yet our kind once more stands atop this continent with nothing less than complete hegemony; both economic and military. The Storm Queen sits atop a throne of defeated enemies and conquered institutions, proudly at the helm of an unconquerable empire that shall eternally reign across Zebrica."



SLC_demonstrator_demands:0 "The Demonstrators' Demands"
SLC_demonstrator_demands_desc:0 "Although the protests rage on, many of their demands are relatively easy to meet. They demand representation, rights and consideration of a wide range of smaller issues that have been simmering quietly beneath the service; a challenging list in full, but only a few demands need immediately to be met in order for the majority of creatures to return home."

SLC_reassure_admin:0 "Reassure the Administration"
SLC_reassure_admin_desc:0 "The ranks of the civil service have been growing steadily since the restoration of the kingdom proper but they are still far from unshakable. The rowdiness of the armed forces on one side and the demands of the zebras on the other has created an air of worry and concern within the bureaucracy, one that we must immediately tend to."

SLC_before_army:0 "Come Before the Army"
SLC_before_army_desc:0 "The army is understandably eager to put down what they see as a treasonous revolt against the rightful successor to the Storm King and their leader. It is absolutely imperative that Her Majesty makes her position clear before some frightened yeti fires the first shot. Now is not the time to fight, nor is it a time to be scared."

SLC_grant_family:0 "Restore the Family Privileges"
SLC_grant_family_desc:0 "Since the end of the civil war, the influence and power of the Uzerasi has been gradually eaten away by various reforms and careful political manoeuvring. Whilst they have played no small part in the western revolt, it is necessary for us to return some of their privileges in order to coax their organisers into cooperation once again."

SLC_commander_amnesty:0 "Grant Amnesty to the Officers"
SLC_commander_amnesty_desc:0 "There are a significant number of officers - both yetis and zebras - who had loyalties to their families first and the kingdom second. Had another civil conflict erupted it is quite likely that they would have fled or even joined the rebels in the west. Under any other circumstance punishments would be issued via court-martial, but now is not the time for such harsh measures."

SLC_coronation:0 "His Coronation"
SLC_coronation_desc:0 "A key demand of Imamu and his family during the negotiations was that there must be a way to check the power of the Storm Queen. To that end, Imamu will be crowned as the King of the Uzerasi as a gesture of goodwill and to formally establish a regulatory diarchy. Although in theory he shall play second fiddle to the Queen, in practice she will never rule without him."

SLC_abandoning_collab:0 "Abandoning Collaboration"
SLC_abandoning_collab_desc:0 "Collaboration in the east was little more than a perfected process of economic and political oppression. Giving the Zwahile just enough to survive is no longer enough, not when we intend to treat them entirely as equals under the supervision of King Imamu. Today is the day that this subtly barbaric practice is finally put to rest."

SLC_reenfranchise_rav:0 "Reenfranchise Ravakh"
SLC_reenfranchise_rav_desc:0 "Since the civil war’s end, Ravakh’s curious political position has become quite well known. His little movement within the armed forces was very much illegal, of course; but it persisted all the same. In an effort to open up the political sphere, a detenté of sorts will be arranged with our resident communist airship pilot."

SLC_ground_cerulean:0 "Ground Cerulean Squadron"
SLC_ground_cerulean_desc:0 "Cerulean Squadron has been a valuable asset in all conflicts that they have supported us in, but they are still mercenaries. The time has come to ground them for good and put their expertise - and our funds - to use on new projects instead of their ramshackle fighters. The knowledge they possess will be far more valuable to the military than their service."

SLC_rebuild_army:0 "Rebuilding the Armed Forces"
SLC_rebuild_army_desc:0 "Although the military is largely functional in its current state, it is hardly a force worthy of the commonwealth and all its creatures. It requires a complete restructuring in order to remove all traces of the military police force that it once was and we must take great care to involve our new friends at all levels of service and command."

SLC_our_infamy_gone:0 "Our Infamy, Gone with the Kingdom"
SLC_our_infamy_gone_desc:0 "Although many still look at individual yetis with fear, the Storm Kingdom is no more. The fear of a true successor to the Storm King is subsiding and the infamy that his reign brought leaves no scar on the commonwealth. It will still take time for creatures to begin trusting us, but at least that trust is not overshadowed by Zebrica’s most vicious conqueror."

SLC_hooves_hearts:0 "Hooves and Hearts"
SLC_hooves_hearts_desc:0 "The hearts of creatures are what we must sway if we truly seek to reconcile with those both within and without our borders. Any madyeti with a gun can get a scared zebra to sit down and shut up, but a kind and pragmatic one is required to make real progress. We are not the monsters who came before us, and we will prove it."

SLC_adapting_old_doctrines:0 "Adapting the Old Doctrines"
SLC_adapting_old_doctrines_desc:0 "The correct amount of force applied in the correct place is no worse a method than appealing to the sensibilities of the creatures we are trying to convince. We must adapt the old methods of policing and resistance suppression to fit a new and more peaceful era, which is to say that we’ll be using the same amount of force; just with a little more care. "

SLC_proliferate_services:0 "Proliferate Yeti State Services"
SLC_proliferate_services_desc:0 "Thanks in part to the absolute authority of the yeti monarchy, state services and transport systems have rapidly developed in places where resistance to their establishment would otherwise have slowed them. Although the origins of these services are far from pretty, it would be worthwhile expanding them to facilitate development across the commonwealth."

SLC_mixed_market_eco:0 "The Slowly Growing Welfare System"
SLC_mixed_market_eco_desc:0 "With its roots in a state care system for ex-serviceyetis, provisions for general healthcare experts employed by the state have been gradually expanding across the rainband. Needless to say this system is widely praised by creatures previously unable to easily seek professional medical assistance, we would do well to build upon it for the benefit of all."

SLC_our_better_half:0 "Our Better Half"
SLC_our_better_half_desc:0 "Zebras are capable of a great many things, including but not limited to the capacity for alchemy. Now that we are doing our best to work in harmony with the Zwahile and beyond, the time has come to provide an ample research budget for their experiments. It’s unknown exactly what will come of this research, but King Imamu has promised Her Majesty results."

SLC_modern_levy_concept:0 "Modernising the Levy Concept"
SLC_modern_levy_concept_desc:0 "Although conscription is not necessarily the most important aspect of war, it is undeniable that a steady stream of bodies is not only beneficial but necessary. A network of regional conscription centres run with the bureaucratic knowhow of the Uzerasi will provide such a surplus, albeit to the annoyance of the armed forces."

SLC_retain_yeti_generals:0 "Retain the Yeti General Staff"
SLC_retain_yeti_generals_desc:0 "The yeti style of manoeuvre warfare does not need many more soldiers that we currently have. It is swift and devastating, or else it has failed. To that end the general staff will remain packed with experienced yetis - albeit with some new members in the mix - in an effort to retain the deadly efficiency of the military. The Uzerasi will fuss of course, but war was never their forte."

SLC_support_new_divs:0 "Support for the New Divisions"
SLC_support_new_divs_desc:0 "As support structures are necessary in the construction of any great monument, so too are support companies essential to the function of a professional military. No matter the strategies and tactics employed, improvements to supporting formations must be made in order to maintain a state of effective readiness."

SLC_arushay_council:0 "The Arushay Council Model"
SLC_arushay_council_desc:0 "Although empowering local institutions of law is likely to provide some influential individuals with an easy way out of punishment, the importance of devolved law enforcement cannot be understated. It is paramount that each part of the commonwealth enforces its laws to the standards of the local people in order to guarantee regional stability."

SLC_judicial_directorate:0 "The Grand Judicial Directorate"
SLC_judicial_directorate_desc:0 "Whilst the creation of a court with supreme authority over all others will not be popular amongst the ranks of Uzerasi nobility, it is imperative that we maintain an equal legal standard across the commonwealth. A fair hand - or hoof - in all matters across the nation is required to ensure lasting peace and stability for all creatures within its borders."

SLC_regional_police_forces:0 "Establish Regional Police Forces"
SLC_regional_police_forces_desc:0 "It is impossible to coordinate all police units directly from the Eye of the Storm, not just because of the magnitude of such an operation; but also the geographic limitations of the home isle. To alleviate the practical limitations of our current law enforcement, new organisational bodies will be established across the commonwealth to provide regional policing services."

SLC_eradicate_illiteracy:0 "Systematically Eradicate Illiteracy"
SLC_eradicate_illiteracy_desc:0 "Illiteracy is the second greatest scourge on any society and the state which governs it, behind only poverty. To that end it is of critical importance that we take to each region of the kingdom and systematically uproot whatever is preventing the spread of literacy whilst constructing schools and implementing education reforms where such establishments already exist."

SLC_vindicate_conflicts:0 "Vindicate the Mazwian Conflicts"
SLC_vindicate_conflicts_desc:0 "Before the invasion of the Storm King, the Mazwi Empire fought countless wars with the Uzerasi kingdom with the Zwahile coast switching hooves many times over the years. Their conflict was legendary and many nobles still privately resent the Mazwi - and those in the Great Lakes who served them - for leaving them so vulnerable to a yeti invasion. We can provide the war they seek."

SLC_two_kingdoms:0 "The Knowledge of Two Kingdoms"
SLC_two_kingdoms_desc:0 "Thanks in part to the pressing nature of the civil war and subsequently the focus on rebuilding the Rainband, much knowledge and literature in the possession of the Uzerasi has thus far been ignored. This shall be the case no longer and a new university specialising in the study of shared cultural history between the yeti tribes and Zwahile shall be constructed."

SLC_small_and_small:0 "Small Arms and 'Small' Arms"
SLC_small_and_small_desc:0 "Although our current inventory of weapons is serviceable, it would be a lie to claim that our stocks of small arms and artillery are entirely up to date. On top of this, the commonwealth currently lacks standardised equipment for equines serving in the army; an issue that must be rectified immediately if we desire a reasonable level of combat effectiveness amongst zebra divisions."

SLC_land_knowledge:0 "Our Knowledge of the Land"
SLC_land_knowledge_desc:0 "Yetis have travelled all across the continent, but they do not have the same affinity for the lands upon which they walk as zebras. It is imperative that proper terrain combat training be provided to all members of the military by the most able of zebra officers, even if those officers happen to have strong personal ties to the Uzerasi."

SLC_innate_adaptability:0 "Our Innate Adaptability"
SLC_innate_adaptability_desc:0 "Yetis are amongst a slim minority of creatures that possess dexterous hands and have learned to use them in ways that only unicorns could possibly mimic. We do not rely on telekinesis or wings, nor can we brew enhancing potions to make us ready for combat. We do it all with our hands, and from amagical evolutionary desperation comes unparalleled ingenuity."

SLC_status_hyenia:0 "Address the Status of Hyenia"
SLC_status_hyenia_desc:0 "Hyenia exists in somewhat of a bureaucratic limbo at present, technically beholden to the will of both the Storm Queen and King Imamu. It is high time they were given the right to manage themselves in all civil matters, provided they comply with the founding laws of the diarchy at large of course. They are just as much citizens of the commonwealth as any other creature."

SLC_enshrine_freedom:0 "Enshrine Freedom of Conscience"
SLC_enshrine_freedom_desc:0 "The spiritual beliefs of the commonwealth vary wildly depending on where an individual finds themselves; be it in Hyenia, the Zwahile or the Rainband. We shall sign into effect laws that protect the right of all creatures to practise any faith they please, so long as the faith in question does not infringe upon the basic rights of any other citizen."

SLC_finish_act:0 "Finish the Act of Vengeance"
SLC_finish_act_desc:0 "The zebras of the Great Lakes clamour for someone to blame and most are in agreement that the Mazwi have not yet felt the bitter taste of complete defeat. Although an unconventional solution to the lingering discontent, it may be possible to agitate the Great Lakes in such a way that they turn once more to seek revenge against their old rulers instead of their new ones."

SLC_recruiting_remnants:0 "Recruiting the Remnants"
SLC_recruiting_remnants_desc:0 "What remains of the Great Laker armies are disorganised bands of soldiers with no military hierarchy to return to and a home that they failed to protect. We may be able to make use of this situation by trying to recruit the battered remnants of a once great army, providing an outlet for their self-loathing and frustration in another chance at service."

SLC_clean_up:0 "Clean Up the Mess"
SLC_clean_up_desc:0 "Although much has been done to rebuild and restore the wealth and history of southern Zebrica, there are some key issues left to be addressed. The Storm Queen is primarily concerned with the defensibility of the commonwealth's borders and King Imamu wishes to bring home the Ovingolanders as a show of good faith. There is much left to be done."

SLC_good_word:0 "The Good Word of Traders"
SLC_good_word_desc:0 "Traders are not known for being the most trustworthy of creatures, but they are very good at spreading news into all the right ears over the right period of time. A free delivery here, some kind words there and eventually the caravanning routes of southern Zebrica will be alive with tales of our good deeds for all to hear."

SLC_saviour_concept:0 "Proliferate the 'Saviour' Concept"
SLC_saviour_concept_desc:0 "The Saviour Concept is inspired by the somewhat popular belief within the Great Lakes that the Storm King’s invasion was divine punishment for the tyranny of the Mazwi. Although the circumstances are different now, playing into this narrative and presenting ourselves as liberators - divine or otherwise - will be very beneficial to Imamu’s ongoing integration efforts."

SLC_service_accomodation:0 "Post-Service Accommodation"
SLC_service_accomodation_desc:0 "Although medical assistance is provided for veterans already, many ex-servicecreatures struggle to find work and subsequently afford housing. We must provide for those that protect the commonwealth, or they will simply leave and become part of a hostile nation’s pool of skilled military professionals. Either that, or they will simply cause a sizable fuss."

SLC_reformalise_army:0 "Reformalise the Royal Army"
SLC_reformalise_army_desc:0 "Having gone through a long period of reorganisation and non-yeti recruitment, the Royal Army is finally ready to be reinstated as the core military branch of the commonwealth. Of course it will now technically also be subordinate to both King Imamu as well as the Storm Queen in equal measure, but the former is still more than happy to delegate military matters to the latter."

SLC_commonwealth_codex:0 "The Commonwealth Codex of Rights"
SLC_commonwealth_codex_desc:0 "The right of assembly, the right to strike against unfavourable or unsafe working conditions and the right to participate in the politics of the nation are just some of the stipulations in the codex. The list of formal and henceforth inalienable rights is truly extensive, and represents a tangible departure from the untouchable absolutism of the Storm King."

SLC_make_friends:0 "Our Warm Corner of a Frigid World"
SLC_make_friends_desc:0 "Although it is preferable for international matters to be solved without the use of arms, we are always ready to defend our homes against those that would see the diarchy fall. The commonwealth represents strength in the face of our worst enemies, our worst nightmares and our worst impulses; and if you are willing to accept the helping hand of a yeti, it will give some of that strength to you."

SLC_roads_rails_love:0 "Roads, Rails and a Little Love"
SLC_roads_rails_love_desc:0 "The Storm Queen wisely recognised the value of public works projects during the reconstruction period and King Imamu has every intent to parrot their successes. Infrastructure and convenience are a surefire way to steal the hearts of a people, which is precisely what the King of the Uzerasi intends to do."

SLC_rebel_releases:0 "Negotiate Rebel Terms"
SLC_rebel_releases_desc:0 "Several high-profile resistance members that we have captured in operations across the Great Lakes are bureaucratic staff who became responsible for organising insurgent operations. Perhaps with the right persuasive tools and the knowledge that many of them simply wish to return home, we can very easily set them free on our own payroll."

SLC_reintegrate_prisoners:0 "Reintegrate the Prisoners of War"
SLC_reintegrate_prisoners_desc:0 "The officers, like many of their soldiers, have become aimless in the wake of the war with the Great Lakes. We have many talented commanders languishing in prison who - though it would be unwise to let them command divisions themselves - could provide valuable insight in strategy and tactics should we recruit them into the general staff."

SLC_food_votes_respect:0 "Food, Franchise and Real Respect"
SLC_food_votes_respect_desc:0 "Much as the Storm Queen tasked storm creatures with delivering rations to struggling villages during the civil war, King Imamu shall now follow suit. Cities that were sieged or became disconnected from supporting farmland will be rebuilt, those without food will be fed and those who have no work will find themselves with a job in a new consumer goods complex."

SLC_military_affairs:0 "The Directorate of Military Affairs"
SLC_military_affairs_desc:0 "Organising and directing the military industrial complex has progressively become more difficult as the variants and amounts of equipment required has slowly grown over the years. To this end Her Majesty has one last directorate up her metaphorical sleeve, the Directorate of Military Affairs; soon to be responsible for the procurement and testing of new equipment."

SLC_disciplined_bureau:0 "A Disciplined Bureaucracy"
SLC_disciplined_bureau_desc:0 "Far from the shaky civil service that once had to be reminded of its place, the bureaucratic machine of the commonwealth now runs like a finely tuned machine. No amount of paperwork or complexity can stump the inner workings of the commonwealth. Such is its majesty that the King and Queen themselves have expressed their fondness for this masterpiece."

SLC_con_lentitud_poderosa:0 "Forward with Powerful Slowness"
SLC_con_lentitud_poderosa_desc:0 "The trick with progress is that even when all seems hopeless, somewhere buried in the rubble of mistakes is a better way. Progress must be fought for, it must be understood and it must be strived for, no matter how long and hard the road may be. There is always a chance to build back better than before and to put new bridges where old ones burnt down."

SLC_zeebs_and_yetis:0 "Of Zebras and Yetis"
SLC_zeebs_and_yetis_desc:0 "Although the commonwealth contains many creatures of different denominations, the most populous are yetis and zebras. The realisation of King Imamu’s vision is more than just a territorial integration of the Great Lakes, it is a final lasting peace between zebras and yetis; brokered in no small part by him, albeit with some help."

SLC_lockstep_forward:0 "Lockstep into the Future"
SLC_lockstep_forward_desc:0 "Although the Storm Queen and King Imamu have not always seen eye to eye on certain issues, they trust each other in their relevant fields of expertise. They have demonstrated to each other, to their subjects and to the world that the yetis are no longer a cabal of violent beasts. They have proven to be worthy rulers of all the creatures who reside within the borders of the commonwealth."

SLC_formerly_storm:0 "The Storm Formerly Known as Cyan"
SLC_formerly_storm_desc:0 "We knew of a world without memory, without time, observed the use of a language that ignored nouns, a language of impersonal verbs and efficacious epithets. Thus to life came the days and then the years, and something akin to euphoria happened one morning.\n\nIt thundered and rained, in pink and cyan."



SLC_army_collab_and_stratocracy:0 "The Royal Army"
SLC_army_collab_and_stratocracy_desc:0 "A direct organisational successor to the armed forces of the junta, the newly founded Royal Army shall serve as foundation for the kingdom’s renewed military might. Though it contains remnants of His Majesty’s general staff, the Storm Queen has made absolutely certain that the new blood will have their way laying the groundwork for modern strategies and tactics."

SLC_next_gen_inf_weapons:0 "The Next Generation of Infantry Weapons"
SLC_next_gen_inf_weapons_desc:0 "Much of the civil war was fought with outdated weapons that had been hastily removed from ageing stockpiles of old firearms. Whilst they have proven to be far from useless, the military has been expressing a desire to modernise their small arms for many years and we finally have the resources with which to devote ourselves to such a project."

SLC_artillery_upgrades:0 "Much-Needed Battery Upgrades"
SLC_artillery_upgrades_desc:0 "Conventional artillery was not commonly used by His Majesty or the generals of the era, largely because munitions dropped from airships achieved a similar effect. More recently however, the armed forces has become increasingly attached to the artillery concept as tactics utilising indirect fire developed during the civil war become ever-more more prevalent."

SLC_tracks_in_dirt:0 "Tracks in the Dirt"
SLC_tracks_in_dirt_desc:0 "Tanks present a much less significant tactical shift than one might initially assume. Practically speaking they operate in a similar capacity to airships, creating and exploiting breakthroughs primarily against infantry and over relatively open terrain. Simultaneously they are far smaller and better protected targets that move quickly and provide ample fire support for infantry."

SLC_craters_in_sand:0 "Craters in the Sand"
SLC_craters_in_sand_desc:0 "What artillery lacks in style it makes up for in substance. Massed and precise fire from dedicated artillery pieces of various calibres allows for a surprisingly flexible doctrine whilst keeping the economic load relatively light. Though it is quite far removed from the old methods, it is a strategic development worth pursuing."

SLC_restore_air_fleet:0 "Restoring the Air Fleet"
SLC_restore_air_fleet_desc:0 "Though air warfare seems unfamiliar to those that once considered themselves experts, we were the first to be exposed to planes and their power. Though our airships fared poorly, the pilots that survived encounters with them have performed extensive studies in design and doctrine; giving our designers and engineers access to much-needed information."

SLC_armoured_infantry:0 "Evolve the Armoured Infantry Concept"
SLC_armoured_infantry_desc:0 "The storm creatures have worn armour into combat since records began and continue to do so to this day, albeit with modern materials. For most yetis such equipment is simply too heavy to be feasible, but that does not necessarily mean we cannot afford them protection. Armoured transports will not only allow for rapid deployment, but drastically increase the survival chances of the troops within."

SLC_ground_support_technology:0 "Ground Support Technology"
SLC_ground_support_technology_desc:0 "Whilst primitive bombs were sufficient in the days where aircraft travelled at about the same speed as infantry, new heights and speeds demand ground support innovations. Early testing of aircraft-mounted cannons has shown particular promise, although it is clear that the pilots will need extensive training to use such equipment effectively."

SLC_contracts_for_cerulean:0 "Permanent Contracts for Cerulean Squadron"
SLC_contracts_for_cerulean_desc:0 "Cerulean Squadron are a renowned mercenary band that cobbled together their own aircraft from the parts left behind by the few hippogriff planes that were downed during the annihilation of the invasion fleet. Besides the propaganda potential that their formal recruitment offers us, they are also some of the foremost experts on dogfighting techniques and have much to offer our airforce."

SLC_lean_on_natural_advantages:0 "Lean on Our Biology"
SLC_lean_on_natural_advantages_desc:0 "We have historically performed best in wars by leaning on technological developments or biological advantages entirely unique to our kind. It is only with a renewed scientific interest in such fields and an additional allocation of funds that we will once again regain a massive military advantage over our adversaries."

SLC_rolling_thunder:0 "Rolling Thunder"
SLC_rolling_thunder_desc:0 "Though it has taken some time to iron out the problems in both the design and implementation of tanks, we are now at yet another fork in the road. Light tanks are fast and dangerous, medium tanks provide a balanced platform for a variety of tasks and heavy tanks can serve in both an anti-tank and anti-infantry role without risking damage. With innovation comes experimentation."

SLC_airburst_shells:0 "Airburst Shells"
SLC_airburst_shells_desc:0 "High explosive shells are only as effective as their probability of hitting a target, both on the ground and in the air. Timed fuses used in conjunction with ground-level spotters should allow us to fire shells that detonate close to a target in the event of a missed shot, drastically increasing their potential to cause lethal damage."

SLC_full_spectrum_support:0 "Full Spectrum Support"
SLC_full_spectrum_support_desc:0 "Support companies are necessary for the effective operation of any division, regardless of its purpose. Maintenance, fire support, logistics, reconnaissance and many more have a pivotal role both inside and outside of combat. To that end it is essential that we invest heavily in optimising and properly equipped such brigades."

SLC_no_accuracy_mo_damage:0 "Destructive Potential"
SLC_no_accuracy_mo_damage_desc:0 "Rocket artillery - at least by current measure - is significantly less accurate than regular artillery, yet it has a not insignificant effect on enemy morale. Provided that the accuracy can be overcome with a significant increase in the volume of fire, such devices could prove to be the next great leap forward in indirect fire equipment and tactics."

SLC_rugged_logistics:0 "Rugged Logistics"
SLC_rugged_logistics_desc:0 "The desert is not kind to any military-grade equipment; the more complex a mechanism or machine is, the faster it tends to seize up and become inoperable. For the sake of our tank-oriented strategy it is absolutely imperative that we maintain a good supply of vehicles, tools and spare parts so that inevitable malfunctions can be mitigated."

SLC_her_majestys_finest:0 "Her Majesty's Finest"
SLC_her_majestys_finest_desc:0 "The storm creatures were once the tip of His Majesty’s spear, but their size, armour and sheer determination cannot provide a significant advantage against modern weaponry. To retain their importance on the ever-changing battlefield, storm creatures must receive additional training and the technological zenith of our small arms stockpile."

SLC_radio_integration:0 "Radio Integration"
SLC_radio_integration_desc:0 "Whilst developing a radio that can be used by storm creatures and regular yetis alike has proven challenging, it has not been without merit. The development of shorthand Horse code for storm creatures in conjunction with the rapid miniaturisation of radio technology has made the proliferation of the device a certainty."

SLC_rapid_deployment_specialisation:0 "Rapid Deployment Specialisation"
SLC_rapid_deployment_specialisation_desc:0 "Motorisation is an inevitability. Whilst trains excel in long distance transportation of massive amounts of materiel, they lack the ability to operate with any level of flexibility. Trucks and other motor vehicles have already begun to pick up the slack in this regard, transporting equipment from trains to the front in record time and over almost any terrain."

SLC_legion_phoenix:0 "Like an Azure Phoenix"
SLC_legion_phoenix_desc:0 "His Majesty’s legions fell almost as rapidly as they rose, but their legacy lives on. The Royal Army is now feared for its proficiency as the legions once were for their brutality and greed. From the ashes of the civil war arises an azure phoenix of impossible military might; once more unparalleled, never again to fall."



SLC_army_collab_unique:0 "Peacekeeping on the Continent"
SLC_army_collab_unique_desc:0 "Whilst peacekeeping forces are to many simply a rebranding of foreign aid, they nevertheless serve a pivotal role in maintaining internal stability. Not only do they allow us to be entirely open in our foreign military ventures without significant international backlash, but they provide the military with the unique opportunity to test new weaponry without a large-scale conflict."

SLC_alchemical_adaptability:0 "Alchemical Adaptability"
SLC_alchemical_adaptability_desc:0 "Though zebra magic - like all magic - is entirely alien to the vast majority of yetis, that is not to say that it cannot help us. In particular, the products of zebra alchemy have proven to have an effect on yetis; although the extent and usefulness of such effects remains to be proven. Perhaps they will have domestic and military applications, if produced in large enough quantities."

SLC_hyena_expertise:0 "The Expertise of Hyenas"
SLC_hyena_expertise_desc:0 "For all of the kingdom’s victories, His Majesty failed to entirely crush the hyenas for one reason. They know how to operate in harsh desert conditions and we did not, nor do we now. Whilst it may irritate some of the older members of the general staff, it is time we tactically deferred to the hyenas themselves so that they can show us their tricks."

SLC_standardise_recruitment:0 "Standardised Non-Yeti Recruitment"
SLC_standardise_recruitment_desc:0 "The bottom line is that yetis are soon to make up a minority of the kingdom’s core population and we need new recruits. Very few of our zebra and hyena subjects volunteer themselves for the Storm Queen’s army, which means that we will have to work closely with the advisory bodies to establish an agreeable conscription system in the kingdom’s non-yeti territories."



SLC_army_strat_unique:0 "Formalise the Penal Division System"
SLC_army_strat_unique_desc:0 "Penal divisions have been in a state of legal and organisational limbo for several years at this point, but their value is clear. Not only do they allow us to keep prisons empty of dangerous inmates and lower operational costs, but penal divisions have a unique ability to instil terror in those that suffer their wrath. May the ancients take pity on their victims."

SLC_special_research_directorate:0 "Directorate of Special Research Projects"
SLC_special_research_directorate_desc:0 "There is typically a moral boundary that many scientists understandably refuse to cross, but it has become apparent that to truly understand the limits of creatures’ bodies we must cross those boundaries. The DSRP will be a top secret scientific organisation staffed with the most morally unencumbered researchers we can get our hands on, tasked with the most vile of tests."

SLC_tabun_extraction:0 "Tabun Extraction Facilities"
SLC_tabun_extraction_desc:0 "Though its name is relatively unassuming, tabun is a recently discovered nerve agent. Introduction of the substance into artillery divisions en masse may be challenging, but as a precision weapon it will have its uses; particularly against urban and fortified targets. In addition, the effects of exposure will make for a useful - if horrifying - propaganda tool."

SLC_tip_of_spear:0 "The Tip of the Spear"
SLC_tip_of_spear_desc:0 "Despite the kingdom’s troubles, the storm creature formations within the armed forces have remained markedly loyal and incredibly effective. As thanks for their thorough and brutal disposal of the monarchy’s many enemies, they shall be rewarded with the most technologically advanced equipment in the arsenal and trained so thoroughly that no creature will ever best them."



SLC_dreams_of_a_fleet:0 "Dreams of a Fleet"
SLC_dreams_of_a_fleet_desc:0 "Our navy is currently comprised almost entirely of second-rate ships that were either requisitioned during His Majesty's conquests or constructed as part of the invasion fleet some years ago. Needless to say these ships are hopelessly outdated and are not fit for modern naval warfare or even anti-piracy duties. Thus, the Storm Queen has decreed a naval expansion and retrofit."

SLC_cruiser_development:0 "The Flotilla Mainstay"
SLC_cruiser_development_desc:0 "Whilst larger, faster and otherwise more specialised vessels have been designed; cruisers remain the core of our fleet structure. To ignore their importance would be a crime and thus new designs will be needed in order to accomplish a proper modernisation of the navy."

SLC_applying_naval_theory:0 "Applying Naval Theory"
SLC_applying_naval_theory_desc:0 "Though the provisional directorate maintained control over a considerable coastline, the regime did not value shipbuilding investments. Instead, smaller teams of theorists were assembled to discuss naval warfare and the applications of new technologies. Now - finally - these teams have the opportunity to put their theories to the test."

SLC_small_and_simple:0 "Small and Dangerous"
SLC_small_and_simple_desc:0 "Destroyers are an immensely important vessel for a number of roles, ranging from anti-submarine operations to fleet screening and more. What they typically lack in survivability, they make up for in relative manoeuvrability and an arsenal befitting much larger ships. The navy must remain up-to-date in destroyer technology in order to remain tactically adaptable."

SLC_under_the_waves:0 "Under the Waves"
SLC_under_the_waves_desc:0 "Submarines are a rather novel concept to yetis and many find them anxiety-inducing to serve aboard, but neither of these aspects reduce their potential. Silent ship-hunting and convoy disruption may well be the difference-maker in a prolonged conflict and we would be wise to invest in such technologies."

SLC_above_the_surface:0 "Above the Surface"
SLC_above_the_surface_desc:0 "Specialised aircraft designed specifically to target naval vessels of all varieties have existed in concept since the creation of the first war-capable airships. At the time they were impractical as ship weaponry rendered such designs ineffective, but with the advent of plane technology there may well be merit in such designs."

SLC_lofty_ocean_battlements:0 "Lofty Ocean Battlements"
SLC_lofty_ocean_battlements_desc:0 "Battleships are a specialised vessel that take many design principles of a destroyer and do the exact opposite. They are slow, lumbering behemoths with enough firepower to level a small town or an entire enemy formation on their own; making them expensive and very valuable. Despite their drawbacks, the Storm Queen believes that they are well worth the cost."

SLC_airfields_upon_the_foam:0 "Airfields Upon the Foam"
SLC_airfields_upon_the_foam_desc:0 "For many, aircraft carriers are a natural development stemming from our affinity with air power and it’s easy to see why. The capacity to project aerial power over great naval distances is not something to be lightly ignored and the Storm Queen agrees that investing in carrier development is the best way forward for the navy."

SLC_settle_on_naval_doctrine:0 "Settle a Naval Doctrine"
SLC_settle_on_naval_doctrine_desc:0 "Naval doctrine is a contentious subject amongst our theorists. Not only is our naval tradition sorely lacking, but our naval officers are all relatively new recruits and have little experience with which to wholeheartedly support a commitment to any one strategy. With this in mind, it will be necessary to focus our efforts on specialising in a single doctrine in order to maintain organisation in the field."

SLC_the_meeting_of_theatres:0 "The Meeting of Theatres"
SLC_the_meeting_of_theatres_desc:0 "Beach landings are notoriously difficult to pull off even in the best conditions, making them simultaneously one of the best ways to surprise a foe. The Storm Queen understands that neglecting such an strategic boon would be wasteful and has set aside additional funding for the express purpose of developing relevant technologies."

SLC_navy_his_majesty_would_be_proud_of:0 "A Navy His Majesty Would Commend"
SLC_navy_his_majesty_would_be_proud_of_desc:0 "Though we are not a traditionally seafaring people, Her Majesty’s navy is truly a sight to behold. The Storm King may have had ambition, but our fleet and its admirals surpass even his most delusional dreams.\n\nAll hail the Storm Queen, may she bring us victory on the vast blue battlefield!"



SLC_constructing_a_modern_airforce:0 "Constructing a Modern Airforce"
SLC_constructing_a_modern_airforce_desc:0 "In the most frank of terms, our current fleet of aircraft is... disappointing. We were the first to master the skies and have perhaps the most developed pool of theorists the world over, yet we have barely moved on from the King’s disastrous overreliance on airships. The time has come to restore our once-proud air force."

SLC_adaptable_airframes:0 "Versatile Airframes"
SLC_adaptable_airframes_desc:0 "What moderately sized airframes lack in specialisation, they make up for in versatility. They can serve in any role from transportation to close air support if correctly equipped, allowing a single aircraft design to operate as needed with a relatively simple refit process."

SLC_reconquering_the_sky:0 "Reconquering the Sky"
SLC_reconquering_the_sky_desc:0 "Once, the sky was our domain; we - one of the largest sapient species - dominated the air and laid waste to enemy armies from above. That apex of aerial power did not last, but in the time since His Majesty’s defeat our airship manufacturers and military theorists have been coming up with solutions to our strategic shortcomings. It is imperative that we collate and discuss their work."

SLC_agility_and_speed:0 "Agility and Speed"
SLC_agility_and_speed_desc:0 "Light aircraft specialise in speed and agility, making them ideal for gaining and maintaining air superiority over enemy aircraft. Whilst our designs for single-yeti planes are of course larger than those of other, smaller creatures; the engineers assure us that they have made up for this natural shortcoming by using enormous control surfaces to maintain optimal manoeuvrability."

SLC_our_own_aerial_dominance:0 "Our Own Aerial Dominance"
SLC_our_own_aerial_dominance_desc:0 "Our aerial tradition and natural attributes are the most important consideration when designing new and improved aircraft. The Storm Queen has granted an additional research stipend to be distributed amongst projects that focus on the capacity and limitations of our physiology and constitution."

SLC_the_aircraft_arms_race:0 "The Aircraft Arms Race"
SLC_the_aircraft_arms_race_desc:0 "The aircraft arms race is unique in that the tolerances and dimensions of the aircraft dictate what the most appropriate armament will be. Automatic weapons are only as useful as the tensile strengths of the wings or fuselage that they are mounted on. Additional funding will be required in order to ensure the rapid development of new and limit-pushing weaponry."

SLC_destruction_and_terror_bombing:0 "Destruction and Terror Bombing"
SLC_destruction_and_terror_bombing_desc:0 "Strategic destruction and morale bombing are two separate but similar doctrines that both involve the dropping of munitions onto enemy cities. The only difference is that the former specifically targets war infrastructure or enemy formations and the latter does not discriminate between civilian and soldier. Both doctrines require the same thing: More munitions to drop."

SLC_close_support_from_above:0 "Three-Dimensional Close Support"
SLC_close_support_from_above_desc:0 "Close support is usually a term used by the soldiers on the ground, but this special case is an appropriate use. Smaller, faster aircraft equipped with relatively powerful munitions will be able to provide close support on demand for the army; granting a significant tactical advantage. Focusing on this doctrine of munitions deployment is in the best interests of the armed forces."

SLC_descend_from_the_sky:0 "Dedicated Airborne Divisions"
SLC_descend_from_the_sky_desc:0 "Whilst yetis lack the wings that some creatures are lucky enough to have, we are no less capable of flight; or falling in style, at least. The Storm Queen has expressed interest in the creation of dedicated airborne units since the Royal Army and Royal Airforce were founded and now the state has the resources to develop the required technologies."

SLC_storm_up_above:0 "A Storm Up Above"
SLC_storm_up_above_desc:0 "With previous technological developments out of the way, the time has come to finalise our doctrine and return to the skies with a vengeance. Our talented theorists and dedicated pilots want nothing more than to prove the years of rebuilding the airforce worthwhile. Let us show the world that we never truly forfeited the sky!"

SLC_an_airforce_beyond_sk:0 "An Airforce Beyond the Invasion Fleet"
SLC_an_airforce_beyond_sk_desc:0 "Whilst His Majesty’s airships failed to conquer Equestria, he was not wrong to pursue their procurement; merely in his choice of technology. He would drool with glee, were he around to see our renewed glory.\n\nAll hail the Storm Queen, may she bring us victory in the grand skies above!"


SLC_take_control:0 "Assuming Direct Control"
SLC_take_control_desc:0 "With all effective opposition removed and the armed forces willing to accept orders from Ravakh, we are now in position to begin the journey towards communism. To begin this journey in earnest, it is imperative that we eliminate all immediate threats to the regime; first and foremost of which are the Uzerasi and their traitorous leader Imamu."

SLC_total_class_reorganisation:0 "Complete Class Restructuring"
SLC_total_class_reorganisation_desc:0 "Chattel slavery is of little moral difference than economic slavery and both should be abolished as soon as possible. Unfortunately the Rainband contains multitudes and is not nearly as industrialised or developed as Marks proposes a society to be in their writings. As such we must do what we can to rid ourselves of the former and subsequently prepare ourselves to be rid of the latter."

SLC_revolutions_crew:0 "This Revolution's Crew"
SLC_revolutions_crew_desc:0 "To say that we are lacking in intellectual support - and in intellectuals generally - would be to make quite the understatement. There are few who are truly loyal to the cause, but chief amongst that few are the crew of Ravakh’s old airship. Though they will need training to be truly effective in certain roles, they will serve as shining examples of Marksism in state operation."

SLC_anti_storm_banner:0 "Under One Crimson Flag"
SLC_anti_storm_banner_desc:0 "Thanks in no small part to the western rebellion, it has become quite clear to all yetis that cooperation is necessary in order to defend ourselves. Disunity only brings victory to the doorsteps of traitors, and none are truly willing to betray our glorious revolution. Together against our enemies, together against the enemies of Marksism and together beneath one banner!"

SLC_new_army_conglomeration:0 "Branch Conglomeration"
SLC_new_army_conglomeration_desc:0 "In the most blunt of terms, the command structure of the armed forces was gutted by the western rebellion. Certainly a shame, but not entirely to our detriment. We must replace the most reactionary amongst those who remain within the general staff if we wish for our movement to survive. Replacements can be found in the air force, although they too will require training."

SLC_reorienting_nationalisation:0 "Reorient the Nationalisation Drive"
SLC_reorienting_nationalisation_desc:0 "The short lived Storm Queen’s policy of centralisation during the reconstruction was not without merits. A state owned and operated network of farms which provide a stable supply of grain and subsequently food to fuel the industrialisation of the state will be immensely beneficial in the long term; although it will necessitate buying out large amounts of property, or the application of force."

SLC_acceleration_of_capital:0 "Acceleration of Capitalism"
SLC_acceleration_of_capital_desc:0 "Disrupting our current process of industrialisation and economic growth with sweeping change would end poorly for all involved. The last thing our still-fragile nation needs is another economic crisis. In light of this, we will divert state funding to businesses and provide cuts in tax for new enterprises. If we wish to see Marksism, then we must first accelerate into capitalism."

SLC_rapid_politicisation:0 "Rapid Politicisation"
SLC_rapid_politicisation_desc:0 "Although Marks’ manifesto stipulates that it is the emerging working class who will become collectively conscious of their predicament, our movement’s success was not achieved in this way. In fact, the vast majority do not even know what Marksism is. In light of this, it is the army first that will receive ideological training to ensure that the revolution remains protected by its most faithful."

SLC_regulated_republicanisation:0 "Regulated Republicanisation"
SLC_regulated_republicanisation_desc:0 "Whilst it is important to rid ourselves of autocracy and feudalism, it should not be a change that is forced. Real change does not happen at gunpoint, it is a slow process that takes acclimatisation, education and a lot of patience. The armed forces will be given access to the same texts as everyone else so that they may deduce the crimes of our autocrats themselves."

SLC_vertical_compression:0 "Vertical Compression"
SLC_vertical_compression_desc:0 "Although it will add to the messiness of the ongoing reorganisation of the army, it is clear that structural change is required. We shall implement a compression of command chain positions, simplifying the military hierarchy whilst encouraging low ranking officers and new recruits to push for promotions. No doubt this plan will have teething issues, but those can be resolved with time."

SLC_proletkulture:0 "Proletkulture"
SLC_proletkulture_desc:0 "If we wish to appeal to our significant minority of labourers that make up Marks’ described proletariat, it is imperative that they understand their importance. Their number, small but growing, are to inherit the nation. They must be driven visionaries of Marksism and set an example to all who join their ranks in the factories. Their emerging ‘proletkulture’ shall lead us onward!"

SLC_classes_with_red_texts:0 "Agri-Culture"
SLC_classes_with_red_texts_desc:0 "Though Marks’ masterpiece specifically notes the significance of the factory labour proletarian, we are not yet an industrialised state. Our lowliest class is the typical mainland subsistence farmer, those who cannot read and have little to no education. We must reach out to them with all our means in order to ensure they understand their revolutionary duties and their future in labour."

SLC_seek_out_red_patriots:0 "Calling All Patriots"
SLC_seek_out_red_patriots_desc:0 "We are in dire need of recruits and have been since the end of the Storm King’s reign. We cannot afford to be picky in times like these and the armed forces cares not the political leanings of its soldiers, at least not yet anyway. We must fall back on the kingdom’s most dedicated, be they old or young, big or small. Let our bravest fight for our cause!"

SLC_our_kin_in_need:0 "Our Kin in Need"
SLC_our_kin_in_need_desc:0 "Poverty is a scourge that must be excised if we wish our fledgling republic a prosperous future. The proletariat cannot become aware of its collective identity on an empty stomach or in a dilapidated home, and so we shall provide for them! Clothes for the cold, food for the hungry and homes for the homeless; a chance to become productive is more than enough!"

SLC_expand_existing_facilities:0 "Expanding Existing Facilities"
SLC_expand_existing_facilities_desc:0 "Intelligent as she admittedly was, Ibyz Icepaw has already made some headway in the construction and operation of modern research facilities. It is our duty to finish and expand these projects as necessary to accommodate our growing research needs both military and civilian. Never again will we be technologically embarrassed like we were at Ain Trotgourait!"

SLC_more_creatures_to_teach:0 "More Creatures to Teach"
SLC_more_creatures_to_teach_desc:0 "The Hyenas have fought with us more than any other creatures that we’ve met in our travels thus far. They are a noble and strong people, but they are equally misguided. They do not yet understand the glories of Marksism that await us and it seems unlikely that they will see things our way without. We must show them the path to progress and walk it alongside them."

SLC_revolutionary_state_laboratories:0 "Revolutionary State Laboratories"
SLC_revolutionary_state_laboratories_desc:0 "Science and innovation is an absolute necessity in any modern state, but it has become quite apparent that our staff is neither extensive nor Marksist enough. They are responsible for creating the technology that future generations will use for years to come, and as such they must take upon themselves the mantle of revolutionaries. Those who refuse it, well..."

SLC_heroism_in_science:0 "Heroism In Science"
SLC_heroism_in_science_desc:0 "We all need heroes to guide us in troubled times and scientists are some of our best and brightest. Even if perhaps there are many who do not yet understand the sheer importance of Marksist doctrine, we can all at least put our faith in the sciences and strive to be as resourceful and diligent as they are! Together we shall stand and unshackle the chains of antiquity and decadence!"

SLC_project_funding_equity_board:0 "Project Funding Equity Board"
SLC_project_funding_equity_board_desc:0 "It is hardly surprising to learn that there is a storied history of certain projects - military ones in particular - receiving special funding privileges from yeti leadership. In a new age of equity and progress, such injustices simply cannot stand. A new regulatory board shall be created with the responsibilities of auditing existing projects and evaluating new projects as fairly as possible."

SLC_our_monolithic_society:0 "Our Monolithic Society"
SLC_our_monolithic_society_desc:0 "Together we have already achieved such greatness, not as a horde of bickering tribes but as a collective society administered by a caring - if paternalistic - state. We have done much and shall do much more as we march onward into the great unknown of history to be. We will follow in the footsteps of the Storm King and make our kind rightfully proud once more."

SLC_lending_your_tools:0 "Lend Your Tools!"
SLC_lending_your_tools_desc:0 "Where once we demanded the army go out of its way to help our citizens, we now ask our citizens to help out each other. Lend one another your tools, your expertise and your ears; lend others what you can afford to give away and do not covet your means. To be true Marksists we must not simply do what we can, we must do also what others cannot!"

SLC_force_application_not_projection:0 "Force Application, Power Projection"
SLC_force_application_not_projection_desc:0 "The revolution may - for now at least - be safe from internal threats, but it is by no means safe from external ones. We must make a show of force of an enemy that has vilified us since the days the Storm King. The Great Lakes shall know Marksism soon by its strength and not by the weakness that at first plagued our regime. Long live comrade Ravakh, and long live the fires of our revolution!"

SLC_storm_civil_war.1.t:0 "Out of Retirement..."
SLC_storm_civil_war.1.d:0 "It had been some time since Ibyz Icepaw had last enjoyed a half decent rest. Organising a war effort without the support of a traditional civilian government was no small feat and it had expectedly been exhausting. Soon enough she would once again find herself back in Mzizima coordinating supply chains and doing her best to persuade the Uzerasi to provide more resources that the directorate would use. She had known it would be a stressful, difficult and bloody process; but if that was the price of ensuring the kingdom’s future stability then such means justified the ends.\n\nShe sighed and slumped back a little in a seat that had very obviously not been designed with yetis in mind, grunting with slight displeasure as her arms and legs jutted precariously out. Comfortable as the chair was, it was a reminder that when all was said and done she’d still have to contend with issues like Zwahile-yeti relations; a task that, amongst many others, was particularly unappealing.\n\nFortunately, such matters could wait for now. The zebras were cooperating, the directorate was seen as a stabilising force and she was respected amongst yetis and zebras alike.\n\nShe ran her calloused fingers over the scars on her chin and simply sat; enjoying - to the extent that the undersized chair would let her - this brief moment of silence. It was unlikely that there would be many more of these in her future, but such was the nature of leadership. Hopefully things would calm down at least a little when the civil war was over. The less thought about what might happen if she lost, the better.\n\nJust as the field marshal was beginning to sink into the seat a little, she heard the unmistakable sound of heavy yeti army boots approaching her office.\n\nIbyz sighed, allowing herself to smile just a little as she stood up once more. “You may enter.”"
SLC_storm_civil_war.1.a:0 "...and into the fire."

SLC_storm_civil_war.2.t:0 "The Last Remnant of a Dynasty"
SLC_storm_civil_war.2.d:0 "“My friend, this is... a very steep price for a railway. You do understand just how much you are requesting out of my family’s pockets, yes?" The zebra asked, as politely as he could.\n\nIbyz Icepaw nodded, her expression as difficult to read as ever. “I am well aware, Imamu. I am also aware that such a price would be far too high for any other Zwahile family. It will pay for the railway system as well as the engines and cars that run along it.”\n\nThe zebra winced as he took another look at the immense price tag. Imamu understood the necessity of cooperating with the field marshal if his family and influence was to survive the civil war; unfortunately, that occasionally meant that he would be faced with a request like this. It was a price he could pay, but his family would not be happy to learn that he had agreed to pay it. On the other hoof, if Icepaw herself was making such a massive request then it probably meant that it was a project he should support.\n\nHe set the paper down on the table between them with a contemplative frown on his face, “I assume you also know that my peers will not be best pleased to learn that I have accepted such a... ‘challenging’ contract, shall we say?”\n\n“That was my understanding, yes.” The yeti acknowledged, before raising a finger to continue. “I plan to repurpose it into a largely civilian railway after the civil war. You may consider it an investment, if that makes the deal easier to accept.”\n\nHe held a hoof to his snout for a moment, before picking up a pen and begrudgingly signing off on the construction project. “I do sometimes wonder if deciding to work with you was a poor choice, Ibyz.”\n\n“The alternative would have been far worse for both of us, my friend.” She returned with a subtle smile, inspecting the paper for a brief moment."
SLC_storm_civil_war.2.a:0 "Imamu couldn't tell if it was a threat or an admittence of his influence."

SLC_storm_civil_war.3.t:0 "A Quiet Night"
SLC_storm_civil_war.3.d:0 "The sound of exasperated grunts filled the cool night air as two yetis drove their shovels into the dirt over and over. It wasn’t an easy job and they were both eager to get it done, but it was at least a pleasant reprieve from frontline combat.\n\nIt would have been a slightly more enjoyable experience if not for the fact that one of the two yetis was a storm creature. That wasn’t to say that storm creatures were not appreciated amongst yetis of course, quite the opposite was true, but it was very difficult to make conversation with one. They weren’t much for talking.\n\n“Do you know what we’re looking for? Seems unlikely that they’d just put loose weapons in the ground, so I’d guess crates of some kind.” The yeti asked, finishing his sentence with another loud grunt as he shifted a full shovel to the side.\n\nThe storm creature looked up and stared at him for a second or two, its bright cyan eyes piercing the darkness of the night with only occasional blinks. Without a word it threw aside its own oversized shovel and reached into the hole they had been digging, then proceeded to grab hold of something before wrenching it right out of the ground. After a few moments, it set the object in front of the yeti with a grunt and tapped it.\n\nA sealed wooden crate.\n\nReeling from the suddenness of the gesture and the demonstration of the creature’s raw strength, the yeti took a good look at the box with a slow nod. “I... I see.”\n\nWith that it grunted and returned to its work, hunched over the hole and simply moving the dirt with its hands now that they’d found the exact location of their prize. Eventually the yeti joined in once more, having resolved to not attempt small talk a second time."
SLC_storm_civil_war.3.a:0 "No wonder they're such good soldiers."

SLC_storm_civil_war.4.t:0 "Hooves and Hands"
SLC_storm_civil_war.4.d:0 "Each of the creatures stood at attention as Ibyz Icepaw reviewed their files, taking her time with each of the three documents so as to be absolutely certain of her choice. Before her were three of the most talented commanders that were to be promoted to officer positions. Two yetis and a zebra, each hardened by battle and each ready to serve the directorate to their full capacity.\n\nRising from her desk, she slowly walked in front of the closest yeti. “Savuk Cloudburst. I have been informed that you have a history of correcting the mistakes of your commanding officers. Is this true?”\n\n“Yes ma’am.” He replied simply.\n\nHer eyes settled calmly on his, “Am I making a mistake in promoting you?”\n\nThe much younger yeti allowed himself to return the stare for just a moment, “No ma’am. I did not enlist to fear my superiors, rather to learn from them and do my duty to the kingdom.”\n\nShe nodded and continued to the zebra that was almost hidden between the other candidates. “Jahi. You are a member of the Uzerasi family, yes?”\n\nThe zebra did not so much as blink, even as Icepaw towered over him. “Yes ma’am.”\n\n“And you earnestly wish to support my government?” She asked, monotonously probing.\n\n“Yes ma’am,” He began, “I shall serve you if you continue to serve my people. It is my duty as a warrior to fight for those that would fight for me.”\n\nOnce again the field marshal nodded and took a few steps, this time to face the last of the promotees. “Gaz Boltrider. It has been brought to my attention that you are - in the words of a subordinate - a ‘brilliant yet merciless leader’. Do you intend to treat all with the same disdain, or is this behaviour selective?”\n\nFor a moment she stayed entirely silent, considering her words carefully. “I lack mercy for those that would see an inept monarch on the throne. I lack mercy for traitors and for those that would prefer anarchy over stability and accord. In this I am selective, ma’am.”"
SLC_storm_civil_war.4.a:0 ""Mmm, very well. Congratulations to all three of you on your promotions.""

SLC_storm_civil_war.5.t:0 "Can't Spell Firearm..."
SLC_storm_civil_war.5.d:0 "TODO - Imamu and Icepaw once again find themselves discussing semi-civil matters as Icepaw has begun a project of industrialisation through the existing military infrastructure and production facilities. Imamu is obviously hesitant as it will make his people more reliant on the needs of yeti overlords (they only get paid if the yetis need guns etc) but concedes that it is the quickest and most surefire way to industrialise."
SLC_storm_civil_war.5.a:0 "...without some industrial fire."

SLC_storm_civil_war.6.t:0 "Correctional Division 343"
SLC_storm_civil_war.6.d:0 ""A poor bunch of recruits if I ever saw one," the yeti mused aloud as he came to a halt before them, the massive paws hidden behind his back. Freezing cold eyes regarded each zebra in turn, studying them. "I guess I’ll have to make do though," he finally sighed.\n\nZehlani tried not to look at him. The zebra was in fact too busy keeping her own legs from shaking. She shot a stealthy glance to the side, spotting quite easily the anxious look on most zebras present on the field. Not that she could blame them really. Zehlani had never held a rifle in her hooves before, and she suspected the same to be true for the others as well. War had come to Zwahile many times, and she and her family had been able to steer clear of it through sheer luck. But now? Was the Directorate going to throw them all as disposable meatshields in front of the yetis? Accepting that offer had seemed a better alternative than rotting in a forgotten cell, but she was now starting to have her doubts.\n\n"I’m Captain Thundershock, and from this point on I’ll be the one supervising your training over the following weeks." His powerful voice boomed across the training ground. "Each of you has been given the chance to redeem yourself in the eyes of the Directorate through military service. The fact that you have been convicts in the past is inconsequential to me; by the time the training is complete, I expect you to perform, fight, and win like a proper military unit. The Directorate has no use of dead bodies, and neither have I; so no, none of you will be ordered to charge the enemy with nothing but a sharp stick. From now on, you are soldiers under Commander Ibyz Icepaw, and you’ll achieve your freedom through military service." He reached down to pick up a bolt-action rifle from a nearby crate, checking the weapon with seasoned proficiency.\n\n"Now, let us begin from the basics.""
SLC_storm_civil_war.6.a:0 "They still weren't expecting to survive."

SLC_storm_civil_war.7.t:0 "Sweat in the Air"
SLC_storm_civil_war.7.d:0 ""I would prefer if you could avoid resorting to physical punishment for the time being. After all, my workers cannot meet the Directorate’s quotas when they have broken limbs," Zanif said. The yeti overseer by his side grumbled something under his breath too faint to be properly discerned. He tightened the grip on the baton held in his meaty paws. The two of them were walking on one of the many gangways hanging over the factory’s floor, granting them a commanding view of the dozens of zebra workers labouring below. The clattering and clanking of tools filled the air.\n\n"I honestly don’t see the reason for it," the yeti finally commented sourly. "They are slaves, so they’ve got to be kept in line. They may not have chains on them anymore but that’s what they are. Half of them don’t even understand the machines they’re using. You release your grip on them for just a moment and then-"\n\n"Yes, I know. But believe me, there is no need for such methods. The workers here receive food for their service, so their families are not at risk of starving, and the Directorate gets weapons. I see it as a purely beneficial arrangement," Zanif explained. The yeti overseer let out a scoff before falling silent. Any further discussion was interrupted by a scream renting through the air. Zanif looked down from the gangway, blood draining from his face as he saw one of his workers contorting on the ground, one of her forelegs turned into a bloody pulp.\n\nThe yeti sighed and grimaced by his side. "Right. I’ll send someone to go get a medical team. Now, if you'll excuse me boss, I’ve got bleeding to stop. She wont meet the Directorate’s quotas otherwise, right?""
SLC_storm_civil_war.7.a:0 "Blood on the floor."

SLC_storm_civil_war.8.t:0 "Bright Sparks"
SLC_storm_civil_war.8.d:0 ""Well, I reckon this is the last one," the yeti said. He lifted the crate effortlessly, balancing it on his right shoulder. He chuckled softy under his breath. "You’d think the troops would be more careful and leave nothing of their old stuff behind. None of the foals got hurt in the meantime, right?"\n\nFrom behind the teacher’s desk, Zajuma looked up from her papers. She flashed him a genuine smile. "Oh, not at all, don’t worry. If anything, they seem to find the idea of their school being a former military barrack rather exciting." She shook her head. "I can’t really share their enthusiasm given the condition of the structure. Or the lack of actual teaching equipment for that matter."\n\n"That bad, huh?" the yeti asked, to which Zajuma simply shrugged.\n\n"Well, it’s not actually all bad. Before this, I had to make do with whatever the village could provide, which was not a lot. I had to do many of my lessons in the open, with all the problems that entails once winter settles in. Actually getting paid is a nice bonus, and the foals like it here too. It is a good start."\n\nThe yeti grunted something in assent under his breath before taking his leave, carrying the last of the boxes back to the truck outside. Zajuma sighed in relief once he was out of view; they had been lucky that those boxes had contained only old and dusty documents. To think she had lost sight of those two fillies for barely five seconds. The zebra shook her head and went back to work. That was, until a creeping concern crawled its way to the front of her mind."
SLC_storm_civil_war.8.a:0 "We double checked that the armoury was empty, right?"

SLC_storm_civil_war.9.t:0 "Bread and Behemoths"
SLC_storm_civil_war.9.d:0 "The creaking of wheels filled the air as the Storm creatures pushed the leaden carts past the village’s gates and into the main square. Zusian spotted them from the window, just as his dad shouted for his sister to get back inside and the street emptied before the marching yetis. They towered over the zebras and carried massive weapons by their side. Some were big enough to easily loom over the smaller huts.\n\nZusian dashed out of view with a yelp as one passed right beside the window. If they noticed him, the Storm creatures didn’t react; the only sound coming from them was the labouring breath behind their battle masks. Not that they really needed to communicate; Zusian had seen them when they had come before, bringing empty carts with them to carry away part of their harvest. Always in silence. Creatures that big didn’t need words to be intimidating. Despite himself, Zusian peeked through the window once more. Had the Storm creatures come to take more from them? It wasn’t unheard of. His mother used to tell him and his sister tales about it.\n\nSo caught up he was in his own thoughts, Zusian almost missed the Storm creatures coming to a synchronized halt in the village square. They pulled back the sheets covering the carts, revealing the piles of bread and green vegetables beneath. A soft groan escaped Zusian’s stomach but the zebra failed to notice it, his eyes still following the towering creatures as they simply marched out of the village, carts waiting behind. They had not spoken a single word the entire time.\n\nThe uneasy silence lingered over the village for a few more minutes, zebras spying the carts from behind windows and at a distance, almost fearful to approach them. That however quickly ended as soon as Zusian’s sister and a couple of other foals rushed ahead and snatched away a loaf of bread from the cart, much to their parents’ annoyance."
SLC_storm_civil_war.9.a:0 "Maybe the big ones aren't so bad."

SLC_storm_civil_war.10.t:0 "The Epicentre"
SLC_storm_civil_war.10.d:0 "The thundering sound of footsteps echoed throughout the ancient corridors as Icepaw made her way deeper inside the Eye of the Storm’s palace, her security detail of Storm creatures marching behind, weapons at the ready. It was strange for her to finally return there after all that time. Icepaw would have never considered herself a sentimental yeti, yet her mind couldn’t help but dig up past memories, of her serving loyally and skilfully the Storm King; even when the first cracks in his façade of invincibility had appeared. She had visited the Eye before, always for official business, back when the Storm King began his great campaign of conquests across Zebrica. Destiny had brought her to the Eye once more, but as a restorer of order in a land ravaged by civil war.\n\nIcepaw paused for a moment, a chilly breeze blowing past her from one of the windows, the wind whistling softly through the cracked and broken glass panes. It did somewhat pain her to notice the damage done to the fortress during the fighting. The garrison had fought ferociously to defend the Eye, even when the battle had clearly turned against them, forcing Icepaw’s forces to root them out step by step. Her officers on the ground had not dared bringing out their heavier guns to break the enemy entrenched positions for fear of damaging the ancient capital. Icepaw had personally overturned that order once resistance had stiffened. Still, she was glad to find the Eye’s palace still standing, more or less. Looking through the window and outside, Icepaw noticed one of the main bastions, cracked open by demolition charges during the fighting.\n\n"Restoring the palace is going to be... costly." the yeti noted with a quiet sigh. Though it wasn't long before the beginnings of a smile made an appearance on her face. Down in the courtyard below, her Storm creatures were lowering the last of the garrison’s flags, soon to be replaced with her own colours."

Every so often the city’s industries would go quiet, usually only for a few days before a few creatures’ paychecks were enlarged or the protests became more trouble than they were worth for the average zebra or yeti. In either case, the already minor problem just sorted itself out after a while with little to no intervention on the part of the government.\n\nThis time however, things were very different.\n\nAt first it seemed much like any other workers’ strike as many zebras left their workplaces and took to the streets chanting various slogans. Authorities were informed and some military police were dispatched, but few expected any violence.\n\nWhen pink flags and portraits of the late Azali - the last ruler of an independent Uzerasi kingdom and Imamu’s mother - began to appear amongst the slogans demanding better wages, it became clear that this was no ordinary march. More and more zebras have since joined the protests and it has escalated to the point that the regional governor is relocating military police from other areas in an attempt to keep things under control.\n\nMultiple accounts of violence instigated both by the stationed yetis and by the protestors have been reported as the peaceful march is gradually turning into a widespread riot. Yeti-operated businesses and government buildings have expectedly been the main recipients of ire and property damage alike.\n\nIt is impossible to tell whether the event was organised or spontaneous, though it seems most likely that it was a combination of both; a wage protest co-opted by Zwahile anti-state elements. More importantly, the Mzizima riots have not shown any signs of losing steam as violence has only escalated with more troops pouring in every day. Something has to give."

Ibyz had barely the strength left in her to read it all, only then to wish that she’d had a little time to prepare for this conversation. The zebra’s demands at the negotiating table had all been met, but it was overtly clear to her that he wasn’t here to talk politics.\n\nAt first it looked like he was going to eviscerate her with a string of furious remarks, which would have been well deserved considering the chaos and suffering she had caused; but the yells never came. It was taking every bit of strength, but the grimace on Imamu’s face insisted he stay calm. Slowly, ever-so-slowly, the rage subsided primarily into muted sorrow as tears welled in his eyes.\n\n"A part of me... didn't want to give you a second chance,” He began, taking as much time with his words as he could to avoid falling apart completely, “A part of me wanted so badly to go ahead with the revolt, even after the negotiation.

SLC_dual_tree.62.t:0 "A Somewhat Grey Day"
SLC_dual_tree.62.d:0 "TODO - Imamu sighs and takes in the fact that AES and MTO turned them down almost immediately. It's not the biggest issue in the world since they were probably the least beneficial allies, but it still sucks to get so wholly rejected."

SLC_dual_tree.67.d:0 "TODO - Ibyz comes back with tea and manages to pry Imamu from his desk, although he’s resistant at first. They sit in his room and share the pot and Ibyz asks if he’s okay to which he expectedly says that he’s fine, but he obviously hasn’t slept enough over the last week or perhaps longer. At first she doesn’t have the words to convey what she wants to say, but eventually Ibyz manages to explain that he needs to chill out a bit because she’s starting to see herself in him and not in a good way. He’s not a full-on bureaucrat at heart and always forcing yourself to do what you feel you need to do is exactly how she almost caused a second civil war."
SLC_dual_tree.67.a:0 "He simply stared at her with tired eyes for a moment."

SLC_dual_tree.68.t:0 "Shut Down"
SLC_dual_tree.68.d:0 "TODO - Imamu obviously isn’t used to this kind of deep conversation with Icepaw (and vice versa) so he has to take a moment to process what she’s saying. For a moment it looks like he’s about to dismiss what she said but he agrees after just staring into space for a while. He agrees to make time for himself and Icepaw says she’ll hold him to that, which gets a chuckle (partly because he knows she will and partly because of the role reversal)"

SLC_dual_tree.69.t:0 "Sweet Smells"
SLC_dual_tree.69.d:0 "TODO - Some time has passed and Imamu is currently looking for Icepaw who has usually come to find him in order to get away from work by now.

SLC_dual_tree.70.d:0 "TODO - He’s not much of a cook so once the crockery and cutlery is out - he puts the latter on the furniture rather than the dining table - he mostly just stands beside her and watches the process and passes Ibyz things as she asks for them. It’s quite therapeutic to watch since she’s so knowledgeable about food that she doesn’t need to weigh out ingredients, just does it almost like art."
SLC_dual_tree.70.a:0 "Were the food not ready, he would happily have kept watching."

SLC_dual_tree.71.d:0 "TODO - As they sit down to eat next to one another Ibyz apologises for making him wait and says she wanted to share her main hobby with him. Imamu of course was observant enough to know what she was doing from the get go, and didn't mind. He shuffles up next to her instead of sitting opposite - catching Ibyz off guard slightly - and then compliments her cooking. Hiding of subtle yeti blush ensues and Imamu pretends not to notice with a grin."

SLC_dual_tree.72.d:0 "TODO - Imamu and Ibyz are taking a stroll along a dirt path beside a river, Ibyz having almost dragged him straight out of an Uzerasi family meeting. Imamu mocks annoyance at being dragged out but drops the act after getting a stifled laugh out of the Storm Queen. Eventually they come across a bench by the riverside and decide to take a seat since they’ve been walking a while and it’s warm out. Ibyz gestures to the contingent of storm creatures a ways behind them - unsubtly as always - to leave them be."

SLC_dual_tree.73.d:0 "TODO - For a little while they sit in silence. Imamu is enjoying a moment of peace and quiet and Ibyz is enjoying his company despite the lack of conversation. After a bit, Imamu turns to Ibyz and asks why she asked the storm creatures to give them some space; to which she honestly responds that she enjoys being alone with him and finds his presence comforting. Imamu does his best to stay composed at that response and turns to look at the storm queen with a slightly dopey smile. "
SLC_dual_tree.73.a:0 ""Is that all, your majesty?""

SLC_dual_tree.74.t:0 "Gust"
SLC_dual_tree.74.d:0 "TODO - She looks back at Imamu with a subtle smile of her own and sighs, making a sort of ‘fuck it’ gesture as she decides to just go for it. She addends her previous response by admitting that talking to him has started to give her butterflies over the past few months and isn’t really sure how to handle that beyond spending time with him. Before she can think about regretting saying it he gets up, takes a step or two forward on the bench and lays his forelegs over her lap when he sits back down again; prompting Ibyz to timidly put an arm over his back and stroke his coat."
SLC_dual_tree.74.a:0 "Their fur was as soft as it looked."

SLC_dual_tree.75.t:0 "Settle"
SLC_dual_tree.75.d:0 "TODO - As Imamu nuzzles his head into her surprisingly soft fur, he sighs and admits that he’d been having similar feelings but didn’t want to ruin the one part of his routine that was keeping him sane by botching or failing to start a more serious relationship. He also offers an apology for not being more direct with her about his inner dialogue - knowing that she’s not great with taking hints - which she accepts."

SLC_dual_tree.76.t:0 "Warship Ride"
SLC_dual_tree.76.d:0 "TODO - Imamu and Ibyz are on a custom airship which Imamu is borrowing from Ravakh for the night. They’re going to a local restaurant in the zwahile, although Imamu is keeping it a surprise for now. They’re not far off of the ground and it’s the evening so the pair are just enjoying each other’s company whilst ‘people watching’ with a pair of binoculars.

SLC_dual_tree.77.t:0 "Unsurprising Perfection"
SLC_dual_tree.77.d:0 "TODO - Having walked from the settled airship and through the village, the pair enter a very small place that serves food. It’s just large enough for a few tables and the ceiling barely allows Ibyz to walk with a slight hunch, but the atmosphere is great. Nobody bats an eye at a yeti walking in and someone comes over with two plates of Pilau not long after they sit down; with Ibyz’s portion being appropriate for her size."
SLC_dual_tree.77.a:0 "Imamu couldn't help but smile as she gave her food a toothy grin."

SLC_dual_tree.78.t:0 "Evening Stroll"
SLC_dual_tree.78.d:0 "TODO - Having finished their meal, the pair are walking slowly back to the airship with Imamu leaning some of his weight on Ibyz and Ibyz absentmindedly stroking his mane. She thanks him for taking him out which leaves them walking in a sweet silence. As Imamu takes a few steps up the steps to the airship, Ibyz gently stops him from going any further and gives him a kiss on the snout now that he’s actually at a convenient height for it. It’s a tad clumsy, but still very sweet."
SLC_dual_tree.78.a:0 "It wasn't the last kiss they shared that night."

SLC_dual_tree.79.t:0 "Detox"
SLC_dual_tree.79.d:0 "TODO - Ibyz comes to Imamu’s quarters as he’s finishing up some work and studies his workflow as she removes some of her typical formal garb and puts it at the foot of his bed. Eventually he puts his pen down and Ibyz is like ‘may I?’ and he’s obviously like ‘may you what’, wondering why she's asking for permission to kiss him, at which point Ibyz picks him up like a cat which obviously takes him by surprise but he doesn’t mind being held. She takes him to his bed and sets him down again with an apology that he responds to with a little chuckle and just comments that it was surprisingly comfortable"
SLC_dual_tree.79.a:0 "Undignified perhaps, but comfortable nevertheless."

SLC_dual_tree.80.t:0 "Discussion"
SLC_dual_tree.80.d:0 "TODO - Ibyz is big spoon to Imamu and they’re talking about what the best way to go about revealing their relationship would be. If they go to the army they’ll probably be fine with it but it’s still pretty unusual, if they tell the nobles they’ll probably freak out because it will mean they’ll freak out about Imamu possibly not continuing his bloodline even though neither of them are really thinking about that sort of thing for the moment. They agree that a short public announcement once things settle down a bit with the integration project is probably best and get back to snuggling."
SLC_dual_tree.80.a:0 "Everyone will make a big fuss in any case."

SLC_dual_tree.81.t:0 "Decision"
SLC_dual_tree.81.d:0 "TODO - As the sun goes down outside Ibyz says she should probably go back to her quarters, but Imamu turns over and asks her to stay. She’s a little wary of that request at first as she’s really not used to that sort of thing; but as he nestles in beside her with seemingly only a desire for her company she just smiles and nods, wrapping her arms around Imamu and holding him snugly on the bed."
SLC_dual_tree.81.a:0 ""There's nowhere I'd rather be, Imamu.""

SLC_dual_tree.82.t:0 "Bran Flakes"
SLC_dual_tree.82.d:0 "TODO - Event of Imamu and Ibyz having breakfast together one lazy morning in her chambers where one of them staying with the other overnight has clearly become a regular thing. Ibyz has cooked them both something and they’re clearly very comfortable in each other’s presence even like this now with Imamu returning a kiss from Ibyz as she sits down to eat with him."
SLC_dual_tree.82.a:0 ""Mmm... Good morning to you too, your majesty.""

SLC_dual_tree.83.t:0 "Good Dates"
SLC_dual_tree.83.d:0 "TODO - Once they’re all finished up with breakfast and the cleaning up after the fact, Imamu asks Ibyz what she’s going to be doing for the day and she says that for once she’s doing absolutely nothing. Imamu says the same (having deliberately aligned his schedule with hers) and they decide wordlessly to spend the day together."
SLC_dual_tree.83.a:0 "How very convenient."

SLC_dual_tree.84.t:0 "Later Day"
SLC_dual_tree.84.d:0 "TODO - Ibyz has gotten up from the sofa she was cuddling Imamu on and is ‘talking’ to a storm creature that’s doing its best not to notice Imamu getting up and moving over to her bed with the bare minimum of regalia on. She eventually gets the storm creature out of her hair only to turn back and find that Imamu is splayed comfortably over her side of the bed and gives her a dopey grin as she saunters over with a somewhat timid yet typically domineering look on her face, which elicits a fierce blush and a slightly excited yelp from the zebra."
SLC_dual_tree.84.a:0 ""What have I gotten myself into...""

SLC_dual_tree.85.t:0 "Morning Splay"
SLC_dual_tree.85.d:0 "TODO - Imamu wakes up to Ibyz completely on top of him and gradually realises that his hips are really rather sore as the events of the day before slowly come back to him. Ibyz is still asleep and it’s the early hours of the morning so he just sighs happily and closes his eyes to enjoy the embrace until they both have to get back to work, although he dreads getting up and walking around. Drifting happily back to sleep he could only think,"
SLC_dual_tree.85.a:0 "Worth it."

SLC_dual_tree.86.t:0 "The Calm"
SLC_dual_tree.86.d:0 "TODO - Ibyz and Imamu are preparing their best dress together, making sure they look the part for their announcement and occasionally commenting positively on the other's appearance. They're nervous, but in a good way."
SLC_dual_tree.86.a:0 "Closer and closer the moment came."

SLC_dual_tree.87.t:0 "Before"
SLC_dual_tree.87.d:0 "TODO - Ibyz and Imamu make a speech and close it by confirming what most assumed to be incorrect rumours that they're secretly lovers, wince they actually are. At first the crowd of zebras and yetis is silent out of mostly shock, and then someone shouts "LONG LIVE THE KING AND QUEEN" and the crowd erupts into applause"
SLC_dual_tree.87.a:0 ""All hail the Diarchs of Hurricane!""

SLC_dual_tree.88.t:0 "The Brilliant Storm"
SLC_dual_tree.88.d:0 "TODO - Walking calmly down from the balcony, Ibyz and Imamu share a sweet conversation as they approach the entrance to their main residence in the palace. They're mostly just trying to put the mild anxiety to rest before the head out to stand before the crowd."
SLC_dual_tree.88.a:0 "Through the great wooden door, a single step brought a hundred cheers."

SLC_dual_tree.89.t:0 "An Allocation Matter"
SLC_dual_tree.89.d:0 "TODO - Ibyz and Imamu are essentially sitting in on colossal row between a number of officers, a number of uzerasi family members and their own desires to integrate the great lakes (IF THEY'VE CONQUERED IT). Basically it's a fucking mess and they have to settle it before Ibyz has to wrestle them into submission."
SLC_dual_tree.89.a:0 "The roads in the Zwahile have caused trouble enough."
SLC_dual_tree.89.b:0 "We must dedicate our resources to our new territories."
SLC_dual_tree.89.c:0 "It is imperative that our most central infrastructure is sound."

SLC_dual_tree.90.t:0 "Chemical New Wave"
SLC_dual_tree.90.d:0 "TODO - Another debate upon the allocation of research funds has ensued. The army of course wants some research with potential military applications encouraged, the Uzerasi obviously want zebra alchemy explored further as a matter of family pride"
SLC_dual_tree.90.a:0 "There are plenty of fascinating alchemical possibilities."
SLC_dual_tree.90.b:0 "The military arguably saved the kingdom, we owe it this much."

SLC_dual_tree.91.t:0 "Silly things"
SLC_dual_tree.91.d:0 "TODO - a silly argument between an officer and a noble has erupted in an ethnically 50-50 region with traditionally powerful uzerasi landholders but a proud population of yetis. They've been at odds for quite some time, but the choice of uniform colours has proven most tricky."
SLC_dual_tree.91.a:0 "The yetis will use the pink trim and simmer down."
SLC_dual_tree.91.b:0 "The landowners will simply have to accept the cyan trim."

SLC_dual_tree.92.t:0 "Workforce Quarrel"
SLC_dual_tree.92.d:0 "TODO - a dispute between a uzerasi procurement officer and a yeti industrialist has caused quite a stir. Nothing major, but the yeti wants to diversify their weapons production to make sure they stay in business for a long time; but the procurement officer insists that they just want more guns instead"
SLC_dual_tree.92.a:0 "Eventually the procurement officer had her way."
SLC_dual_tree.92.b:0 "With enough yeti 'charisma', the plant owner's request was granted."

SLC_dual_tree.93.t:0 "The Lines"
SLC_dual_tree.93.d:0 "TODO - a debate on the management of the new railway systems has come into being. An Uzerasi noble wants to give the trains a secondary transport capacity so that they can haul goods and get the economy going. The yeti officer wants to make sure it's ready to transport troops to the commonwealth's most dangerous territories."
SLC_dual_tree.93.a:0 "Providing economic incentives to engage is paramount."
SLC_dual_tree.93.b:0 "Ensuring an organised and rapid mobilisation is imperative."

SLC_dual_tree.94.t:0 "The Boxes"
SLC_dual_tree.94.d:0 "TODO - a disagreement over the exact organisation of the new regional delegate voting system has arisen and in this moment the local polcie commander is having an argument with an influencial uzerasi trader. the latter wants the vote to be held in the market since it's already a place where people congregate, and the police officer is concerned about the security of the location and how private the voting would be; instead suggesting the police station."
SLC_dual_tree.94.a:0 "The station would be too intimidating."
SLC_dual_tree.94.b:0 "The market presents too many risks."

SLC_dual_tree.95.d:0 "TODO - After a little while of serving meals beside this yeti, she notices Kyrvaz sitting a few spaces away from the older yetis and asks if they get a lot of kids. The manager says usually no since they’re usually processed in the foster care system these days, but Kyrvaz refuses to go through the adoption process ‘again’, whatever that means. He remarks that he’s a bit of a troublemaker and the other yetis prefer not to talk to him since he tends to fight - or try at least try to fight, usually they leave him alone out of pity - for his personal space. Ibyz asks if she can give him a second portion, which he cautiously accepts."

SLC_dual_tree.96.d:0 "TODO - As Ibyz is going over to Kryvaz with another portion of soup, the manger talks to one of the other yetis ‘like we’re all about to get fired because he’s about to do something stupid’. But instead of that she sets the food down in front of him, gives him a little smile, they share a gaze for a few moments, and she starts walking back again which was unexpectedly peaceful. Before she can get back though, Kyrvaz jumps up and runs to hug her; which nobody was expecting."

SLC_dual_tree.97.t:0 "Wire Brush"
SLC_dual_tree.97.d:0 "TODO - ack to Ibyz’s perspective now and she’s kind of going ‘oh shit what’ because this isn’t the reaction she expected at all and she has no idea how to handle this situation. After a moment or two with the room doing its best to avoid looking at her, she puts her arm around him and returns the hug; which encourages him to let go.

SLC_dual_tree.98.d:0 "TODO - The guy basically says ‘wtf was that’ and she just goes idk man.

It fought off attacks from the Mazwi on many occasions and remained miraculously independent in spite of the seemingly overwhelming odds against it. Unfortunately - like many others - they would rapidly fall to the Storm King’s revolutionary tactics.\n\nImamu is the current family head of the Uzerasi, having succeeded his mother to the position after she died in a horrifically one-sided battle with the Storm King’s legions. Ironically, his survival is thanks in large part to Ibyz Icepaw who offered him amnesty if he agreed to pay lip service and cooperate with the occupation forces that followed the invasion. Whilst the family and its legacy survives, it’s fair to say that their current arrangement isn’t exactly what Imamu would describe as ideal.\n\nFor his part however, Imamu remains very optimistic and ever-charismatic. Since the western revolt he and the Storm Queen now work closely together in an attempt to manage the curious internal politics of the Dual Monarchy. Although it took some time for Ibyz Icepaw to forgive his treachery, the pair are now closer than ever.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: RyanBoi"

SLC_imamu_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 14th of June 972 in Mzizima\n\n§YBiography§!: Before the arrival of the Storm King, the then proud Uzerasi kingdom sustained itself primarily on trade and managed to field a relatively impressive force of soldiers and mercenaries. It fought off attacks from the Mazwi on many occasions and remained miraculously independent in spite of the seemingly overwhelming odds against it. Unfortunately - like many others - they would rapidly fall to the Storm King’s revolutionary tactics.\n\nImamu is the current family head of the Uzerasi, having succeeded his mother to the position after she died in a horrifically one-sided battle with the Storm King’s legions. Ironically, his survival is thanks in large part to Ibyz Icepaw who offered him amnesty if he agreed to pay lip service and cooperate with the occupation forces that followed the invasion. Whilst the family and its legacy survives, it’s fair to say that their current arrangement isn’t exactly what Imamu would describe as ideal.\n\nFor his part however, Imamu remains very optimistic and ever-charismatic. The initially tense relationship between himself and Ibyz has gradually turned into a genuine friendship, albeit one with a strange power dynamic. The pair genuinely enjoy working with one another with Imamu taking responsibility for much of public relations and Ibyz Icepaw helping him with his finances in turn. They don’t always see eye-to-eye, but more often than not they find it best to cooperate with one another.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: RyanBoi"

He was one of many captains that took part in the looting of Northern Zebrica and the conquest of Hippogriffia. By then he had become a veteran of some renown in the air fleet, but even his extensive experience could not prepare him and his crew for the complete military collapse that would soon follow.\n\nThey barely escaped with their lives, just managing to patch machine gun holes in the fabric of the ship’s airbags as a squadron of Arisian fighters finally hit the edge of their operational range. Their ship, the High Tide, was one of only a few to survive first contact with the new and previously unseen Hippogriffian aircraft.\n\n It was on the slow - and thankfully peaceful - journey home that he came across a particular political piece. The crew had been burning books from all over to fuel the engines and reading them first to pass the time, but a copy of the Communist Manifesto by one Caramel Marks piqued their interest. In no time their captain was studying the writing himself and discovering a second calling..."

They rectified her mistakes together and bonded all over again.\n\nAlthough their frequent close proximity to one another occasionally sparked some questions, there were few that suspected a deeper relationship to form. Not only did they frequently need to spend hours a day together on royal duties, but Imamu had been a close friend of the Storm Queen for many years. There were of course rumours, particularly when the pair began to spend many more nights in the same place, but the Storm Creatures that guarded their residences and the Eye’s palace kept quiet; as ever.\n\nThen, just like that, they broke the news. The Hurricane Commonwealth came to know the relationship between its diarchs and all were stunned, then overjoyed.

He reasons that this is because the records in which his details were kept were destroyed in the wake of the civil war, but few believe these claims.\n\nWhilst this bureaucratic hurdle would have dissuaded the Storm Queen prior to the western revolt, the current state of the general staff has necessitated his recruitment. Luckily, he has demonstrated passable skills in the role thus far; although the mystique surrounding his personal life remains all the same.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: BlakaSmoko"

SLC_kryz_snowsheet_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 18th of February 981 in Raging River\n\nKryz, niece of Urzak. Under any normal circumstances, the Storm Queen would have turned her nose up at the idea of recruiting someone so reckless; but she had little room to be fussy in the wake of the western revolt. On recommendation from the young yeti’s uncle, she was inducted into the general staff without much hassle.\n\nThe yeti certainly shows promise as an aggressive commander, but equally shows little sense of self preservation. Perhaps that is simply the curse of youth, or perhaps it is because Urzak has done his best to protect her up until now. Whichever it may be, Kryz will soon learn to control her fiery temper; or else she will soon find herself stranded far behind enemy lines with a gun to the back of her head.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: BlakaSmoko"

### Focus Loc ###

SLC_storm_civil_war_start:0 "Once More Into Battle"
SLC_storm_civil_war_start_desc:0 "It has been some time since Ibyz Icepaw last saw full-scale warfare, but her years of running an occupation in the west have not dulled her senses or reduced her capacity. The time has come for His Majesty’s finest soldiers and commanders to prove themselves once more. Inept pretenders will not sit on that throne."

SLC_scw_call_up_police:0 "Call up the Garrisons"
SLC_scw_call_up_police_desc:0 "The opening months of the civil war have proven that our troops stationed in local garrisons are a largely unnecessary measure. The Zwahile accepts our rule on the understanding that we will keep their lives stable and safe, which means that the military police would serve them better on the front than in the streets."

SLC_scw_reignite_forges:0 "Rekindle the Old Forges"
SLC_scw_reignite_forges_desc:0 "Despite its lacking industrial development, the Zwahile coast served as a key part of the Storm King’s supply chain during his conquests of western and northern Zebrica. It is high time we modernised the old weaponsmithing facilities and set them to work supporting the war effort. They will be ready to serve, again."

SLC_scw_uzerasi_connections:0 "Our Uzerasi Connections"
SLC_scw_uzerasi_connections_desc:0 "The Uzerasi family are simultaneously our greatest allies and our worst enemies. They successfully fought against the Mazwi before the Storm King demolished both kingdoms in one fell swoop, but Icepaw saw the value in local help. The connections and friends she made half a decade ago now have their own role to play in the civil war."

SLC_scw_unearth_old_weapons:0 "Buried Stockpiles"
SLC_scw_unearth_old_weapons_desc:0 "When the Storm King suddenly passed away, many divisions returning from the north of Zebrica buried their weapons in the Zwahile. Whilst this was mostly to avoid turning them over to the then unstable government, many low level officers respected Ibyz Icepaw and her foresight which drove a considerable number of them to disclose the locations of their caches. Waste not, want not."

SLC_scw_zwhaile_backbone:0 "The Zwahile Backbone"
SLC_scw_zwhaile_backbone_desc:0 "Despite the significant minority of yetis that has slowly emerged amongst the zebra population, the vast majority of the region’s businesses and overall wealth lies in the hooves of the Zwahile. Relying on their patronage will give them more power in the long term, but it is a necessary evil for the survival of the regime."

SLC_scw_occupation_backbone:0 "The Directorate's Efficiency"
SLC_scw_occupation_backbone_desc:0 "Though our zebra friends hold and generate a very large proportion of the directorate’s wealth, they have proven to be poor industrial organisers. They may not like the military stepping into their affairs, but they’re unlikely to complain about the jobs that new munition plants will provide."

SLC_scw_new_blood:0 "Trial by Fire"
SLC_scw_new_blood_desc:0 "When at war, field promotions at low levels are a necessity to maintain a competent chain of command. Officers rarely see combat however and as such the command structure often suffers in the long term unless new blood is brought into high level positions. Ibyz has marked several promising commanders for promotion to avoid such issues."

SLC_scw_acquire_production_materials:0 "Production Material Procurement"
SLC_scw_acquire_production_materials_desc:0 "Whilst the Zwahile lacks much in the way of urban development, some population centres like the Uzerasi city of Mzizima have used steel in the creation of new buildings for several years at this point. It will cause some discontent, but confiscating their construction materials for the war effort will benefit the directorate immensely in the long term."

SLC_scw_form_collaborator_divisions:0 "Form Collaborator Battalions"
SLC_scw_form_collaborator_divisions_desc:0 "Despite being ruled over by a foreign yeti field marshal, the Zwahile largely accepts its place as a part of an alien political entity as a guarantor of its own stability as it did with the Mazwi before our arrival. They value their way of life and are willing to fight for the autonomy that Icepaw has generously granted them, all they need is a willing officer to command them."

SLC_scw_military_industrial_complex_beginnings:0 "Military Production as an Industrial Model"
SLC_scw_military_industrial_complex_beginnings_desc:0 "Though there are dangers associated with embracing the military-industrial complex as a significant part of any economy, there are even more associated with ignoring it. Much of our existing industrial infrastructure is already built to supply the legions and expanding upon it is both a reliable and sensical method of broad industrialisation."

SLC_scw_call_into_the_caves:0 "Call Out Into the Caves"
SLC_scw_call_into_the_caves_desc:0 "There are few who understand the ways of storm creatures and even fewer that understand why they serve yeti leaders and rulers so willingly. Some observers compared their relationship with regular yetis to that of the Bronzehill dogs and Herzlander griffons during the Storm King’s conquest, though their fealty is not necessarily granted only to one family of monarchs. They will answer our call."

SLC_scw_reactivate_old_fortifications:0 "Reactivate Old Fortifications"
SLC_scw_reactivate_old_fortifications_desc:0 "The continued success of the Storm King was not a surefire thing. Icepaw - knowing that disaster would eventually strike, but not when - constructed defensive fortifications in Uzerasi family land half a decade ago, but they never saw use. Now however they may serve a purpose in the civil war, once they’re moved to the other side of a few rivers."

SLC_scw_live_fire_munitions_testing:0 "Premature Munitions Development"
SLC_scw_live_fire_munitions_testing_desc:0 "Before its reorganisation into a contender in the civil war, the directorate was given little besides the most basic equipment and designs to subdue the Zwahile. Unfortunately, the armed forces are no longer fighting peasants and require heavier ordinance; ordinance that can only have its effectiveness tested on the frontlines where malfunctions can and will result in civilian deaths."

SLC_scw_zwahile_penal_divisions:0 "Zwahile Correctional Divisions"
SLC_scw_zwahile_penal_divisions_desc:0 "Penal divisions are not a new concept, yet thus far Icepaw has avoided them as a method of waging war and punishing dissidents. Recently however, it has become apparent that more soldiers are needed and that prisoner conscription is a good source. Many zebras will be distressed by this particular policy change, but needs must."

SLC_scw_formalise_informant_groups:0 "Formalise Informant Organisations"
SLC_scw_formalise_informant_groups_desc:0 "We have run an extensive network of informants to keep a close eye on the Zwahile for many years now, but previously there was never a reason to further organise them. Now, with a hope to establish a new national government, creating an intelligence agency that functions in tandem with our existing network is a clear next step."

SLC_scw_equality_for_service:0 "Incentives to Engage"
SLC_scw_equality_for_service_desc:0 "Zwahile zebras have traditionally operated on subsistence farming in small family groups in largely rural areas. Whilst this has entirely negated the risk of regional nationalist movements, it also means that they contribute very little to the directorate’s growing economy. We will need to provide incentives if we wish to break the cycle."

SLC_scw_work_for_your_foals:0 "Work for your Foals"
SLC_scw_work_for_your_foals_desc:0 "Arms and ammunition are important, so important in fact that the questionable morals of employing zebras in production facilities for little to no pay can be overlooked. Needless to say that constructing and operating such factories will not be popular, but it may well be necessary."

SLC_scw_overzealous_aircraft_experimentation:0 "Overzealous Aircraft Experimentation"
SLC_scw_overzealous_aircraft_experimentation_desc:0 "Developing a modern stockpile of planes in the Zwahile was never a realistic proposition in the past; now however, heavy investments in such craft could give us a significant edge over the enemies of the kingdom. Unfortunately, bulldozing houses to create airfields near production facilities will not be popular."

SLC_scw_repurpose_siege_weaponry:0 "A New Generation of Siege Equipment"
SLC_scw_repurpose_siege_weaponry_desc:0 "Morale is an immensely important part of horizontal cohesion and incredibly large guns are a good way to bolster our own whilst shattering that of the enemy. It is regrettable that the easiest way to make them is by tearing up roads to remove and use large sewage pipes, but the benefits of doing so far outweigh the admittedly immense costs."

SLC_scw_for_the_good_of_all_yetis:0 "For the Good of All Yetis"
SLC_scw_for_the_good_of_all_yetis_desc:0 "There is a simple way to explain Icepaw’s motivation for fighting in this civil war. Between a tyrannical mage, a corrupt plutocrat and a loyal field marshal; who would the average yeti choose as a ruler? It is in the best interests of every yeti to support the directorate, lest they suffer further at the hands of an inept successor. Her victory is necessary."

SLC_scw_acquire_merchant_marine:0 "'Acquire' a Merchant Marine"
SLC_scw_acquire_merchant_marine_desc:0 "Despite the region’s lacking technological development, the Zwahile coast and the Uzerasi family in particular retain strong traditions of naval warfare and maritime trade. We would do well to requisition some of their vessels to support our war effort, though it goes without saying that many zebra sailors will be less-than-pleased by such a move."

SLC_scw_protect_skies:0 "Protect the Skies"
SLC_scw_protect_skies_desc:0 "Anti-aircraft weaponry has proven very dangerous to aircraft and aeroplanes alike, which makes it a worthwhile investment to protect our limited production facilities. The thunder of guns will be a reminder to the Zwahile that we protect them, no matter the cost."

SLC_scw_make_military_personable:0 "Give the Zebras a Smile"
SLC_scw_make_military_personable_desc:0 "When it comes to zebra-yeti relations, our kind have always struggled. Even the most elderly yeti towers over the average zebra which leaves them mildly intimidated at best and utterly terrified at worst. By sending military engineers on leave to help them in construction projects, we hope to reduce the perceived threat that our species poses to zebras."

SLC_scw_garrisons_into_schools:0 "Old Barracks, New Schools"
SLC_scw_garrisons_into_schools_desc:0 "The barracks belonging to the many military police divisions now serving on the front line have stood idle for some time despite their typically urban locations. Converting them into schools will be a worthwhile investment, even if it means we’ll need to build some new barracks later when the divisions return to their original stations."

SLC_scw_provide_relief:0 "Providing Food and Shelter"
SLC_scw_provide_relief_desc:0 "Many zebras have been left without basic amenities as a result of the civil war, either through displacement or simple destruction. This is an opportunity for the directorate, both to show the Zwahile how much we value their safety and to coax more creatures into working in state-owned businesses for the war effort."

SLC_scw_expand_zwahile_network:0 "Expand the Zwahile Network"
SLC_scw_expand_zwahile_network_desc:0 "Our intel gathering operations have never been so successful, both for collecting information on enemy positions and for keeping an eye on the Zwahile. Expanding operations to accommodate more aggressive intelligence acquisition and to facilitate future interests in the Great Lakes is a valuable investment and signifies the success of the MID."

SLC_scw_extend_military_engineer_role:0 "Extend the Role of Military Engineers"
SLC_scw_extend_military_engineer_role_desc:0 "Previously military engineers on leave were encouraged to volunteer in assisting civilian projects which has thus far been immensely beneficial for the directorate and the Zwahile as a whole. The next step is to use civilian projects as an integral part of engineer training, something that will benefit both the military and our zebra friends."

SLC_scw_one_last_drive:0 "One Last Recruitment Drive"
SLC_scw_one_last_drive_desc:0 "Recruitment is a difficult prospect when only about ten percent of your population fully supports your involvement in a long-winded civil conflict, but it is not impossible. Yeti and zebra alike understand the consequences of losing their chance at an even-tempered and intelligent ruler and are willing to fight for her with a little extra encouragement."

SLC_scw_icepaw_the_protector:0 "The Protector of the Zwahile"
SLC_scw_icepaw_the_protector_desc:0 "Despite the fact that yetis are seen by most zebras to be unwelcome guests, it is still possible to cultivate a positive reputation amongst them. Ibyz Icepaw is far from perfect, but she has protected the Zwahile and its interests in spite of the circumstances. For her efforts, she has earned considerable political clout in Uzerasi and Zwahile circles."



SLC_begin_reconstruction:0 "Begin the Reconstruction"
SLC_begin_reconstruction_desc:0 "Before looking outward and entirely restoring normalcy, the kingdom must undergo a period of careful reconstruction. The scars of the civil war are deep, the Zwahile grows restless and the many creatures within our borders worry about their future. Time must be taken to recover and set a course for the future prosperity of the Storm Kingdom."

SLC_prepare_the_east:0 "Prepare the East"
SLC_prepare_the_east_desc:0 "The east has long been an area of immense strategic value, all the more in recent times for the hyenas’ renewed interest in reclaiming their old territories. It is imperative that war infrastructure in the east is constructed to provide a reliable supply network, one that will double as civilian infrastructure once the hyenian threat has passed."

SLC_public_works_projects:0 "Public Works Projects"
SLC_public_works_projects_desc:0 "With a firm hold over what remains of the kingdom’s institutions, the first economic step in the reconstruction process is an obvious one. Political and economic infrastructure is a requirement for the workings of a modern nation state and the employment opportunities that such projects can provide will help in easing the woes of the people."

SLC_analyse_succession_war:0 "Analyse the Succession War"
SLC_analyse_succession_war_desc:0 "The succession war was - for all the pain and suffering that it caused - a fascinating conflict. It provided ample opportunity to develop our outdated strategies and tactics in a truly desperate scenario that warranted experimentation in all areas. In amongst the devastation, doubt and despair; the Storm Queen sees opportunity."

SLC_socioeconomic_studies:0 "Conduct a Socioeconomic Census"
SLC_socioeconomic_studies_desc:0 "It is impossible, or at least very challenging, to attempt a period of reconstruction and growth without the requisite knowledge of the creatures that you are supposed to be helping. A detailed series of censuses will be required to effectively assist and understand the current status and attitudes of the population."

SLC_put_down_dervishes:0 "Put Down the Dervishes"
SLC_put_down_dervishes_desc:0 "The time has come to put down the hyenian threat for good. With the Storm King and his utterly destructive methods out of the picture, a lasting peace where their culture persists under our rule is possible. Before we can consider our future rule however, we must consider the conquest itself."

SLC_rennovate_research_labs:0 "Renovate the Research Labs"
SLC_rennovate_research_labs_desc:0 "Much like the rest of the Rainband, His Majesty’s labs are out of date and in a state of disrepair beyond that. Conducting research under such conditions would yield little of value and so it shall be the goal of the Storm Queen and her coffers to restore and retrofit the state research department. Our kind shall one day be on the cutting edge once more."

SLC_combat_regionalism:0 "Combat the Regionalist Epidemic"
SLC_combat_regionalism_desc:0 "Whilst their objectives are understandable, regionalism in the modern day is a surefire way to bring about the downfall of a multicultural state such as the Storm Kingdom. Snuffing out this resistance to centralised rule from the Eye, be it perpetrated by particularly stubborn yetis or any other creature, is a matter of critical importance."

SLC_restore_heartland:0 "Restore the Rainband"
SLC_restore_heartland_desc:0 "Whilst we greatly appreciate the assistance of the Uzerasi and their Zwahile kin, the Rainband is the heart of [SLC.GetNameDef] and requires our immediate attention. The reforms implemented in the west during the civil war shall additionally be applied there and the enterprises of those that worked with the three traitors are to be expropriated."

SLC_reward_zebra_subjects:0 "The Zwahile's Just Reward"
SLC_reward_zebra_subjects_desc:0 "For its diligent service and immense contribution to the monumental task that was victory in the civil war, the Zwahile is to be awarded the first and largest batch of grants and contracts. They have proven their worth to the Storm Kingdom and will no doubt do so again with this immense influx of resources."

SLC_rapid_urbanisation:0 "Rapid Urbanisation"
SLC_rapid_urbanisation_desc:0 "For how impressive its legions once were, the Storm Kingdom remained a largely unindustrialised state under the rule of His Majesty. As our economy expands and factories emerge, it is imperative that we facilitate movement from rural backwaters into the cities in order to support a sustainable rate of growth."

SLC_roll_out_the_armour:0 "Roll out the Armour"
SLC_roll_out_the_armour_desc:0 "Much as airships captured the imagination of the Storm King, so too do tanks enrapture the Storm Queen. Whilst our first attempts at creating prototype vehicles have been without immediate success, the steel behemoths that were developed in the process have proven rather intimidating when included in parades."

SLC_keep_army_zebras_happy:0 "Give Them a Reason to Stay"
SLC_keep_army_zebras_happy_desc:0 "Whilst our Zwahile soldiers are well paid, they still believe that they fight for a regime that is not their own. If we wish to expand our pool of recruits, it is imperative that we offer them opportunities once their deployments are over and reward their dutiful service in the armed forces."

SLC_send_zebras_home_awhile:0 "Let Them See Their Foals"
SLC_send_zebras_home_awhile_desc:0 "Though quite the opposite of a solution to our already strained recruitment pool, granting a period of additional leave to our Zwahile soldiers should help them to see the Storm Queen in a favourable light. Allowing them to return home for a time will also have considerable economic benefits as they proliferate the many practical skills they will have learned in the armed forces."

SLC_dervish_war_infrastructure:0 "Dervish War infrastructure"
SLC_dervish_war_infrastructure_desc:0 "During his rampage, the Storm King operated small networks of supply airships that would ferry resources at relatively great speeds over any and all obstacles. Among other factors, this one is proof that infrastructure has the capacity to greatly ease the burden of war on the state and its creatures. Whilst there are now more efficient ways to transport materiel, the need for infrastructure remains constant."

SLC_retain_occupation_practices:0 "Retain Occupation Practices"
SLC_retain_occupation_practices_desc:0 "Though the disparate creatures of the realm each have their strengths and weaknesses, experience has shown the Storm Queen that the safety and prosperity of yetis is best secured with current methods. Officialising laws that formalise the second class status of non-yetis is sure to displease many, including Imamu; but it is for the good of the kingdom’s core constituents."

SLC_begin_equalization:0 "Begin to Equalise the Races"
SLC_begin_equalization_desc:0 "Take time as it may, slow progress towards equality between the many races within our borders is demonstrably the best choice for the longevity of the kingdom. Cooperation fosters only further cooperation in a positive feedback loop, generating immense capital for the state over time and social cohesion to boot."

SLC_commander_reevaluations:0 "Commander Reassessments"
SLC_commander_reevaluations_desc:0 "There is never a better moment to train than in peacetime. The Storm King may have appreciated the value of surprise and subterfuge, but he did not use his resources effectively; relying on a single strategy that ultimately failed him at a crucial juncture. Our general staff will not be so naive, taking the opportunity that peace provides to broaden their abilities."

SLC_jobs_for_compliance:0 "Well-Paid Work for Compliance"
SLC_jobs_for_compliance_desc:0 "An occupation must provide occupations. There is no greater asset available to a collaborationist regime than the ability to provide employment opportunities and receive compliance in return. Those that cooperate are rewarded and encouraged to continue cooperating, whilst those that do not grow to envy those that do. It is the division and conquest of a society."

SLC_eye_becomes_university:0 "Give the Eye New Purpose"
SLC_eye_becomes_university_desc:0 "The Eye of the Storm was constructed as a vanity project that served no real purpose by the time it was finished. His Majesty’s authority was absolute and the island fortress was redundant upon arrival. It is not without potential, however. The Storm Queen wishes to convert the ageing fortress into a state university, one that will greatly improve the academic capacity of the kingdom."

SLC_one_irrevocable_reform:0 "One Irrevocable Reform"
SLC_one_irrevocable_reform_desc:0 "The practice of slavery is not only morally questionable at best, but it is economically detrimental. Slaves do not contribute to the economy via taxes, nor do they have any educational opportunities that would otherwise serve to increase our skilled labour pool. None can deny the will of the Storm Queen in freeing those bound to service by force."

SLC_factory_work_for_the_able:0 "Factory Work for the Able"
SLC_factory_work_for_the_able_desc:0 "Though not exactly ideal in terms of working conditions, factories provide many low-skill jobs that can be filled by currently unemployed creatures. As an added bonus, a larger and considerably more diverse workforce will allow for innovation within the many emerging industries that should aid in work accessibility and productivity."

SLC_extend_our_reach:0 "Extend Our Reach"
SLC_extend_our_reach_desc:0 "Whilst the airforce no longer requires absurdly large hangars in which to store and prepare airships, in turn there are very few plane-ready airfields in the kingdom. Expanding our deployment capabilities will be greatly beneficial in coming conflicts and air power will be immensely helpful in rooting out some of the more problematic regionalist groups."

SLC_as_with_zwahile_as_with_dervishes:0 "Repeat the Western Strategy"
SLC_as_with_zwahile_as_with_dervishes_desc:0 "The Storm Queen’s years of ruling the Zwahile have proven useful in many ways. Whilst it provided a springboard from which to reunite the kingdom, it also provided a pivotal learning experience for Her Majesty. Efficient and ‘clean’ imperialism can be quite difficult, but there are always some strategies that can be reused from place to place with minimal modification."

SLC_our_true_focus:0 "Our True Focus"
SLC_our_true_focus_desc:0 "War has paved the way for many of yetikind’s technological developments. Chief amongst them being His Majesty’s beloved airships, which were unfortunately rendered obsolete in a period of mere years. Nevertheless, it is only prudent that the military receives the majority of research and development funding; their innovations will spill over into wider society in no time."

SLC_secure_balanced_research_budget:0 "Securing a Balanced Research Budget"
SLC_secure_balanced_research_budget_desc:0 "Much to the pleasure of our academic bodies, it has been decided that additional research funding will be distributed equally amongst all sectors. Whilst the military is somewhat disappointed, they too will receive an additional - if limited - stipend for their research budget. Any minor complaints that they may have can be safely ignored."

SLC_military_industrial_directorate:0 "Military Industrial Directorate"
SLC_military_industrial_directorate_desc:0 "Our economy has worked in tandem with the military machine since we embraced the industrial revolution. It is only natural that the civilian economy evolves to be even further entwined with military production and that an internal restructuring of the overseeing body is organised to facilitate both sectors functioning as one."

SLC_maintain_the_effort:0 "Keep Up the Civilian Support"
SLC_maintain_the_effort_desc:0 "It is the duty of the armed forces to protect the civilians and their way of life, not to intrude upon them. We will continue to encourage cooperation with the military, but in accordance with the original principles of our ‘Helping Hand’ policy. The Storm Queen would have failed in her duties if the armed forces were to take precedent over the creatures of the realm."

SLC_modern_storm_creature_role:0 "The Modern Role of Storm Creatures"
SLC_modern_storm_creature_role_desc:0 "Storm creatures in the army have been having somewhat of an identity crisis as to their formal role at the tactical level. His Majesty had them serve as his personal bodyguard, but the Storm Queen has no intention to waste their immense potential in that fashion. Their purpose will be that of shock troops which will provide breakthroughs for attached infantry to exploit."

SLC_lay_dervishes_to_rest:0 "Lay the Dogs to Rest"
SLC_lay_dervishes_to_rest_desc:0 "Though they may still dream quietly of freedom, the hyenas are now seemingly content with our rule. Their religion is permitted, their customs allowed to persist and their territories are to be administered as core parts of the kingdom. With only this, we have accomplished a feat that the Storm King could not; a lasting peace between hyenas and yetis."

SLC_onwards_and_upwards:0 "Onwards and Upwards"
SLC_onwards_and_upwards_desc:0 "The kingdom has suffered much and endured that which would shatter a weaker people, but it has persisted in spite of the chaos that His Majesty bequeathed to the people. With the reconstruction largely over, we can confidently move towards a better future for yetikind."

SLC_diversify_and_specialise:0 "Service Assimilation"
SLC_diversify_and_specialise_desc:0 "Whilst a warlike society may have its issues, it is not entirely without merit. Service in the armed forces is an opportunity to learn about and accept those that serve alongside you, yeti or otherwise. As the kingdom’s continued existence proves, bonds forged of blood and iron are not so easily broken."



SLC_continental_collab:0 "The Directorate of Continental Affairs"
SLC_continental_collab_desc:0 "Whilst its main functions will be primarily civilian in nature, the overall purpose of the DCA lies somewhere between civilian and military. Its job shall be to handle foreign affairs, a task that encompasses strategic planning and realpolitik as well as comparatively minor trade negotiations and state immigration policies."

SLC_assessing_interenational_position:0 "Assessing Our International Position"
SLC_assessing_interenational_position_desc:0 "To say that our kind is isolated from the rest of the world would be an incredible understatement. He may have been a military genius, but His Majesty failed to recognise the long term damage that he was doing to his people’s reputation. Much of Zebrica despises us, refusing to even speak with our diplomats; we must find a way to resolve this."

SLC_instate_advisory_bodies:0 "Instate the Minority Advisory Bodies"
SLC_instate_advisory_bodies_desc:0 "Whilst the Storm Queen will remain the ultimate authority over all state and military matters, she recognises her own limitations. A yeti is not best equipped to dictate matters regarding zebras and hyenas without help and thus the minority advisory bodies are to be created. A council of creatures from their unique walks of life that are to advise the Storm Queen on policy."

SLC_establish_regional_schools:0 "The Queen Protects Even the Destitute"
SLC_establish_regional_schools_desc:0 "Though much has been done to restore the kingdom’s economy, many of Her Majesty’s subjects remain destitute or in a dire financial position. In an effort to align the people and further develop the kingdom, the Storm Queen has generously agreed to front significant poverty relief costs out of her own coffers for the foreseeable future."

SLC_reunite_hayzeb_zebras:0 "Reuniting the Hayzeb Zebras"
SLC_reunite_hayzeb_zebras_desc:0 "The zebras inhabiting Upper Hayzebland are much like those that live in the Zwahile in that they have been under our thumb for quite some time. What sets them apart from their idealistic Lower Hayzebland kin is a mere border. If we cross that line in the sand, thoroughly crush their upstart ‘Queen’ and the surrounding states then they may one day be just as docile as the Zwahile zebras too."

SLC_formulate_defence_plan:0 "A Formal Defence Policy"
SLC_formulate_defence_plan_desc:0 "Those that had heard of the Storm King knew what his attitude towards diplomacy was: Invade first, raid second and ask questions later. In the modern geopolitical climate, it is imperative that we not relapse into His Majesty’s old habits so that we can be considered trustworthy business partners; or even potentially allies. A formal defence policy is absolutely necessary."

SLC_facilitate_continental_development:0 "Facilitating Continental Development"
SLC_facilitate_continental_development_desc:0 "As we have come to learn, much of Southern Zebrica is economically underdeveloped in comparison to other regions. It is clear that rapid development must begin in order to ensure economic competitiveness amongst the many peoples that we govern on the continent."

SLC_sideline_uzerasi:0 "Sideline the Uzerasi"
SLC_sideline_uzerasi_desc:0 "Their help in the civil war and reconstruction period was appreciated, but the Uzerasi no longer represent an interest group of particular influence. Their once immense sway is now little more than the favouritism we give them, and so they shall take a seat in the minority advisory bodies like all the rest."

SLC_eliminate_great_laker_threats:0 "Dealing with the Desert Dwellers"
SLC_eliminate_great_laker_threats_desc:0 "[CZR.GetNameDefCap] sits upon perhaps the most defensible territory in all of Southern Zebrica. They are uniquely located on the northernmost inhabitable land south of the Zebhara, giving them particularly defensible territory that is highly desirable. The time has come to deal with them and secure their land for the security of the kingdom."

SLC_indiscriminate_recruitment_intellectuals:0 "Indiscriminate Intellectual Recruitment"
SLC_indiscriminate_recruitment_intellectuals_desc:0 "We cannot be fussy when it comes to talent. Zebras and hyenas may be relatively deficient in muscle mass, but they are just as capable as our best scientists in the lab. We must offer all with the appropriate credentials an opportunity to serve the Storm Queen in science if we are to continue this period of unprecedented societal and industrial progress."

SLC_minimum_living_standard_continent:0 "A Minimum Standard of Living on The Continent"
SLC_minimum_living_standard_continent_desc:0 "It is imperative that our non-yeti subjects receive equal treatment when it comes to standard of living. Those that have not enough for themselves are not productive citizens of the kingdom, rendering their work inefficient and their tax contributions minimal at best. The time has come to introduce and enforce a series of industrial and homeowner audits to protect the productive."

SLC_reaching_out:0 "[SLC_reaching_out_dyntext]"
SLC_reaching_out_desc:0 "[SLC_reaching_out_dyntext_desc]"

SLC_efficient_extraction_methods:0 "Develop Efficient Extraction Methods"
SLC_efficient_extraction_methods_desc:0 "Resource extraction is a significant part of the kingdom’s regional economies and - more importantly - where most of the Rainband investment from yeti benefactors goes to. We would do well to develop new technologies that would allow such enterprises to operate at an even greater efficiency."

SLC_protect_regional_traditions:0 "Protect Regional Traditions"
SLC_protect_regional_traditions_desc:0 "Our tolerance for the multitudinous cultures that make up southern Zebrica has come as quite a surprise to many of our subjects, but they still fear our interference. The time has come to enshrine certain regional traditions - within reason - for each of the kingdom’s unique creatures. We shall not squander our victories, this time."

SLC_third_advisory_body:0 "The Third Advisory Body"
SLC_third_advisory_body_desc:0 "A considerable number of Hayzeb zebras have lived within the kingdom’s borders for many years, but until recently we have not held sway over the entirety of their population. Given that our war against the Great Laker states was waged on the grounds of reuniting the Hayzeb, it is only right that they receive representation for their compliance. A fine example they shall serve as."

SLC_secure_northern_buffer_regions:0 "Securing the Northern Buffer Regions"
SLC_secure_northern_buffer_regions_desc:0 "Though they are compliant and well rewarded for their service, much of the Great Lakes serves primarily as an enormous buffer region that protects the core territories of the kingdom. With this in mind, their annexation into the realm proper will not necessitate a lengthy process of cultural assimilation; merely economic and infrastructural integration."

SLC_low_interest_industrial_grants:0 "Low Interest Industrial Grants"
SLC_low_interest_industrial_grants_desc:0 "To say that the great lakes and much of the continental interior is underdeveloped would be quite an understatement. Though the primary goal of our renewed expansionism is security, it would be prudent for the state to provide low-risk grants; drastically accelerating initial industrial and technological developments on the continent."

SLC_divert_laker_ire:0 "Diverting the Ire of the Lakes"
SLC_divert_laker_ire_desc:0 "Ovingoland was yet another product of the Storm King’s rampage across the continent, created in concept by the refugees fleeing the Great Lakes from his wrath. They were not spared of course, as he soon traveled north and crushed the Maregyptians that had agreed to protect them. We shall reunite the Ovingo zebras with their Great Laker kin, as is our right."

SLC_rapprochement_ancient_pact:0 "Attempt Diplomacy With the Pact"
SLC_rapprochement_ancient_pact_desc:0 "War with the ancient pact is not a desirable outcome for the Storm Queen. In an ideal world, His Majesty would not have caused the loss of the Cornerstone and angered the centaurs so; sadly such is the reality we must face. We will attempt diplomacy with the pact and mobilize for war, knowing what the centaur response will be."

SLC_cooperation_through_capital:0 "Cooperation Through Capital"
SLC_cooperation_through_capital_desc:0 "Money is quite a motivator; for some it is enough to serve, but for most it is merely enough to look the other way. Fortunately, this is exactly what we are after. Well-paid labour tends not to pick fights with the local government and - by not opposing the state - helps to maintain the new status quo. State infrastructure projects have never been so beneficial."

SLC_laker_steel_monopolies:0 "State Monopolies on Great Laker Steel"
SLC_laker_steel_monopolies_desc:0 "Though it will no doubt frustrate some of the more traditional elements within the Great Lakes, the steel industry is of critical importance to the kingdom’s civilian and military sectors. It is imperative that the state purchases and secures production of such a vital material before regional competitors begin to crop up."

SLC_wealth_of_arabian_sea:0 "The Wealth of the Arabian Sea"
SLC_wealth_of_arabian_sea_desc:0 "The South Sea is - to be blunt - almost entirely unprofitable. The frigid southern temperatures make it difficult to traverse for approximately half of the year and we have already assimilated the previous regional trade hubs controlled by the Uzerasi. Procuring access to the Arabian Sea will allow us to circumvent many of the disadvantages posed by our problematic geography."

SLC_exploit_peninsular_forests:0 "Exploit the Forests of the Peninsula"
SLC_exploit_peninsular_forests_desc:0 "A sizeable percentage of forest area in southern Senturya is almost inhospitable for a number of reasons, meaning that many safe wooded regions have also been left untouched out of fear. This presents an opportunity for the kingdom, both economic and political; to prove that we can safeguard the centaurs against some of the strange forests whilst providing strategically critical resources."

SLC_avoiding_another_cornerstone:0 "Avoiding Another Cornerstone Incident"
SLC_avoiding_another_cornerstone_desc:0 "The Cornerstone’s loss has entirely eroded any chance of any assimilation of centaurs and gargoyles into the kingdom proper. To directly administer their territories would be a foolish and dangerous endeavour, leaving the Storm Queen with one course of action. A nominally independent union state of the two creatures shall be allowed to govern the region. May they one day forgive us."

SLC_horse_limited_self_rule:0 "Allow the Horses Limited Self-Rule"
SLC_horse_limited_self_rule_desc:0 "Unlike the Great Lakes, direct control of Risea grants us little real benefit. Our primary reason for invasion was to secure efficient trade routes through the Arabian Sea, which can be maintained through a nominally independent union state without expending massive amounts of materiel. The horses can govern themselves, so long as they serve the kingdom’s interests."

SLC_royal_research_committee:0 "The Two Seas Trade"
SLC_royal_research_committee_desc:0 "With access to both the Southern and Arabian Seas, it has become much cheaper and easier to transport goods around the continent. A ship to Zouala and a train ride to Tenkozogo bypasses Hestraya entirely and eliminates any risk of winter ice stalling trade in the Southern Straits. Needless to say that our efforts are already beginning to bear fruit."

SLC_continental_coexistence_charter:0 "The Continental Coexistence Charter"
SLC_continental_coexistence_charter_desc:0 "An invasion will always galvanise the invaded to fight as one against the invader, but that unity rarely lasts after either a victory or a defeat. To ensure that those we have conquered now coexist peacefully, the Storm Queen has devised a series of laws for the express purpose of guaranteeing peace between the various disparate creatures of the continent."

SLC_unfettered_growth:0 "Unfettered Growth"
SLC_unfettered_growth_desc:0 "It is no mistake that the laws for business operations on the continent are so lax. It is for those that we protect to decide how to invest and grow their own industries; less red tape means faster growth, albeit at the expense of good working conditions. Fortunately this has the side effect of pitting the working zebras against their own elites, rather than against us."

SLC_reforms_collab:0 "The Icepaw Reforms"
SLC_reforms_collab_desc:0 "A strong hand, a set of intelligent advisors and a little luck was capable of uniting the disparate yeti species in but a few years; at least to the extent that His Majesty considered necessary. The reality of his legacy is that a strong military legacy has resulted in an underbaked and exploitative political system that leaves the average yeti with very little. The time for change is now."

SLC_diverting_from_sk_methods:0 "Diverting From His Majesty's Methods"
SLC_diverting_from_sk_methods_desc:0 "Whilst the military is important, it should not be the focus of this or any society. The Storm Queen recognises the necessity of His Majesty’s methods, but knows equally that the ends of security do not necessarily justify the means of overwhelming force. There are other - far less dangerous - ways to give one’s subjects a sense of unity and pride."

SLC_queen_protects_destitute:0 "Establish Regional State Schools"
SLC_queen_protects_destitute_desc:0 "Since the kingdom’s first successful wars, there has been a significant non-yeti population within our borders. Unfortunately His Majesty knew not what to do with these lands besides pillage, leaving us to pick up the pieces. The monarchy and the state shall take the burden of regional education upon itself, for the betterment of the Storm Kingdom and its many peoples."

SLC_creation_nation_state:0 "The Creation of a Nation State"
SLC_creation_nation_state_desc:0 "Unification through violence is easy and quick, but it is rarely a recipe for long term success; to even look at the remnants of the Griffonian Empire on a map is to understand that. A nation state requires a shared language, a shared history of suffering and successes and an unifying identity. The Storm Queen alone has the power to shape and cement such an identity."

SLC_monarchy_aligned_people:0 "A Monarchy Aligned with its People"
SLC_monarchy_aligned_people_desc:0 "Many monarchs see their position as a privilege afforded to them by birthright, but His Majesty proved that the opposite was true. A ruler that leaves chaos in their wake will be replaced by another that understands the responsibilities of the role. The monarch is an ally of the creatures they rule, not an unaccountable maniac that can do as they please."

SLC_sorting_succession:0 "Settling the Succession"
SLC_sorting_succession_desc:0 "Perhaps the greatest failure of the Storm King was that he did not select a successor, nor did he attempt to outline the process for others to do so in his absence. It is unlikely that the presence of an heir would have prevented or even slowed the scheming of his advisors, but the law of succession should nevertheless be written. The fewer things that can go wrong, the better."

SLC_evaluate_force_monopoly:0 "Evaluate Our Monopoly on Force"
SLC_evaluate_force_monopoly_desc:0 "The armed forces and the monarchy by extension have held a complete monopoly on force since His Majesty united our people. Out of the former sprang police units, albeit that they were essentially just a branch of the military that exercised force about as freely. It is high time we audited these formations and developed proper low-level law enforcement strategies."

SLC_royal_network_institutes:0 "The Royal Network of Institutes"
SLC_royal_network_institutes_desc:0 "Though the Rainband is not especially well known for its academic institutions, it does contain several universities that produce many talented specialists year-on-year. In the past they were encouraged to compete with designs for military hardware in return for absurd grants, but that limited their capacity. Instead they will now work together, under the purview of the RNI."

SLC_her_majestys_industry:0 "Her Majesty's Heavy Industry"
SLC_her_majestys_industry_desc:0 "Though some may protest the idea that government subsidies are necessary or even worthwhile, there are certain industries that require them. Public services and heavy industry in particular may not always be profitable, but they are necessary for other businesses to thrive and for our national productivity to remain high."

SLC_demil_rainband_police:0 "Demilitarising the Rainband Police"
SLC_demil_rainband_police_desc:0 "Though substantial reorganisation has taken place, the police force remains heavily militarised. It is the Storm Queen’s wish to gradually demilitarise the police across the kingdom to build trust in the state and in the monarchy. Besides, there’s no good reason for a police detachment to have an artillery brigade in tow."

SLC_resources_in_hyenia:0 "Develop Resource Industries in Hyenia"
SLC_resources_in_hyenia_desc:0 "Hyenia - like all places that diamond dogs inhabit - is resource rich. It is no surprise that their exports of material already make up for a considerable amount of the kingdom’s economy, which is why we must play to their strengths. With additional funding and proper mining machinery they will be able to further expand their operations."

SLC_capacity_for_autarky:0 "Capacity for Autarky, Preference of Trade"
SLC_capacity_for_autarky_desc:0 "Whilst closing off the economy to the outside world would - in theory - allow the nation to operate without any sort of assistance, doing so would be foolish. Instead the monarchy will devote funding to stockpiling certain strategic resources whilst planning for worst-case diplomatic scenarios. Even when such a situation arises, we’ll have nothing to worry about."

SLC_bathe_kingdom_in_light:0 "Bathe the Kingdom in Electric Light"
SLC_bathe_kingdom_in_light_desc:0 "Whilst much of the kingdom has an acceptable level of urban development, almost all of it lacks proper electrification; save perhaps the most developed of cities. It is absolutely imperative that we grant additional resources to all of the regional districts for wiring and lighting, allowing all of the Storm Queen’s subjects to enjoy a better and brighter standard of living."

SLC_favour_small_home_businesses:0 "Favour Small Businesses at Home"
SLC_favour_small_home_businesses_desc:0 "Massive corporate enterprises played a not insignificant part in the fracturing of the kingdom once, and they won't be allowed to do so again. The influence of Hailstorm’s glorified propaganda enterprise was a threat that few saw arising until it was too late. High corporate taxes for large companies and grants for new businesses should help with competitiveness."

SLC_directorate_national_infrastructure:0 "The Directorate of National Infrastructure"
SLC_directorate_national_infrastructure_desc:0 "Infrastructure - roads and trains in particular - is of vital importance to the productivity of the economy and the wellbeing of our subjects. Not only do both allow for the transportation of goods and materials but they also provide transport access for the population which opens up more cost efficient travel for leisure and for work."

SLC_reinvest_in_citizens:0 "Reinvesting in the Citizenry"
SLC_reinvest_in_citizens_desc:0 "Whilst Southern Zebrica is relatively sparsely populated, housing that is up to current economic and societal standards is still relatively difficult to come by. Large new housing estates for the middle classes and economically efficient highrises for the lowest common denominator should help to uplift those still dealing with substandard living conditions."

SLC_firm_fair_legal_code:0 "Constructing a Firm but Fair Legal Code"
SLC_firm_fair_legal_code_desc:0 "To say that the current laws of the kingdom were rushed into usage would be quite an understatement. His Majesty cared little for the intricacies of law and as such the legal system as a whole is in a state of tremendous strain and general confusion. It is absolutely imperative that we rebuild the kingdom’s legal code from the ground up."

SLC_never_another_hailstorm:0 "Never Another Hailstorm"
SLC_never_another_hailstorm_desc:0 "Hailstorm was a very intelligent yeti, intelligent enough to realise and abuse the power that his immense wealth gave him. The civil war proved that money is a dangerous thing and the Storm Queen wishes to make sure it can never hold such sway in affairs again. New regulations, checks and upward accountability measures should ensure that governors and civil servants stay in line."

SLC_creatures_strength:0 "The Strengths of the Kingdom's Creatures"
SLC_creatures_strength_desc:0 "Though the national identity of the kingdom is primarily centred around yetis, the kin of the Storm Queen are not a majority of the kingdom’s population. We must take our cultural diversity in stride and make the best of our subjects’ unique skills and abilities. Our diversity does not infringe upon our unity, it only makes us stronger."

SLC_protecting_mountains:0 "Special Protections for the Mountains"
SLC_protecting_mountains_desc:0 "The storm creatures have always been possessive of their cavernous homes. Whether they are simply protective over where they raise their young or if there is some religious significance to their abodes, they have a right to their heritage like all of us. It is our duty to protect their traditions and their homes, as they protect the kingdom when they are needed."

SLC_great_zebrican_summit:0 "The Great Zebrican Summit"
SLC_great_zebrican_summit_desc:0 "It is no surprise that after a half decade of continental chicanery the kingdom is diplomatically isolated. The Storm Queen has decided that we must go far out of our way to normalise relations with those that unjustly suffered His Majesty’s wrath. We shall host a great summit and invite all to see how much has changed and how far we’ve come!"

SLC_hiring_storm_creatures:0 "Encourage the Hiring of Storm Creatures"
SLC_hiring_storm_creatures_desc:0 "A lot of businesses both big and small are understandably hesitant to hire giant muscular monsters that won't or can’t talk. The Storm Queen has mandated the creation of a government subsidy that will make it significantly cheaper for companies to recruit and pay storm creatures. The hope is that - with a little time - they’ll be just as competitive in the job market as any other race."

SLC_progress_innovation:0 "The Royal Research Committee"
SLC_progress_innovation_desc:0 "As with the RNI, the Royal Research Committee's purpose is to encourage collaboration on long-winded or expensive research projects. Unlike the RNI however, the RRC will function more as a management body to link together universities beyond the Rainband; including those in our client states."

SLC_tamed_regulation:0 "Innovation and Regulation"
SLC_tamed_regulation_desc:0 "With any new invention comes a lot of excitement and - if the excitement turns out to be warranted - a lot of investment. What many fail to realise is that innovation is rarely a purely positive thing and regulations must be put in place to ensure that redundancies are accounted for, safety measures are in place and the proper training has been supplied to the workforce."

SLC_right_to_petition:0 "The Right to Petition"
SLC_right_to_petition_desc:0 "Whilst it is important to maintain the authority of the crown over the whims of those who cannot see beyond their own interests, a monarch cannot know everything. Granting the right to petition to all will likely fill the Storm Queen’s desk for a few months; but as time passes she will have access to the greatest catalogue of perceived and real problems in the kingdom."

SLC_codify_regional_liberties:0 "Codify Regional Liberties"
SLC_codify_regional_liberties_desc:0 "Though it is customary to respect the traditions of the land that a creature may find themselves in, the kingdom’s non-yeti regions are yet to receive any explicit cultural protections. This will - courtesy of the Storm Queen herself - be rectified as soon as possible. As the storm creatures deserve such protections, so do all of the kingdom’s peoples."

SLC_enabling_home:0 "An Enabling Home Economy"
SLC_enabling_home_desc:0 "Unlike the relatively unencumbered industries of the continent, the economy of our core territories is well kempt and well regulated. The kingdom exists and persists for the Storm Queen’s subjects and not for power hungry oligarchs or corporate interests. At home, there is always a provision for you; yeti, hyena or zebra."

SLC_kingdom_to_last:0 "A Kingdom to Last"
SLC_kingdom_to_last_desc:0 "We have succeeded where His Majesty failed in all important respects. Most of all however, the Storm Queen has created a political system, an economy and a society that will last beyond her; even beyond her son. There will not be another civil war. There will be no more strife. There will be prosperity, peace and stability."

SLC_his_majesty_never_could:0 "A Victory Over His Legacy"
SLC_his_majesty_never_could_desc:0 "Though grudges remain and work always needs to be done, the Storm Queen is finally free from the shadow of her predecessor. In spite of the innumerable challenges presented by his legacy, Ibyz Icepaw remains; determined and strong as ever.\n\nLong may the Storm Queen Reign!"



SLC_teaching_zwahile:0 "Teaching the Zwahile Its Place"
SLC_teaching_zwahile_desc:0 "The rebellion of the Uzerasi and their misguided followers threw a significantly sized wrench in Her Majesty’s plans for the kingdom. For their betrayal they shall be reminded of what happens to those that stand in the way of this world’s greatest conquerors. Their martyrs will soon have nobody left to revere them."

SLC_economic_globalism:0 "Embrace Economic Globalisation"
SLC_economic_globalism_desc:0 "The Storm King and his advisors saw great potential in soft power through economics, although neither managed to grasp the magnitude of their own achievements. If we cannot redeem ourselves in the eyes of the world, then we shall become such an integral part of it that none would dare try to remove us."

SLC_merely_formality:0 "Merely a Formality"
SLC_merely_formality_desc:0 "Her Majesty’s collaborationist network has all but vanished in the wake of the western revolt, leaving us with no choice but to cement a new doctrine. Recent events have proven that giving the ungrateful too much power is simply dangerous, leaving us with little choice other than to deal with our more unruly subjects with heavy hands."

SLC_unimpeded_extraction:0 "Unimpeded Extraction Operations"
SLC_unimpeded_extraction_desc:0 "To facilitate Her Majesty’s new plans for the kingdom, it is imperative that our resource extraction industries operate always at maximum efficiency. Without our exports, our great nation will be as insignificant as it was for the brief period between monarchs; when the world forgot about the terror a yeti could instil."

SLC_political_command:0 "Her Majesty's Great Task"
SLC_political_command_desc:0 "A monarch has the responsibility and privilege of leading their people and their nation as a whole into greatness. Despite all the struggles, Her Majesty has succeeded in navigating through the mess of traitors and incompetent ministers. In her great task she continues to succeed and shows no signs of faltering, at least for now."

SLC_begin_meep:0 "Begin the MEEP"
SLC_begin_meep_desc:0 "The Military Engineer Electrification Project is an extension of previous military-industrial outreach projects that seeks to provide cheap electricity to the vast majority of the kingdom’s population. Not only will it increase the standard of living all over the kingdom, but it will provide a very hardy power network that can be built upon for years to come."

SLC_great_task:0 "The Political Chain of Command"
SLC_great_task_desc:0 "The Storm King’s lackeys have proven time and time again that ‘politics’ are a farce and that the administration of a state is better left to those with military discipline. The provisional directorate will not return, but its methods of bureaucracy through the military command structure certainly shall; for they are the only appropriate solution."

SLC_highcliffs_chemical:0 "The Highcliffs Chemical Warfare Institute"
SLC_highcliffs_chemical_desc:0 "Chemical warfare is a dirty business on the battlefield, but in the lab it is quite the opposite. A new university shall greatly expand our pool of capable scientists whilst providing insights into the uses of new chemicals of all varieties in a military context. Perhaps not the most desirable of places to get a scholarship for, but students will never pass on such opportunities."

SLC_crush_crimson:0 "Crush the Crimson Troublemakers"
SLC_crush_crimson_desc:0 "Ravakh Cloudcracker and his pitiful little band of blind officers tried and failed to stage a coup that might well have felled the monarchy. He has thus far escaped punishment thanks to a lack of resources, but the existential threat his movement poses has not been forgotten. It is high time his treason was punished, and Her Majesty is not feeling generous."

SLC_restore_staff:0 "Restore the Crippled Staff"
SLC_restore_staff_desc:0 "Thanks to the effected rebellion and the foiled red officer coup, our general staff is looking worse for wear. Fortunately, both events have given rise to promising new leaders that should more than make up for the loss of talented commanders that defected to the reds or the zebras. This time we will place loyalty above all else."

SLC_export_acquisitions:0 "Expediting Export Acquisitions"
SLC_export_acquisitions_desc:0 "With a firm economic bedrock established, the time has come to further tune and entrench our export mechanisms in order to place our kingdom at the heart of the world’s ebb and flow. Of course, many will not be able to stomach us; but with time and effort they will come to see that they cannot find what we offer anywhere else."

SLC_immediate_problems:0 "The Most Immediate Problems"
SLC_immediate_problems_desc:0 "The Great Lakes are a hotbed of instability and represent perhaps the single greatest threat to the future of the kingdom, now that our internal issues have been put to rest. Most if not all of the important figures that hold sway there harbour great resentment against our kind for the actions of the Storm King, thus we must act first."

SLC_recruit_the_poor:0 "Lowest Strata Recruitment Practices"
SLC_recruit_the_poor_desc:0 "There are many ways to reduce poverty rates across the kingdom, but one technique that Her Majesty is soon to implement should be perhaps the most efficient. Recruiting the destitute, those without a home to call their own or any significant personal monetary holdings, will bolster the number of new recruits whilst simultaneously reducing joblessness nationwide."

SLC_extraction_operations:0 "Resource Extraction Operations"
SLC_extraction_operations_desc:0 "Whilst working to improve domestic production has gotten us far, it will not carry the kingdom into the future. No, to truly dominate the global market we will need to extract resources from elsewhere; in clients states that we control via a monopoly on violence. The Storm King would not be able to comprehend the efficiency with which we shall extract riches from our subjects."

SLC_free_market_subjects:0 "The Free Market and its Subjects"
SLC_free_market_subjects_desc:0 "All nations are enslaved by their economic conditions, which is precisely why our strategy of world exports will prove successful. All require resources, all have limited capital with which to procure said resources and so all will come to us in order to secure a reliable trade relationship. Our safety shall be guaranteed by our economic practices just as much as our military might."

SLC_help_war_orphans:0 "A Purpose for the War Orphans"
SLC_help_war_orphans_desc:0 "War orphans are unique amongst the impoverished and the unfortunate for their inextricable relationship with armed conflict. They are not necessarily the most reliable source of recruits; but we may easily pique their interest, either through an appeal to their desire for revenge or simply by offering them a chance to find a new family in the military."

SLC_unstoppable_behemoth:0 "An Unstoppable Behemoth"
SLC_unstoppable_behemoth_desc:0 "Our industrial might is unmatched, having grown exponentially since the end of the civil war. It is an ever-churning engine that demonstrates the strengths inherent to our kind and demonstrates to the world the dominance of yeti technology. We lost a major advantage once at the critical moment, but we shall never lose it again."

SLC_way_to_bay:0 "The Way to the Bay"
SLC_way_to_bay_desc:0 "As economics play a not insignificant role in the wars we choose to wage, it is undeniable that the eastern horse states are an obvious target. Not only are they relatively rich in and of themselves, but their location will provide an excellent jumping off point for more efficient international trade as our overall industrial output continues to accelerate."

SLC_antithesis:0 "The Antithesis"
SLC_antithesis_desc:0 "The Hayzeb are precisely the kind of creatures that we do not wish to deal with head on after the Uzerasi fiasco. We do however have a headstart as we have already subdued roughly a third of their kind within the kingdom’s core territories. Pacifying the rest will be a costly endeavour, but the heartland must have new territories to flex its financial muscles in."

SLC_ancient_threat:0 "The Ancient Threat"
SLC_ancient_threat_desc:0 "The Ancient Pact is perhaps the single dangerous geopolitical entity in our vicinity for two reasons: Firstly because their alliance cannot be broken and secondly because they despise us. The Storm King looted and subsequently lost an artefact they held dear and now we must act before the pact takes its revenge upon us."

SLC_society_purpose:0 "A Society's Greater Purpose"
SLC_society_purpose_desc:0 "Though no race is bred for war, yetis possess characteristics that make us particularly good at that very activity. We tower over most creatures and possess many times the strength of even the largest equines, not to mention our opposable thumbs that allow for ergonomic weaponry. Our purpose is still to live, but in life we may all excel in conquest."

SLC_for_yeti_by_yeti:0 "An Economy Built by Yetis, for Yetis"
SLC_for_yeti_by_yeti_desc:0 "Despite treachery at every turn and the devastation of the civil war, we have perfected an excellent economic model. We provide material for nations across the continent and indeed across the world, leaving all to grumble as they purchase our goods; turning the other cheek to our wars for their own benefit."

SLC_additional_MID_funding:0 "Additional MID Funding"
SLC_additional_MID_funding_desc:0 "The Military Investigative Directorate has proven instrumental in our efforts to prepare invasion plans and subsequently subdue conquered territories. It is high time that we expanded their operational purview and significantly increased their budget so that they can continue to operate across our imperial sphere with maximum efficiency."

SLC_those_left_behind:0 "Those Left Behind"
SLC_those_left_behind_desc:0 "In the wake of our war efforts, there are many unfortunate creatures left to suffer without immediate relatives or the means to survive; not unlike our own war orphans. They are left with no means to live and little help, which leaves them under the protection of the kingdom. We shall provide for them through the occupation forces and give them new purpose alongside their kin in suffering."

SLC_northern_riches:0 "The Northern Riches"
SLC_northern_riches_desc:0 "Maregypt and the little statelet city to its south are both places of immense wealth, literal and historical in the case of the former. Not only will the conquest of these nations allow us to extract said wealth over an extended period of time, but access to the northern bay provides us with yet another excellent string of trade ports that suit our economic interests."

SLC_khan_failings:0 "The Failings of the Shahanshah"
SLC_khan_failings_desc:0 "It was the Storm King’s conquest of the southern horse states that allowed the Shahanshah of Karkadannistan to rise to power in the chaos that followed. Unfortunately, Karkadannistan is not our ally and it could perceivably become a threat to our great kingdom. We shall not waste our time with pleasantries or olive branches, we will simply end this potential threat."

SLC_wayward_camels:0 "The Wayward Camels"
SLC_wayward_camels_desc:0 "Like many of the states that emerged in the aftermath of our empire’s collapse, the camels have attempted to carve out a home for themselves in the ensuing chaos. They cannot be blamed for this treachery, but the yeti that attempted to lead them into the future without support from the Rainband certainly can be. We shall bring them back into the fold, for their own sake."

SLC_green_bay_ports:0 "Green Bay Port Techniques"
SLC_green_bay_ports_desc:0 "To say that our naval tradition is lacking would be somewhat of an understatement, particularly when comparing our fleet to our army and airforce. Fortunately, our new subjects are far better versed in that department and are ‘willing’ to share their knowledge with us. What better way to expedite the production of new ships than with outside expertise?"

SLC_end_manedelusia:0 "Into the Sand"
SLC_end_manedelusia_desc:0 "Azir is an empty desert purgatory that can only be home to the hardiest of desert tribes or the most foolhardy of explorers. To claim the territory as our own is as simple as marching a few well-organised soldiers through the desert and constructing a few outposts. Nobody has any reason to stop us, because the land is worthless to most; even to us it is only useful to run railways through."

SLC_should_have_been_ours:0 "What Should Have Been Ours"
SLC_should_have_been_ours_desc:0 "The resources that the Shahanshah wasted in his failed conquest of the Hestrayan peninsula shall not go to waste under our management. Unlike our other subjects, deposits in Karkadannistan and the frontier will be under the direct purview of the state in order to ensure that the riches the Storm King passed over are not ignored a second time."

SLC_last_charge:0 "Their Last Charge"
SLC_last_charge_desc:0 "Though their leadership has proven its ineptitude, the horse fighters that once served their Shahanshah are not personally to blame for the khanate’s defeat. Their warriors will be offered a chance to fight for their new masters and prove their worth. With the alternative being prison or harsh labour, it is hard to imagine many deciding not to take such an offer."

SLC_boltria_dead:0 "Boltria Dead and Buried"
SLC_boltria_dead_desc:0 "No matter how far the self-styled ‘King Boltrus’ got in his vain attempts to control camel society, it is clear that they were all for naught and that his experiment failed spectacularly. We shall thoroughly bury the remains of what once was, giving the camels a chance to prove their worth in a more meaningful fashion; albeit in service to yetis regardless."

SLC_sweat_blood_misery:0 "Sweat, Blood and Misery"
SLC_sweat_blood_misery_desc:0 "Our wars have taught us much, both during and after the reign of the Storm King. Whilst he chose to ignore the gradually escalating resistance that other states were managing to put up against him, Her Majesty is not so blind. We must constantly reevaluate and strategise; find new ways to defeat our enemies in an ever-more-hostile world."

SLC_northern_dockyards:0 "Our Northern Dockyards"
SLC_northern_dockyards_desc:0 "The northern Maregyptian ports contain a wealth of knowledge both in terms of the designs of the ships that use them and in the skill of those that operate the equipment. It would be a severe lapse in judgement not to recruit willing creatures of military and civilian authority in order to best understand and co-opt their expertise in equipment and theory."

SLC_khans_guard:0 "The Shahanshah's Guard"
SLC_khans_guard_desc:0 "The most elite amongst the Karkadannistani warriors served as guards of the Shahanshah, both in times of war and in times of peace. Whilst Her Majesty will not allow them such a senior position, without service these horses are now looking for work. Many will be willing to serve as instructors or warriors in the Royal Army, although they will need specialised weaponry that can be wielded with hooves."

SLC_dune_lines:0 "The Dune Lines"
SLC_dune_lines_desc:0 "It should come as no surprise that infrastructure in the deserts under our territorial purview is severely lacking. For trade routes to be efficient and reliable, we must expend significant state resources in creating railways and roads that will stand the test of time in such severe conditions. Not many are excited to work under the scorching sun, but the ancients shall see them through."

SLC_new_course:0 "The New Course"
SLC_new_course_desc:0 "The military industrial complex is the most important part of our economy. To pull it from the financial workings of the country as a whole would be to tear our financial system in twain. No, instead we shall do the opposite. To sustain a free market economic model we must reinvest a proportional amount of our budget in the armed forces, thus enabling us to acquire more raw resources for export."

SLC_glory_war:0 "The Glory of War"
SLC_glory_war_desc:0 "War is a fundamental part of the yeti identity. It was war and conflict that forged the kingdom that Her Majesty now presides over. It was violence and bloodshed that decided its successor. It was death and destruction which made our kind feared across the continent. For yetis, war is a glorious pursuit and the time has come to remind the world of our kind's most valued skill."

SLC_uzerasi_gaps:0 "Fill the Gaps Left by the Uzerasi"
SLC_uzerasi_gaps_desc:0 "The untimely rebellion of the Uzerasi has unfortunately left many bureaucratic positions vacant. Whilst some have been filled by members of the armed forces, others require more specialised civilian knowledge which simply does not exist within the military. To fill these roles, we shall recruit up-and-coming civil servants; once they have been through a series of loyalty tests of course."

SLC_mil_eco_first:0 "The Trust of our People"
SLC_mil_eco_first_desc:0 "The western revolt has understandably caused a lot of public unrest, particularly in the areas of the kingdom closest to the rebellion. It is our duty to quell these fears and restore the trust that was lost when Imamu showed his true colours. The Storm Queen will bring stability and prosperity, with or without the support of a few treacherous nobles."

SLC_further_weaponise_police:0 "Further Weaponise the Police Force"
SLC_further_weaponise_police_desc:0 "The current police forces of the kingdom are direct organisational descendants of military police units that used to patrol the directorate. For some time Her Majesty wished to reduce the scale of their service materiel, but it has become clear after the Mzizima riots that even the police must have the equipment to deal with well armed and organised opponents."

SLC_trust_people:0 "Putting the Military Economy First"
SLC_trust_people_desc:0 "Though some don’t like to admit it, the military industrial complex remains the basis of our developed economy and many recently created industries exist purely to support it. It is imperative that we do what we can to sustain and protect military industry, both because of the importance of the materiel it creates and because of its financial importance in our economy."

SLC_mil_consumer_goods:0 "Military Issue Consumer Goods"
SLC_mil_consumer_goods_desc:0 "Whilst the idea of the military-industrial complex providing consumer goods to the general public isn’t exactly an appealing one, it is nevertheless a recipe for success. Military industries already make high quality and reliable products that are used by tens of thousands of soldiers. What other corporate entities are there that can boast such a positive track record?"

SLC_reigning_remainder:0 "Reigning in the Remainder"
SLC_reigning_remainder_desc:0 "The Uzerasi controlled a large amount of industry and infrastructure in the west of the empire before their rebellion and we have been left to pick up the pieces. Luckily for us, this has created an opportunity for the reorganisation of many large companies, allowing the state to take advantage of previously uncooperative enterprises."

SLC_empire_kingdom:0 "An Empire for the Kingdom"
SLC_empire_kingdom_desc:0 "Considering the breadth of His Majesty’s conquests, the fact that our great nation remained merely a kingdom is quite surprising. He likely only kept the name because he was more interested in artefact hunting than the prestige of his people. Unlike her predecessor, the Storm Queen understands the true value of a sprawling empire; beyond the immense wealth it can provide."

SLC_service_scholarships:0 "Scholarships for Service"
SLC_service_scholarships_desc:0 "Scholarships are - sadly - unattainable for many talented individuals simply because of their scarcity and the limited funds of universities. The state can allot such funds, provided the individuals that seek assistance provide a service for the state. Signing up for the military has benefits for all, especially for those who have much to offer the nation so long as they’re given a chance."

SLC_mil_prep_schools:0 "Military Preparation Schools"
SLC_mil_prep_schools_desc:0 "Preparation schools are typically reserved for the well-off, which is precisely why military run prep schools open to all will be such a great success. They will scare some, but instil a sense of discipline and loyalty in many others from a young age; giving them a taste of both future responsibilities and future glories, should they wish to join the army of course."

SLC_resource_recquisition_eco:0 "Officer Requisition Permits"
SLC_resource_recquisition_eco_desc:0 "Though we distance ourselves from the practices of the Storm King, looting is an inherent part of armed conflict. No matter how much we discourage it, it will occur all the same. Instead, Her Majesty has had the foresight to propose a regulatory system for looting that will decriminalise it and encourage commanders to requisition civilian supplies when necessary."

SLC_legacy_of_legions:0 "The Legacy of His Majesty's Legions"
SLC_legacy_of_legions_desc:0 "His Majesty had an incredible overreliance on a single strategy which - when countered - spectacularly backfired. This is not to say that the legacy of his military prowess was unfounded of course, merely that we can improve upon the reputation he left. The Royal Army will be unstoppable and terrible in its efficiency and size."

SLC_directorate_national_production:0 "The Directorate of National Output"
SLC_directorate_national_production_desc:0 "With the military industrial complex making up such a large amount of the nation’s economy, it has become necessary to establish a government body to oversee production. These industries must be kept to high standards so that their goods remain of qualities high enough for both the military and civilian buyers. Our people deserve nothing less than perfection."

SLC_perma_positive_balance:0 "A Permanent Positive Balance"
SLC_perma_positive_balance_desc:0 "Whilst some states enjoy the monetary freedom that debt spending provides, we cannot be so careless with our finances. We must always be making and exporting more than we spend and import in order to guarantee economic security in the longer term; particularly as we engage in armed conflict to acquire more resources and maintain our export economy."

SLC_reinvest_vital_industries:0 "Reinvesting in Vital Industries"
SLC_reinvest_vital_industries_desc:0 "Though they are far from failing, it is important that we provide some extra funding for our critical industries in order to ensure that they can continue to expand and provide high quality goods for both the military and the civilian sector. New facilities and production methods are not cheap, but we are more than willing to pay at least some of the bill to make modernisation happen."

SLC_desert_bandits:0 "Bandits in the Desert"
SLC_desert_bandits_desc:0 "Though the land is worth precious little, it is important to control all liveable territory south of the Zebhara in order to use the desert as an effective natural border. Above all it is the safety of the kingdom’s economic heartland that must be considered in our conquests and so from time to time we must go out of our way to protect it, even if it is not in our immediate financial interest."

SLC_fleet_resources:0 "Divert Resources to the Fleet"
SLC_fleet_resources_desc:0 "Our naval forces are in a less-than-optimal state. There is potential amongst its commanders, but little means for them to demonstrate their prowess thanks in large part to the Storm King’s insistence on using airships to cross the ocean. Whilst there is much time to make up for, we now have plenty of time and money to spare for the fleet."

SLC_heavy_industry_weapons:0 "Heavy Industry for Heavy Weapons"
SLC_heavy_industry_weapons_desc:0 "Weaponry of all varieties requires mass production in facilities of incredible sizes. It comes as no surprise to the administration that new facilities to meet the demands of the armed forces are required, and so they shall be built. With the purpose of the plants in mind, they shall be constructed somewhat far away from most civilian factories for safety purposes."

SLC_checking_civ_sector:0 "Checking the Civilian Sector"
SLC_checking_civ_sector_desc:0 "Though the traditional civilian sector now makes up a minority share of the home economy, it is nevertheless an important part of our financial structures. We will provide temporary tax breaks and a limited number of grants to encourage smaller local businesses to provide services and goods to their communities."

SLC_more_machine_tools:0 "Proliferation of Machine Tools"
SLC_more_machine_tools_desc:0 "Despite our best efforts, machine tools are still a relatively uncommon sight in our gradually developing industries. Though they are expensive, it is important that we provide the funds and information that will allow corporations to purchase and make proper use of modern equipment. After all, both the armed forces and the general public rely on the military-industrial complex."

SLC_resource_network:0 "The Resource Supply Network"
SLC_resource_network_desc:0 "Our newly constructed railways serve a dual purpose. They are of course of paramount importance for the transportation of goods and materiel across vast distances, but they also have the capacity to transport vast numbers of troops at short notice. With proper training and organisational knowhow, our armies will be able to cross their empire in a matter of days."

SLC_service_propaganda:0 "Intensify Service Propaganda"
SLC_service_propaganda_desc:0 "Propaganda is a fundamental part of any recruitment process, but thus far it has been kept at a relatively minimal level. The armed forces always need more recruits however, and as such Her Majesty has authorised a new budget for recruitment agencies. Though some will find the pervasive military rhetoric frustrating, there’s no denying that this strategy will rapidly bear fruit."

SLC_black_gold:0 "Extracting the Black Gold"
SLC_black_gold_desc:0 "Oil is perhaps the single most valuable resource for any army; much like soldiers fight best on full stomachs, machines fight best with a full tank. To this end it is imperative that we secure and expand oil extraction operations wherever we can; particularly as the Rainband lacks any native wells. Black gold is the lifeblood of our military and we must protect our supply of it at all costs."

SLC_first_defence:0 "The First Line of Defence"
SLC_first_defence_desc:0 "Though we pride ourselves on the extensive tradition of our air force, we would do well not to become complacent in our victories. Our empire is vast and any enemy with a sizable bomber squadron would be more than capable of flying to the Rainband and dropping their ordinance in a surprise attack. We must be prepared for every eventuality and construct defences to match."

SLC_cant_refuse:0 "A Leaf out of Tobuck's Book"
SLC_cant_refuse_desc:0 "The Tobuckian bid for independence was successful primarily because of the gun runners who provided extensive financial backing to the rebel forces. Whilst we have no intention of running such an immoral and dangerous business, we see plenty of opportunities to provide allies and associates with the materiel they so desire; for a price, of course."

SLC_all_important_resource:0 "The All-Important Resource"
SLC_all_important_resource_desc:0 "Steel has become the most important resource to any discerning state, surpassing even oil for how absolutely necessary it is in the production of equipment. It is imperative that we maintain efficient production of steel for the foreseeable future in order to facilitate construction projects and maintain significant stockpiles for wartime production."

SLC_synth_material_procurement:0 "Synthetic Material Procurement"
SLC_synth_material_procurement_desc:0 "It has become clear that what we can take from our Zebrican subjects is simply not enough to sustain our economic model on a reliable basis. To remedy this, Her Majesty has seen fit to invest significant state funds into the study and production of synthetic substances with the end goal of supplementing the currently dominant extraction industries."

SLC_city_for_queen:0 "A City Fit for the Queen"
SLC_city_for_queen_desc:0 "The fortress that the Storm King constructed in our capital was essentially useless even upon its inception and has only caused trouble with city planning ever since. To remedy this, the Storm Queen has planned a careful deconstruction of the walls; replacing them with overhead rail lines and new houses underneath. Her project of rejuvenation is certain to bring new life to the city."

SLC_imported_expertise:0 "Imported Technical Expertise"
SLC_imported_expertise_desc:0 "Though our industrial expertise has become second to none, there are certain technical areas in which foreign intellectuals can still provide us valuable information; Hyenas - for example - have incredible knowledge of all things tunnel, mine and mineral related. It is for this reason that the state will go on a recruitment spree in an attempt to bring aboard foreign experts."

SLC_tobuck_leaf:0 "Contracts They Can't Refuse"
SLC_tobuck_leaf_desc:0 "Every company now knows that a contract to construct mining facilities is perhaps the single most lucrative and reliable government contract. It is for this reason that the state is soon to divvy up a large number of said contracts regarding recently prospected land in order to prevent corporate infighting whilst ensuring a beneficial arrangement for all parties."

SLC_zebrican_crops:0 "Crops From Across Zebrica"
SLC_zebrican_crops_desc:0 "As any yeti well knows, our diet is far from varied. Few crops grow in the frigid south of Zebrica that are hardy enough for year-round cultivation, which has left our plates typically filled by measly numbers and amounts of plants. With our recent economic developments however, this too can be rectified. Food imports will help to provide our children with better meals and diets overall."

SLC_simplify_process:0 "Simplifying the Processes"
SLC_simplify_process_desc:0 "As our industrial capacity grows, so too do the workforce demands of the corporations. Whilst we have thus far been able to provide the required creatures, it has become apparent that there are many dumb labour jobs that now need doing to facilitate factory work. To this end we will make efforts to simplify factory work, allowing for internal company redistribution of their employees."

SLC_workshop_zebrica:0 "The Workshop of Zebrica"
SLC_workshop_zebrica_desc:0 "Though other states may lay claim to such a title in a vain attempt to market their own products, it would be foolish of them to deny our superiority in this department. We have achieved global market control and earned for ourselves wealth beyond measure, to be spent as we please. We reign supreme not through magic or conquest, but through finance and commerce."

SLC_salesyeti_neither:0 "A Salesyeti is Neither Friend Nor Foe"
SLC_salesyeti_neither_desc:0 "Whilst some would have preferred to shed our kind’s status as villains in the eyes and hearts of many, it is undeniable that we have found ourselves a place in the world all the same. Those who fear us make sure we like them so that they can buy our resources or weapons and those that despise us simply turn the other cheek so as to not cause themselves cataclysmic economic damage."

SLC_perfect_detterent:0 "A Perfect Deterrent"
SLC_perfect_detterent_desc:0 "Nuclear weapons are dangerous things, which is precisely what makes them such effective deterrents. The capacity to instantly annihilate enemy formations on a tactical level or obliterate an enemy’s production facilities at a strategic level is an incredible boon. Even beyond that, there is also the additional element of public terror to consider."

SLC_dead_king_dream:0 "The Dream of a Dead King"
SLC_dead_king_dream_desc:0 "The road has been long and hard, yet our kind once more stands atop this continent with nothing less than complete hegemony; both economic and military. The Storm Queen sits atop a throne of defeated enemies and conquered institutions, proudly at the helm of an unconquerable empire that shall eternally reign across Zebrica."



SLC_demonstrator_demands:0 "The Demonstrators' Demands"
SLC_demonstrator_demands_desc:0 "Although the protests rage on, many of their demands are relatively easy to meet. They demand representation, rights and consideration of a wide range of smaller issues that have been simmering quietly beneath the service; a challenging list in full, but only a few demands need immediately to be met in order for the majority of creatures to return home."

SLC_reassure_admin:0 "Reassure the Administration"
SLC_reassure_admin_desc:0 "The ranks of the civil service have been growing steadily since the restoration of the kingdom proper but they are still far from unshakable. The rowdiness of the armed forces on one side and the demands of the zebras on the other has created an air of worry and concern within the bureaucracy, one that we must immediately tend to."

SLC_before_army:0 "Come Before the Army"
SLC_before_army_desc:0 "The army is understandably eager to put down what they see as a treasonous revolt against the rightful successor to the Storm King and their leader. It is absolutely imperative that Her Majesty makes her position clear before some frightened yeti fires the first shot. Now is not the time to fight, nor is it a time to be scared."

SLC_grant_family:0 "Restore the Family Privileges"
SLC_grant_family_desc:0 "Since the end of the civil war, the influence and power of the Uzerasi has been gradually eaten away by various reforms and careful political manoeuvring. Whilst they have played no small part in the western revolt, it is necessary for us to return some of their privileges in order to coax their organisers into cooperation once again."

SLC_commander_amnesty:0 "Grant Amnesty to the Officers"
SLC_commander_amnesty_desc:0 "There are a significant number of officers - both yetis and zebras - who had loyalties to their families first and the kingdom second. Had another civil conflict erupted it is quite likely that they would have fled or even joined the rebels in the west. Under any other circumstance punishments would be issued via court-martial, but now is not the time for such harsh measures."

SLC_coronation:0 "His Coronation"
SLC_coronation_desc:0 "A key demand of Imamu and his family during the negotiations was that there must be a way to check the power of the Storm Queen. To that end, Imamu will be crowned as the King of the Uzerasi as a gesture of goodwill and to formally establish a regulatory diarchy. Although in theory he shall play second fiddle to the Queen, in practice she will never rule without him."

SLC_abandoning_collab:0 "Abandoning Collaboration"
SLC_abandoning_collab_desc:0 "Collaboration in the west was little more than a perfected process of economic and political oppression. Giving the Zwahile just enough to survive is no longer enough, not when we intend to treat them entirely as equals under the supervision of King Imamu. Today is the day that this subtly barbaric practice is finally put to rest."

SLC_reenfranchise_rav:0 "Reenfranchise Ravakh"
SLC_reenfranchise_rav_desc:0 "Since the civil war’s end, Ravakh’s curious political position has become quite well known. His little movement within the armed forces was very much illegal, of course; but it persisted all the same. In an effort to open up the political sphere, a detenté of sorts will be arranged with our resident communist airship pilot."

SLC_ground_cerulean:0 "Ground Cerulean Squadron"
SLC_ground_cerulean_desc:0 "Cerulean Squadron has been a valuable asset in all conflicts that they have supported us in, but they are still mercenaries. The time has come to ground them for good and put their expertise - and our funds - to use on new projects instead of their ramshackle fighters. The knowledge they possess will be far more valuable to the military than their service."

SLC_rebuild_army:0 "Rebuilding the Armed Forces"
SLC_rebuild_army_desc:0 "Although the military is largely functional in its current state, it is hardly a force worthy of the commonwealth and all its creatures. It requires a complete restructuring in order to remove all traces of the military police force that it once was and we must take great care to involve our new friends at all levels of service and command."

SLC_our_infamy_gone:0 "Our Infamy, Gone with the Kingdom"
SLC_our_infamy_gone_desc:0 "Although many still look at individual yetis with fear, the Storm Kingdom is no more. The fear of a true successor to the Storm King is subsiding and the infamy that his reign brought leaves no scar on the commonwealth. It will still take time for creatures to begin trusting us, but at least that trust is not overshadowed by Zebrica’s most vicious conqueror."

SLC_hooves_hearts:0 "Hooves and Hearts"
SLC_hooves_hearts_desc:0 "The hearts of creatures are what we must sway if we truly seek to reconcile with those both within and without our borders. Any madyeti with a gun can get a scared zebra to sit down and shut up, but a kind and pragmatic one is required to make real progress. We are not the monsters who came before us, and we will prove it."

SLC_adapting_old_doctrines:0 "Adapting the Old Doctrines"
SLC_adapting_old_doctrines_desc:0 "The correct amount of force applied in the correct place is no worse a method than appealing to the sensibilities of the creatures we are trying to convince. We must adapt the old methods of policing and resistance suppression to fit a new and more peaceful era, which is to say that we’ll be using the same amount of force; just with a little more care."

SLC_proliferate_services:0 "Proliferate Yeti State Services"
SLC_proliferate_services_desc:0 "Thanks in part to the absolute authority of the yeti monarchy, state services and transport systems have rapidly developed in places where resistance to their establishment would otherwise have slowed them. Although the origins of these services are far from pretty, it would be worthwhile expanding them to facilitate development across the commonwealth."

SLC_mixed_market_eco:0 "The Slowly Growing Welfare System"
SLC_mixed_market_eco_desc:0 "With its roots in a state care system for ex-serviceyetis, provisions for general healthcare experts employed by the state have been gradually expanding across the rainband. Needless to say this system is widely praised by creatures previously unable to easily seek professional medical assistance, we would do well to build upon it for the benefit of all."

SLC_our_better_half:0 "Our Better Half"
SLC_our_better_half_desc:0 "Zebras are capable of a great many things, including but not limited to the capacity for alchemy. Now that we are doing our best to work in harmony with the Zwahile and beyond, the time has come to provide an ample research budget for their experiments. It’s unknown exactly what will come of this research, but King Imamu has promised Her Majesty results."

SLC_modern_levy_concept:0 "Modernising the Levy Concept"
SLC_modern_levy_concept_desc:0 "Although conscription is not necessarily the most important aspect of war, it is undeniable that a steady stream of bodies is not only beneficial but necessary. A network of regional conscription centres run with the bureaucratic knowhow of the Uzerasi will provide such a surplus, albeit to the annoyance of the armed forces."

SLC_retain_yeti_generals:0 "Retain the Yeti General Staff"
SLC_retain_yeti_generals_desc:0 "The yeti style of manoeuvre warfare does not need many more soldiers that we currently have. It is swift and devastating, or else it has failed. To that end the general staff will remain packed with experienced yetis - albeit with some new members in the mix - in an effort to retain the deadly efficiency of the military. The Uzerasi will fuss of course, but war was never their forte."

SLC_support_new_divs:0 "Support for the New Divisions"
SLC_support_new_divs_desc:0 "As support structures are necessary in the construction of any great monument, so too are support companies essential to the function of a professional military. No matter the strategies and tactics employed, improvements to supporting formations must be made in order to maintain a state of effective readiness."

SLC_arushay_council:0 "The Arushay Council Model"
SLC_arushay_council_desc:0 "Although empowering local institutions of law is likely to provide some influential individuals with an easy way out of punishment, the importance of devolved law enforcement cannot be understated. It is paramount that each part of the commonwealth enforces its laws to the standards of the local people in order to guarantee regional stability."

SLC_judicial_directorate:0 "The Grand Judicial Directorate"
SLC_judicial_directorate_desc:0 "Whilst the creation of a court with supreme authority over all others will not be popular amongst the ranks of Uzerasi nobility, it is imperative that we maintain an equal legal standard across the commonwealth. A fair hand - or hoof - in all matters across the nation is required to ensure lasting peace and stability for all creatures within its borders."

SLC_regional_police_forces:0 "Establish Regional Police Forces"
SLC_regional_police_forces_desc:0 "It is impossible to coordinate all police units directly from the Eye of the Storm, not just because of the magnitude of such an operation; but also the geographic limitations of the home isle. To alleviate the practical limitations of our current law enforcement, new organisational bodies will be established across the commonwealth to provide regional policing services."

SLC_eradicate_illiteracy:0 "Systematically Eradicate Illiteracy"
SLC_eradicate_illiteracy_desc:0 "Illiteracy is the second greatest scourge on any society and the state which governs it, behind only poverty. To that end it is of critical importance that we take to each region of the kingdom and systematically uproot whatever is preventing the spread of literacy whilst constructing schools and implementing education reforms where such establishments already exist."

SLC_vindicate_conflicts:0 "Vindicate the Mazwian Conflicts"
SLC_vindicate_conflicts_desc:0 "Before the invasion of the Storm King, the Mazwi Empire fought countless wars with the Uzerasi kingdom with the Zwahile coast switching hooves many times over the years. Their conflict was legendary and many nobles still privately resent the Mazwi - and those in the Great Lakes who served them - for leaving them so vulnerable to a yeti invasion. We can provide the war they seek."

SLC_two_kingdoms:0 "The Knowledge of Two Kingdoms"
SLC_two_kingdoms_desc:0 "Thanks in part to the pressing nature of the civil war and subsequently the focus on rebuilding the Rainband, much knowledge and literature in the possession of the Uzerasi has thus far been ignored. This shall be the case no longer and a new university specialising in the study of shared cultural history between the yeti tribes and Zwahile shall be constructed."

SLC_small_and_small:0 "Small Arms and 'Small' Arms"
SLC_small_and_small_desc:0 "Although our current inventory of weapons is serviceable, it would be a lie to claim that our stocks of small arms and artillery are entirely up to date. On top of this, the commonwealth currently lacks standardised equipment for equines serving in the army; an issue that must be rectified immediately if we desire a reasonable level of combat effectiveness amongst zebra divisions."

SLC_land_knowledge:0 "Our Knowledge of the Land"
SLC_land_knowledge_desc:0 "Yetis have travelled all across the continent, but they do not have the same affinity for the lands upon which they walk as zebras. It is imperative that proper terrain combat training be provided to all members of the military by the most able of zebra officers, even if those officers happen to have strong personal ties to the Uzerasi."

SLC_innate_adaptability:0 "Our Innate Adaptability"
SLC_innate_adaptability_desc:0 "Yetis are amongst a slim minority of creatures that possess dexterous hands and have learned to use them in ways that only unicorns could possibly mimic. We do not rely on telekinesis or wings, nor can we brew enhancing potions to make us ready for combat. We do it all with our hands, and from amagical evolutionary desperation comes unparalleled ingenuity."

SLC_status_hyenia:0 "Address the Status of Hyenia"
SLC_status_hyenia_desc:0 "Hyenia exists in somewhat of a bureaucratic limbo at present, technically beholden to the will of both the Storm Queen and King Imamu. It is high time they were given the right to manage themselves in all civil matters, provided they comply with the founding laws of the diarchy at large of course. They are just as much citizens of the commonwealth as any of our other subjects."

SLC_enshrine_freedom:0 "Enshrine Freedom of Conscience"
SLC_enshrine_freedom_desc:0 "The spiritual beliefs of the commonwealth vary wildly depending on where an individual finds themselves; be it in Hyenia, the Zwahile or the Rainband. We shall sign into effect laws that protect the right of all creatures to practise any faith they please, so long as the faith in question does not infringe upon the basic rights of any other citizen."

SLC_finish_act:0 "An Act of Vengeance"
SLC_finish_act_desc:0 "The zebras of the Great Lakes clamour for someone to blame and most are in agreement that the Mazwi have not yet felt the bitter taste of complete defeat. Although an unconventional solution to the lingering discontent, it may be possible to agitate the Great Lakes and many unsatisfied Uzerasi nobles to seek revenge against their old enemies instead of their new ones."

SLC_recruiting_remnants:0 "Recruiting the Remnants"
SLC_recruiting_remnants_desc:0 "What remains of the Great Laker armies are disorganised bands of soldiers with no military hierarchy to return to and a home that they failed to protect. We may be able to make use of this situation by trying to recruit the battered remnants of a once great army, providing an outlet for their self-loathing and frustration in another chance at service."

SLC_clean_up:0 "Clean Up the Mess"
SLC_clean_up_desc:0 "Although much has been done to rebuild and restore the wealth and history of southern Zebrica, there are some key issues left to be addressed. The Storm Queen is primarily concerned with the defensibility of the commonwealth's borders and King Imamu wishes to bring home the Ovingolanders as a show of good faith. There is much left to be done."

SLC_good_word:0 "The Good Word of Traders"
SLC_good_word_desc:0 "Traders are not known for being the most trustworthy of creatures, but they are very good at spreading news into all the right ears over the right period of time. A free delivery here, some kind words there and eventually the caravanning routes of southern Zebrica will be alive with tales of our good deeds for all to hear."

SLC_saviour_concept:0 "Proliferate the 'Saviour' Concept"
SLC_saviour_concept_desc:0 "The Saviour Concept is inspired by the somewhat popular belief within the Great Lakes that the Storm King’s invasion was divine punishment for the tyranny of the Mazwi. Although the circumstances are different now, playing into this narrative and presenting ourselves as liberators - divine or otherwise - will be very beneficial to Imamu’s ongoing integration efforts."

SLC_service_accomodation:0 "Post-Service Accommodation"
SLC_service_accomodation_desc:0 "Although medical assistance is provided for veterans already, many ex-servicecreatures struggle to find work and subsequently afford housing. We must provide for those that protect the commonwealth, or they will simply leave and become part of a hostile nation’s pool of skilled military professionals. Either that, or they will simply cause a sizable fuss."

SLC_reformalise_army:0 "Reformalise the Royal Army"
SLC_reformalise_army_desc:0 "Having gone through a long period of reorganisation and non-yeti recruitment, the Royal Army is finally ready to be reinstated as the core military branch of the commonwealth. Of course it will now technically also be subordinate to both King Imamu as well as the Storm Queen in equal measure, but the former is still more than happy to delegate military matters to the latter."

SLC_commonwealth_codex:0 "The Commonwealth Codex of Rights"
SLC_commonwealth_codex_desc:0 "The right of assembly, the right to strike against unfavourable or unsafe working conditions and the right to participate in the politics of the nation are just some of the stipulations in the codex. The list of formal and henceforth inalienable rights is truly extensive, and represents a tangible departure from the untouchable absolutism of the Storm King."

SLC_make_friends:0 "Our Warm Corner of a Frigid World"
SLC_make_friends_desc:0 "Although it is preferable for international matters to be solved without the use of arms, we are always ready to defend our homes against those that would see the diarchy fall. The commonwealth represents strength in the face of our worst enemies, our worst nightmares and our worst impulses; and if you are willing to accept the helping hand of a yeti, it will give some of that strength to you."

SLC_roads_rails_love:0 "Roads, Rails and a Little Love"
SLC_roads_rails_love_desc:0 "The Storm Queen wisely recognised the value of public works projects during the reconstruction period and King Imamu has every intent to parrot their successes. Infrastructure and convenience are a surefire way to steal the hearts of a people, which is precisely what the King of the Uzerasi intends to do."

SLC_rebel_releases:0 "Negotiate Rebel Terms"
SLC_rebel_releases_desc:0 "Several high-profile resistance members that we have captured in operations across the Great Lakes are bureaucratic staff who became responsible for organising insurgent operations. Perhaps with the right persuasive tools and the knowledge that many of them simply wish to return home, we can very easily set them free on our own payroll."

SLC_reintegrate_prisoners:0 "Reintegrate the Prisoners of War"
SLC_reintegrate_prisoners_desc:0 "The officers, like many of their soldiers, have become aimless in the wake of the war with the Great Lakes. We have many talented commanders languishing in prison who - though it would be unwise to let them command divisions themselves - could provide valuable insight in strategy and tactics should we recruit them into the general staff."

SLC_food_votes_respect:0 "Food, Franchise and Real Respect"
SLC_food_votes_respect_desc:0 "Much as the Storm Queen tasked storm creatures with delivering rations to struggling villages during the civil war, King Imamu shall now follow suit. Cities that were sieged or became disconnected from supporting farmland will be rebuilt, those without food will be fed and those who have no work will find themselves with a job in a new consumer goods complex."

SLC_military_affairs:0 "The Directorate of Military Affairs"
SLC_military_affairs_desc:0 "Organising and directing the military industrial complex has progressively become more difficult as the variants and amounts of equipment required has slowly grown over the years. To this end Her Majesty has one last directorate up her metaphorical sleeve, the Directorate of Military Affairs; soon to be responsible for the procurement and testing of new equipment."

SLC_disciplined_bureau:0 "A Disciplined Bureaucracy"
SLC_disciplined_bureau_desc:0 "Far from the shaky civil service that once had to be reminded of its place, the bureaucratic machine of the Commonwealth now runs like a finely tuned machine. No amount of paperwork or complexity can stump the inner workings of the Commonwealth. Such is its majesty that the King and Queen themselves have expressed their fondness for this masterpiece."

SLC_con_lentitud_poderosa:0 "Forward with Powerful Slowness"
SLC_con_lentitud_poderosa_desc:0 "Despite the progress we have made thus far, our city infrastructure in the commonwealth's two capitals is lacking. Funding has been allocated to state corporations to expand housing and industry, with the majority of the money heading to Mzizima so that it may catch up to the Eye. From here on we will design and construct all such projects with utmost care, slowly but surely."

SLC_zeebs_and_yetis:0 "Of Zebras and Yetis"
SLC_zeebs_and_yetis_desc:0 "Although the commonwealth contains many creatures of different denominations, the most populous races are yetis and zebras by far. The realisation of King Imamu’s vision is more than just a territorial integration of the Great Lakes, it is a final lasting peace between zebras and yetis; brokered in no small part by him, albeit with some help."

SLC_lockstep_forward:0 "Lockstep into the Future"
SLC_lockstep_forward_desc:0 "Although the Storm Queen and King Imamu have not always seen eye to eye on certain issues, they trust each other in their relevant fields of expertise. They have demonstrated to each other, to their subjects and to the world that the yetis are no longer a cabal of violent beasts. They have proven to be worthy rulers of all the creatures who reside within the borders of the commonwealth."

SLC_formerly_storm:0 "The Storm Formerly Known as Cyan"
SLC_formerly_storm_desc:0 "We knew of a world without memory, without time, observed the use of a language that ignored nouns, a language of impersonal verbs and efficacious epithets. Thus to life came the days and then the years, and something akin to euphoria happened one morning.\n\nIt thundered and rained, in pink and cyan."



SLC_army_collab_and_stratocracy:0 "The Royal Army"
SLC_army_collab_and_stratocracy_desc:0 "A direct organisational successor to the armed forces of the junta, the newly founded Royal Army shall serve as foundation for the kingdom’s renewed military might. Though it contains remnants of His Majesty’s general staff, the Storm Queen has made absolutely certain that the new blood will have their way laying the groundwork for modern strategies and tactics."

SLC_next_gen_inf_weapons:0 "The Next Generation of Infantry Weapons"
SLC_next_gen_inf_weapons_desc:0 "Much of the civil war was fought with outdated weapons that had been hastily removed from ageing stockpiles of old firearms. Whilst they have proven to be far from useless, the military has been expressing a desire to modernise their small arms for many years and we finally have the resources with which to devote ourselves to such a project."

SLC_artillery_upgrades:0 "Much-Needed Battery Upgrades"
SLC_artillery_upgrades_desc:0 "Conventional artillery was not commonly used by His Majesty or the generals of the era, largely because munitions dropped from airships achieved a similar effect. More recently however, the armed forces has become increasingly attached to the artillery concept as tactics utilising indirect fire developed during the civil war become ever-more more prevalent."

SLC_tracks_in_dirt:0 "Tracks in the Dirt"
SLC_tracks_in_dirt_desc:0 "Tanks present a much less significant tactical shift than one might initially assume. Practically speaking they operate in a similar capacity to airships, creating and exploiting breakthroughs primarily against infantry and over relatively open terrain. Simultaneously they are far smaller and better protected targets that move quickly and provide ample fire support for infantry."

SLC_craters_in_sand:0 "Craters in the Sand"
SLC_craters_in_sand_desc:0 "What artillery lacks in style it makes up for in substance. Massed and precise fire from dedicated artillery pieces of various calibres allows for a surprisingly flexible doctrine whilst keeping the economic load relatively light. Though it is quite far removed from the old methods, it is a strategic development worth pursuing."

SLC_restore_air_fleet:0 "Restoring the Air Fleet"
SLC_restore_air_fleet_desc:0 "Though air warfare seems unfamiliar to those that once considered themselves experts, we were the first to be exposed to planes and their power. Though our airships fared poorly, the pilots that survived encounters with them have performed extensive studies in design and doctrine; giving our designers and engineers access to much-needed information."

SLC_armoured_infantry:0 "Evolve the Armoured Infantry Concept"
SLC_armoured_infantry_desc:0 "The storm creatures have worn armour into combat since records began and continue to do so to this day, albeit with modern materials. For most yetis such equipment is simply too heavy to be feasible, but that does not necessarily mean we cannot afford them protection. Armoured transports will not only allow for rapid deployment, but drastically increase the survival chances of the troops within."

SLC_ground_support_technology:0 "Ground Support Technology"
SLC_ground_support_technology_desc:0 "Whilst primitive bombs were sufficient in the days where aircraft travelled at about the same speed as infantry, new heights and speeds demand ground support innovations. Early testing of aircraft-mounted cannons has shown particular promise, although it is clear that the pilots will need extensive training to use such equipment effectively."

SLC_contracts_for_cerulean:0 "Permanent Contracts for Cerulean Squadron"
SLC_contracts_for_cerulean_desc:0 "Cerulean Squadron are a renowned mercenary band that cobbled together their own aircraft from the parts left behind by the few hippogriff planes that were downed during the annihilation of the invasion fleet. Besides the propaganda potential that their formal recruitment offers us, they are also some of the foremost experts on dogfighting techniques and have much to offer our airforce."

SLC_lean_on_natural_advantages:0 "Lean on Our Biology"
SLC_lean_on_natural_advantages_desc:0 "We have historically performed best in wars by leaning on technological developments or biological advantages entirely unique to our kind. It is only with a renewed scientific interest in such fields and an additional allocation of funds that we will once again regain a massive military advantage over our adversaries."

SLC_rolling_thunder:0 "Rolling Thunder"
SLC_rolling_thunder_desc:0 "Though it has taken some time to iron out the problems in both the design and implementation of tanks, we are now at yet another fork in the road. Light tanks are fast and dangerous, medium tanks provide a balanced platform for a variety of tasks and heavy tanks can serve in both an anti-tank and anti-infantry role without risking damage. With innovation comes experimentation."

SLC_airburst_shells:0 "Airburst Shells"
SLC_airburst_shells_desc:0 "High explosive shells are only as effective as their probability of hitting a target, both on the ground and in the air. Timed fuses used in conjunction with ground-level spotters should allow us to fire shells that detonate close to a target in the event of a missed shot, drastically increasing their potential to cause lethal damage."

SLC_full_spectrum_support:0 "Full Spectrum Support"
SLC_full_spectrum_support_desc:0 "Support companies are necessary for the effective operation of any division, regardless of its purpose. Maintenance, fire support, logistics, reconnaissance and many more have a pivotal role both inside and outside of combat. To that end it is essential that we invest heavily in optimising and properly equipped such brigades."

SLC_no_accuracy_mo_damage:0 "Destructive Potential"
SLC_no_accuracy_mo_damage_desc:0 "Rocket artillery - at least by current measure - is significantly less accurate than regular artillery, yet it has a not insignificant effect on enemy morale. Provided that the accuracy can be overcome with a significant increase in the volume of fire, such devices could prove to be the next great leap forward in indirect fire equipment and tactics."

SLC_rugged_logistics:0 "Rugged Logistics"
SLC_rugged_logistics_desc:0 "The desert is not kind to any military-grade equipment; the more complex a mechanism or machine is, the faster it tends to seize up and become inoperable. For the sake of our tank-oriented strategy it is absolutely imperative that we maintain a good supply of vehicles, tools and spare parts so that inevitable malfunctions can be mitigated."

SLC_her_majestys_finest:0 "Her Majesty's Finest"
SLC_her_majestys_finest_desc:0 "The storm creatures were once the tip of His Majesty’s spear, but their size, armour and sheer determination cannot provide a significant advantage against modern weaponry. To retain their importance on the ever-changing battlefield, storm creatures must receive additional training and the technological zenith of our small arms stockpile."

SLC_radio_integration:0 "Radio Integration"
SLC_radio_integration_desc:0 "Whilst developing a radio that can be used by storm creatures and regular yetis alike has proven challenging, it has not been without merit. The development of shorthand Horse code for storm creatures in conjunction with the rapid miniaturisation of radio technology has made the proliferation of the device a certainty."

SLC_rapid_deployment_specialisation:0 "Rapid Deployment Specialisation"
SLC_rapid_deployment_specialisation_desc:0 "Motorisation is an inevitability. Whilst trains excel in long distance transportation of massive amounts of materiel, they lack the ability to operate with any level of flexibility. Trucks and other motor vehicles have already begun to pick up the slack in this regard, transporting equipment from trains to the front in record time and over almost any terrain."

SLC_legion_phoenix:0 "Like an Azure Phoenix"
SLC_legion_phoenix_desc:0 "His Majesty’s legions fell almost as rapidly as they rose, but their legacy lives on. The Royal Army is now feared for its proficiency as the legions once were for their brutality and greed. From the ashes of the civil war arises an azure phoenix of impossible military might; once more unparalleled, never again to fall."



SLC_army_collab_unique:0 "Peacekeeping on the Continent"
SLC_army_collab_unique_desc:0 "Whilst peacekeeping forces are to many simply a rebranding of foreign aid, they nevertheless serve a pivotal role in maintaining internal stability. Not only do they allow us to be entirely open in our foreign military ventures without significant international backlash, but they provide the military with the unique opportunity to test new weaponry without a large-scale conflict."

SLC_alchemical_adaptability:0 "Alchemical Adaptability"
SLC_alchemical_adaptability_desc:0 "Though zebra magic - like all magic - is entirely alien to the vast majority of yetis, that is not to say that it cannot help us. In particular, the products of zebra alchemy have proven to have an effect on yetis; although the extent and usefulness of such effects remains to be proven. Perhaps they will have domestic and military applications, if produced in large enough quantities."

SLC_hyena_expertise:0 "The Expertise of Hyenas"
SLC_hyena_expertise_desc:0 "For all of the kingdom’s victories, His Majesty failed to entirely crush the hyenas for one reason. They know how to operate in harsh desert conditions and we did not, nor do we now. Whilst it may irritate some of the older members of the general staff, it is time we tactically deferred to the hyenas themselves so that they can show us their tricks."

SLC_standardise_recruitment:0 "Standardised Non-Yeti Recruitment"
SLC_standardise_recruitment_desc:0 "The bottom line is that yetis are soon to make up a minority of the kingdom’s core population and we need new recruits. Very few of our zebra and hyena subjects volunteer themselves for the Storm Queen’s army, which means that we will have to work closely with the advisory bodies to establish an agreeable conscription system in the kingdom’s non-yeti territories."



SLC_army_strat_unique:0 "Formalise the Penal Division System"
SLC_army_strat_unique_desc:0 "Penal divisions have been in a state of legal and organisational limbo for several years at this point, but their value is clear. Not only do they allow us to keep prisons empty of dangerous inmates and lower operational costs, but penal divisions have a unique ability to instil terror in those that suffer their wrath. May the ancients take pity on their victims."

SLC_special_research_directorate:0 "Directorate of Special Research Projects"
SLC_special_research_directorate_desc:0 "There is typically a moral boundary that many scientists understandably refuse to cross, but it has become apparent that to truly understand the limits of creatures’ bodies we must cross those boundaries. The DSRP will be a top secret scientific organisation staffed with the most morally unencumbered researchers we can get our hands on, tasked with the most vile of tests."

SLC_tabun_extraction:0 "Tabun Extraction Facilities"
SLC_tabun_extraction_desc:0 "Though its name is relatively unassuming, tabun is a recently discovered nerve agent. Introduction of the substance into artillery divisions en masse may be challenging, but as a precision weapon it will have its uses; particularly against urban and fortified targets. In addition, the effects of exposure will make for a useful - if horrifying - propaganda tool."

SLC_tip_of_spear:0 "The Tip of the Spear"
SLC_tip_of_spear_desc:0 "Despite the kingdom’s troubles, the storm creature formations within the armed forces have remained markedly loyal and incredibly effective. As thanks for their thorough and brutal disposal of the monarchy’s many enemies, they shall be rewarded with the most technologically advanced equipment in the arsenal and trained so thoroughly that no creature will ever best them."



SLC_dreams_of_a_fleet:0 "Dreams of a Fleet"
SLC_dreams_of_a_fleet_desc:0 "Our navy is currently comprised almost entirely of second-rate ships that were either requisitioned during His Majesty's conquests or constructed as part of the invasion fleet some years ago. Needless to say these ships are hopelessly outdated and are not fit for modern naval warfare or even anti-piracy duties. Thus, the Storm Queen has decreed a naval expansion and retrofit."

SLC_cruiser_development:0 "The Flotilla Mainstay"
SLC_cruiser_development_desc:0 "Whilst larger, faster and otherwise more specialised vessels have been designed; cruisers remain the core of our fleet structure. To ignore their importance would be a crime and thus new designs will be needed in order to accomplish a proper modernisation of the navy."

SLC_applying_naval_theory:0 "Applying Naval Theory"
SLC_applying_naval_theory_desc:0 "Though the provisional directorate maintained control over a considerable coastline, the regime did not value shipbuilding investments. Instead, smaller teams of theorists were assembled to discuss naval warfare and the applications of new technologies. Now - finally - these teams have the opportunity to put their theories to the test."

SLC_small_and_simple:0 "Small and Dangerous"
SLC_small_and_simple_desc:0 "Destroyers are an immensely important vessel for a number of roles, ranging from anti-submarine operations to fleet screening and more. What they typically lack in survivability, they make up for in relative manoeuvrability and an arsenal befitting much larger ships. The navy must remain up-to-date in destroyer technology in order to remain tactically adaptable."

SLC_under_the_waves:0 "Under the Waves"
SLC_under_the_waves_desc:0 "Submarines are a rather novel concept to yetis and many find them anxiety-inducing to serve aboard, but neither of these aspects reduce their potential. Silent ship-hunting and convoy disruption may well be the difference-maker in a prolonged conflict and we would be wise to invest in such technologies."

SLC_above_the_surface:0 "Above the Surface"
SLC_above_the_surface_desc:0 "Specialised aircraft designed specifically to target naval vessels of all varieties have existed in concept since the creation of the first war-capable airships. At the time they were impractical as ship weaponry rendered such designs ineffective, but with the advent of plane technology there may well be merit in such designs."

SLC_lofty_ocean_battlements:0 "Lofty Ocean Battlements"
SLC_lofty_ocean_battlements_desc:0 "Battleships are a specialised vessel that take many design principles of a destroyer and do the exact opposite. They are slow, lumbering behemoths with enough firepower to level a small town or an entire enemy formation on their own; making them expensive and very valuable. Despite their drawbacks, the Storm Queen believes that they are well worth the cost."

SLC_airfields_upon_the_foam:0 "Airfields Upon the Foam"
SLC_airfields_upon_the_foam_desc:0 "For many, aircraft carriers are a natural development stemming from our affinity with air power and it’s easy to see why. The capacity to project aerial power over great naval distances is not something to be lightly ignored and the Storm Queen agrees that investing in carrier development is the best way forward for the navy."

SLC_settle_on_naval_doctrine:0 "Settle a Naval Doctrine"
SLC_settle_on_naval_doctrine_desc:0 "Naval doctrine is a contentious subject amongst our theorists. Not only is our naval tradition sorely lacking, but our naval officers are all relatively new recruits and have little experience with which to wholeheartedly support a commitment to any one strategy. With this in mind, it will be necessary to focus our efforts on specialising in a single doctrine in order to maintain organisation in the field."

SLC_the_meeting_of_theatres:0 "The Meeting of Theatres"
SLC_the_meeting_of_theatres_desc:0 "Beach landings are notoriously difficult to pull off even in the best conditions, making them simultaneously one of the best ways to surprise a foe. The Storm Queen understands that neglecting such an strategic boon would be wasteful and has set aside additional funding for the express purpose of developing relevant technologies."

SLC_navy_his_majesty_would_be_proud_of:0 "A Navy His Majesty Would Commend"
SLC_navy_his_majesty_would_be_proud_of_desc:0 "Though we are not a traditionally seafaring people, Her Majesty’s navy is truly a sight to behold. The Storm King may have had ambition, but our fleet and its admirals surpass even his most delusional dreams.\n\nAll hail the Storm Queen, may she bring us victory on the vast blue battlefield!"



SLC_constructing_a_modern_airforce:0 "Constructing a Modern Airforce"
SLC_constructing_a_modern_airforce_desc:0 "In the most frank of terms, our current fleet of aircraft is... disappointing. We were the first to master the skies and have perhaps the most developed pool of theorists the world over, yet we have barely moved on from the King’s disastrous overreliance on airships. The time has come to restore our once-proud air force."

SLC_adaptable_airframes:0 "Versatile Airframes"
SLC_adaptable_airframes_desc:0 "What moderately sized airframes lack in specialisation, they make up for in versatility. They can serve in any role from transportation to close air support if correctly equipped, allowing a single aircraft design to operate as needed with a relatively simple refit process."

SLC_reconquering_the_sky:0 "Reconquering the Sky"
SLC_reconquering_the_sky_desc:0 "Once, the sky was our domain; we - one of the largest sapient species - dominated the air and laid waste to enemy armies from above. That apex of aerial power did not last, but in the time since His Majesty’s defeat our airship manufacturers and military theorists have been coming up with solutions to our strategic shortcomings. It is imperative that we collate and discuss their work."

SLC_agility_and_speed:0 "Agility and Speed"
SLC_agility_and_speed_desc:0 "Light aircraft specialise in speed and agility, making them ideal for gaining and maintaining air superiority over enemy aircraft. Whilst our designs for single-yeti planes are of course larger than those of other, smaller creatures; the engineers assure us that they have made up for this natural shortcoming by using enormous control surfaces to maintain optimal manoeuvrability."

SLC_our_own_aerial_dominance:0 "Our Own Aerial Dominance"
SLC_our_own_aerial_dominance_desc:0 "Our aerial tradition and natural attributes are the most important consideration when designing new and improved aircraft. The Storm Queen has granted an additional research stipend to be distributed amongst projects that focus on the capacity and limitations of our physiology and constitution."

SLC_the_aircraft_arms_race:0 "The Aircraft Arms Race"
SLC_the_aircraft_arms_race_desc:0 "The aircraft arms race is unique in that the tolerances and dimensions of the aircraft dictate what the most appropriate armament will be. Automatic weapons are only as useful as the tensile strengths of the wings or fuselage that they are mounted on. Additional funding will be required in order to ensure the rapid development of new and limit-pushing weaponry."

SLC_destruction_and_terror_bombing:0 "Destruction and Terror Bombing"
SLC_destruction_and_terror_bombing_desc:0 "Strategic destruction and morale bombing are two separate but similar doctrines that both involve the dropping of munitions onto enemy cities. The only difference is that the former specifically targets war infrastructure or enemy formations and the latter does not discriminate between civilian and soldier. Both doctrines require the same thing: More munitions to drop."

SLC_close_support_from_above:0 "Three-Dimensional Close Support"
SLC_close_support_from_above_desc:0 "Close support is usually a term used by the soldiers on the ground, but this special case is an appropriate use. Smaller, faster aircraft equipped with relatively powerful munitions will be able to provide close support on demand for the army; granting a significant tactical advantage. Focusing on this doctrine of munitions deployment is in the best interests of the armed forces."

SLC_descend_from_the_sky:0 "Dedicated Airborne Divisions"
SLC_descend_from_the_sky_desc:0 "Whilst yetis lack the wings that some creatures are lucky enough to have, we are no less capable of flight; or falling in style, at least. The Storm Queen has expressed interest in the creation of dedicated airborne units since the Royal Army and Royal Airforce were founded and now the state has the resources to develop the required technologies."

SLC_storm_up_above:0 "A Storm Up Above"
SLC_storm_up_above_desc:0 "With previous technological developments out of the way, the time has come to finalise our doctrine and return to the skies with a vengeance. Our talented theorists and dedicated pilots want nothing more than to prove the years of rebuilding the airforce worthwhile. Let us show the world that we never truly forfeited the sky!"

SLC_an_airforce_beyond_sk:0 "An Airforce Beyond the Invasion Fleet"
SLC_an_airforce_beyond_sk_desc:0 "Whilst His Majesty’s airships failed to conquer Equestria, he was not wrong to pursue their procurement; merely in his choice of technology. He would drool with glee, were he around to see our renewed glory.\n\nAll hail the Storm Queen, may she bring us victory in the grand skies above!"


SLC_take_control:0 "Assuming Direct Control"
SLC_take_control_desc:0 "With all effective opposition removed and the armed forces willing to accept orders from Ravakh, we are now in position to begin the journey towards communism. To begin this journey in earnest, it is imperative that we eliminate all immediate threats to the regime; first and foremost of which are the Uzerasi and their traitorous leader Imamu."

SLC_total_class_reorganisation:0 "Complete Class Restructuring"
SLC_total_class_reorganisation_desc:0 "Chattel slavery is of little moral difference than economic slavery and both should be abolished as soon as possible. Unfortunately the Rainband contains multitudes and is not nearly as industrialised or developed as Marks proposes a society to be in their writings. As such we must do what we can to rid ourselves of the former and subsequently prepare ourselves to be rid of the latter."

SLC_revolutions_crew:0 "This Revolution's Crew"
SLC_revolutions_crew_desc:0 "To say that we are lacking in intellectual support - and in intellectuals generally - would be to make quite the understatement. There are few who are truly loyal to the cause, but chief amongst that few are the crew of Ravakh’s old airship. Though they will need training to be truly effective in certain roles, they will serve as shining examples of Marksism in state operation."

SLC_anti_storm_banner:0 "Under One Crimson Flag"
SLC_anti_storm_banner_desc:0 "Thanks in no small part to the western rebellion, it has become quite clear to all yetis that cooperation is necessary in order to defend ourselves. Disunity only brings victory to the doorsteps of traitors, and none are truly willing to betray our glorious revolution. Together against our enemies, together against the enemies of Marksism and together beneath one banner!"

SLC_new_army_conglomeration:0 "Branch Conglomeration"
SLC_new_army_conglomeration_desc:0 "In the most blunt of terms, the command structure of the armed forces was gutted by the western rebellion. Certainly a shame, but not entirely to our detriment. We must replace the most reactionary amongst those who remain within the general staff if we wish for our movement to survive. Replacements can be found in the air force, although they too will require training."

SLC_reorienting_nationalisation:0 "Reorient the Nationalisation Drive"
SLC_reorienting_nationalisation_desc:0 "The short lived Storm Queen’s policy of centralisation during the reconstruction was not without merits. A state owned and operated network of farms which provide a stable supply of grain and subsequently food to fuel the industrialisation of the state will be immensely beneficial in the long term; although it will necessitate buying out large amounts of property, or the application of force."

SLC_acceleration_of_capital:0 "Acceleration of Capitalism"
SLC_acceleration_of_capital_desc:0 "Disrupting our current process of industrialisation and economic growth with sweeping change would end poorly for all involved. The last thing our still-fragile nation needs is another economic crisis. In light of this, we will divert state funding to businesses and provide cuts in tax for new enterprises. If we wish to see Marksism, then we must first accelerate into capitalism."

SLC_rapid_politicisation:0 "Rapid Politicisation"
SLC_rapid_politicisation_desc:0 "Although Marks’ manifesto stipulates that it is the emerging working class who will become collectively conscious of their predicament, our movement’s success was not achieved in this way. In fact, the vast majority do not even know what Marksism is. In light of this, it is the army first that will receive ideological training to ensure that the revolution remains protected by its most faithful."

SLC_regulated_republicanisation:0 "Regulated Republicanisation"
SLC_regulated_republicanisation_desc:0 "Whilst it is important to rid ourselves of autocracy and feudalism, it should not be a change that is forced. Real change does not happen at gunpoint, it is a slow process that takes acclimatisation, education and a lot of patience. The armed forces will be given access to the same texts as everyone else so that they may deduce the crimes of our autocrats themselves."

SLC_vertical_compression:0 "Vertical Compression"
SLC_vertical_compression_desc:0 "Although it will add to the messiness of the ongoing reorganisation of the army, it is clear that structural change is required. We shall implement a compression of command chain positions, simplifying the military hierarchy whilst encouraging low ranking officers and new recruits to push for promotions. No doubt this plan will have teething issues, but those can be resolved with time."

SLC_proletkulture:0 "Proletkulture"
SLC_proletkulture_desc:0 "If we wish to appeal to our significant minority of labourers that make up Marks’ described proletariat, it is imperative that they understand their importance. Their number, small but growing, are to inherit the nation. They must be driven visionaries of Marksism and set an example to all who join their ranks in the factories. Their emerging ‘proletkulture’ shall lead us onward!"

SLC_classes_with_red_texts:0 "Agri-Culture"
SLC_classes_with_red_texts_desc:0 "Though Marks’ masterpiece specifically notes the significance of the factory labour proletarian, we are not yet an industrialised state. Our lowliest class is the typical mainland subsistence farmer, those who cannot read and have little to no education. We must reach out to them with all our means in order to ensure they understand their revolutionary duties and their future in labour."

SLC_seek_out_red_patriots:0 "Calling All Patriots"
SLC_seek_out_red_patriots_desc:0 "We are in dire need of recruits and have been since the end of the Storm King’s reign. We cannot afford to be picky in times like these and the armed forces cares not the political leanings of its soldiers, at least not yet anyway. We must fall back on the Rainband's most dedicated, be they old or young, big or small. Let our bravest fight for our cause!"

SLC_our_kin_in_need:0 "Our Kin in Need"
SLC_our_kin_in_need_desc:0 "Poverty is a scourge that must be excised if we wish our fledgling republic a prosperous future. The proletariat cannot become aware of its collective identity on an empty stomach or in a dilapidated home, and so we shall provide for them! Clothes for the cold, food for the hungry and homes for the homeless; a chance to become productive is more than enough!"

SLC_expand_existing_facilities:0 "Expanding Existing Facilities"
SLC_expand_existing_facilities_desc:0 "Intelligent as she admittedly was, Ibyz Icepaw has already made some headway in the construction and operation of modern research facilities. It is our duty to finish and expand these projects as necessary to accommodate our growing research needs both military and civilian. Never again will we be technologically embarrassed like we were at Ain Trotgourait!"

SLC_more_creatures_to_teach:0 "More Creatures to Teach"
SLC_more_creatures_to_teach_desc:0 "The Hyenas have fought with us more than any other creatures that we’ve met in our travels thus far. They are a noble and strong people, but they are equally misguided. They do not yet understand the glories of Marksism that await us and it seems unlikely that they will see things our way without. We must show them the path to progress and walk it alongside them."

SLC_revolutionary_state_laboratories:0 "Revolutionary State Laboratories"
SLC_revolutionary_state_laboratories_desc:0 "Science and innovation is an absolute necessity in any modern state, but it has become quite apparent that our staff is neither extensive nor Marksist enough. They are responsible for creating the technology that future generations will use for years to come, and as such they must take upon themselves the mantle of revolutionaries. Those who refuse it, well..."

SLC_heroism_in_science:0 "Heroism In Science"
SLC_heroism_in_science_desc:0 "We all need heroes to guide us in troubled times and scientists are some of our best and brightest. Even if perhaps there are many who do not yet understand the sheer importance of Marksist doctrine, we can all at least put our faith in the sciences and strive to be as resourceful and diligent as they are! Together we shall stand and unshackle the chains of antiquity and decadence!"

SLC_project_funding_equity_board:0 "Project Funding Equity Board"
SLC_project_funding_equity_board_desc:0 "It is hardly surprising to learn that there is a storied history of certain projects - military ones in particular - receiving special funding privileges from yeti leadership. In a new age of equity and progress, such injustices simply cannot stand. A new regulatory board shall be created with the responsibilities of auditing existing projects and evaluating new projects as fairly as possible."

SLC_our_monolithic_society:0 "Our Monolithic Society"
SLC_our_monolithic_society_desc:0 "Together we have already achieved such greatness, not as a horde of bickering tribes but as a collective society administered by a caring - if paternalistic - state. We have done much and shall do much more as we march onward into the great unknown of history to be. We will follow in the hoofsteps of the Storm King and make our kind rightfully proud once more."

SLC_lending_your_tools:0 "Lend Your Tools!"
SLC_lending_your_tools_desc:0 "Where once we demanded the army go out of its way to help our citizens, we now ask our citizens to help out each other. Lend one another your tools, your expertise and your ears; lend others what you can afford to give away and do not covet your means. To be true Marksists we must not simply do what we can, we must do also what others cannot!"

SLC_force_application_not_projection:0 "Force Application, Power Projection"
SLC_force_application_not_projection_desc:0 "The revolution may - for now at least - be safe from internal threats, but it is by no means safe from external ones. We must make a show of force of an enemy that has vilified us since the days the Storm King. The Great Lakes shall know Marksism soon by its strength and not by the weakness that at first plagued our regime. Long live comrade Ravakh, and long live the fires of our revolution!"

SLC_applications_of_revolution:0 "The Balancing Act"
SLC_applications_of_revolution_desc:0 "The fervour of our multitudinous creatures is not only a benefit but a resource that can be managed, much like the creatures themselves. If properly utilised, we may find effective ways to direct and recuperate this revolutionary zeal that the ancients have bestowed upon us. We must nevertheless be cautious in our efforts so as to overtax the many new followers of Marks."

SLC_rav_propaganda_directive:0 "The Ravakh Propaganda Directive"
SLC_rav_propaganda_directive_desc:0 "Actions speak louder than words when it comes to political movements, but sometimes you need words - big words - to convey certain concepts. After all, Marksism may as well have not existed in the Rainband before Ravakh and there will be many who need to be persuaded of the righteousness and glory of communism and our great revolution."

SLC_clear_skies:0 "Clear Skies"
SLC_clear_skies_desc:0 "With the collapse of the old order and the collective last breaths of those who tried to oppose the unstoppable tide of Marksism, we may once more look to the skies. Despite his love for all things airship, Ravakh is not blind to the realities of modern aerial combat and the rise of the plane; but that doesn’t mean his favoured form of war machine has seen its last battle just yet."

SLC_minutiae_of_zla:0 "Minutiae of the ZLA"
SLC_minutiae_of_zla_desc:0 "The ZLA is now organised and loyal, but it is strategically and tactically impotent thanks to the recent reorganisation of command and previously favoured theorists. There is much to be done and a new general staff to be created, not to mention the coordination of various militia groups and local armies run by figures currently disconnected from the military."

SLC_the_founding:0 "The Founding"
SLC_the_founding_desc:0 "With all immediate threats crushed, Ravakh has proclaimed ‘The Founding’ of his new Marksist state. With the fervour of our people at a historic high, it seems only right to acknowledge his authority and entrench his interpretation of communism as the singular ideology of the government and all of the creatures supporting and operating within it."

SLC_marksist_economics:0 "True Marksist Economics"
SLC_marksist_economics_desc:0 "Marksist economics remain somewhat of an enigma to the current administration. The basic premise - from each according to their ability, to each according to their needs - is simple enough. But putting this concept into practice has proven somewhat challenging and can be interpreted in many ways. There are going to be some long nights in the central committee coming up..."

SLC_establish_zln:0 "Establish the ZLN"
SLC_establish_zln_desc:0 "Perhaps it is fortunate that the Storm Kingdom never really had a formal naval force, because it has made the foundation of the Zebrican Liberation Navy that much stronger. We are of course short on sailors, ships and facilities if we intend to take on Zebrica’s great naval powers, but all these deficiencies can be rectified in time and with a little patience."

SLC_familiar_behemoths:0 "Familiar Airborne Behemoths"
SLC_familiar_behemoths_desc:0 "Now these designs are in sizes we are more familiar with! Airships were always quite limited in carrying weight thanks to the need to carefully balance the lift of the vehicle, an issue which large aircraft seemingly avoid altogether. With this evolution in technology and strategy, we will be able to raze the cities and factories of any foe that believes us weak."

SLC_new_and_adaptable:0 "New and Adaptable Designs"
SLC_new_and_adaptable_desc:0 "Despite our love for traditional forms of aerial transportation, the small two-yeti aeroplane is a unique and promising concept. For what they lose in range and firepower they gain in speed and agility, resulting in frightfully evasive weapons of war. They are no doubt the future of warfare in the skies, even if we’re not quite done with our airships just yet."

SLC_dedicated_at_support:0 "Dedicated Anti-Tank Support"
SLC_dedicated_at_support_desc:0 "In the modern era, concentrated deployments of highly trained infantry are no longer the core breakthrough component of an army. Tanks are beginning to reveal themselves in larger and larger numbers and they demand the attention of the general staff. To remedy this problem on the horizon, dedicated anti-tank equipment will be provided alongside new tactical documents for commanders."

SLC_aa_kill_zones:0 "Anti-Air Kill Zone Coordination"
SLC_aa_kill_zones_desc:0 "Although our air presence is quite significant, there is no doubt that other powers in the world have larger and more dangerous aircraft fleets. In order to multiply the effectiveness of our forces in the air, our troops on the ground must be able to coordinate areas that are to be saturated with anti-air fire; either as a diversionary measure or to create a kill-zone for enemy aircraft."

SLC_riding_desert_waves:0 "Riding the Desert Waves"
SLC_riding_desert_waves_desc:0 "A common complaint amongst the armed forces is that trudging through deserts is a really quite an unpleasant and generally demoralising experience. Up until now we have struggled to create robust designs for vehicles to survive in such conditions, but recent technological advances and a large number of prototypes paint a hopeful picture for a possible mass motorisation of the army."

SLC_fellow_chainbreakers:0 "Fellow Chainbreakers"
SLC_fellow_chainbreakers_desc:0 "The Hayzeb are renowned for their anti-authoritarian and anti-slavery tendencies, which is precisely why they see Ravakh’s regime in a better light than the one which preceded it. They are not welcoming us with open arms of course, but there is nevertheless a chance for the peaceful integration of the rest of the Hayzeb people into our glorious federation proper."

SLC_literacy_through_marks:0 "Mass Literacy Through Marks' Work"
SLC_literacy_through_marks_desc:0 "Literacy is a core component of industrial development and therefore in Marksism as a whole. Fortunately for us, Marks herself has left us with plenty of texts that we can use to teach the current and next generations how to read! What better way to teach the nation and simultaneously welcome our many creatures to the glories of Marksism and progress?"

SLC_steel_stallion_visionary:0 "Steel Stallion was a Visionary"
SLC_steel_stallion_visionary_desc:0 "Marks was primarily a theorist and a relatively young one at that. We would never tarnish her meticulous work, but we have become aware of something that her manifesto did not cover in detail at the time. The fact of the matter is that Steel Stallion was quite right to centralise his authority over the revolution in a period of crisis and indeed it may have saved their revolution."

SLC_marks_no_dictatorship:0 "Marks Wished not for Dictatorship"
SLC_marks_no_dictatorship_desc:0 "Although never explicitly stated in the work, it is quite evident that Marks did not intend for a dictatorship to laud over the proletariat. Violent or not, the revolution is not to be enjoyed and controlled only by a select few in their towers of ivory. Power must be placed in the hands of representatives, even if executive authority is to be maintained for the time being."

SLC_unproductive_elements:0 "The Unproductive Element"
SLC_unproductive_elements_desc:0 "There are many reasons for which a creature may be unable to work and contribute to the revolution through labour. Be it injury, poverty or lack of education, something must be done to reintegrate those who cannot provide for themselves or others in a meaningful way. Those within the government have put forth a number of proposals and we must decide upon one."

SLC_great_red_railway:0 "A Great Red Railway"
SLC_great_red_railway_desc:0 "Thanks to our many years of disunity, the transportation networks available for public use remain somewhat few and far between. We require a large railway network to connect the ends of our great federation and to serve as a basis for all future infrastructure expansions. A project of such scale will likely take a long time but such is the price of real, tangible change."

SLC_common_orphan_responsibility:0 "Common Responsibility for War Orphans"
SLC_common_orphan_responsibility_desc:0 "A unification war followed by a brutal series of cross-continental wars, then the civil war and the western revolt on top of all the prior conflicts has left us with a monumental number of war orphans. This a moral and economic tragedy and one that can only be overcome with monumental effort on the part of adoptive parents and state subsidies for their tireless work."

SLC_universal_fleet_component:0 "A Universal Fleet Component"
SLC_universal_fleet_component_desc:0 "Cruisers are an undeniable component of any fleet, providing the most adaptable platform and the best combination of survivability, speed and reliability. If we wish to create a fleet that can contend with those of the great powers then we must seek first a well-rounded cruiser design and subsequently refine its various production processes."

SLC_nationalising_gulf_ports:0 "Nationalising the Bay Ports"
SLC_nationalising_gulf_ports_desc:0 "Many of the privately owned Uzerasi owned ports in Buckonny Bay and the city of Mzizima were left untouched by Ibyz Icepaw thanks to her collaborationist policies. This restriction is moot for the new regime and the family is no longer in a place to protect their holdings. We will seize their facilities effective immediately and thus ensure that we can produce a steady stream of vessels."

SLC_merc_staff_expertise:0 "Mercenary-Staff Combined Expertise"
SLC_merc_staff_expertise_desc:0 "The general staff are not overly enthused with the idea of working alongside mercenaries, but they nevertheless recognise their skill and unique tactical approach. There will no doubt be arguments and various agonising moments, but the doctrinal adaptations that will emerge from this partnership will be immensely beneficial for the air force and its officers."

SLC_project_wingyeti:0 "Project Wingyeti"
SLC_project_wingyeti_desc:0 "Although the mercenaries have brought their planes with them, those buckets of loose bolts aren’t exactly what the general staff would call ‘reliable or indeed ‘safe’. Project Wingyeti aims to codify and reproduce slightly improved approximations of their aircraft as a temporary stopgap measure for the airforce. They won't be good aircraft, but they’ll be able to fly and shoot."

SLC_full_fire_integration:0 "Full Fire Support Integration"
SLC_full_fire_integration_desc:0 "Fire support is a challenging but necessary force multiplication measure that greatly assists our most numerous military formations, the infantry. It requires precision, operational training and good equipment both for communication and the fire itself. Needless to say that the comprehensive integration of fire support orders and coordination of them will be a great boon to the ZLA."

SLC_tactical_reservist_deployments:0 "Tactical Reservist Redeployments"
SLC_tactical_reservist_deployments_desc:0 "Although our reservist formations are somewhat small in number for the moment, they are nevertheless a valuable strategic asset in times of war. The materiel and training required to coordinate their deployment and redeployment to various areas where they are needed is quite extensive but ultimately necessary. They shall be a sight for sore eyes at the front."

SLC_captains_screaming_batteries:0 "The Commodore's Screaming Batteries"
SLC_captains_screaming_batteries_desc:0 "Thanks in no small part to the antics of one Rok Deepstorm during a period of experimental naval munitions testing, ‘screaming batteries’ has become a popular nickname for rocket artillery amongst the general staff. Despite their failure to take off as a naval weapon, they have shown significant promise in the hands of the army and airforce."

SLC_revolutionary_radio:0 "Revolutionary Radio"
SLC_revolutionary_radio_desc:0 "The radio is here to stay and it turns out that the state can make great use of these devices by broadcasting its own set of stations containing only the news that true Marksists need to hear. Ravakh himself has expressed interest in making the occasional national address on air to those who most wish to hear him speak, even promising to be formal on such occasions!"

SLC_turn_neighle_red:0 "Turning the Neighle Red"
SLC_turn_neighle_red_desc:0 "The Neighle is both strategically and economically essential for the progression of the revolution. Strategically, it provides a route around the Zebhara for transporting soldiers and supplies into the north of Zebrica; economically the river provides an excellent medium through which to transport goods across the federation. We shall all become a little richer and a little safer!"

SLC_ZOCOR:0 "ZOCOR"
SLC_ZOCOR_desc:0 "Although our current institutions are relatively developed, the federation lacks the breadth of intellectuals which would be expected of a state this diverse. ZOCOR - the Zebrican Organisational Committee for Overseeing Research - aims to remedy this ongoing academic failure, bringing together the many walks of the federation with science and technology."

SLC_industrial_militia_permits:0 "Industrial Militia Operating Permits"
SLC_industrial_militia_permits_desc:0 "Although the military is quite capable of defending the nation against most outside threats, the people have earned the right to defend themselves and the revolution. All those who work full time will be permitted to apply for the formalisation of an industrial militia which may operate both as a labour union and as a self-regulating military organisation with obligations to the state."

SLC_expanding_workers_union:0 "The Ever-Expanding Worker's Union"
SLC_expanding_workers_union_desc:0 "The state is the very embodiment of a union, albeit one not of industry but of politics and socioeconomics. Those who participate in its economic structures and consent to be governed can all be said to be members of one great union and so they shall be. We will offer benefits for membership and for assisting the state in its various operations, particularly in the locating of dissidents."

SLC_scourge_of_landlordism:0 "The Scourge of Landlordism"
SLC_scourge_of_landlordism_desc:0 "Landlordism is perhaps the single worst creation of any sapient creature. Those who work the land should be those who own it and as such they should pay no mind to the wretched imbeciles that claim to deserve compensation for its use. We will not bow to assertions of birthright in this modern era, nor should any soul suffer the wrath of a misbegotten reactionary."

SLC_tackling_mistakes:0 "Tackling Past Mistakes"
SLC_tackling_mistakes_desc:0 "Though our air fleet was enormous, we were mistaken in ignoring the significance of fighter aircraft and indeed the importance of naval power. Had we utilised proper naval strategy, we might still have had a chance of surviving first contact with the hippogriffs. To that end it is imperative that we modernise our naval doctrine and implement carrier strategies to the best of our ability."

SLC_circumventing_issues:0 "Circumventing Old Issues"
SLC_circumventing_issues_desc:0 "Whilst we may have been overzealous in largely ignoring fleet composition in the past, we were not mistaken in ignoring the vast majority of ship types. It has since become clear that submarines are the future of naval warfare and that they will allow us to silently sink entire fleets without so much as a shot fired back at us. Submarines shall be to the sea what our airships are to the sky!"

SLC_his_roots_our_pride:0 "His Roots, Our Pride"
SLC_his_roots_our_pride_desc:0 "Ah... Airships, once a symbol of yeti superiority and now one of revolution. Though some may say that our recent modifications are not as effective as we claim them to be, we are yet to encounter an enemy fighter which can take one down. In fact, we haven’t yet observed one escape. Perhaps we should dedicate a number of factories to airship production, just to prove a point."

SLC_fund_H4LB3RD:0 "Fund the H4LB3RD Project"
SLC_fund_H4LB3RD_desc:0 "The H4LB3RD is a yet to be designed hyper-agile fighter aircraft concept that relies heavily on massive control surfaces, powerful engines and large internally mounted guns. Conceptually such an aircraft would be an absolutely dominant machine in air-to-air combat, testing the limits of pilots in ludicrously tight turns that would put even hippogriff aircraft to shame."

SLC_invest_strike_leviathan:0 "Invest in the Y-06SK Strike Leviathan"
SLC_invest_strike_leviathan_desc:0 "The Y-06SK Strike Leviathan is a floated design concept with similar air superiority goals to the H4LB3RD but with a different approach. First and foremost is the implementation of electronics on a significant scale with an miniaturised onboard radar system with variable settings, controlled by a co-pilot. This aircraft would also be larger, but capable of handling a greater payload."

SLC_landcruiser_primacy:0 "Landcruiser Primacy"
SLC_landcruiser_primacy_desc:0 "Heavy tanks are conceptually quite flawed with particular susceptibility to attacks from the air, as noted by theorists in the ZLAF. It has been noted however, that with air superiority the primary risk associated with the deployment of heavy tanks becomes void; allowing them to act on the ground with impunity. It is with confidence in our airforce that heavy tanks will be favoured by the military."

SLC_stretch_and_break:0 "Stretch and Break"
SLC_stretch_and_break_desc:0 "Although perhaps uninventive, medium tanks offer the most reliable multiplication of force with the fewest drawbacks and at an acceptable cost. In the right hands they will be just as devastating as any heavy tank, which is to say nothing of the speed and tactical reactivity these vehicles provide over larger - and importantly slower - armour designs."

SLC_only_ancestors:0 "Only the Ancestors Shall Remain"
SLC_only_ancestors_desc:0 "The reality of most religions is that their doctrines and their associated institutions are fundamentally reactionary and opposed to the materialist theory that Marks bestowed upon us. Only our own ancestor worship is to be excluded from this metric as it has no influential organisations to speak of; but that and only that shall be spared from a general restriction of worship."

SLC_marks_believed:0 "Marks Believed in the Sisters"
SLC_marks_believed_desc:0 "Though it pains us to admit it, there are many godlike beings on this planet; chiefly amongst them are the alicorns whose power was recognised and briefly wielded by the Storm King. We cannot fault those who put their faith in higher powers, nor would it be right to broadly apply the same logic to all faiths. Freedom of conscience shall be the federation’s policy on matters of religion."

SLC_enshrining_internationalism:0 "Enshrining National Self-Determination"
SLC_enshrining_internationalism_desc:0 "Although it is true that the spread of revolution naturally leads the federation to large wars with foreign states and annexation of territory, it must be made clear that we are not imperialist capitalists. To truly earn the favour of defeated nations, we must act as liberators and recognize their rights. This will help pacify territories that have not yet fully embraced communism."

SLC_see_no_borders:0 "We See No Borders"
SLC_see_no_borders_desc:0 "Although we remain vigilant of dissidents attempting to escape the federation, it has become clear that an open border and relatively easy entry for foreigners is very beneficial to the state. Workers and freedom fighters alike are arriving every day with the hopes and dreams of a place to work and another to sleep, both of which we can provide for our comrades in arms!"

SLC_tools_of_deterrence:0 "Tools of Deterence"
SLC_tools_of_deterrence_desc:0 "Although there are some security risks involved with the production and distribution of firearms, thus far the proletariat have proven to be largely trustworthy with these tools. As such the military has been authorised to share instruction manuals and production documents with trusted militia organisations to bolster their potential combat effectiveness."

SLC_fuel_for_fire:0 "Fuel for the Internationalist Fire"
SLC_fuel_for_fire_desc:0 "Much of our growing industrial capacity has thus far been spent on the ZLA, but as our productive capacity grows so too does our standard of living improve. We are slowly but surely becoming a fully modernised state, much to the chagrin of the anti-communist powers that once mocked us. May our industrial might ever make them weep whilst we prosper!"

SLC_carrier_conversions:0 "Carrier Craft Conversions"
SLC_carrier_conversions_desc:0 "Our currently deployed fighter aircraft have proven to be largely unfit for carrier operations. They have been especially troublesome in takeoff and landing procedures, but moreover their shoddy fuel tanks and mediocre weapon mountings have left them in a sorry state. We must study and produce proper carrier aircraft with respect to our currently converted stockpiles."

SLC_supporting_core:0 "Supporting the Core"
SLC_supporting_core_desc:0 "Screening vessels are an integral part of naval composition no matter the core of the fleet in question. They are capable of anti-submarine warfare, anti-aircraft operations or the deployment of torpedoes as required, making them immensely adaptable. It is imperative that we invest in this style of ship and subsequently reinforce our existing fleets with the newer designs."

SLC_smuggled_expertise:0 "Smuggled Seapony Expertise"
SLC_smuggled_expertise_desc:0 "Seaponies are well known for their expertise in the field of aquatic warfare, primarily because they’re the only sapient race which can actually breathe underwater. This being said, they would have much to teach the world were it not for their naturally isolated style of living. We have found however, that there are certain things which might draw their technical experts to us."

SLC_fire_with_fire:0 "Fire and Dust"
SLC_fire_with_fire_desc:0 "Though we did not start fighting in the air with planes, we have nevertheless adapted to them like nobody else. There are improvements to be made here and there even now, but none can earnestly say that we would struggle when it comes to aerial combat. All that’s left now is to grind the pompous Hippogriffian airforce into dust; provided we get the chance, of course."

SLC_revolutionary_force:0 "A Revolutionary Force"
SLC_revolutionary_force_desc:0 "Once upon a time, Ravakh himself was the only Marksist with a rank above lieutenant in the armed forces. Those days are long behind us as now only the most revolutionary can be found there, making up the vast majority of the general staff and the lower ranks. The entire force is made up of talented and loyal creatures who wield the best weapons and operate with great efficacy."

SLC_labour_and_sweat:0 "All Who Labour and Sweat are Equal"
SLC_labour_and_sweat_desc:0 "Quite a simple concept, in truth. All those who labour and sweat are to be equal within the federation, as decreed by Ravakh Cloudcracker and the central committee. This does of course include provisions for those who have already worked and those who are soon to start working; after all, it is those who contribute to a society that have earned the right to their place within it."

SLC_all_zebrican_intellectual_ring:0 "The All-Zebrican Intellectual Ring"
SLC_all_zebrican_intellectual_ring_desc:0 "AZIR is much like ZOCOR in that its duties are primarily administrative; rather than operating as an organisational body for the recruitment of non-yeti talent however, AZIR aims to collate and distribute accumulated scientific data amongst the intellectual community. It is hoped that this will lower the data-related bars of entry for future research, incentivising intellectual cooperation."

SLC_ending_bickering:0 "Ending the Ceaseless Bickering in the North"
SLC_ending_bickering_desc:0 "Northern Zebrica has been a hotbed of political instability and violence ever since the Storm King’s half-baked attempt at taking down the hippogriffs. It is both our moral duty and strategic imperative to go and sort that mess out before it can get any worse, provided the hippogriffs haven’t beaten us to it of course. They too will doubtlessly wish to keep themselves safe, after all."

SLC_unfathomable_industrial_might:0 "Unfathomable Industrial Might"
SLC_unfathomable_industrial_might_desc:0 "Our economic apparatus functions in perfect harmony with the state, pumping out vast amounts of goods and materiel like there’s no tomorrow. Our industrial capacity now would have been absurd to even consider half a decade ago, which is precisely how we are gauging our drastically improved production. A complete victory on both the consumer and propaganda fronts!"

SLC_hurricane_sailors:0 "The Hurricane Sailors"
SLC_hurricane_sailors_desc:0 "So named after the island of Hurricane and the renowned naval bases upon it, the titular hurricane sailors are a small and elite number of marine divisions recruited from the ranks of the sailors in those bases. They are particularly well known amongst the locals for enduring gruelling training during even the worst of storms, which has also gone a long way towards popularising their nickname."

SLC_we_follow_the_king:0 "We Follow in the King's Hoovesteps"
SLC_we_follow_the_king_desc:0 "Though we may claim otherwise in the propaganda, it’s true that many are excited to follow in the hoovesteps of the Storm King and finish the job he started. Our goals are more noble than his of course - and buy quite a significant margin at that - but none would deny the eagerness with which we retrace his steps towards a grand confrontation with the hippogriffs."

SLC_path_of_revolution:0 "The Revolution Carves its Own Path"
SLC_path_of_revolution_desc:0 "Though we travel north as he did, the ZLA is not driven by loot lust and the federation is no mere exploitative horde. We may walk the same deserts and jungles as the Storm King, but that does not make us the same. The revolution carves its own path through Zebrica, finding comrades and not enemies. We walk to victory together and not with arrogance, but humility."

SLC_the_great_enemy:0 "The Great Enemy of All Yetis"
SLC_the_great_enemy_desc:0 "The hippogriffs are perhaps the single greatest enemy that yetikind has ever faced. Only they have bested us in battle and only they are truly a threat to the revolution, both militarily and economically. Perhaps in time we will come to respect one another, but for now we must ensure the safety and stability of the federation in the face of our greatest rivals."

SLC_he_had_it_right:0 "He Had it Right"
SLC_he_had_it_right_desc:0 "The Storm King was correct to assume that air power was the way in which his war with the hippogriffs would be won, but he placed his faith in the wrong technology. To facilitate the deployment of a proper air fleet, we will construct air bases where possible, drastically expanding the deployment range of our aircraft; provided we are in control of viable land of course."

SLC_destined_to_die_divs:0 "The Destined to Die Divisions"
SLC_destined_to_die_divs_desc:0 "Paratroopers are notoriously difficult to coordinate and have struggled to prove one-hundred percent effective during training exercises. Nevertheless, we consider them to be our best chance at hitting the Hippogriffian mainland quickly and effectively; though it should come as no surprise that these troops have earned themselves such a poignant nickname, given the risks involved."

SLC_icewalker_marines:0 "The Icewalker Marine Corps"
SLC_icewalker_marines_desc:0 "Although paratroopers represent a sensical doctrinal adaptation given our preference for air combat, marines and naval landings are by far the more reliable way of getting soldiers from a friendly landmass to a hostile one. Even though there is a high risk of interception at sea, the amount of deployable forces is massively higher which makes marines a preferable alternative."

SLC_airsea_warfare:0 "Air-Sea Warfare Strategies"
SLC_airsea_warfare_desc:0 "Naval bombers are, frankly, a necessity in the modern age. Ships are easiest to damage from above where their armour is weakest and a coordinated strike from the air can do far more damage than another ship under the right circumstances. It is high time that we started building up a stockpile of such aircraft and prepared to deploy them against the hippogriffs."

SLC_operation_capewind:0 "Operation Capewind"
SLC_operation_capewind_desc:0 "Operation Capewind is a battle plan detailing our current knowledge of the Hippogriffian air force and its capabilities as well as how best to exploit its shortcomings. These plans should give us a significant advantage in the air for a short time during the early stages of a potential conflict, but our enemies will soon realise their mistakes and rectify them."

SLC_skipping_beaches:0 "Skipping the Beaches"
SLC_skipping_beaches_desc:0 "To properly utilise paratroopers, we need a steady supply of transport planes. These vehicles are largely defenceless on their own thanks to the amount of internal space reserved to contain soldiers, which means a hefty stockpile pre-conflict will also be necessary. With a little luck and plenty of fighter support, we’re fairly confident that we’ll be able to break our paratroopers through."

SLC_weighing_anchor:0 "Weighing Anchor"
SLC_weighing_anchor_desc:0 ""Taking a closer look at what’s around us, there is some sort of harmony; it is the harmony of overwhelming and collective murder. We - in comparison - only look and sound like badly pronounced, half-finished sentences in a mediocre novel."\n\n- Unknown yeti scholar"

SLC_reaching_shore:0 "Reaching the Shore"
SLC_reaching_shore_desc:0 "Although we have made great strides in naval production, the hippogriffs require special attention if we wish to match their sheer naval might. We have little in the way of naval tradition and even less in the field of shipbuilding experts, but there’s nothing that a little mass mobilisation and propaganda can’t fix. Well, so long as we make sure to put the helping hands in the right places; of course."

SLC_operation_coldhoof:0 "Operation Coldhoof"
SLC_operation_coldhoof_desc:0 "Operation Coldhoof is a battle plan detailing our current knowledge of the hippogriffian navy and its capabilities as well as how best to exploit its shortcomings.

SLC_mercs_make_do:0 "The Mercs Made Do"
SLC_mercs_make_do_desc:0 "Cerulean Squadron - now Crimson Squadron - were well known for their use of cobbled together hippogriffian fighters. Whilst the all-too-familiar heraldry of the machines put off some generals, the machines were nevertheless effective against softer air targets. We can reuse this strategy by refurbishing a number of old or otherwise decrepit fighters and using them for low risk missions."

SLC_news.1.t:0 "The Great Zebrican Summit"
SLC_news.1.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]Today some truly shocking news reached the papers regarding the yetis, the disgraced ex-conquerors of Zebrica.\n\nThe Storm Queen has today announced the GZS - the Great Zebrican Summit - with the intent of repaying damages dealt to the many victims of her predecessor. Though many have refused to attend the summit of a nation which retains what can fairly be called an imperialist mindset, many more have agreed to attend in an effort to normalise relations with a powerful yeti political entity.\n\nIt remains to be seen just how successful the summit will be; but it seems that, at the very least, Zebrica no longer has to fear the rise of another mad yeti monarch."

Most observers seem to be in agreement that this response is entirely too harsh despite the validity of her concerns regarding disgruntled neighbouring states.\n\nThough vague promises have been made, there is no consensus on whether the yetis are to resume their tradition of starting and winning decisive cross-continental wars in the same vein as the current leader's predecessor."

SLC_storm_civil_war.1.t:0 "Out of Retirement..."
SLC_storm_civil_war.1.d:0 "It had been some time since Ibyz Icepaw had last enjoyed a half decent rest. Organising a war effort without the support of a traditional civilian government was no small feat and it had expectedly been exhausting. Soon enough she would once again find herself back in Mzizima coordinating supply chains and doing her best to persuade the Uzerasi to provide more resources that the directorate would use. She had known it would be a stressful, difficult and bloody process; but if that was the price of ensuring the kingdom’s future stability then such means justified the ends.\n\nShe sighed and slumped back a little in a seat that had very obviously not been designed with yetis in mind, grunting with slight displeasure as her arms and legs jutted precariously out. Comfortable as the chair was, it was a reminder that when all was said and done she’d still have to contend with issues like Zwahile-yeti relations; a task that, amongst many others, was particularly unappealing.\n\nFortunately, such matters could wait for now. The zebras were cooperating, the directorate was seen as a stabilising force and she was respected amongst yetis and zebras alike.\n\nShe ran her calloused fingers over the scars on her chin and simply sat; enjoying - to the extent that the undersized chair would let her - this brief moment of silence. It was unlikely that there would be many more of these in her future, but such was the nature of leadership. Hopefully things would calm down at least a little when the civil war was over. The less thought about what might happen if she lost, the better.\n\nJust as the field marshal was beginning to sink into the seat a little, she heard the unmistakable sound of heavy yeti army boots approaching her office.\n\nIbyz sighed, allowing herself to smile just a little as she stood up once more. “You may enter.”"
SLC_storm_civil_war.1.a:0 "...and into the fire."

SLC_storm_civil_war.2.t:0 "The Last Remnant of a Dynasty"
SLC_storm_civil_war.2.d:0 "“My friend, this is... a very steep price for a railway. You do understand just how much you are requesting out of my family’s pockets, yes?" The zebra asked, as politely as he could.\n\nIbyz Icepaw nodded, her expression as difficult to read as ever. “I am well aware, Imamu. I am also aware that such a price would be far too high for any other Zwahile family. This sum is for the railway system as well as the engines and cars that will run along it.”\n\nThe zebra winced as he took another look at the immense price tag. Imamu understood the necessity of cooperating with the field marshal if his family and influence was to survive the civil war; unfortunately, that occasionally meant that he would be faced with a request like this. It was a price he could pay, but his family would not be happy to learn that he had agreed to pay it. On the other hoof, if Icepaw herself was making such a massive request then it probably meant that it was a project he should support.\n\nHe set the paper down on the table between them with a contemplative frown on his face, “I assume you also know that my peers will not be best pleased to learn that I have accepted such a... ‘challenging’ contract, shall we say?”\n\n“That was my understanding, yes.” The yeti acknowledged, before raising a finger to continue. “I plan to repurpose it into a largely civilian railway after the civil war. You may consider it an investment, if that makes the deal easier to accept.”\n\nHe held a hoof to his snout for a moment, before picking up a pen and begrudgingly signing off on the construction project. “I do sometimes wonder if deciding to work with you was a poor choice, Ibyz.”\n\n“The alternative would have been far worse for both of us, my friend.” She returned with a subtle smile, inspecting the paper for a brief moment."
SLC_storm_civil_war.2.a:0 "Imamu couldn't tell if it was a threat or an admittence of his influence."

SLC_storm_civil_war.3.t:0 "A Quiet Night"
SLC_storm_civil_war.3.d:0 "The sound of exasperated grunts filled the cool night air as two yetis drove their shovels into the dirt over and over. It wasn’t an easy job and they were both eager to get it done, but it was at least a pleasant reprieve from frontline combat.\n\nIt would have been a slightly more enjoyable experience if not for the fact that one of the two yetis was a storm creature. That wasn’t to say that storm creatures were not appreciated amongst yetis of course, quite the opposite was true, but it was very difficult to make conversation with one. They weren’t much for talking.\n\n“Do you know what we’re looking for? Seems unlikely that they’d just put loose weapons in the ground, so I’d guess crates of some kind.” The yeti asked, finishing his sentence with another loud grunt as he shifted a full shovel to the side.\n\nThe storm creature looked up and stared at him for a second or two, its bright cyan eyes piercing the darkness of the night with only occasional blinks. Without a word it threw aside its own oversized shovel and reached into the hole they had been digging, then proceeded to grab hold of something before wrenching it right out of the ground. After a few moments, it set the object in front of the yeti with a grunt and tapped it.\n\nA sealed wooden crate.\n\nReeling from the suddenness of the gesture and the demonstration of the creature’s raw strength, the yeti took a good look at the box with a slow nod. “I... I see.”\n\nWith that it grunted and returned to its work, hunched over the hole and simply moving the dirt with its hands now that they’d found the exact location of their prize. Eventually the yeti joined in once more, having resolved to not attempt small talk a second time."
SLC_storm_civil_war.3.a:0 "No wonder they're such good soldiers."

SLC_storm_civil_war.4.t:0 "Hooves and Hands"
SLC_storm_civil_war.4.d:0 "Each of the creatures stood at attention as Ibyz Icepaw reviewed their files, taking her time with each of the three documents so as to be absolutely certain of her choice. Before her were three of the most talented commanders that were to be promoted to officer positions. Two yetis and a zebra, each hardened by battle and each ready to serve the directorate to their full capacity.\n\nRising from her desk, she slowly walked in front of the closest yeti. “Savuk Cloudburst. I have been informed that you have a history of correcting the mistakes of your commanding officers. Is this true?”\n\n“Yes ma’am.” He replied simply.\n\nHer eyes settled calmly on his, “Am I making a mistake in promoting you?”\n\nThe much younger yeti allowed himself to return the stare for just a moment, “No ma’am. I did not enlist to fear my superiors, rather to learn from them and do my duty to the kingdom.”\n\nShe nodded and continued to the zebra that was almost hidden between the other candidates. “Jahi. You are a member of the Uzerasi family, yes?”\n\nThe zebra did not so much as blink, even as Icepaw towered over him. “Yes ma’am.”\n\n“And you earnestly wish to support my government?” She asked, monotonously probing.\n\n“Yes ma’am,” He began, “I shall serve you if you continue to serve my people. It is my duty as a warrior to fight for those that would fight for me.”\n\nOnce again the field marshal nodded and took a few steps, this time to face the last of the promotees. “Gaz Boltrider. It has been brought to my attention that you are - in the words of a subordinate - a ‘brilliant yet merciless leader’. Do you intend to treat all with the same disdain, or is this behaviour selective?”\n\nFor a moment she stayed entirely silent, considering her words carefully. “I lack mercy for those that would see an inept monarch on the throne. I lack mercy for traitors and for those that would prefer anarchy over stability and accord. In this I am selective, ma’am.”"
SLC_storm_civil_war.4.a:0 ""Mmm, very well. Congratulations to all three of you on your promotions.""

SLC_storm_civil_war.5.t:0 "Can't Spell Firearm..."
SLC_storm_civil_war.5.d:0 "“I’m... not sure about this.” Imamu gave out as he reviewed another project file, “You know that I don’t enjoy you using my family as contractors, even less so when the work you ask of us is largely military in nature.”\n\nIbyz Icepaw towered over the other side of the table, giving many of the papers she’d just placed upon it a once-over despite having written them herself. She expected that response and made no immediate reaction, expression cold as ever.\n\nAfter another few moments of agonising silence, she made finally to speak. “Each project will provide jobs and together they will eventually create a foundation of skilled labourers from which we may industrialise the Zwahile. Though the goods they produce may be for the front, each plant has the space and infrastructure to support a change in output at a later date.”\n\nShe hadn’t looked up from her musings once, even though Imamu had turned to face her as soon as the hulking officer had started speaking. He sighed, knowing that what she said was true but equally under no illusion that those factories would ever feel the need to stop producing weapons so long as they remained profitable; which they likely would.\n\nThe zebra tapped his desk with a hoof as his yeti friend finally turned to look him in the eyes, maintaining perfect posture as she did. “You don’t have to lie to me Ibyz, we both know that as long as you need weapons these factories will keep making them. You’re not looking to stop procuring materiel in the near future, are you?”\n\n“No, I am not.” She replied simply, studying his relaxed demeanour. “My apologies.”\n\nAfter a little more silence and a slight smile, Imamu sat up and shut the folder in front of him. “I suppose I should get going with these then, shouldn’t I? Economic development waits for no mare.”"
SLC_storm_civil_war.5.a:0 "...without some industrial fire."

SLC_storm_civil_war.6.t:0 "Correctional Division 343"
SLC_storm_civil_war.6.d:0 ""A poor bunch of recruits if I ever saw one," the yeti mused aloud as he came to a halt before them, the massive paws hidden behind his back. Freezing cold eyes regarded each zebra in turn, studying them. "I guess I’ll have to make do though," he finally sighed.\n\nZehlani tried not to look at him. The zebra was in fact too busy keeping her own legs from shaking. She shot a stealthy glance to the side, spotting quite easily the anxious look on most zebras present on the field. Not that she could blame them really. Zehlani had never held a rifle in her hooves before, and she suspected the same to be true for the others as well. War had come to Zwahile many times, and she and her family had been able to steer clear of it through sheer luck. But now? Was the Directorate going to throw them all as disposable meatshields in front of the yetis? Accepting that offer had seemed a better alternative than rotting in a forgotten cell, but she was now starting to have her doubts.\n\n"I’m Captain Thundershock, and from this point on I’ll be the one supervising your training over the following weeks." His powerful voice boomed across the training ground. "Each of you has been given the chance to redeem yourself in the eyes of the Directorate through military service. The fact that you have been convicts in the past is inconsequential to me; by the time the training is complete, I expect you to perform, fight, and win like a proper military unit. The Directorate has no use of dead bodies, and neither have I; so no, none of you will be ordered to charge the enemy with nothing but a sharp stick. From now on, you are soldiers under Commander Ibyz Icepaw, and you’ll achieve your freedom through military service." He reached down to pick up a bolt-action rifle from a nearby crate, checking the weapon with seasoned proficiency.\n\n"Now, let us begin from the basics.""
SLC_storm_civil_war.6.a:0 "They still weren't expecting to survive."

SLC_storm_civil_war.7.t:0 "Sweat in the Air"
SLC_storm_civil_war.7.d:0 ""I would prefer if you could avoid resorting to physical punishment for the time being. After all, my workers cannot meet the Directorate’s quotas when they have broken limbs," Zanif said. The yeti overseer by his side grumbled something under his breath too faint to be properly discerned. He tightened the grip on the baton held in his meaty paws. The two of them were walking on one of the many gangways hanging over the factory’s floor, granting them a commanding view of the dozens of zebra workers labouring below. The clattering and clanking of tools filled the air.\n\n"I honestly don’t see the reason for it," the yeti finally commented sourly. "They are slaves, so they’ve got to be kept in line. They may not have chains on them anymore but that’s what they are. Half of them don’t even understand the machines they’re using. You release your grip on them for just a moment and then-"\n\n"Yes, I know. But believe me, there is no need for such methods. The workers here receive food for their service, so their families are not at risk of starving, and the Directorate gets weapons. I see it as a purely beneficial arrangement," Zanif explained. The yeti overseer let out a scoff before falling silent. Any further discussion was interrupted by a scream renting through the air. Zanif looked down from the gangway, blood draining from his face as he saw one of his workers contorting on the ground, one of her forelegs turned into a bloody pulp.\n\nThe yeti sighed and grimaced by his side. "Right. I’ll send someone to go get a medical team. Now, if you'll excuse me boss, I’ve got bleeding to stop. She wont meet the Directorate’s quotas otherwise, right?""
SLC_storm_civil_war.7.a:0 "Blood on the floor."

SLC_storm_civil_war.8.t:0 "Bright Sparks"
SLC_storm_civil_war.8.d:0 ""Well, I reckon this is the last one," the yeti said. He lifted the crate effortlessly, balancing it on his right shoulder. He chuckled softy under his breath. "You’d think the troops would be more careful and leave nothing of their old stuff behind. None of the foals got hurt in the meantime, right?"\n\nFrom behind the teacher’s desk, Zajuma looked up from her papers. She flashed him a genuine smile. "Oh, not at all, don’t worry. If anything, they seem to find the idea of their school being a former military barrack rather exciting." She shook her head. "I can’t really share their enthusiasm given the condition of the structure. Or the lack of actual teaching equipment for that matter."\n\n"That bad, huh?" the yeti asked, to which Zajuma simply shrugged.\n\n"Well, it’s not actually all bad. Before this, I had to make do with whatever the village could provide, which was not a lot. I had to do many of my lessons in the open, with all the problems that entails once winter settles in. Actually getting paid is a nice bonus, and the foals like it here too. It is a good start."\n\nThe yeti grunted something in assent under his breath before taking his leave, carrying the last of the boxes back to the truck outside. Zajuma sighed in relief once he was out of view; they had been lucky that those boxes had contained only old and dusty documents. To think she had lost sight of those two fillies for barely five seconds. The zebra shook her head and went back to work. That was, until a creeping concern crawled its way to the front of her mind."
SLC_storm_civil_war.8.a:0 "We double checked that the armoury was empty, right?"

SLC_storm_civil_war.9.t:0 "Bread and Behemoths"
SLC_storm_civil_war.9.d:0 "The creaking of wheels filled the air as the Storm creatures pushed the leaden carts past the village’s gates and into the main square. Zusian spotted them from the window, just as his dad shouted for his sister to get back inside and the street emptied before the marching yetis. They towered over the zebras and carried massive weapons by their side. Some were big enough to easily loom over the smaller huts.\n\nZusian dashed out of view with a yelp as one passed right beside the window. If they noticed him, the Storm creatures didn’t react; the only sound coming from them was the labouring breath behind their battle masks. Not that they really needed to communicate; Zusian had seen them when they had come before, bringing empty carts with them to carry away part of their harvest. Always in silence. Creatures that big didn’t need words to be intimidating. Despite himself, Zusian peeked through the window once more. Had the Storm creatures come to take more from them? It wasn’t unheard of. His mother used to tell him and his sister tales about it.\n\nSo caught up he was in his own thoughts, Zusian almost missed the Storm creatures coming to a synchronized halt in the village square. They pulled back the sheets covering the carts, revealing the piles of bread and green vegetables beneath. A soft groan escaped Zusian’s stomach but the zebra failed to notice it, his eyes still following the towering creatures as they simply marched out of the village, carts waiting behind. They had not spoken a single word the entire time.\n\nThe uneasy silence lingered over the village for a few more minutes, zebras spying the carts from behind windows and at a distance, almost fearful to approach them. That however quickly ended as soon as Zusian’s sister and a couple of other foals rushed ahead and snatched away a loaf of bread from the cart, much to their parents’ annoyance."
SLC_storm_civil_war.9.a:0 "Maybe the big ones aren't so bad."

SLC_storm_civil_war.10.t:0 "The Epicentre"
SLC_storm_civil_war.10.d:0 "The thundering sound of hoofsteps echoed throughout the ancient corridors as Icepaw made her way deeper inside the Eye of the Storm’s palace, her security detail of Storm creatures marching behind, weapons at the ready. It was strange for her to finally return there after all that time. Icepaw would have never considered herself a sentimental yeti, yet her mind couldn’t help but dig up past memories, of her loyally and skillfully serving the Storm King; even when the first cracks in his façade of invincibility had appeared. She had visited the Eye before, always for official business, back when the Storm King began his great campaign of conquests across Zebrica. Destiny had brought her to the Eye once more, but as a restorer of order in a land ravaged by civil war.\n\nIcepaw paused for a moment, a chilly breeze blowing past her from one of the windows, the wind whistling softly through the cracked and broken glass panes. It did somewhat pain her to notice the damage done to the fortress during the fighting. The garrison had fought ferociously to defend the Eye, even when the battle had clearly turned against them, forcing Icepaw’s forces to root them out step by step. Her officers on the ground had not dared bringing out their heavier guns to break the enemy entrenched positions for fear of damaging the ancient capital. Icepaw had personally overturned that order once resistance had stiffened. Still, she was glad to find the Eye’s palace still standing, more or less. Looking through the window and outside, Icepaw noticed one of the main bastions, cracked open by demolition charges during the fighting.\n\n"Restoring the palace is going to be... costly." the yeti noted with a quiet sigh. Though it wasn't long before the beginnings of a smile made an appearance on her face. Down in the courtyard below, her Storm creatures were lowering the last of the garrison’s flags, soon to be replaced with her own colours."
SLC_storm_civil_war.10.a:0 "The fortress did not protect them."



SLC_post_scw.1.t:0 "A Victory for Pragmatism"
SLC_post_scw.1.d:0 "In a dugout just outside the confines of the Eye of the Storm, Ibyz Icepaw was carefully composing a short speech. It would not be the best of speeches, but it would be something to say to the public once the civil war was finally over. It was already effectively over at this moment, with her forces mopping up the last of the other factions as her pencil scratched some final notes down onto the paper. She was just waiting for someone to crouch under the doorframe and tell her that it was finally over.\n\nSoon enough, that someone came; not an officer, but a regular radio operator. “Ma’am. Permission to report.”\n\n“Granted.” Came the response, accompanied by the soft ‘thunk’ of a pen being set down.\n\nThe soldier was carrying a torn scroll of paper covered in horse code scrawls and tacked-on notes, looking to the bottom of the half-curled sheet and staying silent for a moment or two. “It’s over ma’am. All targets neutralised, all objectives met; officers in cuffs or caskets.”\n\nOverlooking the understandable use of slang given the circumstances, Ibyz simply sat staring at the opposite wall for a little while before speaking. “Thank you. Inform my subordinates to execute our pre-planned reorganisation protocols. I... I will be here for a few hours, if I am needed. Dismissed.”\n\n“Congratulations,” The yeti gave out as he left, before stopping at the door for just a moment. “Your majesty.”\n\nIf she had remembered to ask his name, the new Storm Queen would probably have given the young yeti a slap on the wrist for that. Unfortunately - or perhaps fortunately - Ibyz almost immediately collapsed into a deep sleep as soon as he’d left the dugout, resting soundly on top of her exhausted notes."
SLC_post_scw.1.a:0 "A short, but well-earned rest."

SLC_post_scw.2.t:0 "Don't Fear the Reaper"
SLC_post_scw.2.d:0 "Thanks in large part to the Storm King being unable to foresee his own demise, one of the many things he had forgotten to formalise were the coronation procedures. He built a palace from the ground up, ordered the forging of the Horned Crown and held a grandiose ceremony for the occasion. Ibyz had no intention of openly discrediting what he had built, yet equally saw no need to repeat the first stage of his method.\n\nSo it was that Ibyz Icepaw found herself sitting on his late majesty’s throne, within his late majesty’s palace; sitting before a near-perfect replica of the lost Horned Crown upon a pedestal. When the time came she stood and the congregated creatures kneeled at her hooves, waiting as she approached the podium and took the new crown jewel in just one of her powerful hands.\n\nIn her calloused and scarred digits, the beautiful metalwork and jewellery was as delicate as could be. In her eyes, it was little more than a trinket with only as much meaning as this ceremony gave it. She wouldn’t be wearing it around like the Storm King used to.\n\nStanding in front of the assembled crowd of generals, citizens, industrialists and - perhaps most importantly - Imamu; she placed the crown upon her own head and drew an enormous sword from its scabbard on her hip. Her eyes were drawn to the head of the Uzerasi family kowtowed before her as she grabbed the edge of her blade and slammed its hilt into the floor with an incredible ‘clang’.\n\nAll rose from their deep bows as blood from the Storm Queen’s hands trickled down her weapon. Chants of ‘Hail!’ rang out around her as she repainted the red marks on her cheeks in her own crimson gore, thinking most about a zebra and the speech she was about to give."
SLC_post_scw.2.a:0 "Welcome her with open arms."

SLC_post_scw.3.t:0 "The Fruits of Their Labour"
SLC_post_scw.3.d:0 "“Don’t you worry, sweetie; I’ll be back again soon. The Storm Queen will take care of us all, I’m sure.” The mare gave out, nuzzling her filly with a little chuckle.\n\nHer husband managed a tired smile and scooped their foal onto his back, sauntering along the train platform beside his soldier bride. They had agreed to this arrangement a little more than a year ago now, combining the pay of a farmer and the work benefits of an army career in an effort to make their way into a better life for the little one. Wise as the choice may have been, it was gut-wrenching to see just how much her filly had grown over the year that she’d been serving under Ibyz Icepaw.\n\n“Next time you see her she’ll be staying with us for the long haul,” He added with as much cheer as he could muster, “And maybe we’ll be able to move someplace nicer.”\n\n“Maybe so.” She responded, silently hoping that the kingdom wouldn’t be thrust into yet another war in the meantime.\n\nAs the little zebra family trotted to the car her military ticket was for, the couple stayed huddled up close; savouring their final moments together for the near future. A year apart was never going to be easy, but she’d managed one already; another during peacetime wouldn’t be so bad. Well, apart from the knowledge of whatever her husband was likely doing with their farming equipment. No doubt she’d have to fix it all when she finally came home for good."
SLC_post_scw.3.a:0 ""Just you wait, both of you.""

SLC_post_scw.4.t:0 "Foresight"
SLC_post_scw.4.d:0 "“Ibyz, please; you must at least see that this is dangerous!” Imamu cried, hoof firmly planted upon the table that the pair were currently sharing.\n\nShe cocked her head ever-so-slightly before responding, “Politically, yes. Militarily, Doubtful. I am well aware of the ramifications this action will have for my reputation, but I cannot sit idly by as yetis go without representative leadership.”\n\n“The Storm King believed that the Hyenians would be easily dealt with too,” The zebra paused for a moment, collecting himself. “Your majesty.”\n\nAt that statement, Ibyz Icepaw took a step back for a moment and her stony expression merged briefly with one of contemplation. She was well-versed in all manner of military strategies despite her age and was confident that the hyenas could be swiftly dealt with, but perhaps her friend had a point there. Even so, she needed to try.\n\n“A fair parallel to make,” The Storm Queen acceded with an unusual frown, “But I must do my utmost to unite my kind nonetheless. Would you not do the same in my position?”\n\nImamu winced a little at the question but nodded, “I would attempt diplomacy first, but yes.”\n\n“Do you think the Hyenians would give up that territory so easily?” Ibyz raised one of her partly greyed yet still bushy eyebrows ever-so-slightly.\n\nThe zebra slowly sat back down on his chair with a resounding sigh, “No, I don’t.”\n\nAt that the Storm Queen simply nodded, having led her friend to the same conclusion that she had made of her own accord. It was not a pleasant set of logical steps to take, but such was the reality of the situation; whether they liked it or not."
SLC_post_scw.4.a:0 "A necessary evil, but an evil nonetheless."

SLC_post_scw.5.t:0 "Something Gives"
SLC_post_scw.5.d:0 "Fowsio was finally going to do it. She was going down to that new factory and get a job no matter what her father said, indeed she was going to do it specifically to spite that old broken record. He suspected that intent of course, so by the time she approached the door dressed in her most replaceable set of clothes she was ready for an argument. It was always the same with Tahiil come dawn or dusk.\n\n“No. No no no. I forbid you from working there and you know why.” He began from beside the front door to the house, “I didn’t lose my eye and the feeling in my claws just for you to go and start working alongside the creatures that took them. You will not associate with scum, nor should anyone else.”\n\nThe old hyena gestured vaguely at the patch over his eye and tapped one of his hindlegs frustratedly against the ageing floorboards of the house. Frankly, Fowsio had heard quite enough of this already. It was one thing to have been hurt, it was another to go out of your way to avoid being helped; even if that help came in a less than ideal form.\n\nThe far younger hyena grunted in displeasure and went to open the door, “So what, we’re going to live here waiting until either you or the floorboards give out? These yetis are just normal creatures like me, they have armed guards sure but only because they know that bitter old people like you live around here! I’m tired of eating less than two meals a day and I’m tired of living in squalor just because you’re keeping both me and yourself out of the only place around here that’s offering jobs!”\n\nTahiil grabbed her wrist in his closest paw with a desperate look in his eyes, “Don’t make my sacrifices for nothing.”\n\nShe snarled and went forcefully for the door anyway, “They were for nothing when you lost the war dad! The least you could do is let me try to dig us out of the hole you buried us both in!”"

SLC_post_scw.6.d:0 "The line into the recruitment office sprawled out far into the street, far enough to surprise the kind of Hyenas that would scoff at such a sight. Many did, but ultimately there was nothing they could do. Even if there hadn’t been armed yeti guards to stop altercations from escalating, everyone in the town had considered coming down here at some point. How could they not have? The benefits offered even to the lowliest of soldiers were greater than those that any of the local businesses could afford, the few of them that there were left.\n\nXadiid shuffled her paws and stuck her snout out to the side of the queue, catching the eye of the yeti standing by the doorway to the building that she was about to enter. A tired and grumpy glance from the creature was enough to elicit a small yelp from the canine. Very few of them had been prepared for just how intimidating the white-furred beasts were up close and storm creatures were even worse. It was bad when you could tell the towering apes were thinking about beating you to a pulp, yet somehow the pinprick cyan eyes of those masked monsters scared her all the more for playing with their fear of the unknown. You could never tell what they were thinking, you would get to watch them do as they were asked in whatever they deemed most efficient.\n\n“Next!” Bellowed one of the officers from inside.\n\nAs the line crawled forward another space, Xadiid found herself face-to-face with the yeti she’d just poorly snuck a glance at. To her surprise, the creature was grinning.\n\n“You look like you’ve seen a spirit in a shrine,” He gave out nonchalantly, “Don’t worry, we don’t bite most of the time. Looking at your clothes I reckon you’d be better off with us even if we did.”\n\nThough she resented the assumption, the soldier wasn’t wrong. “I... don’t have much in the way of choice.”\n\n“Sorry about that. You’re far from the only one who’s life we’ve turned upside down.” He gave out somewhat mournfully, gesturing to the rest of the queue with the butt of his massive rifle.\n\nThe apology landed on deaf ears and drew glares from some of the other hyenas in the line, though none of them acted on their latent anger. Xadiid could only sigh and look down at her paws dejectedly, prompting the yeti to get her attention again.\n\n“Hey, it’s not so bad. The food’s half decent, you get to travel and there are health benefits to look forward to after service. This time next year you could be standing where I am right now, paid well and looking to leave and settle down with a lot of your costs taken care of.” He added with an uncomfortably toothy smile."

By all trustworthy accounts he was quite the guerilla and - perhaps more importantly - the adopted son of Fahamka, their spiritual leader.\n\nAs soon as the yeti and zebra had sat down in front of him almost in unison, Masaska’s interest was piqued and he leaned over the metal table between them. “Imamu and Ibyz Icepaw. Who’s neck did you wring out in order to find me?”\n\nThe head of the Uzerasi family was slightly put off by his casual posture, which prompted something between a smile and a snarl from the monarch in the room as she made to speak. “Why did you come willingly despite our numerous attempts to get rid of you?”\n\n“Because you hold the future of my kind in an iron fist,” He explained simply, scrunching his snout slightly as the Storm Queen ignored his question. “And because I want to apologise for handling your soldiers in the same way you tried to handle me.”\n\nImamu cleared his throat and quickly interjected, “So you wish to help us?”\n\n“No, I do not.” The hyena answered quickly, turning now to the zebra with an expression of stark emotionlessness. “But I would prefer to help and earn a place for my kind with you than die fighting you alongside them.”\n\n“Then the arrangement will be as follows: You cease all efforts against the state effective immediately and do what you can to ease the integration of Hyenia. In return your kind will be afforded freedom of conscience and economic restitution for the damages caused by the war and to begin the integration of infrastructure.” Ibyz explained calmly, keeping her eyes intently trained on the assassin before her.\n\nMasaska pointedly raised a digit on one of his forepaws, “I must also ask that I be able to request an audience at your convenience, Your Majesty.”\n\nAt that, Imamu turned to his liege with a smile..."

Gotta get somewhere where folks will help me get away!” The hyena mumbled loudly under belaboured breaths.\n\nMaax brushed a merchant out of the way as he dashed around a corner and towards the market square, his yeti pursuers close behind. He couldn’t tell what they were saying with the air rushing past his ears, but they certainly weren’t happy. All eyes began turning to him as he came quickly to a halt, looking for a way through the bustling morning stalls. The chaos could have been useful if there was someone willing to help him, but most had already turned their attention back to their shopping for the day.\n\nHe grimaced and decided simply to try and weave around some of the empty carts, dashing in a randomly selected direction just as one of the yetis was about to try and tackle him. They were closer now and he could hear them calling after him, blowing their military police whistles.\n\nAs he saw what he could only describe as apathy from his kin, he shouted. “Come on, they’re going to run me down!”\n\nTo his dismay, not a single soul gave him the time of day. He almost ran straight into the first barrow he came across, causing him to lose his pawing and trip on the unpaved ground just as he was beginning to put some distance between him and his pursuers. They caught up with him much faster than it would have taken him to get up and moving again.\n\n“Ugh...” Maax gave out simply, lifting a paw to his forehead. “Why... Why wont they help me? Why won't you help?!” He managed to cry out, exasperated at the uninterested crowd in front of him as the yetis put his paws in cuffs.\n\nA nobody buying vegetables from a nearby store finally decided to answer the soon-to-be trialled hyena, simply annoyed with his disturbance. “Because we have better things to be doing than helping some pickpocket or burglar or whatever it is you did to get the police after you! We’d rather get on with our lives than risk being locked up ourselves.”\n\nOne of the police officers chuckled as they watched the colour instantaneously drain from the dog’s face. He clearly hadn’t been expecting the attitude of his fellow hyenas to change so quickly. They had all underestimated how much cheap food and goods did for the stability of a conquered people. Almost nobody in this town could get away with starting fights between the locals and the yetis anymore.\n\nMaax’s defeated expression turned shortly afterward into one of horror as his captors handed him over to a hyenian officer who offered to take him back to the station."

Only when all yetis are within our borders may we be truly united.”\n\nOf course, only silence filled the room in the absence of her words. She rested a hand on the hilt of her sword and rocked it back and forth slowly in its scabbard, wondering if there was something she had missed. Ibyz couldn’t help but run through the hundreds of planning documents and written speeches in her head. There were no mistakes in any of them, nor could they possibly contain one which would provide a sense of calm when rectified; but over and over them she went, searching for something to pick at to give herself pause.\n\n“They will not let us simply have this land. Our eastern stretches contain their capital and many hyenas. This will be a war whether we want one or not. A preemptive strike is the only course of action that we can truly rely on.” She continued, voice echoing through the empty room. “It is a necessary evil.”\n\nAt that she paused and looked up, having paced back and forth a few times whilst in thought.

By the time he was back from the yearly Mzizima landowner summit, he was more than aware of where state investments would be going before he read the meticulously prepared memo that Ibyz Icepaw had made sure was delivered to his home.\n\nIt came as no surprise that she was spreading the vast majority of grants and infrastructure projects contracts in and around the Rainband rather than in the Zwahile as he would have preferred. Imamu had hoped that she would have thought better of that decision, considering how rowdy his family were becoming; but he couldn’t fault her for trying to give something to the many creatures that were still adjusting to her rule. It was a wise economic decision, if one that had poor political optics.\n\nPerhaps more surprising was the note that she had tacked to the bottom of the memo, scrawled in Her Majesty’s typically angular handwriting:\n\nI am sorry that I could not tell you in person and I hope you understand this choice; I know you will recognise the economic benefits of this programme and promises I have made to my subjects, pain your relatives as it may.\n\nGood luck with your family,\n- II\n\nHe blinked and read the note a few times over before allowing himself a smile.

All the same, she needed the assistance of these creatures if she wanted her development scheme in the Rainband to succeed.\n\nThe Storm Queen took in the relative quiet of the side room for a minute or so, taking the time to collect her thoughts. She needed suppliers, contractors and investors; all of whom were currently enjoying themselves - as much as they could - at this high society dinner party of hers. Normally she would have entrusted Imamu with this kind of work, but of course...\n\n“Your Majesty, there are a few guests asking after you. Is everything to your satisfaction?” One of the waiters asked delicately as he sauntered into the room.\n\nThe voices behind the door were a little quieter than they should have been, but then many of them had no doubt watched her leave the hall. “Yes, thank you. I just required a moment with my thoughts, this is all... quite new for me.”\n\n“Of course, Your Majesty.” He said simply, expression kind but with words cold and professional.\n\nThe monarch paused for a moment and then forced a toothy smile, straightened up her cape and went for the door back into the fray. She was going to have to get this over with one way or another, so she might as well suffer and succeed instead of calling off the party with nothing to show for it.\n\nStill, Ibyz couldn’t help but miss the presence of a certain zebra."

SLC_post_scw.12.d:0 "“Aside from our excellent quarterly financial report, I have some more good news.” Imamu gave out with a wide smile.\n\nAlthough the family had done well for itself under the rule of the Storm Queen, they had become weary of her political decision-making. They were no longer her primary source of manufactured goods and industrial capacity in general, which meant that she had been far less favourable towards the Uzerasi family as of late; not outright detrimental to their activity of course, but certainly acting with enough ambivalence to cause concern. For his part, the head of the family was more than happy to assuage those fears.\n\n“Her Majesty the Storm Queen,” He paused to allow for some eyebrow raises and groans, “Has graciously decided to offer a litany of grants and large swathes of funding to various local governments in the Zwahile. She has stated that this is both a reward for the dutiful service of the Uzerasi family during the civil war and a sign of her trust in...”\n\nHe could barely get out the last parts of the announcement for the sudden buzz amongst his attending relatives. Imamu couldn’t help but chuckle at how quickly their demeanour turned completely around as he excused himself and left them to their musings.\n\nHe opened a heavy wooden door into the study of his Mzizima home, ready to give a certain someone the good news. Ibyz Icepaw had taken the time to deliver the news in person and was currently sitting at his desk, having just finished writing up yet more paperwork.\n\n“Judging by your expression, I would guess that they took the news well?” The Storm Queen asked with a barely perceptible smile.\n\nThe zebra nodded as he gently closed the door behind him, “They did indeed. I appreciate you going out of your way to alleviate their concerns, I am well aware that it was not the most immediately beneficial choice for the kingdom. That’s without even mentioning the grumbles from the military and your own figures of importance that you’re no doubt receiving.”\n\nIbyz waved a hand dismissively, putting down the fountain pen she’d been fiddling with. “I’d rather their childish whining to my face than Uzerasi plotting behind my back.”"

SLC_post_scw.13.d:0 "Frankly, they were all absolutely terrified. Why the Storm Queen had elected to embark on an investment spree in the Zwahile in spite of the actions of the Uzerasi was a mystery, save perhaps the long-term economic benefits of industrialising such a rural region. It was nevertheless clear to the assembled zebras that they were not in a position to bargain or complain once in the presence of Her Majesty.\n\nAs they sat silently looking at one another, the yeti in question entered the conference room with a small pile of documents in her hands. “Good day. You have all been selected to receive conditional tax cuts and construction grants under this new programme. I am aware that some of you have only recently been promoted to your positions after state repossessions of Uzerasi property; those in that number will receive leniency in quotas for a short period.”\n\nA storm creature emerged from seemingly nowhere and took the files out of her hands, depositing them in front of the assembled industrialists. They - of course - began reading the documents and were comforted ever-so-slightly by the largely reasonable terms contained within. The beady eyes of both the storm creature and the Storm Queen did not allow for peace of mind, however.\n\n“I’m sure you find the terms agreeable,” She continued on, causing the rustling of paper to silence instantaneously. “And I’m sure that you know of what will happen to those who fail to meet their quotas. You are allowed to decline participation in this project, but the economy must grow; falling behind other great states is not permissible. Acceptance and success will be rewarded, as is all service to the state.”\n\nThe assembled zebras shared some glances as they thought over whether they were in or out. The targets were demanding, but not absurd; they could be achieved, especially with the promised funding and a reduction in overhead.\n\nEach and every one of them knew the fate that awaited traitors; yet they were also keenly aware that if they did not accept these offers, someone else surely would."

SLC_post_scw.14.t:0 "The Start of Something New"
SLC_post_scw.14.d:0 "In hindsight, the fortifications surrounding the centre of the Eye of the Storm had turned out to be quite a waste. The Storm King had ordered their construction as a way to ensure that his seat of power could not be easily assaulted, but none would challenge his reign by the time it was finished. Following his death it proved to be largely ineffective at stopping the forces of his soon-to-be successor also, although it had presented a moderate logistical challenge at the time.\n\nNevertheless, the vast majority of structures were clearly outmoded; thus it was that Her Majesty saw fit to repurpose the old walls and buildings for the modern era. It had taken a substantial amount of capital and an absurd level of planning in order to properly retrofit all of the structures with adequate facilities, but the project was eventually completed and on schedule no less.\n\nThe sight of so many young and unburdened souls prompted a fleeting thought about what might have been, had the Storm Queen not pursued a military career from such a young age. In truth there weren’t a huge number of subjects which she could have truly excelled in, unless something culinary was offered of course. Even so, it was hard not to be jealous of the better world that she trying to build for her subjects on occasion.\n\nAs the idea passed, Ibyz was still very much enjoying an unguided tour of the new campus with a couple of storm creatures in tow; drawing looks from every student and lecturer as she went. Her Majesty was in quite a good mood, although you wouldn’t know that from the expression she was currently wearing. A not-insignificant part of her simply enjoyed the knowledge that her predecessor would have hated everything about this. He didn’t care about governing, or about his kind’s education; just about magic and acquiring more of it for power’s sake. That was why he could not see past his own ego and why the Storm Queen took such unnoticed joy in this particular project."

SLC_post_scw.15.d:0 "“I can’t say I’m particularly happy with this new research budget, Your Majesty.” Imamu gave out, containing his exasperation. “I feel I don’t need to explain why it is at best mildly concerning and at worst a betrayal of your typical governing principles. We should be providing for entrepreneurs, farmers and manufacturing plants; if not for the discovery of potentially groundbreaking technological improvements then at least for general economic investment.”\n\nIbyz Icepaw was sat across from the zebra, trying her best to enjoy the meal that had been prepared for their formal meeting. It was quite a bland seafood dish compared to some of the things that she had learned to cook in the Zwahile, but that was quite typical of yeti cuisine. The relative lack of spices and garnish was less pressing than this conversation which she had admittedly been trying to avoid, as her friend evidently suspected.\n\nThe Storm Queen made sure her mouth and fangs were clean with a napkin before answering, “The private sector cannot be trusted to conduct research safely on its own.The state is not yet able to properly police such projects. Many proposals would still be under the purview of the armed forces even if it was.”\n\nIf looks could kill, Imamu’s current glare would have put his yeti companion in the ground multiple times over by now. Almost an entire minute of him seething silently and trying to maintain his composure passed before he made to offer some words of wisdom once more.\n\n“Military-led research is only going to result in a progressively larger military budget and less for the sectors of the economy that will actually propel the economy in the coming decades. How can you pretend that the average zebra or even the average yeti is going to be allowed to have a look at new military hardware, let alone somehow use what they see for their benefit? They’re all just tools for wars they don’t want to fight!” He managed through gritted teeth.\n\n”Weapons to defend the progress we have already made for our citizens are not a short term investment, Imamu. You of all creatures should know that.” She returned simply and with uncharacteristic harshness, though still avoiding his gaze.\n\nAs they continued eating, Ibyz considered that logic and had to admit to herself that he made a relatively well-founded assessment; but unfortunately charity and industrial investments would not keep the kingdom secure."

SLC_post_scw.16.t:0 "Another Day, Another Report"
SLC_post_scw.16.d:0 "So far the Storm Queen was quite pleased with the details of the report. Many projects were proceeding at an unprecedented pace thanks to the injection of additional funds and a significant number of those were potentially promising for the military. There were a few disappointments, of course; but nothing so severe that she immediately regretted allocating much of the new budget to projects with ties to the military-industrial complex.\n\nSatisfied with her reading for the moment, she returned to her tea. The general staff had been quite surprised by the choice of a tea shop as the venue for their meeting, but at the crown’s expense; why not? It made for a nice change, even for those who weren’t overly fond of light conversation.\n\n“Have you seen the progress they’re making with the magitech engines, Your Majesty?” Vurka Stormfall asked from the other side of the small table.\n\nShe nodded whilst nibbling distractedly at a complementary ginger biscuit, “I have. The project is interesting, though...”\n\nAs she trailed off, the officer chuckled and answered on her behalf. “I know, I know. The reliability of the things, right? They make Hailbane’s first tanks look sturdy in comparison.”\n\n“Right,” The Storm Queen responded with a subtle nod, “That and the cost.”\n\nVurka nodded and waited a moment before offering a polite bow and giving her some evidently wanted space.\n\nA small part of her wondered how Imamu would feel about this direction of research budgeting, but the rest of her was already aware of how much he would have disapproved if he could have. The public didn’t want to see new tanks and planes unless they were unveiled at parades, even if such projects were a necessary part of defending the kingdom. Unfortunately national interests were simply more important than those of a given individual. She sighed and took another haphazard bite from the biscuit that she’d been gripping a little too strongly in her hand. Not a bad taste, although maybe a little heavy on the sugar.\n\nSitting and listening to the conversations of her surrounding subordinates for a little longer, the Storm Queen once again found herself opening up the report docket to see if she could find anything that might hold her attention upon further investigation, anything that would keep her mind occupied for the time being.\n\n“He wouldn’t understand.” Ibyz muttered to herself, pushing away the rest of her tea and sighing with an empty stare."

He’d even demanded that they go out for dinner as his way of saying thank you for not listening to the loud voices of the armed forces, which had only been becoming more boisterous as time went on. It was truly a night to celebrate, at least for him.\n\nHer majesty was much more interested in the local cuisine, but not so much that she couldn’t pause for conversation. “I am... surprised that you care so much about the nation’s scientific progress.”\n\n“Well, actually there are a few reasons for me to be enthused by this news.” The zebra responded, taking a moment to swallow his pilau before satiating Her Majesty’s thinly veiled curiosity. “For one, some of the recent agricultural projects show a good chance of restoring the profitability of many family farming estates. More importantly though, I’m simply glad to see that the military isn’t being favoured over the rest of the kingdom; I’d heard they were very much looking forward to the next budgetary cycle.”\n\nIbyz nodded slowly as she too savoured a mouthful of the same local Zwahile dish, taking in the flavours and the spices in particular for a moment. The military certainly had been getting loud, but they did not cloud her judgement. A balanced approach to state funding of research was the sensical choice and one that would benefit the creatures of the kingdom; even if the lack of new weapons was a considerable concern to her and to the military.\n\nOf course, the Storm Queen didn’t say any of that out loud; she simply gave out a grunt and smiled back at her friend. “That’s good.”"

The Storm Queen had many responsibilities to attend to in the wake of the western revolt and this evening she was particularly engrossed in her notes on the allocation of research funding.\n\nThe military had quietly questioned the decision she had made to show no favouritism to the armed forces, which was a fair concern given the circumstances. Military research was perhaps the best way to protect the kingdom in these trying times, yet Her Majesty was all too aware that recent events necessitated a gesture of gratitude to the loyal intellectuals and dutiful researchers that had not defected or disappeared.\n\nWith a sigh she placed the overflowing docket down on the table and murmured to herself absentmindedly, “I should ask Imamu to inspect this.”\n\nThe Storm Queen didn’t second guess those words until she’d picked up her cutlery, at which point she realised what she had said and could only stare at the half finished meal in front of her. It took a minute or so until Ibyz sighed in exasperation and shook her head vigorously, messing up her fur a little as she finally went to continue eating.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the food was cold by now. The pork was roasted, spiced and glazed to perfection, the vegetables were part boiled and fried to a zenith of taste and the cheese sauce contained just the right amount of garlic and other herbs; yet the absence of warmth remained.\n\nHer Majesty slowly finished the dish nonetheless.

She wasn’t the social sort even in the best of times, but hosting upwards of two-hundred creatures of a non-military variety was not something she had a significant amount of experience with. On top of that, said non-military creatures were no ordinary citizens of the kingdom. These were industrialists, landowners and local representatives; all of whom had their various grievances with both Her Majesty and one another. Years of slow industrial growth alongside the meddling of the Uzerasi’s most influential and the mounting popular demand for better standards of living had turned these groups rapidly against one another.\n\nAt the head of the enormous conference table she sat, waiting and watching as the guests filtered slowly into the room. The majority were yetis with a large minority of zebras also in attendance. Even some storm creatures - who had specialised chairs to account for their bulky frames - had made an appearance as requested. Ibyz Icepaw was both pleased and slightly more apprehensive for this, knowing that they had all come at her behest.\n\nAs the last seats were filled, the Storm Queen stood before her guests and cleared her throat. “You have all been assembled here today so that we may coordinate contracts for upcoming public works projects. Some are here because they can provide materials. Some are here because you can provide expertise. Some are here because others will need permission to operate on or buy out. I am here to make sure all of these arrangements are completed today.”\n\nWith a quizzical hand gesture, a number of storm creature guards began distributing folders of paper around the room. Creatures immediately realised they had already been seated in positions near others that they would need to talk to - a fine idea on Ibyz’s part - and began to discuss the finer details of their quite numerous tasks.\n\nSome discussions were largely peaceful and others quickly became heated, but as Her Majesty walked slowly around the table she settled debates as succinctly as she could.

She was used to debates with colleagues of the same rank and long conversations with similarly or opposingly minded officers, not being the adjudicator of such discussions. It wasn’t made any easier for all the new faces that seemed to be uncomfortably reverent of their new Queen.\n\nThis particular meeting was additionally unusual in that it included almost every officer from every branch simultaneously, each separated into their own sections of the enormous meeting room that had been prepared for them. The navy was - of course - the smallest of the three officer groupings, the air force was contending with both airship hardliners and plane proponents and the army was divided down several lines beyond that.\n\nWith no notable exceptions they were all ready and accounted for a few minutes before the briefing even began, allowing for Her Majesty to begin right away. “This assembly of the general staff has one purpose: To settle doctrinal disagreements and cement the general direction of your branches in the near and far future. I expect from each branch an overview within six hours and - in the days following - comprehensive training and evaluation documents to be produced based on the discussions you have today and the aforementioned overview.”\n\nIn an almost deafening chorus, the entire hall replied in kind. “Yes ma’am!”\n\nThere was a kind of excitement in the air, an electricity of sorts; the kind that would have made the Storm Queen’s fur stand on end were it a tangible static. Yet, there was little fuss despite the arguments she knew were happening in their circles. All were working towards a common goal.\n\nAll were being listened to, even the youngest and lowest ranking of the officers. All creatures - be they zebra or yeti - were heard and accounted for. Were it not for the fact that the quietness came from a place of fear in many of their hearts, Her Majesty would have shared her own little piece of that feeling in the air.\n\nAs she sat and watched the parties in deep discussion, she recognised a few faces in the discussions. Ravakh was doing his best to keep the airship tactically relevant, Zelitha was nervously enlightening a group of yetis regarding the finer points of local collaboration and Urzak was arguing with Vurka about static and flexible defensive strategies. Only they and the other creatures that actually knew the presiding monarch seemed to be free from concerns about their personal safety."

She tried to meet his gaze with as little assertiveness as physically possible, given the circumstances.\n\nThe zebra’s hooves trembled with rage as he went on, “I realise that there are certain elements in the government and the military who would prefer if yetis and yetis alone received the full benefits of citizenship. I know there are creatures that do not trust you and far more that do not trust me. You, I know, are cognisant of the utter moral bankruptcy that is required for you to simply ignore the inequality that zebras and other races that live within the kingdom experience and the harsh treatment they endure in the streets and at whatever yeti-owned businesses at which they've been semi-forcefully employed. So why choose to do nothing? What were you thinking?!”\n\nIbyz Icepaw sighed deeply and waited a moment or two before responding, just in case he had more to say. “‘Nothing’ would imply that I do not plan to entirely phase out slavery. This is not the case. I admit the moral faults of the status quo, particularly in majority zebra territories; which is why I have reorganised the regional administrations in those areas.”\n\nImamu continued to simply stare at her, his hair ruffled and his coat thoroughly unkempt. This was a kind of rage that Her Majesty seldom saw in any creature, let alone the always calm and collected Imamu. She was - as he would say - playing with fire. The Storm Queen was confident in the decision that she had made, but trying to justify it would undoubtedly end either in tears or a brawl.\n\n“I apologise for the grief I am causing you,” She added gently, not quite knowing what to say.\n\nThe zebra went almost completely stiff, “There is no simple apology for this, Your Majesty. Even if there were, I would not be the only creature that deserves one.” He gave out in disbelief, turning to leave before his anger drove him to do something he’d regret. “Maybe I was wrong about you, Ibyz.”"

The family portraits that had been torn down in the hallway were enough to make her choke up just a little as she passed them, a feeling that became overwhelming when she found the kitchen in tatters at the other end of it.\n\nThe zebra's sobbing was only interrupted when she heard the all-too-familiar pawsteps of storm creatures upstairs, evidently not feeling the need to hide their presence now that the lady of the house had returned and had nearly collapsed at the still-standing half of their dining room table. It wasn’t long before the familiar silent breathing and the overbearing presence of the massive monsters could be felt, even as her teary eyes remained closed.\n\n“You’ve already found him, haven’t you?!” She cried out as the creatures slowly approached her.\n\nHer manic sobbing was quickly overwhelmed by absolute fear as one of the furry beasts grabbed Barika by the scruff of her neck with its hands. That alone almost took her breath away completely, but then the creature threw her up against a wall hard enough that one of her ribs was sure to have broken. It pinned her to the brickwork, holding her forehooves to the wall with an immense arm and using a polearm to trap her hindlegs in place on the floor. Not once did its ice-cold gaze break from staring directly into the mare’s eyes, forcing her to look away as she tried to breathe and recover.\n\nAs the creature allowed her a few seconds to recover, she came to the conclusion that they must not have found him yet; otherwise they would probably have left her to wallow in the destruction they had wrought. The beast’s gaze hardened as it drew its mask closer to her snout, watching as her expression of pained shock was gradually replaced with a tired, defiant smile.\n\nWith a rasp in her voice, Barika spoke with a hint of pride. “If you haven’t yet, you never will. He’ll never come back here once he hears.”\n\nAt that, the two creatures exchanged glances and some inscrutable head movements. In mere moments the second creature had stepped forward and knocked their new captive out cold with a brutal punch to the side of her head."

They treated him like the yetis treated her, even though he technically wasn’t a ruler in any real capacity. Still, it was nice to have someone passing you things you asked for every once in a while.\n\nThe head of the visited family that he was making time for cleared his throat to quieten his foals for a moment, “Do you mind if we leave the radio on? I’m told that ‘Her Majesty’ will be making an announcement tonight.”\n\n“Not at all. In fact, allow me.” Imamu returned with an earnest smile as he offered the partly-used lemon to one of the fillies to his left.\n\nHad there been any yetis present he would of course have chastised the use of such deliberate sarcasm, but now was not the time or place. In fact - as he got down from the table to turn the knobs on the device - he was quietly hoping that Ibyz Icepaw would shortly be making his host eat his words alongside his meal. That would certainly make the thinly veiled insult of his friend a little easier to bear.\n\nHe had scarcely had time to start on the admittedly sub-par ugali and chipsi mayai when the slow burn of local news turned into a national broadcast over the crackling radio. “Citizens of the Storm Kingdom, today I come with good news. Great news, even. By the week’s end, laws regarding religious and social protections for all minority races within the kingdom will come into effect. Discrimination is to end in all legal and then social forms, if not naturally in the years to come then by threat of force or legal action. The ancestors smile on all of us, not just some. Your local government office will contain...”\n\nImamu turned back to his host who was staring directly at him with wide eyes, forcing him to hold back a chuckle."

Six hours and three drafts of the speech she was going to give on the radio and she still hadn’t managed to create something that she was pleased with.\n\nSoon enough she was forced to put it down and perform some basic stretches, pushing her digits out as wide as possible for a minute or so before curling them in without touching her palms for another two. Perhaps unsurprisingly, that brief exercise did not undo the general muscle fatigue of six hours of furious writing; nor did it alleviate the general air of stress.\n\nIn the past she would have at least been able to run such a speech past Imamu but...\n\nHer Majesty quietly groaned as a knock on the door to her study broke her concentration, “Entry... is permitted.”\n\n“My liege,” A timid, evidently green member of the palace staff began quietly. “You requested that you be reminded when the speech was soon to be made. It is to be recorded tomorrow, in the afternoon.”\n\nShe turned her gaze from the servant to the surprisingly large pile of scrunched up notes on her desk, then back again. “Thank you. Please ensure that everything is prepared. I will be ready.\n\nThe servant glanced at the waste paper, but bowed and made to leave before he could truly hesitate. “Yes, my liege.”\n\nShe stared into space as the door closed once more, wondering if trying to compose a speech was even worthwhile. After a few minutes of simple silence, Ibyz tenderly picked up the pen with a slightly less shaky hand and adjusted another sheet of paper.

His snout was mostly hidden behind the papers that he was sifting through, but she knew there was a giddy grin somewhere behind the documents even if she couldn’t see it. If Her Majesty could read anyone, it was him.\n\n“...become criminal offences punishable by time in prison and the closure of business...” The zebra murmured to himself as he poured over the fine print, looking for some way that the laws could be circumvented.\n\nOf course, this was the work of Ibyz Icepaw. There were no such loopholes, nor was there a sense of begrudging acceptance about the laws. They were firm and potentially harsh, depending on the severity of the breach in conduct; no creature would want to be on the wrong side of these anti-slavery measures.\n\nEventually he set down the papers, beaming as predicted. “You’ve outdone yourself, Your Majesty. This will free tens of thousands of creatures from chattel slavery and indentured servitude, I don’t think even my family would be able to get around these laws.”\n\n“Well it wasn’t a difficult decision to make,” Ibyz began, doing her best to hide her own expression for a moment. “After all, the long term economic ramifications of slavery are inherently detrimental and result in the lack of skilled labour in the lowest strata of society. It would mean slower growth and eventually a political class of wealthy slavers who would no doubt be problematic.”\n\nHaving missed her initial smile, Imamu raised an eyebrow at the explanation. He had assumed that she had some sort of moral obligation for this work and he could never tell whether the Storm Queen was being serious or not.\n\nHis sudden concern was soothed when she allowed herself to chuckle through her large fangs, “And because slavery of all kinds is fundamentally evil, of course.”"

SLC_post_scw.26.d:0 "Unlike her predecessor, the Storm Queen did not overly enjoy appearing in public. It was a tedious affair that wasted valuable hours of a day, especially when a radio broadcast was almost always more time efficient and less costly in organisational terms. All the same, there were some kinds of news that were more appropriately shared in person and in front of a crowd; even if it meant having to manage an enormous public event.\n\nIbyz Icepaw took one last look at her dress uniform, adjusting a couple of medals in a mirror before nodding at her bodyguards. They each stood firmly by the palace’s great metal doors and followed their ruler as she strode over and threw them open emphatically. There were a number of additional soldiers and a podium already set up at the top of the great palace steps which Her Majesty approached through the roars of the assembled crowd below. Many were happy to see her, though it wasn’t hard to pick out a few booing zebras amongst the attendees; it was important to make the occasion seem as real as possible, after all. Arresting them would only ruin the atmosphere and undermine what she was about to announce.\n\nComing to a halt at the podium, the Storm Queen raised a hand for quiet as she began to speak. “Citizens of the Storm Kingdom, I speak today about news concerning those in the country that have suffered more than any others. The slave trade, though it has waxed and waned over the years, has no place in the realm today. This nation is one of many cultures, all of whom deserve the right to exist for themselves and not merely for another creature’s benefit. As such, slavery and those in indentured servitude of all kinds will today become free and be remunerated for their suffering.”\n\nShe might have gone on to elaborate were it not for the sudden cheers that erupted from the previously hushed crowd. Most of them would be entirely unaffected by this change, but there were a notable number of hyenas and zebras amongst the mass of creatures as well as a large number of young and relatively liberal yetis that were in support of such changes. Once they had started cheering, the rest followed in support of their still-popular monarch. Even amongst those that she had spied booing shortly before were - at the very least - too taken aback by this announcement to heckle her.\n\nAs she stood in front of the writhing mass of attendees and waited for a moment to continue speaking with their full attention, Ibyz felt Imamu’s absence. Not just because he would probably have confidently taken this opportunity to do something showy for the crowd or because he would no doubt have managed to quieten down the mob himself; moreso simply because might have liked to see this. He might have liked to be a part of it.\n\nAs the noise began to die down, the Storm Queen cleared her throat and leaned forward into the microphone to continue, hoping that her speech would live up to the ones that he had written."

For now though, you’ll be operating the machines! I’ll be honest, it’s not easy work; these things are heavy as anything! That said, they’ll build up some muscle and get you familiar with how we do things around here all the same!” The yeti shouted out over the noise of the various machines they were operating.\n\nThe floor manager had been a pretty decent guy all things considered. He was loud but not too loud, funny but not frustrating and most importantly he knew what he was talking about yet could still dumb the technical stuff down for the ensemble of new workers.\n\nThe loose collection of zebras and yetis would be starting here in a few days, having previously been on the streets or just about to be thrown there. It didn’t matter what they would be doing so long as they could get enough money together for some food and lodgings of some sort. A few of them had arranged to sleep somewhere quiet in the plant in order to try and get themselves back on their hooves, which was a generally uplifting notion for all involved. Shame they hadn’t installed any showers yet, but they’d figure something out.\n\nStopping roughly in the centre of the floor, the manager gestured around them with both hands. “Before we move on, have we got any questions?!”\n\nA few moments of ‘silence’ were interrupted by a thoroughly dishevelled zebra, “How dangerous are the machines?”\n\n“Not at all, as long as you do what we say and don’t mess around near the lines!” The yeti replied with a slightly unnerving smile.\n\nIt was a good enough answer for the zebra at least and so the group continued on towards the staff facilities, occasionally taking a look at various monstrous machines as they went."

He had accepted the development of the military-industrial complex during the civil war because it was the only realistic way to improve industrial standards nationwide without making a huge fuss with his family who had been the only large-scale producers of equipment at the time. It was a win-win relationship back then, but continuing such policies during a period of relative peace was concerning to say the least.\n\n“I don’t mean to dismiss your work, but is there really no other way?” He asked carefully, trying to keep eye contact with the yeti. “I didn’t think these kinds of policies would be necessary once we had access to a larger pool of skilled labour and technical expertise.”\n\nThe Storm Queen eventually levelled her gaze at him and hummed before answering, “There are other ways, but this is the safest one. There are already a number of companies producing equipment for us that also create civilian goods. These companies have significantly reduced the prices of technology for consumers using techniques they originally developed for military designs. It is the most reliable way to guarantee the spread of expertise and technology as well as a stable and reliable source of weapons for the military.”\n\nThe zebra considered this but shook his head disappointedly as he realised that Her Majesty’s mind was already made up. “I cannot stop you, but I still do not believe that this is a good idea. You have placed too much trust in the kindness of companies that profit most in times of conflict and strife. The allies of war are not the friends of our people.”"

Modern factories were by no means poor when it came to working conditions, especially when visited by the Storm Queen, but there was something quite eerie about the workers here.\n\nThe zebra in front of her and the floor managers was currently putting the finishing touches on a new rifle which he then handed over. Her Majesty inspected it for a half minute as though on parade, quite impressed with the craftscreatureship from an apparently quite recent hire. With a satisfied grunt she closed the bolt of the rifle with a satisfying series of metal ‘clinks’ and handed it back to the zebra who bowed his head in turn.\n\n“A fine rifle. My compliments.” She gave out simply, managing a half-hearted smile.\n\nLooking up with mild surprise, the zebra stammered out a response. “T-thank you, Your Majesty.”\n\nAs he placed the weapon back on the workbench, Ibyz understood why she had that unnerving feeling; nobody here was happy to be working. Of course it was a hard job and making weapons of war was far from an emotionally satisfying prospect for most, but there wasn’t a single smile in this place. No excited engineers, no giddy designers and certainly no machine operators that had simply heard some good news this morning.\n\nOn further consideration, that revelation wasn’t exactly surprising. The zebra floor workers especially had no reason to take pride in their work considering who the weapons would be used on and by. In fact, it was really quite surprising that this plant had continued to produce such high quality arms given the large ratio of zebra workers. Perhaps a health and safety audit was in order...\n\n“Is everything in order, Your Majesty?” One of the managers asked carefully, “You’ve been watching this one for quite some time.”\n\nShe turned to the yeti in question with a dismissive hand gesture, “Yes, thank you.

At one time he’d pondered why Ibyz would do such a thing when connections and good relations were so important, but he had come to realise the value in being able to take a step back from being the centre of attention. Of course, she spent rather too much time in the wings of events like these for how valuable good relations and new connections could be; but the yeti had still taught him caution that he previously hadn’t exercised.\n\n“Ah, Haki! It’s wonderful to see you again,” A rather loud noble began, somewhere to the right of his liege. “In fact, I’m very glad to be seeing so many friendly faces. Too many commoners and... yeti contractors. Ugh, what a nightmare they’ve been for business.”\n\nImamu smiled subtly and kept his face turned away from the conversation, graciously accepting a thin glass of champagne to occupy him whilst listening in.\n\n“Sahel,” The mare returned, seemingly more wary of her voice’s volume. “It has been too long, hasn’t it? I must say that I share your enthusiasm for this little dinner party of ours. I’ve seen far too much of ‘Her Majesty’s’ armed forces as of late. They’re tearing our towns apart!”\n\nThe stallion nodded thoroughly enough that his clothes could be heard shaking as he responded, “Oh yes! I haven’t even had time to process the absolute debacle that Lending a Hand has been. The bastards have built a wall in the middle of my garden and they’re turning the rest into public housing and facilities! The noise alone has been driving me utterly mad!”\n\n“Quite,” Haki returned, clearly trying not to let her friend’s shortsightedness get to her. “And you’ve seen the way our subjects have been treating the soldiers, haven’t you? They’re acting like those monsters are heroes! I’ve even seen some zebras giving them gifts whilst they’re digging wells and tearing up roads to put in water pipes, it’s quite extraordinary. I’m beginning to think that they’re seeing themselves less like our subjects and more like hers.”\n\nThe amount of spite that dripped from the lady’s mouth as she placed vicious emphasis on ‘hers’ was palpable even before Imamu had turned around to get himself back into the thick of things. He knew very well that Ibyz’s public works projects were for both economic development and her popularity, the latter perhaps even moreso; but it was difficult to deny the real positive impact they were having on his kin.

SLC_post_scw.31.d:0 "Ibyz Icepaw was lying in her oversized bed, looking straight up at the ceiling.\n\nFor all the wealth contained within the palace, the building and the rooms within it were markedly lacking in any real sense of artistry. Gold and silver could be seen plastered everywhere - across most of the walls, ceilings and floors - and yet nothing of note was done with any of it. Hardly surprising, considering the Storm King had little care for any beauty besides that which was encompassed by powerful magical artefacts. He drove local artists underground as a side effect of the unification war and felt no desire to rehabilitate the arts after the fact.\n\nIn this way, Her Majesty felt she would be no better. She was no artist, nor was she particularly enamoured with the history of yetikind; she was just another officer with a little more foresight than pride. In truth, it sometimes felt like merely the lack of pride.\n\nShe sighed and turned over under the single-layer sheets, having been trying to take her mind off of another question. What was she going to do with the Lending a Hand programme after the western revolt? It had certainly helped develop the Zwahile to an extent, but the military no longer relied on it for resources and support; nor were they particularly excited to continue building up a region of the kingdom that had just rebelled against them. Not only that, but Mzizima would have previously received the most help if the project were to be given another few years of funding, thanks to its population density. Needless to say that the optics on economically favouring the home city of the treacherous Uzerasi were now subpar at best.\n\nOn the other hand, formalising the role of the military-industrial complex in the country’s economic system was arguably even worse. The gaggle of industrialists and the new owners of recently nationalised Uzerasi industries did not need any more power and there were significant long-term social risks associated with reinforcing the warlike personna of the species through economics. More directly, such a system would necessitate participation in conflicts either directly or indirectly in order to ensure the stability of some of the most technically advanced companies and factories in the country.\n\nThe Storm Queen turned over at least another six times before she settled on an answer that finally let her fall asleep. The Zwahile needed the investment, especially after such a brutal and destabilising revolt. There would be a lot of calls to make tomorrow."

It was a good morning to relax and nibble on some admittedly unhealthy snacks in the process.\n\nThere wasn’t much in the way of interesting articles in this particular tabloid. Yeti-centric papers like this one usually didn’t have much to say when it came to the Zwahile or his family either, but they did normally report on breaking news faster. The worst part about ‘The Ice Times’ was just how biased some of the writers seemed to be. If Ibyz Icepaw was as much an avid headline reader as she was a headline maker she would probably have had this publication shut down, or worse.\n\nSighing as he turned another page, the zebra had to hold a hoof to his mouth and carefully swallow as he re-read the next headline out loud. “Mmmh... Zebra wage increases, national budget suffers...”\n\nDespite needing to contain both surprise and a laugh at the inflammatory headline, Imamu was actually interested in this particular piece. He hadn’t been in contact with the Storm Queen for almost a week - a rare thing indeed these days - and so he had been doing his best to keep up with her non-stop stream of reforms from afar. This case specifically left him feeling rather conflicted once he had finished reading the whole thing.\n\nIn essence Ibyz had decided to enact a form of affirmative action in the military, giving zebras who served or were soon to serve certain perks and better pay. The article’s writer was, unsurprisingly, not a big fan of these plans and Imamu wasn’t exactly sure how he felt either. On one hoof, he was very pleased to see something being done about the zebra-yeti wage gap which had thus far been an ever-present issue in most sectors of the economy and the kingdom’s institutions especially. On the other, more zebras would now be signing up to the armed forces and many would likely perish fighting for the yeti crown.\n\nHe sat quietly for a minute or two before reaching out and grabbing another piece of the burfi he had made and chomped slowly down on it."

The good thing about yeti pattern weapons was that they were pretty simple to work with, both in combat and out. The bad thing was that they didn’t handle sand and dirt very well; although, in fairness, no complex mechanism really could.\n\nOne of the soldiers, a zebra, was having a lot more trouble with the process than her friend. “Ugh, could you pass me something heavy? I can’t grip the bolt in the right way.”\n\n“Sure,” The hulking rifleyeti gave out simply, reaching down and picking up a big stone.\n\nHe had already removed the striker mechanism from the bolt at this stage and so took a moment to clean all the dust off of stone before handing it over. He watched as Musu pressed the weapon up against it, pushed the bolt from the opposite side with one hoof and used the other to slide the bolt out of the back. She grimaced slightly as she picked up the bolt, trying now to figure out how best to remove the striker and spring.\n\nAfter a few moments, Krazakh piped up. “You want me to do it?”\n\n“One second,” She returned, still inspecting the mechanism for something she could use. “Uhm... Yes, please. This one really isn’t designed for creatures without hands.”\n\nThe yeti simply chuckled and took the rifle, going ahead with the process. “Since I’m sorting this out for you, I’ve got a question.”\n\nIntently watching him work, the zebra nodded slowly. “Shoot.”\n\n“How come you didn’t join the Uzerasi when they rose up? They’re fighting for all zebras in the Zwahile aren’t they?” He asked slowly, concentration firmly placed on the weapon.\n\nMusu sighed at that but made to answer all the same. “Well the fact of the matter is that Her Majesty’s policies are going to help my family a lot; get us out of the gutter, y’know? The Uzerasi weren’t all sunshine and rainbows either, even if Imamu seemed to be for a while.

Each one was a trusted collaborator in the employment of the Military Investigative Directorate and each one was about to receive a promotion and a short but not insubstantial amount of additional leave, if they wanted to take it of course. Each of them was immaculately dressed in yeti-style uniforms despite the many unique accessories that they would typically have worn, all standing at attention with perfect discipline.\n\nAs they inspected the rank, Imamu couldn’t help but feel a little uneasy. They were treated effectively as though they were soldiers and certainly fell under the organisational responsibility of the armed forces. His kin usually only ended up as collaborators because they felt like they had no other choices or because they wanted a way to benefit from the chaos. The former should have received better treatment and the latter should never have been allowed anywhere near the levers of power to begin with. Neither should have been rewarded by their occupiers for helping to perpetuate the very same occupation.\n\nHe certainly understood why the Storm Queen would be afforded a certain amount of respect by such creatures, but it was nevertheless disquieting to see them make such an effort for her. Under Ibyz Icepaw’s direction they would be paid well and had access to additional benefits which were luxuries not consistently available to those who remembered a time before yeti rule. He had heard from the family that some would still have preferred to serve him or a restored Uzerasi Kingdom at least, but looking at them now he couldn’t have said anything for sure.\n\nAfter he decided he was satisfied with a brief inspection, Imamu cleared his throat. “It brings me great pleasure to announce that you are all being offered half a year of paid leave. I’m sure you’ve already heard your subordinates talking about it already, so let’s jump to specifics. Pay will remain constant, you are welcome to refuse the offer if you so choose and you will also be permitted to return earlier than the entire leave period. You are also all due for a promotion.”\n\nThe zebra waited for any kind of response for perhaps a little too long before Ibyz Icepaw gave up and loudly added, “At ease.”\n\n“Ah,” Imamu gave out with a somewhat guilty smile, “My apologies; I’m used to wrangling extended family, not soldiers.”\n\nThe collaborators grinned at him as they relaxed, most proceeding to shake his hooves and Her Majesty’s hands. Some said they would stay, others said they’d happily take the chance to see their foals again or that they would check up on their relatives.

Hey, don’t smile like you’re glad I’m gonna be gone for ages!”\n\nThe pair laughed and continued towards the carriage at the back of the train that had been reserved for other military personnel who were going to be heading back to the Zwahile for their celebratory leave. It had come a little too late to really be considered a celebration of their victory in and contribution to the civil war, but those who wanted to see their families weren’t going to complain about it.\n\nOnce they had reached her car, the yeti turned to her with a suddenly serious look. “Just be careful okay? We both know that the west isn’t the most stable place at the moment. I doubt the rebels will be too kind to traitors if they get their hands on you.”\n\n“Hooves,” She corrected with a smirk, “But yeah, I’ll be careful Kraz. Trust me I’m gonna be staying as far away from any of the problem areas as possible and I’m not gonna take another train to Mzizima for food, that’s for sure. Even then, I am still a zebra; as long as I act casual nobody will know, right?”\n\nKrazakh raised an eyebrow with a subtle smirk, “You? Casual? I mean you can do crazy, but I don’t know about casual. Honestly, that’s a real stretch.”\n\n“Oh shush.” She gave out simply with a big smile, hoisting the heavier case onto her back.\n\nOnce her luggage was safely mounted, the pair shared a quick hug and Musu slowly clambered onto the train. It wasn’t long before the metal behemoth was leaving the station with a yeti waving away his best friend from the platform. He was quietly praying that her family were still alive after what the Zwahile had been through."

SLC_post_scw.36.d:0 "“Is this really surprising to you?” Her Majesty asked slowly with a hint of surprise, “My kind have only ever united themselves by force. Even before we were truly unified by the Storm King the only creatures that came close did so by conquest. I would not have chosen to exercise such force if I did not consider it both effective and necessary.”\n\nImamu shifted uncomfortably in his seat as the Storm Queen explained the reasoning behind the administration’s recent efforts in resistance suppression. What she said was true and it would have been unfair to say that most yetis didn’t seem to respect her more for what was being done to the disloyal. That didn’t make it any less unnerving that such violence was almost culturally ingrained, nor would it assuage the fears of the zebras in the west.\n\n“No, not really but... Well, I think you know as well as I do that this is only going to make the Zwahile more anxious. I’m against unnecessary violence even at the best of times and I am firmly of the position that this is not necessary. This being said, I also know you’re no stranger to a carrot-and-stick strategy.” He paused for a moment, bringing a hoof to his beard. “If you consider this course of action to be necessary, then I will trust you. I’m going to be on damage control for several months with my family in all likelihood, but I’ll trust you.”\n\n“Thank you and yes, I am aware that this will not be positive for the public trust in the west. I apologise in advance for the trouble this will cause you, but in the long term I assure you that this is the best course of action. Unfortunately my kind first needs to be told what to do before they start understanding things for themselves.”\n\nImamu cocked his head slightly, “You mean to say that you intend to make this the last time that the yetis treat themselves so brutally?”\n\n“Yes, I do.” She affirmed with a slow nod and a subtle smile, “I hope that my means justify my ends, in this case. With time we shall see.”\n\nThe zebra couldn’t help but wonder how long it would take as he looked up at the towering figure of Ibyz Icepaw with both hope and fear."

SLC_post_scw.37.d:0 "The storm creature sitting opposite her had blood caked over its mask. It should probably have felt more unnerving than it did, considering the implications of such a sight; but most of the creatures that had recently reported to her seemed to share this feature. Perhaps it was a sign that the Storm Queen should have slowed the number of orders she had been handing out as of late. Unfortunately, now was no time to be letting up on the pressure.\n\nBefore her were a number of files that had just been presented, detailing the lives and times of a number of local yeti leaders that had sprung up in the absence of the previously prevalent regional rulers. In particular there were many who had sprung back up in the wake of Tenzfur’s short-lived reign in the east, thanks in no small part to his lacklustre governance. Each and every one of these figures would need to be dealt with and replaced by loyal administrators of the kingdom.\n\n“You are ready to move against all three of these yetis already, yes?” She asked, focusing her gaze on the vibrant eyes of the creature sitting opposite.\n\nIt simply nodded at first, then added that kills could be confirmed within a few hours in simplified sign.\n\n“Good. Very good.” The Storm Queen exclaimed quietly, “Once all objectives are accomplished I want the new governors protected for a minimum of four weeks. We will not take any chances in this matter. Dismissed.”\n\nAgain the creature nodded, this time without anything to add. It took each document in its enormous hands and left the room with quiet steps, sauntering off to complete its assigned tasks. The room was left with an eerie silence as Ibyz sat at the now empty table, surrounded by unoccupied chairs.\n\nThis was the only way to truly unite her kind. Recent history was evidence enough that violence was a necessary component of the unification process and simply taking out opposing leaders was unquestionably the best way to go about it. Still, a part of her would have liked someone to suggest another way. A part of her knew that fixing things after the fact would only go so far, in all likelihood.\n\nEach seat remained empty all the same."

The design of the locks was quite haphazard, but it had seen rigorous use by this point and there was no mistaking its effectiveness. Indeed, he was about to witness its use for the third time today.\n\nThe plane continued its perilously rapid descent towards the target on the mountainside and let loose its payload the moment it began to level out. Soon enough the aircraft was coasting slowly back up to the same altitude as the circling scout and the bomb was tumbling down. The latter buried itself in the rocks and sand for a few seconds at first, building the anticipation for its observer who had scrambled for his binoculars and to raise them up in time.\n\nShortly afterwards the bomb went off, rocks and debris could be seen flying away from the small collection of buildings that had made up their target. “Good hit, watching for effect on target.”\n\nThe yeti was holding his radio as close to his face as physically possible, watching as the fire and smoke billowed upwards. Shortly after the initial explosion, another one followed that seemed to rupture the ground beneath; likely a buried stockpile of some denomination. Another and another followed, each detonating on a different part of the mountainside as what one could only imagine to be a firestorm flowed through a network of rebel tunnels that had been painstakingly mined out of the rock. Zekha laughed in surprise at the series of immense detonations, watching as the mountain more or less collapsed in its entirety and covered the target they had been trying to hit originally with an enormous quantity of rubble and detritus.\n\n“Good effect! Good effect! Target is destroyed and splash half of a mountain! Oh we’re gonna be getting medals on this one, for sure!” He shouted loudly over the transmitter.\n\nThe converted fighter picked up their radio to reply with a gravelly voice behind the static, “Good hunting folks, let’s head back to base.

On a quiet night you can hear when even the smallest creatures rustle leaves and when your floorboards creak from a draft.\n\nAt the base of the Clearpine mountain range, a well-guarded villa sat on one such night. The self-proclaimed chieftain of this land resided within, listening for anything in the darkness. Tenzfur had tried to have his family killed once already and failed, but Ibyz Icepaw was something else altogether. She knew strategy and she’d already turned some of their outposts into rubble with nothing to work off of. It was certainly the doing of a talented officer and that was by no means comforting information.\n\nThe flickering of torches was the first sign.\n\nBy the time the gate guards realised that they were being obscured, it was far too late to react. The hulking figures of storm creatures appeared mere inches away from the suddenly alert guards; snapping bones, ripping ligaments and tearing muscles in moments. They didn’t even have the time or breath in their lungs to scream in agony.\n\nThe following movement downstairs was not the assailants, but some of the chieftain’s guards cautiously moving to inspect yetis that hadn’t reported in. Hoovesteps were not unusual in and of themselves, yet the sudden cessation of movement certainly was. No gunshots, no grunts of pain and no shouting of orders. Something felt deeply unnerving about the stillness of the air.\n\nBy the time the local tyrant was out of bed and armed with a polearm behind the door, it was already far too late. A minute of utter silence followed; no movement, no words and no sounds whatsoever.\n\nOnly when the peace of the abode became absolute was an explosive detonated on the very wall that the chieftain was standing up against, killing him instantly and blowing out one of the villa’s walls. By the time the rest of the guards had scrambled to inspect the sudden and violent redecoration, all they could find were bodies and the charred remains of the yeti that had been paying them to try and stand against the creatures."

The garrison was only a twenty minute walk away and they’d even built the new local administration building fairly close by. Needless to say that business was booming and the locals had gotten used to the selection of down to earth yetis that frequented the establishment.\n\nToday however, a new selection of soldiers showed their faces. They were not the rugged creatures that had made this place a second home, nor were they quiet and respectful of the fact that they towered over most of the local zebras. These were rainbanders, maybe even from the Eye of the Storm itself; prim and proper in their dress uniforms and presumably on leave. Why they had chosen to travel to the Zwahile of all places they couldn’t say, but already side-eye was being shared and tensions were rising.\n\nZebras and the members of the local regiment were eyeing up the rowdy newcomers with annoyance and suspicion almost immediately. One of the larger local yetis had already gotten up from her table and was approaching the evidently intimidated barkeep with a reassuring expression. It wasn’t clear whether she was going to deck one of them across the face or just have a chat and get them to hush up a little bit. Some of the zebras were shuffling uncomfortably in their seats as the voices of the newcomers overpowered every previously ongoing conversation.\n\n“You guys must be on leave, right?” The gruff yeti lass asked as she rested against the bar, smiling as best she could manage.\n\nA few in the group turned around with bright smiles and nods, it was hard to make out who was actually talking. “You bet! We’re all taking a week’s leave before we ship out. Might end up coming down here with a bit of luck!”\n\nThe visitors’ visitor raised an eyebrow and leaned in, “Really? You might want to think about the impression you’re leaving if you plan on coming back.”\n\nThey collectively cocked their heads at that and quietened down, assuming a threat before slowly realising that they were making themselves unwelcome."

SLC_post_scw.41.d:0 "It was certainly a bizarre sight to see Ikvus Hailstorm sitting in a courtroom. He looked entirely alien to this environment, which really wasn’t far from the truth considering how much effort he had put into staying out of prison. All that work was most likely going to be for nothing, at least if the Storm Queen and the much maligned courts got their way.\n\nThe former was currently sitting in the court’s audience, along with several generals and a number of businesscreatures of all denominations. Essentially everyone of importance that had been wronged, scammed or otherwise misled by the creature on trial during his tenure as the ‘official’ regent of the kingdom and his prior service to the Storm King was in attendance.\n\n“Calling to order the case of Ikvus Hailstorm versus the kingdom.” The prosecution began, unusually holding in front of him a piece of paper which was printed on both sides. “The defendant is charged with eighteen counts of fraud, seventy-six counts of insider trading, forty-three counts of embezzlement, twenty-eight counts of money laundering, fourteen counts of sanctioning murders and five-hundred-and-fifty-seven counts of assault of various denominations. Supposed offences sanctioned by but not committed by the defendant are to be addressed at a later date.”\n\nAlmost immediately the attention in the room was on the offending party as the absurd list of alleged offences; which as the prosecutor had pointed out, was actually not a comprehensive collection of the crimes which he was likely responsible for. If anything, the list was drastically shorter than it could have been and the jury was already looking dissatisfied. It wasn’t exactly hard to see why.\n\nThe prosecutor went on to list more than a dozen witnesses and experts that were being brought in to prove in no uncertain terms the guilt of the defending yeti. Many of the observing creatures were smiling from ear to ear, knowing already that Ikvus Hailstorm would never see another ray of sunlight so long as he lived. It wasn’t every day that you got to see an unfettered sociopath like him get their just deserts in the proper way and they were more than happy to sit in so that they could watch it all happen.\n\nAs the prosecutor finished listing off the evidence that they were presenting, Ibyz Icepaw leaned back in her seat ever-so-slightly. It had taken some serious willpower not to simply execute him upon his capture, but this was true justice at work. It had been worth the wait."

SLC_post_scw.42.d:0 "The Storm Queen was surveying a set of maps with a finger at her chin, deep in thought. Collectively these charts identified all the different places that Tenzfur Thunderbringer had been spotted in the eastern reaches of the kingdom, but they didn’t offer much in the way of useful information. Beside her Imamu was sipping from a porcelain cup, trying to make head or tail of the scrawled writing from the various scouts and officers that had contributed to this jumble of paper. He wasn’t getting very far with it.\n\n“So how do you plan on catching him?” The zebra asked simply, looking away from his beverage and up at Ibyz instead.\n\nShe sighed and tapped her chin, pondering the very same question. “Simply put, I am not sure. I am not familiar with the vast number of artefacts which we must assume Tenzfur has access to. There are several locations which he frequents, likely for food and other supplies. He does not stay for long at any of them however.”\n\nLooking back at the map, that assessment made sense. Most of the locations at which he had been seen were marked as ‘market’ or ‘bar’ and other similar establishments, the sort of places you’d get a meal or buy basic goods from. Unfortunately there was no pattern, nothing that would give away the location of where the yeti was holed up. Moving soldiers en masse would probably just prompt him to run off somewhere else which was a problem in its own right.\n\n“I see,” Imamu gave out simply, humming as he took a sip from his cup. “And finding him through sheer numbers isn’t an option, is it?”\n\n“No,” She confirmed quickly, “He’s been running for this long, he’ll just keep running. Most likely even further away. Currently our only real chance is catching him at one of the places he’s visited more than once, of which there are six. Even then, stationing guards in and around those establishments will need to be subtle. We may need some soldiers to assume civilian attire and mannerisms. I’m not particularly happy about that.”\n\nNeither was Imamu, but Tenzfur needed to be captured and stopped."

Shouting followed after him as he ran down the thin pathway between two buildings and then swung left, hands balled into fists. The fugitive subsequently ran headfirst into another soldier, this one in proper attire, sending each creature tumbling from the force of the impact.\n\nThe ex-despot recovered faster and scurried as best he could over the cobbled road, running into a bar and charging between a number of tables. The sound of at least a dozen soldiers following him inside a few seconds later was anything but comforting. Having scrambled to the back door through a storage room, the yeti’s heart sunk when he wrenched the knob intently only to discover that the door was locked. It wasn’t long before he was surrounded by military police, soldiers and a couple of storm creatures, each with loaded weapons that were being timidly aimed straight at him.\n\nOne of the more brave policecreatures stepped forwards just a little, “Tenzfur Thunderbringer! You are under arrest for high treason against the Storm Queen! You have a right to remain silent! Anything-”\n\nBefore the poor soul could even finish reciting the words they had all memorised, the entire room and its occupants bar one were engulfed in flames. The criminal’s hood blew off as he charged into and out of the door, letting the spent artefact he had hidden in one of his palms clatter to the ground as he careened out of the building. He could only continue running as fast as his hooves would carry him and pray to those that came before for his survival.\n\nUnfortunately for him, they had been waiting for a mistake like this for some time."

The exhausted deliverer of the message quickly stood up and rushed ahead of her with great haste, guiding her to the main hall of the palace on swift hooves.\n\nAnd a prisoner he certainly seemed at first glance. Tenzfur Thunderbringer had been cuffed, thoroughly bound, dressed in some simple grey clothes and was kneeling on the tiled floor before an officer and two evidently experienced storm creatures.

Local police forces and soldiers,” The officer replied immediately, saluting and standing at attention.\n\n“Acceptable, if unfortunate. At ease,” She replied simply.\n\nShe looked the mage up and down at first, then took one in front of him for a better look. There was a kind of jealous rage in his eyes that she understood immediately, even if she didn’t sympathise. A wretched excuse for a leader indeed.\n\n“Well, you got me,” Tenzfur noted, stifling a cough as he spoke through gritted teeth. “But I feel sorry for you, Ibyz. You’ll never live up to him. No, you wont even come close. Even if you’re twice as brutal you’ll amount to nothing, because you are nothing. A warrior with no vision and no respect. You have smeared your dirty hands on the imperial legacy and those smears will become a stain that rots this kingdom from the inside!” He exclaimed with as much vitriol as he could muster.\n\nThe Storm Queen stood up and turned to the officer with a slight smile,"

Their vows of silence and general unwillingness to participate in typical yeti society in favour of their own isolated and highly religious mountain settlements were still the main factors in that dynamic.\n\nGyz - and her followers by extension - were an anomaly in this metric. They had all descended from the mountains shortly before the outbreak of the civil war, seemingly with the objective of standing against the other factions which were viewed by them and the elite in Karen as dangerously authoritarian. It was for this reason that the storm creature in question had been treated relatively well after her capture in comparison to Tenzfur and Ikvus.\n\nThe Storm Queen sat on the opposite side of the metal table to the creature that was once her enemy with a stony expression on her face. “Why did you not follow in my hoofsteps? What was there to gain by supporting an underdeveloped rural region and the elites in said area’s only large population centre?”\n\nIn response, Gyz signed that a military government was arguably more authoritarian than an oligarchy or the corrupt background governance of a mad mage. The reality was that no faction, Ibyz Icepaw’s included, was truly what she and what her backers were looking for. They wanted change and for their previously overlooked lives to improve. They wanted anything but another absolute ruler.\n\nThat was a fair risk assessment, all things considered. Nevertheless, the implication that she still did not support the current government was concerning at best. The Storm Queen was also having trouble ascertaining whether her captee - inexpressive as ever - was genuine in these remarks.

She had memorised this speech of course, it would have been foolish not to given the significance of today’s broadcast; yet a backup plan was a good idea all the same.\n\nOnce satisfied she offered a thumbs up to an operator behind the sound-proof glass of the studio and received one back. An entire team of yetis went silent as they prepared to broadcast during the day’s afternoon news reel. The Storm Queen returned her gaze back to her notes and the walls of the booth, trying not to focus on the fact that millions were about to hear her speaking live. She waited patiently for the light at her desk to turn green, ignoring the introduction to the news completely until silence fell and the glaring red glow became green.\n\nShe took a slow breath and began to speak, “Creatures of the Storm Kingdom, I have for you all some truly excellent news. The road to peace and stability has been long and hard, even without rest for many. There have been innumerable challenges and immeasurable hurdles which we have surmounted already. Yet, to your dismay and to mine, we have achieved these things only under the watchful eyes of our ever-ready military. They are loyal and I may be amongst their ranks, but a military government is not a government of the average creature.”\n\nAfter another moment to breathe, Ibyz went on. “In the coming weeks, the military will be removing itself from all political positions in the government and its apparatus. Elections for all vacated public offices will be held. The time for executive action - at least through the armed forces - is now over. Thank you all for the trust that you have vested in me and my government. May the ancients smile upon you all and good day.”\n\nAnd with a press of a large button on the panel in front of her, the speech was over.

Needless to say that a closed-doors meeting was soon organised.\n\nDespite technically being an officer of the air force, Ravakh Cloudcracker had served under the army’s jurisdiction since he returned from northern Zebrica. An airship captain by training, he had witnessed first hand the sudden decline of the airship and - after the required training was completed - Ibyz Icepaw had allowed him to command land forces. By all accounts he had served faithfully and though there had been stories of him using bizarre calls to action in the past, nothing major arose at a time when a thorough investigation was convenient. Now would be the time to find out what was going on.\n\n“Your Majesty, I meant no disrespect to your skill and intelligence.” He began, leaning over as they sat in front of one of the palace’s few open fireplaces. “You are a competent leader and ruler, I hold you in the highest of regards; yet like all creatures, I have my own principles.”\n\nThe Storm Queen sat with relative casualness, mentally taking note of his select choice of words and body language. “Marksist principles?”\n\n“To an extent, yes. Of course I lack access to the complete works of Marks in our far corner of the world, but what I have learned already has persuaded me of much. Internationalism, Marksist socialism and a popular revolution if one can be successful.” He went on, either unaware or uncaring of the fact that he had just proclaimed himself to be a supporter of mass dissent against the yeti sitting in front of him.\n\nAs he continued to fail at justifying his ideological position to his liege, Ibyz could only wonder if these ideals were a threat to her rule; eventually raising a finger to interrupt,"

It was rare that she was simultaneously puzzled and at a loss for a course of action, but this was one such case.\n\nOn the one hand, Marksism was a truly irrelevant ideology in the Rainband. Most yetis struggled to enter higher education and most who did were simply happy to take the higher paying jobs to live a good life. There were not a large number of leftist sympathisers amongst the population, those that might have been tempted probably lacked an education and had never heard of socialism or its derivative ideologies. Truly there was no reason to be concerned about whatever ridiculous stunt that captain was trying to pull.\n\nOn the other hand, an ideologue so close to the heart of the armed forces was no small matter. Ravakh Cloudcracker was respected despite his now open secret and should something truly catastrophic happen to the current government he would have every opportunity to expand his influence. He might have been respectful, but behind those eyes Ibyz recognised a deep-seated dedication to a passion that was unrelated to his equally beloved airships. On top of that, it was fair to assume from his confidence that he did have allies. They were likely members of his crew and his directly subordinate officers who, whilst small in number and lacking influence, still represented a threat to the administration and to her.\n\nHer Majesty leaned back into the cushioned sofa with a sigh.\n\nShe did not enjoy having to investigate fellow officers and Ravakh’s reports indicated no foul play. Hours had been spent pouring over them and everything was in order, he was as loyal as a diamond dog to the griffonian emperors. Even so, every aching bone in her body seemed to say that not investigating further was a poor decision; which was a position that her experience corroborated.

We differ on trivial things like how to organise the government and the military after the revolution inevitably takes place, but until then we are aligned. After that... well, it gets more difficult.”\n\nThe use of the term ‘inevitably’ in that response certainly made the otherwise humorous statement quite uncomfortable. He lifted the paperwork and scribbled some notes before looking up at the smiling interviewee and raising an eyebrow. They obviously weren’t afraid to talk about what they believed in, that much was quite clear. Whether that confidence was well placed or naive he couldn’t say for sure. Not yet at least.\n\n“Thank you. Now,” He went on, tapping his paper a few times as he tried to refocus. “In the event of a violent internal conflict, would you side with a force in opposition to the Storm Queen or a force in support?”\n\n“That depends entirely on the nature of the opposing force.” She answered quickly, folding her arms and continuing to grin seemingly without care.\n\nAn answer that seemed harmless at a surface level for the most part, if it weren't for the surrounding context. Again he looked down at his notes and underlined a part that read ‘KEEP AN EYE ON!’ in purposefully large letters. This was not a loyal servant of the crown by any means, not even by Ibyz Icepaw’s relatively relaxed standards when it came to political opinions in the military.\n\nLooking up again for the final time, the reviewer nodded slowly. “Alright, that’s all I need from you today.

The Storm Queen has graciously allowed you to remain there and I would ask that you do not abuse her trust, or her patience. Are we clear?”\n\nThe officer simply nodded and smiled as they got up to leave."

No doubt he would move to a different spot the next time Imamu tried to visit and he’d have to call in all sorts of favours just to pick him out of the haystack that was the Zwahile. At the very least his father refused to come close to population centres, which was something that he could use as a starting point. Every time he moved he got slightly harder to find.\n\nThe zebra carefully stepped over a litany of branches and started looking around the porch for traps. He wasn’t expecting any, but Sadiki wasn’t getting any less paranoid and Ibyz had been thoughtful enough - or perhaps unaware enough - to mention how easy some explosive traps were to make. After a few minutes of searching however, nothing besides grass and strewn wooden planks from the hastily constructed shack met his hooves.\n\nHe slowly approached the door of the hovel and froze for several seconds before gently knocking, knowing he at least had to try. “Dad? Are you in there?”\n\nAlmost immediately he heard a long string of ‘bangs’ and ‘crashes’ followed by a yelp of frustration. Only after a minute or so did the slow shuffling of hooves approach the door, which he could only assume by the reaction were his father’s. Still kicking, it seemed.\n\n“I have a radio now, you know.” Sadiki gave out in the gravelly voice of someone long past their prime, easily audible through the shoddily constructed door. “I’ve heard about what they’ve decided to do in Hyenia. I know what you’re giving your support for. Why do you insist on these pointless trips to the middle of nowhere just to remind me that your mother died for nothing!”\n\nImamu winced and looked down at dirt, doing his best to hold any semblance of composure. “I’m just looking out for you, because I know you don’t look after yourself. Azali would want us to stay in touch at least. You know that.”\n\n“Don’t say her name.” The old zebra snarled back, his tired voice dripping with malice. “Get out of here, maybe you’ll soon meet a hyena who will help you polish those yeti boots.”\n\nHis son obliged and stepped back from door, using a hoof to wipe his eyes as he took deep breath after deep breath."

SLC_post_scw.51.d:0 "Ibyz Icepaw was standing outside the door of a flat in the Eye of the Storm, leaning against a wall and staring into space. Her father, Kazher Stormpaw was most likely sitting idly somewhere inside; possibly with some herbal tea. His fancy for it was where she’d found her love of the stuff and soon after her passion for cooking as well. Unfortunately, to say that those days were long gone would be an understatement.\n\nSlowly but surely the Storm Queen tore herself from the plastered wall and stepped towards the door of the apartment, giving it a slow but fairly loud knock. “It’s me, father. I hope you are well.”\n\nSilence, of course. Her voice was perfectly audible and she knew that he could hear her through the thin plasterboard and brick. These days he simply didn’t speak to her, or to anyone she had tried sending in her stead for almost a decade. That alone made the quiet of the afternoon all the more unbearable for her as she waited in the vain hope of a response.\n\nEventually, Ibyz decided to speak again. “The kingdom is doing well, for the most part. Its issues are... manageable. I am sorry that the stability and prosperity that I have brought to our people and others is not enough to redeem me in your eyes. I hope you have at least been outside to enjoy the relative calm of the streets. It’s nicer than it used to be, I think.”\n\nAll she could hear from inside was a slight shuffle of clothes against some kind of fabric, probably a chair or a chaise long if he’d treated himself with some of the money that she was using to pay for this place out of her military wages. She still remembered how difficult he had been about moving here despite the risk of him being thrown out into the streets. At the time she had just joined the armed forces for a half decent salary and because the alternative was most likely death. Sometimes the Storm Queen wondered if Kazher would have preferred that outcome.\n\n“There isn’t much else to speak of that I should freely discuss.” She added, finality in her tone as she put her hand solemnly on the door. “I’ve ordered some of that special herbal tea that you like. Or at least, that I hope you still like. It’ll be coming in a few days. I hope I’ll see or speak to you soon, father.”\n\nIt took her a moment to remove her hand from the dust-coated door and start walking back down the empty stairwell."

SLC_uzerasi_revolt.1.d:0 "The occasional strike in the city of Mzizima was nothing new. Every so often the city’s industries would go quiet, usually only for a few days before a few creatures’ paychecks were enlarged or the protests became more trouble than they were worth for the average zebra or yeti. In either case, the already minor problem just sorted itself out after a while with little to no intervention on the part of the government.\n\nThis time however, things were very different.\n\nAt first it seemed much like any other workers’ strike as many zebras left their workplaces and took to the streets chanting various slogans. Authorities were informed and some military police were dispatched, but few expected any violence.\n\nWhen pink flags and portraits of the late Azali - the last ruler of an independent Uzerasi kingdom and Imamu’s mother - began to appear amongst the slogans demanding better wages, it became clear that this was no ordinary march. More and more zebras have since joined the protests and it has escalated to the point that the regional governor is relocating military police from other areas in an attempt to keep things under control.\n\nMultiple accounts of violence instigated both by the stationed yetis and by the protestors have been reported as the peaceful march is gradually turning into a widespread riot. Yeti-operated businesses and government buildings have expectedly been the main recipients of ire and property damage alike.\n\nIt is impossible to tell whether the event was organised or spontaneous, though it seems most likely that it was a combination of both; a wage protest co-opted by Zwahile anti-state elements. More importantly, the Mzizima riots have not shown any signs of losing steam as violence has only escalated with more troops pouring in every day. Something has to give."

SLC_uzerasi_revolt.2.d:0 "Imamu somewhat sheepishly stepped up to the table in the Storm Queen’s study, inspecting the litany of reports and hastily drafted maps which themselves contained endless scribbles. Ibyz Icepaw herself was standing a little ways away, pouring over another docket of information that was most likely from the MID. Even they had been having trouble with the loyalty of some of their agents after the riots.\n\nMoving a few documents to the side to get a better look at the maps sitting underneath, the zebra could immediately see that the city of Mzizima was considered out of control. He struggled to make out most of the pen marks for all of the crossings out and additional notes, but saw quite clearly that the armed forces had taken a step back from the city. That was good news, albeit quite surprising; Her Majesty had not been very averse to the use of overwhelming force up until this point.\n\nLooking over and up to the yeti by the window, Imamu cleared his throat. “This looks... Bad. I uh... Why haven’t you sent in the military to deal with the rebels yet?”\n\n“Why have the rebels chosen you as a figurehead?” She returned pointedly, causing her guest to uncomfortably shuffle back from the table and lift a hoof as she looked up from the intelligence report. “I have not sent in the military because an entire city up in arms is not the same as sporadic resistance activity. There would be no coming back from that kind of open and absolute tyranny. I hope to negotiate with the leadership or eliminate the rebels wholesale once all the creatures unwilling to fight have returned home. You are hoping for the former. In fact, I suspect I will most likely be negotiating with you when the time comes.”\n\nThe zebra stood stock still, terrified sweat on his face and resolve behind his eyes. “Most likely, yes. I was hoping that it would never come to this, but if I must choose between your ever-more oppressive rule or the safety and security of my people then I will choose the latter.”\n\nFor a few seemingly endless seconds the yeti closed her eyes, finally letting out a deep breath. “Then go to your kin. I have not yet decided how I wish to handle this situation, but I would not deprive a friend of their family.”\n\nImamu stared at the Ibyz for a moment; equal parts grateful, incredulous and deeply concerned. After what felt like only another few seconds he was galloping through the hallways of the palace, towards the nearest exit."

SLC_uzerasi_revolt.3.d:0 "“Alright! Everyone grab a rifle!” The zebra shouted over the hustle and bustle of the establishment.\n\nAlmost immediately about twenty creatures were lined up in front of the bar, patiently awaiting their weapons. Each one had a slightly different accent and they all spoke over one another as the loudest amongst them passed them the guns that they had been training with for the past few months. Yeti rifles were a challenge to use for most of them, but the effectiveness of the weapons wasn’t nearly as important as the presence of them was.\n\nThe last zebra in the queue for a gun was one of the youngest, the group’s newest member. “Morning Akiba! Coming out to join us today?”\n\n“I’d be a fool not to Fahari,” He replied quickly, hoofing over a large revolver and about ten rounds. “Are you sure you can handle the recoil on this? These yeti hand cannons are no joke.”\n\nShe giggled a little and started loading it as the old stallion behind the bar reached for his father’s hunting rifle below the counter, “Oh I’ll be fine. Worst case scenario I give it to one of you guys, but I’ve done plenty of practice. I’m good.”\n\nLoading the thing was a chore in and of itself, especially with hooves. They’d tried to grab some speed-loaders for the revolvers that they’d taken off of some members of the military police but to no avail. Fortunately the things were so big that one shot out of six would probably be more than enough, save maybe if you were faced with a storm creature. That being said, they were pretty unlikely to see any of those out here in the middle of nowhere.\n\nClosing the bolt on his rifle, Akiba bashed his hoof on the bar’s counter to get everyone’s attention. “Okay! I know we’ve got all sorts here, but I don’t want any arguments when we’re out on the streets! We’re not harmonists, monarchists, republicans or whatever crackpot ideology you personally subscribe to; we’re against the yetis! We’re gonna go out there, get the police to disarm themselves alongside whoever else has made their way into the streets and then report back to the Uzerasi! Are we ready?!”\n\nA cheer rang out through the pub as they haphazardly made their way out of the front door."

SLC_uzerasi_revolt.4.d:0 "Early in the morning hundreds of protestors, rebels and rioters alike barged into the Storm Queen’s old base of operations in the Zwahile.\n\nMnozi - or the Icepaw Hold as it had been known for some years - was essentially a moderately sized town inside of an extensive mountain fortification. Originally it had been built by the Mazwi and Ibyz Icepaw had subsequently found and expanded upon the defensive structures soon after her governorship began.\n\nIn recent times the town had largely been left to its own devices. The infrastructure was broadly excellent as a result of its absolute importance in organising supplies during the civil war, but the garrison there was small and the creatures were angry. Her Majesty had not seen fit to reinforce it once her base of power had moved to the Eye of the Storm and so the yeti contingent there remained lacking in numbers and overall strength.\n\nWhen the telegrams arrived It came as no surprise to the Storm Queen or the Uzerasi that the defences fell with such ease. In fact, it was very much expected. The majority of soldiers were sympathetic to the cause of the creatures they had spent so much time surrounded by and many of the local collaborators had taken great pains to quietly return to their kin. There was no will to fight amongst the town’s ‘defenders’.\n\nThe few who refused to surrender were dispatched by angry townsfolk wielding weapons that the rest of the yetis had given up to them. Banners depicting the once ever-present Ibyz Icepaw were torn down or burned on great bonfires. What remained of the armoury was thoroughly searched and looted for some yeti pattern weaponry and a few thousand rounds for them. Not a grand victory, but a victory nonetheless.\n\nSoon enough the calmest of the zebras that had joined up with the largely peaceful uprising returned to their homes, turning in for the night. There were however an equal number that left the town with those that had come to save them, travelling in the direction of Mzizima to join the coming fight that they all saw soon to unfold. If and when it did, they knew it wouldn’t be as easy as this."

Imamu wasn’t used to immediate eye contact from his old friend, but held his own just fine as he tapped his hooves on the table. They both felt as though their entourages of soldiers and nobles respectively were mere moments away from tearing each other to pieces, which was a fairly accurate assessment.\n\nThe central zebra turned around a prepared set of documents and pushed them across the table, focused like the brightest of sunlights through a dirtied lens. “In short, three things. Firstly, the oppressive ‘reforms’ that have been implemented since the unification will be retracted or heavily modified at an absolute minimum. Secondly, a true method of checking the power of yeti institutions will need to be established; we suggest a diarchy in which my family is directly subordinate to me, marking the establishment of a commonwealth of two absolute monarchies with perfectly matched authority in one government. Finally, for the trials and tribulations that the Uzerasi family has endured, the rights and privileges of my noble house will be restored with few exceptions.”\n\nAs the final demand was made, the Storm Queen noticed a slight twinge of what must have been a rapidly hidden grimace on Imamu’s snout. Clearly he was aware that allowing his noble allies to regain such influence would have severe consequences in the future, but he wasn’t in a position to argue with his wealthiest and most powerful supporters. She took the weighty docket of demands and began leafing through it, although not with much purpose save for making time to think. No doubt Imamu’s work would have been spotless after working with her for so many years.\n\n“And,” The zebra added over the suddenly deafening silence, “If you decline, you will be allowed to leave. We will declare an independent Uzerasi Kingdom an hour after you depart on all local radio stations. We will be at war.”\n\nIbyz looked up from the papers at the small kindness and tensed all over, listening to the sound of a grandfather clock and one of the nobles taking a puff of a cigar.

SLC_uzerasi_revolt.6.d:0 "Small sailing ships were not the best vessels with which to transport soldiers, but it’s what the Uzerasi had on hoof. It took no small effort to ignore the fact that many members of that family were still apparently quite well off in spite of their apparent resistance to yeti rule, although that knowledge was nothing new. In any case, the family was evidently prepared to share in its prosperity if they were willing to share their private yachts for the furthering of this rebellion.\n\nIt was this thought that many of the soldiers shared as they ran the expensive vehicle aground on the other side of Buckonny Bay, night creeping in around them. The noise of the wood grinding against the gravel and sand of the beach alone was enough to make many wince and the sound of splintering wood as the ship came to a final stop was even worse. No doubt whoever had donated this vessel would have a substantial repair bill on their hooves, if they ever got it back.\n\n“Everyone disembark! Get into the forest and start setting up camp!” Came the order from one of the zebras in charge.\n\nThe chain of command was a mess, as always; nobody needed to be told to get off the now thoroughly unusable ship and get out of sight. They were all ready for a fight, but this was truly in the middle of nowhere and it was very unlikely that any yetis were patrolling Ijebi given the unrest and the few reasons to counteract it in such a backwater as this.\n\nOf course that made it all the more surprising when a selection of lights were seen approaching from the south. Zebras rushed all over to quickly get into cover in the hopes that the fighting would at least be quick.\n\n“Is that one of the boats?” One of the figures gave out quietly, their visage obscured by the light of the lamp against the darkness. “Who am I kidding, it’s too small for the yetis. Where are they then? We were supposed to meet with these guys.”\n\nSlowly but surely the zebras that had just arrived made themselves known, cautiously rising out of their assorted hiding spots for fear of a yeti trap. There was no ruse however and it only took a few minutes for them to put the poorly organised pieces together. It seemed this region would stand with the Uzerasi when the time came, for better or for worse."

It indicates that they are preparing or are already prepared to join the Uzerasi in their resistance efforts.”\n\nHeaving herself away from an overflowing desk she walked slowly towards the origin of the noise, only just recovering from a trip on a coffee table. She’d forgotten just how late at night it already was and could barely see past about three metres from the candlelight at her workspace. Fortunately there was a dim glow emanating from the door to her quarters that was a fine guide for the rest of the short and haphazard walk.\n\n“Please provide the communication,” Ibyz demanded simply, rubbing one of her eyes with the back of a hand. “Then you are dismissed.”\n\nThe soldier obliged, saluted and turned immediately to leave; leaving Her Majesty with the paper in question in one hand as she returned the salute with the other. Slowly but surely she took a seat by the cold fireplace and lit another couple of candles, hoping to at least enjoy some comfort as she prepared to read a no doubt mildly destressing letter.\n\n‘THIS IS TELEGRAM THREE OF EIGHT STOP IF OTHERS UNRECEIVED ASSUME INTERCEPTED STOP UPPER HAYZEBLAND YEARNS FOR FREEDOM AND ITS KIN STOP WE WILL JOIN THE UZERASI WHEN THE TIME COMES STOP MAY THE NIGHT BE SILENT AND THE SUNRISE BRIGHT STOP’\n\nWith a groan the Storm Queen brought a hand to her face and slowly dragged it over her hardened skin, letting the telegram fall to the table as she leaned back into the furniture. To some extent she was unsurprised by this turn of events, but it was nevertheless frustrating; they would surely see sense like the rest when negotiations began. If they began at all, of course.\n\nAfter a few moments she carefully walked back to her desk, rummaged around for a fountain pen and put another bullet point on her ever-growing to-do list. “Extend... defensive preparations... further north.”"

No doubt he would have meticulously planned his escape route months in advance, possibly even as early as his original hiring. It had been a mistake not to keep a closer eye on him at this critical juncture, but with resources spread so thin already it was hardly a shock.\n\nA few notes from the MID indicated that he would likely be serving the other side on the field of battle in the near future, which was a true blow. Losing a disloyal general was not so much of a problem as the very officer serving the opposition was. Jahi, although politically connected and somewhat risk averse, was no slouch in the fields of planning and organisation as a whole. Divisions under his command would be a problem.\n\nWalking through to her personal kitchen, the Storm Queen reached for a pencil and paper on which she began scribbling notes. First and foremost, the agents assigned to keep track of him should be reprimanded for their carelessness and then reassigned to some other kind of counter-insurgency operation. More importantly, they would need to consider filling the newly opened position in the general staff with a new officer. She would need to spend a number of hours vetting them herself this time.\n\nThe yeti reached for the phone on the countertop and dialled in for the switchboard, “Sea Blue Hill Fort, go for: mother industrial district.”\n\nWhere normally an operator would have directed a creature’s call to a receiver, the line was transferred almost instantaneously. “What have you need of, Your Majesty?”\n\n“Report on Jahi, next steps and operative assignments.” She said simply with a sigh, pained to hear the voice of the MID’s director for the fourth time that day."

She hadn’t turned up for that morning’s general staff meeting with no notice and her residency happened to be close by. Most suspected foul play, but Ibyz knew better.\n\nAs the storm creatures readied their rifles and the officers that had followed drew their revolvers, Her Majesty simply approached the door and confidently tried the knob. Locked, but nothing else of note; certainly no traps. The officers shared glances as their ruler took a step back before kicking at the hinges of the door, wrenching the wood out of the frame with a horrible ‘crack’.\n\nWithout waiting for the dust to settle, she simply entered the room and took a look around as her entourage filed in to clear it. There was nothing to clear of course, the place had been vacated at some point in the last week or so; most likely very soon after the staff’s prior assembly. The previously prepared weapons were sheathed and holstered as yetis and their creature kin began searching the apartment for anything of importance.\n\nIt wasn’t until an officer went into the bedroom that it dawned on the rest as it had on her, “Your Majesty, there’s a note here. I... I can’t read it, come take a look; could be the old tongue.”\n\nIbyz obliged and followed suit, followed closely by a suddenly very curious storm creature as she carefully took the note from her subordinate. She was admittedly still in the process of becoming fluent in the old tongue as her role demanded and Nor’s handwriting was horrible at the best of times, but it was still immediately recognisable as the written language of the storm creatures.\n\nShe squinted slightly and read it a few times over before reading it out, “So that would be... ‘To my friends and my Queen, I wish to apologise. I have chosen my heart and soul over my kind. I cannot abandon my husband, nor his king.’”\n\nAfter another read to be sure, she immediately handed the note to the seemingly inquisitive creature which then proceeded to tear the paper completely to shreds.

Artillery shells had pockmarked the streets and shattered the roofs and walls of several largely stone buildings, which was to say nothing of the damage sustained by the hold itself.\n\nUnlike the battle for the capital where defensive infrastructure was valuable, there was no good reason to spare the fortifications here. The walls of the mountain fort behind the large village had been all but levelled by sundering artillery fire, only sparing the zebras inside for an hour or two before highly trained creatures were sent inside to clear out the remains of the fortification. The frightened farmers and militiacreatures that made up the new garrison did not last long.\n\nThose who did not surrender were hung by the neck from lampposts and houses by the overzealous soldiery, many of whom had once operated out of this very town. [SLC.GetLeader] turned a blind eye to this admittedly unsavoury practice in favour of organising the next steps for the units that had fought there, making sure that any pink flags were torn down and replaced where possible.\n\nWhen all was said and done the little mountain settlement felt like a ghost town despite the fact that most of the residents remained. They had nowhere to go as the main assault had cut off the only reliable route of escape down the mountain but thankfully had been spared any direct form of reprisals, provided they had not assisted the defenders of course.\n\nTo say they were unscathed however would be a barefaced lie. They had all watched the yetis burn the flags of their failing liberators in the streets, they were all looking at the lifeless bodies with broken bones swaying slowly from side to side in the streets and they were all wondering how they would cope with the damage to their livelihoods and homes.\n\nWhat was there to do besides vainly hope that the yetis would help them rebuild later?"

The creature in question was evidently of a noble birth just by her manner of speaking, but her pink and purple attire instantly gave away her Uzerasi heritage.\n\nThe scene quickly drew a small crowd of workers at the plant and random creatures from the street that happened to be travelling past at the time. Not many were surprised that the Uzerasi were finally having their assets seized; if not for the failed rebellion that had recently been crushed, then for the fact that expropriations had been announced only a few days ago. Evidently she’d falsely considered herself above suspicion.\n\nHaving been taken outside the front gates of the industrial estate, the zebra was finally let down. “So that’s it then? You think you can get away with taking everything from us? Isn’t what you’ve got already enough for you sorry excuses for sapience?!”\n\n“Yeah, I think we can.” The calmer of the two soldiers gave out, confidently surveying the crowd that had taken a few steps back from the wrathful noble. “You know what we do to traitors.”\n\nThe fire in their cyan eyes caused the noble to stutter repeatedly, looking around at their kin who were suddenly much less interested in what was going on. “Y-you... You’ll pay f-for this...”\n\n“Not as much as you will,” The more fearsome soldier snarled out through gritted teeth, “Get going before we feel the urge to dispossess your body of your head as well.”\n\nThat was all it took for the noble to scamper off into the crowd, tail between her legs.

She wasn’t the most social of creatures - knowing this was part of the reason why she had not wanted the throne for herself at first - and yet here she was preparing for a parade with hundreds of thousands of attendees. Fortunately there would be no speeches today, which was a small mercy for the sheer volume of the public that she would no doubt be enduring for a number of hours.\n\n“Your majesty!” A servant suddenly cried as stumbled breathlessly through her chamber door, interrupting the concentration of the Storm Queen’s attendees as they prepared her dress uniform. “My... apologies for the... For the rush, I... have excellent news!”\n\nWhen the maid fitting the medals on her uniform nodded, the Storm Queen turned around with a barely raised eyebrow. “Your rashness is forgiven. Speak.”\n\nThe yeti raised a finger to beg for a moment or two to catch his breath; after which he stood up straight, pulled a docket from one of the pouches on his uniform and approached his liege with it in hand. “Your majesty, the traitorous Imamu has been killed. Shot and killed in a backwater Zwahile village along with a number of other unimportant rebels. There’s a unit of storm creatures waiting to know what you would like to be done with the body.”\n\nHer hand froze around the thick card of the document case the moment her friend’s name was mentioned. She had barely had the time to think about his whereabouts once she had left that fateful meeting, only seeing him in newspapers or in the occasional stress-induced nightmare. The fact that he would eventually perish at some point in this conflict was a fact Ibyz Icepaw had been trying not to think about for quite some time.\n\nThe shock of the news was clearly evident in her expression as both the maid and the messenger took a step back as the latter made gently to speak. “Y-Your Majesty? You’re... You’re, uh...”\n\nThe Storm Queen slowly lifted her free hand to her eyes as the other dropped to her side, nails now embedded in the docket. She rubbed the dampness away from her eyes and corrected a slowly deepening hunch, eventually clearing her throat with an-ever stony expression of solemnity.\n\n“Thank you for this report,” She began, doing her best to keep her composure with a pause."

The leader of the Uzerasi and their pitiful reactionary rebellion was dead and so they were finally victorious. The fact that he would eventually perish at some point in this conflict was generally accepted by his military staff, but it had been difficult to predict when he would finally be caught and dealt with.\n\nThe shock of the news soon washed away as he tucked the docket into one of his pockets and smiled widely at the messenger. “What should I tell them sir?”\n\nRavakh thought to himself for a moment about what should be done. Traitors and reactionaries did not deserve peace, but those with the spirit and the will to fight for what they believe deserve some kind of respect.

Both she and the zebra calmly sitting on the other side of the truck in hoofcuffs knew what was going to happen to them once they reached the capital. More than likely they would be ‘brought to justice’ on live television, gruesome as it may have seemed.\n\n“It is far too late to struggle now, my friend.” Jahi gave out with a sigh, eyes fixed on Nor Blackice’s immense hands failing to break out of layers upon layers of rope. “We dug this grave for them, but they are pushing us into it.”\n\nSome of the soldiers accompanying them scoffed at the idea that they could have been beaten by mere peasants and nobles, which prompted a slight roll of the eyes from the zebra. After a few more minutes of struggling with the bindings, the storm creature finally relented and leaned back against the metal canvas cover supports. She closed her eyes and simply growled, which was enough to wipe the smirks off of the faces of some greener guards.\n\nJahi sighed and nodded, focused on the occasionally blinking cyan eyes just a couple of metres away. “This is it, I’m afraid.”\n\nThe storm creature lifted her hands part way up and attempted to express some level of fear for her husband’s wellbeing, albeit sloppily thanks to the makeshift handcuffs. It got the message across clearly enough and the zebra solemnly looked at the wooden floor of the truck.\n\n“He’ll most likely see or hear about what happens to you,” He responded simply, “I imagine the news will be... difficult to bear. Nevertheless, he will take solace in the fact that you have fought and died for his safety. That is no small sacrifice to be wasted.”\n\nNor simply stared at her companion as the surface of the road changed from largely dirt to largely paved, impossible to read as her kind always were.\n\nWith a muted smile, Jahi looked out the back of the truck and sighed. “Can’t be more than a few hours away now.”"

Putting any kind of uncertainty to bed was in and of itself a bureaucratic and propaganda victory by all accounts. Indeed, the renaming and redrawing of administrative regions was indicative of a newfound authority over the region as a whole that had never previously existed; that alone would have been worthy of praise for any leader.\n\nThat was where the pride of the decree ended and the reality of it began for [SLC.GetLeader] as the tragedy of what had been lost in the revolt became clearer by the day. On top of the simple devastation of the conflict, the loss of expertise and wealth that came with the rebellion and the subsequent disloyalty of the Uzerasi family was being felt heavily all over the region. Although the authority of the government could now be easily enforced, true loyalty from zebras there was hard to come by and many still protested or passively resisted the military whenever they had the chance.\n\nEach problem individually was surmountable and efforts were already being made to repair interracial relations as well as rebuild many settlements, but only time would fully heal the wounds of revolt. Only time would satisfy the restless souls of those who died fighting creatures that once they called kin. It was the simple nature of things.\n\nAs [SLC.GetLeader]’s hand followed the details of the paper downward one last time, the pen in their hand shook slightly. The occasion was momentous and saddening, but the effect of this document’s signing would be the reward of many hours of lost sleep and many more lives lost in service. For better or for worse, they had earned this final victory over the Zwahile and its treachery.\n\nWith pen to paper and a signature in the blocky capital letters of an officer too used to their own illegible handwriting, the decree was signed into law."

She’d read it already, tens or possibly hundreds of times up until this point; each time finding it more difficult to process the reality that her only true friend was now buried beneath her.\n\nSlowly but surely the yeti kneeled down on the thick grass of the suburban Mzizima graveyard, tearing her gaze from the stone and forcing herself to look at the recently shifted soil. “Hello Imamu.”\n\nAlready hunched over, Ibyz timidly lowered a hand to the grassless soil and rested a little of her weight against the dirt which sat atop the coffin that she had insisted on paying for. That and the choice location near a supposed childhood home of his was the least she could have done for him after all those years, yet it wasn’t nearly enough. Her calloused fingers were already shaking, almost as though they had never gripped a weapon.\n\n“I... I’m... sorry.” The Storm Queen began, voice quietened by restrained sobbing. “I have seen to each request within your will and... And now I...

I’m not sure what I can or... or should do, even.”\n\nA small part of her wanted to say that she had seriously considered accepting his offer, yet a much larger part reminded her of the consequences of the decision she had already made. It was far too late to try and justify that choice now and far too unkind to do it before a condemned soul that could only listen to its executioner. In her mind, she made a promise to be better; one which she was immediately unsure if she could keep.\n\nWith one hand keeping the dampness in her eyes from accumulating, Ibyz rose slowly from her position of quiet respect without answers; staring once again at the inscription on the tombstone as she prepared herself for the longest afternoon of her life.

SLC_uzerasi_revolt.17.d:0 "It was barely noticeable at first. A few more damaged guns than usual, some more soldiers deserting and usually punctual generals being just a few minutes later than they should have been. These sorts of things had been going on ever since the beginning of the Uzerasi insurrection and most had dismissed them as a symptom of declining national stability first and foremost.\n\nTo Ibyz Icepaw's logistically omniscient eyes however, there was an obvious pattern emerging. There was no randomness in the equipment numbers or the desertion rates, nor was there randomness to the times at which meetings were interrupted by late arrivals. Very specific officers and very specific depots were causing these issues and at regular intervals. By all accounts it seemed as though they too were planning for some kind of revolt, or more likely a coup.\n\nThis knowledge was made all the worse as the MID began to draw and report connections between particular officers and the ROMM, the movement belonging to one Ravakh Cloudcracker. Although he had been diligent enough not to overplay his hand, he too had been making excuses to explain odd disappearances from time to time. His place in this budding conspiracy was all but assured.\n\nAll that was left now was for the Storm Queen to establish just how deep this plot went and where precisely pressure needed to be put in order to slow their presumably growing numbers. Once the Uzerasi were dealt with these traitors could be focused on and destroyed, but for now a balancing act was necessary in order to maintain an air of stability both in the armed forces and the country as a whole.\n\nOnce satisfied with her deductions, Ibyz immediately began drafting another batch of orders for the MID to keep a close eye on the individuals they’d already identified. There would be nothing less than complete notice for whatever stunt these would-be marksists might attempt.\n\nRavakh would pay for this treachery soon enough."

SLC_uzerasi_revolt.18.d:0 "Not long after her new orders had been passed into the trusted hands of the MID, a hurried phone call was placed to the Storm Queen from the very same agency.\n\nThanks in no small part to Her Majesty’s foresight and the initial investigation of the Red Officers’ Marksist Movement during its formation, they have already begun keeping tags on many of the more influential members of the organisation. Ravakh himself, although impossible to remove outright, had not been absolutely quiet in his efforts and many of his subordinates were being watched at every waking moment.\n\nThis advantage would no doubt be invaluable in the coming months of the rebellion as it would allow them to remove many of the less careful officers in the armed forces that could be tried for treason without much risk. This on top of the knowledge of where those missing weapons were being stored in some cases would make a considerable difference in efforts to slow preparations for what they were now sure was a coup.\n\nOf course the work of these deplorable anti-monarchists would continue all the same given that resources were stretched so thin. Every officer not at the front was both a tool and a risk that would now have to be redeployed even more frequently in order to prevent low-level officers amongst the ranks of the ROMM putting together new caches for the chaos that was shortly coming.\n\nAll in all this was excellent news for the kingdom, although it wouldn’t mean much if the western revolt could not be put down in short order. Even the most meticulous preparation would not save the kingdom if its most immediate enemies could not be dealt with in good time.\n\nAt least this time the Storm Queen did not immediately need to compose more orders."

In times like these, alone in your bunk in whatever shack the engineers had prepared a few weeks ago, the only thing of interest you might have was a portable radio. Luckily for Izyka, said radio was turning out to be really quite interesting; in no small part thanks to one of Ravakh Cloudcracker’s subordinates.\n\nThe ROMM had recently begun running a small but well-listened pirate radio station under the nose of the Storm Queen and the MID, both of whom were yet to pick up on this novel form of word-spreading. Of course, it was wholly inflammatory. This deluge veteran made no effort to appear conciliatory before her liege and she made as many valid points about the current stability of the realm as he did outlandish claims of internationalism. No doubt this wavelength would host little more than static within a month or two, but there was a respectable element of bravery in such a brazen act of organised sedition.\n\nIt was also quite well thought out as far as keeping their leader safe was concerned. Although it was obviously their doing, the Red Officers’ Marksist Movement made no public effort to claim the station as theirs and the host - one Verk Surgeswell - was evidently ready to die if it meant spreading the message.\n\nIzyka sighed and leaned back in the wooden chair of his very temporary office, wondering to himself whether the fiery yeti on the radio had a point. It was true that most of them had been promised leave once the civil war was over and that many had been re-conscripted to fight against the western revolt; but by all accounts life had been slowly improving nonetheless. It was difficult to argue with the Storm Queen’s results, even though he did indeed sympathise with the plight of the Uzerasi. After all, he and many others had fought alongside those zebras during the civil war; the bonds they’d forged there were no small matter. That being said, Ravakh likely wouldn’t be any kinder to those poor creatures.\n\nHaving stared at the ceiling for some time, the officer decided..."

One private was lying in his bunk, using the last of his cigarettes in the corner of the dorm to illuminate a ROMM pamphlet that he’d been handed at some stage in the journey back behind the lines. He didn’t remember the face of the creature that gave it to him, but he was certainly glad that they had. It was hard to be hopeful for progress and change when you were actively fighting the creatures that had supposedly helped with many reforms.\n\nHe had barely read over the front page when he took the first drag of the cigarette and looked up, only to have his gaze met by the piercing eyes and overwhelming silence of his commanding officer. The sight of the storm creature alone would have been enough to make anyone’s blood freeze at this time of night. As it reached for the pamphlet in his hands, he simply stared and let the battered card be taken from his hands.\n\nIt was impossible to tell what those things were thinking most of the time, but this kind of behaviour was unusual. Typically any single storm creature - and this one especially, in the soldier’s experience - was more than happy to punish insubordination in the ranks. No doubt it had simply never seen these kinds of pamphlets before and would surely punish him for reading it, once it had satiated its curiosity.\n\nThe creature’s head cocked slightly as it turned the paper over, its quiet but now audible breathing betraying at least some kind of emotion. Only after another twenty painful seconds of near-silence did its mask rise to look down at its subordinate with an incomprehensible gaze. The soldier was still lying there, believing that punishment was imminent with an unhidden shiver at the stature of his commanding officer.\n\nIts gaze remained entirely steady as it folded the pamphlet down and tucked it away in one of many pockets, once again without producing so much as a sound.

It was no surprise to anyone that things would get hairy, although the violence was at least quite minimal for the moment. At least in the capital, anyway.\n\nPalace guards are known for their fortitude both physical and mental and so from time to time when things were thrown at them during such protests, most would simply shrug it off. Even rocks and other actually dangerous projectiles typically resulted in little save for dented armour and an arrest, or indeed several arrests. It came as quite a surprise to them when - having seen several such demonstrations within the last few months alone - some of the protestors began throwing red fabrics. Of course they did no harm with such mediocre weapons, but it was a somewhat concerning change nonetheless.\n\nThe vast majority of these fabrics were burned of course. All of these soldiers were privy to the knowledge of who was likely supplying the protestors, although with the current bureaucratic mess it was impossible to confirm their suspicions beyond reasonable doubt. The servants in the palace itself that were responsible for the rapid disposal of the fabric were also knowledgeable in this field, albeit mostly through hearsay.\n\nOne such servant was currently sitting by a newly raging bonfire in the gardens of the palace, wrapping and unwrapping a long red shawl around her fingers. She had watched as the zebras were promised everything and then betrayed when it mattered most. She was already seeing her friends and family worry about whether they’d be betrayed next because they’d done business with the Uzerasi in those years. It wasn’t right. None of it was right.\n\nShe continued playing with the fabric in her hands, starting into the fire for longer than was healthy for her eyes. A large part of her didn’t want to burn them at all, knowing who had sent them. Maybe the ROMM was the kingdom’s last real chance at fair and just rule, even if they didn’t want a kingdom.\n\nEventually the servant quietly whispered to herself,"

Even if she could have after an evening like that, the Storm Queen probably wouldn’t have wanted to. The negotiations had been both exhaustive and exhausting, largely due to the rowdiness and the quantity of the attendees on both sides. She had occasionally been able to steal a glance at Imamu who seemed to have been struggling even more so under the pressure as they had been drafting, redrafting and finally writing up specific terms of their new arrangement. He’d been running off of sheer willpower and what she could only assume was contempt for the choices that had led them both to that meeting.\n\nAll she could do was sigh and bury her face in her worn-out hands, wondering whether this was the right decision. Bowing to Imamu was one thing, but doing the same for his family was another entirely. No doubt they would shortly be trying their hardest to usurp as many government positions as possible just to try and get a better deal out of her and the creatures that placed their trust in their Queen.\n\nAt least a short-lived rebellion would have gotten rid of those leeches.\n\nThe unbridled vitriol of that thought quickly subsided as she recognised a familiar trot coming towards her quarters. Imamu seemingly hadn’t had enough of her for one day, although now with her attention his hooves seemed particularly forceful against the stone floors. No doubt he too was stressed, if not by the situation then by the sheer quantity of paperwork that was typically her responsibility.\n\nIbyz rubbed her eyes and shook her head, making sure that her clothes were still mostly in order as she prepared for the knock at her door. His presence was usually a comfort, but at this very moment the Storm Queen had no idea what her closest friend wanted to say. Everything of importance had been discussed during that ancient-forsaken meeting; of this at least, Her Majesty was confident. More likely than that it was something personal. Judging by the sound of his hoofsteps, something angry and personal.\n\nAs his approach slowed almost to a standstill by her door, the yeti took a deep breath and decided to answer before he could knock."

Ibyz had barely the strength left in her to read it all, only then to wish that she’d had a little time to prepare for this conversation. The zebra’s demands at the negotiating table had all been met, but it was overtly clear to her that he wasn’t here to talk politics.\n\nAt first it looked like he was going to eviscerate her with a string of furious remarks, which would have been well deserved considering the chaos and suffering she had caused; but the yells never came. It was taking every bit of strength, but the grimace on Imamu’s face insisted he stay calm. Slowly, ever-so-slowly, the rage subsided primarily into muted sorrow as tears welled in his eyes.\n\n"A part of me... didn't want to give you a second chance,” He began, taking as much time with his words as he could to avoid falling apart completely, “A part of me wanted so badly to go ahead with the revolt, even after the negotiation. Every member of my family is wondering why I didn't demand that you relinquish your power, and I couldn't answer them..."\n\nHis stare never broke, even as his voice quivered and lingered on every syllable that emphasised the gravity of his words.

The likelihood was that it had been specifically meant for her to read, likely as some final cautionary message; but there was every possibility that it was a joke she had never heard the set up to. There was every possibility that it was meant for his father who she knew about but had never met. It could have been all three, at a stretch; he certainly had the wit for that kind of final message.\n\nThe yeti sighed deeply as she ran a thin and calloused thumb over the inscription, meticulously removing some of the moss that had grown in the time since she had last been here. It had been years and she still found herself at a loss when she knelt in this spot. Those passed did not walk amongst these stones and Imamu, like her own father, likely would not have spoken to her even if he did. She hadn’t enjoyed even a second of her labours’ fruits, nor had she kept that silent promise.\n\nIbyz tried to say something, but closed her mouth almost as quickly as her lips had parted. There was nothing she could say about the current state of affairs that would have made him happier, had he been here. Neither was there anything she could say that would have earned his forgiveness. It had taken her another three years to work up the courage to be here, just so she could try her best not to fall apart again. It didn’t help that the Storm Queen felt consistently less energetic as time went on, feeling that basic motions of life were becoming truly arduous. The welling tears in her eyes alone felt like they might take years off of her life.\n\nThis time at least she was too tired to hide and wipe away those tears, letting them fall slowly on the grass below as she gripped the cold stone in front of her. After all, that was all she could truly do when those that would have listened were gone. Perhaps that was something, if Imamu ever looked back from the beyond."

Take a seat.”\n\nDespite the bluntness of the reassurance, Zelitha found herself quite comforted by those words as she climbed back up onto the armchair with a little more steadiness. Her Majesty set down a thick file on the coffee table in front as she took a seat beside the zebra with relative grace, turning once again to look at the nervous creature as they both found more comfortable postures in which to sit.\n\n“I...

Were it any other creature and with any more or less nervous train-of-thought ramblings, the yeti might have assumed some degree of insincerity in her words. It seemed - however - that Zelitha earnestly meant everything that she was saying. Perhaps even a little too earnestly.\n\n“...all the same, I’ll do whatever it takes to prove that I’m still loyal.

She had been tasked with gathering and compiling additional information on the Ancient Pact and was evidently ready to share it, with a little help from a slide projector of course. The silence of the room was replaced with the rustling of military slacks and the clinking modernised armour plates as the storm creature explained in as much detail as possible the military readiness of the alliance. They were a formidable force with significant numbers of musterable soldiers and a positive standing amongst the fledgling international community from whom they would likely receive support in the event of a war. The storm creature added that the public and governments of both key members of the alliance harboured significant mistrust towards the kingdom.\n\nAs Nor returned the projector to the side and herself to a seat, most of the room was scrawling down notes as the majority of this information was new to them all. Of particular concern was the prospect of international support for the Ancient Pact as that could significantly strengthen an otherwise comparable foe.\n\nOnce her subordinates were satisfied with their jottings, the Storm Queen stood at the head of the table with her own report on Hestraya and the reception of diplomatic overtures in Karkadannistan. In her mind she was already considering the many wars that would likely be necessary for her kind to secure a lasting peace, prompting a sigh before she continued the council."

SLC_collab_tree.2.d:0 "Parties were still one the Storm Queen’s least enjoyable activities to participate in. Organising such events was at least a somewhat enthralling task, but attending them was another matter entirely. This soirée in particular was of a special kind of discomfort beyond that also, as the guests comprised primarily of the remaining upper societal echelons and business owners that had been brave enough to show their faces. Elites from Karen, industrialists from the Eye of the Storm, a few overly confident members of the Uzerasi house and even some influential eastern chiefs that had bent the knee.\n\nThough Imamu could not be here on this particular night, she could at least try to be as confident and approach the slimiest looking creature in the room first.\n\n“...causing the value of the shares to slump sharply. Oh, Your Majesty!” An out of shape and gaudily dressed yeti gave out in surprise as Ibyz Icepaw approached his circle. “Grezak Icebearer, a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance. I must admit, I was a tad concerned about your rule after the trial of old Hailstorm; but things seem to be moving along just fine. In fact, we’ve achieved record profits this year in some areas! I must thank you for that, at least.”\n\nHe quickly remembered to bow, although the heft of his stomach prevented his upper body from descending very far down. The Storm Queen recognised his name as one of Ikvus Hailstorm’s closest partners, although he had managed to remain mostly above suspicion during the proceedings of the traitor’s case.\n\n“The pleasure is all mine,” She returned with a polite smile, already regretting her choice of guest. “I understand that you have investments and operations in many sectors of the economy, correct?”\n\nGrezak nodded a little too vigorously for his multiple chins, prompting a slight wince from the rest of the circle. “I certainly do, Your Majesty! The Icebearer name can be found stamped into and onto products both civilian and military, soon perhaps more often than the name Hailstorm!”\n\nIbyz forced a slight chuckle at what she could only assume was genuine joy at the prospect of succeeding the exploitative worm that was the ruler of the short-lived regency. In that moment it was crystal clear that the legacy of such a figure would never truly die unless it was put down by the very creatures they were profiting off. Her reign would not be like his.\n\n“Your Majesty, are you quite alright?” The portly yeti asked, bringing the Storm Queen back from her internal musings."
SLC_collab_tree.2.a:0 ""Apologies, I became lost in my own thoughts for a moment.""

SLC_collab_tree.3.t:0 "The Best Defence..."
SLC_collab_tree.3.d:0 "Imamu was by no means camera shy, but he was still a little new to this kind of public involvement. He’d never had a chance to try his hoof at true mass media until now, albeit largely because Ibyz had needed to be the one addressing her kin whilst he dealt with his family. Currently he was standing beside her at a podium in the Eye of the Storm, doing his best to look straight ahead and into the crowd as cameras circled around them. He’d helped prepare the speech that she was about to give, alongside a number of other statesyetis and the most important figures in the general staff of course.\n\nStealing a quick glance at the zebra and smiling, the Storm Queen waved to the crowd of assembled creatures and began to speak as their cheers waned. “When I look out into this crowd, I see a proud nation and people that have every right to be proud of themselves. I see a warrior people that were not simply resigned to watch the slow and agonising fall of a nation only just united as one. I see a dedicated and hard-working people, unaffected by the wake of war and even prospering in spite of it.”\n\nImamu nodded gently as his friend took a moment to pause and not rush her lines, suppressing a slight smile of his own at the fact that she had absolutely taken his advice on board.\n\n“However,” She went on, measuring her pace carefully. “I also see a nation that does not wish to be plunged into another era of unending conflict and a people that wish for peace and prosperity. I see potential in each and every one of my subjects and I see - just a little below the surface - millions of creatures that are tired of being treated like villains because of the first decade our kind has spent united under one banner.”\n\nIt had been a little difficult to capture that message without mentioning the Storm King. To say anything negative about him would have been an act of immediate reputational suicide, but to ignore the issues he left in his wake would be unwise at best. Tightropes were difficult to walk with cloven hooves.\n\n“My reign will not be wholly peaceful, this is a simple reality enforced by those that would see our kind return to a disunited savagery; but we will be kinder. We will be better. We will ensure that our future is as prosperous as it can be as we best the enemies of our great kingdom.” She continued, stopping again for a second and leaning in to the microphone. “That is my promise to you.”"

SLC_collab_tree.4.t:0 "Those that Her Majesty Serves"
SLC_collab_tree.4.d:0 "“...but the benefits of free trade are only tangible when there are states that firstly want to cooperate with us and secondly need something from us. As it stands we remain largely reviled internationally and we do not have masses of any particularly valuable resources. We have most basic materials in acceptable quantities, but little more besides. I do not believe that free trade and subsequent economic reforms that entirely open the country would be particularly profitable and we would more likely end up importing far more than we export.” A member of the Uzerasi family finished, his words receiving a quite surprising number of agreeing nods even amongst the yetis present.\n\nIbyz watched as a subtle rage built up in some of the statesyetis sitting opposite the generals and the Uzerasi, doing her best not to enjoy the aggravation being placed upon someone else’s shoulders for once. She was still interested to hear what the advocates for economic openness had to say however and so slowly leaned forward to indicate her interest before half of the attendees became a little too cross.\n\n“Thank you for your input,” The yeti scowled, “But I believe you are missing the bigger picture. For one thing, large scale import arrangements are by no means wholly negative or permanent and they would allow us to continue developing technologically at a faster rate. I should also point out that there are countries which lack basic natural resources entirely and would be more than willing to consider deals with us provided our terms are fair. Regarding optics, don’t you think it would be better for Her Majesty’s government to - in her words - ‘be kinder’ and open the country to foreign interests? Don’t you think that could be beneficial for our international situation?”\n\nBoth sides had valid points to make and each creature had already expressed their feelings a number of times by this point in the meeting. Soon enough they would no doubt be repeating themselves, or brawling over the large table that separated them. The Storm Queen quickly raised a hand to settle the two creatures, wishing to conclude what could become an hour-long debate.\n\n“Thank you both for your input.” She began calmly, “I have come to a decision. We will open our markets to foreign interests but favour the home market in trade deals as much as is possible. This will allow us to import what is needed and export what we can without making us reliant on other nations. A protectionist market economy. Objections?”\n\nThe room and the tired eyes within it remained silent."

SLC_collab_tree.5.t:0 "The Question of the Day"
SLC_collab_tree.5.d:0 "“If a buffer territory is absolutely necessary, then we should do our best to create it reactively rather than proactively.” Imamu managed, having foolishly tried to talk whilst chomping down on a sautéed herb square.\n\nThe Storm Queen considered this as she stirred a spicy dumpling and broth soup of her own making, smiling absentmindedly as they enjoyed the food she’d just spend about an hour making. Cooking for zebras was always a little interesting, what with their narrow diets; but all things challenging can also be satisfying.\n\nTaking a sip of the soup and then a mouthful, Ibyz nodded at her work and cleared her throat. “On this we agree. Unfortunately, there are some states that we should not be passive about. The Great Lakes and its leading government especially are a severe threat that we should deal with now rather than later. The longer we wait, the more militarised they become and the more zebra and yeti lives alike will be lost when conflict does occur.”\n\n“Are you sure they’ll be so hasty?” Imamu asked with a mild concern, this time without a wide variety of leaves in his mouth. “Attacking a united yeti nation-state on its home turf has never been tried before. Even the Uzerasi Kingdom - long may it be remembered - struggled to keep a hold of a small number of yeti vassals.”\n\n“Just a state, for the moment.” She corrected, “And do not forget the anger of the creatures that were hurt and robbed by my predecessor. I do not wish to gamble the fate of my kind on the vain hope of peace when there are so many who want war. I will concede that your position has its own merits regarding international optics, however.”\n\nImamu allowed himself a smile as he polished off his half of the dinner, ever-impressed by Her Majesty’s cooking and that she continued to do it at all given her status. Ultimately matters of war were firmly in her field of expertise and entirely under her authority, not just conventionally thanks to the Storm King but also because of his own lack of both knowledge and - of course - an army of his own. He could offer little more than his thoughts and was happy to have them considered on such a subject as this, particularly as Ibyz was evidently weighing up his suggestion.\n\nAfter few spoons of soup the Storm Queen looked up with a nod and a toothy smile,"
SLC_collab_tree.5.a:0 ""If we wish not to be seen as villains, then we must not be aggressors.""

SLC_collab_tree.6.t:0 "No More Favouritism"
SLC_collab_tree.6.d:0 "It was almost uncomfortably quiet, which for a family gathering of the Uzerasi might as well have been deathly silence. Moreover, Imamu was getting a lot of dirty looks; or at least, looks that reminded him of the ones he got when he first announced the family’s collaboration with the yetis. It was not a pretty sight, but thankfully he was unfazed by such things nowadays.\n\nIt was fortunate that he wasn’t leading proceedings today.\n\nAn elderly zebra mare walked slowly to the end of the large table they used for meetings and calmly adjusted her reading glasses. “I’m sure you all have a lot to say, so I’ll try to keep this quick. What remains of our special status as favoured business-owners and political figures has been rendered null and void. Our family will no longer be the first to receive offers for economic projects and will instead need to compete for them with emerging businesses. We will also be subject to more regular business audits and anti-corruption measures that are currently enforced on yeti businesses.”\n\nA wave of grumbling and general dissatisfaction followed the news, alongside another series of scowls and icy stares. Still though, Imamu wasn’t fearful for himself. He knew they didn’t have a choice and that his disappearance or even just temporary inconveniences for him would have caused a near instantaneous reaction from the Storm Queen. None of them dared to provoke that kind of response.\n\n“Additionally,” The mare went on, clearing her throat multiple times before continuing. “All noble titles have been made non-transferrable. You may not pass your titles to your next of kin or to any other creature by any other means. Privileges currently afforded to you - if you have them - will remain in place.”\n\nBy now a number of family members had risen from their seats crying out various condemnations of Imamu’s leadership. He simply sat there as the attention of his kin slowly turned away from him and to one another as they then began to ask what they would do next, either out of fear or deliberate ignorance of the sway the family head still had over Ibyz Icepaw.\n\nIt was tragic in a way; that the Uzerasi Kingdom would pass into legend like this, in a room of squabbling nobles. The prince couldn’t help but be both saddened and frustrated at what was being taken away from him with these new laws, even though he’d known this was the likely outcome. Still, at least his people would prosper whilst his family fell apart."
SLC_collab_tree.6.a:0 "And Ibyz would no doubt do her best to comfort him."

SLC_collab_tree.7.t:0 "An Alpine Brew"
SLC_collab_tree.7.d:0 "It had been a while since they’d had the time and mind for an afternoon away from work, but it was by no means unappreciated. Things had simply been far too busy for Ibyz and Imamu to make time for even a little trip to a coffee shop like this. Of course, the latter would have been happy to just enjoy a beverage in some chain in Mzizima; but the Storm Queen had insisted he try something different. In all honesty, he had no idea where they were; just that it was cold and that he was glad for her company, if not for the tea which he hadn’t the heart to try just yet.\n\nAfter all, there were more important things on his mind.\n\n“So what’ll you do with me now?” The zebra asked plainly, adjusting the blanket he’d draped around himself and grunting slightly.\n\nThe Storm Queen looked back from the beautiful mountain vista of snow and untouched trees with a stony expression that only the zebra opposite her would interpret as contentedness. She’d had the foresight to take seats not far from the mountain cafe’s fire pit, although without the tea Imamu might have to give in and get another blanket. She sighed softly and put the cup in her hands back onto the small table between them.\n\n“Nothing,” She answered simply, before shaking her head a little and deciding to elaborate. “I should say, nothing that will greatly change your effective duties to the kingdom. I hope the waning influence of your family does not dissuade you from a position in government alongside other minority groups. I would very much appreciate your presence.”\n\nThe zebra’s expression shifted to one of mild curiosity, “Other minority groups? You mean to say that you plan on giving representation to the Hayzeb and Hyenians too?”\n\n“You didn’t think I would?” She asked with a sudden, uncomfortably toothy grin. “Yes, precisely. Others too, in the years to come. Just because I am largely finished with the Uzerasi does not mean I plan to ignore the creatures that they once ruled over.”\n\nThose words left a sense of cautious optimism in Imamu’s gut, prompting him to shiver a little less and mull things over for a moment. Soon enough, he was reaching for the tea that she’d order to the table for him."
SLC_collab_tree.7.a:0 ""Go on then, let's try some of that tea.""

SLC_collab_tree.8.t:0 "The Passing of the Torch"
SLC_collab_tree.8.d:0 "Although he would never have said so out loud, Imamu certainly felt a sudden sensation of guilt as he bowed deeply before the Storm Queen. He knew that she respected him and he trusted Ibyz to keep her word when it came to his kin’s safety and prosperity, but the ceremony seemed like a low blow despite its relative privacy. All the same, a renewal of his oath of fealty was both deserved for Her Majesty’s hard work and customary for his family; hate the circumstances as they might.\n\nThe richly decorated Uzerasi-effect great room in the Eye’s palace had been temporarily converted for this ceremony and the hall was utterly packed with zebras. Many of them were truly furious, but none dared to approach their liege or the storm creatures that stood by her sides. The discontent of the family only rose as Imamu emerged from his kowtowing and turned to face them, doing his best to avoid their icy glares and look just over the crowd instead of at it.\n\nThe family head cleared his throat as Ibyz stood silently behind him, “Good evening, relatives all. Although I am sure that not all of you are here out of mere obligation, I will make no mockery of our position today. Uzerasi independence and the realisation of your privileges have never been further away from us than they are now.”\n\nThe immediate admittance of that fact was enough to shock the room into a stupor and prompted a slight eyebrow raise even from the Storm Queen. Of course, they had written this speech together; but Imamu was nothing if not capable of adding flair in the moment. That and his general charisma were truly irreplaceable, even now.\n\n“And yet I must ask, are our kin not happy?” He went on slowly, gauging the mixed reactions of the nobles. “Have the streets not been cleaned, repaired and built upon by the yetis? Have our businesses not flourished? Have you not kept your lives and your livelihoods?”\n\nThe silence of the room as his words echoed into nothingness was palpable.\n\n“I take this oath today, not to a slightly more reasonable conqueror but to a Queen; to our Queen.” Imamu clarified, a steely certainty in his voice emerging out of the prior tone of conciliation. “I feel shame not because I bow to another, but because she has accomplished in years what we failed to for centuries. Stability and prosperity run like pink blood through the city of Mzizima and its heartbeat grows stronger every day. You know as well as I do that our people look to her when all else seems lost, not you or I. Renew your oaths with me and share in the wealth of this new age as valued citizens of the Storm Kingdom!”"

SLC_collab_tree.9.t:0 "The Kingdom Returns for Us"
SLC_collab_tree.9.d:0 "The administration has been up in arms this morning over a telegram that we have received from [SLC.GetNameDef]. In essence, the telegram demands that we immediately bend the knee to the rising yeti power and that [CZR.GetLeader] personally swears an oath of fealty to the Storm Queen in a publicly televised broadcast that will likely reach millions.\n\nBesides the obvious diplomatic and reputational nightmare that this telegram has already caused, the offer itself should be seriously considered. The Storm Queen is no weak-willed pretender and has already made great strides in the reunification of and redevelopment of a united yeti monarchy in the south. Were she to bring her forces to bear on us, we would most likely be severely outnumbered and outgunned.\n\nOn the other hand, it’s quite clear that acquiescing to the demands would essentially result in the annexation of our nation and the subsequent cessation of all government operations. This - unsurprisingly - is not popular with said government and our zebra subjects are no happier with the idea of the Storm King’s direct successor ruling over them.\n\nNevertheless, we must respond in one way or another."

There are many who believed that a demand like this would result simply in further conflict, although few expected such a conflict to be in any way challenging for our renewed military. Nevertheless, it was a pleasant surprise when news arrived of their acquiescence.\n\nIt is hoped that this outcome will foster a more submissive attitude from our new Great Laker subjects as a whole, although the Storm Queen has expressed concerns over the validity of this thought process. She believes that in the long term, adding several hundred thousand zebra subjects to a mass of many millions will only make the region more unstable. Fortunately, she is in agreement that this outcome is nevertheless for the best; as a war with [CZR.GetNameDef] would have only resulted in yeti casualties and the same eventual issues.\n\nNevertheless, this peaceful integration of foreign land is a momentous occasion for yetikind."

SLC_collab_tree.11.d:0 "To the surprise of none in the administration, [CZR.GetNameDef] has refused our demands for annexation and intends to defend itself militarily from us. Of course, they stand no chance against our immense military might; but their refusal is nevertheless frustrating. In particular the governors of the Great Lakes have expressed concerns that their defiance will only encourage their new and unhappy subjects to intensify resistance efforts, a concern which seems to be well founded if recent reports are anything to go by.\n\nThe Storm Queen has already prepared a speech for the nation when war with [CZR.GetNameDef] does undoubtedly break out, although there are few yetis that are truly concerned by a conflict with some backwards desert tribes. If anything, many are simply excited to see our borders become significantly cleaner on the maps that are currently being produced. After all, who doesn’t love a visual aid for how well the Storm Kingdom is doing? His Majesty would wish that he had come up with such profitable memorabilia.\n\nNevertheless, it seems war is on the horizon."

SLC_collab_tree.12.t:0 "Expected Resistance"
SLC_collab_tree.12.d:0 "“Well Your Majesty, it’s not good.” The aging yeti gave out simply, tossing a dossier in the direction of the Storm Queen and her favourite advisor. “The Hayzeb are resisting fiercely, as we predicted. Even Upper Hayzebland has become more rowdy than we’re used to, now that they’re reunited with their Lower Hayzebland kin.\n\nIbyz Icepaw carefully spread the documents over her end of the briefing room table, pointing out a few details to Imamu who was relatively out of the loop when it came to military matters and occupations. She, on the other hand, had already received reports on most of the information collated here; though Urzak usually had something of interest to say about the larger picture by the time it was all collated.\n\nThe General then raised a finger, meaning to make a point. “This being said, our operations are having the intended effect. Although the nobles are posing more resistance than we expected, they remain at odds with the wider population and their disunity is proving valuable. We’ve even managed to get through to some of those nobles for potential Uzerasi-style collaboration.”\n\nImamu flinched slightly at the mention of his family, knowing just how the Storm Queen was likely to use the next few out there in the Great Lakes. Urzak Deepfrost saw the reaction and offered an apologetic smile, having operated alongside Her Majesty on many projects in the Zwahile. Although he couldn’t possibly empathise, he sympathised with the zebra.\n\n“So,” Ibyz began, breaking the mild tension of the room. “How long do you believe pacification will take? The better part of a year?”\n\n“Pacification, significantly less.” Imamu offered, surprising the two yetis slightly with the confidence in his voice. “Integration? Likely around that length of time, or longer.”\n\nThe Storm Queen looked up at Urzak who looked at a well-used notepad that he’d left on the table a little while ago and hummed to himself. His projections were based largely off of what they had seen in Hyenia and the Zwahile and Imamu was almost spot on with his suggestion.\n\nHe simply nodded and studied the zebra’s notably gloomy expression, “Precisely, Ma’am.”"

SLC_collab_tree.13.t:0 "Old Methods, New Zebras"
SLC_collab_tree.13.d:0 "Ibyz Icepaw was standing at the head of a large conference table with Imamu by her side, studying the faces of the zebras that were filing into the large room. She had made sure to get appropriately sized furniture for their new Hayzeb guests, although the room itself was quite clearly intended for yeti occupants with its tall ceilings and otherwise oversized decor. It had the intended effect of what seemed to be a sense of general unease amongst the attending nobles, although that unease was superseded in places by their curiosity in Her Majesty’s companion.\n\nAs they began to settle in their seats, the Storm Queen cleared her throat and fanned out a number of zebra-sized files in one of her hands. “Your presence here today is much appreciated. I am glad that we have been able to reach so many creatures that see the way the wind is blowing. In my hand I hold a number of contracts for infrastructure projects in Lower Hayzebland. These will be undertaken by those present in groups of at least three, as it is my understanding that the Hayzeb nobility has plentiful wealth but lacks industrial expertise.”\n\nPresent guests looked at one another with slight concern, but then returned their attention with renewed interest as Ibyz handed the dockets over to Imamu.\n\nAs he trotted around the table and distributed the papers at regular intervals, the zebra began to speak. “Though most of you never interacted with the Uzerasi personally, you will likely have heard of my family in the past at least a few times. You may also have known that our kingdom crumbled in the face of a yeti invasion not so long ago; yet my kin and I remain, in spite of that. I have the Storm Queen to thank for our continued existence and relevance.”\n\nRounding the table and taking Ibyz’s previous position at its head with a slight smile, he stood a moment to watch as they shared the information inside the dossiers between one another. He could see much of the prior trepidation gradually disappear as they passed around the files.\n\n“I need not remind you that the yetis can bring to bear far more force than you can muster if it comes to that, but we hope that it will not. Indeed, for your sake, Her Majesty is more than happy to provide you and the projects you accept with security out of her own reserves. We expect results and in return you will receive protection and pay. My presence before you today is proof enough that the yetis keep their promises, but break them yourselves and you know the kinds of warriors you will face. Are we absolutely clear?” He asked, exuding authority."

SLC_collab_tree.14.t:0 "A Show of Force"
SLC_collab_tree.14.d:0 "Parades were rarely an effective method of instilling fear in the population of a given territory and the Hayzeb were no strangers to violent resistance. They of all creatures would be the least responsive to that kind of thinly veiled threat levied at Zano.\n\nTo some extent, that was the point.\n\nZelitha grunted as the MID agents presented their findings, watching the zebras shuffle uncomfortably in front of the assembled soldiers. “And you’re confident that security will be relatively relaxed? It could be a big day for them”\n\n“Y-yes!” One of her informants managed, “They believe that most of our forces are concentrated in the parade itself. I don’t think they’re aware of the agency’s presence here, or at least its prevalence. A lot of the cells are taking this opportunity to show their new members what they’re all up against by actually attending the celebration. This is the perfect time to strike!”\n\nThe officer sat back in her chair, letting the old armour she wore clink away as she considered the words of her timid kin. It was a reasonable assertion that many rebels would indeed have abandoned their hideouts in order to observe the procession of tanks and thousands of soldiers. It was such a large event that the noise of it all could be heard from Zano’s outskirts, though this particular gathering was not hidden quite so far away from the main event.\n\nWith a weathered hoof at her chin, Zelitha eventually nodded and made an unintelligible gesture to the surrounding yeti soldiers. “Good. Today should be very productive then. Make sure to tag any conspirators that we don’t already have on file and try not to make too much mess. The last thing we need is more paperwork.”\n\nA short chorus of mumbled agreements from the eager yeti soldiers was followed by their departure from the small safehouse whilst their commanding officer kept her gaze firmly on the agents. They were zebras and they knew a lot. They knew more than they ought, especially for local recruits. They could quickly become a liability.\n\nOne of the informants spoke nervously as she continued to think about what to do with the small group, “Ma’am, what shall we do now?”\n\n“Quite simple,” She responded without hesitation, “Go and enjoy the afternoon off.”\n\nAnd so they did. It wasn’t long before the stress of the situation began to creep in again, prompting her to reach into her uniform for a cigarette."

Ancients below, what is the world coming to?” The overalled yeti yelled in exasperation.\n\nThe comparatively minute zebra in front of her was practically boiling over, trying desperately not to start a fight that he probably wouldn’t win. “For the last time, this land belongs to us. The local government has no jurisdiction over its sale or its use by the public because it’s designated as grazing land for us and our animals. There was nothing we needed to tell them.”\n\nThe surrounding yeti construction workers and nomadic zebras represented by their respective sides of the discussion mostly looked on with concern, hoping this wouldn’t lead to some kind of altercation. To top it all off, someone had seen what was going on and they’d managed to alert the authorities; neither side particularly wanted to get involved with the military police.\n\nHaving been alerted, it didn’t take long for storm creatures to appear all around; as if out of nowhere.\n\n“You sorry excuse for sapience-” The yeti began, stopping only as he noticed a creature with a cracked mask approaching them both. “Ah! Good afternoon officer! Fantastic timing, I was just about to lose my temper with this savage. I do hope you can-”\n\n“Savage?” The zebra immediately gave out, having just acknowledged the creature with a bow. “That’s rich. Your kind have burned down everything! Twice! And now you’re here, asking us to move away from our land as though taking everything else wasn’t enough.”\n\nHaving stopped to listen to the far-from-polite conversation, the storm creature took a few steps forward to stand between the two. Almost complete silence followed, save for the pawsteps of more creatures forming a cordon between the two sides.\n\nFirstly, it turned to the yeti and cuffed her in the blink of an eye. She barely even had time to react as another two creatures grabbed her by the arms and began carting her off whilst ignoring her mix of anger and pleading. The zebra looked ecstatic until the beast handed him a note and motioned for him to read it.\n\n"Alright... 'Notice of resettlement and available compensation.’ Oh, I see."

The protestors hadn’t yet been able to get to him, as much as they might try; though their voices certainly could.\n\n“Traitor!” The zebra could make out clearly.\n\n“Scab!” Cried one of his kinsmares.\n\n“Collaborator scum!” Managed another.\n\nJika’s escort seemingly paid the protestors no mind as the pair walked and trotted towards the gates of the factory, trying to avoid whatever items were being thrown over the makeshift barricades. The yeti was clearly unfazed by this sort of thing, which wasn’t surprising in the slightest. Similar situations had occurred all over lower Hayzeb in the last few weeks. He’d even heard about some of the collaborator divisions being moved in to handle the calmer strikes so that hardened yeti soldiers could be reassigned to positions like these. There must have been hundreds of zebras beyond the hastily erected barrier, maybe more.\n\nLetting out a sudden chuckle, the soldier chuckled as they approached the plant’s entrance. “Some welcoming party, huh? It always amazes me how they manage to find scabs all the way out here. Don’t forget to leave out from the back at the end of the day, yeah?”\n\nWith a look of mild surprise at the soldier’s utter calmness, Jika slowly replied. “O-of course. Your protection is m-much appreciated.”\n\n“Eh, don’t mention it.” The soldier gave out with a little shake of their head, brushing off the thanks as they lowered their gun and pulled open the heavy steel gate with a grunt. “You can thank me once the sun goes down if none of them have caused any serious problems. Don’t be too worried if you hear gunshots though. We’re the ones with all the guns, after all.”\n\nFor a moment the zebra simply stood stock-still and stared at his companion, "I-I'll bare that in mind.""

SLC_collab_tree.17.d:0 "Ibyz Icepaw watched over the rest of the party with a subtly pleased expression on her face. Imamu had already pointed out her unusually calm eyebrows and the lack of a furrowed brow as tell-tale signs of a good mood on their way over to the venue, but for the time being he was doing as he did best. Schmoozing with the Hayzeb nobility, as best he could anyway; supposedly the upper class here were even more cut-throat than his own family were.\n\nA few haughty laughs followed by shuffling and subsequently hushed conversation was enough to know that her friend had excused himself from the conversation.\n\n“You can always go and ask their chefs for recipes, you know.” The zebra offered as he watched the Storm Queen carefully select the most visually complex snacks from the buffet. “I’m starting to struggle out there, they’re all much more competitive than I’m used to.”\n\nThe response to that observation was a simple nod, at first. “Good.”\n\nBefore Imamu could ask what she meant by that and tell her that forcing him to operate on his own was more than a little unkind, a sudden shout from one of the other guests caught him by surprise. It wasn’t directed at them, however.\n\n“You’re more naive than a foal if you believe our host arranged this party out of altruism.” The zebra gave out with a barely restrained rage.\n\nThe more refined and significantly older mare huffed in frustration as space emerged between the two. “And you’re a fool to believe that your farm estate is as valuable to the yetis as my manufactories are. I am indeed courting Her Majesty and you should be trying harder to do the same, if you value your land and your titles.”\n\nAlmost immediately the young gentlecolt threw himself at the older lady, prompting several to come to the defence of the mare. The situation very quickly devolved into a brawl, albeit a very tame one by the standards of the Storm Queen who was watching on intently. Imamu’s jaw managed to recover from its position on the floor as he turned to look up at Ibyz in utter disbelief.\n\n“I... Uhm... Should we help them? Some of them?” He asked quietly, staring at the commotion.\n\nIbyz stood and thought about using a fork before shrugging, grabbing one of many small slices of cake from her overfilled plate and eating it as they both watched the kerfuffle unfold. As she swallowed the comparatively tiny sliver of sponge, she simply smiled; all was going exactly as planned."

SLC_collab_tree.18.d:0 "“We don’t have much in the way of options, do we?” Imamu asked, politely sipping at his bitter cup of tea as he and the Storm Queen perused a table of maps and files.\n\nHer Majesty’s was currently flicking through the docket on the current Senturyan ruler with a stony expression. Most would assume that was simply her resting face, but the zebra recognised her particular scowl of slight frustration as she nodded and placed the folder carefully back atop the eastern portion of the map.\n\n“We do not,” She quickly agreed, stepping behind her friend and moving to another map of the west. “But there are some. Karkadannistan is... promising.”\n\nThe zebra turned his snout up almost immediately, “I’m... not so sure about that. The Shahanshah is a warmonger and a despot, not the sort of equine you want to get in bed with.”\n\n“The optics are poor.” Ibyz concurred, humming either at the situation or at the choice of phrasing. “The potential economic and military benefits are still significant. An alliance of any sort may also balance against the choice of ally, given the current international perception of my kind.”\n\nImamu cocked his head a little but still seemed to disapprove of the idea. He took a look at the maps above; at Arabia, Riseia and the assortment of nations in north and northwestern Zebrica. None were particularly sympathetic, not even the harmonists. In the short term an alliance with the Shahanshah was detrimental to the kingdom’s slowly growing national prestige, but the Storm Queen made a good point with respect to the long-term benefits of a potentially longstanding pact in that department.\n\n“Do you believe that Tahmasp is trustworthy?” The zebra asked finally, looking away from the maps.\n\n“It doesn’t matter,” Ibyz returned, gesturing across the table of maps and documents. “He is in the same position that we are. Managing a highly martial society whilst surrounded by few friends and many enemies is no easy task. I believe pragmatics would force his commitment if he chose to accept a military and economic arrangement regardless of trust or personal opinion.”\n\nImamu rolled his eyes subtly and chuckled, “A flattering exploration of his moral character,” Before the seriousness in his demeanour returned, “But you make a good point. Presented correctly, an offer like this is difficult to turn down and even harder to back out of.”\n\nIbyz Icepaw simply nodded as one of her hands drifted to the landline phone on the other side of what had once been a usable dining table."

In both cases trade agreements have been placed on the table as either bargaining chips or potential benefits for [KAR.GetNameDef] and our citizens.\n\nAdditionally, a very politely worded letter that was addressed directly to [KAR.GetLeader] was delivered by hand. The note was written by Ibyz Icepaw herself and cordially invites [KAR.GetLeader] as well an entourage of their choosing to a celebration if we choose to accept their offers of cooperation.\n\nMany have already criticised this overture as a blatant attempt to restore the mediocre national prestige of the Storm Kingdom in the wake of their prior collapse. Equally however, the yetis have much to offer us from an economic and military perspective; boasting a strong military tradition and copious resources with which we may fuel our industries. Our response to this offer is of course in the hooves of [KAR.GetLeader] who will no doubt make a decision that benefits all of [KAR.GetName]."

It would be possible to make other arrangements, but there was no other state with as positive an opinion of yetis as that of [KAR.GetNameDef]. It made the prospects of any future international cooperation seem slim at best.\n\nIbyz took two steps back from the counter and looked down at the floor, arms stretched out over her head as she wondered how best to continue. Imamu would need to be told of course - a part of him would be relieved at least - and then there was the rest of the nation and her advisory councils. All would need to be addressed, given the public nature of the overtures and the fact that [KAR.GetLeader] had delivered the gifts directly to the capital where they could be seen by all.\n\nEventually Her Majesty stood up straight, adjusted the collar of her military-styled suit and began walking towards her study.

SLC_collab_tree.23.d:0 "It was a chilly but surprisingly sunny morning as [KAR.GetLeader] and the Storm Queen stood at either side of a lovingly carved stone pedestal, doing their best to look presentable for the multitude of yeti reporters and a large number of other esteemed creatures from both states.\n\nThe mountainous citadel at the centre of Icepaw Hold at the very tail-end of the Zwahile made for a fine location to host the ratification of the defensive pact and trade arrangements. Aside from the central position of the fortification between the capitals of the two great states, the view over the bay and the weather too was effortlessly pleasant and relaxing; a perfect location for a small dinner party in the aftermath. Cool wind blew through the halls and over the battlements as Her Majesty calmly scanned the attendees and adjusted her uniform.\n\nThis was of course a pre-arranged ceremony that had been approved by the administration of [KAR.GetNameDef] as well as that of the Storm Kingdom, but the energy in the air was nothing short of electric. Ibyz Icepaw in particular was - for once - clearly very excited by the event and wore a smile with enough teeth that anyone less significant than [KAR.GetLeader] or less familiar than Imamu would have found intimidating.\n\nOnce the keep was full and all important guests had arrived, including the aforementioned zebra, the event could begin in earnest with a speech from the Storm Queen. “Assembled creatures, this day is truly a remarkable one in the history of my kind. We are not known for our ability to cooperate in times of strife and the lack of foreign allies in our history is demonstrative of that.”\n\nSome murmurs of agreement filled the room as she paused to breathe, “We are still a long way away from being trustworthy in the eyes of the world, but that is what makes this pact truly special. In dangerous times like these where those who value things besides stability and prosperity seek to tear down all that has been built, friends are more valuable than ever. [KAR.GetNameDefCap] and its wise leadership have elected to bestow upon us trust and defensive responsibilities that so few nations would dare to risk. Today I and the rest of my kind find in [KAR.GetLeader] a rare such friend.”\n\nTaking a few steps back from the podium, Ibyz politely bowed her head and motioned for the new defensive ally of the Storm Kingdom to speak. She took a quick breath and retreated back to her seat, forgetting to hide her excitedly swinging tail."

SLC_collab_tree.24.t:0 "A Monumental Achievement"
SLC_collab_tree.24.d:0 "It was truly a new experience for the Storm Queen to attend what was essentially a high-class party that she herself had organised. The fact that she had organised a celebration alone was somewhat rare, but for her to attend it instead of Imamu’s relatives, her generals or indeed just the also invited foreign dignitaries - in this case from [KAR.GetNameDef] - was quite unusual.\n\nAs she gracefully hauled herself out of the matte black car, Ibyz did her best to stay composed. Parties she could manage - her exposure to the Uzerasi had acclimatised herself to that kind of office politics style of environment - but attending them to truly celebrate? That was new in and of itself. Even then it was unusual to find herself out of a military uniform and in something more casual, but truly it was a necessity if she wished not to personally perpetuate the militaristic image of the Storm Kingdom.\n\nImamu was never one to shy away from speaking his mind, of course. “May I say that you look stunning? Or is that a little much, Your Majesty?”\n\nHaving approached from the doors of a car behind, the Storm Queen was yet to have noticed the zebra and turned around with a slight smile. He could have sworn there was something resembling a blush on her cheeks and that some effort was going towards stillness of her tail, but it was difficult to say with all of the fur that was now unrestrained by the familiar uniforms she typically wore.\n\n“I... accept the compliment.” She gave out after a moment, inspecting her simplistic wrap-like gown and fiddling with one of her new drop earrings. “It has been a long time since I last wore a dress. A very long time.”\n\nThe head of the Uzerasi family chuckled as he looked over the interspersed lavender and cyan fabric that did little in the way of hiding her scars and muscle, “You haven’t had much need to do so, up until now. It would be nice to see you out of uniform a little more often though, and no doubt the public will appreciate some slightly more relatable presentation.”\n\n“You may be right,” The yeti responded simply; wiping a barely-noticeable smudge from the broach of knotted gold resting just above her chest and thinking fondly of the shawl that it typically pinned to her field uniform.\n\nImamu gave her a little nudge and smiled, “Come on, [KAR.GetLeader] isn’t going to wait all day. You’ll probably get on with them better than you do with my family.”"

And then if this plan of yours doesn’t succeed-”\n\n“It will succeed,” She quickly interrupted, before looking up from her tea with an apologetic smile for cutting him off. “We will see some success regardless of how Maregypt responds. If they decline the demands, it justifies our intervention; if they accept the demands then conflict is avoided but our legitimacy in the Great Lakes still improves.”\n\nImamu nibbled at one of the ginger biscuits that the Storm Queen had put on the coffee table and pondered. In essence the plan was sound, but it was made without consideration of a possible military failure and he wasn’t exactly sure how the surrounding powers would react to the annexation of territory consisting of a group of zebras in self-imposed exile. Ovingoland was such a bizarre territory that he could only consider potential outcomes with a furrowed brow as the biscuit turned slowly into mere crumbs.\n\nWith a hum and a tap of his hooves on the armrest of the chair he was sitting in, Imamu dared to ask the remaining question. “What if a conflict erupts and... we lose?”\n\nIbyz Icepaw watched his ears flick somewhat nervously as she made to respond, “Then we have gained nothing. Prestige and international relations will suffer. Our mandate to govern the Great Lakes will be damaged too. I am willing to take that risk, given the state of the Maregyptian army.”\n\n“And if they receive outside help?” The zebra pressed, “That is a possibility. They’re an important regional power and their stability is important for trade, amongst other things.”\n\nThe Storm Queen’s tail swished to the side and slowed considerably as she put her tea down on the table, “Foreign intervention justifies the invasion. The risk and potential reward both rise.”\n\n“But the risk does indeed rise,” He returned with a sigh, “I trust your confidence in the armed forces, just don’t let it cloud your vision for a peaceful and stable future.”\n\nWith a subtle nod, Ibyz Icepaw slowly clasped her hands together and closed her eyes for a moment or two, weighing it up all over again in her head."

SLC_collab_tree.26.d:0 "Dire news reaches the administration on this day.\n\n[SLC.GetNameDefCap] has demanded the transfer of our territories currently occupied by Ovingolanders in the south. Though we suggested a population exchange in return, the Storm Queen quickly reaffirmed that our choices were a territorial transfer or war. Though many in the government find this particular detail of the diplomatic so-called 'overtures' curious, an equal number believe it to be unsurprising given the recent history of overconfident yeti rulers.\n\nWith this being said, the demand itself has also proven polarising. Many are adamant that the successor to the Storm King should not be allowed to run amok across Zebrica for the second time and moreover that the presence of Ovingolanders does not justify the annexation of territory that has been in our hooves for centuries. On the other side of the aisle, there are many who fear the wrath of a resurgent Storm Kingdom and its new Queen.\n\nThough the yetis have proven to be formidable foes in the past, our military has grown in size and strength quite considerably. Experts have estimated that a conflict like this, if not immediately won, could result in our eventual victory. Simultaneously it is hard to justify defending an area of desert occupied by a majority of creatures that are ultimately not our own.\n\nIn the end, the decision is left to [MGY.GetLeader]."

This was of course a stunned success in diplomatic terms, but it certainly wasn’t what the Storm Queen had been hoping for when the demands had been sent downriver. War had been the objective in order to retroactively justify their rule over the Great Lakes.\n\nShe leaned over to turn off the heat to the large frying pan in which a stir-fry was currently sizzling and placed the note on the counter, wiping her hands on the apron she was currently wearing with a sigh. This was still good news and the ‘reunification’ of the Great Lakes was a narrative that could be spun regardless of how the territory was reclaimed, but the lack of a war which could be used to substantiate the tale was detrimental.\n\nWith a grunt of acceptance, Ibyz carefully pulled the strap of the apron over her head and folded it neatly away. In the end a victory was still a victory and perhaps the lives saved by the avoidance of conflict would make up for those that would be lost in the occupation without a significant stabilising event."

I... I have an urgent telegram!”\n\n“Ah,” She replied simply, standing up from her seat and turning to face the scrawny servant. “Have the Maregyptians sent a reply?”\n\n“They have, Your Majesty... Here,” The young yeti gave out as he caught his breath, holding up the paper slip.\n\nTaking the note, the Storm Queen read the note over twice and nodded as the runner gradually stood up straight. In a way the response was disheartening as it meant that war was on the horizon, but it was also precisely what they had planned for. Preparations had already been made in advance and now it was simply time to give the orders that she had been waiting to give for almost a month now.\n\nAfter a moment or two of relative quiet, Ibyz turned to her desk once more and picked up a rather large pile of documents that she had prepared for just this occasion. Each contained the orders and directions for various generals and ministers about what they were to do and say regarding the impending invasion. It wasn’t pleasant to keep them out of the loop, but in cases like this it was important to remain seemingly quiet and thus innocent regarding the causes of the war.\n\n“Careful, these are heavy.” The Storm Queen gave out simply as she bestowed the pile carefully upon the runner. “To be delivered in this order: Staff office, Imamu, the ministers and then the media. They are already arranged in the correct order.”\n\nThe yeti struggled for a moment before nodding with sudden resolve, “Good luck, Your Majesty!”"

Stay in your homes as we complete the reunification with your brothers and sisters!"\n\nNo matter what radio signal you listen to they're all breaking the same story: The Storm Queen's armies have succeeded in gaining complete control over Ovingoland and are advancing further into Maregypt. The Maregyptian government is now under the stress of not only losing face in the eyes of their citizens but also the risk of another complete capitulation to the yetis.

I do not know why. Tenzfur Thunderbringer is most likely to have lost or sold it whilst travelling east. It could be anywhere and I do not want to finance a search for a potentially dangerous artefact.”\n\nHe scrunched his snout concernedly and set the paper to one side, realising the gravity of the situation. Nations with damaged pride and disgruntled leadership generally did not make for good neighbours and as a victim of the Storm King he certainly understood the desire not to give an artefact of unknown value to potentially hostile countries. For once he seemed to share an opinion precisely with Ibyz and the conclusion to be drawn was not a positive one.\n\n“So these overtures won’t go anywhere?” The zebra asked simply after a few moments.\n\nThe Storm Queen drummed the three digits of one hand on the armrest of her chair and shook her head. “It is unlikely that progress will be made.”\n\nSilence filled the room as an old wooden grandfather clock made its presence known with its consistent ticking, counting every moment. The ancient pact was not an inconsequential military force and its continued existence was testament enough of its strength in the face of external foes even in spite of great conquerors such as the Storm King. This would not be an easy battle to win, if it was to be won at all.\n\nEventually Imamu nodded, huffing just a little. “I understand. Be careful out there, Ibyz.”"

Despite our worst fears, we were pleasantly surprised to hear their Queen had no intention to wage war with us today, instead wishing to foster warmer relations for peace between our nations. This would have surely been on the table had they returned the Cornerstone but this is sadly not the case, the yeti diplomats claimed the Cornerstone had been stolen from the kingdom's reliquary by Tenzfur Thunderbringer and was subsequently lost. They would be unable to give it back today; if ever.\n\nWe can't help but have our doubts.\n\nTherefore we had to send the diplomats back with empty hands to their Queen. So long as the Cornerstone is not returned we cannot pursue closer relations with the Storm Kingdom, we hope the Storm Queen will understand that and return the precious Cornerstone sooner rather than later if she truly wishes for peace between our two realms."

Once again the yetis show their unending arrogance by offering us nothing but words and expecting us to forgive and forget, the nerve.\n\nWith no further delay and no intention to hear any more lies from the Storm Queen’s ilk we have sent the yeti diplomats back to their homeland, making sure they did not overstay their welcome lest they want to become an example for any future would-be invaders. We have also sent our diplomats to our gargoyle allies to reaffirm the pact's ties and warn them of these two-faced diplomats, it wouldn't be surprising if this were a pathetic attempt to undermine the pact's unity.

As a storm creature she understood why the Ancient Pact was so determined on not making peace until the Cornerstone was returned, despite that she felt frustration that they would throw away diplomacy so eagerly. The same way she understood why the Storm Queen was willing to march to war even if she felt it was excessive considering the Pact was yet to be overtly hostile.\n\n"I know what you're thinking." Urzak said, noticing Nor's uncertainty. "But they brought this on themselves. Our Queen offered an olive branch and they knew what we were capable of, it is their own fault they forced us on the warpath over some useless trinket." He let out a snort.

If they are unable to do so then their legal partner, should there be one of sound mind, may do so on their behalf.’” Imamu began, reading through the document that the Storm Queen had just placed in front of him and shooting her a quick smile before continuing. “‘Article Two: If an heir has not been selected, absolute primogeniture applies. The eldest may not inherit only if they are not of sound mind or if they decline the position. If no child of the monarch is eligible on these grounds, the procedure outlined in Article Five is to begin.’”\n\nIbyz Icepaw nodded with a flat expression and waited patiently for him to continue as her tail betrayed her excitement by swishing from side to side.\n\n“‘Article Three: The presiding monarch must determine the necessity of adoption if they intend to pass on their title hereditarily but cannot or would prefer not to personally conceive. If adoption is deemed to be an appropriate course of action for any reason, steps should be taken towards it. Article One and Article Two consider adopted and biological children equally. Exceptions are not to be made to favour a biological child over an adopted one for any reason apart from those outlined in the Article Two.’” The zebra continued, nodding affirmatively as he went. “‘Article Four: If the presiding monarch wishes not to have children, they are allowed to select any creature as their successor. A referendum in all territories of the kingdom containing less a majority of non-yeti creatures will decide if that candidate is suitable. On succeeding in that referendum, they become the heir to the throne. If no heir is selected and accepted by the kingdom, the procedure outlined in Article Five is to begin.’”\n\nWith a proud huff at her work, the Storm Queen let Imamu catch his breath for a few moments before gesturing for him to continue.\n\n“Article Five: In cases where no heir is selected, available, able or willing to take the title of heir and subsequently ascend into the position of reigning monarch, a council of officers above the rank of Major and statescreatures who have been serving the crown for over fifteen years is to be assembled. Their responsibility will be to select a new monarch to take the throne.”\n\n“Not bad,” Ibyz managed quietly as she took the draft from his hooves, “I need to begin work on the candidate viability document.”\n\nHaving taken a sip of his rapidly cooling tea, Imamu quickly put his hoof on her arm with a serious look on his face. “What about you? Which route do you want to take?\n\nShe stood stock still for just a moment, then gave him the softest smile he’d seen to date."

SLC_collab_tree.41.d:0 "Imamu was hunched unhealthily over his desk, scrawling his signature seemingly every minute or so as he continued to hash out the fine print of Ibyz’s adoption efforts. It had taken a week or two to convince the various charities in the kingdom that the Storm Queen was serious about the idea, which had been as frustrating as much as painfully unsurprising. Her predecessor certainly wouldn’t have done anything like this, nor would he have bothered to prove his intentions by going to help out in a soup kitchen for a few days.\n\nNo sooner had he finished with one particularly laborious document than the familiarly heavy hoovesteps of Ibyz Icepaw could be heard approaching his study. And was that another-\n\nBefore he could finish that thought, the ornate handle of the door twisted quickly and was pushed open by a recognisably powerful hand. “Good evening Imamu. I am sorry for returning early, but I have important news.”\n\n“What do you-” He began to ask as he watched the Storm Queen walk into the room, losing his voice entirely as he noticed the yeti child that was holding her hand and hugging her double-jointed leg.\n\nFor the first time, the zebra was utterly lost for words. It almost looked like he was about to fall out of his chair until he stood up and took a few steps to the side in order to get a better look. The little thing - or at least, little relative to Ibyz - was too old for nursery but also too young to be even an early teenager. Her Majesty gave their hand a little squeeze and the child bravely shuffled forward letting Imamu study him briefly whilst processing the situation. Though the smell of the urchin’s obviously unwashed clothes didn’t help in that endeavour.\n\n“Kyrvaz, this is Imamu. He’s... my best friend. I have learned a lot from him.” She began slowly, letting them memorise each other’s appearance. “Imamu, this is Kyrvaz. I met him at the soup kitchen today and I will be adopting him, if he would like that.”\n\nThe shock induced by that statement fought with the annoyance of the possibly redundant paperwork and quickly won out, prompting a huff as the child nodded and smiled subtly. The zebra finally managed a warm smile in return as he cocked his head, noting that they were almost the same height as he finally turned back to the significantly taller Storm Queen.\n\nHe was most certainly still surprised at Her Majesty’s conviction in this particular child, but he managed to muster a chuckle at the absurdity of the situation."
SLC_collab_tree.41.a:0 ""Well, I'll still have to check his paperwork... if he has any.""

SLC_collab_tree.42.t:0 "A Quiet Little Night"
SLC_collab_tree.42.d:0 "Imamu sat reading a newspaper as the familiar sounds and smells of his friend’s marvellous cooking filled the air. He had to admit, Kyrvaz was actually quite cute now that he’d had a deep clean and the rags he called clothes had been replaced; though it was bizarre that even a pre-teen yeti was about as tall as he was and almost certainly stronger too. The tabloid was doing little to keep his mind away from the subject of Her Majesty’s impromptu adoption, but the tell-tale sound of warm crockery being taken out of the oven.\n\nBefore long the Storm Queen has served a gorgeous vegetable stew around the table, with some slow cooked steak chunks added in for the two omnivores of course.\n\n“Enjoy, “ She said simply as she finally sat down at her own seat, ruffling Kyrvaz’s hair gently as she went.\n\nThe food tasted exactly as good as it smelled. The sauce of the stew comprised a mix of gravy, just a little wine, the water and seasoning used to part-boil the vegetables that sat in it and a number of carefully chosen herbs. Imamu couldn’t help but share a look with Ibyz Icepaw as her adoptee wolfed down half of the meal, realising that he probably hadn’t had good quality or a good amount of food for a very long time. The little information that the zebra had found on the child painted a rather painful picture of his experiences living off of scraps for years.\n\nBefore Kyrvaz could finish the other half of his portion, the Storm Queen quickly cleared her throat. “I would like to apologise.”\n\nThe other two creatures at the table let their cutlery rest for a moment with raised eyebrows as the zebra made to ask, “What for?”\n\n“My reckless adoption,” She began, offering an apologetic smile to them both in sequence. “I do not regret it, but I regret making your lives even more chaotic. I care about you both.”\n\nIt was a short but clearly heartfelt apology and one that prompted Kyrvaz to get down from his seat and walk a little around the table in order to wrap his arms around Ibyz’s waist as best he could. Imamu could see the gears turning in his friend’s head as she slowly lowered the arms she had raised in mild surprise back down and around her ward, starting to slowly stroke his fur after a few moments. The Storm Queen slowly looked up at her friend with a smile that he recognised as a slightly confused but deep and genuine happiness.\n\nThe zebra stifled a coo at the adorable sight and chuckled before earnestly smiling back."

SLC_collab_tree.43.d:0 "To say that the paperwork was becoming no easier as time went on would have been an understatement, but at least Ibyz Icepaw could take some comfort in the presence of Kyrvaz at the other end of her kitchen table. His quiet company was surprisingly relaxing, even when he was scribbling away with a stick of graphite for what she could only assume would be a drawing of some sort. Unfortunately she was too focused to get up and take a look at what he was doodling for the time being, but the result would no doubt be a nice surprise for later.\n\nNo sooner had the Storm Queen taken a moment from her work than a sudden knock on the door subsequently earned her attention, “Enter.”\n\nGaz Boltrider gently opened the door and saluted, glancing at the drawings and failing to suppress both a look of mild surprise and a slight smirk. “Your Majesty. I have some news regarding the new divisions that you requested the formation of.”\n\n“Good, at ease.” She returned simply, looking up and seeing her subordinate stealing a look at Kyrvaz’s strewn pieces of paper. “How is his work? I haven’t seen it yet.”\n\n“Honestly, not bad at all. Your son’s got a knack for this I think, it’ll look impressive once he gets confident enough to line immediately after sketching.” She answered once relaxed, crouching down beside the little yeti with a warm smile and getting a better look at the drawings.\n\nAlthough she wouldn’t have discouraged a child lacking in artistic skill, Gaz hadn’t been joking in that statement. Sure the chicken-scratch pencil work was messy and sure the kid’s developing fine motor control made some of the details a little difficult to discern, but he clearly had some talent. The young yeti was also hoping for some affirmation of his work - or at least deserved some - as he put down the graphite and nervously sat on his hands.\n\n“I... Uhm... Thank you, ma’am.” Kyrvaz managed quietly whilst averting his gaze from the Captain and instead looking up at Ibyz, unsure of how to respond to the praise.\n\nThe Storm Queen glanced at the officer and they shared a grin as the former leaned in to speak, “The heir to the throne is only subordinate to the ruling monarch, little one. She should be calling you ‘sir’.”\n\n“Apologies, Your Majesty. I will refer to His Highness with the proper decorum in the future.” Gaz cut in quickly with a wide smile, causing the little yeti to immediately flush with adorable embarrassment."

It’s almost a shame to give the infantry a way to outrun their own support again.” Vurka Stormfall finished with a chuckle before clearing his throat.\n\nThe Storm Queen studied the equipment dossier as well as the performance overviews for a few moments, leaving the council of officers in silence until she spoke again. “Good. Thank you Major. I am pleased by this news. I’d like to hear next about the procurement and distribution of...”\n\nAnd so the conversation continued for a while, bouncing energetically between various officers and Ibyz Icepaw as some plans were hashed out and others were updated. Almost nobody noticed as the door to the war room quietly opened and Kyrvaz stepped through behind the assembled creatures. It was surprisingly easy for him to approach the table without being noticed, only receiving some quizzical looks and somewhat subtle waves from the storm creatures on guard.\n\n“...which is concerning. Our capital city is on an island. Patrolling and protecting the strait that connects that island to the mainland is crucial. An outdated navy is-” The Storm Queen stopped all of a sudden and looked down.\n\nThe little yeti had reached out to grab one of her hands from below and just to the side of her, immediately derailing Ibyz’s train of thought and causing her to simply stand there dumbfounded for a few seconds. The room had gone completely silent, although not out of annoyance; more simply surprise at the situation. None of the creatures present had seen the Storm Queen stop dead in the middle of a meeting like this, nor had many even met the heir to the throne as of yet.\n\nJust as Kyrvaz was beginning to shy away from the attentive silence, Ibyz shook her head a little and carefully picked up her son. With a little manoeuvring he was sitting comfortably in one arm, facing the rest of the room and smiling happily with an arm around his adoptive mother.\n\nHe gave the rest of the room a little wave with his free hand and spoke quietly, “Sorry for interrupting, everyone.”\n\nThe general staff all murmured some kind of acceptance as they contained everything in the range of mild annoyance to glee at the sight. Even the frustrated ones would have privately admittedly that seeing Ibyz with her son was a sigh of relief from a political perspective; nobody wanted another civil war, after all. It helped that the crown prince was - loath some they might be to admit it - also rather sweet."

Dress uniforms were never particularly easy to wear - especially when you had as much fur as most yetis did - but at least the temperature was rarely an issue. At the very least, the sweat seeping into the rich fabric would be invisible to those attending the Storm Queen’s speech. In fact, the weather would make the whole event a little easier to attend for the masses; though that wasn’t going to make fitting a faux uniform onto a pre-teen any easier.\n\nIbyz Icepaw looked away from the mirror as Imamu entered the room, her gaze shifting between him and Kyrvaz by her side. “Good afternoon. Could you please give me a hand?”\n\n“I’d happily lend a hoof, Your Majesty.” The zebra returned with a little chuckle as he saw the heir to the throne struggling with buttons, “Not used to doing up buttons, I see.”\n\n“No, not really.” The little yeti admitted sheepishly, “I’ve been practising though! It’s... still tricky. How do you do it with hooves?”\n\nWith a warm smile, Imamu got to work on the shirt whilst slinging the blazer over his shoulder for the time being. “Now you’re asking the tricky questions, aren’t you? I’ll tell you when you’re older.”\n\nThe Storm Queen let out a subtle huff of satisfaction as she looked over her own uniform in the mirror, checking the positions of medals and her general appearance. Once satisfied she took a knee next to Kyrvaz and began tucking in the shirt that had just been buttoned from the other side doing her best not to pinch his fur as she went. The zebra had already moved onto the blazer and was putting His Highness’ other arm through the sleeves as Ibyz’s work on the shirt quickly finished.\n\n“By the way,” Imamu began as he started work on the second set of buttons, “Are you sure he’s going to be visible over the balcony railings? I know he’s not small but the palace was built with your predecessor in mind.”\n\nThe much larger of the two yetis paused for a moment, having just pinned the last of the thankfully few medals to her son’s chest. “I am not sure, but I can be.”\n\nTaking a few steps back after making the odd adjustment, the zebra watched as Ibyz picked Kyrvaz and sat him on her shoulders. The whole movement made it seem as though His Highness weighed nothing at all, which was a bizarrely adorable sight.\n\nImamu contained a coo and gestured towards the door to the palace’s balcony, “When you’re ready, you two.”"

As they turned around a corner, they saw a zebra stallion cornered and cowering in fear in front of a yeti with a gun.

Of particular interest to [ROOT.GetLeader] were the annexes dedicated to displaying the progress that had been made in cooperation with the other cultures contained within the borders of the Storm Kingdom.\n\nThe space allocated to the Hayzeb was the smallest but that was largely the result of the relatively small number of creatures that had felt the nation’s positive influence, or so the many displays claimed. Nevertheless there was a substantial gallery of photos that displayed the yetis military building homes, businesses uplifting the impoverished and the police cracking down on the supposedly corrupt local nobility. The pictures were taken for show of course, but it was difficult to pick out any that looked deliberately staged.\n\n[ROOT.GetLeader] was particularly surprised by the prototype of an enormous drilling machine which had been positioned squarely in the middle of the area reserved for the Hyenians. It had apparently been designed in large part by them and produced by the yetis, making it a true monument to industrial and technological cooperation. Actually, it could really have been a monument for its size alone; though that would have been a little unfair to its supposed social and economic significance.\n\nThe rooms containing everything regarding the Uzerasi and the Zwahile were the most in-depth, containing everything from endorsements of lower nobles to several articles written by Imamu himself; the zebra that would have ruled the region were it not for the Storm Kingdom. It was quite difficult to imagine someone of such importance not just tolerating yeti rule but actively supporting and collaborating with it in its most unstable years, but that had evidently come to pass. What kind of madness or favouritism could encourage a creature to take such a stance, [ROOT.GetLeader] could only guess. Perhaps this zebra’s relationship with the Storm Queen was even more unique than that, though it certainly seemed unlikely.\n\nAll in all the experience was a pleasant distraction from the slightly overbearing atmosphere of the conference. It seemed like roughly sixty percent of nations that had been offered attendance were intending on being present, which wasn’t a bad showing for the yetis. It seemed like some progress would indeed be made in the coming days."
SLC_collab_tree.51.a:0 "Perhaps the yetis truly are turning over a new leaf."

SLC_collab_tree.52.t:0 "The Talks"
SLC_collab_tree.52.d:0 "As the other delegates began to settle at the bizarrely shaped conference table, the Storm Queen stood in the middle of the assembly and looked around with what one might have described as a smile. A subtle one, certainly; but something was there. Supposedly this meeting would be the one in which the suffering inflicted by this yeti’s predecessor would be at least partially rectified, or rather that was simply what [ROOT.GetLeader] had been told by others that they had spoken to.\n\nThe towering creature waited for all of the attendees to take their seats and quieten down before clearing her throat, “Good afternoon to you all. I hope you have all enjoyed the exhibition of the successes we have achieved in the wake of the Storm King’s chaotic and bloody succession. The reason I wished to display the progress that I have made alongside my subjects is simple: I wanted to provide evidence of my intentions so when I shortly offer a proposal it appears as genuine as it is, otherwise I fear it may have seemed too good to be true.”\n\nSome murmurs emerged around the almost-circular table between national leaders and their advisors, occasionally even between leaders. The exhibition certainly had been reassuring, even though a few of the delegates truly just wanted to get this event over with. Those same creatures were the ones making the most noise now as the Storm Queen patiently waited for calm to return to the audience that she had assembled.\n\n“My proposition is simple: I am prepared to offer the nations over which you preside financial compensation and the return of as many culturally significant artefacts which are state-owned as can be identified. How will this effect the Storm Kingdom? It will slow our growth to a crawl whilst payments are being made, but not stop it entirely. How much compensation is available? Sadly our means are limited, but we are prepared to subsidise roughly one-and-a-half percent of each present state’s yearly budget. Have those that refused to attend this conference forfeited the right to this compensation scheme? Yes, they have.”\n\nAlmost immediately, creatures started asking questions regarding the economic feasibility of these plans. Those who didn’t have anything to say directly to the yeti at the table’s centre began to discuss amongst one another whether the deal was worth accepting or if it was some kind of ploy to make themselves economically dependent on a successor to the Storm King. A few seemingly took offence at the mere suggestion and got up to leave on the spot.\n\n[ROOT.GetLeader] simply sat there and wondered what the correct course of action was. Their host certainly seemed to be genuinely well meaning..."
SLC_collab_tree.52.a:0 "If all this is true, we would do well to accept what she is offering."
SLC_collab_tree.52.b:0 "A good speech, but far from convincing."

SLC_collab_tree.53.t:0 "Her Majesty's Thanks"
SLC_collab_tree.53.d:0 "Dear [ROOT.GetLeader], head of state of [ROOT.GetNameDef],\n\nI have been informed of your decision to formally accept the proposal laid out during the Great Zebrican Summit. Whilst I cannot currently spare the time to thank you in person, I intend to show you my appreciation and thanks with the proper decorum in this letter.\n\nMy predecessor was not a creature deserving of praise and I hope that in spite of the latent pride my kind has for his successes, my personal opinion on the madyeti is clear. I have nothing but respect for the many creatures who survived his wrath and remorse for those that did not. I did not simply avoid fighting in his wars for the future stability of the realm, but also because I did not support their objectives and the destruction that was left in their wake.\n\nIt is my hope that the economic restitution that the Storm Kingdom will shortly be providing for you and for many other attendees of the GZS will go some way to retroactively undo the damage caused. There is nothing I or anyone can do now to undo the emotional trauma endured by your creatures, but it is my duty to the burgeoning international community to try.\n\nTo end this letter, I would like to offer my gratitude for attending and accepting this titanic diplomatic and economic effort as a means of national apology for the crimes committed against your people. I wish you and those for whom you are responsible the best of luck in the coming years, whatever challenges they may bring.\n\nMay those that have come before regard you well,\n\nThe Storm Queen"

SLC_collab_tree.54.d:0 "“Alright, I’m going to give you a little advice.” The zebra gave out with a huff as he hoofed over some small card slips.\n\nThe Storm Queen took the thick paper in her hands and looked at the notes that he had prepared for the coming speeches on her behalf. There were a lot of good things in here that she would hopefully use for any impromptu meetings she might have with guests, amongst other things. When she looked back at Imamu he was sitting on his hindlegs and frowning up at her, clearly thinking about something.\n\nHe tapped his chin for a moment and huffed before speaking, “When you get a moment, you should try to control your breathing. I know you’re used to the adrenaline being good for you in the moment, but a stress-induced adrenaline rush here is only going to cause problems. You’re dealing with more creatures than you ever have before all at once, so it’s important that you avoid it if possible.”\n\nIbyz Icepaw cocked her head for a moment, then nodded. “I agree. Continue.”\n\n“It goes like this: Breathe in for four seconds.” He began, doing as described. “Hold for eight seconds,” The zebra went on, “Breeeathe out for four seconds,” He added with a deep exhale, “Then hold for another eight and repeat. Does that make sense? Closing your eyes can help, but obviously you don’t want to do that in view of your guests. I also don’t know how difficult it is to stand up with your eyes closed when you have two legs so... take that with a pinch of salt.”\n\n“Noted.” The Storm Queen returned with a simple nod, “My heart rate is currently elevated. May I try this technique now?”\n\n“You’re the Queen, you don’t have to ask me for permission to breathe slowly.” Imamu gave out with a befuddled laugh.\n\nThe towering yeti nodded and adjusted her shawl before doing exactly as she’d been instructed, holding a hand to her chest in order to feel the process’ effects. The surprise at how effective it truly was must have been visible on her face because she could see the zebra grinning out of the corner of her eye, though she wasn’t going to let that distract her. On for another minute she went until her heart rate was satisfactorily low.\n\n“This should be taught everywhere.” Ibyz eventually expressed with a calm sigh.\n\nThe zebra could only nod somewhat solemnly in response before lifting his head to respond with a smile, “Let’s leave changing the curriculum until after we’ve spoken to a third of this continent’s leaders, shall we?”"
SLC_collab_tree.54.a:0 "The guests were mere days away."

SLC_collab_tree.55.t:0 "Cold As Ice"
SLC_collab_tree.55.d:0 "The Storm Queen was standing at attention near the entrance of the Great Zebrican Summit’s exhibition wing, mentally preparing to speak to the hundreds of foreign dignitaries she would likely be meeting and speaking to throughout the day.\n\nIt was a little bizarre to finally be simply standing and doing so little when she had spent the last few weeks organising and managing the setup of this event for it to be exactly as she had imagined it. Undoing the damage to her entire species’ international prestige had always been a long-term goal of hers and this was a first monumental step in the right direction. Nonetheless, the sudden internal silence as she stood watching subordinates make the very last minute preparations just out of sight of the front entrance was strangely uncomfortable.\n\nA minute more and Ibyz Icepaw had remembered the breathing trick that Imamu had taught her, quickly closing her eyes and taking a deep breath as she adjusted her suave military suit for the hundredth time in the last ten minutes or so. Meditation had been a part of basic training for her and other soldiers of her era as it was supposed to calm you before a melee pockmarked by gunfire in which you needed all of your wits. It hadn’t seemed to do much then or when she first saw combat, which is why she found it so surprising that the zebra's simple guidance was so effective in comparison.\n\n“Your Majesty?” A yeti timidly gave out, evidently unsure of whether or not to disturb her.\n\nHer eyes shot open and narrowed, but the Storm Queen’s expression and voice remained almost unnervingly calm. “Yes?”\n\n“The guests are going to begin arriving in a few minutes, Your Majesty.” The nervous creature added quickly, “The route is clear and there haven’t been any hiccups so far. I’m told the horses are being very complimentary of the appropriately large car seats.”\n\nThe nervous sincerity of the statement and the oddly relatable nature of its contents contrasting a moment of her own anxiety prompted a reaction from Ibyz that the assistant would surely never see again: a chuckle. The yeti departed quickly into the wings after receiving a nod, no doubt to tell stories of the true rarity that he had witnessed as the monarch ran a hand through the thick fur that could still be reached over the collar of her blazer.\n\nThe Storm Queen was still standing at attention as the vehicles began to arrive, but she certainly felt more at ease."
SLC_collab_tree.55.a:0 "She would manage for a few weeks."

SLC_collab_tree.56.t:0 "Exhausting the Storm Queen"
SLC_collab_tree.56.d:0 "It was very rare for the Storm Queen to find herself truly exhausted after so many years of intensive military service, but that was how she felt at this moment.\n\nShutting the thin wooden door to her temporary accommodation, she took one look at the carefully prepared space and decided to head straight for the bedroom. It was too difficult to hold back a yawn as she carefully undid the blazer of the military dress uniform and loosened the black tie underneath, fiddling with the buttons of her shirt as she sat down on the edge of the shockingly comfortable bed. It wasn’t long before she gave up with the buttons and simply laid down to rest, her tired mind buzzing with the hundreds of conversations that she’d had earlier in the day.\n\nIbyz Icepaw wasn’t used to this kind of attention. Foreign dignitaries she could manage, even large parties were on the table thanks to her exposure to the Uzerasi. A collection of the most important creatures on the continent? That had proven to be too much. She sighed and lifted her calloused fingers to her face, wiping away a small amount of sweat and grunting heavily as she sunk into the mattress. She felt certain that a hastily erected building like this shouldn’t have been so comfortable, yet compared to the activity of the day the furniture might as well have been woven out of silk and velvet.\n\nIt had felt as though she was being constantly bombarded by characters that were somewhere on a scale between scared senseless and absolutely furious, having to answer a litany of questions that were being asked by creatures who were rightfully very sceptical. Frankly that was far more stressful than commanding armies and participating in battles during the civil war had ever been; maybe even more strenuous than any of the conflicts she’s participated in up to this point, including her first.\n\nThe typically stoic yeti turned onto her side and closed her eyes, letting her stonefacedness slip away as she gripped the two thin pillows under her head for just a moment.\n\nDespite everything, the exhaustion was something to be proud of. Very few creatures could or would have taken the great strides that she was currently, let alone the ruler of the Storm Kingdom. If Imamu was here he would no doubt have praised her efforts, even if he did so under the guise of a joke. Probably a bad joke - at least by her standards - but a joke nonetheless. It was a shame he’d had to handle other matters in the Zwahile in the middle of the Great Zebrican Summit.\n\nIn the moment before Ibyz fell into a deep slumber whilst wearing most of her uniform, she couldn’t help but wonder how her father would justify not speaking to her after this."

SLC_collab_tree.57.d:0 "Vozkh sighed as he finished another set of numbers, filing away the pile of papers before moving onto the next but not before massaging his temple in frustration. "I don't know what's worse; the amount of paperwork the summit is making us do or the amount of money the kingdom is going to have to spend on reparations." He turned towards his colleague as the latter chuckled.\n\n"Ah, don't think of it like that Vozkh." Rakarr gave a toothy grin. "For what it's worth the success of the Great Zebrican Summit is pretty exciting news; I don't know about you but it's really lifting up spirits back home. Like things really are changing for the better, y'know?" Rakarr looked around the busy office: despite how busy the yeti and zebra clerks alike were, there certainly was a sense of enthusiasm in the air.\n\nVozkh rolled his eyes. "Yes that's nice and all...but the kingdom is going to have to pay millions if not billions for all that, and who knows what kind of effect that’ll have on the economy." Despite his earlier attempt to relax a little Vozkh was already back to crunching the numbers inside his head. "It's a silver lining that only 65% of all Storm King-affected nations went through with the summit: imagine the costs if every country agreed!"\n\nRakarr scoffed. "It's not always about the money you know?" He looked between Vozkh and the rest of the office. "The fact that roughly two-thirds of all affected nations decided to bury the hatchet is what really matters. Maybe now other creatures won't look at us with so much fear."\n\n"It's still going to cost a lot..." Vozkh grumbled, making Rakarr take his turn to roll his eyes."
SLC_collab_tree.57.a:0 "A great step forward for the Storm Kingdom."

SLC_collab_tree.58.t:0 "Tea Time"
SLC_collab_tree.58.d:0 "Imamu quietly sipped his tea as he watched Kyrvaz play with a wooden train set on the carpet a few metres away. The Storm Queen had been quite clear in her instructions to never let him out of sight completely for more than ten minutes at a time, so he was doing his best to keep track of the ‘little’ yeti whilst reading a paper to pass the time. As he lifted the paper back up again with a smile on his snout, the zebra barely registered the sound of him slowly standing up and sauntering over to the table.\n\n“Uncle, can I try some?” He asked timidly, smiling a little too toothily for comfort.\n\nThe zebra nearly lept out of his seat, still not used to relative silence with which yetis would walk in combination with just how much lighter his nephew was. “Oh goodness... I practically jumped out of my skin!”\n\n“Sorry!” Kyrvaz quickly gave out in response and shrunk back a little, though by now that wasn’t enough to make him shorter than Imamu. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to make you jump. Mum always knows where I am so I’m not used to people being surprised. I don’t know how she does it.”\n\nAs he leaned back in his chair, the elder of the two creatures processed the initial question whilst also nodding at the observation of the Storm Queen’s spatial awareness. His nephew wanted to try his tea? The yeti tea that was so bitter he’d spent months trying to acclimatise to it? That would make for some playful revenge for his suddenly broken sense of calm, no doubt. He sat up with an unusually devious smile and nodded, pushing the tea in his direction carefully.\n\n“It’s alright. And yes, you may try the tea; although it’s a little warm.” The zebra returned with a bright smile. “Drink it from the other side, if you don’t mind.”\n\nThe yeti nodded eagerly and took the tiny teacup in both hands, turning it around in his grasp and taking a very slow sip. The visceral reaction that Imamu had been expecting never came, instead being surprised a second time as he watched Kyrvaz’s face light up. That couldn’t be right, surely? It must be some kind of practical joke.\n\n“Wow, it’s a lot sweeter than I was expecting? I like it though!” He expressed gleefully, ears perking up as he set down the cup again and heard the tell-tale hoofsteps of his adoptive mother approaching the room.\n\nImamu took another bewildered sip for himself just to double check that it was as bitter as he remembered it being and turned to look at the door just as the Storm Queen entered through it. She hugged her son and raised an eyebrow at her friend’s expression of exasperated yet bemused confusion as the smaller yeti giggled, but neither had a chance to ask about or elaborate on it before he made his thoughts known."

SLC_collab_tree.59.t:0 "A Little Surprise"
SLC_collab_tree.59.d:0 "Closing the bulletproof door of the all-black state car that was responsible for transporting him safely to and from school, Kyrvaz sighed and began to walk up the steps and towards one of the many back entrances of the palace. Catching up on everything he had missed was tiring, even if he understood why he needed a lot of the knowledge. It helped that he’d made a few genuine friends in spite of his status as heir apparent to the Storm Kingdom, although they couldn’t be present when the time came to take his catch-up exams of course.\n\nShifting his grip on the work folders that his adoptive mother had lovingly prepared for him - dividers and all - he unlocked and opened the heavy wooden door that he’d been walking towards. It felt like another day of unbelievable luck for him, to go from trudging through the streets to now walking down a corridor that was still almost unfathomably wealthy in its construction alone. The recurring thought made him shrink a little in his uniform out of humility as he headed through the open door of the surprisingly dark dining room.\n\nAll of a sudden, the lights flicked on and almost a hundred voices cried “Happy birthday!”\n\nKyrvaz stopped dead in his tracks as he did his best to process the noise as well as all the faces of the creatures that had been waiting for him. He recognised all of the faces from the generals to the tutors to some of his school friends and their parents and of course Imamu and the Storm Queen.\n\nHe had barely finished taking in the scene as Ibyz Icepaw approached him and the group began to slowly disperse with laughs and smiles all around. “Happy birthday, son.”\n\nHe looked up at the towering yeti with abject confusion painted all across his face, “I... Uhm, w-what? We don’t know when my b-birthday was, do we?”\n\n“No, we do not.” She replied simply, thinking for a moment in an effort to pick the right words. “But you were still born. Not knowing when is not a good reason to entirely avoid a celebration that we all get to enjoy. Do you want today to be your birthday?”\n\nThe Storm Queen kneeled down so that they could share a warm hug as the frown on Kyrvaz’s face slowly faded. He had expectedly been overwhelmed almost immediately, which made her glad for the decision not to get any party poppers. She could already feel him nodding into her shawl as he held on tightly for a moment or two before letting go to look around again.\n\n“I... would like that very much.” he responded quietly, beaming like the sun as he caught a glimpse of the school friends he’d been thinking about mere moments ago. “I love you so much mum.”\n\nAs the little yeti prepared himself to say hello to all of the guests, Ibyz smiled softly."

SLC_collab_tree.60.d:0 "It was cold, but neither of them felt it. Yetis were made to withstand the harsh temperatures of mountainsides like these; letting the Storm Queen and her heir apparent simply relax, sitting quietly outside of a coffee shop that had been built above the clouds. The amount of infrastructure even over the peaks that surrounded the Eye of the Storm was truly impressive. Kyrvaz was relaxedly sipping his own cup of tea as they looked over the sprawling city at the hoof of the mountain. It was beautiful when the clouds were thin or sporadic enough to let you see through them, though there was a question on his mind taking away from the sight.\n\n“Mum, why are we here? I haven’t forgotten a special day, have I?” He asked politely, smiling all the while.\n\n“You haven’t,” Ibyz quickly confirmed, shaking her head just a little. “Though it is an important day for you. This view is to help me explain something to you. Are you comfortable?”\n\n“Hold on,” Suddenly attentive of both the view and his mother, Kyrvaz sat up straight and put down his mostly finished tea on the table between them. “Yes, I am; please continue.”\n\nThe Storm Queen nodded and closed her eyes for a moment, waiting seemingly for nothing before she spoke. “This is how running the kingdom feels to me. I look down at the creatures I rule from a mountain that I was not aware I had climbed until everyone around me already looked small. I did not come from poverty or negligence, but I broke the one family tie I still had left to start the ascent. It was so slow that I only turned around to look at where I had come from when I was already at the top. My perspective is that of an outsider, whether I care for my kind or not.”\n\n“You’ve told me that before, in pieces here and there.” Kyrvaz responded slowly, now firmly focused on the details of the city below she spoke.\n\nIbyz sighed solemnly, taking a pause as she glanced at her worn fingers. “But you... are different, in a good way. You are not innocent, but you have not taken innocence from others like I have. You know what it means to struggle because of things outside of your control. You suffered the world whilst I suffered myself. I want you to remember that when you are in my position. I want you to remember the roads you slept on and the food you scavenged. I want you to use the perspective that I do not have to rule as I cannot.”\n\nFor a while they both sat in silence as the heir apparent frowned and continued to gaze upon the Eye of the Storm, occasionally moving his head to see around the cloud cover as best he could from the chair in which he was sat.\n\nAfter a moment, the quiet voice of His Highness broke the blanket of tranquillity that had descended. “Do you think I’ll be a good ruler?”\n\n“You will be better than me.” Came the unwaveringly confident response.\n\nKyrvaz beamed a smile as he turned back to face the Storm Queen,"

SLC_collab_tree.61.d:0 "The Storm Queen closed the heavy wooden doors behind her and stepped into her dimly-lit quarters, heading over to the living room and almost immediately falling into the rich cushions of a fireplace-facing settee. Though tired, she couldn’t help but feel oddly at peace as she sunk into the furniture.\n\nFor once it felt like the request not to be disturbed unless it was absolutely necessary might actually result in her not being dragged out of bed at some agonising hour. She hadn’t been running around fighting fires in the same way that she used to for quite some time, often only to pass information or instructions on to the institutions she had built. Though there was a lot of satisfaction in seeing any well-oiled machine running so smoothly, the bureaucracy she established proving functional enough to give her some peace and quiet was a pleasant side-effect in its own right.\n\nNow Ibyz Icepaw was steadily remembering what it was like to have free time on her hands, which was as bizarre as it was pleasant. She had missed being able to experiment with recipes and having a decent night’s sleep with any consistency whatsoever.\n\nWith a toothy and unusually optimistic smile, the Storm Queen sat up and looked at the picture sitting on the coffee table in front of her. She cocked her head just a little and reached out to pick it up, studying it more closely and resting her arms on her lap. It was a colour photograph of herself, Imamu and Kyrvaz from roughly chest level; although Imamu was sitting on multiple boxes to achieve a position between the yetis who were both significantly taller than him. Kyrvaz might end up taller than her at some point, which was bizarre to think about in and of itself.\n\nWith a heavy sigh - both of relief and simply out of a desire to rest - the picture fell from her hands into her lap as Ibyz sunk into the settee once more. There was a strange sense of satisfaction to the feeling of the fabric that she didn’t recognise, almost as though she had finally come home from work after a job well done. A job of many years and enormous struggle, but a job well done nonetheless.\n\nWas this what it felt like to feel satisfied with work that was finished?\n\nIt had been more than a decade of jumping from one problem to the next, only taking a moment to look at the bigger picture when sitting down with her best friend or her son. Her predecessor’s legacy was mostly erased, or at least modified in such a way that what remained wouldn’t cause future issues. No threats remained that could truly hurt yetikind without monumental and focused effort. No creature was unrepresented, even if they did not have the final say over the governance of their own lands.\n\nSoon enough the Storm Queen found herself falling asleep on the cushions, sitting awkwardly and absentmindedly lifting the photograph to her chest as though it were a pillow or a teddy-bear."

To celebrate our newfound friendship the Storm Queen has already sent troops, advisors, construction crews and more to aid in the rebuilding of our war-torn lands." The crowded bar filled with gargoyles and centaurs alike was silent as they listened to the voice on the radio speak about their new lot under the yetis, shocked looks and grunts of disapproval were shared between the two races.\n\n"They really think that will keep us down?" A loud centaur complained, letting out a curse as he put too much pressure on his bandaged hind leg while standing up. "I speak for everyone when I say it will take much more than that before we let those abominable snowmen walk all over us!" He smiled a little as the rest of the bar cheered at his words, only for the radio to crackle again, the collaborator’s words coming from it silencing the room.\n\n"Furthermore, the Storm Queen in her eternal benevolence has decided to enshrine many new reforms and protections in this new nation, applying to all who currently reside in it in respect of the gargoyle and centaur people. We will list them down shortly." As the radio began to share the new laws the room's hostility - while still present - wasn't as strong as before.\n\n"This doesn't change anything!" The same centaur shouted, "Remember! The yetis want to subjugate us, so we will not be fooled by any of their tricks!"

Checkpoints and patrols were still required with the protectorate technically existing as it's own state. The garrison patrolling the sleepy road to Xadka Dabka were reminded of their duty as a dinky truck approached from the east, slowing down and stopping as one of the yeti soldiers walked up. "Hello sir." The yeti greeted with a smile as a gargoyle exited the vehicle. "Going to visit the hyenas? We just need to see your papers."\n\n"Y-Yes." The gargoyle answered. "I have your "papers", yes." He started to shuffle through his pockets, earning a few glances from the other soldiers and building upon his anxiety. Before they could assume the worst he fished out a decent amount of coins, placing them in the yeti's hand and taking a step back.\n\nThe yeti looked at the coins in confusion. "What's this?"\n\nFear shot across the gargoyle's face, he grabbed more coins. "I-I'm so sorry sir! I don't want any trouble."\n\nJust as he was about to fill the soldier's hands the yeti stopped him. "Hey! Calm down, I don't want your money!"\n\nThe gargoyle froze. "What do you want then?"\n\n"Your travelling papers," He bluntly stated. "Just show them and if they are in order it's all good." The gargoyle calmed down only a little but at least he handed over some papers. The yeti nodded as he flipped through them. "Yup, all good. You can go on sir."\n\n"Really? You aren't going to extort me?"\n\n"No sir," The yeti hid his silent offense. "your papers are all you need to travel the border." Relief washed over his fur once the gargoyle finally seemed to understand and returned to his truck. As he drove away one of the yeti's fellow soldiers gave him a pat on the back with a chuckle."

The air - as always - was almost electric, buzzing with the energy of tens of eager elected and appointed representatives from all across the kingdom and its client states. Even the gargoyles and the centaurs had come prepared with stacks of paperwork, although they certainly didn’t look as eager as some of their new co-workers from the Great Lakes or Hyenia.\n\nThe Storm Queen cleared her throat as the other creatures sat down again, “The first order of business is economics. I have read your reports and I am pleased. There are problems, however. I’m sure you’re about to tell me about them. This subject will now go to the floor.”\n\nHer gavel had barely hit the podium before the room exploded with questions, requests and just about anything else that the delegates wanted or needed to talk about. The cacophony seemingly sent the gargoyles and the centaurs into a mild state of shock as they simply let it all happen around them with wide eyes. Perhaps the most surprising part for them was that Ibyz Icepaw was taking notes of what they were saying, to the best of her ability. Some proposals she did negotiate or outright reject, but many were finding their way onto the pad of paper underneath her right hand.\n\nIt wasn’t long before the room was much quieter, although still quite busy now that several sets of representatives were now re-drafting proposals instead of trying to be heard over one another. The new arrivals still hadn’t said a word however, which prompted the Storm Queen to turn to them once all the other creatures had returned to their desks. The icy gaze of a creature forged in war was still present, but it was tempered by something. It was impossible to say what, but there was a conciliatory calmness with which Her Majesty approached every conversation that seemed quite alien to her military nature.\n\n“Representatives of Gargiloya and Senturya,” She began, pointing at them with the gavel in her non-dominant hand for a moment. “You have brought a larger selection of documents than any other attendee.

SLC_collab_tree.65.d:0 "To say the newly formed Riseian protectorate is 'stable' would be a grave misuse of the word, any order within the region ceased to exist once the original native governments capitulated to us and the new governorate was created. Strife was inevitable with so many different creatures and cultures under one banner, only and barely united in their hatred for the yeti occupiers. With the near-anarchy the region was in however, a unified resistance is barely present as horses clash against fellow horses while others simply try to find safety in an increasingly dangerous land.\n\nIronically this sordid state of affairs is actually proving to be quite the boon for our hoofs on the grounds as they have been using the chaos to reinforce and expand their zones of control as per the orders from the Queen, even restoring order in a few areas. This has led to the latter group of horses who want nothing to do with the fighting come to us for sanctuary, showing no resistance and sometimes even outright cooperating as we give them a place of rest and some peace.\n\nIf this trend continues we'll likely stabilize the entire state within a short time period, bringing much-wanted order and possibly more helping hooves than those raised in revolt as we start to build a functional administration for this land. In the meantime however our soldiers will have to hold on to their rifles tight as it will be some months before the east calms down a little. At the very least we have made a good start, enough to soon bring complete order and stability to our new protectorate."

Not to forget they made a quick end to all that chaos back near the end of the war. Masaak never thought he would be grateful to reach a yeti safe zone and he couldn't be more delighted when they were expanded all across the land.\n\nHe was thrown out of his thoughts as he heard someone enter the room. Masaak smiled as he spotted his daughter. "Wasih my dear! Was your stomach grumbling or did you miss your old stallion that much?" His smile started to strain as Wasih took her time to give a response, the teenage horse looking at the food with glaring eyes.\n\n"You're still working with those cave dwellers huh?" Before Masaak could answer, Wasih continued. "Seriously dad, how can you do that after what they did to us? You always told me about how terrible they were back when they first rampaged across here but now you're working for them?"\n\n"Things are different nowadays Wasih..." Masaak tried to explain.

I would appreciate you telling me.”\n\n“Alright,” He began, almost certain that this was the first time his friend had taken a moment to rest for several weeks. “Well to put it simply, The Mazwian gold mines have been blown up. Someone got their hooves on dynamite and most of the entrances collapsed, although apparently the damage isn’t so severe that the mines can’t be reopened. Frankly I’m quite surprised that security was so relaxed.”\n\n“I intentionally assigned ex-imperial soldiers to the security detail.” Ibyz returned with a subtle smile, gradually sitting up in her seat.\n\nThat statement both surprised and concerned Imamu, which it probably shouldn’t have given their no longer uneasy alliance. Still, being reminded that his friend was no slouch when it came to scheming in domestic policy was not something he’d expected out of this conversation; much less something he wanted to remember whilst relaxing in a particularly comfortable chair.\n\n“If they do their duty it alienates the population from their old state institutions,” The Storm Queen began to elaborate, letting the friendly smile on her lips fall away as the calculating ruler returned. “Otherwise the region’s economic base collapses and they rely on the outside for assistance. They will beg my kingdom for help.”\n\nThe zebra squirmed uncomfortably in his seat as Ibyz sat looking at him attentively, having fully awoken from what must have been a mere thirty-minute nap. It took her a few moments to realise how uncomfortable she was making him, then a few moments more to actually relax her posture in such a way that she was no longer looming over him. In hindsight the yeti must have seemed like an evil genius laying out her grand and unstoppable plan to a creature that could do nothing to halt it, which in some ways wasn’t far from the truth.\n\nClearing her throat, she made to speak as she returned to a position of comfort in her seat. “My apologies.

It reminded him of the Zwahile before Ibyz Icepaw had settled in the region and built it up to be a region of relative stability and industrial potency, yet she had not had wholly positive impacts. For all of the development the region now enjoyed, it was highly centralised under yeti rule as a result of being torn away from the control of the Uzerasi and indeed the Mazwi before them. Modernity and peace did not come without conditions when dealing with the Storm Queen.\n\nThe zebra in pink and purple robes hummed for a moment, before sitting upright. “Because it is what she gave to me. It is what she gave to the Zwahile, to Hyenia and to the rest of her kingdom as well. For what is lost in independence and the right to dictate your own laws, we have all gained in prosperity and relative peace. Even then, many regions receive special privileges in the way of religious freedoms and the right to represent yourself before Her Majesty. It may look like all is lost - and I know that it’s hard not to see it that way sometimes - but she tells no lies.”\n\nWith an inscrutable snort, the chief shook his head. “I would not have expected a peaceful leader to invade the great lakes.”\n\n“A fair point,” Imamu conceded, raising a hoof as he went on. “But what would you do in her horseshoes? The Storm King created so many enemies for her kind that you can understand her desire to establish buffer territories in the pursuit of safety for those that serve her willingly. It is a logical conclusion.”\n\n“So we are unwitting shields for our new masters?” The zebra retorted with a grimace.\n\nThey sat in silence for a little while. The once-heir to the throne of the Uzerasi Kingdom hadn’t the heart to try and poke holes in very reasonable objections. He remembered being in this position very well and wasn’t overly fond of being reminded of the situation in which he had ended up, even though his people did now enjoy prosperity and general living standards that they had never experienced before.\n\nAll of a sudden, the chief piped up again. “Yet here before me sits a prince, begging me to bend the knee to the despot who kept him from rulership; she must be doing something right.

Much of the Zwahile had similar religious inclinations to the Great Lakes as a whole; yet mercantilist and materialistic as it was, the Uzerasi Kingdom only rarely became involved with religion. The nobles and merchants themselves ascribed to faith very similarly to the population as a whole in that respect, though it was often hard for them to see much in their faith when they were exposed to so many others. Lip service for temples was usually about as far as it went.\n\nBeing friends with a yeti that was equally uninterested in religious matters as his peers certainly didn’t help to broaden his knowledge on the subject either. Even so, it was fortunately fairly common knowledge that the creatures of Macigena were deeply religious.\n\n“Rise, Imamu of the Uzerasi.” The recently appointed Tarkhan gave out after an extended moment of silence, clearly a little out of his depth. “God has blessed you with a safe journey to our burned lands and we will not desecrate that kindness.”\n\nThe guest rose from his deep bow and smiled gently, “Thank you. It is an honour to be received within these hallowed halls; it is my hope that this holy place will ease both our minds, come what may.”\n\n“You... don’t strike me as a devout creature.” His host said simply, doing little to hide a particular focus on the foreign noble’s rich attire that contrasted his own simplistic fabrics.\n\n“You have a good eye, Grand Mule.” Imamu returned, eager to leave an honest impression. “If you are the standard, then I am not. That does not mean I am without faith entirely.”\n\nThe Tarkhan - who had likely been near the end of a once-long chain of succession - looked at Imamu distrustfully, but gestured for him to sit on the prayer mat by his side. The stress of leadership was clearly mounting on the poor creature, it was a state of being that Ibyz Icepaw had displayed with far more subtlety than this inexperienced chieftain could ever have achieved. It was also instantly recognisable.\n\nHaving lowered his head as though in prayer, the foreign zebra spoke in a whisper. “You may think of this as an ultimatum if that soothes your soul, but this is the arrangement that the Storm Queen would like to propose: The Tarkhans may continue to act on your faith in the capacities of charity and community service, but all forms of outright proselytising are to be prohibited. In return, your places of worship are to be protected by law and resources will be provided to rebuild and revitalise the region. You, your people and your faith will be safe.”\n\nA deep sigh marked the beginning of a prolonged silence as Imamu’s host took time to pray in a more earnest fashion.

"You know, I could ask some zebras I know at the University to compile a dictionary for the yeti language."\n\nThe yeti's eyes widened. "Really? I'd be happy to help with that. The rest of my unit aren't as... studious as me, so we've been having a lot of communication issues with local zebras. A proper dictionary would help immensely."\n\nShe tapped her chin in thought. "Hm, yes, you could help by spreading the word among the yetis and asking them to donate to the University. Of course, help with translation would be beneficial as well."\n\nThe yeti excitedly slammed the book on the table and stood up. "I'll get to it right away!" he exclaimed."

SLC_collab_tree.81.d:0 "Considering the relative remoteness of Alwani and how much of its territory was technically just desert, Imamu was quite surprised to be hosting a meeting of nobles in what was essentially a mansion. There was much that reminded him of his family within these walls, including the scheming amongst the local elites that he was certain to be dealing with any moment now. No doubt they would have some mane-brained scheme that they would try to push onto him as soon as pleasantries were out of the way.\n\nAs the zebra pushed open a lavish set of double doors, he was greeted by intrigued yet greedy expressions that he knew all too well. Each of the elites bowed to various depths, likely correlating to their age more than the amount of respect that they had for him which was undoubtedly minimal.\n\n“Good day, Your Grace. Come and join us at the table.” A particularly wealthy individual at the head of a small conference table requested, perhaps with a little too much vigour in her voice.\n\nImamu did as he was asked and took a seat at the opposite end of the table with a smile, “It’s a pleasure to be here. I’m eager to begin the apex of my journey to Alwani as soon as possible.”\n\nMost of the other zebras present nodded or hummed briefly in agreement, needing their speaker to hush them a little before continuing. “Then let us start. As I’m sure you’re aware, you need our cooperation if you want this region to remain stable. To that end, we have a very simple demand that will earn the ready bending of our knees: We would like to receive all former lands of the Alwani Kingdom in our provincial subdivision as a part of the Storm Kingdom. Primarily this means Timbucktu and Zwadai.”\n\nAlmost immediately their guest’s heart sank. He knew that demand could not be fulfilled as it would upset the delicate balance of interests in the kingdom’s buffer provinces, not to mention interrupting the Storm Queen’s plans in those other territories. He could feel the many pairs of eyes looking at him as he sank just a little into his seat, prompting him to sit up straight and lean forward; a mockery of eagerness that he didn’t have. Still, there was a chance to offer them something that they wanted...\n\n“That is a bold proposal, considering your position.” Imamu returned, his posture and expression becoming less of a farce as he spoke. “Let me be clear, you will not be receiving jurisdiction over those territories. Before you decide to decry our tyranny however, I will remind you that there are other incentives that Her Majesty is willing to provide. Neither of us wish to fight a protracted conflict in the desert, so I think you’ll be quite interested to hear about what we can offer you.”\n\nThe zebras muttered amongst themselves and to their appointed speaker for a minute or two before turning their attention back to their guest,"

SLC_collab_tree.82.d:0 "It was a pleasantly cool day in the typically arid streets of a small Ovingoland town as Zelitha strolled down the recently paved road, flanked closely by only a single storm creature. Neither of them were particularly worried about the results in the safety evaluation of this sleepy little settlement, as evidenced by their nonchalant pace. It seemed as though the Storm Queen’s plan to paint yetikind as liberators - despite the fact that the zebras here had settled on what was originally majority pony territory - had gone over swimmingly.\n\n“Miss! Miss!” Came the sudden voice of a young zebra, prompting both of them to immediately lose their calm demeanour and put their hands on their weapons as the foal came bounding over. “Are you helping the yetis? Your armour is so cool...”\n\nThe tension in soldiers’ muscles left as soon as it had arrived as they realised that the adorable little filly wasn’t trying to get their attention for anything dangerous or criminal. They were still getting used to the relative peace and quiet of the region.\n\nZelitha was quick to smile and crouch slightly so that she could appear less imposing to the young creature before speaking, “I certainly am! I’ve been helping them for many years now. They’re the best thing that ever happened to me and my home.”\n\n“Woah...” The doe-eyed foal gave out simply, staring at the dark metal plates of the armour that the officer was wearing and occasionally stealing glances at the storm creature to her side. “Do you think maybe... Maybe I could get some? I want to help too!”\n\n“Of course you can!” The older zebra returned with a little chuckle, taking a moment to give the foal a once-over and realising in the process that they were really too young to be an informant.“ Though I do think you should wait a couple of years. It’s important to be big and strong in our line of work and you’ve got to get a little taller before you fit in armour like this. In the meantime you can certainly talk to your friends about it though, I’m sure they would love to hear about your conversation with Major Zelitha.”\n\nShe put a lot of emphasis on her rank, standing a little more proudly before the filly who simply stood there slack-jawed for a moment. It wasn’t long before the little zebra was trotting back to one of the houses on the other side of the street with a wide smile on her snout.\n\nThe two soldiers on duty took a moment to compose themselves, the ever-silent storm creature needing only to relax and finally take her oversized hand off of the blackstone machete on her belt. Instead, the officer of the pair quickly found the hulking yeti staring at her; just barely making out what any normal creature would describe as an uncomfortable frown behind the mask. At least, she was fairly confident that it was a frown."

One of the bored yeti sprang up in excitement as something finally happened: a shipment of construction supplies and provisions for the workers arrived. She ordered some other yeti to follow her and ran off to meet the zebra traders and inspect their goods. While they did that, the construction workers also noticed the new arrivals and approached to take everything they needed for their work.\n\nAs a construction forezebra ordered two of his workers to haul a wooden log, he heard speech in a familiar language behind him. There, one of the merchants was discussing payment with the yeti officer, both speaking the Zar-Hay language. The stallion stared at them as they conversed, and when the conversation ended, quickly approached the merchant. "It is good to see a fellow scion of Zargitau," he said as a greeting.\n\nThe merchant mare frowned, hiding away a bag of coins she had just received inside her robes. "Fellow scion? You're a local, aren't you? I could tell by your accent."\n\n"Yes. Born and raised here in Zombori. Rarely have I seen zebras from Zar-Hay here."\n\n"This land is Zar-Hay, and has always been so. Even if many here have abandoned God in favour of the Re'emite falsehoods."\n\nThe forezebra seemed stunned and struggled to reply. "...Well, yes, but we are still one people, no? Should we not rejoice over being reunited?"\n\n"Reunited under those brutes?" she asked quietly and nudged her head at the yeti officer. "What's there to rejoice about? All we can do is seek to survive under their rule, and await the return of our King."\n\n"They pay well enough for us to survive, no?"\n\n"Quite. But not everyzebra is as fortunate as you or I. Do not think our people to be happy under foreign dominion, reunited or not."\n\nThe stallion looked down at the ground in front of his hooves and said nothing.\n\n"I'll be on my way back to Zao, then. I hope you make good use of these supplies and serve your masters well. May you one day re-embrace the Sky Stallion." The merchant then left, rejoining her entourage and leaving behind a morose forezebra.

"I'd watch your tongue lad. I may have seen enough battles for a lifetime but that does not mean I need a walking stick yet. Except, maybe to beat some sense into you." Urzak let out his own laugh as he took a sip from his drink. "But I'm counting on it: the moment I hear we are losing half our battles I'm marching right back in!" Urzak's sharp words too sounded fonder then they did years ago.\n\nUrzak turned to the rest of the room where the rest of the general staff was honouring his retirement. "That goes for all of you!

On this basis, it would be wise to accept such a deal; especially considering the failure of the hyenas. The public are not so easily swayed however, as they are in favour of continuing the war in an effort to stave off the suffering our enemies will undoubtedly bring once and for all.\n\nWith popular and political opinions in deadlock, the decision is ultimately left to [ROOT.GetLeader]."

SLC_strat_tree.1.d:0 "Being able to tell when storm creatures were approaching her quarters had been something of a challenge in the past, but recent months had turned it into more of a game; a game that Ibyz Icepaw had become remarkably good at. Most of the levity that had provided pleasant distractions in the Storm Queen’s day-to-day life had disappeared in the wake of the Uzerasi rebellion and the disappearance or execution of the various traitors. Although she would not admit it, it was fair to say that some of the absences were being felt with particular poignancy.\n\nIn this case, it was not hard to hear her subordinates approach. The near-silent sound of their paws was drowned out by the noise of an equally familiar pair of hooves, eventually leading to a knock at her door.\n\n“Enter.” The monarch replied simply, pushing away the tuna pasta bake that she’d made for herself.\n\nUrzak Deepfrost opened the door and saluted quickly, waiting at attention for Ibyz to stand as a number of storm creatures flanked him. “Your Majesty, we have finished the preliminary loyalty assessments for all relevant corporations and civil servants. Only a few needed to be detained, though some others require further investigation.”\n\nIgnoring the inviting smell of her meal, the Storm Queen saluted once standing straight. “Thank you, at ease. Have you drafted the executive order I requested?”\n\nThe ageing officer visibly relaxed quite a lot, taking particular care to stretch his neck as the creatures around him remained stoic and upright. One of them revealed a small rucksack from seemingly nowhere and took from it a file which was handed to Urzak and then to Ibyz. The old general was clearly a little uneasy at the silence of the room also, having expected or at least being far more familiar with the sound and sight of more than one creature in these quarters. Her Majesty now spent most of her evenings alone nonetheless; a choice for which she could not be faulted, given the circumstances.\n\nGiving out a satisfied huff, Ibyz quickly scanned the first few pages in the file before nodding. “This is adequate. I want this signed into law quickly. It was a mistake to rely so heavily on the zebras and I will never let such a mistake happen again. An economic overhaul is long overdue.”\n\nHer subordinates simply bowed and left her to remain in the silence of the room."

"First we have to subvert a majority of mills to making uniforms, and now you're telling me that what I don't make for the military has to be shipped out of country? What sense does that make?"\n\nTaking a casual sip of the green tea he'd been provided, Sejzur Iceceiling set the cup down and pushed the saucer holding it towards his host. "In a short time frame, I'd have to agree with you, but you see, Her Majesty and I have a more long-term plan in mind." He folded his fingers into one another, "Certainly, you can make a healthy amount selling domestically, but you could make more selling abroad."\n\nWith more than a few huffs and groans, Zelchar began drumming his hoof against the dark wooden desk between them in the tiny office above the production floor. "So it's purely about money then? I can see the wisdom in reinvesting those higher earnings to create even greater output and returns, but what of our people while we're literally selling the threads off their backs?"\n\nAs casually as he was commenting on the weather, Sejzur leaned back in the uncomfortably small chair as far as he could without causing him too much pain. "It's not as though I'm having this conversation with every owner of every plant, there will still be trade within our borders, but most won't be. Besides, Zelchar, if we can hook the outside world on cheap goods while getting rich from them in the process, then our prosperity is all but guaranteed as they have to keep buying from us. See the plan?"\n\nA look of concern flashed in the mill owner's eyes before being burned away by greed. He spun his seat around and looked out the wide window behind him to the workers below, the pieces falling into place in his mind as dreams of ever-growing riches pushed out any worry. "Sejzur, you've twisted my hoof into doing a lot, but you don't have to for this." He stood, strolling around the desk to shake on the deal that had just been struck."

Thank you, Your Majesty.”\n\nIbyz Icepaw nodded without expression and went on to the next officer that had been recently promoted. She was holding a clipboard in one hand and a trench pen in the other, ticking off names and regions as she went almost absent-mindedly. It was a gruelling bureaucratic task to reorganise the entire Zwahile into a series of military governorships, particularly as the resistance to the state was yet to entirely evaporate.\n\nShe suppressed a yawn and continued on to the next yeti who was going to Buckonny. The sleep in the Storm Queen’s eyes and the bags under them were barely hidden by her stony expression. It was a blessing that she was repeating more or less the same thing over and over or else she might have begun making mistakes. Luckily none of the new recruits seemed to notice, or at least were too respectful and well-trained to pay any mind to her current state. That was a small comfort, considering the lack of sleep would likely continue for weeks to come.\n\n“Experience in dealing with local dignitaries with proficiencies in urban combat and protest suppression,” The monarch continued, taking a moment to look at the yeti who would be taking charge of the city of pink blood. “Congratulations. You are to be the new military governor of Brightbolt Stretch, formerly known as Mzizima.”\n\nLike her compatriots, the Captain saluted dutifully. “Yes, Your Majesty. Thank you, Your Majesty.”\n\nThe young officer bore several scars of her own, namely across her arms. There was a lot about the yeti that Ibyz found familiar, though she hardly remembered looking quite so proud when the burden of leadership was forced upon her. That was somewhat unsettling in and of itself, but equally it spoke to the officer’s loyalty and dedication to the interests of the Storm Kingdom. Perhaps someday that fire in her eyes would be the source of more pride than anxiety.\n\nNormally the way in which her subordinates turned about and marched like clockwork was comforting in its rhythm, yet now the obedience seemed almost unnerving."

"—Would you rather I leave them to starve? We're taking all they have to eat!" A second voice, clearly arguing with the first, tumbled out into the hall.\n\n"I would rather you follow orders, Lieutenant!" Krakh nearly jumped out of his fur. That wasn't the commanding officer speaking, those words belonged to the regional governor themselves. He'd only heard them once before, but it was more than enough to leave an impression. "If every officer took the rules into their own hands, our military would have no discipline at all! Worse than that, if every officer flagrantly gave food away as you have to the poor, the entire army would starve!"\n\nA silence drew out uncomfortably long, though it may have only been a few seconds, before the regional governor spoke once more, this time calmer than before. "This nation and this army run on rules, and if you can't follow them or insist on talking back to your superiors, then you have no place in either. However, I like to believe I'm not a harsh yeti, so I'll permit you to state your case before a court martial. Dismissed."\n\nAll at once, time started moving within the barracks again, and Krakh scrambled to make himself look busy as the offending Lieutenant rushed out passed them, looking as though they were holding back both tears and rage. Krakh let out a long sigh as he saw her walk right over the floor he'd just cleaned, leaving a slight trail of dirty hoofprints that got lighter the more it progressed. With a shake of his head, Krakh picked up his bucket and started from the beginning, muttering to himself."

None of the generals here would have enjoyed being compared to politicians of course, especially not after what they had done to the Uzerasi and corrupt bureaucrats that flew the coop as soon as the Storm Kingdom showed a moment of weakness.\n\nNevertheless, some of them were going to need to act at least a little like those spineless fools if they wanted things to stay stable in the coming years. Capable administration was one thing, putting a kind face behind it was quite another; particularly when so many of them bore scars as reminders of their real occupation. Someday the ranks of civil servants would be restored, but that day was likely at least a decade away for the time being.\n\n“Thank you all for being present today.” The Storm Queen began, standing at a small podium in front of the neatly organised rows of commissioned officers. “On the assumption that a majority of you have read my briefing, I will keep this quick. Socialism is to be banned in all its forms. You will be given the authority to perform relevant investigations. Those sympathetic to labour organisations are to be detained. You will be responsible for conducting thorough interviews and providing compensation for any damages caused by investigations that you authorise.”\n\nThe expressions of general approval amongst the general staff were expected, but they were nevertheless satisfying to see after months of work in what was effectively national damage control. There was one notable exception in the sea of satisfied faces, however. Ravakh Cloudcracker himself was suddenly looking very uncomfortable in his seat, seeming even more distressed as his commanding officer locked eyes with him. Although this announcement was partly intended to chip away at the various disunited labour movements around the kingdom, it was also targeted very specifically at one creature that had caused the military so many problems during the Uzerasi Revolt.\n\nAfter a few long moments, The Storm Queen looked away from her target and cleared her throat. “I will also be conducting an investigation of my own. Very few of you will be visited, but some will be. Expect me to be thorough. Those who have ignored dissent have facilitated it. Execution by firing squad is the punishment for treason. Dismissed.”"

Soup spoon in one hand and a well-used trench pen in the other, Ibyz was casually reading a considerable pile of such documents with an indiscernible expression. The homemade vegetable broth was less pleasant than she had been hoping, but it was warm and comforting in a way that few things still were.\n\nIt was certainly more pleasant than the scratchy tip of the hard-wearing fountain pen between her tired digits, at least.\n\n“Verzhak Bolthaze, execution requested for... desertion.” The yeti said to herself, pausing to take a sip of the soup she had prepared several hours prior. “Third infraction proceeding an initial case of insubordination and then a case of endangering fellow soldiers.”\n\nGiven the circumstances, it was unlikely to have been endangerment by sheer stupidity. The current training regimen for the troops was satisfactory and this was not a recently recruited creature. In this case it was most likely a polite way of saying that they had put themselves and others in danger during combat. Be the misjudgement the result of apathy or some kind of projected death wish, it was behaviour that simply could not be allowed to put others at risk. Yetipower was valuable and the expertise of soldiers was not to be wasted on vainglorious or simply suicidal actions in the heat of combat.\n\nWhatever had been going through that poor yeti’s head when he’d behaved in such a way, he would not be putting his brothers and sisters in arms in danger a second time. Ibyz sighed as her pen scrawled a barely-recognisable signature at the tail-end of the warrant. The motion was wholly haphazard, the result of many nights of bad sleeping habits and equally awful thoughts about recent events.\n\nLooking up from the stack of paperwork, the Storm Queen focused her gaze on the almost full bowl of thick vegetable soup once again and frowned. It took her a long time to have another spoonful of the admittedly tasty meal she had made, but it didn’t quite sit right. Perhaps she had used some off ingredients, or the recipe was missing something critical that she had missed.\n\nEither way - in spite of her strong stomach - Ibyz found herself pushing the bowl away and across after a few more mouthfuls. She could have some more later, if she wanted it; after she finished up with all of the warrant processing that was becoming ever-more abundant of course.\n\nThe lightly hunched yeti gave out a sigh as she drew out another form from the pile, “Ghez Icebrighter, execution requested for... cowardice."

While it was a humble life, especially after leaving the army with only one of the arms she went in with, it was becoming harder to make the trip because of the blasted crows.\n\nDozens of them quickly turned into hundreds circling over the Eye's indomitable fortress, each of them intent on collecting some small morsel from the body of a betrayer. It wasn't long ago that Ravakh, a would-be traitor to the Queen, was strung up from the walls for all to see. Serving both as an example to anyone who would question Her Majesty's authority and an insult to the fallen saboteur.\n\nEach avian scavenger brought with them disease and droppings that littered the city, and the noise was practically unbearable. But soon enough, they'd have nothing to orbit, and Sjak could once again make their trips in peace, as much as a busy city could provide that.\n\nShe knew better than to look toward the rotting cadaver, but today, while lost in her thoughts, her gaze drifted to it unconsciously. The smell was already bad enough, but the sight made Sjak retch over the side of the cart she pulled across one of the city squares.\n\nThe missing patches of fur were the first thing she noticed, with more being peeled off of him by an opportunistic bird, then she stared into an empty eye socket which she couldn't pry herself away from. It was as though the old, eccentric officer was pleading to be noticed even after death, for someone to remember him. But finally, like the other thousands of yetis in the capital, Sjak tore her view away and put her head down, refusing to grant the departed his final wish.\n\nHorrid though the sight was, Ravakh was up there for an undeniable reason— in addition to being whatever a socialist was— and justice had been carried out. The bitterness began to melt away in Sjak's heart as she recited that fact under her breath over and over again. Ravakh had made his bed, and now he was sleeping in it forever."

Now, with two fillies and a colt of her own, Zalga came to the opposite feeling because the army would only storm through her village on clear days.\n\nToday, the sky held no clouds, and the light blue that stared back at Zalga to excite her as a filly stood like an impending omen as an adult. She knelt just before the window in her home, saying a silent prayer that the Storm Queen's army remained ignorant of the insurgent headquarters in the village for one more day, only to stand back up and see a dust cloud on the horizon.\n\nFear tore across Zalga's heart as she burst out from her hut and screamed for her foals' names. The noise sent panic through the village like ripples in a pond, and soon everyone was calling for their young and drowning each other out, and all the while the dust cloud in the distance grew eerily closer.\n\nZalga's two fillies came running back into their mother's embrace before being hurried into safety within their home, but her son stood a few huts down, struggling to carry an old rifle. She cried out for him to drop it, to come to her, but she was buried in a cacophony of concern. He looked so proud of himself and paid no mind to the terror on his mother's face, the exchange of expressions being the only way they could speak.\n\nThen the storm creatures came. Several trucks sped to the center of the village and their crammed crew immediately jumped out, and without a word, lobbed several grenades into the building while opening fire on the building itself. Then as fast as they came, their trucks sped off under the cover of a dust cloud from the explosions, likely to assault another village like theirs.\n\nThe headquarters lay in ruins, the uproar had been brutally suppressed to silence, and through the quiet, Zalga's colt popped up from behind a brick hut, covered in dust and sand, to announce to the devastated village, "I'm ok!""

SLC_strat_tree.9.d:0 "Throughout the years spent behind a desk, Rakhar Thinsleet could scarcely recall a time when he'd had to replace the ink he wrote reports or signed documents with, but this changed the week he had been appointed a regional governor for Deepwater. Typically, a promotion would lead to less paperwork and heavier responsibilities, whereas the highest seat in the land had perhaps the most of both, save for those closest to the Queen, and Her Highness herself.\n\nEven more strange was that for every request asking for grants or economic injection, there were twenty slips asking permission to execute a member of the resistance. It presented a rather eerie feeling in Rakhar's gut that most of the work he was doing was sanctioning murder rather than properly governing or developing the region he was given authority over, but perhaps in order to do the latter, the former must be carried out to completion.\n\nAt least, that's what Rakhar told himself as he signed yet another request for an execution, not even bothering to look at whose life he was signing away or for what reason. In fact, he'd done this so much that he didn't even have to look at where the dotted line was on the paper, he could simply sign on instinct.\n\nThen something the governor never thought would happen came to pass: As he dipped his quill into the inkwell at the edge of his desk, not bothering to stifle a yawn as he did, he found the edge of it merely scratched the glass at the bottom of the jar. Snapped out of his weariness, he swept the tip of the quill around the well, searching for one last trance of ink and finding none. Rakhar simply let go of the writing utensil and sat back in his seat, idly spinning it around to the tune of tinny radio music from across the office room, taking solace in the moment before inevitably calling for more and returning to the miserable task.\n\nIt wasn't too long before the throbbing in Rakhar's wrist called the officer back into reality. No ink meant no blood, and no blood meant prisons full of resistance members who could coordinate plans on the inside to undermine the Kingdom. With a sigh, Rakhar buzzed his secretary with a request for a fresh inkwell."

Victory had been easily achieved over a would-be band of insurgents who had held nearly half of the city of Skyspire hostage, but the triumph over them was so easily won that many like Khaz were wondering if their actions were overkill.\n\nPerched atop the rubble of what was once a general store that housed shoddily made explosives for the resistance, Khaz leaned a little off the line towards horror. A small portion of the zebras she fought had no weapons but their determined hatred against the Queen's army. Admirable to be sure, but spirit, even one that burns like the sun, is far from enough to win a battle. Such resolve, such fury, Khaz could've sworn that she saw tears in the eyes of at least a dozen combatants felled by her. Were their actions really in the right?\n\nLooking out to the rest of the city, much of the beautiful sky peppered with columns of smoke, buildings missing entire sections out of them from bombs, homes littered with bullet holes throughout their walls, that all-too-familiar feeling of pride swelled within Khaz and pushed her back over the line to where she'd been before today. Killing was tragic, but these zebras chose to be enemies of the Kingdom, regardless of how justified their reasons were, and they knew precisely what that entailed. The scene had repeated itself enough times throughout the nation that there was no way any resistance fighter didn't know that. Further, Khaz reasoned as she rose from the pile of shattered brick and concrete, the alternative to putting the resistance down was betraying the Queen herself, and that was unthinkable!\n\nEven if the means were wrong, the ends were undoubtedly correct! More than this, if victory could be achieved as easily as it had today and in every prior riot and 'uprising', then it would only be a matter of time before the will and ability to resist vanishes altogether. Khaz took one last look at the dismal scene, this section of the city would take months to rebuild, but that wasn't her problem. A little twinge of satisfaction rippled through her chest as she marched down from the rubble to rejoin her battalion, she'd done that."

He leaned his head further out from his door, calling for his secretary like a youth called for his mother. "I swiped it off a docked merchant ship in Hippogriffia when the war was going good!"\n\nEveryone in the military governor's office was scrambling around the wide hallway, each one of them given the extremely rushed task of packing their things and moving out to a different region that needed their services. In other words, the task of turning ink to blood through execution forms and establishing order was no longer needed, and a civilian government could be established. Mostly civilian, anyway, law and order would still need to be kept, but that was some lower yeti's job, not Rakhar's.\n\nIt reminded Rakhar of when he'd first enlisted, that desperate scramble to pack whatever things he could in order to meet the deadline and march out with the other yetis from his town. Now his whole staff had the same feeling, and even he wasn't safe from it. The snowglobe he was after was among the final things he had to pack, an enchanted bauble from Equestria that made its way to Hippogriffia through trade, and then into his hands by theft. Instead of having to shake the oddity, the little bits of flurry inside the dome, which depicted a sleepy little town on Equus, moved on their own.\n\nIt was a pleasant change of pace, however brief, from the grueling monotony of signing documents or disciplining the odd soldier, excitement once more. Rakhar's secretary, a smaller, loud yeti who tended to shout when she spoke called back from across the way, ducking her head side to side to maintain eye contact through the busy troops and clerks hurrying past her line of sight, "It's in your personal luggage already on the train we have to meet, sir!"\n\nRakhar nodded with a chuckle, his favorite trinket would make it to the next objective before he did. He turned back to take one last look at the small room which served as his office, and how foreign it looked without the mountains of paperwork. Quickly, he swiped the empty inkwell he kept on his desk as a reminder of his work and slipped it into his pocket. Another keepsake from his time here in Skyspire. He would not miss it."

Staff Sergeant Raz Snowcloud's voice boomed across the expanse of the Azir desert, and the thought only occurred to her after her outburst that she didn't know if the sand would create an avalanche off the tall rock faces and valleys the same way snow did in the mountains back home. Regardless, she and the subsequent echoes of her voice spoke for her entire division.\n\nOstensibly their unit was here to put down any resistance they came across, fearing something similar to the Hayzeb rebellion, but in reality, they were there to march through the most unremarkable expanse of nothing the army had ever seen. As if this wasn't enough insult to the injury of a hollow mission, sand had gotten stuck in Raz's fur so many times that she stopped bothering to clear it out, only made worse by the absolutely unbearable heat.\n\n"Hey, keep it down would you," Captain Kratz, the leader with bad enough luck to be assigned to the outfit chided the NCO with a wide grin, "You might draw enemy attention to us." Exhausted and bored as the division was, laughter rippled through the soldiers like a pond's surface during rainfall.\n\n"Y'know Captain, I think I saw an oasis just over that dune ahead," Raz pointed, making everyone within earshot perk their heads up in hopes of seeing something to break the emptiness.\n\n"Yeah? Go fetch some water then. I swear, sergeant, if you can find anything out here besides sand and rocks, I will give you my month's salary."\n\n"Too easy," The NCO giggled as she slapped the officer's back, "You aren't either of those! You better pay up!"\n\nAnother round of laughter made its way through the troops once more. With nothing to occupy themselves throughout the vapid campaign, it was a relief to all those present that they could at least occupy themselves. "I'll get you on the journey back, double or nothing! In the meantime though, every step here feels needless. We could've never stepped hoof here and the result would be the same." Kratz announced without hiding his frustration,"

The yetis have requested that we hoof over control of... Azir, of all places.\n\nDespite the Storm Queen’s militaristic rule and the very real threat of war if we refuse this ‘offer’, it seems as though the yetis harbour no ill-will to the desert tribes. On that basis, one can only assume that they wish to control Azir for some sort of aesthetic purpose; or because they believe that there is oil and other resources to be extracted from under the sand. We have done our best to express the minimal benefits they will enjoy after annexing this territory, yet they remain steadfast in their demands.\n\nAlthough it seems ridiculous, the forces mobilising behind the sand dunes indicate that [SLC.GetNameDef] is absolutely serious about this demand.

Although some mining companies have expressed interest in performing geological surveys, we don’t expect them to be successful. The lack of discoveries made by [FROM.GetNameDef] in this department is evidence enough of Azir’s complete lack of material value.\n\nDespite this, the territory may still play host to some military infrastructure in the event of conflict with emerging powers in northern Zebrica.

Prisoner and guard circled one other in the empty prison yard, two leads in a drama without an audience.\n\nThe captor was a storm creature, small for his size, but towering nonetheless. In one of his hands was a standard bayonet from the Storm King era, though large enough that most other creatures would consider it a sword, and the other was a curved scimitar recovered from an officer in the Karkadannistani army which he threw down before himself. The captive was that sword's former owner, who glared daggers up at the creature sharper than the blade dropped at her hooves, before grabbing the hilt with her teeth. Wordlessly, an invitation to spar had been given and accepted.\n\nThe captured officer wasted no time lunging towards her opponent, a flurry of blows each punctuated with a puff of mist coming from her mouth, half her hits had missed and the other half had been readily blocked. A simple tactic on the guard's part, to wear down his enemy and then take them down, or perhaps he simply couldn't find an opening to hit back as months of pent-up rage was given an outlet to express itself. \n\nWhat started as little more than practice for a bored soldier had turned into a desperate and frenzied expression of fury, as though victory in this melee would earn any amount of freedom, if only in the prisoner's mind. Within moments, the tactic of a rushing torrent of attacks had lost its luster, and instead, the captive used another means at her disposal to fight: The snow itself. The attacks stopped long enough for the ex-officer to kick up a plume of frost to block the storm creature's vision, there in this momentary blindness she readied for a final strike.\n\nA good strategy on anyone other than a storm creature, who saw the attack coming down on them, and in an instant, brought down the full force of his own weapon on the back of the scimitar, shattering the blade and any hopes of success. As the snow settled back to its place, the officer crumpled to the ground, a look of despair washing across her face. She closed her eyes and hoped for a swift demise, only for it to never come. Instead, the guard reached down and offered his hand with what the prisoner could swear was mercy in his piercing eyes."

Most knew by now that she did little of the sort, but that didn’t make it appropriate to disturb her at such unholy hours of the day or - more accurately - the night.\n\nIbyz Icepaw skimmed tiredly over the paperwork that had been presented by the storm creature, raising an eyebrow over her now ever-present scowl. "Interesting. The horses could be useful. They could also be a liability. What makes them so valuable?"\n\nAs she set the docket down on the kitchen counter between them with an uncomfortable groan, the storm creature had an excited look in its eyes. Although the Storm Queen had never been able to communicate with them in quite the same way that they did with each other, time had given her the opportunity to pick up on at least a few emotional cues that her kind’s half-siblings seemed to share. It was all in what could be made out behind the mask and in the shoulders.\n\nLikely out of a desire to seem polite, her guest explained the logic in sign language rather than its own tongue. The general idea was that loyal horse regiments would be both a propaganda boon and a military advantage with minimal risks in their deployment. The creature argued that Karkadannistani horses were culturally insular and were unlikely to use their positions in the military to undermine the new economic system on a wider scale. The propaganda angle was fascinating in and of itself: Horses presented an opportunity to portray ponies and zebras as weaker equines who posed little threat to the obviously superior Hestrayan soldiers, putting yetis in a league all of their own as a bonus. Finally and most simply, Karkadannistani soldiers were no slouches in their own right; if deployed correctly they would be a substantial boon for the armed forces.\n\n"I see," Ibyz returned simply as the creature cocked its head to one side, eager for a response. "I will investigate the feasibility of this plan. Thank you for bringing it to my attention."\n\nHer guest bowed deeply, leaving the paperwork on the countertop and taking a few steps towards the door. A successful if somewhat tense interview of sorts, one that wasn’t helped by the overtly evident exhaustion, malnutrition and seemingly constant frustration of its host. There was some small hope that this project would take some weight off of her shoulders.\n\nJust before the storm creature could place its enormous hand on the doorknob, the Storm Queen cleared her throat and spoke with a vicious undertone.

The streets, once lined with grime and soldiers, now found themselves the hub of trade and prosperity, with happy creatures strolling around with joy that was so foreign to them years ago. And none knew this better than Rakhzar and his youngest son, who was currently devouring a cloud of blue cotton candy atop his father's shoulders.\n\nJust a year ago, Rakhzar was one of the only survivors of his airship's crew when it was shot down during the civil war, so he'd seen the collapse and the reformation of the lands under Her Majesty's rule. His son, thankfully, was too young to remember the horror and could enjoy what the Kingdom was becoming, and this could be exemplified no better than a military parade marching straight through the streets.\n\nThe little one had practically dragged Rakhzar out of the house to go and see the so-called 'Hestrayan Bulwark', or the elite detachment of horse soldiers from Karkadannistan, and it wasn't long before they muscled their way into a good spot to see the columns of soldiers. Their boots all hit the ground with one motion in complete lockstep, like the heartbeat of the armed forces, and there near the front stood the tall, proud Karkadannistani warriors. Their eyes held a fearsome and unwavering gaze, like they wanted nothing else but to be a weapon in the Queen's hand, and Rakhzar had to admit, his son's adoration was not misplaced.\n\n"Are they like ponies, Papa?" The little one asked, finishing his dessert and passing the papery stick down for his father to carry, which he did with a roll of his eyes. \n\n"Something like that, junior, I'd say horses are to ponies what storm creatures are to us yetis.

Even still, it wasn't as though the small crew of yetis, just under half a dozen, were taking every trinket or shiny thing they could get their hands on, that would be far too obvious.\n\nOnce their actual jobs were over, and any rubble was cleared, bodies properly tended to, and shell casings collected, the combat scene would be gone over once more in search of anything important to commanding officers that the troops before them would've missed. Almost every time, nothing noteworthy was found, but this time, for Corporal Iynz and her two companions, was different.\n\nWhile walking towards the narrow kitchen of a home just outside Downpour, one of Iynz's hoofsteps echoed beneath her, and after pulling up a rather ugly-looking rug, she found a trap door. Opening it led to an improvised arsenal of weapons from the old era of the Storm King, only each one that was hauled up was modified to serve a different purpose.\n\nHalf were polearms that were sawed in half to be close-range hatchets, useful in tight quarters or urban combat, and half were even less recognizable. The metal and long shaft of the halberds were deconstructed and slapped together into all manner of weapons, from spears, throwing knives, hoof-mounted blades, and whatever scraps of metal that couldn't be formed into something were merely used as rusted caltrops.\n\nConsidering the age and condition of the equipment, it was almost impressive that they survived until now and further were still in service by resistance members. As Iynz logged and hauled everything out, she couldn't help but feel amazed at the force of will of these fighters who would use everything at their disposal to wage war, and fatigued at the effort it would take to finally defeat them."

However, in a townhouse in the middle of Shallowshore proper, a team of storm creatures tasked with sweeping the residence came upon an old set of clothing with what appeared to be brown camouflage.\n\nCloser inspection revealed an intricate set of lightweight meshes between elastic and breathable fabric, along with some unfortunate blood stains and various holes in the shirt. Tucked between two mattresses in the upstairs bedroom was its matching set of legwear, a baggy set of brown pants with the same material. The storm creatures in the home stared at one another as though they were all thinking the same thing: Desert Camo.\n\nWith a shrug of his large shoulders, the head of the mission decided to try on the outfit, and much to the shock of the whole unit, it fit like it was perfectly tailored for him. The only possible reason this could not only be here but fit like a glove was that it must have been left there more than a decade ago by someone in the Storm King's legion.

Walking around to inspect her troops usually drained her of all her energy, and her soldiers were either having just as hard a time as she was with the weather or were somehow brimming with energy and unfazed.\n\nWorse, sometimes the scorching light outside would play tricks on her mind, making her see something out in the sand dunes at the edge of Her Majesty's territory, but a quick peek in binoculars always yielded nothing. More than this, the nature of the dunes themselves shifted throughout the day, leading to a totally different makeup every twelve or so hours. It made defending the hard points of the rather wide base somewhat difficult as personnel had to be shuffled around to meet the changed landscape.\n\nSo the positions of her troops would change with the sand, and as the spiteful sun rose that morning, Major Krow made her rounds again. And just the same as they had a few days prior, her eyes deceived her with a grey barrel sticking out from the side of a mound. Only this time, unlike any other, the binoculars, and Krow's personal aide, confirmed that this wasn't a mirage at all.\n\nAt once she ordered a small team out there to dig out what she saw, and with some struggle, they did so. There, sitting atop what looked to be a makeshift set of rails in the terrain, was a set of three mortars. Krow couldn't believe her eyes, a forward operating base AND a set of desert mortars!? Both were thought to be impractical or impossible, but here they were, a little worse for wear, but functional!\n\nFinally!

"Unless the Maregyptians were planning to make some super ship to launch a daring naval invasion all the way to the Eye of the Storm, capture the Storm Queen and force us to surrender in exchange for her life." His outlandish theory earned him a few chuckles from the group.\n\n"I just hope we find something decent in this chaos," Ikoor groaned tired. "I'd rather not spend the rest of the day here." His eyes became transfixed on an abandoned cup of coffee, very likely to be cold and stale by this point. Before Ikoor's intrusive thoughts could get the best of him however his attention was directed on the table the cup was on, larger and clearly of more importance than the other desks based on its position.\n\nGoing behind it he noted a cleverly hidden safe, its lock was strong but using his natural strength and military training he was easily able to tear the pony-designed contraption apart. His previous annoyance disappeared as he picked up the design in the safe, one for a battleship no less. It brought a newfound grin to his face even as the design was more so intended for pony than yeti use, this was something the kingdom could use."

SLC_strat_tree.25.d:0 "ZEBRICA WILL BE OURS AGAIN\n\nKivrav stared at the propaganda poster on the wall, his already slow pace becoming a crawl as his eyes remained focused on the paper with the bold words. Under them it showed the continent of Zebrica and an army of yetis from the Rainband marching across it. A dark shade of blue spreading from the army throughout the continent like tendrils. "Thinking of joining the army Kivvy?" His girlfriend's voice lightly teased.\n\nKivrav turned to her with slight surprise. "Not at all! You know I wouldn't be able to last a week without seeing you again." The two exchanged loving smiles before Kivrav's turned thin. "Still, it seems like the more days pass by the less you see anything that isn't related to the army in some way. Posters like these are cropping up everywhere, and don't get me started on all the recruiters and military parades." He frowned. "I can't help but feel off with how badly the government wants us to fight."\n\nVor let out a understanding hum. "I get what you mean Kiv. But I mean...is it that bad?" She continued even as Kivrav raised an eyebrow. "I heard the Storm Queen used to be a retired field marshal back before the civil war. Yet after all this time she has only improved our lives - not treating us like another part of the army. If anything protecting us against those who would hurt our people." She held his hands. "Trust me, I'm not the biggest fan of all this stuff either. But we can't deny that the Queen has been a good ruler to us so far."\n\nKivrav was silent for a moment. "I...I suppose you're right." He took another look at the poster. "Maybe I should have a little more faith in our Queen and her army. I guess she has been pretty successful." And at this rate she may even become as great as the Storm King, Kivrav thought to himself."

SLC_strat_tree.26.t:0 "The Pride of Yeti Civilisation"
SLC_strat_tree.26.d:0 "The Storm Queen stood hunched over behind the worn marble countertop of her quarters’ kitchen, staring at her military dress uniform draped over a luxurious chair in the dining room. In her hands was a half-empty piping bag full of cream cheese icing for the unfilled and undecorated carrot cake sponges sitting on plates just below the apron that was covering her front. She’d been standing almost stock still like that for almost a minute now, contemplating the trajectory that she and the kingdom as a whole was on.\n\nShe couldn’t have said why this moment in particular was the one that prompted her to finally stop and think about the road she was walking. Maybe it was because the last time she had worn that uniform was when Imamu had been helping her prepare for a speech. Maybe it was because she had once again found herself cooking to try and cope with the nerves that she now didn’t have any other outlets for. Maybe it was little more than finally having a moment to think about what was happening without being bombarded by requisition requests and other military bureaucracy for once.\n\nAs Ibyz Icepaw put down the piping bag and slowly stood up from her over-the-counter hunch, one thought was playing on her mind: How was she now any different from the Storm King?\n\nIt was true that unlike his rule, hers would be stable and consistent; yet it was equally true that the end result for many creatures would be essentially the same. Many would suffer, despite the stability and many would remain impoverished even if the newfound wealth of her kind trickled down and into their pockets. The reputation of yetis certainly wouldn’t be improving, not least for the fact that war would be the only way to secure further resources for exploitation and to continuously encourage the growth of the military-industrial complex. The road that was being taken was one of conflict, strife and pain; one that she would only ever walk alone.\n\nThe Storm Queen sighed and stepped away from the counter, taking off her apron and leaving it haphazardly on the side before approaching her uniform and picking it up in her lightly-shaking fingers. Somehow her kin wanted all of that, didn’t they? The kingdom was stable and prosperous, developing technologically by the day and unrivalled in its military might. Was that the fate of yetikind? To rule by force and take what was owed to them by creatures who could hardly defend themselves? That rhetoric had certainly made her popularity soar, even moreso after the administrative chaos of the Uzerasi Revolt.\n\nA grimace emerged on Ibyz’s face as she growled and gripped the fabric, quickly heading towards her bedroom to get changed into the uniform. The carrot cake had been all but entirely forgotten, just like that."

SLC_strat_tree.27.d:0 "The Storm Queen huffed as she reviewed the military production reports that had been compiled for her, taking a moment to ‘relax’ in her study in the process. Considering where the kingdom had started, the fact that materiel output had gone up by multiples in many cases was promising; though unfortunately unsatisfying. They would need much more if the country was to defend itself from those that would see yetikind smothered.\n\nShifting in the arm chair, Her Majesty’s eyes were drawn to the mug of strong mint and licorice tea that she had made earlier; prompting the yeti to close her eyes for a moment and refocus. She could enjoy it when she was back at her desk, doing the work she had originally set out to do when this docket had been delivered. These numbers were far more important than the plans she had been drawing up and should be treated as such.\n\nOpening her eyes again and returning to the papers in her calloused fingers, the Storm Queen gave out a sigh as she continued going over the report. Of particular note were the statistics surrounding the production and introduction motorised and mechanised equipment, which was only just on track. The plants involved in that work would most likely need an inspection to ensure all was running as it should be. Tank production was also slower than she had hoped, although that was expected to an extent. The pipeline from design to manufacturing remained inefficient and several models were undergoing refinements that caused massive inefficiencies in the production process. Some kind of output quota was needed in order to prevent or at least slow the constant changes that factory workers were required to account for on the floor.\n\nAside from those particular points, other sectors of the military-industrial complex were quite strong. Small arms in particular were being distributed to the armed forces at an unprecedented rate and experiments with automatic weapon designs that could fire rifle calibre rounds were in progress. Aircraft output and airship retrofitting were also in a good place, though Ibyz Icepaw was yet to be convinced by the viability of a modernised airship fleet for the time being. The main point was that neither area of the air force's manufacturing focus was in dire need of a review for the time being.\n\nAfter a few moments of consideration, the Storm Queen stood up from the relatively comfortable confines of the armchair and immediately scribbled down some notes on what she had seen in the fine print. It wasn’t long before she had left the study in a hurry to deliver her orders based on what she had read, leaving the tea to get cold."

Frankly I’m amazed that you make me more uncomfortable than Ravakh used to, which is quite something.”\n\nThe mercenaries looked at one another with eager smiles, enjoying the uncomfortable atmosphere of the room stuffed with the highest ranking officers in the Royal Air Force as its own kind of adrenaline rush. ‘Cerulean 1’ - his real name unknown even to the MID - was accompanied by a few of his subordinates. Their code names were as prolific as they were laughable, including such gems as: Clown, Bureaucrat, Dictator and Overlord Duck. Each and every one of them was eager to get started, unlike their commissioned counterparts.\n\n‘Cerulean 1’ led his little band confidently into the conversation, “Let’s stay focused. The Storm Queen clearly shares my personal preferences when it comes to dealing with wild dogs like Ravakh Cloudcracker, which is why I’m here. Our payment and your success both hinge on this arrangement, so let’s not take that away from ourselves.”\n\nThe Air Marshals shared concerned glances with one another but nodded. Drizakh gestured to Grozak on his left who then handed him their reform plans with a suspicious glance at their guests who were all smiling toothily. A few moments later the plans for everything from new fighter designs to air reform directives and military production numbers had been laid across the table. The aces were all very interested in the former of course, but they managed to contain themselves as best they could.\n\n“Let’s handle the giraffe in the room first,” The leader of the mercenaries began, reaching for the fighter aircraft design specifications. “Fighters are the backbone of any threatening enemy air force. Having recently had the opportunity to upgrade our personal retinue of machines, I can tell you that there are some upgrades you need much more than others.”\n\nThe officers were now listening intently, leaning over the table as ‘Cerulean 1’ spoke, getting out trench pens and paper pads to make notes as he went.\n\n“First of all, the IFF system needs improving dramatically and the air brakes are also anaemic. I can see here you’re looking at improving the armament which is a welcome change, but make sure the replacement weapons keep the fire rate high and don’t shudder the wing rivets apart; they feel unsteady as it is.” He continued on, already engrossed and sharing nods of agreement with the other mercenaries."

I do not just mean combined arms but also looking into how we can affect our enemies morale and go even further. No more of our previous softness. With a strict command we can achieve some devastating results without letting our troops fall into excessiveness.”\n\nUrzak received whispers of approval from the room, most surprisingly - or not from Vurka Stormfall. “I would like to put extra emphasis on exploring new means to wage war, the Queen herself has already greenlit some very interesting projects. I’m particularly interested in what the DSRP can provide us with alongside the knowledge our future subjects – willingly or not – can share. Either way I urge the military to keep a keen eye on this.”\n\nGaz Boltrider cleared her throat. “Speaking of future subjects, we should apply the same tactics general Deepfrost proposed in maintaining our hold on our newly acquired territories and clients states. As proven by the Zwahile the only way we can keep resistance down is by showing we will not tolerate any of it, even if it leads to a less than cooperative population. Not that it will matter much when we’ll use yeti governors to rule the land, though I would not disclose the use of the few who still want to collaborate with us.”\n\nUrzak nodded at Vurka and Gaz. “Understood.

SLC_strat_tree.32.t:0 "Oblivion in Rain"
SLC_strat_tree.32.d:0 "The gaudy throne room was in direct contrast with its singular occupant. The Storm Queen was sitting uncomfortably straight, pressing her emaciated body up against the painfully rich throne of bejewelled gold and silver. She wore an empty expression that was devoid of its once unwavering determination, looking straight at the heavy double doors to the chamber opposite; possibly the only part of the room that wasn’t adorned in an inappropriate amount of wealth. Even her casual robes of purple and cyan with straps and details of brown leather and gold trim were so comparatively subtle compared to her surroundings that they looked out of place.\n\nIt was the sound of heavy raindrops against the stiff palace roof which finally coerced the decrepit yeti from her literal seat of power. The noise of water slowly pattering down on the great black stones that made up the outside walls was barely audible over the sound of Her Majesty’s hoofsteps as she trudged out of the horribly bright room.\n\nAn antechamber and then a flight of spiral stairs followed, the latter especially taking a long time to climb as the Storm Queen’s once motivated strides had slowed. She took occasional pauses to grunt and to prevent herself from tripping over her own hooves and the stairs, unable to remember the times when she could get around the palace in minutes without issue. Even if that thought was in her mind somewhere still, Her Majesty would not have been able to approach it; let alone remember and process the antithetical experiences.\n\nEventually her shaking hands rested on the heavy handle of an old trapdoor in the ceiling of one of the palace’s turrets. The yeti’s calloused grey digits grasped the brass and threw open the square door that evidently hadn’t been used in years with now uncharacteristic strength, letting the light rain drizzle onto her pelt and clothes as she stepped up into the open air. The darkening clouds were a simple and instantly recognisable warning of a coming storm, yet Her Majesty was undeterred. She simply took a few steps forward and waited for a moment, taking a deep breath and standing there as the rain began to fall more heavily.\n\nThe Storm Queen raised her uncomfortably thin arms up in front of her and held out her hands, watching emotionlessly as the water pooled and ran over her hardened skin; though the yeti could hardly feel the droplets as they rolled around. She had felt little at all since the proclamation that she would soon be empress in that very same throne room which she had now escaped, if only for a moment. The rain was soaking through her clothes and fur already, finally providing some kind of sensation to focus on.\n\nIt was cold, uncaring and relentless. It was unfeeling and did only as nature demanded. It was too much and not enough all at once. More than anything, the yeti was soaked in it all and standing alone; letting it drip without purpose from her matted fur and shivering limbs."

SLC_strat_tree.33.d:0 "In a rather bizarre turn of events, [SLC.GetNameDef] has offered us a consistent supply of materiel in return for the normalisation of relations between our nations.\n\nThe wrath of the Storm King has undoubtedly resulted in a kind of national distrust towards the yetis that has remained particularly pervasive in the years following his demise. The administration - whilst biassed against them in its own unique way - has always kept diplomatic channels open to the yetis in the hope of avoiding any further chaos. Perhaps it shouldn’t have been so surprising that they would use those channels to offer a unique sort of trade arrangement.\n\nMost seem to agree that this bargain is some kind of trap, particularly as [SLC.GetNameDef] has displayed its warlike tendencies time and time again already. It’s arguably reassuring to see that their nation hasn’t the same issues with instability as it did under the [SLC.GetLeader]’s predecessor, but what they’ve been doing to territories that they conquer is potentially even more concerning in the long term. On the other [ROOT.GetHand], receiving a reliable supply of weapons from the yetis is arguably worth the risk; particularly as any agreement reached with [SLC.GetNameDef] will make an invasion of our own state a less appealing prospect.\n\nDespite the trepidation of the public and the government, the yetis have plainly expressed their straightforward desires to earn a small amount of money in equipment sales and to receive performance reports on the materiel in question.

Though this is sure not to be the last of our diplomatic overtures to outside states, we must be careful not to overplay our hands. We wouldn’t want to show them the cutting edge of our technical know-how, just what we want them to see. That being said, it will be useful to know how our weapons compare to theirs and what adjustments need to be made in order to properly equip contingents made up largely of non-yetis. There is much to learn.\n\nOn the whole, this is a very positive sign for the nation. It is hoped that the normalisation of relations will also assist in future trade opportunities, provided we do not plan to annex the state which we have just gained reputation with of course. If the foreign actors in question are not long for this world, then we’ll shortly be seeing those old weapons in action first hand.

Though this will most likely not be the last of our diplomatic overtures to the states that surround us, we must be careful not to overplay our hands. We wouldn’t want to seem weak in the face of a single neighbouring country and thus we must continue to offer our services where possible. On the bright side, it seems likely that other nations that accept our programme will be able to provide equipment reports against those who do not. There is much to learn and we will take all the information that we can.\n\nOn the whole, this is a rather neutral outcome. It is hoped that the normalisation of relations will still occur some time in the future, even if it does not happen within the next five years. Eventually they will realise that our titanic industry cannot simply be ignored and that their goods must come from a slowly dwindling number of neighbouring states. If - as is always a possibility - the foreign actors in question are not long for this world, then we’ll shortly be seeing those old weapons in action first hand. Most exciting as that may be."

Beyond being taught to be as efficient as possible and make do with their limited resources, the DSRP provided them with some state-of-the-art weaponry at the kingdom's disposal alongside the necessary supplies to survive for a few days without ever having to come in contact with another creature.\n\nLess so could be said about the creature they were pursuing – a zebra convict that was deliberately allowed  to escape the compound the Directorate had previously held him in. The zebra never considered why his cell door was left open, or why all of the guards were conveniently stationed away for him to have a clear path out. His only priority was to not remain a prisoner to the strange organisation, unaware it was all part of the test.\n\nOmega team had been tracking the zebra since their very escape, camouflaging themselves and staying far away as they observed the subject's every action – from his glee-filled trot of freedom to a slow crawl of despair upon realising he was stranded deep in a land he didn't know. The yetis watched on with keen eyes as the zebra struggled to find food or even warmth, both lacking in the snowy wasteland. They kept observing him until the very end when the exhausted convict collapsed onto the cold ground, not moving even as snow began to cover him.

Still, all this frantic movement made it possible for the other yeti to finally get a hold of him. The guard pinned the zebra to the ground and his partner was quick to pick themselves up. Mere seconds later they injected Rafa with an unknown substance, and the two guards promptly left the test chamber, closing the door behind them. Rafa touched his neck as he felt it sting.\n\nHis eyes focused on the reinforced glass wall in front of him. Behind it sat two DSRP scientists, silently watching him with their pens and papers at the ready. The zebra glared at his captors, and just a moment after he felt a strange cold spreading across his body. The pain was almost unbearable, only becoming worse with every second passing. The desperate urge to get rid of the agonising feeling easily got hold of him but that only seemed to make Rafa's situation worse as he started writhing on the ground. "What-what's happening to me?" He cried trying to get up, only to immediately collapse back down as the agony increased tenfold. "What did you yetis inject me with?! Please-please make it stop! It hurts so much!"\n\nThe zebra subject continued yelling and pleading for mercy as his condition worsened, whereas the DSRP scientists merely watched, writing down everything that was happening to him.

Though they were still no match for the storm creature they were facing the audience of scientists would be lying if they said this wasn't incredibly intriguing, their pens gripped tight as they watched the battle and wrote down their observations at the same time.\n\nThe charger wiped blood off her muzzle as her opponent once again beat her into the ground, she glared at it as they approached. The creature picked her body up and quickly let go, its silent eyes demanding the fight to continue, the stubborn charger was all too eager to accept its demand as she used all her adrenaline to circle the creature. Eventually coming in close enough to surprise and kick it in the ribs, earning a cheer from one of the younger scientists before getting shushed by the rest of the group.\n\nThe storm creature took advantage of the charger's newfound confidence however, exposing itself to another open attack while deliberately failing to grab the zebra. Just as she tried to go in for another hit, the storm creature surprised her by covering the exact spot she wanted to hit and delivering a harsh punch that sent the zebra flying before falling on the ground again.\n\nShe tried to stand up and continue the fight but couldn't, she had fought so much for so long that she couldn't hold herself up anymore and collapsed on the spot.

She shuddered at the notion of what her fate would be if she failed, but the Charger steeled herself as she saw the storm creature approaching her. With gritted teeth she charged forwards with determination, eager to get the freedom she so desperately wanted.\n\nThe scientists of the DSRP meanwhile watched with interested eyes at the ensuing battle, curious to see how the subject would fare now that she was fighting between liberty and death. Not that they really cared about that, the point of the test was to see how motivation would affect the subject after all. The Charger fought on more fiercely than before, her desperation causing her to fight even harder when she knew the consequences. Yet almost disappointingly to the scientists the fight ended earlier than usual.\n\nThe zebra froze as the storm creature picked her up by her face, she struggled as hard as she could. Kicking and screaming as hard as she could, when that failed she began to resort to begging for mercy. Neither the scientists nor her opponent showed any reaction to her pleading as she turned to crying, finally silenced once a sickening crunch was heard throughout the room.\n\nThe storm creature threw its former opponent away as the scientists merely made a few notes, talking in bored tones to each other before nodding and ordering the guards to fetch a new subject for the arena."

With the amount of work it wouldn't be surprising if they had to stay here for a few days. As the town began to wake up and its residents started their commute the yeti soldiers were left to their devices. In the middle of the day one of the yetis going by Imzon could feel eyes staring into his back. He turned to see a few zebras quick to make themselves scarce.\n\nAn annoyed grunt could be heard from one of his fellow soldiers. "Typical. Anything we do and these zebras immediately start thinking we're about to go on a rampage." He climbed down from the power line that had just been finished. "You'd think they would be a little appreciative of the work we're doing here." Imzon silently agreed, yet he could somewhat understand where the zebras were coming from. Ever since the revolt the relations between military yetis and civilian zeebs could be described as tense to say the least.\n\n"Still, it's not like we're dressed to look the friendliest of creatures." Imzon argued, pulling on his army overalls. Just as the other yeti was about to say something back they noticed a young filly staring at the two of them, beginning to shift nervously as the yetis stared back. Imzon gave a gentle smile and tried to wave only for an older filly - presumably her sister - to grab the younger one and quickly trot away from the soldiers, making Imzon's smile drop as he saw the fear in both their eyes.\n\nThe soldier next to him scoffed.

"Look, the labs get a lot of funding from the government and army for a reason. The same money that gives folks like you and me the chance to pursue what we want - it's a mutually beneficial relationship." She offered him a small smile. "Besides, we do more than just help them make weapons. But if that isn't to your liking you can always go into a more civilian lab once you're done here, you would have the experience."\n\nToril became a bit more bashful again.

There were exactly fourteen standing in the conference room, but the time that their commander-in-chief was taking to inspect each one made it feel as though there were far more. The utterly icy expression that the Field Marshal was wearing also didn’t help to relieve the trepidation that could be felt both by him and his new colleagues that were currently standing at attention.\n\nMore than anything, the Major at her side could tell that something had changed since the last reorganisation of the general staff. Her Majesty was... different. He had always been a proponent of some of the policies which they were now pursuing without the influence of the Uzerasi, but something fundamental had seemingly been altered to facilitate them. It wasn’t a lack of empathy, the Storm Queen was clearly making an effort to retain her old principled and immovable self; but that was just it. It now required effort. She was putting on a strong face, at least to a degree. Vurka wasn’t absolutely sure yet, but it seemed as though it was taking more energy every day.\n\nIt was with that thought that Ibyz Icepaw had finally finished her inspection, “You prepared them well, Major Stormfall. I am pleased with this selection.”\n\n“Thank you, Your Majesty.” He returned, noting her unusually blank expression as she turned to face him. “I will have them briefed on current operational plans and the situation in the kingdom as a whole. They have already been made aware of our general strategic and national objectives.”\n\n“Good. Very good. I will be in my study if my input is required. Dismissed.” The Storm Queen gave out simply, saluting the newcomers who returned the gesture.\n\nWatching as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces walked out of the room in silence, it took a moment for Vurka to put his subordinates at ease. He remembered when she had onboarded him and some of the more prolific officers and it had been a lot more energetic than that. He could only sigh as the assembled yetis began to speak amongst themselves.\n\nUkzah - a bizarrely promising and mysterious promotee - was quick to approach his superior when given the chance. “I’m not quite sure how to ask this sir but... is Her Majesty well? She didn't even ask for our loyalty oaths.”\n\nMajor Stormfall could only sigh,"

By all means she was surrounded by the bottom of the barrel, but these were her orders as per the kingdom's new programme to eradicate poverty through enlisting the homeless and such into the army.\n\nShe had to gather all her will not to bend over and puke whenever a particular few recruits passed her by during their training regiment, their incredibly dirty fur telling everything about the slums they've lived in making Griz mentally remind herself to send them to the showers twice-thrice once the drills for today were over.\n\nBesides that however the recruits kept themselves orderly, not making any trouble and doing their training as best they could. She had to admit that they had potential that others would have easily missed, potential that Griz had when she was young that her parents missed. Her features softened as she decided she would be different, these yetis were her responsibility after all.\n\nWith an almost infectious renewed vigour she commanded the platoon to their next exercise, giving them the extra encouragement they needed to succeed, determined to fulfil her orders and turn these simple yetis into true worthy warriors for the Queen and the kingdom.

We will use the disunity of the regions to play interest groups against one another. Overwhelming force and the lack of organised alternatives to our rule will be enough to provide stability.” The Storm Queen explained to the room, gesturing to what could only be described as a mutilated map.\n\nWhilst the general staff were not necessarily the ones who would be running these regimes, they would be responsible for setting them up as well as organising regional police and military units. It was imperative that they understood exactly what their purpose was and precisely what the result of their administrative effort would be. This was an invasion for materials and financial gain, but not in the way that her predecessor would imagine such a thing. This system of resource exploitation was to be permanent.\n\nTaking a moment to breathe, the towering yeti continued. “Avoiding the destruction of key industries is preferable. Keeping infrastructure functional is imperative in light of possible future conflicts. Civilian casualties... Avoid them if you can. Tactical and strategic objectives come first. There are many viable targets for economic assimilation and ensuring that we do not stand in our own way is of vital importance. Railroads will be expanded and extended to meet demand where necessary, provided they are not damaged.”\n\nA series of nods and general grunts of agreement or understanding emanated from the assembled officers, most of whom were still taking notes. Ibyz Icepaw could tell that most of them were excited to get the opportunity to go on the warpath again, or indeed for the first time in many cases. Even those that had been recruited on principles more like the ones she claimed to stand for were itching for some kind of action. It was both reassuring and somewhat concerning at the same time, knowing that the fire in their eyes wasn’t entirely burning on selflessness and national pride. Some of them were in it for themselves.\n\nMore concerning still was that the Storm Queen didn’t feel that same spark at all. This kind of planning was where she felt most at home; not the subject itself, but the depth and the long-term strategy of the work had been her strong suit for years. She couldn’t quite figure out why it wasn’t as invigorating as usual.\n\nIt took Ibyz a moment to recover from her deep thoughts, having realised in that moment that the room had gone quiet and was waiting for her to continue."

Typically at least a few rooms would be hired out by one of a few youth groups, a company for local meetings or even sometimes by a family for one reason or another. Fazh’s little state-mandated booth near the building’s reception area was also typically quite busy at later times of the day, but these were still school and work hours for most. It was going to be especially slow for the next few hours, it seemed.\n\nAnd so it was that for the next half an hour or so, the building remained eerily quiet. The actual receptionist of the institution occasionally dropped by for small talk and to offer the recruitment officer some tea, which was welcome. He however was absent when the recruitment officer heard the building’s wooden doors swing open.\n\n“Good afternoon,” Fazh gave out with a little sigh over her newspaper, “If you wait just a moment the receptionist will be back to speak with you shortly.”\n\nThe weight of the creature’s hoofsteps betrayed both their age and timidness, “A-actually I’m... I’m here to sign up.”\n\nLooking up, the yeti in the booth took in the ragged citizen before her. Almost certainly homeless, equally as likely to be without any friends or family to fall back on. It wasn’t an uncommon sight in her line of work, but rarely were the destitute souls this young; or even quite as empty looking. She did wonder if she should direct him to a soup kitchen, but there weren’t any nearby.\n\n“You’re a little young to join the army, I would think.” The older yeti returned with a huff to hide the sudden well of emotions that his utterly dogged appearance brought on. “I take it you mean the Youth Group of the Royal Army?”\n\nThe young soul simply nodded which prompted Fazh to collect some paperwork from around her desk and start writing things down. She rattled off a few questions like whether he could read and write as well as what educational institution he was in or had been in. Unsurprisingly a lot of the boxes were only barely ticked and several things had to be left blank, but somehow the little yeti managed to fill out the form in a way that would probably be accepted by the officer’s superiors. It was the least she could do to make sure he had some food and a place to sleep.\n\n“And your name, son?” The older yeti finally asked, reading over the paperwork once more."

SLC_strat_tree.47.d:0 "The stone blocks and curved columns that made up the palace’s shrine made it perhaps the only place in the Storm King’s gaudy residence that retained some semblance of taste. It wasn’t big enough to receive many guests, nor did many of the staff consider themselves worthy of using it to receive their ancestors’ blessings, making it a pleasant retreat for the Storm Queen.\n\nIbyz Icepaw was on one knee with her head bowed before the smooth grey pillars that protruded out from the ground. Shrines had always looked like that no matter their size, as though they were about to form an arch and suddenly cut off near the point at which the two sides would have otherwise met. She had once been taught that it was because those visiting a shrine were supposed to bridge the gap between the world of the living and the beyond with prayer, but time had revealed that each yeti tribe used a different justification for the construction.\n\nDissatisfied with the lack of advice provided, the Storm Queen slowly stood up; using the pillars for support. The amount of effort it seemed to take surprised her for a moment as she stepped back from the structure and pondered her options.\n\nPerhaps the lack of satisfying answers shouldn’t have been a surprise. The first and only other monarch of the Storm Kingdom had little of value to say and even less that Ibyz would have wanted to listen to. The past held wisdom, but not for a statebuilding project of this scale; nor for a monarch that was anything less than utterly mad. It didn’t help that she had never been particularly in tune with those in the beyond. It had always been studies or martial practice when she was young and after that it became drills. There simply hadn’t been enough time to sit before the towering stones for long enough that she would hear their voices like others did.\n\nFrankly there were very few soldiers that could bear to see the regret on the faces of those that fought in pointless wars before them.\n\nYet the war on the horizon would supposedly be different. The Ancient Pact would always be an existential threat thanks to the loss of the Cornerstone, yet another of Thunderbringer’s frustrating legacies. His failures to safely transport the Storm King’s artefacts meant that a war of humiliation and submission would be necessary to subdue those old powers and prevent them from threatening the kingdom in the future.

Typically she would have made a speech or otherwise have desired to be present for the benefit of her image and that of the military itself. For once, her attention was simply needed elsewhere.\n\nIbyz Icepaw was currently hunched over alongside Gaz Boltrider, Savuk Cloudburst and Vurka Stormfall; all of whom were gaming out troop movements on a map-laden table. It had quickly become a laborious task with the sheer quantity of materiel and armed formations that needed to be accounted for.\n\n“Getting troops into Hestraya is going to be challenging.” Gaz expressed quietly, fidgeting with one of the simple wooden models that they were using to represent soldiers. “I can see why the horses never went beyond the mountain range.”\n\nSavuk cocked his head slightly and reached his oversized fingers to tap on the map beside one of the far less numerous little wooden ships. The Storm Queen followed his suggestion with her eyes as the storm creature positioned a few of the ship models off of the southern Karkadannistani coast and then gestured a line from Mzizima and over the sea into Hestraya.\n\n“Not a bad idea,” Vurka returned with a nod, running his fingers through his beard. “I doubt the Hestrayans will be able to match our fleet, even if it is in a sorry state.”\n\n“We could put some resources towards refits in the months to come, although I doubt we’ll have time for that. As long as we support our navy with aircraft that can match the required ranges, I suspect that we’ll be perfectly safe to transport troops that way.”\n\nThe other two officers nodded in agreement and took their monarch’s silence for assent to the idea. For her part, Ibyz was standing almost motionless as the conversation continued; simply observing with a lukewarm cup of strong yeti tea in her hands which she was yet to actually drink from.\n\nIt was only later - when her subordinates had returned to their duties - that the Storm Queen fell into an armchair in her quarters and almost instantly fell asleep.

Economic benefits of an alliance, high. Likelihood that it will be honoured, moderate. Trustworthiness of leadership... questionable. Chance that we will be obligated to assist them, high.

It wasn’t as though she sounded like that after the civil war.\n\nAnd yet when the yeti looked up to try and get a good look at his head of state, her expression seemed strangely blank.

"If I didn’t know any better I would be convinced someone messed up our logistics."\n\nKurakh merely shrugged. “I’m just glad we aren’t getting downsized instead, some of the other guys were hearing rumors about something like that near the end of the civil war.” He gave Ryd a reassuring smile. “Look on the bright side. With this kind of equipment our job will only get easier, I bet it would make a few troublemakers reconsider once they catch a glimpse at what we have now.”\n\n"It still feels kind of excessive to me." Ryd looked down at her list, only now seeing how long it really was compared to the usual. "I just hope they aren't going to send us to "police" other countries."\n\nBefore Kurakh could say anything the two yeti's were distracted by a light tank passing by, the first and certainly not the last from what the officers could see.

"Good to see you're getting your groceries, they've never been more affordable nowadays! Here's hoping it'll last for a while."\n\nUrrak lightly chuckled. "I'm sure the queen will make sure they stay so low, if anything it'll be nice to have some heavier pockets for a while." He made his basket of groceries shake as Urrak showed it off. "Got everything I needed for the week alongside some extra stuff and I still have money to spare."\n\nThe old yeti nodded, happy for the comparatively young male. Her eyes shone with curiosity as she looked at his basket. "Say, Urrak, what are those boxes over there? They remind me of the rations my enlisted granddaughter always complains about."\n\n"That's because they are." Urrak grabbed one of the rations and showed it off. "They're quite cheap and with how much money I now have lying around I thought it would be nice to get something extra for my work lunches. If this is what soldiers eat I'm confident it'll give me the energy to get through the day!"\n\n"That's all nice and good but forgive me when I say they don’t look very appetising... not to forget what my granddaughter said." The old yeti admitted with slight concern. Urrak couldn't help but look a little embarrassed as he gave the paid stack of rations a second look, realising they really didn't look all that pleasant."

SLC_strat_tree.58.d:0 "The yeti fiddled with the bulky trench pen in her fingers, spinning it haphazardly in front of the Urzak with a vacant stare. The reality of the situation was as disheartening as it was dangerous. Although the ROMM’s plot during the western revolt had been stopped, the fact that such a small organisation could have the ears of the entire military under the right circumstances was troubling to say the least.The silver lining that communism had thankfully not taken root in the armed forces was small comfort.\n\n“You are welcome to make suggestions, General.” The Storm Queen gave out quietly, sitting back in the armchair with the pen suddenly gripped like the handle of a weapon.\n\nThe elder of the two creatures nodded and interleaved his fingers, elbows planted firmly on his seat’s armrests. “Well, loyalty tests will be necessary for NCOs I think. We’re already performing reviews after the zebras’ little rebellion. I would also advise screening the military industrial complex in order to avoid materiel falling into enemy hands in a disaster scenario. Uzerasi control over certain facilities has demonstrated the risks of lacking oversight quite plainly.”\n\nIbyz Icepaw nodded silently in agreement and let the assessment hang in the air for a few moments, “The punishment for treason is death. We will need to be careful.”\n\n“Careful?” Urzak asked, quite surprised by her response given the circumstances. “A series of public executions would be entirely appropriate. What care needs to be given for traitors and leeches? You’re too soft, as usual.”\n\nThe Storm Queen smiled for the first time that afternoon and shook her head subtly. That smile quickly left her lips, however. The General had a point. She had spent so much time and effort coddling the Uzerasi only to need overwhelming force in order to deal with their treachery in the end anyway. What was the purpose of caution when it came to punishments if nobody ever listened to the warnings they were supposed to represent? Her monopoly on violence was the only kind of reminder that creatures seemed to respect.\n\n“Very well.” She returned calmly, “Schedule public executions of all captured traitors. A maximum of five creatures are to be killed per event. Three events a week.”\n\nNow it was Urzak’s turn to smile, “That’s more like it, seems like you’ve learned some important lessons from this debacle. The Storm King would be proud.”"

His father sighed, sitting opposite to Imzil alongside his wife. "I know you always wanted to go to university especially now that they've opened a bunch of new ones but don't you think this is a little much?" He forced a smile. "I'm sure if we worked a little harder at the factory we could get the money... in time."\n\nImzil held a steadfast gaze, having clearly thought this over. "I don't want to work in a factory forever dad." He tapped at the application. "This can be my ticket to doing what I want to do, it's the quickest and most reliable way to get a scholarship grant. Once I'm done with my studies I can get a job where I would be earning enough to even help you guys out."\n\n"But joining the army?" His mother intervened. "It's a dangerous life, you do know that right? I don't want to see my Imzil end up getting hurt, or worse!" Her fur tensed up making Imzil's father rub circles on her back.\n\n"I know that. I intend to take this seriously and keep myself safe. The moment I get my grant I'm quitting." Imzil looked at his parents with soft eyes. "Please mom, dad, I promise to not do anything stupid.

They were all reaching the age where they would soon need to go to prep school, so it was in their parents’ best interest to have them look for one where they would excel. "That concludes our tour, but before we go back to the entrance do any of you potential future students here have any questions?"\n\nOne small yeti child nervously raised his hand. "Um...yes ma'am. I heard my moms say something about this place being run by the army, is that true?" Many of the other children looked at the teacher with attention, it was a question they all wanted to hear the answer to.\n\nThe teacher smiled sweetly. "While we do many programmes with the military it would be inaccurate to say we are being "run" by them. From my understanding your parents may have concerns over how this school runs thanks to these connections but I can reassure you all there is nothing to worry about." She calmly explained with a smile.\n\n"When you study here you will first and foremost be a student. You saw during the tour we have classes dedicated to many different subjects and that's without even checking out our top-graded alumni. Besides it's not like working with the army is that scary, they are run by friendly yetis who are more than eager to help your bright minds, not to forget they can open many opportunities for your future!"\n\nHer words put most of the students at ease, even making a few excited.

The workers of a small factory close to Munmane could only watch on helplessly as the workplace their livelihoods depended on was stripped bare of its equipment by yeti soldiers and engineers. Meanwhile their now former boss was pointlessly arguing with the commander of the salvaging army.\n\n"We've done nothing wrong, none of us have ever even helped the revolt!" The workers would uneasily look between each other, noting a few missing coworkers while their boss continued to talk. "You can't punish loyal creatures like us this way!"\n\n"Sorry, sir." The commander said with an unapologetic tone. "But these are our orders following an authorised civilian requisition permit from the higher ups. Anything may be seized if it helps the war effort." He pulled out a paper holding said orders, making the employer open his jaw in shock.\n\n"But-but the revolt is over, this region has known nothing but peace!" The zebra boss's desperation could be heard in his voice. "What-what about my humble workers? Where are they supposed to go? We all need jobs!"\n\nThe yeti shrugged. "The army always has a need to keep itself running. Whether the conflict is at home or abroad, we're only doing this for your best will." He pocketed the orders. "As for you and your employees I wouldn't worry. Some big companies from the capital are beginning to establish themselves here, and they'll accept all the helping hooves they can find."

The Directorate of National Production was to have a simple purpose: Improving and optimising production processes in industries vital to national security. In non-jargon terms, that meant it was going to be managing military production for the foreseeable future. A complex and difficult yet absolutely necessary task. Such a vital sector could never be given to the hands - or hooves - of a more decentralised business structure, unlike the rest of the economy.\n\nShe returned the carriage on the machine for the next line of the document. The whole process had been meticulously planned already from chain of authority to procurement and adoption procedures, but of course it was always challenging to finalise such documents without mistakes. Several yetis had already offered to take the project off of her hands for Her Majesty’s convenience, but she had declined thus far.\n\nAlthough she would not have said so out loud, Ibyz Icepaw had quietly hoped that this ‘little’ project of hers would give her some semblance of satisfaction in her work. That had been missed, as of late.\n\nAfter a few more lines, the Storm Queen turned the roller knob clockwise and removed the final sheet of paper in the eighty-six page document from the clutches of the typewriter. All things considered it hadn’t taken too long and there was a reassuring sense of continuity in the work, yet the sense of satisfaction and pride in its completion was still absent. It seemed that sensation would only be prompted by the signing of the paperwork.\n\nThe yeti rummaged around her desk for a trench pen and grabbed a piece of scrap paper. It was always a good idea to make sure one’s signature was well-practiced for times like these.\n\nA couple of satisfactory scrawlings later and she took her pen from the scrap sheet to the final page of the document, signing it confidently. Another directorate for the books, or her codex of directorates more specifically. And yet...\n\nThe satisfaction from a job well done remained wholly absent. Everything was complete and all that remained was to send the document to the various ministries and have it copied. Ibyz Icepaw stood up and sat down again slowly, as though something physical was preventing the perfectionist within her from recognising the finished document.\n\nNothing.\n\nThe Storm Queen sat back in her office chair and quietly asked herself,"

He was afraid he would have to file for bankruptcy with the way things were going, only for things to turn for the better when, ironically, all that trouble started happening out west.\n\nSuddenly the kingdom needed way more than what its usual suppliers could cover, in a flash factories and plants like Dirka's had been given a second chance to provide the resources the government wanted, enough to make a profit that kept getting bigger and bigger by the day.\n\nDirka had made it in life, he was already thinking of expansion with the kingdom's ever consuming need. His proud gaze flickered over to one of the letters on his desk, from the capital no less. He couldn't help but hold onto the letter with fondness as it described how his factory would be subsidised by the kingdom among many similar plants like his, it meant Dirka would be receiving even more profit and that was all that mattered to him.\n\nSome would be concerned how their government would be able to afford spending this much money, Dirka looked over to a newspaper talking about the kingdom's newest conquests and how it would further enrich yetikind.

And maybe think twice before implying Her Majesty’s fallibility in such close proximity. These walls are thick but they’re not impenetrable.”\n\n“Oh I see, the Storm Queen is without reproach but her palace is not? That’s a double stan-” The louder of the pair continued for a moment before going silent and standing perfectly at attention like her partner.\n\nThey both heard something stirring inside, immediately making the more brazen creature of the two gulp as he remembered just how well sound could travel within these walls. A punishment was something she could manage, but such a thing from their commander-in-chief might end her promising career then and there if it were severe. The yeti regretted taking the risk of speaking all the more as they heard the noises disseminate into heavy steps approaching the door, silently praying that she would survive the dressing down that was sure to follow.\n\nThe guards braced themselves and stepped forward in perfect unison as the double doors swung open, prepared to meet and take orders from their monarch. They expected to be met by a towering and angry figure, but were instead greeted by a shambling mess of a yeti. One still capable of beating both of them to a pulp - mind you - but one that very clearly needed some space and silence that they were not providing.\n\n“Y-your Majesty,” The more nervous of the two soldiers managed, “Have you orders to relay?”\n\nThe Storm Queen looked at each of them without a discernible expression aside from that of mild discomfort. Her pelt was a mess and her eyes - though not bloodshot - looked as though they hadn’t seen her eyelids in days. It was difficult to tell whether the stress or lack of sleep was taking precedence in her appearance as thrust a piece of crumpled paper into the guard’s outstretched hand.\n\n“I want our enemies in the sub-Zebhara wiped out. Deliver that message to the general staff.

He hoped with all his heart the Queen would think differently this time.\n\nIbyz Icepaw expertly checked both sides of the gun, a low hum leaving her lips as she inspected the design in seconds. Just as fast, she readied and aimed it at a target. The crack of the gun boomed through the factory and made a few of the more nervous workers flinch back. Ibyz took a few more shots before deciding to stop. "I've seen enough." She stated with an unimpressed-sounding grunt, putting the gun down before walking away.\n\nMorik sighed, starting to feel the same shame as his friends had when one of the Storm Queen’s accompanying advisors approached him with a small smile. "You should feel proud, gunsmith." He whispered. "That's the most pleased I've seen the Queen in weeks."\n\nMorik blinked at the compliment, his eyes moving towards Ibyz, who still held that same air of complete disinterest at best and disappointment at worst.

Among the new arrivals, an unlikely group found themselves drawn together not by design, but by necessity. One particularly ambitious yeti had packed as if preparing for a decade-long campaign, dragging along enough baggage to outfit an entire expeditionary force. The zebra students, after some initial hesitation, offered their help, finding humor in their new roommate’s clear lack of spatial awareness.\n\nBy the time the last trunk was finally shoved into place, the barriers between them had already begun to fade. They shared stories of home, their reasons for enrolling, their cautious hopes for the future. It was an odd sight, even within these walls—young yetis and zebras working side by side without orders, without obligation. For the first time in generations, they were not conqueror and subject, but simply students, bound by the same ambitions and burdens.

But now, as yeti children shuffled inside for their first day of class, it became something more: a quiet symbol of the future being built.\n\nSome of the yetis hesitated at first, unused to sitting still for long periods, while others eagerly flipped through the crisp, new books set before them. The teacher, a zebra who had once taught in the cities of the west, moved between them with the practiced patience of someone accustomed to bridging gaps. The lesson began simply—numbers, letters, the building blocks of understanding—but the weight of the moment was not lost on anyone. For the first time, education in this remote part of the kingdom was not just for the zebras being brought into the fold, but also for the yetis who had long been left behind. This was not about trading one group’s success for another’s—it was a commitment that neither would be forgotten.\n\nBy midday, the initial stiffness had faded. A yeti and a zebra worked together on an arithmetic problem, passing the chalk between them as they puzzled it out. Another group, sitting near the window, whispered excitedly about the books they had been given, already absorbed in stories they had never heard before. This was not the old world giving way to the new, nor was it a forced compromise—it was something different entirely. A merging of paths, a careful weaving of traditions into a shared future. And as the bell rang to mark the end of the school day, the young yetis and zebras left their desks side by side, barely noticing the history they had just made."

This time, she went through the folder's contents more slowly, occasionally stopping to look up at the yeti who stayed patient, albeit confused.\n\nOnce she finished the stack and began to reread it, the yeti finally asked, “Is there something wrong, miss...?”\n\nThe matriarch looked up quickly this time, then back down at the page in her paws, “What's in it for you, exactly?”\n\n“Um...?” The yeti faltered briefly but regained composure. “Those details should be in articles fifteen to twenty-one, miss. Your company has a lot of potential, and I believe if I help you reach that potential, you’ll help me reach mine.”\n\n“It’ll be a few years before you start seeing returns,” She didn’t look up at him this time, but her ears faced him. “Why not sooner?”\n\nHe saw it now.

The proposal is simple on the surface: transfer control of the river borderlands to the Commonwealth in exchange for protection guarantees and a mutual freedom-of-movement pact.\n\nFor the Re’emites, it’s a tempting arrangement. The region’s inhabitants would retain full cultural and administrative autonomy; the only change would be that it is now yetis, not local guards, manning the fortifications—facing outward, not inward. Trade would continue. Life would, by all appearances, go on as normal.\n\nYet trust is a hard currency. Even under the Commonwealth's new leadership—whether pragmatic, noble, or idealistic—some in Re’em’s court see the offer as a velvet-gloved power grab. Others, more strategically minded, see an opportunity to gain a reliable bulwark in uncertain times without firing a shot. If the Commonwealth holds, the deal could be stabilizing.

The surprise isn’t in the request, but in how polite it is—almost... respectful.\n\nAnd stranger still, the zebras in question appear genuinely interested. Letters from Ovingoland report that many view the Commonwealth’s dual leadership experiment with cautious hope. The yetis, far from being the distant conquerors of old, are seen by some as fair stewards—perhaps even partners. That sentiment alone unsettles the Maregyptian council.\n\nFor some, this is a chance to let go of an old, costly project—one born in the shadow of conquest and held together by pride more than practicality. For others, it reeks of manipulation. Why would the yetis offer peace now, if not to soften the blow of future demands?

Only for recognition of the agreed border, the demilitarization of the contested zone, and a handful of additions—limited transit rights, neutral oversight of crossings, and a promise of no further escalation.\n\nTo some in the war council, it is bewildering.

To show her goodwill, they had brought along two dozen Aestlonian ponies to be reunited with their families, with hundreds more to be transferred over the following days. Though they reassured us that their release was not conditional on us accepting their offers, many within our government still see their "goodwill offering" as a reminder of the horrors the yetis visited on us.\n\nThe yetis and their zebra allies speak true when they say we could benefit from an alliance... our enemies in Karkadannistan could not hope to stand against the new Storm Queen, and their technology could bring prosperity unheard of in our remote corner of the world. But on the other hoof... whole villages of Aestlonians dragged off into slavery, our leaders humiliated and our riches plundered... there are a thousand reasons to refuse their outstretched paws, to suspect their gifts of being poisoned, to choose pride over expedience.

As a show of goodwill, the yetis have brought our old regalia which was stolen by the Storm King many years ago.\n\nDespite the Aestlonians' reassurances, many within the court fear that the yetis are merely trying to conquer us again with lies and economics, warning that the alliance they propose will inevitably turn into a subtler form of servitude to this emerging superpower."

The military, ever watchful of external threats and domestic instability, argues that resources should be directed toward developing chemical compounds with potential military applications—advancements that could give the commonwealth a decisive edge in future conflicts.\n\nThe Uzerasi elite, however, see research as something far more profound than just warfare. Their ancestors have long experimented with the mysteries of zebra alchemy, a tradition steeped in family pride and scholarly pursuit. To them, the study of alchemy is not only a matter of cultural identity but also a path to unlocking breakthroughs in medicine, metallurgy, and industry.\n\nTorn between these competing priorities, the commonwealth must decide: should research efforts be steered toward the art of war, ensuring the survival of the state at any cost? Or should they embrace the enigmatic potential of zebra alchemy, trusting in the unknown for the sake of long-term progress?"

No, this time, the dispute is about uniform trims.\n\nThe yetis, ever proud of their martial traditions, demand that their troops be allowed to wear cyan trims, a color they associate with the resilience and tenacity of their ancestors. To them, it is a symbol of their struggle for recognition and their rightful place in the commonwealth’s military.\n\nThe Uzerasi landowners, however, insist that the traditional pink trim remains in place. To them, it represents the heritage and prestige of their families, many of whom have historically commanded armies or maintained private militias. The thought of yetis discarding this tradition in favor of a different aesthetic is, to them, unacceptable.\n\nWhile this argument may seem trivial in the grand scheme of governance, it has become a point of symbolic contention. A decision must be made before this petty squabble escalates into something far more disruptive."

While fulfilling current military contracts is important, he argues that expanding into civilian markets and alternative arms development will ensure the factory’s survival even in times of peace. With more varied production lines, the facility could avoid stagnation and be more adaptable to future needs.\n\nOpposing him is an Uzerasi procurement officer, whose sole focus is the army's immediate requirements. She insists that shifting resources toward anything other than direct military production is shortsighted, given the pressing need to arm the troops. Diversification is a luxury, she claims, and in uncertain times, the military cannot afford to waste funds on long-term gambles.\n\nWhile neither side seeks outright conflict, the tension between pragmatism and ambition lingers.

Instead, it has become the latest flashpoint in the ongoing power struggles between the Commonwealth’s yeti military officials and its Uzerasi economic elite.\n\nA prominent Uzerasi noble, known for his investments in industry and trade, sees the railway as an opportunity to drive economic prosperity. He envisions cargo trains moving goods across the Commonwealth, linking remote communities with bustling markets and creating new centers of commerce. To him, the railway represents a foundation for long-term stability—after all, a prosperous Commonwealth is a strong Commonwealth.\n\nOpposing him is a high-ranking yeti officer who believes such economic concerns are secondary to military needs. He argues that the railway must first and foremost serve as a rapid troop transport network, ensuring that soldiers can be quickly deployed to troubled regions. With ongoing insurgencies and external threats still looming, he insists that prioritizing commerce over security is a reckless gamble.\n\nThe debate has reached the highest levels of government, with both factions demanding support for their vision. Do we embrace the noble’s dream of an economic revolution, ensuring wealth and prosperity for generations? Or do we heed the officer’s warnings, securing the Commonwealth’s borders and preparing for the battles to come? The decision will shape the future of the railway, and perhaps the nation itself."

The disagreement, while seemingly bureaucratic, has become a heated standoff between two prominent figures in the community: the local police commander and an influential Uzerasi trader.\n\nThe trader argues that the vote should be held in the town market, the heart of daily life and commerce. To him, it is the most practical choice—people are already gathered there, ensuring high turnout and widespread participation. Furthermore, he insists that holding the vote in a familiar and accessible location will foster a sense of community and trust in the system.\n\nThe police commander, however, is deeply concerned about the security of such an arrangement. A bustling marketplace is chaotic, prone to pickpockets, bribery, and potential riots. How can ballots remain safe when surrounded by merchants, customers, and opportunists? He argues that the police station is a far more secure location, where votes can be cast in an orderly and private manner without the risk of undue influence or fraud.\n\nWhile both sides have valid points, only one can prevail. The choice will determine whether the new voting system is seen as open and inviting, or as a strictly controlled process with an emphasis on security over accessibility."

A chorus of multiple apologetic "Yes, sir" could be heard from the batch of recruits, their many accents from Zwahile, Hayzeb, and Hyenia, to the farthest reaches of the Great Lakes, if you would listen closely.\n\n"Now, I want you all to run laps until I'm willing to forgive all your transgressions of the day!" He shot his pistol into the air, quickly making the recruits scatter to get running. "Move it!"\n\nIronically enough, despite the commander's harsh record when it came to training new soldiers, he still looked at the diverse group of recruits with promise in his eyes. An occasional small, almost hidden nod coming from him as the group tried their best to please him. They just needed to be sculpted into worthy soldiers for the Storm Queen and the kingdom, a task this commander had done many times before amongst his kin. These privates would be no different."

"Now, what would you do when dealing with a test subject refusing to partake in an experiment?"\n\n"Preferably I would try to incentivise compliance by offering any benefits, regardless of whether they can be given or not," she hummed. "Otherwise, force may be required."\n\n"What do you do when an assistant refuses to help in an experiment while citing any kind of 'moral dilemmas'?"\n\nCloudmaker rolled her eyes. "I do hope the directorate has better assistants than that. I hate working with bleeding hearts. In such a situation I would have to do it myself before reporting the assistant for refusal to do their job."\n\n"Sometimes a few odd ones slip in here," the interviewer laughed. "Finally, how do you feel about a subject expiring during an experiment?"\n\nCloudmaker shrugged. "If they died in the pursuit of science, then it was for a good cause. Not many creatures can say that." She almost missed the approving glint in the interviewer's eyes. "If I may ask my own question, how many work hours do we have in a week?""

The yeti, instead, tripped.\n\nThe clang of the container falling scared a few workers out of their work, but it paled in comparison when Krik heard the ripping of the fallen yeti's suit. She had a front-row seat to the yeti looking down in horror at his broken suit. He looked towards Krik with wide eyes before the chemicals quickly got to him. She and the rest of her coworkers could only watch on helplessly as the yeti convulsed and thrashed around, his now useless mask barely muffling his horrified screams.\n\nThey knew the consequences of working here, and, once the tabun got to you, it was over.

Ibyz Icepaw was sat on a creaking dining chair in the middle of the room covered in cuts, bruises and an absurd number of gunshot wounds. Her arms were covered in blood and her hands were practically dripping as she stood up in spite of her heaving frame, drawing an immense blade out of the nearest body and looking up at the rebel Captain.\n\nShe lifted the oversized sword with one hand and ran the blunted cutting edge along a metal plate on her other arm, goading the Marksist into a duel with a twisted smile. “Ravakh.”\n\nThat address alone made his skin crawl and his fur stand on end.

SLC_commie_tree.24.d:0 "Teenage yetis and a few zebras, dressed in school uniforms, sat quietly as their yeti teacher passed by their desks, placing a copy of a book on each. The more curious students took a closer look, reading the book's title. It read "Social Justice Party Manifesto by Caramel Marks, with commentary by Ravakh Cloudcracker", in bold gilded letters on a red background.\n\nAs the teacher finished distributing the books, he returned back to his desk. "As you can see, this month's required reading is a Marksist classic. It'll help you understand the basics of modern politics, serving as an excellent introduction to the rest of the material in this course."\n\nOne student with glasses was quickly reading through the introduction. She then raised a hoof.\n\nThe teacher nodded. "Yes? Go ahead."\n\n"Um... this seems pretty heavily edited... like, there's a lot of commentary... also, it's very uh, Equestrian? Like, I'm not sure how it's relevant to us on the other side of the world... I didn't even see the Uzerasi being mentio-"\n\nThe teacher let out an exasperated sigh. "Thank you, that's enough. I hate to admit it, but you raise some good points. But nevertheless, it's just an introduction. Later during this course, we'll take a look at a more... local perspective."\n\nThe zebra student raised her hoof again.\n\nThe teacher tried not to groan. "Yes?"\n\n"I have an idea... how about we can optionally pick what book we read? As long as it's relevant to the course subject?"\n\nThe teacher frowned and stroked his white beard with his hand.

Seems everyone's present. Let's get started with the meeting, then," a yeti said. "The agenda of today's discussion is financial compensation for nationalization. We've received quite a few reports of former property owners demanding it. Some have even threatened legal action, apparently unaware that the seizures are fully lawful. This has led to rising tensions, protests and even some instances of violence. So, it has been proposed that we do start distributing compensations, even if it drains our coffers."\n\nA zebra laughed. "Hah! There's nothing wrong with the expropriation of expropriators. Let them cry and whine as much as they want. Gives us an excuse to crack down on them hard."\n\n"Personally," said another yeti wearing glasses. "I think it would be worth the expenses to prevent any sort of reactionary counter-revolution. It would help increase public support for our government as well."\n\n"Giving anything to the robbers of the people is an outrage," the zebra replied with an offended frown.\n\nSoon others at the table joined the conversation, which would last over an hour.

Gone are the days when a massed charge of mighty yeti warriors could break the lines of the enemy. It's all about blowing them up from afar. As such, I expect you to pay close attention during today's training. We will learn the basics of how to load and aim artillery guns. If you do well, you'll get a live fire exercise later on, as a treat."\n\nThe trainees obeyed and the training session started. During it, they were taught exactly what the officer had said. They then practiced what they had learned with a simple targeting exercise. Maps were given displaying a village occupied by enemy soldiers, and they had to calculate how to hit these targets from their firing positions. However, during this one of the soldiers raised a hand. "Sir, I have a question."\n\nThe officer approached her. "What is it?"\n\n"What's our doctrine on targeting civilian housing? This map has a village, which clearly isn't a military target."\n\n"You're right about that." He nodded, then took a step backwards and faced all of the other soldiers, raising the volume of his voice. "A very good question was asked, and I feel like I should clarify it for all of you:""

He approached the officer and said: "Sir, may I ask something?"\n\nHe received a nod in response.\n\n"We won't actually be sent into the front to occupy a machine gun position, unless absolutely necessary, right? I thought us reservists would be used in a more auxiliary role... What's the official policy on reservists nowadays?

"We were given authorization to bypass legal process and deal with her on our own. So I suppose it is up to me to decide, in the end."\n\n"So... what will be done?"\n\n"We must do what we must. It's our revolutionary duty to execute social justice as envisioned by Caramel Marks."\n\nThe soldier raised an eyebrow. "Ma'am, no offence but that does not answer my question.

Then they asked me to deliver these demands to you," she answered and took out a letter, which she then placed on his desk.\n\nHe frowned and opened it with a paper knife, then read what was written on it. His frown only deepened. "They want the ability to secede? And receive full freedom of religion?"\n\nThe yeti nodded.\n\n"We give them so much and they're still ungrateful..." he let out a deep sigh and slumped on his chair, putting down the letter.

On this basis, it would be wise to accept such a deal; especially considering the failure of our subjects. The public are not so easily swayed however, having heard much of the destruction previously wrought by the yetis. The population is in favour of continuing the war in an effort to stave off the suffering the white death will undoubtedly bring once and for all.\n\nWith popular and political opinions in deadlock, the decision is ultimately left to [ROOT.GetLeader]."

Not a terrible position to be in, it is true; but perhaps a situation we would have preferred to avoid for long-term economic growth, amongst other things.\n\nThis will no doubt mean an extension of a conflict which we had intended to be relatively fast, but at least it will give us the opportunity to stamp out the influence of Equus here and now.

"And before you interrupted me, I was explaining how much our society contradicts Caramel Marks' writings."\n\n"As far as I am concerned," the zebra said while adjusting her glasses, "Comrade Ravakh has done an excellent job building the foundation of communism."\n\n"It's like you didn't even listen. Like I said, capitalism was not yet fully matured, so the revolution was not driven by class consciousness arising from contradictions between the productive forces and social relations of society. It was an artificial, forceful revolution."\n\nThe zebra sighed. "Spare me from your determinism. Marks never claimed her model of historical materialism to be dogma, merely a guide based on specifically Equestrian material conditions. We've simply adapted it to ours."\n\n"There can be no true dictatorship of the proletariat without a fully developed and conscious proletariat."\n\n"So what? You propose we embrace capitalism in the name of socialism? So we do things 'by the book'?" She laughed.\n\nNow the yeti was turning red. "I am not advocating for capitalism, but for the patient development of productive forces! You can't rush through historical processes!""\n\nThe yeti who had arrived late raised his hand.\n\n"Yes?" the two arguing students asked in unison."

Otherwise, I wouldn't have joined the ZLA."\n\nAs they walked, they passed by a brightly lit building covered in graffiti that had loud music coming from the inside. "What happened to the old palace since I was last here?" the yeti asked.\n\n"Oh, yeah. It's been turned into a youth club." Again, the zebra chuckled. "I dread to think how many drugs they're doing in there."\n\n"Let kids be kids, as long as they don't cause trouble," the yeti replied with a nod.\n\nThe two kept walking, passing by an abandoned police building. "By the way, the palace reminded me, who will you vote for in the local council elections?" the zebra asked.\n\nThe question was met with a shrug. "Since they abolished parties, you have to really know the people you vote for. And I'm not familiar enough with any of the candidates."\n\nA third chuckle from the zebra. "Clearly, I should try to get elected then, as I'd have at least one guaranteed vote."\n\nThe yeti smiled. "A zebra in the people's council of [ROOT.capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]?

Closing all of them in the entire country, in fact."\n\nThe yeti slumped on her chair. "Unbelievable. Who do they think will keep the streets safe?"\n\n"Well, the idea is that police are a 'tool of state oppression'. So instead of using violence and prisons, they will try to use 'transformative justice' to nip crime in the bud, if I understood it right. And any security forces that do exist will be locally organized instead."\n\n"That's ridiculous. Everything's just going to devolve into gang violence and protection rackets. Also, who are 'they' anyways? Who's in charge now? I can't even tell."\n\n"The government, I guess, or what's left of it. They basically want to leave as much as possible on the local level, rather than national."\n\nShe shook her head in response. "We live in sad times. What are we supposed to do after we're fired?"\n\n"I dunno. I think I'll just join the ZLA."\n\n"They're keeping the army around, at least?"\n\n"Of course. The army is what started this revolution, and they've said they will safeguard it for as long as needed."\n\nShe sighed."

"Documentation, please," he asked in a dry voice.\n\nThe yeti inside the car nodded. "Certainly. One moment..." After a while of rummaging through the glove compartment, she offered the border guard a passport and several papers.\n\nHe took and checked them, his eyes quickly and professionally scanning through them. "Everything seems to be in order, Ms. Adukh Graupel." The documents were offered back to the driver, and the border guard went to open the gate. Inside the car, "Adukh" sighed in relief.\n\nThen another border guard, a yeti, came running. "Stop! Don't open it!"\n\n"What? What's wrong?"\n\n"I checked and that car matches the description of a dissident's escape vehicle!"\n\nAs the zebra turned to look at it, the car's engine suddenly roared as it accelerated towards him and the gate. He jumped out of the way as the vehicle smashed into it, but failed to break through.\n\nThe yeti guard took out a gun and aimed it at the driver's head. "Stop! Get out of the car with your hands up!"\n\nThe driver tried to reverse, but the car was now stuck in the broken metal gate.\n\n"You have three seconds before I shoot!"\n\nResigned to her fate, the yeti whose name was not Adukh opened the car's door and climbed out of it, her hands raised in surrender and her head hanging low."

SLC_commie_tree.83.t:0 "A Note From the Yetis"
SLC_commie_tree.83.d:0 "Much to the surprise of the administration, we have received an interesting offer from the yetis.\n\nThe contents can be simply boiled down as follows: The yetis are willing to offer us and the rest of our alliance an opportunity to remove ourselves from what they describe as an ‘artificial Hippogriff client state’ which - so they say - should rightfully be controlled and integrated into their federation.\n\nMany in the administration believe this offer to be both unprecedented and valuable, considering their previous ruler’s penchant for unfettered conquest. On this basis, it would be wise to accept such a deal; especially considering their currently assembled forces and proximity to Winggarden. The public are not so easily swayed however, having heard much of the destruction previously wrought by the yetis. The population is in favour of maintaining control over our Arisian subject state in an effort to stave off the suffering the white death will undoubtedly bring once and for all.\n\nWith popular and political opinions in deadlock, the decision is ultimately left to [ROOT.GetLeader]."

SLC_commie_tree.84.d:0 "Excellent news reaches the administration this day!\n\n[FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to our polite suggestion of hastily removing their political influence from Hippogriffia. Of course, this means that they have effectively abandoned the Arisians to their fate at our hands; which will no doubt mean a swift and simple transfer of power in the region. Their government has requested that we not make light of their decision to leave their newly acquired subject state to our tender mercies, to which we shall begrudgingly acquiesce.\n\nPreparations have already been made to assist in escorting their troops out of military bases within Hippogriffia, which should ease the process of stabilisation as well as allowing us access to their stockpiles and military infrastructure. This is truly a great day for yetikind!"

SLC_commie_tree.85.t:0 "Our Offer Declined"
SLC_commie_tree.85.d:0 "Dissatisfying news reaches the government today.\n\n[FROM.GetNameDef] has declined our generous offer of hastily removing their political influence from Hippogriffia despite the evident preparedness of our troops at the current moment. This means that they have essentially confirmed that any attempt to gain control over the creatures of Aris will result in total war. Not a terrible position to be in, it is true; but perhaps a situation we would have preferred to avoid for long-term economic growth, amongst other things.\n\nThis will no doubt mean an extended conflict which we had initially hoped to be relatively fast, but at least it will give us the opportunity to stamp out reactionary influences here and now.

"Ah, hello there!" she said, looking at the former farmer. "Another new worker I presume? You folks keep coming, which is great. All hands and hooves on deck!"\n\nThe zebra ignored the cheesy phrase.

It was difficult to see over the wings of his fighter plane, prompting him to regularly bank from side-to-side in order to check for any possible targets coming from below; but none emerged. Only when his radio crackled to life did he recognise the tell-tale growl of a second engine rapidly closing in.\n\n“Do you know what fontanelles are, rookie?” Came the voice of his squadron’s new instructor through what sounded vaguely like a wide smile.\n\nAs Crimson One emerged from behind a cloud and barrelled straight towards him, Gyzrak barely had time to react by turning into and around the dive whilst trying to respond. “Sir?!”\n\nA condescending chuckle returned over the radio as the attacking aircraft pulled out of the dive and followed its prey into the turn, having gained a far greater amount of velocity from the initial manoeuvre. The rookie couldn’t manage anything more in response as he performed a panicked half of a clockwise aileron roll, diving into another cloud to try and throw off his pursuer whilst gaining enough speed to not be caught shortly afterwards.\n\nAgain the static of the radio receded for a few moments as the ace continued on, “A friend was telling me about them. They’re these... things, between the bones of your skull which let the pieces move around a bit when you’re real young. It’s how your head grows without crushing your brain, apparently. More importantly though, it means the top and back of your skull is pretty fragile relative to the front of it. That stuff’s brittle. It can shatter with a decent hit, even once it's hardened.”\n\nHaving exited the cloud, condensation covered the outside of the cockpit and Gyzrak was flying almost blind as he saw a familiar silhouette banking around his short-lived hiding spot and diving down towards him again. The small overhead mirror didn’t give him a good idea of how far away his instructor was, but he had a sinking feeling that this mock dogfight was only going to last a few more seconds.\n\n“Point is,” Crimson continued, trying his best to stifle the growing excitement in his tone as he levelled his crosshairs at the rookie’s aircraft. “Don’t let your enemies get to those bits of you; or your plane, for that matter.

Ironically, his survival is thanks in large part to Ibyz Icepaw who offered him amnesty if he agreed to pay lip service and cooperate with the occupation forces that followed the invasion. Whilst the family and its legacy survives, it’s fair to say that their current arrangement isn’t exactly what Imamu would describe as ideal.\n\nFor his part however, Imamu remains very optimistic and ever-charismatic. Since the western revolt he and the Storm Queen now work closely together in an attempt to manage the curious internal politics of the Dual Monarchy. Although it took some time for Ibyz Icepaw to forgive his treachery, the pair are now closer than ever.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: RyanBoi"

SLC_noble_integ:0 "Soft Hoof Strategies"
SLC_noble_integ_desc:0 "A soft hoof in all matters military and police is required for the majority of creatures to gain newfound respect for the state. There is nothing to gain from the immediate application of force, save an even larger rebellion within months and this was proven during the reconstruction period. It is time now to be reconciliatory, not hasty. Let us offer an olive branch instead of a bullet."

SLC_army_integ_desc:0 "Although we mean to be careful with the application of force, it is absolutely clear that there is an element of speed that is necessary when dealing with certain issues.

SLC_army_army_desc:0 "The military staff are understandably still a little miffed that we agreed to the demands of the western revolt. They are however more than happy to receive a new wave of funding and a structural reorganisation that will integrate a larger number of zebra officers who they consider much more reasonable friends than the nobles. It will be some time until things settle down, but for now we can still enjoy the benefits of a modernised general staff."

With further technological developments, our infantry will no doubt be the very zenith of discipline and skill."

SLC_army_tactics_desc:0 "Speed has always been key in warfare. No matter the means by which we strike our enemies, it must be done immediately and with incredible force.

SLC_dual_reemite_freedom_desc:0 "Although Re’emites are not technically a member of the larger Great Laker cultural sphere, they have long had ties with the various groups of the region. Not only that, but their kind lies in a strategically crucial position, on either side of a large river that otherwise separates zebras from horses. It has thus been agreed that the commonwealth will be granted ownership of Zombori for strategic purposes in return for the freedom of travel of Re’emites in and out of the country as well as a military guarantee for Re’em itself."

Given the importance and breadth of services that the Zebrican Liberation Army is responsible for, it’s less like mandatory frontline service and more like a mass government work programme in which you can end up doing all sorts of different tasks.

We may go to war to annex anything we can get our hands on, but we don’t do it senselessly or to ‘redistribute’ wealth back to the Rainband. We do it because the international Marksist revolution needs a spark that only we are currently capable of providing to the dormant socialist kindling of the world.

SLC_third_deluge_idea:0 "The Last Struggle"
SLC_third_deluge_idea_desc:0 "Perhaps the reason for the failures of our previous two attempts at crossing the continent with constant warfare are the result of rampant authoritarianism in addition to the instability caused by the destruction of many governments and the destabilisation of societies. Perhaps the Third Deluge should be one of civilisation and true reconstruction, prioritising social and economic harmoniousness before Marks. Is that so difficult to achieve?"

SLC_rocking_the_airship_idea:0 "Collective Dialogue"
SLC_rocking_the_airship_idea_desc:0 "Though it may pain the hardline Marksists to admit it, their ignorance regarding the complexities of the societies that they conquered has led only to instability and disunity. Their inability to cooperate with the constituent states that they established within the federal republic is proof enough of their incompetence and of the necessity of that kind of dialogue. No longer shall we make sweeping changes without consulting those that will be most affected!"

SLC_our_utopia_idea:0 "The Final Struggle"
SLC_our_utopia_idea_desc:0 "The revolutionary fire has not yet burnt out. Though we needed to fan it back to life from near-cold embers, we have protected the ideals of internationalism that we hold so dear in our ultimate objective for Marksism and the creatures that live within our borders. A utopia of our design is still possible and we will do all that we can to realise it, even if it means getting our already dirty hands a little dirtier still."

SLC_left_side_utopia_subject_idea:0 "Allies of the Cause"
SLC_left_side_utopia_subject_idea_desc:0 "Our friends in the Eye of the Storm have given us some special attention, it seems. Although our administration is young, we know better than to say no to their demands and so it is that their requests have been implemented. Unfortunately that has resulted in a significant economic downturn, but at the very least they’ve promised to help us further industrialise... in the future. We’ll have to see if they’re telling the truth in time."

SLC_right_side_utopia_subject_idea:0 "Friends of the Cause"
SLC_right_side_utopia_subject_idea_desc:0 "Our friends in the Eye of the Storm have given us some special attention, it seems! Although our administration is young, we know better than to say no to their demands and so it is that their requests have been implemented. Amazingly this has resulted in more autonomy for us overall, prompting a not insignificant number of volunteers to throw in with our benefactors. Long live the revolution and its brave soldiers!"

SLC_depth_operations_idea:0 "Destruction From Afar"
SLC_depth_operations_idea_desc:0 "Investing in long-term research projects for fire support solutions is the most logical way of maintaining tactical superiority on the battlefield. That reality is perhaps a little uninteresting but this is nevertheless the historically reliable method that will guarantee notable improvements in equipment over time. Unless we can make infantry entirely redundant - and what would we replace them with if not for other soldiers - we’re confident that this is the best way in which to proceed with our military research."

SLC_dear_grid_coordinates_idea:0 "Ordinance of the Future"
SLC_dear_grid_coordinates_idea_desc:0 "As it turns out, having more equipment at your disposal is generally beneficial; especially when you’re surrounded by enemies on all sides. We’ve had to learn that the hard way and have learned plenty of tricks to preserve as much output on the production line as possible, not to mention what we’ve managed to achieve in terms of design simplification. There isn’t much that excites as far as production lines go, but a consistent output of weapons certainly puts a smile on the soldiers’ faces."

SLC_fedral_forces_idea:0 "Serving the Federation"
SLC_fedral_forces_idea_desc:0 "The partial collapse of the Zebrican Liberation Army has allowed us some leeway in reforming the military to the benefit of non-yetis and the general discipline of the force. Although professional, the ZLA was largely a mere rebranding of the military that was established by Ibyz Icepaw. This moment of chaos in the tapestry of our victory will allow for us to reforge a more powerful, loyal and zealous fighting force than anything our predecessors could have achieved."

SLC_zeeb_unrest_cat_desc:0 "Though the civil war is over, the privileges granted to both the §PUzerasi§! and the zebras all along the §8Zwahile Coast§! before and during it cannot simply be ignored. It is thanks to those privileges and §3Ibyz Icepaw§!’s broad policy of governing by concession prior to the civil war that the western zebras - and the influential §PUzerasi§! families in particular - have a reasonably sized power base upon which they can organise and resist our rule, if they deem it necessary.\n\nIf a rebellion along the §8Zwahile Coast§! is to be avoided, we must keep a significant number of our promises regarding those privileges and their relationship with the central government must be §Ybetter§! than §Rconcerningly negative§!.\n\nCurrently observers have estimated their relationship with the central government to be: [SLC_how_angry_zeebs_loc]\n\nThe armed forces claims that such a rebellion could be easily crushed if it were to occur, but for it to happen a considerable shift away from the §3Storm Queen§!’s previous style of governance would need to take place. Many doubt she would do such a thing, given her historical amiability to the §PUzerasi§! and the §8Zwahile Coast§! as a whole; but it is not entirely out of the question..."

SLC_pardon_the_penal_divisions:0 "Pardon the Correctional Divisions"
SLC_pardon_the_penal_divisions_desc:0 "Though their crimes were as severe as their punishment detail in the armed forces would suggest, there is no longer any need for the correctional division system. They served the directorate dutifully and granting them a pardon for their efforts would paint the new regime in a positive light."

SLC_reduce_factory_hours:0 "Regulate the Sweatshops"
SLC_reduce_factory_hours_desc:0 "Whilst wartime production provided an adequate excuse for criminally low wages for zebra workers in some factories, the succession war is now over. It will be good for our relations with the zebras to properly regulate these factories from here on out, though taking the time to ensure working conditions are appropriate will hamper our production significantly."

SLC_build_inner_uzerasi:0 "Develop the Uzerasi Interior"
SLC_build_inner_uzerasi_desc:0 "Mzizima remains easily the most developed part of the Zwahile, even after a prolonged period of industrialisation. It is only fair that the hard work of the Uzerasi is rewarded with investment whilst allocating additional funds to the continued development of the city’s surrounding provinces that are lacking in productivity. Every city needs its food and every farm needs its tools, after all."

SLC_build_uzerasi_islands:0 "Industrialise the Uzerasi Islands"
SLC_build_uzerasi_islands_desc:0 "Having been partially under the control of Ivkus Hailstorm, the islands that were once part of the Uzerasi Kingdom have received little attention in recent years. Their prior importance as trading posts and transshipment ports disappeared almost immediately after the Storm King’s invasion of the Zwahile, leaving these large but sparsely populated islands to sustain themselves on subsistence farming. It is high time that Zanzibuck and Comereos were modernised and redeveloped, now that we have the necessary resources and control to pursue such a project."

SLC_force_industrialise_upper_hayzeb:0 "Urbanise Upper Hayzebland"
SLC_force_industrialise_upper_hayzeb_desc:0 "Upper Hazyebland contains many zebras, yet it is a far cry from the centres of development that can be found in its Lower Hayzebland counterpart. Whilst making up the difference is frankly an impossibility as a result of the sheer disparity in local standards of living, we can do a lot to improve the situation there. Unfortunately, the locals seem to find some peace in the status quo; possibly because they are temporarily content to enjoy the freedoms afforded to them under our rule. There is no doubt this balance will be upset by our efforts to develop the region."

SLC_force_industrialise_zwhaile:0 "Forcefully Settle the Zwahile"
SLC_force_industrialise_zwhaile_desc:0 "As a result of the innumerable conflicts between the Mazwi and the Uzerasi, much of the Zwahile has adopted a semi-nomadic lifestyle in order to cope with the constantly changing borders, raids and frequent battles. Now that this situation has abated, these habits have become detrimental to the development and industrial potential of the region. It will take a lot of negotiating and possibly a little force, but we’ll make sure they settle down properly. Let’s just hope that the process isn’t a spark for something greater."

SLC_bring_east_up_to_par:0 "Invest in the East"
SLC_bring_east_up_to_par_desc:0 "Much like the Zwahile, the eastern stretches of the Storm Kingdom are comparatively quite underdeveloped relative to the rest of our core territory. That is largely due to their simple distance from the industrial heartlands of Karen and the Eye of the Storm, but it is still an issue that we must address. Investment in the east will help to alleviate standard of living issues in the region as well as invigorating the national economy."

SLC_revitalise_the_trade_routes:0 "Revitalise Overseas Trade"
SLC_revitalise_the_trade_routes_desc:0 "Although the disunited tribes of yetis were never particularly reliant on or proficient in the art of trading, the brief period of unity before its subsequent collapse contained a generally overlooked rise in trade with other countries overseas. The absence of trade tariffs in the national budget has certainly been felt and we would do well to incentivise what knowledgeable merchants we still have to go out and continue their work. The Uzerasi will also play a key role in these plans, given their familiarity with the region and their superior reputation in the realm of trade."

SLC_the_western_revolt:0 "The Western Rebellion"
SLC_the_western_revolt_desc:0 "It is readily apparent to our loyal informants that the western zebras of the Zwahile Coast are immensely displeased by our rule and are preparing to rebel. It seems that the Uzerasi - the most influential family group of the region - are largely responsible for arming and directing the growing resistance.\n\nWhilst we cannot stop them organising, our legions should be capable of putting down this revolt; if the Storm Queen allows it to come to that..."

We cannot allow elites to throw their influence around in economic matters when the livelihoods of the average citizen are at stake. We will conduct a thorough audit of KMS, remove those who should not be in the positions they currently have and replace them with others who display talent for their respective roles.

SLC_invest_in_hailbane:0 "Rein In the Designers at Hailbane"
SLC_invest_in_hailbane_desc:0 "Hailbane was effectively a bottomless money pit for Ikvus Hailstorm almost immediately after it was created and that was part of the reason why he ‘let’ such an asset slip out of his fingers. Despite his absence, the absurdist tank designers of this company managed to survive on donations from bitter veterans and industrial contracts that never went anywhere. Though their survival is a testament to yeti resilience, it is about time somebody put their hoof down with these maniacs before they send off patent requests for their sixteenth impossible super-heavy tank."

SLC_invest_in_snowchain:0 "Develop Snowchain's Plant Infrastructure"
SLC_invest_in_snowchain_desc:0 "Unlike Hailbane, Snowchain doesn’t need much in the way of a total overhaul in their management structure and corporate ethos. Rather, their monopoly on car and vehicle production in general needs to be broken so that they may continue to innovate on their designs and ensure a technological edge for the its military contracts with the state. It might seem counterintuitive to encourage the growth of a large corporation by funding its competition, but the results may prove to be worthwhile."



SLC_red_coup_countdown_cat:0 "The Red Officers' Plot"
SLC_red_coup_countdown_cat_desc:0 "The rebellion of the Zwahile and the open defiance of the Uzerasi has put Her Majesty’s capabilities under intense scrutiny. With the army cemented as the sole political entity responsible for keeping the kingdom together, Ravakh Cloudcracker is already working to weaken Her Majesty’s position further.\n\nThough his military clique is miniscule in the broader organisation of the armed forces, Ravakh is a charismatic yeti. The vast majority that do not align themselves with or understand his Marksist ideology respect his intellect and judgement all the same, which has put the monarchy in a precarious situation. Until this civil conflict is resolved his antics will be nigh impossible to stop.\n\nIf the monarchy is to survive the coming months, we must defeat this revolt quickly and decisively."

SLC_red_coup_countdown_mission:0 "Ravakh Makes His Move"
SLC_red_coup_countdown_mission_desc:0 "Ravakh Cloudcracker’s curious infatuation with Marksism has long been known to Ibyz Icepaw, but it is only recently that circumstances have allowed for him to begin exercising his political influence. Before the western rebellion there were many checks in place to ensure that military cliques like his could have no real political impact, but now the military runs the kingdom.\n\nLet us hope that the revolt can be crushed soon."



SLC_collab_dealing_with_great_lakes_cat:0 "Pacifying the Great Lakes"
SLC_collab_dealing_with_great_lakes_cat_desc:0 "Whilst Her Majesty has little desire to expend copious resources in an effort to fully integrate the Great Lakes, it is undeniable that the area has great economic potential. With the help of our now perfected collaboration methods, it should be possible to pacify and control the region; receiving maximum monetary benefits at a relatively minimal cost in lives and state finances.\n\nPractically speaking, we should tackle no more than two areas at a time so as to minimise regional instability and guarantee the cooperation of the disparate Great Laker creatures."

SLC_collab_mazwi_and_mozzi_desc:0 "Feudalism and tribalism are nothing before collaborationist developmentalism.

SLC_collab_zarhay:0 "Their Righteous Retribution"

SLC_collab_alwani:0 "Break their Bonds"

SLC_collab_ovingoland:0 "Their Magnanimous Overlords"
SLC_collab_ovingoland_desc:0 "Unlike the majority of Great Laker creatures, zebras in Ovingoland have been far more receptive to our rule; albeit largely because we have successfully spun our narrative of their liberation from Maregypt by our hands.

SLC_collab_zombori:0 "The Final Piece"

A rebellion against the very same yeti that he had half-knowingly helped into her position of absolute power for years, no less.

Their ship, the High Tide, was one of only a few to survive first contact with the new and previously unseen Hippogriffian aircraft.\n\n It was on the slow - and thankfully peaceful - journey home that he came across a particular political piece.

The yeti civil war and the state’s subsequent period of stabilisation also did a lot to cement yetis as a whole as victims of the Storm King in his eyes, albeit victims that profited from his madness.

Nonetheless, the rapidly recovering frontlines certainly aren’t complaining about how quickly they’re receiving replacement weapons and bodies.\n\nHailing from a long line of headstrong zebras, Zuwena has a personality that grates and a pride which she only gets away with thanks to her efficacy. Some theorise that she was once nobility, but she refuses to confirm or deny her family’s history beyond acknowledging the military leaders that came before her.

He was one of the only naval officers to express any interest in Marksism whatsoever prior to the revolution and as a result was a favourite of the ROMM from the start. This being said, he was never influential in naval circles previously for what some would consider a very good reason.\n\nHe is notable for his particularly aggressive strategies and was frequently reprimanded by officers of higher rank for these kinds of actions during training at a time when ships and naval funding were both in short supply. These days such tactics are more acceptable, but even so it is expected that his superiors will follow him around with beady eyes until they’re happy that he won't be wasting resources. We can’t be losing ships when dealing with the great enemy of yetikind.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: BlakaSmoko"

Once a low-level analyst in the Storm King’s intelligence corps, Paz survived the chaos of the deluge by vanishing entirely, only to resurface years later with a network of informants, dossiers, and secrets stretching from the Thunder Coast to the Zwahile and from the Home Isle to the Great Lakes.\n\nAn elusive yeti with a gift for silence and subtlety, Paz is infamous for her ability to uncover plots before even the conspirators themselves realize they're involved. Some claim she has files on every major figure in the world—others believe she writes the files herself to control them. Regardless, everyone knows: Paz already knows what you've done."

SLC_starting_advisor_1:0 "Rakka Snowsheet"
SLC_starting_advisor_1_desc:0 "Drawn to Ibyz Icepaw’s preferred style of intensively bureaucratic preparation on all matters pertaining to the state and its organisation, Rakka Snowsheet did not need to be persuaded to stay when the civil war broke out. Between a mysterious storm creature, a mad mage and a corrupt industrialist it wasn’t exactly difficult to pick a side for someone with even the smallest of moral compasses. Supposedly Gyz Windborn at least had good intentions, but the chances of a stable and responsible state emerging from the chaos were higher without the oligarchs to worry about.\n\nAlthough the fate of the kingdom is not yet set in stone, Rakka has been quite pleased with his choice of crown contender thus far. Her steady hands have kept things stable enough for the intricacies of his work to be felt and enjoyed by all. Not many creatures even know that he exists, being cut from the same emotionally distant cloth as his superior; yet he will be happy knowing simply that his work is appreciated."

SLC_starting_advisor_2:0 "Roz Blackice"
SLC_starting_advisor_2_desc:0 "Roz Blackice was lucky enough to retire - at least from the military - a mere couple of years after the invasion of the Great Lakes. Unfortunately for her, a military stipend and a quiet life were not enough to keep her mind occupied over the course of a day and eventually she found herself back in Ibyz Icepaw’s employ; though now as a military production specialist. Rather than use her expertise in combat again, Roz wisely elected to use what she had learned in equipment field repairs to guide the establishment’s military production requirements.\n\nThough she hasn’t yet been able to insert herself somewhere in the Uzerasi family hierarchy as of yet and may never achieve that goal, Roz Blackice has made some progress economically in taking over some of their businesses. Normally that would be cause for significant unrest, but she has found a friend in Zurku Boltprow who graciously provides her with all the information required to conduct a hostile takeover of any business that gets caught cooking their books."

SLC_starting_advisor_3:0 "Sejzur Iceceiling"
SLC_starting_advisor_3_desc:0 "A minor cog in the bureaucratic nightmare that was Storm King's campaign of conquest and attempted godhood, Sejzur played his part dutifully and admirably. Unfortunately, he regularly found himself at an impasse with how everything was run in the kingdom and was always trying to please the might-makes-right advisors that held sway over his station.\n\nThat was until Sejzur’s presence was requested in the west as an economic overseer for Ibyz Icepaw who, like him, understood the necessity of long-term economic planning. He rapidly found common ground with the Field Marshal and developed an appreciation for her bureaucratic talents, sharing an ideal of pragmatic collaboration with the natives of the region."

SLC_starting_advisor_4:0 "Zurku Boltprow"
SLC_starting_advisor_4_desc:0 "Zurku Boltprow has operated in the Zwahile since before Ibyz Icepaw was stationed there, although at the time he was little more than an informant in Mzizima. He had been experienced enough and had run the bakery at which he worked successfully enough to expand the operation there, but his pleas to begin establishing a proper network of agents became meaningless the moment the Storm King invaded the region; crushing the Uzerasi Kingdom and their nobility on which he was supposed to be gathering information.\n\nOut of spite he still occasionally cooperates with Roz Blackice to specifically shut down Uzerasi-owned businesses on white-collar charges, but nowadays he operates at a much higher level. Having moved from the payroll of the Storm King to that of Ibyz Icepaw, his old network remains in the Zwahile to this day; but he is now also responsible for the recruitment and training of any and all collaborators that seek to serve yetikind without stepping straight out into a hail of gunfire."

SLC_army_chief_1_desc:0 "§YBorn§!: 4th of March, 968 in Karen\n\n§YRank§!: Major-General\n\n§YBiography§!: Fuz Stormshield is the textbook definition of an old warhorse (or, more precise, waryeti)—pragmatic, unshakable, and fiercely loyal to the chain of command. A veteran of the Storm King's campaigns, she earned her name leading offensive operations against enemy defenses, where her mastery of breaking the entrenchment and fortifications earned her the begrudging respect of both allies and enemies alike. While her tactics were not as glamorous as the Storm King's aggressive raids, her ability to successfully attack ensured supply lines remained intact even when others faltered.\n\nDespite her experience, Fuz has never been one for politics. Her lack of ambition beyond the battlefield has kept her in high regard within military circles but has left her out of touch with the country's shifting dynamics. While she is recognized for her value as a tactician, some within the administration question whether her mindset aligns with the kingdom’s future. For now, she remains one of its most seasoned commanders—a fierce sword pointed towards an uncertain world."

While many officers of her generation rose through the ranks by brute strength and unwavering loyalty, Boltsquall built her reputation on meticulous battlefield analysis and an obsession with military advancements. Her peers often dismissed her fixation on logistics and strategic adaptability, but those who served under her knew better—where she commanded, yetis survived, and enemies fell with mechanical precision.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Storm King’s demise, Boltsquall’s forward-thinking approach secured her a place within the restructured military. She remains a firm advocate for modernization, believing that superior tactics and technology, not just sheer might, will determine the kingdom’s future. Her superiors appreciate her efficiency, though some whisper that her methods are cold and detached, valuing victory over valor. Whatever the case, Boltsquall’s doctrine is clear: wars are won not by those who fight the hardest, but by those who fight the smartest."

Unlike many of his contemporaries who rose through the ranks by acts of personal valor, Nazruk built his reputation on the battlefield by keeping his forces together when others would break. A firm believer that cohesion wins wars, he has spent years refining training regimens and battlefield doctrines that prioritize unit resilience and unwavering organization, ensuring that his divisions stand firm no matter the odds.\n\nHis approach earned him a loyal following among yeti officers who admired his structured command, but it has also drawn criticism. Some see his methods as rigid, too focused on drilled precision rather than battlefield flexibility. Yet, when the civil war tore through the Stormlands, it was Nazruk’s soldiers who held the line while others collapsed in chaos. And now, he stands at the forefront of shaping an army that will not just charge into battle—but endure, regroup, and outlast any foe."

Despite his meteoric rise, Gerzha has repeatedly refused staff appointments and cushy headquarters positions, insisting that he belongs on the frontlines where the shells fall and decisions matter.\n\nHis critics call him undisciplined, even dangerous. His soldiers call him invincible. He’s the kind of general who personally patches holes in trench walls and still flies recon when no one else dares.

Plucked from the officer academy after only a year of training and vaulted straight into high command, Ezhi's appointment raised more than a few eyebrows among senior brass. Whispers of nepotism and favoritism swirl in the halls, but the truth is simpler: Ezhi showed potential, and someone high up decided to gamble.\n\nStill green and visibly unsure at times, Ezhi compensates with an almost painful level of diligence. Reports are read twice, orders checked three times, and every mistake is met with personal apology and a vow to do better. Though clearly out of their depth in some areas, Ezhi's determination and willingness to learn have earned quiet respect from the troops and suspicion from hardened veterans. Whether they’ll sink or swim remains to be seen—but no one can doubt that Ezhi is trying, and trying hard."

She was all-too-quick to give up her unit to the advancing armies and whether out of mercy or to mock her for the disgraceful surrender, she was allowed to return safely back to her village once it - and the rest of the small zebra state - fell under yeti rule.\n\nFor a time Zelitha lived the life of a pariah amongst her fellow zebras, seen as nothing but a coward. Unfortunately for them, this treatment only pushed her away and onward to prove her worth to their new yeti overlords. Using her skills in appealing to struggling zebras’ needs, she managed to assemble a group of likeminded collaborators who were eager to patch any holes the yetis had in their occupation in exchange for some special treatment.\n\nWhen Ibyz Icepaw arrived and turned an organised sacking into an actual occupation, she was quick to notice Zelitha’s efforts. Not one to waste such an asset, she added the mare to a collection of many others in her rapidly growing network within the Zwahile. Soon there was a veritable army of zebras who often helped the field marshal in one way or another, of which this mare was a small but particularly useful part.\n\nZelitha’s successes in life continued even after the end of the deluge which has only emboldened her loyalty to the seemingly insurmountable yeti overlords. She sees it as foolish to resist such a powerful race, a bitter pill she has long since swallowed; earnestly believing that collaboration will be the only way for her and her people to live well. Defiance is never rewarded under the stewardship of the yetis, after all.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: RyanBoi"

SLC_starting_arty_desc:0 "Born out of a forgotten fortress workshop tucked high in the Munmane Mountains, Shattersky has grown from a makeshift artillery forge into the directorate’s primary supplier of heavy munitions. Originally focused on maintaining captured Storm King-era cannons, the company quickly earned a name for itself with its rugged, no-nonsense designs that could be repaired with a hammer and a bit of gumption.\n\nThough far from elegant, Shattersky’s guns are dependable, loud, and terrifyingly effective. Their engineers—mostly veteran yetis with missing fingers and too many stories—pride themselves on building weapons that make the ground tremble. In a nation still defining its doctrine, Shattersky’s cannons ensure that when the country speaks, it does so with thunder."

Today, under new leadership and new loyalties, Zouala walks a tightrope between legacy and innovation.\n\nTheir rifles are known for being precise, durable, and deceptively simple to maintain—designed with both zebra and yeti users in mind.

Its crates are stamped with pragmatic precision, its workers trained to prioritize utility over flair.

The result wasn’t pretty—but it worked.\n\nBruntbolt tanks are fast, relatively cheap, and have just enough armor to survive a hit or two.

 knights_desc:0 "Since times immemorial, Griffon Knights have been the premiere heavy infantry/cavalry in the world. As times and technology change, Knights trade their lances and plate armour to heavy weapons and enchanted armour, allowing them to function as heavy shock units."
 knights_tech:0 "Knights Technology"
 tech_knights:0 "Knights Division I"
 tech_knights_desc:0 "Known around the world for their chivalry and bravery, the tradition of knighthood in griffon culture dates back to some of the earliest griffon societies. Using enchanted armour and weapons, these soldiers can square up even against some armoured vehicles."
 tech_knights2:0 "Knights Division II"
 tech_knights2_desc:0 "Through the use of improved training and equipment, we can strengthen our Knights divisions."
 tech_knights3:0 "Knights Division III"
 tech_knights3_desc:0 "With the further modernisation and improvement of our knights, we can ensure their prevalence on the battlefield will continue."
 tech_knights_a:0 "Knights Division IV"
 tech_knights_a_desc:0 "By improving the enchantments used for armour, our knights can survive and fight for longer on the battlefield."
 tech_knights_b:0 "Knights Division V"
 tech_knights_b_desc:0 "In order to keep our knights competitive, we need to ensure they have even stronger enchantments and weaponry."
 tech_knights_c:0 "Knights Division VI"
 tech_knights_c_desc:0 "By inviting some of the most powerful enchanters from across the world, we can make our knights into unstoppable fighters."
 tech_knights_magical:0 "Noble Recruits"
 tech_knights_magical_desc:0 "We must ensure that not only do we use the finest equipment for our knights, but also the finest soldiers - only those of noble blood deserve to be part of our elite knights."
 tech_knights_magical2:0 "Highest Standards"
 tech_knights_magical2_desc:0 "Nothing less than perfect is accepted in our army, and that extends to our training - by enforcing strict guidelines for conscription and training, our knights will be the envy of the world."
 tech_knights_regular:0 "Commoner Recruits"
 tech_knights_regular_desc:0 "We cannot afford to limit our recruiting to nobles. If we extend our drafts to commoners as well, while our quality might suffer our troops will have many more griffons to draw from."
 tech_knights_regular2:0 "Fighting Spirit"
 tech_knights_regular2_desc:0 "What commoners may lack in noble blood, they make up for in spirit. While nobles may not be used to physical hardship, the peasantry will fight tooth and nail for their country."
 tech_griffon_misc:0 "Enchanted Tools"
 tech_griffon_misc_desc:0 "While we may not have "proper" magic, as some other races might consider it, we do have a magic of our own. By encouraging the use of enchantments for work, we can make labour much easier and faster."
 tech_griffon_misc2:0 "Enchanted Machines"
 tech_griffon_misc2_desc:0 "Griffon enchanting must be modernised for the new era - and what is more modern than industry? Enchanted machinery can run much smoother and faster than conventional machines."
 tech_griffon_misc3:0 "Griffon Architecture"
 tech_griffon_misc3_desc:0 "Our architecture is famous for its incorporation of the landscapes, particularly mountains. We can take advantage of this to make repair much easier, and to fit more industry into tighter spaces."
 tech_griffon_misc_a:0 "Magical Early Warning Systems"
 tech_griffon_misc_a_desc:0 "Using enchantments, we can set up systems to warn of incoming attacks, helping save civilian lives and improve our efforts to understand the enemy."
 tech_griffon_misc_b:0 "Flexible Production"
 tech_griffon_misc_b_desc:0 "We cannot limit our factories to being too specialised, and risk the inability to provide something vital. With enchantments used to make conversion easier, we can make sure our factories are flexible as needed."
 tech_griffon_misc_c:0 "Unbreakable Materials"
 tech_griffon_misc_c_desc:0 "By mass-producing the strong, magical materials used for weapons in armour, we can make our army and air force much tougher to kill."
 tech_griffon_airnavy:0 "Machine Nests"
 tech_griffon_airnavy_desc:0 "The griffon practice of "nesting", despite being a natural phenomenon, can be learned from and adapted for use in the military - particularly the air force and navy. By encouraging the construction of strong "nests" for ships and planes, our aviators and sailors will always have a strong base to operate out of."
 tech_griffon_airnavy2:0 "Enchanted Hulls"
 tech_griffon_airnavy2_desc:0 "We can use enchantments on our planes and ships, making them just as tough as the armour on our soldiers."
 tech_griffon_navy3:0 "Seeker Munitions"
 tech_griffon_navy3_desc:0 "The idea of "Seeker Missiles" - enchanted missiles made to track their targets- has been gaining traction in the minds of a few of our naval officers. With widespread adoption of this technology, we can make hitting enemy ships much easier."

 tech_griffon_navy4_desc:0 "The act of capturing enemy convoys must be encouraged, if we are to keep strong blockades."

 tech_griffon_air4:0 "Modern Airships"
 tech_griffon_air4_desc:0 "Our bombers must be sturdy and strong, to survive campaigns into enemy territory."
 tech_griffon_air5:0 "Born to Fly"
 tech_griffon_air5_desc:0 "Many races see flying machines as an opportunity - a peculiar vehicle used to reach places they couldn't before. We see them as an extension of ourselves, and our pilots will be much more skilled as a consequence."
 tech_griffon_army:0 "We Can Fly?!"
 tech_griffon_army_desc:0 "Ever since the birth of griffonkind, one of our greatest gifts have been our wings, given by Eyr herself. Thus it is imperative that we know how to use them to our full advantage."
 tech_griffon_army_def2:0 "Messenger Enchantments"
 tech_griffon_army_def2_desc:0 "Many armies use radios to communicate. However, by integrating enchanted messaging into our companies, communication will be much easier and harder to intercept than radio."
 tech_griffon_army_def3:0 "Enchanted Armour"
 tech_griffon_army_def3_desc:0 "Griffon armour has been the envy of the world for many years, famously used for our knights. By employing this in all of our special forces, as well as improving the design, we will keep things this way."
 tech_griffon_army_def_a:0 "Hardened Tanks"
 tech_griffon_army_def_a_desc:0 "By enchanting tank armour much in the same way as we do conventional armour, we can make sure our tanks are sturdier than the competition."

 tech_griffon_army_atk3:0 "Tip of the Spear"
 tech_griffon_army_atk3_desc:0 "Utilising special forces and reconnaissance in high concentrations can make our assaults go much better."
 tech_griffon_army_atk_a:0 "Leap of Faith"
 tech_griffon_army_atk_a_desc:0 "Unlike the paratroopers of earthbound races, who may be fearful of falling to their doom, our paratroopers have wings. With this extra insurance, they are much more willing to follow commands."
 tech_griffon_army_atk_b:0 "Air Resupply"
 tech_griffon_army_atk_b_desc:0 "Through the use of flying couriers and the dropping of supplies from planes, our armies can stay out of the range of supply chains for longer."
 tech_griffon_army_atk_c:0 "Outrider Enchantments"
 tech_griffon_army_atk_c_desc:0 "Enchantments for motorised vehicles can improve both their speed and attack capability, making them a much fiercer foe."

HLR_START_second_year:0 "A Second Year of Preparation"
HLR_START_second_year_desc:0 "One year ago, Torygg announced his intentions to march eastwards and wipe out the darkness within the Dread Peninsula. We have spent the time since then preparing ourselves for war, some inside of the Order question if it is even possible to win a large-scale conflict when they had never managed to do so before. Hearing these concerns, Torygg decided to organize a meeting to address morale."

HLR_START_to_end_the_old_war_desc:0 "For a thousand years the Arcturian Order has battled against the forces of the Dread Peninsula. All that has taught us is that our traditional weapons are sorely in need of an upgrade, something that Torygg intends to address sooner rather than later."

arcturian_torygg.1.t:0 "Call To Action"
arcturian_torygg.1.d:0 "Murmurs could be heard throughout the Council as the senior knights, scribes, and magesmiths of the Arcturian Order filtered into the Council Chamber. Headmaster Torygg had not informed them that there would be such a large audience for this week's meeting.\n\nThey didn't have to wait long before Torygg himself arrived, clad in ceremonial armor that he hadn't worn in ages. The esteemed Headmaster of the Order stood at the front of the room and rested a claw on the podium beside him. All eyes were on him as they could tell that this meeting would be more important than usual.\n\n"My dearest friends," said the old griff in a solemn tone, "Today marks the eleventh anniversary of the Luvenite Incursion that devastated our lands, and it also marks the second year since we began preparations to avenge those that we have lost."\n\nTorygg paused, taking a moment to close his eyes and breathe deeply. When he opened them again, a righteous fervor seemed to have replaced his gentle demeanor. "Which is why we must greatly expand our efforts to mobilize for a grand crusade of our own, the likes of which has not been seen in over a thousand years. To this end, I am exercising my power as Headmaster to issue a decree: There will be one more year to prepare ourselves, another to begin marching into the Dread Lands, and before the end of the third year we will take their dark fortress at the peninsula's end and finally be victorious."\n\nHe drew his sword and raised it into the air. "For the fallen! For Arcturius!""
arcturian_torygg.1.a:0 "For Arcturius!"

arcturian_torygg.2.t:0 "Reforging the Banners"
arcturian_torygg.2.d:0 ""It is no secret that the sword has fallen out of favor in the rest of the world. You of all griffons should know this, Ostwald."\n\nOstwald Vind raised an eyebrow at Torygg, "You sincerely believe that we should strive to replace our swords with muskets? To move away from a thousand years of tradition?"\n\n"Let me tell you a story," Torygg began, retrieving a battered old musket from his desk, "Many years ago, I lived in a faraway kingdom known as the Griffonian Empire. There was a revolution of sorts, and we had to take up arms against our brothers and sisters who had tried to storm the palace."\n\nTorygg eyed the rifle, wiping away some of the dust on it. "I didn't have a firearm. None of us did, the revolutionaries had seized almost all of them the day before. We were issued shortswords and told to defend the emperor with our lives." He paused, then looked directly into Ostwald's eyes. "I watched as my brothers and sisters were struck down from afar as they tried in vain to charge towards the enemy. I was lucky to have found a working musket off of a corpse nearby. And because of that musket, I was able to survive that day."\n\nOstwald stood silently for a moment, then nodded. "It will be very difficult to replace every sword with a gun, you know. But you've convinced me how effective they can be.""
arcturian_torygg.2.a:0 "Now comes the hard part: Manufacturing them."

arcturian_torygg.3.t:0 "Modernization Program"
arcturian_torygg.3.d:0 ""Headmaster, if you've a moment, I'd like to run over a few things with you."\n\nTorygg looked up from his desk to see Hans Becker, a senior architect within the Order. He greeted him with a tired smile. "Yes, of course. What is it?"\n\n"It's about the modernization program that you proposed. A lot of the changes that you wanted to make are just... difficult to implement, but I think I may have found a way to get us started, at least."\n\nThere was a moment of silence. "Well?" said Torygg with a slow gesture, "Go on."\n\nHans appeared hesitant. He took a deep breath, then continued. "You remember the siege of Griffenheim in 978? The one we both fought in?"\n\n"Just because we once fought on opposing sides doesn't mean that I hold any ill will to you, Hans. Out with it."\n\n"Well, I had followed the Republicans into Cloudbury afterwards. In the years since then, the Griffonian Republic had managed to turn a primitive, mostly rural society into one that was, though admittedly not very stable, much more modern than it used to be. I recall some of the methods they had used, and I had some ideas on how to adapt them to our lands.""
arcturian_torygg.3.a:0 ""I sense that it won't be that simple, but I trust your judgement, Hans.""

arcturian_torygg.4.t:0 "Inspection of the Guard"
arcturian_torygg.4.d:0 "Though it had been many years since he had drilled the recruits, Torygg still took great pride in watching the newly knighted griffons practice their formations. Being Headmaster meant that he was often swamped with clan politics and paperwork nowadays. Though he enjoyed his chats with the clan leaders, occasionally he wished that he had the time to teach the knights himself.\n\nThe 17th Stromhoof Regiment took to the air in waves, their armor seeming to have no impact on their speed. They spread out and drew their swords, then began to dive towards several dummy targets in unison. As each knight landed a blow, they retreated to begin another diving manuever.\n\nAs Torygg observed them practice, he couldn't help but notice something: The knights struck the targets with reckless abandon, as if their targets wouldn't ever try to hit them back. Additionally, their retreats became sluggish over time as they continuously landed and took off in quick succession. Torygg asked the drill instructor about this particular tactic, to which she replied that it had been taught for nearly a century. When asked about how ponies could perform the manuever, she shrugged and said that it wasn't designed with ponies in mind.\n\nTorygg nodded, then excused himself. It would seem that several tactics and traditions had become so ingrained in the Arcturian Order that they had begun to show their flaws.\n\nThe next day, Torygg sent out a missive to his three trusted subordinates about his newfound concerns. The Order needed to change its strategies and how it handled its pony minorities. The question was, how?"
arcturian_torygg.4.a:0 "And will there even be enough time to make such drastic changes?"

arcturian_torygg.401.t:0 "A Vanguard"
arcturian_torygg.401.d:0 "#TODO Some officer talking to new recruits about the fact that they shall represent a new beginning for the Order's doctrine or smth. Maybe ends with some Pegasi doing something cool ?"
arcturian_torygg.401.a:0 ""

arcturian_torygg.402.t:0 "You Can Be A Knight Too!"
arcturian_torygg.402.d:0 ""Are you sure that this isn't going to weigh me down too much? All this armor feels really cumbersome."\n\nQuick Step shuffled uncomfortably as the senior griffon knight finished tightening straps which secured the armor plates onto the worried pegasus. "Don't worry. They take a bit of getting used to, but once you break them in, you'll never want to fight without it."\n\n"But I'm not even a knight! I'm just a member of my village's militia. Shouldn't you be giving this to somepony who actually went through your fancy training?"\n\nThe griffon rested his claw on Quick Step's back to reassure him. "For too long we have treated the ponies in this land as an afterthought, not bothering to find more ways to incorporate them into our Knightly Order. This armor is the first of many changes to come, along with alterations to The Code to better include the local auxiliaries and militias in our ways. Fancy training can come later. Now, why don't you try a simple take off and landing?"\n\n"All right, but if I crash then I'm throwing this helmet at you." Quick Step extended his wings and leaped into the air, flying around in a circle with relative ease. He was surprised at just how flexible the armor actually was. "Wow! I thought that this armor would make flying more difficult, but I can barely notice a difference!"\n\nWith a laugh, the griffon exclaimed, "The Magesmiths work wonders with their enchantments! Now go, tell your friends in your militia that they too can become knights!""
arcturian_torygg.402.a:0 ""Wait, I'm a knight now?""

arcturian_torygg.403.t:0 "All Can Fight"
arcturian_torygg.403.d:0 ""And remember, if you have faith in Arcturius you will be able to defeat any foe and overcome any trial, no matter how great!"\n\nThe knights watched the young colts and filles strike the wooden figures with blunt swords. Over the past few days they'd been going from village to village to preach about their faith, though some of the locals had expressed their distaste for the Order's recent attempts to "indoctrinate" the youth. Still, none could deny the results: The Order's recruitment offices were struggling to keep up with the large number of ponies who wished to aid the cause.\n\nAs the knights were preparing to leave the village, a young filly approached them with a worried expression on her face. "Hello, um... my mom says that Ark-tor-us only helps griffons. Is that true?"\n\nAmong the knights, one of them moved forward towards the filly. The knight took off her helmet, revealing her to be a pegasus mare, much to the surprise of the filly. She smiled reassuredly, "Arcturius protects the faithful, no matter what form they take.""
arcturian_torygg.403.a:0 "Having faith is but the first step."

arcturian_torygg.404.t:0 "404"
arcturian_torygg.404.d:0 "#TODO to be determined, but it's something about training being done in semi secrecy. Maybe in some valley near Pilgrim's Path ?"

arcturian_torygg.405.d:0 "#TODO The Banners are having a competition in a field near the Tar Pine Rock, nobles and peasants alike are seeing it happen. Maybe a suggestion that some dark figure is watching it all unfold ?"
arcturian_torygg.405.a:0 ""

arcturian_torygg.5.t:0 "Faith and the Fallen"
arcturian_torygg.5.d:0 "Torygg sat down next to an old birch tree in the stronghold's courtyard, feeling immense relief as he had finally managed to secure a few hours to himself. All of the recent speeches had begun to take a toll on the old griff. Torygg unbuckled his breastplate and removed his helmet, leaving them by the tree. Perhaps a visit to the Luvenite Memorial would help ease his mind.\n\nThe walk to the memorial grounds was quiet and uneventful, which was a blessing in and of itself. The stone road, though cracked and imperfect, reminded him of himself and the Order in a way. Everyone has their faults, but as long as they strive to fulfill their purpose, many shortcomings can be forgiven.\n\nThe memorial itself was as equally silent as he remembered. A few griffons here, a few ponies there, most were paying respects to the departed. A few were deep in prayer at the central statue emblazoned with the Sword of Arcturius. Curiously, all of those in prayer were ponies.\n\nTorygg never fully understood why the ponies of this land were such devoted worshippers of his gods. He'd long since given up trying to convince any of them that Arcturius, Boreas, and Eyr were actually just griffon gods. Perhaps it was better this way; the faith that the Order offered seemed to support them just fine in these trying times.\n\nSoon he stopped in front of a gravestone, one separated from the rest of the memorial. Here, the previous Headmaster of the Arcturian Order was laid to rest. It was unusual, as they had almost completely stopped burying their dead due to the wicked necromancers in the Dread Lands. But for this griffon... Torygg had wanted something traditional. He withdrew a pin from his tunic, one decorated with a simple shield of hope, then set it down next to the grave."
arcturian_torygg.5.a:0 "The time for shields has passed."

HLR_shield_of_hope_event_tt:0 "§YFor a shield is useless if it cannot save those that you have sworn to protect.§!"

arcturian_torygg.501.a:0 ""

arcturian_torygg.502.t:0 "To Seek Vengeance"
arcturian_torygg.502.d:0 "War preparations were in full swing in Fortress Boreas. All around the keep, knights of every caliber were moving materials, building tools, and taking stock of equipment. Above them, a young, female pegasus named Elfreda oversaw their actions from a balcony. Technically she should have been down there with them, as she was merely a knight-lieutenant, but she could sense that some of those below her weren't fully invested in the preparations.\n\nShe thought back to that terrible battle in her hometown eleven years ago where she had been rescued as a filly by Torygg's forces. Ostwald had pulled her from the dying embrace of her mother and slew dozens of undead to bring her to safety. She shuddered at the memory. Darkness had nearly swallowed her then.\n\nShe wouldn't allow such terrible things to ever happen again.\n\n"Brothers and sisters!" she suddenly shouted, "What do you fight for! Why are you here?!" Her commanding voice had an immediate effect: most of the others had stopped working to look at the pegasus standing over the balcony. An ember began to burn inside of her. "The answer is clear: To make the monsters of the Dread Lands pay! The deaths of our loved ones are not something to be met with half-heartedness, but with fury! Our righteous wrath will cleanse our souls and burn every last vile abomination that faces us to ash! When we go beyond the safety of our walls, we will do so with the light of Arcturius shining through us! A light that can never be snuffed out!"\n\nShe raised her wings and ascended into the air, her heart filled with fiery reverence, "Arcturius watches over each of us! He will protect us, so long as we are faithful! We must always keep this knowledge with us, for it will grant us the strength to destroy the enemy!"\n\nDespite the suddenness of her speech, it seemed to have a profound effect on all who heard it. The knights redoubled their efforts and even began to chide those who weren't working hard enough."
arcturian_torygg.502.a:0 "Arcturius Protects..."

arcturian_torygg.6.t:0 "A Cleanup in Pondwatch"
arcturian_torygg.6.d:0 "Mathiaus Clawthorn flipped through the parchments detailing the monthly reports of the strongholds, towns, and outposts that comprised the Arcturian Order. Most of the time, these reports weren't that interesting to read. Recruitment numbers, births and deaths, disputes between the pony clans, and so on. They'd started trying to keep track of everything ever since the Luvenite Incursion in 996 had nearly wiped them out.\n\nHe was ready to file away the parchments when something caught his eye. A report from the local garrison in Pondwatch. He picked it up and examined it: A vampire cell had been detected and neutralized, but the knights stationed there had suffered several casualties.\n\nMathiaus frowned. This was troubling. Vampire attacks had become more and more problematic lately, especially after Torygg had made his big speech about invading the Dread Lands.\n\nThough he was a priest first and a scribe second, Mathiaus knew that the Order could not rely on faith alone to halt these attacks. He would need to consult the Headmaster on what to do."
arcturian_torygg.6.a:0 "These cells are getting uncomfortably close to the capital..."

arcturian_torygg.601.t:0 "Tackling the Vampiric Threat"
arcturian_torygg.601.d:0 ""This is getting out of control," said Torygg as he pointed towards the map of the Arcturian Territories. He had summoned his most trusted Knight-Commanders, Ostwald Vind and William Steelbeak for an emergency meeting. They looked at the central table, where multiple red pins were inserted around places where vampire cells had been found. Torygg pushed another pin into the map. "We've been receiving more and more reports about vampire attacks all over our territories, and now they have started to appear in Pondwatch. That's less than two days' travel from here. Before we know it, they'll be here in Fortress Boreas." Torygg paused, looking straight into his subordinates' eyes. "What I need from you two are ideas on how to deal with this threat before it gets any worse."\n\nOstwald leaned forward in his chair, deep in thought. "Perhaps a separate branch inside of the Order could be established," he suggested, "One wholly dedicated to investigating these vampire cells. They'll seek to understand their methods and patterns, then counter them before they strike again."\n\nWilliam shook his head. "That could work Ostwald, but by the time this branch of yours learns enough about the patterns of these vampires, it'll probably be too late. What we need are professionals... and before you stop me, hear me out. The Hunters of Elias have been honing their skills for centuries. They've never once bothered us, and have even tipped us off to certain attacks in the past. We should consult them on how to deal with these vampires."\n\nOstwald stood, preparing to scold William for even suggesting such an idea, when there was a knock at the door. "Come in!" yelled Torygg.\n\n"Uhm, sorry for interrupting," said a young pegasus as she opened the door, "I just couldn't help but overhear your conversation, and..."\n\n"Ah, Lieutenant Elfreda! Don't worry, your voice is always welcome here," reassured Torygg, "If you have an idea, then go ahead! Let's hear it."\n\nElfreda cleared her throat. "Well, our garrisons are just token forces, not used to the degree of infiltration we're dealing with now. We should give our primary battalions additional responsibilities. Make dealing with vampires in hiding a part of their training, so that when the time comes to actually invade the peninsula, they'll have the knowledge they need to deal with those blasphemous monsters."\n\nTorygg nodded as she finished speaking. "I see. These are fine suggestions, but I'll need some time to think about them. Thank you all for your input.""

arcturian_torygg.602.d:0 ""Listen closely, and listen well. What you are about to become a part of is not something that should be taken lightly."\n\nKnight-Commander Ostwald Vind walked down between the knights he had personally selected as candidates. He had spent the better part of a week deciding on who would be here today, and judging by how they were all silently standing at attention, he had chosen well.\n\n"You will be separate from the rest of the Arcturian Order. The Code that you have sworn to uphold will no longer be your sole guiding principle. Your current rank will be meaningless, and you will likely earn the ire of the other knights as well." Ostwald stopped at the end of the room, facing away from all of the candidates. "If this is too much to ask of you, then you may leave this room. I will not stop you, and you will be able to return to your previous duties as if this meeting had never occurred."\n\nOstwald listened closely but heard no movement behind him. He let himself smile a little. "Very well." He turned around, then began to walk back towards the front of the room. "From this day forward, you will no longer be known as a Knight. You will not answer any calls or summons for knights. Instead, you will serve as an internal security force that has the sole purpose of finding and eliminating vampires inside of our realm. Your first and most important priority will be to protect this land from the threats hiding within it."\n\nOstwald stopped at the front of the room, then turned around again to look at those whose lives he was about to change forever. He raised his claw to his chest in a salute to them."

arcturian_torygg.603.d:0 "It was early in the evening when Torygg and his company arrived at the lake. There they could see a small contingent of shadowy individuals cloaked in black garbs waiting by the lakeside. Torygg had several reservations about arranging this meeting, but in the end he believed William's counsel was the best way to deal with the infestation that they suffered from.\n\nThough Torygg's personal guards took care to tread quietly, the Hunters seemed to notice them from afar, turning to face them. The tension in the air was overwhelming; almost every knight within the Order knew what these creatures were, what they stood for. How they willingly allowed Vampires to exist within their ranks. Torygg gathered himself, then addressed the Hunters, "I am pleased to see that you answered my summons. Is there one among you that can speak for you?"\n\nA tall, spindly griffon among the group stepped forward, bearing a mask that covered his entire face. "I am Tobran, senior among those you see here," he bowed, "Elias extends a greeting as well, though he regrets not being able to be here himself. It was his wish that we make this journey."\n\n"So Elias still lives?" Torygg murmured to himself. Something to investigate later. He stepped towards Tobran and offered a claw, "And what a journey it must have been. You must tell me about it later, though first we should deal with the matter at claw. I suspect that you know about our-"\n\n"Your Newborn problem. Yes, we are quite aware. That is why you summoned us, is it not?"\n\nTorygg retracted his claw, retaining his composure. "It is. We are in dire need of assistance. Our knights aren't trained to deal with local infestations of this magnitude. I humbly ask that you help us, and in return we-"\n\n"There is no need to make us offers, Headmaster." interrupted Tobran, "The Hunt itself is reward enough. We will purge these Newborns for you along with those responsible for their creation. You and your knights would do well to learn from our methods."\n\n"You have my thanks," Torygg nodded, then briefly glanced back at his personal guards, "If I may ask, would you be able to keep word of your involvement in this to a minimum? There are those within the Order who aren't so... willing to speak with you.""

I will not lie to you, I am beginning to have second thoughts about it."\n\n"Don't worry Headmaster, this is a necessary step for our cooperation with the Hunters. We need to make the knights feel as if we're actually taking measures to stop the vampire threat."\n\nTorygg looked down at one of the many patrols passing through. Despite their increased numbers, the knights looked scared, as if they expected to be attacked at any moment. He turned back to face William, "I do not like the idea of misleading them, it goes against the Code. And what if they have a misunderstanding with the Hunters and slay one of them? This whole plan is hung by a string and the slightest mistake could snap it!"\n\nWilliam didn't seem to be affected the Headmaster's concerns. "Our top priority currently is to mitigate the vampire infestation. That means we need experts within our ranks to help deal with them discreetly. Once the threat has been mitigated enough, we can ease the knights into the idea of working with the Hunters. Perhaps then we can put this long feud between us and them to rest."\n\n"It's still too risky for my liking, but we're committed now.

Ever since Father Elias had made that blasted agreement with Torygg, he'd become drastically more demanding of his Hunters. Of these demands was a recent summons for several important missions, with the stipulation that mortal Hunters were required for the tasks ahead.\n\nHauke cursed himself for volunteering without giving it any thought. If he'd known that he was going to be protecting the Arcturian Knights from rogue vampires then he would have simply shadowed one from afar, not... whatever this undercover nonsense was.\n\nThe thought crossed his mind that Torygg must have approved of this, since Hauke and several other Hunters had been discreetly granted entry into the Order's strongholds, along with garments to hide their true affiliation. What was Torygg's game here? He didn't know. Perhaps-\n\nThere was a bang at the door. "Hauke, are you done in there? I really have to go!"\n\nHauke grumbled to himself as he put his helmet back on. Really, how did the knights ever see or hear anything with these clunky metal tins covering their heads? "Yes, yes, I'll be out in a moment.""

Many innocent lives would be ended by then.\n\nThe Hunters stopped in front of a distraught-looking house as Greth, the most senior among them, held up a claw to his companions. He briefly raised his mask to sniff the air, then nodded. "The Newborn is here. I shall act as bait, take up positions to cover me." Immediately the others dispersed to obtain vantage points and flanking positions.\n\nGreth composed himself and knocked at the door. "Hello? I apologize for the intrusion, but I am quite weary, may I rest here for the night?"\n\nAfter a few moments of silence, the door opened, revealing a trembling stallion trying to cover his face. Fangs were clearly visible despite his efforts. "S-Sorry, I-I cannot let you-"\n\nThe stallion's words were halted by a sudden flurry of throwing knives, crossbow bolts, and gunshots all striking his vital areas, causing him to unceremoniously collapse to the ground. Greth stood still as his companions emerged from the shadows, each brandishing a variety of weapons. He gazed down at the stallion's lifeless, crimson eyes, then pushed the door fully open. Inside were nearly a dozen bodies drained of blood scattered around the living room. He removed his mask, revealing similar crimson eyes to the now-dead stallion in front of him."

#Old Man Torygg fucking dies part 1
arcturian_toryggdeath.1.t:0 "Early To Rise"
arcturian_toryggdeath.1.d:0 "With a heavy groan, Torygg Brightclaw lifted himself from his bed. Despite being relatively fit for his age, the role of Headmaster had finally begun to take its toll on Torygg’s body. Gone were the days where he bested most other knights in terms of strength and agility. Although he loathed to admit it, Torygg believed that soon he might not be able to lead any more expeditions into the Dread Peninsula.\n\nStill, for the time being he could manage himself. He had to set an example for the young trainees, after all. Torygg glanced out of the window, seeing that the sun had yet to rise. He’d arisen a bit earlier than usual, but soon the rest of Fortress Boreas would awaken and begin their routines. The rugged Headmaster dressed himself in his usual garb, a soft grey and gold tunic with a rusted medal attached to it. He glanced at it briefly, reminiscing on the brief time he’d served in the Royal Army of Griffenheim, long before he’d made the pilgrimage to join the fabled Knights of the Arcturian Order. It seemed like a lifetime ago.\n\nTorygg allowed himself a moment’s respite before he began his day. He’d been trying to organize the workforce of the Order to begin constructing a basic road to the Whitetail Mountains in the south, but progress had been slow. Logistics was a surprisingly difficult thing for an old military griff to manage, so he’d enlisted the help of Julius Veck, one of the brightest minds within the Order.\n\nSpeaking of... Torygg opened the door and left his quarters. He had needed to discuss some additional details with Julius, so he made his way to the younger griffon’s room, which was tucked away in a corner far across the fortress.\n\nAs he reached the room, Torygg could have sworn that he heard a female voice behind the door. He chuckled slightly, letting his imagination play guessing games. It was still early in the morning, and he didn’t want to walk in on Julius while he was busy with somegriff… or somepony. “I’ll just come back later,” mused Torygg to himself. He was about to leave when he heard Julius say something alarming.\n\n“...they suspect nothing, Master. I will personally see to it that…”\n\nTorygg’s blood ran cold. Was Julius compromised? Was he enthralled? Torygg turned back, gripped the door handle, then shoved it open. Before him stood the young Julius and a sultry, well-dressed unicorn. Their heads flicked towards Torygg, and there was a brief silence. Alarm bells began ringing in Torygg’s head as he noticed the mare’s crimson irises."

arcturian_toryggdeath.2.t:0 "Early Demise"
arcturian_toryggdeath.2.d:0 "Thoughts raced through Torygg’s mind as he established the scene in front of him. Julius was enthralled by a vampire. The vampire in question was inside Fortress Boreas. That meant that it was possible that other knights, possibly even council members within the Order were thralls serving unholy masters. Their sanctuary was no longer safe. He’d been dealing with thralls in low-level positions for ages, but to see one holding a notable rank within the Order… this was bad. Very bad.\n\nTorygg instinctively reached towards his scabbard, then realized that he’d neglected to put it on since he had only expected a casual conversation. He could tell that they both knew this, too. The mare smiled, revealing a set of fangs that glistened in the candlelight. Julius simply stared at him with a blank expression.\n\nThe vampire took a step forward. She spoke with a tender voice, “Stay a while, won’t you?”\n\n“If it’s all the same, I’d rather not.” Torygg really didn’t want to give them an opportunity to escape, but he was ill-equipped to fight them. He methodically reached for the door, preparing to slam it behind him once he actually fled.\n\nWithout taking her eyes off of him, the vampire spoke again, but her voice carried an unnerving tone, as if it were layered over itself multiple times. “Don’t let him escape.”\n\nJulius immediately charged towards Torygg, but was met with solid wood as Torygg quickly stepped back and positioned himself behind the partially-opened door. Torygg then tried to fully close it to buy him some time, but the younger griffon’s claw gripped the bottom rail with an unnatural strength. Torygg grunted as he pulled with all his might, but the enthralled griffon had evidently received some of his master’s vitality. He decided to abandon this strategy and simply flee while calling for help.\n\n“ALARM! ALARM!” shouted Torygg as he ran away from the room. He heard the wood burst into splinters behind him, and before he could turn to see how close his pursuer was, it was too late. Two claws gripped Torygg’s hind legs and he fell to the ground, knocking the wind out of him. Those claws then wrapped themselves around Torygg’s neck and began to choke him from behind. He grabbed the claws and tried to pry them away, but to no avail. His vision began to blur, and as soon as his strength began to waver, Julius shifted his grip from the neck up to Torygg’s head. There was a twist, causing a sickening crack to echo throughout the hall.\n\nThe elder griffon unceremoniously collapsed to the ground. Torygg Brightclaw, Headmaster of the Arcturian Order, had died."

By the claw of one of our own? Soon after hearing a call for alarm, guards had found a griffon standing overtop Torygg’s body with an empty look in his eyes. They had apprehended and vigorously questioned him. Soon they determined that the young griffon had not been acting of his free will, and was forced to do it by one of the most despicable creatures to inhabit the cursed Dread Peninsula: a vampire.\n\nA vampire was responsible for Torygg’s death. To make matters worse, it could still be loose inside of the castle. Every able-bodied knight was summoned, even some who were retired or still in training. Within the hour, the entire fortress and its surrounding areas were being torn apart as they looked for wherever the creature might be hiding.\n\nThe Grand Council stood by their chairs in the war room as patrols passed by them. There was a grim atmosphere as they confirmed what little information they knew. Their Headmaster was dead, and the creature responsible was nowhere to be found.\n\n"We should hold a funeral, at the very least," said their youngest member, a griffon by the name of William Steelbeak, "We should be glad they didn’t make off with his body."\n\nA senior member of the council, Østwald Vind, shook his head at this suggestion, "We should not be glad at all, William. What we previously thought to be an impenetrable stronghold has proven to no longer be the case. Our lax security within this fortress has led to the death of our beloved Headmaster.

POLITICS_TORYGG_DESC:0 "§YBorn:§! 951 ALB, Crona, Griffonian Empire\n\n§YBiography:§! Born to humble smiths in the inner city, Torygg spent the early years of his life enamoured by stories of the gods who watched over Griffonkind. At the age of 14 he began to make daily trips to pray at the local temples of Boreas, Arcturius, and Eyr. His devotion to the gods became tested in the year 979, when he found himself taking up arms against his fellow griffons who had taken the seat of Griffenheim away from the young Grover V, who in Torygg's eyes was the chosen of Boreas. He would like to say that he had played a critical role in restoring the rightful ruler of Griffenheim to the throne, but inside he knew that he had sinned... even though the republicans he slew had denounced the Grovers, they were still his former friends and neighbors. Torygg saw himself no longer worthy in the eyes of Boreas or Eyr, so he turned his faith towards Arcturius. In 982, he heard rumors of a legendary lost detachment of Arcturian Knights in the far north, and so he made the journey beyond the Whitetail Mountains to find them. There he became acquainted with the Knights of the Arcturian Order.\n\nThough Torygg was not a traditional knight by the Order's definition, he had quickly proven his worth by his knowledge of strategy and tactics that he'd learned in the Herzland. Rising to the rank of Knight Captain by 985, his troops became among the most skilled and respected in the Order. His greatest challenge came in 996, when a sudden incursion from the Dread Peninsula overwhelmed the knights defending The Passage. The entire region was nearly overrun by the time Torygg's forces had arrived. Rushing quickly to join the massive battle at Fortress Arcturius, Torygg had shown up just in time to watch the previous Headmaster of the Order be decapitated by a fearsome lich. Seeing such a horrifying sight had filled the Knight Captain with a righteous fury, and so he drew his old Griffonian Musket and shot the monster's skull, severely disorienting it. With a roar, Torygg charged the lich, forcing his way through the horde of undead and piercing the creature with the bayonet of his gun, which he had dipped in blessed Holy Water. Instantly the creature and its legions fell, and Torygg stood victorious at the painful cost of The Passage and his Headmaster's life.\n\nSince then, Torygg had risen to a legendary status within the Order, soon earning the title of Headmaster himself. He has pushed for changes in the Order's arsenal, but understands that they simply lack the infrastructure to support supplying every knight with a gun. Because of this, he has updated their training regimen to prioritize living to see another day, rather than dying heroically... like his predecessor did.\n\n§YPortrait By:§! Neither"

POLITICS_WILLIAM_DESC:0 "§YBorn§!: 7 March 972, Tar Pine Rock\n\n§YBiography§!: Knight-Captain William Steelbeak wasn't always a shining example of an Arcturian Knight. Many years ago, he was a scrappy troublemaker who constantly left his parents' home to go adventuring with friends, often returning with cuts and bruises that he shrugged off as easily as he ignored his father's stern scoldings.\n\nOne day, his antics went too far: his father was in another town for business and had given him strict instructions to attend to his ill mother. Instead of being responsible, William left the home as he had often done so before, assuming that everything would be fine. When he returned the next week, his father stood up next to a freshly-dug grave and gave his son the beating of his life, then disowned him on the spot.\n\nThe experience shook William to such a degree that he vowed never to abandon those in need ever again, no matter what. To that end, he joined the Knightly Order of Arcturius, becoming the star pupil of Headmaster Torygg. He never slacked off and always went the extra mile to ensure that each of his fellow knights lived to see another day.\n\nWhile William does not adhere to the Code as strictly as others, the example he continues to set has inspired many other knights to behave just as he does: with humility, kindness, and determination to do the right thing.\n\n§YPortrait By§!: Neither"

He was an outlier among many ponies, seeking out a life of adventure and purpose beyond the towns. From time to time he'd overhear stories and rumors about holy figures to the north battling against the undead. Once he came of age he equipped himself with what he could before setting off to seek these individuals out.\n\nHe traveled far enough north to find that at least half the rumors were true, there were undead roaming throughout the winter wasteland. Alone in the wilderness he fought off the undead by turning the forest into a labyrinth of booby traps and fortifications. Enough reports of the occasional commotion gained enough attention to warrant an investigation by the local garrison. A small patrol led by the garrison's leader, Skyflight Cloudtail, set out to see what the trouble was. Platinum was unable to prevent them from falling victim to the indiscriminate traps, but fortunately only one griffon had been severely injured. Platinum reached the group and after a tense situation managed to convince Skyflight to let him lead his group back out of the trapped area.\n\nOnce guided out of the forest Platinum allowed himself to be arrested and brought in for interrogation. He explained his story of seeking out the Order in hopes of finding a higher purpose in life and that he never intended for anyone to get hurt. Skyflight knew that if he turned Platinum away he may just end up off the leash and it would be a waste of such potential talent if he were to have him locked away in a cell.\n\nPlatinum was given an offer to repay what he did by enlisting among his soldiers and serving the Order to which was accepted jubilantly. Starting from the bottom he worked his way up the ranks with each passing year, developing an unorthodox method of warfare by using guerrilla tactics to slowly whittle down the enemy's strength and break their morale. To show homage to the man who gave him the opportunity he had been looking for he adopted the last name of Cloudtail as his own."

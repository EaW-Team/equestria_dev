 ###Ugabi unites the great lakes
 great_lakes.2.t:0 "Mukisa Unifies the Great Lakes"
 great_lakes.2.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]After the Storm King brought the Imperial Mazwi to its knees, the Zebrican region of the Great Lakes was plunged into anarchy. Tribal kings and local warlords clashed with one another as they struggled for power. In the end, only one ruler stood triumphant over all others, and has proclaimed a new nation to unite the Great Lakes once more.\n\nMukisa Karamela, the Nnabakyala of Ugabi, now stands as the master of the Great Lakes. A staunch absolutist of the highest order, Mukisa is considered semi-divine by her subjects. Where Mazwi was weak and impotent, she has shown her intent to bring peace and unity through faith, order and an iron hoof as clearly as anyone could."
 great_lakes.2.a:0 "God Bless the Nnabakyala!"
 great_lakes.2.b:0 "Old Tradition Has Won."

 great_lakes.10.t:0 "Zar-Hay Conquers the Great Lakes"
 great_lakes.10.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]After the Storm King brought the Imperial Mazwi to its knees, the Zebrican region of the Great Lakes was plunged into anarchy. Tribal kings and local warlords clashed with one another as they struggled for power. In the end, only one ruler stood triumphant over all others, and has proclaimed a new nation to unite the Great Lakes once more.\nThe ruler in question is Zonni Zolon, the regent of the Kingdom of Zar-Hay known for his brutal treatment of enemies. Many cities burned and many kings were slain as his army crushed all who stood in his way. Now he has crowned himself as Zuwa, Emperor, and established Imperial Zar-Hay as the successor of Mazwi. A reign of terror is to be expected, but perhaps only a strong ruler can bring order and unity to the region."
 great_lakes.10.a:0 "Dark clouds loom over the Great Lakes."

 great_lakes.11.t:0 "Republican Victory in the Great Lakes"
 great_lakes.11.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]After the Storm King brought the Imperial Mazwi to its knees, the Zebrican region of the Great Lakes was plunged into anarchy. Tribal kings and local warlords clashed with one another as they struggled for power. In the end, only one ruler stood triumphant over all others, and has proclaimed a new nation to unite the Great Lakes once more.\n[ZWA.GetLeader] has formed a regional republican government that will establish a political system of liberal democracy. Outside observers remain doubtful, however, as [ZWA.GetLeader]'s authoritarian tendencies mean the newborn republic is in practice a dictatorship. Now that the fighting is over, there is a chance that proper reforms will be introduced."
 great_lakes.11.a:0 "Yet another stronghold of republicanism?"

 great_lakes.12.t:0 "The Prophet's Triumph"
 great_lakes.12.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]After the Storm King brought the Imperial Mazwi to its knees, the Zebrican region of the Great Lakes was plunged into anarchy. Tribal kings and local warlords clashed with one another as they struggled for power. In the end, only one ruler stood triumphant over all others, and has proclaimed a new nation to unite the Great Lakes once more.\nThrough fire and sword, [MSH.GetLeader] and his fanatical followers have spread their new, dogmatic faith across the region. The theocratic nation has vowed to unify the disparate tribes through the power of organized religion. Heretics are discriminated against and heathens viewed with pure contempt. It remains to be seen if the zealots wish to continue their campaigns further beyond."
 great_lakes.12.a:0 "Perhaps only faith can bring unity to them."

 great_lakes.13.t:0 "Liberation of the Great Lakes"
 great_lakes.13.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]After the Storm King brought the Imperial Mazwi to its knees, the Zebrican region of the Great Lakes was plunged into anarchy. Tribal kings and local warlords clashed with one another as they struggled for power. In the end, only one ruler stood triumphant over all others, and has proclaimed a new nation to unite the Great Lakes once more.\nMany years ago, [HAY.GetLeader] swore an oath to liberate as many slaves as she could. She gathered a large following and waged wars against neighbouring slaver states. Now that all of the Great Lakes have been liberated, she has founded a federation of states under her benevolent rule. Yet she might refuse to rest as long as there are any slaves still yearning for freedom."
 great_lakes.13.a:0 "The breaker of chains still has chains to break..."

 great_lakes.14.t:0 "The Slaver-Kingdom Rises"
 great_lakes.14.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]After the Storm King brought the Imperial Mazwi to its knees, the Zebrican region of the Great Lakes was plunged into anarchy. Tribal kings and local warlords clashed with one another as they struggled for power. In the end, only one ruler stood triumphant over all others, and has proclaimed a new nation to unite the Great Lakes once more.\nGelon-Zornu, the Eternal Kingdom, has crushed its enemies and now controls all of the former lands of the Mazwian empire. Countless enemies have been enslaved and are now sold at a steep discount in the bustling slave markets of Zornu. The future seems bleak for the region as the Mazwians have been replaced by an even worse oppressor."
 great_lakes.14.a:0 "Seems slavery is here to stay."

 great_lakes.15.t:0 "The Golden Empire Resurgent"
 great_lakes.15.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]After the Storm King brought the Imperial Mazwi to its knees, the Zebrican region of the Great Lakes was plunged into anarchy. Tribal kings and local warlords clashed with one another as they struggled for power. In the end, only one ruler stood triumphant over all others, and has proclaimed a new nation to unite the Great Lakes once more.\nWith complete disintegration of its army, it was clear to all that Mazwi could not reassert its dominance over its former dominion. But miraculously, that is exactly what happened. Against all odds, the Mazwians have triumphed and taken back all that was once theirs. Fate has given the Manza of Ziani a second chance. It remains to be seen if he will squander it."
 great_lakes.15.a:0 "Both on Griffonia and Zebrica, old empires refuse to die."

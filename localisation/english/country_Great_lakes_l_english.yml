great_lakes.1.t:0 "Buckure Gold Mines Depleted"
great_lakes.1.d:0 "Production of gold in the Buckure mines had been steadily reducing year by year, but at least the miners kept finding new deposits underground. This year, however, there's been no such luck. Any new veins of native gold discovered are not economically worthwhile to mine, as the content of gold in the ore is so low. The rivers flowing down from the hills, too, have smaller amount of gold dust in their waters. It seems like the gold mines of Buckure, renowned throughout the world, have finally been thoroughly emptied.\n\nWhile mining operations in Buckure will continue, we can no longer expect large quantities of gold to come from there. At best, there might be an occasional golden nugget, but nothing more."

###Ugabi unites the great lakes

great_lakes.2.d:0 "[This.GetNewspaperHeader]After the Storm King brought the Imperial Mazwi to its knees, the Zebrican region of the Great Lakes was plunged into anarchy. Tribal kings and local warlords clashed with one another as they struggled for power. In the end, only one ruler stood triumphant over all others, and has proclaimed a new nation to unite the Great Lakes once more.\n\nMukisa Karamela, the Nnabakyala of Ugabi, now stands as the master of the Great Lakes. A staunch absolutist of the highest order, Mukisa is considered semi-divine by her subjects. Where Mazwi was weak and impotent, she has shown her intent to bring peace and unity through faith, order and an iron hoof as clearly as anyone could."

great_lakes.9.d:0 "Our brave soldiers have secured control over the valuable gold mines of Buckure. A sizeable portion of all gold in the world has come from here over the years. Deposits were discovered around 800 ALB from alluvium which was panned in the nearby rivers. The gold produced was taxed by the Manza of Mazwi, and the vast amounts of wealth collected allowed the Mazwi to rise to greatness.\n\nNow with the goldfields in our control, the wealth can be fully exploited by us instead. There have been some reports that the deposits of gold are slowly being depleted, clearly evidenced by the fact that the local rivers have increasingly low amounts of gold in them, but there should be enough left to fill our coffers for many years to come."

Tribal kings and local warlords clashed with one another as they struggled for power. In the end, only one ruler stood triumphant over all others, and has proclaimed a new nation to unite the Great Lakes once more.\nThe ruler in question is Zonni Zolon, the regent of the Kingdom of Zar-Hay known for his brutal treatment of enemies. Many cities burned and many kings were slain as his army crushed all who stood in his way. Now he has crowned himself as Zuwa, Emperor, and established Imperial Zar-Hay as the successor of Mazwi. A reign of terror is to be expected, but perhaps only a strong ruler can bring order and unity to the region."

 magical_equipment_1:0 "Magic Rifles"
 magical_equipment_1_short:0 "Magic Rifles"
 magical_equipment_1_desc:0 "Magic is inherent to most sapient life, but not everyone can harness it as a weapon. Innovative designs in firearms have led to the invention of the magic rifle, a gun that uses specially imbued crystal-based cartridges to launch devastating spells against enemies. However, sustained fire makes the rifle prone to malfunctions due to the finicky nature of magic crystals. Despite its questionable reliability, the field of magic firearms is nascent and is bound to improve on these early designs."
 magical_equipment_2:0 "Automatic Magic Rifles"
 magical_equipment_2_short:0 "Auto. Magic Rifles"
 magical_equipment_2_desc:0 "Attempts to improve the firing rate of magic firearms displayed in full force the challenges presented in using crystal-based ammunition. Self-loading magic firearms require a far larger and heavier firing mechanism than usual, making a portable magic semi-automatic rifle unwieldy. However, this line of research has produced a viable light machine gun equivalent. Despite their propensity to misfire, the suppressive and destructive firepower makes these automatic magic rifles deadly weapons."
 magical_equipment_3:0 "Magic Light Machine Gun"
 magical_equipment_3_short:0 "Magic LMG"
 magical_equipment_3_desc:0 "Breakthroughs in spell imbuements lighten the cartridges used in magic firearms, allowing a streamlining of the firing mechanism of previous designs. The new design, in turn, reduces the overall weight of the weapon, turning previous automatic magic rifles into true light machine guns. Specialised ammunition also changes the spell launched at enemy targets, making for a more effective magic LMG for most situations."
 magical_equipment_4:0 "Modern Magic Rifles"
 magical_equipment_4_short:0 "Modern Magic Rifles"
 magical_equipment_4_desc:0 "Continued refinements in magic firearms design have finally yielded a set of practical select-fire rifles that can chamber crystal cartridges. In order to address the propensity of magic firearms suffering catastrophic failures, the overall fire rate is considerably lower than that of conventional assault rifles. However, these modern magic rifles are lightweight enough to be used on the move and are as effective as the regular service rifle."

 SIC_knights:0 "Rediarios"
 SIC_knights_desc:0 "Since the age of the ancient Karthin Empire, the griffons of Sicameon have prefered the Retiarii, fast and nimble fighters who ensnare their sword and shield wielding opponents with net and trident, rather than the feudalist symbol that is the Knight. Styled as the Rediarios in modern times, they trade their fishing fork and snare for the rifle, shovel, and camouflage net, vigilantly ready to quickly confront the enemy and stubbornly hold the line, figuratively ensnaring them with tricks, traps, and trenches and slaying those bogged down opponents with gunfire."
 SIC_tech_knights:0 "Retiarii Division I"
 SIC_tech_knights_desc:0 "Perhaps not known the world round but certainly feared by the knights of imperial Griffonia for their speed and cunning, the traditions of the retiarii are possibly even older than the knight, stemming from the ancient and humble fishergriff forced to fight. While not boasting the physical toughness of the knight, the retiarii boast great speed on the march, and can stubbornly dig themselves in to hold back even an armored assault."
 SIC_tech_knights2:0 "Retiarii Division II"
 SIC_tech_knights2_desc:0 "Through the use of improved training and equipment, we can strengthen our Retiarii Divisions."
 SIC_tech_knights_magical:0 "Professionalize the Retiarii"
 SIC_tech_knights_magical_desc:0 "Traditionally the retiarii have been an irregular force, acquiring their skills through their own experience and older fighters passing on their wisdom. Turning these great militia bands into even greater special forces units is only a natural evolution. Their lesser numbers also means we can provide them with more niche and experimental weapons and equipment."
 SIC_tech_knights_magical2:0 "The Griffons of Maritime Myth"
 SIC_tech_knights_magical2_desc:0 "No one less than the very most elite in both mental and physical prowess will be accepted to train and obtain the honored title of a Rediario, and through this these units will be feared as the stuff of legend, in the realm of sea monsters and Sycaecia herself."
 SIC_tech_knights_regular:0 "Maintain Egalitarian Standards"
 SIC_tech_knights_regular_desc:0 "The retiarii have always stood as a symbol of equality, that any common griffon can take up what arms they have and fight off any would be oppressor. To stratify our troops by imposing stricter standards would be blasphemous to what they stand for."
 SIC_tech_knights_regular2:0 "Legions of the Sea"
 SIC_tech_knights_regular2_desc:0 "Any griffon can attain the legendary title of Rediario if they train themselves hard enough and prove themselves in battle, and together they are like the great ocean waves combined with wit and soul: confounding and indefatigable. They are truly legions of the sea."
